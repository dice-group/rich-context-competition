    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The purpose of this study was to examine whether drinkers would change their alcohol consumption\nbehavior if an effective hangover treatment became available.\nMethods: An online survey was held among Dutch students, aged 18\u00ad30 years, who recently had a hangover.\nParticipants were asked (1) whether they would buy an effective hangover treatment if it became available and (2)\nwhether using such a product would increase their alcohol consumption. In a follow-up survey, the same partici-\npants could clarify their answers in detail.\nResults: A total of 1837 subjects completed the survey: 69.9% of the participants indicated they would buy an\neffective hangover treatment if available, 8.1% answered ``no'', and 22.1% did not know. Only 13.4% stated that\nusing such a treatment would increase their alcohol consumption. The majority of 71.6% stated it would not\nincrease their alcohol consumption and 15.1% did not know. The follow-up survey was completed by N \u00bc 471\nparticipants, of which 11.9% stated consuming more alcohol, 70.3% reported not to drink more alcohol, and\n17.8% did not know. Motives for not consuming more alcohol were ``The risk of having a hangover does not\ninfluence my drinking behavior'' (24.2%), and ``alcohol is a harmful substance'' (20.3%).\nDiscussion: Social drinkers second the need for an effective hangover treatment. However, according to the vast\nmajority of them, the availability of an effective hangover treatment would not result in an increase of alcohol\nconsumption.\n",

Reviews note that the effective-\nness of the majority of hangover treatments that are\nmarketed has not been scientifically investigated.\nThose treatments that have been examined show no or\nlittle effectiveness, and the quality of most of these clin-\nical trials have been criticized (Stephens et al., 2014;\nVerster and Penning, 2010). Although some products\nhave been shown to bring relieve to certain hangover\nsymptoms (e.g. reduce headache), other symptoms are\nnot alleviated. Hence, still today the only effective way to\nprevent a hangover is to consume alcohol in moderation.\nAs the costs of hangovers are largely underesti-\nmated, policy makers and health care campaigns have\nnot drawn much attention to the alcohol hangover. The\nfew studies that did try to calculate the socio-economic\ncosts of hangovers revealed that billions of dollars glo-\nbally are lost annually due to absenteeism, reduced\nproductivity, and increased risk of injury (Frone,\nalthough during the hangover state driving is signifi-\ncantly impaired (Verster et al., 2014a), yet most drivers\n1Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht University, The Netherlands\n2Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht University, The Netherlands; Institute\nfor Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, The\nNetherlands\n3Department of Psychiatry, Imperial College London, UK\n4Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht University, The Netherlands; Institute\nfor Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, The\nNetherlands; Centre for Human Psychopharmacology, Swinburne\nUniversity, Australia\nCorresponding author:\nJoris C Verster, Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht University,\nEmail: j.c.verster@uu.nl\nDrug Science, Policy and Law\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/dsp\npersist in driving while hungover (Verster et al., 2014b).\nGiven its costs and negative consequences, the need for\nan effective hangover treatment is evident (Verster, 2012).\nIt is a persistent popular believe that the absence of\nan effective hangover cure helps prevent drinkers from\nconsuming even more alcohol than they do already.\nAccording to this viewpoint, drinking in moderation\nis currently the only effective way to prevent hangover,\nand this helps many drinkers limit excessive alcohol\nuse. Unfortunately, this popular belief has also been\nadopted by many physicians and researchers. In this\ncontext, researchers have suggested that having no\nhangovers can be a gateway to alcohol dependence or\nIt could then be hypothesized that if drinkers experi-\nence less hangover symptoms they might drink more\nalcohol. However, this is not supported by a recent\nstudy that found hangover severity not to be signifi-\ncantly correlated to the amount of alcohol consumed\nor the achieved estimated peak blood alcohol concen-\ntration (BAC) (Hogewoning et al., 2016). Moreover,\nHuntley et al. (2015) examined the consequences of\nhaving a hangover for drinking on future occasions.\nThey showed that more severe hangovers did not pre-\ndict the likelihood of not drinking later that day.\nHowever, they did find that the quantity of alcohol\nconsumed on that occasion was lower than usual con-\nsumption levels. Other researchers reported that having\nhangovers does not prevent drinkers from consuming\nthe same amounts of alcohol on future drinking occa-\nTaken together, the severity of intoxication or hang-\nover effects seems unrelated to the actual amount of\nalcohol consumed. Up to now, however, no research\nhas directly investigated if drinkers would consume\nmore alcohol if there was an effective and affordable\nhangover treatment.\nGiven the lack of scientific data on the implications of\ndeveloping an effective hangover treatment, the current\nstudy investigated whether drinkers who experience\nhangovers would (a) be willing to buy an effective hang-\nover treatment and (b) whether using such a product\nwould affect the amount of alcohol they consume.\nMethods\nIn December 2016, an online survey was held among\nDutch students, 18\u00ad30 years old. The survey was\ndesigned using www.surveymonkey.com and advertised\nvia www.facebook.com. Online informed consent was\nobtained from all participants; no formal ethics\napproval was required to conduct this research, accord-\ning to the Central Committee on Research Involving\nHuman Subjects (CCMO). As a reward for participat-\ning, subjects could win a 100 Euro gift voucher. Data\ncollection was conducted by NeuroClinics, and funded\nby Sen-Jam Pharmaceutical. Unrestricted use of the\ndata was granted to the authors.\nDemographic data on age, gender, and weight were\ncollected. Weekly alcohol consumption was recorded,\nand the number of alcoholic drinks they consumed\nthe day before their latest past-month hangover.\nUsing a modified Widmark formula, taking into\naccount gender and drinking time, the estimated peak\nBAC was calculated (Watson et al., 1981). Overall\nhangover severity (i.e. a single one-item rating) and\nthe severity of 22 individual symptoms were rated on\nSubjects were asked whether they would buy an\neffective hangover treatment if it was available. The\nanswering possibilities where ``yes'', ``no'', and ``don't\nknow'', and a text box was provided to leave com-\nments. Subjects were divided into three groups (``yes'',\n``no'', and ``don't know'') according to their answer on\nthe question whether they would buy an effective hang-\nover product, and alcohol consumption-related vari-\nables were compared using nonparametric statistics.\nNext, subjects were asked whether they would con-\nsume more alcohol if an effective hangover treatment\nwas available. Again, the answering possibilities where\n``yes'', ``no'', and ``don't know'', and a text box was\nprovided to leave comments. Subjects were divided\ninto three groups (``yes'', ``no'', and ``don't know'')\naccording to their answer on the question whether\nthey would consume more alcohol. Alcohol consump-\ntion-related variables of these three groups were com-\npared using nonparametric statistics.\nIn a follow-up survey, conducted one week after the\nfirst survey, those subjects who left their email address\nwere contacted again and specifically asked via an\nopen-ended question to explain why they answered\n``yes'', ``no'', or ``don't know'' to the two questions\nposed in the first survey, i.e. (1) whether they would\nbuy an effective hangover treatment if it was available\nand (2) whether they would consume more alcohol if an\neffective hangover treatment was available.\nStatistical analysis\nOnly those subjects aged 18 to 30 years old who\nreported having a past-month hangover were included\nin the analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted with\nFor demographic variables and hangover severity\nscores, mean and standard deviation were computed.\nUsing Independent Samples Mann\u00adWhitney U tests,\nthese variables we compared between those who\nwould buy an effective hangover cure, those who do\nnot know, and those who would not buy an effective\n2 Drug Science, Policy and Law 0(0)\nhangover cure. Using the same test, these variables were\nalso compared between those who state they would\nconsume more alcohol when an effective hangover\ntreatment was available, those who do not know,\nand those who state that they would not consume\nmore alcohol.\nResults\nhaving had an alcohol hangover recently completed\nthe survey. Their mean (SD) age was 20.8 (2.3) years\nbeverages per week. Over a mean (SD) time period of\n5.8 (2.0) hours of alcohol consumption, they reported\nconsuming 12.6 (5.5) alcoholic drinks on the day before\ntheir latest alcohol hangover, which resulted in an esti-\nhangover severity was 6.1 (1.9). The presence and sever-\nity of individual hangover symptoms is summarized in\nWould you buy it?\nWhen asked whether drinkers would buy an effective\nhangover treatment was available, 69.9% answered yes.\nA minority of 8.1% answered ``no'' and 22.0% did not\nknow. Demographics and hangover characteristics of\nthe three groups are summarized in Table 2.\nThe analyses revealed that buyers do not signifi-\ncantly differ from non-buyers on weekly alcohol con-\nsumption or the amount of alcohol consumed the\nday before their latest hangover. However, buyers\ndo report a significantly higher overall hangover sever-\nity score when compared to non-buyers. Except for\nvomiting and anxiety, buyers also score significantly\nhigher on each of the individual hangover symptom\nseverity scores.\nMost commonly reported motives for buying an\neffective hangover treatment were ``I suffer from\nsevere hangovers, so this product is welcome''\n(40.5%) and ``it may help to be productive the day\nafter drinking'' (24.8%). Most commonly reported\nmotives for not buying an effective hangover treatment\nwere ``the hangover is a part of the drinking experience.\nI have to bear the consequences'' (23.6%), ``I am afraid\nI would drink more alcohol/the hangover prevents me\nfrom drinking more alcohol'' (21.8%), ``I do not suffer\nthat much from hangovers'' (15.5%), and ``I do not\nwant to use chemical/synthetic products, only natural\ntreatments'' (12.7%). Those who did not made a choice\nstated ``would only use it if adverse effects are known\nand safety proven'' (32.2%), ``if the price of the product\nis reasonable'' (13.6%), and ``I would only use it if the\nproduct consists of natural ingredients'' (12.7%). As\nthese motives were voluntarily listed in a comment\nbox and not specifically asked for, the percentages\nshould be interpreted as illustrative only.\nImpact on alcohol consumption\nWhen asked whether drinkers would consume more\nalcohol if an effective hangover treatment was available\nonly 13.4% answered ``yes''. The vast majority\nA comparison between these three groups regarding\ndemographics, drinking characteristics, and hangover\nexperience is summarized in Table 3.\nDrinkers who answered ``yes'' consumed signifi-\ncantly less alcohol during the latest hangover session\nwhen compared to drinkers who said ``no'' to the ques-\ntion whether an effective hangover treatment would\nversus 12.8 alcoholic drinks). Alternatively, drinkers\nwho answered ``yes'' report significantly more weekly\nalcohol consumption when compared to drinkers who\nsaid ``no'' to the question whether an effective hangover\ntreatment would increase their alcohol consumption\nferences are less than one alcoholic drink (\u00c00.7 and\n\u00fe0.5 drink, respectively), the relevance of these differ-\nences is unclear.\nTable 1.

Drinkers did, however, attest that they\nwere not planning to increase their alcohol consump-\ntion as alcohol is a harmful substance and they do not\nwant to become more drunk than they already are when\ndrinking. Alcohol consumption is viewed as part of a\nsocial gathering and has the purpose to have a good\ntime. Hence, most drinkers are happy with the current\namount of alcohol they consume and have no reason to\nincrease this amount.\nIn contrast, those who state that a hangover cure\nmight make them drink more alcohol explained their\ndecision by the fact that they currently moderate their\nalcohol consumption to prevent having a hangover,\nincluding the risk of reduced productivity. This idea is\nsupported by drinkers who are unsure about the effect\non their drinking behavior who stated that an effective\nhangover cure would make it tempting to increase their\nalcohol consumption. Although one can argue that it is\na minority of drinkers who held these views, they still\nrepresent a substantial number of drinkers.\nWhen looking at the amount of alcohol consumed\nprior to their latest hangover, all groups (hangover cure\nbuyers versus non-buyers and users versus non-users)\nshow comparable alcohol consumption levels (around\n12 units, reaching an estimated peak BACs around\n0.19%) that are significantly unhealthy. In terms of\nprevention and education, this type of heavy alcohol\nuse deserves attention per se. The findings of this\nstudy are supported by a recent naturalistic study\n(Hogewoning et al., 2016) where similar amounts of\nalcohol were consumed resulting in a comparable esti-\nmated peak BAC. In general, for health reasons mod-\neration of alcohol consumption should be advocated,\nand plans to further increase alcohol consumption\nshould be discouraged.\nThe study has several limitations that need to be\naddressed. First, the sample that completed the survey\nwere young volunteers, aged 18 to 30 years old. While\nthis is a population that is overrepresented in those\nindulging in heavy drinking and experiencing hang-\novers, it is not known from the current data if older\nadults and elderly drinkers would have similar views.\nSecond, as we asked for respondents' intentions regard-\ning future behavior, the current data does not prove\nthat this behavior would actually materialize. In this\ncontext it should be noted that the intentions of our\nrespondents contrasted with the observation made by\nHuntley et al. (2015) who found reduced alcohol intake\nthe day after having a severe hangover. To further\ninvestigate the potential protective effects of having\nhangovers with regard to future alcohol intake, pro-\nspective studies should be conducted to demonstrate\nthat the use of an effective hangover treatment would\nindeed not affect drinking behavior of the vast majority\nof social drinkers.\nFinally, the data clearly show there is an interest for\nan effective hangover treatment. The most mentioned\nmotives to buy such a product were to prevent experi-\nencing hangover symptoms and to increase productiv-\nity the day after heavy alcohol consumption. Only 5%\nof participants chose the option to prefer consuming\nless alcohol as alternative means to prevent the alcohol\nhangover and its functional consequences. Those who\nsaid they would to buy a hangover treatment do not\ndiffer in alcohol consumption or hangover experience\nfrom those who were not interested in buying a hang-\nover treatment. The latter implies that other factors\nthan alcohol consumption are important when\nmaking this decision. In this regard, the willingness of\ndrinkers to use chemical or synthetic products as\nopposed to natural products, pricing, and whether pos-\nsible adverse effects of using the product are known and\nits safety is proven were mentioned as relevant.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nJoris Verster has received grants/research support from the\nDutch Ministry of infrastructure and the Environment,\nJanssen Research and Development, Nutricia, Red Bull,\nSequential, and Takeda.
