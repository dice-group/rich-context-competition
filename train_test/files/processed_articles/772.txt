We\nconclude that reduction in spending growth creates measurable increases in\nhealth insurance coverage for low-income workers and that the rapid increase\nin health care spending over the past fifteen years has created a large pool of\nlow-income workers for whom health insurance is unaffordable.\nwithout health insurance increased substantially, but the\ncause of this increase is still not well understood. One poten-\ntial explanation is that changes in the structure of the economy, in\nimmigration patterns, and in educational achievement resulted in an\nThis explanation is clearly not supported by the facts.

Further, although income inequality has risen,\nthe second through the eighth income deciles, with the bottom\ndecile and the top two deciles posting slight gains in real income\ntially while real income has been close to flat; we cannot explain a\nvariable with a constant.\nA second potential explanation is that employment has shifted\ntoward jobs that are part time, in small firms, self-employed, non-\nunionized, or in service industries, all of which tend not to have\ninsurance benefits. However, a growing body of research suggests\nthat changes in job characteristics cannot account for much of the\ndecline in coverage.3 The basic argument is a simple one. First, job\ncharacteristics, other than income, have relatively small effects on\nthe probability of coverage. Second, the magnitude of changes in the\nproportion of workers in types of jobs less likely to offer coverage\nhas been relatively small and therefore cannot account for much of\nthe aggregate decline in workers' health insurance coverage. We add\nto the evidence for this argument in the results we present below.\nA third potential explanation is that health insurance coverage\nhas declined because health care prices have increased more rapidly\nthan income. This explanation is intuitively plausible: Even the cas-\nual observer is aware that health care prices have increased more\nrapidly than income for most of the past sixteen years. However, no\ndirect evidence has been assembled in support of this hypothesis.\nThis paper documents the extent of the decline in the percentage\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We also use this model to simulate trends in the number of\nemployed uninsured persons under alternative assumptions about\nStandard Economic Theory Of Insurance\nFirst, we consider whether we should expect the number of unin-\nsured persons to rise as the price of health services rises. Most\nnoneconomists assume that when premiums increase, the percent-\nage of the population willing (or able) to pay will fall, and the\nuninsured population will grow. Economists see a more complex\nrelationship.\nInsurance theory posits that the desire for insurance represents\nan attempt by risk-averse persons to maximize utility in the face of\nuncertainty: People do not know whether they will be sick and\nwould rather take a certain, moderate loss by paying an insurance\npremium than take the chance of financial loss from serious illness.4\nA health insurance premium has two components: first, the ex-\npected cost of medical benefits, and second, the loading fee--the\ncost of insurance administration, a return to the insurer to bearing\nrisk, and insurance company profit. Because most people are risk-\naverse, and because the tax code allows wage and salary workers to\npay health insurance premiums with pretax dollars, many people\nwould rather pay the loading fee than risk a large out-of-pocket\npayment if they are uninsured and become sick.\nAccording to this standard theory, the price of health insurance is\nnot the premium, but rather the loading fee.5 The theory makes\nunambiguous predictions about the relationship between the load-\ning fee and the demand for insurance: As the loading fee increases,\ndemand for insurance will decrease. Similarly, the standard theory\nmakes straightforward predictions about the relationship between\ninsurance coverage and marginal tax rates: As marginal tax rates\ndecrease, insurance coverage will decrease.\nThe standard theory does not, however, make clear predictions\nabout the relationship between the price of health care services and\nthe extent of insurance coverage (demand). Martin Feldstein has\nargued that as the price of health care increases, the demand for\ninsurance should increase as well.6 He contended that increases in\nthe price of health care services would raise total spending for these\nservices (assuming that the elasticity of demand is between 0 and\nHEALTH\nINSURANCE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 2\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Most persons with low\nand moderate incomes could not possibly pay for the care they\nwould need if they were uninsured and became seriously ill. They\nmight be forced to deplete their assets and then hope to receive free\ncare or qualify for Medicaid or another public program. The risk to\nhealth and future earnings for such persons can be substantial.\nAs the price of health care increases, persons with assets to pro-\ntect will see an increased financial risk from being uninsured, and\nmany will find higher premiums worthwhile. However, persons\nwith few assets to protect will get no greater benefits from insur-\nance when health care prices are higher than when they were lower:\nThere is no difference in the extent of financial protection and little\ndifference in the amount of protection to health. As a result, we\nexpect fewer low-income persons to buy insurance as health care\nprices increase.\nData And Methods\nn Sample characteristics. We used the March Supplements to the\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) to measure health insurance cover-\nage, earnings, and employment characteristics. Information on health\nexception of 1981; the combined sample is approximately 2.2 million\nrespondents. Questions on health insurance and earnings refer to the\nprevious year.\nWe restricted our analysis to adults ages nineteen to sixty-four\nwho worked during the previous year and did not receive health\ninsurance as a dependent or through a public program. We applied\nthis restriction for two reasons. First, we are modeling the effects of\nhealth care prices and personal income on a person's decision to\npurchase coverage. Very few workers who are covered by public\nprograms or as a dependent purchase coverage on their own; thus,\nincluding these workers in the analysis may bias our estimates of the\neffects of price and income on coverage decisions. Second, the CPS\nquestions on health insurance were changed substantially in 1988\nfor children age fifteen and younger and for those covered as a de-\npendent; the 1995 changes mainly affected coverage estimates for\nthe Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services\n(CHAMPUS) and dependent coverage.7 Restricting our analysis\nminimizes the effects of these question-wording changes on esti-\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Our goal was to measure\nthe premium for a standardized package of health benefits for work-\nUnfortunately, no nationally reliable data provide direct estimates\nof this amount. Instead, we used data from the National Health\nAccounts (supplied by the Office of the Actuary at the Health Care\nFinancing Administration), supplemented by data from the 1977\nNational Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMCES), the 1987 Na-\ntional Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES), and the CPS to esti-\nmate the total spent on a standard benefit package for our subset of\nworkers in each year. We then divided by the CPS estimate of\ninsured adults to estimate the price of services per person.\nIdeally, we would be able to estimate price changes for a standard\nbenefit package. However, the out-of-pocket share of total private\ninsurance rose, reflecting more complete coverage for those persons\nwith insurance.9 To estimate prices for a comparable benefit pack-\nage over time, our expenditure variable includes both out-of-pocket\nspending and spending covered by private insurance.\nFor each year we aggregated expenditures on the services typi-\ncally included in an acute care benefits package: hospital and physi-\ncian services, prescription drugs, home health services, and the net\nadministrative cost of insurance. Per capita expenditures were esti-\nmated using three steps: (1) Data from the National Health Ac-\ncounts were used to compute total expenditures on these services;\ntion of expenditures accounted for by insured persons ages nineteen\nto sixty-four; and (3) data on the number of insured persons from\nthe CPS were divided into these expenditure estimates.10\nOur key independent variable was the estimated per capita health\ncare spending for insured persons ages nineteen to sixty-four di-\nHEALTH\nINSURANCE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 2\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For\nwe divided estimated health care expenditures per capita in the year\nby the respondent's personal income. All analyses used sample\nweights in the CPS so that the results reflect the distribution of\nincome and insurance status in the U.S. population.\nWe estimated three logistic regressions to quantify the extent to\nwhich changes in the expenditure-to-income ratio account for\nchanges in the percentage uninsured. The dependent variable in\neach model is a 0\u00ad1 indicator of whether the respondent has health\ninsurance. In the first model the independent variables are dummy\nvariables for each year, so that we could estimate the association\nbetween year or time period and the percentage uninsured. The year\nindicators serve as a proxy for all variables that might have affected\nthe percentage uninsured. In the second model we supplemented\nthe year indicators with the measure of per capita expenditures\ndivided by each individual's personal income. In this model the pa-\nrameter estimates for the year indicators are a proxy for all variables\nthat might have affected the percentage uninsured other than the\nexpenditure-to-income ratio that is included in the model.\nThe third model includes additional independent variables meas-\nuring job characteristics such as firm size, union membership, part-\ntime status, and industry, as well as demographic characteristics\nsuch as age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education. Because firm size\nwas first asked in 1988, and union membership was only asked of\nabout 20 percent of the sample, we used a subset of our full data to\nestimate this model. We transformed the parameter estimates into\nestimated percentage effects on probability of coverage.11\nWe used the parameter estimates from the fully specified logistic\nregression to simulate coverage levels under alternative assump-\ntions about the future paths of expenditure and income. Each simu-\nlation used the sample of workers from the 1996 CPS who were not\ncovered by a public program or as a dependent and trended income\nand expenditures forward at specified rates. We assumed a 2.7 per-\ncent per year nominal growth rate for income, reflecting the assump-\ntion in the 1997 Economic Report to the President that the Consumer\nand that there will be minimal growth in real wages. We simulated\nthe effects of growth rates in health spending per capita for insured\nworkers of zero, 3.5 percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.5 percent per year. In\neach simulation the population of workers remained static, as repre-\nsented by the 1996 CPS sample. The simulations did not capture\nchanges in the labor force that will occur as the population ages, as\npeople enter (or leave) the labor force, or as a result of immigration.\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Although we have information on the insurance\nstatus, income, and other employment characteristics of almost\n900,000 workers over a sixteen-year period, we have only limited\ninformation to estimate insurance premiums: one observation in\neach year. This observation is not a direct measurement of the pre-\nmium for a standard benefit package but, rather, an estimate, con-\nstructed from a variety of data sources, of health care spending per\ninsured worker under age sixty-five on services typically included in\na health insurance policy. Our evidence about the relationship be-\ntween spending, income, and coverage would be stronger if we\ncould show that coverage declines were greater in areas where pre-\nmiums rose more quickly (relative to income). However, the lack of\nreliable data makes the success of any such effort doubtful.\nAll of the variation in the expenditure-to-income variable within\neach year is attributable to variation in income; the per capita ex-\npenditure amount in each year is a constant. To a large extent, the\nmagnitude of the parameter estimates on the expenditure-to-\nincome variable is determined by the strength of the relationship\nbetween income and insurance coverage; for example, our estimate\nof the effect of moving from an expenditure-to-income ratio of 0.08\nto a ratio of 0.088 is largely determined by the difference in prob-\nability of coverage for two persons with a 10 percent difference in\nincome.

The data in Exhibit 3 suggest that this assumption is a reason-\nable one. It would be desirable, ideally, to have separate estimates of\nthe effects of per capita spending and income on the probability of\nbeing insured; however, the limited information available on vari-\nation in per capita spending makes it impossible to directly disen-\ntangle the effects of changes in spending from other factors affecting\ncoverage that might have changed over time. As a result, we have\nadopted an indirect approach to solving the problem, analyzing the\nrelationship between coverage and the ratio of expenditure to in-\ncome. It is important to remember that although the cross-section\nvariation in the ratio results from variation in income, over the\nto-income ratio is almost entirely the result of variation in spending\nper capita. We have capitalized on this time-series variation to esti-\nmate the relationship between changes in per capita spending and\nchanges in coverage.\nChanges in health insurance question wording in the CPS raise\ndoubts about the ability to analyze the CPS data as a time series. By\nrestricting our analysis to adult workers not covered by a public\nprogram or as a dependent, we have minimized the effect of\nquestion-wording changes on the comparability of the time-series\ndata, but our conclusions would be stronger if the health insurance\nquestions had remained constant over time.\nWe have not explicitly accounted for changes in coverage that\nmight have occurred to the extent that increases in Medicaid cover-\nage enacted in the late 1980s \"crowded out\" private insurance. As\nargued by David Cutler and Jonathan Gruber, expansions of Medic-\naid eligibility in the early 1990s probably encouraged some low-\nincome workers (and their employers) to forgo private coverage in\nhealth expenditures made insurance increasingly unaffordable.\"\nHEALTH\nINSURANCE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 2\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, we implicitly controlled for \"crowd-out\" by\nfocusing our analysis on workers not covered by Medicaid.\nDiscussion And Policy Implications\nWe have shown that the sharp declines in insurance coverage\ntirely by the fact that per capita health care spending increased\nmuch more rapidly than income over this period. Real income per\nthe decline in coverage can be attributed to growth in per capita\nhealth care spending. More workers were uninsured in 1995 than in\n1979 because rising health care expenditures made insurance unaf-\nfordable for a growing number of workers.\nWe have demonstrated this result without entering into the\ntheoretical and empirical tar pit of attempting to determine whether\nemployers or employees really pay for health insurance. The stand-\nard economic view, which we largely endorse, argues that benefits\nare a form of compensation and that employers divide compensation\nbetween cash wages and benefits in the proportion that allows them\nto attract the quality and quantity of labor they desire. An employer\nable to pay total compensation of $7 per hour in 1979 might have\nbeen able to better attract workers by offering $6.40 per hour in\nwages and $0.60 per hour in health benefits. That same employer,\nstill offering total compensation of $7 per hour (in real terms) in\n1995, might be forced to spend $1 per hour for health benefits equiva-\nlent to the 1979 level, but now might find a better labor supply at $7\nper hour in cash rather than $6 in cash and $1 in benefits.\nDeclines in the number of employers that offer health benefits and\nincreases in workers' premium contributions can be seen as a proxi-\nmate cause of declines in coverage.16 However, it is not clear why\nemployers' behavior should have changed, especially during a time\nwhen real incomes had not been declining and job characteristics\nhad not been changing dramatically. We view changes in employers'\nbehavior as a phenomenon requiring explanation, rather than as an\nexplanation for declining coverage. We have shown that these\nchanges can be understood as a response to rising health care prices.\nWe have used our estimates of the relationship between wages,\nhealth care prices, and insurance coverage to simulate coverage lev-\nels given alternative assumptions concerning the rate of health care\nspending growth over the next decade. If health spending per capita\nrises 5.5 percent per year while personal income rises 2.7 percent,\nCOVERAGE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Some workers for whom health\ninsurance becomes unaffordable will suffer financial and health\ncatastrophes when they are uninsured and become sick. As public\nbudgets are strained and price competition in the private market\nlessens the ability of providers to cross-subsidize care to the unin-\nsured poor, increases in the number of uninsured will further tatter\nan already frayed safety net.\nThese findings have two important policy implications. First, to\nthe extent that the growth of price competition and managed care\nhas led to a moderation in the rate of growth of health insurance\nprices over the past few years, this has real benefits for low-wage\nworkers, more of whom are able to afford insurance than would\nhave been the case if prices had continued on their prior path of\nrapid increase. This is not a new observation, but our analysis pro-\nvides quantitative estimates of the magnitude of the effect and indi-\ncates the primary role of price in determining insurance coverage\nlevels. Those who see managed care as the enemy should keep in\nmind that limits on spending growth have had real benefits for\nworkers, not just for employers and insurance executives.\nSecond, our analysis reinforces the necessity for change in the\nrules of health care financing if employee coverage is to expand.\nGiven the escalation of prices over the past twenty-five years, health\ninsurance appears to be unaffordable for large numbers of low- and\nmedium-wage workers. If, as seems likely, health spending contin-\nues to rise more rapidly than income over the next ten years, then\nmore workers will lack insurance, not fewer. To avoid this, new\nsubsidies for lower-income workers will be required, likely com-\nbined with required contributions from employers and workers.\nThe authors acknowledge helpful comments from Amy Bridges, Tony Dreyfus,\nCindy Madden, and Tom Rice on an earlier draft of the manuscript.\nNOTES\n1.

Even in the best of economic\ntimes, a substantial percentage of the U.S. population of 270\nmillion people is uninsured, a societal problem that has yet to\nfully provoke the health policy community to act. The Clinton\nadministration's comprehensive solution was flatly rejected;\nthus, the president and Congress have returned to the politics\nof incrementalism.The administration and Republicans on\nCapitol Hill are expressing greater interest in encouraging the\npurchase of private health insurance through tax credits, an\napproach that President Bill Clinton proposed in his recent\nlong-term care plan. However, requiring that people purchase\ncoverage is an unresolved but ticklish issue for Republicans,\nwho fear that such an approach would be regarded as a tax\nincrease. Basic questions remain, though, about why health\ninsurance coverage has eroded over the past twenty years, and\nthat is the subject that Richard Kronick and Todd Gilmer\naddress in this paper.\nKronick, a widely respected student of health policy, is an\nassociate professor in the Department of Family and Preventive\nMedicine at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).\nOne of the founders of \"managed competition,\" Kronick\nserved as a senior adviser in the Clinton administration, where\nhe contributed to the design of the administration's health care\nreform proposal in the early 1990s. He earned his doctorate in\npolitical science from the University of Rochester. Gilmer, a\nhealth economist, is a colleague of Kronick's at UCSD. He\nrecently earned his doctorate from the University of\nWashington.\n\u00a9 1999The People-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nHEALTH\nINSURANCE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 2\nI n s u r a n c e C o v e r a g e\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
