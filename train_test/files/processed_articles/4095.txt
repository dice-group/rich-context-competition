Twisting of the\nspermatic cord is followed by testicular\nvenous occlusion, congestion, and, ultim-\nately, arterial ischaemia and testicular infarc-\ntion.1 Testicular torsion is more common in\nmales aged <25 years;1 affected patients\ntypically present with testicular tenderness\nand pain. Testicular torsion should be differ-\nentiated from other conditions that feature\nacute scrotal pain including epididymo-orchi-\ntis and appendicitis.2 Differentiation can be\nachieved by imaging modalities such as scro-\ntal Doppler ultrasonography and scintig-\nraphy. The use of laboratory parameters\n(e.g. leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimenta-\ntion rate, and alkaline phosphatase, creatine\nkinase and C-reactive protein measurement)\nhas been investigated in the diagnosis of\ntesticular torsion and acute scrotum.3\nMean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker\nof platelet activation.4 Although routinely\nanalysed along with other indices of the\ncomplete blood count (CBC), the MPV is\noften overlooked by clinicians. Research has\nsuggested the usefulness of MPV in the\ndiagnostic processes of various inflamma-\ntory and/or vascular disorders.4,5 This cur-\nrent retrospective study aimed to investigate\nwhether the MPV value, and the leukocyte\nand platelet counts, could be used for\ndiagnosing testicular torsion.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThis study retrospectively reviewed the\nmedical records of patients with acute scrotal\npain, who presented to the Department of\nUrology and the Department of Emergency\nMedicine, Medical and Research Centre,\nBaskent University, Konya, Turkey and the\nDepartment of Urology, Faculty of Medicine,\nBaskent University, Ankara, Turkey, between\ndiagnosed with testicular torsion underwent\norchiectomy and/or surgical detorsion and\nbilateral testicular fixation. Exclusion criteria\nincluded manual detorsion followed by\nsurgery on an elective basis at a later date,\nmyeloproliferative disorders, leukaemia,\nand Bernard\u00adSoulier Syndrome. A control\ngroup included healthy male volunteers\nselected from individuals who attended\nthe Department of Infectious Diseases and\nClinical Microbiology, Medical and Research\nCentre, Baskent University, Konya, Turkey\nfor an outpatient appointment. The control\nsubjects had no epididymo-orchitis, testicular\ntrauma, testicular tumour, previous scrotal\nsurgery, or abnormal renal or hepatic function\ntests. Demographic features and findings of a\npreoperative CBC (which included leukocyte\ncount, platelet count, and MPV) were rec-\norded for all participants. Age, leukocyte\ncount, platelet count, and MPV were com-\npared between the two groups.\nConsent was not required from the Ethics\nCommittee of Baskent University, Ankara,\nTurkey because of the retrospective nature of\nthis study. Written informed consent was\nroutinely obtained from each surgical patient.\nVerbal informed consent was obtained from\nall subjects in the control group.\nLaboratory measurements\nPeripheral venous blood samples (3 ml)\nwere collected into tubes containing 5.4 mg\nethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, and a\nrapid laboratory analysis was applied to\neach sample. An electronic cell counter\nAbbott Park, IL, USA) was used to measure\nthe CBC. At Baskent University,\nfl, the expected leukocyte count was\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Data were expressed as\nmean\u00c6 SD. Student's t-test was used for con-\ntinuous variables. The leukocyte and platelet\ncounts and the MPV were not normally\ndistributed and thus were compared with the\nnonparametric Mann\u00adWhitney U-test across\nthetwostudygroups.Thecorrelationbetween\nthe MPV and the othervariables was analysed\nusing Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\nA P-value <0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant. Receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve analysis was used to deter-\nmine the relationship between testicular tor-\nsion and MPV and leukocyte count.\nResults\nThis study retrospectively reviewed the med-\nical records of 350 male participants. A total\nof 53 patients were diagnosed with testicular\ntorsion. Three patients underwent manual\ndetorsion and under went elective surgery at\na later date, so were excluded from the\nstudy. Fifty patients underwent orchiectomy\nand/or surgical detorsion and bilateral tes-\nticular fixation for testis torsion (testicular\ntorsion group). Fifty-one healthy volunteers\nformed the control group. Clinical and\ndemographic characteristics of study par-\nticipants are presented Table 1. The mean\nleukocyte count was significantly higher in\nthe testicular torsion group compared with\nMPV was significantly higher in the testicu-\nlar torsion group compared with the control\ngroup (P < 0.001). There were no significant\ndifferences in mean age and platelet counts\nbetween the two groups.\nAccording to the ROC curve analysis\nperformed for the prediction of testicular\ntorsion, the best cut-off point for the leuko-\nspecificity 80%, area under curve [AUC]:\n0.7) (Figure 1). The same analysis showed\nthat the best cut-off point for MPV was 7.7 fl\n(Figure 1). MPV was significantly correlated\nwith platelet count (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nMeasuring the CBC is a frequently used,\nrapid and inexpensive way of providing\nvaluable information with regard to the\ndiagnosis and follow-up of various dis-\norders. Urologists frequently use CBC for\ndetermining inflammatory pathologies and\nfor undertaking routine preoperative\nTable 1.

Along with providing leukocyte, neu-\ntrophil and platelet counts, haemoglobin\nconcentration and haematocrit levels, the\nCBC also includes some parameters that are\noften overlooked, such as MPV and red cell\ndistribution width. In common urological\npractice, leukocyte count is frequently used\nfor assessing complicated urinary tract\ninfections.6,7 Leukocytes are immune-\nsystem cells that are involved in protecting\nthe body against infectious disease and\nFigure 1.

Assessing platelet volume\nand structure is helpful in diagnosing vari-\nous blood disorders such as idiopathic\nthrombocytopenic purpura and myeloproli-\nferative diseases.11,12 Larger platelets are\nboth metabolically and enzymatically more\nactive than other platelets and have a greater\nthrombotic potential due to their contents\n(i.e. thromboxane A2, P-selectin, and glyco-\nprotein IIb/IIIa).13 Elevated MPV values\noften indicate accelerated and increased\nproduction of young platelets (i.e. megakar-\nyocytes), with a resulting disproportionate\nincrease in the number of large hypercoagul-\nable platelets.14 Activated platelets also\nrelease antibacterial peptides.15 According\nto some evidence, however, certain patho-\ngens may have become able to exploit\nactivated platelets and thus to establish or\npropagate infection by binding to platelet\nsurfaces.16 In addition, studies have\nreported some changes in MPV values in\ncertain noninfectious inflammatory\nprocesses, possibly suggesting a role for\nMPV in reflecting the activity of certain\nThere is only one study in the published\nliterature that specifically sought to investi-\ngate the relationship between testicular\ntorsion and platelet count, clotting factors,\nand platelet activating factors.20 This experi-\nmental study reported that platelet\nactivation had a role in testicular ischaemia\nbecause ischaemia-related damage was\nreduced by the administration of antiplatelet\nactivating factor.20 To our knowledge, no\nprevious study has examined the MPV in\ntesticular torsion. However, the MPV has\nbeen reported to increase in urological\nvascular pathologies such as varicocele and\nerectile dysfunction.21,22 Furthermore, an\nincrease in the MPV has also been observed\nin conditions like patent foramen ovale,\nmyocardial infarction, and cerebral infarc-\ntion.23\u00ad25 Therefore, increased MPV values\nhave been considered a vascular risk factor.\nThis current study found no significant\ndifference between the two study groups\nwith respect to platelet count and there was\nno correlation between MPV and platelet\ncount. In contrast, the MPV was signifi-\ncantly higher in patients with testicular\ntorsion compared with the control group.\nTesticular torsion is characterized by the\ntwisting of the spermatic cord around itself,\nleading to intratesticular venous congestion\nand interstitial oedema. This situation\ncauses compression in the testicular micro-\ncirculatory system (venous\u00adarteriolar) and\nalteration of the vascular diameter.26,27\nStudies have shown that testicular venous\ncongestion causes formation of vascular\nmicrothrombi that induce the intrinsic\nhypoxia has been shown to increase\nthe formation of microthrombi and produc-\nvasoconstricting factor that acts via\nendothelin-A receptors.30 The use of a\nselective endothelin-A antagonist during\nthe reperfusion period improved the micro-\ncirculatory inflammatory reactions and\ncaused an earlier return of pulsatile blood\nflow in rats.30 These published findings\nsuggest that the MPV is elevated in testicular\ntorsion because this condition causes vascu-\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate and\nC-reactive protein, which are acute-phase\nmarkers, have been shown to be elevated\nduring the clinical examination leading to a\ndiagnosis of testicular torsion.3,31 The MPV\nwas shown to be significantly higher in\npatients with acute pancreatitis compared\nwith control subjects,32 but a significantly\nlower MPV was detected in paediatric\npatients with acute appendicitis.33 This\ncurrent study found a positive correlation\nbetween the MPV and leukocyte count, and\nthe MPV had a greater specificity than the\nleukocyte count for diagnosing testicular\ntorsion. These current findings suggest that\nthe MPV may have been elevated as an\nacute-phase reactant. The sensitivity of the\nMPV to diagnose testicular torsion was low\n(62%) in the present study. To our know-\nledge, no previous study has examined\nMPV values in testicular torsion, so it is\nnot possible to compare the present findings\nwith those of other studies.\nThis current study had a number of\nlimitations. First, it had a retrospective\ndesign. Secondly, it only had a small\nsample size. Thirdly, the control group\nconsisted of healthy men without epidi-\ndymo-orchitis, but the patient population\nincluded a low number of patients of similar\nage with epididymo-orchitis who underwent\na complete blood count and scrotal Doppler\nultrasonography. For these reasons, it is\ndifficult to conclude how beneficial it might\nbe to use the MPV as a parameter when\nexcluding inflammatory and noninflamma-\ntory causes of testicular torsion. Further\nresearch in larger patients groups is\nrequired.\nIn conclusion, although it had a low\nsensitivity, the MPV may be a useful ancil-\nlary marker for diagnosing testicular tor-\nsion. Without further published reports on\nthe role of testicular MPV values in relation\nto specific testicular inflammatory patholo-\ngies, the MPV might be helpful but not\ncritical in the diagnosis of testicular torsion.\nThe causes of the MPV elevation in\ntesticular torsion should be more fully\ninvestigated in future studies.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
