Pulse Index Continuous\nCardiac Output device parameters have been\nused to assess the effectiveness of treatment\nand to guide further treatment for patients\nwith shock.8,9 Assessment of serum lactate\nconcentrations early in the diagnostic process\nis also recommended, to evaluate the severity\nof the patient's condition, to observe the\neffectiveness of treatment and for predicting\nmortality risk due to shock.3,10 Circulating\ncell-free (cf)-DNA may be a useful biomarker\nof mortality risk in critically ill patients,11,12\nand has been proposed as a novel diagnostic\nand prognostic biomarker for various condi-\nThe mechanisms of shock are compli-\ncated, involving any of four pathophysiolo-\ngic subtypes (hypovolemic, cardiogenic,\ndistributive and obstructive), and result in\ncirculatory failure.18 The subsequent inad-\nequate oxygen utilization by cells results in\ncellular dysfunction and eventually cell\nnecrosis, and is general in all patients with\nshock.18 Degeneration of the cell nucleus has\nbeen shown to release cf-DNA into the\ncirculation.19 Healthy subjects have low\nlevels of cf-DNA in plasma,20 which origin-\nates from phagocytes removing dead cell\ndebris.21 As cf-DNA levels have been pro-\nposed as biomarkers of risk in critically ill\npatients,11,12 the present authors hypothe-\nsized that circulating cf-DNA levels would\nbe associated with risk of mortality in\npatients with shock admitted to the EICU,\nand may be used to improve risk prediction.\nThus, the objective of the present study was\nto investigate whether measurement of cir-\nculating cf-DNA levels could be a useful\nbiomarker of mortality risk in patients with\nshock in the EICU.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective cohort study was con-\nducted in the EICU of the First Affiliated\nHospital of Anhui Medical University,\nHefei, China between June 2012 and April\nthe criteria for shock on admission to the\nEICU, diagnosed according to the definition\nof the European Society of Intensive Care\nenrolled. Exclusion criteria included patients\nor patient's families who refused consent for\nparticipation, patients with shock following\na surgical procedure, patients with terminal\nmalignant tumours, elderly patients (>80\nyears), and those with autoimmune diseases.\nAge- and sex-matched controls were\nrecruited from the Physical Examination\nCentre, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui\nMedical University between June 2012 and\nreceived supportive treatment based on indi-\nvidual need. An electronic chart was used to\nrecord demographic data, prognosis, length\nof EICU and hospital stay, clinical diagno-\nsis, Karnofsky scores,22 skin condition\n(degree of cutaneous perfusion), co-morbid-\nities, vital signs, APACHE II score at EICU\nadmission, any organ dysfunction, details of\nany mechanical ventilation and/or continu-\nous renal replacement therapy, use of vaso-\npressors, enteral nutrition and laboratory\nresults (including lactate levels). All study\npopulation data were retrieved from medical\nrecords held at the First Affiliated Hospital\nof Anhui Medical University. The primary\nstudy endpoint was mortality at 28 days.\nThis study was approved by the Medical\nResearch Ethics Board of the First Affiliated\nHospital of Anhui Medical University and\nwritten informed consent was provided by\neach patient or their legal proxy.\nBlood sampling\nOn admission to the EICU and after 24 and\n48 h, 5 ml of whole blood was obtained from\neach patient into EDTA-containing tubes\nand kept on ice prior to transfer to the\nMolecular Biology Department, Central\nLaboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital\nof Anhui Medical University. Blood samples\nat 4C, plasma was aspirated carefully to\navoid residual cells and then immediately\nstored at \u00c080C to avoid DNA fragmenta-\ntion.23 The same process was conducted for\ncontrol blood samples.\nDNA was extracted using QIAamp\u00d5\nDNA Blood Mini Kits (QIAGEN GmbH,\nHilden, Germany) and eluted in a final\nvolume of 200 ml using QIAamp\u00d5 DNA\nBlood Mini Kit buffer (pH 7), according to\nthe manufacturer's `blood and body fluid'\nprotocol. The DNA samples were stored at \u00ad\n80C prior to use in quantitative real-time\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays.\nQuantification of circulating cf-DNA\nPlasma cf-DNA was measured using a\nSYBR Green dye-based quantitative real-\ntime PCR assay for the human b-globin\ngene,24 a housekeeping gene.25 The forward\nprimer sequence was 50-GCA CCT GAC\nTCC TGA GGA GAA-30 and the reverse\nprimer sequence was 50-CAC CAA CTT\ntion mix contained 2 ml DNA, 10 ml SYBR\nPremix Ex TaqTM II (TaKaRa, Dalian,\nChina), 0.8 ml forward primer (10 mmol/l),\nreference dye II (TaKaRa, Dalian and\nChina) and 6 ml distilled water.

Categorical variables were\nanalysed as percentages using 2-test or\nFisher's exact test. Receiver operating char-\nacteristic (ROC)27 curves were drawn to\nevaluate the discriminative power of lactate\nlevels 24 h following EICU admission,\nAPACHE II scores at admission, cf-DNA\nlevels at admission, cf-DNA levels 24 h\nfollowing admission and the change in cf-\nDNA levels over 48 h in EICU to predict\n28-day mortality. The area under the ROC\ncurve (AUC) was calculated for each ROC\ncurve, and reflects the value of the predictive\nvariable, as follows: AUC \u00bc 0.5, the variable\nhas no predictive value; AUC \u00bc 1.0, the\nvariable is fully predictive of the outcome;\nAUC between 0.5 and 0.7, the variable has\nsome predictive value; AUC between 0.7\nand 0.9, the variable has moderate predictive\nvalue; and AUC > 0.9, the variable is pre-\ndictive. The Youden index28 was defined as\nthe sum of the highest value of sensitivity\nand specificity (sensitivity\u00fe specificity-100%)\nor the ROC-curve point at which both\nsensitivity and specificity are maximal.\nAs cf-DNA levels were not normally\ndistributed, continuous levels were\ndichotomized at the cut-off value for max-\nimal sensitivity and specificity. Univariate\nanalysis using forward variable selection\nwas used to identify which variables were\nindependently associated with 28-day mor-\ntality. All significant variables were then\ntested in a multivariable logistic regression\nmodel to investigate which variables were\nindependently associated with 28-day\nmortality.\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 software, version 22.0\n(SPSS; IBM Corp.

Median\ncirculating cf-DNA concentrations on\nEICU admission and after 24 h in the\nEICU were significantly higher in patients\nwith shock whose outcome was fatal within\n28 days compared with those who survived.\nThe main finding of the present study was\nthat change in cf-DNA concentration over\nthe first 48 h of critical care treatment was an\naccurate mortality predictor in intensively-\ntreated patients with shock. This finding was\nindependent of the initial severity assess-\nment, including cf-DNA levels on admis-\nsion, lactate levels and APACHE II scores.\nOther variables, including 24 h lactate levels,\nAPACHE II scores, cf-DNA concentration\non admission and cf-DNA concentration\n24 h after admission were more dependent\non the underlying diseases or other\nconfounders, and when accounted for in\nmultivariate logistic regression analysis,\nthey were not found to be predictive of\n28-day mortality, despite the results of the\ninitial analysis.\nThe present data suggest that high circu-\nlating cf-DNA concentrations in patients\nwith shock are dynamic changes reflecting\nthe change of the patients' condition. Close\nmonitoring of plasma cf-DNA levels of\npatients with shock in the first 48 h of\nEICU care would provide information to\nhelp decisions about whether the patient\ncould be released from EICU care to a\ngeneral ward or whether they should con-\ntinue to receive treatment escalation. The\npatient population of the present study was\nstratified according to whether the cf-DNA\nconcentration change over 48 h was\n>16.12%, as a change of this size may help\nidentify individuals at high risk of mortality\nand who would benefit by continuing to\nreceive intensive treatment. Patients with a\ncf-DNA concentration change over\nmortality risk and, therefore, would be good\nearly EICU discharge candidates, freeing\nbeds to accept other critically ill patients.\nAccurate stratification of EICU patients\nwith shock is a prerequisite for therapeutic\noptions to lighten the financial burden of\npatients, improve patient satisfaction and\nreduce the expense of medical treatment.29\nTable 3.

The present study is the\nfirst to research and demonstrate a signifi-\ncant association between cf-DNA concen-\ntration change over 48 h and outcome\namong EICU patients with shock.\nThe present work has several limitations:\nFirst, the mechanism for removing cf-DNA\nin vivo is unclear,37 although investigations\nusing experimental models suggest that the\nliver is a major site for metabolizing plasma\nnucleic acids;38 Secondly, levels of plasma\nnucleic acids may be influenced by patient\nage and underlying diseases, and mechanical\nventilation and vasoactive agents increase\nthe circulating level of DNA;33 Thirdly, the\npresent study enrolled only 4 patients with\nobstructive shock, which precluded explor-\nation of cf-DNA levels between each shock\nsub-group; Fourthly, confounders, such as\nthe duration of shock before EICU entry,\nwere difficult to control for and the study\nsample was too small to adjust for multiple\nconfounders. The present study is also\nlimited by only using a single centre for\nsample collection. The present results, there-\nfore, need additional prospective validation\nin a multicentre study with a larger patient\npopulation.\nIn summary, circulating cf-DNA concen-\ntrations in EICU patients with shock were\nsignificantly higher than in healthy controls.\nCirculating cf-DNA concentrations at\nEICU admission and after 24 h were signifi-\ncantly higher in patients with shock who\ndied than in those who survived at least 28\ndays. Lactate levels at 24 h and APACHE II\nscores at EICU admission had lower pre-\ndictive values for 28-day mortality than cf-\nDNA concentrations. The most accurate\npredictor of fatal outcome for a patient in\nthe EICU with shock was cf-DNA change\nover the first 48 h of critical care. The cut-off\nvalue for cf-DNA change over 48 h found in\nthe present study may help physicians in\ndeciding which patients with shock should\ncontinue with escalating treatment and\nwhich can be discharged from the EICU.\n"
