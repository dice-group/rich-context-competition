This question, elicited to establish dialect\ncategorization, boundaries, and continua (see Tamati, 2010 and Baker, Eddington, & Nay,\n2009 and references cited there) is usually posed as a forced choice question: possible answers\nare already provided. The reason is obviously that open choice questions are felt to be too\ndifficult (like in Baker et al., 2009, p. 50). An apparent caveat of this method is that a\nproportion of answers consist of a (wild) guess. So let us face the facts and see what\nrespondents answer on the open question ``which language variety do you perceive?''\nWe conducted an online survey consisting of small excerpts of 20 to 25 s (two or three\nadjacent sentences) of read speech of French from France and Canadian French. The\nfragments were selected from the online corpus Phonologie du Franc\n\u00b8ais Contemporain\n(Durand, Laks, & Lyche, 2002). The selected fragments consisted of recordings of 12\nspeakers from Canada (six from Quebec and six from Peace River [Alberta Province]) and\n12 speakers from France (six from Paris and six from Dijon), equally balanced for gender and\nvaried for age. We investigated the ability to identify French from France and Canadian\nFrench by native speakers of four different French nationalects (viz. French from France,\nCanadian French, Belgian French, and Swiss French). In addition, we asked the subjects to\nestimate the level of standardness of the speech fragments. Respondents were contacted via e-\nmail and social networks of the authors. In total, 70 responses were received, but eight\nrespondents (all from France) did not complete the question about the geographic variety\nCorresponding author:\nMarjoleine Sloos, Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University, Jens.

Of the remaining 62 respondents, 16 were from\nFrance, 11 from Belgium, 10 from Canada, and 25 from Switzerland. The subjects were asked\nto estimate the level of standardness on a 5-point Likert scale as standard, near-standard, a bit\nstandard, nonstandard, or not at all standard, and were asked to estimate the speaker's\nlocation. They could listen to each fragment multiple times, go back and forth between the\nfragments, and adjust the volume to a limited extent.\nThe responses were divided into three main groups: correct, undecided, and incorrect.\nCorrectness was evaluated at the level of the nationalect. Answers referring to the local\nlevel like ``south of France'' were counted as correct as long as they fell into the target\nnationalect. Undecided were all answers equivalent to ``don't know,'' as well as answers\nthat did not address the geographical variation but rather stylistic aspects, such as ``very\nmonotonous.'' As expected, responses in the category ``undecided'' formed a large part of the\ntotal amount of responses: 35%. The remainder of this article is based on the total number of\ncorrect and incorrect answers, without taking into account the ``undecided'' responses.\nIncorrect answers could be categorized into three subgroups:\n(1) identification of a variety as the respondent's native variety, although it was not (i.e., own\nvariety bias)\n(2) the identification of a variety other than the respondent's native variety as second\nlanguage accented French\n(3) the identification of the respondent's native variety (i.e., French from France or Canada)\nas a different French variety.\nWe investigated the response patterns of the four listener groups (French, Canadian, Belgian,\nand Swiss) with a cluster analysis (Tagliamonte & Baayen, 2012), which is illustrated in\nFigure 1. The Belgian and Swiss listeners showed the same pattern and thus formed one\ngroup. We call this the outgroup, because their native variety was not included in the data.\nSpeakerVariety\nCanada France\nListenerGroup\n{French, Out} Canadian\nCorr Diff L2 own\nCorr Diff L2 own\nListenerGroup\nOut {French, Canadian}\nCorr Diff L2 own\nListenerGroup\nFrench Canadian\nCorr Diff L2 own\nCorr Diff L2 own\nFigure 1. Clustering of the responses as correct (Corr), different French variety (Diff), French as a second\nlanguage (L2), and own variety as an incorrect response (own).\nThe main difference is found in the response patterns on the Canadian and French data (see\nFigure1, Node 1). Further, we observe a noticeable difference between the French and the\nCanadian respondents on the one hand and the outgroup respondents on the other hand: the\nFrench and the Canadian respondents only sporadically (3% and 2%, respectively) identified\nthe other variety as one's own, whereas the Belgian and Swiss respondents identified,\nrespectively, 10% and 16% of the speech fragments as their own variety (see Figure 1,\nNodes 6, 8 and 9). Besides, we observed that the Canadian listeners judged more French\ndata incorrectly as a different French variety than the other participants (Node 9).\nAs for own variety bias, the Belgian subjects claimed 17% of the fragments from Dijon\nand 8% from Paris as their own, and one answer expressed a doubt between French from\nFrance and Belgian French. The Swiss listeners, in total, claimed 23% of the fragments from\nDijon, 19% from Paris, 1 from Quebec, and 2 from Peace River as their own, and in 3% of\nthe cases indicated doubt between French from France and Swiss French (these cases were\nincluded as own variety bias). In four cases (3%), Swiss respondents explicitly and incorrectly\nclaimed a Neuchatel accent, which was actually the variety of their own city of residence.\nNote that own variety bias does only occur in a significant proportion in the perception of\nFrench from France and not of Canadian French.\nThe differences in patterning across the French data as shown in Figure 1 are statistically\nsignificant. A logistic regression test (in R statistical environment [R Development Core\nTeam, 2009]) with model comparison showed a significant interaction between outgroup\n(i.e., Belgian and Swiss) listeners and French as the speaker's variety (z \u00bc 5.133, p < .001).\nWe also found a significant interaction between Canadians as listener group and French as\nthe speaker's variety (z \u00bc 3.019, p \u00bc .003). The different pattern of the Canadian listeners in\nthe Canadian data as compared with the patterns of the other groups was also significant\n(z \u00bc \u00c02.919, p \u00bc .004). In addition, there was a correlation with estimated standardness such\nthat the more standard the speech was perceived, the more likely it was that own variety bias\nAs far as we know, own variety bias in language identification has not been reported\nearlier as such. However, what scanty evidence is available shows that our findings don't\nform an isolated case. For example, Boula de Mareuil and Vieru-Dimulescu (2006) showed\nthat sentences with Spanish phonemes and Italian intonation as well as sentences with Italian\nphonemes and Spanish intonation were more likely to be judged as Italian with a Spanish\naccent by Italian listeners but as Spanish with an Italian accent by Spanish listeners. Further,\nWilliams, Garrett, and Coupland (1999, p. 353) observed in an identification study of Welsh\ndialects among adolescents, that more than half of the Cardiff listeners identified Northwest\nTable 1.

In a\nvowel perception study, Niedzielski (1999) showed that participants were likely to perceive\nvowels from a different variety as belonging to their own variety.\nIn conclusion, this article showed that Belgian French and Swiss French speakers\nidentified a considerable portion of the fragments of French from France as their own\nvariety. We believe this misidentification is grounded in their expectation that fragments of\ntheir variety were presented in the study, raised by the simple fact that the Belgian and Swiss\nsubjects were asked to participate in the experiment. The Canadian fragments were likely to\nbe so accented that they were not susceptible to own variety bias. Canadian and French\nparticipants are also likely to have had this expectation, but since their varieties were\npresented, and recognized, own variety bias didn't reach the surface.\n"
