In creating this program, the foundation aimed\nto support the development and implementation of new public/private\nhealth care financing arrangements at the state and local level Although\nmany of the fifteen projects sponsored by the program used multiple\nstrategies, the primary focus has been the development and marketing of\naffordable health insurance products for small businesses.1\nOf the projects targeted to uninsured small businesses, nine eventually\nenrolled firms to participate.2 As part of the overall program evaluation,\nsurvey data were collected from over 1,300 small businesses in four\ncommunities on the prevalence and characteristics of small businesses\nand their employees with and without health benefits and those partici-\npating in the sponsored plans. The results of these surveys give an\nindication of what well-coordinated, subsidized public/private initiatives\ncan accomplish and of how many and what kinds of small firms will elect\nto remain without health insurance.\nIn general, the foundation-sponsored projects have enrolled a rela-\ntively small percentage of the small businesses in their target areas; in\nmany ways, those businesses do not differ significantly from the firms\nalready offering health insurance to their employees. In our four survey\nsites, the market penetration rate--that is, the percentage of small\nbusinesses not offering health insurance that then enrolled in the\nfoundation-sponsored plan--ranged from 2 percent to 17 percent, with\nonly one project in the double digits. So, although these projects have\nincreased slightly the number of employees with insurance, they are not\nmaking great inroads into the hard core of small businesses not inter-\nested in offering coverage, given current options.\nDescription Of Study Sites\nSeveral strategies have been pursued by the four sites we studied\n(Exhibit 1). The Pima County (Tucson, Arizona) foundation-sponsored\nproject, Health Care Group, was administered by the state's Medicaid\nprogram (Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System [AHCCCS])\nand contracted with an AHCCCS health maintenance organization\n(HMO) in Tucson to offer four insurance plan options, varying in\ndeductible levels and coinsurance rates. An indirect subsidy from the\nstate, which provided administrative and marketing services to the\nHMO, reduced premiums to about 9.5 percent below their market rate.\nIn Hillsborough County (Tampa, Florida), the Florida Health Access\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

PPO is preferred provider organization.\nb Projects under The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Health Care for the Uninsured Program could\ndetermine whether or not (and for how long) businesses had to be uninsured (that is, could not offer a group health\ninsurance benefit plan) before being eligible for foundation-sponsored plans.\nc These figures represent the minimum percentage required from each employer.\nd Projects with indirect subsidies keep premium costs down by paying administrative and marketing expenses, by\nfunding or facilitating the purchase of reinsurance, or by providing stop-loss protection.

A national indemnity insurer contracted with the Denver\nDepartment of Health and Hospitals to sell the plan in the area.\nToo many confounding factors exist to allow us to ascertain the\nextent to which individual plan or site characteristics contributed to\nmarket penetration rates. However, information about what kinds of\nfirms were enrolling in each project is valuable in evaluating the effects\nof different approaches. In addition to surveying small businesses, we\nsurveyed insurance companies and agents in the four sites. The data help\nclarify what incentives and changes would be needed to make significant\nincreases in the provision of employer-based health insurance.\nStudy Methods\nThe Small Business Benefits Survey (SBBS) was conducted by the\nInstitute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan during\nthe summer of 1990 in the four sites. A small business was defined as one\nwith two to twenty-five persons working more than seventeen hours per\nweek, including any owner(s) who also worked at that location more\nthan seventeen hours per week. Because of the high employee turnover\nin this market, we asked respondents to count only those persons work-\ning the week before the firm was surveyed. To be eligible for our survey,\nsmall businesses that were part of a multibranch firm had to have\ndecision-making power for the health benefits offered to employees.\nSample frame. The sample frames of participant firms in Tucson,\nTampa, and Flint were the complete census of businesses enrolled in the\nfoundation-sponsored plan at the time of the study. In Denver, the\nsample frame of participants represented a subset of enrolled firms com-\npiled by Denver project staff. This subset consisted of firms with two to\ntwenty-five persons working who indicated at the time of enrollment\nthat they would be willing to be contacted at some later date for a\nsurvey--a stipulation placed by the insurance company selling the plan.\nOf the 224 eligible firms, 188 were willing to be contacted. There was no\napparent participation bias according to size or type of business.\nSample frames for the comparison firms--that is, firms that did not\nparticipate in the Health Care for the Uninsured Program--originated\nfrom either Dun and Bradstreet's Dun's Marketing Indicator (DMI) lists\nor the Employment Security Section 202 data (ES-202). DMI is a\ncommercially available sample frame of all businesses that have applied\nfor any type of credit, supplemented by various forms of business identi-\nfication, including the Yellow Pages phone directory. State ES-202 data\nare composed of all businesses within a state that file for unemployment\ninsurance payments.

Analy-\nsis of the two frames indicated few differences.3\nComparison firms from both frames were selected using a stratified\nrandom technique. Selection strata were defined by firm size and Stand-\nard Industrial Code (SIC). Employment-size strata were two to four\nemployees, five to nine employees, and ten to twenty-five employees.\nSIC code strata consisted of ( 1 ) agriculture, mining, and construction;\n(2) manufacturing, utilities, and transportation; (3) wholesale and retail\ntrade; (4) finance and professional services; and (5) other services.\nSurvey mode and instrument. A dual-mode mail and telephone\nsurvey was undertaken. All businesses in the sample were first contacted\nby phone to establish the eligibility of the business, identify the person\nwho would act as a respondent to the mail survey, and obtain correct\naddress information. All eligible businesses who completed the screen-\ning interview received a survey packet in the mail. Over the next few\nweeks, nonrespondents received a reminder and a second packet. Three\nweeks after the second mailing, all of the remaining nonresponding\nparticipant firms and a subset of the remaining comparison firms were\nselected for a telephone interview.\nThe survey questionnaire consisted of two sections: one that con-\ntained questions about firm-level characteristics, and one that consisted\nof a grid that asked for demographic and health insurance information\nabout each individual employee, up to eight employees. Because of\nrespondents' time constraints, firms with more than eight persons work-\ning more than seventeen hours per week (18.5 percent of the sample)\nwere asked at the time of the screening call to list all eligible employees.\nFrom this list, seven employees were randomly selected and, along with\nthe eligible owner, were entered in the grid with unique identifiers.\nAppropriate weights were then applied to these subsets in the analysis.\nResults Of The Survey\nResponse rates. The SBBS response rates were high relative to the\nresponse rates experienced by most national surveys of small businesses.4\nRates among participant firms ranged from 71 percent in Tampa to 84\npercent in Flint, with Tucson and Denver at 80 percent and 82 percent,\nrespectively. In Flint, where all comparison firms were contacted by\nphone, the response rate was slightly less, 74 percent. In the other cities,\nresponse rates were much smaller for the comparison firms (Tucson, 58\npercent; Tampa, 54 percent; and Denver, 55 percent), reflecting the fact\nthat only half of the firms that did not respond to the mail survey were\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Based on the telephone response rate\nfor the 50 percent subsample, we estimate the \"effective\" response rate\nin Tucson, Tampa, and Denver to be 70-75 percent.\nThree components of the analysis weights were applied to the SBBS\nsamples of participants and comparisons: ( 1 ) a basic sample selection\nweight, (2) a nonresponse adjustment, and (3) a population poststratifi-\ncation factor. All results reported use weighted data.\nCoverage. Even among this group of small firms, the propensity to\noffer health insurance clearly increases with firm size (Exhibit 2). This\ntrend is due in part to the fact that many small-group policies are not\navailable for firms with fewer than ten workers. In addition, certain\nunderwriting practices that could lead to exclusion and that are applied\nonly to the smallest firms result in lower levels of coverage.\nExcept in Tucson, approximately half of the firms with two to five\nfull-time workers offer health insurance. The provision of employer-\nbased group health insurance is much more common among the larger\nfirms, with a notable jump in the percentage offering insurance occur-\nring at six workers in Denver and at ten workers in Tucson and Flint,\nand a steady increase noted in Tampa.\nThe relatively high level of coverage in Denver for firms with ten to\ntwenty-five workers most likely reflects different work force and industry\ncomposition. Denver ranks second in the nation for median number of\nschool years completed by its residents and has 64 percent more college\ngraduates than the U.S. average.5 This may mean that the expectation\nfor nonwage benefits is higher. The average firm in Denver also earned a\nhigher revenue per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee (Exhibit 3).\nFirms Offering Health Insurance, By Size Of Firm, 1990\nSource: Small Business Benefits Survey, 1990.\nNote: Size of firm reflects number of employees working more than thirty-four hours per week.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In part, this defini-\ntion of firm size corresponds to health insurers' reluctance to cover\npart-time workers. With only one exception, the fifty-four health insur-\nance companies we interviewed restricted benefit availability to full-\ntime employees, usually defined as those working at least thirty hours a\nweek. We found that anywhere from 10 percent to more than 50 percent\nof small-firm employees are part-time workers, with those firms not\noffering health insurance having, on average, twice as high a proportion\nof part-time workers as those that do offer insurance (Exhibit 4).\nNot surprisingly, larger, wealthier, and older firms were more likely to\noffer health insurance. Firms offering health insurance were also more\nlikely to offer other fringe benefits and pay higher wages. Clearly, a lot of\nthese firm characteristics go together. In general, older firms are larger\nand gross higher revenue. However, most of these individual effects held\nup in logistic regression analyses. Gross revenue per employee, size, and\nproportion of full-time workers were all statistically significant determi-\nnants of the probability of a firm's offering health insurance.6\nParticipants. The foundation-sponsored plans appear to have at-\ntracted firms that are, on average, slightly smaller, younger, and poorer\nthan those firms that offered other forms of health insurance. In fact, the\nparticipant firms were younger than either of the comparison groups--\nthose with insurance and those without (Exhibit 5). With one excep-\ntion, they also had a lower revenue per FTE employee (Exhibit 3).\nIn Tucson, Tampa, and Denver, although the average participating\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Relative to firms\noffering other health insurance, the participating firms were more likely\nto gross lower revenues per FTE employee, with two to four times as large\na proportion grossing less than $30,000 and one-half to one-third as\nmany grossing over $90,000 per full-time employee. As with size and\nage, the distribution of participating firms with respect to revenue per\nFTE employee was close to that of firms without insurance.\nThe exception to this pattern is Denver, where two kinds of partici-\npant firms exist: those that did not offer insurance at time of enrollment\nin the foundation-sponsored plan, and those that did and were merely\nswitching to a different, perhaps lower-cost, plan. Denver was the only\nprogram site that allowed currently insured firms to enroll in the spon-\nsored plan. Approximately 40 percent of the Denver participants were\ninsured at the time they enrolled in the foundation-sponsored plan.\nThere is a clear difference in the two kinds of participant firms.

One-fourth of the newly covered firms in Denver had\nbeen in operation only one or two years at the time of the survey,\ncompared with only 7 percent of those switching. Almost 30 percent of\nthe participants without prior coverage reported gross revenues of less\nchanging carriers were in this bottom revenue group. The newly covered\nfirms were also significantly smaller (Exhibit 4). Given the relationship\nbetween age, size, and gross revenue of firms, it is possible that in a few\nyears both groups of Denver participants will more closely resemble the\nfirms with other sources of health insurance.\nOver half of the participating firms in Tucson, Tampa, and Flint\nreported changing carriers in the past three years. So, although firms\ncurrently offering health insurance were not eligible to enroll in the\nfoundation program, most of them had offered a plan in the recent past.\nOnly 20 percent of the firms without health insurance at the time of the\nsurvey reported having previously offered a plan. Even though the two\ngroups of firms appear similar in terms of size, age, and revenue, there are\nclearly differences in either the ability of the firm to obtain health\ninsurance or in employer or employee preferences regarding insurance.\nExcept in Flint, employees of participating firms earned, on average,\nhigher wages than employees of firms not offering health insurance and\nlower wages than employees of firms that offer other health insurance\n(Exhibit 6).

A significantly larger percentage of\nemployees of firms offering non-foundation-sponsored health insurance\nhad worked for that firm for more than three years, and a significantly\nsmaller percentage had worked for the firm for less than one year.\nReflecting the relatively young age of the participant firm, a smaller\npercentage of the employees of these firms had worked more than three\nyears than was the case in either of the other two groups. Employees of\nfirms that do not offer health insurance were more likely to be part-time\nworkers and, except in Flint, to be hourly workers. While an employee\nof a firm in Tucson that did not offer health insurance was more likely to\nbe a young, single man, there were no clear patterns in the other sites\nwith respect to age or marital status of the worker, nor the proportion of\nmen or women.\nApproximately three-fourths of employers, both participant firms and\nfirms offering other insurance, cited the need to attract and keep em-\nployees as an important reason for offering insurance. Almost half of the\nemployers said that a sick employer, employee, or a family member of the\nemployer or an employee was an important reason why they decided to\noffer health insurance. Except in Tampa, approximately one-third more\nparticipant firms cited this as an important reason than firms offering\nother insurance. The reverse was true in Tampa.\nPolicy Implications\nTo understand the kinds of firms responding to the Health Care for\nthe Uninsured Program initiative, we need to divide them into two\ngroups: those that offered health insurance in the recent past, and new\nentrants into the market. Those that previously offered health insurance\nlooked very much like the comparison firms, in both firm and employee\ncharacteristics. Why they dropped their previous insurance or why they\nswitched to the foundation-sponsored plan is not clear. Most mentioned\nlarge premium increases or dissatisfaction with the previous insurer as\nreasons for dropping coverage, and two-thirds said that finding an afford-\nable plan was an important reason for offering the foundation-sponsored\nplan. However, the importance of price in decision making was no\ndifferent for the firms that offered other insurance.\nMost of the Health Care for the Uninsured Program projects have\nfound a small niche in the previously uninsured market--firms that are,\non average, smaller and younger with relatively low revenue but with\nexpectations of growing richer and with higher-paid employees who\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

It is possible that the main\nbarrier to obtaining insurance faced by these participating firms was\ntheir relatively young age. In time, these firms may grow to resemble the\nfirms that had health insurance coverage from other sources.\nWhichever group we examine, the market shares of the foundation-\nsponsored plans are quite small. The largest share is in Tampa, where we\nestimate that approximately 17 percent of the firms with two to twenty-\nfive employees that did not have health insurance enrolled in the\nFlorida Health Access Corporation plan. The other three sites achieved\nmuch lower shares, ranging from 2 to 5 percent.\nThese low rates are consistent with the low penetration rates esti-\nmated by Ken Thorpe and colleagues in the Brooklyn and Albany pilot\nstudies.7 In all cases, the premiums were subsidized; there were not many\ntakers. There are obviously many possible reasons, including offering\nwhat is perceived as an undesirable package (for example, the Arizona\nHealth Care Group uses HMOs under contract with the state's Medicaid\nprogram, in contrast to Florida's offer of an established and respected\nHMO at a heavily subsidized price; the SCOPE plan in Denver has a\nvery high copayment), insufficient or ineffective marketing to potential\nenrollees, and premiums that remain \"too high.\"8\nOur results give some additional insight into why so many small firms\ndo not offer insurance. For example, because of certain insurance indus-\ntry underwriting practices, specific businesses may have difficulty finding\ninsurance products. Our survey of insurers found systematic exclusions of\ncertain businesses.9 Other insurers will cover these industries, but they\nadd a substantial (as high as 50 percent) surcharge to the usual premium.\nAnother gap in coverage exists for part-time workers. Our results\nindicate that businesses with a larger proportion of full-time workers are\nmore likely to offer health insurance. In addition, the percentage of\nfull-time workers with employment-based health insurance was two to\nthree times greater than the percentage of their insured counterparts\nworking fewer than thirty hours a week.\nWe also found that there is a fairly hard-core group of small-business\nowners who do not want to provide health insurance benefits to their\nemployees. Almost half of the employers in our survey who do not offer\nhealth insurance indicated that they were not interested in doing so.\nUsually these employers state that this lack of coverage reflects a lack of\ndemand on the part of their employees, that they can recruit employees\nwithout it, and that most of their employees are covered elsewhere.\nWithout doubt, however, cost is the primary reason given for why these\nemployers do not offer health insurance. Many were as concerned about\nthe rapid increase in premiums as with their current level, often citing\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For the younger firms that enrolled, coverage probably came\nsooner than would otherwise have been the case. Whether some of the\nother firms would have had access to or found other affordable plans is\nnot clear. What is clear is that the impact of this relatively small\nprivate/public-sector initiative was fairly limited. Larger efforts are called\nfor if we want to make significant reductions in the number of people\nwho lack health insurance coverage.\nNOTES\n1. For more on these projects, see W.D. Helms, A.K. Gauthier, and D.M. Campion,\n\"Mending the Flaws in the Small-Group Market,\" in this volume of Health Affairs.\n2.

Steve Heeringa at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research is prepar-\ning a final technical memorandum on the differences between the DMI and the ES-202\nsample frames.
