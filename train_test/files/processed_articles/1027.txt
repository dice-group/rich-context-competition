Specifically, the percentage of girls in-\n12th grade girls nationwide reported physically fighting\nwith others in a 12-month period underscores the need\nfor further investigation of potential causes.\nExposure to violence in the home includes being the vic-\ntim of child physical or sexual abuse by intimates, wit-\nnessing violence between caregivers, and violent alter-\ncations with family members, including siblings. Each\ntype of victimization has been shown to be a risk factor\nfor adolescent aggression as well as for delinquency and\ninvolvement with the criminal justice system.15-20 Addi-\ntionally, studies indicate that girls who perpetrate vio-\nlence are significantly more likely to have experienced\nResearch consistently identifies exposure to violence\nin the neighborhood as a precursor to adolescents' vio-\nlent behavior, typically using individual reports of neigh-\ngregated neighborhood conditions in addition to\nindividual reports is a burgeoning area of scientific in-\nquiry in public health,26 especially as the statistical meth-\nods for analyzing hierarchical data have evolved.27 As an\nexample of the effect of neighborhood conditions on ado-\nlescent behavior, higher levels of physical and social dis-\norder and having fewer safe places for children to play\nboth were associated with a higher likelihood of youths\ncarrying concealed firearms, even when individual risk\nfactors for gun carrying were controlled.28\nThe current inquiry focuses on individual-level vic-\ntimization and neighborhood violence and their rela-\ntionships to the subsequent perpetration of violent be-\nhaviors by adolescent girls. Although most studies\nfocusing on girls' violent behavior have used special popu-\nlations (eg, clinically referred or juvenile justice samples)\nor cross-sectional surveys, this study examines girls' vio-\nlent behavior prospectively among a representative, di-\nverse, community-based sample. Aims of the inquiry were\nto describe violent behaviors by girls across 3 waves of\ndata and to identify both individual- and neighborhood-\nlevel risk factors for violence perpetration, in addition\nto more traditional factors such as age, family composi-\ntion, family socioeconomic status, and baseline rates of\nviolent behavior.\nMETHODS\nData for this study of girls' violence came from the Project on\nHuman Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN).\nThe PHDCN is a multidisciplinary, longitudinal study of the\ndevelopment of antisocial behavior, prosocial behavior, and men-\ntal health among youth and their primary caregivers, as well\nas a study of their neighborhoods over time. Detailed methods\nare published elsewhere.29\nInformed consent for each interview was obtained from a par-\nent or guardian of the subject in the longitudinal cohort study.\nAssent was obtained from the youth respondents prior to each\nassessment. Procedures were approved by 2 institutional re-\nview boards at Harvard University, Boston, Mass.\nThe design of the PHDCN consists of a longitudinal cohort\nstudy imbedded within a community study. Neighborhood-\nlevel data for PHDCN participants were obtained from (1) a\ncommunity survey of 8782 randomly selected Chicago resi-\nobtained from the Chicago Police Department, and (3) US Cen-\nsus data from 1990. Individual- and family-level data were col-\nlected by a longitudinal cohort study completed between No-\nand their caregivers were enrolled.\nSAMPLING\nChicago neighborhoods were initially grouped into 343 neigh-\nborhood clusters, each with approximately 8000 residents. Strati-\nfied probability sampling was then used to select a sample of\n80 neighborhood clusters diverse in race/ethnic and socioeco-\nnomic composition for intensive study.\nFor the longitudinal cohort study, dwelling units were enu-\nmerated and approximately 35 000 randomly sampled house-\nholds were screened for children and adolescents of eligible ages\nwithin the 80 selected neighborhoods. Children who were within\n6 months of 7 target cohort ages (0 [in utero through the age\nticipate. The participation rate was 75%. A primary caregiver\nwas enrolled for all children except the 18-year-old cohort. Three\nin-home interviews were conducted at approximately 24-\nfor the current analyses come from girls enrolled in cohorts 9,\n12, and 15 years and their primary caregivers.\nMEASURES\nTable 1 displays the instruments used at each of the 3 inter-\nviews and how each measure was used in the present analysis.\nAs noted in Table 1, the individual-level confounders and neigh-\nborhood-level variables described below were measured at wave\n1 (the first interview), individual-level victimization expo-\nsures were measured at wave 2, and outcomes were measured\nat wave 3. Additionally, 3 waves of self-report violent behav-\nior data were used to describe prevalence across the age range\nof study participants.\nQuestionnaires were administered in respondents' homes by\ntrained interviewers. Based on a scale adapted from an earlier\ninstrument by Elliott et al,30 perpetration of 1 or more of the\nfollowing 8 past-year violent behaviors with intent to cause in-\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

The outcome measure was\ndeveloped based on third-interview responses by girls on this\nscale. Items were selected because they were aggressive acts\nagainst people and because item-response analysis31,32 of their\npsychometric properties showed that, as a scale, they had good\nreliability and validity. An item measuring hitting people within\nthe home did not fit well and was dropped.33\nAt the third interview, girls reported 6 of 8 original violent\nact items (at baseline they had reported all 8). This led us to\nbase the outcome measures for the statistical model solely on\nthe 6 outcomes that were reported by at least 1 of the respon-\ndents--hitting someone outside the home; attacking with a\nweapon; throwing rocks or bottles; setting fires to buildings,\ncars or property; carrying a hidden weapon; and participating\nin a gang fight. (Using weapons or force to rob someone and\npicking pockets or purse snatching were not reported in the\nthird interview.)\nThe main individual-level exposure variable for this study was\nviolent victimization, as reported at the second interview. Mea-\nsures included whether girls were attacked with a weapon, beaten\nup, chased, shot at, or threatened with serious harm in the past\nyear, as well as reports of past-year sexual assault (molesta-\ntion or rape). These measures come from My Exposure to Vio-\nlence, an instrument developed by the PHDCN.34 Psychomet-\nric study of the scale of violent victimization showed good item\nfit, good reliability (Cronbach =.83), and good construct va-\nlidity (the scale relates to behavioral and emotional symptoms\nin predictable ways). It was initially determined that sexual as-\nsault was better treated as a separate item since it did not cor-\nrelate as highly with the others and the Cronbach  for the non-\nsexual victimization scale did not decrease with its deletion.\nHowever, given that a high degree of overlap existed between\nthose who were physically and sexually victimized and the low\nprevalence of past-year sexual assault in our sample, we con-\nstructed one combined measure of violent victimization, indi-\ncating experiencing at least one of those forms--sexual and/or\nnonsexual--of violent victimization in the past year.\nAll individual and family confounders were measured at base-\nline. Using the same measures of violent events as was used\nfor the study outcome measure, self-reported violence is a sum\nof violent behaviors by the girls in the year prior to the base-\nline interview. Family socioeconomic status is a composite of\n3 variables: parental income, parental educational level, and pa-\nrental occupational code, created using principal components\nanalysis. The maximum value was used for each of the 3 vari-\nables if there were 2 parents in the household. Deviance of peers\nconsists of the degree to which girls' peer groups engaged in\nrisky and/or prosocial behaviors. Given the large number of in-\ndicators of peer deviance, cluster analysis helped us to first iden-\ntify groupings that represented substantive dimensions of in-\nterest. Principal components analysis then allowed us to create\nuncorrelated weighted linear composites with maximum vari-\nances. The original 30 variables measured the number of peers\nwho displayed the following specific characteristics in the past\nyear: cluster 1, involved in risky activities (skipping school, tak-\ning a vehicle without permission, selling drugs, using illegal\nsubstances, and/or having sexual intercourse); cluster 2, dis-\nplaying negative relations with others (not getting along with\nteachers, disobeying school rules, getting in trouble in school\nand/or at home, lying and/or disobeying adults, and hitting some-\none to hurt them); cluster 3, displaying positive characteris-\ntics (considered good citizens, good students, and/or gener-\nally honest); cluster 4, involved in criminal activities (stealing,\nbreaking and/or entering, and/or attacking with a weapon); and\nTable 1.

Illegal substance use is the number of days of use of al-\ncohol, marijuana, cocaine, crack, and inhalants in the past year.\nFamily structure was classified as whether the youth respon-\ndent was living with 1 biological parent, 2 biological parents,\n1 nonbiological parent, or 1 biological and 1 nonbiological par-\nent. Age, race/ethnicity, and parents' marital status (married\nvs not married) also were included.\nFor each neighborhood cluster, neighborhood-level measures\nwere estimated using aggregated data from 3 sources: the US\nCensus, the 1995 PHDCN Community Survey, and the Chi-\ncago Police Department. These data sources provided esti-\nmates of neighborhood conditions independent of data ob-\ntained from individual girls and their caregivers. Violent\nvictimization at the neighborhood level was measured by 1 di-\nchotomous item from the 1995 community survey (aggre-\ngated to the neighborhood cluster level) asking whether any-\none in the household had been the victim of a mugging, fight,\nor sexual assault since they began living in that neighbor-\nhood. The Chicago Police Department provided data to esti-\nmate the 1995 homicide rate for each neighborhood cluster.\nThis rate was calculated by taking the number of homicides and\ndividing by the 1990 population count, using the formula\nally, a neighborhood-level covariate was used to control for po-\ntential confounding: a scale of concentrated poverty was de-\nrived from 1990 US Census measures of (1) percentage living\nbelow the poverty line, (2) percentage unemployed, and (3)\npercentage on public assistance, using principal components\nanalysis.\nTo describe the patterns of violent behavior across the 3 waves\nof data collection, we constructed age-violence curves delin-\neated by individual-level victimization. Coefficients from a re-\npeated-measures marginal model with a binomial distribution\nwere used to create the curves. Violent behaviors and history\nof victimization at all 3 waves were in the model, as well as fam-\nily socioeconomic status. Since there is a trend for violence per-\npetration to desist during late adolescence,35 it was expected\nthat violence would decrease across the years of the study. Age-\nviolence curves were created for the whole sample, as well as\nseparately for girls exposed and unexposed to violent victim-\nization. We hypothesized that girls exposed to violence would\nhave higher rates of violent perpetration and perhaps desist more\nslowly during the study period.\nNext, we estimated the likelihood of perpetrating violence\nby using a multivariate, 3-level random intercept Rasch mea-\nsurement model with wave 3 violence items at level 1; individual-\nlevel predictors, a propensity score in quintiles, and random\neffects at level 2; and neighborhood-level covariates at level 3.\nRaudenbush et al33 described and demonstrated the validity of\nthis method.\nRather than include a large set of potential confounders of the\nmain relationship of interest in the multilevel models, a pro-\npensity score derived from the baseline data was used to rep-\nresent the confounders in a single composite.36 Propensity score\nanalysis has been shown to produce estimates that are less bi-\nased, more robust, and more precise than logistic regression\nestimates when there are 7 or fewer exposed subjects per con-\nfounder.37 Propensity score analysis uses a preliminary regres-\nsion model to identify predictors of victimization (the expo-\nsure in this study) from observed background characteristics\nthat preceded the victimization. It then uses the estimated prob-\nability of being victimized to represent all of the background\ncharacteristics. By dividing the propensity score into quin-\ntiles, and examining the data to see whether a balanced num-\nber of victimized and nonvictimized girls fall into each quin-\ntile, we were able to ensure that we had sufficient data to compare\nexposed and unexposed subjects who had similar values on the\nconfounding variables. Additionally, use of this method avoided\npotential overparameterization of the model, given the large\nnumber of confounders and the low prevalence of violent be-\nhavior by the third interviews.\nConfounders in the propensity score (all described above)\nincluded age at enrollment, race/ethnicity, parental marital sta-\ntus, family structure, and socioeconomic status, in addition to\nbehavioral indicators found to have a significant association with\nbeing in fights as either perpetrator or victim: peer devi-\nance,38-41 illegal substance use,40 and previous perpetration of\nviolence.41 Missing confounder variables were given \"0\" if cat-\negorical and the mean value if continuous, and dummy vari-\nables indicating the presence of missing observations for each\nspecific covariate were included. This imputation of missing\nconfounder variables affected 5.0% of the sample. The one neigh-\nborhood-level variable included as a potential confounder, con-\ncentrated poverty, was entered separately into the 3-level ana-\nlytic models, rather than as a neighborhood-level propensity\nscore.\nModels first estimated the association between victimization\nand propensity to perpetrate violence, controlling solely for age\n(centered at the age of 14 years, since it was the mean age to\ncommit violent acts among girls as noted in the literature) and\nage squared at level 1. The models then introduced the pro-\npensity score to adjust for individual-level confounders at level\n2. The propensity score was divided into quintiles and entered\nas 4 categories (quintile 5 as the reference) to avoid assump-\ntions of linearity of the association between the propensity score\nand the outcome. In addition to its inclusion in the propensity\nscore, additional adjustment for baseline reports of perpetra-\ntion of violence was initially introduced in the models. How-\never, since such adjustment did not change the magnitude or\nsignificance of the associations and baseline violence was not\nsignificantly associated with future perpetration after adjust-\nment for the propensity score, this variable was deleted from\nthe models. Models then estimated the association between\nneighborhood-level violence and perpetration by introducing\nneighborhood-level victimization and the 1995 neighborhood\nhomicide rate at level 3. Further adjustment was made for neigh-\nborhood-level confounding by introducing concentrated pov-\nerty. Propensity scores were estimated using SAS, version 8,42\nand multilevel models were estimated using HLM, version 5.43\nOf the 1164 girls who had completed the first interview, 82%\nwere retained at the second interview, and 68.6% were re-\ntained at the third interview. Of the 799 respondents who par-\nticipated in all 3 interviews, 5 persons had missing observa-\ntions on all the victimization exposure items at wave 2, and 1\nperson had missing data on all the violent perpetration items\nat wave 3. This led to a sample of 793 subjects. To maximize\nthe longitudinal order of the data, we then removed 156 sub-\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\njects who had been victimized prior to wave 2. We had ini-\ntially considered using the sample of 793 subjects and con-\ntrolling for victimization prior to wave 2. This led to an\nimbalance in the propensity score whereby 157 subjects did\nnot have a \"match\" of unexposed in terms of control for con-\nfounding and would have to be removed from the analysis.\nThe final sample thus consisted of 637 girls who (1) com-\npleted all 3 interviews, (2) answered at least 1 of the items of\ninterest on violent perpetration and 1 of the items of interest\non victimization exposure, and (3) had not been victimized\nprior to wave 2.\nThe final analytic sample differed in 3 important ways from\nthose who dropped out of the study or were removed from the\nstudy because of missing observations or prior victimization:\nthe removed subjects were more likely to report deviant peers,\nless likely to have married caregivers, and more likely to have\na higher rate of baseline violence.\nRESULTS\nThe Figure illustrates the pattern of girls' violent be-\nhavior across the 3 waves of data. Looking at the curve\nfor the full sample, there was a peak in violent behavior\nfor all girls at the age of 14 years, with an initial increase\nwith age, then a later decrease, as expected during ado-\nlescence.35 By displaying stratified curves (victimized at\nany wave vs not victimized at any wave vs all respon-\ndents), these curves give preliminary indications that the\nprevalence of violent behavior is higher among girls who\nreport violent victimization than among girls who did not.\nAdditionally, the acceleration of violent behavior was\nsteeper for the victimized girls, with a peak at the age of\n17 years. More than one third (38%) of the respondents\nreported perpetrating at least 1 type of violent behavior\nin the 12 months prior to the baseline interview; more\nthan one quarter (28%) of the girls reported perpetrat-\ning violent behavior in the 12 months prior to the first\nfollow-up interview, and one-seventh (14%) of the girls\nreported violence at the third interview.\nTable 2 lists the prevalence of girls' perpetration of\nviolent acts by history of exposure to violent victimiza-\ntion.

As summarized in Table 3,\ngirls who had been violently victimized also were more\nlikely to report associations with deviant peers and us-\ning illegal substances, and were in the oldest age cohort\nat baseline. They were less likely to report having peers\nwho exhibited positive characteristics and more likely to\nreport black or other race/ethnicity and having unmar-\nried parents (Table 3).\nThe propensity score model, which denotes the pro-\npensity of individuals to be victimized, had a c-statistic\nof 0.72. This indicated that the propensity score model\nhad an adequate capacity to predict exposure to victim-\nization; thus, by including the propensity score in the main\nstudy model, it was possible to adequately control for se-\nlection.\nTable 4 lists the crude and adjusted models estimat-\ning the association between past-year victimization ex-\nperiences reported at wave 2 and the probability of re-\nporting perpetrating violence in wave 3. It also reports\non the association between neighborhood violence and\nthe probability of violent behavior by girls. Model 1 in-\ndicates that, controlling only for age at wave 3, girls who\nhad been victimized by wave 2 had 2.9 times higher odds\ning perpetrated violence at wave 3 than girls who had not\nbeen victimized. Adjustment for the propensity score re-\nsulted in a decrease in magnitude of the odds of perpe-\n4.5). Further adjustment for concentrated poverty of the\nneighborhood did not change the magnitude of the es-\ntimate. Concentrated poverty was independently asso-\nciated with a higher probability of perpetrating violence\nThe probability of violent perpetration by girls was not\nhigher in neighborhoods with more reports of violent\nvictimization by residents. However, in neighborhoods\nwith higher homicide rates, there was a trend toward\nhigher probability of violence by girls (OR=1.1, 95%\nCI=0.9-1.02). When we examined cross-level interac-\ntions between neighborhood violence and individual vic-\ntimization (Table 5), we found that the effect of indi-\nvidual-level victimization on subsequent violent behavior\nwas approximately the same whether girls lived in neigh-\n13.0) or in neighborhoods with a 1-unit increase in the\nfound a cross-level interaction between neighborhood\nconcentrated poverty and individual victimization. The\neffect of individual-level victimization (with or without\nCI=1.8-9.0, respectively) on violent behavior was greater\nfor girls from neighborhoods which were better off (with\nor without homicides) while the effect of victimization\non violent behavior in neighborhoods with a 1-unit higher\nlevel of concentrated poverty was less strong and no longer\nstatistically significant, with or without homicides\nCOMMENT\nIn this study, adolescent girls were more likely to act vio-\nlently if they had previously experienced violent victim-\nization, and if they lived in impoverished and/or se-\nverely violent communities. Additionally, a cross-level\ninteraction was found indicating that, in neighbor-\nhoods that have less concentrated poverty, the effect of\nindividual-level victimization on violent behavior is even\nstronger. Further investigation into neighborhood char-\nacteristics is needed to explain this differential impact of\nvictimization.\nThese results highlight the critical role that violent vic-\ntimization plays in the development of aggression by girls.\nEven when socioeconomic status, previous violence per-\npetration, deviant peer behavior, illegal substance use,\nand other family and individual characteristics were con-\nsidered, violent victimization remained an important risk\nfactor for subsequent violent behavior by girls.\nIn the current sample of girls who were aged 9 through\n15 years at baseline and followed up for 7 years, violent\nbehavior peaked at the age of 14 years. Other studies of\ngirls' violence have shown that rates of the most serious\nself-reported violence by girls peaks about age 14 years\nand then decline, except for a highly aggressive sub-\nthe prevalence of girls' violent behavior between the base-\nTable 3.

This decline echos the\ndecrease noted in other assessments of youth violence\ning that violently victimized girls show higher levels of\nviolence across all age groups indicates a need for early\nintervention, as well as a possibility that early support\nfor girl survivors of violence would avert later aggres-\nsion.\nIn this study, victimization might have happened at\nhome, at school, or in neighborhoods. One could argue\nthat both victimization and perpetration could have been\nin the context of a single fight between youth. However,\nwe controlled for baseline factors that put youth in such\nrisky contexts, including illegal substance use, deviant\npeer behaviors, girls' own previous violent behavior, and\nneighborhood-level concentrated poverty. With these con-\ntrolled, the effects of prior victimization on girls' perpe-\ntration of violence persisted over time, independent of\nbeing in a peer group with norms of fighting and other\nrisky behaviors.\nStudies of the relationship between sexual assault and\nsubsequent violent behavior are scarce in the literature;\nonly 2 previous studies with related findings were iden-\ntified,46,47 both using cross-sectional, individual-level data.\nOne analyzed 1995 National College Health Risk Behav-\nior Survey data and found that lifetime forced sexual in-\ntercourse among girls was associated with over twice the\nTable 4.

Unfortunately, because\nof the low prevalence of past-year reported sexual as-\nsault among this sample of girls, we had to combine it\nwith other types of victimization, rather than evaluate this\nrelationship separately.\nIn addition to suggesting the potential importance of\nearly interventions for victimized children and adoles-\ncents, results of the current inquiry suggest that a much\nstronger emphasis on safety for children in their neigh-\nborhoods, schools, and families would yield the largest\nreduction in youth violence. To restrict the focus to in-\ndividual interventions alone will leave those in unsafe set-\ntings with correspondingly poor outcomes.\nLimitations\nThis study relied primarily on girls' self-reports. These\nmay have been subject to social desirability bias if girls\nexaggerated aggressive behaviors or were reluctant to dis-\nclose victimization experiences, especially sexual as-\nsault. With the longitudinal design, we also had missing\ndata that resulted in the deletion of respondents from the\nanalysis. This may have resulted in the introduction of\nadditional bias since removed subjects were more likely\nto report deviant peers, less likely to have married care-\ngivers, and more likely to have a higher rate of baseline\nviolence. Additionally, the steep decline in perpetration\nof violence across the 3 waves of data resulted in a low\nprevalence of the outcome, which may have affected sta-\ntistical power to detect associations prospectively.48 For\nexample, we expected to see an association between par-\nent-to-child physical aggression49 and subsequent vio-\nlent behavior, but this was the case only at baseline. Fi-\nnally, although the propensity score analysis allowed us\nto account for many potential confounders, there is a pos-\nsibility that there were unmeasured confounders that were\nnot included in the analysis.\nStrengths\nA major strength of this study is its multilevel, longitu-\ndinal design. Prospective designs are particularly impor-\ntant in assessing exposures to or experiences with vio-\nlence across multiple settings, especially when studying\nadolescence, a time of so many developmental changes.\nThe focus on perpetration by girls also is significant, given\nthe relatively scant literature on the origin of girls' ag-\ngression using population-based samples. Finally, we used\nmultilevel methods to evaluate the independent contri-\nbution of neighborhood effects on girls' violence, includ-\ning their interactions with individual exposure to vio-\nlent victimization.\nKnowledge of mechanisms by which victimization and\nexposure to neighborhood violence affects perpetration\nby youth is as yet unrefined. Turner and Lloyd,50 dis-\ncussing their findings on the effects of multiple traumas\nfor a child, suggest that one mechanism may be impair-\nment of the development of coping skills to deal with\nstressors. Some theorists posit a social learning model in\nwhich adolescents learn from others that violent behav-\nior is normative51,52; others offer biosocial explanations\nfor the development of youth violence.3\nCurrent youth violence prevention efforts focus pri-\nmarily on intervention at the individual level: counsel-\ning for children or teens who demonstrate problems, pun-\nishment for children as individuals, attributions of adult\nintentions or characteristics to children, and applica-\ntion of adult remedies. In contrast, successful interven-\ntions, to the extent that they have been evaluated, in-\nclude multilevel interventions integrating family, school,\nand community-level efforts.53 Our results suggest that\na continued emphasis on individual-based remedies or\npenalties will be unsuccessful unless additional efforts\nare undertaken to reduce childhood victimization and im-\nprove the conditions in which many urban girls live.\nCorrespondence: Beth E.
