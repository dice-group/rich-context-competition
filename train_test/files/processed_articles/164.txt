In particular, it is supposed that transfer pricing of intrafirm trade\nconstitutes an important channel for companies to shift taxable profits between jurisdic-\ntions. While taxable profits of affiliated companies are determined by separate accounting,\nit is often impossible to determine a true intrafirm transfer price since economies of in-\ntegration are special characteristics of affiliated companies. Therefore, it is reasonable\nthat multinationals have a range of opportunities to set tax-optimal transfer-prices, even\nthough transfer prices are audited according to the arm's length principle. This would\nimply internal management distortions for companies and tax revenue consequences for\ncountries.\nThis paper investigates whether transfer pricing of intrafirm sales within multinationals\nrepresents an important channel of company tax planning. A simple theoretical model,\nconsidering transfer pricing of intrafirm sales of a multinational company, is used to obtain\nempirical implications. The theoretical analysis suggests a negative effect of the local tax\nrate on transfer prices and the size of intrafirm sales.\nThe empirical analysis considers directly the supposed tax response of balance sheet items\nreflecting intrafirm sales. Micro-level panel data of German affiliates in 31 countries during\nthe period from 1996 until 2003 are employed, which are taken from the MiDi database\nprovided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. The empirical results show that the size of balance\nsheet items, which reflect intrafirm sales, decrease with an increasing local tax rate. Thus,\nit can be confirmed that profit shifting by means of transfer pricing of intrafirm sales\nworks effectively. The magnitude of estimated tax responses suggests that transfer pricing\nconstitutes an important channel of tax planning despite anti-avoidance legislations and\ntax audits based on the arm's length principle.\nTransfer Pricing of Intrafirm Sales as a Profit Shifting\nChannel \u00ad Evidence from German Firm Data\nMichael Overesch\n(ZEW)  \n Keywords: Taxation, Multinationals, Profit Shifting, Transfer Pricing, Firm-level Data\nAddress: Centre for European Economic\nResearch (ZEW)\nGermany\nPhone:\nFax:\nE-mail:\noveresch@zew.de\nThe author is grateful to the Deutsche Bundesbank for granting access to the MiDi database, and to\nThiess Buettner and Ulrich Schreiber for helpful comments on an earlier draft.

It is often assumed that profit shifting\nvia transfer pricing of intrafirm trading constitutes an important way for companies to\ndesign tax-optimal real investments. A basic principle in taxation of affiliated companies\nlocated in different countries is to determine their taxable profits by separate account-\ning. Transfer pricing of company-internal trade is usually controlled by the `arm's length\nprinciple'. However, since economies of integration are special characteristics of affiliated\ncompanies, it is often impossible to calculate a true intrafirm transfer price. Hence, multi-\nnationals should have a range of opportunities to set tax-optimal transfer prices. This\nwould imply distortions of companies' internal management decisions based on transfer\nprices. Moreover, this would also have tax revenue consequences for countries.\nWhile extended surveys on empirical evidence of companies' behavioral response to taxa-\ntion are provided e.g. by Hines (1999) and Devereux (2006), let us briefly look at previous\nstudies, which in particular analyse empirically tax planning via transfer pricing. Empir-\nical investigations often attempt to confirm indirectly that profit shifting with regard to\ntransfer pricing works effectively. Typically, reported profits are used as the dependent\nvariable. Grubert and Mutti (1991) as well as Hines and Rice (1994), for example, find\na negative relationship between reported profits and the local tax level of US outbound\nFDI. These results are confirmed by Huizinga and Laeven (2005) for European companies\nand by Weichenrieder (2006) for German FDI data. Although some studies such as Jacob\n(1996) considers intrafirm sales as an explaining variable, these results can be taken only\nas indirect hints that taxable profits are effectively shifted, e.g. by transfer pricing.\nHowever, a more precise identification of transfer pricing as a specific profit shifting channel\nis feasible by focusing directly on intrafirm deliveries. Then, problematic aspects of indirect\ninvestigation approaches, which may arise, for example, from competing profit shifting\nactivities such as financing, can be avoided. Up to now only a few studies, which are\nmostly based on US data, focus directly on data of goods traded. Swenson (2001) finds a\nsmall tax response of transfer prices by using product-level trade price data of US imports.\nSimilarly, Clausing (2003) finds, based on product-level price data, that prices of intrafirm\ntrade respond to tax levels, whereas prices of open-market operations are not affected by\ndifferent tax levels. Furthermore, a few studies use company data of intrafirm transactions.\nBy using aggregated firm data, Clausing (2001, 2006) confirms an impact of taxes on\nintrafirm trade flows between US firms and their affiliates. Grubert (2003) shows, based\non a cross-section analysis of US Treasury data, that the ratio of intrafirm transactions to\ntotal sales of US controlled foreign companies is influenced by taxes.\nThis paper aims to provide additional insights into the tax response of intrafirm sales.\nThe empirical approach focuses directly on balance sheet items reflecting intrafirm sales.\nThe analysis is based on the MiDi database, a comprehensive micro-level panel database\nof virtually all German multinationals, made available for research by the Deutsche Bun-\ndesbank. Under German tax law repatriated profits are almost completely tax exempt.\nThus, taxation of the foreign affiliate is decisive for profit shifting. In fact, a significant\nimpact of tax rates on multinational profit shifting activities, by means of intrafirm sales, is\nconfirmed by the following analysis. It can be shown that the size of balance sheet items,\nwhich reflect intrafirm sales, decreases with an increasing local tax rate. These results\nsuggest that transfer pricing represents a relevant channel of tax planning.\nThe paper is structured as follows; in section 2, a theoretical model considers profit shifting\ndecisions of a multinational corporation, from which empirical implications are derived. In\nsections 3 and 4, a description of the empirical investigation approach follows as well as a\npresentation of the data used. Thereafter, in section 5, the implication that intrafirm sales\nare responsive to tax rates is tested empirically. Finally, section 6 concludes.\n2 The Model\nThe impact of transfer prices on after-tax profits can be described by a simple company\nmodel with only two locations, where the parent company is denoted by 1 and the controlled\naffiliate by 2. The company's profits are determined by output\n) ,\nwhereas k1\nare investments at the two locations. Opportunity costs of capital are\n) .\nFurthermore, the company trades one product between its affiliates. Extending a model\nused in Haufler and Schjelderup (2000), it is considered that intrafirm sales are related\nto the amount of invested capital. Moreover, the company can also choose the quantity\nof intrafirm deliveries per invested capital. The quantity of intrafirm sales per invested\ncapital, kj\n, is denoted by xj\n. Thus, the quantity x1\nper invested capital k1\nis supplied to\nthe affiliate by the parent company 1, and x2\nper invested capital k2\nis supplied to the\nparent company by the affiliate 2, respectively.\nHowever, optimal economic levels of intrafirm trade, denoted by xj\n, are considered by\nthe production functions. Furthermore, as transfer prices are used as an instrument of\na non-central coordination and incentive system between affiliates (e.g. Hirshleifer, 1957;\nSchjelderup and S\u0159rgard, 1997; Baldenius et al., 2004), the prices of the internally delivered\ngoods, which are optimal for decentral coordination before taxes, are assumed as pj\nWith regard to the apportionment of the company's output before taxes, these optimal\ncoordination prices are assumed. Regularly these prices are unobservable for tax authorities\n1In principle, in the case of an integrated production, calculating an economically `true' arm's length\nprice must fail. Nevertheless, internal price setting is used as a non-central coordination system.\nand are approximated by an arm's length price. However, if profits are taxed, the actual\nsettlement prices of company-internal trading might be different and are denoted by p1\nApart from taxes and transaction costs, the total company profit is not affected by the\namount of intrafirm sales per invested capital, pj\nxj\n. However, for tax purposes company-\ninternal trade has to be settled in separate accounts according to the arm's length principle.\nThen, the following deviation from profits before taxes can be obtained,\n,\nwhere the statutory tax rate at the location of the parent is denoted by t1\nand at the affil-\niate's location by t2\n.3 Obviously, a tax rate difference between both locations indicates an\nincentive to optimise intrafirm sales. As the price pj\nis typically not visible to tax authori-\nties, the settlement of the actual price pj\nconstitutes a degree of freedom for multinationals.\nNevertheless, it is reasonable that the probability of punishment, tax advisory costs and\neconomic inefficiencies rise at an increasing deviation from pj\n. Especially the economic\ninefficiencies seem to be very important, since transfer prices and intrafirm markets are\ntypically used as instruments of a non-central coordination and incentive system. These\ncosts are considered by a cost function, denoted by cj\n(pj\n). A deviation above or below\nthe optimal coordination price before taxes, pj\n, raises these costs. Hence, the following\nproperties are assumed\ncj\n(pj\n) = cj,p\n(pj\n) = 0, sign[cj,p\n(pj\n)] = sign[pj\n- pj\n],\nj\nFinally, a multinational company can boost a profit shift by increasing the quantity of\ncompany-internal trade per invested capital, xj\n. However, a deviation from the optimal\n2Prices differ from the optimal coordination price when companies use only one set of books for both\ntax and management purposes. An international study provided by Ernst & Young (2001), for example,\nreports that 77 percent of 638 multinationals use the same transfer price for both purposes.\n3Statutory tax rates are the relevant tax measures, since different determination of the tax base such\nas a depreciation method has no effect on shifted profits.\neconomical level of company-internal trading per invested capital, apart from tax effects,\nwill cause additional costs of company-internal trade, e.g. production inefficiencies or inef-\nficiencies caused by a crowding out of open market input by intrafirm products (Grubert,\n2003). Hence, the following properties of these additional costs, ej\n(xj\n), are assumed\nej\n(xj\n) = ej,x\n(xj\n) = 0, sign[ej,x\n(xj\n)] = sign[xj\n- xj\n],\nj\nTogether, the following profit function can be obtained\n)\nObviously, company-internal trading effects direct profit shifting from the receiving affiliate\nto the supplying affiliate or vice versa.4 Therefore, it can be expected that intrafirm sales,\npj\nxj\n, are responsive to bilateral tax rate differences. Thus, for setting the optimum price,\nsay by the controlled affiliate 2, the following first-order condition can be obtained,\n) !\nAdditionally, for the optimum quantity of company-internal trade of affiliate 2, we obtain\n) !\nConsidering the characteristics of both cost functions, the optimal price settled, p2\n, in-\ncreases with an increasing tax rate difference, (t1\n). For instance, if the tax rate\ndifference (t1\n) is positive, the actual price p2\nshould settle above p2\n. This effect can\nbe extended by increasing quantities of company-internal trade in the case of a positive\n4The model specification assumes an exemption system for the repatriation of foreign dividends, i.e.\nthe tax level of the affiliate is final. This is correct considering German outbound FDI data which are used\nfor the following empirical analysis. Germany taxes only 5% of repatriated profits.\nas well as a negative tax rate difference. The following comparative static analysis makes\nthese points clearer. The comparative static properties are derived by differentiating the\nfirst-order conditions. Then, we get\nIn equation (5) the term [(t1\n)] is zero, when the price is tax-optimally settled\nand condition (2) is considered.5 Then, the marginal effects of increasing tax rates on the\noptimal transfer price settled by affiliate 2 are\n= -\n)\n= -\nEquation (6) shows that the optimal transfer price of deliveries to the parent 1 carried out\nby affiliate 2 decreases with an increasing tax rate of the affiliate 2. Equation (6) also shows\nthe opposite effect of an increasing tax rate of the parent 1. The optimal transfer price\nof the affiliate's deliveries increases with an increasing tax rate at the parent's location.\nThus, the optimal transfer price increases with an increasing tax rate difference (t1\n).\nWith regard to the marginal effects of increasing tax rates on the optimal trading quantity\nsupplied by the affiliate 2, we obtain\n= -\n)\n= -\nWith regard to (7), two cases must be distinguished.

Simultaneously, the effect of an increasing tax rate, t1\n, at the parent\ncompany is positive. Thus, if the tax rate difference (t1\n) is positive, the optimal\n5However, it can be shown that the comparative static effects also hold in more general cases.\nquantities supplied to the parent company 1, by affiliate 2, decreases with higher tax rates\nat the affiliate's location, and increases with higher tax rates at the parent's location.\nOn the other hand, if the tax rate of the parent is lower than the affiliate's tax rate, i.e.\n) < 0, the effects are vice versa. This means that the quantities supplied to the\nparent company decrease with a higher tax rate of the parent company and increase with\na higher tax rate of the affiliate. The intuition is that the optimal quantity of company-\ninternal trading always increases if the tax rate difference in absolute values increases.\nThe total effect on intrafirm sales per invested capital, pj\nxj\n, which consists of a quantity\neffect and a price effect, is only unambiguous if the tax rate of the receiving company\nis the higher rate of the two. Otherwise, the total effect might be ambiguous since the\nsituation offers an incentive to not only underprice intrafirm trade, but also to boost\nquantities. Although it is reasonable that tax authorities can better control transfer prices\nthan the choice of internally delivered quantities (Grubert, 2003), there are some good\nreasons for pricing dominance in practice. First, increasing quantities is then, and only\nthen, useful if underpricing already exists. Secondly, every underpricing constitutes a basic\neffect on all company-internal trading, which would be carried out despite any additional\nintrafirm deliveries due to tax planning. These basic intrafirm deliveries are also affected\nby tax optimal price setting. Finally, pricing might often be easier than changing trade\nquantities. Particularly when intermediate goods are traded, the quantities are determined\nby the company's production structure and should be fairly fixed.\nOverall, expecting a positive response of intrafirm sales on increasing tax rate differences\nseems to be reasonable. However, the expected response might be biased to a certain\nextent, due to increasing quantities, in cases where the tax rate of the receiving company\nis below the supplier's tax rate. If the opposite effect of extended quantities is dominated\nby the pricing effect, an increasing tax rate at the supplying affiliate's location should\nlead to decreasing intrafirm sales as well. Therefore, in accordance with equation (6) the\nfollowing proposition can be empirically tested:\nProposition: If transfer prices are tax driven, intrafirm sales will decrease with an increas-\ning statutory tax rate at the supplying affiliate's location and increase with an increasing\nstatutory tax rate at the receiving affiliate's location.\n3 Investigation Approach\nThe proposition presented above provides a testable relationship between intrafirm sales\nand tax rates. It can be tested empirically using firm-level financial statements of German\noutbound FDI. For the empirical analysis, the MiDi database for multinationals, provided\nby the Deutsche Bundesbank, is used. This database contains financial statements of\nGerman FDI as well as additional information about the parent company.\nintrafirm trade. The data-set used for the empirical analysis does not contain complete\ninformation on intrafirm sales of German foreign affiliates. However, due to the fact that\ntransactions are entered in financial accounting on the delivery date and not on the payment\ndate, the balance sheet items `accounts receivable from affiliated companies' denoted by\nARA as well as `accounts receivable from parent company' denoted by ARP can be used\ninstead. These items are available in the data-base. They reflect the shares of intrafirm\nsales carried out with other affiliates and the parent company, respectively, which are\nunpaid at the balance sheet date.6 Thus, these balance sheet items represent a snapshot of\nthe annual internal turnover, i.e. the unpaid share of intrafirm sales at the balance sheet\n6Let us consider, for example, intrafirm deliveries of intermediate goods priced at e100 to the parent\ncompany, by affiliate 2, in November 2002, while the payment date by the parent company was in February\n2003. Then, these intrafirm sales constitute `accounts receivable from parent company' of e100 at the\ndate. The relationship between intrafirm sales and its unpaid share at the balance sheet\ndate depends on local costs of refinancing outstanding bills as well as on firm specifics\nsuch as a specific cash management system. A country specific lending rate constitutes a\ngood proxy for local refinancing costs, whereas company specifics can be controlled by a\ncompany fixed effect. However, it should be emphasized that the payment date of accounts\nreceivable is irrelevant for tax purposes, as profits or losses are entered on the delivery date\nand not on the payment date.7\nA first set of estimations can be carried out, considering `accounts receivable from affiliated\ncompanies', ARA, by means of the following equation\nln(ARAj,k,l,t\nSTRj,t\n)\n+ k\n+ l\n+ t\n+ j,k,l,t\nwhere j denotes the affiliate, k the parent and t\na time specific effect. The statutory tax\nrate of the affiliate is denoted by STRj,t\n. However, the size of intrafirm sales also depends\non real economic factors, since it is based on delivered goods and services. Therefore, a\ncompany effect k\nand an industry effect l\nare considered to control for unobservable\nheterogeneity between different company groups and industries. Moreover, in accordance\nwith the theoretical model, the size of the affiliate's business activity is controlled for by\nintroducing the affiliate's total invested capital, denoted by CAPITAL. However, the affili-\nate's total capital may be endogenous, since the analysed profit shifting opportunities may\naffect the size of the affiliate's business activity. For this reason, instrument variable (IV)\nestimations are carried out. At the first stage ln(CAPITAL) is regressed on all exogenous\nvariables and the natural log of the affiliate country's GDP. Typically, GDP indicates the\nsize of the local market. Hence, the correlation between invested capital and GDP orig-\n7A company may use the implicit interest-free credit of accounts receivable for tax planning by increasing\npayment periods with an increasing tax rate (Bernard and Weiner, 1990). Then, the expected adverse\neffect of higher local taxes on `accounts receivables from affiliated companies' due to tax-optimal transfer\npricing will be underestimated to some extent.\ninates from sales opportunities to third parties. On the other hand, intrafirm deliveries\nshould not be affected by the local market size, in which the affiliate is located. Thus, the\nnatural log of GDP of the affiliate's country constitutes a suitable instrument.\nIn a second set of regressions, the subitem `accounts receivable from the parent company'\nis considered in order to analyse transfer pricing of intrafirm sales carried out with the own\nparent company. Then, the specific bilateral tax rate differences are observable. Moreover,\ninformation about the bilateral distance between the affiliate's country and the parent's\ncountry, i.e. Germany, are available. Hence, the following estimation equation is used\nln(ARPj,k,l,t\n(STRk,t\n-STRj,t\n)\n) + k\n+ l\n+ t\n+ j,k,l,t\nSince ln(CAPITAL) may be endogenous, IV estimations are carried out, where ln(GDP)\nis used as an instrument variable. With regard to the tax effects, a negative sign of 1\nand\na positive sign of 1\nis expected according to our proposition.\n4 Data and Descriptive Statistics\nThe empirical analysis uses the MiDi database for multinationals provided by the Deutsche\nBundesbank. This is a comprehensive annual micro database of direct investment positions\nof German enterprises held abroad as well as direct investment positions held in Germany\nby foreign companies. However, this analysis is based only on data of German outbound\nFDI positions. The data provides annual information about the balance sheet of each\ninvestment object, including further information on the type of investment and on the\ninvestor.8 A favourable characteristic of the data set is the opportunity to trace direct\n8See Lipponer (2006) for a detailed description of the data set.\nDestination Number CAPITAL Accounts Number CAPITAL Accounts\n(Mean, Receivable (Mean, Receivable\nEstonia - - - - - -\nMalta - - - - - -\n Not reported because of data protection since the number of observations is below 10.\ninvestment positions of individual firms over time. The panel data structure and the\nability to identify all foreign affiliates belonging to a specific multinational company make\nit possible to control for heterogeneity across companies. The collection of the data is\nenforced by German law, which determines reporting mandates for certain international\ntransactions and positions.9 The version used provides firm-level panel data for the period\nof 1996 to 2003. Since the model deals with an enterprise optimising intrafirm sales between\neach affiliate, only observations displaying a participation level above 50 per cent are taken\ninto account. The reported figures are based on a sample of firm observations which display\npositive real capital and turnover for every reported year. Furthermore, due to the fact\nthat the underlying model deals with a simple two-tier company structure of a firm which\nactually produces at home and abroad, indirectly held investments as well as holdings and\nfinancial service providers are excluded.10 Table 1 presents the spatial apportionment of\nAccording to equations (8) and (9), the natural log of firm-level `accounts receivable from\naffiliates' as well as `accounts receivable from the parent company' are kept as dependent\nvariables. Moreover, total capital (CAPITAL) and total turnover (TURNOVER) of each\naffiliate are taken from the MiDi database. As unpaid dividends and interest of financial\nassets may cause higher accounts receivable, a dummy variable DFIN is used. This DFIN\nrepresents financial interests in affiliated companies, having the value one, while otherwise\nzero. It is reasonable to assume that the opportunity to plan tax-optimal intrafirm sales\nis higher if an affiliate is wholly owned compared to quoted share holdings (Kant, 1990).\nTherefore, a dummy variable DWO is used, which has the value one if the affiliate is wholly\n9Sec. 26 Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz (Law on Foreign Trade and Payments) in connection with Aussen-\nwirtschaftsverordnung (Foreign Trade and Payment Regulations).

Since 2002, FDI has to be reported, if the participation is 10% or more and\nthe balance sheet total of the foreign object is above 3 million Euro. Though previous years showed lower\nthreshold levels, this threshold level is uniformly applied for all years in the panel.\n10Surprisingly at first sight, a neighbouring country like Luxembourg captures only a small share of\nGerman FDI observations. Given the fact that companies are excluded which likely do not produce goods,\ni.e. holdings or financial service providers, this is very reasonable.\nTable 2: Descriptive Statistics\nVariable Definition Mean Std.Dev.

While using these two statutory tax rates, bilateral\ntax rate differences are constructed. The statutory tax rate is the relevant tax measure if\nan affiliate does not exhibit any loss carry forward or any current losses. For this reason\nthe dummy variable DLCF is used as an indicator for the possibility to offset former losses\nwith actual profits for tax purposes taking on the value one, while otherwise zero.\n11An average level of the local German trade income tax (Gewerbesteuer) is considered.\nThe country specific lending rate (LENDING RATE) is used as an appropriate proxy of\nrefinancing costs in order to control impacts of different payment policies. Additionally,\na variable DISTANCE is used, containing the average flight distance between Germany\nand the affiliate's country. Finally, the affiliate's country GDP is used. Table 2 presents\ndescriptive statistics of the data used for the samples. Included are 26,786 German out-\nbound observations exhibiting 'accounts receivable from affiliated companies' and 10,991\nobservations exhibiting 'accounts receivable from parent company', which are located in\n5 Regression Results\nThe tax impact on intrafirm sales is analysed using German outbound FDI data. Empirical\nanalysis is based on the estimation equations (8) and (9). First, the natural log of `accounts\nreceivable from affiliated companies' is used as a dependent variable. Further analyses are\nfocused on the subitem `accounts receivable from parent company' in order to provide\nadditional insights.\nA first set of results is presented in table 3, where the natural log of `accounts receivable\nfrom affiliated companies' is used as the dependent variable. According to the theoretical\nmodel, all specifications presented in table 3 indicate a significant negative impact of a\nhigher tax rate at the affiliate's location on `accounts receivable from affiliates'. This result\ncan be interpreted as a negative impact of a higher tax rate on intrafirm sales since the\nitem `accounts receivable from affiliates' constitutes a snapshot of annual intrafirm sales.\nSince different local lending rates reflect different incentives to pay internal bills, a negative\neffect of a higher local lending rate on unpaid accounts receivable, at the balance sheet\nTable 3: Transfer Pricing of Intrafirm Sales\nDependent Variable Natural log of accounts receivable from affiliates\nAll regressions are IV estimations.

There are 26,786 observations.\ndate, confirms the theoretical expectations. The higher local costs of refinancing are, the\nfaster accounts receivable are paid by an affiliated company. However, since intrafirm sales\nare based on delivered goods and services, the amount of internal turnover depends on\nreal economic issues. For this reason, unobservable heterogeneity of the company group is\ncontrolled for by firm and industry fixed effects. Finally, in accordance with our assumption\nthat the size of intrafirm sales is related to the size of invested capital, the natural log of\ninvested capital is considered. It is confirmed that business activity exhibiting higher total\ncapital is associated with higher intrafirm sales.\nThe specifications (2)-(5) of table 3 provide deeper insights into the tax effects on in-\ntrafirm sales. First, companies that hold shares of affiliates or give loans to them might\nhave higher `accounts receivable from affiliates' at the balance sheet date, resulting from\nunpaid dividends or interest. Therefore, the regressions presented in columns (2) and (5)\nof table 3 are carried out, including a dummy variable DFIN as well as an interaction of\nthis dummy with the tax rate difference. Affiliates, which have financial interests in affil-\niated companies such as shareholding or giving credit, exhibit less tax sensitivity of their\n`accounts receivable from affiliates'.12 Secondly, a dummy DLCF is introduced that indi-\ncates if affiliates carry forward losses. Then the effective tax burden of marginal additional\nprofit amounts to zero, i.e. these cases shape a suitable control group. This expectation\nis confirmed by specifications (3) and (5), which indicate significantly less tax sensitivity\nof `accounts receivable from affiliates' in cases where an affiliate exhibits a loss carryfor-\nward. These results are in line with MacKie-Mason (1990), who finds significantly less\ntax planning sensitivity of US firms by means of financing in the case of companies suf-\nfering losses. Thirdly, a dummy variable DWO is introduced indicating affiliates that are\nwholly owned by a German parent company. With additional minority shareholders, tax\nplanning, by means of company-internal profit shifting, is limited by a conflict of interest\nwith outside shareholders. Thus, it might be reasonable to assume that profit shifting\nworks better, if an affiliate is wholly owned by one parent company. Moreover, in ac-\ncordance with Kant (1990) it can be expected that affiliates, which are not wholly-owned,\nexhibit higher intrafirm sales, since dominant shareholders have an incentive to shift profits\ninto its wholly-owned affiliates. However, both expectations cannot be confirmed by our\nregressions considering `accounts receivable from affiliates'.\n12In particular, inter-corporate dividends are often tax exempt.\nThe semi-elasticities indicated by the tax coefficients is interpreted as follows: Specification\n(5), presented in table 3, indicates a 3.38 per cent smaller `accounts receivable from affiliated\ncompanies' in the case of affiliates without a loss carryforward and financial interests in\naffiliated companies, if the tax rate is increased by one percentage point. In the case of\naffiliates that exhibit a loss carryforward, the total effect of one percentage point higher\ntax rates on `accounts receivable from affiliates' comes down to 1.2 per cent. An additional\nset of results presented in table 5 in the appendix shows that the results are also very\nrobust if the affiliate's total turnover is used as an alternative measure for the size of the\nbusiness activity.\nFurthermore, the tax impact on intrafirm sales can be analysed considering only 'accounts\nreceivable from German parent company' as the dependent variable. In contrast to the\nformer set of analyses, a bilateral tax rate difference can be considered. The IV regression\nresults presented in table 4 are based on equation (9). According to the theoretical model,\nthe basic specification presented in column (1) of table 4 indicates a significantly positive\nimpact of a higher tax rate difference between Germany and the affiliate's location on\n`accounts receivable from parent company'. Since accounts receivable due from intrafirm\ndeliveries constitute a snapshot of the annual intrafirm sales, this result also indicates a\nsignificant impact of the tax rate difference on intrafirm sales.\nConsidering the control variables used in these regressions, the results match theoretical\nexpectations. The negative effect of a higher local lending rate on unpaid accounts receiv-\nable, at the balance sheet date, confirms the theoretical expectations of payment policy.\nBusiness activities exhibiting higher total capital are associated with higher intrafirm sales.\nAdditionally, since only one bilateral supply chain is considered, the distance of deliveries\nis observable. Therefore, the flight distance between Germany and the affiliate's location\nis introduced in order to control for an additional aspect determining intrafirm deliveries\nof goods and services. Theoretical expectations are confirmed by a significantly negative\neffect of a higher distance on affiliate's `accounts receivable from parent company'.\nTable 4: Transfer Pricing of Intrafirm Sales with Parent Company\nDependent Variable Natural log of accounts receivable from German parent\nAll regressions are IV estimations. At the first stage ln(CAPITAL) is regressed on all exogenous\nvariables and ln(GDP). Only second stage regression results are presented. F-tests of the sig-\nnificance of the first stage specifications are all significant at 1% level. Standard errors are in\nparentheses, which are clustered within 222 year-country cells and robust against random firm-\nspecific and country effects using the Huber-White sandwich formula. A star denotes significance\nat the 5% level and two stars at the 1% level. All estimates include a full set of 1,383 firm, 46\nindustry and time fixed effects. There are 10,991 observations.\nSimilar to the first set of results presented in table 3, additional specifications (2)-(5) are\npresented in table 4, which can provide deeper insights into tax effects on intrafirm sales\ncarried out with the parent company. The dummy variables, which indicate financial in-\nterests in affiliated companies, a loss carryforward, as well as complete ownership by a\nGerman parent, are the same as used in the former set of regressions presented in table\n3. In contrast to the former results, a different tax sensitivity with respect to `accounts\nreceivable from parent company' cannot be confirmed by columns (2) and (5) in cases in\nwhich affiliates have financial interests in affiliated companies. This suggests that in prac-\ntice having financial interests within the parent company might be less relevant compared\nto financial interests in other affiliated companies. With regard to exhibiting a loss carry-\nforward, the estimations in columns (3) and (5) of table 4 confirm that an affiliate, which\ncan offset actual profits with former losses, has an opposite tax incentive to manipulate\nintrafirm sales. Furthermore, the results in columns (4) and (5) confirm that profit shifting\nworks better if an affiliate is wholly owned by one parent. The positive impact of the inter-\naction between the tax rate difference and the dummy indicating wholly-owned affiliates\nis significant, whereas the tax effect considering all affiliates becomes insignificant. This\nresult is in line with Desai, Foley and Hines (2004), who find that wholly-owned affiliates\nare more responsive to tax planning incentives.\nThe semi-elasticity indicated by the tax rate difference can be interpreted as follows: Spec-\nification (5) presented in table 4 indicates a 2.37 per cent higher `accounts receivable from\nparent company' of wholly owned affiliates without exhibiting any loss carryforward, if\nthe tax rate difference is increased by one percentage point. The results are very robust\nconsidering alternative specifications presented in table 6 in the appendix. In compari-\nson to the semi-elasticities, estimated using the item 'accounts receivable from affiliated\ncompanies', the tax response is also very similar. Moreover, in comparison to results of\nprevious studies based on US data, the magnitudes of our estimated tax response are quite\nsimilar. For example, Clausing (2006) reports a tax response of the intrafirm trade balance\nof approximately - 1.3 with regard to an one percentage point higher tax rate. A similar\nspecification, presented in column (1) of table 3, indicates a similar tax semi-elasticity of\nintrafirm sales of about - 1.45. However, a higher semi-elasticity of about - 3.38 is estimated\nwhen considering only affiliates without a loss carryforward.\n6 Conclusion\nBy using the presented investigational approach, which focuses directly on balance sheet\nitems reflecting intrafirm sales, it can be confirmed that transfer pricing of intrafirm sales\nrepresents a relevant channel to shift profits. The regression results clearly confirm the\nexpected impact of the tax rate on the size of `accounts receivable from affiliated compa-\nnies', as well as on `accounts receivable from parent company', and thus on intrafirm sales.\nWhen interpreting the empirical results, it should be emphasized that it is not possible\nto identify the magnitude of the transfer pricing effect against the quantity effect. How-\never, the estimated response of `accounts receivable from affiliated companies' indicates\nthat tax optimal transfer pricing is possible. That means shifting works effectively despite\nanti-avoidance legislations and tax audits based on the arm's length principle. Thus, the\nresults suggest that multinationals can evade taxation in high tax countries for the benefit\nof locations offering lower tax rates.\nCosidering for example column (5) in table 3, the estimated total semi-elasticity of intrafirm\nsales with regard to a smaller tax rate at the supplying affiliate is - 3.38. This suggests\nthat the transfer price response with regard to an one percentage point smaller tax rate\nmight be more than one. Thus, reducing statutory tax rate differences seems to remain a\npromising strategy for countries trying to attract tax bases. Nevertheless, be aware that\nthese can only be rough estimates, since it is impossible to identify the magnitude of the\ntransfer pricing effect against the quantity effect, which in turn does not constitute a direct\neffect on taxable profits. Only the response of the transfer price with regard to the tax rate\nconstitutes directly an equal effect on reported taxable profits at the respective affiliate.\nHowever, the results are quite similar in comparison to results of previous studies based\non US data.\nFor companies, the tax impact on transfer prices is related with distortions due to ineffi-\nciencies from misleading decentralized coordination. Furthermore, from a theoretical point\nof view, the evidence on cross-country profit shifting activities suggests that multination-\nals have enhanced opportunities compared to purely national firms. Nevertheless, further\nempirical research seems to be useful to analyse the effects of profit shifting opportunities\non companies' investment decisions. Finally, the provided evidence on transfer pricing of\nintrafirm sales as one relevant channel of profit shifting might be useful for further research\nconsidering the European tax competition process.\nDatasources and Definitions\nFirm-level data are taken from the MiDi dataset of the Bundesbank, see Lipponer (2006)\nfor an overview.\nDistance is taken from \"http://www.etn.nl/distance.htm\".
