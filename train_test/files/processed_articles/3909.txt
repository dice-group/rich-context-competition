Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and\nacute coronary syndromes (ACSs) comprise the largest\nportion of cardiovascular diseases.1,2 Epidemiological\nstudies have confirmed that age, smoking, diabetes, dys-\nlipidaemia, hypertension, obesity and gender are inde-\npendent risk factors for atherosclerosis.3,4 The early\ndetection of patients having a high risk of ACSs is a prior-\nity.

Also, great attention has been\ndevoted to the evaluation of genetic variation of certain\nenzymatic systems, as a potential risk factor in the devel-\nopment of different ACS types. The renin\u00adangiotensin\u00ad\naldosterone system (RAAS) and the matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in the\npathogenesis of ACSs and the genetic polymorphism of\nenzymes of RAAS and various MMPs may affect the\noccurrence ofACSs.7\u00ad10 The activation of MMPand RAAS\ncomponents is also regulated by genetic predisposition.7,8\nThis suggests that individuals carrying a higher activity\nallele of the certain gene have increased concentrations of\nthe particular enzymes that play a crucial role in the ath-\nerosclerotic plaque instability and rupture, with conse-\nquent thrombus formation and the development of a\ngreater extent of myocardial damage.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate genetic poly-\nmorphisms of several MMPs and angiotensin-converting\nenzymes (ACEs) mostly expected to play a significant role\nin the pathogenesis of ACSs if hypothesising that the dif-\nferent pathogenesis of the two conditions could be under\nthe influence of the genotype along with traditional IHD\nrisk factors.\nStudy population and methods\nSubjects\nFive hundred and twenty-three patients with ACS (393\nwith STEMI and 130 with NSTEMI) were enrolled into\nthe study. All of them were admitted to the Department of\nCardiology of the Lithuanian University of Health\nunderwent coronary angiography, following percutaneous\nintervention of the culprit artery and conventional\nechocardiography.\nAcute myocardial infarction (AMI) was defined accord-\ning to the standard criteria based on clinical symptoms,\nECG findings and cardiac enzyme abnormalities.11 Family\nhistory, cardiovascular risk factors and current treatment\nwere obtained from each patient using a standard question-\nnaire. Hypertension was defined as the presence of ele-\nvated systolic ( 140 mmHg) and/or diastolic ( 90 mmHg)\nblood pressure or the current use of antihypertensive drugs.\nA patient was considered as a smoker if he was smoking at\nthe current time or had been a smoker in the past. Diabetes\nmellitus was identified when dietary treatment and/or\nmedical therapy was required to control blood glucose lev-\nels. Dyslipidaemia was defined as serum total cholesterol\nlevels of 5.2 mmol/L or more, low density cholesterol\nmore than 2.6 mmol/L, and/or triglycerides equal to or\nmore than 1.7 mmol/L or the use of statin medication.12\nThe control group consisted of 645 subjects free from\nsymptoms of IHD and stroke matching the study group\ndesign according to their age and gender. The control\ngroup consisted of subjects from a random sample of the\nKaunas population screened within the international\nHealth, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern\nEurope (HAPPIE) project, the Countrywide Integrated\nNon-communicable Disease Intervention (CINDI) pro-\nject and an international study, the Kaunas Healthy\nAgeing Study.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all the\npatients, and the study protocol was approved by the\nKaunas region ethics committee.\nGenetic analysis\nThe DNA was extracted from the venous blood of patients\nusing the Genomic DNA Purification Kit, according to the\nrecommendations of the manufacturer.

Patients with\nACS more frequently were smokers and more frequently\nhad arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipi-\ndaemia. Our study revealed that smoking, diabetes, dys-\nlipidaemia and arterial hypertension increase the risk of\nSTEMI development. However, diabetes mellitus has no\nassociations with NSTEMI development while smoking,\narterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia may be impor-\ntant in NSTEMI occurrence. The results of other research-\ners are quite contradictory. According to the data of\nMontalescot et al., patients with STEMI more frequently\nhad arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus than\npatients with NSTEMI while the patients with NSTEMI\nmore frequently were smokers.19 On the contrary, the\nresults of Di Stefano et al. demonstrated that patients\nwith STEMI more frequently have been smoking, and\narterial hypertension has been more frequent for those\nwho had NSTEMI.20 Research by Ino et al. did not reveal\nany differences in IHD risk factors between the STEMI\nand NSTEMI patients at all.21\nThe present study also demonstrated the differences in\nthe basic clinical and biochemical parameters between\nSTEMI and NSTEMI patients. Patients with STEMI had a\nhigher heart rate and white blood cell count, higher levels\nof troponin I and glucose, as well as more severe heart\ndysfunction assessed than in patients with NSTEMI. This\nindicates that a higher activity of inflammation, more\nextensive myocardial necrosis and disbalance of glucose\nmetabolism are more common in STEMI patients. Our\nresults confirm the data of other studies reporting that the\npathogenesis of STEMI is associated with a more active\ninflammation process and STEMI may lead to more\nextensive myocardial damage and necrosis.22\u00ad24 The\nresearch data of Di Stefano et al. demonstrated obvious\ndifferences in inflammation markers between patients\nwith STEMI and NSTEMI. Patients with STEMI had a\nhigher concentration of leukocytes and a higher activity\nof other markers of inflammation such as high sensitivity\nC-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and serum amyloid A.20\nThe patients with NSTEMI had a lower concentration of\nleukocytes, and other inflammation markers were not\nFurthermore, in STEMI patients a more severe distur-\nbance of glucose metabolism is present. According to our\ndata, patients with STEMI had a higher level of glycaemia\nas compared to patients with NSTEMI at baseline and\npatients with STEMI also more frequently had diabetes in\nthe past. Hyperglycaemia is a predictor of adverse out-\ncomes in STEMI patients25 as hyperglycaemia increases\nthe amount of free fatty acids which may reduce vasodila-\ntion of small blood vessels, stimulate leukocyte adhesion\nand increase procoagulant action of thrombocytes,26 and\nworsen myocardial perfusion and contractility.27\nOur results demonstrate that the concentration of tro-\nponin I at baseline is higher in STEMI patients than in\nNSTEMI patients. As we know, troponin I is the main\nmarker of necrosis and death of myocytes during AMI and\nits level is an important predictor of a bad prognosis after\nAMI.28 The results of other authors also show that a higher\nconcentration of troponin I is detected in STEMI patients.\nAn increased concentration of troponin I at the acute\nperiod of AMI not only reflects the size of the area of myo-\ncardial necrosis, but also demonstrates a higher probability\nof repeated ischaemic cardiac events and repeated hospi-\ntalisation because of ACS or a greater probability of\ndeath.29,30 According to the data of Di Stefano et al. the\ntroponin I concentration correlates with the level of\nC-reactive protein in patients with STEMI suggesting that\nactivation of the inflammatory system is closely related to\nthe size of necrotic area of myocardium after MI.20\nAccording to the pathophysiological mechanisms of\nSTEMI and NSTEMI that we ascribed earlier, we had a\nhypothesis that some genetic factors can also be important\nin the process of atherosclerosis and may cause the devel-\nopment of ACS. The results of our previous study con-\nfirmed that genetic polymorphism of the AGT gene is\nassociated with left ventricular remodelling after AMI,\nTable 5.

In in vivo studies, genetic polymorphism has an\ninfluence on the differential expression of MMPs.32 More\nthan a few polymorphisms of MMPs seem to be associ-\nated with atherosclerosis and the onset of AMI. The com-\nponents of the RAAS may also be important in ACS\ndevelopment as they have an influence on the function of\nthe endothelium disturbing the balance between vasodila-\ntion and vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II increases oxida-\ntive stress and apoptosis of the endothelial cells, affects\nthe migration of adhesion molecules, chemotactic and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines causing the formation of\nmyocardial fibrosis and production of extracellular\nmatrix. In certain conditions, angiotensin II can cause\nacute rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque and a hyper-\nthrombotic condition.33\u00ad35 Moreover, the elements of\nMMPs and RAAS systems interact and may influence the\nOur results demonstrate that 5A5A and 5A6A geno-\ntypes of MMP-3 are associated with STEMI development\nwhile they have no importance in NSTEMI development.\nThis may be explained by the higher enzymatic activity of\nthe 5A allele if compared to the 6A allele.38 Patients with a\nmore active genotype (5A5A or 5A6A) of MMP-3 have a\nhigher expression of MMP-3 in the serum and tissues,\nhave smaller atherosclerotic plaques with a small amount\nof connective tissue and a thin fibrous cap which is more\nfrequently prone to rupture.17,18 The results of other\nresearch confirm that MMP-3 5A5A genotype is important\nin AMI development,39\u00ad41 especially for people from the\nAsian population. However, the value of the 5A allele in\nAMI occurrence is not so important in the European popu-\nlation.42\u00ad44 The research data from the Germans and\nItalians did not show any associations between the MMP-3\n5A/6A polymorphism and IHD.\nACE I/D definitely takes part in the pathogenesis of\nsome cardiovascular diseases such as arterial hyperten-\nsion, cardiomyopathies and aortic pathology. The associa-\ntion of this gene with AMI development is disputable. Our\nstudy shows that ID and II genotypes of ACE are associ-\nated with STEMI development. However, other research-\ners provide quite conflicting data. Some scientists declare\nthat particularly the D allele of ACE may be important in\nACS occurrence, while others demonstrate that ACE poly-\nmorphism does not account for ACS development at all.45\u00ad\n47 Functionally the D allele of ACE is more active and\ndetermines a higher enzymatic expression of ACE in tis-\nsues and blood causing its deleterious effects as described\nearlier. It is difficult to explain the data of our research as\nwe have found that genotypes II and ID of ACE with lower\nactivity are more valuable in the prediction of STEMI. It\nmay be explained by that fact that polymorphism of ACE\nI/D influences the development of STEMI indirectly\nthrough the other enzymatic systems (MMPs, etc.) or\naffecting the pharmacokinetics of the medication used.\nIn conclusion, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and\narterial hypertension are undoubted risk factors for IHD\nand can cause STEMI and NSTEMI in which the metabo-\nlism of glucose is more important in STEMI pathogenesis\nrather than NSTEMI. Pathogenetic differences between\nSTEMI and NSTEMI, different morphology of the athero-\nsclerotic plaque and its rupture can be determined by\ngenetic predisposition. The polymorphism of MMP-3 and\nACE may be important in STEMI development. According\nto our data these genotypes are not valuable in association\nwith NSTEMI development. However, traditional IHD\nfactors have a superior role over the genetic factors in\nSTEMI prediction.\n"
