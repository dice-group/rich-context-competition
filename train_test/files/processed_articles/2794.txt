    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article attempts to reevaluate the democratic implications of opinion diversity by\nshowing that politically hostile social networks do not necessarily discourage political\nparticipation. It is theorized that generalized social trust, as an individual differences\nvariable, can explain how individuals expect others to behave when deviating opinions\nare voiced. In contrast to high social trust individuals, low trust individuals believe\nothers will react negatively to such dissent. Thus, it is hypothesized that low trust\nindividuals refrain from participation when confronted with a hostile social network.\nUsing U.S. representative survey data, Study 1 confirms that a demobilizing effect of\nhostile networks can only be observed for lower levels of social trust. Study 2 rep-\nlicates this finding with an online survey addressing the underlying mechanism in a\nmediated moderation analysis. It is shown that social trust fuels behavioral expect-\nations about how others will react to dissent. These expectations, in turn, explain how\nhostile networks dampen participation.\nGeneral conceptions of democratic citizenship maintain that citizens should\ndevelop habits and capacities conducive to sound political judgment, they\nshould consider others' views in skilled and democratic conversation, and\nexpress their will and interests in and outside the voting booth.

However, other research finds that\npolitical diversity in social networks can have a dampening, rather than mobi-\nThis article attempts to reevaluate the effects of diverse political networks\nby showing that politically hostile opinion environments do not necessarily\ndiscourage participation. As has been argued before, hostile opinion environ-\nments might have a negative effect on participatory behavior because people\nfear that such disagreement threatens social relationships and social harmony.\nBased on this theorizing, it can be expected that generalized social trust--as a\nfundamental pillar of all social and interpersonal behavior--serves as a catalyst\nin such situations. Social trust refers to our expectations about how others\ngenerally behave and react in social situations (Luhmann, 1979). When an\nindividual generally puts low trust in others, she/he will expect that others\nwill react in negative ways when they are faced with dissent. In contrast, when\nsomeone scores high on social trust, she/he will not expect that others react\nnegatively to dissent. It follows that, compared with high trust individuals,\nindividuals low in generalized social trust may be less willing to participate\nwhen confronted with dissimilar political networks.\nTwo studies demonstrate that, in fact, hostile opinion networks decrease\nparticipation only for individuals who score low on generalized social trust.\nStudy 1 finds that individual differences in social trust moderate the relation-\nship between hostile opinion networks and political participation. Study 2\nreplicates these findings and additionally addresses the mechanism behind\nsocial trust. In a mediated moderation model, it is shown that trust leads to\npositive expectations about how others will react to dissent. These expect-\nations, then, interact with the exposure to hostile opinion networks in explain-\ning participation.\nThe Consequences of Hostile Opinion Environments\nMany scholars in political communication emphasize the importance of the\nsocial environment in fostering the development of civic engagement. Social\nnetworks are believed to encourage civic engagement (Putnam, 2000), affect\nvote choice (e.g., Campus et al., 2008), or increase the awareness for oppos-\nitional views (Nir & Druckman, 2008). However, it is not interaction per se\nthat matters to political participation but also the characteristics of this inter-\naction. Social environments can vary in their strengths (i.e., strong or weak\nties) and the sorts of people that interact. People can have a different religion,\nrace, educational background, and, of course, political opinions. One question\nwithin this line of research, therefore, is if politically diverse opinion networks\ncan harm or foster political participation.\nThe term hostile opinion environment refers to the extent to which people's\nsocial networks expose them to political views different from their own. Some\nscholars find evidence that hostile environments tend to depress political par-\naccording to the political ambivalence explanation, networks that challenge in-\ndividuals' views are likely to induce attitudinal ambivalence. This ambivalence,\nin turn, causes individuals to become uncertain of their own position which\nmakes them less likely to take political action. Second, the social accountability\nexplanation holds that adverse political networks discourage political partici-\npation because individuals are afraid to set their social relations at stake. Thus,\nthey refrain from participation to maintain social harmony. Also beyond the\npolitical realm, more heterogeneous networks in terms of education, income,\nor race have been found to decrease various forms of participatory behavior\nsuch as social activities (e.g., Alesina & La Ferrara, 2000), membership in\nlective action (Varughese & Ostrom, 2001).\nOther studies suggest that hostile opinion environments have no or even a\npositive effect on participatory outcomes. In an early study, Berelson, Lazarsfeld,\nand McPhee (1954) found no effect of general cross-pressures on voting. Other\nmore recent studies came to the conclusion that perceived disagreement within\ndiscussion networks does not have a negative impact on voting turnout\nheterogeneous discussion networks can also have a positive effect on various\nforms of participation (Kwak, Williams, Wang, & Lee, 2005; Pattie &\nHow can these contradicting findings be explained? Apparently, there are a\nnumber of factors that help to explain when the relationship between hostile\nopinion environments and participation turns out to be negative, positive, or\n2005 (p. 512) put it, ``the relationship between disagreement and engagement\nis complex, and simple assertions that disagreement attenuates civic capacity\ndo not survive close scrutiny''. Thus, there is a need to look for moderating\nvariables that help to make sense of these seemingly disparate results\nconcluded, ``research concerned with the effects of political dissimilarity on\nopinions or behaviors should more closely attend to individual characteristics'',\nand not ``accounting for the various moderating effects may obscure the\nexisting complexity and result in inconsistent findings'' (p. 174). In this art-\nicle, one such moderator is proposed, social trust.\nGeneralized Social Trust\nDefinitions of Trust and Social Trust\nTrust is perhaps the most important mechanism in helping people deal with risk\n505) put it, ``trust has consequences in almost every aspect of social life'' (also see\nthe distinguishing features of the human species'' that ``characterizes almost all\nhuman social interactions'' (Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2005,\np. 675). By trusting, the complexity of the future is reduced; the trusting actor\n(i.e., the trustee) acts as if the future only held certain possibilities (Kohring &\nactor. It expresses an expectation toward this actor which refers to a future\naction, and is characterized by insufficient knowledge about the outcome of\nthis future action. That means, in the act of trusting the trusting actor does not\nknow whether his or her trust is warranted. Therefore, trust includes the aware-\nness of a certain risk. Both aspects, open future and perceived risk, are decisive for\ntrust situations.\nSocial trust, as one aspect of trust, is one of the most important charac-\nteristics when explaining human behavior and human interaction (Luhmann,\n1979). It can be defined as the ``perception that other people are, in general,\nfair, trustworthy, and helpful'' (Cappella, 2002, p. 230). There are two broad\nconceptualizations of generalized social trust. The first holds that trust is a\ncharacteristic of individuals and there are interindividual differences in gen-\nthis view, social trust is part of a broader syndrome of personality (Couch,\n(1999, 2008) argues that trust is learned early in life, mainly from interactions\nwith parents. His analysis of American panel studies shows that individual\nlevels of interpersonal trust are among the most stable survey items over time\nThe second approach considers trust as a property of society rather than of\nindividuals (Putnam, 2000). According to this theorizing, levels of trust re-\nported in public opinion surveys are a good indicator of the trustworthiness\nand health of the societies in which citizens live.\nAs we are not interested in phenomena at the society level but rather focus\non the individual psychological level, we understand social trust as a general-\non how others will treat us. As Stack (1978) puts it, some individuals trust\ntheir beloved ones and strangers alike; others expect the worst from everyone\naround them. These sorts of people have developed different levels of\ngeneralized social trust. This conception of trait\u00adtrust should not be confused\nwith state\u00adtrust. Put differently, if people are comparatively stable in their\ngeneralized trait\u00adtrust over time, there can nevertheless be certain situations\n(i.e., states) that evoke higher or lower levels of social trust.\nGeneralized Social Trust and Hostile Opinion Environments\nAccording to Barber (1983), social trust describes the expectations that indi-\nviduals have about social interactions. As one of those expectations, people\nhigh in social trust expect others to have faith in and to show concern for the\na rational choice perspective, the trustee expects gains from social interactions\nrather than losses. Now, in hostile opinion environments, such faith and con-\ncern are relevant. When people are confronted with dissimilar political opin-\nions, they may experience a threat to their social relationships. This, in turn,\nmight make them more reluctant to engage in political actions. Hence, in\nterms of trust theory, there is a perceived risk or uncertainty that others\nwill react in negative ways.1 It is exactly this feeling of uncertainty in\nwhich social trust (as a trait) comes into play (Barber, 1983; Luhmann,\nperceive this uncertainty. People high in social trust will generally assume\nthat voicing one's dissenting views will not lead to negative sanctions by\nothers. They trust in the capacity of others to accept dissent. In contrast,\npeople low in social trust tend to expect that others react with a lack of faith\nin situations of opinion dissent, leading to withdrawal, decline of sympathy,\nand other negative reactions.\nRephrased, when people are surrounded by a hostile opinion environment,\na subjective fear to lose social relationships within this environment is trig-\ngered. Social trust, as an individual differences variable, explains the degree to\nwhich individuals expect such negative consequences (Luhmann, 1979; Stack,\n1978): Trusting people take the risk to participate even though their social\nenvironment could react in negative ways. Such an understanding of social\n1A similar theoretical argument has been made in spiral of silence theory (see Matthes, Morrison, &\nSchemer, 2010; see also Noelle-Neumann, 1974;). If we consider opinion expression as a form of political\nparticipation, then spiral of silence suggests that fear of interpersonal conflict inhibits participation.\nHowever, there are some important differences. First, we focus on cross-cutting interpersonal networks,\nnot on perceptions of the majority or minority opinion climate. That is, it does not matter to the present\nresearch whether people disagree on minority or majority positions. Hence, this article follows other studies\ndoes not investigate mass-mediated opinion climate, a key pillar of spiral of silence theory. Third, spiral of\nsilence theory does not allow an assumption about social trust as an individual difference variable. Social\ntrust explains people's expectations about how others react to dissent in social networks. Spiral of silence\ntheory, in contrast, would generally assume that people fear to be isolated. Fourth, spiral of silence theory\nconceptualizes willingness to speak out as the dependent variable. This research focuses on political par-\nticipation more generally. Willingness to speak out was not included in the participation index.\ntrust is also reflected in the more general nature of trust. According to\nFukuyama (1995, p. 26), trust is ``the expectation that arises within a com-\nmunity of regular, honest and cooperative behavior, based on commonly\nshared norms''. By the same token, Tschannen-Moran and Hoy (2000,\np. 556) define trust as ``one's party's willingness to be vulnerable to\nanother party based on the confidence that the latter party is (a) benevolent,\n(b) reliable, (c) competent, (d) honest and (e) open''.\nTo summarize, generalized social trust equips people with a set of behav-\nioral expectations toward others. That is, people varying in social trust do vary\nin their beliefs about how others will react to dissent. If there is high social\ntrust, individuals generally expect that others would not react in negative ways\nin the face of disagreement. In contrast, people who have a low or moderate\nlevel of social trust expect others to react negatively in response to disagree-\nment; i.e., that they turn away and give up the social relationship. It follows:\nH1: Social trust moderates the relationship between hostile opinion environments and\npolitical participation. In contrast to people who score high on social trust, hostile en-\nvironments will harm political participation activities for people who score low on social\ntrust.\nStudy 1 employs data from ``Citizenship, Involvement, Democracy'' (CID, see\nHoward, Gibson, & Stolle, 2005) survey, conducted between mid-May and\nmid-July 2005. The survey includes in-person interviews with a representative\nwas used. The overall response rate for this study was 40.03% using AAPOR's\nMeasures\nDependent Variable. Political participation was measured with a summary\nindex. Participation is a concept formed by causal (formative) indicators, not\nby effects (or reflective) indicators. Formative scales are used when a construct\nis defined as a total score across all the items. That is, there is no underlying\nconstruct that explains the correlations among those indicators. Each indicator\nrepresents an independent dimension in its own right (see for this causal\nRespondents were asked if (1 \u00bc yes, 0 \u00bc no) they engaged in the following\nin a political party or action group, worked for the campaign of a candidate\nfor office, worked in another political organization or association, worn or\ndisplayed a campaign badge/sticker, signed a petition, taken part in a lawful\npublic demonstration, forwarded electronic messages with political content, or\nparticipated in political activities over the internet. Private activities were not\nincluded. Reliability measured with the Kuder\u00adRichardson estimate was suf-\nFocal Independent Variables. Hostile opinion climate was measured\nwith three items tapping exposure to disagreement (not incivility, for a similar\n2010). People were asked the same question with respect to (a) close friends\nthey had contact with in the past month, (b) people they interacted with in\ntheir neighborhood, and (c), people they interacted with in their workplace (or\nschool, for respondents still going to school; or past job for respondents with-\nout a job). Respondents answered to the question ``About how many of them:\nHave different political views from yours?'' (1 \u00bc ``none'' to 9 \u00bc ``almost all'').\nSince these three items can be used to describe the ``overall'' opinion hostility\nthat people experience, the three items are summed up to an index. A PCA\nwith oblique rotation proved one-dimensionality (explained variance: 61.42%).\nrespondents not answering one of those questions were treated as missing\ncases.\nSocial trust was measured with three standard items, originally developed\nby Rosenberg (1956). The items were ``Generally speaking, would you say that\nmost people can be trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with\npeople?'', ``Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or are\nthey mostly looking out for themselves?'', and ``Do you think that most\npeople would try to take advantage of you if they got a chance or would\nthey try to be fair?''. Respondents were invited to place themselves on a\n11-point rating scale. PCA with oblique rotation proved one-dimensionality\n(explained variance: 68.58%), thus, a mean index was computed ( \u00bc .76;\nM \u00bc 5.30, SD \u00bc 1.93). To ease interpretation, social trust and opinion\nclimate were mean-centered (for critical discussion, see Hayes, Glynn &\nControls. To avoid underspecified regression models, a number of stat-\nistical controls were included. Beside some indispensable standard measures\nsuch as sex (2 \u00bc female, 1 \u00bc male), age, highest completed education\n(0 \u00bc ``none'' to 6 \u00bc ``postgraduate training''), socio-economic status (inter-\nviewer assessment, ranging from 1 \u00bc ``unskilled, unemployed'' to 4 ``upper,\nmiddle class'') was included because it has been found to impact participation\n(see e.g., Pattie & Johnston, 2009). Religiousness (``how religious would you\nwas added because religious orientation has been found to be a central variable\nin explaining political behavior (e.g., Layman, 1997).\nAs another central variable that positively influences participation (see\nDruckman, 2008), respondents' interest in politics was added (``How inter-\nested would you say you are in politics'', 1 \u00bc ``not at all'' to 4 ``very'';\nM \u00bc 2.24, SD \u00bc 0.90). Moreover, strength of political ideology was controlled\nJohnston, 2009). Respondents were asked, ``Would you call yourself a strong\n(Republican/Democrat) or not a very strong (Republican/Democrat)?''\n(1 \u00bc ``strong'', 0 \u00bc ``not very strong''). As a standard measure of conservative\nideology, people were asked to place themselves on a 10-point scale, ranging\nfrom 0 \u00bc ``extremely liberal'' to 10 \u00bc ``extremely conservative'' (M \u00bc 5.49,\nSD \u00bc 2.27). Following Sotirovic and McLeod (2001) exposure to political\nTV news was included (``On an average weekday, how much time, if any,\nis spent watching news or programs about politics and current events?'';\nNetwork size as a relevant variable for participation was also controlled. In\nline with previous studies (e.g., Kwak et al., 2005), this was done with an\nindex of two questions (``How many close friends do you have?'', 1 \u00bc ``none''\nto 6 ``more than 20'', and ``How many adults in your neighborhood would you\nknow by name if you met them on the street?'' 1 \u00bc ``none'' to 9 \u00bc ``all'',\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed with moderated regression including an interaction term\nbetween social trust and exposure to a hostile opinion environment.\nParticipation clustered toward the lower bound of the scale, thus, negative\nbinominal regression was used (see Gardner, Mulvey, & Shaw, 1995).\nResults\nThe results regarding the controls largely match with the findings of previous\nbe seen in Table I, higher educated individuals were more likely to participate\ncompared with lower educated individuals (b \u00bc .17, p < .001). Socio-economic\nrelated to participation. However, age, sex, conservative ideology, and network\nsize exerted no influence on the amount of political activities the respondents\nengaged in.\nMore importantly, there were no significant effects of hostile opinion en-\nvironments (b \u00bc \u00c0.02, n.s.) and of social trust (b \u00bc \u00c0.01, n.s.). Thus, there is\nno simple, unmoderated relationship between exposure to hostile political\nopinion environments and participatory activities. As can be seen in Table I, a\nsignificant interaction between both variables was present (b \u00bc .03, p < .05).\nThe positive sign of the interaction term signals that exposure to hos-\ntile opinion environments is more likely to foster participation for people\nhigh in social trust compared with people low in social trust, and that\nhostile opinion environments harm participation with decreasing levels of\ntrust.\nThe interaction led to a significant increase of .002% (p < .05) of the\nadjusted Pseudo R. To interpret the interaction, it was probed (see Bauer &\nthan zero (on a mean-centered scale), the effect of hostile opinion environ-\nments on political participation was significantly (b \u00bc \u00c0.13; p < .05) negative.\nIn contrast, for higher levels of social trust, no significant effect on political\nparticipation was observed.\nTable I\nUnstandardized regression (study 1) and mediated moderation path (study 2) model\ncoefficients\nVariables b (SE) Variables b (SE)\nBehavioral expectationsa\nregressed on\nPolitical participationb regressed on Political participationb regressed on\nSocial trust Behavioral expectations\nNote: aOLS regression\nbNegative binominal regression\nDiscussion\nFindings of Study 1 confirm the hypothesized moderating role of social trust.\nHowever, Study 1 was unable to model the underlying mechanism of this\nmoderation. It was argued that social trust equips individuals with a set of\nbehavioral expectations about how others will react to dissenting opinions.\nThese behavioral expectations, in turn, determine whether or not individuals\nengage in politics when confronted with a hostile opinion network. Behavioral\nexpectations, however, were not operationalized in Study 1. Thus, a second\nstudy is needed to test the theorized mediated moderation scenario with hos-\ntility as the independent variable and behavioral expectations being the mod-\nerator that is predicted by trust. That is, for individuals that have negative\nbehavioral expectations (about how others will react to dissenting views, as a\nresult of trust), network hostility will decrease participation (see Figure 1).\nFurthermore, as another drawback of Study 1, conflict avoidance was not\ncontrolled for. Since Mutz (2002) found that conflict avoidance moderates the\neffect of network hostility on participation, we need to demonstrate that the\nmoderating role of trust does not vanish once conflict avoidance is controlled\nfor. Thus, the aims of Study 2 were to replicate the findings of Study 1 in a\nmediated moderation model and additionally controlling for a conflict avoid-\nance scale.\nA sample of 250 participants was drawn from an U.S. online access panel in\nand administered by Survey Sampling International. The response rate was\nRR1 \u00bc .03. The survey took $5 min to complete. Participants were given an\nincentive by the polling company in exchange for their participation. A quota\nsampling method was used to obtain a sample identical to the general U.S.\npopulation in terms of gender, age, and education. In total, 13 respondents\nMeasures\nMost measures were identical to Study 1. Political participation was measured\nwith a summary index of the same eight public participation activities during\nmate was measured with the same three items (for a similar approach, see\nspondents did not answer these questions and were treated as missing cases.\nAlso, social trust was measured with the same three standard items as in Study\n1. PCA proved one-dimensionality (explained variance: 78.23%), thus, a mean\nabout how others generally react to dissent were measured with two items,\n``It's okay to disagree with friends on politics; they wouldn't turn their backs\non you because of that'', and ``Most people would not hold it against you if\nyou disagreed with them on something''. When entered into a PCA together\nwith the three social trust items, the two items formed an independent factor\n(25.11% explained variance) with no substantial cross-loadings. Thus, an\nease interpretation, behavioral expectations and network hostility were\nmean-centered.\nThe same controls as in Study 1 were operationalized (if not mentioned\notherwise all on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5): sex (2 \u00bc female, 1 \u00bc male),\nage, highest education (1 \u00bc ``some high school'' to 7 \u00bc ``doctorate, law or pro-\nfessional degree''), socio-economic status (``I am satisfied with my income'',\nM \u00bc 2.12, SD \u00bc 1.16), interest in politics (``I am interested in politics'',\nM \u00bc 2.92, SD \u00bc 1.33), strength of political ideology (respondents that scored\n4 or 5 either on ``I am a strong democrat'', or on ``I am a strong republican'',\n47.3%), conservative ideology (``I am a strong republican'', M \u00bc 2.22,\nSD \u00bc 1.47), exposure to political news (index of ``I frequently watch television\nto stay informed about politics'' and ``I frequently read a newspaper to stay\nSD \u00bc 1.27). Conflict avoidance was measured with three items similar to Mutz\n(2002) (``I try to avoid getting into political discussions because they can be\nunpleasant'', ``I don't like conflict when discussing with someone about pol-\nitics'', ``I am sometimes reluctant to talk about politics because I don't like\narguments'', one-dimensional index, 72.75% explained variance,  \u00bc .81,\nM \u00bc 3.40, SD \u00bc 1.01). When entered into a PCA, social trust, behavioral ex-\npectations, and conflict avoidance formed three distinct factors with no\ncross-loadings. Behavioral expectations was unrelated to conflict avoidance\nData Analysis\nA mediated moderation model using Mplus was estimated. The relationship\nbetween hostility and participation was moderated by behavioral expectations,\nwhereas the latter was explained by trust. More technically, the moderating\neffect of trust was mediated by expectations (Figure 1). Behavioral expect-\nations--as a continuous variable--was modeled with OLS regression, partici-\npation--a count variable--was modeled with negative binominal regression.\nResults\nAs Table I indicates, social trust had a significant positive effect on behavioral\nexpectations about how others will react to dissent (b \u00bc .07, p < .01). Similar to\nStudy 1, participation was explained by education (b \u00bc .16, p < .001) and pol-\nitical interest (b \u00bc .50, p < .001). Most germane to the main hypothesis, the\ninteraction between network hostility and behavioral expectations was signifi-\nincrease of the adjusted Pseudo R (Table I). There were again no main effects\nof network hostility and behavioral expectations. The positive sign of this\ninteraction again signals that hostile opinion networks might weaken partici-\npation with decreasing levels of positive expectations. In fact, further probing\nrevealed that network hostility decreases participation (b \u00bc \u00c0.73, p < .05) when\nbehavioral expectations about how others react to dissent were below \u00c0.5 on a\nmean-centered scale. In contrast, there was no effect of network hostility when\nindividuals scored higher than this value. Thus, trust fueled behavioral ex-\npectations, and these, in turn, interacted with network hostility to explain\nparticipation.\nTo estimate the conditional indirect effect of network hostility on partici-\npation (through positive expectations, predicted by social trust) a product\ncoefficient approach was applied (MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams,\n2004). The conditional indirect effect was marginally significant (Goodman\nthe direct effects of trust and network hostility on participation were not\nsignificant (b \u00bc \u00c0.03, n.s.). Thus, hostility was only relevant to participation\nwhen there were negative behavioral expectations as a result of trust.\nIn an additional analysis, the same covariates that were used to explain\nparticipation were added to predict behavioral expectations. As a result, the\neffect of trust on behavioral expectations slightly decreased (b \u00bc .06, p < .05)\nbut was still significant. However, since there were no theoretical grounds to\nConceptual mediated moderation model\nPolitical\nParticipation\nNetwork\nHostility\nBehavioral\nExpectations\nSocial Trust\ninclude all those different controls--like it was the case for participation--the\ncontrols were not included in the model shown in Table I.\nFurthermore, a different model was tested. Network hostility was\ntheorized to interact with trust on its effect on behavioral expectations. The\nidea was that behavioral expectations might be more positive for high trust\nindividuals when confronted with a hostile opinion network than for low\ntrust individuals. However, this was not the case: There was no signifi-\ncant interaction between trust and hostility (b \u00bc \u00c0.01, n.s.), and no main\neffect of hostility (b \u00bc \u00c0.03, n.s.). All other effects shown in Table I remained\nconstant.\nTo directly replicate the results yielded in Study 1, an additional analysis\nemployed trust in exchange for behavioral expectations. It was expected, like\nin Study 1, that trust interacts with network hostility to explain participation.\nHowever, although the interaction effect pointed in the expected direction, it\ndid not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (b \u00bc .02, n.s.).2\nA final model tested if the relationship between hostile opinion networks\nand participation was moderated by conflict avoidance (see Mutz, 2002; Ulbig\n& Funk, 1999). It could be theorized that especially conflict avoidant people\nrefrain from participation in the face of politically diverse others. However,\nthere was no such two-way interaction when tested in an additional model\nDiscussion\nStudy 2 confirms the reasoning behind Study 1. Hostile opinion networks\nharm participation when people score low on generalized social trust. The\nreason is that social trust determines behavioral expectations about how\nothers will behave when they are confronted with politically dissimilar opin-\nions. Another aim of Study 2 was to control for conflict avoidance with a\nreliable index of three items. It was found that the trust process theorized in\nthis article is independent from conflict avoidance.\nGeneral Discussion\nThis article argued that the relationship between hostile opinion environments\nand political participation is moderated by individuals' level of generalized\nsocial trust. Trust was conceptualized as a personality trait that tends to be\n2Although this finding may seem puzzling, it is important to note that this is not necessarily a contra-\ndiction to Study 1. There can be a mediated effect even when there is no main or direct effect (see Hayes,\n2009). Like in Study 1, trust had an impact on the relationship between network hostility and participation.\nIn Study 1, this effect was unmediated; in Study 2, this effect was fully mediated by behavioral expecta-\ntions. One reason for this difference might be the smaller sample size in Study 2 dampening the explanatory\npower of trust.\nrelatively stable over time, and is predictive of trust-relevant social interactions\nacross situations. Study 1 demonstrated that low trust individuals refrain from\nparticipation when confronted with a hostile opinion network. Study 2 pro-\nvided further evidence for this effect by unraveling the mechanism behind this\nprocess. Social trust moderates the effect of network hostility on participation\nbecause it fuels people's expectations about how network members react to\ndissent. When individuals assume (because of their generalized social trust\nbeliefs) that others react in negative ways, when confronted with dissimilar\npolitical opinions, participation in hostile opinion environments will be\nthwarted.\nFindings of both studies are in line with the social accountability explan-\nation holding that hostile networks discourage participation because individ-\nuals are afraid to set their social relations at stake (see Mutz, 2002). The key\ninsight of both studies is: Not all individuals are equally involved in this\nprocess. People who are generally high in social trust have no expectations\nthat opinion deviance sets social relations at stake. In short, they just do not\nsee the danger of voicing dissenting viewpoints. This process is conceptually\nand empirically different from conflict avoidance which was controlled for in\nboth studies. Conflict avoidance, as an individual difference variable, can be\ndescribed as an internal motivation to avoid all situations involving conflict.\nGeneralized social trust, in contrast, explains individuals' expectations whether\nor not opinion deviance will cause conflicts and negative sanctions by the\nsocial network. Rephrased, trust explains individuals' generalized expectations\nabout how others will behave and react. In fact, conflict avoidance and social\ntrust were only weakly correlated (Study 2: r \u00bc \u00c0.14, p < .05). It follows that\nthere can be people that are high in social trust and nevertheless very conflict\navoidant. Likewise, there can be people who generally tend to seek conflicts\nbut score very low on generalized social trust measures. However, it was\nbeyond the scope of this article to address the political ambivalence explan-\nation which holds that hostile networks induce attitudinal ambivalence which,\nin turn, hampers political action. Ambivalence is mostly operationalized with\nrespect to two candidates or a policy issue (see Mutz, 2002). The measures\nused in this study, in contrast, generalize about several policy issues.\nFurthermore, it should also be stated that the results herein--specifically in\nregard to conflict avoidance--are not directly comparable to Mutz (2002)\nbecause network hostility was measured as a subjective assessment and not\nby a name generator method.\nFurther data analysis revealed that generalized social trust and exposure to\nhostile opinion networks were positively related in Study 1 (r \u00bc .14, p < .001),\nalbeit not significantly in Study 2 (r \u00bc .16, p \u00bc .12). Thus, there was a (mar-\nginal) relationship between the focal independent variable and the moderator.\nOne might argue that trust impacts exposure to network hostility, which in\nturn influences participation. However, there was no main effect of network\nhostility on participation in both studies. Thus, the unique role of trust lies in\nits interaction with network hostility (through its impact on behavioral expect-\nations). Put in more abstract terms, a relationship between trust and network\nhostility does by no means imply that the effect of trust on the relationship\nbetween hostility and participation is spurious.\nImplications\nSince in most Western countries politics is largely confrontational and polar-\nized, cross pressures are very common in the course of campaigns, both in the\npersonal realm (see Mutz, 2002). Thus, the question of how people react in such\nsituations is central to many communication processes as well as to the field at\nlarge. In line with other recent research (Wojcieszak, 2011; Wojcieszak et al.,\n2010), findings of the present two studies suggest that the relationship between\ncross-pressures and participation is more complex than generally acknowledged.\nIn fact, it was not found that disagreement has a negative impact on participa-\ntory behavior ``for all'' citizens. Only some individuals, however--those who\ngenerally put less trust in others--are susceptible to this process.\nFor democracy, this is, of course, good news. Based on the findings of the\npresent research, we cannot say that disagreement harms participation per se.\nOn the contrary, disagreement is an important part of democratic behavior.\nHowever, people need to develop skills to deal with such disagreement. These\nskills are learned over one's life span and can be positively influenced, espe-\ncially in early childhood and in political socialization. That is, according to\npersonality theory, generalized trust is especially built in early years in life. As\nUslaner (2004) puts it, ``how much one trusts others as a child largely deter-\nmines how much one trusts others as an adult'' (p. 240). Democratic societies\nthat are high in generalized social trust (and therefore social capital), do not\nneed to fear disagreement as a danger to the functioning of democracy.\nCombined with the findings of the present research, these insights point\nsomehow to the importance of (non)political socialization in explaining citi-\nzens' political engagement. Political participation does not start with the eli-\ngibility to vote but in infancy when children learn from their close interactions\nthat the generalized other can be trusted.\nFinally, the role of trust in building a healthy democracy is--as all trust\nprocesses (Luhmann, 1979)--twofold. Social trust fosters participation not\nonly through a higher likelihood of the trustee to engage in politics when\nconfronted with disagreement, but also through a lower likelihood of the\ntrusted to betray this trust. Put differently, if those that receive trust in dis-\nsimilar opinion environments do share a trusting attitude, they are also more\nlikely to respond to disagreement in positive ways, that is, to cherish social\nbonds. Thus, if both sides of a trust relation are high in generalized trust,\ntrust will be paid back to the trustee.\nLimitations and Future Research\nThere are limitations to this study that are worthy of careful consideration.\nFirst, it might be argued that the measure of network hostility that was used\nin both studies is a self-perceptual measure and thus prone to subjective biases\n(for a discussion, see Wojcieszak et al., 2010). Although such biases cannot\nentirely be ruled out, several variables that might impact perceptual bias (e.g.,\nideology strength, political interest, conflict avoidance) were controlled for in\nboth studies. Furthermore, perceptual hostility measures are quite established\net al., 2010). Nevertheless, a validation of these findings with nonperceptual\nmeasures is needed.\nSecond, and more importantly, cross-sectional studies are unable to tackle the\nproblem of causality. If trust serves as a moderator between heterogeneous pol-\nitical networks and participation, does generalized trust also depend on hetero-\ngeneous political networks, and does political participation also lead to more trust\nin generalized others? Many scholars in political communication have pointed to\nthis rather severe chicken-and-egg problem in regard to a number of research\nfields. Ultimately, panel studies or elaborate experimental settings are needed to\nresolve this issue. However, it can be argued with leading theorists in the field of\ngeneralized trust that there is a rather stable interindividual variance in trust\nbehaviors that cannot be explained by contextual factors (Uslaner, 1999).\nRelated to that, we have treated trust as a trait-like concept. The findings\nherein should be replicated with state-oriented measures, perhaps in experimental\ndesigns. This would help to understand the amount of variance that can be ex-\nplained by state versus trait factors in this process.\nThird, as common in research involving large survey data and a number of\nsignificant controls, the effect of the interaction terms were rather small in both\nstudies, though statistically significant and meaningful. One reason for that might\nbe that trust was measured with regard to generalized others. More specific trust\nmeasures and especially state-like measures, i.e., in regard to individuals' existing\nsocial networks, might exert larger effects. A related drawback is that respondents\nwere not asked with respect to a policy issue or candidate, the questions generally\nreferred to political disagreement across time and issues. It can be assumed that\neffects will be stronger when working with issue-specific measures. Related to\nthat, it is important to note that the present research did not investigate partici-\npation in an election context. Participation was measured with respect to people's\nnonvoting activities in the past 12 months. Replication of these findings in an\nelection context is therefore warranted.\nFinally, a few controls were tapped with single items. Although some of them\nare standard measures (i.e., political interest), standardized and validated scales\nwould provide more reliable results. However, for all key dependent and inde-\npendent measures, reliable multi-item scales were used. Still, behavioral expect-\nations were operationalized with only two items that were moderately reliable,\nthough it should be noted that reliability increases with a rising number of items.\nMoreover, one item of the behavioral expectations measure referred to ``friends'',\nthe other to ``most people''. Clearly, these items tap different facets of behavioral\nexpectations and thus they are not equally valid for all social networks.\nFuture research should not only attempt to replicate the present findings,\nbut also strive to apply more elaborate longitudinal designs or experimental\nsettings. Especially, experiments could help to model the causal mechanisms in\nresponse to hostile opinion environments. Even though social trust can be\nunderstood as an individual difference variable, trust attitudes could be trig-\ngered in sound experimental settings. That is, by providing trust cues, gen-\neralized social trust--and as a consequence behavioral expectations--could be\nmanipulated. Then, it could be observed how people react when they are\nconfronted with politically dissimilar networks.\nMore central to the general literature on political disagreement and par-\nticipation, future studies should aim for a more extensive understanding of\nseveral mechanisms that hamper or foster participation. In this study, the\nfocus was on interpersonal disagreement and social trust. The combined effects\nof interpersonal disagreement and mass-mediated cross-pressures (see\nNoelle-Neumann, 1974) in explaining political participation deserve more\nscholarly attention (see Matthes, 2012). This could demonstrate whether the\nmechanisms leading to participation and political withdrawal are similar in\nthese contexts or tell different stories.\nAcknowledgements\nThe CID survey was commissioned by Georgetown University's Center for\nDemocracy and Civil Society and funded primarily by a grant from Atlantic\nPhilanthropies, with additional support from the Weidenbaum Center on the\nEconomy, Government, and Public Policy.
