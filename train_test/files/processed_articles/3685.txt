    "abstract": "Abstract. The human visual system is usually very successful in segmenting complex natural scenes.\nDuring a trip to the Nepalese Himalayas, we observed an impossible example of Nature's beauty:\n\"transparent\" mountains. The scene is captured in a photograph in which a pair of mountain peaks\nviewed in the far distance appear to be transparent. This illusion results from a fortuitous combination\nof lighting and scene conditions, which induce an erroneous integration of multiple segmentation cues.\nThe illusion unites three classic principles of visual perception: Metelli's constraints for perceptual\ntransparency, the Gestalt principle of good continuation, and depth from contrast and atmospheric\nscattering. This real-world \"failure\" of scene segmentation reinforces how ingeniously the human\nvisual system typically integrates complex sources of perceptual information using heuristics based\non likelihood as shortcuts to veridical perception.\n",

Take a look at the photograph in Figure 1. Clear all\nthoughts from your mind and stare into the distance to observe the far-away peaks. If you persist and\nreach a Zen-like state, you may observe that the mountains look even more mysterious than at first\nglance. The two most distant peaks appear transparent. At first, you may think that you have achieved\nthe ability to see through impenetrable solid rock through your mastery of a Zen-like state. Fortunately,\ndecades of perception research can provide a more scientific explanation. The transparent mountains\nare highlighted in the boxed region of Figure 2a, and in the illusion both their segmentation and relative\ndepth are misperceived. In the illusory interpretation, the nearer mountain appears to be defined by areas\ny and z, with region z overlapping with the more distant mountain defined by areas x and y (Figure 2a).\nThe enlargement in Figure 2b clearly shows that this interpretation of the image is incorrect: in fact,\nregion z belongs to the nearer mountain, and the more distant mountain is defined by areas x and y.\nThree classic principles of visual perception underlie this illusion. First, the photograph is a nice\nexample of contrast as a depth cue due to atmospheric scattering. Distant objects are viewed through\nmore of the atmosphere than nearer objects, and hence have lower contrast. This is known as \"aerial\n(or atmospheric) perspective\" and psychophysical experiments have demonstrated that contrast is used\nas a pictorial depth cue by human observers (O'Shea, Blackburn, & Ono, 1994; Rohaly & Wilson,\n1999). The closer mountains in Figure 1 have much greater contrast with the light background sky\nZen mountains: An illusion of perceptual transparency\n*Corresponding author.\nFigure 1.

(a) In the original image, mountain y is misperceived to be nearer in\ndepth than mountain x, and area z appears to be a transparent region of overlap between the two. (b) In the enlarged\nimage, it is clear that region x and y belong to the more distant mountain, and area z defines a nearer mountain.\nThe arrow indicates the narrowest region in the photograph separating the two mountains, which leads to the\nmisperception of a contour connecting the peaks defined by areas y and z, supporting the alternative (illusory)\ninterpretation of transparency. The contour completion associated with the transparency illusion is outlined in (c);\nthe veridically completed contours are outlined in (d).\noverhead than the more distant mountains. The relative difference in luminance between the distant\nmountain peaks produced by atmospheric scattering is one ingredient for the illusion of transparency\nin this scene.\nMetelli (1974) recognized that perceptual transparency is possible in the absence of physical trans-\nparency if opaque surfaces obey certain luminance conditions. The differences in relative luminance\nbetween the distant mountain peaks that are the subject of the illusion in Figure 1 are consistent with\nMetelli's (1974) constraints for perceptual transparency. The overlap between two transparent objects\nmust be darker than either object itself. The two mountains in Figure 2a obey this rule, because they\ndiffer in luminance as a consequence of aerial perspective. The luminance of the overlap region (z)\nis consistent with a combination of the lighter luminances of areas x and y. This makes it plausible\nPublished under a Creative Commons Licence a Pion publication\nZen mountains: An illusion of perceptual transparency 110\nthat areas y and z belong to the same (nearer) mountain, with region z marking the area of transparent\noverlap with a more distant mountain defined by area x. The four-region pattern produced by the align-\nment of contours defining regions x, y, and z (captured in the box inset in Figure 2a) is known as a\nnonreversing X-junction (Adelson & Anandan 1990; Anderson 1997). The relative luminances of the\nfour areas retain their sign (i.e., their contrast polarity) across the X-junction, because w<x and y<z\nand similarly, x<z and w<y. A consequence of nonreversing X-junctions is that the luminance condi-\ntions are consistent with transparency and yet ambiguous with respect to depth ordering, and thus this\nform of X-junction supports two alternative transparency organizations. Although we have described\nthe illusion as perceiving region y in the foreground, the X-junction also supports the alterative percep-\ntion of region x in the foreground (in this case the likelihood of perceiving one or the other probably\ndepends on the precise alignment of the contours in this natural scene).\nThe final classic principle from the history of perception involved in this illusion is the Gestalt\nprinciple of good continuation. The Gestalt psychologists emphasized the importance of grouping cues\non visual perception. Wertheimer (1923) identified several specific grouping principles in his discus-\nsion of perceptual organization, including that of \"good continuation.\" The concept of good continu-\nation is that contours appear to be connected by the shortest or smoothest route, i.e., they follow the\n\"easiest\" path. The contours involved in the illusion are outlined in Figure 2c and Figure 2d. Figure 2c\nshows how the contours are perceived under illusory conditions, as two relatively straight, overlap-\nping lines. Figure 2d outlines the contours corresponding to the veridical interpretation of the scene,\nin which two lines come very close to touching in the middle, but then depart directions. According\nto the Gestalt principle of good continuation, the contours in Figure 2c (corresponding to the illusory\ninterpretation) are more likely to be perceived than those in Figure 2d (corresponding to the veridical\ninterpretation). The lines in the illusory case (Figure 2c) are also very similar to the classic example of\ngood continuation as is demonstrated in many psychology textbooks.\nIn sum, the mountains appear transparent in this photograph not because of a Zen-like state induced\nby admiring a wonder of Nature, but because of three principles of visual perception that normally\nsupport veridical perception. In this scene, it is coincidental that the viewing angle and lighting elicit\na set of conditions in which these perceptual inferences lead to misperception. The combination of\nappropriate luminance differences for perceptual transparency, in conjunction with physical contours\nthat violate the principle of good continuation, leads to an incorrect segmentation of the scene, and\nin turn, a misperception of depth ordering. The reason this illusion is striking is that it relies on both\nthe luminance conditions for transparency and the precise alignment of physical contours inconsistent\nwith the principle of good continuation being present in the scene. As with most illusions, this example\nof an uncommon situation in which perceptual segmentation of the scene differs from the true, physi-\ncal segmentation underscores how well the visual system normally integrates multiple segmentation\ncues to support veridical perception.\n"
