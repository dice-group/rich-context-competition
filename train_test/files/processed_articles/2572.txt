African American youth are\nalso more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods which increase their victimization, observation, and fear of violence.\nObjectives: This study tested if victimization, observation, and fear of violence in the neighborhood during adolescence predict\ntrajectory of body mass index (BMI) in the 3rd decade of life in African Americans.\nPatients and Methods: Data came from an 18-year community-based cohort. We used multi-group latent growth curve modeling\nfor data analysis, considering neighborhood violence at age 15 (i.e. victimization, observation, and fear) as predictors, and the linear\nslope for the average change in BMI from age 21 to 32 as the outcome, with age and socioeconomic status (i.e. intact family and\nparental employment) as covariates.\nResults: Fear of neighborhood violence at age 15 was predictive of an increase in BMI from age 21 to 32 among female but not male\nAfrican Americans. Victimization and observation of violence at age 15 did not predict BMI change from age 21 to 32 among female\nor male African Americans.\nConclusions: Fear of neighborhood violence is a contributing factor to increased risk of obesity for female African American youth\nwho live in disadvantaged areas. This finding has implications for prevention of obesity among African American women who are\nat highest risk for obesity in the United States.

Background\nFor young people who strive to achieve financial, res-\nidential, emotional, and social independence, transition\nto adulthood is one of the most stressful developmen-\ntal periods, marked by multiple transitions (1, 2). In ad-\ndition to the normative developmental stressors that ev-\nery individual experiences, African Americans are also ex-\nposed to several stressors related to social disorder and un-\nsafe neighborhoods that cumulatively deteriorate health\nand well-being (3). As African Americans tend to live in\neconomically disadvantaged areas, neighborhood-related\nstress is a main source of daily hassles for them (4, 5).\nAlthough exposure to stress in multiple life domains, in-\ncluding those related to the social environment, increases\nrisk for poor physical and mental health outcomes among\nAfrican American emerging adults (3), the effects of neigh-\nborhood stress on health may be gender specific (4, 5).\nAfrican American youth who live in low-income neigh-\nborhoods are more likely to witness shootings, stabbings,\nand killings in their neighborhoods compared to White or\nmiddle class peers (6, 7). This is especially true for African\nAmerican male youth (6, 7). For African Americans who\nare in transition to adulthood in the inner cities, perceived\nunsafe environment, neighborhood fear, and exposure to\nviolence are significant daily challenges associated with a\nwide range of undesired health outcomes (4, 5, 8-15).\nA growing body of evidence suggests that exposure\nto violence may increase risk of obesity and metabolic\nsyndrome (16, 17). This is consistent with the literature\nCopyright \u00a9 2016, Kashan University of Medical Sciences.

The mechanisms underlying such a link may include\nlifestyle changes such as decreased physical activity, in-\ncreased food intake, depression, as well as altered activ-\nity of the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (18).\nGender is also shown as an important factor in the stress-\nEven in the absence of direct exposure to violence\n(violence victimization), living in unsafe neighborhoods\nengenders fear and anxiety (19-21). Among residents of\neconomically and socially deprived neighborhoods, per-\nceived neighborhood fear predicts high depressive symp-\ntoms (22), low outdoor physical activity, and poor physi-\n(21). High propensity for crime, disorder, and violence in\nlow-income communities is a direct consequence of struc-\ntural racism, as well as social inequities, lack of availability\nof jobs, and blocked opportunities (21, 25).\nHigh rate of violence in the communities affects phys-\nical and mental health of African American youth during\ntheir transition to adulthood (26, 27). African Americans\nwho cannot afford moving to suburban areas and must\ncontinue living in low income urban neighborhoods are\nat an increased risk of exposure to crime and unsafe con-\nditions associated with the constrained economic oppor-\ntunities and limited social resources in such context (28).\nDespite a desire to craft occupational, educational, and re-\nlational aspirations for their lives, living in high crime and\nunsafe neighborhoods increases African American youths'\nday-to-dayexposuretoviolenceorperceptionof fearwhich\nadds to their already high levels of financial stress (27, 29,\n30). In such unsafe neighborhoods, survival maintenance\nbecomes a priority for many African American youth (4, 31,\nUsing a life course epidemiological approach (33, 34)\nand built on the socio-ecological model of development\n(35), this longitudinal study followed African American\nyouth who were living in economically disadvantaged and\nunsafe urban areas for 18 years to test if victimization, ob-\nservation, and fear of neighborhood violence at age 15 pre-\ndict the development of obesity during their 3rd decade of\nlife, and if male and female African American youth differ\nin such a prediction.\n2.

Patients and Methods\nThis study used data of the Flint adolescent study (FAS),\nyouth who were transitioning from adolescence to early\nadulthood (36, 37). The study protocol was approved by the\nlocal Institutional Review Board and all participants pro-\nvided consent or assent before each interview.\nParticipants were sampled from four local public high\nschools. The study sampled ninth graders who had a grade\npoint average (GPA) of 3.0 or lower (in eighth-grade). Di-\nagnoses of developmental disability or emotional impair-\nment were exclusion criteria.\nFor the current analysis we used demographic and\nsocio-economic data collected at age 15 (Wave 1), neighbor-\nhood violence at age 15 (victimization, observation, and\nfemales) participated in the current study. The retention\nData were collected using face-to-face structured inter-\nviews conducted either at school or at alternative commu-\nnity locations. Each interview lasted about 60 minutes on\naverage. This study followed participants regardless of stu-\ndents' dropping out of school.\nDemographic data (age and gender) and two mea-\nsures of family socio-economic status (parental employ-\nment and family structure) were measured at baseline\n(year 1994). Parental employment status was operational-\nized as a dichotomous variable (both parents employed\nversus any other conditions). Family structure was also\nmeasured as intact (youth living with both biological par-\nents versus any other condition) or others.\n3.2.2. Fear of Neighborhood Violence\nThe following two items were used to measure individ-\nual perception of fear from violence in the neighborhood:\n1, I am afraid of the violence in my neighborhood; and 2,\nI worry that someone in my neighborhood will physically\nhurt me. Both items used a 4-point Likert scale, ranging\nfrom 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). We used a\nmean score with higher score indicative of more fear if vi-\nAssari S et al.\n3.2.3.

Univariate Analysis\nTable 1 provides descriptive statistics for demograph-\nics, violence (fear of neighborhood violence, violence ob-\nservation, and violence victimization), and BMI in the\npooled sample, and based on gender. From Wave 5 to 12,\nBMI increased gradually among both male and female par-\nticipants (P < 0.001 for trend). Females had higher BMI\nthan males at all waves with the last wave being an excep-\ntion (P < 0.001 for all significant associations). While fear\nof neighborhood violence, violence observation, and vio-\nlence victimization at Wave 1 were high for both genders,\nfear of violence in neighborhood was marginally higher\nfor females, and violence observation was significantly\nhigher for males. Violence victimization at wave 1 did not\ndiffer between male and females (Table 1).\n4.2.

Discussion\nFear of violence in the neighborhood at age 15 is pre-\ndictive of an increase in BMI from age 21 to 32 among fe-\nmale but not male African American youth. Thus for fe-\nmaleAfricanAmericanyouthwholiveindisadvantaged ar-\neas, fear of violence in the neighborhood is one of the con-\ntributing factors of their increased risk of obesity.\nThis study makes a unique contribution to the litera-\nture by suggesting a mechanism for higher rates of obe-\nsity among African American females who live in unsafe\nneighborhoods. African Americans are more likely than\nany other ethnic groups to develop the negative outcomes\nassociated with living in high-risk neighborhoods (45-47).\nOur study offers insights about potential social and cogni-\ntive processes that contribute to the trajectories of obesity\namong African American females during the transition to\nadulthood.\nThe current study builds on past research by noting\nthat for African American females, it not the exposure to\nviolence per se, but the perceived fear of violence in the\nneighborhood which has subsequent and lasting effects\non obesity 18 years later. Perceived fear of violence may\nbe one of the ingredients by which poor environments\nchange human behavior (24, 31). Perhaps this fear con-\ntributes to a lack of engagement in outdoor physical activi-\ntiesduring thetransition toadulthood thatcontinuesover\na lifetime, which has implications for future obesity. Our\nfindings are also consistent with other studies indicating\nthat exposure to physical violence is associated with obe-\nsity (16, 17). Given the fact that fear is a type of stress (48),\nAssari S et al.\nFigure 1. Summary of Latent Growth Curve Modeling Among Male African American Youth\nAge\nIntact\nFamily\nParent\nEmployment\nViolence\nObservation\nViolence\nVictimization\nViolence\nFear\nIntercept Slope\nMale Black Youth\nour finding is in line with the literature on the effect of\npsychologicalstressonobesity(18), withsomeinteractions\nwith gender and economic status (18).\nSupporting our findings, it has been previously shown\nthat psychosocial stress plays an important role in devel-\nopment of excess body fat and obesity (49-51). Although\nthe exact mechanism of the effect of stress on obesity is\nstill unknown (51), as suggested by McEwen and Seeman\n(51) long-term stress has the potential to induce long last-\ning changes to the stress reaction through physiological\npathways that have well-established roles in obesity and\nmetabolic syndrome (52-54). A number of studies have\nshown that chronic psychosocial stress is a risk factor for\nobesity, and causes excess body fat accumulation, espe-\nBased on social disorganization theory originally de-\nprocesses mediate the effect of living in unsafe neighbor-\nhoods on health, behaviors, and well-being of individuals\nand populations. In this view, a neighborhood is a com-\nplex system that shapes exposures and resources, includ-\ning peers and families (26). Our findings confirms and ex-\ntends this theory by suggesting that perceived neighbor-\nhood fear may be one of the mechanisms that may explain\nhow the social environment may adversely affect individ-\nual physiological changes.\nAlthough previous researchers have investigated psy-\nchosocial risk factors of obesity, few have tested the role of\nexposure to violence for African American youth. African\nAmerican adolescents who reside in disadvantaged neigh-\nborhoods are often exposed to high levels of physical vio-\nlence as victims, witnesses and, to a lesser extent, as perpe-\ntrators. Among urban youth, 50% - 100% report witnessing\nviolence in their community (9, 45, 57), with African Amer-\nican boys at higher risk for witnessing violence (4, 45).\nYouth from lower SES families are also more likely to reside\nin poorer, urban neighborhoods characterized by higher\ncrime levels among other disadvantages (26, 47). A recent\nyears) applied life history calendar tools to provide a com-\nprehensive history of loss and also identified the develop-\nmental timing of deaths. On average, participants knew 3\nhomicide victims who were overwhelmingly peers. Partic-\nipants had started experiencing homicide death in early\nchildhood, which peaked in adolescence and persisted\ninto emerging adulthood. The researchers concluded that\nyoung black men frequently experienced traumatic loss of\npeers to homicide (32). Although our findings support this\nAssari S et al.\nFigure 2.

According to\nthe national survey of children's exposure to violence, in a\none year period, 61% of the adolescents are victims or wit-\nnesses to physical violence and 7% are threated or injured\nwith weapons (60).

This is particu-\nlarly needed for adolescents who reside in disadvantaged\nneighborhoods and may be exposed to high levels of phys-\nical violence as victims, witnesses and, may experience fear\nof violence. Among urban youth, 50% - 100% witness vi-\nolence in the neighborhoods (45), with African American\nyouth at highest risk for witnessing violence (4, 45). This\nrisk is highest for African American youth from lower so-\ncioeconomic families who reside in poor urban neighbor-\nhoods characterized by high crime rates among other so-\nSimilar to the results of the current study, gender dif-\nferences on the health effects of fear of neighborhood and\nneighborhood safety have been previously shown. In a re-\ncent study by Assari et al. in 2015 (4), an increase in fear\nof neighborhood violence was associated with an increase\nin depressive symptoms for African American male but\nnot for female young adults who were living in poor ur-\nban areas. Based on that study, even incremental increase\nin fear of neighborhood violence among African Ameri-\ncan among 21 - 22 year old males was predictive of an in-\ncrease increase in depressive symptoms two years later (4).\nIn another study on a racially diverse sample, Assari et al.\nfound that perceived neighborhood safety at age 15 pre-\ndicted subjective health at age 33; however, as with fear in\nthis study, the effect was found only among females (5).\nOur findings suggest that interventions, programs,\nand policies that increase sense of safety in the commu-\nnities should be considered as a strategy to prevent obe-\nsity during emerging adult African American females. Fu-\nture research that tests if programs and policies that lower\nneighborhood crime and violence rate also reduce the bur-\nden of obesity among African American females would\nbe useful. Programs that increase availability of psycho-\neducational resources in the communities where African-\nAmericans live may also help African American females\nbetter cope with fear of violence in their high risk neigh-\nborhoods. Most importantly, more initiatives are needed\ntoincreasesafetyinurbanneighborhoods. Policiesthatad-\ndress this issue at the structural level (e.g. more policing,\nbetterstreetlights, noabandonhousing, etc.) willenhance\nsense of safety at the community.\nOur study has a few limitations that are necessary to\nacknowledge. Our sampling strategy was not random, so\nthe results may not be generalizable to all African Ameri-\ncans in the U.S. We used few items to measure fear, obser-\nvation, and victimization of violence. Future studies that\napply more comprehensive measures of violence, fear, and\nexposure are needed. Our study relied on self-report vari-\nables and was limited to individual level characteristics.\nExamining how neighborhood level violence is associated\nwithsubsequentriskof obesitywouldbeausefuldirection\nfor future research (64). Finally, our study did not measure\nmedical and behavioral risk factors of obesity including di-\nabetes, exercise, diet, as well as HPA function. Despite these\nlimitations, our longitudinal design and long term follow\nup both represent significant contributions to the litera-\nture.\nTo conclude, perceived fear of neighborhood violence\nduring adolescence predicts change in BMI in the 3rd\ndecade of life among African American females. Our find-\nings provide further evidence of the connection between\nstressors associated with violence and obesity, and in this\ninstance a connection between prevention in criminal jus-\ntice and public health systems. Programs and policies that\nprevent violence and enhance perceived safety may be use-\nful strategies for obesity prevention among female African\nAmerican young adults.\nAssari S et al.\nSupplements\nSupplementary material(s) is available at below link:\nhttp://archtrauma.com/?page=download&file_id=58284\n"
