This study analysed the impact of\nunemployment on depression and well\nbeing among African-American people,\nand the factors associated with well being.\nMethods--Logistic and multiple\nregression models were used to analyse\npanel data collected in the National Sur-\nrespondents were analysed separately.\nOutcome variables included an index of\ndepression and self reported health status.\nMain findings--DiVerences between em-\nployment and unemployment groups were\nless significant for African-Americans\nthan for the white population in predicting\ndepression and well being. Health enhanc-\ning factors such as education and wealth\nwere significantly associated with better\nhealth and lower depression indices\namong the white population but not\nconsistently so among African-\nAmericans. Satisfaction with personal\nrelationships was the strongest predictor\nof well being for both groups.\nConclusion--Research should focus on\nthe special needs and circumstances of\nAfrican-Americans, because protective\nfactors may not have the same impact in\ndiVerent groups of the population.\nDuring the past 20 years unemployment levels\nhave increased dramatically in Western coun-\ntries, and reducing unemployment has domi-\nnated the policy agenda of industrialised coun-\ntries. The USA has been very successful in\nlowering the overall unemployment rate to 5.3\nper cent during the first quarter of 1997, but it\nremains much higher for some groups of the\npopulation. While the seasonally adjusted\nunemployment rate for the white population is\nAfrican-Americans,1 and 8.3 per cent for\nHispanics of all origins.\nNot only are African-Americans among the\nhardest hit by unemployment, but they tend to\noccupy lower paying occupations. For instance,\nwhile in 1993 the median weekly earnings for\nfull time wage and salaried white workers were\nAmerican workers.2 Inheritances are also an\nimportant contributor to wealth diVerences\nbetween African-American and white people.\nIt has been estimated that the contribution of\nlifetime inheritances to wealth diVerences is\ncomparable to that resulting from lifetime\nearning diVerences.3 In addition, among\nAfrican-American family heads, labour force\nparticipation rates are declining and female\nheaded households are rising. African-\nAmericans are over-represented in female\nhouseholder families and in general tend to\nstay in poverty longer than white people.\nThere is an extensive social science and epi-\ndemiological literature on the relation between\npoverty, household income, and health,4\u00ad10\nwhich reports the health impact of unemploy-\nment. Some studies have shown that persons in\npoorer health are more likely to lose their jobs\nand persons in better health are more likely to\nbe re-employed,11\u00ad13 supporting what is called a\nselection process, which may explain--at least\npartially--health diVerences between em-\nployed and unemployed persons. However, a\nquantitative18\u00ad21 studies have provided a wealth\nof empirical evidence relative to the health\neVects of unemployment. An increase in\nmortality rates, depression, substance abuse,\nadmissions to psychiatric hospitals, and vio-\nlence are among the most salient outcomes\nassociated with a rise in unemployment\nlevels.22\u00ad25 In addition, job loss is associated\nwith the loss of health insurance in the USA.\nAlthough the health impact of unemploy-\nment has been widely studied, there is a paucity\nof information on the social interventions that\ncould have a long term protective impact on\nmental and overall health status. In addition,\nethnicity is usually included in unemployment\nanalyses as a controlling variable among other\nsociodemographic characteristics. Rarely are\ndiVerent groups analysed separately, limiting\nour understanding of the diVerent dynamics\nand mechanisms operating in the prediction of\nmental and general health status. Furthermore,\nthe lack of adequate longitudinal data has\nmade it diYcult to study those elements that\ncould have long term protective impacts on\nboth mental health, and family and social\nfunctioning, during the transition from jobless-\nness to stable employment.\nThis paper examines the factors that explain\nthe impact of unemployment on depression\nand overall health perception among both\nAfrican-American and white people separately.\nWe use a longitudinal design to clarify the\ndirection of the relations. We include an analy-\nsis of how public assistance programmes could\nenable people to cope successfully during peri-\nods of unemployment. We explore in detail sex\nCornell University,\nIthaca, New York, USA\nCorrespondence to:\nDr E Rodriguez, Department\nof Policy Analysis and\nHall, Cornell University,\nAccepted for publication\ndiVerences elsewhere (E Rodriguez, et al,\nAmerican Evaluation Association annual meet-\nIt has been argued that the diVerences\nbetween ethnic or racial groups are mostly\nexplained by socioeconomic diVerences,26 27\nbut most studies show that adjusting for socio-\neconomic status reduces but does not eliminate\nhealth disparities among ethnic groups.28\u00ad30\nRace or racism, or both, also plays a part in\ndetermining employment status, education, or\nincome. Research to understand the impact of\nethnicity and socioeconomic status on health\nhas been increasing in recent years31 32 but more\nresearch is still needed if we are to understand\nthe complex interactions of these factors.33\nHere, we analyse African-American and white\npeople separately to investigate possible diVer-\nences between these two groups in the relations\nthat multiple factors have with depression and\ngeneral health assessment. We are interested in\nanalysing the predictors of depression among\neach group independently.\nMethods\nSAMPLE\nWe analysed panel data collected in the\nNational Survey of Families and Households\nunemployment, the receipt of unemployment\ncompensation, perception of health status, and\ning an over-sample of minorities and house-\nholds containing single parent families, step-\nfamilies, recently married couples, and\ncohabiting couples. A total of 2390 African-\nAmerican respondents were included in the\nview of all surviving members of the original\nreinterviewed; this represents an attrition rate\nWe limited our analysis to those respondents\nwho were between 17 and 65 years of age in\nThe total number of respondents included in\nAfrican-American and 6660 white people. We\nused two strategies to better control for a pos-\nsible reverse causation eVect. Firstly, we only\nincluded those that in 1987 reported not\nhaving any physical or mental limitation that\nwould prevent them from working; and sec-\nondly, we controlled for previous depression\nand employment history.\nMEASURES\nWe used two outcome measures. The first\nmeasure was a depression index created from\nthe responses to 15 items of the Center for\nEpidemiological Studies' Depression Scale\n(CES-D) included in the survey; the reliability\nand validity of these items has been reported\nelsewhere.34 The possible response range was 0\nto 105. The second measure was a self reported\nmeasure of perception of overall health status.\nThe outcome measure of how respondents\nwould describe their health compared with\nother people their age consisted on a 5 point\nscale (1-very poor; 5-excellent), and we re-\nduced it to two groups. Good or excellent\nhealth; compared with fair, poor, or very poor\nhealth.\nAn employment variable was constructed\nfrom several variables that asked about re-\nspondents' employment and sources of income\nin 1992. Employed respondents were catego-\nrised into full and part time employed,\ndepending on whether they worked 30 hours or\nmore, or 29 or less a week.\nWhen comparing unemployed people to\nthose employed, one of the most obvious\ncritiques is that, if we included all employed\ninto a single category, we would be putting\ntogether those who have favourable working\nconditions with those that may have unfavour-\nable and even health threatening jobs, (E Rod-\nriguez, et al, International congress on women,\nmaking their comparison with unemployed\npeople less meaningful. Therefore, we divided\nthe employed population (both full and part\ntime workers) into two categories according to\ntheir self reporting of whether or not they were\nsatisfied with their jobs. Satisfaction with paid\njob was rated on a 7 point scale. We put\ntogether those who were satisfied or very satis-\nfied, and the rest were classified as \"others\", or\nless than satisfied with their current employ-\nment situation. We should note that we do not\nhave a clear understanding of the causes that\nare related to satisfaction with employment.\nThose could range from satisfaction with\ncoworkers and supervisors, to schedule prefer-\nences or benefits packages. Nevertheless, we\nconsider that overall satisfaction with employ-\nment should be taken into consideration. In\naddition, we created a diVerent category of\nthose working people who were simultaneously\nreceiving welfare benefits, and followed the\nsame strategy of dividing them into satisfied\nand less than satisfied with their employment.\nGiven the low number of men working and\nreceiving welfare, we only included these\ngroups in the analysis of the female population.\nRespondents who were not working for pay\nor were completely retired were grouped into\ndiVerent categories of unemployment. We\ndefined unemployed as any person not holding\na job, regardless of whether they were actively\nlooking for work or not. Firstly, those looking\nfor work during the four weeks before the\ninterview, and those not actively looking for\nwork were separated into two categories. Then,\neach of those groups were further divided into\nthree categories: (a) people receiving public\nassistance, including AFDC, general assist-\nance, food stamps or energy assistance; (b)\npeople who were receiving income from\nentitlement government benefit programmes,\nsuch as veterans' benefits, unemployment\ncompensation, worker's compensation or sup-\nplemental security income; (c) people who\nwere not receiving any type of income or\neconomic assistance. This last group of non-\nworking people is diYcult to interpret; we do\nnot know how many of those are housewives by\nchoice, students, or simply discouraged unem-\nployed persons not eligible for any kind of\n336 Rodriguez, Allen, Frongillo Jr, et al\nbenefits. No question included in the survey\nallowed us to diVerentiate among those three\ngroups of people included in the same category\nof non-employed and not looking for work\nwithout receiving any benefits.\nThose who were completely retired in 1992\nwere in a separate category.

The type of employment situations was\noperationalised as dummy variables, with the\nsatisfied full time employed category as the\ncomparison group in the equation of our mul-\ntiple regression models described in the results\nsection of our paper.\nIn addition, the following factors were\nincluded in our analysis:\n1 individual characteristics: age, and whether\nor not the respondent reported any physical\nor mental condition that would limit their\nwhether or not the respondent attended any\ntype of training or schooling between 1987\n3 household characteristics: Being a house-\nhold head.

We transformed the index of depres-\nsion to log (depression + 0.05) to better fit the\nassumptions of multiple regression analyses.\nWe used a Box-Cox transformation of the\nincome, assets and debts variables, a frequently\nused procedure to better deal with outlying\nvalues. The transformations were suYcient to\nproduce reasonable residual plots. The appro-\npriate regression diagnostic tests were per-\nformed to assess the fit of the model.\nThe analysis was constructed to make the\nbest use of the longitudinal design to examine\nthe impact of unemployment and other factors\non depression. The outcome variable was\nincluded as a covariate.

In\naddition, diagnostic tests were performed for\ncollinearity and no problems were found. Only\ntwo variables, assets and debts, had a relatively\nTable 1 Depression index (0\u00ad105).

We did not replace any missing values in\nthe dependent variables. For the categorical\nindependent variables we added an option of\n\"no response\" where necessary, in order to\ninclude all respondents in our analysis. For the\ncontinuous independent variables (income,\nassets and debts), we replaced missing values\nby imputing them with the predicted value for\nthe age, sex, ethnic, marital, and occupational\ngroup of the respondent.\nResults\nIndex of depression\nBoth African-American and white women had\nmore symptoms of depression than their male\ncounterparts (see table 1). Among both\nAfrican-American and white women, those\nemployed part time and who reported satisfac-\ntion with their jobs reported lower indices of\ndepression. Among African-American people,\nthe retired and full time employed satisfied\nwith their jobs were next in reporting low\ndepression; the same groups reported lower\ndepression among white people but in reverse\norder.\nAmong African-American people, the most\ndepressed were the unemployed women look-\ning for work while receiving welfare or other\ngovernment benefits, followed by those who\nwere receiving welfare and were either not\nworking and not looking for work, or employed\nbut not satisfied with their jobs. In reporting\nsymptoms of depression, no diVerence was\nfound between welfare recipients not working\nor working but not satisfied with their jobs*;\nonly those who were receiving welfare and sat-\nisfied with their jobs reported slightly lower\ndepression. Among white people, the most\ndepressed were those receiving welfare while\nunemployed, followed by those receiving wel-\nfare and working simultaneously but not satis-\nfied with their jobs.\nIn most employment groups, African-\nAmerican people reported higher indices of\ndepression, with the exception of non-working\nwelfare recipients. Among this group, white\npeople reported slightly higher depression than\nblack people. An interesting diVerence is that\nthe non-working white population (not actively\nlooking for work and not receiving any type of\nbenefits) reported lower depression than work-\ning women (both full and part time employed)\nnot satisfied with their jobs; among African-\nAmerican people, the same group of non-\nworking women (not actively looking for work\nand not receiving any type of benefits) reported\nhigher depression than the dissatisfied em-\nployed.\nGeneral health perceptions\nRegarding general health perceptions, we\nobserve a similar pattern (see table 2). For both\nAfrican-American and white populations,\nthose who report better health status are the\nfull and part time employed satisfied with their\njobs, followed by the welfare recipients who\nwork and are satisfied with their jobs. The\ngroups that report lower health levels are\nunemployed women, especially those not\nactively looking for work and receiving welfare\nbenefits.\nIndex of depression\nTable 3 presents the results of our multiple\nregression model including the variables that\nwe hypothesised could have an impact on\ndepression in 1992, while controlling for occu-\npational status and other variables in 1987.\nThe significant factors for depression observed\nfor all groups include: having a physical or\nmental condition that would limit the ability of\nworking for pay; not being satisfied with their\nrelationships with family and friends; and the\nindex of depression previously reported in\n1987. Age was significant in all groups except\nwhite men. In addition, years of education was\nrelated to lower depression symptoms for all\ngroups, with the exception of African-\nAmerican women.\nSome of the most notable diVerences\nbetween black and white women include the\nimpact of years of education. While for white\nwomen, more years of education was related to\nlower symptoms of depression, years of educa-\ntion was not significant in reducing depression\namong African-American women. The same\ndiVerence is observed regarding the impact of\nattending school between the interview periods\nor separated was significantly related to depres-\nsion among white women, there were no\nsignificant diVerences for African-American\nwomen. In contrast, being the head of the\nhousehold was associated with more symptoms\nof depression among African-American\nwomen but not among white women.\nWe observed other diVerences between\nAfrican-American and white men. Longer\nperiods of unemployment in 1991 was related\nto a lower depression index for white men,\n*The number of repondents working while receiving welfare\nand not satisfied with their jobs was very small and given that it\nis not possible to attribute statistical significance, we do not\nshow them in our tables.\nx Employment situation was related to\ndepression for white men and women, but\nnot consistently for African-American.\nx Household income was not significantly\nrelated to depression after controlling for\nassets and debts.\nx Wealth indicated by total assets was a\npredictor of depression for white but not\nfor African-American people.\nx For all four groups, satisfaction with per-\nsonal relationships (including family and\nfriends) was positively associated with\nbetter health status.\n338 Rodriguez, Allen, Frongillo Jr, et al\nwhile no significant impact was observed\namong African-American men. In contrast\nwith what we see among women, divorced,\nwidower or separated black men were more\nlikely to be depressed than married ones, but\nno significant diVerence was observed among\nwhite men.\nHousehold income was not significantly\nrelated to depression after controlling for assets\nand debts. Total assets were significant for\nwhite people but not for African-Americans.\nDebts were only significant for white women.\nWhile wealth indicated by total assets is a\nsignificant predictor of depression for white\npeople even after controlling for all the other\nvariables included in the model, it is not the\ncase for African-American people. Being a\nhousehold head was related to more symptoms\nof depression among African-American, but\nnot among white people.\nFor African-American women, there was no\nstatistical diVerence among employment\ngroups. After controlling for all the factors\nincluded in our model, the employment situa-\ntion did not influence the likelihood of report-\ning depression for African-American women.\nThe higher index of depression observed\namong the unemployed in relation to those\nsatisfactorily employed (see table 1) was not\nsignificant when other personal and socioeco-\nnomic factors are controlled for in the analysis.\nIn contrast for white women, there was a sig-\nnificantly higher index of depression among\nthose employed but not satisfied with their\njobs. White women also reported more depres-\nsion symptoms while being unemployed and\nreceiving social benefits (mostly welfare).\nWhite and African-American men were\nsignificantly more depressed when unem-\nployed and looking for work, but being unem-\nployed for a longer period during the previous\nyear had a protective eVect on depression for\nwhite men.\nHealth status\nFor all four groups, satisfaction with personal\nrelationships (including family and friends)\nwas positively associated with better health sta-\ntus, and having a physical or mental condition\nthat would limit the ability to work for pay was\ninversely related to health perception as was the\ncase with previous reports of poor health in\nSeveral factors were significant for white\npeople but not for African-American people in\npredicting health status: years of education,\ntotal household assets, and the amount of\nunemployment benefits available at the state\nlevel.\nAge was associated with reporting worse\nhealth status among both groups of men, but it\nwas not significant for women. Interestingly,\nwhite men who were divorced, widowed or\nseparated reported better health status than\nmarried men.\nWhen comparing people with diVerent\nstatus among African-American men was not a\nTable 3 Depression index (1992).

Among the employed white\nwomen, those who were not satisfied with their\njobs also reported worse health.\nDiscussion\nThis study relies on self reported survey data,\nand its strengths and limitations depend\nultimately on factors related to the correct\nassessment of theoretical and statistical as-\nsumptions of the analytical model, the\nadequate--albeit never perfect--way of dealing\nwith missing values and attrition, and the\ncausal inferences made in interpreting the\nWe are confident that our study can facilitate\na better understanding of what aspects of the\nindividual and social environment contribute\nto reducing the negative influence of stressors\nsuch as unemployment. However, interpreta-\ntions of causality should be made cautiously.\nFor instance, people receiving benefits diVer in\nmany ways from people not receiving benefits,\nand these may not be fully controlled through\nthe background covariates used in our analysis.\nOur exclusion criteria, and the factors we con-\ntrol for in our model, should eliminate most of\nthe diVerences among the various groups of\nunemployed people, but uncontrolled variables\ndetermining both unemployment resources\nand health outcomes may still exist. One of the\nstrengths of the study was the use of longitudi-\nnal data to specify the direction of the relation.\nNo significant diVerences in levels of health\nstatus were found between employed and\nunemployed African-American men, nor in\ndepression for African-American women. In\naddition, white men and women not satisfied\nwith their jobs reported higher depression lev-\nels than those satisfied with their jobs and\nunemployed not looking for work report lower\nhealth status.\nIt could be that African-American people do\nnot derive the same satisfaction from employ-\nment that white people do. It is true, however,\nthat the historical imprints of slavery, emanci-\npation, Jim Crow Laws*, segregation, the Civil\nRights Struggle, discrimination, and institu-\ntional racism have aVected the degree to which\na range of coping strategies have been adopted\nby African-American people.

However, it\nwould be precipitous to extrapolate this finding\nto the new situation created by the recent wel-\nfare reform, legislation, in which working will\nbe a compulsory requirement for a larger\nsegment of welfare recipients.\nYears of education was a significant predictor\nof lower depression and better health status\namong white people, but it was not related to\nhealth status among African-American men or\nwomen, and significantly related to depression\nonly among men. Once more, it could be that\nfactors not included in our model (for example,\nracial discrimination) are a reality in the lives of\nAfrican-Americans, so that the gains obtained\nby education are not as directly observable as\namong white people. The same could be said\nabout the lack of significant impact of house-\nhold assets for African-Americans, while for\nwhite people more wealth significantly predicts\nlower depression and better health status. In all\nmodels income was not significant when wealth\nand assets are controlled for in this study,\nwhich suggests that total family assets may be a\nbetter measure of social class than household\nincome.\nIn conclusion, our study challenges some of\nthe conventional knowledge when applied to\nAfrican-American people. While education has\na clear impact on depression and well being\namong white people, why is it that the\nassociation is less significant for African-\nAmericans, and especially for African-\nAmerican women? While reporting satisfaction\nwith employment is significantly associated\nwith better mental health (in comparison with\nthose not satisfied with their work) among\nwhite people, why is it that we do not see a sig-\nnificant diVerence among African-American\npeople when we control for the other factor in\nour model? And why are greater assets\nassociated with better mental health and well\nbeing among white people but not among\nAfrican-American people?\nIn this paper we speculate about possible\nanswers to these questions, but more important\nthan our own speculations and interpretations\nare the questions themselves. They open the\nway to a--if not new--very necessary line of\ninquiry to better understand the dynamics of\nhealth and illness among the diVerent groups\nin the population. By continuing to study these\nissues and pursuing the questions we will be\nable to better understand the increasing health\nand mortality diVerences between African-\nAmerican and white people observed in the\nsame occupational categories.39 Only then can\nwe encourage the best ways of fostering the well\nbeing of all segments of the population.\nWe would like to thank Cornell Agricultural Experiment Station\nfor the award of a Hatch Grant that made possible this research\neVort.
