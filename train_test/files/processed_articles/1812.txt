Although levels of VOCs in blood were positively correlated with the corresponding air levels, the strength of\nassociation (R2) varied from 0.02 (ethylbenzene) to 0.68 (1,4-DCB). Also the blood\u00adair relationships of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes\n(BTEX) were influenced by smoking, exposure\u00adsmoking interactions, and by gender, age, and BMI, whereas those of the other VOCs were not.\nInterestingly, the particular exposure\u00adsmoking interaction for benzene was different from those for toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes. Whereas\nsmokers retained more benzene in their blood at increasing exposure levels, they retained less toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes at increasing exposure\nlevels. Investigators should consider interaction effects of exposure levels and smoking when exploring the blood\u00adair relationships of the BTEX\ncompounds in the general population.\nKeywords: biomarker, blood, NHANES, volatile organic compounds.\nIntroduction\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are widely used in the\nmanufacture of building and furnishing materials and in\nconsumer products, such as paints and cleaning agents, and\nare released from gasoline and other fuels (Wallace et al.,\n1989). Humans are typically exposed to higher concentra-\ntions of VOCs indoors than outdoors (Wallace, 1987a).\nFormaldehyde can be emitted from carpet, cushions, and\nparticleboard, tetrachloroethene from dry cleaned clothing\nand fabric protectors, toluene and xylenes from paints,\nvarnishes, and adhesives, benzene from stored fuels and\ncigarette smoke, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) from\nmoth repellents and deodorizers (USEPA, 2007). Even tap\nwater can be a source of VOCs, such as chloroform, a\nproduct of chlorinated water treatment (Stern and Tardiff,\na fuel oxygenate that contaminates water supplies (Prah\net al., 2004). While air concentrations of VOCs are typically\nat parts per million (p.p.m.) levels in the workplace, they\nrarely exceed parts per billion (p.p.b.) levels in the general\nenvironment (Rappaport and Kupper, 2004). In fact, some\nof the highest levels of environmental (nonoccupational)\nexposures to VOCs occur during gasoline refueling, where\nbenzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes (BTEX) can\nachieve air concentrations in the low p.p.m. range for a few\np.p.m. air concentrations of MTBE have also been reported\nduring gasoline refueling (Vayghani and Weisel, 1999).\nHuman studies have consistently demonstrated that a range\nof health disorders is associated with VOC exposures,\nincluding asthma and hematopoietic malignancies (IARC,\nlargely upon results from occupational populations exposed to\n1.

Indeed, because personal\nair concentrations of VOCs are generally very low (p.p.b.) and\npoorly characterized in environmental epidemiology studies,\nthe links between VOC exposures and environmental diseases,\nsuch as childhood asthma or leukemia, have not been well\nelucidated in the general population (Pappas et al., 2000;\n2006). Recent applications of passive monitors for measuring\nVOCs in ambient air suggest that it may be feasible to obtain\npersonal exposure data from large numbers of subjects in\nfuture epidemiology studies of the general public (Adgate\nIn the past two decades, biological measurements (bio-\nmarkers) have been considered as alternatives to air sampling\nfor assessing chemical exposures because they account for all\npossible exposure pathways (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, and\ndermal uptake) and individual susceptibility (Mutti, 1999;\nstudies, levels of VOCs and their metabolites in breath, blood\nand urine tend to be highly correlated with the corresponding\nFustinoni et al., 2005). However, relationships between\nconcentrations of VOCs in the general environment and the\ncorresponding biomarker levels have been ambiguous (Lin\nthat benzene in personal air and exhaled breath were highly\ncorrelated (r\u00bc 0.77 for the logged levels) following short\n(1\u00ad10 min) exposures at levels ranging from approximately\nrecommend exhaled breath as a surrogate for VOC exposure\nat levels less than 1p.p.m. (Wallace et al., 1996). Similarly, our\nprevious study of benzene biomarkers found that albumin\nadducts of some reactive benzene metabolites, namely, benzene\noxide and 1,4-benzoquinone, were clearly related to occupa-\ntional benzene exposures above 1 p.p.m. but not to exposures\nbelow 1 p.p.m., where background sources came into play\ntrends between levels of five urinary metabolites and benzene\nexposures that became increasingly obscured as air levels\ndecreased from p.p.m. to p.p.b. levels. The objective of the\ncurrent study was to investigate the relationships between levels\nof nine common VOCs in blood and personal air samples from\nthe general (US) population, using data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999\u00ad\n2000 (CDCa). The effects of several factors, namely, smoking,\nage, gender, alcohol consumption, and race/ethnicity, on the\nblood\u00adair relationships were also examined.\nMaterials and Methods\nData source\nsectional household survey of the noninstitutionalized US\ncivilian population. (These data were made publicly available\nParticipant enrollment used a stratified, multistage, prob-\nability-based sampling design. Demographic data were\nobtained using questionnaires, interviews, and health exam-\ninations, and biological samples were collected in partici-\npants' homes and in a mobile examination center. Detailed\ninformation on the design and operation of NHANES has\nbeen reported previously (CDCb). Levels of VOCs in air and\nblood were measured for only a subsample of participants in\nStudy population\nWe restricted our analysis to participants aged 20\u00ad59 years\nwith valid measurement of VOCs (no missing data), stratified\nby smoking status. Of 662 participants with measurements of\nat least one VOC of interest, 287 participants were excluded\nfrom the final analysis due to missing blood measurements,\n12 due to missing or inadequate airborne measurements, and\n9 due to missing information about smoking status. This left\na total of 354 subjects with complete data. Note that\nalthough questionnaire information on smoking status (``do\nyou currently smoke?'') was available, serum cotinine was\nused as the primary surrogate of smoking status (Wei et al.,\n2001). Subjects with levels of serum cotinine greater than\n14 ng/ml were classified as smokers, the others as non-\nsmokers. In the absence of a valid serum cotinine measure-\nment (0.8% of 354 eligible participants), smoking status was\ndetermined from questionnaire responses.\nMeasurement of airborne and blood VOCs\nnumerous VOCs, including the BTEX compounds, several\nhalogenated compounds, and some oxygen-containing com-\npounds. We restricted our analyses to nine VOCs that were\nmeasured in both blood and air samples, namely, benzene,\nchloroform, 1,4-DCB, ethylbenzene, MTBE, tetrachloro-\nethene, toluene, and m-/p-, and o-xylenes. (Note that\nm- and p-xylenes were measured as one analyte in the gas\nchromatography\u00admass spectrometry (GC\u00adMS) analysis.)\nThe numbers of available measurements of these VOCs in\nair and blood and the corresponding limits of detection\n(LODs) are summarized in Table 1. The LODs were typically\nat concentrations of a few mg/m3 in air and o1 ng/ml in\nblood. Trichloroethene was excluded from analysis because\nonly 25% of the air measurements and 11% of the blood\nmeasurements were above the respective LOD (data not\nshown). Details of the exposure assessment have been\nreported elsewhere (CDCb). In brief, air exposures were\nmeasured for a period of 48\u00ad72 h with passive personal\nmonitors (Model 3520 Organic Vapor Monitors, 3 M, St.\nPaul, Minnesota, USA). All air samples were refrigerated at\n41C prior to solvent extraction and analysis via GC\u00adMS. The\nVOC levels in whole blood were determined via GC\u00adMS of\nVOCs in air and blood from the general population\nLin et al.\nTable 1.

Also, we applied natural\nlogarithmic transformations to satisfy normality assumptions\nfor all air and blood concentrations. We assessed group\ndifferences with the Student's t-test for continuous variables\nand the Cochran\u00adMantel\u00adHaenszel w2-test for categorical\nvariables. We used simple and multiple linear regression\nmodels to investigate crude and adjusted relationships\nbetween air and blood VOCs. The derived R2 value was\nused to evaluate the strengths of associations in regression\nmodels. Covariates included in the multiple regression models\nwere selected based upon preliminary univariate analyses and\nfindings from previous studies. All percentages and results\nfrom regression models represent population-weighted\nvalues.\nResults\nThe demographic characteristics of the subjects are summa-\nsmokers and 265 nonsmokers, equivalent to an estimated US\nadjusting for sample weights. Ages differed significantly\nbetween smokers and nonsmokers (P \u00bc 0.03) but showed no\ntrend across age categories. Also, current alcohol users (Z1\ndrink per day), males, and Mexican Americans were more\nlikely to smoke, but the differences were not significant\nbetween smokers and nonsmokers.\nThe distributions of VOC concentrations (GMs and\ninterquartile ranges) in both air and blood are shown in\nTable 3, stratified by smoking status. (Note that Table 3\nTable 3.

Significantly higher levels of airborne tetrachloro-\nethene were found in nonsmokers (Po0.05). When all\nsubjects with and without blood measurements of benzene\nwere included (n \u00bc 619), the GM level of benzene in air was\nthan nonsmokers (GM \u00bc 2.81 mg/m3) (data not shown). In\ncontrast to the air measurements, blood levels of all BTEX\ncompounds were significantly elevated in smokers compared\nBoth simple and covariate-adjusted relationships between\nair levels and blood levels of VOCs (in log scale) are shown in\nTable 4. Referring first to the simple regression models\n(unadjusted), levels of all VOCs in blood were positively\nassociated with the corresponding air concentrations, and\nthese associations were significant except for ethylbenzene\nHowever, the corresponding R2 values varied widely, from\nsmoking status. This indicates that large proportions of the\nvariation in the levels of blood VOCs were related to factors\nother than the corresponding air concentrations. The\namounts of explained variability of unadjusted relationships\nbetween blood and airborne VOC levels tended to be higher\namong nonsmokers (median R2 \u00bc 0.24) than among smokers\n(median R2 \u00bc 0.14), but this difference was not statistically\nsignificant (P \u00bc 0.12, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Following\nadjustment for age, gender, BMI, race/ethnicity, and alcohol\nconsumption, the estimated regression coefficients (bs) did\nnot change appreciably (o15%) (Table 4). On the other\nhand, the values of R2 increased considerably in both\nsmokers (B160%) and nonsmokers (B40%) after adjust-\nment for these covariates, although this difference in R2\nbetween smokers and nonsmokers was still not significant\n(P \u00bc 0.66, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Using models either\nwith or without adjustment for covariates, values of R2 were\ngreater among nonsmokers than among smokers for all\nVOCs except benzene, chloroform, and MTBE. This points\nto the potential for smoking to confound or modify\nrelationships between exposures to VOCs and the corre-\nsponding internal doses if smoking status is not included in\nregression models.\nGiven significant differences between smokers and non-\nsmokers in certain demographic characteristics such as BMI,\nwe also investigated the possible combined effect of smoking\nand the other covariates on relationships between VOC levels\nin blood and air. As shown in Table 5, the values of\nTable 4.

These combined effects\nare illustrated in Figure 1, where the covariate-adjusted\nrelationships clearly differed between smokers and non-\nsmokers for BTEX. On the other hand, values of R2\nincreased only marginally for chloroform, 1,4-DCB, MTBE,\nand tetrachloroethene, following adjustment for smoking\nand other covariates. Table 5 also includes results from a\nstudy of VOC levels in blood and air among Minnesota\nchildren by Sexton et al. (2005), who reported unadjusted\nvalues of R2. Note that, aside from toluene, our findings\nfrom unadjusted analyses (adults aged 20\u00ad65 years) are\ncomparable to the results from that earlier study in children.\nGiven the combined effects of smoking and other\ncovariates on the relationships between BTEX levels in\nblood and air, more detailed multivariable analyses were\nconducted for these compounds. As summarized in Table 6,\nsignificant or marginally significant interaction effects be-\ntween smoking and air levels were observed for all BTEX\nperformed in log scale, the estimated regression coefficients,\nshown in Table 6, are multipliers which express fold increases\n(or decreases) in blood levels of a particular BTEX\ncompound at a given air concentration relative to a reference\ngroup. For instance, at a benzene concentration of 1 mg/m3\nthe predicted level of benzene in blood would be 2.48 (i.e.,\ne0.908) times greater in smokers than in nonsmokers\nFigure 1. Relationships between levels in blood and air for selected VOCs (a) benzene (b) ethylbenzene (c) toluene (d) m,p-xylene (e) a-xylene\n(adjusted for age, BMI, gender, race/ethnicity, and alcohol consumption).\nVOCs in air and blood from the general population\nLin et al.\n(reference group); but at a benzene concentration of 10 mg/m3\nthe level of benzene in blood would be 6.35 (i.e., e1.85) times\ngreater in smokers. This suggests that smokers not only were\nexposed to benzene in cigarette smoke, but also retained\nincreasingly more benzene from the environment than\nnonsmokers as exposure levels increased. This is in contrast\nto results from the other BTEX compounds, where all the\ninteraction effects between smoking and exposure were\nnegative, indicating that smokers retained decreasing\namounts of toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes at\nincreasing exposure levels. Although none of the other\ncovariates (gender, BMI, age, alcohol consumption, and\nrace/ethnicity) reached significance in the full regression\nmodels, we observed that blood VOC levels increased with\nBMI and were higher in females and in younger subjects\n(aged 20\u00ad29 years) after controlling for exposure and other\nexplanatory variables.\nDiscussion\nIn this study of environmental exposures to nine VOCs, we\nfound significant associations between the levels of all\ncompounds in blood and air, except for ethylbenzene and\ntoluene in smoking subjects. The strengths of associations\nbetween the logged levels of individual VOCs in blood and\nair varied greatly, with unadjusted values of R2 ranging\nfinding is generally consistent with results from a recent\nstudy of children in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA (Sexton\nWe observed that the relationships between levels of\nindividual VOCs in air and blood were modified by smoking\nfor the BTEX compounds but not for chloroform, 1,4-DCB,\nMTBE, and tetrachloroethene. Although smoking has long\nbeen recognized as an important source of exposure to\nbenzene and other VOCs in the general population (Wallace\nsuggest that smoking also modified the amounts of the BTEX\ncompounds that were retained in the body at a given\nexposure concentration. Interestingly, the retention of\nbenzene increased with increasing exposure among smokers,\nwhile retention of toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes\ndecreased with increasing exposure among smokers. To our\nknowledge, this behavior of BTEX compounds has not been\nreported heretofore and should be further investigated.\nCompared to smoking, the other explanatory variables in\nthe database had only weak effects (Table 6) for the BTEX\ncompounds. The observation that females had higher levels\nof BTEX in their blood at a given exposure is consistent with\nfindings from toxicokinetic models and a controlled human\ninhalation study of 1,3-butadiene, where females retained\nTable 6.

Since the BTEX compounds, as well as\n1,3-butadiene, are lipophilic substances, this finding probably\nrelates to the increased proportion of body fat in females\ncompared to males. Increased body fat may also explain the\ntrends toward increasing levels of BTEX compounds in\nblood with increasing BMI, after adjusting for exposure,\nespecially for obese subjects (BMI 430) (Table 6). The\nmarginal effect of decreasing blood BTEX levels with age is\nalso comparable to results from controlled 1,3-butadiene\nexposures (Lin et al., 2001), and may reflect a decrease in the\nefficiency of pulmonary gas exchange with increasing age,\net al., 2006; American Society of Anesthesiologists).\nNeither smoking nor the other covariates significantly\naltered the relationships between levels in air and blood for\nchloroform, 1,4-DCB, MTBE, and tetrachloroethene. This\nmay point to the contribution of sources and/or exposure\npathways other than inhaled air and cigarette smoke to these\ncompounds. For instance, in addition to inhalation of\nchloroform emitted from heated water (Giardino and\nAndelman, 1996), exposure to chloroform can also occur\nalthough ingestion and dermal absorption (Lindstrom et al.,\ninhalation can become disproportionately important at low\nlevels of environmental exposure (Johnson et al., 2007).\nParticular exposure profiles can also affect relationships\nbetween VOC levels in blood and air as governed by the\noperative toxicokinetic processes. Since VOCs have short\nbiological half-lives, levels in blood tend to reflect exposures\nwhich occurred in the few hours immediately preceding blood\ncollection. Yet, the air levels in the NHANES study were\nmeasured with passive personal monitors over periods of 2 or\n3 days. Thus, if exposures changed greatly over time scales of\nhours, air and blood levels in the cross-sectional NHANES\ndatabase would become increasingly discordant. In a long-\nitudinal study of VOC exposures, Sexton et al. (2005) noted\nthat air levels of 1,4-DCB were very consistent in their\nsubjects from day to day; this could explain the particularly\nstrong relationship between blood and air levels of 1,4-DCB\nin both Sexton's study and our results from the NHANES\ndata (Table 5).\n"
