Only 25% of the patients reported discussing resuscitation preferences\nwith their physician, but discussion of preferences was not significantly associated with higher agreement between the\npatient and physician. Of the 600 patients who responded to the resuscitation question again 2 months later, 19% had\nchanged their preferences, including 14% of those who initially wanted resuscitation (69 of 480) and 40% of those who\ninitially did not (48 of 120). The physician's perception of the patient's hospital resuscitation preference was correct for\n84% of patients who had a stable preference and 68% of those who did not.\nConclusions--Almost one quarter of patients hospitalized with severe heart failure expressed a preference not to be\nresuscitated. The physician's perception of the patient's preference was not accurate in about one quarter of the cases,\nbut communication was not associated with greater agreement between the patient and the physician. A substantial\nproportion of patients who did not want to be resuscitated changed their minds within 2 months of discharge.\nKey Words: resuscitation  patients  heart failure\nThe end of life for patients with severe congestive heart\nfailure is often characterized by repeated hospitalizations\nand a progressively declining quality of life. Although many\npatients with poor prognoses refuse medical interventions,1\npatients with severe congestive heart failure usually receive\nmaximal medical therapy until death. The prevalence of do-not-\nresuscitate (DNR) orders in patients with severe congestive heart\nfailure has been reported to be 5%,1 and patients with conges-\ntive heart failure who die in the hospital commonly undergo\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation.2 Although it is not known why\nDNR orders are written infrequently in this population, physi-\ncians discuss resuscitation issues less often with patients with\nsevere congestive heart failure than with patients who have other\nterminal diseases such as AIDS or cancer.1\nUntil recently there has been very little information about the\nresuscitation preferences of patients with severe congestive heart\nfailure. To address this issue in detail, we used data obtained as\npart of the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for\nOutcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) project,3 a\nprospective multicenter study of prognoses and preferences for\ntreatment for severely ill patients, including individuals hospi-\ntalized with an exacerbation of severe congestive heart failure\n(New York Heart Association class IV, or clinical heart failure\nand an ejection fraction 20%). In the SUPPORT project,\npatients and their physicians were asked about the patient's\nhealth, quality of life, daily activity level, functional status,\nprognosis, and resuscitation preferences.\nFrom the Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine and the Section of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Department of\nEpidemiology and Public Health, Yale School of Medicine and the Yale-New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, New Haven,\nConn (H.M.K.); the Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Mass (R.S.P., M.B.H., R.B.D.); the Center for\nGerontology and Health Care Research, Brown University, Providence, RI (J.M.T.); the UCLA School of Medicine, UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles,\nCalif (P.B.); the Marshfield Medical Research Foundation/Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield, Wis (S.K.B., H.V.); the Duke University Medical Center,\nDurham, NC (R.M.C., L.H.M.); Case Western Reserve University, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (A.F.C.); George Washington\nUniversity Medical Center, Washington, DC (J.L.); and the Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, Calif (L.G.).\nharlan.krumholz@yale.edu\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nMethods\nStudy Design\nPatients in SUPPORT had 1 of 9 high-mortality conditions: acute\nexacerbation of congestive heart failure, acute respiratory failure,\nacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic\nliver disease, nontraumatic coma, colon cancer metastatic to liver,\nstage III/IV non\u00adsmall cell carcinoma of the lung, multiple organ\nsystem failure with malignancy, and multiple organ failure and\nsepsis.4 Patients, their designated surrogate decision makers (usually\nfamily members), and physicians were interviewed at several points\nin the patient's hospitalization. The study was conducted at 5\nhospitals: Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Mass; MetroHealth Medical\nCenter, Cleveland, Ohio; Duke University Medical Center, Durham,\nNC; Marshfield Clinic/St Joseph's Hospital, Marshfield, Wis; and\nthe University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, Calif.\nThe coordinating center was the Intensive Care Unit Research Unit\nat the George Washington University Medical Center.\npreferences, decisions, and outcomes of severely ill hospitalized\nprovided information about patient prognoses and preferences for\nend-of-life care and a nurse-based intervention to facilitate commu-\nnication. The program failed to increase the frequency of DNR\norders or to reduce the number of days it took to write them.\nFurthermore, there were no secular trends in DNR order writing\nphases were combined for this analysis.3\nPatient Sample\nSubjects in this analysis were restricted to patients with an acute\nexacerbation of symptoms of chronic congestive heart failure as the\nprimary reason for hospital admission or transfer to an intensive care\nunit and at least 1 of the following 3 conditions: (1) a history of\nsevere congestive heart failure at baseline (New York Heart Asso-\nciation class IV) despite being treated medically with 2 or more of\nthe following classes of drugs: diuretics, vasodilators, and ACE\ninhibitors; (2) a definite history of New York Heart Association class\nIV congestive heart failure at hospital admission; or (3) documen-\ntation of a left ventricular ejection fraction 20%. Patients were\nexcluded from the study if they had any of the following conditions:\nsevere chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high output conges-\ntive heart failure, septic shock, primary acute renal failure, circula-\ntory overload caused by excessive administration of fluids, cardiac\nsurgery scheduled within 24 hours, congestive heart failure caused\nby valvular heart disease, or a thoracotomy on the same admission\nand before study entry.\nClinical Data\nClinical data were obtained by chart review and included cardiac\nhistory; comorbid conditions; information required to calculate an\nacute physiology score (based on the APACHE III scoring system5);\nand documentation of decisions related to the use of life-sustaining\ntherapy, including the presence of a DNR order.

A previously published\nmodel of 180-day mortality in SUPPORT was used to determine an\n\"objective\" measure of the patient's prognosis.6 This model includes\nthe following variables: diagnosis, age, number of days in the\nhospital before study entry, presence of cancer, neurological func-\ntion, and 11 physiological measures.\nPatient Interviews\nPatients were approached to be interviewed between days 3 and 6\nafter enrollment in the study and 2 months after discharge. Patients\npassing the test of cognitive function7 were then questioned about\ntheir resuscitation preferences, probability of survival, functional\nstatus, symptoms, quality of life, and sociodemographics. Patients\nwere asked, \"What are the chances that you will live for 2 months or\nmore (and 6 months or more) if the current plan of care stays the\nsame?\" Patients also were asked, \"What are the chances that you will\nbe able to take care of yourself 2 months (and 6 months) from now?\"\nPatients were asked to rate their quality of life (\"How would you rate\nthe overall quality of your life at present?\") on a 5-point scale from\nexcellent to poor.\nFunctional status in the 2 weeks before admission was assessed by\na revised version of the Katz Activities of Daily Living score8 on the\nbasis of the ability to perform bathing, dressing, toileting, transfer,\ncontinence, and feeding. A summary score was calculated, with 0\nindicating independence in all categories. Activity status 2 weeks\nbefore admission was estimated by a revised version of the Duke\nActivity Status Index,8 which is a modification of the Specific\nActivity Scale.9 Activity status was defined as the ability of patients\nto perform personal, household, and recreational activities associated\nwith known metabolic costs.\nThe question about resuscitation was as follows: \"As you probably\nknow, there are a number of things that doctors can do to try to\nrevive someone whose heart has stopped beating, which usually\nincludes a machine to help breathing. Thinking of your current\ncondition, what would you want your doctors to do if your heart ever\nstops beating? Would you want your doctors to try to revive you, or\nwould you want your doctors not to try to revive you?\" Only patients\nwho explicitly and unequivocally answered negatively were classi-\nfied as not wanting resuscitation because, in practice, patients with\nan equivocal response would be resuscitated. The test-retest reliabil-\nity (exact agreement) of this measure in the SUPPORT study,\nassessed within 24 hours of the initial interview for a subsample of\nPhysician Interview\nThe physician chiefly responsible for each study patient was inter-\nviewed. The interviews collected information about physician char-\nacteristics, perceptions of their patient's preferences, and perceptions\nof their patient's prognosis and quality of life. Physicians were\nasked, \"What do you think the patient would want you to do if he or\nshe had a cardiopulmonary arrest?\"\nStatistical Analysis\nIn bivariable analyses, Student's t test was used to compare contin-\nuous, normally distributed variables, and nonparametric tests were\nused to compare variables that were not normally distributed. In the\nmultivariable analysis, 2 stepwise multiple logistic regression mod-\nels were developed. Variables were retained in the model if the\nregression coefficient was significantly associated at the 0.10 on\nthe basis of the Wald test. Each model was adjusted for study site by\nincluding indicator variables.\nThe first model predicted patient preferences not to be resusci-\ntated. The following variables were considered in the construction of\nthe model: age (years); sex; race; acute physiology score on hospital\nday 3; whether the patient lived alone before admission; activities of\ndaily living dependencies based on patient status 2 weeks before\nadmission; modified Duke Activity Status Index based on patient\nstatus 2 weeks before admission; number of comorbidities; the\npatient's estimate of living for 2 more months; the patient's estimate\nof living independently in 2 months; the patient's assessment of his\nor her quality of life; and whether the patient reported that he or she\nwas a transplantation candidate. The model was adjusted for study\nsite and the patient's estimated probability of surviving 2 months on\nthe basis of the SUPPORT prognostic model.6 We repeated the\nprocedure after excluding patients who responded that they did not\nknow about their resuscitation preference.\nThe second model determined the factors most strongly associated\nwith a physician's perception that a patient did not want to be\nresuscitated. There were 750 phase 1 and 2 patients who responded\nto the resuscitation question and whose physicians were interviewed\nand responded to the resuscitation question. To adjust for the\nphysician's preference if he or she were in the patient's situation, we\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nrestricted the analysis to the 339 phase 1 patients with information on\ntheir preferences and the matched physician perception questions\nbecause that question was asked at a later time in phase 2.\nThe same method of model construction was used as above except\nthat the following additional variables were considered: the physi-\ncian's resuscitation preference if he or she were in the patient's\ncondition; the physician's perception of the patient's quality of life\n(excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor); whether the physician was\na cardiologist; the physician's age; the physician's sex; the physi-\ncian's year of graduation from medical school; whether the physician\nplanned to care for the patient after hospital discharge; the length of\ntime that the physician had known the patient (1 week versus 1\nweek); the physician's perception of the likelihood that the patient\nwould live 2 months (0% to 100%); and the physician's perception\nof the patient's belief about his or her quality of life (excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor). We repeated the procedure after excluding\nthe variable describing what the physician would do if he or she were\nin the patient's position.\nThe agreement between patients' own reports of and the physi-\ncians' estimates of these resuscitation preferences, prognoses, and\nquality of life was evaluated by use of the kappa coefficient.9 A\nkappa coefficient 0.40 represents a moderate or greater degree of\nagreement beyond that expected by chance.11 The associations of\npatient and physician characteristics with agreement between the\npatient and the physician were tested with 2 tests.\nFor all analyses, when information on income or level of educa-\ntion was not available, we imputed values using previously described\nmethods.12 When information on functional status and activity status\nwas not available from the patients, we used calibrated surrogates'\nreports of the patients' functional and activity status. When infor-\nmation was not available from patients or their surrogates, we\nResults\nStudy Sample\nincluding 1404 patients with an exacerbation of chronic\ncongestive heart failure. The study sample consisted of 936\npatients with congestive heart failure who participated in the\nstudy interview and responded to the question about resusci-\ntation. The interviewed patients were younger, were less ill,\nand had a lower in-hospital mortality than patients who did\nnot participate in the interview, but they were not different\nwith respect to sex, history of myocardial infarction, number\nof comorbid conditions, or ejection fraction.\nPatient Resuscitation Preferences\nwish to be resuscitated in the case of a cardiac arrest, 646\n(69%) definitely did want to be resuscitated, and 75 (8%)\nwere unsure whether they wanted a full resuscitation effort.\nFactors associated with resuscitation preference are summa-\nrized in Table 1.\nIn a multivariable model (Table 2), a strong predictor of the\npatient's preference not to be resuscitated was the patient's\nperception of a worse prognosis (expressed as likelihood of\nliving 2 months). Other factors that were significantly asso-\nciated with not wanting to be resuscitated included worse\nactivity status in the 2 weeks before admission, higher\nincome, and older age. The model did not change substan-\ntially if patients who expressed uncertainty about their resus-\ncitation preferences were excluded.\nOf the 936 patients in the sample, 600 also responded to the\nresuscitation questions at 2 months after discharge. Overall,\n19% did not have a stable preference, including 14% of the\npatients (69 of 480) who initially expressed a preference for\nPhysician Perceptions of Patient Preferences\nof SUPPORT. Of these, 339 patients had matching physician\ninterviews with complete data collection for the analysis,\nwhich were conducted between days 3 and 6 (see \"Meth-\nods\"). In 62 (18%) of the interviews, physicians believed that\ntheir patients did not want to be resuscitated.\nIn the multivariable analysis, the strongest independent\ncorrelate of the physician's perception that the patient did not\nwant to be resuscitated was the physician's resuscitation\npreference if he or she were in the patient's condition.\nPhysicians who would not want to be resuscitated if in the\npatient's condition commonly thought that the patient would\nOther factors that were associated with the physician's\nperception that the patient did not want to be resuscitated\nincluded older patient age (adjusted OR for each year, 1.08;\npatient's view of his or her quality of life as fair or poor\ncompared with excellent, very good, or good (adjusted OR,\nof a worse chance for survival at 2 months (adjusted OR for\neach percent decrease in predicted 2-month chance of sur-\npreference (to the interviewer) that he or she did not want to\nDropping the variable describing the physician's preference if\nhe or she were in the patient's position from the model did not\nsubstantially affect the association of the other independent\nvariables with the patient's preference.\nPatient and Physician Agreement\nresponded to the resuscitation question reported having told\ntheir physician about their resuscitation preferences.

Of the 11 patients who stated that they did not\nwant to be resuscitated, 5 had DNR orders written and were\nnot resuscitated. The remaining 6 patients had resuscitation\nattempted, and 1 patient survived to hospital discharge.\nDiscussion\nThis prospective study of resuscitation preferences in patients\nwho were admitted with an exacerbation of severe heart\nfailure reveals the marked complexity of this issue. About one\nquarter of the patients who were interviewed expressed a\npreference not to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac\narrest. This preference was expressed to an impartial inter-\nviewer between 3 and 6 days after being enrolled in the study.\nSeveral predictors of this preference were identified in a\nmultivariable analysis, including study site, older age, more\nlimited functional status, a lower estimate of prognosis by the\npatient, and higher income.\nMost of the time, physicians correctly predicted the pa-\ntient's resuscitation preference. Nevertheless, for about 1 in 4\npatients, physicians did not have an accurate perception of the\npatient's resuscitation preference. However, physicians were\nmuch more likely to have an accurate perception of the\nresuscitation preferences of patients who subsequently did\nnot change their minds. Among patients with stable prefer-\nences, physicians did not accurately perceive the preference\nin only 1 of every 6 patients. Lack of communication between\npatients and their physicians may have been expected to\ncontribute to the disagreement. Despite the fact that these\npatients were very ill and their physicians expected many of\nthem to die within the next 2 months, we found that only\nabout one quarter of the patients and physicians reported that\nthey had discussed resuscitation issues. This lack of commu-\nnication has been observed in other settings,13,14 despite\nevidence that patients want to have these discussions.15\nHowever, we found that the physician's perception of the\npatient's preference was not more likely to be accurate among\nthose who reported communicating with the physician. More-\nover, the SUPPORT intervention, designed to improve com-\nmunication about these issues between patients and physi-\ncians, failed to change practice.\nDespite the complexity of this issue, our study did reveal\nsome interesting findings. Except for patient age, the correlates\nof the physician's belief that the patient did not want to be\nresuscitated differed from those predictors of patients' prefer-\nences. The most important predictor of the physician's belief that\nthe patient did not want to be resuscitated was the physician's\nown preference not to be resuscitated if he or she were in the\npatient's condition. The patient's preference not to be resusci-\ntated was also a significant predictor, as was the physician's\nperception of the patient's prognosis and quality of life.\nAlthough the age of the patient was an important factor\nassociated with both the patients' preferences for resuscita-\ntion and the physicians' beliefs about the patients' resuscita-\ntion preferences, the physicians may have placed greater\nemphasis on age than the patients did. The age of the patient\nwas strongly related to the likelihood of discordance between\npatients and physicians. Older age was associated with a\nhigher likelihood that physicians would incorrectly perceive\nthe patient's resuscitation preference.\nThe physician's perception of the patient's quality of life was\nassociated with his or her belief about the patient's preference.\nHowever, the patients' assessments of their own quality of life\n(with a single-item question) were not related to their own\nresuscitation preferences. Other studies have also found that the\npatient's quality of life has not been related to resuscitation\npreferences. Among patients who had experienced medical\nintensive care, Patrick and colleagues16 found no significant\nassociation between the willingness of patients to undergo\nintensive care and their quality of life as measured by the\nPerceived Quality of Life Scale. In another study among outpa-\ntients, Uhlmann and Pearlman17 found that neither global quality\nof life nor selected dimensions of quality of life, including\naspects of social, physical, emotional, and intellectual function-\ning, were associated with resuscitation preferences.\nThese studies of quality of life and resuscitation preferences\nsuggest either that the instruments that measure quality of life are\nnot sensitive to factors that influence decisions about resuscita-\ntion or that patients consider other factors when making this\ndecision. Zweibel18 has suggested that patients do not consider\nabstract concepts such as current quality of life when making\ndecisions about life-sustaining therapy but rather focus on\nconcrete factors such as the presence and level of chronic pain,\ntheir immediate prognosis, and their likelihood of self-care. This\nobservation regarding prognosis appears to be true of patients\nwith severe congestive heart failure.\nPhysician characteristics were generally not associated\nwith the degree of agreement with patient preferences.

Interestingly, the\ncharacteristic that was significantly associated with agree-\nment was specialty, with cardiologists performing better than\nthe other physicians.\nOur overall findings are very consistent with findings from\nthe overall SUPPORT population. In the study by Phillips and\ncolleagues,10 28% of the SUPPORT population was reported\nnot to want to be resuscitated. In their multivariable analysis,\npatients with congestive heart failure were more likely to\nwant to be resuscitated. In the overall sample, as in our group,\nTABLE 3.

Lynn and colleagues19,20 have\nshown that estimates of prognosis for critically ill patients\nmay not accurately predict which patients with heart failure\nwill die soon. Many patients with heart failure may die of a\nfatal arrhythmia at a time when they are clinically stable.\nConsequently, patients and physicians, acknowledging the\nrisk of sudden and unexpected death in this condition, may\nneed to discuss issues about death and treatment at a time that\nmay not be perceived as close to the time of death. If\nphysicians and patients wait until the short-term prognosis\nbecomes so grave that death is imminent, they may never\nhave the opportunity to discuss these issues.\nAn important finding of this study is the lack of stability of\nthe resuscitation preferences for many patients who initially\ndid not want to be resuscitated. Our findings are consistent\nwith a recent report that found that 80% of the overall\nSUPPORT cohort had stable resuscitation preferences over 2\nmonths.21 The lack of stability may reflect initial uncertainty\nabout the preference, inaccurate classification by the initial\nassessment, or a change in perspective or circumstance that\nled patients to reconsider their initial preferences. Whatever\nthe cause, physicians were more likely to report accurately\nthe preferences of the patients who did not change their\nminds. This observation adds complexity to the study of\nphysician perceptions of patient preference. It is not clear that\nphysician discordance with patients who change their minds\nshould be considered a problem.\nStudy Limitations\nThis study has several important limitations. Any study of\nresuscitation preferences is inherently difficult. The patients in\nthis study were interviewed by individuals who had no relation-\nship with them and were not involved in their care. There may\nbe concerns that patients responded differently to the interview-\ners than they did with their physicians. In addition, the question\nused to assess resuscitation preferences may not reflect many of\nthe nuances of this issue. Many physicians may have difficulty\nwith the question because they consider many levels of resusci-\ntation to exist. Also, physicians may consider the issue of\nresuscitation differently, depending on the circumstance in\nwhich the cardiac arrest occurs.\nIn addition, although the interviews of the patients and\nphysicians were close in time, they were not simultaneous. It is\npossible that preferences changed after the patient interview and\nbefore the physician interview. This change may have caused\nsome physicians to appear not to know the preference of their\npatient and overestimated the discordance. For the identification\nof factors associated with this discordance, however, this mis-\nclassification would have been expected to add noise, not bias.\nIt is also possible that the process of conducting this study\nmay have altered behaviors. Patients who consented to be\ninterviewed about their resuscitation preferences should have\nbeen motivated to discuss these issues with their physicians\nand may have done so before the physician interview. This\neffect may have increased the communication and agreement\nbetween patients and their physicians. Other limitations of the\nstudy include the possible misinterpretation of the questions\nby ill patients and the possible lack of generalizability of our\nfindings to patients in other medical centers.\n"
