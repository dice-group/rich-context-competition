Assistive technology (AT) may improve quality of life and reduce dependence for older persons with\ndisabilities. In this article, we examine tradeoffs between the use of AT and reliance on personal care, with attention to\nfactors that may influence those relationships.\nMethods. We jointly modeled hours of formal and informal care with use of AT in order to address the inter-\ndependence of these outcomes in ways not taken into account in previous studies. We analyzed a national sample of older\npersons with difficulty in activities of daily living drawn from Phase 2 of the 1994\u00ad1995 National Health Interview Survey\n(NHIS) Disability Supplement.\nResults. Our findings show that the use of AT was associated with reductions in informal care hours, especially for\nthose who were unmarried, better educated, or had better cognitive abilities, but appeared to supplement formal care\nservices for these groups. Individuals with cognitive impairment were less likely than others to substitute AT with either\ntype of personal care.\nDiscussion. These models raise the possibility that reductions of informal care hours may be accomplished with\na combination of formal care and assistive devices, rather than from either alternative alone.\nSEVERAL concurrent population trends, such as declines in\ndisability and increases in education among the older\npopulation, as well as decreases in the availability of informal\ncaregivers and a shrinking long-term care workforce (Freed-\ndiscussions of the potential of assistive technology (AT) to\npromote independent aging in place. The latter half of the 20th\ncentury saw dramatic growth in AT use by older persons with\ndisabilities (Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1993; Norburn et al.,\nfrom 3.3 to 4.1 million, and the number relying only on\nequipment more than doubled (Manton et al.). By the mid-\n1990s, the majority of those with activity of daily living (ADL)\nlimitations used some form of technology, and almost a third\n(31%) used only AT to accommodate their needs (Agree &\nIt is hoped that recent increases in the use of AT can improve\nquality of life and alleviate pressures on the existing long-term\ncare system. Recent national studies suggest that technology\nmay confer unique benefits in reducing difficulty with daily\nVerbrugge & Sevak, 2002). Yet it remains unclear whether AT\nreplaces or supplements personal care. Where the use of\nassistive technology reduces the amount of personal care\nneeded, public expenditures on home health care could be\nreduced (e.g., Mann, Ottenbacher, Fraas, Tomita, & Granger,\n1999) and the burdens of informal care alleviated. Alternatively,\nthe use of AT in addition to personal services could potentially\nimprove the quality of care, and thus defer functional declines\nand institutionalization, which also would reduce public and\nprivate expenditures.\nPrior research on the substitutability of devices for personal\ncare has been limited in several ways. First, with few\nexceptions, studies have used a single metric of care to reflect\nsubstitution. Second, analyses often are limited to mobility\ndevices (e.g., canes, wheelchairs, walkers). Third, most\nresearch has implicitly assumed that the use of AT precedes\nand can predict use of personal care, while in practice such\ndecisions are not separable.\nIn this article, we expand upon prior studies in several ways.\nFirst, we consider multiple dimensions of personal care (e.g,\nhours, number of caregivers, and number of tasks) for both in-\nformal and formal sources of care. Second, rather than focusing\non mobility alone, we examine equipment use for all ADL\nactivities. Third, we adopt a modeling strategy that allows us to\nexamine the use of AT and formal and informal care as a\nunified set of decisions, without assuming one necessarily pre-\ncedes the other. We also focus not only on whether substitution\noccurs, but also on which groups have a greater propensity to\nreplace personal care with technology.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nBackground\nThe literature on substitution in long-term care for the older\npopulation has primarily focused on tradeoffs among different\ntypes of personal care in order to address the ``woodwork\neffect,'' the concern that public coverage for home care could\ncause a reduction in informal care. These studies have been\nlimited because, although substitution of one type of care for\nanother is in part a function of the relative cost of each type of\ncare, information on the price of formal care and assistive\ntechnologies is difficult to obtain and the implicit price of\ninformal care is difficult to define or measure. A small number\nof studies have addressed these issues with experimental data or\nstate-level variation in home care prices (e.g., Ettner, 1994;\nGreene, Lovely, & Ondrich 1993), but the majority define\nsubstitution as a simple replacement of one type of care for\nanother (e.g., Logan & Spitze, 1994; Soldo, Agree, & Wolf\nfollowed this definition in the present analysis. These studies\ngenerally have found that formal home care does not substitute\nfor (or crowd out) informal care and may, in many cases,\nsupplement informal care (Kemper, Applebaum, & Harrigan,\nRecently, studies of community-based long-term care have\nconsidered substitution between AT and personal care (Agree\n1999). Using an experimental design that randomized about\n100 older individuals to assistive devices, Mann and colleagues\nfound that AT use was associated with lower costs for paid\nhome care. The study did not address the role of informal care\nnor did it explore the mechanism through which costs were\nreduced (e.g., fewer visits, shorter visits, different types of\nvisits). The remaining four studies were based on observational\ndesigns, with three of the four focusing on mobility limitations.\nIn descriptive analyses, Agree and Freedman (2000) found that\nin the United States, simple assistive technology, such as canes,\nhad the potential to substitute for informal care, while more\ncomplex devices, such as wheelchairs, appeared to supplement\nformal care. These relationships held after controlling for the\nunderlying degree of disability severity. Similarly, de Klerk\nand Huijsman found in a sample of older persons from the\nNetherlands that the use of mobility aids was positively as-\nsociated with the use of home care. Both studies defined sub-\nstitution narrowly in terms of a discrete tradeoff between the\nuse of AT and the receipt of any informal or formal care. In\ntheir analysis of mobility aids, Allen and colleagues considered\na more extensive array of definitions including any formal or\ninformal care, hours of formal or informal care, number of tasks\nfor which help was received, and yearly out-of-pocket costs for\nformal services. In a series of logistic regression models, they\nfound the use of canes and crutches inversely related with the\nnumber of tasks and hours of informal and formal care\nreceived; however, no evidence of substitution was found for\nwheelchairs and walkers. A fourth study by Hoenig, Taylor,\nand Sloan found that AT use for ADL limitations was as-\nsociated with fewer hours of help.\nThough it has been growing, the existing literature ignores\nthe highly interdependent nature of decisions about AT and\ninformal and formal care. This leads to two serious limitations.\nFirst, with the exception of Mann and colleagues (1999),\nstudies that have modeled the relationship between AT use and\npersonal care have attempted to predict informal and/or formal\ncare use as a function of AT use. Such models by definition\nassume that decisions about AT precede decisions about\npersonal care, which is rarely the case in practice. For example,\na recent widow may use adaptive equipment to compensate for\nthe loss of her informal caregiver. Additionally, formal\nproviders, such as nursing aides or rehabilitation therapists,\noften will bring AT into an older individual's home as a part of\ntheir service package (Gitlin & Levine, 1992). Second, these\nstudies have focused on whether substitution is occurring, with\nno attention to differences in the ability to substitute AT for\npersonal care. For example, those with cognitive impairment\nmay not be able to trade off technology for human assistance.\nMoreover, AT can substitute for formal or informal care in\na number of ways. For example, a cane or walker might alleviate\nthe need for any personal care by allowing an individual to\nambulate independently. Adding grab bars to the shower may\nenable older persons to shower safely on their own, thereby\nreducing the hours of care or the number of caregivers needed,\nor freeing caregivers to use the extra time to turn their attention\nto other tasks, such as paying medical bills, shopping, or\ncooking. In the last case, the total amount of care (in terms of\npersonnel or hours) may remain the same, but the tasks with\nwhich they assist may change.\nIn this article we expand upon prior studies in two ways: First,\nrather than limiting our analysis to a single dimension of per-\nsonal care, we consider four distinct dimensions: 1) whether any\ninformal and formal care is received; 2) the number of informal\ncaregivers; 3) the hours of informal and formal care received;\nand 4) the number of ADL and instrumental ADL (IADL) tasks\nfor which informal and formal care is received. Second, unlike\nmost previous studies that have been limited to mobility\nlimitations, we consider the care options (informal and formal\ncare and the use of AT) for any of six ADL activities. Third, we\nemploy a statistical method that allows us to examine the use of\nformal and informal care services and AT without assuming the\norder in which they are acquired. The article is organized as\nfollows: After providing a description of the data, we compare\nAT users and nonusers to examine descriptively how assistive\ntechnology may substitute for personal care use across the four\ndimensions described above. We then present models that\nconsider the use of AT and hours of formal and informal care\njointly in order to identify who is most likely to use AT in place\nof or in addition to personal care services. Finally, we discuss\nimplications of our findings for future research.\nMETHODS\nData\nDisability to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-D2).\nThe NHIS Disability supplements were conducted as a follow-\nPhase 1 was conducted at the time of the core interview with\na designated respondent who answered questions for all related\nhousehold members. Phase 2 was administered to persons who\nscreened in as disabled from information in Phase 1 (defined as\nhaving any pathology, impairment limitation, or disability).\nThis definition was sufficiently broad to include almost 50% of\nthose aged 70 years and older. Phase 2 addressed disability\nissues in more detail than Phase 1 and included information on\nhealth insurance, transportation needs, housing and other\nenvironmental barriers, and family structure and relations.\nSample Selection\nand older who reported underlying difficulty with one or more\nof seven ADLs (bathing or showering, dressing, eating, getting\nin and out of bed or chairs, walking, getting outside, and using\nthe toilet). For each activity respondents were asked how well\nthey were able to do them by themselves and without special\nequipment. We limit our focus to the use of care for ADLs\nbecause these tasks have been shown to be more responsive\nthan IADLs to the use of assistive devices (LaPlante, Hender-\nto be subject to the lifelong abilities and expectations built into\nsocial roles, especially by gender (Allen, 1994). We do not\nfocus on sensory impairments such as hearing and vision\nlimitations for two reasons. First, while these abilities are\nimportant in accomplishing ADLs and using equipment, they\nare not activities in and of themselves. Second, the NHIS-D\ncollected no information on personal care for them.\nDependent Variables: AT and Personal Care Use\nAT use. --For each ADL, participants were asked if they used\nspecial equipment and to name the specific item(s) used. The\nmost common items mentioned were canes, bath seats, walkers,\nbath rails, and wheelchairs (see Table 1). Altogether 63.8% of\nrespondents reported using at least one of these five devices.\nThe majority of AT was used for mobility-related activities\n(walking, transferring, and going outside), and mobility devices\noften were used for more than one activity, including toileting,\nwhich has a mobility component. AT was also commonly used\nfor bathing; almost one quarter of the sample reported using\nrails or grab bars. In order to maintain the power of the models,\nand because not every AT user identified their devices by name,\nour measure of assistive technology use is a dichotomous\nindicator of whether a respondent uses any special equipment.\nPersonal care use. --Respondents were asked if they\nreceived hands-on help for each ADL activity and if so to\nidentify up to four people who help them. For each helper,\nrespondents provided information on the tasks with which the\ncaregiver provides help, the number of hours they provided care\nin the last two weeks, and the relationship of the caregiver.\nPersonal care is classified as either formal care (defined as a paid\nprovider or an unpaid volunteer or employee of a formal\norganization) or informal care (unpaid care provided by relatives\nor friends.)\nDrawing upon our multiple definitions of substitution, we\ncreated indicators for the following dimensions of personal\ncare: First, we created a dichotomous indicator for whether or\nnot the respondent used any informal or formal care in the last\ntwo weeks. Second, we represented the size of the care network\nby a dichotomous variable indicating whether respondents used\ntwo or more informal caregivers. We used the number of\ninformal rather than formal caregivers because most secondary\ncaregivers were informal. Third, we created a set of indicators\nfor the number of hours of care provided by informal and\nformal caregivers in the past two weeks. In a number of cases,\nhours of care were incomplete or missing for one or more\ncaregivers. For 1,139 respondents, we imputed information on\nhours of care for one or more helpers. We assigned informal\ncaregivers with missing information the average number of\nhours of care provided by caregivers matched by sex (male,\nfemale, or unknown), network size (1, 2\u00fe), and position\n(primary, secondary). For formal care providers, we used\nnetwork size and position only. Finally, to explore whether care\nhours were shifted to alternative tasks, we counted the number\nof ADL and IADL tasks for which formal and informal help\nwas received.\nIndependent Variables\nWe included four sets of variables, which have been shown\nin previous research to be related to use of AT and informal\nand/or formal care, into the models: health needs, resources,\naccess, and demographic characteristics.\nHealth Needs. --The primary factor determining the nature\nand amount of care used is the extent of underlying health\nneeds. In this study, health needs were measured by 1) the\nnumber of ADL limitations with which the respondent reported\nsevere underlying difficulty and 2) the presence of extensive\ncognitive impairment. The first measure was obtained from\nquestions about the amount of difficulty respondents had with\neach ADL when they were not using any special equipment or\npersonal assistance. Those who reported that they had a lot of\ndifficulty or were unable to do the task without assistance were\nconsidered to have a ``severe'' limitation with that activity. The\nreference group in our models consisted of respondents who\nreported some difficulty with one or more ADL tasks but who\ndid not report ``severe'' difficulty with any ADLs.\nBecause measures of cognitive impairment in the NHIS-D\nwere extremely limited we employed an indicator of whether\na proxy respondent was used due to ``poor memory, senility,\nTable 1.

This measure identified only the most severely\ncognitively impaired respondents and excluded more mildly\ncognitively impaired individuals who were able to respond to\nthe interview themselves.\nResources. --The choice of care arrangement depends in part\nupon the economic and familial resources available to the older\nperson. In this analysis we included measures of insurance,\npoverty, and kin availability. To represent insurance coverage,\nwe included a three-category indicator: Medicare only, dually\neligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and Medicare and private\nsupplemental insurance. Those with other health insurance,\ntypically government veterans insurance, were included with\nthe Medicare only group as fewer than 3% of respondents were\nin this category. We represent poverty status with a three-\ncategory variable: below poverty (, 100% of the poverty line),\n(. 200% of poverty). In addition to these categories, we\nused a separate category to indicate those individuals whose\nincome was unknown (about 20% of our sample). With respect\nto kin availability, we included indicators representing marital\nstatus (currently married vs not currently married) and the\nnumber of living daughters both in and outside the household.\nWe also examined number of living sons, brothers, and sisters,\nbut found in preliminary analyses that these factors had little\neffect on either AT use or personal care.\nAccess. --Access to technology and formal care can be\nmeasured by availability and by price. Because information on\nthe price of AT is not widely available, here we focused on two\nindicators: acute care use and urban location. Many older\npersons are first introduced to the use of a device in the hospital\nor through prescription by a physician (Gitlin, 1995), and ar-\nrangements for home health care are commonly made upon\nhospital discharge, when Medicare will pay for these services.\nContact with medical providers also may lead to use of a formal\ncare manager, who would be more knowledgeable about both\nformal home care and appropriate AT. Thus, although imper-\nfect, we represented the availability of these care options in our\nmodels by hospitalization and physician visits in the prior year.\nGeographic location often is used as a proxy for availability\nof and accessibility to services such as health care (e.g., Krout\n1983), but there are inconsistencies in the literature related to\nrural\u00adurban residence and service utilization. We examined the\ncontrasts between nonurban and urban residential location,\ndents, and nonurban areas are localities with fewer than\nDemographic characteristics. --We also included four de-\nmographic characteristics previously shown to be related to care\narrangements: age, gender, education, and race and ethnicity.\nWe classified age categorically as a distinction between those\nwere represented by a single indicator of whether the respondent\nwas White or non-White because few respondents from other\nbackgrounds are included in the sample.\nModeling Approach and Interpretation\nWe first examine the bivariate relationships between AT use\nand the four measures of personal care to determine where\npotential substitution of AT for personal care exists. Based on\nthese results, multivariate analyses focus on the relationship\nbetween AT use and the hours of informal and formal care\nreceived in the last two weeks.\nFollowing prior analyses of substitution between formal and\ninformal personal care (e.g., Greene, 1983), we assume that\nformal and informal care and AT are not acquired in any\nparticular order, as decisions regarding care tend to be idio-\nsyncratic and interdependent. That is, we assume that accom-\nmodating one's care needs is not necessarily done sequentially\n(e.g., first choosing a piece of technology and then determining\nthe type of caregiver and hours needed, or vice versa) but rather\nmay occur in any possible order, or simultaneously (for ex-\nample, upon discharge from hospital). The lack of recognition of\nthis interdependence in previous research has often led to\nmisspecification in other analyses with cross-sectional data.\nThere is a body of statistical methods that have been developed\nto simultaneously estimate equations for interdependent out-\ncomes (e.g., indirect regression, two [and three] stage least\nsquares, instrumental variables, and full and limited information\nmaximum likelihood models). Economists most commonly\napply instrumental variable techniques to identify the set of\nequations. However, in the absence of plausible instruments,\nwe have opted for a reduced-form modeling approach in which\nthe three outcomes are estimated as functions of the same\ncombination of exogenous health, resource, access, and de-\nmographic factors.\nThe dependent variables for the equations representing our\nthree outcomes included a dichotomous (0, 1) variable for AT\nuse and continuous variables truncated at 0 for both informal\ncare and formal care. We assume that the error terms for the\nthree equations come from a correlated trivariate normal dis-\ntribution. Therefore, we jointly estimated a Probit equation for\nAT use along with two Tobit equations for the two hours-of-\ncare variables. Correlations between pairs of the three error\nterms (designated by the Greek symbol q [rho]) represents the\nrelationships between the relevant pairs of care alternatives net\nof characteristics included in the model. We obtained parameter\nestimates with aML software (Lillard and Panis, 2003).\nAlthough this approach does not allow comparisons across\nspecific items of AT (because each would require its own\nequation), it offers the advantage of identifying characteristics\nassociated with the substitution of AT for formal and informal\nhours of care. In other words, we were able to identify factors\nthat increased the likelihood of using AT while decreasing the\nhours of either informal or formal services used. Consequently,\nwe consider the combination of a positive (and statistically\nsignificant) coefficient in the AT equation with a negative (and\nstatistically significant) coefficient in the informal care and/or\nthe formal care equations to indicate substitution. The q\nparameters also may be interpreted as indicating substitution\nbetween a pair of outcomes when the parameter estimate is\nnegative (and statistically significant); in this case, however, the\nfactors associated with the substitution remain unmeasured. In\ncontrast, significantly positive coefficients in the AT equation\nand the formal hours or informal hours equations, along with\npositive q parameters, indicate complementarity of the two\ntypes of assistance. We estimated one-tailed significance tests\nto test for a specific effect direction.\nRESULTS\nWe present the general characteristics of the sample in Table\n2. The table shows the sample relatively evenly distributed by\nseverity of ADL disability, though only about 14% used a proxy\nfor cognitive reasons. Most (65%) were covered by Medicare\nand supplemental insurance, and about 20% were classified as in\npoverty. The majority were not married (60%), and more than\ntwo thirds had daughters. Less than half had seen a doctor two\ntimes in the last 3 months, and only about 30% had been to the\nhospital in the past year. Most of the sample (72%) resided in\nurban areas. In terms of demographic characteristics, slightly\nmore than half of the sample was aged 75 years or older, more\nthan 85% were White, about two thirds were female, and about\nhalf had not completed high school.\nComparisons show that AT users received more personal\ncare than nonusers on all four measures of personal care (Table\n3). They were more likely to use any formal and informal care,\nto have two or more caregivers, and to use more hours of both\nformal and informal care on average. Those who used AT also\nreceived help with significantly more ADL tasks and received\nboth informal and formal care with a greater number of IADLs\nthan respondents who did not use AT. At first glance these\nfindings suggest complementarity, rather than substitution,\nbetween AT and other forms of assistance.\nThese results do not, however, control for the accumulation of\nincreasing amounts and types of assistance at greater levels of\ndisability. To control for this potentially confounding effect, in\nTable 4 we stratify the estimates by underlying severity of\ndisability. For most of the personal care measures the results\nare largely unchanged. Across all the measures considered in\nthis table, AT appears to supplement both formal and informal\ncare. The one exception to this general pattern is among those\nwith the most severe ADL limitations, for whom AT use was\nassociated with fewer hours of informal care and more hours\nof formal care (yielding a lower number of total personal care\nhours). However, because they did not receive help for sig-\nnificantly fewer ADL tasks, this does not appear to be a shift of\ncare from ADL to IADL tasks. In fact, they reported receiving\nsignificantly more formal care for both ADL and IADL tasks.\nThese descriptive tables suggest that AT may substitute for\ninformal care hours at higher levels of disability. However, they\ndo not take into account other covariates that may affect the\nrelationship between AT and personal care. Additionally, it\nmay be that correlations among the three outcomes related to\nunmeasured characteristics influenced the observed relation-\nships. To further explore these possibilities and to identify who\nis more likely to substitute AT for personal care hours, we\nestimated our multivariate models.\nResults presented in Table 5 provide some initial insight into\nwhich groups of respondents were most likely to use assistive\ntechnology either instead of or in addition to formal and\ninformal care. The basic complementarity of AT and personal\ncare is confirmed for those of advancing age and with more\nsevere ADL disabilities, which were associated with increases\nin all three types of care. In addition, those with two or more\ndoctor visits in the past 3 months showed increases in both use\nof AT and hours of informal care, and those that had any\nhospitalizations in the last year were both more likely to use AT\nand more formal care hours.\nOnly three factors show patterns consistent with the use of AT\nas a substitute for personal care. For those who were unmarried\nand those with more than a high school education, AT appears to\ntrade off informal hours and complement formal care hours.\nBoth groups were more likely to use AT than married and less\neducated persons, respectively, and also use fewer informal care\nhours. However, our models also show that these respondents\nTable 2.

N \u00bc 4,006.\nused more formal care hours, even after controlling for addi-\ntional covariates, indicating a complementarity between AT and\nformal services. The second pattern of substitution is related to\ncognitive capacity. Those with reduced cognitive capacity were\nmore likely than others to supplement AT with both types of\npersonal care; stated another way, those with reduced cognitive\ncapacity were less likely than others to substitute AT with either\ntype of personal care.\nSeveral other variables included in the model produced\nstatistically significant results for formal or informal hours, or\nboth, but insignificant results for AT (and vice-versa). For ex-\nample, individuals living in nonurban areas were significantly\nless likely to use AT but were not statistically different from\nthose dwelling in urban areas with respect to either formal or\ninformal hours of help. Such findings indicate a reallocation of\nassistive services, compared to the reference group, but do not\nmeet our criterion for service substitution because the increase\n(or decrease) in the likelihood of using AT was not offset by\na decrease (or increase, respectively) in use of help from others.\nNet of the effects of the variables included in the models, the q\nparameters indicate that AT use had a small positive correlation\nwith informal care hours (q \u00bc .05) and a moderate positive as-\nsociation with formal care hours (q \u00bc .15). Informal and formal\ncare hours were negatively related (q \u00bc \u00c0.13), which is con-\nsistent with prior research on personal long-term care services.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this article, we explored the interdependence of AT and\ninformal and formal care use by older people. Unlike previous\nstudies, we also identified factors that influence the propensity to\nuse AT as a substitute for or complement to personal services. In\nour analyses, we examined several dimensions of personal care\nin order to better identify the nature of substitution between AT\nand formal and informal personal care. Overall, these findings\nshow that, regardless of the measure of substitution, AT is not\nreplacing formal or informal care for most older persons living\nwith disabilities in the community. Instead AT use appears to\nsupplement personal care--it is associated with a higher prob-\nability of using both informal and formal care, more care-\ngivers and more care hours, and the receipt of assistance with\nmore tasks.\nWe also found that for some groups (e.g., unmarried persons\nand those with some college education) AT and formal care\ntogether seem to offset informal care hours. However, because\nthe coefficients for both AT and formal care hours are positive, it\nis possible that formal care and AT substitute for different tasks\nor at different times and that informal caregivers cannot reduce\ntheir hours unless both are present in the care arrangement. This\nfinding also underscores the importance of jointly considering\nAT with both informal and formal care sources in order to\nunderstand the long-term care decision process.\nResults also indicate that those with worse cognitive capacity\nare less likely to substitute the use of AT for both formal and\ninformal personal care hours. It is not surprising that these\nrespondents would be less able to substitute AT for caregiver\ntime, as the use of devices for physical disabilities requires some\ncognitive ability. This result may be a conservative estimate of\nthe effect of cognitive abilities on the propensity to substitute,\nhowever, as our measure of cognition distinguishes only be-\ntween those with the most severe cognitive impairment (who\nwere unable to be interviewed and for whom proxy responses\nwere obtained) and all others. As many as 5\u00ad7% of those\nwho self-report could have had severe cognitive impairment\n(Freedman, Aykan, & Martin, 2001), and an unknown addi-\ntional number might have had mild to moderate impairments in\ncognitive function. Use of a more refined measure should, in\ntheory, yield even greater distinctions by cognitive status, but\nthis relationship requires further investigation.\nThese findings substantiate prior research showing that AT\nsubstitutes for informal care, at least for some groups (Agree &\n2003), and that AT supplements formal care (Agree and\nresults differ from Allen and colleagues (2001), who concluded\nTable 3.

Reconciling the inconsistency in findings will\nrequire further analysis, as the two studies employ different\ninclusion criteria, modeling strategies, and treatment of the\ncognitively impaired.\nOur study is limited in several respects. First, we use cross-\nsectional data and thus are unable to directly examine the order\nin which each type of assistance was adopted. Nevertheless, we\nimprove upon past studies because our analytic models do not\nimpose a priori any temporal order between AT and personal\ncare as previous research has done. A second limitation is that\nwe were unable in this study to distinguish among specific types\nof devices or between simple and complex technologies, though\nother research has shown these distinctions to be important\nindicator for AT may limit our ability to recognize task-specific\ncases of substitution or supplementation because we summarize\ncare at the person level instead of the activity level. Further\nresearch at a more refined level of detail would give greater\nmeaning to our findings and better suggest clinically relevant\ninterventions to improve home-based long-term care. Finally,\nalthough we control for reported limitations in health and under-\nlying severity in functioning, we cannot fully capture all of the\neffects of declining health on long-term care decisions. Conse-\nquently, there may remain some residual relationship among the\nthree outcomes that is due to unobserved health factors.\nDespite these limitations, this study provides important in-\nsights into the potential for technology to improve the daily\nlives of older disabled persons. We find, for example, that the\nreduced informal care hours cannot be attributed solely to AT,\nTable 4.

The association between these types of care\nsuggests that potential improvements in care management could\nbe made through increased use of care managers or provision of\ninformation about AT to health care providers. This finding also\nunderscores the need for caution in pointing to AT as a means\nof offsetting care costs for the older disabled population. Ulti-\nmately such devices may improve the quality of life of older\npersons and promote independence; however, their ability to\nsubstitute for more expensive formal care is not yet established.\nFinally, our results point to three groups--those who are\nunmarried, those with at least some college education, and those\nwith little or no cognitive impairment--as being most likely to\nsubstitute AT for personal care. Better education may be\nassociated with increased receptivity to AT and thus facilitate\nthe adoption of it into one's care network. Unmarried persons,\nbecause they most often live alone, may by necessity use AT to\ncarry out their daily activities. While it is difficult to predict\ntrends in marital status, over the next decades the educational\nattainment of older persons will increase dramatically (Freed-\nman & Martin, 1999). All else equal, our analysis suggests that\nthis trend will promote substitution of technology for hands-on\ninformal care. Why these groups use AT in place of informal\ncare, whether doing so confers a benefit, and if so, how best to\nencourage use for other groups are fruitful areas for further\nresearch on care for the elderly.\n"
