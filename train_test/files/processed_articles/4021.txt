The induction of neovessel formation starts with the\nrelease of various molecules by the tumor cells. These mol-\necules will send signals to the surrounding normal tissue and\nactivate genes for making proteins involved in the process of\nangiogenesis.1 Tumor cell dissemination in the process of\nmetastasis requires the development of angiogenic blood\nvessels. Neovasculature should possess certain structural\ncharacteristics to sustain active intravasation of tumor cells\nand their dissemination to secondary sites.2 The relatively\ndelicate process of neovessel formation can be a target for\nantiangiogenic therapy in cancer treatment because of the\ngenomic stability of endothelial cells compared to cancer\ncells. Cancer cells require less generation time and have\nmore genetic instability, whereas endothelial cells require\nlong generation time and have higher genomic stability. The\nrapidly proliferating cancer cells often undergo mutations\nand would likely acquire drug resistance.3\nNeovessel formation is initiated by the secretion of vari-\nous growth factors, especially vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF), which can pursue capillary growth into the\n1Amala Cancer Research Centre, Thrissur, Kerala, India\nCorresponding Author:\nGirija Kuttan, Department of Immunology, Amala Cancer Research\nCentre (Affiliated to the University of Calicut), Amala Nagar, Thrissur\nEmail: girijakuttan@gmail.com; immunologyacrc@gmail.com\nEvaluation of Antiangiogenic Efficacy of\nEmilia sonchifolia (L.)

VEGF is a powerful inducer of angiogenesis, stimu-\nlates growth and proliferation of endothelial cells, acts as a\nsurvival factor of endothelial cells, prevents their apoptosis,\nand also regulates vascular permeability. Matrix metallo-\nproteinases (MMPs) induce angiogenesis by degrading\nextracellular matrix (ECM) along with the release of angio-\ngenic mitogens stored in the matrix.1 The degradation of\nECM components surrounding the tumor tissue is mainly\nbrought about by the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9.2 The\nfamily of natural inhibitors of metalloproteinase are TIMPs\n(tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases), and TIMP expres-\nsion is related to tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.4\nInteractions between malignant and inflammatory cells\npresent in the stroma could be closely associated with\nangiogenesis and tumor progression.5 The same molecular\nevents trigger inflammation and angiogenesis6; pro-inflam-\nmatory cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), inter-\nleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) can be\nprometastatic or proangiogenic, and their deregulated\nexpression directly correlates with the metastatic potential\nof several human carcinomas.7 The proinflammatory\nresponse can be directed toward tumor promotion via stim-\nulation of the angiogenic process.8\nSeveral traditionally used natural compounds and herbal\nextracts have been investigated as antiangiogenic agents to\nprevent neovascularization of developing tumors. These\ninclude some of the works on Andrographis paniculata,9\nbiological activities of Emilia sonchifolia covering a gamut\nof beneficial properties have been reported. Preliminary\nstudies conducted on this plant showed its antitumor13 and\nanti-inflammatory activity along with reduction of inducible\nnitric oxide production.14,15 Further studies revealed its pro-\ntective effect on oxidative stress,16 modulation of selenite\ncataract,17 apoptotic activity on cancer cells,18,19 antinoci-\nceptive effects,20 and immunomodulatory effects.21 Recently,\nwe have done a complete phytochemical screening of the\nplant, and its antimetastatic effect was analyzed using the\nmost active solvent fraction containing the major active\nprinciple -humulene (C\nH\n).22 The present study was\ndesigned to explore the inhibitory effect of the active frac-\ntion from E sonchifolia (AFES) on tumor-specific neovessel\nformation, using both in vivo and in vitro models.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals\nHealthy adult male C57BL/6 mice (4-6 weeks old) were\npurchased from the National Institute of Nutrition,\nHyderabad, India. They were accommodated in individual\nventilated cages, fed with normal mice chow, and given\nwater ad libitum. All the animal experiments were carried\nout with the prior approval of the Institutional Animal\nEthics Committee and were conducted strictly adhering to\nthe guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control\nand Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA)\nconstituted by the Animal Welfare Division of the\nCell Lines and Reagents\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were\nisolated from human umbilical cord vein according to the\nmethod of Jaffe etal.23 The cells were grown in medium\nmL penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, and 2 ng/mLVEGF\nand fibroblast growth factor (FGF) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\natmosphere. B16F10 melanoma cells were obtained from\nNational Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India. Highly spe-\ncific quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA) kits for mouse IL-1, IL-6, TNF-,\nand granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor\n(GM-CSF) were purchased from Pierce Biotechnology\n(Rockford, IL). ELISA kits for VEGF and TIMP-1was pur-\nchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Radioactive\n3H-thymidine was obtained from the Board of Radiation\nand Isotope Technology, Mumbai, India. Silica gel, colla-\ntetrazolium bromide) and TNP 470 were purchased from\nSigma Aldrich (Bangalore, India). n-Hexane, ethyl acetate,\nand dimethyl sulfoxide were obtained from Merck\nSpecialities Private Ltd, Mumbai, India. All other chemi-\ncals used were of analytical reagent grade.\nPlant Material, Isolation of Active Principle, and\nExperimental Design\nThe whole plants of E sonchifolia were obtained from\nAmala Ayurveda Pharmacy, Thrissur, India, after authenti-\ncation, the voucher specimen is deposited at the herbarium\nof Amala Cancer Research Centre (Voucher No. 108/\nACRC). The whole plants of E sonchifolia were dried at\n45\u00b0C and powdered. The powder was then extracted with\n70% methanol in Soxhlet apparatus for 24 hours, and the\nsolvent was evaporated to dryness at 42\u00b0C under reduced\npressure using a rotary evaporator. The extract obtained was\nthen subjected to silica gel column chromatography (200-\n400 mesh size, n-hexane\u00adethyl acetate, gradient). Different\nfractions were collected, and the fraction with least polarity\nwas again subjected to purification using n-hexane\u00adethyl\nacetate (99:1) to yield the active fraction that contains\n-humulene. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry anal-\nysis of the isolate revealed the presence of 71% of the major\nsesquiterpene -humulene (Figure 1A) present in the plant\nE sonchifolia. For animal experiments the AFES, 5 mg/kg\nbody weight, was administered intraperitoneally (ip).\nGilcy and Kuttan NP3\nThree groups of C57BL/6 mice (8 animals per group)\nwere used for the study. Angiogenesis was induced in all\ncells/animal) intradermally on the shaven ventral skin of\neach mouse. Group I animals were kept as control. Group II\nand Group III animals were treated with 5 consecutive dose\nbody weight), respectively, starting simultaneously with\ntumor challenge. For in vitro experiments 3 nontoxic con-\ncentrations of AFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL) were resus-\npended in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Dimethyl sulfoxide\nalone when used as vehicle in 0.1% and lesser concentra-\ntions showed no inhibitory effect on neovessel formation in\nthe experimental conditions.\nToxicological Evaluation of AFES\nweight) was administered intraperitoneally to Balb/c mice\n(n = 8) for 14 days. Animals were observed for mortality,\nbehavioral changes, and change in body weight. On 15th\nday, all the animals were sacrificed and selected organs\nsuch as liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, and lungs were dis-\nsected and weights were recorded. Blood was collected by\nheart puncture; the serum was separated and used for the\nanalysis of hepatic and renal functions. Liver function\nmarkers, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP),24 glutamate\npyruvate transaminase (GPT),25 and kidney function mark-\ners such as creatinine26 and blood urea nitrogen27 were\ndetermined.\nDetermination of the Effect of AFES on Tumor-\nSpecific Capillary Formation\nThe angiogenesis-induced animals were sacrificed on the\nninth day after tumor challenge. The skin from the ventral\nside was dissected out, washed with phosphate-buffered\nsaline, and the number of tumor-directed capillaries were\ncounted using a dissection microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification.\nDetermination of Serum IL-1, IL-6, TNF-,\nGM-CSF, VEGF, and TIMP-1 Levels\nBlood was collected from the caudal vein of all groups of\nangiogenesis-induced animals at 2 time intervals--days 2\nand 9 after tumor induction. Serum was separated and used\nfor the estimation of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, GM-CSF, VEGF,\nand TIMP-1 levels using ELISAkits according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions, and the readings were taken using an\nELISA plate reader (Thermo LabSystems, Beverly, MA).\nCell Viability by MTT Assay\nThe viability of cultured cells was determined by assaying\nfor the reduction of MTT to formazan.28,29 HUVECs were\nseeded (5000 cells/well) in a 96-well culture plate and incu-\natmosphere. Different\nconcentrations of AFES (0.5-100 \u00b5g/mL) were added and\nincubated further for 48 hours. Four hours before the com-\npletion of incubation, 20 \u00b5L of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added.\nThe percentage of viable cells was determined using an\nELISA plate reader.\n3H-Thymidine Incorporation Assay\nture plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\natmosphere.\nAfter 24 hours, various concentrations of AFES (2.5, 1, and\n0.5 \u00b5g/mL) were added along with 2 ng/mL of VEGF and\nfurther incubated for 48 hours. 3H-thymidine was added to\neach well (1 \u00b5Ci/well) and incubation was continued for an\nadditional 18 hours. After completing incubation DNA was\nprecipitated using 10% ice-cold perchloric acid, and pellets\nwere dissolved in 0.5 mL of 6 N NaOH and transferred to 5\nmL scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was measured using\nRack Beta fluid scintillation counter (Wallac 1209;\nPharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).\nFigure 1. (A) Structure of -humulene. (B) MTT assay showing\nviability of HUVECs following treatment with the indicated\nconcentrations of AFES.\nRat Aortic Ring Assay\nThe rat aortic ring assay is used as an in vitro angiogenesis\nexperimental model. Dorsal aorta from a freshly sacrificed rat\nwas taken out in a sterile manner and rinsed in ice-cold\nphosphate-buffered saline. It was then cut into approximately\n1-mm-thick sections, and each ring was placed in a collagen-\nprecoated 96-well plate. The rings were incubated for 24 hours\nat 37\u00b0C in complete medium and then replaced with condi-\ntioned medium from B16F10 melanoma cells and incubated\nwith different concentrations ofAFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL).\nControls were kept without AFES treatment. The rings were\nanalyzed by phase-contrast microscopy for microvessel out-\ngrowth on the sixth day and the sections were photographed.\nDetermination of the Effect of AFES on\nEndothelial Cell Migration\nHUVECs were seeded on a collagen-precoated 96-well plate\nat a density of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 hours at\natmosphere. The monolayers of cells were\nscraped with a narrow tip by applying suction. The scraped-\nout cells were removed by washing with serum-free medium.\nDifferent concentrations of AFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL)\nwere added along with 2 ng/mL VEGF and further incubated\nfor 24 hours. After incubation the cells were fixed in formalin\nand stained with crystal violet and photographed.30\nDetermination of the Effect of AFES on\nEndothelial Cell Invasion\nThe invasion assay was carried out in modified Boyden\nchambers as described by Albini et\ncompartment of the chamber was filled with serum-free\nmedium and a polycarbonate filter membrane coated with 25\n\u00b5g type I collagen was placed above this. HUVECs (105\nchamber in the presence and absence ofAFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5\n\u00b5g/mL) along with 2 ng/mLVEGF and FGF and incubated at\natmosphere for 10 hours. After incubation,\nthe membranes were removed, fixed with methanol, and\nstained with crystal violet. Cells migrating to the lower sur-\nface of the polycarbonate membrane were counted under a\nmicroscope. The results were expressed as percentage inhibi-\ntion of invasion.\nGelatin Zymography\nSDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel elec-\ntrophoresis) was performed by incorporating 0.1% gelatin in\nthe separating gel.32 Subconfluent HUVECs were incubated\nwith serum-free medium for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\natmo-\nsphere. The conditioned medium was then collected and sub-\njected to zymographic analysis. Samples equivalent to 100 \u00b5g\nproteins were activated with 5 \u00b5L trypsin solution (75 \u00b5g/mL)\nin the presence and absence ofAFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL) in\nbuffer (pH 8.0), and incubated\nfor 1 hour at room temperature. Samples were mixed with an\nequal volume of 2\u00d7 sample buffer and loaded on to 11% poly-\nacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. Electrophoresis was\ncarried out at 4\u00b0C with a constant current of 2 mA/tube until the\ntracking dye reached the periphery. The gels were then washed\nat\n37\u00b0C for 18 hours followed by staining with Gelcode Blue stain\nreagent for 2 hours. The clear areas on the gels were then\nvisualized.\nTable 1.

All the treated animals were carefully examined for 14 days for any signs of toxicity (behavioral changes and\nmortality).\nb\"None\" means that no toxic symptoms were seen during the observation period.\nGilcy and Kuttan NP5\nStatistical Analysis\nThe data were analyzed using Graphpad InStat software\n(San Diego, CA) and expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistically\nsignificant differences between groups were calculated by\nthe application of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-\nlowed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test. Values\nof P < .05 were considered as significant.\nResults\nToxicological Evaluation of AFES\nThe toxicity study (Table 1) revealed the no observed-adverse-\neffect level of AFES as 15 mg/kg body weight. The doses of\ndid not produce any mortality, change in behavior, body\nweight, relative organ weight, and hepatic and renal functions\nwhen compared with untreated animals. Administration of\nAFES at 20 mg/kg body weight produced slight weight loss.\nBased on these results and some preliminary screening on\nbiological activity, we selected the nontoxic lowest dose of 5\nmg/kg body weight for further studies.\nEffect of AFES on Tumor-Specific Capillary\nFormation\nThe effect of AFES on tumor-directed capillary formation is\nshown in Figure 2. AFES treatment produced significant\n(P > .001) inhibition (57%) of tumor-directed capillary for-\nmation along with a noticeable reduction in tumor size. The\nresult obtained as shown in the figure was comparable to the\nwell-known antiangiogenic compound TNP-470 used as ref-\nerence in this study.\nEffect of AFES on the Level of Proinflammatory\nCytokines, VEGF, and TIMP\nAFES treatment significantly inhibited the elevated levels\nof serum IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and GM-CSF, as shown in\nFigure 3. The elevated level of angiogenesis-promoting\nVEGF in tumor-bearing animals was also lowered signifi-\ncantly by AFES treatment compared to control animals. At\nthe same time the level of tissue inhibitor of MMPs was\nincreased by the treatment (Figure 4).\nEffect of AFES on Cell Viability\nThe percentage viability of HUVECs after treatment with\nAFES is shown in Figure 1B. The concentration needed for\n50% growth inhibition (IC50) of HUVECs was found to be\nmL concentrations of AFES, and these concentrations were\nused for further in vitro experiments.\nEffect of AFES on Endothelial Cell Proliferation\nRate of proliferation of HUVECs was determined by\n3H-thymidine incorporation into the cellular DNA.\nProliferation was expressed as radioactive counts per min-\nute (cpm). HUVECs showed very high rates of proliferation\nAdministration of AFES at a concentration of 2.5 \u00b5g/mL\nVEGF-induced proliferation of HUVECs. Considerable\ninhibition of proliferation was also observed when AFES\nFigure 2. Effect of AFES on in vivo angiogenesis.

Treatment with different concen-\ntrations of AFES significantly inhibited the microvessel\noutgrowth in a dose-dependent manner compared to the\ncontrol group without any treatment (Figure 5).\nEffect of AFES on Endothelial Cell Migration\nEffect of AFES on the migration of HUVECs is shown in\nFigure 6. HUVECs migrated into the scraped clear area\nwhen stimulated with VEGF as shown in the control with-\nout any treatment. AFES significantly inhibited the\nVEGF-induced migration of endothelial cells in a dose-\ndependent manner and maximum inhibition of endothe-\nlial cell migration was observed at 2.5 \u00b5g/mL as evident\nfrom the figures.\nEffect of AFES on Endothelial Cell Invasion Assay\nThe invasive property of HUVECs through the collagen\nmatrix is very high when stimulated with VEGF and FGF.\nThe administration of AFES produced significant inhibition\nin the invasion of cells in a dose-dependent manner. The\nnumber of cells found on the lower surface of the polycar-\nbonate membrane at a concentration of 2.5 \u00b5g/mL AFES\nwas very low. The treatment of HUVECs with higher con-\ncentration of AFES produced an inhibition of invasion by\nFigure 3. Effect of AFES on the serum cytokine levels: (A) IL-1, (B) IL-6, (C) TNF-, and (D) GM-CSF. The serum was collected\nfrom the caudal vein of C57BL/6 mice on the second and ninth days after induction of B16F10 melanoma cells (106 cells/mice). Values\nare mean \u00b1 SD. aP < .001 significantly different from untreated control.\nGilcy and Kuttan NP7\n61%, whereas at 1 \u00b5g/mL and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, the inhibition of\ninvasion was found to be 52% and 39%, respectively\n(Figure 7).\nGelatin Zymography\nType IV collagenases MMP-2 and MMP-9 secreted by the\ncells into the conditioned medium are mainly proenzymes\nthat require activation. Conditioned medium after trypsin\nactivation showed digested clear areas at 92 kD and 72 kD,\nwhich were identical to MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity. The\ninactive form of the enzyme did not show clear degradative\nareas when the gels were loaded by conditioned medium\nwithout trypsin activation. EDTA inhibits the proteolytic\nactivity by chelating Ca+, and the enzyme responsible for\ndegradation is metalloproteinase, which is evidenced when\ngels loaded with trypsin-activated conditioned medium were\nincubated with 10 mM EDTA, which did not produced clear\ndegradative areas. When conditioned medium was treated\nwith AFES at concentrations 2.5 and 1 \u00b5g/mL during trypsin\nactivation, it did not show any clear bands suggesting that\nAFES inhibited the activation of proenzyme to active enzyme\nof metalloproteinases. But AFES at 0.5 \u00b5g/mL showed an\nactivation of metalloproteinases as shown in Figure 8.\nDiscussion\nTumor vasculature is considered as a prime prognostic\nmarker of tumor grading.33 Antiangiogenic therapy is a\nhighly effective strategy for destroying tumor development\nbecause it directly affects the vascular supply, the basic\nrequirement for tumor growth. The agents that target angio-\ngenesis can be effectively used in therapy because of its\nmore specific nature compared to chemotherapy and radio-\ntherapy. These agents are also less toxic and can be used\nfor long term without the development of drug resistance in\nthe target cells. Most blood vessels in the adult organism\nremain quiescent but have the capability to divide in\nresponse to proper stimulus and results in angiogenesis.1\nPlants constitute a major source of highly effective conven-\ntional drugs for the treatment of different types of cancer. A\nlarge number of the sesquiterpenes obtained from medici-\nnal plants that are used in traditional medicine show anti-\ncancer activity by inhibition of inflammatory responses,\nprevention of metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this study,\nan active fraction containing the major sesquiterpene\n-humulene from the plant E sonchifolia, with renowned\nanti-inflammatory and antitumor effects, showed signifi-\ncant reduction in tumor-directed capillary formation, with\na simultaneous inhibition in the proliferation, migration,\nand invasion of endothelial cells, the crucial processes of\nneovessel formation.\nThe inhibition of capillary formation toward the devel-\noping tumor by AFES treatment revealed its antiangiogenic\neffect in an in vivo experimental condition. AFES signifi-\ncantly halted the endothelial cell proliferation, invasion,\nand migration, further proving its targeted activity toward\nthe cells involved in neovascularization. The in vitro\nFigure 4. Effect of AFES on the serum (A) VEGF and (B) TIMP levels.

Values are mean \u00b1 SD. aP < .001 significantly\ndifferent from untreated control.\nexperiment of microvessel outgrowth from the aortic ring is\nstrong direct evidence for the inhibitory effect of AFES on\nthe endothelial cell-dependent angiogenic process.\nEndothelial cell invasion during angiogenesis is a key pro-\ncess that involves degradation of the basement ECM barri-\ners to allow free mobility of the cells required for the\nformation of new blood vessels. This is accomplished by\nthe production of lytic enzymes that are able to digest the\nspecific matrix components and permit cell invasion.2 There\nis a correlation between MMP expression and tumor inva-\nsion. The metastasis-supporting vasculature is shaped by\ncontinuous proteolytic modification of ECM and MMPs.\nMMP-mediated regulation of VEGF-induced tumor vascu-\nlarization was completely inhibited by MMP blockage and\nreduced the volume of angiogenic vasculature.34 The matrix\ndegrading enzymes are produced in inactive proenzymatic\nforms, and the enzyme trypsin can activate pro-MMPs to\nactive MMPs. The gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-\n9) were found to be overexpressed in invasive tumor cells.4\nMMP-9 not only readily digests denatured collagens and\ngelatins but also plays its particular role in angiogenesis\nsince it increases the bioavailability of proangiogenic fac-\ntors. AFES treatment showed a significant inhibition in the\ninvasion and migration of the collagen matrix by HUVECs\nin a dose-dependent manner, and zymography analysis\nshowed an inhibition in the activation of the proenzyme\nform to the active form of metalloproteinases; both these\nprocesses are mediated by the involvement of matrix-\ndegrading enzymes. These results denote the regulatory\neffect of AFES on MMPs. TIMPs regulate MMPs through\nendogenous protease inhibition; high levels of TIMP were\nalways associated with inhibition of endothelial cell migra-\ntion. Progression of invasive and metastatic tumors showed\na decreased level of TIMPs.35 The TIMP-free status of pro-\nMMP-9 is an important biochemical characteristic required\nfor unencumbered and rapid activation and high angiogenic\ncapacity of naturally produced pro-MMP-9.36 The enhance-\nment in the level of TIMP-1 by AFES again pronounces its\nFigure 5.

VEGF is a rational therapeutic target because it has\na limited role in adults. Often, VEGF is secreted by tumors.1\nThe prime target of VEGF is endothelial cells, and cancer\ncells release VEGF to induce tumor angiogenesis. The\nVEGF stimulates VEGF receptors on the tumor endothe-\nlium or in the tumor cell itself. VEGF therapy supports\ntumor growth by inducing angiogenesis and also by direct\naction via VEGF receptor expression by tumor cells.37\nAdministration of AFES reduced the elevated level of\nserum VEGF in angiogenesis-induced animals, indicating\nthe efficiency of AFES in targeting VEGF and thereby\nreducing the VEGF-assisted migration and survival of\nendothelial cells. By lowering the level of VEGF, AFES can\nalso inhibit the neovessel formation induced by tumor cells\nfor their growth and development. The role played by TNF-\n can be linked to almost all steps involved in tumorigene-\nsis, including proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and\nmetastasis.38 TNF- acts as a macrophage-activating factor\nand activates these cells to secrete angiogenic factors.1\nIL-1 is required for invasion and metastasis of cancer cells\nand promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis.39 IL-6 pro-\nduced by endothelial and tumor cells is a potent proangio-\ngenic cytokine and promotes MMP-9 activation and VEGF\nFigure 6. Inhibitory effect of AFES on HUVECs migration. The HUVECs (2 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were seeded on type I collagen coated\n96-well titer plate and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. A clear area was made with a narrow tip in the monolayer and further incubated\nfor 24 hours in the presence and absence of AFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL) along with VEGF (2 ng/mL).

It stimulates\nangiogenesis by endothelial cell proliferation and migra-\ntion.42 Lowering of the elevated levels of TNF-, IL-1,\nIL-6, and GM-CSF further confirmed the antiangiogenic\neffect of the active fraction from E sonchifolia with already\nproven anti-inflammatory effects. By lowering the level of\nthese cytokines,AFES was involved directly or indirectly in\nthe inhibition of tumor-directed neovessel formation by\nblocking the main culprits like MMP and VEGF that\nactively take part in the process.\nIn conclusion, antiangiogenic therapy that targets vascu-\nlar growth within the tumor is now widely accepted to treat\nvarious tumors, because the agents used in this treatment\nmodality have fewer side effects due to the quiescent nature\nof the blood vessels in adults. The genetic instability of\ntumor cells is the main cause of the failure of systemic che-\nmotherapies. But the endothelial cells of the tumor stroma\nare genetically stable and believed to respond to antivascu-\nlar therapy because they are unable to become drug resis-\ntant. The present study clearly proved the inhibitory effect\nof the active fraction containing the major active principle\n-humulene on tumor angiogenesis by efficiently decreas-\ning MMPs, VEGF, and proinflammatory cytokines while at\nthe same time increasing the level of TIMP. The retarding\neffect of AFES was clear-cut from the decreased capillary\nformation and prevention of microvessel outgrowth from\nthe aorta. Additional evidence for the inhibitory effect of\nAFES is the impediment on endothelial cell proliferation,\ninvasion, migration, and also hampering of the activation of\nFigure 7. Inhibitory effect of AFES on HUVECs invasion through collagen matrix. HUVECs (105 cells/150 \u00b5L medium 199) were\nseeded on to the upper chamber of Boyden chamber in the presence and absence of AFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL) along with 2 ng/\nmL VEGF and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO\natmosphere for 10 hours. After incubation, the cells migrating to the lower surface of\nthe polycarbonate membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet and photographed.
