Accurate esti-\nmates of the numbers of deaths are crucial for political,\nmilitary, and public health planning, as well as for\npurposes of national history and reconciliation.\nThe challenges to estimating war mortality are\nconsiderable. Civil registration systems that track\ndeaths in peacetime typically fall apart during war,\nand many wars occur in places without pre-existing\nsurveillance infrastructure. In the absence of reliable\ndata from representative national information systems,\nthree main techniques are currently used to generate\nestimates.\nExisting techniques\nFirstly, a few surveys have been undertaken during\nwars in specific countries to estimate mortality on the\nbasis of household deaths.1-10 These surveys have\nproduced timely estimates, despite the usual problems\nof estimating adult mortality from surveys11 and the\nadditional logistical challenges posed by ongoing\nwarfare. The politicised environment surrounding the\nIraq mortality studies in particular, however, has\ngenerated considerable debate regarding the statistical\nvalidity of such studies. The small number of clusters\noften necessitated by active combat can lead to high\nlevels of uncertainty.12 13 Other researchers draw\nattention to the difficulties of extrapolating from\nsmall sample populations to the national level14 15 or\nto the difficulty of constructing a valid counterfactual\nfor estimates of excess mortality.16 Some of the most\nserious criticisms allege systematic bias resulting from\nsampling methods17 or politically motivated over-\nhold members.20 Whatever their merits, these critiques\nhave taken on considerable importance in the public\nand scientific discourse surrounding estimates of\nmortality.\nSecondly, some studies have attempted to calculate\nmortality from censuses using demographic techni-\nques that compare the age distribution of a population\nbefore and after war.21-24 Reliable census data, how-\never, are seldom available at these times and so strong\nassumptions are required to project existing data\nforward and backward. In addition, census based\nmethods do not produce accurate estimates for\npopulations with high migration, as occurs during\nThirdly, several passive surveillance methods use\ninformation from eyewitness and media reports or\nstatistics from mortuaries, gravesites, and health\nfacilities. In the absence of population based data\nthese data are typically the only ones available during\nongoing conflicts and represent the most commonly\ncited sources for government and other estimates of\n1Institute for Health Metrics and\nEvaluation, University of\nWashington, Seattle, WA, USA\n2Harvard Medical School, Boston,\nCorrespondence to: Z Obermeyer\nziad_obermeyer@hms.harvard.edu\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 9\nwar casualties, as in the current war in Iraq.26 27 In some\npost-conflict settings, including war crimes inquiries,\nactive investigations have been undertaken to compile\nall available evidence from such sources and to\nsupplement them further with intelligence reports,\nincomplete civil registration records, and missing\nPassive reports\nPassively reported data are subject to several biases.\nHigh levels of war related mortality occur in those\nviolent and dangerous areas where eyewitnesses are\nleast likely to go, resulting in systematic under-\nreporting of deaths by media sources.1-28 31 A similar\nbiasislikely toaffectstatisticsfrommortuariesorhealth\nfacilities,32 as well as partial civil registration records\nfrom those regions where government infrastructure\nremains intact. Media and eyewitness reports, and to a\nlesser degree facility records, are also subject to\npolitical pressures, which can result in either exaggera-\ntion or under-reporting of deaths. Such reports,\nhowever, represent the only source of information on\ndeaths for the vast majority of conflicts, and passive\ndata collection has formed the basis for most efforts to\ndate to analyse global trends in war mortality. A\ncollaboration between Uppsala University and the\nPeace Research Institute, Oslo, has produced a\ndatabase(Uppsala/PRIO)thatcompilesandreconciles\npassivereportsonviolentdeathsrelatedtowarglobally\nfrom 1900 onward. This database is considered to be\nmore consistent and comparable than other efforts.33\nThe data suggest that violent deaths from war have\ndeclined steadily since the second world war and that\nrecentyears have been someof the most peaceful of the\npast century.34 This claim lends empirical support to\nrecent research suggesting that overall levels of violent\nconflict are falling globally35-38 and to the view that\nwarfare has become less deadly in recent years thanks\nto technological innovations and strategic priorities\ndesigned to minimise civilian deaths.37 39\nGiven the paucity of population surveys and the\nknown biases in passively reported data, we propose a\nnew approach to estimate violent war deaths, using\ndata on sibling history from household surveys\nconducted in peacetime and adjusting for known\nbiases. Using nationally representative data from the\nsurvey (WHS) programme, we produced estimates of\nsuch deaths in 13 countries over the past 50 years. This\nretrospective method, which is free from the logistical\nconstraints imposed by active combat, is meant to\naugment and complement information from wartime\nsurvey efforts in three ways. Firstly, sample sizes are\ntypically considerably greater and sampling more\nsystematic than during active combat. Secondly,\nusing siblings' histories rather than household deaths\naddressessomeof theseriouscriticismsofstudiesinthe\nexisting literature--namely, double counting and\nTable 1 | Worldhealthsurveycharacteristics(numberofhouseholds,numberofsiblings),numberofdeathscaptured(forallcausesandwar,withpercentagemissing\ninformation on year of death), and percentage of deaths missing information regarding cause\nSurvey characteristics Sibling deaths, all causes Sibling deaths, war\nMissing cause\nof death (%)\nHouseholds Siblings Total\nYear of death\nTotal\nYear of death\nReported Missing (%) Reported Missing (%)\n*Mean weighted by number of siblings captured in survey.\nAge group (years)\nFraction of all violent war deaths\nFemale Male\nFig 1 | Fraction of all violent war deaths by age and sex in 13\ndeaths, bars sum to 1\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 9 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nexaggeration of deaths. Finally, we corrected for\nknown problems with mortality surveys--namely,\nunder-representation of families with high mortality\nand censoring. Such retrospective population based\nmethods can provide accurate data on war deaths,\nwhich are crucial for understanding historical trends as\nwell as for future planning.\nMETHODS\nThe world health surveys were carried out in 2002-3 in\n70 countries. These nationally representative surveys,\nwhich have been described in detail elsewhere,40 were\ndesigned to measure various dimensions of population\nhealth and performance of health systems. Surveys in\n45 countriescollected information on adult deaths,\nincluding specific questions about the survival of\nsiblings of the respondent, a randomly selected house-\nhold member. For siblings who died from injuries,\ninformation was collected on the cause of death,\nincluding whether the injury was related to war. Of\nthe 45 surveys with data on sibling history, 13 were\nfound to have more than five reported sibling deaths\nfrom war injuries in a given 10 year period, and we\nfocused on these countries in the analysis. Table 1\nshows selected survey characteristics for the 13 surveys\nused.\nWe estimated numbers of violent war deaths by\nperforming a proportional mortality analysis. We\nTable 2 | World health survey estimates of violent war deaths per year (thousands) with 95% confidence intervals\nGeorgia -- -- -- 4 (1 to 8) --\nGuatemala -- -- 2 (1 to 3) -- --\nPhilippines -- -- -- -- 4 (3 to 7)\nRepublic of Congo -- -- -- -- 1 (0.3 to 3)\nVietnam\nViolent war deaths per year (000s)\nWorld health survey\nUppsala/PRIO\nEthiopia\nYears\nSri Lanka\nViolent war deaths per year (000s)\nYears\nBosnia\nFig 2 | Trend in violent war deathsper year (thousands) in Vietnam, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, and Bosnia: world health survey estimates\nwith 95% confidence intervals and Uppsala/PRIO data with low-high range (where available)\nRESEARCH\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 3 of 9\nestimated the fraction of total deaths due to war injuries\nin a given time period based on the survey data and\napplied this fraction to UN Population Division\nestimates of total deaths available for all countries\nof total deaths are available, and we chose intervals of\n10 years to minimise the effect of random error and age\nheaping in reported ages and years. The last period\n2002. Across all surveys, information regarding cause\nof death was missing for 17% of deaths; we conserva-\ntively assumed these to be not related to war. Year of\nbirth for respondents was assigned based on reported\nage or year of birth. Year of birth for siblings was\nassigned based either on the reported age difference\nbetween the respondent and each sibling or the\nsibling's reported year of birth. For siblings for whom\ninformation on year of birth was missing, we imputed it\nby randomly drawing a sibling-respondent age differ-\nence from a normal distribution with mean and\nstandard deviation based on individual country data\nfrom the relevant survey. Overall, year of birth was\nbased on reported age for 83% of siblings and on\nreported year of birth for 16% and was imputed for 1%.\nWe based year of death on either the respondent's\nreport of how long ago the death occurred or how old\nthe sibling was when he or she died. Information on\nyear of death was missing for 25% of non-war deaths\nand 12% of war deaths. Given the significant difference\nin these proportions (t test, P<0.001), we probabilisti-\ncally imputed a year of death to avoid upward bias.\nOverall, we calculated year of death on the reported\nnumber of years since the death for 70% of deaths and\non the sibling's reported age at death for 5% and\nimputed it for 25% of deaths.\nTo calculate probabilities of death for all causes and\nfor war, we divided the number of deaths by the\nnumber of siblings alive in a given 10 year block, after\napplying two corrections. Firstly, to correct for the fact\nthat families with high rates of mortality are under-\nrepresented in surveys, we weighted siblings by Bf\n/Sf\n,\nwhere Bf\nis the original sibship size and Sf\nis the number\nof siblings alive at the time of the survey, according to\nthe method developed by Gakidou and King.42\nSecondly, we corrected for left and right censoring\nthat occurred in our data because of the limits of\nrespondents' age. Sibling deaths at older ages are less\nlikelytobereportedforyearslongerago:toconsideran\nextreme example, to report on the death of an 80 year\nold sibling 80 years ago, a respondent would have to be\non average 160 years old. Likewise, adult respondents\nare less likely to have very young siblings (such as\ninfants) on whom to report deaths in recent time\nperiods. To correct for this censoring, we applied a\nregression model separately to probability of death in\nwarandnotinwar.Weexponentiatedthecorrectedlog\nprobability of death from the war and non-war models\nand took the ratio of war to all cause probability to\ncalculate the fraction of war deaths by age group,\nTable 3 | Total violent war deaths (thousands) from 1955 to 2002, with 95% confidence intervals for world health survey (WHS)\nestimates and low-high range for Uppsala/PRIO data (where available), and ratio of WHS estimates to Uppsala/PRIO data\nUppsala/PRIO deaths (low-high\nrange) Ratio of WHS to Uppsala/PRIO\n*Mean ratio.\nYears\nViolent war deaths per year (000s)\nWorld health survey total\nUppsala/PRIO total for 13\nWHO survey countries\nFig 3 | Violent war deaths per year (thousands) in 13 survey\ncountries: world health survey estimates with 95% confidence\nintervals and data from Uppsala/PRIO with low-high range\n(where available)\nRESEARCH\npage 4 of 9 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\ncountry, and year. We standardised using the WHO\nstandard population43 and applied the calculated\nfraction of war deaths to estimates of total deaths by\ncountry and year. We captured uncertainty by\nsimulating 1000 simultaneous draws from the var-\niance-covariance matrix of both war and non-war\nmodels to arrive at 1000 estimates of the percentage\nestimates define the 95% uncertainty interval.44\nFinally, we compared our estimates with those from\nthe Uppsala/PRIO database using a linear model, with\ndependent variable and Uppsala/PRIO war deaths\nfrom the same period as the independent variable. We\nused the relation derived from this model to adjust the\nglobal historical trend observed in the Uppsala/PRIO\ndata.

The average ratio of survey\nestimates to Uppsala/PRIO data is 3, implying that\nmedia estimates capture on average a third of the\nnumber of deaths estimated from population based\nsurveys. The largest differences were in Bangladesh,\nGeorgia, and Zimbabwe. Apart from Georgia, where\nthe absolute numbers were small, the difference\nbetween the two sources was most pronounced in\nduring the conflict leading to that country's indepen-\ndence, and in Zimbabwe, where the survey estimates\nBrazzaville (7000 in the world health survey and\nPRIO provides only limited information on\nuncertainty, in the form of a low to high range; this is\npresented where available.\nThe rank order correlation coefficient between the\ntwo sets of estimates is 0.57, which indicates consider-\nable discrepancy between the two sources on the\nrelative size of the conflicts. Both sources agree that,\namong these countries, Vietnam and Ethiopia had the\ngreatest number of deaths.

The localisation in time\nof deaths captured by the world health survey is largely\nconsistent with patterns described in qualitative\nhistorical accounts. The survey captured a total of\nto be the most deadly phase of the war.45 Similarly, in\nEthiopia the highest level of war deaths is estimated to\ndeposition of Haile Selassie by the Derg and followed\nby open war in Somalia and Eritrea and the so called\n\"red terror\" when many civilians are thought to have\nbeenkilled.Approximatetimelocalisationofdeathsby\nsurvey respondents seems to remain intact for long\nperiods: the survey in Paraguay, for example, captured\nwar deaths, coincident with the Chaco war between\nParaguay and Bolivia. We could not apply our method\nto estimate war deaths in this war only because UN\nestimates of total deaths by country are unavailable\nbefore 1955. The fact that respondents in certain\nhousehold surveys are able to localise the time of the\ndeath of their sibling as far back as six decades is\nremarkable, but it is important to note that the ability to\ndo so is likely to vary by country. Little empirical\ninformation about recall bias exists in general because\nof the lack of an ideal standard by which to judge its\ndegree and determinants (though research on this topic\nis ongoing46). The salience of the WHO survey data,\nhowever, mightindicate thatwar deaths areless subject\nto recall bias than other deaths, perhaps because of the\nyoung age of victims and strong emotional associations\nfor family members.\nOur analysis also suggests that war kills many more\npeople than previously estimated. Data from the\nUppsala/PRIO database indicate that an average of\nthe same period. In addition to the absolute number of\ndeaths,comparisonofthepatternofdeathsovertimein\nsurvey estimates might lead to different conclusions\nabout trends compared with data from media reports,\nboth at country level and globally. Survey estimates\nfrom Sri Lanka suggest a consistent decline in deaths\nsince1975,whiletheUppsala/PRIOestimatesshowan\nhand, survey estimates indicate that deaths declined far\nmore slowly than media reports indicate. Our adjust-\nments to the Uppsala/PRIO data likewise do not\nsupport the claim that war deaths are declining\nglobally. Overall, nationally representative surveys\nyield estimates of war deaths that are less optimistic\nthan those based on passive surveillance, implying that\nitwouldrarelybeappropriateto takesuchdataasatrue\nreflection of the magnitude or trend of deaths.\nThese findings suggest that the strong claims made\non the basis of current data from media reports--\nnamely, that the number of deaths related to war has\ndeclined consistently since the mid-20th century and\nthat recent wars have killed relatively few people--\nshouldbere-evaluated.Ouranalysissuggestsamethod\nfor adjustment of passive surveillance data, which\nmight be the only option when other data are not\navailable.Suchapproximatemethods,however,areno\nsubstitute for real data as the adjusted uncertainty\nintervals are large, even without taking into account\nuncertaintyinthepointestimatesonwhichthemodelis\nbased. More resources are urgently needed for\nempirical measurement of war deaths.\nLimitations\nOur study has several limitations that might influence\nthe interpretation of our results. Firstly, as the survey\ninstrument collects information on deaths from war\ninjuries, our estimates capture only direct violent\ndeaths from war, not all excess deaths attributable to\nwar. Previous studies have shown that while in some\ncountries most war deaths result from such direct\ninjuries,1 6 7 in other settings, such as those with less\ndeveloped health infrastructure or worse overall\nhealth, violent deaths represent only a small fraction\nof total excess mortality.2 Secondly, there are several\npotential sources of bias in survey data. Recall bias\nmight have resulted in an underestimate of war deaths\nas deaths that happened longer ago might be less likely\nto be reported, particularly in younger age groups. We\naddress this by using corrected probabilities of death\nfrom the statistical model, but it is possible that our\ncorrection is insufficient.\nThe inability of surveys to capture families with no\nsurvivors is another source of downward bias; while\nsimulation evidence suggests that these families\naccount for only a small proportion of all mortality,42\nthis problem is likely to be more acute in war settings\nthan in other high mortality settings. Overall, we think\nthat the estimates presented here should be viewed as\nconservative, given these sources of downward bias.\nYears\nViolent war deaths per year (000s)\nAdjusted Uppsala/PRIO\nPublished Uppsala/PRIO\nFig 5 | Uppsala/PRIO violent war deaths per year from 1945 to\nconfidence intervals, based on relation between Uppsala/PRIO\ndata and world health survey estimates\nRESEARCH\npage 6 of 9 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nResults could also be biased upwards if deaths related\ntowararereportedmorefrequentlyormoreaccurately\nthan otherdeaths. The survey instrument was designed\nto minimise this error by asking respondents to\nenumerate all their siblings (both alive and dead)\nbefore answering specific questions about siblings who\ndied. Imputation of missing year of death also corrects\nfor poorer reporting of the timing of non-war deaths.\nThirdly, as the survey was not specifically designed\nto measure war deaths, the absolute number of sibling\ndeaths captured is small, leading to considerable\nuncertainty around our point estimates of war deaths\n--this might be a consistent feature of any survey based\nestimate of adult mortality, particularly cause specific\nestimates like our study and previous studies of war\nmortality. Additional uncertainty might have been\nintroducedintoourresultsbyusingtheUNestimatesof\ntotal deaths; however, these numbers are the only\navailable source of information on mortality level for\nthese country periods. Fourthly, we restricted our\nestimatestocountryperiodswithmorethanfivesibling\nwar deaths to reduce uncertainty; doing so, however,\nmight have excluded information from small conflicts,\nwhich account for less than 1% of all deaths.\nFinally, the absence of an ideal standard measure-\nment of war mortality--which is the reason that\nalternative techniques such as surveys are needed--\nprevents us from validating our estimates with respect\nto true numbers. In the absence of credible vital\nregistration data during wartime, the prospect of a\nvalidation study against a standard dataset is unlikely.\nWe were unable to locate estimates of deaths from\nwartime surveys with which to compare our estimates\nin the 13 countries studied; nor to our knowledge are\nany future surveys planned in these countries, which\ncould have served to check the consistency of the\nestimates.\nComparisons with other sources\nOne source of comparison in Vietnam is an analysis of\nthat country's life history survey, which yielded an\nsurvey estimate (1.7 million). The authors acknowl-\nedge, however, that the Vietnam life history survey\nresults are biased downwards because rural areas with\nhighermortalitywereunder-representedandestimates\nwere not corrected for under-representation of high\nmortality families. In addition, the small sample (403\nhouseholds compared with 4089 in the world health\nsurveys) might have missed clusters of high mortality\nareas.\nAnother comparison can be made between survey\ndata and the estimate of 97 000 dead and missing in\nBosnia in 1991-5 by the Research and Documentation\nCentreinSarajevo,48 whichhascompiledahighquality\ndatabase of records, testimonies, and eyewitness and\nhistorical reports.49 As with similar efforts in Iraq,27\nreported data provide a useful minimum estimate of\nthe centre's figure but still considerably lower than\nThe centre's database also permits comparison of time\ntrends, which indicate that most deaths occurred from\nthe war.\nAs a final point of comparison, we applied our\ncorrection method, derived from the comparison of\nsurvey estimates with Uppsala/PRIO data, to data\nfrom the Iraq Body Count project's most recent report\nwar falls between the Iraq Family Health Survey\nby Burnham and colleagues.1\nConclusions\nLarge scale population based surveys conducted in\npeacetime, despite their limitations, hold promise for\nmeasurementofwarmortalityforatleastthreereasons.\nFirstly, these surveys have several attributes (such as\nsmall sampling units, large numbers of clusters,\nstratification, random selection of households within\nclusters50) that are better suited to producing estimates\nof violent deaths--which tend to be geographically\nclustered--than those typically available during active\nhumanitarian emergencies.51 Future surveys could\nreduce uncertainty around estimates from sibling\nhistoriesbyseveraltechniques,includinglargersample\nsizes, multiple non-sibling respondents per household,\nand more structured sibling histories. The survey\nperformedwellinthesettingofsomeongoingconflicts,\nsuch as Ethiopia and Sri Lanka, each gathering data on\naround 30 000 siblings with low non-response rates; it\nis clear, however, that the questionnaire and study\ndesign would need to be modified for use during high\nintensity conflicts.

Finally, as population health surveys\nare not specifically designed to measure war mortality,\nand as respondents are asked to provide complete\ninformationonalloftheirsiblingsbeforesurvivalstatus\nand cause of death are ascertained, there is less scope\nfor exaggeration or double counting of deaths. In\naddition, such surveys can also provide information on\ncauses of adult mortality other than war: recent\nadvances in verbal autopsy techniques52-56 show\npromise for overcoming the many well known limita-\ntions of such cause of death data.\nAccurate estimates of war mortality are crucial for\nplanning on several different levels.
