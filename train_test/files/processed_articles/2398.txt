Prevalence of\n Introduction\nExcessive alcohol consumption is responsible for 88,000 deaths\nten assumed that most excessive drinkers are alcohol dependent.\nHowever, few studies have examined the prevalence of alcohol de-\npendence among excessive drinkers. The objective of this study\nwas to update prior estimates of the prevalence of alcohol depend-\nence among US adult drinkers.\nMethods\nData were analyzed from the 138,100 adults who responded to the\nDrinking patterns (ie, past-year drinking, excessive drinking, and\nbinge drinking) were assessed by sociodemographic characterist-\nics and alcohol dependence (assessed through self-reported sur-\nvey responses and defined as meeting 3 of 7 criteria for depend-\nence in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\nFourth Edition).\nResults\nExcessive drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol dependence were\nmost common among men and those aged 18 to 24. Binge drink-\ning was most common among those with annual family incomes\nof $75,000 or more, whereas alcohol dependence was most com-\nmon among those with annual family incomes of less than\nexcessive drinkers, 10.5% among binge drinkers, and 1.3% among\nnon-binge drinkers. A positive relationship was found between al-\ncohol dependence and binge drinking frequency.\nConclusion\nMost excessive drinkers (90%) did not meet the criteria for alco-\nhol dependence. A comprehensive approach to reducing excessive\ndrinking that emphasizes evidence-based policy strategies and\nclinical preventive services could have an impact on reducing ex-\ncessive drinking in addition to focusing on the implementation of\naddiction treatment services.\nIntroduction\nExcessive alcohol consumption is responsible for an average of\nin 2006 (1,2). Half of these deaths and three-quarters of the eco-\nnomic costs are due to binge drinking (ie, 4 drinks for women\nand 5 drinks for men in a single occasion) (1,3). Binge drinking\nis also associated with a myriad of health and social problems (eg,\nviolence, new HIV infections, unintended pregnancies, and alco-\nhol dependence) (4,5).\nIt is often assumed that most excessive drinkers are alcohol de-\npendent. However, few studies have examined the prevalence of\nalcohol dependence among excessive drinkers -- specifically\namong binge drinkers. Access to such information is important to\ninform the prioritization of strategies to prevent excessive drink-\ning and treat alcohol dependence. Because binge drinkers are at\nhigher risk than non-binge drinkers for alcohol dependence (6),\npopulation-based policies offer an important way to prevent alco-\nhol dependence. The clinical diagnosis of alcohol dependence is\nbased on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-\ntal Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition, and involves the assessment\nof warning signs such as tolerance, withdrawal, impaired control,\nand unsuccessful attempts to cut down (7).\nData from the 2002 New Mexico Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-\nlance System (BRFSS) found that 10.7% of excessive drinkers (ie,\nbinge drinkers, heavy drinkers, or alcohol-impaired drivers) and\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\n8.1% of binge drinkers met diagnostic criteria for alcohol depend-\nvey of Alcohol-Related Conditions (NESARC) found that the pre-\nvalence of alcohol dependence among binge drinkers aged 18 or\nolder was 4.4% among those with 1 to 11 binge drinking occa-\nsions in the previous year and jumped to 21.9% among those with\n12 or more binge drinking occasions in the previous year (9).\nThere are no current estimates of the prevalence of alcohol de-\npendence among US adults based on patterns of drinking. The ob-\njective of this study was to update prior estimates of the preval-\nence of alcohol dependence among US adult drinkers. If most\nbinge drinkers do not meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol de-\npendence, evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive\nservices may effectively reduce binge drinking in most cases\nwithout requiring addiction treatment.\nMethods\nSample and procedures\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a series\nof cross-sectional surveys of a nationally representative sample of\nnoninstitutionalized US residents aged 12 years or older in the 50\nstates and Washington, DC. Conducted by the Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration, the NSDUH is de-\nsigned to assess the prevalence and correlates of alcohol and other\ndrug use disorders in the general US population. A multistage\nprobability sample was independently selected for each state and\nWashington, DC. Interviews were conducted using a computer-as-\nsisted personal interview and audio computer-assisted self-inter-\nviewing to enhance respondent's privacy during visits to house-\nholds and group living facilities. Respondents were compensated\n$30 for their participation in the survey.\ncreated for this collaborative study between the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention and the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration. A new population weight was\ncreated for this multiyear data set by dividing the original weights\nfor the single-year data sets by 3. This new population weight was\nthen used to produce annual average estimates of the US adult ci-\nvilian noninstitutionalized population aged 18 or older. Weighted\nresponse rates for the computer-assisted interviews were 75.7% in\nfrom all 50 states and Washington, DC. Further description of the\nmethods for the NSDUH has been published (10). This study did\nnot involve human research participants and was exempt from in-\nstitutional review board oversight.\nMeasures\nPast-year drinking was defined as consuming at least 1 drink in the\npast 12 months. Excessive drinking was defined as binge drinking;\nheavy drinking; any past 30-day drinking by respondents aged 18\nto 20 (who are under the minimum legal drinking age) if not\nalready included in another drinking category; or any past 30-day\nalcohol consumption by pregnant women (1). The NSDUH con-\nsists of core and noncore questions. The core questions do not\nchange from year to year to preserve the ability to assess trends\nover time. The noncore modules are less static and are asked in the\nsurvey after the core-modules. Only respondents who reported\never having an alcoholic beverage were asked the noncore alcohol\nconsumption questions. Binge drinking for men was defined as a\nnonzero response to the following question in the core portion of\nthe survey: \"During the past 30 days, that is, since [DATEFILL],\non how many days did you have 5 or more drinks on the same oc-\ncasion?\" Binge drinking for women was defined as a nonzero re-\nsponse to the following question in the noncore portion of the sur-\nvey: \"During the past 30 days, that is, since [DATEFILL], on how\nmany days did you have 4 or more drinks on the same occasion?\"\nHeavy drinking was defined as 8 or more drinks per week during\nthe past 30 days for women or 15 or more drinks per week for men\nAlcohol dependence was defined as past-year drinking, 3 or more\n(of 7) dependence criteria, and consuming at least 1 drink on 6 or\nmore days in the past 12 months (11). The alcohol dependence\nquestions in the NSDUH align with the diagnostic criteria for al-\ncohol dependence in the fourth edition of the DSM (DSM-IV) (7).\nThese include tolerance, withdrawal, impaired control, unsuccess-\nful attempts to cut down or stop drinking, continued use despite\nproblems, neglect of activities, and time spent in alcohol-related\nactivity. The classification of alcohol dependence in this study is\nbased on self-reported responses to the NSDUH and is not based\non a diagnosis in a clinical setting or from medical records; there-\nfore, alcohol dependence in this study is based on respondents'\nsurvey data.\nSociodemographic characteristics assessed in this study were sex,\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaskan\nNative, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Asian, 2 races/\nethnicities, Hispanic or Latino), education level attained (<high\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nthe Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\nschool, high school, some college, college graduate), annual fam-\n$75,000), and employment status (full-time, part-time, unem-\nployed, other).\nStatistical analysis\nWe conducted analyses using SAS-callable SUDAAN version 10\n(SAS, SAS Institute Inc; SUDAAN, RTI International). NSDUH\nweights and survey design variables were used in the computation\nof all prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). As\npart of NSDUH's editing and imputation process, inconsistent or\nmissing data for the core variables and many sociodemographic\nvariables were statistically imputed using predictive mean neigh-\nborhood imputation (12). Respondents with missing data on vari-\nables that were not imputed were excluded from the analysis;\nhowever, item nonresponse for each of these variables was less\nthan 2%. Estimated weighted numbers are reported in thousands,\nand sample sizes are rounded to the nearest hundred.\nResults\nprevalence of past-month binge drinking was 27.4% (95% CI,\nble 1). The prevalence of excessive drinking, binge drinking, and\nalcohol dependence were highest among men, those aged 18 to 24,\nand those who were unemployed. Binge drinking was more com-\nmon among Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders (31.8%;\n28.1%\u00ad29.1%) than among other racial/ethnic groups, but most of\nthese differences were not significant. In contrast, the prevalence\nof alcohol dependence among current drinkers was significantly\nhigher among American Indians or Alaskan Natives (9.0%; 95%\nCI, 6.8%\u00ad11.8%) relative to other racial/ethnic groups.\nWhen evaluated by education, the prevalence of binge drinking\nwas significantly higher among those with some college educa-\nlevels of education. However, the prevalence of alcohol depend-\nence among those with less than a high school education (4.3%;\n95% CI, 3.9%\u00ad4.8%) was significantly higher than among those\nwith a high school education or college education but not higher\nthan the prevalence among those with some college. The preval-\nence of binge drinking was also significantly higher among those\nCI, 28.1%\u00ad29.6%) than among those with lower family incomes,\nwhereas the prevalence of alcohol dependence was significantly\nhigher among those with an annual family income of less than\nincome groups (Table 1).\nWhen evaluated by drinking pattern, the prevalence of alcohol de-\nble 2). The prevalence of alcohol dependence was significantly\nhigher among excessive drinkers and binge drinkers than among\nnon-binge drinkers across all sociodemographic groups. In con-\ntrast, the prevalence of alcohol dependence was similar among ex-\ncessive drinkers and binge drinkers across most groups except\nthose aged 18 to 24, among whom the prevalence of alcohol de-\npendence was significantly higher among binge drinkers (13.2%;\nAmong binge drinkers, the prevalence of alcohol dependence was\nCI, 12.7%\u00ad13.8%); it then decreased significantly with increasing\nage. Binge drinkers who were American Indians or Alaskan Nat-\nives had a significantly higher prevalence of alcohol dependence\nthan those in other racial/ethnic groups (28.1%; 95% CI,\n21.4%\u00ad36.0%), as did binge drinkers with less than a high school\ncompared with those in other groups in the same sociodemograph-\nic category (ie, education, income, and employment).\nThe prevalence of alcohol dependence increased significantly with\nthe frequency of binge drinking in the past month, ranging from\nmore times in the past month (Figure).\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nthe Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\nFigure.

Binge drinking was defined as consuming 5 or\nmore drinks (men) or 4 or more drinks (women) during a single occasion in the\nindicate 95% confidence intervals.\nDiscussion\nThis study found that about 9 of 10 adult excessive drinkers did\nnot meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence. About\n90% of the adults who drank excessively reported binge drinking,\nand the prevalence of alcohol dependence was similar among ex-\ncessive drinkers and binge drinkers across most sociodemograph-\nic groups. The prevalence of alcohol dependence also increased\nwith the frequency of binge drinking. However, even among those\nwho reported binge drinking 10 or more times in the past month,\nmore than two-thirds did not meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol\ndependence according to their responses to the survey.\nThe prevalence of alcohol dependence among adult excessive\ndrinkers and binge drinkers in this study was slightly higher than\nthe prevalence reported in other studies using the same diagnostic\ncriteria for the classification of alcohol dependence. A 2001 study\nof alcohol abuse and dependence among US adults using the Na-\ntional Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) -- the pre-\ncursor to the NSDUH -- found that the prevalence of alcohol de-\npendence was 7.4% among men and 7.3% among women who re-\nported binge drinking (13). The higher prevalence of alcohol de-\npendence among binge drinkers in this study may be due to the\ndifferent time period as well as differences in the survey methods,\nwhich make these estimates not directly comparable (14). The\nformer NHSDA was redesigned in 1999, and other changes were\nmade to the survey in 2002, which may have increased the sensit-\nivity of the NSDUH for identifying people who are binge drink-\ning and alcohol dependent.\nDifferences in the prevalence of alcohol dependence between the\nexcessive drinkers and 8.1% among binge drinkers) (8) are prob-\nably due to differences in the survey methods used by the NS-\nDUH and the BRFSS as well as differences in the populations\nConsistent with previous studies, binge drinking was most com-\nmon among men, those aged 18 to 24, non-Hispanics whites, those\nwith some college education, and those with an annual family in-\nmost common among American Indians or Alaskan Natives, those\nhaving less than a high school education, and those with an annu-\nal family income of less than $25,000. These findings may reflect\nthe known impact of alcohol dependence on many areas in the\ndrinker's life, including their ability to work and their productiv-\nity in the workplace. Reduced workplace productivity is the single\nlargest contributor to alcohol-attributable economic costs in the\nUnited States (1).\nThe strong relationship between the prevalence of excessive drink-\ning and binge drinking is also consistent with the findings of pre-\nvious studies (17), as is the higher prevalence of alcohol depend-\nence among binge drinkers relative to all current drinkers (8), and\nthe positive relationship between the frequency of binge drinking\nand alcohol dependence (18). These findings emphasize the use-\nfulness of screening for binge-level alcohol consumption to identi-\nfy excessive drinking among adults, including those who are alco-\nhol-dependent (19). The relatively low prevalence of alcohol de-\npendence among people who drink excessively also suggests that\nmost people who are screened for excessive drinking in clinical\nsettings will probably not need to be referred for specialized treat-\nment.\nThis study has several limitations. First, data for this study are\nbased on self-reported alcohol consumption, which tends to be un-\nderreported (20). However, NSDUH estimates of the prevalence\nof binge drinking among adults are significantly higher than those\nfrom other surveys of adults, such as the BRFSS (16). In addition,\nalthough the classification of alcohol dependence in this study is\nbased on self-reported responses to a survey, the questions used to\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nthe Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\nassess substance use disorders in the NSDUH have been found to\nbe sensitive and specific for identifying alcohol dependence\namong adults when tested in clinical settings (21). Second, al-\nthough the NSDUH collects information from residents of house-\nholds and noninstitutional group quarters (eg, shelters, rooming\nhouses, dormitories) and from civilians living on military bases,\nthe survey does not include homeless persons who were not living\nin shelters, military personnel on active duty, and residents of in-\nstitutional group quarters (eg, jails, long-term care facilities), and\nthe prevalence of excessive drinking -- including alcohol depend-\nence -- is known to be higher in some of these populations\nence by using DSM-IV criteria. In contrast, the new Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version 5 (DSM-5)\ndefines a spectrum of alcohol use disorders, and based on these\ndiagnostic criteria, alcohol dependence would be classified as a\nsevere alcohol use disorder. However, a study of patients with a\nknown substance use disorder found that the prevalence of severe\nalcohol use disorders was only 0.5% higher than the prevalence of\nalcohol dependence (24). Another study assessing the drinking be-\nNESARC survey) estimated that the prevalence of severe alcohol\nuse disorders based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria was only about\n1.1% higher than the prevalence of alcohol dependence according\nto DSM-IV criteria (25). Taken together, these findings suggest\nthat the use of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence\nin this study probably resulted in only a slightly lower estimate of\nthe prevalence of severe alcohol problems than would have been\nobtained using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.\nThe findings of this study have important implications for plan-\nning and implementing public health interventions to reduce ex-\ncessive drinking and binge drinking at the population level. Al-\nthough alcohol dependence is an important public health problem,\nthese findings suggest that most excessive drinkers are unlikely to\nneed addiction treatment. Studies have also found that binge\ndrinking, in particular, is strongly affected by alcohol policies in\nstates (26). The Community Preventive Services Task Force re-\ncommends several policy strategies for reducing excessive alco-\nhol use and related harms that are likely to be effective across\nmany sociodemographic categories, including increasing alcohol\ntaxes, regulating alcohol outlet density, and dram shop (commer-\ncial host) liability (27).\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force also recommends alcohol\nscreening and brief counseling for excessive alcohol use among\nadults in primary care settings (28). However, recent studies have\nfound that these prevention strategies are underused -- probably\nbecause of timing constraints, lack of training, discomfort with\ndiscussing substance use, or insurance coverage limitations. The\nuptake of alcohol screening and brief interventions might be im-\nproved by offering health care providers more training opportunit-\nies and by including coverage for alcohol screening and brief in-\nterventions in standard health insurance plans (19,29). A compre-\nhensive approach to reducing excessive alcohol use that emphas-\nizes the implementation of effective policy strategies and clinical\npreventive services, similar to the Best Practices for Comprehens-\nive Tobacco Control Programs -- 2007 (30), might therefore be\nexpected to have a greater impact on reducing excessive alcohol\nuse and related harms than a more focused strategy that primarily\nrelies on the implementation of addiction treatment services alone.\n"
