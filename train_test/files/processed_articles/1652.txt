This paper examines the long-term consequences of early adult\noverweight for midlife health and socioeconomic attainment using prospective nationally representative panel data\nfrom American adults in the Monitoring the Future Study (1986\u00ad2008). Growth mixture models identified 2 distinct\nlatent classes of trajectories of body mass index (BMI) from age 19 to 35 years: a persistently overweight class\n(BMI >25 kg/m2) and a second class exhibiting more moderate growth in BMI to age 35 years. Women (odds ratio\n(OR) \u00bc 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39, 3.36) and those from a lower childhood socioeconomic position\n(OR \u00bc 1.71, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.24) were more likely to be in the persistently overweight class. Compared with those in\nthe moderately increasing BMI class, those in the persistently overweight class were more likely to have a chronic\n(OR \u00bc 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.69), and to have a higher odds of receiving welfare or unemployment compensation at\nobesity and overweight early in the life course.\nhuman development; obesity; social class\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; MTF; OR, odds ratio; SES, socioeconomic status.\nThe prevalence of obesity has been increasing (1\u00ad6), with\nwell-documented health consequences (7, 8). Obesity has\nrepeatedly been associated with increased risk for cardiovas-\ncular disease, diabetes, cancer, and physical disability (9\u00ad\n12), with adverse effects of lifetime cumulative obesity for\nsubsequent mobility limitations (13), mortality (14\u00ad16), and\nthe onset of physical impairment up to 50 years later (17).\nA parallel but smaller body of work has examined the\nsocial and economic consequences of early life obesity\nand overweight. Obesity is associated with lower self-\nesteem in adolescent girls (7, 18) and with persistent dele-\nterious effects on self-esteem (19), as well as lower wages\n(20), into adulthood. American women who were obese in\nadolescence were found to have lower levels of social\nachievement in early adulthood (fewer years of advanced\neducation, lower rates of marriage, higher rates of poverty)\nthan women whowere not obese at the same ages (21). Similar\nfindings were found using data from the British Cohort Study,\nwhere persistent obesity in women between the ages of 10 and\n30 years was associated with never having been gainfully\nemployed and not having a current partner (22). However,\nobesity limited only to childhood showed no persistent socio-\neconomic effects into adulthood (22).\nFrom a life course perspective (23, 24), the long-term\nhealth and socioeconomic consequences of early life over-\nweight and obesity may unfold through processes of cumu-\nlative disadvantage (25\u00ad30). Evidence from clinical and\npopulation studies suggests that early life socioeconomic\ndisadvantage beginning in utero leads to low birth weight\nand rapid growth during infancy, which increases the risk for\nchildhood as well as adult obesity, along with the subse-\nquent risk for adult chronic diseases (31\u00ad37). In turn, health\nproblems decrease socioeconomic reserves to manage and\ncope with existing conditions, resulting in the progression of\nhealth problems and reinforcement of socioeconomic disad-\nvantage throughout the life course.\nYet, most of the literature on the long-term implications\nof overweight and obesity is not based on prospective lon-\ngitudinal data with repeated measures to permit a full ex-\namination of this process of cumulative disadvantage over\nthe life course. Typically, researchers use 2 data points to\nrelate early life weight with later life health and mortality\n(e.g., Viner and Cole (22)). As a result, the full scope of\nvariability within 2 discrete data points is ignored. More-\nover, it is unclear from these studies whether it is simply\nearly life obesity or persistent obesity across adulthood\nthat has consequences for later health and socioeconomic\nattainment--issues that cannot be differentiated with only\n2 data points.\nThis paper uses repeated measures of weight gathered\nprospectively from age 19 to 40 years to capture the full\ncourse of weight change across the transition from young\nadulthood to midlife. We hypothesize that there may be\ndistinct patterns of weight gain over adulthood with differ-\nent consequences for midlife health and socioeconomic\nattainment. We bring together the literatures in life course\nepidemiology with those in obesity research using nation-\nally representative prospective data on American young\nadults and their transition to mid-adulthood over a 22-year\nperiod.\nStudy population\nData were drawn from the Monitoring the Future project,\na nationwide school-based survey of substance use and re-\nlated attitudes and beliefs conducted annually in the United\nStates since 1975 (38). The survey also includes self-reported\nmeasures of respondents' weight and height collected since\n1986. Monitoring the Future is a cohort sequential study\n(described in more detail elsewhere (39)) involving a nation-\nally representative sample of high school seniors surveyed in\nthe spring of each year (approximately 15,000 per year).\nEach year's data collection takes place in about 135 public\nand private high schools selected to provide an accurate\nrepresentative cross section of 12th graders throughout the\ncoterminous United States.\nA representative subsample (~2,400 students/year) is ran-\ndomly selected from each cohort for 7 biennial follow-ups\nto the age of 32 years, and then at age 35 years and every\n5 years thereafter, using self-completed mailed question-\nnaires. Drug users were oversampled for participation in\nthe panel component by a factor of 3.0 and then reweighted\nin the analyses, as discussed below. To ease respondent\nburden, panel respondents are randomly assigned to receive\n1 of 5 different questionnaires, each with its own set of\nquestions. Since 1986, a random one-fifth of respondents\n(approximately 480 students per class) received the ques-\ntionnaire asking about height and weight. For our purposes\nwe focus on subjects in 11 high school cohorts entering the\nindividuals who were between the ages of 19 and 40 years\nover this 22-year period. Repeat measures of height and\n40 years, whichever comes first. There were no exclusion\ncriteria. All study procedures are reviewed and approved on\nan annual basis by the University of Michigan's Institutional\nReview Board for compliance with federal guidelines for\nthe treatment of human subjects.\nMeasures\nWeight gain over adulthood was captured with measure-\nment of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). A BMI score of 25\u00ad\n29 is used to define ``overweight,'' while a BMI score of 30\nor above represents ``obese'' (40). Three variables capture\nkey indicators of early social position found to be related to\nlifetime obesity as well as to midlife health and socioeco-\nnomic attainment: 1) gender; 2) race/ethnicity (self-reported\nby respondents and modeled using 3 dummy variables con-\ntrasting black, Hispanic, and other race/ethnic (including\nAsian) respondents with non-Hispanic white respondents);\nand 3) childhood socioeconomic status (SES) (the maxi-\nmum of the respondent's parents' education, dichotomized\nas high school degree or less vs. college degree or higher).\nRegion of residence in senior year of high school (South,\nNorth Central, Northeast, and West) captures elements of\nthe surrounding socioeconomic and environmental context\nthat may be related to BMI trajectories over and above in-\ndividual socioeconomic and sociodemographic risk (41).\nWe also adjust for high school academic performance cap-\ntured through an ordinal 9-category measure of average\ngrade in high school (modeled using the midpoint value of\neach category).\nFive measures capture health and social position at age 40\nyears. The presence of any chronic health problem is cap-\ntured with a dummy variable to indicate any 1 of 6 medi-\ncally diagnosed chronic health conditions reported by the\nrespondent at age 40 years (hypertension, diabetes, asthma,\nchronic lung disease (including chronic bronchitis or em-\nphysema), heart disease, and cancer). Four dummy variables\ncapture social and economic hardship at age 40 years: was\non welfare or received unemployment compensation in the\nprevious year; home ownership; no current partner; and\nthose who, by age 40 years, had not received any further\neducation beyond high school.\nStatistical analyses\nWe used generalized growth mixture modeling to identify\nlatent classes of individuals according to their long-term\npatterns of BMI growth and then examined the relation\nbetween trajectory classes and midlife health and social\noutcomes at age 40 years. Growth mixture modeling is an\nextension of conventional growth modeling that relaxes the\nassumption of a single population trajectory. By using latent\ntrajectory classes (categorical latent variables), the growth\nmixture model allows different classes of individuals to vary\naround different mean growth curves (42, 43). The trajec-\ntory of interest in this paper is weight gain (captured with\nBMI), measured prospectively from young adulthood (age\nMidlife Consequences of Persistent Overweight 541\n19 years) to age 35 years, as it relates to midlife health and\nsocial outcomes at age 40 years.\nThe structural part of the model incorporates the growth\nmodel within a larger latent variable model by relating the\ngrowth factors to other observed and latent variables. Of\nparticular interest is the latent trajectory class variable,\nwhich represents the unobserved subpopulation of member-\nship for respondents. Early life sociodemographic covari-\nates predict class membership in a multinomial logistic\nregression. As a general extension of the growth mixture\nmodel, we include distal outcomes, health, and socioeco-\nnomic attainment at age 40 years, which are predicted from\nthe growth model controlling for early life sociodemo-\ngraphic covariates (43).\nModel building proceeded in a sequential process by\nfirst specifying the measurement model and then incremen-\ntally increasing the number of latent classes. Good-fitting\nmodels are characterized by 1) a low value for the Bayes-\nian Information Criterion and Akaike Information Crite-\nrion; 2) a statistically significant Lo-Mendell-Rubin\nlikelihood ratio test; 3) distinct posterior probabilities for\nindividual class membership; and 4) differences in the\nmean outcome variable across classes (42, 43). All models\nare estimated in Mplus version 5.2 (44) using full informa-\ntion maximum likelihood with robust standard errors. Mul-\ntiple random starts are used to minimize local optimal in\nthe likelihood. Respondent-level weights are used to adjust\nfor unequal selection probabilities in the panel study.\nRetention rates in the panel respondents are highest in the\nfirst follow-up after high school (averaging 70%) and fall to\nan average of 64% in the biennial follow-ups through to age\nare about 52% (38). Using logistic regression analysis (with\nbackward elimination), we modeled the probability of study\nretention to age 40 years according to a broad array of\nbaseline characteristics and found that white race and re-\nporting of a higher average grade in high school increased\nthe odds of retention. By including these variables in our\nmodels, maximum likelihood produces unbiased coeffi-\ncients under the assumption that the attrition process is con-\nditional on observed variables in our models (45\u00ad47).\nRESULTS\nSociodemographic characteristics at senior year for the\nstudy sample are presented in Table 1. On average, respon-\ndents had a normal weight in the year following high school\ncohorts of American adults gained weight steadily over adult-\nhood, reporting an average BMI of 27.0 (standard deviation,\n4.4) by age 40 years. Consistent with other national surveys\n(e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nof the study sample by midlife, and roughly one-third had any\n1 of 6 chronic health problems. A minority of respondents\nwere receiving welfare or unemployment compensation at the\nage of 40 years, and just under half had no further education\nbeyond high school.\nTable 2 reports the fit statistics for a progression of growth\nmixture models. The first row (model A) pertains to the\nlinear single-class model. Average BMI at age 19 years is\nBMI at each time point is roughly normal, justifying the\nlinear model.) The fit of the model improves by allowing\nfor correlated error between BMI measures at adjacent time\npoints (model B) (all 7 correlations are statistically significant\nThe third row of Table 2 (model C) reports the fit statistics\nfor the 2-class solution. The change in the Bayesian Infor-\nmation Criterion and Akaike Information Criterion values,\ncoupled with a significant Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ra-\ntio test (P < 0.001), suggests that a 2-class solution is pref-\nerable to a single-class model. Membership in each class\nshowed good classification quality, with individuals most\nlikely to belong to their predicted class (posterior probabil-\nity is markedly higher (>0.90) than for the other class).\nAdding a third class (model not shown) did not result in\nany improvement in model fit, and the posterior probabili-\nties did not differentiate class membership well.\nFigure 1 shows the estimated growth curves for BMI from\nage 19 to 35 years according to the 2-class solution (ob-\nserved mean BMI scores are also plotted for each class).\nThe 2 curves represent 2 distinct trajectories of BMI growth\nfrom early adulthood: Class 1 (with 80.9% of the sample)\nrepresents the majority of the sample, which we term the\n``normative class,'' with an average BMI of 21.4 following\nhigh school and a steady rate of growth in BMI up to age\nin class 2 (19.1% of the sample) were on average overweight\nat high school graduation (mean BMI \u00bc 25.7) and gained\nweight more rapidly throughout the next 15 years\noverweight class.''

The model\nalso specifies class-specific effects of the covariates on the\ngrowth factors. For ease of model interpretation, average\ngrade in high school is centered at the mean. The fit of the\nmodel improves significantly, and the results provide insight\ninto the underlying reasons for the different trajectory pat-\nterns. Table 3 reports the results from the logistic regression\nfor class membership (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confi-\ndence intervals using the normative latent class as the ref-\nerence class. Compared with individuals in the normative\nclass, individuals in the persistently overweight class are\nmore likely to be female and to come from a lower socio-\neconomic background. (See also descriptive statistics by\nlatent class, Table 1.) The odds of membership in the per-\nsistently overweight class are significantly reduced among\nthose with a higher average grade in high school (controlling\nfor childhood SES and other covariates).

Table 4 presents the\nunstandardized regression coefficients (with standard errors)\nfor the effects of the covariates on BMI intercept and slope\nfor each of the 2 latent classes. Within the persistently over-\nweight class, the rate of growth in BMI is more rapid for\nwomen (although their initial status at age 19 years is some-\nwhat lower on average than that of men). On the other hand,\nthe rate of growth in the persistently overweight class is\nsignificantly attenuated among those residing in the North\nCentral and South regions of the United States. Within the\nnormative class, Hispanics have a much faster rate of growth\nin BMI than whites, all other factors held constant.\nThe next step in the modeling process adds the distal out-\ncomes at age 40 years. In these models, membership in a par-\nticular latent trajectory class between ages 19 and 35 years\npredicts health and SES at age 40 years, controlling for early\nlife sociodemographic factors. Table 5 presents the odds ratios\nfor these midlife outcomes using the normative class as the\nreference class. Relative to those who leave high school with\na normalBMIand gainweightgraduallyoveradulthood,those\nwho are persistently overweight have odds of reporting any\nmedically diagnosed chronic health condition at age 40 years\nthat are over 3-fold higher (odds ratio (OR) \u00bc 3.33, adjusted\nfor baseline covariates). Part of this effect appears to operate\nthrough mediating processes that may lie on the causal path-\nway, including financial hardship (being on welfare or collect-\ning unemployment compensation), a lack of further education\nbeyond high school, and lack of a current partner (adjusted\nOR \u00bc 2.74), but there remains a net direct effect of persistent\noverweight on the risk for chronic health problems at age 40\nyears. There is also a net effect of persistent overweight on the\nwhich remains after adjusting for potential confounders and\nmediators.\nWhen adjusted for baseline sociodemographic characteris-\ntics, the odds of reporting socioeconomic hardship at age 40\nyears in the form of receiving welfare or unemployment\ncompensation are over 50% greater for those who remain\npersistently overweight compared with those in the normative\nclass (OR \u00bc 1.76). However, most of this effect operates\nthrough intervening statuses, including the onset of health\nproblems and the lack of further education and a current\npartner (adjusted OR \u00bc 1.36). Thus, it is the elevated risk\nfor socioeconomic hardship and health problems associated\nwith persistent overweight that increases the risk for receiv-\ning welfare or unemployment compensation at age 40 years,\nnot the history of persistent overweight per se. Similarly,\nsome of the effect of persistent overweight on having no\ncurrent partner in midlife operates through intervening mech-\nanisms such as health problems and socioeconomic hardship.\nHowever, there remains a moderate (marginally statistically\nsignificant) net effect of persistent overweight on having no\nTable 2.

We found 2 distinct patterns of BMI\ngrowth over early adulthood (ages 19\u00ad35 years) in a national\nsample of Americans followed over a 22-year period. One\npattern is slow, steady growth following a normal BMI in\nhigh school. The other represents people who started out\nwith a high BMI in high school (BMI >25) and remained\npersistently overweight throughout early adulthood. We\nfound notable health and socioeconomic consequences of\nbeing in the persistently overweight class. Those who were\npersistently overweight were more likely to have a medi-\ncally diagnosed chronic health problem at age 40 years.\nThese include nontrivial medical conditions surfacing at\na relatively young age. Compared with those experiencing\nmore gradual weight gain, the persistently overweight\nwere also more likely to have pursued no further education\nTable 4.

Persis-\ntent overweight was also associated with higher odds of\nreceiving welfare or unemployment compensation at age\n40 years, which was found to operate partly through health\nand socioeconomic pathways.\nEarly life disadvantage is a critical factor in membership\nin these 2 trajectories. Persons from low SESs were more\nlikely to be in the persistently overweight class, controlling\nfor gender, race/ethnicity, and geographic region of the\nUnited States. As early life socioeconomic disadvantage in-\ncreases exposure to risk and as socioeconomic advantage\nincreases exposure to opportunity (29), the ``Matthew ef-\nfect'' comes into play (48). Referring to the Gospel of\nSt. Matthew--``For unto every one that hath shall be given\nand he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall\nbe taken away even that which he hath''--the Matthew ef-\nfect describes how those in advantaged social circumstances\nare better able to reinforce their position by accruing better\njobs and income and more education and health benefits over\nthe course of their lives, thereby reducing their exposure to\nrisk factors and lifestyles that typically compromise health.\nConversely, those with fewer resources are at increased risk\nfor health and socioeconomic decline as exposure to disad-\nvantage multiplies over the life course in the form of cumu-\nlative inequality that reinforces their position of social and\nHowever, we also found that the odds of membership in\nthe persistently overweight class were significantly reduced\namong those with a higher average grade in high school\n(controlling for childhood SES), suggesting that individual\nresources and other collective social capital operating in the\nschool setting can attenuate the risk for obesity and over-\nweight even among those from a lower SES. These findings\nsuggest that strategies aimed at supporting socially disad-\nvantaged youth in the school context may hold promise for\naltering their trajectory of weight gain and subsequent\nhealth and socioeconomic challenges. Consistent with find-\nings that suggest that reducing educational disengagement\nand increasing academic performance can contribute to less\ncigarette and other drug use (49), our results here suggest\nthat academic performance in high school, to the extent that\nit can be fostered and promoted in socially disadvantaged\nyouth, has the potential to alter the trajectory of adult weight\ngain and subsequent midlife outcomes.\nRegarding limitations, we cannot be certain of the causal\nassociations assumed in these analyses, although the use of\nlongitudinal data identifies the temporal sequence consistent\nwith the assumed casual sequence. Ideally we would have\nliked to include a control for early life health status, but such\na measure is not available in these data. However, we endeav-\nored to account for early life health and social risk by in-\ncluding measures of childhood SES and race/ethnicity, which\nare highly correlated with early life health status (50, 51).\nAnother limitation includes nonrandom attrition in the panel\ndata, but this was to some degree statistically adjusted for in\nthe analyses. Self-reported measures of weight tend to be\nunderestimated (52), and this varies by education, gender,\nand race/ethnicity. However, if this underreporting is consis-\ntent over time, the slope estimates for the growth trajectories\nshould not be affected.\nIn sum, these results highlight the importance of under-\nstanding midlife health and socioeconomic attainment from\na life course perspective, where early life disadvantage man-\nifests in more rapid weight gain throughout early adulthood,\nwith adverse consequences for midlife outcomes. Tailoring\npolicies and interventions to the needs and circumstances of\nthe poorest population groups is therefore critical for stem-\nming the cycle of cumulative disadvantage.\n"
