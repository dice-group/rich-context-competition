Previous literature suggests that increases in the medical use of opioids over the early\n1990s did not contribute to increased morbidity secondary to opioid abuse. Our objective was to\nevaluate the period 1997\u00ad2001 to analyze trends in medical use and medical abuse of three classes\nof opioid analgesics that are commonly used in sustained-release formulations: fentanyl, morphine,\nand oxycodone.\nDesign and Setting. A retrospective analysis of the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data-\nbase and the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) database for the\nResults. The analysis of the DAWN database showed that there was an 83.5% increase in all opioid\nanalgesic mentions from 1997 to 2001. Mentions involving any fentanyl compound increased\n249.8%, any morphine compound increased 161.8%, and any oxycodone-containing compound\nincreased 267.3%. Mentions of each of these three classes of opioids remained less than 2% of all\ntotal drug mentions per year for each year studied. Medical use of the selected opioid classes, as\nreported in the ARCOS database and measured by grams distributed, all increased substantially\nConclusion. Using this method of analysis, the rates of drug abuse, and resultant morbidity\nsecondary to the use of opioid analgesics, remain low in spite of the increase in medical use of these\nsubstances.\nKey Words.

It has\nbeen suggested that 40\u00ad80% of patients with\ncancer pain experience inadequate pain manage-\nment [1]. This statistic is bothersome when one\nconsiders that current pain medicine specialists\nsuggest that as many as 90% of patients with\ncancer pain may be effectively treated with present\npharmacological therapies [2]. Chronic nonmalig-\nnant pain also continues as a significant problem\nthroughout the industrialized world, with a\nreported prevalence of 10\u00ad55%, depending on the\ndefinition used to characterize this disorder [3].\nThe treatment of chronic pain is complicated\nby evidence that nonmedical use and abuse of pre-\nscription opioids are rising in the United States.\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health,\nwhich was formally called the National Household\nSurvey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), reported that 2\nmillion people in the United States aged 12 and\nolder used a prescription opioid for nonmedical\nnumber was approximately four times the value\nreported per year in the mid 1980s. The NHSDA\nalso reported that survey questions pertaining to\nprescription opioid dependence yielded data that\nindicated a significant increase (P < 0.05) from\nIn April 2000, Joranson et al. analyzed the\ntrends of use and potential drug abuse of five major\nclasses of opioid analgesics--morphine, fentanyl,\noxycodone, hydromorphone, and meperidine [6].\nThe methodology they employed was a compari-\nson of mentions of each class of opioid, using the\nDrug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data-\nbase, to the trends of cumulative distribution\nof grams of these opioid classes, using the U.S.\nDrug Enforcement Administration's Automation\nof Reports and Consolidated Orders System\nThose authors' results included the finding that, as\nmeasured by the DAWN system, opioid analgesics\nwere responsible for a small proportion of emer-\ngency department (ED) visits due to drug abuse\nduring the period studied. The proportion of men-\ntions of opioid abuse relative to the total number of\nreports of drug abuse actually decreased from 5.1%\nto 3.8% over the 7-year period, and all of the\nclasses of opioids studied had a decline in mentions\nin the DAWN database except for morphine,\nwhich increased by 3.2%. The mentions of all five\nclasses of drugs compared with the total mentions\nwere less than 1% for each year studied. These\nfindings all occurred as the trends in medical use of\nfour of the five classes of opioids in both total dis-\ntribution and grams, adjusted per population,\nincreased (meperidine showed a decrease). The\nauthors concluded that \"the trend of increasing\nmedical use of opioids to treat pain does not appear\nto contribute to increases in the health conse-\nquences of opioid analgesic abuse\" [6].\nCan today's health care provider continue to\ndraw this same conclusion, or has newer data\nrevealed other trends of special importance in\nopioid prescriptive patterns? This is of special\nconcern to generalists, who see the vast majority of\nthe aging population that is experiencing chronic\npain. The aim of this study is to conduct an analy-\nsis similar to that done by Joranson et al. to provide\na more recent comparison of trends of medical use\nand possible abuse of opioid analgesics.\nMethods\nGiven that there has been an increased availabil-\nity of sustained-release opioids to treat severe pain\nduring the period since the previous study\nthe three major classes of these compounds--\noxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl--currently\nused by generalists to treat chronic pain.\nThe DAWN database was used as the source for\ntrends in drug abuse. This data source, which is\nsponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nis described in detail in the original Joranson et al.\narticle [6]. All statistical information involving the\nincidence of drug abuse used for this analysis was\nobtained using the SAMHSA website [7].\nDAWNtracesdrug-relatedEDepisodesthrough\nretrospective examination of medical records. It is\nnot a measure of prevalence of drug use in a popu-\nlation [8]. It may be more accurate to describe it as\na measure of drug-related morbidity and mortality\nprobability sample of hospitals designed to produce\nrepresentative estimates of ED drug episodes and\ndrug mentions for the coterminous United States\nand 21 metropolitan areas [8].\nDrug episodes include ED visits that are\ninduced by or related to the use of illegal drugs or\nthe nonmedical use of legal drugs in patients aged\n6\u00ad97 years. Drug mentions refer to drugs men-\ntioned per episode. There may be up to four drugs\nmentioned per episode, with an average of 1.8\ndrugs mentioned per episode in 2001. Multidrug\nepisodes were reported 56.2% of the time during\nthat year. Drugs reported are divided into two\nmajor categories. \"Major substances of abuse\"\nincludes the most common illicit drugs reported\nto DAWN (cocaine, marijuana, and heroin) and\nalcohol reported in combination with other sub-\nstances. (Alcohol is not recorded unless it is used\nin combination with another substance.) \"Other\nsubstances of abuse\" includes generic classifica-\ntions of drugs that are prescription or over-the-\ncounter preparations. The three categories of\ndrugs studied fall into this category. Substances\nreferred to as narcotic analgesics in DAWN pub-\nlications have been renamed opioid analgesics for\nthis analysis. It is extremely important to note that\nDAWN publications acknowledge that estimates\nfrom the database may not be used to make direct\nestimates of drugs marketed under trade names, so\nall conclusions made from estimates are at best,\ntrends of classes of substances mentioned.\nExamples of the types of drug episodes reported\ninclude drug-induced suicide attempts, nonlethal\ndrug overdoses, withdrawal episodes requiring\nED attention, or undesired drug reactions [10].\nDAWN data are attractive to researchers because\nthe nonmedical use of legal drugs is included in\nthe database. Unfortunately, information as to\nwhether the drug was obtained by a legal pre-\nscription method, or by drug diversion, is not\nincluded. Information regarding how the drug was\ningested is also not included.\nData from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Admin-\nistration's ARCOS database were again used to\nanalyze trends in the medical use of opioids.\nManufacturers and distributors of Schedule I, II,\nand III narcotic materials, and selected Schedule\nIII and IV psychotropic drugs, are required to\nreport commercial distribution to hospitals, retail\npharmacies, practitioners, midlevel practitioners,\nand teaching institutions under this system [11].\nThe data are intended for use in identifying the\ndiversion of controlled substances. All information\nused for this analysis involving the medical use of\nopioids was obtained from the U.S. Department\nof Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration's\nARCOS retail drug summary website [12]. Infor-\nmation used for this analysis includes reports of\nthe three drug compounds in grams distributed\nto note that information was not provided on this\nwebsite for compounds containing fentanyl or\nTo aid in the interpretation of the ARCOS data,\nadjusted for equivalency, with morphine as the\nreference standard. For example, with respect to\npotency, 30mg of sustained-release morphine is\nequivalent to 20mg of controlled-release oxy-\ncodone, or a 25-mg transdermal fentanyl patch\n[13,14]. For our analysis requiring equivalency\nconversion, grams of opioid substance distributed\nlation were multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and\ntiplied by a factor of 100. The fentanyl conversion\nfactor was calculated by first using the fact that\ndrug over a 72-hour period.

It is important to remember when ana-\nlyzing these data that fentanyl is approximately\n100 times more potent than morphine and that\nfentanyl usage is currently similar on a unit-dosage\nbasis to the other long-acting opioid compounds.\nFigure 1 allows for a comparison of trends in\nabuse of the compounds studied.

Since the original Joranson et al.\nstudy [6], there have been multiple national con-\nsensus statements published about the use of\nopioids for chronic pain, as well as task force meet-\nings and study groups to study this issue [15].\nThe data analyzed in this study suggest that\nopioid analgesics continue to be a small part of drug\nabuse as measured by the DAWN system. As\nJoranson et al. originally noted, abuse levels, as\nreflected by this database, have remained low in\nspite of the greater availability of these substances.\nThese data are consistent with those reported\nfor the Treatment Episode Data Sets (TEDS) in\ntreatment centers reported in that database were\nattributed to \"opiates other than heroin.\" This\nclassification included nonprescription use of metha-\ndone, codeine, morphine, oxycodone, hydromor-\nphone, meperidine, opium, and other drugs with\nmorphine-like effects. In fact, the National Drug\nIntelligence Center has stated that, \"The illegal\nabuse of pharmaceuticals, medicinal drugs legally\navailable by prescription or over the counter, is the\nlowest threat among major drug categories\" [17].\nOn the other hand, total opioid analgesic abuse\nhas continued to rise as evidenced by total number\nof mentions (83.5%) and percentage of total\nmentions (from 5.7% to 8.5%, an increase of\n48.4%). The large percentage increase in men-\ntions of compounds containing oxycodone alone\nThere are many limitations to a study using this\nmethodology. Joranson et al. mentioned problems\nwith the DAWN database itself, including the fact\nthat the system obviously underreports the true\nextent of drug abuse as it only reports admissions\nto an ED. Caulkins et al. have also extensively\ncritiqued the DAWN database [18]. One particu-\nlar area of concern is that there are numerous\nfactors that influence ED usage that can vary over\nlocation and time. The SAMHSA is aware of the\nconcerns about the limitations of the DAWN\nsystem and has developed a new design that will\nAnother concern of the DAWN system of col-\nlection is that suicide attempts are included in the\ntotal numbers of mentions [20]. As there have\nbeen a substantial number of reports of psychiatric\ncomorbidity, and especially depression, in patients\nwith drug abuse problems, there remains a ques-\ntion as to whether the use of the controlled\nsubstance is actually related to abuse or to a psy-\nchiatric disorder.\nA final limitation is that we are unable to iden-\ntify any specific drug by brand name using this\nmethodology. The analyses simply allow for an\noverview of trends in abuse and use of classes of\ndrugs that are available in sustained-release\nformulations.\nThere are multiple areas of further research\nsuggested by this analysis. The effect of the exten-\nsive media focus in the lay literature on opioid\nuse and abuse on provider prescribing patterns of\nthese substances is an area that should be exam-\nined. This analysis should also examine the effect\nof the media on a patient's willingness to accept\nopioids for the treatment of chronic pain. The\neffect of Drug Enforcement Agency reactions to\nthe potential of \"escalating abuse and diversion\"\nof prescription opioids is also an area that may\nprovide insight into government regulatory influ-\nence on health care provider treatment regimens\n[21]. The reasons that opioid use has increased,\nand for what classes of patients, are important\npotential areas of research, at least in part, to\nmeasure our successes and shortcomings in pain\nmanagement. Finally, there continues to be a need\nto design better methods of determining the actual\nMedical Use and Abuse of Sustained-Release Opioids 63\nYear\nMentions per adjusted grams\nOxycodone compounds\nMorphine compounds\nFentanyl compounds\nFigure 1 DAWN mentions of opioids divided by grams per\nby a conversion factor of 1.5 and fentanyl grams per\nof 100 to obtain interdrug equivalency.\nprevalence of prescription drug abuse, and espe-\ncially that of opioids in their use for chronic pain\ntreatment.\nConclusion\nHow then does one address the question of\nwhether the trend of increasing use of opioids to\ntreat pain contributes to increases in opioid anal-\ngesic abuse and related morbidity? Prescription\nopioid abuse continues, as measured by the\nDAWN system, and this abuse is growing. This\nincrease in prescription opioid abuse is substanti-\nated by other epidemiologic data sources such as\nthe NHSDA. This trend in increased opioid abuse\nhas been accompanied by a large number of media\nreports that have often been sensational [22,23].\nThese reports have fueled physician fears about\nincreased addiction potential as well as potential\ngovernmental investigation of prescribing prac-\ntices involving controlled substances [15,24].\nThere is tremendous concern that these reports\ncould potentially undo advances that have been\nmade in improvement in chronic pain control. To\navoid the possibility of this occurrence, the health\ncare system must continue to provide education\nabout pain control and addiction. At the same time,\ndiversion control programs must continue to strive\nto improve detection of opioid abuse without\ninterfering with their appropriate medical use.\nReferences\n1 Murphy-Ende K.
