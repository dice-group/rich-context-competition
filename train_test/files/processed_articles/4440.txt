For some the term represents an archetypal postpolitical construct that enables urban\npopulations and policy makers to confront collective problems in a consensus-driven way. In short,\nit enables a new conflict-free politics to emerge within cities. This paper uses the example of Taipei,\nTaiwan to explore how sustainable development agendas in a postcolonial city, which has a relatively\nyoung democratic system, are articulated and with what effects. It examines the utility of recent\npostpolitical writing as an explanatory frame for contemporary political changes.

    "reduced_content": "Introduction\nSince the early 1990s the concept of sustainability has underpinned urban development\npolicies and programmes in cities worldwide. It is used by the United Nations (UN),\namongst others, to promote `good governance', `participatory development', and\n`environmental stewardship', and it explicitly draws on, and institutionalises, Third\nWay principles of governance. These, as Swyngedouw (2009) notes,\n``reconfigure the act of governing to a stakeholder-based arrangement of governance\nin which the traditional state forms (national, regional, and local government)\npartake together with experts, non-governmental organisations and other responsible\nFor a growing group of postpolitical writers sustainability programmes thus\nbecome vehicles for the replacement of the adversarial class politics of the postwar\nperiod with a new politics, founded on consensus building, collaboration, and a non-\nideological neopragmatism (see Beck and Sznaider, 2006; Giddens, 2009). They provide\na foundation for a politics of inclusion founded on the identification of `collective'\ninterests and agendas that go beyond narrowly defined class interests. Such politics,\nit is argued, recharacterises politics as a technical, project-focused activity, beyond\nconflict. It assumes that policy interventions can be made that benefit all.\nWhilst such debates over politics, the political, and sustainability provide explana-\ntions of change at a more abstract level, they also open up a number of more empirical\nquestions over the geographical diversity of political systems and the role of different\nforms of agency, context, and path dependency in the development of contemporary\npolicy programmes. We know relatively little, for example, about who the agents of\nThird Way postpolitical agendas are in different cities and countries and from where\ntheir understandings and interpretations of terms such as consensus politics and\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies\nof postpoliticism: a case study of Taipei\nMike Raco\nBartlett School of Planning, University College London, Wates House, Gordon Street, London\nWC1H 0QB, England; e-mail: m.raco@ucl.ac.uk\nWen-I Lin\u00f4\nGraduate Institute of Urban Planning, National Taipei University, 151 University Rd, San-Shia\nDistrict, New Taipei City, 237 Taiwan; e-mail: wenilin@mail.ntpu.edu.tw\n Keywords: postpolitics, conflict, consensus, sustainability, Taiwan\n\u00f4 Corresponding author.\nsustainability are taken from. Writers on the `postpolitical condition' (cf Rancie\noften draw on abstract conclusions about the class-based nature of adversarial politics\nand engage in a limited way with questions of diversity, or what Ong (2007) terms the\npolicy `crystallisations' that form through global and local interactions and boundary\ncrossings across the world. These geographies of postpoliticism often remain implicit\nleaving critical writing on the governance of sustainability open to charges of top-down\npolitical ^ economic determinism. Writing is often founded on a Eurocentrism that\nseeks to generate universal theories from the postwar experiences of a relatively small,\nalbeit powerful, group of countries. It remains unclear what, for example, consensus\npolitics means in a postcolonial context, in societies in which democracy is a relatively\nrecent phenomenon, or where very different state practices and social dynamics operate.\nIt is in this context that we draw on a study of the (post)politics of sustainability\nplanning in Taipei, Taiwan. We develop Krueger and Gibbs's (2007, page 2) concern that\n``the politics of sustainability represents a gap in the current sustainability literature''\nthat precludes the development of broader conceptual abstractions over development\nand change. We explore the interrelationships between writing on postpoliticism and\nthe concepts and agendas that underpin local sustainability discourses. Taipei repre-\nsents an excellent example of a postcolonial context in which there exist significant\ndevelopment ^ sustainability tensions and a relatively novel democratic system. It is\nalso `off the map' in dominant Eurocentric writing about urban development and has\nembraced the internationally recognised concept of sustainability in its planning frame-\nworks. We explore, empirically, the complex ways in which state authorities and urban\nelites have used postpolitical concepts imported from international organisations, such\nas the World Bank and the UN, as a part of a conflict management strategy that seeks\nto legitimise contentious and controversial policy agendas.We examine their deployment\nin Taipei in which there are particular tensions over the extent to which conflict is seen as\na marker of democratic maturity, on the one hand, and a threat to social and govern-\nmental order, on the other. In contrast to Eurocentric experiences, Taipei's case relates to\nits specific geopolitical and postcolonial context, in which the translation of `Western'\ndiscourses of governing sustainability have also been regarded as key milestones in its\ntransition to a cosmopolitan city. In so doing we contribute to the existing literature on\nurban sustainability, postpolitical governance, and comparative urbanism and conclude\nby exploring the relevance and utility of such approaches to urban politics.\nThe remainder of the paper is divided into two parts. In the first part we critically\nassess debates over postpolitics and urban sustainability as a postpolitical construct.\nWe develop a sympathetic critique of the work of writers such as Swyngedouw (2009)\nand Mouffe (2005) and argue that their arguments raise important empirical and\nconceptual questions over the ways in which the postpolitical condition plays out in\npractice and how it is constituted. In the second part we provide a contextual overview\nof sustainability politics in Taipei (and Taiwan) before discussing, in turn, the institu-\ntional structures of sustainability policy that exist, the specific form and character\nof policy agendas that have emerged, and the impacts of evolving discourses on policy\npractices. We interrogate the relationships between the geographies and spaces of\npostpolitics, postcolonial contexts, and global sustainability agendas.\nSustainability as a postpolitical construct\nThe rise of the postpolitical condition\nDuring the 2000s there was ostensibly a convergence in development planning agendas\nacross the world, underpinned by dominant, Eurocentric understandings of common\npolicy problems and solutions (Krueger and Gibbs, 2010). A key element of this\nconvergence was the move towards sustainability planning in urban and national\nspaces in which governments, city authorities, and policy communities have sought to\nimplement the core elements of the UN's Agenda 21 programme and establish their\nown sustainability programmes (see, for example, Moore and Bunce, 2009). The UN,\nthe World Bank, the EU, and others have promoted the concepts of `good governance'\nand sustainability in the Global South, often through international agreements\non climate change and environmental regulation (see Brand and Thomas, 2005;\nFor a group of `postpolitical' writers this globalisation of policy constructs reflects\nand reproduces progressive and unstoppable processes of change. Postpoliticism's\nconceptual origins lie in debates within political science on the changing form and\ncharacter of democratic politics under neoliberalism and the propagation of socially\nand economically `progressive' forms of Third Way governance in the UK, Western\nEurope, and North America. Its key advocates include Beck (2002) and Giddens (1994;\n2002) and their writings on what they term posttraditional, reflexive modernisation.\nThey argue that structural changes in the nature of socioeconomic systems are taking\nplace in which individuals and communities have transcended the class structures,\nnational identities, and adversarial politics of industrial modernity and embraced a\n`second modernity', characterised by a new `subpolitics' of self-identity, cosmopolitan-\nism, and consensus building. Politics, in short, has moved beyond the old class-infused\ncategories of Left and Right and is now experienced ``as constraints (and opportunities)\nemanating from a variety of sources. Class becomes individualised and expressed\nthrough an individual's biography; it is experienced less and less as a collective fate''\nThe implications for governance and state action of this postpolitical condition\n(cf Rancie\n\u00a9 re, 2006) are profound. As class consciousness has waned, it is argued,\nso political processes have become less adversarial and ideological in form. According\nto Beck (2000, page 80), existing modes and procedures of representative government,\nand even nation-states, therefore act like ``zombies\u00f6dead long ago but still haunting\npeople's minds.'' Politics becomes principally concerned with the formation of consen-\nsuses and the coproduction of policy between state actors and private and voluntary\nsector interests. Within such conceptions there is a wider acceptance of a singular\nglobal (neoliberal) order and a celebration of the move towards a new postnational\ncosmopolitanism founded on Kantian ethical principles (see also Appiah, 2006;\nHeld, 2005; Nussbaum, 1995). Adversarial modes of democracy have little purchase\nin a context where ideological battles are no longer fought between collective groups\nand interests. The emphasis, instead, should be on the pursuit of policy `effectiveness'\nthrough the mobilisation of `depoliticised' discourses, such as sustainability, around\nwhich all interests can agree and work towards a shared agenda. In countries such\nas the UK the Labour government of Tony Blair articulated this modernist politics of\nobjectivity and problem solving as a way of overcoming the perceived intransigence\nof social movements with vested interests that were unable to grasp the fundamental\nnature of contemporary global change (see Blair, 2010).\nFor elites in different urban and national contexts this narrative of a consensus-\nbased global order opens up new opportunities for the rolling out of globally oriented\nagendas and programmes and the (re)designing of political systems. If there is no\nalternative but to focus on nonadversarial politics, then democratic systems and policy\nagendas need to adapt to the new certainties and shake off their traditional and\nantiquated concerns with, for example, collective welfare provision or full employment.\nThis is particularly true where global bodies such as the UN and the World Bank\nactively encourage or force cities and countries to implement sustainability or austerity\nprogrammes in the name of a broader international agenda. It also often involves the\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 193\nreshaping of local development practices, techniques of management, and technologies\nof government with state agencies adopting quantitative, indicator-based policy\nframeworks to implement international programmes and to demonstrate to external\nand internal audiences just how effective policy interventions have been. Postpolitical\ngovernance also involves public ^ private partnerships in which the interests and\noutlooks of different interests in cities can be brought together to engage in rational\ndiscourse, through which objective, problem-focused policy agendas can be created\nand implemented.\nChallenging the consensus approach\nWhilst these postpolitical imaginaries have come to dominate the policy thinking of\nglobal organisations, they have also been the subject of growing academic criticism.\nFor Mouffe (2005) they represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the contested\nnature of politics and the political. The ideal of a consensus-based politics is an illusion\nas `there is no consensus without exclusion, no we without a they, and no politics\nis possible without the drawing of a frontier'' (page 73). By denying the existence\nof differences, borders, and frontiers, postpolitics undermines the possibilities for\ndisagreement and what Rancie\n\u00a9 re (2006) terms a `dissensus' to emerge\u00f6something\nthat is necessary for the formation of a legitimate and effective democratic political\nsystem. These new forms of postpoliticism seek to obfuscate the political conflicts that\nunderpin policy interventions by limiting the terrains of discourse to the realms of\nthe procedural and the technical (Mouffe, 2005; Swyngedouw, 2007). Moreover, post-\npolitical writing can also be seen as a Eurocentric perspective that imagines, and seeks\nto promote, a political order founded on Western values and modes of thinking about\ncommunity, individuality, citizenship, and governance. As Peck et al (2010) demon-\nstrate, international policy prescriptions are readily adopted by elites in different\ncountries and cities and are used as `off-the-shelf' solutions to generally defined policy\nproblems. This process of `cosmpolitanisation' is institutionalised by governing agencies\nwho promote the neoliberal mantras of minimal state regulation, the freeing up of\nmarkets, and the ideological belief that economic development underpins social,\nwelfare, and environmental policy (Harvey, 2009). This is the fate of discourses and\nagendas, such as those of sustainability, that seek to generate a global convergence in\ndevelopment thinking, whilst ostensibly furthering `progressive' and `inclusive' agendas.\nIndeed, in some places this form of policy convergence is seen by elites as a develop-\nment marker or a sign of progress that can be used to legitimate the rolling out of\nprogrammes that may be particularly controversial and highly selective in their choice\nThird Way discourses also underplay the disciplinary power inherent in `non-\nideological', output-focused programmes and plans. As Keil (2007) notes, global\n`encouragements' to adopt international agreements and standards often go hand in\nhand with punitive sanctions and/or threats of ostracisation if local actors fail to\ndemonstrably adapt to international demands. Such demands can take a variety of\nforms, including political changes, economic liberalisation, and cultural demands for\ngovernments and societies to adopt certain ethical positions, practices, or attitudes\ntowards the natural environment (see Z\n\u00ed iz\nher trenchant critique of postpolitical writings, one of the core disciplinary elements\nof the new agendas is that politics has become `moralised' into a simple battle of right\nversus wrong, or good versus evil, in which there are no grounds for compromise or\ndebate. Whilst a `good governance' model appears to be inclusive and commonsensical,\nit will always be grounded in selective and power-infused modes of thinking and acting\nin which\n``we are still faced with political friend/enemy discriminations but they are now\nexpressed using the vocabulary of morality ... when opponents are defined not in\npolitical but in moral terms, they cannot be envisaged as an adversary but only\nThe shift towards internationally defined modes of good governance can, therefore,\nas Appiah (1998, page 94) warns, readily become a `deadening urge to uniformity', with\nlocal translations and interpretations merely becoming, as Butler (1995) notes,\n``[an] imposition[s] of a universal claim on a culture that resists it, or that those who\ndefend the universal will domesticate the challenge posed by alterity by invoking\nthat very cultural claim as an example of its own nascent universality, one which\nconfirms that such a universality is already achieved'' (page 51).\nIn practical terms this often equates with a ``politicisation of sustainability that\n[has] shifted responsibility for sustainability from the global capitalist corporations\nto different cities, communities and individuals'' (Keil, 2007, pages 45 ^ 46; see also\nHowever, despite these more abstract criticisms of postpolitical constructs, there\nremain significant gaps in our understanding of their influence in situ and the broader\ngeographies of postpoliticism. There are few detailed explorations of exactly how post-\npolitical agendas are constructed in particular places (if at all) and the rationalities\nthat underpin them in different cities and countries. The critics of postpolitical writing\noften use generalities and conceptual discussions to frame their writing, but it remains\nunclear who the agents of this postpolitical condition actually are in different contexts\nand how and why political constructs such as `sustainability' take on specific forms.\nMoreover, even if policy agendas appear to take on postpolitical forms and rational-\nities, this does not necessarily mean that very real divergences and conflicts have been,\nor can easily be, eradicated. As Delanty (2006) argues, many constructs that seem to be\nwidely shared and/or global in nature actually take on locally specific characteristics\nso that ``the logic of translation has extended beyond the simple belief that everything\ncan be translated to the recognition that every culture can translate itself and others ...\nand something new is created'' (page 43). For Delanty policy transfer always becomes\nenmeshed in existing institutional frameworks and multiscale political projects. It may\nnot always be possible for elite groups to suppress or deny the existence of conflicts\nand difference. By seeking to do so they may, in fact, precipitate new conflicts or\nrekindle smouldering discontents (see Barnett, 2010).\nWe might, therefore, expect the form of democratic politics in postcolonial cities to\ndiffer significantly from those found in more established democratic systems. In many\ncases politics is dominated by elites, sustained by the legacies of earlier colonial\nstructures of governance (see Holliday, 2007). Urban politics in such contexts often\ncomes to reflect and reproduce broader geopolitical and nationalist tensions that arise\nover issues such as sovereignty, governance, and developmentalism. The institutional-\nisation of postpolitical agendas takes on specific geographical forms and meanings and\ncombines with existing processes in complex and grounded ways. In many instances\nthey are readily adopted by policy elites to provide a nucleus around which to manage\nconflicts and to establish `inclusive' agendas that, in practice, serve to marginalise\nmore radical and critical social movements and political agendas in the name of\nmodernisation, progress, and policy relevance.\nAnd it is in such contexts that sustainability has come to represent an archetypal\npostpolitical construct. The term expresses and embodies a seemingly nonconflictual,\ncommon sense set of aspirations and goals around which disparate interests can unite\nto form common programmes of action. It simultaneously opens up opportunities for\nscientists and experts to devise technocratic solutions to urban problems; provides a\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 195\npolitical platform for a broad range of social and environmental groups to find\ncommon purpose; enables businesses to publicly showcase their social responsibility\ncredentials; and allows governments and policy makers to establish new grounds for\nthe construction of partnerships and consensus-based forms of politics at multiple\nscales (Brand and Thomas, 2005; Whitehead, 2007). Sustainability's inherent cosmo-\npolitanism is bound up with its concern for the human species, the global risks\nassociated with environmental (and economic) crisis, and its promise of a sustained\nIn the remainder of the paper we now interrogate the evolution of sustainable\ndevelopment agendas in the East Asian city of Taipei, Taiwan. We draw on an ongoing\nresearch programme that has examined spatial policy and regeneration agendas in the\ncity and the recent emergence of an explicit `sustainability agenda' in its planning\nframeworks. The research has been conducted over a period of four years (from 2006\nto 2010) and has involved repeated interviews with city planners, policy makers, busi-\nness leaders, and civil society advocates. In total, twenty-six interviews were completed.\nTaipei was selected as it represents a particularly salient example of processes of\npolitical change and modernisation in action. It is a fast-growing, postcolonial city\nand has witnessed remarkable demographic, political, economic, and environmental\nlong been a key political battleground for different interests. Some have argued that a\nbetter quality of life for citizens will result from the imposition of new regulations and\ncontrols on the development interests and elites who have dominated the postwar\npolitics of development (Chou, 1999; Lee et al, 2005). Others call for a freeing up of\nthe planning system as a platform for enhanced competitiveness and growth. During the\n1990s and 2000s the discourse of sustainability has been shoehorned onto these existing\nconflicts in an attempt to postpoliticise them through the establishment of `mainstream',\nconsensus-based visions and agendas.\nUnder the global and local pressures: the rise of Taiwanese sustainable development\nThe recent emergence of a sustainability agenda in Taiwan has been forged through a\ncomplex mix of global and local political pressures. There is nothing new in this as\nTaiwan's history is dominated by colonial and postcolonial tensions, stretching back\nover 300 years with its successive incorporation into the Dutch Spanish, and Japanese\nempires. After the second world war the Kuomintang (KMT) ruled the island under an\n`authoritarian developmentalism' and a military preparedness, so that ``from the 1960s\non economic development, with which to make Taiwan a model of socio-economic\nprogress, became an over-riding goal that was to support, but not supplant, the long\nterm objective of retaking the mainland [China]'' (Cheng, 1989, page 481). Since the\nlate 1980s the island has experienced a rapid process of democratisation that, as Lin\n(1999, page 2) notes, has become a role model for others to follow ``among the world's\ntransitioning democracies''.\nIn the process of this democratisation, environmental sustainability and economic\ndevelopmentalism have become one of the most contentious and divisive issues facing\nthe new democracy. Opposition parties, NGOs, and social and environmental groups\nincreasingly argue that the KMT's postwar focus on modernising Taiwan through\neconomic development meant a long-term neglect of the environment, particularly in\nthe island's main metropolises of Taipei and Kaohsiung (Hsiao, 1999; Tang and Tang,\n1997). There has been the growth of an enhanced `environmental consciousness' and a\nmore focused awareness of the dangers of environmental overexploitation. This, more\nthan any other issue, has kindled local protests and resistance to state and/or big\nbusiness-led development plans and industrial projects (Hsiao, 1999). For the Taiwanese\nauthorities defusing these tensions and building a new set of more consensual agendas\nhave become key policy objectives.\nAt the same time the 1980s and 1990s also saw external international pressure being\napplied to Taiwan to adopt global benchmarks and standards in relation to environ-\nmental and economic sustainability. For example, since 1992 NGOs, including the UK's\nEnvironmental Investigative Association, have launched active campaigns through\nglobal media networks to criticise the Taiwanese government of facilitating the illegal\ntrade of endangered species and of breaking international protection agreements such\nas the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (EIA, 2005).\nCITES signatories have ``urged its members to impose available sanctions'' (Lin, 2009,\npage 24) in response, and the USA imposed a selective trade embargo on Taiwan under\nthe Pelly Amendment in 1994 (Charnovitz, 1994). This case has been used by central\ngovernment to caution the Taiwanese against standing up to international `norms' and\n`expectations' that could produce a international ``perception that the Taiwanese only\ncare about making money, not environment at all'' (RDEC, 2006, page 13). However,\nthe Taiwanese state's response to this negative publicity abroad and growing discontent\nat home has been to seek to change the attitudes of its population and to encourage the\nformation of more Western, globally oriented outlooks. As one interviewee explained,\nTaiwan cannot ignore growing international pressures if Taiwan's society and citizens\ncontinue to ``neglect its perceived disinterest in adopting international standards\nand priorities then this could harm Taiwan's international reputation and economic\ngrowth.''\nTaiwan's adoption of sustainability agendas since the early 1990s, such as the\ninstitutionalisation of the National Council of Sustainable Development (NCSD) and\nAgenda 21 Taiwan programme, could be regarded as a series of political responses to\nthe pressures exerted by international bodies (Lin, 2008; Liu et al, 2005). This process\nof institutional reform has been designed to enable Taiwanese governments to demon-\nstrate to an external audience that they are pushing through an international agenda,\nwhilst at the same time establishing the institutional capacities necessary to tackle\nenvironmental and development problems within the country. In the words of the\nthen Minister of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC),\nTaiwan's government should tackle its sense of powerlessness in the wake of interna-\ntional sustainability agendas, in which it has felt compelled to adopt international\nIt should, instead, participate with international organisations and conferences and\nestablish platforms to contest external discourses, otherwise, in the words of one\ninterviewee, policy makers may ``suffer beatings without opportunities to retort'' (see\nonly if it explicitly adopted a good governance approach and established bodies that\ncould drive such an agenda forward.\nAs we will demonstrate in the remainder of the paper, political elites in Taiwan\nhave used these global sustainability agendas to facilitate the introduction of a new\nwave of local government reforms, particularly through the delivery of Taiwan's Local\nAgenda 21 programme. The importation and translation of such agendas refers not\nonly to the formation and institutionalisation of a postpolitical consensus around\nsustainability but also to a postcolonial construction of global cosmopolitanism.\nIn the next section we begin by examining and assessing postpolitical sustainability\nand planning practices in Taiwan's largest and most significant city, Taipei, and the\nways in which the concept of sustainability has been translated and institutionalised.\n(1) Yeh is a leading scholar of promoting the sustainability agenda in Taiwan and was the Minister\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 197\nThe postpolitics of sustainability planning in Taipei\nTaipei has long been regarded as the economic, political, and cultural capital of\nTaiwan. Its development, prosperity, and international reputation are critical to the\ncountry's domestic development and international competitiveness (Kwok and Hsu,\n2005; Raco et al, 2011). Its primacy has made it a centre for protest in which citizens\ndemonstrate against central government and leading politicians (Lii and Lin, 2003;\nprotests took place in the Taipei metropolitan area between 1980 and 1996'', or more\nthan one fifth of all environmental protests of Taiwan during this period. Compared\nwith other industrial cities, Taipei has benefited from the absence of extensive indus-\ntrial pollution, but rapid growth has created severe supply-side shortages and pressures\nin relation to overcrowding and most significantly housing affordability. Between 1986\nThis was a long-running source of discontent, and little was done by elected govern-\nments to tackle it. And by 2010 the director of central government's Construction\nand Planning Agency admitted publicly that Taipei's average house prices have now\nincreased to fourteen times the average income of residents, double the Taiwan aver-\nage.(2) Moreover, the city's population density is 7.5 times that of Taiwan's average, and\nthe amount of public green space per capita is less than 40%.(3) These sustainability\nissues result from development-led and `world city' policies that seek to transform the\ncity into a ``real estate profit machine'' (Hsiao and Liu, 2002, page 71). It is in this\ncontext that a new postpolitics of sustainability planning has emerged to tackle the\nperceived tension between developmentalism, on the one hand, and environmental\nprotection, on the other. This has involved two elements: institutional reform of the\ncity's policy-making processes; and the mobilisation of specific forms of expert-led,\nindicator-based modes of governance. Each of these will now be assessed in turn.\nInstitutional reform and the mobilisation of a sustainability agenda\nThe launch of a sustainability agenda in Taipei has involved a deliberate attempt to\ncreate `new' institutional assemblages that differ from the old politically charged and\ndevelopment-focused local government structures of the postwar period. The emphasis\nhas ostensibly been on the development of more inclusive, reflexive, and deliberative\nforms of governance and decision making in a context of growing uncertainty, unpre-\ndictability, and ambivalence, or what Beck and Sznaider (2006) term `reflexive\nmodernity' (see also Vob and Kemp, 2006). This is exemplified by the most significant\ninitiative, the foundation of the Taipei Sustainable Development Committee (TSDC) in\n2004, which was designed to oversee policy-making processes in a cross-departmental,\ncross-sectoral, and postpolitical way. The TSDC promotes a sustainability agenda\nfounded on\n``local self-governance, strengthening the interaction between local government and the\npublic, and encouraging the public to participate in environmental protection and\nsocial activities and to play an active role in promoting sustainable development''\nIt is ostensibly designed to be an inclusive body that acts as a hybrid between\nparticipative and representative systems of governance. It is chaired by the Mayor,\nand its board includes leaders from different Taipei City Government (TCG) depart-\nments, local professionals and scholars, representatives from business and social groups,\nand environmental NGOs (see TCG, 2004a, pages 2 ^ 4). There are seven `working\n(3) According to Taiwan's National Statistics (2010) at http://eng.stat.gov.tw/mp.asp?mp=5\nteams' tasked to develop programmes around: sustainable development visions; water\nand land resources; industries and biodiversity; sustainable transportation; sustainable\nsociety; sustainable education; and international environmental protection. Each depart-\nment of the TCG is required to join several of these teams to work together on\ncoordinated tasks and policy agendas, rather than focusing only on their own admin-\nistrative responsibilities. Such interdepartmental working is designed to promote new\nforms of consensus building by breaking down `silo mentalities' and the scope and scale\nof institutionalised policy conflicts.\nIts core aim has been to produce strategies that seek to realise `sustainable devel-\nopment' through local action and visions of Taipei as an `eco-city' (TCG, 2004a).\nDespite this stated aim, it continues to reflect and reproduce international agendas\nand discourses taken directly from the UN and/or other more `progressive' and `devel-\noped' countries. For example, the TCG (2004b, page 6) highlights the UN's agenda as\na starting point for policy, and it ``has been regarded as an action principle to practice\nsustainable development from global, regional and national scales.'' Through conveying\nthe commonly adopted concept of sustainable development\u00f6such as the balanced three\npillars between environment, economy, and society\u00f6the TCG aims to promote what\nBeck and Sznaider (2006, page 11) term ``a cosmopolitan outlook in which people view\nthemselves simultaneously as part of a threatened world and as part of their local\nsituations and histories'' (see also Davidson, 2009).\nAlongside the UN charters it is the UK planning system and its sustainable com-\nmunity agendas that are seen as role models for Taiwanese policy makers and planners.\nLondon, in particular, is presented by the TSDC and its advisors as a comparative,\nEgan Review: Skills for Sustainable Communities (DCLG, 2004) and The Greater\nLondon Authority's A Sustainable Development Framework for London (LSDC, 2002)\nwere singled out as templates for the formation of Taipei's core sustainability goals and\nstrategies on the grounds that, like London and the UK,\n``Taiwan is an island country, and Taipei is its capital ... . In order to connect\n[TCG's] declarations and promises [of pursuing sustainable development] with the\ninternational context, developing such declarations would be more appropriate to\nrefer to the similar type of countries' capitals ... . Thus, A Sustainable Development\nFramework for London ... is regarded as the main reference for Taipei'' (TCG, 2004b,\nObjectives'' as templates for its Sustainable Development Framework and its so-called\n``Four Promises'' of ``determination and innovation, action and capability, responsibility\nand oversight, respect and success.'' In direct echoes of the London plans, the overall\nobjective for planning policy is now to\n``build a global standard capital city with a combination of three targets: cyclic\nsymbiosis of environment and resources/progress sharing in secure society/intelligent\ngrowth of economy and technologies'' (TCG, 2004a, page 2).\nThese objectives underpin Taipei's stated ambition to become a global city that is\nable to balance economic competitiveness with environmental and social cohesion.\nIt uses the consensual language of sustainability to critique postwar development\nplanning and gives credence to a broader postpolitical `modernisation' agenda for\ngovernment and governance systems. Thus, the principal purpose and objective of\npolicy is to demonstrate that Taipei is becoming a `proper', `developed' international\ncity, able to play its full part in the rolling out of a sustainability agenda even though,\nas one planning official admitted in interview, ``no one really knows how we can prac-\ntise this [sustainability] concept.'' International discourses have played an important\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 199\npolitical role in helping to legitimise a change of emphasis in development policy and\nwhat could have been controversial governance reforms, and it is to the form and content\nof these agendas that we now turn.\nReframing accountability and the mobilisation of indicator-led governance\nOne core feature of postpolitical governance and consensus building is the shift\ntowards output-centred government, focused on expert-led `pragmatism' and a `what\nmatters is what works' approach to policy. Reform is often carried out through the\ndeployment of `objective' and internationally comparable indicators that mimic those of\nmore developed cities. As Swyngedouw (2007; 2009) points out, the effects of this are\nthat politics proper is progressively replaced by expert social administration, so that\nantagonistic political debates are replaced by an instrumental rationality and manage-\nrialism based on `technocratic ^ scientific' knowledge. In Taiwan such indicator-based\nforms of policy construction have represented a `technology of government' that seeks\nto remove sources of political conflict within civil society and to demonstrate internally\nand externally just how `cosmopolitan' and `international' the city's dominant con-\nceptions of sustainability are. In Rose's (2006, page 147) terms the mobilisation of\nindicators in this way represents ``a kind of intellectual machinery or apparatus for\nrendering reality thinkable in such a way that it is amenable.''\nResponsibility for indicator development has been given to local civil servants,\nsustainable development committees, and local government appointees, including aca-\ndemics and third-sector representatives (CEPD, 2004). For central government and the\nTCG the development of these indicators has been regarded as the crucial method\nof controlling broader political conflicts over development policy. And yet this appeal\nto objectivity and transparency masks a contested politics. Some indicators, such as\nthe UN's `Urban Indicators Programme' and `Human Development Index' (see TCG,\n2004c), have been shoehorned onto existing government datasets, such as those\nproduced by the National Council for Economic and Development and the TCG\nA complex and rather muddled mix of indicator systems has emerged that fulfils\npostpolitical objectives by converting controversial decisions and political demands\ninto technical and methodological questions. Rather than opening up formal political\ndiscussion within the population over development objectives, policy has been reduced\nto a bureaucratic debate framed by discussions between experts and policy makers.\nIn practice, this has given policy makers the opportunity to reframe the city's\ndevelopment objectives in quite radical ways, whilst limiting sources of controversy\nand dissensus. For example, at one of its founding workshops (17 March 2004) the\nTSDC's Action Team concluded that in order to develop enhanced `global connections'\na key objective for policy should be to collect international indicators and replicate\nthem in Taipei. These included the World Bank's `World Development Indicators';\nsustainability indicators from the UK, USA, and Canada; and the OECD (TCG,\n2004c). The initial stages of this process involved a rather crude clumping together of\nexisting indicator sets into five core lists comprising a `grand list' of 118 indicators\nincluding all of those found on international lists references. This initial list was later\npared down to forty eight in the name of management efficiency as civil servants were\nhaving significant difficulties in collecting and analysing relevant data (TGC workshop,\nThe (postpolitical) processes through which this `streamlining' took place reveal\nmuch about the character of the city's politics. The TCG (2004c, page 1) argued that\nthey were to be decided by participants from different sectors and organisations, with\ncivil servants and experts acting only as ``guides or early warnings in the process of\nmaking policies and decisions of sustainable development.'' A city-wide survey,\nworkshops, and discussion forums were held, ostensibly to shape the process.\nHowever, as our interviewees revealed, in reality most of the indicators were pre-\nselected and defined by TCG departments. Two main questions from the survey were\nthought relevant by experts: (a) whether indicators could play a role in establishing\n``the long or medium term action plans of departments''; and (b) ``whether these target-\nled indicators should be suggested by members for the TCG to be monitored'' (TCG,\n2004a, page 27). Rather than breaking open the decision-making process, the use of\nindicators generated new forms of bureaucratic ^ expert empowerment. Under the cover\nof objective and `rational' policymaking more challenging and complex socioeconomic\nand environmental concerns have been marginalised from core debates.\nMoreover, all forty-eight key indicators are based on quantitative and technocratic ^\nscientific representations of socioenvironmental and economic sustainability. It is\nperhaps not surprising that following these discussions most indicators focus on\nquantifiable environmental and economic aspects of development, such as the quantity\nof urban green spaces found in Taipei and the effectiveness of refuse recycling pro-\ngrammes, but refer less to social indicators or inequalities of income and opportunity.\nAs one local scholar involved in the process explained in interview,\n``departments are concerned more about face-saving issues and their reputations.\nThus, they are very selective in picking up indicators ... they don't want to choose\ncertain indicators that will expose serious problems that could make whole citizens\ncome to blame their department.''\nThe focus on departmental-led work and more `efficient' processes of governance\nhas been used to limit debates and facilitate consensus building. It also means that\nmore contentious demands have been taken out of the political sphere and converted\ninto `objective' and `neutral' targets to be monitored. As an interviewee from the TCG\nwho helped to formulate these indicators explained, ``qualitative indicators, no matter\nwhether they come from the UN or other western countries, are more likely to be\nquestionable and disputed ... they were not seen as objective enough to measure\nsustainability.'' In other words, only quantitative data and measures were accepted as\nbeing relevant to sustainability policy because they fitted in with governmental practices.\nThe consequence of this exclusion is that other forms of knowledge, experience, and\nways of thinking become structurally excluded from policy frameworks.\nThe TCG (2004c, page 51) states there are still twelve indicators of measuring\nso-called ``progress-sharing in secure society''. Nonetheless, these indicators refer directly\nto social security and population characteristics\u00f6such as crime rates, literacy rate of\nadults, and the number of citizens who participate in cultural activities\u00f6rather than\nmapping social inequality and deprivation. In interview a senior planning official\ncandidly illustrated ``if you ask us what is sustainability and a sustainable community,\nwe can give you a `correct' answer\u00f6it is the joining-up of environmental, industrial and\nsocial concerns. But there is a big gap between knowing and doing.'' Another planning\nofficer reflected in interview: ``we still do not want to understand or face up to pressing\nsocial issues that are too complicated and/or tough to deal with.'' For instance, whilst\ncertain indicators, taken mainly from the UN's `Global Urban Indicators' (GUIs),(4)\ndo refer to the measurement of social equity and the equal access to housing credit, the\ncomparison between household incomes and the price of housing and land are all\nexcluded from the TCG's (2004a; 2004b) key indicators. They are regarded merely as\ndescriptive indicators that do not relate to the TCG's (2004a) key sustainability targets.\nAs an official of Taipei's Urban Redevelopment Office noted in interview:\n(4) For the UN's GUIs see their Human Settlements Programme website at http://ww2.unhabitat.org/\nprogrammes/guo/guo_guide.asp#ind2\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 201\n``urban renewal and regeneration should be a public issue, but we do not really think\nabout the public. I used to have a joke with the staff of our office that we are there\nto assist developers to tackle their problems and make their projects.''\nSuch views exemplify the ways in which these policy discussions and targets setting\nseem to circumscribe Taipei's more contentious planning issues or to establish lowest\ncommon denominator themes that will not raise controversy. Policy has been based on\n`idealist' notions of urban competitiveness and sustainability representing ``compatible\nstrategic political and policy goals'' (Jonas and While, 2007, page 124). This process\nhas become even more pronounced in recent years, and we turn to a discussion of its\nevolution and impacts in the following section.\nThe evolution of sustainability politics in Taipei\nSince the late 2000s city and national governments have given greater priority to the\nobjective of reframing Taipei and Taiwan's position as central players within interna-\ntional networks and environmental and developmental policy debates. This partly\nreflects deep-seated anxieties amongst policy makers that Taiwan will continue to be\nseen as an industrial economic `tiger', seemingly unconcerned with environmental\nprotection. Moreover, its delisting as an official, sovereign state by the UN in 1971\nalso threatened its international standing. As the RDEC (2006, page 13) openly states,\n``after losing our position in the United Nations, no one informs us about the inter-\nnational covenants and regulations beginning worldwide. We have had a very poor\nunderstanding of them.'' The adoption of sustainability norms, particularly in relation\nto Taiwan's flagship capital city, is a critical element in this debate as it demonstrates to\nexternal audiences and its citizens Taiwan's ability and desire to act as an independent\nand cosmopolitan state and is evidence of its growing global status.\nInternational conferences and forums have provided one avenue through which\npolicy makers have sought to overcome this perceived international marginalisation,\nand create an image of being globalising. For example, in 2005 the Mayor of the TCG\nattended the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) World Environment\nDay in San Francisco and, joined with another fifty-three cities to pledge their support\nand sign the UNEP's `Urban Environmental Accords'. Since then, pursuing the\ninternational agenda, certification, and criteria of developing a `green city', healthy\ncommunity, and the eco-city have become priorities for the TSDC and the TCG\n(see DEP, 2008; UNEP, 2005). These new criteria have been readily, and uncritically,\nimposed directly by the TSDC onto Taipei's sustainability strategies, with little negotia-\ntion. Moreover, since 2008 new priorities have also emerged to make Taiwan a `Healthy\nCity' and to attain international recognition from the World Health Organization.\nTwelve `Community Districts' have rapidly been identified and targeted for action\nacross the city to support this agenda (DEP, 2008).\nHowever, the effects and impacts of these complex indicators or systems on develop-\nment practices have actually been quite limited, highlighting the limits of consensus-based\n`pragmatic', postpolitical programmes of action to affect significant change. Instead, as\na local scholar who has participated in this development observed in interview, many\nindicators ``seem to be put on the shelf for reference only'' rather than being employed to\ndevelop a long-term strategy. There is little evidence of policy evaluation, even in the terms\nset out by the TSDC. In interview a TCG senior planning official recalled that\n``[the TSG] is under a delusion that expects that the city will be made sustainable\nthrough the development and operation of an indicator system, but they didn't\nreally consider ... how these indicators can be really exercised, how the administra-\ntion of sustainability can really be sustained, how can government really activate\ncitizens to participate.''\nOn the surface, while the TCG is keen to pursue `cosmopolitan' sustainability\nagendas, it is highly questionable whether such agendas can make Taipei moderate\nthe city's environmental and social conflicts. Data from the TCG's Department of\nBudget, Accounting and Statistics (DBAS, 2011) show that the number of disputes\nLand prices have increased by 40%, unemployment has risen from 3.5% up to 5.6%,\nand living costs have increased by approximately 10%. Moreover, in the name of\nsustainable `development', the TCG is also pushing to redevelop the city's limited green\nspaces, around areas such as the Quan-Du conservation area and Nan-Gang district,\nas so-called ecocommunities\u00f6industrial parks of biotechnology or ecotourism (see\nas a local researcher commented in interview, ``are for property development and specu-\nlation.'' Since 2009 these redevelopment projects have resulted in new arguments or\nconflicts between residents, environmental protectors, developers, and city government.\nFor example, in terms of the government's project of redeveloping the green space\nin Nan-Gang district, a well-known local commentator Xiao-Feng Zhang (2010) has\nprotested that the development is similar to ``cutting the lungs of Taipei''.(5) These\nconflicts or protests usually cause temporary public attention and are often eclipsed\nby the government's dominant practices of postpolitical representations of sustainable\ndevelopment as a technical practice.\nSuch practices attempt to squeeze out dissensus and conflicts by giving little\nrecognition to the growing divisions between different groups around Taipei. There is\na focus on the environment as a collective, binding object of government around which\nnew forms of consensus can be established and exercised. For community activists\nand those involved in grassroots political organisation, this (post)political environ-\nment is the cause of much frustration and pressure. As one commented on the TCG's\nsustainable programmes in interview:\n``[officials] usually do not consider and evaluate whether their programmes can\nachieve the purposes of sustainability ... . For us, sitting here to look up at [them],\nwe only can take a government's project, and just do it, but we don't really know\nwhat are the outcomes and influences.''\nAs the activist went on to argue, international terms and concepts such as eco-\ncommunities have generated much confusion, and ``local residents have not been able\nto digest such concepts or make sense of them.'' Nonetheless, local residents seem to be\nin a dilemma between following such concepts uncritically or being sanctioned by\ndisqualification from government funding. Since 2008 the TCG's main funding for\nlocal communities to propose and improve their own neighbourhoods has been trans-\nferred to support state-led projects on the defined themes of green or sustainable\ndevelopment, such as the Taipei International Flora Exposition and the building of a\nso-called ecocommunity. In order to strive for the funding, local communities are\nunder pressure to learn from the government's preregulated agendas and demonstrate\ntheir capability to deliver or match up such agendas.\nMoreover, the desire to demonstrate policy effectiveness to international bodies\nand citizens has led to new forms of spatial selectivity on the part of the TCG and to\nsome extent Taiwan's central government. For instance, there has been a new push\ntowards the creation of `exemplar' communities that have `succeeded' in national and\ninternational terms. By 2007 this had become a more explicit policy in which\nthe mayor asked the TCG's departments to establish ``safe communities and eco-\ncommunities'' and ``be active to find out some possible models, through direct support\n(5) Zhang has published a letter to the current President on Taiwan's United Daily News (Zhang,\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 203\nand a certification system to transform them into Taipei's development models''\nnoted in interview, the selected model communities are in the ``better areas, in which\nmore active citizens live'', and in which there is often a track record of `successful' local\nprojects. While these model projects have been employed by the TCG to show an image\nof `sustainable Taipei' (for example, DEP, 2008), neighbourhoods with more substantial\nand significant socioeconomic and environmental problems have found themselves\n`increasingly marginalised'. Their existence seems to be a cause of some embarrassment\nto policy makers intent on demonstrating just how developed and westernised Taiwan\nhas become.\nThe above practices represent the management of conflicts between concepts of\nsustainability and development, in which the TCG seeks to exert the disciplinary power\nand preregulated consensus of postpolitical sustainability through leading schemes and\nfunding and to create a cosmopolitan outlook or illusion of being sustainable to\nsupport Taipei's further entrepreneurial (re)development. The election of a new mayor\nin 2007, and growing global economic instability, has shifted policy thinking and\npriorities. At his first meeting of the TSDC (23 March 2007) he claimed to make\nsustainable development his ``top priority'', but, as a regeneration official pointed out\nin interview, the core meaning of this agenda has changed:\n``I don't think the issue of environmental sustainability is the current Mayor's\npriority ... . Even they can find some subjects to discuss these will still be put\nbehind the issues of urban competitiveness ... they pick up some easier one to do,\nsuch as reducing the carbon and power consumption.''\nThis masking of economic development agendas under the cloak of sustainability is\nperhaps best reflected in recent flagship projects, such as the construction of a new\nScience Technology Park and an International Conference Centre. Both were built with\ngovernment funds and also involved significant tax breaks and subsidies to foreign\ninvestors and their `creative workers'.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 ^ 09 has only deepened some of these tensions. Whilst\nthere exists the possibility that the recession will highlight how ``alternative ways of\nshaping our cities become possible'' (Evans et al, 2009, page 694), in the context of Taipei\nthe opposite seems to be emerging with agendas taking on a more collective, postpolitical,\nconsensual form focused on the need to generate new forms of economic growth.\nAs a chief planner explained in interview: ``I think Taipei still has great anxiety about\ncompeting with other Asian cities ... to attract international investors, investments and\nfactories ... to make international or big companies willing to settle here.'' Or in the\nwords of the city's mayor at his inaugural speech following his reelection in December\n2010, ``I will ... improve Taipei's urban competitiveness with all my strength to compete\nwith Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai'' (see TCG, 2011). The political controversies involved\nin this process of providing for investors have, in part, been mollified by the imple-\nmentation of postpolitical structures and processes. `Sustainability planning' is\nincreasingly used to complement economic development strategies by producing more\nattractive environments for developers' property-led development, influential companies,\nand `new urbanism' of their employees or the upper middle class.\nConclusions\nIn this paper we have used the example of the politics of sustainable development\nplanning in Taipei to shed light on broader debates over the relationships between\npostpolitics, sustainability, and the internationalisation of development discourses.\nIn Taipei there have been clear efforts to turn sustainability policy into a postpolitical\nconstruct that deflects attention away from some of the growing tensions now emerging\nover rising inequalities, unequal and patchy access to housing and welfare services, and\nthe impact of dilapidated and polluted urban environments on the day-to-day lives of\ncitizens and communities. The city government's growing emphasis on internationalisa-\ntion and global city status is likely to accentuate and magnify some of the inequalities\nthat currently exist, and for policymakers the rolling out of an ostensibly consensual\nand inclusive policy of sustainability can, it is hoped, pave the way for the implemen-\ntation of potentially unpopular reforms and policy measures that look to provide\nsubstantial financial support to elite groups. Whilst there is nothing new in these\npolitical controversies surrounding sustainability planning, their incorporation into\na postpolitical agenda represents a deliberate attempt to change the focus of policy\ndebates and shift them towards collective, problem-solving approaches that minimise\nconflict and promote partnership working.\nThis example provides empirical evidence of the forms that postpolitical processes\ntake in diverse, non-western contexts. Taipei's specific take on sustainability planning\ncan be understood only in relation to its postwar development, the changing politics of\ndemocracy in the country, its specific geopolitical position, and the form and character\nof its civil and postcolonial society. The rolling-out of a postpolitical agenda is part of\nan elitist programme of government that aims to integrate Taipei much more closely\ninto international networks so that the city can gain further international recognition.\nThis, in turn, is a policy supported by national governments that are keen to use\nTaipei's international position as a springboard for broader economic and political\nprojects. There is the added complexity of Taiwan's international status. Debates\nover reunification with mainland China continue apace, and attempts to obtain\nbroader recognition of Taipei and Taiwan's global credentials have to be seen in this\npostcolonial light.\nPolicy makers now face a series of dilemmas. The presence of an active and vibrant\ncivil society is a symbol of a `mature' democracy that has moved away from earlier\nperiods of dictatorship and colonial oppression. However, the expansion of such\nconflict invites a loss of control and opens up spaces for vehement opposition to state\nprojects, particularly in relation to economic development and its environmental\nimpacts. It is in this context that postpolitical, Third Way discourses become so\nappealing. By converting governance into a more technical, consensual, `Western-like'\nexercise of project management and delivery, democracy becomes relegated to a\nprocess of conferring support to projects and programmes that could meet a wider\nnational interest and development-led ideology and leading politicians' visions.\nHowever, we have also drawn attention to the limits of postpolitical agendas.\nWe indicate that, despite the mobilisation of postpolitical arrangements, conflict and\ndissensus have not been eradicated, but replaced. They are increasingly finding expres-\nsion in protest movements and nonconformist modes of political intervention as social\ngroups seek alternative ways of articulating their agendas. In some instances the denial\nof social and environmental conflict is even generating new antagonisms as some of the\nsocial, economic, and environmental costs of global city visions become increasingly\napparent. For authors such as Rancie\n\u00a9 re this reassertion of the political condition is\na direct consequence of postpolitical attempts to repress it. A clear area for further\nresearch is, therefore, an assessment of not only how postpolitical discourses are\nconstructed but also the extent to which they matter for the day-to-day politics and\ndevelopment of cities.\nUrban sustainability, conflict management, and the geographies of postpoliticism 205\n"
