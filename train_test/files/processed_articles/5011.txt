For example: both V4, involved with processing color,\nand GA, or ``grapheme area,'' are in the fusiform gyrus and are connected more densely\n(axonally) in synesthetes (Rouw et al., 2007, 2011). The genes that produce such enhanced\ncross-activation between modules may also promote increased activation (Hubbard, Brang,\n& Ramachandran, 2011) or proliferation of pathways known to connect higher cortical visual\nareas to ones earlier in the hierarchy of visual processing (``back-projections''). These\npathways have long been implicated in visual imagery--which involves sending visual\ninformation back from higher centers to Area 17 (Fellman & Van Essen, 1991; Klein\net al., 2004) and which may explain why some synesthetes seem to have enhanced visual\nTo explore these ideas further, we used the McCollough color aftereffect, or ME\n(McCollough, 1965), as a novel probe.

Vertical gratings are tinged with red and horizontal\ngratings with green. It is thought that prolonged exposure to green vertical stripes fatigues\nneurons sensitive to green vertical contours (Johnson, Hawken, & Shapley, 2008;\nMcCollough, 1965), whereas viewing red horizontal stripes does the converse. Therefore,\nsubsequent viewing of white vertical stripes causes a disproportionate activation of\nunadapted vertical-red neurons, causing you to see red (just as lukewarm water feels ice-\ncold if you have previously immersed your hand in hot water).\nSince ME color is only seen when stripes are present and because there are no orientation\nselective cells in the retina--only in cortex--one could conclude that ME probably involves\nthe selective adaptation of double-duty neurons in the cortex (Johnson et al., 2008;\nMcCollough, 1965) sensitive to color and form.\nDuring the last two decades, 30 or so topographically organized maps of visual space have\nbeen discovered in the primate brain, along with the numerous interconnections between\nthem. Each map appears to be specialized for a specific attribute (e.g., color, motion, or\ndepth). Although the areas are organized in a quasi-hierarchical manner, there are twice as\nmany back-projection from any given area to areas earlier in the hierarchy (Felleman & Van\nrole in overall gain control, there have been few viable hypotheses of how these back-\nprojections do their jobs (or, indeed, what their job is), although some steps forward have\nbeen taken in support of predictive coding models (Muckli et al., 2015).\nBecause ME and grapheme-color synesthesia both involve interactions between color and\nform (orientation), we wondered whether, in synesthetes, the vividness and persistence of the\nME might be amplified due to the preexisting genetic propensity to link color and form in\nthese individuals.\nSeven individuals, who experienced synesthesia and displayed test\u00adretest consistency, were\nchosen for the experiment (as were 13 nonsynethetes, recruited from an undergraduate pool).\nThey were shown adaptation stimuli subtending 43, consisting horizontal green [rgb(0, 255,\nsquare wave gratings (Figure 1), with a spatial frequency of .63 cycles per degree. The two\nframes alternated every 10 seconds for 3 minutes total.\nAfter adaptation, subjects were shown a test display (Figure 2(a)), in which the top square\ndoes not produce an aftereffect on its own, because the subjects did not previously adapt to\nFigure 1.

They used arrow keys to introduce color to the top square until it\nmatched the strength of the ME below it (Figure 2(b)). They were tested every 5 minutes\nfor 30 minutes. Effect percentages within subjects are calculated in relation to their first trial\n(their first match marks the initial strength of the effect--as in, 100% ME).\nDecay curves were recorded by plotting 100 \u00c2 Met\nagainst t and compared with the\nnormal decay curve given by Met\nsynesthete group (n \u00bc 7) showed a striking (on average threefold) increase in persistence of\nthe effect, when compared with nonsynesthete controls (n \u00bc 13, all having normal to corrected\nvision). Comparisons between the slopes of decay (d) for the groups showed a highly\nFigure 2. (a) Example of test pattern used to measure the McCollough effect.

Groups'\nmean decay and 95% confidence intervals are represented linearly, individual's illusion strength at each test\nperiod are plotted with points.\nRamachandran and Marcus 3\nFor comparison, instead of ME, we used ordinary color aftereffects--which result from\nbleaching of cone pigments rather than adaptation of cortical neurons. We had 4 synesthetes\nand 13 nonsynesthete controls view a green heart, subtending 20, for 90 seconds, and\nsubsequently look at an outline of the heart on a homogenous blank screen. This\nprocedure allowed us to measure the initial strength and duration of the effect using the\nsame method of adjustment as before. There was an average of 29.5 seconds for the\nafterimage to decay fully in synesthetes and averaging 33 seconds with control subjects\n(Figure 4). Comparisons between the groups' afterimage durations (d) showed no\nfor the same brief duration in both groups suggests that the increased persistence is specific\nto ME.\nTaken collectively, these observations are broadly consistent with the cross-activation\ntheory of synesthesia. It is possible that the ME, which involves utilizing connectivity\nbetween form and color, can take advantage of the preexisting enhancement of such\nconnections characterizing synesthetes. The net result is a more persistent ME. In both\ncases, the linking of color and form might be mediated either by lateral connections or by\nenhanced activity of back-projections. Such enhanced activity could set the stage for an echo-\nlike reverberation of signals between areas--which is consistent with the known higher\nincidence of eidetic imagery in synesthesia (Brang & Ramachandran, 2010). These\nspeculative conjectures can be tested using brain imaging (Brang, Hubbard, Coulson,\nHuang, & Ramachandran, 2010), which tend to have a hypnotic effect on scanners of the\nscientific literature.\nFigure 4. Synesthete and nonsynesthete afterimage durations (in seconds), with error bars.\n4 i-Perception\nAnomalous vision--whether studied in people with visual disturbances like\nsynesthesia or in nonsynesthetes viewing visual illusions--can provide a valuable probe for\nexploring the cascade of activity in visual areas that culminates in our perception of the\nworld.\n"
