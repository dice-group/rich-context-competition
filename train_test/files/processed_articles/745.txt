Hopp, PhD1\nThe growth of sophisticated life-sustaining medi-\ncal technology, combined with greater attention to\nmedical care at the end of life, has resulted in in-\ncreasing attention to issues related to advance care\nplanning (Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs,\nAmerican Medical Association, 1992). These issues\nare particularly relevant for the growing number of\nolder adults in the United States and their family\nmembers, who face increasingly complex choices re-\nlated to initiating, withholding, and terminating med-\nical treatments (Diamond, Jernigan, Moseley, Mes-\nGrowing attention has been paid in recent years to\nadvance directives, documents that allow persons to\ndesignate their preferences for medical care in the\nevent that they are unable to communicate these\nwishes at some time in the future. Advance directives\nhave been developed as a mechanism for enhancing\nthe rights of individual patients, clarifying patient\npreferences for medical care, and protecting both pa-\ntients and surrogate decision makers from legal liabil-\nity for health care decisions at the end of life (Cole &\nHolstein, 1995). One type of advance directive, the\nliving will, allows persons to specify in writing their\npreferences for medical care. The other type of ad-\nvance directive, the durable power of attorney for\nhealth care (DPAHC), is a legal document that allows\npersons to designate a person to make medical deci-\nsions for them if they are unable to do so. The Patient\nSelf-Determination Act, which took effect in 1991,\nrequires hospitals, nursing homes, and home care\nagencies to inform patients of their right to accept or\nrefuse medical care and to complete an advance di-\nrective, to document the existence of advance direc-\ntives, and to implement policies and procedures on\nadvance directives for patients and staff (LaPuma,\nOrentlicher, & Moss, 1991). However, despite such\nefforts, few older persons have actually completed\nadvance directives, and the proportion of adults com-\npleting them ranges from 4%\u00ad20% across various\nAlthough few persons complete advance direc-\ntives, greater numbers of persons engage in informal\ndiscussions with family members concerning health\ncare preferences (Elpern, Yellen, & Burton, 1993). In\nfact, one reason that people give for not completing\nan advance directive is that they feel that they can\nrely on others, particularly family members, to make\nhealth care decisions for them if they are unable to\ndo so (High, 1994). Family members, because of\ntheir long-standing relationships and knowledge of\nthe older person's values and preferences, are often\nThe author thanks Sonia Duffy, Sheila Feld, and Theresa Norgard for\nhelpful comments on earlier drafts of this article.\n1Address correspondence to Faith P.

Older persons, faced with the pros-\npect of complex medical decisions, usually expect\nthat family members will make medical decisions for\nthem if they are unable to do so (High, 1994). More-\nover, health care providers often consult with the\nfamilies of older persons in such situations (High &\nRowles, 1995), a practice that affirms the importance\nplaced on the role of family members as surrogate\ndecision makers by legal experts and by society as a\nAlthough a number of studies have examined the\nfactors that predict the likelihood of advance direc-\ntive completion (Eleazer et al., 1996; Elpern et al.,\n1992), no existing studies have examined the factors\nthat predict informal discussions on matters concern-\ning health care preferences. In order to better identify\nthose older persons most in need for intervention and\ncounseling on issues related to advance care plan-\nning, more information is needed on how and under\nwhat circumstances older persons communicate health\ncare preferences to those who are close to them (High,\n1994). There is also little information available con-\ncerning the preferences of older adults for specific\ntypes of family members as informal surrogate decision\nmakers or as a formally appointed DPAHC. Most states\nhave policies that give a high priority to family members\nas substitute health care decision makers, but little in-\nformation is available concerning the extent to which\nthese priorities fit with the actual preferences of older\npersons for family decision makers (High, 1987).\nMost existing studies examining issues related to\nadvance care planning have included study participants\nin inpatient or outpatient hospital settings, and the find-\nings may not be generalizable to the United States\npopulation as a whole. There is a particular need for\ninformation on advanced care planning among com-\nmunity-based, nonclinical samples of older adults\n(Marshall & Levy, 1990). Information from a repre-\nsentative sample of older adults in the United States\nis needed in order to identify the preferences of older\npersons for surrogate decision makers and the factors\nrelated to both formally executed advance directives\nand informal discussions concerning medical prefer-\nences in the event of decisional incapacity.\nThis study examines the preferences of a sample of\ncommunity-dwelling older persons for informal sur-\nrogate decision makers, as well as the factors that\npredict the likelihood of communicating medical\ncare preferences through both informal discussions\nand formally designated advance directives. The spe-\ncific research questions are as follows:\n1. Whom do community-dwelling older persons\ntrust to make health care decisions for them if\nthey are unable to make such decisions them-\nselves, and how do these preferences vary by\nmarital status and the presence of living children?\n2. Whom do older persons appoint as DPAHCs and\nhow do DPAHC appointments vary by marital sta-\ntus and the presence of living children?\n3. What is the role of demographic factors and health\nstatus in predicting the likelihood of informal dis-\ncussion of health care preferences?\n4. What is the role of demographic factors and health\nstatus in predicting the likelihood of designating\nhealth care preferences through formally designated\nadvance directives, including living wills and\nBackground\nPreferences of Older Persons for Health Care\nDecision Makers\nThe hierarchical compensatory model (Cantor,\n1979) suggests that older people have a hierarchical\npreference for support and assistance from family\nmembers and turn to nonfamily members only when\nfamilial sources of support are unavailable. The model\nfurther suggests that older people have a particular\npreference for support from spouses, when available,\nfollowed by children and other relatives. Consistent\nwith this theoretical perspective, studies suggest that\nspouses provide the most comprehensive care for\nolder persons (Tennstedt, Crawford, & McKinlay, 1993),\nthat children are the most frequently chosen helpers for\nthose without spouses (Penning, 1990), and that older\npersons turn to nonfamily members such as neighbors\nand friends only when familial sources of assistance\nVery little research is available concerning the ap-\nplicability of the hierarchical compensatory model to\nthe preferences of older persons for informal medical\nsurrogate decision makers. One of the few studies to\nexamine this issue was conducted based on a survey\nof 40 residents of Fayette County, Kentucky (High,\n1988). Consistent with the hierarchical model, this\nstudy found that married persons were most likely to\ndesignate a spouse as the person they would want to\nmake the final decision about health care if they were\ntoo sick to do so; among those who were widowed,\nchildren were most often designated. Only those\nwho did not have available family members chose\nnonrelatives such as friends, doctors, and lawyers.\nAdditional work, based on larger and more representa-\ntive samples than those available in the High (1988)\nstudy, are needed in order to further test the applica-\nbility of Cantor's hierarchical model to the prefer-\nences of older persons for surrogate decision makers.\nFactors Related to Completion of Advance Directives\nExisting studies have focused on the role of socio-\ndemographic and health factors as predictors of ad-\nvance directive completion. A study based on analysis\nof medical records from the Program for All Inclusive\nCare of the Elderly (PACE) found that African American\npatients were significantly less likely than White patients\nto complete a DPAHC (Eleazer et al., 1996). Another\nstudy, based on surveys of older adults attending nu-\ntrition sites, found that White participants were sig-\nnificantly more likely than non-White participants to\nindicate that they planned on completing a living will\nin the future (Stelter et al., 1992). Advance directive\ncompletion has also been found to be associated\nwith higher rather than lower levels of educational\nevidence suggests that race and educational level ap-\npear to have independent effects on durable power of\nattorney appointment, because African Americans\nare less likely to complete a DPAHC than Whites\neven after controlling for education (Eleazer et al.,\n1996). Completion of advance directives has also\nbeen found to be higher among persons in older age\ngroups compared with younger age groups (Elpern et\nlower self-reported health status compared with\nthose with higher self-reported health status (Elpern\nDespite the importance of family members in sur-\nrogate decision making, relatively few studies have\nexamined the role of family structure on the likeli-\nhood of completing advance directives. Although\none study found no significant difference by marital\nstatus in the likelihood of completing advance direc-\ntives (Elpern et al., 1993), most other studies have not\nincluded marital status as an explanatory factor. Con-\nsistent with the hierarchical compensatory model,\nmarried persons might prefer to bypass an advance\ndirective because of a belief that their spouse already\nknows their medical care preferences, and because\nthe close and continual proximity of spouses pro-\nvides greater opportunities for informal discussion of\npreferences for medical care. Persons who are not\nmarried, in contrast, may be less certain that their\nchildren and other family members know their health\ncare preferences, and may therefore seek formal ad-\nvance directives as a means of ensuring that their\nmedical care preferences are clearly communicated.\nFactors Related to Informal Discussion of Health\nCare Preferences\nBy far the most common method of communicat-\ning health care preferences is through informal com-\nmunication with family members or other informal\nnetwork members. A study of clinical outpatients at\nan academic medical center found that more than\nhalf (65%) had discussed with someone how they\nwished to be treated if they became critically ill. Of\nthese persons, 55% had discussed these matters with\nfamily members and 18% had discussed them with\nfriends, while only 7% had engaged in discussions\nwith physicians (Elpern et al., 1993). Even though in-\nformal discussion is the most common means of\ncommunicating health care wishes, very little is known\nabout the likelihood of actually engaging in such dis-\ncussions.\nSociodemographic and health factors, which have\nbeen shown to predict the likelihood of completing\nadvance directives, may also be associated with the\nlikelihood of engaging in informal discussions. In\nparticular, African Americans and persons with lower\nlevels of education may be less likely to have informal\ndiscussions about health care preferences, whereas\npersons with lower self-rated health status may be more\nlikely to engage in informal discussions because they\nperceive a greater need to communicate their prefer-\nences for health to those who are close to them. Be-\ncause the marital relationship is usually characterized\nby close and continual proximity between spouses\n(Litwak, 1985), married persons are likely to have\ngreater opportunities for informal discussion of health\ncare preferences. In contrast, persons who are not\nmarried are not likely to have the same opportunities\nfor informal discussion.\nMethods\nSample\nThis study is based on public release data (Version\n1.0) from the Asset and Health Dynamics among the\noldest-old (AHEAD) study conducted by the Univer-\nsity of Michigan Institute for Survey Research. The\nAHEAD study is based on a representative sample of\nolder persons (born in 1923 or earlier) living in the\ncontinental United States, and residing outside of in-\nstitutional settings at the time of the first wave of\n(Myers, Juster, & Suzman, 1997). Almost all of the\nyounger respondents (those born between 1914 and\n1923) were selected based on a multistage area prob-\nability sample from a screening of household units\noriginally conducted for the Health and Retirement\nStudy (HRS). For older respondents (those born in\n1913 or earlier), a dual sampling frame was used to\nobtain data on frail older persons who might not oth-\nerwise be included based on a multistage screening.\nHalf of the respondents in these older age groups\nwere obtained through list samples from the enroll-\nment database, a subset of the Medicare Beneficiary\nSurvey, while half were obtained through the same\nHRS screening process used for the younger respon-\ndents (Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, & Wallace, 1997).\nThe sample for this study consists of 520 persons\nwho were aged 70 and older at the time of the first\nwave of the AHEAD study, and who were subse-\nquently selected as respondents to an experimental\nmodule as part of the second wave of the AHEAD\nstudy conducted in 1995. The experimental modules\nare given to a random selection of respondents and\nare designed to provide preliminary data on areas of\ninterest to researchers where there are few valid mea-\nsures or well-developed research hypotheses (Soldo\net al., 1997). The module used for the present study\nconsisted of a series of questions concerning advance\ncare planning and preferences for health care deci-\nsion makers.\nThe characteristics of the study sample are shown in\nTable 1. The majority of the sample was female (62.6%),\nthan a high school education, half (50.6%) had a high\nschool education, and roughly one fifth (17.4%) had\na college education or higher. Approximately one tenth\n(11.4%) reported excellent health status, while slightly\nmore than one fourth reported their health as very good\n(20.6%) reported fair health status, while a smaller\nnumber (8.9%) reported poor health status. Slightly\nfewer than one half (44.3%) were married and had living\nchildren, while roughly two fifths (39.3%) were not\nmarried (widowed, divorced, or separated) and had liv-\ning children. Fewer were married with no living children\n(7.0%) or not married with no living children (9.4%).\nMeasures\nThe dependent measures for this study include: (a)\npreferences for surrogate health care decision mak-\ners; (b) preferences for DPAHC; (c) completion of a\nliving will; (d) completion of a DPAHC; and (e) infor-\nmal discussion of health care preferences. Prefer-\nences for surrogate health care decision makers are\nbased on a question in which respondents were\nasked, \"Is there someone that you would trust to\nmake health care decisions if you could not make\nthem for yourself?\" Those who answered yes to this\nquestion were asked, \"Who would that be?\" Poten-\ntial response categories include spouse, child/child-\nin-law/grandchild, other relative, friend, physician/\nhealthcare professional, minister/rabbi/priest/religious\nadvisor, attorney, social worker, and \"other.\" Re-\nspondents were instructed to choose as many categories\nas they wished.\nPreferences for DPAHCs are based on questions in\nwhich respondents who reported having a DPAHC\nwere asked to indicate whom they had appointed as\na DPAHC and their relationship to this person. Poten-\ntial response categories are identical to those for the\nquestion concerning surrogate decision makers. How-\never, respondents were allowed only one response\ncategory for this question.\nCompletion of a living will is based on the ques-\ntion, \"Do you have written instructions about the\ntype of medical treatment you would want to receive\nif you were unconscious or somehow unable to com-\nmunicate?\" Completion of a DPAHC is based on the\nquestion, \"Have you made legal arrangements for\nsomeone to make decisions about your care or medi-\ncal treatment if you became unable to make deci-\nsions yourself? This is sometimes called a Durable\nPower of Attorney for Health Care.\" Those who an-\nswered affirmatively to the first question were coded as\nhaving a living will (1  yes), and those who answered\naffirmatively to the second question were coded as\nhaving a DPAHC (1  yes).\nInformal discussion of health care preferences is\nbased on a question asked of persons who indicated\nthat they had someone they would trust to make\nhealth care decisions. Those respondents who an-\nswered affirmatively to this question were asked,\n\"Have you talked with (this person/these persons)\nabout what type of care you would want if you\ncouldn't make decisions for yourself?\" A dichoto-\nmous variable is constructed to represent whether re-\nspondents reported having informal discussions of\nhealth care preferences (1  yes, 0  no).\nSociodemographic and health factors that previ-\nous studies have identified as predictors of comple-\ntion of living wills and DPAHCs are used on the re-\ngressions predicting completion of these types of\nadvance directives and are also used as predictors of\nthe likelihood of engaging in informal discussions. Race\nis measured as a dichotomous variable (1  African\nAmerican, 0  White). Age is based on a series of\nas the reference group category. Education is based\non dummy variables representing high school and\ncollege education, and less than high school is the\nomitted reference category. Self-rated health status is\nbased on a five point scale (1  poor, 5  excellent).\nIn order to investigate the possible impact of family\nstructure on the dependent variables, three dummy\nvariables are used to represent marital status and the\npresence of living children. The dummy variable cat-\negories include not married with living children, married\nwith no living children, and not married with no living\nchildren. Married with living children is the omitted\nreference category.\nAnalytic Strategy\nTo address the first research question concerning\npreferences for health care decision makers, fre-\nquency tables are computed on the percentage of re-\nspondents mentioning preferences for different types\nTable 1.

Fre-\nquency distributions are computed separately for per-\nsons with different family configurations, including\nmarried and living children, married and no living\nchildren, not married and living children, and not\nmarried and no living children. To address the sec-\nond research question concerning preferences for\nDPAHC, similar frequency tables are constructed to\nindicate the category of persons who are appointed\nas DPAHC for those respondents who indicate that\nthey have a DPAHC (n  137). For the analysis for\nboth research questions, sample weights are used to\nprovide correct national-level estimates for the fre-\nquency distributions.\nTo address the third and fourth research questions,\nthree logistic regressions are used to predict: (a) the\nlikelihood of having a living will; (b) the likelihood of\nhaving a DPAHC; and (c) the likelihood of having an\ninformal discussion of health care preferences. For all\nof the logistic regressions, sociodemographic factors\n(age, race, education, and marital status) and self-\nrated health status are used as predictors in the\nmodel. In addition to the use of sample weights, the\nsurvey estimation programs in the Stata statistical\nprogram (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) are used to\ncompute correct standard errors and associated sig-\nnificance levels for the logistic regressions (Eltinge &\nResults\nAs shown in Table 2, the vast majority of respon-\ndents (95.0%) indicated that they had someone they\ntrusted to make health care decisions if they were un-\nable to do so. However, fewer than half (48.8%) had\ntalked with such persons about their preferences for\nmedical care in such situations. The majority of re-\nspondents (62.8%) did not have advance directives.\nApproximately one tenth had living wills (9.1%) or\ntypes of advance directive documents.\nData pertaining to the first research question,\nwhich concerned whom older persons would trust to\nmake health care decisions for them if they were un-\nable to make such decisions for themselves, are\nshown in Table 3. Respondents were instructed to re-\nport all persons whom they would trust to make med-\nical decisions for them if they were unable to do so,\nand the table shows the proportion of respondents\nmentioning specific categories of persons as trusted\ndecision makers. Among married persons with living\nchildren, younger generation members were the most\ncommonly mentioned (71.9 %), with a smaller num-\nber mentioning spouses (58.5%). Among married\npersons who did not have living children, spouses\nwere most commonly mentioned as those they would\nmentioned younger generation members. Among un-\nmarried persons with living children, the vast majority\nmentioned younger generation members as trusted\ndecision makers (95.8%), with smaller percentages\nmentioning other relatives (3.7%), nonrelatives (4.6%),\nor spouses (1.8%). Among unmarried persons who\nhad no living children, other relatives were the most\ncommonly mentioned decision makers (71.4%), while\none fifth (19.7%) mentioned nonrelatives.\nTable 4 presents the types of persons appointed as\nDPAHCs. Among married persons with living children,\nchoices for a DPAHC were approximately equally di-\nvided between spouses (45.6%) and younger genera-\ntion members (48.5%), with a smaller number (6.0%)\nindicating other physicians or other health care pro-\nviders. Among persons who were married with no\nliving children, only half (51.0%) appointed a spouse\nas a DPAHC, followed by younger generation members\nIn contrast, among those who were not married, but\nhad living children, the vast majority chose younger\ngeneration members as DPAHCs (96.6%), while only\na small number (2.3%) chose other relatives.

Compared with married persons with living\nchildren, those who were not married who had living\nchildren were significantly more likely to report hav-\ning informal discussions (p  .05). No other variables\nwere significantly related to the likelihood of report-\ning an informal discussion.\nDiscussion\nThe results from this study indicate that the hier-\narchical compensatory model proposed by Cantor\n(1979), which has most commonly been used to ex-\namine the preferences of older persons for care and\nsupport, is partially applicable to the preferences of\nolder persons for health care decision makers. Con-\nsistent with previous research, which finds that chil-\ndren are the most frequently chosen helpers for per-\nsons without spouses (Penning, 1990), unmarried\npersons with living children were most likely to se-\nlect younger generation members as potential health\ncare decision makers. Among persons with neither a\nspouse nor a living child, other relatives were most\ncommonly chosen as both trusted health care deci-\nsion makers and DPAHCs. In contrast, relatives other\nthan a spouse or younger generation member were\nrarely chosen as preferred decision makers by those\nwho had a spouse or who had living children. Con-\nsistent with the hierarchical compensatory model,\nthese findings suggest that older persons tend to se-\nlect spouses and younger generation members as po-\ntential surrogate decision makers, and turn to other\nrelatives and nonrelatives only when these close fam-\nily members are not available.\nFindings concerning the preferences for trusted de-\ncision makers and appointments of DPAHC among\nmarried persons with living children are less consis-\nTable 3.

The\nmodel suggests that spouses, when available, should\nbe the most commonly chosen decision makers for\nolder persons. However, among respondents with\nboth spouses and living children, members of the\nyounger generation (children, children-in-law, and\ngrandchildren) were more likely than spouses to be\nmentioned as persons they would trust to make\nhealth care decisions. Moreover, approximately one\nthird of married persons with children selected both\nspouses and younger generation members as those\nthey would trust to make decisions. Furthermore,\namong married persons with living children who had\nmade a DPAHC appointment, members of the younger\ngeneration and spouses were selected in roughly\nequal proportions as DPAHCs. Taken together, these\nfindings suggests that many older persons expect to\nmove beyond exclusive reliance on spouses when\nmaking health care decisions in the future.\nAlthough previous research suggests that the pri-\nmary providers of care for older persons are spouses,\nthe results from this study indicate that members of\nthe younger generation (children, children-in-law,\nand grandchildren) are frequently mentioned as those\nwhom older persons would trust to make health care\ndecisions and to serve as DPAHCs. One explanation\nfor these findings is that most caregiving tasks require\nclose and continual proximity to the older person,\nand such proximity is typically provided by spouses\nrather than by younger generation members (Litwak,\n1985). Younger generation members may be more\navailable as health care decision makers, because\nthis is likely to be a short-term role and typically does\nnot require ongoing and continual proximity to the\nolder person. Consistent with this view, previous re-\nsearch suggests that older persons anticipate that\nmembers of the younger generation will make them-\nselves available for consultation and discussion on\nhealth care matters even if they are not in close geo-\ngraphical proximity to the older person (High, 1987).\nOlder persons may also anticipate that their spouses\nwill be deceased or incapacitated themselves at the\ntime that such health care decisions are needed, and\nthat members of the younger generation will there-\nfore be better able to communicate with the health\ncare system regarding their needs and preferences.\nConsistent with previous research, this study found\na higher likelihood of advance directive completion,\nincluding both living wills and DPAHCs, among\nWhite respondents compared with African American\nrespondents. A number of factors have been pro-\nposed to explain the lower level of advance directive\ncompletion among African Americans, including dis-\ntrust of the medical system, previous experience of\nbeing denied medical care, and a consequential fear\nthat advance directives are a means of preventing\nthem from receiving medical care to which they are\nentitled (Eleazer et al., 1996). With the advent of\nmanaged care, many health care providers have ad-\nvocated advance directives are a way of potentially\nlimiting the use of expensive health care procedures\nat the end of life. However, there has not been a cor-\nresponding emphasis on the potential of advance di-\nrectives as mechanisms for ensuring that those pa-\ntients who want to receive the most extensive care\npossible are able to do so. Because studies suggest\nthat African Americans are more likely to prefer medical\ntreatments that prolong life (Carlais, Davis, Wright, &\nagement of the use of advance directives as a means\nof either prolonging or limiting medical care at the\nend of life may encourage greater use of these docu-\nTable 5.

This finding\nsuggests that, although many African Americans are\nreluctant to complete advance directives, they may\nbe more open to the possibility of engaging in infor-\nmal discussions of health care preferences.\nLike previous studies (e.g., Stelter et al., 1992), this\nstudy found a greater rate of advance directive com-\npletion among those with higher rather than lower\nlevels of educational attainment. Many older persons\nhave difficulty understanding the technical language\nin written material on advance directives (Gamble,\nMcDonald, & Lichstein, 1991), and those with lower\nlevels of education are likely to need additional inter-\nventions in order to promote greater knowledge and\nuse of these documents. One strategy is the use of\none of the many educational videos that have been\ndeveloped in recent years to explain and promote the\nuse of advance directives (Foundation for Informed\nMedical Decison Making, 1998; Herb & Dubler,\nvideos, in addition to providing clear explanations of\nadvance directive documents, include stories by\nolder persons and their family members in which\nthey recount actual experiences of making health\ncare decisions on behalf of the older persons who\nwere unable to participate. These videos, which can\nbe used in outpatient clinics, community-based gath-\nerings, or in an older person's own home, may be\nparticularly useful for older persons who have diffi-\nculty reading and understanding the written materials\non advance directives that are most commonly avail-\nable in health care settings.\nThis study found that both informal discussion of\nhealth care preferences and completion of formal ad-\nvance directives were more common among unmar-\nried persons who had living children than among\nmarried persons with children. Married persons may\nassume that their spouses know their health care\npreferences, while unmarried persons may recognize\nthe importance of direct communication of health\ncare wishes through informal discussion and/or ad-\nvance directives. Alternatively, children of married\nolder persons may not engage in informal discussions\nof health care preferences or encourage completion\nof advanced directives because they assume that\nsuch issues will be discussed between their parents.\nFurthermore, children of older persons may not feel\nthat it is necessary or appropriate to discuss these is-\nsues if parents' spouses are available. Greater recog-\nnition is needed by health care providers of the im-\nportant role played by the younger generation in\nmaking health care decisions for older persons. Prac-\ntitioners should make greater efforts to include younger\ngeneration members in discussions concerning health\ncare decisions and advance care planning.\nSeveral limitations of the current research should be\nnoted. A first limitation is that the category \"younger\ngeneration member\" includes several types of family\nmembers, including children, children-in-law, and\ngrandchildren. The greater number of potential persons\nincluded in the younger generation category increases\nthe likelihood that younger generation members will\nbe chosen as either health care decision makers or\nDPAHCs. Because of the way in which the questions\nconcerning children are coded in the AHEAD module\nused for this study, it is not possible to specify prefer-\nences for different types of younger generation members\n(e.g., child, grandchild, stepchild). Such data are needed\nin order to obtain more information about the prefer-\nences of older persons for health care decision makers.\nA second limitation is that the data are based on\nself-reports of older persons concerning advance di-\nrective completion. No data is available concerning\nwhether advance directives have been documented\naccording to legal guidelines in individual states, or\nthe extent to which they are accurately recorded and\navailable to health care providers. Because respon-\ndents were asked about the presence of \"written in-\nstructions\" but not specifically about living wills, it is\npossible that some advance directives documented in\nthis study consist of informal written instructions rather\nthan formally executed living wills.\nA third limitation of this study is that the data are\nbased on self-reports of informal discussions of health\ncare preferences. Some evidence from research on\nelderly parent\u00adadult child dyads suggests that adult\nchildren are more likely to report having such discus-\nsions than are older persons themselves (Cicirelli,\n1992). Because adult children were not asked a si-\nmilar set of questions in the AHEAD survey module,\nit is not possible to examine the extent of congruence\nbetween reports of older persons and their adult chil-\ndren concerning whether informal discussions have\ntaken place.\nThe results of this study suggest a number of po-\ntential areas for future research. First, more research\nis needed on the factors that predict the likelihood of\nhaving informal discussions of health care wishes in\nthe event that older persons are unable to make such\ndecisions for themselves. As in previous studies (Elpern\net al., 1993), this study found that informal communi-\ncation was the most common means of expressing\nhealth care preferences. However, more information\nis needed on the factors that predict the likelihood of\nengaging in such discussions. Race and educational\nattainment, which have been found to be predictive\nof advance directive completion in previous studies,\nwere unrelated to informal discussion, suggesting the\nneed for additional examination of factors that facilitate\nor impede informal discussion. Such factors may in-\nclude the role of health beliefs, the extent of contact\nwith the medical care system, and perceptions of the\nabilities and competencies of various family members\non issues related to medical decision making. In ad-\ndition, more research is needed on the types of issues\ncovered in these informal discussions, as well as the\ncontext and process by which these conversations\nare initiated with family members and other potential\nhealth care surrogates.\nIn future studies, it would be useful to have an ad-\nditional question in which respondents are asked to\nindicate the person they would most prefer to make\nhealth care decisions if they were unable to do so\nthemselves. In this study, the preferences of older\npersons for health care decision makers were defined\nin terms of whom they would trust to make health\ncare decisions. Respondents were not specifically\nasked to indicate their hierarchical preferences for\nhealth care surrogates and were instead instructed to\nlist all potential categories of persons (e.g., spouse,\nchild, relative) whom they would trust to make such\ndecisions. Such information would be useful in better\ndetermining whether the health care preferences of\nolder adults are consistent with the hierarchical model.\nMore research is also needed concerning the process\nby which older persons make decisions regarding health\ncare decision makers and their reasons for choosing\nparticular family members as surrogates.\nMore information is also needed on the extent of\ninformal discussion concerning health care prefer-\nences in the event of decisional incapacity. The con-\nversations could be quite limited, consisting of a\npassing remark about \"not wanting to be a vegetable,\"\nor could be extensive, covering specific kinds of medi-\ncal interventions that are desired or not desired under\nparticular circumstances. It may be that education\nand race, which were not significantly related to in-\nformal discussions in the present study, may be related\nto the likelihood of engaging in these more extensive\ninformal discussions of health care preferences.\nFinally, this study has focused on expectations and\nplanning among community-dwelling elders on is-\nsues related to end-of-life care. More information is\nneeded on how informal discussions and advance di-\nrectives are used to inform decision making at the\nend of life, based on documentation of the actual ex-\nperiences of family members coping with the death\nof an older family member. Data on these issues can\nprovide valuable information on how best to educate\nand assist older persons on issues related to advance\ncare planning in ways that are consistent with indi-\nvidual needs and preferences.\nReferences\nCantor, M.
