This study describes the\ndietary supplement usage patterns, health, and nutritional status of long-term multiple dietary supplement users, and\nwhere possible makes comparisons to non-users and multivitamin/mineral supplement users.\nMethods: Using a cross-sectional study design, information was obtained by online questionnaires and physical\nexamination (fasting blood, blood pressure, body weight) from a convenience sample of long-term users of multiple\ndietary supplements manufactured by Shaklee Corporation (Multiple Supp users, n = 278). Data for non-users (No Supp\nusers, n = 602) and multivitamin/mineral supplement users (Single Supp users, n = 176) were obtained from the National\nmethods were used to estimate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.\nResults: Dietary supplements consumed on a daily basis by more than 50% of Multiple Supp users included a\nmultivitamin/mineral, B-complex, vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin E, calcium with vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids,\nflavonoids, lecithin, alfalfa, coenzyme Q10 with resveratrol, glucosamine, and a herbal immune supplement. The majority\nof women also consumed gamma linolenic acid and a probiotic supplement, whereas men also consumed zinc, garlic, saw\npalmetto, and a soy protein supplement. Serum nutrient concentrations generally increased with increasing dietary\nsupplement use. After adjustment for age, gender, income, education and body mass index, greater degree of supplement\nuse was associated with more favorable concentrations of serum homocysteine, C-reactive protein, high-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as lower risk of prevalent elevated blood pressure and diabetes.\nConclusion: This group of long-term multiple dietary supplement users consumed a broad array of vitamin/mineral,\nherbal, and condition-specific dietary supplements on a daily basis. They were more likely to have optimal concentrations\nof chronic disease-related biomarkers, and less likely to have suboptimal blood nutrient concentrations, elevated blood\npressure, and diabetes compared to non-users and multivitamin/mineral users. These findings should be confirmed by\nstudying the dietary supplement usage patterns, health, and nutritional status of other groups of heavy users of dietary\nsupplements.\nThis article is available from: http://www.nutritionj.com/content/6/1/30\n\u00a9 2007 Block et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nDiet and nutrition play important roles in the mainte-\nnance of health and prevention of disease [1,2]. Dietary\nsupplements represent an important source of essential\nnutrients since they are widely used and often contain\n100% or more of the Daily Value of one or more nutrients\n[3,4]. They are also of concern because of potential\nadverse effects [5]. Prior studies have reported the preva-\nlence of dietary supplement usage and the characteristics\nof users in the United States (US) population. In the most\nrecent reporting of nationwide survey data, the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nplement in the past 30 days [4]. This and other surveys\nhave generally found that dietary supplement usage is\nmore common in women than men, in older participants\nthan in younger ones, in Whites compared with Blacks\nand Mexican Americans, in the more educated as com-\npared to the less educated, and in the more affluent as\napproximately 47% of dietary supplement users reported\ntaking only one type of supplement (most commonly a\nmultivitamin/mineral) [4]. Only 3 individuals out of over\nplements in the past 30 days. Consequently, little if any\ndescriptive information has been reported about individ-\nuals who typically consume multiple dietary supple-\nments.\nThis cross-sectional study was undertaken to describe the\ndietary supplement usage patterns, serum nutrient and\nbiomarker concentrations, and health status of a conven-\nience sample of individuals who were daily users of mul-\ntiple dietary supplements (median of 26 different dietary\nsupplements taken daily in the prior 12 months). In addi-\ntion, biomarker concentrations and the health status of\nmultiple dietary supplement users were compared with\ntwo other convenience samples assembled from\nNHANES: non-users of supplements and those who con-\nsumed a multivitamin/mineral supplement only.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTo assemble a sample of long-term users of multiple die-\ntary supplements, individuals who had been consumers\nof dietary supplements for  20 years from a dietary sup-\nplement manufacturer and distributor (Shaklee Corpora-\ntion, Pleasanton, CA) were invited to participate in the\nstudy. The invitation was sent by electronic mail to\napproximately 1,200 individuals meeting this criterion.\nOf the total invitees, 435 successfully completed online\nquestionnaires to obtain information about height,\nannual household income, education, medical history\nand current medical conditions, and dietary supplement\nusage. Reasons for non-participation were not investi-\ngated. A subset of 300 individuals who completed the\nquestionnaires and were free of cancer, other than non-\nmelanoma skin cancer, were randomly chosen and asked\nto attend a physical examination for the purpose of pro-\nviding a 12-hour fasting blood sample and having their\nbody weight and blood pressure measured. A final ana-\nlytic sample of 278 participants had complete question-\nnaire and examination data. These individuals composed\nthe 'Multiple Supp' users. The study was reviewed and\napproved by an independent institutional review board\n(Health Research and Studies Center, Palo Alto, Califor-\nnia), and all participants provided informed consent.\nData collection\nFor the Multiple Supp users, online questionnaires were\nused to obtain information about height, annual house-\nhold income, education, medical history and current\nmedical conditions, and current dietary supplement\nusage. Questions about medical history and current med-\nical conditions were patterned after questions asked in\ntionnaire included 57 dietary supplements and foods sold\nby Shaklee in 2005 and asked about usual intake in the\nprevious 12 months. The questionnaire included four\nintake frequency categories including 'rarely or never\nused,' '1\u00ad3 days per week,' '4\u00ad6 days per week,' and 'every\nday,' and also asked about usual serving size.\nPhysical examinations were conducted during a national\nmeeting of Shaklee product consumers held in Chicago,\nIllinois in August 2005. Data collection took place\nbetween July and August of 2005. Body weight was meas-\nured using a physician's scale with shoes and heavy cloth-\ning removed. Triplicate blood pressure measurements\nwere taken by an automated Welch Allyn device (Model\n5201) with an appropriate-sized cuff after subjects were\nseated quietly in a chair for 2 minutes, with feet on the\nground and with the arm at the level of the heart. Twelve-\nhour fasting blood samples were collected, processed,\naliquoted and stored frozen at -80\u00b0C. Samples were\nassayed for red blood cell (RBC) folate, serum ascorbic\nacid stabilized using 10% metaphosphoric acid, alpha\ntocopherol, carotenoids, retinol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D,\nferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipids, and homo-\ncysteine (Table 1). Assay procedures followed those that\nMultivitamin/mineral and non-supplement users from\nNHANES\na source of comparison data for multivitamin users and\nnon-users of supplements. NHANES is designed to moni-\ntor the health and nutrition status of the US population\nand participation consisted of an in-home interview and\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nan examination in the NHANES mobile examination unit\n[6]. Dietary supplement intake was assessed in NHANES\nby asking participants about their dietary supplement\nusage patterns in the past 30 days prior to their home\ninterview, including use of any vitamins, minerals, or\nother dietary supplements. NHANES oversamples certain\ngroups, such as older people and low-income individuals,\nin order to obtain greater precision in estimates for those\ngroups; sample weights are applied by NHANES to adjust\nfor oversampling and nonresponse. NHANES sample\nselection involves a stratified multistage probability\ndesign involving counties, blocks, and households. Con-\nsequently, variance estimates require use of special soft-\nware making use of NHANES strata and primary sampling\nunits to account for the sampling design.\nTo match the age and race composition of the Multiple\nipants all of the White men and women, >35 years of age,\nand free of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer,\nwho met certain supplement use criteria. Only non-sup-\nplement users and users of supplements containing vita-\nmins and/or minerals were included for the present\nanalysis. We identified 602 NHANES participants who\nconsumed no dietary supplements in the 30 days prior to\nthe home interview; these became the 'No Supp' users. We\nalso identified 176 individuals who consumed a multivi-\ntamin/mineral and no other dietary supplements, and did\nso at least 15 days over the past 30 days. These became the\n'Single Supp' users. To obtain the most recent data possi-\nble for comparative purposes, RBC folate, and serum fer-\nritin, homocysteine, CRP, and lipid data were obtained\nascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol, and serum carotenoid\nSupp and No Supp users who were White, >35 years of\nage, and free of cancer other than non-melanoma skin\n[8,9]. The geographical distribution of the individuals in\nthe three users groups is not known. In addition, the dura-\ntion of dietary supplement usage by NHANES partici-\npants, aside from the 30 days prior to their home\ninterview, is unknown.\nStatistical analyses\nAfter combining the Multiple Supp users with the Single\nSupp and No Supp users from NHANES, data were\nreweighted. The weights for the NHANES groups were cal-\nculated by dividing each NHANES weight by the sum of\nthe NHANES weights of the user group. Appropriate\nweights were used depending on whether the data came\nfrom the interview or the Mobile Examination Center.\nMultiple Supp users were assigned a weight of 1. Strata\nand primary sampling units from NHANES were used for\nthose user groups. For the Multiple Supp users, a new stra-\ntum variable was assigned, and each member of the Mul-\ntiple Supp group was assigned to a unique primary\nsampling unit. These adjustments permit more accurate\nvariance estimates and account for stratification factors.\nHowever, the Single Supp and No Supp users from\nNHANES should not be interpreted as being nationally\nrepresentative samples.

Multiple regression techniques were\nemployed to examine differences in nutrient and biomar-\nker concentrations of user groups. Comparisons of mean\nnutrient concentrations among user groups (RBC folate,\nand serum retinol, ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol, caro-\ntenoids, and ferritin) were adjusted for sex and age. Com-\nparisons of biomarker concentrations among user groups\n(serum homocysteine, CRP, total cholesterol, and lipids)\nwere further adjusted for age2, education category (<high\nschool, high school graduate, or >high school), income\nindex (BMI). For outcomes treated as dichotomous varia-\nbles, logistic regression methods were used to estimate\nodds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI),\nadjusted for sex, age and age2, education category, income\ncategory and income2, and BMI. The model fit was exam-\nined using the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit\ntest. The referent group for risk estimation was the No\nSupp user group. Statistical significance was defined as p\nElevated blood pressure was defined as >80 mmHg for\ndiastolic and/or >120 mmHg for systolic blood pressure\n[13].

The two supplement user groups were\nolder than the No Supp users, and had lower BMI. Multi-\nple Supp users were well-educated with 86% having\ngreater than a high school education compared to approx-\nimately 55% in the other two user groups. The proportion\nwith annual household incomes less than $30,000 was\nrespectively, and 2.5% in the Multiple Supp group. Partic-\nipants were predominately White because of the racial\ncomposition of the Multiple Supp users and the fact that\nSingle Supp and No Supp users were matched to Multiple\nSupp users on race.\nDietary supplement usage patterns\nBy definition, No Supp users consumed no supplements\nand Single Supp users consumed only a multivitamin/\nmineral dietary supplement and did so approximately\nevery other day or more often. Multiple Supp users\nTable 2: Characteristics of the three supplement user groups: multiple dietary supplement users (Multiple Supp) from Shaklee, and\nmultivitamin/mineral users (Single Supp) and non-users (No Supp) from NHANES 2001\u00ad2002.\n*Differences among the supplement user groups were evaluated using chi-square methods for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance\nfor continuous variables. BMI = body mass index.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nreported taking an average of 25 different supplements in\nthe past 12 months (median, 26), and took an average of\n17 different supplements every day (median, 18) (data\nnot shown). Dietary supplements consumed on a daily\nbasis by more than 50% of both male and female Multiple\nSupp users included a multivitamin/mineral, B-complex,\nvitamin C, vitamin E, calcium with vitamin D, a herbal\nimmune supplement, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids,\nflavonoids, lecithin, coenzyme Q10 with resveratrol,\nalfalfa, and glucosamine (Table 3). In addition, a majority\nof women also consumed gamma linolenic acid and a\nprobiotic supplement, whereas men also consumed zinc,\ngarlic, a soy protein supplement, and saw palmetto daily.\nSerum nutrient and biomarker concentrations\nThere was a statistically significant increase in RBC folate\nand serum concentrations of ascorbic acid, alpha and beta\ncarotene, and alpha tocopherol with degree of supple-\nmentation use (Table 4). For these nutrients, Single Supp\nusers had significantly higher nutrient concentrations\nthan No Supp users, and Multiple Supp users had higher\nconcentrations than the Single Supp group. Serum retinol\nwas higher among Single and Multiple Supp users com-\npared to No Supp users. Among women, serum ferritin\nwas highest in Multiple Supp users and lower in the Single\nSupp users compared to No Supp users. Among men,\nserum ferritin was significantly lower in the Multiple Supp\nusers compared to the two other supplement groups.\nThere was a decrease in concentrations of biomarkers\nassociated with disease risk as supplement use increased\n(Table 4). Across the three user groups there was a\ndecrease in serum CRP and the ratio of total cholesterol to\nHDL-cholesterol, and an increase in HDL-cholesterol con-\ncentration. Serum homocysteine and triglycerides were\nlower in the Multiple Supp users than in the other two\ngroups. Finally, serum total cholesterol was significantly\nlower in the Multiple Supp group, whereas LDL-choles-\nterol concentrations did not vary significantly by supple-\nment use.\nAmong Multiple Supp users, no individuals had subopti-\nmal or elevated serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentra-\nhydroxyvitamin D data were available from NHANES. No\nMultiple Supp users had suboptimal serum ascorbic acid\nconcentrations (<0.4 mg/dL), compared with 9.4%\namong Single Supp users and 32.4% among the No Supp\ngroup (data not shown). Similarly, 94.1% of Multiple\nSupp users had serum ascorbic acid concentrations >1.0\nmg/dL, compared with 46.6% of Single Supp users and\n21.9% of No Supp users (data not shown).\nTable 3: Dietary supplement usage patterns of long-term users of multiple dietary supplements (Multiple Supp users).\nDietary supplement type Average daily usage % of women who were daily users % of men who were daily users\nVitamin E (d-alpha tocopherol and mixed\ntocopherols)\nProbiotic supplement (from Bifidobacterium longum\nand Lactobacillus acidophilus)\n*35\u00ad200% of the Daily Value for 25 vitamin and minerals and also includes 5 trace minerals.\n250 million/d Bifidobacterium longum and 250 million/d Lactobacillus acidophilus.\n500 mg/d plant extracts from pumpkin seed (Curcubita moschata), safflower flower (Carthamus tinctorius), asian plantain seed (Plantago asiatica),\nJapanese honeysuckle flower (Lonicera japonica).\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBlood pressure and adverse biomarker concentrations\nAdjusted risk estimates for elevated blood pressure and\nsuboptimal or elevated concentrations of serum biomark-\ners are reported in Table 5. Compared to No Supp users,\nMultiple Supp users had significantly reduced risks of ele-\nvated serum homocysteine, triglycerides, and ratio of total\ncholesterol to HDL-cholesterol, and significantly reduced\nrisk of low HDL-cholesterol. For elevated serum CRP, the\nrisk among Multiple Supp users could not be estimated\nbecause of the absence of any persons with elevated values\nof CRP. Multiple Supp users also had a significantly\nreduced risk of elevated blood pressure compared to No\nSupp users. Single Supp users had significantly lower risks\nof elevated serum homocysteine, and low serum HDL-\ncholesterol. Risks of elevated serum total cholesterol and\nLDL-cholesterol did not significantly differ across the sup-\nplement user groups.\nHealth status and disease prevalence\nPrevalence of self-reported disease was low in each user\ngroup and most risk estimates did not reach statistical sig-\nnificance (Table 6). An exception was the reduced risk of\ndiabetes in Multiple Supp users (OR = 0.27; 95% CI:\nonly marginally statistically significant. For self-assessed\nhealth status, Multiple Supp users, but not Single Supp\nusers, were less likely to report their health as 'good, fair,\nor poor' versus 'excellent or very good' (OR = 0.26; 95%\n(Table 6).\nDiscussion\nLittle has been reported about daily users of multiple die-\ntary supplements. We assembled a sample of long-term\nusers of multiple dietary supplements for the purpose of\ndescribing their supplement usage patterns. On average,\nMultiple Supp users in this study consumed 17 different\nsupplements every day. Dietary supplements consumed\non a daily basis by more than 50% of Multiple Supp users\nincluded a multivitamin/mineral, B-complex, vitamin C,\ncarotenoids, vitamin E, calcium with vitamin D, omega-3\nfatty acids, flavonoids, lecithin, alfalfa, coenzyme Q10\nwith resveratrol, glucosamine, and a herbal immune sup-\nplement. Women also consumed gamma linolenic acid\nand a probiotic supplement, whereas men also consumed\nzinc, garlic, a soy protein supplement, and saw palmetto\nTable 4: Serum nutrient and biomarker concentrations of a sample of long-term users of multiple dietary supplements (Multiple\nSupp), and of multivitaminmineral users (Single Supp) and non-users (No Supp) from NHANES 2001\u00ad2002 and NHANES III 1988\u00ad\nMean (SE)\nNUTRIENTS\nBIOMARKERS\n*Multiple regression techniques were employed to examine differences in nutrient and biomarker concentrations of user groups.

Consistent\nwith other reports describing dietary supplement users\n[4], Multiple Supp users as a group were primarily White,\nbetter educated, more affluent, and older.\nA second objective of the study was to conduct a cross-sec-\ntional comparison of the relevant biomarker and nutrient\nconcentrations in the Multiple Supp users, with those of\nSingle Supp users (multivitamin/mineral users) and No\nNHANES III. Nutrient concentrations in serum or RBC\ngenerally increased across the three supplement user\ngroups. It is notable that Single Supp users had higher cir-\nculating concentrations than No Supp users for RBC folate\nand serum retinol, ascorbic acid, and alpha tocopherol.\nThis fact has important implications for nutrition inter-\nvention trials, some of which have permitted participants,\nincluding those in the control group, to take a multivita-\nmin/mineral supplement [25]. Our findings suggest that\nthis practice may weaken the power of trials to detect\ntreatment effects of the study supplement.\nDegree of supplement use was associated with several\nmarkers of disease risk. Elevated serum homocysteine\nconcentrations were found in approximately 45% of No\nSupp users, 37% of Single Supp users, and 11% of Multi-\nple Supp users, despite the fact that the data were obtained\nafter the 1998 fortification of grain products with folate,\nTable 5: Risk of suboptimal or elevated serum biomarker concentrations and elevated blood pressure by supplement user group.\nOutcome Cases: n/(%) OR* 95% CI*\nHomocysteine (>9 \u00b5mol/L)\nC-reactive protein (>0.3 mg/dL)\nTotal cholesterol (>200 mg/dL)\nHDL-cholesterol (<40 mg/dL\nmales, <50 mg/dL females)\nRatio total cholesterol to HDL-\ncholesterol (<5)\nBlood Pressure (DBP>80 mmHg\n* Logistic regression methods were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted as in footnote to Table 4.

If moderately-elevated serum\nhomocysteine is shown to be an important cardiovascular\ndisease risk factor, the findings of this study suggest that\nintake of the relevant B vitamins above what is typically\nfound in a multivitamin/mineral supplement, and/or the\ndiet, may produce a more favorable homocysteine-lower-\ning effect.\nCirculating CRP concentration has been shown to be pre-\ndictive of future cardiovascular disease risk in prospective\nstudies among asymptomatic individuals and may have a\ndirect effect on the progression of atherosclerosis [26]. In\nthe present study, serum CRP concentrations decreased\nand serum ascorbic acid increased with increasing degree\nof supplement use (Tables 2 and 4). This finding is con-\nsistent with recent reports that vitamin C supplementa-\ntion lowers plasma CRP concentrations [27], and that\ndietary intakes of vitamin C and plasma ascorbic acid con-\ncentration are inversely associated with plasma CRP [28].\nStudies are underway to confirm the impact of vitamin C\nsupplementation on circulating CRP and other markers of\nimmune function.\nSerum ascorbic acid concentration >1.0 mg/dL has been\nsuggested as optimal relative to reduced risk of cardiovas-\ncular disease and cancer [24]. By this definition, over 94%\nof Multiple Supp had optimal concentrations, compared\nto approximately 47% and 22% in Single Supp and No\nSupp users, respectively. Suboptimal concentrations,\ndefined as <0.4 mg/dL [23], were not found in the Multi-\nple Supp user group, and were found in approximately\n9% and 32% of Single Supp and No Supp users, respec-\ntively.\nSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in Multiple Supp users is of\ninterest because of possible beneficial and adverse effects\nfrom supplemental intake of vitamin D. Improving 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D concentrations above the level associ-\nated with subclinical deficiency (<37.5 nmol/L) may\nreduce the risk of skeletal fractures [16-19]. Also, parathy-\nroid hormone concentrations become minimal when 25-\nhydroxyvitamin D concentrations exceed 100 nmol/L.\nConversely, serum concentrations >600 nmol/L are asso-\nciated with hypercalcemia [19]. Among Multiple Supp\nusers, no individuals had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nable from NHANES participants.\nSupplement use was also associated with lower serum\ntriglycerides and higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations.\nIn consequence, the risk of an elevated ratio of total cho-\nlesterol to HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower in the\nMultiple Supp group compared to the No Supp group\n(Table 5). Prevalent use of fish oil supplements in the\nMultiple Supp users may explain these findings as omega-\n3 fatty acids in fish oil have been shown to increase HDL-\ncholesterol and decrease triglyceride concentrations [29].\nAlthough beyond the scope of the present study, lower\nrisk of cardiac arrhythmias may be another benefit of con-\nSelf-assessed health status has been found to be a remark-\nably good marker of prospective health outcomes [32].\nCompared to No Supp users, Multiple Supp users were\nmore likely to describe their health as 'very good' or 'excel-\nTable 6: Risk of prevalent disease, by supplement user group.\nOutcome Cases: n/(%) ** OR* 95% CI*\nDiabetes\nCoronary Heart Disease\nHeart Attack\nAngina\nCongestive Heart Failure\nStroke\nArthritis\nEmphysema\nHealth Status\n* Logistic regression methods were used to estimate odds ratios (OR)\nwith 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for sex, age and age2,\neducation, income and income2, and body mass index.

Dietary interventions have\nbeen shown to reduce blood pressure [33]. However, clin-\nical trials of individual nutrients have typically found\nsmall and inconsistent effects [33]. Dietary folate and vita-\nmin C, as well as plasma ascorbic acid, have been found\nto be inversely associated with blood pressure in observa-\ntional studies [34,35]. However, intervention trials with\nvitamin C have yielded inconsistent results [35], while in\ntwo small trials, folic acid has been effective at lowering\nblood pressure [36,37]. The finding of a lower risk of ele-\nvated blood pressure in the Multiple Supp group, which\nalso had the highest concentrations of RBC folate and\nserum ascorbic acid, suggests that the relationship\nbetween these nutrients and blood pressure may warrant\nfurther investigation.\nThe lower risk of diabetes in the Multiple Supp group is\nconsistent with evidence that oxidative stress may be a\nmechanism linking insulin resistance with dysfunction of\npancreatic beta cells and endothelial dysfunction, eventu-\nally leading to diabetes [38]. Although biomarkers of oxi-\ndative stress were not available in the three user groups,\nserum concentrations of antioxidants including ascorbic\nacid, carotenoids, and alpha tocopherol were all signifi-\ncantly higher in the Multiple Supp users compared to the\nother groups (Table 2).\nAn important limitation of the study is the fact that the\ndata are cross-sectional, and therefore the reported associ-\nations, particularly with health outcomes (i.e., blood pres-\nsure and diabetes), cannot presume causality. Also, the\nthree user groups should not be interpreted to represent\nunbiased national estimates. In addition, although we\nadjusted for potential confounders such as age, sex,\nincome, education, and BMI, residual confounding could\npossibly account for the findings. Better access to health\ncare and variables related to higher socioeconomic status\nin the supplement user groups (e.g., healthier diets and\nlifestyles) are logical hypotheses that may account for\nthese results. However, the No Supp and Single Supp user\ngroups were similar with respect to education and income\n(Table 2), so these factors may not explain the signifi-\ncantly better nutrient and C-reactive protein concentra-\ntions seen for Single Supp users in Table 4, and\nhomocysteine and HDL risk levels (Table 5). Further-\nmore, the lack of differences across the three user groups\nin biomarkers such as serum total cholesterol and LDL-\ncholesterol suggest that factors related to health care\naccess and socioeconomic status do not fully explain the\nresults.\nThis study is the first we are aware of to describe the usage\npatterns of long-term users of multiple dietary supple-\nments, an unusual sample that cannot be captured in\nnational representative surveys. While only 3 individuals\ntaken 20 or more kinds of dietary supplements in the past\n30 days, in our Multiple Supp users, 87% of the sample\nreported having taken 20 or more kinds of supplements\ndaily. Thus, this sample of Multiple Supp users affords a\nrare opportunity to understand a segment of the popula-\ntion that take multiple dietary supplements, and to under-\nstand the nutrient and other correlates of this practice. In\naddition, Multiple Supp users were long-term consumers\nof dietary supplements. Thus, their serum nutrient and\nbiomarker concentrations were likely to be representative\nof their long-term supplementation patterns.\nConclusion\nThis sample of long-term users of multiple dietary supple-\nments was found to consume a broad array of vitamin/\nmineral, herbal, and condition-specific dietary supple-\nments on a daily basis. They were more likely to have opti-\nmal concentrations of biomarkers associated with\nreduced disease risk, and less likely to have suboptimal\ncirculating nutrient concentrations, elevated blood pres-\nsure, and diabetes than multivitamin/mineral users and\nnon-users. There was no evidence that intake of vitamin D\nin multiple supplement users was excessive based on\nserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. These find-\nings should be confirmed by studying the dietary supple-\nment usage patterns and health and nutrition status of\nother groups of heavy users of dietary supplements. Our\nstudy findings should also be weighed in the context of\nrecent randomized controlled trials and related meta-\nanalyses [39,40] which have raised concern about poten-\ntial detrimental effects of select dietary supplements, par-\nticularly beta carotene and alpha tocopherol. While the\ntypical daily intake of beta carotene from supplements in\nthe Multiple Supp group was low relative to those studies\n(approximately 5000 IU/d of vitamin A as beta carotene),\nthe typical intake of alpha tocopherol was 800 IU/d, sim-\nilar to the dose in a number of randomized trials. Further\nresearch on usage patterns of dietary supplements and the\npotential health effects of dietary supplements is needed.\nThe present report serves as a baseline to which the find-\nings of subsequent monitoring efforts can be compared.\nAbbreviations\nUS = United States, NHANES = National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey, RBC = red blood cell, CRP\n= C-reactive protein, BMI = body mass index, OR = odds\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nratio, CI = confidence interval, HDL = high-density lipo-\nprotein, LDL = low-density lipoprotein.\nCompeting interests\nThe study was financially supported by Shaklee Corpora-\ntion.
