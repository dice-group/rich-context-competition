However, the\nrelationship of depression to other outcomes of chronic caregiving remains unclear. This study\ntested a hypothesized model which proposed that hours of care, stressful life events, social\nsupport, age and gender would predict caregivers' outcomes through perceived caregiver stress.\nDepression was expected to mediate the relationship between perceived stress and outcomes of\nchronic caregiving (physical function, self-esteem, and marital satisfaction).\nMethods: The sample for this secondary data analysis consisted of 236 and 271 subjects from the\nconstructed from the original study. Structural equation modeling was used to test the\nhypothesized model, and an exploratory structural modeling method, specification search, was\nused to develop a data-derived model. Cross-validation was used to verify the paths among\nvariables.\nResults: Hours of care, age, and gender predicted caregivers' outcomes directly or through\nperceived caregiver stress (p < .01). Depression mediated the relationship between perceived\nstress and psychological outcomes and explained 40% and 11% of the variance in self-esteem and\nmarital satisfaction, respectively.\nConclusion: Depression predicted psychological outcomes. Whether depression predicts\nphysical health outcomes needs to be further explored.\nBackground\nIt is estimated that 31\u00ad55% of caregivers of chronically ill\nelderly relatives experience depression [1], and depression\nis likely to be one of the first [2] and most enduring psy-\nchological outcomes for caregivers [3,4]. Caregivers'\ndepression scores have been found to be substantially\nhigher than those of the general population [1,5,6], and\nhigher levels of caregiving stress have been related to\ngreater depression [7,8] and to more depressive symp-\ntoms in caregivers [9].\nFactors that may be related to stress and depression in car-\negivers include hours of care, stressful life events, social\nsupport, age, and gender. Studies have found that hours of\ncare were significantly related to caregivers' anxiety/\ndepression and somatic symptoms [10,11], and to their\n\u00a9 2005 Tsai and Jirovec; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nemotional and physical strain [12]. Though stressful life\nevents have been associated with both psychological well-\nbeing [13,14] and physical symptoms among the general\npopulation [14], no studies have examined stressful life\nevents in combination with caregiving stress. Stressful life\nevents might have additional impact on caregivers' health\nother than chronic caregiving.\nSocial support may enhance the ability of the individual\nto cope with events or change the individual's cognitive\nappraisal of events [15]. Quayhagen and Quayhagen\nfound that caregivers who reported needing more social\nsupport had lower well-being scores than other caregivers\n[16]. In other studies, low social support predicted higher\nperceived burden [7], and adverse social contacts were\nassociated with increased stress [17].\nAge has been shown to have indirect effects on depression\nthrough its influence on perceived stress, the coping proc-\ness, and perceived efficacy [18]. Younger caregivers experi-\nence more distress than older caregivers [19,20], and they\nexpress more subjective burden than older caregivers [21].\nGender has also been shown to have effects on depres-\nsion. Female caregivers report more distress [1,22] and\nhigher psychiatric morbidity [5] than male caregivers.\nTsai et al. have suggested that stress and depression are\nemotional aspects of coping mechanisms and depression\nis the outcome of perceived caregiver stress [23]. Stress has\nin turn been shown to be the strongest predictor of\ndepression in caregivers [24]. Though depression has been\nassociated with caregivers' physical health [25,26], the\ndata on physical health are less consistent than on psycho-\nlogical health. Some studies have found that caregivers\nhad poorer self-reported health than non-caregivers [27-\n29], more chronic illnesses [30], and lower immune func-\ntion [31]; and they used more health care services and\ntook more prescriptions [27]. Convinsky et al. reported\nthat depression was associated with physical function\ndependence. Caregivers with functional dependence has\n2.53-fold chance to be depressed as compared to those\nwho with functional independence [32]. Other studies,\nhowever, have found that caregivers did not use more\nmedical services [33] or rate their physical health as less\nsatisfactory than the general population [6]. Further, as\nSchulz, Visintainer and Willamson point out, even though\nsome studies have suggested possible effects of caregiving\non physical health, the evidence is confounded by sam-\npling bias, inadequacy of measurements, and subjective\nAlthough the associations between depression and self-\nesteem and marital satisfaction have been examined\nextensively, only a few studies have been conducted in the\ncontext of caregiving. Caregivers have been shown to have\nlower self-esteem [35], and this has been associated with\ndepressive symptoms [10]. Caregivers who had higher\nself-esteem experienced less depression [36]. In one study,\ndepressed caregivers were more likely to experience less\nmarital satisfaction [37]. Also, high levels of marital con-\nflict were associated with high levels of depression in\nadult daughter caregivers [38]. Finally, spousal caregivers\nreporting low marital cohesion and satisfaction had more\ndepressive symptoms [39].\nA recently developed Theory of Caregiver Stress [23] based\non theoretical propositions from the Roy adaptation\nmodel [40] suggests that depression is the mediator\nbetween perceived stress and self-esteem and marital sat-\nisfaction. However, the relationships of depression to\nother outcomes of caregiving, such as physical function,\nself-esteem and marital satisfaction, remain unclear. The\nresearch reported here therefore explored these relation-\nships. We proposed that hours of care would be the pri-\nmary source of caregiver stress. Stressful life events, social\nsupport, age, and gender were antecedent variables and\nexpected to influence caregivers' outcomes through car-\negiver stress. Depression was conceptualized as a mediator\nbetween caregiver stress and other outcomes of chronic\ncaregiving (physical function, self-esteem, and marital sat-\nisfaction). Thus, a high level of stress was expected to lead\nto a high level of depression, which in turn would result\nin lower levels of physical function, self-esteem, and mar-\nital satisfaction.\nMethods\nSample\nData for the study were obtained from the Americans'\nlongitudinal data on subjects aged 25 years and over in\nthe continental United States. Individuals residing in\ngroup homes or institutions were not included. The sur-\nvey used multistage-stratified probability sampling, with\nBlacks and elderly (60 years and older) oversampled. We\nused Wave 2 data to test hypotheses and build a data-\nderived model. Wave 1 data were then used for model\nvalidation.\nOnly individuals with experience in caregiving to a chron-\nically ill aged relative were included in the analyses\nreported here. This reduced the number of cases available\ntwo samples were not completely independent because 99\ncases were included in both waves; therefore, to ensure the\nindependence of samples, these 99 cases were dropped\nfrom Wave 1. The final samples from Wave 1 and Wave 2\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMeasures\nSince the study was a secondary data analysis, indicators\nof the study variables (hours of care, age, gender, social\nsupport, stressful life events, perceived stress, depression,\nphysical function, self-esteem and marital satisfaction)\nwere selected from the Americans' Changing Lives Survey\nquestionnaires, based on face validity. That is, the ques-\ntions selected gave the appearance of measuring the con-\ntent of interest. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory\nfactor analysis, and internal consistency tests were then\nconducted to confirm the underlying structures of estab-\nlished scales and develop outcome measures for the cur-\nrent study.\nHours of care were the total hours estimated by the car-\negiver in the past year, categorized as less than 20 hours,\nhours or more. Providing more hours of care was expected\nto indicate more burden of caregiving.\nStressful life events were measured by a 12-item checklist\nof negative or undesirable events, such as being robbed or\nburglarized, losing a job, being physically attacked, or\nexperiencing the death of spouse, death of a parent, death\nof a close friend/relative, serious illness, life-threatening\nillness/accident, divorce/separation, serious financial\nproblem, death of children, and other such events.\nRespondents were asked to report whether they had expe-\nrienced any of these events within the past 2 years. A sim-\nple score, the stressful life events index, was created by\nsumming the number of events reported by each respond-\nent. A high score reflected more stressful life events.\nSocial support was measured by two items: friends/rela-\ntives' love and care, and their willingness to listen. Alphas\nrespectively. Higher scores indicated greater support from\nfriends/relatives. Demographic data included age, defined\nas the chronological age of the caregiver, and gender,\ncoded as biological sex identity.\nPerceived caregiver stress was measured by one item ask-\ning how much stress the caregiver felt about caring for or\narranging care for the elderly relative. Responses were on\na 5-point scale ranging from not stressful to very stressful;\na higher score reflected more perceived stress. Other stud-\nies have shown that stress was associated psychosocial\nwell-being, such as depression [42,43]; in this study the\ncorrelation between perceived caregiver stress and depres-\nDepression was measured by the 11-item Center for Epi-\ndemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale [44],\nwhich assesses mood and level of overall functioning in\nthe last 7 days. The CES-D was originally developed as a\n20-item unidimensional scale. The shorter 11-item CES-D\nversion contains items on feeling depressed, restless,\nhappy, lonely and sad; feeling that people dislike me; peo-\nple are unfriendly; I enjoy life (reverse scored); I have a\npoor appetite; cannot keep going; and everything is an\neffort. The items are rated on a 3-point scale from \"hardly\never\" to \"most of the time.\" Higher scores indicate higher\nlevels of depression. Based on exploratory factor analysis,\nthree factors of the CES-D scale \u00ad depressed and positive\nmood, somatic symptoms and interpersonal relations \u00ad\nwere identified as indicators of the latent variable,\ndepression\nPhysical function was defined as consisting of functional\nhealth, number of chronic illnesses, and self-rated health.\nFunctional health was measured by asking the caregiver\nwhether the caregiver was bedbound, and whether the car-\negiver had difficulty bathing, climbing stairs, walking, or\ndoing heavy housework, and the degree of difficulty of\nthese tasks. Higher scores reflected a higher level of phys-\nical function. The number of chronic illnesses was the\nsum of the following: arthritis or rheumatism, lung dis-\nease, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, circula-\ntion problems, stroke, fracture, and urinary incontinence.\nA low score on this measure indicated high physical func-\ntion. Self-rated health was measured by a single item that\nasked caregivers to rate their own health on a 4-point scale\nranging from poor to excellent. A high score reflected high\nphysical function.\nThe caregiver's self-esteem was measured by five items: \"I\ntake a positive attitude toward self,\" \"I am no good at all,\"\n\"I see myself as a failure,\" \"I have the feeling of being\npushed around in life,\" and \"I perceive myself able to\nsolve problems.\" These items were measured on a 4-point\nscale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. A\nhigher score indicated higher self-esteem.\nMarital satisfaction was also measured by five items:\n\"Overall satisfaction with relationship,\" \"love and affec-\ntion expressed from spouse or significant other,\" \"spouse\ntreats me well,\" \"thinking about divorce or separation,\"\nand \"things happened that I can never forget.\" Higher\nscores indicated more marital satisfaction.\nCronbach's alphas for all measures were above the accept-\nable criterion of .70 in both waves except for self-esteem\nin Wave 1. However, that measure was on the margin of\nacceptance, at .68. Since Cronbach's alpha is a conserva-\ntive estimate of internal consistency [45], the self-esteem\nindex was retained.\nAnalytic procedure\nUnivariate and bivariate analyses were used to examine\nthe descriptive findings. To test the appropriateness of the\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nindicators for each latent variable in both waves, the fol-\nlowing procedures were used. First, a single indicator was\nextracted when applicable (e.g., for social support, self-\nesteem, and marital satisfaction), and summary scale\nscores were used as single indicators. This strategy was\nused to reduce the number of parameter estimations in a\ncomplex model; it is considered appropriate when indi-\nvidual factor item loadings in a specific scale are high [46].\nSecond, for all latent variables with single indicators (i.e.,\nhours of care, stressful life events, social support, age, gen-\nder, perceived caregiver stress, self-esteem, and marital sat-\nisfaction), the measurements were assumed to be perfect\n(with 0% error). This conservative estimation was made\nsince increasing measurement errors would induce artifi-\ncial correlations among the latent variables in the meas-\nurement model. Thus, a full factorial loading of 1.0 was\nassumed for all single indicators in the subsequent latent\nvariables. For latent variables with multiple indicators\n(i.e., depression and physical health), one factor loading\nwas arbitrarily set to 1.0 to test the relative contribution of\nthe factors. Error variances were not allowed to correlate,\nbut all the latent variables were allowed to correlate with\neach other. The confirmatory factors analysis indicated\nthat all factor loadings were above 0.4 and significant (p <\n.01), and they accounted for at least 16% of the true score\nvariance [47]. The only exception was the \"interpersonal\"\nfactor in depression, with a factor loading of 0.39.\nAlthough it was slightly below the required value of 0.4, it\nwas included because it is a well established measure of\ndepression. The factor loading and measurement error for\neach indicator are shown in Table 1.\nA covariance matrix derived from data in the Wave 2 sam-\nple was analyzed as input data in the process of model\ntesting. Hypothesized models were tested using the maxi-\nmal likelihood procedure in the LISREL statistics program.\nThe model tests used absolute goodness-of-fit indices\n(Chi-square [2], the goodness-of-fit index [GFI], and the\nadjusted goodness-of-fit [AGFI]) and comparative fit indi-\nces (change in Chi-square [ 2], the relative noncentral\nindex [RNI] and the relative normed fit index [RNFI]).\nValues of GFI, AGFI, RNI, and RNFI between 0.90 and\n1.00 were considered to indicate a good fit between the\nmodel and the data [48].\nAn exploratory structural modeling method, specification\nsearch [49-51], was then used to develop the data-derived\nmodel for the Wave 2 sample. The specification search\nprocedure removed all invalid paths in the hypothesized\nmodel and added plausible paths suggested by the modi-\nfication index. Cross-validation was performed to verify\nthat this data-derived model was valid and stable across\nsamples. In this procedure, the data-derived model was\ncross-validated by the Wave 1 sample, with both Wave 1\nand Wave 2 data sets as input files at the same time.\nResults\nDescriptive findings\nThe characteristics of the two wave samples are summa-\nrized in Table 2.

Social support was predicted\nby gender and depression: males and depressed caregivers\ntended to have less social support. Being a female car-\negiver and giving more hours of care made the caregiver\nmore susceptible to perceived stress. Having less caregiver\nstress and fewer stressful life events reduced the chances of\ndepression. Older age and higher levels of depression\ntended to result in poorer physical function. Greater\ndepression was also associated with less self-esteem and\nless marital satisfaction. The data-derived model con-\nfirmed that perceived stress mediated the relationships\nbetween hours of care, gender, and depression, while\ndepression was the mediator between perceived stress and\nother outcome variables (physical function, self-esteem,\nand marital satisfaction).\nCross-validation\nIn order to test the robustness of the paths across the sam-\nples, the data-derived model was cross-validated by Wave\n1 sample. The results are summarized in Table 3. The val-\nidating process showed the data-derived model was not\nconfirmed only in Step 2 when the paths between\nendogenous variables were constrained (p < .01). This\nstep showed that some paths between endogenous varia-\nbles were not confirmed by Wave 1. To investigate the dif-\nferences between Wave 1 and Wave 2, especially in the\nBeta linkage, each path was examined individually. The\nresults showed that the differences came from the links\nbetween stressful life events and depression, and depres-\nsion and physical function. That is, the cross-validation\nprocedure confirmed that the data-derived model was sta-\nble across two waves of data, except in two paths (stressful\nThe data-derived model\nThe data-derived model\n?

These two paths need to be further examined.\nDiscussion\nThe hypothesized model postulated that hours of care\nwould be the most important factor in perceived caregiver\nstress, and other factors would include stressful life events,\nsocial support, age, and gender. Higher perceived car-\negiver stress was expected to result in more depression,\nwhich in turn would lead to poorer health function, lower\nself-esteem, and lower marital satisfaction. These expecta-\ntions were only partially supported by the data.\nThe data-derived model suggested that age had an indirect\neffect on perceived caregiver stress, through hours of care.\nStone et al. found that older caregivers tended to assume\nthe role of primary caregiver in attending to their chroni-\ncally ill relatives [28]. Thus, it is likely that the older car-\negivers in this sample assumed more hours of care than\nyoung caregivers, resulting in more caregiver stress.\nAge was also found to predict physical function. George\nand Gwyther noted that spouse caregivers were more sus-\nceptible to diminished physical function than other car-\negivers and this was probably caused by their older age\nStressful life events failed to predict perceived caregiver\nstress; instead, stressful life events predicted caregivers'\noutcomes through depression. One explanation for this\nmight be that stressful life events and caregiver stress work\nindependently in predicting caregivers' outcomes. One\nother study found that stressful life events did not influ-\nence health outcomes through perceived stress; rather,\nthey were a confounding factor in predicting health [52].\nAnd Stone et al. reported that stressful life events led\ndirectly to adverse health outcomes instead of being medi-\nated by perceived stress [53].\nHours of care and perceived caregiver stress were expected\nto play important roles in caregiver outcomes. However,\nwhile hours of care predicted caregiver stress, hours of care\nwas not the only nor the most important determining\nfactor. Further, perceived caregiver stress explained only a\nsmall amount of the variance in depression. This is con-\nsistent with Pruchno et al's finding that caregiving had lit-\ntle impact on depression or the physical health of the\ncaregiver [25]. The present findings support the view that\ncaregivers of chronically ill relatives adapt to the demands\nof the situation and stabilize or even improve over time\n[54]. It is possible that the chronic nature of the recipient's\nillness enables the caregiver to adjust to persistent needs\nand reestablish a balanced life over a period of providing\ncare. Viewed from this perspective, hours of care should\nnot be expected to have a major effect on perceived car-\negiver stress. It can also be argued that caregivers confront\nmany problems other than caregiving burden, and the\nimpact of chronic caregiving may be diluted by competing\ndaily stressors or stressful life events. Thus, the relation-\nship between hours of care and perceived caregiver stress\nmay not be as clear in long-term caregiving as in short-\nterm caregiving to an acutely ill relative.\nUnexpectedly, in this study social support had no impact\non perceived caregiver stress; but this is not unprece-\ndented: similar results were reported by Lawton et al. [8].\nWe used friend/relative positive support as the indicator\nof social support; however, some aspects of social support\nmay be more important than others in reducing caregiver\nTable 3: Summary of cross-validation for the data-derived model\nComparison to previous model\nSteps and Purpose 2 df p 2\ndiff\ndfdiff\np\nStep 0 Factor loadings, path coefficients, factor variance, and covariance\nwere all set to be inequality across group\nStep 2 Constrain factor loadings, and the paths between endogenous\nvariables (beta linkages)\nStep 3 Constrain factor loadings, the paths between endogenous variables\n(beta linkages), and the paths between exogenous variables and\nendogenous variables (gamma linkages)\nStep 5 Constrain factor loadings, path coefficients, error variance, and\nfactor variance\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nstress. It is also possible that the measure used here was\nnot sensitive enough to detect actual social support.\nResearch has shown that low social support makes people\nmore vulnerable to depression, and that has been clearly\ndemonstrated for the elderly [55-58]. However, in our\nstudy, depression predicted social support rather than the\nother way around. Depressed persons may withdraw from\nsome aspects of life, including their social network, espe-\ncially friends and non-nuclear family relatives.\nThe data-derived model showed that, as expected, depres-\nsion mediated the relationship between perceived\ncaregiver stress and self-esteem and marital satisfaction.\nHowever, the relationship between depression and\nphysical function was not confirmed by the cross-valida-\ntion. This is inconsistent with the findings of Pruchno et\nal. [25] and Zanetti et al. [26]. One possible explanation\nis that in this sample, depression and physical function\nmay both have been outcomes of important factors that\nwere not included in the study. Clearly, the relationship\nbetween depression and physical function needs to be fur-\nther examined.\nThe study was limited to the variables in the original\nAmericans' Changing Lives survey, constricting our\nchoices in operationalizing constructs. Further, the study\nwas cross-sectional and consequently was limited in test-\ning the causal relationships depicted in the model.\nAlthough the findings provide preliminary evidence of\ncausal relations among the variables, better examination\nof causality will require longitudinal data.\nConclusion\nIn spite of its limitations, the study shows the importance\nof psychological mediators in the care of a chronically ill\nrelative. The question of how caregivers manage to avoid\nadverse outcomes or why some caregivers are at risk for\nadverse outcomes can be answered in part by\nunderstanding the role of depression. Clearly, to avoid\nadverse outcomes, clinical interventions should target car-\negivers who are experiencing depression.\nList of abbreviations used\nAmericans' Changing Lives: ACL\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies Depression: CES-D\nThe goodness-of-fit index: GFI\nThe adjusted goodness-of-fit: AGF\nThe relative noncentral index: RNI\nThe relative normed fit index: RNFI\nDeclaration of competing interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing\ninterests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAuthor 1, PT, developed the research proposal, carried out\nthe data analysis, interpreted the data and participated in\nthe sequence alignment of the manuscript.
