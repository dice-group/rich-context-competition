The average age\nof respondents when they supplied infor-\nmation about their childhood experi-\nences was 55 to 57 years. As a result, it is\nhard to be certain, particularly from such\na remote vantage, whether it is these par-\nticular childhood experiences or unmea-\nsured covariates that are the most impor-\ntant predictors. In addition, the ACE\nStudy list of preventable childhood\nadversities omits certain domains judged\nby many developmental researchers to be\nimportant in predicting long-term health\nand well-being outcomes. Among the\npredictors missing from the ACE Study\nmodel are peer rejection, exposure to\nviolence outside the family, low socio-\neconomic status, and poor academic\nperformance.\nFor example, longitudinal studies show\nthat growing up in poverty increases life-\nlong risk for various negative life events\nand negative health outcomes.12-14 Peer re-\njection and lack of friends are associated\nwith the development of many disor-\nders.15-17 Poor school performance in child-\nhood is associated with poor outcomes in\nadulthood, such as unemployment.18 Wit-\nnessing community violence has been\nFor editorial comment\nAuthor Aff\nAgainst Ch\nCenter, Uni\nHampshire\nFinkelhor a\nShattuck);\nDepartmen\nUniversity\nSewanee, T\nHamby).\nAuthor Affiliations: Crimes\nAgainst Children Research\nCenter, University of New\nHampshire, Durham\n(Drs Finkelhor and Turner and\nMs Shattuck); and Psychology\nDepartment, Sewanee, the\nUniversity of the South,\nSewanee, Tennessee\n(Dr Hamby).\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association.

The NatSCEV was de-\nsigned to obtain incidence and prevalence estimates for a wide\nrange of childhood victimizations and other adversities. The\na nationally representative sample of 4549 children aged 0 to\n17 years living in the contiguous United States. Interviews with\nparents and youth were conducted over the telephone by the\nemployees of an experienced survey research firm.\nThe foundation of the design was a nationwide sampling\nframe of residential telephone numbers from which a sample\nof telephone households was drawn by random digit dialing.\nThis nationally representative cross section yielded 3053 of the\n4549 completed interviews. To ensure that the study included\na sizable proportion of racial/ethnic minorities and low-\nincome respondents for more accurate subgroup analyses, there\nwas also an oversampling of US telephone exchanges that had\na population of 70% or more of African American, Hispanic,\nor low-income households. This oversample yielded the re-\nmaining 1496 of the completed interviews. Sample weights were\ncalculated to adjust for differential probability of selection as-\nsociated with (1) study design, (2) demographic variations in\nnonresponse, and (3) variations in within-household eligibil-\nity. For this study, we analyzed a subsample of the entire sample\nwho were aged 10 to 17 years at the time of the interview and\nfor whom complete data were available on the variables of in-\nterest. Analyses in this study are weighted by the sample weights.\nPROCEDURE\nAshortinterviewwasconductedwithanadultcaregiver(usually\na parent) in each household to obtain family demographic infor-\nmation. One child was randomly selected from all eligible chil-\ndren living in a household by choosing the child with the most\nrecent birthday. If the selected child was aged 10 to 17 years, the\nmaintelephoneinterviewwasconductedwiththechild.Ifthechild\nwasyoungerthan10years,theinterviewwascompletedwiththe\ncaregiver.However,thecurrentanalysisisbasedonlyonthe2030\nyouth aged 10 to 17 years who provided self-report information.\nRespondentswerepaid$20fortheirparticipation.Theinterviews,\naveraging45minutesinbothwaves,wereconductedineitherEng-\nlishorSpanish.Allprocedureswereapprovedbytheinstitutional\nreview board at the University of New Hampshire.\nThe cooperation rate for the random digit dialing cross-\nsection portion of the survey was 71%, and the response rate\nwas 54%. The cooperation and response rates associated with\nthe smaller oversample were somewhat lower at 63% and 43%,\nrespectively. These are good rates by current survey research\nstandards.26-30 Although the potential for response bias re-\nmains an important consideration, several recent studies and\nour own analysis25 have shown no meaningful association be-\ntween response rates and response bias.31-34\nMEASUREMENT\nVictimization and Adversity\nThis survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victim-\nization Questionnaire, an inventory of childhood victimiza-\ntion.35-37 The Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire obtains re-\nports on 48 forms of youth victimization covering 5 general areas\nof interest: conventional crime, maltreatment, victimization by\npeer and siblings, sexual victimization, and witnessing and ex-\nposure to violence.38 The survey also contains questions about\nadverse life events in the parent interview section and in a sepa-\nrate section on adversity.\nFor the present study, which was not originally designed\nto test the ACE Study model, we selected victimization and ad-\nversity items in 2 steps. First, we used screener items and their\nassociated follow-up questions to construct victimization types\nthat most closely matched the abuse and neglect items in the\noriginal ACE Study, and we chose family background and ad-\nversity items to match the household dysfunction items of the\noriginal ACE Study. Using these items, we constructed a rep-\nlication of the original ACE Study. In the second step, we se-\nlected additional types of victimization and adversity items not\nincluded in the original ACE Study but that are known to be\nimportant correlates of health and well-being outcomes. The\nmeasures selected in these 2 steps are described in the next sec-\ntion of this article. Important differences from the ACE Study\nitems are noted in eTable 1 (http://www.jamapeds.com).\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nMeasures Used to Replicate\nOriginal ACE Study Items\nThe following measures were coded 0 for no and 1 for yes so\nthat they could be summed to create the replicated ACE Study\nitems. All are lifetime measures.\nv Emotional abuse: One item asked respondents, \"At any\ntime in your life, did you get scared or feel really bad because\ngrown-ups in your life called you names, said mean things to\nyou, or said they didn't want you?\"\nv Physical abuse: Several screeners assessed the child's ex-\nperience of physical assault. Children who answered yes to any\nof these assault screeners were coded as having experienced\nphysical abuse if the incident was perpetrated by parent, an adult\nrelative, or another adult caregiver.\nv Sexual abuse: Four screeners asked about the child's ex-\nperience of sexual assault or attempted rape by a known adult,\nan adult stranger, or a peer or sibling.\nv Emotional neglect: Four questions about family social sup-\nport were used to construct an indicator of emotional neglect.\nThese items are shown in eTable 1. Total scores ranged from 4\nto 16. Children whose family support score was 10 or lower\nwere coded as having experienced emotional neglect.\nv Physical neglect: A single item asked whether the child had\never experienced a time when adults in his or her life \"didn't take\ncareofthemthewaytheyshould,\"includingnotprovidingenough\nfood, not taking them to the doctor when they were sick, or not\nmaking sure they had a safe place to stay. Children who an-\nswered yes were coded as having experienced physical neglect.\nv Mother treated violently: Twelve screeners asked chil-\ndren whether they had witnessed specific kinds of violence and\nabuse. Children who answered yes to any of these questions\nand who reported that their mother was the victim were coded\n1 on this item.\nv Household substance abuse: A single item assessed whether\nthe child had a family member who \"drank or used drugs so\noften that it caused problems.\"\nv Household mental illness: Children who had a parent or\nsibling with depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, or \"other psy-\nchiatric disorder\" (information obtained from the parent in-\nterview) or children who had \"someone close\" attempt sui-\ncide were coded 1 on household mental illness.\nv Parental separation or divorce: We coded any respondent\nwho was not currently living with 2 biological or adoptive par-\nents as having experienced parental separation or divorce.\nv Incarcerated household member: One adversity item asks\nwhether a parent or guardian had ever been sent to prison.\nAdditional Victimization and Adversity Items\nNot Included in ACE Study\nThe measures listed herein, not included in the ACE Study, were\nexamined as additional correlates of children's distress. A sum-\nmary of these items is reported in eTable 2. Unless otherwise\nspecified, questions regarding these items were asked in the\nchild's portion of the interview:\nv Peer victimization (assault, physical intimidation, or emo-\ntional victimization by a nonsibling peer)\nv Parents always arguing (respondents were asked whether\nthere was a time in their lives when their parents were always\narguing)\nv Property victimization (experience of a robbery, theft, or\nvandalism by a nonsibling perpetrator)\nv Someone close to the child had a bad accident or illness\nv Exposure to community violence (6 screeners asked\nwhether the child had been exposed to certain types of crime\nand violence, including witnessing an assault, experiencing a\nhousehold theft, having someone close murdered, witnessing\na murder, experiencing a riot, or being in a war zone)\nv No good friends (child had no \"really good friends at\nschool\" at the time of the interview)\nv Below-average grades (parent reported that the child had\n\"below-average\" grades in school)\nv Someone close to the child died because of an accident\nor illness\nv Parent lost job (children reported that there was a time\nwhen their \"mother, father, or guardian lost a job or couldn't\nfind work\")\nv Parent deployed to war zone (parent had to leave the coun-\ntry to fight in a war and was gone for several months or longer)\nv Disaster (child had experienced a \"very bad fire, flood, tor-\nnado, hurricane, earthquake, or other disaster\")\nv Removed from family (child was \"sent or taken away from\nhis or her family for any reason\")\nv Very overweight (parent reported that the child was \"quite\na bit overweight\" compared with other boys/girls his or her age)\nv Physical disability (parent reported that the child had been\ndiagnosed with a \"physical health or medical problem that af-\nfects the kinds of activities that he or she can do\")\nv Ever involved in a bad accident\nv Neighborhood violence is a \"big problem\" (asked in the\nparent interview)\nv Homelessness (a time when the child's family \"had to live\non a street or in a shelter because they had no other place to stay\")\nv Repeated a grade\nv Less masculine or feminine than other boys or girls his\nor her age (asked in the parent interview)\nDistress Symptoms\nDistress symptoms were measured using shortened versions of\nthe anger, depression, anxiety, dissociation, and posttrau-\nmatic stress scales of the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Chil-\ndren (TSCC).39 Respondents were asked how often they had\nexperienced each symptom within the past month. Response\noptions were on a 4-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very\noften), and responses from the items of all 5 scales were summed\nto create a total distress score consisting of 28 items. The Cron-\nbach  value for total distress score in this study was 0.93.\nDemographics\nDemographic information was obtained in the initial parent in-\nterview, including the child's sex, age (in years), race/\nethnicity (coded into 4 groups: white non-Hispanic, black non-\nHispanic, other non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race),\nsocioeconomic status (SES), and place size of the child's town\nor city of residence. Socioeconomic status is a continuous com-\nposite score based on the sum of the standardized household\nincome and standardized parental educational level (for the par-\nent with the highest educational level) scores, which was then\nrestandardized. For our revised version of the ACE scale, we\ncreated a dummy indicator for low SES that flags children whose\ncontinuous SES value fell in the bottom, roughly 20%.\nRESULTS\nThe ACE scale constructed with variables from NatSCEV\nthat mimic the original items is associated with distress\nlevels among youth aged 10 to 17 years, as measured by\nthe Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children.

The cumula-\ntive items were strongly associated with distress, and there\nwas a clear dose-response relationship between the ad-\nversities and distress, as has been demonstrated in pre-\nvious research.1\nHowever, the original ACE scale items did not each\nmake an independent contribution to distress as illus-\ntrated in model 1 of Table 1. Two items, parental separa-\ntion or divorce and incarceration of a household mem-\nber, were not significant in the regression model of the\nwhole scale. In addition, when other childhood adversi-\nties (not considered in the ACE studies) were added to the\nmodel (model 2 of Table 1), several ACE scale items\ndroppedbelowsignificance.Moreover,severaloftheadded\nchildhood adversities showed strong associations with dis-\ntress. These included peer victimization, property victim-\nization, parents always arguing, having no good friends,\nhaving someone close with a bad illness or accident, SES,\nand exposure to community violence.\nA revised ACE scale was then constructed, removing\nthe original items that were no longer significant in the\nextended model. Significant new items were added to the\nscale, including parents always arguing, having no good\nfriends, having someone close with a bad illness or ac-\ncident, peer victimization, property victimization, and ex-\nposure to community violence. The old and new scales\nare contrasted in Table 2. Regression with the new scale\nsion of the scale.\nCOMMENT\nIn this study, it was possible to improve the value of the\noriginal ACE scale considerably by adding some child-\nhood adversities not included in the original scale and\nexcluding others that were in the scale. The value of add-\ning several items not considered in the ACE studies is\nconsistent with several publications showing their harm-\nful effect on child development. In fact, there are likely\neven more domains of childhood adversity that might be\nmeasured and added that could further improve its pre-\ndictive ability, for example, low IQ,40 parental death, and\nfood scarcity. The present study illustrates that the origi-\nnal ACE scale could likely be improved even more with\nadditional developmental research.\nHowever, this analysis also confirms that some of the\nkey ACE scale items, particularly the child maltreat-\nment exposures, remain very important and make dis-\ncrete independent contributions, even when many other\nadversities are considered. Moreover, several of the new\nTable 1.

First, this study did not operationalize the\nadverse childhood events in the same way that the origi-\nnal ACE instrument did. Second, the dependent vari-\nable, the TSCC, used in this exercise was not an out-\ncome used in the original ACE Study. The TSCC may be\nbetter associated with the impact of some childhood\nevents, such as violence exposure, than others and may\nnot necessarily be reflective of what would best predict\nlong-term health effects. In fact, some childhood adver-\nsities may affect later health not through psychological\nprocesses, such as distress symptoms, but through other\nmechanisms, for example, failure to receive proper early\nhealth care. Moreover, unlike the ACE Study, the out-\ncome measure was short term and the causal sequence\nbetween adversities and outcome cannot be assumed. All\nthe variables in this study come from self-report and, in\nmost cases, from children, which may be inaccurate and\nintroduce method associations.\nBefore additional work on the ACE scale is under-\ntaken, some important issues are worth discussing, even\nbeyond the findings of the current study. One issue con-\ncerns what the goal or best use of this or related scales\nshould be. One possible use for this kind of scale is as a\nrisk assessment tool with older adolescents or adults to\nhelp health care providers better understand who is most\nlikely to require services and treatment for health prob-\nlems. However, the goal for which the scale has been most\nwidely used to date is to advocate for and influence pre-\nvention policies by highlighting crucial developmental\nfactors that prevention programs should target to im-\nprove general health and reduce medical costs and so-\nIn many ways the first goal, risk assessment, is a much\neasier one to accomplish than the second, selection of pre-\nvention targets. To successfully satisfy the first goal, re-\nsearch has to find strong associations between risk indi-\ncators and later outcomes. The ACE scale seems clearly\nsuccessful at this. For the second goal, however, a good risk\nindicator is not sufficient. The indicator has to be a proven\ncausal contributor, which modified would make a differ-\nence. Much of the discussion about the ACE scale as-\nsumes that its items are causal contributors to the numer-\nous negative adult outcomes, but this may not be the case.\nWithout detailed longitudinal studies and the measure-\nment of many additional variables, it may be very diffi-\ncult to tease out whether, for example, it is household sub-\nstance abuse that affects later outcomes or some\nunmeasuredunderlyingparentalemotionalproblemorlack\nof self-control. Moreover, a very important, but difficult\nto test, alternative explanation for many of the ACE Study\nfindingsisthatinheritedgenesforhealthproblemsorsome\ntemperamental qualities create a spurious connection be-\ntween abuse and neglect by parents or other family con-\ntext variables and mental and physical health conditions\nin their offspring. If this were to be the case, it is possible,\nalthoughnotlikely,thatevenpreventingchildabusewould\nmake modest differences on health outcomes.\nThere are other problems with using an ACE scale even\nas a long-term risk assessment tool. One is that risk as-\nsessment has to factor in social changes regarding the fre-\nquency, norms, and impact of different experiences. For\nolder respondents who answered the original ACE Study\nquestionnaire, parental divorce may have been an un-\nusual and stigmatizing event and sexual abuse a hidden\nexperience that one never talked or heard anything about.\nAmong a younger cohort, more cultural awareness and\nthe increased availability of support, including profes-\nsional intervention, may mean that the experience of\nsexual abuse or parental divorce might have different con-\nsequences. This may be why parental divorce was not a\nsignificant predictor in the current study.\nAnother problem is the possibility of reverse causa-\ntion in which bad later life outcomes induce reports of\nmore negative early childhood experiences. There is some\nevidence that people recall more negative historical ad-\nversity when they have poor adult outcomes, mental\nhealth, and physical problems.45 To the degree that this\nis true, variables identified in later life, such as in the ACE\nStudy, will not prove as predictive of ultimate health out-\ncomes when assessed in earlier life stages.\nAn additional philosophical problem worth consid-\nering in discussions about the implications of ACE-type\nresearch is whether advocates should use a list of child-\nhood features that are associated with long-term health\neffects as the primary criterion of what childhood adver-\nsities to prioritize for prevention. For example, if sexual\nabuse were demonstrated to be minimally associated with\nlong-term health effects, would that disqualify it as a pri-\nority for primary prevention? No. Many childhood ad-\nversities are candidates for prevention not because they\ncreate long-term health risks but because they violate the\nrights of children or cause pain and suffering at the mo-\nment. Their contributions to long-term health can be ad-\nditional evidence to consider but may not be primary.\nSuch adversities illustrate the tension between a utilitar-\nian and human rights perspective in child welfare policy.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis research suggests that the goal of identifying child-\nhood adversities that are precursors to long-term health\nand behavioral outcomes may be improved by consid-\nering a wider range of adversities measured in a more con-\ntemporaneous way. Such an approach might be well ad-\nvanced by using longitudinal studies that have been\nmonitoring children into adulthood.12\nHowever, more discussion is needed about the goals\nand usefulness of such efforts. Although additional ef-\nforts to refine an adverse childhood experience check-\nlist that predicts later health outcomes has scientific merit,\nan argument can be made that enough is known about\ncertain harmful childhood experiences22 that more test-\ning of parts of this model should be carried out through\nexperiment rather than correlation. There is enough con-\nsensus that exposure to violence, sexual abuse, and emo-\ntional mistreatment are harmful and likely have long-\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association.
