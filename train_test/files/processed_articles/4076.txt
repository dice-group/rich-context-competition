    "abstract": "Abstract\nComparative studies have demonstrated that the themes for corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are different\namong nations and geographic regions based on their cultural, political, legal, social, and economic contexts. In this research,\nwhich was conducted on 56 corporations from IMI100 (100 Iranian companies with highest annual sales, ranked by Industrial\nManagement Institute or IMI),CSR themes in priority have been identified.Data collected from a semistructured questionnaire\nand some complementary interviews were analyzed against the results of a reference study over 100 companies from\ndeveloped countries.The resulted themes, some of which may have several subthemes, were developed in three economic,\nenvironmental, and social categories. Beside these qualitative findings, two indices are constructed for indicating the\n\"importance\" of and \"contribution\" to each theme. The results and discussions are supposed to help business leaders,\ninternational companies inside Iran, governmental authorities, and researchers to improve CSR discussions and practices in\nthe country where CSR undergoes a less structured platform.\n",

As\nan illustration, the measures that ICT giants in collaboration\nwith humanitarian organizations--such as NetHope--have\ntaken in Haiti earthquake (Greenhill, 2010) or more recently\nhave done in Pakistan flood (Brindley, 2010) are tokens of\nthe actions which exceed the common capabilities of gov-\nernments. However, social expectations from corporations\nhave risen considerably, as several studies have demonstrated\nthis fact--such as the evidences provided by Matten and Moon\nIn terms of social problems, corporations can act reac-\ntively, like what happens in the times of natural disasters;\nhowever, for an active or proactive approach, it is crucial to\ndetermine the adequate societal issues on which a company\nshould define CSR programs or apply CSR initiatives. This\nconcept, corporate social initiative (CSI), is defined by\nKotler and Lee (2005) as, \"Corporate social initiatives are\nmajor activities undertaken by a corporation to support social\ncauses and to fulfill commitments to corporate social respon-\nsibility\" (p. 3). The concept CSR Theme or CSR Issue has\nemerged as the core subject based on which a CSR program\nis defined. These expressions have been frequently used but\napparently always as a general concept. For a better clarifica-\ntion, here we define \"CSR theme/issue\" as a subject that\ncould be practiced by corporations to resolve a part of prob-\nlems a society is susceptible to or could be addressed through\ndiscourse, argument, or thought about how corporations can\nparticipate in resolving such problems.\nIn our terms, every social problem would be deemed as a\nCSR theme only when it has been addressed by a corpora-\ntion. That is, if a certain societal issue is out of the influence\nof corporations, it cannot be a CSR theme. Different organi-\nzations have different levels of influence over their operating\nenvironment due to the dispersal of the factors; a CSR theme\nis therefore a relative and contingent concept. Figure 1\ndepicts a model for this idea.\nThe sphere of influence varies among different corpora-\ntions. An issue that looks irremediable to a small company\nmight somehow fall inside the influence realms of a large\ncorporation. Of course it could be on a debate whether a\n1Tehran Industrial Management Institute, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nHadi Chapardar, 2080, B3 Tower, Mahestan Complex, Golestan Jonoobi St,\nEmail: chapardar@gmail.com\nIranian Corporations and Corporate\nSocial Responsibility:An Overview to\nAdoption of CSRThemes\nHadi Chapardar1 and Raveed Khanlari1\n Keywords\nCSR themes, CSR issues, Iran, national context, societal issues\n2 SAGE Open\nsocial problem falls inside the influence sphere of a corpora-\ntion or not. For a certain context, a variety of societal issues\ncould be assumed as the contextual CSR themes' base,\nalthough the borders of such a base might be sometimes\nvague, with loose interpretation.\n\"Contextuality\" of CSR\nIt has been long argued that every corporation in a specific\ncountry is under the influence of a prevailing institutional\nframework that has been formed during history--Whitley\n(1997), for instance, named it National Business System.\nCSR, therefore, is a contextual arena as some researchers\nhave demonstrated. To mention a few studies, Matten and\nMoon (2004) have discussed on the relationship between\nCSR and national contexts; Crane and Matten (2004) have\ndescribed a sheer interest in comparative CSR studies; con-\ntingency of CSR in national contexts has been argued by\nattempted to develop an index comparing national CSR prac-\ntices. Beside the increasing trend of these contextual and\ncomparative CSR studies, constraints such as the limited\nnumber of countries or regions included in the scope of\nresearch always inhibit academia and businesses from devel-\noping a general depiction of CSR practices.\nFurthermore,studies suchas thatofMcKinsey&Company\n(2007) demonstrated that business strategists in different\nparts of the world tend to concentrate on a wide range of soci-\netal issues. The themes that have been recognized or experi-\nenced in a specific region cannot be directly prescribed to the\nother regions. Such questions may immediately come to the\nmind of an individual: What societal issues shall be in focus\nin my country and which of them have been previously con-\nsidered as CSR themes? Moreover, what analogies and anom-\nalies can be found between these CSR themes and those of\nother nations or regions? Such questions have been addressed\nin an exploratory\u00addescriptive research in Iran and a main\npart of its results is being discussed here.\nSome Studies on CSR\nThemes:A Quick Glance\nA number of studies have been conducted on social themes\nwith a variety in scope, goals, respondents, methodology,\nand validity.\nMaignan and Ralston (2002) performed a comparative\nstudy between the United States and three European countries--\nthe United Kingdom, France, and Netherlands. With 50 large\ncompanies sampled from each country according to sales\nrevenue, this study is a website content analysis research.\nMaignan and Ralston's study is based on previous compara-\ntive studies such as that of Langlois and Schlegelmich (1990)\nand Bennett (1998). Developing the categorization of CSR\nby Danna Wood (1991), Maignan and Ralston organized\ntheir findings in three separate groups: motivating principles,\nCSR processes, and stakeholder driven. In terms of CSR\nthemes, the third group includes a few different issues related\nto the stakeholders who receive the main advantage of each\nof the issues. Because of the purpose of this study, just a\nlimited number of CSR themes have been identified in it.\nSilberhorn and Warren (2007) developed Maignan and\nRalston's (2002) framework in a comparative study between\n20 German and 20 British companies sampled through their\nturnover rankings. This study expanded the themes and\nshowed results such as increasing \"quality of life\" topics in\nboth countries and put more attention to \"arts and culture\"\ngroup in German corporations.\nBeside such attempts, a more developed categorization\nwas defined in 2004 by Athens University of Economics\nand Business in a project named CSR Quest. CSR Quest\nprovides a well-rounded classification of themes in three\n\"influence areas\": workplace, marketplace, and environ-\nment and society (CSR Quest, 2010). Each theme is then\nclassified into subthemes and they in turn could be devel-\noped further to sub-sub-themes. This elaborate classifica-\ntion, we believe, is among the best taxonomies; yet its\nsignificant coverage is apparently used in no empirical\nresearch. Consequently, for the purpose of our research\nwhich includes identification of themes and measurement\nof how much each of them has been practiced, this classi-\nfication was not applicable because there are no numeric\ndata available for comparison.\nAnumber of researches have also been conducted by profes-\nsional institutions such as BSR, a nonprofit organization which\nworks with its global network to develop sustainable business\nstrategies and solutions. In its research, BSR identifies seven\nprioritized themes (BSR, 2009). Other instances of studies by\nsimilar bodies include two categorizations of themes by CSR\nthemes in Indian companies with highest sales that was done in\nThe Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India\n(ASSOCHAM; Ahmad, 2009). Such researches conducted by\nprofessional institutions, in fact, have unknown validity because\nCSR Programs of a\nCorporation\nSocial\nProblems\nCSR Themes/\nCSR Issues\nFigure 1. Relationship between social problems, CSR themes,\nand CSR programs\nNote: CSR = corporate social responsibility.\nChapardar and Khanlari 3\ntheir methodologies have not been described or evaluated.\nHowever, other professional researches, such as a global survey\nundertaken by McKinsey & Company (2007) to assess the\nimpact of societal issues on business, provide some valuable\ninformation in this field.\nFinally, Ferguson and Popescu (2006) have conducted a\nresearch on 100 best corporate citizens from 16 countries\ncategorized in five distinct geographical groups. These coun-\ntries include the United States, the United Kingdom,Australia,\nCanada, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway,\nSweden, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and\nSwitzerland. In a part of their study, these two professors of\npublic relations found that the companies had practiced more\nthan 100 different types of CSR and sustainability programs,\nrepresented in three broad categories of (a) economic, (b)\nenvironmental, and (c) social initiatives. Although their\nstudy employed content analysis to survey the websites of\nthe companies, which is different from our methodology, we\nconsider it as a basis for our study because of its relatively\ngood coverage of the themes, its statistics for our compara-\ntive purpose, and its adequate scientific validity. We call this\ntaxonomy reference categorization and take it as a basis for\nour study.\nMethod and Research Process\nBased on its purposes,1 this research deploys a hybridized\napproach: A combination of qualitative and quantitative\nmethods to identify the CSR themes and measure the prior-\nity of each theme, and also the extent to which the Industrial\ntributed toward each of them. Both parts have been fulfilled\ncollectively through a semistructured questionnaire and some\ncomplementary interviews.\nThe research population primarily includes 100 top--in\nterms of annual sales--Iranian companies, each of which\nworks in a specific industry. However, it was predictable that\nit would never be possible to collect data from all these top\ncompanies. Conducting this type of research in large corpo-\nrations faces many obstacles (Wolff, 2004)--perhaps that is\nwhy website contents have been vastly used as the source\nof data in similar studies. In case of Iran, the obstacles seem\nmore preventive because of the factors such as extreme\nbureaucratic atmosphere of large corporations, reluctance to\nshare information with others, and scant attention to research\nactivities. Nonetheless, 56 companies took part in the research\nand this was more than the expectation. In all, 52% of these\ncompanies belonged to private sector--government has been\nalways dominant in Iranian business environment.\nCase sampling was the next step. To determine the impor-\ntance and priority of CSR themes, every single respondent\nfrom each corporation had to have a strategic position.Asenior\nor C-level manager who is best related to CSR activities might\nbe considered as the best. Still, in many of the surveyed com-\npanies, no specific department solely held the responsibilities\naround CSR. Whereas some corporations had established spe-\ncific units to implement CSR-related measures such as those\nrelated to ISO 14000 standards and EFQM Excellence Model,\nin other companies CSR activities were distributed among dif-\nferent departments. Discovering the right respondent in each\ncorporation was a major challenge. In all, 39% of the respon-\ndents were CEOs or other C-level managers, while 54% were\nmiddle managers relevant to CSR, and the 7% remained\nbelonging to the lower levels. And regarding the level of the\nrespondents' education, 57% of them held a PhD or a master's\ndegree.\nData Gathering and Analysis\nBased on the previous experiences in Iran, the best way to\nconvince corporations to contribute to a research is personal\nnetworks through which the accomplishment of the task\nwould tremendously be facilitated.\nThe main research tool was a semistructured questionnaire\n(appendix) that included both open-ended and closed\nquestions--to identify the most important societal issues and\nto quantify the contribution of the firm to each issue, respec-\ntively.Aflexible combination of different methods was applied\nto collect valid data. An initial telephone or face-to-face con-\nversation provided the required information and background\nfor contribution of the respondents. Still, the completed\nopen-ended questions in many cases were not precise enough\nto be coded and categorized to form a specific taxonomy of\nsocioenvironmental issues; hence, further telephone conver-\nsations were crucial.\nObviously, the degree to which companies had taken part\nin such CSR programs was not subjected to a close scrutiny\nand therefore the researchers tried not to let the desirability\nof the subject influence the validity of the results.\nRaw data were transferred to a database designed for this\npurpose. Each of the socioenvironmental issues had to be\nmapped onto one category--or sometimes more--in the \"ref-\nerence categorization.\" Predictably, part of these data could not\nbe mapped onto the reference categorization. These contextual\nissues had to be placed in new appropriate themes and sub-\nthemes in one of the major triple groups. The final categori-\nzation of the Iranian themes which was named developed\ncategorization is presented inTable 1 and will be described later.\nThe researchers repeated this \"coding\" process 3 times\nseparately while they checked and discussed about each\nother's results. This led to a better categorization; however,\nbecause of the conceptual nature of such taxonomies, this\ncould be as always debated. For instance, plenty of respon-\ndents had mentioned different issues around transportation,\ntraffic, and movement. Transportation on its own can be\nclassified based on different dimensions such as mode (air,\nrail, etc.) and function (passenger or freight). Such classifi-\ncations, however, cannot be directly applied in this research\nas it would not be an appropriate approach to bring all the\nraw data under the same umbrella.\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

(continued)\nDeveloping the Indices\nUsing descriptive statistics, we then developed and used two\nindices to score the CSR themes captured through the ques-\ntionnaires and interviews. The first index, \"importance,\"\nfocuses on the significance assumed for each theme; whereas\nthe second index, \"contribution,\" demonstrates the degree to\nwhich corporations entered on each theme in their CSR pro-\ngrams. The importance index for each issue is calculated\nbased on the number of references the respondents held as\nimportant as to be addressed within the society. That is, for\neach specific theme, number of times it was mentioned to\nthe total number of mentioning of all themes in its group was\nconsidered as its indicator of importance:\nThis index can be similarly calculated for the sub-\nthemes in a specific theme as well as the whole three\ngroups. Contribution index, however, is calculated based\non the number of the companies which implemented at\nleast one CSR program in a distinct group, theme, or sub-\ntheme:\nImpor\nt\nance ofeach CSR t\nheme =\nFr\nequency ofment\nions\nTot\nalf\nfr\nequency in t\nhe gr\noup\nCont\nr\nibut\nion in each CSR t\nheme =\nNumberofcompanies wit\nh a\nar\nel\nat\ned CSR pr\nogr\nam\nTot\nalnumberofcompanies\nThe contribution index is structured based on the number of\ncompanies to make it relatively comparable with the results\nof the reference research.\nThese two indices, together, provide adequate data to\nreach to an appropriate understanding of how different themes\nhave been considered and practiced in companies. Although\nsome themes look important, they might not have been prac-\nticed adequately by companies and this will reveal a \"CSR\ngap\" between the needs and the practices.\nResults and Discussion\nContextual Issues\nData gathered from the Iranian companies are organized in\nthree main groups as to be comparable with the results of\nthe reference categorization. Each group contains several\nthemes and probably subthemes, many of which are new to\nthe reference categorization. Table 1 represents the devel-\noped categorization.\nIn each group, it was necessary to add new themes to\ninclude the contextual findings such as \"unemployment\" in\neconomic group, \"promotional programs for environment\"\nin environmental group, and \"social values and behavioral\nissues\" in social group. Most of these added contextual\nthemes that were not present in the reference categorization\nbelong to the social group. These new themes may have new\n6 SAGE Open\nsubthemes as well. Similarly, based on our findings, some\nexistent themes also required adding one or more new sub-\nthemes to broaden the realm of its concept according to the\ndata gathered. For instance, in environmental group, respon-\ndents mentioned issues related to other kinds of pollution\nlike noise or wave pollution. Albeit, some of these important\nadded themes might have primarily been identified in the\nreference study too and Ferguson and Popescu (2006) should\nhave classified them into one of several \"other\" categories\nfor their scant magnitude. To sum up, whereas in reference\ncategorization, Ferguson and Popescu have classified their\nfindings in 21 themes and 20 subthemes, in our developed\ncategorization 31 themes and 47 subthemes have been listed,\nas shown in Table 1.\nWith regard to the previous discussion about the social\nproblems and CSR issues, in this research 10 social issues\nare identified as non-CSR theme since no Iranian company\nhad a CSR initiative for them. This includes five issues\nfrom the reference categorization and five identified social\nproblems from the Iranian context. That is, five issues of\nthe reference categorization were not mentioned by any\nIranian executive at all. These include \"programs prohibit-\ning business in countries with human rights violations\";\n\"environmental management programs beyond compli-\nance\"; \"environmental research, generally\"; \"antiracism/big-\notry\"; and \"genetics/testing.\" These were excluded from\nthe developed categorization as they found no application\nby the Iranian companies.\nIn addition, the other five issues were reportedly impor-\ntant social problems that were out of the sphere of influence\nof the researched companies. These five were considered as\n\"social problems\" and were removed from the list of CSR\nthemes as no company had an initiative to address them:\n\"prostitution,\" \"totalitarianism,\" \"interference of local people\nin corporate affairs,\" \"corruption,\" and \"social inequalities.\"\nImportance and Contribution in Groups\nAccording to the analyzed data, most of the themes that\nexecutives have mentioned as \"important\" for the society\nfall in the environmental group with a 47% rate of inclusion,\nwhile social group stands next with 42%. Only 11% of the\nthemes executives deemed important belong to economic\ngroup.\nFor contribution index, similarly, 87.5% of the Iranian\ncompanies have adopted at least one program for environ-\nmental issues, while their contributions to social and eco-\nnomic groups are less. Environmental regulations in the\ncountry underlie this meaningful attention of the companies:\nIn the absence of real social monitoring institutions, such as\nconsumer-related nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),\nthe companies are more inclined toward environmental pro-\ngrams for which legislations and awards are somewhat pres-\nent. More or less, governmental institutions inspect some\ndimensions of environmental protection, and certificates such\nas ISO 14000 are known in the society and can increase a\ncompany's reputation.\nIf we cautiously compare the results with the reference\nstudy, we find these results not so far from the international\ncompanies. Caveat is that for some differences in method-\nology exact comparison between the percentages is not\nrecommended.\nEconomicThemes\nSocioeconomic themes in studied companies were found\ntremendously different from that of reference study.\nUnemployment solely possessed 61% of importance for all\neconomic themes, which is a token for this pressing problem\nin Iran, especially if we note that this theme was not addressed\nby companies from developed countries in the reference\nstudy. That might come by the explanation that despite the\nprivatization program that Iran's government has followed\nduring the last two decades, Iran's economy is still govern-\nmentally centralized. In addition, international economic\nsanctions against Iran have worsened the condition by far;\nhence, job creation and real employment has been tragically\naffected during recent years.\nIn terms of contribution, 34% of companies claimed to\nhave participation in this field. \"Inflation/low income com-\npared with life costs\" acquired the second position in both\nindices. This theme has not been addressed in the reference\ncategorization, too. Table 1 shows that Iranian executives\nhave further worrisome thoughts on society's economic prob-\nlems than their counterparts in developed countries. That\nmight be considered as a natural outcome of being on the\npath of development.\nFigure 2. Contribution to each of the triple main groups in\ncomparison\nNote: Information of other countries adapted from Ferguson and Popescu\nChapardar and Khanlari 7\nEnvironmentalThemes\n\"Air/water/hazardous waste pollution\" and its subthemes\nstand prominently on the top of important environmental\nissues of Iran with 74% of referrals over all the mentioned\nthemes. Similarly, 84% of the studied companies announced\nthat they have made contribution toward this major problem.\nA cautious comparison with reference findings is interesting.\nIncrease of diseases, especially cancer, in the recent years\nmight have been the root of such a worry for access to clean\nair and water among the Iranian managers.\nOther themes such as \"preservation\" and \"environmental\neducation\" have been practiced less than international com-\npanies. This could be interpreted as a rather reactive behav-\nior than preventive approach. That is, in themes such as\n\"environmental education\" which are preventive measures\nfor a better future, Iranian companies have worked less than\ntheir international counterparts.\nSocialThemes\nThe most substantial difference was observed in social group\nwhere 6 themes and 22 subthemes were substituted with the\nrelatively minor-scaled categories of \"others\" in the refer-\nence study.\nAs shown in Figure 4, a considerable value is present for\n\"traffic and transportation\" over the importance index, over-\nwhelmingly far off the figures expected. It is one of the\nsignificant anomalies of CSR themes in Iranian context and\ninternational context, as in the reference categorization, this\ntheme is absolutely absent.\nThis finding seems natural; in fact, Tehran and other big\ncities are burdened with dense population, adding up the dif-\nficulty of moving people inside the cities. Finding a place to\npark your car in downtown of Tehran may take more than\n1 hr, in crude terms. In addition, poor public transportation\nleaves people with no option but to drive their own cars.\nAnnual death toll by car accidents stands higher than 24,000\n(JahanNews, 2009). Commercial transportation infrastruc-\nture is also poor. All these cramming factors bring on \"traffic\nand transportation\" to be a major issue. This theme grasped a\nhigh 30% share of all important social themes mentioned,\nspecific to Iran's big cities, with a growing population in\nurban regions. However, as depicted in Figure 5, only 36%\nof Iranian companies planned programs for it; this can hence\nbe considered as a CSR gap--this crucial issue stands in the\nFigure 3. Contribution to environmental themes in comparison\nNote: Information of other countries adapted from Ferguson and Popescu (2006).\n8 SAGE Open\nFigure 4. Importance of social themes in Iranian context\nFigure 5. Contribution to social themes in comparison\nNote: Information of other countries adapted from Ferguson and Popescu (2006).\nChapardar and Khanlari 9\nfourth place of contribution. Shockingly, \"car accidents\"\nwere neither ranked at the top rows in the importance index\nnor in the contribution. \"Parking lots,\" though appear to be a\npragmatic theme for CSR projects, has been given a share of\nnot more than 6% of the companies surveyed.\nThe findings for \"community program sponsorships\"\nplaced Iran not at a high level of the reference study's results\nwhen roughly and cautiously comparing the figures (Figure 6).\nIt should be considered that countries from reference study\nare all indexed with top figures at Organisation for Economic\nCo-Operation and Development (OECD) Social Indicators\n(OECD, 2009), whereas Iran could not reserve a better place\nthan in the Medium Human Development table (United\nNations Development Programme, 2010). As shown in\nFigure 6, Iranian companies did not get a better share of\n51.79%, which is at the minimum threshold of the developed\ncountries' contribution, and this shows a big gap for corpo-\nrate practices over this important issue. Themes like \"crime/\nsafety\" and \"antipoverty\" seem not only important to the\nwell-being of a society but also grasp the opportunity for\nrisk-avoiding expansion of the businesses over that commu-\nnity, and the contribution of the corporations surveyed were\nreportedly at low level.\nCombining the data from the reference study with this\nresearch in Figure 6, the contribution of different geographi-\ncal contexts toward \"community programs sponsorship\" can\nbe compared. Sponsoring the community programs among\nAmerican and western European companies is higher than\ntheir counterparts in Japan and Nordic countries as well as\nIranian companies. In search for the roots, based on the dis-\ncussions made by researchers such as Matten and Moon\ntems and institutions underlies such contextual differences. In\ncomparison with social systems governing Nordic countries,\nAmerican companies find more necessity to sponsor public\nprograms. However, it is shocking that in spite of enormous\nsocial needs in Iran, only about half of Iranian executives\nhave considered this CSR theme important. Subthemes such\nas \"employee volunteerism\" seem new to Iranian companies\nand the company executives have less sponsored or supported\ncommunity programs and voluntary works.\nAnother interesting result in this part is over the subthemes\nthat are not mentioned as \"important\" by any of the respon-\ndents but have a noticeable share of participation. \"Religious\ncauses/programs support,\" for instance, is a topic for which\nmany corporations, especially large ones, define year-round\nprograms. In summary, \"community programs\" is suggested\nas an essential subject for further researches in the context of\nIran's regime and nation's institutional structure. It is interest-\ning why a common and long-established way of practicing\nCSR is not finding its path to the business environment of\nIran with its old tradition of philanthropic activities.\nMany in Iran believe that contributing toward construc-\ntion of the schools has been a long tradition; especially in\ndeprived regions. Plenty of NGOs with such a mission have\nbeen always working in the country and it is said that about\n2009). Surprisingly, this fact does not find a path to the\nFigure 6. Contribution to \"community programs sponsorships\" in comparison\nNote: Information of other countries adapted from Ferguson and Popescu (2006).\ncorporate contributions in comparison with other countries\n(Figure 8). As Matten and Moon (2004) have discussed, the\nscant contribution of corporations in Nordic countries is not\nstrange as governmental institutions are efficiently playing\ntheir roles in this field. In Iranian context, it seems that a\ncombination of philanthropic measures by individuals and\nFigure 7.

Contribution to \"education programs or infrastructure\" in comparison\nNote: Information of other countries adapted from Ferguson and Popescu (2006).\nChapardar and Khanlari 11\nthe development of semigovernmental and private higher\neducation institutes have relieved the problem. This happens\nregardless to the fact that collaboration between academia\nand industries is not well defined: Design of the courses is\nnot in compliance with the corporations' needs.\nAnother social topic that draws attention is \"philanthropic\ncontributions\" where a divide between Iranian and interna-\ntional contributions is observed. This old type of CSR practic-\ning remains at a very low percentage while even other Persian\nGulf countries have apparently undergone this practice in\nexpanding their programs to a broader range of stakeholders\n(Ronnegard, 2009). That holds the hypothesis that indus-\ntries' relationships with NGOs operating in Iran are not\nfirmly established and businessmen are not conferring ideas\nwith these institutions for a tighter cooperation.\n\"Disaster/crisis/terrorism,\" surprisingly, has been\nremained out of the managers' sight. Iran, being reported by\nMaplecroft (2010) has reported Iran at the third place vul-\nnerable to natural disasters. Hence, beside the absolute\nnecessity for public policies regarding preventative and cor-\nrective actions for disasters, serious corporate involvement\nis required over this issue. CSR, here, would receive a\nstricter investigation if it gains attention as an effective tool\nfor progressing programs.\nNear 10% of all social issues were categorized in \"social\nvalues and behavioral issues\"--an important complicated\ntheme for a society in a long transition path from traditional-\nism to modernism.\nConclusion\nThe results of this study are not definitely intended to extend\nto any population other than the 56 studied companies; the\nresearchers, however, try to deploy their general understand-\ning of the Iranian context to show how different, or similar,\nCSR is perceived by the players of business environment in\nIran--a country which is mainly out of international researches\nabout CSR.\nIn addition, interpretation of such data might seem disput-\nable, for CSR has never been adequately addressed in Iranian\nbusiness and academic environment as a structured field or\nsystem. In spite of elaborate philanthropic traditions of\nentrepreneurs, CSR as a \"structured knowledge\" is still rela-\ntively new to Iran's business atmosphere. This study, yet,\nshows that in the absence of a strong CSR platform, Iranian\nsurveyed companies are not strangers to the CSR practices\nalthough they are unlinked to the international knowledge-\ngenerating events and bodies that occur and act around this\nstill-to-rationalize concept.\nGeneral Implications for Business community\nAs shown in Table 1 and other information provided, anoma-\nlies and analogies can be observed between Iranian themes\nand internationally addressed ones. The results of this study\ncan help business communities in several ways. First, busi-\nness leaders may find a number of CSR themes for their par-\nticipations which they might have not thought about yet.\nSecond, these leaders can also focus their CSR practices on\nmore important issues, especially those for which there is a\n\"CSR gap\" between \"importance\" and \"contribution.\"\nBesides, those Trans-National Corporations or Multi-National\nEnterprises (TNC/MNEs) which are active in Iran and obey\ntheir world\nwide CSR plans may also find these analogies and\nanomalies useful for undergoing their global measures in\ncompliance with contextual circumstances.\nThe significant differences between the CSR themes in\nIranian companies and those of International ones confirm\nthe agreed argument that CSR is a contextual subject. Themes\nsuch as \"programs prohibiting business in countries with\nhuman rights violations\" which have been addressed in inter-\nnational companies seem extremely faraway from Iranian\nbusiness atmosphere in which international collaborations are\nlimited and concepts such as TNC/MNEs, foreign markets,\nand globalization are not so common. Similarly, interna-\ntionally practiced themes such as \"antiracism/bigotry\" and\n\"genetics/testing\" were not mentioned or practiced by Iranian\nbusiness executives because in Iranian society, racism cannot\nbe assumed as a serious social problem; similarly, subjects\nsuch as genetics are mostly addressed by governmental insti-\ntutions in a limited scale; hence, neither is there a public\nawareness about the issue nor do these fall in the influence\nsphere of the companies. If one considers the isolation of\nIranian business in global business atmosphere in terms of\nsanctions and other political reasons, the issues that have not\nbeen practiced would become more meaningful.\nOn the contrary, through the surveyed Iranian corpora-\ntions, dozens of themes and subthemes were found that were\nnew to the reference study. Albeit, some of these added\nthemes have been found through other studies in countries\nwith similar contexts, such as in India where \"women entre-\npreneurship\" is an important CSR theme (Ahmad, 2009).\nIn economic group, though researchers have tried to con-\ntrol the respondents not to be slanted toward less-social-and-\nmore-economic issues, several themes were added to the\nreference categorization. The noticeable economic concerns\nof the executives seem natural if we consider serious eco-\nnomic problems in Iranian business climate in terms of\nemployment, privatization, economic growth, and ease of\ndoing business, especially during the recent years.\nPollution as a main concern surfaced in the environmental\ngroup--an old problem for which never a real treatment had\nbeen undergone in the country. Themes such as \"noise pollu-\ntion\" and \"wave pollution\" have been distinctly added to the\nreference themes and this reflects Iranian executives' con-\ncerns for escalation of different types of pollution. While\nnoise pollution has been oppressing residents of large cities\nfor decades, cell phone station antennas and satellite TV sig-\nnal jam for political purposes are new subjects of informal\nor even formal speculations.3 Mismanagement of natural\nresources is also a constant subject for a profound disputation\nby environmental activists and NGOs--two actors who are\nconceived of as intruders by authorities and sometimes\nacknowledged to deserve punitive actions.4\nThe prominent number of social themes added to the\nreference categorization can also be interpreted as a clue\nto various societal issues that Iran is involved in. Identified\nCSR themes are generally accepted as main societal issues,\nsuch as drug abuse. Having an overall view on the issues to\nwhich Iranian companies have more contribution, one can\nfind it interesting that majority of the actions are corrective/\nreactive measures; preventive measures like cultural initia-\ntives are less addressed by corporations. Furthermore, in\nsome cases, reactive programs such as disaster relief\nprograms should be bettered. With such a high risk for\nearthquake, a noticeable gap was observed between the\nimportance of and contribution to natural disasters among\nthe companies.\nTo sum up, anomalies should be interpreted just with con-\nsideration of contextual circumstances. As an illustration, no\nrespondent mentioned programs for music--maybe because\nof some religious restrictions which have been imposed on\nthis art after the Islamic revolution in 1979. In contrast, \"reli-\ngious causes/programs support\" have been addressed as an\nongoing practice while respondents made no mention of it in\nterms of importance. It is wonderful that business executives\nstrive for such a subject although they do not perceive it as\nan important subject.\nImplications for Government and Researchers\nGovernmental institutions can also find the results of this\nresearch applicable if they intend to revise the rules and regu-\nlations to stimulate societal activities of business units in a\nmore result-oriented platform. This, of course, needs further\nresearches on specific subjects to reach to more generalizable\nresults.\nBeside the CSR themes, five \"social problems\" were\nidentified for which no company had a program to address.\nThese, therefore, are not considered as \"CSR themes.\" This\nreveals a meaningful conclusion on the influence sphere of\nthe companies. Wide borders of problems such as \"prostitu-\ntion,\" \"totalitarianism,\" \"interference of local people in cor-\nporate affairs,\" \"corruption,\" and \"social inequalities\" seem\nout of reach of the companies and are mostly assumed as\ngovernment responsibility. Moreover, based on the religious\nroots of the Iranian government, problems such as prostitu-\ntion have always been dismissed and ignored by the authori-\nties who announce that there is no prostitution in Islamic\nIran. Such taboos are barely found not troublesome as a CSR\ntheme for companies. Furthermore, problems such as \"totali-\ntarianism\" directly refer to a sociopolitical attitude which\npoints the governance of the country. Regardless of how a\ncompany's executive have dared to mention such a problem\nin this research, and considering the overall political climate\nof the country, one may find it natural why such issues fall\nout of the scope of CSR initiatives adopted by companies.\nThis can be an interesting subject for further studies--how\ndoes the governance system of a country affects the CSR\nthemes addressed by companies?\nSuch differences in themes can be a clue to the necessity of\nestablishment of a more general taxonomy for CSR themes.\nAttempts such as the one performed in Athens University of\nEconomics and Business (CSR Quest, 2010) should be hailed;\nyet, this taxonomy lacks availability of experimental data.\nMany researchers still deploy their own system of categoriza-\ntion; hence, it is tough to use their results in other researches.\nMaybe it is a responsibility of international CSR institutions\nto develop a general taxonomy.\nAnd last but not least, studies on CSR themes and programs\nin many cases have been concentrated on what corporations\nhave addressed. Parallel studies to explore which CSR themes\nare deemed significant by other stakeholders, such as consumers\nand social experts, can actually deepen the view to the subject.\nAppendix\nQuestionnaire\nHereby we thank you in advance for the time you put to fill\nin this questionnaire.\nThe following questionnaire is designed to fulfill the pur-\npose of a research from Industrial Management Institute\n(IMI) in Tehran that measures how and to what level the\ncompanies listed in IMI100 have contributed to the social\nactivities.\nThe exigencies of corporate contributions to social activ-\nities and environmental initiatives have been much debated\nas a controversial issue during the current and for the last\ndecades; to some experts' viewpoint, corporations should\nregard all the stakeholders' benefit equally (no matter it is a\nshareholder, customer, employee, supplier, community,\ngovernment, or is from the other categories), so that social\nproblems--like illiteracy; human rights abuse or public\nhealth low practices, beside the environmental damages;\ndegradation; and destruction--will all inevitably be inte-\ngrated into the procedure of product and process design of\nthe company's core business activities, or, at least, into its\nside works. Conversely, some other thinkers believe that\ncorporations should be worried about society's well-being\nonly by solidly concentrating on business and accruing ben-\nefits (that will finally lead to an increased number of\nemployments) rather than directly contributing to social\nproblems which make them off the business road, their pri-\nmary responsibility.\nIn this research, we are looking forward a more robust\nrecognition of viewpoints of the managers from IMI top 100\nIranian companies and of their planned, or projected, pro-\ngrams in this area.
