Elevated CRP has also been prospectively\nassociated with increased mortality risk in a healthy elderly\npopulation (Jenny et al., 2007). Although the causal pro-\ncesses linking chronic inflammation to disease and mortal-\nity are not fully elucidated, CRP has emerged as an important\nmarker of disease risk in epidemiological research and in\nclinical research and practice (Pearson et al., 2003).\nDimensions of socioeconomic status (SES) are widely\nrecognized among social scientists as \"fundamental causes\"\nof disease that operate through more proximate contextual,\nbehavioral, and psychosocial pathways to shape individual\nhealth as well as disparities in population health (Link &\nPhelan, 1995). From this perspective, exposure to tradi-\ntional \"risk factors\" for disease like smoking, or a poor qual-\nity diet, is probabilistically linked to social and environmental\nconditions beyond the individual. Socioeconomic disparities\nrepresent \"risk regulators\" that lead to health disparities by\nshaping the distributions of risk factors for disease across\ntime and space (Glass & McAtee, 2006). In the context of\naging, research on cumulative inequality and cumulative\nadvantage or disadvantage has provided a theoretical frame-\nwork for studying the dynamic relationships among social\nand biological factors as they shape trajectories of health\nacross the life course (Dannefer, 2003; Ferraro & Shippee,\nincorporation of minimally invasive biological measures into\npopulation-based social science surveys (Lindau & McDade,\nnew opportunities for more comprehensive integrative ap-\nproaches to health research that draw on the complementary\nstrengths of the social and biomedical sciences.\nWe attempt to contribute to this effort by investigating\nthe determinants of CRP in a nationally representative\npopulation-based survey of aging and health.

Inflammation plays an important role in many chronic degenerative diseases associated with aging, and\nsocial, economic, and behavioral factors that contribute to inflammation may lead to differential burdens of morbidity and\nmortality in later life. This study examines socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity as predictors of C-reactive protein\n(CRP) among older adults in the United States and considers the degree to which health behaviors, medical conditions\nand medication use, and psychosocial factors account for these associations.\nMethods. Multiple linear regression analysis of survey data for 1,580 participants, 57\u00ad85 years of age, in a population-\nbased nationally representative sample of community-residing older adults in the United States.\nResults. Educational attainment, household wealth, and race/ethnicity were independently associated with CRP, with\nlimited evidence for interactions with age. Health-related behaviors and usage of medications related to inflammation\naccounted for substantial proportions of these associations.\nDiscussion. These results highlight the fundamental causes of inflammation among older adults and suggest pathways\nthrough which social disparities in inflammation may be reduced.\nKey Words: Aging--Health disparities--Inflammation--Social determinants of health.\nsocial stratification; and (c) to evaluate the extent to which\nhealth behaviors, medical conditions and medication use,\nand psychosocial factors account for social disparities in\nCRP concentration in later life.\nWe focus on education and household wealth as measures of\nSES based on prior work demonstrating their relevance to tra-\njectories of aging and health (Robert & House, 1996; Shuey &\nWillson, 2008), and we investigate race/ethnicity as a distinct\n(but likely correlated) dimension of social stratification with\ndramatic implications for health in our society, particularly\namong African Americans (Geronimus, Hicken, Keene, &\nevaluate interactions between age and these three measures of\nsocial stratification to explore whether social gradients in CRP\nstrengthen with age, as suggested by \"cumulative adversity\"\nand \"weathering\" approaches, or whether they weaken, as sug-\ngested by \"age-as-leveler\" approaches to understanding the\nrelationships among social adversity, aging, and health (Dupre,\n2007). We then consider a set of more proximate factors that\nlink social stratification and CRP in an effort to illuminate the\npathways that may contribute to health disparities later in life.\nMethods\nParticipants and Data Collection\nAnalyses are based on data from the National Social Life,\nHealth, and Aging Project (NSHAP; Lindau et al., 2007).\nBriefly, a national probability sample of community-residing\nadults 57\u00ad85 years of age was selected to study biological\nand physical function pathways through which social status\nand relationships influence later life health. Of 4,017 eligible\nIn-home interviews were conducted between July 2005 and\nMarch 2006, and a random five-sixths of respondents (N =\n2,494) were asked to provide a blood sample using a mini-\nmally invasive fingerstick method (McDade et al., 2007).\n(N = 57) had equipment problems or were otherwise unable\nto provide a sample (Williams & McDade, 2009). Of the\nlab and available for analysis. The protocol was approved by\nthe Institutional Review Boards of the University of Chicago\nand National Opinion Research Center; all respondents pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nVariables\nMeasures of SES and race/ethnicity.--Age at the time of\ninterview was calculated based on the date of birth provided\nby the respondent. Race/ethnicity was based on participant\nself-report, and for these analyses, participants were assigned\nto one of four categories: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic\nBlack, Hispanic, or other (small numbers of individuals from\nseveral groups precluded a finer level of analysis).\nEducational attainment was defined by five categories:\nless than high school, high school graduate/general education\ndiploma, some college/associates degree/vocational certifi-\ncate, undergraduate degree, and post undergraduate school.\nHousehold assets (net worth) were defined as ownership of\nproperty (e.g., home, rental property, car, businesses) and\nfinancial assets (e.g., savings accounts, stocks, bonds, pen-\nsions) after accounting for loans. Individuals were asked to\nprovide an approximate dollar amount. For \"don't know\"\nand \"refused\" responses, individuals were offered a series\nof bracketing questions to identify the range of assets.\nHealth behaviors.--We assessed waist circumference as\na summary measure of energy balance resulting from ha-\nbitual patterns of physical activity and diet. Waist circum-\nference was measured during the interview using a tape\nmeasure placed at the respondent's natural waist, midway\nbetween navel and bottom of ribcage. The distribution of\nnormal waist circumference is higher in men than in wom-\nen, and internally derived sex-specific waist circumference\nz-scores were used in the analysis (McCarthy Jarrett, Em-\nFrequency of physical activity was rated on a 5-point\nscale (0 = never to 4 = 3 or more times per week) in re-\nsponse to the question \"How often do you participate in\nphysical activity such as walking, dancing, gardening,\nphysical exercise or sports?\" Sleep quality was measured by\nself-reported frequency of feeling rested in the morning\n(4-point scale, 0 = never to 3 = most of the time). Cigarette\nsmoking status (never, former, or current) was based on\nself-report. Participants were also queried on whether they\never drink any alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, or\nliquor. In addition, we considered a measure of the cleanliness\nof the participant's home based on interviewer assessment.\nAt the end of the interview, the interviewer completed a\ndebriefing questionnaire, which included the following\nitem: \"Describe the room(s) in which the interview was\nconducted.\" Options ranged from clean = 1 to dirty = 5.\nWe included this variable because prior research has\nshown this question to be associated with health outcomes,\nincluding CRP (Dunifon, Duncan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2001;\nMcDade, \nMedical factors.--Current medical conditions were as-\nsessed by asking participants \"has a medical doctor ever\ntold you that you have any of the following conditions?\"\ndiabetes or high blood sugar; Alzheimer's disease or anoth-\ner form of dementia; arthritis; emphysema, chronic bronchi-\ntis or chronic obstructive lung disease; asthma; stroke,\ncerebrovascular accident, blood clot or bleeding in the brain,\ntransient ischemic attack, heart failure, or heart attack. In-\nterviewers directly observed participants' medications by\nasking to see all medications used \"on a regular schedule,\nlike every day or every week.\" Our analysis considers com-\nmonly used prescription and over-the-counter medications\nwith established effects on inflammation, categorized ac-\ncording to mechanism of action using Multum Drug Data-\nbase: Lexicon Plus version (Qato et al., 2008), as follows:\nstatins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), immunosuppres-\nsive agents (antipsoriatics, antihistamines, leukotriene modi-\nfiers, and mast cell stabilizers), glucocorticoids (steroidal\nanti-inflammatories and inhaled corticosteroids), sex hor-\nmones (estrogens, progestin, and sex hormone combina-\ntions),nonsteroidalanti-inflammatories(analgesics,analgesic\ncombinations, cox-2 inhibitors, miscellaneous analgesics,\nnarcotic analgesic combinations, and antirheumatics), and\ncoagulation modifiers (salicylates, 5-aminosalicylates, and\nantiplatelet agents).\nPsychosocial factors.--An 11-item short version of the\nCenter for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale was\nused as a measure of depression (Kohout, Berkman, Evans,\n& Cornoni-Huntley, 1993). A modified version of the sev-\nen-item anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and De-\npression Scale was used to assess anxiety levels (Snaith,\n2002). Perceived stress was assessed using a modified\nversion of the four-item Perceived Stress Scale (Pbert,\nDoerfler, & DeCosimo 1992). Marital status was based on\nthe response to the following question: \"Are you currently\nmarried, living with a partner, separated, divorced, wid-\nowed, or have you never been married?\" We recognize that\nmarital status is commonly considered a demographic fac-\ntor, but we included it with other psychosocial factors fol-\nlowing prior work evaluating relationship status and quality\nas psychosocial factors that influence immune function and\ninflammation in experimental settings (Kiecolt-Glaser\nMeasurement of CRP.--Details on the collection of dried\nblood spot samples and the analysis of CRP have been pre-\nsented elsewhere (Williams & McDade, 2009). Briefly, free\nflowing capillary blood was collected on filter paper com-\nmonly used for neonatal screening (#903; Schleicher &\nSchuell, Keene, NH). Samples were analyzed in the Lab-\noratory for Human Biology Research at Northwestern\nUniversity using a high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay\nprotocol previously developed for use with blood spots\n(McDade, Burhop, & Dohnal, 2004). Prior validation of as-\nsay performance indicates that the blood spot CRP method\nhas good sensitivity, precision, and reliability and a high\ncorrelation between matched plasma and blood spot sam-\nparticipants with blood samples available for testing, 1,939\n(95%) had usable CRP data (exclusions were primarily due\nto an insufficient volume of blood).\nData Analysis\nThe distribution of CRP was highly skewed and was there-\nfore log-transformed prior to analysis. In addition, because\nwe are using CRP as an indicator of chronic low-grade\ninflammation that may increase risk for cardiovascular\ndisease, we eliminated individuals with evidence of an\nacute inflammatory condition (e.g., infection). A recent\njoint scientific statement issued by the American Heart As-\nsociation and the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion recommends that plasma CRP concentrations more\nconversion formula based on prior comparison of matched\nplasma/blood spot samples (McDade et al., 2004), this\nplasma value corresponds to a blood spot CRP concentra-\ntion of 8.6 mg/L. We therefore removed individuals with\nblood spot CRP greater than 8.6 mg/L from our analyses\ndue to the likelihood that these high concentrations repre-\nsented acute inflammation.\nAnalyses proceeded in four stages using a series of linear\nregression models with log-transformed CRP concentration\nas the dependent variable. We first investigated the bivariate\nrelationships between CRP concentration and health behav-\niors, medical, and psychosocial factors. A p value <.05 was\nset as the criterion for statistical significance. Second, we\nconsidered models evaluating gender, race/ethnicity, and\nage as predictors of CRP (Model 1). We isolated these vari-\nables to evaluate whether associations were modified by the\ninclusion of education and assets. Third, we considered a\nmodel that included education, assets, race/ethnicity, gen-\nder, and age to document the extent to which disparities in\nCRP exist along these dimensions (Model 2). We also tested\nfor interactions between age and education, age and assets,\nas well as age and race/ethnicity. We considered separate\nyears) to aid interpretation if the interaction terms reached\nstatistical significance. Fourth, we examined health behav-\niors, medical, and psychosocial factors (found in the first\nstage) in a final model including education, assets, race/eth-\nnicity, gender, and age. We investigated whether these prox-\nimate factors accounted for social disparities in CRP by\nevaluating the degree to which they modified regression co-\nefficients for education, assets, and race/ethnicity in com-\nparison to the base model. Analyses accounted for the\nsampling strata and clustering, and weights were employed\nto adjust for differential probabilities of selection and dif-\nferential nonresponse. Standard errors were calculated us-\ning the linearization method (Binder, 1983). Statistical\nanalyses were conducted with Stata Version 10.0 (Stata-\nComplete sociodemographic and CRP data were avail-\npants with CRP >8.6 mg/L, resulting in an analytic sample\nof 1,580. The final model loses 35 observations due to miss-\ning values across different variables. The 35 participants not\nincluded in the final model did not differ from other partici-\npants with respect to CRP (p > .9), and results were very\nsimilar when these 35 observations were also excluded from\nthe models evaluated in Stages 1 through 3.\nResults\nThe weighted response rate for the NSHAP study was\nconsidered in our analyses are presented in Table 1. The\ndemographic characteristics of the subset of respondents\nwith complete sociodemographic and CRP data closely\nmatch those of respondents to the 2002 Current Popula-\ntion Survey (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003) as is true for the\nNSHAP sample overall (Lindau et al., 2007).

However, Blacks compared with Whites (odds ratio\n2.95, p < .01) and individuals with lower levels of educa-\ndue to acute elevations in CRP.\nCRP concentration was significantly higher in non-His-\npanic Black participants compared with Whites and among\nwomen compared with men (Table 2, Model 1). However,\nthese differences were substantially attenuated when educa-\ntion and assets were considered (Table 2, Model 2). Higher\neducational attainment was associated with reduced CRP.\nHigher levels of household assets were also associated with\nlower CRP, but this association was significant only for in-\nCompared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks\nhad marginally higher concentrations of CRP, and Hispan-\nics had significantly lower concentrations. There was no\nsignificant gender difference in CRP after controlling for\nother sociodemographic factors.\nWe found no evidence for significant interactions be-\ntween age and educational status (p = .57) or household as-\nsets (p = .18). However, associations between CRP and\nrace/ethnicity were significantly moderated by age (p <\n.01). In the youngest age group, a similar pattern in CRP\nacross race/ethnicity was seen as reported above, with\nhigher CRP among non-Hispanic blacks (B = 0.105, SE =\nSE = 0.069) compared with Whites. In the middle age\ngroup, the association between race/ethnicity and CRP was\nweaker (p = .07). In the oldest age group, differences in\nCRP concentrations across the racial/ethnic groups were\nfurther attenuated (p = .58).\nWe next investigated the extent to which associations be-\ntween CRP and social status were independent of health be-\nhaviors, psychosocial factors, and medical factors that\nbivariate analyses revealed as significant predictors of CRP in\nour sample (Table 2, full model).

The use of sex hormones and\nimmunosuppressive medications were associated with ele-\nvated CRP, whereas statin use predicted lower CRP. Physical\nactivity levels, sleep quality, alcohol use, history of heart fail-\nure or arthritis, depressive symptoms, and being married or\ncohabitating were significantly associated with CRP in bi-\nvariate analyses but not in the fully adjusted model. Remain-\ning behavioral, psychosocial, and medical factors were not\nsignificantly related to CRP in bivariate analyses.\nEducational status remained as a significant predictor of\nCRP in the fully adjusted model, although the strength of\nthis association was substantially reduced. The interaction\nbetween race/ethnicity and age was also statistically signifi-\ncant in the full model (p < .01). Level of assets was not a\nsignificant predictor of CRP after controlling for more\nproximate behavioral, psychosocial, and medical factors.\nDiscussion\nCRP is an important marker of morbidity and mortality\nrisk in older populations, and chronic inflammation may\nplay a role in contributing to social and economic gradi-\nents in a wide range of diseases. In this study, we find evi-\ndence for substantial social gradients in CRP in a nationally\nreflects personal traits related to organization and efficiency\nand that these traits promote health directly, or indirectly\nthrough their association with economic outcomes, as has\nbeen shown in prior research with the Panel Study of In-\ncome Dynamics (Dunifon et al., 2001). Alternatively, a less\ntidy home environment may contribute to chronic inflam-\nmation if it is associated with exposure to pollutants or in-\ncreases the frequency or intensity of pathogen exposure.\nPrior research has documented significant associations\namong seropositivity to common infectious agents, inflam-\nmation, and the development of cardiovascular disease\nfrom a cohort of women in Philippines indicate that a\nhousehold-based measure of pathogen exposure is an im-\nportant predictor of CRP (McDade et al., 2008).\nPsychosocial stressors have direct effects on multiple as-\npects of immune function and inflammation, and prior re-\nsearch has documented significant associations with CRP\nstrom & Miller, 2004). We find evidence for significant bi-\nvariate associations between CRP concentration and marital\nstatus and symptoms of depression, but these associations\nwere not significant in the fully adjusted model. Although\nthese results suggest that psychosocial factors do not play\nmajor roles in contributing to variation in CRP among older\nadults, the impact of psychosocial factors may operate in part\nthrough health behaviors. Smoking, for example, is more\nlikely for individuals under stress (Kouvonen, Kivimaki,\n\nVirtanen, Pentti, & Vahtera, 2005). Our attempts to isolate\nindependent associations between psychosocial factors and\nCRP thus represent a conservative test of their contribution\nto inflammation. Nonetheless, our results suggest that\n\nfuture population-based investigations into the psychosocial\ndeterminants of inflammation should consider a wide range\nof variables that may mediate associations with CRP.\nCRP levels have been found to increase with age for men\nand women, but findings are inconsistent (Hutchinson et al.,\nassociated with CRP for non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites\nbut positively associated with CRP for Hispanics. And in\ncontrast to prior research using other indicators of health\n(e.g., House, Lantz, & Herd, 2005), we find no evidence to\nsuggest that age modifies the association between CRP and\neducation or assets, with some evidence to suggest that age\nattenuates differences in CRP associated with race/ethnic-\nity. This pattern of results provides limited evidence in sup-\nport of the \"age-as-leveler\" hypothesis with respect to race/\nethnic differences in CRP, although the absence of a similar\npattern with education or assets cautions against overinter-\npretation. Rather, these results suggest that mortality selec-\ntion or cohort effects contribute to differences across age in\nour sample with respect to inflammation, and they under-\nscore the need for prospective data to identify individual\ntrajectories of aging, including how and why these trajecto-\nries differ across social groups.\nrepresentative cohort of older Americans: Educational sta-\ntus, assets, and race/ethnicity are all significant predictors\nof variation in CRP concentration. Education and race/eth-\nnicity are significant predictors of acute (>8.6 mg/L) as\nwell as chronic low-grade inflammation in our study.\nHealth-related behaviors and medication usage represent\nmore proximate predictors of CRP that account for sub-\nstantial portions of these associations. These results high-\nlight the fundamental causes of inflammation among older\nadults and suggest pathways through which social dispari-\nties in inflammation may be reduced. A better understand-\ning of the determinants of population variation in CRP\nmay be particularly important for guiding primary and\nsecondary prevention efforts to reduce later life risk for\ndiseases with an inflammatory component.\nOur results are consistent with several studies reporting\nsocioeconomic gradients in CRP, with higher concentra-\ntions of CRP found in groups with lower levels of education\nRanjit et al., 2007). Higher concentrations of CRP have also\nbeen consistently reported in African Americans compared\nwith EuropeanAmericans (McDade, Hawkley, & \nCacioppo,\nasset-based and race/ethnic differences in CRP, and sub-\nstantial portions of educational differences in CRP, can be\nexplained by behavioral and medical factors, suggesting\nthat differences in lifestyle associated with broader socio-\nstructural conditions are major contributors to social gradi-\nents in CRP. In particular, attenuation of the difference in\nCRP between non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites after adjust-\nment for SES indicates that reduced opportunities for edu-\ncation and wealth may represent important mechanisms\ncontributing to elevated CRP among non-Hispanic Blacks.\nAssociations with waist circumference and smoking\nare consistent with prior population-based research\n(\nMcDade et al., 2006). Waist circumference was a particularly\nstrong predictor of CRP, likely reflecting the importance\nof visceral adipose tissue as a source of proinflammatory\ncytokines, such as interleukin-6 (Lyon, Law, & Hsueh,\n2003). Few prior studies finding social disparities in CRP\nhave accounted comprehensively for medication use, an issue\nthat is likely to be particularly important when conducting\nresearch on inflammation among older adults (Qato et al.,\n2008). We included several commonly used drug classes\nwith mechanisms of action known to affect inflammation\ngenerally or CRP specifically. As has been previously re-\nported in younger samples, people using cholesterol-lowering\ndrugs, or statins, had significantly lower CRP concentra-\ntions (Jenkins et al., 2003). Exogenous sex hormone and\nimmunosuppressive drug use have also been associated\nwith higher CRP (Ridker, Hennekens, Buring, Kundsin, &\nIt is worth noting that household cleanliness was an inde-\npendent predictor of CRP. The significance of this associa-\ntion is not clear. One possibility is that household cleanliness\nA strength of this study is that we were able to evaluate a\ncomprehensive set of behavioral, medical, and psychosocial\npredictors of CRP in a large sample representative of older\nAmericans.Yet educational disparities in CRP remain unac-\ncounted for by these variables, drawing attention to the\nlimitations associated with the cross-sectional analysis of\na single CRP measure. Conditions early in life may also\nmake significant contributions to social gradients in inflam-\nmation: Recent research suggests that prenatal nutrition,\ngrowth in infancy, and infectious disease exposure in\n\ninfancy and childhood have long-term implications for\nthe regulation of inflammation and CRP production in\nadulthood (McDade, Kuzawa, Rutherford, & Adair, 2009;\nSattar et al., 2004). Nonetheless, our findings contribute to\na fuller understanding of inflammation as a physiological\nmechanism through which social factors contribute to dis-\nparities in health. Our focus on older adults complements\nprior research and further underscores the value of biosocial\napproaches to understanding the determinants of health\nacross the life course.\nFunding\nCenter on Aging Core on Biomeasures in Population-Based Health and\nConflict of Interest\nAll authors report no financial conflicts of interest.\n"
