    "reduced_content": "OBJECTIVE -- We examined the relationship between health-related social disengagements,\nas opposed to disengagements related to financial and other non\u00adhealth-related factors, and\nsubsequent risk of disability and death among initially nondisabled elderly diabetic patients\nenrolled in Medicare Managed Care plans.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We used data from the Medicare Health\nmail and telephone surveys, trained interviewers collected information on sociodemographic\nvariables, physical and mental health functioning (using Medical Outcomes Study Short\nForm-36 [SF-36]), activities of daily living (ADL), and medical conditions. This study reported\non diabetic subjects aged 65 years with no ADL disability at baseline (n  8,949). Health-\nrelated social disengagement (degree to which physical health or emotional problems interfere\nwith social activities) was derived from the social functioning subscale of SF-36 (range 0\u00ad100;\nhigher scores depicting better social functioning).\nRESULTS -- For each 10-point increase in social functioning score at baseline, older diabetic\nsubjects in our study experienced an 18% less chance of any ADL disability (odds ratio [OR]\n0.043) over a 2-year period, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, depression, and\ngeneral health (assessed by the SF-36).\nCONCLUSIONS -- Among initially nondisabled older diabetic subjects, health-related in-\nterferences with social activities at baseline may be early warning signs of subsequent ADL\ndisability and premature death, independent of other measures of health status.\nThe disablement process in patients\nwith diabetes involves several steps:\nprogressive accumulation of comor-\nbidities (such as stroke, heart attack, renal\nfailure, and limb amputations), physio-\nlogic and anatomic impairments (such as\nperipheral nerve dysfunction, peripheral\nartery disease, and visual impairment),\nand functional limitations (such as walk-\ning limitations and poor balance) (1\u00ad11).\nResearch on the disablement process has\ninfluenced current research and clinical\nefforts directed at reducing diabetes-\nrelated disability and mortality. For ex-\nample, data from the Diabetes Control\nand Complications Trial (DCCT) Re-\nsearch Group and the U.K. Prospective\nDiabetes Study (UKPDS) Group studies\nshowed that optimal control of blood\npressure, blood glucose levels, and lipid\nlevels significantly decreased the risks of\ndiabetic complications and diabetes-\nrelated disability (1,4).\nHowever, comorbidities secondary to\ndiabetes do not fully explain the relation-\nship between diabetes and disability\n(5,6,9). For instance, Gregg et al. (6), in a\nstudy of 527 women with diabetes aged\nof incident disability (inability to walk,\nclimb stairs, and perform household\nchores, among others) over a 12-year pe-\nriod, even after adjustments were made\nfor comorbidities (such as stroke and\nheart disease), visual impairments, func-\ntional status, and other potential con-\nfounders at baseline. These data suggest\nthat there may be other factors (such as\nsocial functioning and health percep-\ntions), in addition to the diabetic-related\ncomorbidities and impairments, which\nmight explain some of the variance in the\nassociation between diabetes and disabil-\nity.\nIn an effort to begin to understand the\nrole of psychosocial factors in individuals\nwith diabetes, a study of 343 patients with\ntype 2 diabetes found that the social im-\npact of diabetes, as well as renal function,\ndiet regimen, age, and smoking history,\nwere more closely associated with mortal-\nity than level of diabetes control as mea-\nsured by HbA1c\nand other measures of\ndiabetes care (9). Because diabetes-\nrelated pathologies, impairments, and\nfunctional limitations do not fully ac-\ncount for the variance in the association\nbetween diabetes and disability, it is pos-\nsible that the effect of physical and emo-\ntional health on social engagement may\nexplain some of the variance.\nSocial functioning or social engage-\nment (degree of participation in social ac-\ntivities) has been shown to be associated\nFor example, Glass et al.

Little is known about how health-\nrelated limitations on social activities\namong nondisabled older adults affect fu-\nture risk of disability and death (27). Spe-\ncifically, what is the relationship between\nhealth-related social disengagements, as\nopposed to disengagement related to fi-\nnancial and other non\u00adhealth-related fac-\ntors, and subsequent risk of disability and\ndeath among initially nondisabled elderly\ndiabetic patients?\nWe investigated the association be-\ntween self-report of health-related curtail-\nment of social activities and risk of\ndisability and death over a 2-year period\nin a large sample of older diabetic patients\nenrolled in Medicare Managed Care ser-\nvices. All subjects had no disability in ac-\ntivities of daily living (ADL) at baseline.\nWe chose to use the managed care data to\nminimize the confounding effect of access\nto medications and other healthcare ser-\nvices on quality of diabetes care.\nWe hypothesized that, among older\ndiabetic subjects who were initially non-\nADL disabled, those with better social\nfunctioning (lower health-related social\ndisengagement at baseline using Medical\nwould have lower risk of ADL disability\nand better survival than those with poor\nsocial functioning (high health-related so-\ncial disengagement) over a 2-year period,\nadjusting for relevant social demographic\nfactors, general health status (assessed by\nthe SF-36), and comorbidities.\nMETHODS -- Data are from the Med-\nicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS), a\nlongitudinal cohort mail and telephone\nsurvey of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled\nin MedicareChoice (managed care)\nplans in the U.S. Medicare HOS was spon-\nsored by Health Care Finance Adminis-\ntration (currently the Center for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services [CMS]) and devel-\noped by National Committee for Quality\nAssurance (NCQA), a body responsible\nfor accreditation of managed care plans.\nThe Medicare HOS was designed to better\nevaluate care quality by incorporating key\nhealth outcome measures outlined in the\nHealth Plan Employer Data and Informa-\nAnnual participation of Medicare\nManaged Care Organizations in the HOS\nAll Medicare managed plan enrollees,\nwho have been continuously enrolled for\nat least 6 months, were eligible for sam-\npling, except those who were on Medicare\nas a result of end-stage renal disease. For\nbaseline survey, in managed care plans\nwith more than 1,000 enrollees, the sur-\nvey instruments were given to a random\nplans with 1,000 enrollees or fewer, the\nsurveys were conducted for all eligible\nsubjects. A full description of the Medi-\ncare HOS, rationale, methods, survey de-\nsign, sample selection, and respondents'\ncharacteristics can be found elsewhere\nFor the 2-year follow-up survey in\n2000, subjects were restricted to enrollees\nparticipating at baseline survey who were\nstill alive and enrolled in the original\nmanaged care plan. We used an analytic\ndata file from the Medicare HOS Cohort\nFollow-Up survey 2 years later. Because\nmany managed care organizations dis-\ncontinued or consolidated their health\nlytic data at the 2-year follow-up com-\nprised 188 managed care markets and\nThe NCQA-accredited HOS inter-\nviewers used standardized question-\nnaires, survey letters, and follow-up\ntelephone calls (as outlined in the HEDIS\nprotocol, including a Spanish language\nversion) to collect information on several\nvariables including physical and mental\nhealth functioning using SF-36 and ADL\nimpairments using specific symptoms re-\nlated to various organs, presence of\nchronic medical conditions, measure of\npain, cancer treatment, smoking, and\nself-rated health and sociodemographic\nvariables.\nThis study reported on diabetic sub-\njects aged 65 years with no ADL disabil-\nexcluding 155 subjects with incomplete\ndata on baseline social functioning, 8,794\nsubjects were analyzed for the outcome of\ndeath. Due to missing data on social func-\ntioning (n  53) and ADL (n  3), our\nfinal sample (n  5,232) for the ADL anal-\nysis comprised those subjects who com-\npleted the 2-year follow-up interviews\nand who had complete data on baseline\nsocial functioning and follow-up ADL.\nCauses of nonparticipation at the 2-year\nfollow-up surveys were disenrollment\nor inability to contact (n  700). Forty-\nseven subjects with no available data were\ncoded in the Analytic Database as \"in-\nvalid.\" The characteristics between the\nsubjects who completed the 2-year fol-\nlow-up and the subjects who dropped out\nfrom follow-up were compared. There\nwas no significant difference in social\nfunctioning scores between the two\ngroups. However, the higher dropout\nrates were found among nonwhites, sub-\njects with depression, and subjects with\ncancers and chronic obstructive pulmo-\nnary disease (COPD).\nDiagnosis of diabetes and other co-\nmorbidities were by self-report. We used\ninformation on relevant sociodemo-\ngraphic variables, chronic medical condi-\ntions, social functioning component of\nSF-36 and other variables at baseline, and\ndata on ADL and mortality at the 2-year\nfollow-up interview (2000), as contained\nin the Cohort 1 Analytic Public Use File\npublished by CMS, Health Services Advi-\nstrument used to assess health status and\nhealth-related quality of life (32,33). The\nSF-36 survey instrument (the whole in-\nstrument or its subscales) is among the\nmost frequently used health status mea-\nsures in studies of older adults (31\u00ad35). It\nKuo and Associates\nhas two summary scales, the Physical\nComponent Summary and the Mental\nComponent Summary, which were de-\nrived from eight subscales: physical func-\ntioning, role-physical, bodily pain,\ngeneral health, vitality, social functioning,\nrole-emotional, and mental health.\nSocial functioning subscale. The social\nderived from responses to two questions\nsuch as, \"During the past 4 weeks, to what\nextent has your physical health or emo-\ntional problems interfered with your nor-\nmal social activities?\" (responses range\nfrom not at all to slightly, moderately,\nquite a bit, and extremely) and \"During\nthe past 4 weeks, how much of the time\nhas your physical health or emotional\nproblems interfered with your social ac-\ntivities?\" (responses range from all, most,\nsome, a little, to none of the time). Lower\nscores on any or all of the scales indicate\npoorer health functioning. Standardized\nscores on SF-36 for the U.S. population\nare used in most studies to calculate a nor-\nmalized score. A score of 50 represents\nthe national average for the summary\nscores and for the subscales. A score that\nis 10 points above or below the mean\nscore of 50 represents a difference of 1 SD\nfrom the national average.\nADL scale. There were six ADL ques-\ntions in the Medicare HOS. These in-\ncluded walking, bathing, dressing, eating,\ngetting in or out of chairs, and using the\ntoilet. Respondents were asked to indicate\nwhether they could perform these activi-\nties without help, if they needed help, or if\nthey were unable to do them. \"No disabil-\nity\" was defined as needing no help, and\n\"any disability\" was defined as needing\nhelp with or unable to perform one or\nmore of the six ADL.\nDeath. The indicator of decease (without\nthe specific date of death) at the 2-year\nCohort 1 Analytic Public Use File pub-\nlished by CMS, Health Services Advisory\nCovariates\nFactors potentially associated with dis-\nability and mortality among individuals\nwith diabetes include sociodemographic\nvariables (age, sex, ethnicity, marital sta-\ntus, years of formal education, smoking\nstatus), comorbidities (hypertension, an-\ngina or coronary artery disease, myocar-\ndial infarction, stroke, COPD, arthritis,\ncancer), and history of depressive symp-\ntomatology, assessed by a positive screen\non a depression questionnaire (36). Posi-\ntive depression screen was assessed by an\naffirmative answer to any of the following\nquestions: 1) \"In the past year, have you\nhad 2 weeks or more during which you\nfelt sad, blue, or depressed, or when you\nlost interest or pleasure in things that you\nusually cared about or enjoyed?\"; 2) \"In\nthe past year, have you felt depressed or\nsad much of the time?\"; 3) \"Have you ever\nhad 2 years or more in your life when you\nfelt depressed or sad most days, even if\nyou felt okay sometimes?\"\nStatistical analysis\nWe examined demographic and health\nfactors for diabetic subjects, stratified by\nADL disability and death at 2-year follow-\nup, using descriptive and t tests for con-\ntinuous variables and contingency tables\n(2) for categorical variables. Two logistic\nregression models were used to predict\nthe risk of ADL disability and death. The\nfirst model is unadjusted; the second\nmodel added covariates that were signifi-\ncantly associated with ADL limitation or\ndeath in the bivariate analyses, i.e., age,\nsex, marital status, smoking status, de-\npression, comorbidities, and general\nhealth from SF-36. All analyses were esti-\nmated using the SAS System for Win-\ndows, version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,\nNC).\nRESULTS -- Descriptive demographic\nand health factors for initially nondis-\nabled older diabetic subjects, stratified by\nincident ADL disability and death at\n2-year follow-up, are shown in Table 1.\nSignificant bivariate correlates of ADL dis-\nability and death among older diabetic\nsubjects included older age, being unmar-\nried, depression, history of myocardial in-\nfarction and other heart condition, stroke,\nCOPD, arthritis of hip or knee, cancer,\nand increasing number of comorbidities.\nEthnicity was not significantly associated\nwith ADL disability or mortality.\nThe difference in baseline social func-\ntioning scores according to ADL disability\nand death were also analyzed (data not\nshown). Baseline social functioning\nscores were significantly lower among the\ndisabled and the deceased (mean  SD,\nTable 2 shows, in the unadjusted\nmodel (model 1), a significant association\nbetween higher scores on social function-\ning measures (as a continuous variable)\nand increased risk of ADL disability at the\nadjustments were made for age, sex, mar-\nital status, smoking, myocardial infarc-\ntion and other heart conditions, stroke,\nCOPD, arthritis, cancer, depression, and\ngeneral health of the SF-36 (model 2), in-\ncreasing social functioning scores were\nstill predictive of lower odds of ADL dis-\nability at the 2-year follow-up. For each\n10-point increase in social functioning\nscore at baseline, older diabetic subjects\nin our study experienced 18% lower risk\nof any ADL disability (odds ratio [OR]\nThe results of two logistic regression\nanalyses predicting the risk of death are\nalso shown in Table 2. In model 1, in-\ncreasing scores on social functioning mea-\nsures at baseline were significantly\nassociated with decreased odds of death\n(P  0.001). With full adjustment for age,\nsex, marital status, education, depression,\ncomorbidities, and general health (model\n2), better social functioning at baseline\nwas associated with decreased risk of\n2-year mortality.

There was\na stepwise decrease in the risk of future\nADL disability and death with better\nscores on social functioning at baseline,\nsuch that with each 10-point increase in\nsocial functioning score (less health-\nrelated social disengagement), older dia-\nbetic subjects in our study experienced\n18% lower risk of any ADL disability and\n12% lower risk of death over 2 years of\nfollow-up.\nPrior research has reported on associ-\nations between lower level of social activ-\nSocial disengagement, disability, and death\nTable 1--Characteristics of mortality and incident ADL disability among older diabetic patients without any ADL disability at baseline\nCharacteristic\nNumber of subjects\nat baseline\nDeath at 2 years\nfollow-up (%)*\nNumber of subjects\nat follow-up\nADL disability at\nfollow-up (%)*\nAge (years)\nSex\nEthnicity\nEducation (completed grade)\nMarital status\nSmoking status\nDepression\nComorbidities\nHypertension\nAngina or coronary artery disease\nMyocardial infarction\nOther heart condition\nStroke\nCOPD\nArthritis of hip or knee\nArthritis of hand or wrist\nCancer\nNumber of comorbidities\nData are n or %. *Percentages in bold indicate significant group differences at P  0.05.

Variable was not significantly associated with outcome in bivariate analysis\nand was not included in the multivariate models.\nSocial disengagement, disability, and death\nities and increased risk of disability and\nample, data from the New Haven Estab-\nlished Populations for Epidemiologic\nStudy of the Elderly showed that in-\ncreased participation in social activities\n(such as visits to theaters, game playing,\nshopping, and church attendance, among\nothers) was associated with lower risk of\nphysical disability (19). Similarly, Len-\nnartsson et al. (16), using data from the\nSwedish Panel Study of Living Conditions\nof the Oldest Old, showed that increased\nparticipation in social activities was asso-\nciated with reduced risk of death at 4-year\nfollow-up, adjusting for health variables\nand other relevant confounders. Our re-\nsults extend these studies to older initially\nnondisabled individuals with diabetes\nacross the U.S. by showing that health-\nrelated social disengagements are associ-\nated with higher risk of subsequent\ndisability and death, adjusting for rele-\nvant confounders. In other words, among\nelderly diabetic subjects with no self-\nreported ADL disability, a decrease in so-\ncial activities might be a forerunner of\nsubsequent loss of independent living\nand premature death.\nThe mechanism for the association of\nparticipation in social activities with\nlower disability and mortality is not clear.\nPast studies suggested that engagement in\nsocial activities might be associated with\nseveral factors, including an optimal\nsense of self-competence and self-\nefficacy, slower cognitive decline, and an\nimproved blood markers of immune and\nstress response, factors known to improve\nthe odds for disability-free survival (38\u00ad\n41). Our study included no data on mea-\nsures of self-efficacy, blood markers, and\nother factors to explore these factors as\npossible mediators for the link between\nhealth-related social disengagement and\nour outcome measures.\nOn the other hand, it is possible that\ndecreasing participation in social activ-\nities by nondisabled individuals with\ndiabetes is a marker for severity of comor-\nbidity, not just mere presence of a disease.\nTherefore, an unrecognized medical con-\ndition (i.e., subclinical stroke or sub-\nclinical depression) might be causing a\ndecrease in both the ability (and the mo-\ntivation) to engage in social activities and\nthe ability to perform ADL. In that sce-\nnario, the decrease in social activities is\ncaptured much earlier by assessing pa-\ntients' responses to social functioning\nquestions during a period when the sub-\njects reported no ADL disability. How-\never, over a 2-year follow-up period, with\nprogressive decrease in level of social ac-\ntivities (with potential loss of the known\nhealth benefits of participation in social\nactivities) as well as the persistence of the\nunrecognized condition, deficits in ADL\nperformance accumulate, leading to\nphysical disability, loss of independence,\nand death. We have no direct evidence in\nour study that incident ADL disability\n(and death) at follow-up is due to stroke\nor any specific medical condition that can\npotentially lead to decrease in participa-\ntion in social activities and ADL ability.\nDue to lack of data in our study on sever-\nity of diabetes (such as HbA1c\nlevel), we\nare not able to determine whether health-\nrelated interference with social activities\nis a marker for poor diabetes control\namong older diabetic patients with no\nself-reported ADL disability.\nOur findings seem to indicate that\neven when no ADL disability is clinically\nevident, patients start, perhaps at an early\npresymptomatic stage of disablement, to\nadjust their levels of social activities in re-\nsponse to their perceptions of physical\nand emotional disturbances. Therefore,\ninquiry about status of social activities in\nolder diabetic subjects by clinicians is one\nway to identify individuals who will ben-\nefit most from interventions to stem the\nfuture loss of independence.\nThis study has some limitations. First,\nthe diagnosis of diabetes and comorbidi-\nties were by self-report. However, prior\nresearch showed good agreement be-\ntween self-reported diabetes and diabetes\ntheless, it is conceivable that subjects\nmight under-report comorbidities (such\nas peripheral artery disease and periph-\neral neuropathy), partly because of un-\nderdiagnosis and misattribution to aging.\nIt is also possible that, due to diabetes-\nrelated nerve damage, the prevalence of\nself-reported angina could be underesti-\nmated. Second, we did not include data\non adherence to medication and duration\nof diabetes, factors known to impact dia-\nbetes-related morbidity and mortality (1\u00ad\n4). Medicare managed plan enrollees\nreceive coverage for drugs, and this im-\nproved access should minimize the im-\npact of differences in medication\navailability on our outcomes. Third, the\nMedicare HOS database has no detailed\ninformation on types and frequency of so-\ncial activities. Fourth, the results of the\nassociation between health-related social\ndisengagement and ADL disability might\nonly be generalized to the diabetes popu-\nlation without severe chronic comorbidi-\nties of cancer and COPD, among others.\nAnother limitation of our study is our\nuse of unweighted analyses, which do not\naccount for potential intraclass correla-\ntion within health plans. However, to ex-\nplore potential effects of selection and\nnonresponse, Hwang et al. (44), using a\nweighted scheme to adjust for selection\nand nonrespondent bias in Medicare HOS\ndata, found similar estimates of physical\nand mental functions on SF-36 between\nthe weighted and unweighted analyses.\nNonetheless, the standard errors of esti-\nmates were higher in the weighted analy-\nses. Because the dummy identifier of\nhealth plans and the weighting schemes\nwere not available in the Cohort 1 Ana-\nlytic Public Use File, we were not able to\nperform weighted analysis. Despite these\nlimitations, our source of data has several\nstrengths, including its large sample and\nits nationwide spread of older enrollees in\nmanaged care plans across the U.S.\nIn conclusion, our study found that\nhealth-related limitations of social func-\ntioning are significantly predictive of ADL\ndisability and death over a period of 2\nyears among initially nondisabled older\ndiabetic Americans enrolled in Medicare\nmanaged care plans. Multiple approaches\nare needed to maintain independent liv-\ning and better survival in elderly diabetic\nindividuals. Older diabetic subjects who\nreport curtailing their social activities\nmight be at high risk of subsequent dis-\nability and, as such, should be targeted for\nmore rigorous evaluation and manage-\nment of any modifiable underlying emo-\ntional or physical disorders. Improving\ndisability-free survival in older patients\nwith diabetes requires a better under-\nstanding of social functioning and social\nsupport in this population. Given the fact\nthat the population aged 65 years is one\nof the fastest growing segments in the\nU.S., the current findings have important\nimplications for health care planning and\nresource allocation to maintain indepen-\ndence in older adults living with diabetes.\n"
