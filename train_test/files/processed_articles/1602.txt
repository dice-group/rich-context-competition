What is missing from these\nmessages is context: How does the chance of dying from breast\ncancer--or any other single disease--compare with the chance\nof dying from another disease? What is an individual's chance of\ndying from any cause? Without some context, it is impossible to\ngauge the magnitude of a disease risk.\nTo provide this context, we have created simple charts with\nage-, sex-, and smoking-specific data about the chance of dying\nfrom various common causes. In this article, we describe the\nmethod for creating these charts and make the charts publicly\navailable.\nMETHODS\nOverview\nThe risk charts are designed to be simple, low-tech tools that\ncan be used anywhere (e.g., posted in a clinic office). Our goal\nwas to create charts that put disease risk in context by placing the\n10-year chance of dying from various causes side by side. The\nrisk charts include data for a range of ages on a single page to\nfacilitate their use in a clinical setting.\nData\nInformation about deaths came from the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) Multiple Cause of Death Public Use\nFile for 1998 (3). The file contains information on all deaths of\npersons residing in the United States in 1998 and is based on\ndeath certificates completed by each state [all states require the\nreporting of all deaths; it is believed that more than 99% of all\ndeaths in the United States are registered by the states (4)]. A\ndeath certificate may list multiple causes of death, which are\ntranslated at NCHS into codes enumerated in the International\nClassification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) (5). A computer\nprogram at NCHS assigns the underlying cause of death from the\nmultiple causes listed on each certificate (4). The risk charts we\ndeveloped are based on these underlying causes of death.\nDisease Categories\nWe included in the risk charts both the most common causes\nof death (e.g., heart attack, lung cancer) and causes that have\nreceived particular attention in the media (e.g., AIDS, ovarian\ncancer). The charts present 11 causes of death for women and\nnine for men. Eight causes apply to both sexes: accidents, heart\nattack, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, influenza, AIDS,\nlung cancer, and colon cancer. Sex-specific causes are prostate\ncancer (for men) and breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer (for\nwomen).\nWe grouped individual causes of death into disease categories\nusing standard NCHS groupings [i.e., based on a list of the 282\nmost common causes of death (6); see supplemental Table 1 on the\nJournal's Web site at http://jncicancerspectrum.oupjournals.org/\njnci/content/vol94/issue11/index.shtml]. Our only departure from\nthe NCHS groupings was the creation of the category \"heart at-\ntack,\" which includes deaths from acute and chronic ischemic heart\ndisease and associated complications (e.g., congestive heart failure\nand arrhythmia); the heart attack category does not include other\nheart disease deaths (e.g., endocarditis, valvular disease, pericardi-\ntis).\nCalculations\nAge-specific death rates. We calculated the 10-year chance\nof dying from selected causes and from any cause as follows.\nWe used the NCHS Multiple Cause of Death File to count the\nnumber of deaths in 1998 for individuals 20 years old and older\nfrom each selected cause (and from any cause). Because this file\nincludes all U.S. deaths, there are sufficient data to generate\ndeath rates for every year of age. We generated these rates\nby dividing the number of deaths at each year of age by the\nestimated midyear (July 1, 1998) U.S. resident population by\nusing data from the U.S. Census (7). (For example, we generated\nthe annual death rate from lung cancer for 20-year-old women,\n21-year-old women, and 22-year-old women). Thus, we calcu-\nlated the annual death rate for every year of age for each disease\ncategory.\nTen-year probability of death. We determined the 10-year\nprobability of death for each age represented in the risk chart\n(i.e., age 20 years to age 90 years, in 5-year increments) by\ncreating a theoretical cohort of 100 000 individuals. For ex-\nample, we applied the age-specific all-cause death rate for a\n20-year-old man to calculate total number of deaths after 1 year\nnumber from 100000 to obtain the number of survivors (i.e., of\n21?). These survivors made up the population at risk for death in\nthe subsequent year. We then applied the all-cause death rate\nAffiliations of authors: S. Woloshin, L. M. Schwartz, H. G.

In this way, we defined the population at risk for death\nat the beginning of each of 10 years. We then applied the age-\nspecific death rate for each individual cause of death to the\npopulation at risk at the beginning of each year and obtained the\n10-year chance of death from each cause by adding the number\nof deaths in each of the 10 years. Table 1 illustrates this calcu-\nlation for the 10-year chance of accidental death for a 20-year-\nold man.\nAdjusting risk estimates for smoking. After age and sex,\nsmoking is the most important risk factor for a variety of specific\ncauses of death (e.g., lung cancer and heart disease) as well as\nfor all-cause mortality. Thus, we created two sets of charts: one\nfor current smokers and one for never smokers. We used the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions of\nsmoking status (8,9): current smokers are people who currently\nsmoke and have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime,\nand never smokers are people who have smoked fewer than\n100 cigarettes in their lifetime. (We did not create charts for\nformer smokers, i.e., people who do not smoke now but smoked\nat least 100 cigarettes in the past). To calculate the chance of\ndying according to smoking status, we needed the following\ninformation: the age-specific prevalence of smoking and the\nrelative risk of death (from various causes and all causes) asso-\nciated with smoking. We assumed that the risk of dying in the\ngeneral population is the weighted average of the risk for smok-\ners and nonsmokers, and that the risk for smokers is equal to the\nrisk for nonsmokers multiplied by the relative risk of death\nassociated with smoking.\nWe obtained the prevalence of smoking by age from the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (8). The relative risks of death\nfor diseases with well-established associations with smoking\n(heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, pneumonia, and influenza)\nTable 1.

Recently, Thun et al.\n(10) developed an adjusted model to account for possible con-\nfounding of the relative risks in the Surgeon General's report by\nvarious behavioral and demographic factors; they found that\nadjustment made little difference in the relative risks. We used\nthe adjusted relative risk estimates where available (i.e., for each\nspecific cause of death); otherwise, we used unadjusted values\n(i.e., for all-cause mortality).\nChart Format\nTo make the charts simple to understand, we limited the\namount of data presented and paid particular attention to their\nformat. The charts present data on the 10-year chance of dying\nto provide a reasonable window into the future; to avoid data\noverload, they use a starting age of every 5th year (i.e., age 20\nyears, 25 years, 30 years, and so on) rather than every year.\nMortality data can be represented as counts, proportions, or\nrates; we used counts with a stable denominator (e.g., 3 in 1000,\npeople find this format easiest to understand (11\u00ad14). The data\nin the risk charts are given as the number of deaths per 1000\ntrouble imagining such a large group (i.e., 100 000 is outside of\ncommon experience) (15). To further simplify the appearance of\nthe charts, we rounded the number of deaths to the nearest whole\nnumber and shaded cells in which the death rate was less than\n1 per 1000. Finally, to help clarify how much each individual\ndisease category contributes to all-cause mortality, the charts\ninclude the overall chance of dying.\nRESULTS\nRisk Chart for Never Smokers\nFig. 1 displays the 10-year disease-specific mortality and all-\ncause mortality in 5-year increments for women who never\nsmoked. The first row shows that, for 20-year-old women, death\nwill die in the next 10 years) and that accidents are responsible\nfor half of the deaths that do occur. By the time a woman reaches\n40 years of age, heart attack, stroke, colon cancer, breast cancer,\nAIDS, and accidents are about equally common causes of death,\nalthough death is still quite infrequent (17 of 1000 women who\nare 40 years old will die in the next 10 years). After age 50, heart\nattack becomes the single largest cause of death for women.\nBreast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death until about age\n65, when lung and colon cancer reach about the same magnitude\n(although by age 80, lung cancer deaths drop off and colon\ncancer deaths exceed breast cancer deaths). By age 75, a wom-\nan's chance of dying from pneumonia exceeds her chance of\ndying from any one cancer.\nThe risk chart for nonsmoking men appears in Fig. 2. A\ncomparison of Fig. 1 and 2 shows that, until age 80, a man's\nFig. 2. Risk chart for men who have never smoked. The chart indicates the number of men per 1000 who will die from various diseases and for any reason during\nthe next 10 years, beginning at the indicated age. Shaded area indicates age group and disease combinations with fewer than 1 death per 1000.\noverall chance of dying in the next 10 years is greater than that\nof a woman. Similarly, a man's chance of death from accidents\nalways exceeds a woman's chance; until age 70, a man's chance\nof accidental death is twice that of women. The overall patterns\nof death, however, are similar. From age 40 on, heart attack is\nthe most common single cause of death for men. Until about age\n70, a man's chances of dying from lung, colon, or prostate\ncancer are all similar; from age 70 on, however, death from\nprostate cancer becomes much more common than death from\nthe other cancers. After age 80, the chance of dying from pneu-\nmonia exceeds the chance of dying from any one cancer.\nRisk Chart for Current Smokers\nA current smoker refers to someone who currently smokes\nand who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime.\nAt all ages, a smoker's chance of dying in the next 10 years is\ngreater than that of a never-smoker. Fig. 3 shows that, for female\nsmokers, lung cancer is the leading cause of death from about\nage 40 until age 75; the chance of death from lung cancer is\nsubstantially greater than the chance of death from breast cancer\nfrom age 35 on. After age 75, the chance of dying from a heart\nattack exceeds the chance of dying from any of the major can-\ncers. Fig. 4 shows that, for men who smoke, heart attack is the\nleading cause of death until age 50. Thereafter, the chance of\ndying from lung cancer is higher than the chance of dying from\nheart attack until about age 80, after which the chance of dying\nfrom heart attack exceeds the chance of dying from lung cancer.\nAt every age, a man's chance of dying from lung cancer sub-\nstantially exceeds his chance of dying from prostate cancer.\nDISCUSSION\nWe created simple charts with age-, sex-, and smoking-\nspecific data about the chances of dying from various common\ncauses in the next 10 years. The charts are designed to put the\nchance of dying from a given disease in the context of the\nchances of dying from other diseases and of dying from any\ncause.\nSeveral limitations of the charts merit comment. First, the\ncharts are only as accurate as the data on which they are based.\nWe used the 1998 Multiple Cause of Death Public Use File from\nthe NCHS, the best available national source of mortality data.\nNevertheless, these data are derived from death certificates. The\naccuracy of cause-of-death statistics is determined by the ability\nof the certifier (usually a physician, medical examiner, or coro-\nner) to properly diagnose the cause of death (4). Although valid\nquestions have been raised about the reliability of death certifi-\ncates (16), they remain the standard source of data about causes\nof death in the United States. Second, the charts present data\nonly about mortality, not about disease incidence. Many people\nmay be concerned about their chances of developing a disease,\nnot just their chances of dying from it. Developing incidence\ncharts will be very challenging, however, because judgments\nFig. 3. Risk chart for women who currently smoke. The chart indicates the number of women smokers per 1000 who will die from various diseases and for any reason\nduring the next 10 years, beginning at the indicated age. Shaded area indicates age group and disease combinations with fewer than 1 death per 1000.\nabout incidence are far more ambiguous than judgments about\ndeath. For example, a myocardial infarction can be defined as a\nsmall rise in a serum troponin level or as a substantial creatine\nkinase elevation in the context of typical symptoms and EKG\nchanges. Because reporting on mortality is far less subjective\nthan defining incident cases, the charts present only the chance\nof dying. Similarly, the charts do not present information about\nquality of life with different diseases, information that might be\nhelpful for patients making decisions. Such quality-of-life infor-\nmation, however, is not readily available.\nThird, our risk estimates are not completely individualized.\nPatients with important disease risk factors, such as a strong\nfamily history of a certain disease, might be able to obtain more\nprecise estimates of their risk of dying from that disease from a\ncustomized assessment (17). We have, however, made an effort\nto account for what are arguably the three most important risk\nfactors for death: age, sex, and smoking. We did not create a set\nof charts for former smokers because their risk estimates will\nvary according to a variety of factors [e.g., length of time since\nstopping smoking, extent of prior smoke exposure, and age of\ninitiation of regular smoking (9)]. It is reasonable to assume that\nthe risks for former smokers are intermediate between those of\ncurrent smokers and never smokers (and that the longer the time\nsince the last cigarette, the closer the former smoker's risk ap-\nproximates that of a never smoker) (9,10). It should be noted that\nour charts do have several distinct advantages over interactive\ncomputer applications: they are inexpensive, they can be used\nanywhere, and they require no special hardware or trained per-\nsonnel.\nWe believe that our risk charts will help people better under-\nstand and compare the important health threats they face. The\ncharts could be posted in clinic offices or distributed to patients\nfor easy reference when decisions (e.g., about cancer screening)\nare being made. Because the charts give people a sense of how\nmuch smoking adds to their chance of dying at every age, they\nmay also be useful in smoking prevention and cessation efforts.\nWe believe that the risk charts are a good first step at helping\nphysicians and their patients put cancer and other disease risks in\ncontext.\nREFERENCES\n(1) American Cancer Society.
