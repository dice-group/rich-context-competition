Introduction\nThe discrepancy between male and female mortality rates, recognized since at\nSexual selection and the Male:Female Mortality Ratio\nresearchers have described how sex differences in mortality are explained by traits\nshaped by sexual selection interacting with cultural and environmental factors (e.g.,\nDaly and Wilson, 1985). The integration of evolutionary and proximate models\nremains rare, however, in studies of mortality. This paper provides an example of\nhow evolutionary and proximate/cultural approaches do not necessarily contradict\neach other but can together contribute to a coherent comprehensive explanation. The\nfocus here is on the ratio of male to female mortality rates (M:F MR) at different ages\nfor the leading causes of death in the USA, for all causes of death across 20 nations,\nand across historical time for 5 nations. Together they illustrate the importance of\nincorporating both evolutionary and proximate/cultural factors into explanations for\nmortality.\n1.1 Sexual selection and longevity\nIn species where females make a greater parental investment, they tend to be more\ndiscriminating in mate choice, so the reproductive success of males depends largely\non their ability to compete for mating opportunities (Trivers, 1972) either by winning\nfights with other males or by presenting displays preferred by females (Darwin,\n1871). The fitness benefits of these outcomes tend to increase the prevalence of\ngenes that promote male risk-taking and competitive ability at the expense of\ndecreased investment in repair capacity and disease prevention (Daly and Wilson,\n1978). This is the evolutionary reason why females live longer on average in most\nanimal species (Hazzard, 1990). It illustrates how natural and sexual selection tend to\nmaximize the survival of genes, sometimes at the expense of the survival of\nindividuals. A pleiotropic gene that has a beneficial early effect and a detrimental late\neffect will be selected for because younger individuals have a higher reproductive\nvalue. The cumulative result of these pleiotropic genes is senescence (Williams,\n1.2 Physiological and behavioral differences\nCompared to women, men tend to have greater height and weight, more upper-\nbody strength, higher metabolic rates, higher juvenile mortality, later sexual maturity,\nand shorter lifespans (Cronin, 1991). The role of sexual selection is supported by the\nhigh correlation between excess male mortality and sexual size dimorphism across\nmammalian taxa, after controlling for the effects of phylogeny (Promislow, 1992).\nSome increased risk results directly from the increased vulnerability of male\nstructural, physiological, endocrinological, and immunological systems, especially\nlower resistance to infection, injury, stress and degenerative diseases (Folstad and\nhave parasites (Moore, 2002), both because of the immunosuppressive effects of\ntestosterone and because their bodies are simply larger (Folstad and Karter, 1992).\nInfection or parasites kill twice as many men than women in developed countries,\nSexual selection and the Male:Female Mortality Ratio\nfour times as many in undeveloped countries (Owens, 2002). Hamilton and Zuk\n(1982) have proposed that females are sensitive to physiological cues reflecting\nparasite loads in potential male mates, with the exemplar being female birds who\nprefer brightly colored males. Men are also more susceptible than women to mortality\nstemming from cold winter months than women are (Rau and Doblhammer, 2003).\n1.3 Mortality risk and unhealthy male behaviors\nSexual selection also helps to explain some differences in behavioral tendencies,\nincluding risk-taking, competitiveness, and sensitivity to hierarchy (Cronin, 1991).\nGreater male than female variation in reproductive success means that risk-taking has\nhigher payoffs for males as they compete for resources, social status, and mates (Daly\nSpecial selection pressures faced by females may also have increased sex\ndifferences in the tendency for engaging in risky behaviors. The costs of risk-taking\ntend to be higher for women because offspring survival depends more on maternal\nthan paternal care and defense (Campbell, 1999). This notion fits quite well with the\nrecent recognition of sex differences in behavioral responses to stress. Rather than the\n\"fight or flight\" behavior that may characterize male behavioral reactions to adverse\ncircumstances, the female behavioral pattern is thought to resemble a \"tend-and-\nbefriend\" response where nurturant tending activities protect and reduce distress in\noneself and offspring and safety and befriending activities create and maintain social\nnetworks facilitating this process (Taylor, Klein, Lewis, Gruenewald, Gurung,\nThe tendency for males to be less cautious is thought to account for much of the\nsex difference in rates of violence and the use of alcohol or illicit drugs (Kraemer,\n2000). Accidents are the fourth leading cause of death for men in the USA, but the\nseventh for women (Anderson, 2001). The substantially higher rates of fatal and non-\nfatal accidents for boys has been partially attributed to a pattern of poor motor and\ncognitive regulation, leading to a misjudgment of risk (Kraemer, 2000).\nEpidemiologists are starting to recognize the evolutionary significance of\ndisproportionate male risk-taking in their recommendations for intervention programs\n(Nell, 2003). Suicide rates for young men in several Western nations are now several\ntimes that of young women (McClure, 2000). Social expectations for males to be\ntough, and discouragement of the expression of emotions such as anxiety and shame\nmay amplify the tendency to take risks (Doyle, 2001; Kraemer, 2000). Some excess\nmale mortality may also result from preferential medical assistance to females in life\nthreatening situations (Moynihan, 1998).\nHigher rates of health adverse behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and working\nin hazardous occupations contribute to excess male mortality (Hazzard, 1986). The\nrecent dramatic declines in male mortality from lung cancer and stroke are due in part\nto decreases in male smoking rates (Brennan and Bray, 2002). Smoking rates have\nincreased for women (Pampel, 2002), a factor which may narrow the sex difference in\nSexual selection and the Male:Female Mortality Ratio\nlung cancer and stroke mortality. Males are more likely to die from chronic liver\ndisease and cirrhosis than females, most likely as a result of higher rates of alcohol\nconsumption (Zhang, Sasaki, and Kesteloot, 1995). In industrialized countries, the\nepidemic of coronary heart disease following several decades after increased\nconsumption of dietary fats has a greater toll on men than women (Lawlor, Ebrahim,\n1.4 Historical and cultural influences\nHistorical changes in human environments have significantly changed mortality\npatterns. These influences include: the increased spread of infectious diseases through\nincreasing population size, mobility, and the domestication of animals (Diamond,\n1997); public health measures such as improved sanitation and vaccination\n(McKeown, 1979); the development of antibiotics; the emergence of scientific\nmedicine; the increased availability and consumption of fatty foods, alcohol, tobacco,\nand other drugs (Eaton, et al., 2002); and the widespread availability of automobiles\nand lethal weapons. These changes have resulted in both the recent dramatic decline\nin mortality from infectious diseases (Cutler and Meara, 2001) and the increasing\nprominence of mortality from causes directly or indirectly influenced by behavior,\nmost of which disproportionately affect men. The decline in maternal mortality has\nalso dramatically decreased the female mortality rate and increased the divergence\nWomen's health has also been adversely affected by changes from cultural\nmodernization. Increasing caloric intake and consumption of dietary fats has led to\nearlier menarche (Eaton and Eaton III, 1999), and women in modern societies\nexperience several times more menstrual cycles than women in natural fertility\nexposure to estrogen and progesterone are likely responsible for increased rates of\nCultural factors, such as the distribution of mating opportunities and control of\nresources related to mate acquisition and retention can also impact the M:F MR. The\nproportion of marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women, or Operational Sex Ratio\n(OSR; Emlen and Oring, 1977) may be related to the intensity of risky male\nbehavioral strategies and mate competition. Populations with a relatively high OSR\nhave higher male death rates from hostile competitions for the purpose of acquiring\nresources or mates, especially those with relatively scarce resources (Mesquida and\nWiener, 1996). When resources are scarce, the costs of risky male aggression\ndecrease and the potential benefits increase (Wilson and Daly, 1985). The famous\nWhitehall studies revealed that disease risk is inversely correlated with social status\nrelative to position in a bureaucratic hierarchy, rather than to objective status, even\nwhen controlling for numerous health-related behaviors (Marmot, Kogevinas and\nSexual selection and the Male:Female Mortality Ratio\nMale-male aggression is highest when only a small proportion of men can acquire\nsufficient resources to be a desirable mating or marriage partner (Daly and Wilson,\n1988). Cultures with polygynous mating systems increase the variance in male\nreproductive success, raising the intensity of male-male competition and aggression\n(Betzig, 1986; Chagnon, 1977). Men have lower mortality risks and a longer lifespan\nwhen the characteristics valued in mate selection depend less on physical violence\nand more on prolonged education and training (Peruse, 1993). One hundred million\npeople died from coalition based aggression in Western culture during the 20th\ncentury, but if Western conflicts produced the same number of per capita war deaths\nas in many preindustrial societies, they would have resulted in about two billion\nSpecific historical events also impact the ratio of male to female mortality across\nage groups. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to increased inflation,\nunemployment, and lower wages (Little, 1998). Physical hardships, social disruption,\nand social distress associated with the 44% decline in Russia's GDP are believed to\nhave caused 3.4 million pre-mature deaths (Rosefielde, 2001). The increase in\nmortality rates was more pronounced for men than for women (Little, 1998), although\na portion of the increased mortality differential can be attributed to inadequacies in\nheath care (Andreev, Nolte, Shkolnikov, Varavikova, and McKee, 2003). Male life\n1.5 Expected mortality differences in modern populations\nThese data support the expectation that males tend to have higher mortality rates\nthan females for most causes of death across the life span, with the difference peaking\nin young adulthood when males reach sexual maturity and begin competing for\nmates. At this age, we expect to see the highest differences for direct behavioral\n(external) causes of death, such as homicide, suicide, and accidents. The mortality\ndifferences for behaviorally mediated internal causes, such as cardiovascular disease,\nare expected to peak decades later. Previous evolutionary researchers have made\nsimilar predictions (Daly and Wilson, 1985). Although the highest differences are\nexpected for external causes, the greatest proportion of excess male life years lost\nmay now be due to internal causes, because such a high proportion of total mortality\nnow results from internal causes of death that occur late in the lifespan.\nThe past century in the West has seen a major epidemiological transition from\nmortality mainly caused by infection, other acute diseases and pregnancy and\nchildbirth, to mortality resulting mainly from chronic diseases related to lifestyle and\naging. As the massive and relatively sex indiscriminate death rates from infection\ndecline, and as deaths in childbirth decrease, mortality discrepancies arising from\nbehavioral causes become proportionately much more prominent. Cross-national\nvariation in the sex difference in mortality is expected, as is a generic pattern of peak\nmortality rate discrepancies in early adulthood and secondary peaks in later\nadulthood. Finally, we consider whether the overall ratio of male to female mortality\nSexual selection and the Male:Female Mortality Ratio\nmay be a useful population statistic that reflects the severity of male-male\ncompetition, environmental uncertainty, and the degree of variance in resources and\nsocial status. Documenting the M:F MR across ages and conditions will provide\nprecise picture of the magnitude of mortality differences, allowing for a richer\nunderstanding than the "
