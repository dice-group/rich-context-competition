In addition to intuition\nand judgment, businesses now use various software to draw\nconclusions from data sets and to thereby make decisions.\nSurprisingly, schools do not teach students the same soft-\nware that businesses look for. In his article that measures the\npopularity of many data analysis software, Robert Muenchen\nnotes that discovering the software skills that employers are\nseeking would \"require a time consuming content analysis of\njob descriptions\" (Muenchen, 2014). However, he finds\nother ways to figure out the statistical software skills that\nemployers seek. One of these methods is to examine which\nsoftware they currently use. Muenchen includes a survey\nconducted by Rexer Analytics, a data mining consulting\nfirm, about the relative popularity of various data analysis\nsoftware in 2010. The results of the survey are pictured in\nFigure 1. As seen, data miners use R, SAS, and SPSS the\nSAS, and SPSS, respectively, it can be inferred that these are\nthe software skills that the greatest proportion of employers\nwill continue to look for. However, this method only exam-\nines the software that employers might seek if they are hir-\ning, so it does not accurately measure the software that they\ncurrently look for. Muenchen's other method does this,\nstudying software skills that employers currently seek as\nthey try to fill open positions. In this approach, Muenchen\nputs together a rough sketch of statistical software capabili-\nties sought by employers by perusing the job advertising site,\nIndeed.com, a search site the comprises the major job\nboards--Monster, Careerbuilder, Hotjobs, Craigslist--as\nwell as many newspapers, associations, and company web-\nsites (Muenchen, 2014). He summarized his discovery in\nAs seen--in contrast to R's greater usage by companies\nover SAS, illustrated in Figure 1--job openings in SAS sub-\nstantially lead open positions that require any other data\nanalysis software. For employers, SPSS and R skills finish in\nsecond and third place. This second estimation method of\nMuenchen measures the software skill deficits in the job\nmarket. It seems that the demand for people with SAS skills\noutweighs the number of individuals with this capability.\nOne reason for this disconnect could be that colleges and\nuniversities are not teaching SAS skills in proportion to the\ndemand for these skills.\nThe convenience sample is collected based on school's\nanswering our questionnaire. There was no other way to\ncollect the data. We had to rely on the questionnaire that we\n1Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, IN, USA\n2University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nCeyhun Ozgur, Valparaiso University, 1909 Chapel Drive, Valparaiso,\nEmail: ceyhun.ozgur@valpo.edu\nSelection of Statistical Software for\nSolving Big Data Problems: A Guide for\nBusinesses, Students, and Universities\nCeyhun Ozgur1, Michelle Kleckner2, and Yang Li1\n Keywords\nbig data, Excel, Minitab, R, SAS, SPSS, statistical software\n2 SAGE Open\nsent to establish this connect between software used and soft-\nware sought. To assess this potential disconnect, we surveyed\n18 departments--small and large, state and private, under-\ngraduate and graduate, East and West--and, as expected, we\ndiscovered a discrepancy between the software taught and\nthe software sought. The survey results are outlined in Table\n1. The responses indicate that although SAS boasts a com-\nmanding lead in job openings, data analysis software taught\nat universities does not reflect this dominance. Only a few\nmore departments teach SAS than R or SPSS. Some depart-\nments do not teach any software at all! Although this survey\nhas a small sample size, the results do roughly sketch a trend\nseen in quantitative, engineering, and business departments\nacross the country. College and university departments have\nnot aligned their use of statistical packages to the skills\ndemanded by employers. In many departments, SAS and\nFigure 1. 2010 Rever analytics survey results of analytic tools.\nFigure 2. Jobs requiring various software.\nOzgur et al. 3\nSPSS training are offered as noncredit generating instruc-\ntions and also as part of mentoring. The skills required to\nteach Excel and SAS are very different. The departments\nneed to invest in teachers who are capable of teaching these\nspecialized courses using Excel, SAS, SPSS, and R.\nThe use of Excel as a software is very different than use\nof SAS or SPSS, but the cost and training is significantly\nhigher for SPSS or SAS. We can use Excel add-ins to deal\nwith the deficiency in software. We cannot solve as big of\nproblems with Excel as with SAS or SPSS. However, Excel\ncan still be useful software, especially with add-ins for\nsmall businesses.\nPaying attention only to job availability, it seems that\nmany schools need to reconsider their software choice in\nfavor of implementing SAS. Nevertheless, there are many\nfactors to consider other than the popularity within the job\nmarket. Schools must also consider the cost and time effec-\ntiveness of incorporating each software into their curriculum.\nFurthermore, specific departments within the school should\nconsider which software best fits their area of study. One aim\nof this article is to provide this necessary information by out-\nlining the cost, training requirement, statistical techniques,\nand specific uses within industry of leading data analysis\nsoftware.\nTable 1.

But the converse is also true. In a big data world,\na competitor that fails to sufficiently develop its capabilities will\nbe left behind. (p. 5)\nIn other words, big data can no longer be ignored because\ncompanies that take advantage of it are winning the race\nagainst their less-modern competitors. More companies must\nconsider implementing this type of analysis to stay competi-\ntive, and in doing so, they will need to understand which\nsoftware is most appropriate for their business. This article\nwill help gather and condense the necessary information for\nthis type of decision. For those progressive companies that\nalready utilize software to realize their goals, they can recon-\nsider their current software choice in light of this comprehen-\nsive information.\nMedical research is often weakened by poor statistical\npractice, and inappropriate use of statistical computer soft-\nware is part of this problem. The statistical knowledge that\nmedical researchers require has traditionally been gained in\nboth dedicated and ad hoc learning time, often separate from\nthe research processes in which the statistical methods are\napplied. Computer software, however, can be written to flex-\nibly support statistical practice (Buchan, 2000).\nAll in all, this article will focus on SAS, SPSS, and R\nsoftware because both methods in Muenchen's study indi-\ncate that they are the three most competitively sought soft-\nware in industry. The article includes a complete collection\nof the cost-effectiveness, training, uses, and specific uses\nwithin industry of each of these software. It will begin,\nthough, with an investigation of Excel and its add-ins because\nof their cost-effectiveness, utility, and availability.\nExcel Add-Ins\nWhat Are Excel Add-Ins?\nAdd-ins are programs that add optional features and com-\nmands to the traditional capabilities of Microsoft Excel.\nExcel has created add-ins for a multitude of purposes: data\nanalysis, presentation, investment, business, personal, utili-\nties and productivity tools, and organization. Within data\nanalysis, some of the most popular add-ins include the\nAnalysis Toolpak, Solver, and MegaStat. While the Analysis\nToolpak and Solver are free add-ins, MegaStat is not. This\nsection will focus on MegaStat and its usefulness in\nindustry.\nCost\nMegaStat costs US$13.50, and prospective users can pur-\nchase it on McGraw-Hill's website.\nTraining\nWith the focus on science, technology, engineering, and\nmathematics (STEM) fields in this day and age, chances are\nmost people who have used Microsoft Excel at some point\nduring their lifetime. Although they may not have used the\nstatistical analysis tools of Excel, they have used it to swiftly\nperform calculations of data, or at least to organize data. The\ncreator of MegaStat, Orris Burdeane, explains, \"Since\nMegaStat looks and works like Excel, almost anyone could\nuse it to generate some output with just a few minutes of\ntraining\" (O. Burdeane, personal communication, January\nbuttons, and checkboxes that work largely the same as those\nin standard Excel. Therefore, the 53-page tutorial pdf--com-\nplete with a step-by-step process to using each test that\nMegaStat performs, and pictures at every step--will likely\nprovide more than enough guidance for trainees to effec-\ntively use this software.\nStatistical Method/Tests/Uses\nAs will be seen later in this article, MegaStat can execute\nmany of the same jobs that more costly software do.\nAccording to the McGraw-Hill website, MegaStat can per-\nform a multitude of statistical operations: descriptive statis-\ntics, frequency distributions, probability, confidence intervals\nand sample size, hypothesis tests, ANOVA, regression, time-\nseries/forecasting, chi-square, nine nonparametric tests,\nquality control process charts, and generation of random\nnumbers (\"Megastat,\" 2014). The creator of MegaStat him-\nself acknowledges that SPSS and SAS, specifically, have\nmore advanced options, \"especially in the area of multivari-\nate statistics\" (O. Burdeane, personal communication,\nhandle most things encountered by non-PhD statisticians\"\nThe major caveat for this cheap and easy-to-use software\nis its size capability. For example, Burdeane experimented\nwith the number of data points that MegaStat can handle a\nrows. That is over 1 \u00bd million data points and MegaStat did\na descriptive statistics analysis on it in about 10 seconds\" (O.\nWhile the capability to analyze a million and a half data\npoints sounds like a tremendous feat, and it is, this capability\ndoes not meet the demand of large companies like Wal-Mart\nand Facebook. An article published by SAS called \"Big Data\nMeets Big Data Analytics\" puts it plainly: \"Wal-Mart han-\ndles more than a million customer transactions each hour and\nOzgur et al. 5\nimports those into databases estimated to contain more than\n2.5 petabytes of data,\" and \"Facebook handles more than 250\nmillion photo uploads and the interactions of 800 million\nactive users with more than 900 million objects (pages,\ngroups, etc.) each day\" (SAS, 2014b). Extracting this data\nand making use of it using MegaStat is just not feasible.\nBurdeane also mentioned a couple of other restrictions of\nMegaStat, including its limitation to 12 independent vari-\nables in multiple regression and further restrictions on vari-\nables and table size (O. Burdeane, personal communication,\nconstraints, the fact remains that it is an extremely powerful\nsoftware given the cost and training required.\nSpecific Uses in Industry\nThe creator of MegaStat believes that this software is used\nby a different group of people from the major statistical\npackages. Burdeane (personal communication, January 29,\nI would guess that most use of MegaStat in companies is by\npeople who are not professional statisticians. I think people with\nformal training in statistics beyond an introductory course would\nhave experience with one of the big packages (SAS, SPSS,\nMinitab) and would tend to stick with that software even if it\nwas overkill for many analyses.\nHe suggests that many analyses do not require major\npackages, like SAS, SPSS, and R, but statisticians stick to\nthem because they are comfortable.\nHowever, companies within industry do still use Excel.\nFor example, a global appliance manufacturer uses Excel\n\"for extensive `What If' analysis around budgeting\" and to\nforecast (J. Ward, personal communication, January 20,\nSPSS\nWhat Is SPSS?\nSPSS, originally termed Statistical Package for the Social\nSciences, was released in 1968 as a software designed for the\nsocial sciences. Since then, IBM has replaced SPSS Inc. as the\nowner, and the software has expanded its user base past this one\narea. The software's former acronym has been replaced with\nStatistical Product and Service Solutions to reflect the greater\ndiversity of its clients. Arguably, it still remains the leading sta-\ntistical analysis software package for the social sciences.\nCost\nObviously, consumers can buy SPSS software packages sep-\narately by choosing a particular product that they think will\nsatisfy their need; however, SPSS offers bundles that cost\nmuch less than paying for the programs independently. SPSS\noffers three of these bundles: standard, professional, and\npremium.\nWithin each of these bundles, SPSS gives four options: an\nauthorized user license, authorized user initial fixed term\nlicense, concurrent user license, and concurrent user initial\nfixed term license. Thus, when customers decide they want\nto purchase SPSS, they have to make two decisions: user\nlicense versus initial fixed term license and authorized user\nversus concurrent user. User licenses never expire, while ini-\ntial fixed term licenses last for 12 months.An authorized user\nis a single licensee who buys the right to use the program; a\nconcurrent user is the right for a single person to use the pro-\ngram at a given time, but it does not distinguish who this\nperson has to be.\nWith these descriptions in mind, beneath in Table 2 are\nthe prices for purchasing the three different bundles of SPSS.\nSPSS also offers student packages for college attendees.\nStudents can purchase the single user initial fixed-term\nlicense \"SPSS GradPack\" software from their college or uni-\nversity, or they can buy it from SPSS's official distributors,\nlike Creation Engine, On the Hub, StudentDiscounts.com,\nStudica, and ThinkEDU (IBM, 2014b). For example, on the\nCreation Engine website, students can buy the SPSS Statistics\nPremium GradPack for US$98.95 (\"IBM SPSS Statistics\nTraining\nIn her article about the use of statistical software for sociol-\nogy, Ashley Crossman addresses the difficulty--or lack\nthereof--of using SPSS for the first time. She explains,\nTable 2.

Menus and dialogue boxes make\nit possible to perform analyses without having to write command\nsyntax, like in other programs. It is also simple and easy to enter\nand edit data directly into the programs. (Crossman, 2014)\nOn the surface, these descriptions make SPSS sound a lot\nlike Excel. In fact, SPSS does look similar to typical spread-\nsheet applications like Excel, and its ease of use is very com-\nparable to Excel as well.\nStatistical Method/Tests/Uses\nThere are many differences between Excel and SPSS that\nsuit SPSS to better handle statistical methods. For one,\n\"SPSS was designed specifically for statistical processing of\nlarge amount of data at an enterprise level,\" while spread-\nsheets are broadly applicable to many different tasks outside\nof statistical computing (Robbins, 2012). An advantage of\nthis specialized design is that SPSS \"keeps calculated statis-\ntics and graphs separate from the raw data but still easily\naccessible\" (Robbins, 2012). SPSS software furthermore has\na much more convenient platform for performing statistical\ntests. For instance, performing a one-sample t test in Excel\nrequires some independent calculations by the user, whereas\nwith SPSS, the user only needs to \"select a variable and sup-\nply the value to compare with [the] sample\" and click \"Ok\"\n(Robbins, 2012). Another advantage of SPSS is that it links\nnumerically coded data to its original meaning (Robbins,\n2012). With most data being electronically stored in numeri-\ncal fashion, this feature of SPSS is highly valuable.\nFor these reasons, SPSS is well suited to statistical analy-\nsis, but what statistical procedures can SPSS handle? SPSS's\nstandard bundle includes its statistics base, advanced statis-\ntics, bootstrapping, custom tables, and regression capabili-\nties. Purchasing the professional bundle further supplies the\nconsumer with the categories, data preparation, decision\ntrees, forecasting, and missing values features. The most\ncomprehensive bundle, premium, provides the user with the\ncomplex samples, conjoin, direct marketing, exact tests, neu-\nral networks, amos, sample power, and visualization designer,\nin addition to all of the packages from the professional bun-\nAfter the statistical analysis is complete, SPSS is also use-\nful for generating plots of distributions and trends, charts,\nand tabulated reports.\nSpecific Uses in Industry\nIBM's SPSS software has spanned many industries. On its\nwebsite, prospective clients can read about SPSS success\nstories in fields like automotive, banking, chemical and\npetroleum, computer services, consumer products, educa-\ntion, electronics, energy and utilities, and on and on. They\ncan also access a list of SPSS's clients, such as Barclays,\nKaplan, and Wimbledon Championships. Below are a couple\nmore specific examples of SPSS at work within industry.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Infinity insurance uses SPSS's predictive analytics\nfeature to detect fraudulent claims (IBM, 2014c).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"By mining alumni and stakeholder records, social\nmedia and other unstructured data-sets with text ana-\nlytics software, [Michigan State University] gains\ninsights into the engagement, sentiments and behavior\nof current and potential donors,\" which enables\nsmarter fund-raising (\"Success Stories for SPSS,\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Guardia Civil, Spain's very first national law\nenforcement agency, has investigated crimes and psy-\nchology using SPSS (\"Success Stories for SPSS,\"\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 One distinguished hospital uses SPSS to forecast pay-\nment behavior. It tries \"to better identify patients who\nare most likely to pay their hospital bills\" by what it\ncalls \"predict[ing] patient payment potential\"\nSAS\nWhat Is SAS?\nSAS (Statistical Analysis System) is a commercial statistical\nNorth Carolina State University as part of an agricultural\nresearch project. Its usage has grown exponentially since\narticle will discuss the two main SAS starter packages:\nAnalytics Pro and Visual Data Discovery.\nAn important fact to note about SAS is that the software\ndoes not run on Mac computers very easily (one way to run\nthe software is through parallels, where users buy and run the\nWindows interface as well).\nCost\nAn individual license of the Analytics Pro version of SAS\nthereafter. The cost for each renewal is 28% of the amount\noriginally paid in the first year. With a few more features\nthan the Analytics Pro system, the Visual Data Discovery\npackage costs US$10,800 for the first year of use. Like\nAnalytics Pro, renewing this package costs 28% of the origi-\nHowever, these prices only apply to customers working with\ntheir own data. If a user wishes to perform data analysis for\nthe benefit of some other party, then he must secure a differ-\nent license by consulting a SAS representative (SAS, 2014d).\nOne of these alternative licenses is a server-based license.\nThese licenses certainly save schools and businesses money\nOzgur et al. 7\nby allowing their affiliates each to access the software\nthrough a web-based connection or a network. SAS fills\nthese requests on a case-by-case basis, so interested custom-\ners should speak to SAS directly to get a quote (SAS, 2014d).\nOn top of these two versions, SAS has created an\nOnDemand edition, which is available at no cost to degree-\ngranting institutions. Professors can set up an account online,\nand they and their students can access the software anywhere\nwith an Internet access. Although this free software \"has\nbeen reported to be slow at times,\" it definitely provides a\ngreat opportunity for schools to teach students the basics of\nSAS programming (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013, 3).\nWhile the proper versions of SAS do come at a steep\nfinancial cost, they furthermore cost time in the form of\ninstallation. Chelsea Loomis Lofland and Rebecca Ottesen\nspeak to this expense in their article, \"The SAS Versus R\nDebate in Industry and Academia.\" They explain, \"SAS can\nbe difficult for users to obtain and the initial installation is\nsometimes tricky . . . long and difficult\" (Loomis Lofland &\nOttesen, 2013, p. 3). However, in contrast to some other soft-\nware (like R, as will be seen later), SAS only requires this\ninitial installation. It does not require users to install any\npackages in the future. Everything is included in this set-up.\nTraining\nAshley Crossman accurately advises, \"SAS is a great pro-\ngram for the intermediate and advanced user because it is\nvery powerful, can be used with extremely large data sets,\nandcanperformcomplexandadvancedanalyses\"(Crossman,\n2014). After all, SAS requires more training than Excel and\nSPSS because it largely runs on programming syntax rather\nthan point\u00adclick menus that other software boast.\nThe amount of training necessary for individuals to prop-\nerly use SAS depends on many factors, including the trainee's\nbackground and the type of analysis she will need to perform.\nIn terms of background, prospective SAS programmers with\nprior programming experience will have a much easier time.\nSAS syntax resembles that of other programming languages,\nso experience with one language often helps learn another.\nFor instance, SAS is similar to Java in that both contain data\nvalues, function calls, identifying key words at the beginning\nofeachline,andsemicolonsattheendofeachline(Boudreaux,\n2003). But, even if the syntax of SAS and a previously learned\nlanguage are completely different, experience with coding is\nextremely helpful because the art of programming is a differ-\nent kind of thinking. It is easy to migrate from one tool to the\nother. The \"primary\" push is to get organizations to use proper\ntools. The training required also depends on the type of analy-\nsis that the trainee must carry out. If the trainee only needs to\nrun the same type of test repeatedly, then she may only need\ntraining in a specific aspect of SAS programming; however, if\nthe trainee will need to develop a process based on each new\ntask, then she will need more sound understanding of the\nsoftware.\nFortunately, experts have written copious texts about how\nto use SAS, and SAS has a strong user support system, so\neven if users do not have complete understanding of the soft-\nware, they can run it. While there exists no easy way to cal-\nculate the number of books written about SAS, Robert\nMuenchen did as best he could to estimate these statistics by\nsearching for books published with \"SAS\" in their title. He\nfound that close to five hundred of these books were pub-\n2013). In addition to all these useful texts, experts really can-\nnot pinpoint any issues with the user support of SAS. Loomis\nLofland and Ottesen clarify,\nSAS has extensive online documentation, expert technical\nsupport, professional training courses, many excellent books in\npress, and a tight-knit user group and web-based community.\nProblems can be addressed to SAS directly via tech support who\nreplies very quickly and will work with the user to solve the\nThey designate the user support service of SAS as one of\nits main specialties. Therefore, even though SAS requires\nsome programming skills, the strength of SAS's support sys-\ntem makes it more manageable for less advanced users.\nStatistical Method/Tests/Uses\nSAS's Analytics Pro bundle comes with three of the most\npopular SAS products: Base SAS, SAS/STAT, and SAS/\nGRAPH. The corporation's Visual Data Discovery collection\nincludes SAS Enterprise Guide (SAS's only point\u00adclick\ninterface) and JMP software to make discovery and explor-\natory analysis easier.\nWith either of these toolsets, programmers can perform a\nnumber of statistical tests. The Institute for Digital Research\nand Education website outlines a multitude of statistical tests\nand their corresponding SAS codes. The list includes 32 tests\nthat come from statistical categories such as regression, fac-\ntor analysis, discriminant analysis, ANOVA, nonparametric\ntests, and correlation (UCLA: Statistical consulting group,\nSAS can perform many more statistical tests than just\nthese, though. It also functions well with forecasting, time-\nseries analysis, and many other advanced statistical tech-\nniques. In fact, SAS has created specialized programs for\nthese methods. The SAS website's \"Products & Solutions\"\npage has a complete list of these programs.\nAlso on this page, SAS has additional packages to access\nthat are industry-specific. For example, there is a \"SAS Drug\nDevelopment\" package that \"enables the efficient develop-\nment, execution, and management of analysis and reporting\nactivities for clinical research\"; a \"SAS Fraud Management\"\npackage that \"delivers a full-service enterprise-wide fraud\nmanagement system that offers real-time scoring of accounts\nby looking at all card transactions--including purchases,\n8 SAGE Open\npayments and nonmonetary transactions\"; and a \"SAS Risk\nManagement for Insurance\" package that \"implements the\nSolvency II standard model approach for calculating risk-based\ncapital with [its] comprehensive solution for preforming risk\nanalysis and risk-based capital calculations\" (SAS, 2014c). On\ntop of these specialized packages for health care, banking, and\ninsurance, SAS has formulated software with built-in functions\nfor other areas like law enforcement, communications, retail,\ncasinos, utilities, and sports, among others.\nSAS's advantageous functions extend beyond just carry-\ning out statistics, though. It has superior qualities for both\nbefore the statistical analysis and after. Prior to the actual\nstatistics, it facilitates the reading in and managing disorga-\nnized data. Real-life data are rarely clean and analysis ready.\nSAS can interpret messy data sets, convert them to a clean\nform, and manipulate them in ways that other software can-\nnot (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013). After the user per-\nforms the statistics, SAS has impressive graphics and report\nwriting features that will help disseminate the findings in\nclear and appealing ways. But, these aesthetic products come\nwith a caveat according to Loomis Lofland and Ottesen.\nThey explain, \"SAS provides many useful procedures for\ncreating detailed and polished reports\"; however, \"some of\nthe more detailed reporting procedures . . . have a learning\ncurve that takes place before being able to use them cor-\nSpecific Uses in Industry\nAs stated in the previous section, SAS has built-in, func-\ntional packages for many specific industries, including health\ncare, banking, insurance, law enforcement, communications,\nretail, casinos, utilities, sports, and more. Below are a couple\nof real-life uses of SAS within some of these industries.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A leading medical device company utilizes SAS \"for\nclinical study data analysis\" (K. Kleckner, personal\ncommunication, February 1, 2014). This same company\nfurthermore uses the software \"for setting sample sizes\nfor pre-clinical studies and human clinical studies; [and]\nfor setting controls on manufacturing operations\" (K.\nKleckner, personal communication, February 1, 2014).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A global appliance manufacturer uses SAS for quality\ncontrol by performing predictive analyses of product\ndefects (J. Ward, personal communication, January\nR\nWhat Is R?\nR is a free, open-source statistical software. Colleagues at the\nUniversity of Auckland in New Zealand, Robert Gentleman\nand Ross Ihaka, created the software in 1993 because they\nmutually saw a need for a better software environment for\ntheir classes. R has certainly outgrown its origins, now boast-\ning more than 2 million users according to an R Community\nCost\nR is free and is downloadable from the Internet. To repeat, it\nhas no subscription fees, user limits, or license managers.\nHowever, this presents a danger. As open-source software, R\ncould be a security concern for large companies because the\nsoftware can be freely used, changed, and shared by\nanyone.\nLike SAS, R can be expensive in a form other than mon-\netary. While the base for R is very easy to install, users must\ndownload packages to perform specific analyses, which can\nbe very time-consuming (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013).\nFor example, as of this article, there are 5,508 available\npackages, and this number grows weekly if not daily\n(Comprehensive R Archive Network, 2014). This provides\nmany options, but searching through the assemblage of\nchoices can be difficult and time-consuming. One of the\nstrengths of R is its ability to find packages that have very\nspecific solutions or we may generate solutions.\nTraining\nAgain, like SAS, the training necessary for effectively using\nR depends on the previous computing experience of the\ntrainee. Computing experience is helpful because data analy-\nsis in R requires writing functions and scripts, not just\nTable 3.

In many ways,\nthough, R is comparable with other programming languages.\nFor instance, similar to many other languages, it is a com-\nmand line interface. In addition, its source code is similar to\nthat of C and Fortran, and it supports matrix arithmetic and\ndata structures like APL and MATLAB. Having used any of\nthese in the past could lessen the training time necessary to\nlearn R. As stated with SAS above, though, having any pro-\ngramming experience at all often will speed up the learning\nprocess for trainees as programming problems are a com-\npletely different type of puzzle.\nSources report varied answers when identifying the train-\ning necessary to successfully utilize R. Some believe that R\ndoes not necessitate much knowledge of computer program-\nming after all. For example, Daryl Pregibon of Google testi-\nfies that R \"allows statisticians to do very intricate and\ncomplicated analyses without knowing the blood and guts of\ncomputing systems.\" He is saying that packages abstract the\nprogrammer from the implementation of specific tools (deci-\nsion trees/forests, etc.). Ashlee Vance of The New York Times\ninforms, \"R has quickly found a following because statisti-\ncians, engineers and scientists without computer program-\nming skills find it easy to use\" (Vance, 2009). R is, after all,\nnot as daunting as other languages, having very natural and\nexpressive syntax for data analysis. The syntax is not very\ncommon to traditional programmers. Some programmers\nmay even label its syntax as quirky. In R language,\n\"anova(object_1, object_2)\" produces an ANOVA table,\n\"coef(object)\" extracts the regression coefficient, and\n\"plot(object)\" produces plots showing residuals, fitted val-\nues, and other diagnostics (\"An Introduction to R,\" 2014).\nStill, R does require the use of objects, operators, and func-\ntions before applying these intuitive commands.\nFortunately--as stated earlier--many packages are available\nfor download and use off the Internet, so users do not neces-\nsarily have to know the code or write it. This is another rea-\nson why some people say that R does not require much\nprogramming knowledge.\nHowever, because of errors in some of these packages and\nlack of user support for R, others believe that advanced train-\ning investment is necessary to use the software. Two people\nwho hold this viewpoint are Loomis Lofland and Ottesen,\nwho say,\n[R] users rely on what others put out there about the software. . . .\nPackages are not written by the R Development Core-Team;\ntherefore, they are not well polished and some could have\nquestionable validity. It is also difficult to direct an issue to a\nparticular person or support system. (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen,\nAlthough R may be usable without much coding experi-\nence, when a problem arises, the lack of programming\nknowledge will become evident and costly due to a dearth of\ndocumentation and technical support for resolving the issue.\nIn other words, people without sufficient knowledge of the R\nprogramming language can implement the syntax in their\nown use, but they do not necessarily have solid understand-\ning of what the code actually says. This lack of R coding\nknowledge makes debugging difficult if not impossible, and\nit could lead to erroneous results with severe decision-making\nconsequences.\nLoomis Lofland and Ottesen also explain that report writ-\ning in R is difficult. They claim that the extensive program-\nming required to code a report in R is quite a time investment,\nas \"R does not have a defined way of producing reports\"\nStatistical Method/Tests/Uses\nR is a comprehensive statistical analysis toolkit. It can per-\nform any statistical analysis desired, but users must either\nwrite the code or access the code from someone who has\nalready written it. As stated on its website, people have\nalready designed many standard data analysis tools \"from\naccessing data in various formats, to data manipulation\n(transforms, merges, aggregations, etc.), to traditional and\nmodern statistical models (regression, ANOVA, GLM, tree\nmodels, etc.; \"Why Use R?\" 2014)\". Actually, programmers\nhave designed many more packages than just these. As stated\nearlier in this section, programmers have already coded\n5,508 packages. These include packages for Bayesian statis-\ntics, time-series analysis, simulation-based analysis, spatial\nstatistics, survival analysis, and many, many more\n(Comprehensive R Archive Network, 2014). For a complete\nlist of packages already designed for R, visit http://cran.us.r-\nproject.org/web/packages/.\nThe key feature of R that differentiates it from other sta-\ntistical softwares is its acceptance of customization. On one\nhand, the aforementioned software have \"data-in-data-out\nblack-box procedures\" (\"Why Use R?\" 2014). In other\nwords, the developers have written the code for a certain\nfunction, such as performing decomposition for a time-series\nmodel, and users have never seen this built-in code that runs\nin the background. All they need to do is use a \"decomp\"\ncommand, or something of the sort, and the statistical pack-\nage will perform the decomposition for them. However, R is\nan interactive language. It requires users to write the code\n(for the decomposition, or whatever procedure desired) or to\npaste the code in from someone who already wrote it.\nBecause the function's code is visible in their command box,\nusers can manipulate the commands however they see fit.\nThus, R enables experimentation and exploration by allow-\ning users to improve the software's code or to write varia-\ntions for specific tasks. They can even mix-and-match\nmodels for better results. With the prepackaged functions in\nthe other statistical software, this is not as easy.\nAfter completing a statistical analysis with R, the soft-\nware is known for generating appealing charts and tables.\nThe custom charting capabilities of R create \"stunning\ninfographics seen in The New York Times, The Economist,\nand the FlowingData blog\" (Revolution Analytics, 2014).\nWith R, though, it is important to acknowledge that it can-\nnot manage messy data as easily as other available statistical\nsoftware. Loomis Lofland and Ottesen warn,\nThe design of R was focused around statistical computing and\ngraphics, so data management tends to be time consuming and\nnot as clean as SAS. . . . Students who have used solely R have\nan unrealistic expectation of the state of the data they receive.\nBut, once the data is organized, as stated, R is an invalu-\nable data analysis performer and graphics creator.\nSpecific Uses in Industry\nThe usage of R across diverse domains is undeniable. A New\nYork Times article cites its practice in major companies, like\nGoogle, Pfizer, Merck, Bank ofAmerica, the InterContinental\nhotels Group, and Shell (Vance, 2009). For specific exam-\nples, see below.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Google \"taps R for help understanding trends in ad\npricing and for illuminating patterns in the search data\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Pfizer has engineered its own custom packages in R,\nwhich allows scientists to manipulate their own data\nduring nonclinical drug studies instead of hiring a\nstatistician to do the work for them (Vance, 2009).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A financial services company utilizes dozens of R\npackages to perform derivatives analysis (Vance,\nConclusion\nExcel add-ins are well suited to small companies and small\nprojects because of their availability and low cost, while\nSPSS, SAS, and R work well for large projects and large\nbusinesses because of their ability to handle large sums of\ndata efficiently. As discovered at the beginning of the article,\nExcel's MegaStat option can execute many important statis-\ntical procedures that people trying to interpret smaller data\nsets can utilize for low financial cost and training cost.\nHowever, as stated, MegaStat can only manage a certain\namount of data. Therefore, larger data sets, such as those\naccumulated by Wal-Mart and Facebook, require a higher\npowered software, like SPSS, SAS, or R. Differentiating\nbetween which of these software best fits the analysis of\nthese larger data sets depends on a number of factors, and\neach statistical package has its own strengths and weak-\nnesses. Hence, this article has investigated the cost, installa-\ntion procedure, training necessary, built-in packages, level of\ndesire to manipulate code, user support, importance of\nappealing graphics, and many other considerations in hopes\nof providing businesses and universities with details that can\nease their choices of software.\nImplications\nWith the tremendous (and growing) focus on big data in\ntoday's society, businesses, universities, and future students\nshould actively participate. Big data are a mixture of struc-\ntured and unstructured data and not just number of records.\nBig data capabilities go beyond the maximum number of\nrows and columns a software can handle. Big data consist of\nboth structured and unstructured data; the McKinsey Global\nCorporation explains why. It states,\nThe use of big data will become a key basis of competition and\ngrowth for individual firms. . . . From the standpoint of\ncompetitiveness and the potential capture of value, all companies\nneed to take big data seriously. In most industries, established\ncompetitors and new entrants alike will leverage data-driven\nstrategies to innovate, compete, and capture value from deep\nand up-to-real-time information. Indeed, we found early\nexamples of such use of data in every sector we examined.\nNoncredit courses taught at Universities should also be\nincluded in the discussion of teaching these software, such as\nSPSS, SAS, and R. To repeat, businesses are leveraging big\ndata in every sector that McKinsey examined. Hence, busi-\nnesses need to take notice. McKinsey further explains,\nThere will be a shortage of talent necessary for organizations to\ntake advantage of big data. [By 2018,] we project that demand\nfor deep analytical positions in a big data world could exceed the\nIn other words, McKinsey estimates that by 2018, the\nUnited States will lack at least 140,000 people with expertise\nin big data. Big data analysis does not occur by hand, so\nMcKinsey essentially predicts that the United States could\nneed this many more people with expertise in software that\ncan handle big data. For this reason, colleges, universities,\nand future students should assume the preparatory measures\nnecessary to combat this deficit. After all, future students\nwith training from college and universities will need to fill\nthese gaps.\nThis article aimed to help businesses, schools, and stu-\ndents recognize what they can do to improve their perfor-\nmance and utility in this data-driven society. To begin, from\nthis article, businesses can learn the most effective tools to\nsuit their context. New businesses can learn the tools that\nthey should buy (or simply download), while older busi-\nnesses can learn the software that could better serve their\nneeds than the one they currently have. Finding the suitable\nsoftware is important because companies that employ the\nmost efficient data analysis software will compete better\nagainst competition, by effectively accessing and using their\nstockpiles of data to make better decisions.\nColleges and universities could improve job placement by\npreparing students in the specific software that hiring com-\npanies use. As seen in the introduction, the majority of com-\npanies use the software reported in this article. Therefore,\nschools would benefit from teaching students to use these\nsoftware.\nStudents can add a \"software taught\" category to their list\nof traits sought in higher education to prepare themselves for\njob placement. One of the most important decisions that\nfuture students make is selecting a major. Often, a student's\ndesired major can influence the selection set. However, other\ndecisions are growing in importance too. In terms of finding\na job, employers are increasingly seeking out recent gradu-\nates who have experience with big data software, like SPSS,\nSAS, and R. Therefore, it is becoming more important for\nstudents to seek out a university that will prepare them with\nknowledge of pertinent software, which will increase their\nlikelihood of finding a satisfying job. Obviously, careers in\nbig data will be abundant, so prepared students will have lit-\ntle trouble finding a job in that area. Nevertheless, students\ntrained on high demand software will have more and better\noptions for job placement.\nFuture Research\nWe plan to continue our research of software. While we\nacknowledge that no one software is suitable for every project\nwithin a specific sector of industry, we do believe that certain\nsoftware may be best matched to the majority of projects\nwithin an industry. By further surveying the use of software\nby particular businesses, we hope to discover which software\nis best suited to business, mathematics, statistics, engineering,\nand other majors. This information should benefit businesses,\nschools, and students. We would also like to compare this\nwith the software that academics use in their research.\nFurthermore, we will study database software in much the\nsame manner that we studied statistical software. As we sur-\nveyed businesses and universities about the statistical soft-\nware that they utilize and teach, respectively, many of these\nestablishments included database software in their responses.\nAfter all, database software serves as the means to organize\nthe data sets, so the ability to work with database software is\noften just as important as the ability to analyze the data sets\nwith statistical software.\nAlso, we will look at statistical software and their effective-\nness in teaching. This article has focused primarily on big data\nsoftware and their usefulness for finding a job within the busi-\nness world.Another avenue to explore is the feasibility of using\nthese software and others as tools for learning statistical con-\ncepts. Perhaps big data software such as SAS, SPSS, and R are\nextremely effective for business tasks, but they are not as effec-\ntive for learning statistical concepts in the classroom. Statistical\nsoftware that may better suit the classroom environment\ninclude Minitab or Statistica. An analysis of the pros and cons\nfor these software (and potentially others) is another future goal\nof ours.\n"
