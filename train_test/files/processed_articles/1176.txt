Although at least 60 minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical ac-\ntivity (MVPA) is recommended, few longitudinal studies have determined the recent\npatterns of physical activity of youth.\nObjective To determine the patterns and determinants of MVPA of youth followed\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Longitudinal descriptive analyses of the 1032\nparticipants in the 1991-2007 National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel-\nopment Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development birth cohort from 10 study\nsites who had accelerometer-determined minutes of MVPA at ages 9 (year 2000), 11\nfamilies.\nMain Outcome Measure Mean MVPA minutes per day, determined by 4 to 7 days\nof monitored activity.\nResults At age 9 years, children engaged in MVPA approximately 3 hours per day\non both weekends and weekdays. Weekday MVPA decreased by 38 minutes per year,\nwhile weekend MVPA decreased by 41 minutes per year. By age 15 years, adoles-\ncents were only engaging in MVPA for 49 minutes per weekday and 35 minutes per\nweekend day. Boys were more active than girls, spending 18 and 13 more minutes\nper day in MVPA on the weekdays and weekends, respectively. The rate of decrease\nin MVPA was the same for boys and girls. The estimated age at which girls crossed\nbelow the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA per day was approximately 13.1 years\nfor weekday activity compared with boys at 14.7 years, and for weekend activity, girls\ncrossed below the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA at 12.6 years compared with\nConclusion In this study cohort, measured physical activity decreased significantly\nMorganton, North Carolina; and (10)\nMadison, Wisconsin.

Accelerometer-determined\nphysical activity was offered to the en-\nParticipationinwearingthemonitorwas\ntowearmonitorshadatleast4validdays\nof data; the comparable numbers at ages\nmost often given for refusing to wear the\nmonitors were inconvenience and con-\ncernsfortheappearancearoundthewaist\nslightly lower participation of adoles-\ncents wearing the monitor has been\nnoted in other studies.16\nParticipants wore the monitor on a\nbelt around the waist during waking\nhours for 7 days, including 2 weekend\ndays and 5 weekdays, excluding show-\nering, bathing, water sports, or con-\ntact sports. These constraints on wear-\ning the monitor (common to all\naccelerometer studies) resulted from\nmanufacturers' suggestions and safety\nconcerns (eg, possible bruising or in-\njury). Decisions about when to re-\nmove monitors were made by partici-\npants and coaches. Information from\nparticipant activity logs and patterns of\nobserved counts indicate that the de-\ngree of underestimation of overall ac-\ntivity was minimal, and only for a few\nchildren during 1 or 2 days of the total\nactivity recorded.\nThe number of counts recorded by\nthe accelerometer was used to esti-\nmate the energy expended in moder-\nvery vigorous (9.0 METs) activity,\nbased on the age-specific equation of\n count  age in years)].\nAccelerometer data were down-\nloaded to the same computer used to\ninitialize them. A complete day of ac-\ntivity data was defined as extending\nfrom the first nonzero accelerometer\ncount after 5 AM until one of the fol-\nlowing criteria was met: (1) 60 con-\nsecutive minutes of zero counts after 9\nPM; (2) 30 consecutive minutes of zero\ncounts after 10 PM; or (3) the last non-\nzero count before midnight, which-\never came first. Once the number of\nminutes for any given day was calcu-\nlated, the total number of accelerom-\neter counts was computed; then in-\nvalid days (too short a measurement\ntime, implausible total count for the\ntime recorded, zero counts, or any rec-\nord shorter than 4 days) were flagged\nfor removal. Rules for removal were\nbased on patterns observed from vi-\nsual inspection of the data for 9-year-\nold children.\nAfter calculating the total number of\nminutes spent wearing the monitor and\nnumber of minutes spent in moder-\nate, vigorous, or very vigorous activ-\nity, these minutes were summed to rep-\nresent the total amount of time each\nchild spent each day in MVPA. The\nmean minutes per day of MVPA was\ncalculated and used as the index of total\nactivity for each day the monitor was\nworn. Mean minutes were then com-\nputed for weekdays and for weekends.\nBetween-day intraclass reliability co-\nefficients were calculated following the\nprocedures outlined in Baumgart-\nner.18 Four-day reliabilities for min-\nliabilities averaged 0.81, and 2-weekend\nday reliabilities averaged 0.54 across\nthe estimated reliabilities for weekend\nMVPA are only moderate, the method\nused to produce the estimates was not\noptimal in that data collected on Sat-\nurdays was compared with data col-\nlected on Sundays and the structure of\nactivity in most US households tends\nto be different on those 2 weekend days.\nBecause the data collected from par-\nticipants indicates no less consistency\nin compliance with protocols for wear-\ning of accelerometers on weekdays and\nweekends, it is likely that the week-\nend data are as valid an indicator of\nweekend physical activity (on aver-\nage) as the weekday data are as an in-\ndicator of weekday activity.\nStatistical Procedures\nAll statistical analyses were conducted\nby using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Insti-\ntute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and all\nhypotheses were tested using 2-sided\ntests. Significant differences between\nchildren who had activity data and those\nwho did not were determined for all cat-\negorical variables using 2 tests and\nFisher exact test when cell counts were\nsmall. Differences in continuous vari-\nables between these groups were deter-\nmined using t tests assuming unequal\nvariance or the Kruskal-Wallis test.19\nFor descriptive purposes, minutes of\nMVPA on weekdays and weekend days\nwere categorized as follows: less than\none-half hour, one-half to 1 hour, 1 to\n2 hours, and more than 2 hours. This\npermitted calculation of the percent-\nage meeting the 60-minute guideline\nand easily understood intervals reflect-\ning the range of MVPA over the ages\nmeasured.\nTo examine weekday and weekend\npatterns of MVPA longitudinally from\nages 9 to 15 years and to explore the\neffects of demographic factors on ac-\ntivity, 5 quadratic growth curve mod-\nels20 were constructed for both week-\ndays and weekends by using PROC\nMIXED (SAS Institute Inc). This al-\nlowed the calculation of a mean trajec-\ntory of weekday and weekend min-\nutes of MVPA as well as the estimation\nof each child's weekday and weekend\ntrajectory. All models used restricted\nmaximum likelihood estimates, which\nresults in a less biased estimate be-\ncause both fixed and random effects are\ntreated as unknowns. We tested the\nbaseline model with a homoscedastic\nerror structure against the baseline\nmodel with a heteroscedastic error\nstructure by using the likelihood ratio\ntest and determined that the heteros-\ncedastic error structure improved the\nmodel fit for both the weekday and\nweekends (P.001). As a result, all\nmodels were run assuming unequal re-\nsidual variance and an unstructured co-\nvariance matrix.\nThe first (baseline) models were qua-\ndratic models with age treated as a con-\ntinuous variable. The weekday model\ncan be expressed as:\nyij\n=\n (\n)(centered\nageij\n)  \n(centered ageij\nwhere yij\nis the expected mean week-\nday minutes of MVPA at time i for child\nj; centered ageij\nis the child's age cen-\ntered at the age 9 year assessment for\nchild j at time i; \nis the mean week-\nday minutes of MVPA at the age 9 year\nassessment (fixed intercept); u0j\nis the\nrandom intercept for child j; \nis the\nlinear rate of change in mean weekday\nminutes of MVPA (fixed slope); u1j\nis\nthe random linear slope for child j; \nis the acceleration in the change of mean\nweekday minutes of MVPA (fixed ac-\nceleration); and rij\nis the residual term\nfor child j at time i.\nThe weekend model can be ex-\npressed as:\nyij\n=\n \n(centered ageij\n) \n\n(centered ageij\nand differs from the weekday model in\nthat \nrepresents the mean weekend\nminutes of MVPA at the age 9 year as-\nsessment (fixed intercept) and \nrep-\nresents the acceleration in the change\nof mean weekend minutes of MVPA\n(fixed acceleration). We were unable to\ntreat age as a random effect in the week-\nend models because the intercept and\nslope were highly correlated and the\nvariance of the centered age param-\neter was not significant, leading to con-\nvergence problems. The high negative\ncorrelation between the intercept and\nlinear slope indicated that the rate of\ndecline in mean weekend minutes of\nMVPA was greater for those children\nwho had more minutes of MVPA on the\nweekends at age 9 years.\nModel 2 added sex as a fixed covar-\niate predicting intercepts and linear\nslopes. Model 3 replaced sex with low\nincome status at age 9 years as the\ncovariate predicting the intercepts and\nlinear slopes. Model 4 examined the\ncombined predictive ability of sex, low\nincome, mother's education, race/\nethnicity, region, BMI percentile, low\nincome by sex interaction, low in-\ncome by BMI percentile interaction, and\nlow income by region interaction all\npredicting the intercepts and linear\nslopes. Model 5 examined whether sex\nmoderated any of the findings from\nmodel 4 by adding interactions with sex\nto all the terms in model 4; only 1 of\nthe interactions was significant and\nmodel fit was not improved (data not\nshown). For all models, continuous co-\nvariates were centered: mother's edu-\ncation was centered at the mean edu-\ncation level and BMI percentile was\ngrand mean centered. All interaction\nvariables were calculated by using the\ncentered variables.21 At each time point,\nchildren who had valid accelerometer\ndata were excluded from the growth\ncurve model if they were missing data\non any of the covariates included in the\nmodel. As a result, the number of chil-\ndren included varies across the models.\nCorrelations between the estimated\nrandom effects from the baseline model\n(model 1) for weekday and weekend in-\nterceptsandweekdayslopewerealsoex-\namined. Paired t tests were used to test\nfor mean differences between the week-\nday and weekend intercepts for the first\n3 models (baseline, sex, and income).\nRESULTS\nTABLE 1describesthestudycohort.Rela-\ntively more girls than boys had valid ac-\ncelerometer data at age 9 years, and rela-\ntively more boys than girls had valid\naccelerometer data at age 15 years.

Nonetheless,\nwhen differences for income, BMI per-\ncentile, and geographic region were\ntranslated into minutes per day per year,\nthe magnitude of effect was small. Each\nof these effects was linked to a de-\ncrease in MVPA of less than 4 minutes\nper day per year on the weekdays and\nless than 5 minutes per day per year on\nthe weekends.\nDecreasinglevelsofMVPAhavebeen\nshowninotherstudies.Themostrecent\nNationalHealthandNutritionalExami-\nnation Survey (NHANES) data22 using\naccelerometer-measuredphysicalactiv-\nity in a representative US sample also\nrevealedthatphysicalactivitydecreases\ndramaticallyacrossagegroupsbetween\nchildhood and adolescence and con-\ntinues to decrease into adulthood. For\nexample, using a higher cutoff of METs\nrequired to determine MVPA, the\nNHANES results showed that 42% of\nchildren aged 6 to 11 years obtained the\nrecommended 60 minutes per day of\nphysical activity, whereas only 8% of\nadolescentsachievedthisgoal.22 Among\nadults, adherence to the recommenda-\ntion to obtain 30 minutes per day of\nphysical activity is less than 5%.22 In\naddition, earlier cross-sectional stud-\nies conducted on smaller samples of\nboth US and European youth docu-\nmenteddecreasingactivitywithincreas-\ning age, with evidence indicating that\nboys are more active than girls.23-28 The\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention Youth Risk Behavior Surveys\nandotherlargesamplestudiesthatmea-\nsure physical activity using self-\nreport29,30 also find activity to decrease\nwith age, but the overall amount of\nMVPA reported in these studies tends\nto be much higher than accelerometer-\nbased studies.\nA particular strength of our study lies\nin the repeated examination and longi-\ntudinal analysis of physical activity dur-\ning both weekdays and weekend days at\nbornwhentheobesityepidemicwaswell\nunder way. Another strength derives\nfrom our use of objective accelerometer\nmeasurement of physical activity in a\nmuch larger sample with a higher mean\nadherence rate for wearing the monitor\nover 7 days (55%) than the recent\nOur study has limitations. First, our\nsample is not nationally representa-\ntive because the study sites were se-\nlected on the basis of National Insti-\ntutes of Health review; therefore, the\nfindings are not fully generalizable to\nthe US population. That said, the re-\ncruited sample closely matched the US\npopulation at the time of initial recruit-\nment with regard to income and race/\nethnicity. Moreover, the sample was di-\nverseinethnicity,socioeconomicstatus,\nand household membership. Unfortu-\nnately, there were relatively small num-\nbers of certain racial/ethnic minori-\nties, limiting the ability to analyze\nsubsamples.\nSecond, an unavoidable bias is due\nto the fact that accelerometers tend to\nunderestimate activity of youth who fre-\nquently engage in contact sports or\nswimming because the accelerometer\nis not worn at these times. Whether the\nnumbers of such children increase with\nage is unknown, but this factor is un-\nlikely to account for the dramatic de-\ncrease in overall activity noted. Chil-\ndren would have had to engage in\ncontact sports for a significant num-\nber of hours every monitored day to in-\nfluence the results for overall activity.\nThird, separating age from secular\ntrends in longitudinal data is techni-\ncally difficult. Because of the historic\ntiming of data collection for this study\n(ie, during the rapid escalation of obe-\nsity in the United States), it is possible\nthat declining trajectories in MVPA may\nrepresent a secular rather than a devel-\nopmental phenomenon. However, ac-\ncelerometer data collected as part of the\nNHANES cross-sectional study in a\nterns of decline in physical activity in\nchildren between ages 6 to 11 years and\nA fourth potential limitation per-\ntains to the uncertain reliability of week-\nend MVPA data.

Generally speaking,\nchildren appear to be slightly less ac-\ntive on weekends than on weekdays,\nsuggesting that families may not be en-\ncouraging children to engage in active\nplay or that weekend competing pri-\norities result in less activity.\nAccelerometers are a new method to\nmeasure physical activity for public\nhealth purposes. The technology has\ncontinued to develop and has im-\nproved since our study was initiated in\ntocol across studies for setting acceler-\nometer-based cutoff points for MVPA.31\nThe study by Pate et al32 found that ap-\nplying different cutoff points resulted in\nsignificant differences in the classifica-\ntion of sixth grade girls meeting the 60-\nminuterecommendation(estimatesvar-\nrespectively, depending on whether the\nor 3.0 MET). In our study, we used the\n3.0 MET cutoff, reflecting the most lib-\neral cutoff point. However, striking de-\ncreases in activity were observed from\nnority of adolescents were meeting the\nrecommended 60 minutes per day of\nMVPA, even by the most liberal stan-\ndard. Other than the study by Strong\net al,9 there is limited data substantiat-\ning the 60-minute recommendation in\nterms of important clinical outcomes.\nThus, one task for future research in this\narea is to examine the amount of MVPA\nrequired to affect child health out-\ncomes.\nMore research is also needed to\nunderstand the reasons for such sub-\nstantial decreases in youth activity. Fur-\nther study and more precise descrip-\ntions of the immediate activity\nenvironment,suchaswhetheryouthare\nlocated in urban, suburban, or rural\nareas; availability of safe places to be\nactive; and quality of school-based\nphysical education may explain\nsome of the individual and regional\ndifferences noted in this and other\nstudies.\nThe data in our cohort confirm a sig-\nnificant decrease of activity from ages\n9 to 15 years in the United States. This\ndecrease augurs poorly for levels of\nphysical activity in US adults and po-\ntentially for health over the course of\na lifetime. Consequently, there is a need\nfor program and policy action as early\nas possible at the family, community,\nschool, health care, and governmental\nlevels to address the problem of de-\ncreasing physical activity with increas-\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Nader had full access to all\nof the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data\nanalysis.\nStudy concept and design: Nader, Bradley, Houts,\nO'Brien.\nAcquisition of data: Nader, Bradley, O'Brien.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Nader, Bradley,\nHouts, McRitchie, O'Brien.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Nader, Houts, McRitchie.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Nader, Bradley, Houts, McRitchie,\nO'Brien.\nStatistical analysis: Nader, Houts, McRitchie.\nObtained funding: Nader, Bradley, O'Brien.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Nader,\nBradley, O'Brien.\nStudy supervision: Nader, Bradley, Houts, O'Brien.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This study was directed by the\nNICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Devel-\nopment Steering Committee and supported by the Eu-\nnice Kennedy Shriver NICHD through a cooperative\nagreement (U10), which calls for scientific collabora-\ntion between the grantees and the NICHD staff (http:\n//secc.rti.org).
