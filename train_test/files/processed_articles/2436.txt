Psychosocial stress is a known risk factor\nfor hypertension,[3] but little is known about stressors that occur\nover important developmental time periods such as the transition\nfrom adolescence to adulthood. Since high blood pressure has\nbeen shown to track from from adolescence into adulthod,[5]\ngreater understanding of the potential early life psychosocial\ncontributors to elevated blood pressure is warranted.\nPrior research on the relationship between IPV and elevated\nblood pressure has focused on adult violence exposure and has\nfound limited,[6] or no support for the association.[7\u00ad12] Existing\nresearch on the topic, however, is hindered by a predominance of\ncross-sectional designs and a lack of objectively measured blood\npressure outcomes. Sex differences in the relationship between\nIPV and hypertension have been largely unexplored due to\nfemale-only samples which comprise a majority of the literature.\nThe impact of being in a mutually violent relationship, a defining\nfeature in up to half of violent relationships,[13\u00ad15] and the role of\nperpetration have not been examined. Therefore, more questions\nthan answers remain as to whether IPV is related to blood pressure\nand hypertension status.\nThis study addresses these gaps by investigating sex differences\nin the relationship between exposure to IPV victimization and\nperpetration in adolescence and young adulthood (between\naverage ages 16 and 22) and blood pressure outcomes (systolic\nblood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), incident\nhypertension) in adulthood (average age 29).\nMaterials and Methods\nSample\nAdolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a longitudinal\nstudy of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades\n12,288 participants who participated in baseline and waves 3 and\nIPV status was ascertained and of these 9,699 were selected for this\nanalysis because they had non-missing values on covariates. For\nthe incident hypertension analyses, the sample size was restricted\nto participants without a self-reported health provider diagnosis of\nhigh blood pressure or hypertension at Wave 3 (N = 9,157).\nEthics Statement\nParticipants provided written informed consent. The original\nstudy was approved by the institutional review board of the\nUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\nMeasures\nBlood Pressure and Hypertension. Blood pressure was\nmeasured at Wave 4. A detailed description of the methods\ninvolved, including cuff size, arm position and observer training\nhas been published elsewhere.[17] Briefly, three readings at 30-\nsecond intervals were taken after a 5-minute seated rest using a\nfactory calibrated, Microlife BP3MC1-PC-IB oscillometric blood\npressure monitor; the last two readings were averaged and used in\nanalyses. Three percent (n = 296) of participants reported using\nantihypertensive medication per a medication review;[18] there-\nfore, their underlying blood pressure is unknown. It is common to\nremove such observations from analyses. However, doing so has\nbeen shown to introduce negative bias and reduce power.[19]\nAdding a constant that represents a realistic estimate of the\ntreatment effect has been shown to substantially mitigate these\nlimitations.[19] Therefore, a constant was added to the treated\nblood pressure measurements representing the average efficacy of\na standard dose of antihypertensive medication (9 mmHg for SBP\nand 6 mmHg for DBP).[20] Hypertension was defined by SBP$\n140 mmHg, DBP$90 mmHg, or taking antihypertensive medi-\ncation.\nIntimate Partner Violence. Frequency of physical and\nsexual IPV and IPV-related injury was assessed at the Wave 3\ninterview using 4 items measuring victimization (threatened by\npartner with violence, pushed or shoved, or had something thrown\nat you that could hurt; partner slapped, hit or kicked you; partner\nmade you have sexual relations when you did not want to; you had\nan injury, such as a sprain, bruise, or cut because of a fight with\nyour partner) and 4 parallel items measuring the participant's\nperpetration of IPV based on the Revised Conflict Tactics\nScales.[21] IPV was assessed in relationships that had occurred\nbetween summer 1995 (average participant age 16 years) and the\nWave 3 interview (average participant age 22 years). Relationships\nchosen for assessment involved sexual intercourse, were current\nrelationships of individuals selected for a couple's sub-sample, or\nwere considered ``important '' which was defined as those being\nlonger term, recent, or involved marriage, co-habitation, or\nresulted in a pregnancy.\nRasch modeling was used to construct continuous scales of\nviolence victimization and perpetration by modeling the condi-\ntional probabilities of responding yes to each item given its severity\nand the true but unobserved violence exposure level of each\nperson. Items that are less frequently reported are treated as being\nmore severe than those more frequently reported. The nature of\nphysical violence supports this treatment since acts of low/\nmoderate violence severity are the most common forms of IPV\namong dating and married couples in the U.S.[22,23] The model\nis generalized to account for whether the event occurred in more\nthan one relationship and more than once in a relationship.[24]\nIncorporating all available information creates a more parsimo-\nnious model that better discriminates between adolescents with\nlow and high violence exposure and produces more adequate\nspread of items along the linear measurement summary scale.\nRasch modeling has been used to create scales of violence\nexposure among children, and for war related trauma and\nThe victimization and perpetration scores were combined into\none variable with the following categories: no exposure; moderate\nvictimization and/or perpetration; severe victimization but not\nsevere perpetration; severe perpetration but not severe victimiza-\ntion; and both severe victimization and perpetration. Since there\nare no defined cut points for severe IPV using Rasch modeling,\nsevere IPV was delineated by the 66th percentile of the score\namong those reporting any exposure determined separately for\nmen and women. Additional cut points were also examined to\nascertain whether study findings were dependent upon the cut\npoint.\nOther Covariates. Sociodemographic variables included sex,\nself-reported race/ethnicity (categorized by the authors as\nHispanic, Non-Hispanic white, black and other) and Wave 3\nmeasures of age, educational attainment, and financial distress,\ndefined by an affirmative response to any of 7 situations in which\nthe respondent's household was unable to pay for various\nhousehold and medical expenses.\nStatistical Analysis\nStudy variables were tabulated by exposure to IPV and sex.\nChi-square tests were used to examine sex differences in IPV\nvictimization and perpetration. Multivariable linear regression was\nused to test the relationship between IPV reported at Wave 3 and\nblood pressure assessed at Wave 4 adjusting for confounders (age,\nrace-ethnicity, education, financial distress). Analyses were per-\nformed separately by sex given documented differences in\nwomen's and men's exposure to IPV[27,28] and sex differences\nin emotional, behavioral, and physiologic responses to\nstress.[23,28] Logistic regression was used to test the relationship\nbetween IPV and incident hypertension among participants who\nhad not reported a health provider diagnosis of high blood\npressure or hypertension at Wave 3. All models were repeated\nusing alternate cut points for severe IPV (50th and 80th percentiles).\nDesign effects and unequal probability of selection were accounted\nfor according to Add Health user guidance.[29]\nResults\n22.06) years.

Compared to whites, blacks and Hispanics were\nmore likely to be in the severe perpetration category and blacks\nand Hispanic women were more likely to have experienced both\nsevere victimization and perpetration than no IPV exposure.\nThose who reported no violence exposure also reported less\nfinancial distress and greater educational attainment than those\nexposed to IPV. Compared to men exposed to IPV, men not\nexposed to IPV had lower mean SBP and DBP. Mean SBP and\nDBP did not significantly differ across levels of IPV exposure for\nwomen.\nIn models adjusting for confounders (Table 3), men experienc-\ning both severe victimization and severe perpetration had a\nwith no IPV exposure. Findings were similar for DBP although the\nmagnitude of the effect was smaller and not statistically significant.\nThe other categories of IPV were not statistically associated with\nblood pressure in men and IPV was not associated with blood\npressure in women. Findings were robust to choice of severity cut\npoint (Figures 1 & 2).\nAmong 9,157 participants not reporting hypertension in Wave\nmodels, men who had experienced both severe victimization and\n2.37) of hypertension in adulthood compared to those who had not\nexperienced IPV. The other categories of IPV were not statistically\nassociated with blood pressure or incident hypertension in men\nand IPV was not associated with incident hypertension in women.\nThe increased odds of hypertension among men exposed to both\nvictimization and perpetration was robust to the choice of severity\ncut point.\nDiscussion\nThis study found that joint exposure to both severe victimiza-\ntion and severe perpetration during adolescence or young\nadulthood is associated with higher blood pressure and incident\nhypertension in men. These findings make a unique contribution\nto the literature on the physical health impact of IPV and are\nstrengthened by the use of data from a large, nationally\nrepresentative sample, objectively assessed blood pressure out-\ncomes, and assessment of IPV prior to the measurement of blood\npressure. Additional strengths include the examination of sex\ndifferences and joint modeling of IPV severity and directionality.\nIn this study, women were more likely than men to report\nvictimization and perpetration. The finding that more women\nthan men report IPV victimization is similar to criminal justice\nstatistics[30] and numerous large nationally-representative stud-\nies,[15,23,31] including prior research using Add Health da-\nta.[13,32] The finding that more women than men report\nperpetrating IPV is consistent with a meta-analysis on sex\ndifferences in perpetration,[27] other studies using nationally\nrepresentative data,[15] and prior Add Health research.[13]\nGendered differences in reporting may account for this finding.\nIn prior research, men have been shown to underreport their\nperpetration of IPV,[28] potentially leading to misclassification.\nIn the present study, men had higher blood pressures and\nhigher rates of incident hypertension compared to women which is\nconsistent with existing literature.[3] However, 19% of the sample\nhad hypertension, which is higher than other nationally represen-\ntative samples of young adults ages 25\u00ad32 including NHANES\n(4.60%).[33] Prior Add Health research on this topic suggests that\nmasked hypertension, measurement techniques, and sample\ncomposition might account for the differences.[33]\nTable 1.

Women generally\nreport greater distress[23] and are more likely to smoke[34] and\ndrink alcohol[35] in response to violence \u00ad plausible mediators of\nthe hypothesized violence \u00ad blood pressure relationship. While not\nsignificant, study findings did suggest that when a very high cut\npoint is used to determine severity, that blood pressure might be\nelevated among women who have been severely victimized. This\nfinding was not statistically significant potentially due to low power\ngiven the small number of women reporting this level of exposure.\nIPV related changes in blood pressure have been noted in an older\ncohort of women (ages 25\u00ad42).[6] Older women are at greater risk\nof high blood pressure than younger women[3] and may have had\nlonger-term exposure to IPV. Hemodynamic impacts of IPV may\nbe detectable only among older women. The measurement of IPV\nused in this study might also have hampered this exploration.\nWhile the study did incorporate IPV items that disproportionately\nimpact women, such as sexual violence and injuries, it did not\nmeasure emotional abuse.The only prior study to find a\nTable 2.

On balance,\nstudy findings do not provide strong support for a relationship\nbetween IPV and blood pressure outcomes in young women.\nFurther research that includes emotional abuse and that followed\nwomen into midlife could clarify this relationship.\nIn the present study, the most robust associations were among\nmen. The only prior examination of sex differences found no\nrelationship between IPV victimization and self-reported diagnosis\nof high BP in men[35] similar to the findings of the present study.\nHowever, among men exposed to both severe victimization and\nperpetration, blood pressure levels and the odds of incident\nhypertension were consistently higher than in those without IPV\nexposure. The more consistent findings among men might be\nexplained by prior research on acute stress that found greater\nblood pressure responses in males than females.[36,37] However,\nprior research on marital stress has shown the opposite,[38] or no\nsex effect.[39,40] Prior research has not simultaneously modeled\nviolence victimization and perpetration and has examined sex\ndifferences in blood pressure in cohorts older than the Add Health\nparticipants. Since men are more likely than women to develop\nhigh blood pressure before the age of 45,[3] the impact of IPV\nmay be detectable only among men in this young cohort. Sex\ndifferences in violence reporting, combined with a high prevalence\nof relationships in which there is both victimization and\nperpetration suggest that research is needed that accounts for\nnuanced differences in men's and women's experiences of violence\nand how they relate to blood pressure outcomes. This study is a\nstep in that direction, but clearly additional research is needed.\nThe study's findings are tempered by several factors. Residual\nconfounding is possible and potential mediators such as smoking,\nexcessive alcohol usage, and body mass index were not examined.\nFurther research is needed to examine potential pathways linking\nsevere victimization and perpetration in men and blood pressure\nrelated outcomes. IPV was self-reported since most violent\nincidents are not disclosed to verifiable sources such as service\nFigure 2. Difference in Blood Pressure by IPV Type and Cut Point, Women (N = 5338).\nTable 3.

The limited\nnumber of items used to measure IPV precludes the creation of\nseparate scores for physical and sexual violence. Since physical and\nsexual IPV frequently co-occur the study team chose to jointly\nmeasure these forms of violence to maximize the amount of data\nused to determine IPV exposure status. However, heterogeneity in\nthe impact of violence by type cannot be ruled out. This study did\nnot distinguish heterosexual from bi- or homosexual relationship\nhistory, which is a noteworthy focus of future research. Finally,\nblood pressure was only measured at Wave 4 so blood pressure\nchange from Wave 3 cannot be examined and the incident\nhypertension outcome used in this manuscript is based on\nmeasurements at a single point in time. A diagnosis of\nhypertension requires elevated blood pressure levels during at\nleast 2 clinic visits,[43] highlighting the need for clinical research\non this topic.\nConclusions\nThis study provides evidence that exposure to IPV is linked to\nelevated blood pressure and incident hypertension in men. While\nonly severe IPV was investigated in this study, the effect sizes range\nfrom 2 to 5 mmHg suggesting public health relevance since\naverage reductions of as little as 2 mmHg on a population basis\ncan meaningfully reduce cardiovascular disease and all-cause\nmortality.[44] Including men in IPV screening efforts and\nassessing both victimization and perpetration may provide a more\nnuanced understanding of individuals at increased risk of\nhypertension.\n"
