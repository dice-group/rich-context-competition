Neil,1 and\nM. Anthony C. Frankson1\nWe evaluated dietary and other risk factors in a black Califor?\nmortality follow-up continued through 1985. A study census\nquestionnaire was returned from 3,299 subjects who lived in a\nhousehold containing at least one Seventh-Day Adventist. Of\nthese, 1,668 subjects also completed a detailed life-style and\ndietary questionnaire in 1976.

Currently, there is little evidence that the\nhealth disadvantage experienced by black Americans\nstems from genetic differences at the population level,1\"4\nand it seems likely that potentially modifiable environ?\nmental factors underlie much of this problem.\nThe Adventist Health Study (AHS) is a prospective\ncohort study of black and white subjects living in Cali?\nfornia during 1974. Although the majority of subjects\nwere Seventh-Day Adventists, among black men partic?\nularly, a sizable minority group were not. The Adventist\nreligion prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco, and pork;\nmembers are strongly advised to adhere to a lacto-ovo-\nvegetarian diet and to avoid coffee, tea, and other caf-\nfeine-containing beverages. Nevertheless, there is a wide\nrange of dietary habits in populations that contain many\nFrom\nthe'Center\nforHealthResearch,\nLoma\nLinda\nUniversity,\nSchoolofPublic\nHealth,Loma\nLinda,\nCA,and2Diabetes\nSurveillance\nProgram,\nDeaconess\nMed?\nicalCenter,Spokane,\nAddress\nreprint\nrequests\nto:GaryE.Fraser,\nCenter\nforHealthResearch,\nSchool\nofPublic\nHealth,\nLinda\nUniversity,\nLoma\nLinda,\nThisresearch\nwaspartially\nsupported\nSubmitted\naccepted\nOctober\nResources\nInc.\nAdventists, an attractive situation in which to study the\nrelation between diet and chronic diseases.\nAlthough there have been many reports published\nfrom the Adventist Health Study over the last decade,\nthis is the first pertaining to black subjects. We examine\nassociations among demographic variables, cardiovascu?\nlar risk factors, diet, and all-cause mortality.\nSubjects and Methods\nA detailed description of methods has been published\npreviously.5 Using church directories, an attempt was\nmade in 1974 to contact all households in California\ncontaining at least one Adventist. A census question?\nnaire was mailed from the Adventist Health Study,\nrequesting information from all residents of these homes,\nirrespective of religion. In August 1976, a second ques?\ntionnaire, the life-style questionnaire, was mailed to the\n3,537 black subjects whose heads of households had\nresponded to the census questionnaire. This second\nquestionnaire sought further demographic as well as nu?\ntritional and life-style information. One thousand seven\nhundred forty (49.2%) of these subjects responded to the\nlife-style questionnaire. The equivalent response rate\namong non-Hispanic whites was 75.1%.\nExposure information relevant to our hypotheses was\nincluded in both the census and life-style questionnaires.\nThe census questionnaire included questions on age, sex,\nmarital status, and education. Nevertheless, the life-style\nquestionnaire contained the majority of relevant vari?\nables. These included a personal history of physician-\nLippincott Williams & Wilkins\nis collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve, and extend access to\nEpidemiology\nwww.jstor.org\n\u00ae\ndiagnosed heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hyperten?\nsion; self-reported height and weight; previous and\ncurrent cigarette smoking; and exercise and dietary hab?\nits. Exercise was categorized as low, moderate, or high;\nthis represents a cross-classification of two questions\nrelating to occupational and leisure activities. The fol?\nlowing questions were asked: \"Outside of your usual work\nor daily activities, do you usually get at least 15 minutes\nof vigorous exercise three or more times per week?\"\n(There followed a list of possible vigorous activities for\nthe subject to check whether he or she undertook these\nat least three times each week for 15 minutes on each\noccasion.) \"Does your usual daily work or responsibilities\ninvolve vigorous activities similar to those listed in the\nprevious question?\" (Responses were \"very often,\" \"fre?\nquently,\" \"occasionally,\" \"rarely,\" or \"never.\") \"High\"\nexercise required a \"very often\" response for vigorous\noccupational activity, and/or vigorous leisure activities\nat least three times each week; \"low\" exercise required\nno regular leisure exercise activity and vigorous activity\nat work only \"occasionally\" or less; responses of the\nremaining subjects were classified as moderate exercise.\nA semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was\ndeveloped to measure the unique diet6,7 of the Adventist\nHealth Study population. The subjects were asked to\nreport on the frequency of current use of 65 food items,\nwhich also inciuded beverages and vitamin supplements.\nMost foods were evaluated on a scale of 1-8, ranging\nfrom \"never consume\" to \"more than once per day,\"\nwhen subjects followed their \"usual routine.\" Foods per-\ntinent to these analyses inciuded \"nuts (except those\nused in recipes),\" \"beef steak,\" \"beef hamburger,\" \"other\nbeef or veal,\" \"fish,\" \"poultry (chicken or turkey),\" \"pork\nproducts,\" \"cheese (except cottage cheese),\" \"dried or\ncanned beans, lentils, split peas, etc,\" \"eggs (except\nthose used in recipes),\" \"tomatoes (fresh or canned),\"\n\"cooked green vegetables,\" \"green salads (tossed salad,\ncoleslaw, etc),\" \"canned or frozen fruit,\" \"raisins, dates,\nand other dried fruits,\" \"fresh citrus fruit (not juice),\"\n\"fresh fruit commonly available in winter (apples, ba-\nnanas, pears, etc),\" and \"other fresh fruit.\" For bread, the\nquestion read, \"What one type of bread do you use most\nof the time?\" with options being \"white,\" \"100% whole\nwheat or whoje grain,\" \"sprouted wheat or wheat berry,\"\nand \"other (rye, cracked wheat, pumpernickel, soy,\netc.).\" Responses for the various fruit and beef questions\nwere summed to form fruit and beef indexes. Alcohol\nconsumption was assessed using two questions ,\"beer and\nwine\" and \"hard liquor.\" As current consumption was\ngenerally very low in this population, \"alcohol\" was\nscored as \"never\" if there were \"never\" responses to both\nof the above variables, otherwise \"alcohol\" was scored as\n\"ever.\"\nUnlike the non-Hispanic white cohort, this black\ncohort was not systematically followed for specific inci?\ndent endpoints, although the baseline data were man-\naged in the same fashion, being double-entered to a\ncomputer file and verified. A vital status follow-up of\nthese study subjects was completed, however. In 1985,\ncards that inquired about residential location and vital\nstatus were mailed to 3,040 subjects. This population\ncorresponded to all respondents to the census question?\nnaire not already known to be dead and for whom a\ncurrent address could be found. When the original study\naddress was invalid, lists of such names were mailed to\nchurch clerks and also printed in church bulletins for the\nattention of congregations. Nonrespondents to the mail?\nings were telephoned where possible.\nThe investigators also gathered information from\nchurch clerks, friends, or relatives, both in California\nand out of state. The cohort was then matched to the\nCalifornia State death records. We used a computer\nprogram designed to link subjects' identities with those\non the state death tapes.8 Vital status was finally deter?\nmined for 93% of the subjects; the remaining 7% were\nconsidered lost to follow-up, as we had had no contact\nsince study baseline. Thus, the population that had been\nfollowed beyond baseline and who were included in the\nanalysis here comprised 3,299 subjects who responded to\nthe census questionnaire and 1,668 respondents to the\nlife-style questionnaire.\nWe used multivariate Cox proportional hazard sur?\nvival analyses9 to evaluate hazard ratios (HR) for expo?\nsure variables on all-cause mortality and to adjust for\npotentially confounding variables. We considered di?\netary and other variables as categorical rather than con?\ntinuous, as indicated in the tables. The proportionality\nrequirement was evaluated graphically by inspecting the\nlog-log plots for all exposure variables under study. Miss?\ning data were handled with the method described by\nResults\nThese results mainly arise from the life-style question?\nnaire and the population that completed this question?\nnaire. When the variables required for a particular anal?\nysis were all taken from the census questionnaire,\nhowever, we then took advantage of the larger number\nof subjects who completed this questionnaire and per?\nformed the analysis on the census population. The num?\nber of person-years at risk and the number of fatalities\ntabulated by age and sex are shown for both the census\nand life-style populations in Table 1. Table 2 shows a\nmean age of around 50 years, with women a little older\nthan men; the population completing both question?\nnaires was 2-3 years older than the total population.\nBoth study populations had more male college graduates,\nyet there was also a higher percentage of men with less\nthan an 8th grade education. There were more male\nnon-Adventists, owing to a larger number of female\nchurch members in households where only one of a\nmarried couple was Adventist. There was a marked\nexcess of both widowed and divorced women when\ncompared with men. Table 3 shows multivariate associ?\nations between these same variables and all-cause mor?\ntality, using the larger numbers of subjects and the 416\ndeaths from the census population. Men were disadvan-\ntaged (HR = 1.55) with respect to mortality, whereas\nbeing a college graduate was associated with a marked\nTABLE 1.

Non-\nAdventists living in Adventist households had a 40%\nincrease in risk of death when compared with Adventist\nhousehold members.\nThe remaining tables deal with variables found only\non the life-style questionnaire and the population who\ncompleted this questionnaire. Table 4 shows descriptive\ndata for several nondietary risk factors. A relatively high\nprevalence of hypertension was reported, greater in\nwomen than men. Men were more likely to be in the\nhigh-exercise category but also were more likely to be\ncurrent or past cigarette smokers, although current\nsmokers are uncommon. Women were more obese, as\njudged by body mass index [BMI; weight (kg) per height\nsquared (m2)].\nTable 5 shows the reported frequency of consumption\nof foods, for men and women separately. These results\nclearly depict the tendency to vegetarianism in this\npopulation, with a substantial minority of subjects con-\nTABLE 2.

As one\nmight expect, this population also\nconsumes nuts, fruits, legumes, and\ncooked green vegetables frequently.\nWe explored associations individu-\nally between each of these foods and\nall-cause mortality, when adjusted for\nage, current and past smoking habits,\nexercise, and sex (in combined analy?\nses). Results are shown in Table 6.\nFrequent consumption of nuts, fruit,\nand green salads was associated with\nlower hazard ratios for mortality,\nwhereas there was evidence of in?\ncreased hazard in those consuming\nmeat products or cheese.\nTable 7 shows a multivariate survival analysis, where\nthe available traditional nondietary risk factors are in?\ncluded in the model together. Men had a much higher\nmortality risk, but an effect of smoking on mortality was\nparticularly marked in women. Subjects with diabetes\nhad much higher mortality in both men and women,\nwhereas exercise was associated with lower mortality.\nWhen we excluded those with any history of heart\ndisease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, or arthritis present at\nbaseline, the possible reduction in risk with higher phys?\nical activity was further diminished, with HRs for low,\n0.96. About 25% of our subjects claimed to have some\nform of rheumatism or arthritis.\nWe found a positive linear trend between mortality\nand BMI in men, but there was a curvilinear association\nbetween BMI and mortality in women. These associa?\ntions were such that, for values of BMI of 20, 24, sex-\ndicted hazard ratios for mortality with\nboth sexes combined. Thus, obese\nblack men, thinner black women, and,\nto a lesser extent, very obese\nblack women had an increased mortal?\nity.\nDiscussion\nIn general, black Americans suffer\nhigher total mortality and higher mor?\ntality from many cancers, heart disease,\nAs far as we know, associations between\ndiet and all-cause mortality have not\npreviously been reported in black Amer?\nicans.

They include the Evans County Study,13,16 the\nCharleston Fleart Study,1718 the Multiple Risk Factor\nIntervention Trial screening program,11 and the Na?\ntional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nAmong the black Adventist Health Study subjects,\nseveral life-style, health, and dietary variables were im-\nportantly associated with all-cause mortality. In sum?\nmary, age and male gender were associated with in?\ncreased risk of death as expected, whereas higher\neducation and Adventist membership were associated\nwith lower risk. Increased mortality was associated with\nself-reported diabetes mellitus, self-reported high blood\npressure, BMI (in men), and current smoking status.\nTABLE 4.

There were 36,315 person-years of\nobservation in the census questionnaire respondents and\n15,893 in the life-style questionnaire respondents. The\ncompleteness of follow-up over 11 years was good, with\nvital status being established for 93% of subjects. The\npopulation includes both men and women with a broad\nage range and with a wide variety of dietary habits. The\nrelative absence of the possible confounding factors of\nalcohol and cigarette smoking is both unusual and po?\ntentially helpful.\nThe apparent protective effect of nut consumption in\nthis black population is of particular interest, given the\nreported consistent associations of similar magnitude in\nwhite study subjects for coronary heart disease20 and\nall-cause mortality.21 Possible mechanisms have been\ndescribed.22 The finding that black members of the Ad-\nventist Health Study cohort also gained protection from\nfrequent consumption of fruits and green salads is con?\nsistent with data from white subjects in this study,20,23-25\nand others,26 in that these foods appear to provide pro?\ntection from a variety of cancers. Such effects may in\npart be related to their content of fiber and antioxidant\ncompounds. It appears that these results do not simply\narise because high consumers of nuts, fruit, or salad are\nmore likely to be vegetarian, as the inclusion of con?\nsumption of meat, fish, and poultry as covariates in the\nmodels for both sexes combined resulted in relative risks\nlevels of consumption. Thus, the effects of these foods\nare essentially unchanged after controlling for vegetar?\nian status.\nThe black subjects in the Adventist Health Study\ncohort were more highly educated, to a modest extent,\nthan several other black American study popula?\ntions.27,28 In the Adventist data, educational attainment\nwas associated with greatly reduced mortality (Table 3).\nSimilar results were seen in the NHANES,15 but not the\nCharleston Study,18 although the mean years of educa?\ntion in the latter were only 4.9 for men and 5.6 for\nwomen. Others have also shown that, in black subjects,\nthe risks of dying from any cause,12,29 cancer, heart\ncioeconomic status.\nSocioeconomic status is undoubtedly a surrogate for\nother variables of more direct biological importance,\nsuch as residence in a less violent neighborhood, educa?\ntion, and motivation to consume more healthful foods,\nas well as the availability of better, more consistent\nhealth care. It is unclear, however, whether formal ed?\nucation imparts the same values and beliefs about a\nhealthful life-style, or the same economic opportunities,\nacross racial subcultures.\nDiabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for mor?\ntality in black subjects. The evidence was clearer for\nmen in our dataset, despite the greater number of women\nin the life-style questionnaire population. The only\nother large database that reports the effect of diabetes\nmellitus in black subjects is the Charleston Heart\nStudy,18 where there was also a particularly impressive\nrelative risk in black men and a much smaller risk in\nblack women.\nHypertension is a well known problem in black pop?\nulations. In our study, the effect of self-reported hyper?\ntension on total mortality was substantial in both sexes.\nSimilar results for men11,13 and for both sexes individu-\nally15,18were found in other major studies. As far as we\nknow, there has been only one published report of blood\npressure in a black population of vegetarians, which\nindicated that vegetarians had lower blood pressure lev?\nThe effect of cigarette smoking could not be studied\nadequately in our data with so few current smokers.\nThere is also the possibility that smoking habits had\nchanged during follow-up, especially in the non-Ad-\nventists. In women, however, the point estimate of the\nTABLE 7.
