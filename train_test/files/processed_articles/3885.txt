In this response, we make our case for reporting both direct and\nindirect excess war-related deaths (while distinguishing the difference), defend our efforts to account for survival bias,\nand provide evidence for including all household-reported deaths, not just those cases where a death certificate can be\ndemonstrated.

Conflating violent deaths with non-violent deaths in\nmaking excess-death calculations. The concern is\nthat such estimates \"can create an illusion that a war\nis indirectly causing nonviolent deaths even for a\nwar that causes exclusively violent deaths.\"\n2. Incorrectly ignoring the impact of stratification on\nboth their central estimates and uncertainty\nintervals.\n3. Failing to use correct statistical technique: \"All of\nthe uncertainly intervals are obtained through boot-\nstrapping although the dataset has only 100 clusters\nwhich is not enough to be sanguine about using\nasymptotic theory; thus, the reader should regard all\nUI's in the paper as too narrow, a point which makes\ndeath claims even less credible.\"\n4. Not discounting deaths when a certificate was not\navailable: \"Interviewers recorded seeing only 284\nof 385 reported deaths in the dataset; 32 said they\ndo not possess a death certificate and 66 claim to\nhave a death certificate but failed to produce the\nsupposed death certificate when prompted.\"\n5.

For this project, our University of\nWashington IRB review was extremely time consuming\nand unusually thorough. Therefore, we do not respond to\nSpagat's data processing appendix where he guesses gover-\nnorate identity.\nConflating violent deaths with non-\nviolent deaths in making excess-death\ncalculations\nOur primary interest is in excess mortality because\nour question is about the elusive scientific unicorn: cau-\nsality of death. Excess mortality is only the crudest\napproximation of the human cost of war. There are many\neffects of war: funds diverted from health, war-related\ninjuries, psychological distress, and damage done to\nindividuals and society. Our measurement of indirect\ndeaths is therefore a highly conservative estimate of true\nthe cost of war.\nWe are confused about the Van Weezel and Spagat cri-\ntique on this question, however. While we believe indirect\ndeaths should be included in the total mortality estimates,\nour paper does account for violent and nonviolent deaths\nseparately. Our paper states specifically and explicitly, \"We\nestimate that more than 60% of excess deaths were directly\nattributable to violence, with the rest associated with the\ncollapse of infrastructure and other indirect, but war-\nrelated, causes.\"\nFurther, Figure 5 clearly distinguishes between violent\nand non-violent war-related deaths. The caption reads,\n\"The counterfactual (had there been no war) estimate shows\nthe predicted death counts if crude death rates had remained\noccupation (in gray). War-related, but not violent, deaths\nabove the normal baseline are in the salmon-colored area.\nWar-related violent deaths are portrayed in red.\"\nIn addition, our text reports, Cardiovascular condi-\ntions were the main cause of nonviolent death, accounting\nfor 47% of nonviolent deaths over the entire study period\n(n = 146). Other common sources of nonviolent deaths\nincluded chronic illnesses (11%, n = 35), infant or child-\nhood deaths other than injuries (12.4%, n = 38), non-war\nFigure 1 for the number of household deaths by year and\nIncorrectly ignoring the impact of\nstratification\nWhile Van Weezel and Spagat claim we incorrectly managed\nstratification methodology, their concern is ill founded: our\nmethod did not involve stratification at all. Instead, we used\ngridded population data, a geographic information system,\nand satellite imagery to select 100 \"clusters\" across Iraq. To\nselect the \"starting households\" in each cluster, we dropped a\nsmall grid cell over the cluster's Google Earth image and\nselected one cell (using random numbers); we then chose the\nresidential rooftop that most fully fit in that square to serve as\nthe start household. The sampling methods used in our work\nwere described in full in in The International Journal of\neliminates the need for stratification during sample selection,\nor sample weighting during the analysis stage.\nWe were early adopters of emerging data sources and\nimagery in our sampling approaches. One of the main rea-\nsons we used this approach was that the war had interrupted\nthe ability of the Iraqi Central Organization for Statistics and\nInformation Technology to compile accurate population data\n(United Nations Department of Economic and SocialAffairs,\nnd). Since 2011, other authors have developed and employed\nsimilar approaches, also employing gridded population data\nand satellite imagery (particularly in regions with poor cen-\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS) has recommended\ngridded population data as alternative sample frames in set-\ntings where census data are not available, outdated and/or\nknown to be unreliable (ICF International, 2012; UNICEF,\n2014). This is a growing area of research--one that will con-\ntinue to be important for research in war torn and other low-\nresource regions of the world.\nSpagat has previously questioned the sampling methodol-\nogies of mortality reports, including casting doubt on sam-\nincluded some of the same authors as the University\nCollaborative Iraq Mortality Study (Burnham et al., 2006;\nSpagat et al. asserted a \"Main Street Bias\" in Iraq cluster sam-\npling that could have overestimated mortality. Despite their\nmisinterpretation of the sampling method in the 2006 Lancet\npaper (as all samples were from residential streets), we devel-\noped an alternative sampling method for our 2011 study in\nwhich primary sampling units were chosen with a probability\nproportionate-to-estimated size method and starting house-\nholds were selected randomly.\nConfidence intervals are too narrow\ngiven the bootstrapping method\nemployed\nVan Weezel and Spagat asked that we incorporate the\neffects of governorate stratification in our bootstrapping.\nHagopian et al. 3\nSince we did not stratify by governorate (see above),\ndoing this will lead to incorrect results. Nonetheless, this\nis an opportunity to further elaborate on our bootstrap\nmethod choices.\nAs a sensitivity analysis that we did not include in the\npublication, we considered a bootstrap that resampled both\nclusters and households within clusters. Although resam-\npling by clusters is justified by basic nonparametric boot-\nstrap theory (Bradley Efron, personal communication), we\ncompared it with the more complicated nested bootstrap\nadvocated by Van Weezel and Spagat. This sensitivity\nanalysis found that the uncertainty interval was actually\nsmaller when using the more complex resampling proce-\ndure, exactly the opposite of what Van Weezel and Spagat\npredict. On the basis of this sensitivity analysis, we\nincluded only the simpler approach in our paper, as this\napproach is preferred by the theory and also produces more\nconservative estimates, in the sense that the uncertainty\nintervals are wider.\nWe are confident in our bootstrapping methods to calcu-\nlate confidence intervals, as they follow the suggested\napproach recommended by the world expert of the method,\nand produced wider intervals than the alternative approach.\nDeath certificates were not seen in\nVan Weezel and Spagat claim death reports should be dis-\ncounted for households that could not produce a death cer-\ntificate. The percentage of violent deaths reported by\nhouseholds with death certificates available, however, did\nnot differ substantially from those without, which we\nreported in our paper. Further, even if we include all cases\nregardless of requiring certificates, we are likely to be\nunder-stating deaths. Siegler et al. found that households\nunder-reported, not over-reported, deaths due to intentional\nThe insistence on death certificates is not supported\nby standard demographic methods. Epidemiological\nmethods to estimate a variety of health problem through\nhousehold surveys have been developed over several\nTypically, household surveyors record deaths based on\nhousehold respondent answers to standardized questions\n(Corsi et al., 2012). This method is well established by\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS). DHS have\nbeen using household listing methods to record deaths\n(as we did), since 1984; these have been found consist-\nently reliable. UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster\nnational surveys use similar approaches. This method\nwas also used for the household survey portion of the\nIraq Family Health Survey (Iraq Family Health Survey\nStudy et al., 2008), which Spagat has not critiqued.\nFurther, national census data systems worldwide, which\ngather birth and death information and estimate mortal-\nity rates, use household interview protocols that do not\ninclude visible evidence of death certificates (United\nDeaths reported by households are accepted at face\nvalue the world over for national census surveys. Health\nstudies tend to trust family members to report accurately.\nWhy would they not be? In calculating national immuni-\nzation coverages, for example, UNICEF and ministry of\nhealth surveyors routinely record both evidence from a\nchild's immunization card, and in the absence of a card,\naccept the mother's history of the child receiving immuni-\nzations. These results are used to estimate national immu-\nnization coverage, and deemed to be nationally accurate\nThe situation with death certificates is analogous, and\nserves to only reinforce the accuracy of household death\nreporting. Because most households in Iraq secure a cer-\ntificate at the time of death, we added this additional con-\nfirmatory step. When a certificate was reported to be\npresent in the household but was not accessible on short\nnotice, it was usually because the head of household or the\nperson who knew its location was absent. As we stated in\nour paper, the percentage of households reporting deaths\nthat had death certificates, either shown or claimed (91%),\nthe availability of death certificates remained high\nthroughout the war.\nSpagat has published extensively using the data of\nIraq Body Count, a passive media-based measure of\n2003 Iraq war mortality (Hicks, Dardagan, Bagnall et\nHicks & Spagat, 2008). This method has been discred-\nited, however, as it understates mortality (Ahmed, 2015;\net al., 2008). As evidence, an important finding in our\nwork is that small arms fire contributed substantially to\nmortality (63%); these events rarely make the sort of\nheadlines tracked by the Iraq Body Count.\nA 2008 study by Siegler et al., for example, attempted to\nmatch deaths to the Body Count's media-based tally\n(Siegler et al., 2008). Authors interviewed Baghdad resi-\ndents (via telephone) to ask about the 10 violent deaths\nclosest to their homes since the war began. Interviewees\nsecured place, date, and mechanism for each death. Of\nthose who did not match, authors re-interviewed the origi-\nnal respondents. Baghdad residents reported 161 deaths in\ntotal, 39 of which (24%) were believed to be reflected in\npress reports as summarized by the Body Count. An addi-\ntional 13 deaths (8%) may have been in the database (dif-\nficult to tell from the details), but 61 (38%) were certainly\nnot in the database. More than a third (38%, N=61) of vio-\nlent deaths had not gone to the morgue as required by law\nfor violent deaths, but were instead buried directly by the\nfamily. This strongly suggests there could not be a death\n4 Research and Politics \ncertificate. Therefore, the study suggests a meaningful por-\ndeath certificates. Spagat's insistence on a death certificate\ndeaths by his estimates.\nMigration adjustment overstates\nmortality\nVan Weezel and Spagat assert, \"The authors reach beyond\ntheir data to bridge the gap of nearly 100\nSpecifically, they argue that there is a war refugee popula-\ntion of approximately two million people not covered by\ntheir survey from which there were, they say, approxi-\ntion of 2 million is well below the baseline rate of 2.89 per\ndeath estimates.\"\nAs we stated in our paper:\nThere is evidence that the killings in Iraq were dispro-\nportionately targeted towards the higher-income intelli-\ngentsia, a group typically in a better position to migrate to\na safer setting if under attack [45]. We therefore reviewed\na number of secondary data sources to estimate the num-\nber of Iraqis who migrated out of the country over the\ncourse of the war, to arrive at a total estimate of the miss-\ning households that left the country (and were therefore no\nlonger available in our sampling frame). We then divided\nthis total by an estimated household size, and multiplied\ntotal households by the average fraction of deaths per\nhousehold [46] to estimate the total deaths our household\nsurvey would have missed, and added this number to our\ntotal death count.\nWe acknowledge two problems with our migration\nadjustment, both likely to understate the real number of\ndeaths among migrants. First, refugee and IDP estimates are\nprobably artificially low, as a significant portion of refugees\ndo not register with the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees or the International Organization for Migration\n(Burnham et al., nd). Second, we had available only one\nestimate of the proportion of deaths among households who\nmigrated away, and that estimate reported only the number\nof households with \"one or more\" deaths, not the total num-\nber or proportion of deaths.\nAs stated in our manuscript, our estimate is based on the\nrefugee household pre-migration death fraction from pre-\nviously published literature (Doocy & Burnham, 2009). In\na 2009 report for the International Catholic Migration\nCommission (ICMC), the Johns Hopkins Center for\nRefugee and Disaster Response reported, [o]f households\nhold experienced one or more violent events prior to\ndeparture from Iraq. Households from Baghdad were 2.1\n(CI: 1.3- 3.4) times more likely to have experienced a vio-\nlent event than those from other provinces. Frequencies of\nreported violent events were as follows: threats (81.1%),\nkidnapping of a household member (33.4%), destruction of\nlent death of a household member (14.9%), imprisonment\n(8.8%), and other violent events such as burglary or rob-\nbery, assault, attempted kidnapping or murder, and torture\nWe used the Doocy estimate of Iraqi refugee households\nexperiencing at least one violent death, 14.9% (Doocy &\nin our study, we calculated total migrants would comprise\none death in each of the emigrant households, accounting\nfor those deaths among emigrant households added 55804\nso as to avoid a false sense of precision.\nWe did not use the death rate in our own data set (as a\nsubstitute for the .149 per household figure) because it\nwas subject to survivor bias. Survivor bias is often thought\nof as an epidemiological concept, but its relevance to\nsocial research is wide. For example, in finance, survivor-\nship bias would arise when excluding failed companies\nfrom performance studies because they no longer exist. It\noften causes the results of studies to skew towards more\nfavorable results (fewer deaths, of companies or people)\nbecause only those successful enough to survive until the\npoint of observation are included. For example, a mutual\nfund analysis of holdings today will include only those\ncompanies surviving until now. Losing funds that have\nclosed and merged into other funds can hide poor perfor-\nmance. Since we hypothesized the migrating families\nwould have a higher death rate than those left behind, we\nused an estimate that had been specifically calculated for\nthose who had migrated.\nAs for \"rounding up\" our death count, we again point to\nthe problem of false precision in stating an exact estimate.\nWe had many reasons to believe our estimates were too\nlow. For example, as Van Weezel and Spagat note, our\ncounter-factual (non-war) death rate was undoubtedly too\nhigh (resulting in too-low war-related death estimates).\nThey wrote, \"death rates tend to decrease over time so it\nrecommended projecting forward a decreasing death-rate\ntrend rather than a flat line frozen at a pre-war rate.\" We had\nno data to support anything other than a flat line, however,\nso we did not. This suppressed the mortality estimate.\nConclusion\nVan Weezel and Spagat's points 1 (direct and indirect mor-\ntality) and 5 (migration adjustment) represent opportunities\nfor science to improve. However, we conclude that the\nthree other arguments (stratification, confidence intervals,\nand death certificates) are without merit.\nGiven the widespread and growing level of armed\nconflict worldwide and the enormous amount of damage\nHagopian et al. 5\nto health it produces, it should be a priority for public\nhealth scientists to develop and refine methods of war\nepidemiology. US science agencies would be well advised\nto invest in this area (Hagopian, 2017).\nWere such funding available for war epidemiology, the\ntop priorities for research would include improvements in\nthe following.\n1. Methods for protecting field research teams, who\nface significant threats.\n2. Measures of survival bias in household survey sam-\npling, to account for migration and other factors.\n3. Methods for sample selection.\n4. Estimates of total population counts in both pre-war\nand during or post-war populations.\n5. Estimating the counter-factual non-war death rate,\ngiven falling rates of death worldwide.\n6. Assessing which non-violent deaths are most likely\nto be war-related.\n7.
