Exclusion criteria were: active\nsubstance abuse; dementia; severe, active\nmedical disorder. Patients completed a\nsociodemographic questionnaire and the\nHamilton scales for depression (HAM-D)18\nand anxiety (HAM-A).19\nAll patients provided written informed\nconsent prior to enrolment, and the ethics\ncommittee of S.

However, in contrast to\nothers,14 we did not find a significant increase\nin current suicidal ideation among patients\nwith psoriasis.\nPatients with psoriasis in the present study\nreported more severe depression than those\nwith other conditions. In contrast to others,15\nhowever, we found no between-group differ-\nence in severity of anxiety. Depression is\nconsidered a common co-occurring condition\nTable 1.

Our findings confirmed this\nincreased number of psychiatric diagnoses in\npatients with psoriasis, with 38.5% having\nhad a lifetime psychiatric disorder diagnosis\ncompared with 16.7% of patients with other\nized by the occurrence of a major life event\nbefore onset. Our study found that 73.6% of\npatients with psoriasis reported a negative life\nevent 12 months before the onset of symp-\ntoms, which is significantly more than those\nwith other conditions. This result confirmed\nthe previously reported relationship between\nstressful life events and disease onset, which is\nmore common in psoriasis than in other\ndermatological conditions.7 Our findings\nprovide further evidence for the connection\nbetween stress and psoriasis, which has been\nterm course of illness in patients with psoriasis\nreinforces the effect of this condition on\nhealth-related quality-of-life and the risk of\npsychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation.\nOur study has several limitations, includ-\ning the small sample size and cross-sectional\nstudy design. In addition, psoriasis naturally\nhas a longer disease course and affects a\nlarger area of the body than other dermato-\nlogical diseases such as melanoma, which\ncharacteristically affects a small area and has\na poor 5-year survival rate.24\nIn conclusion, the present study confirms\nthat patients with psoriasis have an\nincreased risk of psychiatric comorbidities,\nTable 2.
