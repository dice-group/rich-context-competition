    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article attends to recent discussions of validity in psychometric research on human life history strategy (LHS), provides a\nconstructive critique of the extant literature, and describes strategies for improving construct validity. To place the psychometric\nstudy of human LHS on more solid ground, our review indicates that researchers should (a) use approaches to psychometric\nmodeling that are consistent with their philosophies of measurement, (b) confirm the dimensionality of life history indicators, and\n(c) establish measurement invariance for at least a subset of indicators. Because we see confirming the dimensionality of life\nhistory indicators as the next step toward placing the psychometrics of human LHS on more solid ground, we use nationally\nrepresentative data and structural equation modeling to test the structure of middle adult life history indicators. We found\nstatistically independent mating competition and Super-K dimensions and the effects of parental harshness and childhood\nunpredictability on Super-K were consistent with past research. However, childhood socioeconomic status had a moderate\npositive effect on mating competition and no effect on Super-K, while unpredictability did not predict mating competition. We\nconclude that human LHS is more complex than previously suggested--there does not seem to be a single dimension of human\nLHS among Western adults and the effects of environmental components seem to vary between mating competition and Super-K.\n",

According to these models, early\nenvironmental cues during the first 5\u00ad7 years of life trigger a\ndevelopmental shift toward allocation of resources to early\nreproduction and mating effort at the expense of somatic and\nparental effort.\nRecent psychometric research has extended LHT to a broad\nsuite of psychosocial traits (Figueredo et al., 2006). The under-\nlying rationale is that natural and sexual selection produced\nclusters of coadapted traits that function as coherent reproduc-\ntive strategies or life history strategies (Figueredo et al., 2006,\n2015). In this view, adaptations that allocate resources between\nsomatic and reproductive effort and also between mating effort\nand parental/nepotistic effort are executed in a coordinated\nfashion, producing reproductively coherent phenotypes in\nterms of personality, psychosocial characteristics, and outward\nbehaviors. Consistent with this, a second-order K-factor has\nsubsumed constructs such as planning and control, social con-\ntact and support, attachment, religiosity, and altruism (for a\nreview, see Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014).\nLower scores on this factor are thought to correspond to faster\nlife history strategy (LHS) while higher scores are thought to\nimply slower LHS.\nCopping, Campbell, and Muncer (2014) recently identified\nseveral important areas for improving validity in psychometric\nresearch on human LHS, many of which are issues of construct\nvalidity (e.g., internal structure of questionnaires designed to\nmeasure LHS, including the Mini-K [Figueredo et al., 2006]\nand High-K Strategy Scale [HKSS; Giosan, 2006]). In response\nto this critique, Figueredo and colleagues (2015) argued that\nthe psychometric study of human LHS is on solid footing. Here\nwe elaborate on some of the issues identified by Copping et al.\nresponse, by discussing approaches to psychometric modeling\nand also by reviewing steps that can be taken to improve con-\nstruct validity when factor modeling is employed. We then take\nstock of the extant psychometric literature and find that the\ndimensionality of life history indicators has not been ade-\nquately confirmed. Given that this is crucial for establishing\nconstruct validity, we use nationally representative data and\nstructural equation modeling (SEM) with bifactor models to\ntest the structure of middle adult life history indicators. We\nconclude by summarizing findings and providing implications\nand next steps for studies of human LHS.\nPhilosophical Considerations\nPsychometric modeling is partly guided by philosophical con-\nsiderations. The very first step in any effort to establish con-\nstruct validity is selection of a modeling approach that makes\nsense, given a researcher's philosophy of measurement. Mod-\nern psychometrics is typically driven by realism or the notion\nthat latent variables are proxies for real variables with expla-\nnatory content. As described by Borsboom (2006):\nOne of the main breakthroughs of the past century in psycho-\nmetric thinking about measurement consists in the realization\nthat measurement does not consist of finding the right observed\nscore to substitute for a theoretical attribute, but of devising a\nmodel structure to relate an observable to a theoretical attribute.\nAn essential precondition for this realization to occur is that,\neither intuitively or explicitly, one already holds the philoso-\nphical idea that theoretical attributes are, in fact, distinct from a\nset of observations, i.e. that one rejects the operationalist thesis\nthat theoretical attributes are synonymous with the way they are\nIn psychometric research, factor models are commonly used to\nmeasure psychological attributes. As Borsboom (2006)\nexplained, these are models of the relationships between\nobserved scores and latent attributes and are used to estimate\nthe properties of the latter. Factor models can be used in a\npurely descriptive manner that does not invoke realism at least\nwith respect to latent variables (Jonas & Markon, 2016). The\ndescriptivist approach can be seen as more concerned with sta-\ntistical parsimony than elucidating the nature of causal forces\nresponsible for patterns of covariation--it attends to what more\nso than why (Harms, Wood, & Spain, 2016). The descriptivist\napproach advances by discovering the shortest possible repre-\nsentation of the data in an information theoretic sense, while the\nrealist approach attends to statistical parsimony but also places a\npremium on explicating the functional or causal relationships\namong variables (Borsboom, Mellenbergh, & van Heerdeen,\nLHS is often invoked as an organizing source or cause of\ncovariation among life history indicators. This conception of\nLHS is not obligatory--a descriptivist approach could also be\nemployed. However, if higher order latent LHS variables can-\nnot be understood as causing multiple life history traits,\nresearch interest would likely shift toward the individual traits.\nThis is because evolutionary psychological researchers typi-\ncally want to characterize evolved mechanisms, not just find\nthe simplest way to summarize covariance among traits. Impor-\ntantly, LHT attends to adaptations that evolved to successfully\ncause genetic propagation, given the finite nature of resources\nand variation in environmental conditions (Stearns, 1976).\nThus, in addition to determining the dimensionality of life\nhistory indicators (i.e., the most statistically parsimonious way\nto represent them), we see the psychometrics of human LHS as\nconcerned with realist questions about latent LHS variables:\nAre the effects of latent LHS variables on their indicators\ninvariant across populations, settings, and time? Do latent LHS\nvariables fully explain the associations between their indicators\nand other theoretically relevant variables (e.g., environmental\nconditions)? These questions assume that it is theoretically\nplausible that latent LHS variables correspond to evolved\nmechanisms or unitary variables formed by evolved mechan-\nisms. Of course, this is an important question in itself.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nFrom the perspective developed above, several recent dis-\ncussions about latent LHS variables can be seen as containing\nproblematic claims. According to Figueredo et al. (2015),\nAlthough the psychometric approach composites multiple indi-\ncators present in the developmental pathway of the psychoso-\ncial acceleration model for the purpose of constructing latent\nvariables, it can also be used to test components of the psycho-\nsocial acceleration model. (p. 313)\nAlthough compositing indicators may serve descriptive pur-\nposes well, it seems somewhat antithetical to modeling a\nmechanistic process such as psychosocial acceleration (see\nHarms et al., 2016). Moreover, this passage is consistent with\nothers in psychometric studies of LHS in that it seems to con-\nflate latent variables (i.e., factors) that subsume their indicators\nwith composites formed by researchers. In a factor model,\nmultiple indicators are not composited to form latent variables.\nInstead, the relations among the indicators allow researchers to\ndetermine the properties of the latent variable (Bollen, 1989;\nCohen, Cohen, Teresi, Marchi, & Velez, 1990). From a realist\nperspective, this variable should be understood as causing and\ntherefore distinct from and temporally precedent to its indica-\nview excludes the use of early childhood events or traits as\nreflective indicators of adolescent or young adult LHS, unless\nthe latent variable can be understood as time invariant and\ntherefore able to cause a reflective indicators operating early\nand also later in development.\nIn another illustrative example, Figueredo et al. (2015)\nsimultaneously describe common factors as relatively agnostic\nto the causal effects that link their indicators and also as the\nunderlying causes to which these effects are attributable:\nNevertheless, the critique makes a valid point in stating that\ncommon factor models using global inventories such as the\nALHB are relatively agnostic with respect to possible causal\nrelations among its various components. Any common factor\nmodel, and not just ours, represents the multiple convergent\nindicators as effects of a common unobserved influence, which\nis the latent variable hypothesized. The purpose of such ``mea-\nsurement models'' is to measure the phenomenon in question by\nmeans of whatever manifest indicators can be systematically\nAgnosticism to the causal relations among indicators is coher-\nent with a descriptivist approach. However, if LHS factors are\nassumed to represent common unobserved influences on indi-\ncators, they are not relatively agnostic to the causal nature of\nlatent variable\u00adindicator relationships. In turn, many variables\nwill not function as valid indicators of these LHS factors. For\ninstance, models that specify causes of LHS as its reflective\nindicators would be seen as misspecified. Unfortunately, spe-\ncifying such causes in formative measurement models may also\nFinally, we consider an additional example to further illus-\ntrate the importance of clarifying the causal status of LHS with\nrespect to its indicators. In their hybrid model, Figueredo et al.\nscores. Importantly, the Mini-K scores were produced through\nan aggregation of items that overlap the content of the endo-\ngenous variables they impacted. For example, some Mini-K\nitems assess the warmth of the relationships participants have\nwith their parents and romantic partners. In the model, these\nitem contents overlapped domains endogenous to the Mini-K\n(e.g., romantic partner attachment and biological mother and\nfather). Thus, the Mini-K was not distinct from the outcomes it\ninfluenced, a problem that likely biased estimates of its effects\n(i.e., a discriminant validity problem; McGrath, 2005). Given\nthe validity problems plaguing this model, we contend that it\nshould not be seen as strong evidence that the Mini-K provides\nvalid measurement of its intended construct.\nResearchers can avoid conceptual confusion and produce\nmore unbiased estimates through careful consideration and\nclarification of their assumptions about latent variables. As\nwe noted, a descriptivist approach can be employed and does\nnot require the assumption that factors are exogenous to their\nindicators. But if researchers are employing this approach,\nwhat rationale is there for using directed graphs to represent\ntheir effects? And, what rationale is there for imposing statis-\ntical independence between endogenous variables such as\nfactor indicators? It is important to recognize that in structural\nmodels, independencies imply strong causal assumptions\n(e.g., two variables do not cause one another directly). To\ndate, we have not seen any explicit application of descripti-\nvism in human life history research. Perhaps descriptivism\nhas been implicit in some studies. In the future, we recom-\nmend that researchers alert readers if they are deviating from\nthe usual approach to factor modeling by employing descrip-\ntivist principles. In the following section, we assume a realist\napproach to factor modeling and describe steps for establish-\ning construct validity.\nEstablishing Construct Validity With Factor Models\nIndicator selection. Once researchers have clarified their mea-\nsurement approach, indicator selection is the next step in estab-\nlishing construct validity via factor modeling. Importantly,\nmodeling assumptions carry with them implications for how\nindicators may be selected. Most researchers employing factor\nmodels probably recognize the assumption that factors cause\nindicators allows us to estimate properties of latent variables\nand attenuate them for measurement error, revealing ``true''\nscore variance (Cohen et al., 1990). In contrast, composites and\nindices are not attenuated for measurement error. Fewer may be\naware that this causal assumption also implies that the indica-\ntors in the reflective factor model are interchangeable. That is,\nthe parameters of latent variables with reflective indicators can\nbe invariant to which specific indicators are included in the\nmodel (Bollen & Lennox, 1991; Hayduk, Cummings, Boadu,\nPazderka-Robinson, & Boulianne, 2007). In contrast, composites\nRichardson et al. 3\nand indices are determined by their indicators and so their\nparameters are dependent on which variables are used to form\nthem. This distinction extends to estimates of the effects\nbetween constructs. For composites, consistency in such\neffects across studies depends on the operationalization of\nthe construct, or which variables are used in the forming pro-\ncess, while a variety of reflective indicators can be used to\nmeasure latent constructs and achieve such consistency.\nSimulation research indicates that when confirmatory factor\nanalysis (CFA) is used, researchers can locate the correct latent\nvariable with as few as three indicators or two indicators, when\nthey provide broad coverage of the construct space and reflect\nthe construct to the same extent (Little, Lindenberger, & Nes-\nselroade, 1999). Indeed, with some information from prior\nresearch and/or a very strong theory, a single indicator may\nbe used (Hayduk & Littvay, 2012). This implies that the task\nof selecting invariant indicators of LHS should not be too oner-\nous. If a variety of such indicators is identified, life history\nresearchers can avoid a troublesome outcome of operational-\nism--variance in findings across labs that is due to differences\nin the way constructs are operationalized. Instead, researchers\nin different labs may employ varying selections of indicators\nand as consistent relationships between construct estimates\nemerge, become increasingly confident in the nature of LHS.\nThus, we see no reason why researchers should all opt to use\nthe Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB) or the Mini-K.\nIndeed, variations in the instrumentation and vantages used\nby multiple independent labs are important for protecting\nagainst researcher bias that may occur in the context of study\ndesign (e.g., method or measurement bias; Spector, 2006), pop-\nulation identification and sampling, interviewing and docu-\nmentation, and citation of previous studies (Pannucci &\nExploratory versus confirmatory models. It may seem as though\npsychometric research on human LHS has already established\nindicators that provide valid measurement as well as estab-\nlished that LHS is unidimensional. However, most extant\nstudies (e.g., Dunkel & Decker, 2010; Figueredo, Vasquez,\nBrumbach, & Schneider, 2007; Gladden, Figueredo, &\nSefcek & Figueredo, 2010) have been exploratory in that they\nused exploratory factor analysis (EFA), an approach that\nassumes indicators reflect common factors but specifies no\nstructure in advance. Although it is possible to obtain a w2\ntest in the context of EFA (e.g., in MPlus), researchers have\ngenerally not used tests or indices of model fit to the data\nwhen conducting these analyses. Thus, EFA studies have been\nuseful for data reduction (i.e., simplifying the world) and\nexploring structure but less so for theory testing. One impor-\ntant implication of this reliance on EFA is that by and large,\nwe do not yet know whether higher order slow LHS or\nK-factors, or Super-K factors for that matter, are consistent\nwith the data. That is, we do not know whether such higher\norder factors provide greater parsimony without compromis-\ning model correspondence to observations. Indeed, Copping\nHKSS, a second-order factor model actually fit the data sig-\nnificantly worse than a first-order model with intercorrelated\nfactors. It is not yet clear whether models that include higher\norder factors fit Mini-K or ALHB data as well as those with-\nout. This is an important area for future research because this\nsort of confirmatory testing could lead researchers to deter-\nmine that there is no K-factor after all.\nMeasurement invariance. Once researchers have selected indica-\ntors on the basis of theory and shown that their factor model is\nconsistent with the data, they can proceed to establish that their\nmeasure is widely useful or measures its construct with invar-\niance to setting and population. In addition to addressing the\nuse of psychometric versus biometric indicators, Figueredo\net al. (2015) made an extensive case (providing illustrative\nexamples along the way) that life history measurement is com-\nplicated by myriad variables that moderate the effects between\nindividuals' strategies and the indicators used to measure them.\nImportantly, this is a problem that has received extensive atten-\ntion in the methodological literature, where it is known as\ndifferential item functioning (DIF) or metric variance (Bollen,\n2007). DIF occurs when a construct's effects on its indicators\ndepend on or vary across levels of other variables (e.g., sex,\nethnicity, age, socioeconomic status [SES], etc.). This metric\nvariance implies that the construct may not have the same iden-\ntity across such variables. At least partial measurement invar-\niance is required to establish the equivalence of the construct\n(Brown, 2006). Importantly, measurement invariance testing is\nnoticeably absent from research on human LHS, leaving the\npossibility that no single life history construct exists across\nsubgroups of people within populations. This is striking, given\nFigueredo et al. (2015) themselves pointed out the importance of\nusing the same metric for comparing the sexes (p. 309).\nStemming from the above, one serious concern we have\nregarding the psychometric study of human LHS is that an\never-increasing list of moderators of the effects of LHS on its\nindicators and other constructs will cause people to lose inter-\nest. This may be a very real possibility--it has occurred in other\nareas of science. In research testing the contact hypothesis\n(Allport, 1954), so many facilitators (i.e., moderators) of con-\ntact effects were being identified that the field became con-\ncerned the theory had become unfalsifiable (Pettigrew, 1998).\nResearchers began to think that contact effects might not gen-\neralize past the immediate situation. To avoid this outcome,\nresearchers need to establish the essential manifestations of\nLHS or the indicators that are invariant to the broader models\nin which they are embedded. Without establishing this, no\nunique identity can be ascribed to LHS (Edwards & Bagozzi,\n2000). In addition, researchers need to establish which indica-\ntors reflect construct(s) with invariance across contexts and\ngroups of people. Without establishing this, we cannot be sure\nthat LHS is broadly useful (Brown, 2006).\nDirectly relevant to the above, life history research has very\nrecently applied something similar to nonlinear factor analysis\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\n(see McDonald, 1967) to LHS measurement (e.g., Woodley\net al., 2015). In these models, which have been termed contin-\nuous parameter estimation models following a theoretical\nexposition by Gorsuch (2005), the LHS construct's effects on\nits indicators decrease as factor scores increase. The theory\ndriving these studies is that life history traits covary to a lesser\nextent among higher K strategists because they are character-\nized by greater phenotypic plasticity (Woodley et al., 2015). No\ndoubt this theory is intriguing, but because the newly devel-\noped approach employed by Woodley et al. (2015) provides no\ntest or index of model fit to the data, it is not yet clear that\nnonlinear models explain the relationships among life history\ntraits better than linear ones.\nThe theoretical development described above is also a bit of\na departure from prior research on human LHS. If correct,\nWoodley et al.'s (2015) model presumably implies that\nbetween construct estimates based on previous linear models\nwere biased. And, the new model seems to run the risk of\nmaking the application of LHT to humans even more unwieldy\nin that not only is there a laundry list of factors that might\nmoderate LHS factor loadings, but these loadings are also not\ninvariant across its distribution. However, if methodological\nresearch bears out the utility of the continuous parameter esti-\nmation model and substantive studies bear out the nonlinear\nrelationships between LHS and its indicators, our prescription\nfor moving forward is the same. It will be critical to establish\nmeasurement invariance for at least a subset of life history\nindicators. We are not aware of any reason why moderated\nnonlinear factor analysis (Curran et al., 2014) could not be used\nto tackle the hypothesis that LHS has nonlinear effects on its\nindicators, as well as test for measurement invariance, given\nthat it provides tests of model fit.\nFinally, we wish to stress that we are not arguing that life\nhistory research must proceed exclusively via factor modeling.\nOther potentially useful approaches are available. For instance,\na network approach could also be applied to understand the\neffects between indicators (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013). We\ndo see many benefits to the use of CFA models (e.g., measure-\nment invariance testing and attenuation of constructs for mea-\nsurement error). If these models are used in a realist sense,\nresearchers need to begin articulating a precise identity for the\nlatent slow LHS or K-factor variables, one that can be reason-\nably thought of as invariant to other variables that are modeled\nand also population sampled. While many variables may mod-\nerate the effects of LHS, it is important that we identify at least\nsome indicators that manifest invariantly to protect ourselves\nfrom circular reasoning or advancing an unfalsifiable theory.\nWhere Are We Now?\nMethodological limitations aside, a promising literature on\nhuman LHS has emerged. Researchers have selected psycho-\nmetric indicators of LHS and, as mentioned above, largely\nattempted to establish construct validity via EFA. When\nfactor models are used, dimensionality typically implies\nthat indicators share common causes on some level. As\nmentioned, past research seems to bear out the existence of\na single fast to slow life history (LH) spectrum between spe-\ncies (Chisholm, 1993); most discussions of individual differ-\nences in human LHS attend to a single dimension of variation\nin life history indicators; and a number of studies have found\nthat a second-order K-factor subsumed indicators such as\nplanning and control, social contact and support, attachment,\nreligiosity, and altruism (for a review, see Olderbak et al.,\n2014). Recently, LHS has been broadened to a third-order\nSuper-K factor that subsumes the second-order K-factor along\nwith covitality (i.e., health and mental health) and the general\nfactor of personality (which encompasses the Big Five\npersonality traits; Olderbak et al., 2014). These findings sug-\ngest that on some level, a single source of variation gives rise\nto the covariation among life history indicators. Consonantly,\nour discussion hitherto has followed prior literature in\nassuming such unidimensionality. As a reminder, however,\nthis assumption has been subjected to few confirmatory tests\nand more detailed statistical analysis is required to validate\nthis assumption.\nIn addition to the lack of confirmatory evidence favoring a\nsingle LHS dimension, there may be empirical and theoretical\ngrounds for questioning the existence of a single fast\u00adslow\ndimension. An assumption accompanying LHS models with a\nsingle higher order dimension is that lower levels on this factor\ncorrespond to greater endorsement of mating competition (e.g.,\nmating effort, dominance-seeking, and risk-taking). This is\nbecause according to LHT, the finite nature of resources\ninduces phenotypic trade-offs (see Mace, 2000; Stearns,\n1989) such that investments in slow LHS (i.e., somatic and\nparental effort) occur at the expense of mating competition\n(Figueredo et al., 2006). Despite some consensus that there is\na life history continuum within humans, particularly relating to\nempirical research has not consistently found a single dimen-\nsion that subsumes the wider documented variation in human\nLH traits, including individual differences in personality and\nbehavior. For example, Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis (2009)\nfound that during adolescence, a single dimension did not sub-\nsume LH traits and only a social deviance dimension emerged\nto explain substantial variance in delinquency and drug use.\nBrumbach et al. (2009) also reported that uncorrelated latent\nvariables representing social deviance and slow LHS subsumed\nLH traits during young adulthood. Young adult LHS mani-\nfested as health, sexual restrictedness, and resource accruing\npotential, while social deviance manifested as delinquency,\nMachiavellianism, alcohol use, and impulsivity. The authors\nsuggested that LHS might canalize into a single dimension later\nin middle adulthood. Consistent with Brumbach et al. (2009),\nRichardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, and Swoboda (2014) found\nthat not all indicators of young adult LHS reflected one life\nhistory dimension. In particular, health and neuroticism did not\nreflect an LHS variable that subsumed mating effort, delin-\nquency, and liability to greater substance use. Very recently,\nRichardson et al. (2016) reproduced these findings in\nadolescence.\nRichardson et al. 5\nIn other studies, low levels on K-factors have corre-\nsponded to higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of\nhealth, altruism, conscientiousness, parental investment, and\nearning potential (Figueredo et al., 2007), but they have not\nnecessarily implied greater mating effort (Gladden, Figuer-\nFigueredo et al., 2005). Recently, Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf,\nand Figueredo (2014) found that mating effort did not reflect\nfour of the five K-factors, which subsumed five different\nmeasures of LHS (i.e., Super-K-1, ALHB, Mini-K, and\nHKSS, but not Super-K-2). Moreover, Figueredo, Gladden,\nand Hohman (2011) reported that instead, mating effort was\nsubsumed by a latent variable named psychopathic and\naggressive attitudes. Consonantly, Jonason, Norman, Li, and\nSchmidtt (2009) linked the dark triad (subsuming psychopa-\nthy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism; Jonason & Webster,\n2010) to mating effort indicators, including number of sexual\npartners. From this body of work alone, the relationship\nbetween mating effort and K-factors remains unclear.\nConsistent with the findings discussed above, Richardson\net al. (2014) suggested that perhaps mating competition varies\nuniquely from the K dimension that subsumes delay of repro-\nduction, somatic effort, and parenting effort. Complementing\nthis conception, cross-cultural research on perceptions of the\nreproductive strategies of literary characters revealed two\ninversely related but unique dimensions representing high-\nparental effort, long-term strategies and high mating-effort, and\nhigh-risk strategies (Kruger et al., 2015). Holtzman and Senne\n(2014) have argued that a two-dimensional model of human\nLHS should be employed on the basis of findings that mating\norientation is not unidimensional but rather reflects two rela-\ntively independent factors--short- and long-term mating orien-\ntations (Holtzman & Strube, 2013; Jackson & Kirkpatrick,\nvided a review of biochemical, genetic, demographic, and indi-\nvidual differences data that converge to indicate that some\nhumans engage in lifelong or serial monogamy in conjunction\nwith clandestine adultery. Following Gangestad and Simpson\nsuggested that like mating strategies (short-term vs. long-term),\nlife strategies (selfish vs. altruistic) might be orthogonal or take\non pluralistic forms. Perhaps high levels on mating competition\nand K-factors can co-occur and LHS is not just multidimen-\nsional at the first-order level (i.e., the level of traits like con-\nscientiousness as discussed in Figueredo et al., 2015), but also\nat higher order levels.\nResearch on pathological and normal personality also sug-\ngests that a two-dimensional structure of life history traits is\nplausible. In this literature, liability to externalization has sub-\nsumed many of the Brumbach et al.'s (2009) social deviance\nvariables and also those listed by Figueredo et al. (2011; e.g.,\nKrueger, Markon, Patrick, Benning, & Kramer, 2007). In addi-\ntion, many externalizing constructs such as psychopathy, delin-\nquency, and antisocial behavior (Figueredo et al., 2011; Glenn\n& Raine, 2009; Harris, Rice, Hilton, Lalumiere, & Quinsey,\nimpulsivity and sensation seeking (Robbins & Bryan, 2004)\nhave been linked to or subsumed sexual behavior and other\nindicators of mating effort and success. These findings suggest\nthat perhaps liability to externalization (including social\ndeviance) and mating competition are interchangeable. Simi-\nlarly, perhaps the Super-K factor represents the inverse of\ninternalization, consistent with findings that higher levels on\nthis construct imply greater mental and physical health (i.e.,\nThere are several reasons why mating competition and K- or\nSuper-K factors might only be loosely related. First, indepen-\ndence between mating competition and the K-factor might be\npossible due to compartmentalization in the expression of mat-\ning competition and the K-factor. These dimensions might not\nbe directly related because the former occurs in out-group con-\ntexts (e.g., exploration and acquisition of resources), while the\nlatter occurs within one's group or family (e.g., pair-bonding\nand parental effort). Second, there is some reason to question\nwhether the finite nature of resources imposes many important\nlife history trade-offs on modern humans. Many human invest-\nments (e.g., automobiles, houses, status-bearing occupations,\nand physical fitness) may simultaneously lend themselves to\nsuccess in mating effort and also success in somatic and par-\nental effort. As Figueredo et al. noted, modern medicine, birth\ncontrol, nutrition, extrasomatic wealth, and other aspects of\nmodern environments may also help decouple mating compe-\ntition from the K-factor (for discussions of how life history\ntrade-offs may be contingent on factors such as access to\nresources and environmental conditions, see Mace, 2000; Sibly\nthat environmental moderation of trade-offs is a distinct issue\nfrom environmental effects on LHS dimensions. That is,\naspects of modern environments might decouple LHS dimen-\nsions (i.e., dampen their intercorrelations) but still impact them\nas predicted by psychosocial acceleration theory.\nWe note that if true, these possibilities would not necessarily\nimply that there is not a within humans fast\u00adslow life history\ncontinuum, as mating competition and K- or Super-K factors\nmight be weakly but negatively correlated directly or through\ntheir dependence on general environmental conditions (e.g.,\nunpredictability). However, this would imply that there is not\na single LHS construct that could be measured and scored to\ncapture where people fall from fast to slow. If this were the\ncase, there would be important implications for life history\nresearch. For instance, the fast\u00adslow theoretical framework\ncould not be applied to a single life history dimension in a very\nstraightforward manner because someone with a high score on\na K- or Super-K factor might also score highly on mating\ncompetition. Importantly, this implication would hold regard-\nless of one's philosophical position regarding the ontology of\nlatent variables.\nFinally, LHT has been extrapolated from between-species\ncomparisons to within-species variation. Although it seems\nplausible that the finite nature of resources imposes trade-offs\nat the within- and between-species levels, it is not clear that this\nimplies the same structure of life history traits between and\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nwithin species. Importantly, this issue has been addressed in\ndiscussions of the assumption of local homogeneity (i.e., mod-\nels have the same form between and within subjects) and there\nis evidence that this assumption may hold infrequently (Bors-\nberg, 1993). Critiques of evolutionary theories conflating\nstructure within and between individuals help illustrate this\npoint (e.g., Kanazawa's Savanah-IQ hypothesis; see Bors-\nis that research on human LHS needs to confirm the structure\nof life history traits and then test whether it is the same\nbetween and within species (e.g., as described by Adolf,\nSchuurman, Borkenau, Borsboom, & Dolan, 2014). Similarly,\nit is important to carry out invariance testing across the sexes,\nethnicities, and cultures.\nThe Current Study\nWe have identified a number of areas for improving validity in\nresearch on human LHS. Confirming the structure of life his-\ntory indicators is the first step in efforts to put the psychometric\nstudy of human LHS on more solid ground. Until we use con-\nfirmatory modeling to determine the underlying dimensions\nthat subsume life history indicators, we cannot be sure which\nindicators are most useful or proceed to invariance testing.\nDespite evidence consistent with a single fast\u00adslow life history\ncontinuum in humans, emerging research suggests that life\nhistory indicators may reflect two dimensions (i.e., Super-K\nand mating competition), though each may coordinate with\nenvironmental conditions as predicted by LHT. Further, Brum-\nbach et al. (2009) suggested that life history traits begin to\nreflect a single dimension in middle adulthood. However, no\nstudy has used middle adult data and a model that allows life\nhistory indicators to reflect Super-K and also mating competi-\ntion. Additional research is needed to confirm the dimension-\nality of life history indicators throughout development,\nespecially in light of recent critiques of the psychological mea-\nsures of LHS that have stemmed from differential K theory\n(e.g., Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014; but also see Fig-\nueredo et al., 2015). Here we use nationally representative,\nlongitudinal data to clarify the structure of middle adult life\nhistory indicators. If underlying life history dimensions fit the\ndata, we test whether they reflect environmental conditions as\npredicted by psychosocial acceleration theory (Belsky et al.,\nMethod\nRichardson et al. (2014) suggested that relatively independent\nmating competition and K dimensions might subsume LH\ntraits in the later portion of young adulthood and persist into\nmiddle adulthood. In this study, we tested for these two\ndimensions in middle adulthood using SEM with bifactor\nmodels (Chen, West, & Sousa, 2006) and nationally represen-\ntative longitudinal data. We also tested whether childhood\nenvironmental conditions including unpredictability, parental\nharshness (both defined below), and SES predicted dimen-\nsions of middle adult LHS. We conducted these tests to deter-\nmine whether the predictions of LHT held for all higher order\nLHS variables. The inclusion of SES also allowed us to\naddress the possibility that trade-offs between LHS dimen-\nsions occur only within the levels of access to resources\nThe Bifactor Model\nPast CFA studies of human LHS relied on the second-order\nfactor model (see Figure 1), which includes overarching or\ngeneral constructs (e.g., K- or Super-K factors) that subsume\nindividual first-order constructs (e.g., warmth of relationships\nwith parents). Importantly, these models specify the residual\nvariances in first-order constructs (i.e., that unexplained by\noverarching factors) as orthogonal to second-order factors and\nusually other first-order factors as well. Moreover, these resi-\nduals are usually ignored (Chen et al., 2006). But researchers\nare sometimes interested in general factors and also the factors\nthat explain unique variance in domains over and above that\nexplained by general factors. For instance, they may want to\npredict outcomes like academic achievement with general fac-\ntors such as intelligence and also unique variances in domains\nlike verbal ability. Researchers may also simply wish to esti-\nmate the effects of general and also domain-specific factors on\nitems, or determine if there are actually domain-specific factors\nat all after accounting for the general factor. Indeed, the\nabsence of domain-specific variance in second-order models\noften goes unnoticed (Chen et al., 2006).\nAs discussed above, it is not clear that Super-K subsumes\nmating effort and other indicators of mating competition (e.g.,\nrisk-taking). One possibility is that mating competition is rel-\nevant to a narrow band of life history traits that generally vary\nwith independence from the Super-K and its domains.\nAnother possibility is that mating competition varies uniquely\nfrom Super-K but also subsumes variance in its domains. For\ninstance, extroversion could reflect effort expended to influ-\nence people for reasons related to Super-K (e.g., maintaining\nsocial relationships and reciprocal transactions) and also mat-\ning effort (as noted by MacDonald, 1995). Moreover, invest-\nment in health and thereby attractiveness (Nedelec & Beaver,\n2014) could produce benefits relevant to Super-K (e.g., long life\nspan conducive to investment in offspring) and also mating\ncompetition (e.g., more sexual partners). In attempts to examine\nsuch possibilities, life history researchers may find the bifactor\nmodel (see Figure 1) useful, given that it allows them to estimate\nthe effects of Super-K on its indicators and also examine how\nvariance in life history indicators that is not explained by Super-\nK may reflect other constructs or dimensions.1\nData\nThis study analyzed publicly available national data from the\nMidlife in the United States (MIDUS; n \u00bc 4,244).2 The\nMIDUS survey investigated the role of behavioral,\nRichardson et al. 7\npsychological, and social factors in accounting for age-related\nvariations in health and well-being. The data are longitudinal\n1, participants in our analytic sample were aged 24\u00ad74 years (m\nposition of the sample was 83% White, 10.6% African Amer-\nican, 1.6% Native American or Aleutian Islander/Eskimo,\nhigh school, 7.4% graduated from a 2-year college or voca-\ntional school with an associate's degree, 17.7% graduated col-\nlege with a bachelor's or master's degree, and 3.9% earned a\ndoctoral degree. Sixty-five percent of the Round 1 sample par-\nticipated during Round 2. For more information about the\nMIDUS samples, please visit http://www.midus.wisc.edu/\nmidus1/index.php. Because attrition was a concern, we con-\nducted a missing data analysis. We observed evidence that the\nmissing completely at random assumption (MCAR) for listwise\ndeletion was inappropriate (e.g., several indicators of child-\nhood environment predicted missingness on the substance use\nitems), found the more relaxed assumption of missing at ran-\ndom plausible (Little & Rubin, 2002), used multiple imputation\nand generated five3 imputed data sets using the NORM Version\nInstruments\nWe used LHT to select 19 Round 2 indicators of middle adult\nLHS and 3 Round 1 retrospective indicators of childhood\nenvironment. We selected life history indicators that have been\nobserved to reflect a broad set of LHS domains in prior research\n(for a review, see Olderbak et al., 2014) and also chose envi-\nronmental indicators that have been previously studied (for a\nreview, see Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009).\nBased on the literature to date, we note the hypothesized\nvalence of each LHS indicator loading in Table 1. We mea-\nsured the 19 selected life history indicators and constructed\nthree environmental components using 73 and 22 items,4\nrespectively. A major strength of the MIDUS survey was the\nlarge selection of measures employed. The survey developers\nused well-validated scales and also carried out extensive pilot\nresearch to develop short-form assessments of many psycho-\nsocial constructs along with condensed assessment inventories.\nWhere possible, we included scale scores computed by the\nsurvey developers as factor indicators. We also attempted to\ninclude any other available items that reflected our constructs\ntheoretically or empirically. A full list of the items and scale\nscores we selected is presented in Table 2, along with their\nMIDUS labels, the constructs they measured, and their con-\ntents. All scale scores computed by the survey developers are\nmarked ``computed by the survey developers.'' For further\ninformation about these scales, including their a coefficients\nfor the MIDUS samples and also references to validation stud-\nies, please access the MIDUS I and II scales information at\nhttp://www.midus.wisc.edu/midus1/index.php and http://\nwww.midus.wisc.edu/midus2/project1/.\nBelow we describe all indicators used to measure middle\nadult LHS as well as index childhood environment. Because\nthis study used a very large number of LHS indicators, we do\nnot provide a detailed theoretical rationale for the inclusion of\neach one in this report. Instead, we provide citations to reviews\nof life history measures or other publications where the use of\neach life history indicator is substantiated. We also do not\npresent psychometrics associated with each indicator in this\nsection. Because of the computational demands associated with\nusing SEM to examine 95 categorical and continuous variables,\nwe conducted a preliminary analysis to assess items for uni-\ndimensionality and also compute scores for use in our structural\nmodels. These procedures are described in Analyses section,\nand the psychometric properties of our LHS indicators are\nsummarized in Results section and presented in Table 2.\nIndicators of middle adult LHS\nSuper-K. We measured Super-K (i.e., the general factor)\nusing measures of the Big Five (i.e., agreeableness, openness\nto experience, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and extrover-\nsion; Dunkel & Decker, 2010; Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach,\nmental health (Figueredo & Rushton, 2009; Olderbak et al.,\n(Griskevicius, Tybur, Delton, & Robertson, 2011; Richardson,\nCastellano, Stone, & Sanning, 2016), pair-bonding (Olderbak\n& Figueredo, 2010), sexuality,5 number of children (Chisholm,\net al., 2009), and social closeness/support (Olderbak et al.,\nFigure 1. Bifactor versus second-order factor model. d \u00bc domain\nspecific; f \u00bc first-order factor; gen. \u00bc general; r \u00bc residual.\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\n2014). We also extended upon the findings reported by\nstance use on Super-K.\nMating competition. This study measured mating competition\naggression (Figueredo et al., 2005), number of sex partners\n(Richardson, Chen, Dai, Hardesty, & Swoboda, 2014), sexual-\nity, pair-bonding (Olderbak & Figueredo, 2010), number of\nof marriages (Jokela, Rotkirch, Rickard, Pettay, & Lummaa,\nalso attempted to replicate the findings reported by Richardson\nmating competition.\nLiability to substance use and abuse. Given the theoretical\nlinkage between LHS and substance use developed by Richard-\nson and Hardesty (2012), along with empirical findings indi-\ncating that life history dimensions subsumed adolescent and\nyoung adult liabilities to substance use (Gibbons et al., 2012;\nHampson, Andrews, Barckley, Gerrard, & Gibbons, 2016;\nbility to substance use/abuse in this study (as mentioned pre-\nviously). This allowed us to test whether the prior findings\nextended to middle adulthood. We measured liability to sub-\nstance use/abuse with indicators including tobacco use (smok-\ning), alcohol use and abuse, illicit drug use, and illicit drug\nabuse. We used 10 items to measure alcohol use and abuse,\n10 to measure breadth in illicit drug use (summed to form an\nindex), and 7 items to measure illicit drug abuse (for descrip-\ntions of all these items, see Table 2).\nChildhood environment\nEnvironmental unpredictability. This was indexed using items\nthat have been theoretically related to temporal variation in\nmorbidity\u00admortality (Ellis et al., 2009) and previously used\nto form this construct (e.g., see Brumbach, Figueredo, & Ellis,\n2009). These included 6 items assessing the number of times\nparticipants moved to new neighborhood, ever experienced that\ntheir family went on welfare, were ever homeless, or had par-\nents who divorced. The unpredictability index also included 2\nitems that assessed the consistency of rules set by participants'\nmothers and fathers (4-point scale ranging from never to a lot).\nEnvironmental harshness.\nHarsh parenting: Abusive, unsupportive child-rearing\ncan be an important cue to extrinsic morbidity\u00admor-\ntality or environmental harshness (for a review, see\nEllis et al., 2009). We assessed harsh parenting as\nexperience of emotional abuse by mother, emotional\nabuse by father, physical abuse by mother, physical\nabuse by father, severe physical abuse by mother, and\nsevere physical abuse by father (all 4-point items rang-\ning from not at all to a lot).\nSES: SES is another important cue to environmental\nharshness (Ellis et al., 2009) and is traditionally\nindexed by forming a composite of indicators such\nas parental income, educational attainment, and occu-\npational status (National Center for Education Statis-\ntics, 2012). In this study, we indexed SES using father\nand mother SES indices created by the survey devel-\nopers and also items that assessed respondents' per-\nceived financial level growing up (6-point item\nranging from a lot worse off than average to a lot\nbetter off) and self-reported highest educational levels\nachieved by mother and father.\nAnalyses\nBecause of the computational demands associated with using\nSEM to examine 95 categorical and continuous variables,6 we\nTable 1.

Principle components analysis7 was used to con-\nstruct composite parental harshness and SES.

Single indicators of Super-K and mating com-\npetition were analyzed as they were.\nThis study used SEM to test the structure of middle adult life\nhistory indicators along with whether middle adult life history\ndimensions reflected childhood environment as predicted by\nLHT. We used the MPlus Version 7.11 software package to\ntest our models and used the robust weighted least squares\n(WLSMV; Muth\u00b4\nen, du Toit, & Spisic, 1997) estimator because\nwe treated variables such as number of sexual partners and\nnumber of marriages as ordinal.8 Because we analyzed very\nlarge samples that provided a great deal of statistical power, all\nsignificance tests were conducted at the p < .001 level.\nGoodness-of-fit criteria. This study used a variety of fit indices in\norder to obtain a robust assessment of model fit. We considered\nthe substantive meaningfulness of the model, Tucker\u00adLewis\nindex (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) greater than .95\nof approximation (RMSEA) values of less than .05 (Browne &\nCudeck, 1993) as evidence of acceptable fit to the data. MPlus\nVersion 7.11 provides average fit indices and an average w2\nlikelihood ratio statistic (Kline, 2011) when multiple imputed\nsets are analyzed using WLSMV but not a pooled likelihood\nratio test. As mentioned, we observed modification indices\nacross the imputed sets to identify sources of misfit to the data.\nHypothesized models\nModel I. We first hypothesized a bifactor model in which all\nindicators of Super-K (described above) reflected a single\nlatent variable (i.e., the general factor). Further, the model\nincluded domain-specific personality and covitality factors that\nrepresented the variance in the five factors of personality and\nhealth and mental health, respectively, not explained by Super-\nK (the general factor). We also specified all indicators of mat-\ning competition as reflecting a common factor and examined\nwhether the variance in the domain-specific personality and\ncovitality factors (i.e., that unexplained by Super-K) reflected\nmating competition by regressing the former on the latter.\nliability to greater substance use reflected life history dimen-\nsions, we regressed liability to substance use/abuse on mating\ncompetition and also Super-K. We specified residual covar-\niances between alcohol use and abuse, and between illicit drug\nuse and abuse, given that we expected associations between\nthese constructs that were not explained by common liability\nto substance use/abuse. We also examined modification indices\nto discover any direct effects of mating competition on the Big\nFive as well as identify any cross-loadings of Super-K indica-\ntors on mating competition and vice versa. Finally, we\nobserved the correlation between the Super-K factor and mat-\ning competition for evidence they reflected the same\nunderlying dimension (i.e., a moderate or large correlation\nwould suggest that we needed to test a unidimensional model).\nModel II. If Model I fit the data well, we specified a second\nmodel that included our environmental constructs (Model II).\nDrawing upon LHT, research driven by psychosocial accelera-\ntion theory, and our discussion of the dimensionality of LHS,\nwe hypothesized that (a) harsh parenting and unpredictability\nwould predict greater mating competition and lower levels on\nSuper-K in middle adulthood, while (b) higher SES would\npredict greater mating competition and Super-K levels. The\nhypothesized SES effect on mating competition, which may\nseem surprising, was rooted in the finding that access to\nresources corresponds to higher levels on r and also K strate-\nencoded these hypotheses into Model II and regressed the\ndomain-specific factors, along with liability to substance use/\nabuse, on the environmental dimensions, given that it was\nunlikely that mating competition and Super-K mediated all\nenvironmental effects on personality and behavior, and also\ngiven that past research has linked substance use/abuse to envi-\nronmental dimensions (Ronel & Haimoff-Ayali, 2010).\nFinally, we specified a covariance between childhood SES and\nthe middle adult neighborhood quality residual because\nresearch suggests that parent SES is a robust correlate of off-\nResults\nAs mentioned, we carried out preliminary factor analyses to\ncompute scores for the life history and environmental domains\nwithin each imputed set. The results of these analyses are\ndetailed in Table 2, which includes loadings for all items and\nscores that reflected factors or were used to form composites.\nAcross the imputed sets, all items and scores loaded on their\nfactor or component at b \u00bc .30 or above. Table 2 illustrates the\npatterns of loadings with estimates from Imputation 1. All life\nhistory indicators were unidimensional except alcohol use/\nabuse and parental harshness. Two factors subsumed the alco-\nhol items--alcohol use and alcohol abuse (r \u00bc .40). We com-\nputed and saved scores for both factors and included them in\nour structural models. Two components emerged from the par-\nental harshness items--mother harshness and father harshness\n(r \u00bc .50). We computed scores on these two components and\nincluded their average in our structural models. Below we\ndescribe the results of our SEM analyses.\nModel I\nWe tested our first hypothesized model (Model I) and it was\noveridentified with 187 degrees of freedom. Fit indices (see\nTable 3) suggested that the model did not fit the data well\nshould be rejected. We first examined the model for misspe-\ncification as evidenced by nonsignificant factor loadings. We\nobserved that the effects of mating competition on social\nsupport (p \u00bc .57) and number of marriages (p \u00bc .75) were\n12 Evolutionary Psychology\nnonsignificant. We thus removed these parameters and did\nnot include number of marriages in any further analyses\nbecause modification indices did not suggest that it was\nrelated to any other factors. We then carried out a sequence\nof modifications to the model on the basis of large modifica-\ntion indices (i.e., >100) and theoretical rationale (i.e., there\nwas a substantive basis for each change). Modifications\nceased when no potential changes met both of these criteria.\nAs we carried out the sequence of changes, any factor\nloadings that became nonsignificant were removed. We note\nthat though this study was confirmatory in nature, the need\nfor model modifications was not surprising, given the very\nlarge number of constructs under study. Table 3 displays\neach modification and the corresponding improvement in fit\nto the data. The theoretical rationale for each change is\nprovided in the Online Supplementary Materials. After\ncarrying out the tabled modifications, we found that the\nobserved that mating competition and Super-K were uncor-\nModel II\nNext, we specified Model II by including our environmental\nvariables as a part of the model to be estimated. This model had\n202 degrees of freedom and fit the data marginally well (w2 \u00bc\nder, this model included environmental effects on all latent\nvariables as well as a covariance between childhood SES and\nthe middle adult neighborhood quality residual. Consistent\nwith past research (Griskevicius et al., 2011), the latter was\nobserved at r \u00bc .54. Modification indices suggested that\naggression should also be regressed on childhood SES. This\neffect was consistent with prior research linking lower child-\nhood SES to greater antisociality (Piotrowska, Stride, Croft, &\nRowe, 2015). We added this parameter and the resulting model\nhad 201 degrees of freedom and fit the data reasonably well\nLHS indicators. Our next step was examining the magnitude of\nthe factor loadings (see Figure 2 and Table 4, and for a graphic\nthat displays loadings only, see Online Supplementary\nMaterials). The Super-K factor's final 14 indicators were\nhealth/mental health, neuroticism (\u00c0), extroversion, agreeable-\nness, conscientiousness, openness to experience, positive\naffect, social support, aggression (\u00c0), neighborhood quality,\neducation, pair-bonding, sexuality, and # of children. Standar-\ndized factor loadings ranged from b \u00bc .07 (# of children) to .76\n(social support). Loadings equal to or above .30 were consid-\nered evidence, suggesting that indicators provided sufficiently\nvalid measurement of their constructs. The loadings for health/\nmental health, neuroticism, extroversion, agreeableness, con-\nscientiousness, openness to experience, positive affect, social\nsupport, aggression (\u00c0), education, and pair-bonding satisfied\nthis criterion. The loadings for neighborhood quality, sexuality,\nand number of children were below .30.\nWe also regressed liability to substance use/abuse on Super-\nK in an attempt to extend the findings (e.g., Richardson et al.,\nto middle adulthood. We found that Super-K had a moderate\nnegative effect on liability to substance use/abuse (b \u00bc \u00c0.43),\nwhich did not subsume alcohol abuse holding mating compe-\ntition constant. This implied that alcohol abuse was not scalar\ninvariant as an indicator of liability to substance use. Super-K\nwas unrelated to alcohol abuse. In the end, our findings suggest\nthat 12 indicators (i.e., health/mental health, neuroticism,\nextroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to\nTable 3.

Loadings\nranged from b \u00bc .36 (pair-bonding) to .72 (openness). For the\ndomain-specific covitality factor, the final indicators were\nhealth/mental health, neuroticism (\u00c0), positive affect, agree-\nableness (\u00c0), neighborhood quality, and aggression (\u00c0). Load-\nings ranged from b \u00bc .11 (agreeableness) to .67 (health/mental\nhealth) and only health/mental health and neuroticism had\nloadings above b \u00bc .30.\nFor mating competition, the final indicators were # of sexual\npartners, sexuality, risk-taking, aggression, # of children (\u00c0),\npair-bonding, neighborhood quality, agreeableness (\u00c0), and\n(\u00c0) neuroticism,. Loadings ranged from b \u00bc .14 (neighborhood\nquality) to .48 (aggression). The loadings for six indicators\nappeared to be equal to or greater than .30: # of sexual partners,\nsexuality, risk-taking, pair-bonding, aggression, and agreeable-\nness (\u00c0). By comparison, # of children, neighborhood quality,\nand neuroticism did not seem to adequately reflect their factor.\nHowever, we note that we regressed the domain-specific covi-\ntality and personality factors onto mating competition to test\nFigure 2. Final model of life history strategy indicators.\n14 Evolutionary Psychology\nwhether variance in the indicators of these two factors, not\nexplained by Super-K, was explained by mating competition.\nWe found that this was indeed the case. The effects of mating\ncompetition on covitality and personality were both moderate\nin size (b \u00bc .42 and .47, respectively), suggesting that mating\ncompetition was another important source of common varia-\ntion in indicators of Super-K. We note that, consistent with our\nModel I findings, the covariance between mating competition\ncovariances and correlations, see Table 5). In an additional step,\nwe constrained this covariance to 0 to test the hypothesis that the\ntwo dimensions were statistically independent. We found that\nmodel fit was not significantly different across the imputed sets,\nTLI \u00bc .93; RMSEA \u00bc .04, implying that we should not reject\nthe hypothesis that the covariance was nil.\nGiven that mating competition had direct effects as well as\nindirect effects through the domain-specific factors on some\nlife history indicators, we needed to estimate its total effects on\nthese indicators to better understand its influence. To explain\nthis further, mating competition could be understood as having\neffects common to indicators of the domain-specific factors\nthrough its impact on their factors. However, for some indica-\ntors, there was also a direct effect that reflected influence not\ncommon to the other traits. Consistent with this, the direct\n(b \u00bc .31) and indirect personality mediated (b \u00bc \u00c0.17) effects\non pair-bonding produced a total effect of b \u00bc .15; the direct\n(b \u00bc \u00c0.39) and indirect personality (b \u00bc .18) and covitality\n(b \u00bc \u00c0.06) mediated effects on agreeableness produced a total\neffect of b \u00bc \u00c0.27; the direct (b \u00bc .14) and indirect covitality-\nmediated (b \u00bc .08) effects on neighborhood quality produced a\ntotal effect of b \u00bc .22; and finally, the direct (b \u00bc .19) and\nTable 4. Final Structural Equation Modeling Unstandardized and Standardized Factor Loadings.\nIndicator Factor b SE p b\nNote. DS \u00bc domain specific; Cov \u00bc covariances.\nRichardson et al. 15\nindirect covitality-mediated effects (b \u00bc \u00c0.18) on neuroticism\nproduced a nil total effect (p \u00bc .824). We also saw that the\nindirect effect on aggression was nonsignificant (p \u00bc .003) and\ntherefore the direct and total effects were equal (b \u00bc .48). In\nlight of these findings, we reasoned that the total effect of pair-\nbonding was too small to be retained (conceptually) as an ade-\nquate indicator of mating competition.\nFor some indicators of the domain-specific factors, mating\ncompetition had only indirect effects. Specifically, mating\ncompetition had significant indirect effects, but no direct\neffects, on extroversion (b \u00bc .26), openness to experience\n(b \u00bc .33), conscientiousness (b \u00bc .18), health/mental health\n(b \u00bc .28), and positive affect (b \u00bc .09). Thus, we concluded\nthat extroversion, openness, and health/mental health might\nfunction as adequate indicators of mating competition. We note\nthat given the smaller effects of mating competition on positive\naffect and neuroticism, relative to health/mental health, the\nlatter effect may be more attributable to an effect on health\nthan mental health.\nWe also regressed liability to substance use/abuse on mating\ncompetition to test whether the findings that substance use\nreflects life history dimensions (e.g., Richardson et al., 2014,\n2016) extended to middle adulthood. We found that mating\ncompetition had a small to moderate effect on liability to sub-\nstance use/abuse (b \u00bc .29) and also a moderate effect on alco-\nhol abuse (b \u00bc .35). As a reminder, alcohol abuse did not reflect\ncommon liability to substance use/abuse, holding mating com-\npetition constant. In the end, our findings suggest that 10 indi-\ncators (i.e., # of sexual partners, sexuality, risk-taking,\naggression, agreeableness, extroversion, openness, health, alco-\nhol abuse, and liability to substance use/abuse) can likely pro-\nvide valid measurement of mating competition in future\nresearch, while five others (i.e., # of children, neighborhood\nquality, neuroticism, positive affect, and pair-bonding) may not.\nFinally, for liability to substance use/abuse, the final indi-\ncators were smoking (b \u00bc .29), illicit drug use (b \u00bc .45), illicit\ndrug abuse (b \u00bc .40), and alcohol use (b \u00bc .32). As mentioned,\nsurprisingly, alcohol abuse did not reflect common liability to\nsubstance use/abuse though it was residually correlated with\nalcohol use at r \u00bc .30, as expected. This suggested that alcohol\nabuse's etiology may be somewhat unique. We return to this\npoint in our description of the structural regression coefficients\nand in Discussion section. Finally, as expected, the illicit drug\nuse and abuse residuals were correlated at r \u00bc .50. These two\ncorrelations implied these variables were associated for reasons\nnot captured in our SEM. Notably, our model explained 33% of\nthe variance in common liability to substance use/abuse and\n12% of the variance in alcohol abuse.\nEnvironmental effects. After examining latent variable effects on\nlife history indicators, we moved on to interpret the magnitude\nof the environmental effects on our dimensions of middle adult\nLHS (see Figure 2 and Table 6). We found that unpredictability\nand harsh parenting had small negative effects on Super-K\n(both rounded to b \u00bc \u00c0.18), while childhood SES did not have\na significant effect on this life history dimension. By contrast,\nchildhood SES and parental harshness had moderate and small\neffects on mating competition (b \u00bc .43 and .14, respectively),\nwhile the effect of unpredictability on this life history dimen-\nsion was nonsignificant.10 This implies that the effects of child-\nhood environment on middle adult LHS are not homogeneous.\nWe return to this point in the Discussion section. Notably, our\nmodel explained 19% of the variance in mating competition but\njust 8% of the variance in Super-K.\nTable 5. Final Structural Equation Modeling Covariances and Correlations.\nIndicator Factor Cov SE p r\nNote. DS \u00bc domain specific; SES \u00bc socioeconomic status.\n16 Evolutionary Psychology\nChildhood SES also had a small effect (b \u00bc .12) on the\ndomain-specific covitality factor and all three environmental\nvariables had small positive effects on the domain-specific\npersonality factor (bs ranged from .12 to .14). Thus, there\nappear to be multiple pathways by which childhood environ-\nment may impact personality traits and also physical and men-\ntal health. Childhood unpredictability had a small direct effect\n(b \u00bc .17) on liability to substance use/abuse and childhood SES\nhad a small negative effect (b \u00bc \u00c0.19) on aggression. We\nobserved small negative correlations of childhood SES with\nunpredictability and parental harshness and a small positive\ncorrelation between unpredictability and harshness. Finally, for\nthose who may be interested in practical public health and well-\nbeing implications, we tested the indirect effects of the envi-\nronmental variables on each life history indicator closely\nrelated to health promotion and illness prevention efforts and\nincluded a description of these results in the Online Supple-\nmentary Materials.\nDiscussion\nThis study applied SEM with bifactor models to test the\ndimensionality of middle adult LHS indicators drawn from\nthe MIDUS study. From a factor modeling perspective, con-\nfirming the dimensionality of human life history indicators is\nthe first step in placing the psychometric study of human LHS\non more solid ground. The Brumbach et al. (2009) and\nthat in adolescence and young adulthood, a coherent mating\ncompetition dimension manifests as higher levels on indica-\ntors such as antisociality, multipartner sex, aggression, risk-\ntaking and delinquency, and substance use and abuse. Our\nfindings suggest that this dimension persists into middle\nadulthood, by which time a coherent Super-K factor also sub-\nsumes indicators of LHS. As suggested by Richardson et al.\n(2016), this Super-K factor may emerge through the norma-\ntive process of self-regulatory development.\nOur findings strongly suggest that middle adult LHS is not\nunidimensional on the second-order level but rather two-\ndimensional. Strikingly, mating competition and the Super-K\nfactor were statistically independent even though childhood\nSES was controlled. Although their pattern of correlation\nthrough environmental conditions seems consistent with LHT,\nthere appears to be no direct trade-off between them and no\nsingle score can locate the LHS of the participants in our sam-\nple. This finding challenges the growing literature that assumes\na single fast\u00adslow dimension (as described in our review) and\nalso neurobiological models contending that the fast\u00adslow\ntrade-off occurs at the neural level, such that activity may\ngenerally shift from novelty to familiarity (i.e., internal work-\ning model and attachment related) processing or in the reverse\ndirection (Tops, Koole, IJzerman, & Buisman-Pijlman, 2014).\nIndeed, our findings suggest that some people may be engaged\nin both sorts of processing while others are scarcely engaged in\neither. This is consistent with the Holtzman and Senne (2014)\nargument that a two-dimensional model is more consistent with\nthe human data and should be employed. While adaptations\nmay be regulating resource allocations in response to environ-\nment as predicted by LHT, the same proximate mechanisms do\nnot seem to be governing investment into indicators of mating\ncompetition and Super-K.\nFuture research should attempt to determine how our find-\nings of statistical independence might be reconciled with LHT.\nFor instance, researchers could try to identify the factors that\nTable 6. Final Structural Equation Modeling Unstandardized and Standardized Between Construct Regression Coefficients.\nIndicator Factor b SE p b\nNote. DS \u00bc domain specific; SES \u00bc socioeconomic status.\nRichardson et al. 17\nenable some people to invest highly in mating competition and\nalso Super-K. They could also examine if change in environ-\nmental factors over time explains the independence we found.\nPerhaps this could explain why early harshness and unpredict-\nability were related to personality, which develops early and\nremains reasonably stable, and less related to covitality, which\nmight be reflecting more recent conditions. Also, more\nresearch, like Kruger et al.'s research (2015), should also be\ncarried out to determine how people perceive and/or detect\nLHS in others. In this vein, it is interesting to note that vari-\nables like substance use/abuse, agreeableness, aggression, and\nharsh parenting are inversely related to one LHS dimension\nbut not the other--humans could use them to infer levels on\nboth dimensions. Finally, the idea of a fast\u00adslow dimension\nseems remarkably intuitive and this in itself might be valuable\nto examine. Perhaps it occurs partly because humans focus on\nthe detection of long-term mates low on mating competition\n(i.e., who will not invest resources elsewhere or engage in\ncuckoldry) and short-term mates that are ``available'' (i.e.,\nwithout a mate who will mate guard). Similarly, perhaps it\noccurs partly because people invested in Super-K benefit from\nconcealing mating effort from long-term mates and those\ninvested in mating competition benefit from concealing that\nthey have a long-term partner.\nOur findings suggest 12 indicators (i.e., health/mental\nhealth, neuroticism [\u00c0], extroversion, agreeableness, conscien-\ntiousness, openness to experience, positive affect, social sup-\nport, aggression [\u00c0], education, pair-bonding, and liability to\nsubstance use/abuse [\u00c0]) may provide valid measurement of\nSuper-K in future research. These findings are consistent with\npast research (e.g., Olderbak et al., 2014). Of course, more\nvalidation studies are needed to confirm this possibility, which\nmeans that it is not yet appropriate to treat these indicators as a\nscale. Although they may not provide very good indicators of\nSuper-K, we note that the effects on neighborhood quality and\nsexuality were consistent with LHT, given that (a) selection\ninto safer and higher quality environments is consistent with\ninvestment in the safe but low-yield decisions that are charac-\nteristic of slower LHS (Griskevicius et al., 2011), as well as\nparental effort, and (b) sexuality is an important aspect of love\nand attachment formation (Mikulincer, 2006).\nHigher Super-K levels implied slightly greater numbers of\nchildren, not fewer children as predicted by life history the-\norists studying humans (Figueredo et al., 2005). We note that\nin our two-dimensional model, mating competition and\nSuper-K might both be seen as fitness components and thus\nhigher levels on both could imply greater numbers of off-\nspring. In ancestral environments, the effect of mating com-\npetition might have been large while the effect of Super-K\nwas small, such that very fast strategists (high mating com-\npetition and low-K) had the most offspring and very slow\nstrategists (high-K and low mating competition) had fewer\nbut higher quality offspring than fast strategists. Notably,\npeople with the lowest scores on both dimensions would have\nhad the fewest offspring. Thus, perhaps the availability of\nbirth control in modern environments disrupts the effect of\nmating competition on number of offspring and this tends to\nlimit childbirth to those who intend to have children because\nthey want to parent (i.e., higher K people attempt to have\nchildren while lower K, higher mating competition people use\nbirth control to decouple sexual activity and reproduction). As\nanother possibility, postdemographic transition parents are\noften more isolated from their own parents and kin (Sear,\n2015). Perhaps higher K people are more likely to stay near\ntheir families and experience greater stability as a result of\naccessible kin networks. In turn, this may facilitate greater\nalloparental care, enabling them to comfortably support more\noffspring compared with their lower K counterparts. Future\nresearch should test these possibilities by incorporating data\nfrom more traditional populations and examining whether the\nsame pattern is detected.\nOur findings suggest 10 indicators (i.e., # of sexual partners,\nsexuality, risk-taking, aggression, agreeableness [\u00c0], extrover-\nsion, openness, health, alcohol abuse, and liability to substance\nuse/abuse) may provide valid measurement of mating compe-\ntition in future research. These findings are generally consistent\nnotable that mating competition did not have substantial effects\non numbers of marriages and children. The latter likely reflects\nthe availability of birth control in modern environments.\nAlthough they may not provide great indicators of mating\ncompetition, the positive effects on neighborhood quality and\npair-bonding are notable, given that previous research sug-\ngested that greater mating effort, dominance seeking, and\nrisk-taking should be negatively related to attachment forma-\ntion and investment in safe environments that are amenable to\nraising children (e.g., Figueredo et al., 2006). These findings\ncombine with the literature we reviewed, along with our find-\ning that mating competition and Super-K were statistically\nindependent, to provide strong indication that humans engage\nin pluralistic survival and reproductive strategies. Again,\nmore research is needed to attempt to reconcile these findings\nwith LHT.\nWe found that indeed, it was important to attend to the\nvariance in life history indicators not explained by Super-K.\nWe used bifactor models to accomplish this and the payoff was\ninformation about mating competition's effects on personality\nand covitality. Mating competition had substantial positive\neffects on extroversion and openness to experience, consistent\nwith past research (see Holtzman & Senne, 2014) and the\nnotion that traits such as extroversion could reflect effort\nexpended to influence people for reasons related to Super-K\nand also mating competition. Surprisingly, mating competition\nalso had a small positive effect on conscientiousness, which\nmay reflect the fact that some self-regulation and awareness is\nneeded to influence others, whatever one's motives. Finally,\nmating competition had a small to moderate positive effect on\nhealth/mental health. This may reflect the fact that, similar to\nincome and investment in markers of higher status, health is a\ncue to mate value (Nedelec & Beaver, 2014) that can facilitate\nmating effort and also extended periods of parental and nepo-\ntistic effort.\n18 Evolutionary Psychology\nBuilding upon Richardson and Hardesty's (2012) theoretical\nsynthesis and the subsequent empirical findings that liability to\nsubstance use reflects LHS dimensions (e.g., Richardson et al.,\nand Super-K both appeared to drive liability to substance use/\nabuse. However, only mating competition seemed to impact\nalcohol abuse, suggesting the etiology of alcohol abuse may\nbe somewhat unique. This finding may inform future substance\nabuse etiology research.\nFinally, we found that dimensions of environment did not\nhave homogeneous effects on the two dimensions of LHS.\nSuper-K appeared to be directly responsive to childhood unpre-\ndictability and parental harshness but not to childhood SES\n(though parental harshness and childhood SES were negatively\nassociated). In contrast, mating competition appeared to be\ndirectly responsive to childhood SES and parental harshness\nbut not unpredictability. Parental harshness was therefore the\nonly aspect of childhood environment that could be seen as\ncuing a diversion of resources from slower to faster LHS or\nvice versa (i.e., from Super-K to mating competition). This\nfinding is consistent with psychosocial acceleration theory\nmight be seen as having effects consistent with psychosocial\nacceleration theory, in that it is possible that harsher parental\npractices mediated an indirect effect on mating competition\nand Super-K.\nChildhood SES and unpredictability appeared to directly\nimpact only one LHS dimension apiece (i.e., Super-K or mat-\ning competition). These findings suggest that not only do at\nleast two dimensions subsume LHS indicators, these dimen-\nsions do not reflect childhood environment in a homogeneous\nmanner. This picture of human LHS is more complex but\noffers some intriguing avenues for future research. For\ninstance, our model implies that the fastest strategists (i.e.,\nhigh-mating competition and low Super-K) experienced high\nSES, greater unpredictability, and greater parental harshness,\nwhile the slowest strategists experienced low SES, less harsh\nparenting, and more predictable childhoods. This seems\ninconsistent with the current life history literature, but sug-\ngests that those who have the resources may use them to\nachieve mating success in addition to investing in safety and\nparenting effort. This is also consistent with between-species\nfindings that access to resources corresponds to higher levels\nof r-selected strategies, holding other factors constant (Sibly\nin the Future Directions section.\nPotential practical implications for public health initiatives\nflow from the findings reviewed above. First, high-SES indi-\nviduals have been largely neglected as the targets of health\npromotion and prevention efforts because they are not viewed\nas ``at-risk'' (Humensky, 2010). However, our model suggests\nthat adults who experienced high SES, harsh parenting, and\nunpredictability were more likely to manifest health-relevant\ntraits and behaviors like risk-taking, substance abuse, and mul-\ntipartner sex. Our findings confirm what past research has\nimplied about the effects of environment on Super-K--those\nwho experienced harsher parenting and greater unpredictability\nwere more likely to be characterized by lower Super-K scores\nand thus, holding mating competition constant, poorer mental\nand physical health, less social support, less educational\nattainment, and more severe substance use. Finally, our find-\nings suggest that intervention on middle adult Super-K and\nmating competition could produce broad and substantial\nimprovements in population health and well-being, while\nintervention on childhood environment could produce simi-\nlarly broad but very modest effects (i.e., very small to small).\nOf course, such intervention may still be worthwhile from an\neconomic perspective.\nLimitations\nThis study is limited by the use of self-report data and it is\nwidely recognized that such data can be affected by error in\nthe retrieval processes associated with memory and self-\npresentation bias. This limitation applies most significantly\nto the retrospective childhood measures, but because we are\naware of no data sets that contain measures broadly relevant\nto LHT that span from childhood to middle adulthood, we see\nthe MIDUS data as an important albeit imperfect source of\ninformation about LHS development. Second, causal infer-\nences based on the results presented here should remain ten-\ntative. Childhood environment cannot be understood as\ncompletely exogenous to middle adult LHS due to genetic\ninheritance. Given that the effects of environmental condi-\ntions were all small and that the genetic effects on these\nvariables as well as the middle adult LHS dimensions could\nbe as large or larger, genetic confounding is a significant\nconcern (Barnes, Boutwell, Beaver, Gibson, & Wright,\n2014), and future research should use genetic information\nto address this limitation. This concern extends to most\nresearch that has estimated environmental effects on life his-\ntory indicators or their underlying dimensions. Future\nresearch should employ behavioral genetic designs to control\nfor genetic confounding when estimating the extent to which\nLHS dimensions translate environmental harshness and\nunpredictability into life history indicators. Such studies may\nprovide important information about whether LHS develop-\nment is conditional and/or alternative.\nA final limitation that should be considered is that this study\nassumed, at least in part, the validity of the many psychological\nconstructs used as indicators of LHS. These constructs have\nbeen studied extensively with factor modeling and we estab-\nlished the unidimensionality of each scale before saving factor\nscores. We also used a method (i.e., Bartlett's) that produces\nunbiased estimates of the true factor scores (Hershberger,\n2005) and most of our life history domains contained one or\nmore survey developer created scale scores, which were pro-\nduced using validated scales. However, it is possible that one or\nmore of the issues raised in our critique of psychometric studies\nof LHS also apply to the literatures establishing these con-\nstructs' validities. Indeed, recent work suggests that stationarity\n(i.e., measurement invariance over time) does not hold for\nRichardson et al. 19\ndepression, a construct that has been studied extensively (Fried\net al., 2016). Unfortunately, it was simply outside the scope of\nthis study to establish fit and measurement invariance for all the\nconstructs included, or essentially an analysis of the validity of\nthe broader psychological literature. To the extent that LHS\nindicator items used in this study do not actually share prox-\nimate common causes that correspond to the factors subsuming\nthem in factor models, it may be correspondingly unreasonable\nto posit higher order LHS factors.\nFuture Directions\nWe touched upon directions for future research throughout the\nDiscussion section. Here we provide a concise summary of our\nmodel's implications for researchers wishing to carry out psy-\nchometric studies applying LHT to human variation. First, we\nhave followed Figueredo et al. (2006) in theorizing that com-\nmon adaptations underlie allocations of resources to fitness\ncomponents. One or more adaptations may carry out these\nallocations--our study suggests that it is not the same proxi-\nmate mechanisms that explain levels of investment in indica-\ntors of mating competition and Super-K. Importantly, this does\nnot imply that the fast\u00adslow LHS continuum is not useful for\nunderstanding human variation. Rather, a single factor simply\ndoesn't seem to capture all the important human life history\nvariation. Thus, future studies should measure Super-K and\nalso mating competition (see the Discussion section for lists\nof promising indicators).\nSecond, we contend that existing measures of K-factors will\nlikely continue to be useful, but more studies are needed to\nconfirm their structure and test them for measurement invar-\niance (e.g., across the sexes). In addition, mating effort scales\ncan used along with indicators such as sensation-seeking and\nrisk-taking to measure mating competition. Once the dimen-\nsionality of LHS indicators is better confirmed, future studies\ncan attempt to clarify the identities of the mating competition\nand Super-K factors by determining their core aspects (e.g.,\nperhaps internal working model formation and empathy form\nthe core of Super-K). They can also attempt to identify psy-\nchological and physiological mechanisms that mediate any\ntrade-offs between the two factors (e.g., testosterone or stress\nresponsivity). Finally, future studies should incorporate addi-\ntional life history indicators such as pubertal timing, sexual\ndebut, and life span to ensure that we are not simply document-\ning variation in lifestyle (see Copping et al., 2016). They\nshould also determine whether these indicators reflect or are\nantecedents of mating competition and Super-K. This can be\ndetermined, for instance, by using SEM and longitudinal panel\ndata to test the whether the Super-K factor is invariant across\ntime and manifests as things like pubertal timing earlier and\nalso parenting effort later.\nThird, our study provides some implications for future\ntests of psychosocial acceleration theory (see, e.g., Belsky\nhad a moderate positive effect on mating competition and no\ndirect effect on Super-K holding parental harshness and\nunpredictability constant, while harshness had effects consis-\ntent prior research and unpredictability had only a negative\ndirect effect on Super-K. Thus, higher childhood SES may\nactually increase mating competition despite a possible small\nindirect dampening effect through decreased parental harsh-\nness. Many studies have used SES as the sole indicator of\nharshness and this is probably inadequate because harshness\n(cues to mortality risk) and status/access to resources are\nunique in western environments and likely have unique\neffects. Thus, we suggest that future studies measure multiple\naspects of environment so that they can disentangle effects of\nstatus and access to resources from the effects of exposure to\nmortality cues. However, we also note that relying on SES\nmay be less problematic in traditional societies where varia-\ntion in wealth is probably more directly relevant to survival.\nFuture research can address this point.\nConclusions\nThis study used nationally representative data and SEM with\nbifactor models to confirm the structure of middle adult life\nhistory indicators. We found statistically independent mating\ncompetition and Super-K dimensions. The effects of parental\nharshness and childhood unpredictability on Super-K were\nconsistent with past research. However, childhood SES had a\nmoderate positive effect on mating competition and no effect\non Super-K. Moreover, unpredictability did not predict mating\ncompetition. We conclude that human LHS is more complex\nthat previously suggested, at least among adults in the United\nStates. In combination with our review, these findings suggest\nthat psychometric research on human LHS is in its early stages.\nFuture research should explore the absence of an effect\nbetween mating competition and Super-K; test these dimen-\nsions for invariance by sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic\nregion; conduct additional tests of whether the indicators that\nfunctioned well in this study may provide valid measurement\nof LHS; and address the potential for genetic and shared envi-\nronmental confounding of the associations between childhood\nenvironment and adult LHS.\nAuthors' Note\nThe MIDUS 1 study (Midlife in the U.S.) was supported by the John\nD. and Catherine T.

Our study would have\nincluded more than 25 latent variables, far too many for inclusion\nof all the measurement portions.\n7. We did not impose single-component solutions on the data.\n8. We considered using a Poisson model because these were count\ndata, but decided to treat them as ordinal because the vast majority\nof participants endorsed just a few of the possible counts (e.g., 99.\n4% of middle adults had three or fewer sexual partners and 99.0%\nhad three or fewer marriages). In addition, in the case of number\nof sex partners, the highest endorsable count was actually a cate-\ngory--``more than six partners.''\n9. In an additional step, we tested this model for differential indi-\ncator functioning by age due to the substantial range observed.\nWe included age as a covariate of the environmental components\nand regressed the mating competition and Super-K on it. One\nlarge modification index suggested that alcohol abuse should be\nregressed on age. We added this parameter and the resulting\nmodel fit the data slightly worse (comparative fit index [CFI] \u00bc\n.94, Tucker\u00adLewis index [TLI] \u00bc .91, and root mean square error\nof approximation [RMSEA] \u00bc .05) than Model 2, but no large\nmodification indices were observed. Thus, only alcohol abuse\nappeared to function differentially by age. Within levels of mating\ncompetition, older participants appeared to be more likely to\nabuse alcohol (b \u00bc .23).\n10. We also tested whether the environmental components interacted\nto predict the latent variables in the model. With interactions\nspecified, the model fit the data well (CFI \u00bc .96, TLI \u00bc .94, and\nRMSEA \u00bc .04) and no large modifications indices were observed.\nUnpredictability and harshness interacted to predict liability to\nsubstance use (b \u00bc .12), but no other significant effects were\nobserved.
