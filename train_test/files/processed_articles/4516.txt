In the United States, life-\nstyles are fast paced, food is plentiful, and social situations\nare often centered on food. Bulik and Taylor (2005) defined\novereating as eating more than the body needs to maintain\nhealth and a normal body weight, whereas Popkess-Vawter,\nBrandau, and Straub (1998) defined it as the taking in of\nexcessive food without hunger until feeling physically\nuncomfortable. The consequence of overeating is often the\nserious public health problem of obesity. The cost of obesity\ntotals US$147 billion annually and accounts for 9.7% of all\nmedical spending (Flaskerud, 2010). The psychological and\nbehavioral factors surrounding overeating are noted fre-\nquently in the literature; however, these are not emphasized\nin most prevention and treatment programs for overeating\nConsidering the cost, fiscally, physically, and psychologi-\ncally, more effective treatment for eating disorders should be\na priority for behavioral health and mental health nurses\nCodependency was a term first used in the chemical\ndependency literature to describe the dysfunctional pattern\nof behavior of an individual in a relationship with another\nperson who is addicted to alcohol (Cermak, 1986a).

Those suffering with codependency have\nboundary and control issues, low self-worth as well as physi-\ncal, emotional, and psychological consequences. Individuals\nsuffering with codependency are susceptible to stress-related\nmedical problems as well as psychological problems\nconcept of codependency has expanded past the addiction\nfield. Codependency has been described in situations inde-\npendent of chemical addiction and has been found to engen-\nder susceptibility to a myriad of health problems (Cermak,\n1991). Anxiety, depression, anger, and compulsivity are the\npsychological problems most frequently noted in the litera-\nture associated with overeating and codependency (Cullen &\nThree studies were found that suggest a connection\nbetween codependency and overeating; however, they did not\nspecifically address overeating behavior (Allison, 2005;\nined anorexia and bulimia, whereas Meyer and Russell (1998)\nexamined eating disorders, particularly bulimia. Allison\n(2005) assessed the influence of codependency and binge\neating on body mass index (BMI). There is a gap in the litera-\nture regarding the relationship between overeating, codepen-\ndency, and many potential confounding variables. To begin to\naddress this gap, the Codependency-Overeating Model\n(COM) was developed to provide enhanced knowledge of the\nconnections between these phenomena. Mental health nurses\nand other health care providers are in a unique position to use\nsuccessful interventions. The purpose of this study was to test\nthe COM by examining the relationships between overeating\nand the predictor variables of codependency, anxiety, depres-\nsion, anger, and compulsivity.\nCOM\nThe COM offers a framework for exploring proposed rela-\ntionships between overeating and codependency. The sub-\nstantial problem of overeating, the connection between\ncodependency and disordered eating along with the scar-\ncity of relevant empirical studies calls for more research in\nthis area. The COM was developed to clarify the proposed\nrelationship between codependency, overeating, and the\npsychological problems of anxiety depression, anger, and\ncompulsivity.\nThe nursing theoretical perspective for the development\nand testing of the COM as a nursing research concern was\nprovided by the Neuman Systems Model (NSM). The review\nof literature revealed that stressors are the origin of\ncodependency and overeating. Neuman's model illustrates a\nsystem in which nursing is concerned with the total person,\ntheir stressors, and the possible reactions to those stressors.\nAccording to the NSM, health problems are a concern to\nnursing, along with all the variables that affect a client's\nresponse to stressors (Neuman, 1982). Guided by the NSM,\na nurse can plan interventions to identify stressors, affect cli-\nent responses to stressors, decrease client exposure to actual\nand potential environmental stressors, and assist clients to\nadequately cope with stressors.\nThe COM was developed from the Hughes-Hammer\net al.'s (1998a) Model of Codependency. Hughes-Hammer\net al.'s model was guided in part by the Wegscheider-Cruse\nand Cruse's (1990) Codependency Model. The literature was\nsearched for correlations between the factors proposed in the\nmodel. Review of relevant empirical studies led to the final\nCOM (Figure 1). The Hughes-Hammer et al.'s (1998b)\nModel of Codependency is presented in Figure 2.\nMethod\nDesign and Research Questions\nThis study used a predictive model-testing correlational\ndesign to examine the overall predictive value of the COM\nand specifically the relationships between overeating, code-\npendency, anxiety, depression, anger, and compulsivity and\nselected demographic- and health-related variables. The\nspecific research questions addressed were as follows:\nResearch Question 1: Did codependency, anxiety,\ndepression, anger, or compulsivity predict overeat-\ning?\nResearch Question 2: Did any single codependency\nsymptom predict overeating? (Codependency symp-\ntoms included family of origin issues, other focus,\nself-worth, hiding self, and medical problems.)\nResearch Question 3: Did age, sex, race, personal his-\ntory with drugs/alcohol, previous hospitalizations\nfor mental health problems, or selected medical\nconditions predict overeating?\nResearch Question 4: Were the causal paths to overeat-\ning in the predictive model supported? What model\nof predictor variables best predicted overeating?\nSample and Setting\nThis study used a stratified cluster random sampling tech-\nnique. The sample was stratified by campus with a random\nselection of class sections chosen from all introductory psy-\nchology and sociology students within each campus and\namong online students. Based on the number of students\nenrolled in each campus and the online classes for psychology\nand sociology, the required participation from each campus\nand online class was proportionally assigned and randomly\nBynum et al. 3\nchosen by computer based on the class section number. The\nsampling frame included 1,653 students from three cam-\npuses enrolled in psychology or sociology classes in a\nMississippi (MS) community college. Students were eligible\nto participate if between the ages of 18 and 65 years and\nwere not enrolled in the college's nursing program where the\nresearcher is a faculty member.\nThe students were stratified by campus, with random\nselection of class sections. This sampling approach pro-\nduced 1,273 potential participants. However, due to stu-\ndent's absences and withdrawal from classes, questionnaires\nreturned the questionnaires (response rate = 74.3%) and\n567 participants completed all four questionnaires (response\nInstruments\nOvereating. Overeating, the variable of interest, was mea-\nsured with the Overeating Questionnaire (OQ), an 80-item\nself-report questionnaire published by Western Psychologi-\ncal Services (O'Donnell & Warren, 2010). The OQ measures\nthe key habits, thoughts, and attitudes related to obesity. The\novereating score relates to the tendency to continue to eat\neven after hunger is satisfied. The items contributing to the\novereating score included the following: \"I always eat too\nmuch; I can't say no to food at parties; If there is food left\nafter a meal, I finish it rather than put it away; I feel I should\nalways eat everything on my plate; I have gone on an eating\nbinge; I hide the fact that I eat too much from other people; I\nstuff myself when I eat; I have trouble controlling how much\nI eat.\" Cronbach's alpha for the OQ ranged from .79 to .88\nwith .80 for the Overeating scale. Test\u00adretest reliability\nranged from .64 to .94 with the Overeating scale reported as\n.64. The validity of the OQ is documented in the OQ manual\n(O'Donnell & Warren, 2010). The overeating raw score was\nconverted to a T-score by hand on each participant's profile\nsheet. The T-score is a normalized standard score with a\nmean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. The score\nprovides a comparison of an individual's scores with the\naverage performance of the normative group on which the\nFigure 1. Codependency-Overeating Model\nFigure 2.

Codependency scores were calculated\nfrom the Codependency Assessment Tool (CODAT), a\n25-item 5-point Likert-type scale. The participants were\nasked to circle how they feel as indicated by the item on a\nscale from 1 = rarely or never to 5 = most of the time. To\nprevent response-set bias, one item is reversed-scored.\nScoring for the CODAT includes a total score calculated by\nsumming the responses on all 25 items. The possible range\nof scores is 25 to 125 with minimal codependency score =\nSubscale scores can also be calculated, with a range of 5 to\n25 for each scale. Subscales include Other Focus, Self-\nWorth, Hiding Self, Medical Problems, and Family of Ori-\ngin. Reliability data for the CODAT including test\u00adretest\nreliability and alpha, respectively, is as follows: Other\n(Hughes-Hammer et al., 1998b). Detailed information\nregarding the development of the CODAT and the estab-\nlishment of instrument validity was reported by Hughes-\nHammer et al. (1998b). Demographic- and health-related\ninformation collected with the CODAT included gender,\nage, race, religion, marital status, number of children,\nemployment status, level of education, past or present men-\ntal health problems, and past or present alcohol or drug\nproblem for self, parents, spouse, or significant other\nAnxiety, depression, anger, and compulsivity. The psycho-\nlogical problems of anxiety, depression, compulsivity, and\nanger were measured with the Symptom Checklist-90-R\n(SCL-90-R), a 90-item multidimensional questionnaire\npublished by Pearson Education, Inc. (Derogatis, 1994).\nThe answers to the paper and pencil questionnaire were\nentered into Q LocalTM, a computerized scoring and report-\ning system. Item verification was completed for each ques-\ntionnaire. An interpretive report was generated with the raw\nand T-score entered into the spreadsheet. The depression\nscore reflects a range of the manifestations of clinical\ndepression, including symptoms of dysphoric mood and\naffect, feelings of hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, and other\ncognitive and somatic correlates of depression. The anxiety\nscore includes the general signs and somatic correlates of\nanxiety. The hostility score reflects the thoughts, feelings, or\nactions characteristic of anger. The obsessive-compulsive\nscore focuses on thoughts, impulses, and actions identified\nwith obsessive-compulsive clinical syndrome and measures\ncompulsivity. Internal consistency scores on a 1976 study\nranged from .77 for psychoticism to .90 for depression with\nsensitivity to .90 for depression. Test\u00adretest reliability for a\nsomatization to .83 for paranoid ideation and test\u00adretest reli-\nability for the Global Severity Index (GSI) as .84. The\nestablishment of validity for the instrument is detailed in the\nData collection procedure. After approval from the com-\nmunity college president and the university Institutional\nReview Board, the psychology and sociology instructors\nwere contacted for a convenient time during class for stu-\ndents to complete the questionnaires. If faculty could not\ngive class time for completion, the researcher was allowed\nenough time to explain the study with a locked box placed\nin the faculty's office for return of the questionnaires. All\npotential participants were given an oral and written descrip-\ntion of the study with assurances about confidentiality and\ntheir right to refuse to participate. The cover letter also\ninformed the participants that consent was implied by the\ncompletion and return of the questionnaire. The students\nwere given the option of participating in a random drawing\nfor three US$100 Wal-Mart gift cards as incentives to par-\nticipate. The researcher was the sole data collector and the\nonly individual with access to the questionnaires before\nidentifying information was removed.\nData analyses. The data were entered into SPSS (Version\n19). Auditing was completed with error rate <2%. Descrip-\ntive statistics were used to describe the sample. Correlations\nwere tested using Pearson's coefficient of correlation (Pear-\nson's r).\nResults\nDescription of the Sample\nOf the 567 participants completing all four questionnaires,\nparticipant listed gender as \"other\" (0.2%).

Likewise, the major-\nity of Inconsistent Responding (INC) scores (90.3%) were\n4, indicating that the responses were an accurate descrip-\ntion of self. Significant differences were noted when over-\neating was cross-tabulated with age. A greater incidence of\nhigh overeater scores was reported by the 22+ group\nTable 1.

Significant differences were\nnoted when codependency was cross-tabulated with race,\nacademic standing, hospitalization for mental health prob-\nlem, and past or present alcohol/drug problem (personal,\nspouse/significant other, and parents). Mild codependency\nwas reported by 32.1% of the White participants compared\nwith 21.3% of the Black participants, while 7.4% of Whites\nreported moderate/severe levels of codependency compared\nwith 3.8% of the Black participants.

Due to participants not answering all questions, several categories list frequency <567.\nBynum et al. 7\nRelationship BetweenVariables\nWhen selected demographic characteristics of the sample\nwere correlated with the variables of anxiety, depression,\ncompulsivity, and anger, a weak correlation was found\nbetween age and anxiety (r = .12), depression (r = .20), and\ncompulsivity (r =.20); otherwise, no significant correlations\nwere found. A weak correlation was found between code-\npendency and anxiety (r = .12) and between codependency\nand anger (r = .16).\nTesting of the COM\nRelated to Research Question 1, there were no significant\ncorrelations between overeating and any of the variables;\ntherefore, codependency, anxiety, depression, anger, or com-\npulsivity did not predict overeating. Related to Research\nQuestion 2, no significant correlations were noted when\ncodependency symptoms were correlated with overeating.\nRelated to Research Question 3, no significant correlations\nwere found when personal history with drugs/alcohol, previ-\nous hospitalizations for mental health problems, or medical\nconditions were correlated with overeating; therefore, these\ndemographic- and health-related characteristics did not pre-\ndict overeating. Related to Research Question 4, no signifi-\ncant correlations were found between codependency, anxiety,\ndepression, anger, compulsivity, and overeating; therefore,\nthe causal paths to overeating in the predictive model were\nnot supported.\nDiscussion\nThe literature on overeating and codependency has sum-\nmoned further clarification. In the 2001 article \"Is\nCodependency a Meaningful Concept,\" Stafford (2001)\ncalled for more research aimed at further validation of the\ncodependency construct. Codependency continues to be\ncriticized in the literature as a weak theory lacking an effec-\ntive operational definition. Although it has been asserted that\nno single theory adequately accounts for the development or\ntreatment of overeating as an eating disorder, it is considered\na serious disorder and effective treatment should be one of\nthe top priorities for behavioral health (Roman & Reay,\n2009). The current study was undertaken to examine the\nrelationship between overeating and codependency to address\nconcerns about both of these issues. Although the results of\nthis current study did not substantiate the predicted relation-\nships in the COM, several worthwhile findings were revealed\nthat contribute to the literature regarding codependency and\novereating.\nThe majority of participants in this study reported mini-\nmal codependency, which supports the findings in the litera-\nture that codependency is not a widespread problem in the\ngeneral population (Martsolf, 2002; Martsolf, Hughes-\nHammer, Estok, & Zeller, 1999; Martsolf, Sedlak, &\nDoheny, 2000). In the current study of students enrolled in a\ncommunity college in the mid-south, codependency scores\nwere higher in the White participants, those with mental\nhealth hospitalization histories, and with previous or\npast alcohol or drug problems for self, significant others, or\nparents. These discoveries about the prevalence of code-\npendency are congruent with findings from other studies\nData analysis in this study found a weak correlation between\ncodependency and anxiety, and between codependency and\nanger, which is consistent with the findings in past literature\nfound between codependency and depression, or between\ncodependency and compulsivity in this study, a finding that\nis inconsistent with other studies in the literature (Cullen &\nHughes-Hammer et al., 1998a). Reasons for the incongru-\nence in findings could include use of different instrumenta-\ntion for data collection and dissimilar demographic- and\nhealth-related variables. The sample in this study consisted\nof healthy nonpatients, the majority of whom were young,\nWhite, and single.\nAlthough the COM was grounded in the literature, this\nstudy found no statistically significant relationship between\novereating and anxiety, depression, compulsivity, or anger.\nThis finding is contrary to the literature that anxiety, depres-\nsion, anger, and compulsivity contributed to eating (Arnow,\ntion between codependency and eating issues was noted in\nthe literature; however, overeating was measured with\ninstruments other than the OQ, which was used in the\ncurrent study. The studies in the literature also differed from\nthe current study in sample size, ethnicity, mean age, rela-\ntionship, and/or weight status. Interestingly, 47.8% of the\nparticipants self-reported they were overweight or obese,\nbut only 14.3% reported themselves to be overeaters with\ntheir answers to the OQ. Although the INC and DEF scores\non the OQ indicated the participants answered based on\nitem content with low response bias, the validity of the\ninstrument to measure overeating is called into question.\nA careful research design, sampling plan, and strong\nrecruitment strategy were used in this study to control the\nextraneous variables and secure a representative sample;\nhowever, several limitations were noted. These limitations\ninclude response bias in the self-reported data, testing fatigue\nwith the use of four instruments, and instrument format and\nclarity. The instruments used in this study utilized different\nmethods of answering the questions, including circling, bub-\nbling, filling in blanks, and check marks. Some forms had\nperforations, flaps, as well as front-and-back answers, mak-\ning the process somewhat more difficult for some students.\nThe study findings are generalizable only to the students at\nthis MS college.\n8 SAGE Open\nRecommendations for Future Research\nQualitative inquiries are necessary to describe, explore, and\nexplain the phenomena of overeating. Additional studies are\nalso needed to develop stronger instruments to measure\novereating. This study could be replicated with more diverse\nparticipants who are more likely to have mild or moderate/\nsevere codependency levels. As has been noted, although the\nprevalence of codependency in the general population is\nrelatively low, it does create significant life disruptions for\nthose who are touched by its presence (Whitfield, 1991).\nTherefore, any research designed to examine codependency\nin relation to other variables needs to draw on a target popu-\nlation likely to be susceptible to codependency. In addition,\nrecruiting participants from addiction treatment centers, eat-\ning disorder (overeating) clinics, or psychology practices\nthat treat codependency or eating disorders could enhance\nthe sample characteristics.\nSummary\nA model of overeating has been carefully constructed to\nportray literature-based propositions about the complex\ninterrelations between overeating and codependency, medi-\nated and moderated by selected demographic- and psycho-\nlogical characteristics. This article describes the initial\nattempt to explore these complex interrelations in a single\nstudy. Although the relationships in the model were not\nstatistically significant and the predictive relationships were\nnot verified, the COM can provide a base for nursing\nresearch to guide future studies with different samples, uti-\nlizing different instruments, designs, and methodology.\nThis was a beginning step in gaining understanding of over-\neating and codependency and serves as a catalyst for future\nnursing research in this area.\nAuthors' Note\nThis article is based on the research conducted for the first author's\ndoctoral dissertation, which was completed in March, 2012, at the\nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi.\n"
