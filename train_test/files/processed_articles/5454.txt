Nevertheless, extraction and\nreconstruction based on perforator flaps has\nprovided the next step in reconstructive sur-\ngery with improved understanding of the\nvascular anatomy and cutaneous\nAccording to the Gent consensus,10 per-\nforator flaps comprise of skin and subcuta-\nneous fat that are provided with nutrition by\nperforators rising from deep vascular\narteries embedded in the muscle and intra-\nmuscular septa. Because of the anatomical\ncharacteristics of `skin and bone' in the\nlower leg, soft tissue defects are manifested\ndue to trauma and surgery, and the resulting\ndeep tendon and bone exposure all need flap\nrepair. Muscle tissues in the upper leg are\nvery abundant, more supple, and not easily\ndamaged. Therefore, the application of per-\nforator flaps or neurocutaneous vascular\nflap transposition can enable repair of a\nsoft tissue defect wound in one-third of the\nlower leg, foot and ankle. With further\nstudies, some researchers proposed the con-\ncept of propeller flaps.11\u00ad13 Because the tex-\nture of these flaps is similar to the recipient\nsite, in addition to their good appearance and\ntheir ability to partially or completely repair\nthe donor-site, their application has become\npedicle flaps, venous congestion is still the\nmajor postoperative complication and the\nprimary cause of flap necrosis.19,20 Ever\nsince the propeller flap concept was proposed\nin the 1990s for skin tissue reconstruction of\nthe body,21 it has gained popularity in the\nreconstruction of lower extremities due to its\nhigh flexibility and versatility. The propeller\nflap pertaining to the peroneal artery enables\nan initial incision from either the medial or\nlateral side, and a reliable perforator can be\ndesigned just by visual inspection.22\u00ad24 In\naddition, modification of the flap can be\neasily facilitated based on a perforator being\nchosen (one perforator is sufficient as it is able\nto provide an effective supply of blood to the\nentire flap). On the contrary, more perforators\nhinder rotation and may even result in the\nkinking of blood vessels.\nVarious issues have been raised on the use\nof perforator pedicle propeller flaps for soft\ntissue reconstruction, such as the challenge\nfaced by soft tissue reconstruction, the advan-\ntages of this technique, anatomical and\nphysiological details of perforator-based pro-\npeller flaps, as well as venous congestion of\nillustrate some of the surgical success that has\nbeen achieved at our institution based on the\nunderstanding of these concepts. Perforator\npedicle propeller flaps can be surgically\nimplemented for various medical conditions\nthat urgently require skin tissue reconstruc-\ntion.12\u00ad15 Using observations in clinical prac-\ntice, this current report describes the\ncharacteristics of the perforator vessel in the\nperoneal artery of the lower leg and explores\nthe methods used to reduce the postoperative\ncomplication of inverse venous flow.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective observational study\nenrolled consecutive patients with soft\ntissue defects of the distal lower leg, heel and\nfoot who underwent surgery using peroneal\nperforator-based propeller flaps in the\nDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery,\nZhejiang Province Tongde Hospital,\nHangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China\nPatients with vascular disease were excluded\nfrom this study.\nThis study did not require ethical\napproval as it was retrospective. Each\npatient provided written informed consent\nprior to surgery.\nSurgical procedures for peroneal artery\nperforator-based propeller flaps\nAnatomical definitions. Dissection causes the\nperoneal artery perforator-based flap to be\neasily raised, so that it can be used as a\npropeller flap.16 Such a flap is a local island\nfasciocutaneous flap arising from a dissected\nperforator. Here, the retrieved skin of the\nproximal leg may be used for surgical\nreconstruction at the regions of the distal\nlower extremity, based on a 180 perforator-\nbased propeller flap for a reliable coverage\nof the soft tissue defect. This surgical process\nis illustrated in a Figure 1.\nThe surgical procedure. Typically, the peroneal\nartery perforator-based propeller flaps can\nbe identified preoperatively by colour duplex\nDoppler ultrasound scanning and are\nlocated along the lateral aspect of the\nlower leg from the lateral malleolus\n(Figure 2a, Figure 3 \u00ad step 1). The next\nstep is to plan the shape and size of the\npropeller flap near regions of the major\nperforator proximal to the defect. The lon-\ngitudinal length of the flap is the distance\nbetween the perforator nearest to the defect\nregion added to the longitudinal length of\nthe defect (Figure 2b, Figure 3 \u00ad step 2).\nBased on the defect location, an option of\neither an anterior or posterior incision is\nmade. The surgical incision can be executed\nfrom one side to ensure that the major\nperforator is well nourished (Figure 2c,\nFigure 3 \u00ad step 3). If the position of the\nreal perforator is different from what was\nidentified by the preoperative Doppler ultra-\nsound scan, the size of the flap is adjusted\nappropriately according to the real position\nof the perforator vessel (Figure 2d, Figure 3\n\u00ad step 4).\nThe perforator-based propeller flap\nvaries in shape and size, depending on the\nlimiting spatial constraint of the perforator\nand on the defect region. As demonstrated\nin Figure 2e and Figure 3 \u00ad step 5, the skin is\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram illustrating the sur-\ngical procedure for peroneal artery perforator-\nbased propeller flap isolation. Dissection of the\nperforator enables rotation and allows sufficient\nmobility so that a fasciocutaneous flap can be\nisolated and is then rotated 180 like a `propeller'.\nThe opened section caused by the rotated flap being\nmoved away from its point of origin is then closed\nwith direct suturing or skin grafting.

The perforator is\ndissected to facilitate rotation and mobility,\nso that an isolated and mobilized fasciocu-\ntaneous flap can be formed and then rotated\nwhat makes it to a `propeller', and hence it\nFigure 2.

The\nopened donor-site area due to the rotation\nof the flap can then be skin grafted to close\nit, as shown by the lighter patch of skin\n(Figure 2g), or it can be sutured directly.\nIn summary, the details of the surgical\nprocedures are described as follows: (i) step\n1: the colour duplex Doppler ultrasound was\nused to examine and mark the position of\nthe peroneal perforator, in order to design\nthe flap before surgery; (ii) step 2: the flap\nwas designed based on the perforator place\nexamined prior to surgery, with the poster-\nior border of the fibula employed as an axis,\nFigure 3.

The big propeller is prox-\nimal to the axis point. The length of the big\npropeller is 0.5\u00ad1 cm longer than the dis-\ntance from the pivot point to the distal point\nof the wound. The small propeller is the area\nfrom axis point to the defect. The width of\nflap is 1\u00ad2 cm larger than the defect, and the\nthickness of the subcutaneous fat determines\nthis size difference; (iii) step 3: the anterior\nedge of the flap was dissected according to\nthe preoperative design. Then, the dissection\nwas performed at a site further from the\nlower part of the deep fascia to the inter-\nmuscular septum in the rear of the peroneus\nlongus and brevis; thereby, the peroneal\nperforator was dissected; (iv) step 4: the\nsize of flap was appropriately adjusted\naccording to the real position of the perfor-\nator vessel; (v) step 5: after fulfilling the flap\nharvesting, the perforator vessel was dis-\nsected to the main part of the peroneal\nartery, so as to increase the length of the\nvascular pedicle. The fascia tissues of the\nintermuscular septum around the vascular\npedicle were also carefully removed to\ndecrease the venous drainage obstacle\ncaused by the compression of the vascular\npedicle after rotation; (vi) step 6: the condi-\ntions of the vascular pedicle were observed\nafter its twisting and compression due to the\n180 rotation; (vii) step 7: the flap was\nsutured to the wound after the rotation if\nthe blood circulation was good, and the\ndonor-site of the flap was sutured directly.\nFree-skin-grafting could be carried out to\nrepair the donor-site in the case of the failure\nof direct suturing. Two weeks after the\noperation, the flaps had completely survived\nand the wound was healed. If the venous\nreturn was bad after the rotation, which\nindicates that the capillary hyperaemia reac-\ntion was quicker than normal, then the\nwound coverage was delayed. Delayed\ncoverage meant that the flap was rotated\nand covered the wound, but the wound was\nnot sutured around the pedicle of the flap;\nand 3\u00ad5 days later, when the flap swelling\nwas reduced, delayed suturing was under-\ntaken around the pedicle of the flap.\nIf the flap had venous congestion when\nthe patient came back from the ward, then\n`bleeding therapy' was used to manage it.\nThis involved cutting small incisions\n(approximately 5 mm in size) at the periph-\neral area of the flap and bleeding from these\nincisions was maintained using heparin\nsaline (25 U/ml). Careful monitoring was\nundertaken to prevent excessive blood loss.\nDuring follow-up, the flap and donor-\nsites were checked by the physicians and the\npatients were asked their views on the\nappearance of both sites.\nStatistical analyses\nLimited descriptive statistical analyses were\nperformed using the SPSS\u00d5 statistical pack-\nage, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5 and data are presented\nas mean \u00c6 SD.\nResults\npatients with soft tissue defects of the distal\nlower leg, heel and foot were successfully\ntreated using peroneal perforator-based pro-\npeller flaps.

All of the wounds were eventually\ncured. As the appearance of these flaps was\nsimilar to the tissues around the wounds and\nthere were no `dog ears' at the pedicles of the\nflaps, the flaps were considered to be cos-\nmetically acceptable by both the patients\nand doctors. The mean \u00c6 SD distance\nbetween the perforator vessels of the flaps\nforators that were 8.0 \u00c6 2.0 cm from the\nlateral malleolus. Complications included\nvenous congestion (nine patients), haemato-\ncele (one patient), infection (one patient),\nand skin grafting necrosis at the donor-site\n(one patient). The flaps in seven of the nine\npatients with venous congestion survived,\nbut two patients had necrosis at the distal\nsite requiring debridement and skin grafting.\nThe methods used to treat the venous con-\ngestion included delaying the wound cover-\nage in the three patients in whom the flap\nsurvived and bleeding therapy in five\npatients, of which two patients developed\nnecrosis. One of the nine patients had slight\nvenous congestion and the flap survived\nwithout any further processing.\nDiscussion\nThere are a number of important issues to\nconsider when implementing perforator-\nbased propeller flaps for soft tissue defect\nrepair of the lower limbs. When the soft\ntissue defect in the leg is so severe that it has\nexposed the internal tendons or bone struc-\ntures, the situation is complicated and\nrequires more surgical planning than with\nthe repair of less severe soft tissue defects. As\na result of the limited local cutaneous and\nmuscle flaps available for grafting around\nthe ankle, the preferred option is to have\ntissue transfer from the middle and upper leg\narea. The perforator-based propeller flap is\ncomparable to a local flap in terms of the\namount and firmness of the subcutaneous\ntissue, skin texture, and the possibility of\nreconstructing `like with like'. Similar to a\nlocal perforator flap, it is characterized by\nfreedom of choice of skin island shape and\ndimension, and safety of perfusion. Using a\nfree flap might be a more common proced-\nure, but it is well known that the free flap\nprocedure needs a higher technical level of\nsurgical expertise and more complex sur-\na perforator-based propeller flap requires a\nsimpler operation and shorter operating\ntimes, and can be performed without the\nstaff expertise and complex logistical setup.4\nThe use of a fibula osteoseptocutaneous flap\nprovides good evidence of how peroneal\nartery perforator-based propeller flaps are a\nbetter option for skin harvesting of a larger\narea.23,24 Furthermore, perforator-based\npropeller flaps offer versatility in terms of\nproviding different shapes and sizes, and they\ncan be easily retrieved from other parts of the\nbody for covering small defects in the lower\nleg.21,24 Most importantly, this procedure\nensures blood supply by avoiding the major\nblood vessels. In particular, its greater rota-\ntion versatility allows an easier distal lower\nleg soft tissue reconstruction. Detailed exam-\nination of the perforator-based propeller flap\ntechnique has shown it to be a highly reliable\nand the preferred surgical option for treating\nsoft tissue defects of the lower leg.12\u00ad14 It also\nprovides a good cosmetic postoperative\nappearance as shown in Figure 4.\nThe traditional fasciocutaneous flap\nalways has a skin bridge at the pedicle.\nKeeping the skin bridge at the base of a\npeninsular flap may in fact kink the pedicle,\nwhich might compromise the vascular\nsupply of the flap. This makes flap rotation\ndifficult and calls for the need to harvest a\nbigger flap.26\u00ad31 The propeller flap always\nneeds a skeleton of pedicle vessels, so that it\nrotation will work successfully as long as\nthe pedicle does not become tight after the\nflap rotation.\nAlternative local flaps are also used, such\nas the distally-based sural flap or the\ndistally-based peroneus brevis flap.32\u00ad34\nWounds that can to be covered by a pero-\nneal perforator-based pedicle propeller flap\ncan also be covered by both the distally-\nbased sural flap and the distally-based\nperoneus brevis flap; and these two flaps\nare easier to undertake surgically than the\npropeller flap at the pedicles of the flaps.32\u00ad34\nHowever, these two types of flaps produce\n`dog ears' at the pedicle after flap rotation. It\nis evident that the bulky `dog ears' of the\ntraditional fasciocutaneous flap is visually\nunappealing and if the aesthetics of the leg\nare poor, then the operation would need to\nbe performed again, especially if the ankle is\ndistorted and wearing footwear is not pos-\nsible. In this case, cosmetic surgery may also\nbe necessary. Furthermore, application of\nthe distally-based sural flap would damage\nthe nerve, which then leads to sensation\ndysfunction.27,28 In contrast, the peroneal\nperforator-based pedicle propeller flap does\nnot damage the nerve.16 In terms of post-\noperative complications, such as venous\ncongestion, haematocele, infection, and\nskin grafting necrosis at the donor-site, the\nrates of these are similar for the distally-\nbased sural flap, the distally-based peroneus\nbrevis flap and the peroneal perforator-\nThere are a number of disadvantages\nassociated with using perforator-based pro-\npeller flaps. Unfortunately, venous conges-\ntion cannot be totally avoided during the\npropeller flap operation because the walls of\nthe perforator vessels are more delicate\ncompared with the perforator arterial wall\nand it is difficult to control venous wall\nFigure 4. Examples of the aesthetics of the postoperative local flap reconstruction in four patients with soft\ntissue defects of the distal lower leg, heel and foot who were successfully treated using peroneal perforator-\nbased propeller flaps. These images demonstrate successful recovery and the good cosmetic appearance of\nthe soft tissue reconstruction in each of these patients. Each of the patients had no issue with wearing socks or\nshoes after the operation due to the nicely fitted contours of the flap over the defect.

After\nrotation of the flap, if the pedicle is pulled\ntightly it will lead to venous congestion. If\nthe pedicle is not bared, the deep fascia\naround the pedicle will compress the vessels\nin the pedicle when the flap is rotated.36\nVenous congestion is one of the most diffi-\ncult problems to deal with and constitutes\none of the main reasons for flap necro-\nsis.19,20 A precise preoperative plan can\nreduce the rate of venous congestion.37,38\nIn this present series of patients, colour\nduplex Doppler ultrasound was used pre-\noperatively to: (i) determine the position,\ndiameter and length of the peroneal artery\nperforator; and (ii) determine which perfor-\nator would be suitable for the flap. In the\ncurrent group of 36 patients, the mean \u00c6 SD\ndistance between the perforator and lateral\nthat were 8.0 \u00c6 2.0 cm from the lateral mal-\nleolus. The perforator always had ascending\nand descending branches, so that it can\nmake the flap longer.\nThe typical length of the flap may range\nfrom approximately 5 to 25 cm and have an\napproximate width from 3 to 8 cm. The\nperforator flap extraction is mostly\ndetermined by the nature of the soft tissue\ndefect and is usually around 3 to 25 cm\nabove the lateral malleolus. However, to\nrepair a soft tissue defect around the ankle,\nit is not practical to use a propeller flap if the\npedicle is far from the wound. The septocu-\ntaneous vessels from a peroneal artery can\nsupply a skin island of up to a length and\npatients, the length of the flap ranged from\n10 to 34 cm. The pivot point of the peroneal\nartery perforator-based flap is preferably\nbased on the distal perforators, as it can\nfacilitate a larger section of the proximal\nhealthy skin to be positioned over the soft\ntissue defect.38 The performance of the flap\nrelies on: (i) the flap length; (ii) the pedicle\nsize; and (iii) the rotation angle.21\nIn terms of the method used for pedicle\nrotation, the perforator artery is examined\nbefore and after rotation during surgery as\nshown in Figure 6. The strain on the blood\nvessel is carefully reduced. During the oper-\nation, the surgeon determines the diameter\nand number of concomitant veins of the\nperforator artery. Usually, there are two\nconcomitant veins, but sometimes only a\nsingle vein is available. Based on our experi-\nence, if the concomitant vein is single or if its\ndiameter is narrow, it is better that a\nFigure 5. Representative images showing venous congestion and tissue necrosis. The colour of the skin\npatch turns purple due to occlusion of the vein, which is known as venous congestion (a). On some occasions,\nit may lead to necrosis of the distal part of the flap (b). The colour version of this figure is available at: http://\nimr.sagepub.com.\nsuperficial vein of the flap should be micro-\nsurgically anastomosed to a recipient vein in\norder to increase the venous drainage from\nthe flap. The pedicle should be slack when\nflap rotation is performed. It is better to\ndissect the pedicle as much as possible,\nespecially when the rotation angle is more\nthan 120. A skeleton pedicle may be neces-\nsary. It has been demonstrated that the risk\nof vessel buckling is decreased when the per-\nforator is of 1-mm diameter and the vessel\nlength is more than 3 cm.35 The direction of\nrotation is also very important and it is\ncrucial to try different directions of rotation\nduring the operation (i.e. clockwise or\nanticlockwise rotation) in order to increase\nthe slackness of the pedicle.\nIn this current series of patients, the flap\nwas sutured in situ, then the tourniquet was\nrelaxed. The blood circulation of the flap\nwas then closely observed for 3\u00ad5 minutes,\ncarefully checking for the colour and capil-\nlary hyperaemia reaction. If the blood cir-\nculation was good, the flap was rotated to\ncover the defect. If the blood circulation was\ninsufficient, a delayed coverage method was\nemployed, which means that the flap was\nrotated to cover the wound, but the wound\nwas not sutured around the pedicle of the\nflap. When the swelling of the flap was\nFigure 7. Delaying coverage and suturing of the flap due to venous congestion. (a) If the surgeon finds that\nthe flap is too tight to suture during the operation, then the flap may not be completely sutured. (b) After 3\u00ad5\ndays, when the swelling of the flap has reduced, the surgeon can complete the suturing and wound coverage.\nThis helps to avoid the skin tearing.

The colour version of this figure is available at: http://imr.sagepub.com.\nreduced 3\u00ad5 days later, suturing was then\nperformed (Figure 7).\nAnother way to rectify the problem of\nvenous congestion is to massage the flap\nfrom the peripheral margins towards the\ncentre. If the venous congestion persists, a\nfew sutures can be loosened at the flap edge\nand adequate massaging can be performed\nto relieve the venous congestion.24 If the\nvenous congestion can't be released by\nmassaging, then bleeding therapy can be\nused as follows. Some small incisions\n(approximately 5 mm in size) can be made\naround the flap to allow continuous bleeding\nof the flap. If this method is employed, then\nphysicians must monitor blood pressure and\nheart rate, because in the case of excessive\nbleeding, blood transfusion will need to be\ngiven immediately (Figure 8).\nIn conclusion, the perforator-based pro-\npeller flap technique provides a similar tex-\nture of skin as that of the recipient area, a\nlarge range of possible rotation, an easy\noperation and a small wound. In addition,\nthe donor-site of the flap can be closed\ndirectly without influencing the appearance.\nDue to the aforementioned advantages\nassociated with using a peroneal perfora-\ntor-based propeller flap, it has been widely\nused in clinical practice to repair soft tissue\ndefects of the lower part of the leg, foot and\nankle. A precondition of using this type of\nflap is the ability to preoperatively locate an\nappropriate perforator using colour duplex\nDoppler ultrasound. If one cannot be\nlocated, then it is more appropriate to use\na distally-based sural flap or a free flap\ntechnique. Locating the precise position of\nthe perforator preoperatively is one of the\nmost important issues when planning to use\nthis type of flap technique and in our\nopinion, colour Doppler is the best way to\nachieve this. Alternative methods, such as\nmagnetic resonance angiography,41 have\nalso been suggested to identify the precise\nposition of the perforator. Venous conges-\ntion remains the main complication post-\noperatively and proper pedicle processing\nand flap design can improve venous conges-\ntion. Based on our experience, when venous\ncongestion occurs after surgery, delaying the\nwound coverage and bleeding therapy are\nuseful methods for controlling it.\n"
