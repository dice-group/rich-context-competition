A woman's physical attractiveness is a cardinal\ncomponent of women's mate value. We correlated observer-assessed physical\nattractiveness (face, body, and overall) with expressed preferences for four clusters of mate\ncharacteristics (N = 214): (1) hypothesized good-gene indicators (e.g., masculinity,\nsexiness); (2) hypothesized good investment indicators (e.g., potential income); (3) good\nparenting indicators (e.g., desire for home and children), and (4) good partner indicators\n(e.g., being a loving partner). Results supported the hypothesis that high mate value\nwomen, as indexed by observer-judged physical attractiveness, expressed elevated\nstandards for all four clusters of mate characteristics. Discussion focuses on potential\ndesign features of the hypothesized mate-value calibration adaptation, and suggests an\nimportant modification of the trade-off model of women's mating. A minority of women--\nnotably those low in mate value who are able to escape male mate guarding and the\nmanifold costs of an exposed infidelity--will pursue a mixed mating strategy, obtaining\ninvestment from one man and good genes from an extra-pair copulation partner (as the\ntrade-off model predicts). Since the vast majority of women secure genes and direct\nbenefits from the same man, however, most women will attempt to secure the best\ncombination of all desired qualities from the same man.\n",

Much empirical work has documented how mate preferences shift\naccording to context. Women pursuing short-term mating compared to long-term mating,\nfor example, increase the importance they place on a man's physical attractiveness, sex\nappeal, muscularity, and extravagant and immediate resource displays (Buss and Schmitt,\nHaselton and Gangestad, 2006; Haselton and Miller, 2006; Pawlowski and Jasienska,\n2005). Women pursuing long-term mating, in contrast, place greater importance on\nresource acquisition potential, such as \"has a promising career\" and \"has good financial\nMate preferences have been shown to shift as a function of personal and ecological\ncontexts. In ecologies with a high prevalence of parasites, for example, both sexes increase\nthe importance they place on physical attractiveness, presumed to be a powerful health cue\n(Gangestad and Buss, 1993). Mate preferences have also been shown to vary according to\noperational sex ratio (Stone, Shackelford, and Buss, 2007), cultural norms surrounding\npremarital sex (Buss, 1989), menstrual cycle (Gangestad et al., 2007; Pillsworth, Haselton,\nlegally polygynous versus presumptively monogamous) (Buss, 1989). One personal\ncircumstance that has not explored in depth, however, is the role of mate value in affecting\nstandards imposed on potential mates.\nGangestad and Simpson (2000) hypothesize that women make trade-offs in mating\nalong two dimensions--good gene fitness indicators and good investment indicators. Good\ngene indicators are hypothesized to include masculinity, physical attractiveness,\nmuscularity, symmetry, intelligence, and \"confrontativeness\" (Gangestad, Garver-Apgar,\nand Simpson, 2007). Good investment indicators are hypothesized to include resources and\nresource acquisition potential (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Women might also choose \"good\ndad\" indicators such as warmth and kindness (La Cerra, 1994). Because most women\ncannot \"get it all,\" they are hypothesized to favor investment and perhaps \"good dad\"\nindicators in long-term mating, while choosing short-term affair partners who possess\nindicators of good genes (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Gangestad et al., 2007). As a\ncaveat, it must be noted that nearly all stable personal characteristics show moderate\nheritability (Larsen and Buss, 2008), and hence qualities associated with being a \"good\ndad\" or \"good provider\" may also provide \"good genes.\"\nIdeally, however, a woman would want all positive mate characteristics thus far\nidentified in the scientific literature, and perhaps even more. We propose that women\nshould value at least four clusters of characteristics in a long-term mate: (1) good genes\nindicators (Buss and Schmitt, 1993), (2) good resource acquisition indicators (Buss, 1989;\nThese clusters may or may not covary--an empirical issue yet to be determined. A man\ngood at acquiring resources that can be channeled to a woman and her children, for\nexample, may or may not be a good dad or a good partner. On the other hand, it is possible\nthat these clusters covary. Gangestad et al. (2007) reasonably argue that for most women\nAttractive women want it all\nthere must be a tradeoff between good genes and good investment indicators, but it is\npossible that some characteristics simultaneously signal good genes, good investment, and\nother sought-after indicators. A prime example is the trait of \"intelligence,\" which is known\nto be highly heritable (De Fries et al., 2000) as well as being positively correlated with\nhealth, longevity, income, and socio-economic status (Jencks, 1979; Gottfredson and\nDeary, 2004). Some traits, in short, may simultaneously signal good genes, good health,\ngood investment ability, and possibly good parenting proclivities.\nMen who have all four clusters of desirable characteristics, of course, are rare,\nhighly sought after, and hence difficult for most women to attract and retain. Gangestad and\nhis colleagues (2000, 2007) argue that men with good-genes indicators are likely to pursue\na short-term rather than a long-term mating strategy, and hence be reluctant to commit to\none woman. Consequently, according to this argument, women have evolved adaptations\nfor choosing a high-investing man as a long-term partner, while securing good genes\nthrough extra-pair copulations. In short, Gangestad and colleagues propose that women\nhave evolved a mixed mating strategy, with the proper evolved function of female extra-\npair copulations (EPCs) being securing access to superior genes. Versions of these\narguments, albeit without using the concept of \"tradeoffs,\" also have been previously\nHypotheses about human adaptations must include, implicitly or explicitly, the\nassumption that the relevant ancestral conditions for such adaptations to evolve were\nstatistically recurrent over deep time. Based on all available ethnographic data, the most\nreproductively successful men historically and cross-culturally were those who married\nyoung, secured multiple wives, and opportunistically engaged in sex with other men's\nwives when the risks were low (Symons, 1979; personal communication, October 17,\n2007). Men who were successful at having extra-pair copulations were precisely the same\nmen who were most successful at acquiring wives--those who were high in status, good\nhunters, successful warriors, headmen, and successful intrasexual competitors. In the\nhuman ancestral environment, in short, it is highly unlikely that there existed a pool of\ndesirable males who remained single and pursued an exclusively short-term mating strategy\nThese conditions contrast starkly with those of the modern environment, where on large\ncollege campuses and in large cities such pools of unmated men exist. Thus, if women have\nevolved a mixed mating strategy, adaptations to secure investment from a husband and\ngood genes from an EPC partner, the EPC partner historically was likely to have been a\nsuccessful polygynously mated man.\nAs a general rule, humans assortatively mate on overall mate value (Buss,\nattract other \"9s.\" Theoretically, some women--those highest in mate value--should be\nable to attract and retain men who have both good gene indicators and good investment\nindicators.\nPhysical attractiveness is a cardinal component of women's mate value (Buss, 1989;\nphysical attractiveness as a \"necessity\" rather than a \"luxury\" in mating (Li, Bailey,\nKenrick, and Linsemeier, 2002). Consequently, a woman's mate value, as indicated by her\nphysical attractiveness, will influence the quality of the man she is able to attract as a long-\nterm mate. This leads to the central hypothesis of this article: Women high in mate value,\nAttractive women want it all\ncompared to those lower in mate value, should impose higher standards for a suite of\ndesirable characteristics, including hypothesized good-gene indicators, good investment\nindicators, good parenting indicators, and good partner indicators. The hypothesis, in\nshort, proposes an adaptation in women that adjusts their standards up or down according\nto their own mate value. This hypothesis has existed in various forms for many years (e.g.,\nand Perrett, 2001; Thornhill and Gangestad, in press). Buss and Schmitt (1993), for\nexample, argued that \" . . . expressed mate preferences may be calibrated up or down\ndepending on one's mate value\" (p. 230). Little et al. (2001) proposed and found that\nwomen who rated themselves high on physical attractiveness will express stronger\npreferences for men who display two cues hypothesized to indicate heritable fitness--\nmasculinity and symmetry. Nonetheless, the broader hypothesis that high mate value\nwomen want it all has never been comprehensively tested.\nSeveral studies find circumstantial support for this hypothesis. Two studies found\nthat women who were younger and higher on self-rated attractiveness specified a longer list\nof traits that they sought or required in a potential mate than did women lower in these key\nSimilar results have been found in Japan (Oda, 2001) and Brazil (Campos, Otta, and\nSiqueira, 2002). Another study found that women higher on self-rated physical\nattractiveness expressed a greater attraction for more masculine faces than did women\nlower on self-rated attractiveness (Little, Penton-Voak, Burt, and Perrett, 2001). Women\nwith a lower waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)--a well-documented indicator of female fertility\n(Singh, 1993)--express a stronger attraction to more masculinized male faces than do\nwomen with a higher WHR (Penton-Voak, et al., 2003). Another study found that women\nwith a relatively low WHR had stronger preferences for mates with resources, although\ncontrary to the hypothesis, women with a higher WHR expressed stronger preferences for\nmale attractiveness (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2008). And attractive and feminine women\nshow stronger preferences for masculinized male voices than do less attractive and less\nfeminine women (Little, et al., 2001; Feinberg, et al., 2006). The studies on masculinity are\nbased on the premise that the trait of masculinity is a good-genes health indicator. The\nrationale is that testosterone, which produces masculine features, compromises the immune\nsystem. Consequently, during adolescence when facial features and voice take their adult\nform, only those males who are extremely healthy can \"afford\" to produce high levels of\ntestosterone.\nWhereas the previous studies have focused on a delimited number of traits, notably\nmasculine appearance and vocal quality, the current study sought to examine a large pool\nof potential traits. We sought to examine four clusters of expressed preference traits: (1)\ntraits that have been hypothesized in the scientific literature to be indicators of good genes:\nmasculinity, physical attractiveness, sex appeal, physical fitness, and intelligence\n(Gangestad et al., 2007; Miller, 2000); good investment ability indicators: potential income,\ngood earning capacity, education, ambition and industriousness, favorable social status, and\nsomewhat older age (all of these are known to be directly or indirectly linked with resource\ngood parenting indicators: desire for home and children, fondness of children, emotional\nstability and maturity, and kind and understanding (the latter pair--kind and\nunderstanding--has also been hypothesized to be indicators of good investment\nAttractive women want it all\nproclivities--see Gangestad et al., 2007); and (4) traits hypothesized to be good partner\nindicators: being a loving partner, devoted to you, and loyal (perhaps best conceptualized\nas signs of emotional commitment). Emotional stability and maturity, hypothesized to be a\ngood parenting indicator, could also serve as a good partner indicator. Whereas most\nprevious studies have relied on self-rated attractiveness, the current study used a composite\nof impartial male and female interviewers who interviewed the participants for 40 minutes,\nand subsequently provided ratings facial attractiveness, bodily attractiveness, and overall\nattractiveness. Thus, judgments of attractiveness and expressed mate preferences came\nfrom entirely separate and independent data sources.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nless than one year at the time of testing. Participants were obtained from the public record\nof marriage licenses issued within a large county in the Midwest United States. All couples\nwho had been married within the designated time period were contacted by letter and\ninvited to participate in this study. The mean age of the male sample was 25.46 years (SD =\nCouples were given $25 per couple in return for their participation.\nProcedure\nParticipants engaged in three separate episodes of assessment as part of a large set\nof studies. First, they received through the mail a battery of instruments to be completed at\nhome in their spare time. Second, participants came to a laboratory testing session\napproximately one week after receiving the first battery. During this testing session,\nspouses were separated to preserve independence and to prevent contamination from\ncontact or discussion. It was during this second testing session that participants completed\nfour instruments relevant to the present report: Factors in Choosing a Mate, Preferences\nConcerning Potential Mates, Family and Marital Preference Questionnaire, and Goals\nWanted in a Partner. Third, couples were interviewed toward the end of the second testing\nsession using a standard set of interview questions to provide information about the\ncouple's relationship and to give the interviewers an opportunity to observe participants so\nthat they could provide independent assessments of each participant's physical\nattractiveness (face, body, and overall attractiveness). Confidentiality of all responses was\nassured. Not even the participant's spouse could obtain responses of their partner without\nwritten permission from his or her partner.\nMate Preferences Instruments\nThe \"Factors in Choosing a Mate\" originally was developed by sociologists in the\n1930s (see Hill, 1945). This instrument seeks biographical information, age preferences in\na partner, and has participants rate 18 mate characteristics on a scale that ranges from \"0\"\n(irrelevant or unimportant) to \"3\" (indispensable). The \"Preferences Concerning Potential\nMates Questionnaire,\" based on a factor analysis of a much larger instrument (see Buss and\nBarnes, 1986), contains 13 mate characteristics that participants rank from \"1\" (most\nimportant) to \"13\" (least important). The \"Family and Marital Preference Questionnaire\"\nAttractive women want it all\n(FMPQ) was originally developed by Gough (1973), and expanded by Buss and Barnes\n(1986). It contains 83 mate characteristics, which participants range on a five-point scale\nranging from \"+2\" (very desirable) through \"0\" (inconsequential) to \"-2\" (very\nundesirable). Only one study to our knowledge has examined the test-retest reliability of\nmate preferences (Shackelford, Schmitt, and Buss, 2005). That study, using the Factors in\nChoosing a Mate instrument, found that most mate preferences showed moderate temporal\nstability over a three-year time span, averaging +.51 for men and +.54 for women, which is\nconsidered impressive for single-item measures (Nunnally, 1978).\nJudgments of Physical Attractiveness\nParticipants were interviewed by one male and one female interviewer, drawn from\na rotating team of eight interviewers. Immediately following the interview, each of the two\ninterviewers independently evaluated each participant on three seven-point scales:\nbody; overall unattractive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 overall attractive. The interviewer's ratings were\nhighly correlated, averaging +.60 for the ratings of the male participants and +.66 for the\nfemale participants (by way of contrast, the average correlations between any two judges\non ratings of physical attractiveness is typically around +.50--see Berscheid and Walster,\n1974). Consequently, the ratings made by the male and female interviewers were\ncomposited with unit weighting to provide more reliable indices of facial, bodily, and\noverall attractiveness.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the correlations between the three measures of physical\nattractiveness derived from the interviewers and the expressed mate preferences of the\nfemale participants. It is organized into the four clusters of a priori chosen hypothesized\nindicators: Traits hypothesized to be good genes indicators in the published literature such\nas masculinity, physical attractiveness, and intelligence; traits known to be good investment\nability indicators, such as financial resources; traits hypothesized in the literature to be\ngood parenting indicators (e.g., kind and understanding) as well as those of high and\nobvious face-validity (e.g., \"raising children well\" as a high goal priority); and good\npartner indicators of high and obvious face-validity (e.g., \"devoted to you\").\nHypothesized good genes indicators\nPhysically attractive women expressed significantly stronger preferences for five of\nthe six hypothesized good genes indicators--mates who are more masculine, physically\nattractive, good looking, sex appeal, and physically fit. The sole exception was intelligence,\nwhich was not valued more by physically attractive than less attractive women. Men's\noverall physical attractiveness, in contrast, was significantly correlated with only one\nhypothesized good genes indicator--physically fit (r = +.24, p < .05).\nGood investment ability indicators\nWomen's overall physical attractiveness was positively correlated with all six of the\ngood investment abilities, in four cases significantly so--income potential, good earning\ncapacity, college graduate, and older then self. In contrast, men's overall physical\nAttractive women want it all\nattractiveness was correlated significantly only with a preference for a mate who is a\nHypothesized good parenting indicators\nWomen's overall physical attractiveness was positively correlate with all six of the\ngood parenting indicators, in five cases significantly so--desire for home and children,\nfond of children, likes children, and has raising children well as a goal priority. The\ncorrelations for kind and understanding were positive, but not significantly so. Men's\noverall physical attractiveness, in contrast, correlated positively and significantly with only\none good parenting indicator--raising children well as a goal priority (r = +.19, p < .05).\nTable 1: Correlations Between Women's Attractiveness and Mate Characteristics Desired\nFace Body Overall Attractiveness Mate Characteristic\n\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\nHypothesized Good Gene Indicators\nGood Investment Ability Indicators\nHypothesized Good Parenting Indicators\nHypothesized Good Partner Indicators\n_________________________________________________________________________\n*p < .05, two-tailed; **p < .01, two-tailed.

Only \"being a loving partner\" as a goal\nAttractive women want it all\npriority of the potential partner proved to be statistically significant. In contrast, men's\nphysical attractiveness was not positively and significantly correlated with any of the good\npartner indicators (e.g., where women's overall physical attractiveness correlated with\ndesire for the characteristic \"being a loving partner\" with an r = .24, p < .05, men's\nattractiveness correlated with this desire with an r = .05, ns).\nDiscussion\nThe results point to a singular conclusion: Attractive women express higher\nstandards for nearly all hypothesized indicators of good genes, good investment abilities,\ngood parenting abilities, and good partner traits. Physical attractiveness in men, with very\nfew exceptions, is not linked with higher standards for these four clusters of long-term mate\ncharacteristics. These results support the central hypothesis of this article--that women\nhigh in the cardinal indicator of female mate value raise their standards for the traits that\nare hypothesized to have been historically most critical to female reproductive success.\nThese results support the existence of the hypothesized mate value calibration adaptation.\nThe current results converge well with nearly all previous studies about what\nattractive women want. Whereas Campos, Otta, and Siqueira (2002), Pawlowski and\nattractive women listed a larger number of sought-after traits, the current study found that\nobserver-judged attractiveness in women is linked with elevated preferences across all four\nkey clusters of traits. Whereas previous studies have found that female attractiveness in\nwomen was linked with stronger preferences for hypothesized good-genes indicators of\nthe current study found that observer-judged physical attractiveness in women was linked\nwith a stronger preference for masculinity, as well as other hypothesized good-genes\nindicators such as physical attractiveness, sex appeal, and physical fitness. There exists one\ndiscrepancy. Whereas the current study found that attractive women expressed stronger\npreferences for all four clusters of characteristics, including resources and physical\nattractiveness, Pawlowski and Jasienska (2008) found that attractive women (as gauged by\nlow WHR) expressed stronger preferences only for resources; however, contrary to the\ncurrent study and contrary to their own hypothesis, they found that less attractive women\n(those with a higher WHR) expressed a stronger preference for male attractiveness. Only\nfuture studies can resolve these apparently discrepant findings.\nOne other puzzle remains, centering on the trait of intelligence. Intelligence has\nbeen hypothesized to be one of the cardinal indicators of good genes (Gangestad et al.,\n2007; Miller, 2000). The current study, however, did not find that attractive women\nexpress a stronger preference than less attractive women for intelligence in a mate.\nFurthermore, Gangestad et al. (2007) failed to find the hypothesized female shift in valuing\nintelligence more around ovulation. Although Gangestad and his colleagues state that\nreaders should not reject intelligence as a good-genes indicator based on their single study,\nthe current study may raise an additional doubt or add to the puzzle. If intelligence is\nindeed a powerful indicator of good genes, as it should be on theoretical and empirical\ngrounds, then attractive women should value it more according to the hypothesis articulated\nin the current article (which they do not) and women should value it more around ovulation\n(especially in short-term mates) according to the trade-off model (which they do not).\nAttractive women want it all\nFuture research could profitably be directed to resolving puzzle of why women's\npreferences for intelligence do not shift in the predicted directions according to a woman's\novulation status or mate value.\nBefore discussing the potential implications of these results, several limitations of\nthe study should be noted. First, the sample consisted of already-married individuals. The\nresults should be replicated with different populations, particularly unmated individuals, to\nestablish their generalizability. Second, the sample contained participants from a single\nculture; cross-cultural replication is needed. Third, it remains to be established that\nattractive women's stronger mate preferences for these key qualities in fact result in\nsuccessfully securing mates possessing these qualities. There exists some evidence on this\nissue--women's physical attractiveness is the best known predictor of the occupational\nstatus of the man she marries and the best known predictor of hypergamy, or marrying up\nTo our knowledge, however, there exist no empirical studies that establish behavioral\nevidence that women high in mate value actually marry men who have hypothesized good-\ngenes indicators such as masculinity and sex appeal, hypothesized good parenting abilities,\nor hypothesized good partner qualities. Fourth, it must be acknowledged that women's\nphysical attractiveness is only one component, albeit an exceptionally important one, of\nwomen's overall mate value (Buss, 1994/2003). Fifth, future research might also add\npotential \"protection indicators\" to the suite of qualities that high mate value women\npotentially desire.\nWith these limitations in mind, what are the potential implications of these\nfindings? The most straightforward implication is that not all women must \"trade off\" when\nselecting a long-term mate. Women high in mate value need not sacrifice good genes in\norder to secure good investment ability or other indicators of direct benefits. Women high\nin mate value, as indicated by the fundamental trait of physical attractiveness, raise their\nstandards for all four clusters of indicators. Conversely, those women lower in mate value\nrelax their standards for all of the key clusters of mate traits. They relax the strength of\ntheir standards not just for hypothesized good-genes indicators, but also for indicators of\ninvestment ability, parenting, and partnering. Whereas high mate value women want it all,\nwomen lower in mate value adaptively reduce their standards. These individual differences\nsupport the hypothesis that women have an evolved self-assessment mechanism that\ncalibrates their standards to their mate value (see Buss and Schmitt, 1993, p. 230). This\ncalibration adaptation presumably allows women to target their mating efforts toward men\nwho are in the mate-value range that they can reasonably expect to attract and retain, and to\nselectively accept mating overtures from men within the mate value range they can attract\nand retain.\nThese findings raise a potential challenge to a strict version of the trade-off model\nproposed by Gangestad and Simpson (2000). In a world without constraints, a woman\nwould certainly obtain the best genes, the best investment, the best parent for her children,\nand the best partner. And as Gangestad and colleagues correctly argue, most women cannot\nget all these qualities from the same man (although the degree to which these qualities are\nintercorrelated, and were intercorrelated in ancestral environments, remains an open\nquestion). It does not necessarily follow, though, that the trade-off that women do make\nwill be obtaining the best possible investment from one man, while cuckolding him with a\nman with superior genes. Based on the extant studies of genetic cuckoldry, only a small\nAttractive women want it all\nminority of women actually sire children with men other than their regular mates--perhaps\n10 - 12% (see Baker and Bellis, 1995; Cerda-Flores, Barton, Marty-Gonzalez, Rivas, and\nChakraborty, 1999). Assuming that these figures approximate those of ancestral\nenvironments, this means that the majority of women, perhaps 88 - 90%, in fact obtain\ngenes, investment, parenting, and partnership from the same man.\nConsider a hypothetical numerical example in which the best genetic benefits\nequals a value of 5 and the best direct benefits (including investment, parenting, and\npartnership) equals a value of 5. A woman with a mate value of 10 is able to command it\nall--a perfect 5 on both clusters. Now consider women lower in mate value, say an 8. She\ncould go for a man who maximally provides direct benefits (5), but who has only a genetic\nquality of 3, while cuckolding him with a man who is a 5 on genetic quality (as the trade-\noff model predicts). Alternatively, she could lower her standards a bit on both, and obtain a\nman who is a 4 on genetic quality and a 4 on direct benefits. The same logic applies to\nwomen of lower mate value, although it is obvious that women of lower mate value, in\nprinciple, have more to gain by genetic cuckoldry than do women of higher mate value.\nAs Thornhill and Gangestad (in press) acknowledge, men's mate guarding\nadaptations, designed specifically to prevent cuckoldry, can function to prevent a woman\nfrom securing genes from a genetically superior man. And women who risk an EPC also\nrisk losing their partner's resources, risk spousal violence, risk damage to their social\nreputations, and risk abandonment as a consequence of infidelity (Buss, 2000; Daly and\nWilson, 1988). Combined with the finding that the vast majority of women do obtain both\ngenes and direct benefits from the same man, and only a minority of women obtain genes\nfrom one man and direct benefits from another, these facts suggest a modification of the\nmodel proposed by Gangestad and Thornhill--one that receives circumstantial support\nfrom the current empirical study.\nThe implications of this modification are threefold: (1) women high in mate value\ncan get it all from the same man, and in fact raise their standards for nearly all good genes\nindicators, good investment indicators, good parenting indicators, and good partner\nindicators; (2) most women cannot get it all, and so lower their standards across all four\nsets of indicators, since the odds are high that they will obtain both genetic and direct\nbenefits from the same man; these women secure the best combination of characteristics\nthey can obtain from the same man; (3) a minority of women, perhaps those in the low\nmate value range and who can manage successfully to escape the multiple costs inflicted by\nheavy mate guarding, a violently jealous mate, and the reputation damage caused by an\ninfidelity exposed, pursue a dual mating strategy in which they successfully obtain direct\nbenefits from one man while committing EPCs to obtain better genes from another man.\nFurther research is needed to identify the qualities that distinguish which women pursue the\nmixed mating strategy of investment/genes tradeoff as original version of the trade-off\nmodel predicts, which women will make other sorts of trade-offs (e.g., sacrificing good\nparenting indicators for good resource indicators), and which women try to get the best\ncombination of all four clusters of key qualities from the same man.\n"
