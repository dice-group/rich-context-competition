The synaptic count\nof the Sal+Iso group was significantly lower than the Control group (p < 0.05), suggesting that severe neurodegeneration\noccurred under the influence of fetal isoflurane exposure. In contrast, the synapse count of the Dex+Iso group was near\nto that of Control group. The rats are protected in neurodevelopmental, normal development.\nConclusion: Combine use of dexmedetomidine during exposure to isoflurane in utero during middle-pregnancy can\nattenuate the impairment of spatial learning and memory abilities for the rats in adulthood.\n",

As the brain is developing in such\na \"growth spurt\" phase, neurogenesis, neuronal migration,\nand corticogenesis are the major neurodevelopmental\nevents.2 Anesthetic agents administered can cause apoptosis-\nmediated neurodegeneration and synapse loss, whereas\nthey increase synaptogenesis later in neurodevelopment.3\u00ad5\nRecent studies based on rodents had demonstrated that\nmaternal anesthesia in the second trimester pregnancy for\nseveral hours can induce neurodegeneration of the fetal\nrats. In the second trimester of pregnancy, both the rodent\nand human fetus show similar neurodevelopmental pro-\nfiles.2,6 Therefore, more attention should be paid to the\nneurodevelopmental consequences of the fetus during\nmaternal anesthesia in this phase.\nIn experiments of fetal rodents, the neurotoxicity of iso-\nflurane is indicated in three ways. First, in results from\nimmunohistochemical tests, caspase-3 was raised signifi-\ncantly in the hippocampus after exposure several hours\nlater, which suggests that abnormal apoptosis occurred.\nSecond, in results from behavior tests, anxiety-related\nbehaviors were changed and spatial memory abilities were\ndecreased in adulthood. Third, as observed by transmis-\nsion electron microscopy, the number of synapses was\nreduced significantly in the hippocampus in adulthood.\nHowever, whether humans would undergo such changes is\nstill unclear.\nDexmedetomidine protects spatial\nlearning and memory ability in rats\nZhiyuan Su1,2, Shiyuan Xu1, Tao Chen2 and Junxing Chen2\n Keywords\nDexmedetomidine, memory, pregnancy, rat, spatial learning\nDepartment of Anesthesia, ZhuJiang Hospital of Southern Medical\nUniversity, China\nDepartment of Anesthesia, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou\nMedical University, China\nCorresponding author:\nShiyuan Xu, Department of Anesthesia, ZhuJiang Hospital of Southern\nOriginal Article\n996 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nThe neuroprotective function of dexmedetomidine\nhas been demonstrated in 5\u00ad7 days postnatal rats. But\nthere is still no evidence to show that dexmedetomidine\ncan attenuate the neurodegeneration induced by isoflu-\nrane. Accordingly, we hypothesized that combined use\nof dexmedetomidine in second-trimester-pregnancy\nexposure to isoflurane in maternal anesthesia may have\nadverse effects on the fetal brain that can attenuate the\nabnormal spatial learning and memory abilities in\nadulthood.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\nWith the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee\n(Guangdong Province), experiments were conducted on\n50 Sprague\u00adDawley female rats (Medical Laboratory\nAnimal Center of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou,\nChina) and their respective offspring. The dams, weigh-\ncm3 polypropylene cages and exposed to a 12-h light\u00ad\ndark cycle in a temperature- and humidity-regulated\nroom, fed with standard rat chow and water. Each dam\nstayed with a male adult rat for one night before preg-\nnancy, and pregnancy was assumed if sperm was found\non the vaginal smear at the next day morning. The preg-\nnant rats were fed under the same conditions solely till\ndelivery.\nProcedure for the dams\nassigned to five groups (n = 10), including Dex+Iso,\nSal+Iso, Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy, and control groups. For\ncm3 organic glass chamber to inhale gas. The animals\nrandomly assigned to Dex+Iso and Sal+Iso groups\nwhereas animals in Sal+Oxy and Dex+Oxy groups\nreceived 100% oxygen for 4 h in identical anesthetizing\nchambers. The animals breathed spontaneously and the\nisoflurane concentration was measured continuously\nwith an agent analyzer (Datex-Ohmeda, S/5 Compact\nAnesthesia Monitor). This concentration of isoflurane\nwas referenced from the study by Arvind et al.7 which\nreported that 1.4% isoflurane can cause significant spa-\ntial memory impairment. Simultaneously, this concen-\ntration approximates one minimum alveolar\nconcentration in the pregnant rodent.8 The control group\ninhaled only normal air for 4 h.\nFor drugs injection, the animals randomly assigned to\nthe Dex+Iso and Dex+Oxy groups received dexmedetomi-\ndine 10 g/kg (2 g/ml) by intramuscular injection at two\ntime points, including 15 min before inhalation and 2 h\nafter the start of inhalation. Animals in the Sal+Iso,\nSal+Oxy, and control groups received two doses of saline\nat the same time points. The dose of dexmedetomidine was\nreferenced from the report by Sanders et al.9 which con-\ncluded that dexmedetomidine 10 g/kg and 25 g/kg gave\nsignificant neuroprotective effects while 1 g/kg has\nalmost no effect. In our pre-experiment, we initially set\ntwo doses of dexmedetomidine. But during the procedure,\nwe found that dexmedetomidine 25 g/kg may induce\nsevere hypotension at subsequent isoflurane inhalation;\nthis consequence may lead to hypoxia of the fetal rat brains\nand then affect the accuracy of our experiment. Although\n1-adrenoceptor agonists such as phenylephrine can revert\nthe blood pressure, this may counterbalance the effect of\nthe 2-adrenoceptor agonist.10 and thus interfere the neu-\nroprotective effect of dexmedetomidine. For this reason,\nwe only used a dose of 10 g/kg for dexmedetomidine in\nour experiment.\nAfter gas inhalation, the dams recovered in 100% oxy-\ngen till the return of the righting reflex, and returned to\ntheir cages. We injected the first dose of dexmedetomi-\ndine 15 min before gas inhalation. This setting was cho-\nsen by considering that the target organs of the drugs\nwere the brains of fetal rats. Because the lipid solubility\nof dexmedetomidine is lower than isoflurane, it needs\nmore duration to pass the placental barrier and to onset at\nthe fetal brains. If both dexmedetomidine and isoflurane\nare received simultaneously, neuroimpairment induced\nby isoflurane may occur before neuroprotection by dex-\nmedetomidine. We expected that advanced injection of\ndexmedetomidine can produce enough neuroprotective\neffect before the impairment. In addition, we found that\nthe onset time of dexmedetomidine by intramuscular\ninjection may be more rapid than by intraperitoneal injec-\ntion from the animal's behavioral response, and we con-\njectured that the onset time of neuroprotective effect may\nbe shorter if dexmedetomidine was administered by\nintramuscular injection.\nFurthermore, in our pre-experiment, 10 dams on E14\nhad a needle inserted through the arteria cruralis after\nchloral hydrate intraperitoneal injection. Each of these\ndams received all four methods above. Through the\nneedles, we monitored the continual arterial blood\npressures and took the blood samples for blood gas\nanalysis during the whole procedures. The result of\npre-experiment suggested that the dams can tolerate all\nthe methods well. No significant hypotension or heart\nrate decrease occurred. Also, the blood gas analysis\nresults suggested no hypoxemia or hypoglycemia.\nConsidering the resistances of the rats without anesthe-\nsia when faced with invasive procedures, and the inter-\nference if we used other anesthetics such as chloral\nhydrate before the experiment, we did not monitor the\nblood pressure and blood gas analysis directly during\nour experiment.\nBehavioral test\nAfter delivery, each offspring was group-housed with the\ncorresponding dam until postnatal day 21, when pups were\nweaned. One male and one female offspring of each dam\nwere used for the Morris water maze (MWM) test. All test-\ning sessions were performed between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. in\nthe same room, homogenously illuminated by normal fluo-\nrescent room light at 50 lux. Animals were singly housed\ntill the end of behavioral test.\nThe MWM test was conducted in a pool with black\ninternal coating (120 cm diameter, 60 cm altitude) filled\nwith water (25\u00b0C). Animal movement was tracked using\nviewer software (Smart 2.5) by a camera placed 2.5 m\nabove. The spatial cues were present around the pool, and\nthe pool was divided into four quadrants (northwest, north-\neast, southeast, southwest). The test was divided into two\nparts. For the spatial learning part, an escape platform (10\ncm diameter) was placed in the second quadrant (2 cm\nsubmerged; 30 cm from edge). Animals were trained to\nfind the location of the platform in four acquisition trials\n(maximal swimming time 120 s; 30 s on the platform;\ninter-trial interval 60 min) per day during four consecutive\ndays. If the rats could not find the platform in 120 s, they\nwere directed to the platform with a short stick. Starting\npositions during the four trails day were: SE, SW, NW, and\nNE. The latency time(s) to find the hidden platform from\nthe SE start position was scored. Latency time(s) repre-\nsents the spatial learning ability. After the 120 s swim the\nanimals were placed back in their home cage, and a towel\nwas available inside the cage for additional drying. For the\nspatial memory part, all animals performed a single probe\ntrial starting from the SE start position at day 5, in which\nthe platform was removed from the swimming pool.\nAnimals were also allowed to swim for 120 s. The time(s)\nof first platform crossing (at the former platform location)\nand the frequency of platform crossing were recorded.\nFirst platform crossing time(s) and frequency of platform\ncrossing represent the spatial memory ability.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nHippocampal tissue were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde\nfor 1 h, treated with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated\nand embedded in Durcupan (Sigma-Aldrich).

In all\nexperiments, differences were considered statistically\nResults\nMorris water maze test\nThe latency time(s) from day 1 to day 4 all revealed a\ndecreasing tendency in all four groups. However, in day 3,\nthe data in the Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy, and control group were\nsimilar and all lower than the Sal+Iso group, while the data\nfor the Dex+Iso group did not show significant difference\nto that for the Sal+Iso group or control group. In day 4, the\ndata in the Dex+Iso, Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy, and control\ngroups have no significant difference, but were all signifi-\ncantly different to the Sal+Iso group.

As shown in Table 3, we found that the synaptic\nTable 1.

In contrast, the synapse count of the Dex+Iso\ngroup was nearly that of the control group, although there\nwere significant differences (p < 0.05). Thus, the rats were\nprotected in neurodevelopmental, normal development.\nDiscussion\nRecently, growing evidence has shown that general anes-\nthetics may be harmful at various stages of neurodevelop-\nment.11\u00ad13 The neurodegeneration induced by exposure to\nisoflurane had both \"short-term\" and \"long-term\" influ-\nences. Wang et al. found that caspase-3 densities signifi-\ncantly increased both in the hippocampal CA1 region and\nretrosplenial cortex.14 Arvind et al. found that rats exposed\nto isoflurane in utero may have impaired spatial memory\nacquisition and reduced anxiety.7 Because E14\u00ad16 fetal\nrats show similar neurodevelopmental profiles to human in\nthe second trimester of pregnancy,6,15 the period when\nmost non-obstetric surgery and fetal interventions are per-\nformed, this sparked concerns for anesthesia safety.\nTherefore, we expect to find a way to abate this damage.\nDexmedetomidine has been shown to exert potent neu-\nroprotective effects by different mechanisms. First, dex-\nmedetomidine can attenuate the consecutively triggered\nexcitotoxicity by glutamate via the 2A-adrenoceptor\nsubtype in a model of neonatal excitotoxic rat brain dam-\nage.16 Second, dexmedetomidine can reduce the abnormal\nincrease of caspase-3 density induced by isoflurane in the\ndeveloping brain.9 Third, dexmedetomidine increased\nastrocyte expression of BDNF through an extracellular\nsignal-regulated kinase-dependent pathway and induced\nsubsequent neuroprotective effects.17 However, all these\nevidences were based on experiments on neonatal rats; the\nevidences on fetal rats had still not been reported.\nWe evaluated whether dexmedetomidine has certainly\nneuroprotective effects by behavior tests, mainly because\nwe have no evidence yet available. Behavior is the most\nimportant function of the body and is controlled by the\nnervous system. The behavior of the experimental animals\nwould change subsequently with the environmental change,\nand it can reflect the adapting ability and the neural func-\ntion sensitively. Learning and memory are the inner psy-\nchological behaviors of both humans and animals. These\nprocesses occur in the brain and can only be speculated\nindirectly by the determination of their operating results or\nreaction time after learning or performing a task interval a\nperiod. In our study, the MWM test was employed to evalu-\nate the spatial learning and memory abilities.\nAlthough the use of isoflurane in human medicine is\nnow on the decline and replaced by sevoflurane, or desflu-\nrane gradually, a certain proportion of using as an inhala-\ntion anesthetic agent still exists for its uterus relaxation\neffects. Furthermore, the neurodegeneration effects on\nfetal animals induced by isoflurane have been widely\nreported, while few are reported for sevoflurane or desflu-\nrane. However, we needed an unquestionable neurodegen-\neration animal model to evaluate the protecting effect of\ndexmedetomidine. So we still chose isoflurane as the\ninhaling anesthetic agent.\nFrom our MWM results, we find that the rats in all\ngroups show approximate spatial learning abilities\naccording to the similar data of the latency time(s) in the\nfirst two days. But in day 3 and day 4, the latency time(s)\nof the rats in Sal+Iso group were significant longer than\nthe Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy and control groups.\nSimultaneously, the time(s) of first platform crossing and\nthe frequency of platform crossing were significantly dif-\nferent compared with these three groups. This suggests\nthat the spatial learning and memory abilities decreased\nin the Sal+Iso group, and that serious neurodegeneration\nhad occurred in these rats. This result was consistent with\nthe conclusion made by Arvind et al.7 From the data for\nthe Dex+Iso group, although the latency time(s) in day 3\nwere between those of the Sal+Iso and control groups\nand did not show any significant difference, the data in\nday 4 and day 5 were similar to the control group and\nsignificantly different to that for the Sal+Iso group. This\nsuggests that the impairment of spatial learning and\nmemory abilities induced by isoflurane had been attenu-\nated, even though the effect may not be thorough.\nHowever, because we did not perform any biochemical or\nanatomical tests, the way in which neurodegeneration\nTable 2.

We\nfound that the synaptic count of Sal+Iso group rats was\nsignificantly lower than for the control group, suggesting\nthat severe neurodegeneration occurred under the influ-\nence of fetal isoflurane exposure. In contrast, the synapse\ncount of the Dex+Iso group was nearly that of the control\ngroup, although there were significant differences (p <\n0.05). Thus, the rats are protected in neurodevelopmental,\nnormal development.\nOxygen has also been reported for neurotoxicity.18\nBut we had to use oxygen for it is the only driven air\nsource of our animal anesthesia machine. Similarly, a\ngreat number of human anesthesia machines only use\noxygen and it is common practice to use 100% oxygen\nduring maternal anesthesia in humans. Further, the fetal\nbrain was probably not exposed to a high oxygen con-\ncentration because of the arterial\u00advenous admixture in\nthe placenta. But we still set a group for only inhaling\noxygen, in order to rule out this interference in our\nexperiment. From the result, oxygen exposure in utero\ndid not lead to any significantly change of the behavior\nof the rats in adulthood.\nThe safety of using dexmedetomidine in the second tri-\nmester of pregnancy has been reported as being doubled in\nsome articles. The usage guide of the US Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) suggests that administering dexme-\ndetomidine subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 and 32 /\nkg (representing a dose less than the maximum recom-\nmended human intravenous dose based on a body surface\narea comparison) from gestation day 16 through weaning,\nlower offspring weights were observed. Also \u00d6cal et al.\nfound that dexmedetomidine might increase the spontane-\nous uterine contraction-forces and contraction-frequencies\nin early- and middle-pregnancy term rats in vitro (in Krebs\nand Ca2+-free solutions), and consequently increase the risk\nof miscarriage.19 However, Tariq et al. found that a single\nacute dose of dexmedetomidine (20 g/kg) administered at\nthe anticipated delivery time does not exert any adverse\neffects on perinatal morphology of pups,20 including their\nbirth weight, crown\u00adrump length, physical growth, and\npostnatal behavioral performances. Podocyte injury has\nalso been studied.21,22 However, in our experiment, none of\nthe dams suffered a miscarriage. Simultaneously, exposure\nto a single dose of dexmedetomidine with oxygen did not\nlead to any behavior abnormally in our results. So we\ndeduced that dexmedetomidine 10 g/kg is still a safe dose\nfor the pregnant and the fetal animals in the second trimes-\nter of pregnancy in vivo.\nRecently, there have been a numbers of studies based\non neonatal rats that focus on how to attenuate the neuro-\nimpairment induced by anesthetic agents in the developing\nbrain. Liu et al. found that concurrent surgery and proce-\ndural pain could attenuate ketamine-induced neuroapopto-\nsis.23 Xenon could prevent isoflurane-induced neonatal\nneuronal apoptosis.24 Unfortunately, the offspring in utero\nmay not all receive noxious stimulation and use of xenon\nis limited by the special equipment and source required, so\nthat promotion of these conclusions is limited. By contrast,\ndexmedetomidine is both conveniently and widely availa-\nble. Furthermore, the significant effect at attenuating the\nimpairments of spatial learning and memory ability is\nworth a more thorough study. In our experiment, we were\nlimited at the behavior test and lacked the ability to explore\nthe mechanism. We expect that the mechanism of the neu-\nroprotection by dexmedetomidine for fetal rats can be\nstudied subsequently.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
