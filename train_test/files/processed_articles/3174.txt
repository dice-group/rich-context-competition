Finally, we analyze the long-run consequences of reacting to asset price\nmovements and examine the effects of different exit strategies. We find that the central bank\ncan stabilize all variables at the cost of higher inflation and that macroeconomic volatility\nis smallest if the central bank communicates the exit date in advance and credibly commits\nto it.\n",

Central\nbanks do no longer rely exclusively on traditional interest rate policy but also prolong the ma-\nturities of repurchase agreements (\"Repo\"), widen the set of collateral accepted in Repo trans-\nactions, and reduce the haircut applied to specific types of assets. Those measures can be sub-\nsumed under the heading of unconventional monetary policy measures. To enable economists\nto analyze the macroeconomic consequences of a central bank resorting to a richer set of mon-\netary policy tools that are targeted to change the liquidity situation among banks, requires to\nimplement an interbank market in modern macroeconomic models. In recent times a couple\nof DSGE models emerged which explicitly incorporate an active banking sector (Gerali, Neri,\nIn this paper we set up a New-Keynesian model that features a heterogenous financial sector that\nconsists of two different types of banks: a borrowing bank and a lending bank which interact\non an interbank market. Whereas the interbank borrowing bank invests its funds together with\ninterbank loans in a loan to a firm, the interbank lending bank invests in a riskless asset which\nit can exchange against liquidity in repurchase agreements with the central bank. Moreover,\nwe introduce a borrowing constraint in a borrower-lender relationship as in Iacoviello (2005)\nand more recently in Gerali et al. (2010) by assuming that the interbank borrowing bank's abil-\nity to obtain liquidity on the interbank market is limited by the asset portfolio she can offer\nas collateral. Furthermore, to account for the recently observed enhancement of the monetary\npolicy toolkit we introduce an additional instrument, namely, the size of the haircut applied to\nsecurities which the central bank accepts as collateral in repurchase agreements with interbank\nlending banks. In addition, we follow Bernanke and Gertler (1999) and distinguish between the\nfundamental price of capital, Q, equivalent to Tobin (1969)'s q and the market price of capi-\ntal, S. The latter enters the borrowing constraint and influences the interbank lending volume.\nGiven an exogenous shock to the market price of capital, the model is used to analyze the effec-\ntiveness of both conventional and unconventional monetary policy instruments in affecting the\nbusiness cycle.\nWe can show that in our model the effect of a shock to the conventional monetary policy instru-\nment on the real economy is dampened by the presence of an interbank market. Similarly, we\nshow that the same market amplifies an exogenous shock to asset prices. Moreover, the haircut\ninstrument has a positive effect on the level of interbank lending activity whose increase has the\npotential to stimulate the economy. However, this comes at the risk of increased inflation in the\nfirst periods after a negative shock to haircuts.\nGiven that our model contains an interbank market we argue that central banks should react\nto asset price movements. Our results support a central bank which resorts to the haircut in-\nstrument and not to an interest rate instrument if an asset price shock happens. In terms of a\nstabilization policy our results show that for a given magnitude of an asset price shock a haircut\npolicy is able to reduce the macroeconomic volatility substantially.\nHowever, given that a central bank decides to implement a haircut policy it has to think about\nthe exit from such an unconventional monetary policy tool if inflationary pressures become too\nhigh. In line with the monetary policy literature the model implies that a central bank should\nprefer to communicate the exit date in advance and then credibly stick to it to ensure a smooth\nevolution of macroeconomic aggregates resulting from the agents' expectations formation. In\ncase it decides not to define an exit from such a policy, the volatility of key macroeconomic\nvariables is low at the cost of higher inflation in the long-run as liquidity provided by the central\nbank to the interbank market is growing over time.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nSeit Beginn der aktuellen Finanzkrise hat sich die Geldpolitik grundlegend gewandelt, da sich\nZentralbanken nicht l\u00e4nger ausschlie\u00dflich auf die traditionelle Zinspolitik beschr\u00e4nken, um ihre\ngeldpolitischen Ziele zu erreichen. Deshalb verl\u00e4ngerten sie die Laufzeiten der Offenmarktge-\nsch\u00e4fte (\"Repos\"), erweiterten den Kreis der zugelassenen Sicherheiten f\u00fcr diese Transaktionen\nund reduzierten auch die Abschl\u00e4ge (\"Haircuts\") f\u00fcr ausgew\u00e4hlte Wertpapierklassen in Repo-\nGesch\u00e4ften. Diese Ma\u00dfnahmen kann man unter dem Oberbegriff der unkonventionellen Geld-\npolitik zusammenfassen. Damit Volkswirte in der Lage sind, die makro\u00f6konomischen Folgen\nzu beurteilen, die ein Zur\u00fcckgreifen der Zentralbank auf dieses erweiterte Instrumentarium hat,\nist es notwendig, einen Interbankenmarkt in moderne makro\u00f6konomische Modelle zu integrie-\nren. In letzter Zeit wurden einige DSGE-Modelle entwickelt (siehe z.B. Gerali et al. (2010),\ndeWalque et al. (2010), Dib (2009)), in welche explizit ein solcher Interbankenmarkt integriert\nworden ist.\nIn diesem Papier stellen wir ein Neu-Keyensianisches Modell mit einem heterogenen Finanz-\nsektor auf, der aus zwei verschiedenen Arten von Banken besteht. W\u00e4hrend die eine Bank Li-\nquidit\u00e4t nachfragt, bietet die andere \u00fcbersch\u00fcssige Liquidit\u00e4t auf dem Interbankenmarkt an.\nErstere verwendet die Depositen von Haushalten zusammen mit Interbankkrediten daf\u00fcr, Kre-\ndite an Firmen zu vergeben. Die zweite Bank investiert ihre Mittel in risikolose Anlagen, deren\nAngebot exogen gegeben ist und welche im Rahmen von Repo-Gesch\u00e4ften gegen Zentralbank-\nliquidit\u00e4t eingetauscht werden k\u00f6nnen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus enth\u00e4lt unser Modell eine Friktion wo-\ndurch die H\u00f6he des Kreditvolumens zwischen den beiden Banken davon abh\u00e4ngt, \u00fcber welche\nSicherheiten der Kreditnehmer verf\u00fcgt (siehe Iacoviello (2005) oder Gerali et al. (2010)) und\nwelcher Wert f\u00fcr die Sicherheiten in der n\u00e4chsten Periode erwartet wird. Das Instrumentarium\nder Zentralbank erweitern wir, indem wir eine \"Haircut-Regel\" einf\u00fchren, welche angewendet\nwird, um den Gegenwert der Sicherheiten f\u00fcr die kreditgebende Bank in Offenmarktgesch\u00e4ften\nfestzulegen. Desweiteren folgen wir Bernanke and Gertler (1999) und unterscheiden zwischen\ndem Fundamentalpreis f\u00fcr Kapital, Q, welcher Tobin (1969)'s q entspricht, und dem Markt-\npreis f\u00fcr Kapital S. Letzterer spielt im Rahmen der oben genannten Friktion eine Rolle und\nhat Einfluss auf die H\u00f6he des Kreditvolumens auf dem Interbankenmarkt. Wir analysieren die\nEffektivit\u00e4t von konventioneller und unkonventioneller Geldpolitik auf den Konjunkturzyklus\nbei einem exogenen Schock auf den Marktpreis f\u00fcr Kapital.\nWir k\u00f6nnen mit unserem Modell einerseits die Ergebnisse anderer Studien best\u00e4tigen, dass ein\nheterogener Bankensektor dazu f\u00fchrt, dass die Wirkung eines geldpolitischen Schocks auf den\nrealen Sektor durch den Interbankenmarkt reduziert wird. Andererseits k\u00f6nnen wir zeigen, dass\nim Falle von Verm\u00f6genspreis\u00fcbertreibungen das Vorhandensein eines Finanzsektors den Effekt\nauf die Realwirtschaft im Vergleich zu einer Modellierung ohne einen solchen Sektor sogar\nerh\u00f6ht. Hinsichtlich der Effektivit\u00e4t des Haircut-Instruments stellen wir fest, dass eine Sen-\nkung des Abschlags auf Wertpapiere in Repo-Gesch\u00e4ften sowohl einen positiven Effekt auf das\nKreditvolumen auf dem Interbankenmarkt hat als auch in der Lage ist die Realwirtschaft zu\nstimulieren. Allerdings geht dieses zu Lasten h\u00f6herer Inflation.\nNach unserem Modell ist es m\u00f6glich, die Auswirkungen einer Verm\u00f6genspreis\u00e4nderung auf die\nVolatilit\u00e4t makro\u00f6konomischer Variablen deutlich zu verringern, wenn die Notenbank in sol-\nchen F\u00e4llen den Haircut ver\u00e4ndert, statt einer dementsprechend die Zinsen anzupassen.\nSofern sich eine Zentralbank entscheidet, das Haircut-Instrument einzusetzen, sollte sie sich\nauch damit auseinandersetzen, wie sie dessen Einsatz wieder beenden kann. Das gilt insbe-\nsondere im Hinblick auf damit verbundene steigende Inflationsrisiken. Die Antwort unseres\nModells auf diese Frage ist, dass im Hinblick auf die Volatilit\u00e4t sowohl realwirtschaftlicher\nals auch finanzmarktbezogener Variablen eine Strategie zu bevorzugen ist, welche explizit ein\nAusstiegsdatum f\u00fcr die Beendigung einer solchen Ma\u00dfnahme nennt und an diesem festh\u00e4lt.\nDadurch wird mittels der Erwartungsbildung der Agenten eine gleichm\u00e4\u00dfige Entwicklung der\nmakro\u00f6konomischen Variablen unterst\u00fctzt. Falls die Zentralbank die Entscheidung f\u00e4llt, das\nHaircut-Instrument auf unbestimmte Zeit anzuwenden, f\u00fchrt dieses zwar zu einer anhaltend\nniedrigen Volatilit\u00e4t der makro\u00f6konomischen Variablen jedoch auf Kosten von h\u00f6herer Infla-\ntion in der Zukunft, da die Liquidit\u00e4t, welche dem Interbankenmarkt durch die Zentralbank\nzugeteilt wird, w\u00e4chst.\nAsset Prices, Collateral, and Unconventional\nMonetary Policy in a DSGE Model\nBj\u00f6rn Hilberg\nDeutsche Bundesbank\nJosef Hollmayr\nDeutsche Bundesbank\n Keywords: New-Keynesian Model, Monetary Policy, Business Cycle, Collateral, Haircuts\n4960 .

The twenty years of quietness before the Great Recession are by\nand large attributable to good policy but according to some studies (see for example the studies\nPrimiceri (2005) and Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2010)) also to good luck. Once this\nsteady macro environment changed with the onset of the crisis, central banks were required to\nchange their conduct of monetary policy as well. For example, they no longer relied exclusively\non traditional interest rate policy but also prolonged the maturities of repurchase agreements\n(\"Repo\"), widened the set of collateral accepted in Repo transactions, and reduced the haircut\napplied to specific types of assets. Those measures can be subsumed under the heading of un-\nconventional monetary policy. So far these measures have been confined to crisis times and\nwere aimed at reviving the interbank market and stabilizing the financial systems as a whole.\nIf, however, the period of good luck is over and the economy is experiencing higher macroeco-\nnomic volatility, unconventional measures might remain in place longer than initially intended.\nTherefore it is important to discuss and analyse those additional instruments with their costs\nand benefits.\nThe interbank market is important for a central bank because it is the market which is most\ndirectly affected by monetary policy decisions and hence is the preferred channel to implement\nthe monetary policy strategy of a central bank. To enable economists to analyze the macroeco-\nnomic consequences of a central bank resorting to a richer set of monetary policy tools that are\ntargeted to change the liquidity situation among banks requires to implement an interbank mar-\nket in modern macroeconomic models. In models of Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999)\nor Markovic (2006) banks are financial intermediaries who channel funds from borrowers to\nlenders. Although they assume profit maximizing behavior, banks in these models are assumed\nto break-even each period. Only in recent times a couple of DSGE models emerged which ex-\nplicitly incorporate an active banking sector (Gerali et al. (2010), deWalque et al. (2010), Dib\nOur model features a heterogenous financial sector that consists of two different types of banks\nwhose behavior is the outcome of explicit optimization problems. Both types of banks accept\ndeposits from the household sector but their investment decisions are different. Whereas one\ngrants loans to firms the other invests its funds completely in safe assets which are eligible as\ncollateral at the central bank. In addition, the first bank with its risky exposure needs inter-\nbank funding from the other bank to be secured by collateral stemming from its loan business\nto the firm sector. The way the interbank market is modeled in our setup is different from the\nliterature. Dib (2009) for example splits up the responsibilities of a bank by assuming two\n1The term `Great Moderation' goes back to a paper by Stock and Watson (2003) to describe the decline in the\noutput volatility in the United States since the early 1980s.\nseparate entities: a savings and a lending bank. In our model each commercial bank borrows\nand lends. While both borrow from the household sector, one type of commercial bank lends\nto the firm sector while the other type lends to banks on the interbank market. While Gerali\net al. (2010) claim to model an interbank market, in their model in equilibrium no interaction\namong wholesale banks takes place. Other studies that examine interbank liquidity flows are,\nfor example Eisenschmidt and Tapking (2009), Allen, Carletti, and Gale (2009) and Freixas\nand Jorge (2008), however, these do not incorporate their microeconomic model into a DSGE\nframework.\nBy assumption an interbank borrowing bank can only offer risky assets as collateral in return\nfor interbank liquidity. The volume of interbank lending depends on the expected value of the\ncollateral in the next period. If the value of the underlying collateral is expected to rise an in-\nterbank lending bank accepts the risky asset as collateral for an interbank loan independent of\nthe collateral policy of the central bank. However, if the collateral value is expected to decline\nand the central bank is unwilling to accept this risky asset as eligible asset in a main refinancing\noperation, the volume of interbank lending will decline. Hence, within this model the central\nbank faces a situation where the decline in interbank lending activity is not caused by concerns\nabout direct counterparty risk but due to concerns about the value of the collateral pledged by a\ncommercial bank in return for an interbank loan.\nOnly recently Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) incorporate uncon-\nventional monetary policy into a DSGE model to assess the effects of these policies on the\nmacroeconomy.2 We allow for unconventional monetary policy in our model by introducing a\nhaircut rule in addition to the interest rate rule to analyze the role of collateral in repurchase\nagreements with the central bank. To differentiate between different qualities of collateral the\ncentral bank is able to apply different haircuts to the securities within the set of eligible collat-\neral. Recent papers which incorporate a haircut into their models are Ashcraft, G\u00e2rleanu, and\n(2011), and Schabert (2010). Within our framework we analyze the impact of such a haircut\npolicy on the lending activity on the interbank market. Because a central bank can vary the\nhaircut on certain asset classes in our model, it is in the position to increase or decrease the\nliquidity supply to the banking sector even if the interest rate is at or near the zero lower bound.\nThis policy constitutes an alternative to direct liquidity provision to commercial banks and has\nthe advantage of not completely crowding out the lending activity on the interbank market.\nAnother feature that distinguishes our study from other studies mentioned above is the distinc-\ntion between the fundamental price of capital which is equivalent to Tobin (1969)'s q and the\nmarket price of capital. The latter is used to determine the value of the collateral a borrowing\nbank can offer to an interbank lending bank in return for an interbank loan or to a central bank\nas eligible collateral in repurchase agreements. If one value deviates from the other perma-\nnently we refer to it as a bubble (or bust) process. The effect of such a bubble is an increase\nin the amount of collateral available for borrowing in the interbank market. To model these\ntwo variables we rely on the setup introduced by Bernanke and Gertler (1999) who extend the\nframework of Bernanke et al. (1999). By including an exogenous bubble process we try to\ncontribute to the ongoing debate in the literature whether central banks should respond to asset\nprices as well.\nOur results confirm the results of other studies with an interbank market that a financial sector\n2A study of unconventional monetary policy which also places a big emphasis on the central bank's balance\nsheet has recently been conducted by C\u00fardia and Woodford (2011).\nhelps to dampen monetary policy shocks to the real economy. In addition, we illustrate that if\nbubbles inflate the prices used to determine the value of the collateral the presence of a financial\nsector amplifies shocks to the real economy. Moreover, by lowering the haircut, or equivalently\nby enlarging the set of admissible collateral, the central bank has a significant and positive im-\npact on the whole economy in the short run. The only drawback is an increase in inflation after\nthe liquidity supply in the interbank market has increased.\nIn addition, we shed new light on the argument of financial stability and the question if central\nbanks should target asset prices. Knowing that this is primarily a political decision we follow\na purely economic line of argument and deem it appropriate to follow a \"leaning-against-the-\nwind\"-policy. Given that a change in market prices increases the volatility of the economy in\nour model we find that both the interest rate rule as well as the collateral policy can be used to\ndampen a boom-bust cycle. According to our metric, however, the haircut rule is more appro-\npriate for this task.\nWithin the same setup we are enable to analyze the long run effects of \"leaning-against-the-\nwind\"-policy and contribute to the ongoing research on the exit strategy of a central bank en-\ngaged in unconventional monetary policy. Conditional on a reduction of the haircut on eligible\ncollateral in Repo transactions we simulate the long run effects of such unconventional mone-\ntary policy on the economy and give recommendations about the preferable strategy based on\nthe variances of output, inflation and financial market variables computed across different exit\nscenarios. Based on this metric our model recommends to communicate the exit date in ad-\nvance and stick to the announced exit date. If the central bank sticks to its asset price targeting\npolicy, all variables can be stabilized with the important exception of inflation which is positive\nthroughout. This is due to the fact that keeping the haircut low for a prolonged period of time,\nthe amount of liquidity provided to the interbank market is rising over time.\nThis paper is structured in the following way. In Section 2 the model setup is explained. The\ncalibration to the data is shown in Section 3. We proceed in Section 4 by stating important\nresults such as impulse response functions, comparative statics and the long run effects of asset\nprice targeting. Section 5 finally concludes.\nThe model economy consists of three major blocks: the real sector, the financial sector, and the\ncentral bank. A figure that explains the sectors and their interactions can be found in Appendix\nA. The real sector comprises the household sector and the production sector and is very similar\nto Bernanke et al. (1999) and Christensen and Dib (2008). Each household consumes a final\ngood sold by the retailer and supplies labor to entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs combine household\nlabor with capital bought from capital good producers to produce an intermediate good which\nis sold to retailers. To transfer wealth across periods, households can save by holding deposits\nat both types of banks. The interbank borrowing bank uses these deposits together with in-\nterbank liquidity obtained from the interbank lending bank to grant loans to entrepreneurs. In\nthe relationship between the commercial bank and the entrepreneur a demand side friction is\nincorporated, which results in an external finance premium that depends on the net worth an\nentrepreneur has accumulated.\nThe financial sector consists of two different types of banks where both types of banks accept\ndeposits from the household sector but their investment decisions are different. Whereas one\ngrants loans to firms the other invests its funds completely in safe assets which are eligible as\ncollateral at the central bank. In addition, the first bank with its risky exposure needs interbank\nfunding from the other bank to be secured by collateral stemming from its loan business to the\nfirm sector. It is assumed that commercial banks are heterogenous with respect to their balance\nsheet structure. One type of commercial bank has highly liquid assets on its balance sheet while\nthe balance sheet of the other type of commercial bank contains less liquid, risky assets. In case\nthe latter bank has a liquidity need it prefers to demand additional liquidity from the interbank\nmarket. In return it offers the illiquid, risky asset as collateral to avoid having to forgo profitable\ninvestment opportunities. In the following we will refer to the former group as interbank lend-\ning banks and to the latter group as interbank borrowing banks. The interbank lending volume\ndepends crucially on both the expected value of the collateral as well as the haircut applied to\nthe collateral in Repo transactions with the central bank.\nIn the following subsections the model setup and the optimization problems faced by each agent\nare explained. For the model's first order conditions we refer the reader to Appendix B.1.\nHouseholds are infinitely lived and maximize consumption and leisure subject to a budget con-\nstraint. Throughout the model h is attached to variables and parameters to denote an individual\nhousehold quantity. The instantaneous utility function has the following form\nUt\n=\nCt\n+\nThe infinite sum of discounted utility is maximized by the household under the following budget\nconstraint which is expressed in real terms\nCt\n(h) + Dt\n(h) = Wt\nLt\n(h) +\nRD\nt\n(h) + Pt\n(h) - Tt\nThe household's savings are transferred across periods by depositing it with commercial banks.\nThe gross return paid on household's deposits is denoted by RD\nt\n. Wt\nis the wage in real terms\nthat the household gets from the entrepreneur in exchange for its labor supply Lt\n(h). Finally,\nPt\n(h) denotes transfer payments stemming from profits made by commercial banks, the central\nbank and retailers. Tt\n(h) are the lump sum taxes that the government collects from household\nh. Dt\n(h) refers to real deposits.\nThe entrepreneur is perfectly competitive and produces output that is sold to retailers. As input\nfactors in production they use homogenous labor (Lt\n) supplied from households and capital\n(Kt\n) purchased from capital producers. The production function is assumed to be of the Cobb-\nDouglas type\nYt\n= At\nK\nt\nt\nTechnology which is denoted by At\nfollows an AR(1) process.\nEach period the entrepreneur purchases capital Kt+1\nto be used in production at the beginning\nof the next period.

(1999) show that an external finance premium results from the financial contract\nsigned between a bank and the firm. Dib (2009) implemented this financial contract in a model\nwith a banking sector. The expected external marginal financing costs are defined as a mark up\nover the lending rate. The size of the markup depends on the ratio of the market value of capital\nSt\nover the net worth Nt\nand is given by the following function\nEt\nRS\n=\nRB\nt\nSt\nNt\n\nThe external finance premium (St\n/Nt\n) depends on the entrepreneur's leverage ratio which\nis defined as St\n/Nt\n. If the leverage ratio increases, the entrepreneur increasingly relies on\ndebt financing which increases its probability of default.4 The aggregate net worth position of\nentrepreneurs is evolving as\nNt\n=  RS\nt\nKt\n- Rt\n+\n\u00b5 dF()RS\nt\nKt\nKt\n- Nt\nKt\n- Nt\n)\nK\nt\nt\nwith  and  being the survival probability of the entrepreneur and the default probability\nof the project the entrepreneur invests in, respectively. Moreover, 1 -  denotes the share\nof entrepreneurial labor CEt\nin the amount of total labor Ht\nand \u00b5 is the parameter of the\nsupervising costs of the bank.\nNote that the loan contract between the entrepreneur and the commercial bank is conditioned on\nthe market price of capital St\nand not on the fundamental price Qt\n. The distinction between the\nmarket price St\nand the fundamental price Qt\nhas been proposed by Bernanke and Gertler (1999)\nin an extension of the model by Bernanke et al. (1999) 5 and allows to model exogenous asset\nprice bubbles.6Rt\nis the short rate that is set by the central whose behavior will be explained in\nIf a unit of capital is valued at the fundamental price Qt\n, optimal demand for capital guarantees\nthat the marginal external financing costs equal the marginal return on capital\nRQ\nt\n=\nRk\nt\n+ (1 - )Qt\n3Q denotes the ratio of the market value of the capital stock relative to the replacement cost of capital. In\nequilibrium the adjustment costs are equal to one. In the absence of adjustment costs, the entrepreneur is able to\nadjust its capital stock instantaneously, However, this behavior is not in line with empirical observations which\nrather point towards a sluggish behavior of investment. That is, adjustment in the level of capital takes place over\nseveral periods. For that reason adjustment costs at the level of the capital producer are introduced (see Section\n2.3). As a result Q will not be equal to one during periods where the level of the capital stock is not equal to its\nequilibrium value\n4The size of the elasticity parameter  that has originally been calibrated by Bernanke et al.

It holds that St\n= Qt\nut\n6For an introduction on asset price bubbles we refer to the seminal paper by Blanchard and Watson (1982).\nAnalogously, if a unit of capital is valued at the market price St\nand St\n= Qt\n, optimal demand\nfor capital satisfies\nRS\nt\n=\nRk\nt\n+ (1 - )St\nwhere  is the depreciation rate whose parameter value is discussed in the calibration section.\nActually the latter condition is the relevant optimally condition for the capital demand by the\nentrepreneur.\nThe fundamental return and the market return on capital are related as follows\nRS\nt\n= RQ\nt\n)\nSt\n+ SQ\nt\nThe parameter a determines the speed of convergence back to the fundamental price Qt\nand b\nis given by b  a(1 - ).7 The shock to the fundamental value SQ\nt\nis normally distributed with\nvariance 2\nS\n.

This maximization problem is standard and a\ndetailed description can be found for example in Dib (2009).\nTo introduce sticky prices we assume that retailers are Calvo (1983) price setters. This is a\ncommon assumption in the New-Keynesian literature and implies that each period there is an\nexogenous probability of 1 - p\nthat a retailer is able to adjust its price. The rest of the retailers\nindex their prices to current inflation. As in Bernanke et al. (1999) monopolistic retailers buy\nthe product of the entrepreneur, transform it into final output at no cost and sell it to households\nor capital goods producers. The expected discounted profit function that the retailer maximizes\ntakes the form:\nR\nt\n=\n\nk\np\nt,k\nP\nt\n- Pw\nt+k\nPt+k\nY \nt+k\nwhere    Ct\nCt+k\ndenotes the stochastic discount factor of households as those benefit from the\nprofits of the retailer. Finally Pw\nt\n Pt\nZt\nis the nominal price of wholesale goods with Zt\nbeing\nthe gross markup.\n7In the case of rational bubbles this value would be one, see Blanchard and Watson (1982).\n2.5 Interbank Borrowing Bank j\nA commercial bank j has market power and maximizes over both the deposit rate RD\nt\nand the\nloan rate RB\nt\nwhile taking the interest rate prevailing on the interbank market RIB\nt\nas given.

(2010)).\nDt\n(j) =\nRD\nt\n(j)\nRD\nt\nd\nDt\nBt\n(j) =\nRB\nt\n(j)\nRB\nt\n- h\nBt\n= f(j)Bt\n= f(j)(Qt\nKt\n- Nt\nIn return for the loan Bt\n(j) = f(j)(Qt\nKt\n-Nt\n) to the entrepreneur, a commercial bank j obtains\ncollateral worth f(j)Qt\nKt\n. It is assumed that a commercial bank j possesses a technology to\ntransform the illiquid capital stock into a marketable security. In the following we will refer\nto the financial instrument generated in this process as asset-backed security. In contrast to the\nvalue of the capital stock f(j)Qt\nKt\n, the value of the asset-backed security portfolio of bank j\nis given by\n(j) = f(j)St\nKt\nThe assumption that the risky asset ABSt\n(j) depends on the market price St\nand not on the\nfundamental price Qt\nallows us to consider the effect of asset price movements on the behavior\nof banks in the interbank market where these securities serve as collateral.\nOur model also features a borrowing constraint in a borrower-lender relationship in the form\nproposed by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). However, in our model the financial friction arises\nbetween the commercial bank j and an interbank lending bank k. The borrowing constraint of\na commercial bank vis-a-vis an interbank lending bank takes the following form8\nRIB\nt\n mt\nEt\nKt\nIn order to obtain interbank liquidity IBt\n(j) at the interbank interest rate RIB\nt\nthe commercial\nbank j offers its asset backed securities (ABS) as collateral. The commercial bank j's ability\nto obtain interbank liquidity is limited by the expected value of the asset portfolio in the next\nperiod. However, an interbank lending bank k encounters transaction costs which are propor-\ntional to the collateral value, (1 - mt\nKt\n. These transaction costs comprise the time to find\na buyer for the collateral and legal fees paid in the process of liquidating the pledged assets.\nHence, to ensure full repayment in the case of a default of the commercial bank j, the maxi-\nmum amount of interbank liquidity granted by a commercial bank k is given by mt\nEt\nKt\nwhere mt\nis the loan-to-value ratio which responds to deviations of the market price of capital\nfrom the fundamental price, ut\n, to account for the reluctance of an interbank lending bank to\nprovide interbank loans in the presence of asset price bubbles. As mt\n< 1 is assumed, the\nsize of the interbank loan to a bank j will always be strictly lower than the value of the asset\nportfolio in the next period. In log-linearized terms mt\nis set according to the following rule9:\nmt\n= m\n-  \u00b7 ut\n+ m\nt\nFinally, the balance sheet identity has to hold in all periods t.\nBt\n(j) = Dt\n(j) + IBt\n2.6 Interbank Lending Bank k\nThe activities performed by a commercial bank k vis-a-vis the private sector are identical to\nthose of a commercial bank j. However, compared to a commercial bank j, a commercial bank\nk invests its funds in a liquid asset Gt\nand not in a risky asset. The liquid asset Gt\ncan be always\nexchanged against central bank liquidity if a commercial bank k is willing to supply liquidity\non the interbank market. Because the funding structure is identical across interbank lending\nbanks the interest rate paid on deposits will be the same across commercial banks. Moreover,\nwe assume that the difference between the interest rate paid on deposits and the interest ob-\ntained from the investment in the liquid asset Gt\nis negligible and we are able to ignore it in the\noptimization problem of the commercial bank k.\nThe interest rate on the interbank market RIB\nt\nis endogenously determined by the profit maxi-\nmizing behavior of interbank lending banks and interbank borrowing banks. Hence, a commer-\ncial bank k which considers lending to a commercial bank j takes the policy rate Rt\nset by the\ncentral bank as given and decides optimally about the amount of liquidity supplied on the inter-\nbank market. Each commercial bank k maximizes its profit function which has the following\nform\nIB\nt\n(k) = RIB\nt\n(k) - Rt\nt\n(k) - Xt\n8We assume that the borrowing constraint is satisfied with equality because the size of the shock is sufficiently\nsmall such that the economy remains in the neighborhood of the steady-state. See Iacoviello (2005)\n9In section 4.3 we assume that the loan-to-value ratio is controlled by a supervisory authority and therefore the\ndeviation of the market price from its fundamental value has to be included\nwhere Rt\ndenotes the policy rate which is set by the central bank (see Section 2.7), MD\nt\n(k) is\nthe demand for central bank liquidity and Xt\n(k) a deposit opportunity for the interbank lending\nbank k at the central bank. Defining a spread prevailing in the interbank market as\nRSpread\nt\nt\n- Rt\nwe can restate the profit function (21) as follows:\nIB\nt\n(k) = RSpread\nt\n(k) + MD\nt\n(k) - Xt\n(k) + Rt\n(k) - RIB\nt\nMD\nt\n(k) + RIB\nt\nXt\nEquation 23 emphasizes that the commercial bank k not only cares about the absolute interbank\nrate but equivalently about the spread between the interbank interest rate and the policy rate set\nby the central bank. In this way we capture the fact of the spread being a multivariate function\nof (1) the tension in the interbank market (volume IBt\n) (2) the liquidity supply decision of the\ncentral bank (Mt\nand ht\n) and (3) the financial stability stance (mt\n). We assume that commercial\nbank k's demand for central bank liquidity depends on the optimally chosen value for interbank\nlending and riskless asset as follows\nMD\nt\n(k) = IBt\n(k)Xt\nUnlike the Cobb-Douglas production function which takes labor and capital as input factors\nand yields goods as output, here the only input factor is the supply of central bank liquidity Mt\nwhose division among interbank funds and deposits is governed by the parameter . If  is equal\nto one, there is a one-to-one relationship between the additional liquidity supply of the central\nbank and the supply of interbank liquidity on the interbank market. However,  is assumed to\nbe strictly smaller than one to account for the effect of the money multiplier.\nIn exchange for an interbank loan IBt\n(k) a commercial bank k receives collateral ABSt\n(k)\nfrom a commercial bank j which is subject to a haircut ht\nin liquidity operations of the central\nbank. In addition, a commercial bank k possesses an exogenously given amount of liquid assets\nGt\n(k) fully eligible as collateral in repurchase agreements with the central bank. Hence, the\ncommercial bank k faces the following collateral constraint\nMD\nt\n(k) = Gt\n(k) + (1 - ht\nt\nIf ht\n= 1 the central bank does not accept asset-backed securities.10 The lower the haircut,\nthe lower the discount applied to the risky asset by the central bank and hence the higher the\nvolume of liquidity obtainable per unit of asset-backed securities.\nIn equilibrium the supply of central bank liquidity has to equal the demand for interbank liquid-\nity given in equation (24).\nA central bank sets the monetary policy rate Rt\nin response to deviations of output and expected\ninflation. Moreover, we allow for interest rate smoothing on part of the central bank.\nRt\n= r\n+ \n(Et\n- \u00af\n) + y\n(Y - \u00af\nY ) + R\nt\n10This would be the case of the Fed before the crisis. In Europe the haircut was lower than one even before the\ncrisis and were lowered even more during the crisis.\nIn addition, we assume that the central bank is interested in financial market stability and es-\npecially in a liquid interbank market. In this context the central bank decides which assets are\neligible as collateral in repurchase agreements and through this device it is able to vary the liq-\nuidity supply to the banking sector directly. The haircut ht\nset by the central bank is specified\nby the following process\nht\n= h\n- h\nt\nand is negatively related to a central bank's liquidity, that is, if the central bank decreases the\nhaircut ht\n, the liquidity supply increases.\nWe do not postulate that the haircut rule should substitute the interest rate rule. The haircut rule,\nhowever, is suited to fine-tune the liquidity situation on the interbank market once the interest\nrule policy does not have the desired effect anymore because, for example, of the zero lower\nbound. In addition to that it is another tool that helps to smooth the business cycle. We can show\nthat a decrease in the haircut can stimulate both the interbank market and the real economy.\nThe profit function of the central bank consists of seigniorage minus the payment on deposits a\ncommercial bank k holds in its account with the central bank:\nCB\nt\n=\nt\nMcb\n-\nt\nThe profits of the central bank are distributed among the households.\n2.8 Aggregate Conditions\nIn equilibrium the following aggregate conditions have to hold.\nThe amount borrowed by an entrepreneur across commercial bank j has to equal the amount of\nloans granted to the entrepreneur by the commercial bank sector. X denotes the relative mass\nof agent X.\nBt\n= jBt\nThe same holds true for the savings of households and deposits accepted by commercial banks\njDt\n(j) = P Dt\nTotal interbank lending has to satisfy\njIBt\n(j) = kIBt\nMoney provided by the central bank has to equal the total money demand by commercial banks\nk.\nMCB\nt\n= kMk\nt\nThe total supply of asset-backed securities is constrained by the available capital stock K and\nthe market price of capital S.\n= St\nKt\nThe maximum amount of collateral the commercial banks j can offer to commercial banks k is\nthen given by (33). Summing across the demand for collateral by commercial banks k and the\nsupply of collateral by commercial banks j the following condition holds\n= kABSt\n(k) = jABSt\nFinally, goods market clearing requires\nYt\n= Ct\n+ Gt\n+ CEt\n+ Qt\nKh\nt\n- (1 - )Kh\n3 Calibration\nOne crucial task of calibrating this model is to deal both with a real sector where one period\nusually corresponds to one quarter as macroeconomic aggregates like GDP are updated on a\nquarterly basis and a financial sector where information about financial variables are updated at\na much higher frequency. Hence, as a compromise we decide to calibrate the model to monthly\ndata11. So most of the parameters on which the literature agreed on and that are calibrated to\nquarterly data are adjusted to a monthly frequency. The discount rate of households  is set to\n0.997 which corresponds to a yearly interest rate of 3.6%, which is in line with other studies\nwhich assume 4% per year. For the instantaneous household utility we assume log preferences\nin both consumption and labor. The fraction of capital employed in the production process \nis set to 0.33 which is a value commonly found in the literature. With respect to the rate of\ndepreciation which is commonly calibrated to be 10% per year, we set the monthly depreciation\nrate to a value of 0.008. The coefficient determining the mark-up p\nis time-invariant and set\nto 6 as for example in Bernanke et al. (1999). However, the fraction of retailers being able to\nset prices each period is set slightly lower than in the quarterly specification. In a quarterly\nsetting it is usually assumed (as in Bernanke et al. (1999)) that (1 - p\ncontext we set this value to 0.15 to account for the monthly frequency. Both the elasticities of\nthe demand functions for entrepreneurial loans and household deposits and the adjustment cost\nparameters for both interest rates are taken from Gerali et al. (2010) and are multiplied by three\nas the values used in Gerali et al. (2010) are calibrated to a quarterly model. Thus, the values\nthe adjustment cost parameter d\nand b\n, respectively.\nThe financial friction parameter  which is calibrated by Bernanke et al. (1999) to be 0.05 is\nrecalibrated with our parameters from above and equals 0.0506. Two parameters are important\nfor the development of the bubble process, a and b. Those are exactly set as in Bernanke and\nlabor is chosen to be 0.01 as is common in the literature, see Bernanke et al. (1999). The\nelasticity of Tobin's q with respect to investment is set to 0.5 as in Bernanke and Gertler (2001).\nThe leverage of the entrepreneurs is assumed to be 2. Finally, in line with Bernanke and Gertler\nThe values in the interest rate rule are set in accordance with Taylor (1993). With respect to the\nautoregressive parameters in the AR(1) shock processes we increase all values in comparison\nto existing studies as those were chosen to match quarterly time series dynamics. Thus, in our\nstudy they take on values in the range from 0.95 in the case of government expenditure to 0.99\nin the case of the haircut and the policy rate set by the central bank.\nThe single parameter that is completely unknown in the literature is the intensity of interbank\nloans or deposits in the production function of a commercial bank k denoted by . We set\nit to  = 0.9 which seems reasonable and is in line with most of the banks' balance sheets.\nIn addition the robustness checks indicate that the results are robust to higher values for this\nparameter. The haircut is set in steady state to be 0.2, as the ECB paid a little more than 80\npercent for BBB ranked assets.\nA comprehensive summary of all parameter and imposed steady state values can be found in\nAppendix C.\n11This approach is also often used in the macro-finance literature, see for example Borgy, Mesonnier, Laubach,\nIn this section we discuss the results of the model. In the impulse response analysis of Section\n4.1 we discuss how the model developed in Section 2 reacts to a set of shocks. Furthermore,\nwe compare the impulse responses for the same set of shocks both in a model setup with and\nwithout an interbank market. In the case without an interbank market we assume that the com-\nmercial bank k does not exist. As the commercial bank j is then in direct contact with the\ncentral bank no interbank lending occurs in equilibrium and the interbank rate is identical to\nthe policy rate.12 This enables us to study the implications of incorporating an interbank market\non the model dynamics. In Section 4.2 we answer the question whether in our model frame-\nwork central banks should \"lean against the wind\", that is, if a central bank should react to asset\nprices or not. Boom-bust cycles caused by market price fluctuations are simulated following the\nprocedure laid out in Bernanke and Gertler (1999). Finally, in Section 4.3 three different exit\nstrategies for the central bank are analyzed within the model framework proposed in Section 2.\n4.1 Impulse Response Analysis\nIn this section we examine the model dynamics in response to four types of shocks: a monetary\npolicy shock, a shock to the haircut ht\napplied to risky assets, a shock to technology At\nand to\nthe market price of capital St\n. The impulse responses are expressed in percentage deviations\nfrom steady state and one period corresponds to one month. All corresponding figures can be\nfound in Appendix D.1.\nFigure 2 shows the impulse response functions to an unanticipated 25 bp increase (3 pp in an-\nnualized terms) in the nominal interest rate. As the policy rate rises, liquidity demanded by\nthe commercial bank k declines and the interest rate for interbank loans increases. This in turn\nlets the commercial banks demand less interbank funds. At the same time a higher interest rate\ninduces the commercial bank k to hold more deposits at the central bank. This countercyclical\nmovement of interbank loans and deposits is due to the specification of the production function\nof the commercial bank k.13 As a result the fundamental price of capital Qt\ndecreases on im-\npact before returning gradually to its steady state. Because the loan rate RB\nt\nincreases as well,\ndemand for capital by the entrepreneur decreases. Thus the capital stock declines and output\ndeclines. Hence, our model recommends to raise interest rates in response to a boom in asset\nprices.\nAn interbank market smoothes the responses of the economy to a monetary policy shock com-\npared to the case without an interbank market. Taking for example output and inflation, the\nimpulse responses are all qualitatively the same but the initial impact is much more pronounced.\nLiquidity decreases more than in the case where an interbank market is not present. Moreover,\nthe decline in the fundamental price of capital and thus the decline in the value of asset-backed\nsecurities is stronger if the interbank market is shut down.\nIf the central bank lowers the haircut on asset-backed securities temporarily, the liquidity supply\nincreases on impact and converges slowly back to its steady-state (see Figure 3). This is due to\nthe fact that the autoregressive parameter of the haircut is chosen to be very close to one and\n12Even in the model without an interbank market the results will differ from Bernanke and Gertler (1999) due\nto the presence of an profit maximizing commercial bank\n13The percentage increase in deposits is much higher because its steady state value is very low.\none time period corresponds to one month.14 As expected both output and inflation increase on\nimpact in response to a 10% decrease in the haircut applied by the central bank. The lowering\nof the haircut has a positive effect on the fundamental price of capital which then increases the\nvalue of the asset-backed securities. As the total value of collateral offered by the commercial\nbanks in return for interbank loans increases, the interbank lending rate decreases which stim-\nulates interbank lending. Besides rising interbank lending also deposits go up. This is the only\ntime that both quantities move in the same direction.15 This stimulus, however, comes at a cost\nof higher inflation.16\nIn Figure 4 technology increases by 1%. As this shock originates in the real sector the responses\nof the real variables (output, inflation, fundamental price of capital) are in line with other stud-\nies that incorporate a financial accelerator (see Bernanke et al. (1999) and Christensen and Dib\n(2008)). As the technology shock leads to a decrease in the policy rate, the interbank lend-\ning rate decreases as well which in turn stimulates interbank lending activity. In the case of\na technology shock the two setups deliver similar responses for output and consumption. If\nthe interbank market is missing the price of capital and therefore the asset-backed securities\nare deviating a bit more from their respective steady states. The same holds true for liquidity.\nIf anything, then a shock to technology is dampened by the presence of the interbank market,\nalthough not by as much as in the case of a monetary policy shock.\nFinally, we analyze a shock which leads to a 10% increase in the market price St\nfor the first time, the impulse responses of market price and fundamental price are not identical\n(see Figure 5). While both prices increase, the market value rises by ten percent more, driving\nup the value of the asset-backed securities above their fundamental value as their value depends\non the market price St\n. Although the liquidity supply by the central bank rises with the value\nof the asset backed securities, banks are reluctant to increase their interbank lending and rather\ninvest in riskless deposits. Hence, in our model banks become more cautious in their investment\nbehavior in response to sharp increases in asset prices. Although the increase in the value of\nthe asset-backed securities results from a shock to the market price and not from an increase in\nthe liquidity supplied by the central bank, the model resembles the behavior of the banks in the\naftermath of the financial crisis. Namely, that in response to an increase in liquidity banks are\nreluctant to lend in the interbank market and rather invest in riskfree assets.\nA shock to the market price St\nexhibits a significantly different evolution of variables. With-\nout an interbank market the size of the market price increase is only about a third compared to\nits impact in the setup that features an interbank market. Asset-backed securities and liquidity\nshow similar responses across model specifications. After all volatility is nevertheless greatly\nreduced once the interbank market is eliminated. In this case the interbank market amplifies\nshocks to the market price of capital St\n.\n14In a period of forty months liquidity as well as the other persistent financial variables converge back to their\nsteady states\n15Compare on the real side the increase of both labor and capital after a technology shock using the same\nproduction function specification.\n16A comparison between the model with and without an interbank market is not very meaningful here as the\nhaircut policy in our setup only works with an interbank market. The assumption hinges on the fact that the com-\nmercial bank k gets liquidity from the central bank in exchange for government bonds and asset-backed securities.\nOnce the interbank market is eliminated, the Central Bank has full control over the liquidity supply to the banking\nsector.\n17The deviation of the fundamental value Qt from the market price St is denoted by ut\n4.2 Boom-Bust Cycles\nIn this subsection we apply the methodology of Bernanke and Gertler (1999) and Bernanke\nand Gertler (2001) to a model framework with a microfounded interbank market and where the\ncentral bank has an additional central bank instrument, namely, the haircut rule given in equation\n(36). The question we try to answer is whether central banks should `lean against the wind',\nthat is, if a central bank should respond to deviations of asset prices from their fundamental\nvalue. To account for this possibility we incorporate both in the Taylor rule as well as in the\nhaircut rule deviations of the market value from its steady state if we consider reactions to the\nasset price.\nRt\n= r\n+ \n(Et\n- \u00af\n) + y\n(Y - \u00af\nY ) + d(St\n- \u00af\nS) + R\nt\nht\n= h\n+ c(St\n- \u00af\nS) - h\nt\nThe parameter c determines the sensitivity of the central bank to asset price deviations from\nits fundamental value \u00af\nS which is equal to \u00af\nQ in equilibrium. As a \"leaning-against-the-wind\"-\npolicy is considered c > 0 is assumed. Thus the central bank will decrease the haircut if the\nmarket price of capital St\nis below its steady-state. We plot six variables18: Output and inflation\nto analyze the impact on macroeconomic volatility, interbank loans and the external finance\npremium to consider financial markets and the fundamental market price as well as the market\nprice of capital.\nIn this subsection we compare five different cases which are specified in Table 2. These cases\ndiffer in the central bank's reaction to asset price deviations when deciding about the setting of\ntheir policy instruments. In case 1 the central bank only reacts to inflation and output with the\nTaylor rule. The haircut rule is autoregressive. Asset prices are not targeted at all. Compared to\nthis, case 2 includes asset prices in the Taylor rule with the same coefficient used in Bernanke\nand Gertler (1999). The haircut rule is not responding to the market price of capital. Cases 3\nto 5 reflect no asset price targeting in the interest rate rule but responding to deviations of the\nmarket price of capital with the haircut rule where c is increasing from 0.1 to 0.5.\nCases Values\n y c d\nTable 2: Boom-Bust Cycle Analysis: Cases\nFigure 6 resembles the analysis of Bernanke and Gertler (1999) and Bernanke and Gertler\n(2001) within our model setup and compares conventional monetary policy with and without\na central bank following a \"leaning-against-the-wind\"-policy. In this case the haircut rule is a\n18Bernanke and Gertler (1999) also plot only six variables: output, inflation, the market price of capital, the\nfundamental price of capital, the return on capital and the external finance premium\nsimple AR(1) process that does not react to asset prices. To assess the quantitative importance\nof the stability gains we calculate the variances for each of the six variables shown in Figure 6.\nOutput Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S Interbank Loans Ext.Fin.Premium\nTable 3: Stabilization Gains I\nThe results for cases 1 and 2 indicate that it does not make a difference if the monetary authority\nis targeting asset prices or not. If anything, however, the evolution of inflation for example is a\nbit more dampened if the interest rate rule reacts to asset prices. This is different from Bernanke\nand Gertler (1999) and is likely to stem from the fact that the interbank market amplifies market\nprice shocks. Hence, if they are mitigated by a rule, boom-bust cycles are less pronounced.\nHowever, even more important is the answer to the question, which instrument is more appro-\npriate to target asset prices. Therefore we plot in Figure 7 once again the Taylor rule which\nincorporates asset prices and also the haircut rule with different reaction coefficients on market\nprices of capital. To assess the quantitative importance of the stability gains we calculate the\nvariances for each of the six variables shown in Figure 7.\nOutput Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S Interbank Loans Ext.Fin.Premium\nTable 4: Stabilization Gains II\nBased on the results in Table 4 which depicts the variances of the variables plotted in Figure\n7 we can confirm the result of Cecchetti, Genberg, and Wadhwani (2002) who argue in favor\nof including asset prices in the set of instruments by the monetary authority. But the overall\nperformance can be dramatically improved if the haircut rule is allowed to respond to asset\nprices. The stronger the coefficient, the larger the macro-stabilization gains. As a result, our\nmodel predicts that macroeconomic stability is higher if a central bank uses a haircut policy and\nnot the interest rate policy to increase its liquidity supply.\nIn the aftermath of a crisis exit strategies and primarily the timing of the exit are very important\nquestions for central banks. We are not able to determine the optimal exit date within our model.\nNevertheless we are able to analyze the response of the economy to an exit. Methodologically\nwe follow Winkler and Angeloni (2011) who examine exit strategies at the government level in\na deterministic environment. However, we perform this exercise in connection with exit strate-\ngies of the monetary authority. In our scenario we examine three cases: (1) the exit from a\nhaircut policy by which risky assets are purchased at lower haircuts than normal and (2) the\nsimultaneous exit from both the above mentioned haircut policy and an interest rate policy that\nkeeps the interest rate close to its zero lower bound and (3) an exit from a policy that keeps the\nloan-to-value ratio at a level above normal.19\nIn Figure 8 we depict four variables and their reactions if the market price is shocked negatively.\nOne path shows how the economy evolves if the central bank can credibly commit not to exit\nfrom its haircut policy (\"no exit\"). Given a negative shock to the market price, the haircut de-\ncreases which keeps output and the prices of capital close to their steady state values. However,\ninflation rises before stabilizing at a higher level. Another path exemplifies how the variables\nevolve if agents are surprised by the fact that the central bank ignores deviations of the market\nprice of capital from period twenty-five onwards (\"unanticipated exit\") and the haircut returns\nback to its steady-state value at a pace governed by the AR-coefficient h\n. It is obvious that\nuntil the time of the unanticipated exit the economy's response is identical to the \"no exit\"-case.\nAfterwards, given that the haircut is no longer responding to the asset price, output and inflation\ndrop immediately and considerably, as liquidity is reduced sharply. In addition, the prices of\ncapital reduce unexpectedly before returning gradually to the steady state value. The last path\ndepicted in Figure 8 belongs to a situation where the agents anticipate correctly from the very\nbeginning that after twenty-four periods the central bank is no longer stimulating the economy\nwith its haircut instrument (`anticipated exit'). Hence, for all variables this path has to differ\nfrom period one onwards as the expectation of the central bank abandoning the liquidity provi-\nsion drives up output after a few periods and lets inflation fall from the very beginning. Once\nthe haircut rule is actually shut down, the prices of capital and output experience a sudden but\nonly slight dip before returning quickly to their steady states. Only inflation takes longer to\nadjust. Table 5 shows the variances of the four variables plotted in Figure 8. The variances are\nlowest for the case of a constant haircut. Moreover, the variances are significantly lower if the\ncentral bank exits its constant haircut policy as anticipated by the agents in the model.\nOutput Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S\nTable 5: Exit from Haircut Policy\nFigure 9 shows the results of a central bank which exits its haircut policy after twenty-four\nperiods and simultaneously increases the interest rate to a level implied by the Taylor-rule. The\nresults are more mixed in this example. For output and inflation the anticipated response is\nmuch closer to the unanticipated one. Unlike in the previous case where only an exit from the\nlow haircut regime rule was examined the response to inflation looks much smoother with an\ninitial huge spike in the beginning when the interest rate is allowed to increase above the zero\nlower bound. But the response of both prices of capital is less pronounced in the case of an\nanticipated exit.\n19One could assume that the loan-to-value is controlled by a supervisory authority whose only objective is to\nkeep excesses on the interbank market at bay. Note that both the haircut rule and the loan-to-value ratio respond to\nasset price deviations.\nOutput Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S\nTable 6: Exit from Haircut Policy plus Taylor-Rule\nThe conclusion drawn from the variances in Table 6 is that less volatility in inflation comes\nat the cost of more volatility in the other variables. While overall the level of the variances is\nhigher, again the anticipated exit is preferable to an unanticipated exit.\nFinally, in Figure 10 we assume that the central bank is able to control the loan-to-value ratio and\nacts as a supervisory authority. The setup is the same as in the previous cases with the instrument\nbeing shut down after twenty-four periods and letting it return to its steady-state value at a speed\ngoverned by a pure AR(1) process afterwards. In the `no exit'-case the loan-to-value ratio would\nbe constantly above its steady-state value which leads to very little macroeconomic volatility\nas can be seen in Figure 10. After a shock to the market price output decreases and inflation\nincreases slightly. In the case of an anticipated exit, the reaction of output and and inflation is\nstronger. After the exit, output as well as the prices for capital increase sharply whereas inflation\ndrops considerably because we assumed that the loan-to-value ratio runs countercyclical to the\ndevelopment in the asset-backed securities. Once the loan-to-value ratio returns to its normal\nlevel, the value of asset-backed securities increases and overall demand in the real sector drives\nup the price of capital and output. If the exit is unanticipated by the agents, output and the price\nof capital increase even stronger. This is confirmed by the variances produced by the simulation\nand which are depicted in Table 7.\nOutput Inflation Fundamental Price Q Market Price S\nTable 7: Exit from Constant Loan-to-Value Ratio\n5 Conclusion\nThe financial crisis has changed the way economists have to think about modeling and de-\nscribing monetary policy. This paper tries to take a step in the right direction by modeling an\ninterbank sector with optimizing banks in the presence of an interbank market. By this model-\ning device unconventional monetary policy can be analyzed which includes not only a simple\ninterest rate rule but also a collateral policy. This unconventional monetary policy has important\nimplications for the characteristics of business cycles. Furthermore, we are able to take up the\ndebate on leaning against the wind and argue whether it is advisable to include asset prices in\nthe monetary policy setup and enhance the debate by analyzing a second monetary instrument,\nnamely the haircut.\nWe find that the interbank market matters for the economy as a whole as it decreases macroe-\nconomic volatility if an interest rate shock hits the economy and amplifies it if an asset price\nbubble occurs. Once this market is drying up or risks to be malfunctioning, central banks are\nable to react and stimulate the liquidity situation on this market by resorting to an additional\ninstrument besides traditional interest rate policy. The haircut as an additional instrument can\nbe assumed to be even more important if the policy rate set by the central bank is already close\nto the zero lower bound and restricts the leeway of a central bank. Decreasing haircuts is the\ninstrument we analyzed and it works fine to boost interbank lending and increase output in total.\nThis comes at the risk of increased inflation in the first periods after a negative shock to haircuts.\nWith respect to the ongoing debate in the literature we back the position of Bernanke and Gertler\n(1999) and claim that asset prices should not be incorporated in the interest rate rule. However,\nin this model framework both financial and macroeconomic volatility are lowest if asset price\ndeviations are taken into consideration in the haircut rule. After a negative shock to the market\nprices of financial assets, central banks can reduce the macroeconomic volatility further if they\ncommit to exit at a pre-announced date. Agents' expectations formation contributes then to a\nsmoothing of key variables. If they do not exit at all from this policy, all other macro variables\nare nevertheless well stabilized at the cost of higher inflation.\nAn interesting way to extend the model would be first to implement default probabilities on\nthe interbank market which certainly would increase the responses in a financial crisis setup.\nSecondly, having already some type of shocks included both in the real as well as in the fi-\nnancial sector, one further possibility would be to estimate the model to match certain country\ncharacteristics more accurately.\nAppendix\nA Model Graph\nCentral\nbank\nInterbank\nMarket\nInterbank\nLending\nBanks\nInterbank\nBorrowing\nBanks\nEntrepreneur Households\nDeposits\nDeposits\nLoans\nCollateral\nIB Loan IB Loan\nCollateral\nCollateral\nLiquidity\nFigure 1: Structure of the economy\nB Model Equations\nB.1 First-order Conditions\nPatient Households\nt\n= (Ct\n(h))-\nt\nRD\nt\nt\nWt\n= \n(h))l\nEntrepreneurs\nRk\nt\n= MCt\nYt\nKt\nWt\n= (1 -
