    "reduced_content": "The morphology of urban land use\nM Batty, P A Longley\nDepartment of Town Planning, University of Wales at Cardiff, PO Box 906, Cardiff CF1 3YN, Wales\n Introduction\nDuring the last twenty years, analysis of the regularities in the form of cities has\nbeen largely based on models which identify activities which scale with one another.\nSuch scaling relations are central to social physics; they are manifest in the way\nmovement between places is attenuated or scaled inversely with distance, and the way\nin which different sized places are clustered in the urban hierarchy. Distance, size,\nand frequency are embodied in spatial interaction models of movement and in central\nplace theory, in which city size is structured around the idea of a rank-size rule.\nHitherto, there has been little emphasis on the meaning of the scale coefficients\nassociated with such models. In gravitational models, for example, departures from\nthe inverse square law are defined away as behavioural effects, distinct from the\nphysical constraints of space. In the last ten years, however, a powerful new\ngeometry has emerged. This is not only able to interpret scaling relations in a new\nlight and explain differences from theoretical postulates; it is able to demonstrate\nhow the regularity posed by Euclidean geometry, with its emphasis on simple\ndimensions, can be generalised to embrace the kinds of irregularities empirically\nassociated both with natural and with artificial realities. Fractal geometry, as it has\nbeen termed by its popularist Mandelbrot (1983), is able to explain many types of\nirregular form which have hitherto resisted scientific classification and explanation.\nThis geometry enables 'order' to be extracted from what has always been considered\n'chaos', and it has heralded a new dawn for the age-old study of theories of form.\nThere are three central constructs to fractal geometry. In essence, the geometry\nconcerns relationships based on scaling, but with the characteristic that such\nrelationships are invariant to scale: that is, relationships hold over several orders of\nmagnitude. The consequence of this first idea is a second one which suggests that\nthe form of the objects in question is similar over these orders of magnitude. In\nshort, such objects appear the same when viewed at different scales, typical examples\nbeing rough terrain, branching structures such as trees, cloud formations, and so\non. Fractal objects such as these are called self-similar. The third concept is the\nmost powerful and involves dimension. Euclidean geometry deals with the integral\ndimensions: 1, 2, 3, and upwards to the higher dimensions. Fractal geometry is\nbased on noninteger, 'fractional', or as it is now referred to, fractal dimension. The\nbasis on which an object is fractal or not is its irregularity over scale, and if the\nobject is self-similar, its form can be captured in the single measure of its fractal\ndimension. If such a dimension can be computed with confidence, the objects in\nquestion must clearly manifest self-similarity and scale invariance, albeit usually in\na statistical sense.\nThe simplest fractals to visualise are those whose dimensions lie between 1 and 2.\nThe best example is that of a natural boundary such as a coastline which is more\nirregular than a straight line of dimension 1, but is clearly less than the area of a\nplane which has dimension 2. As such boundaries become more tortuous, the\nfractal dimension increases until the curve in question twists and turns to fill the\nspace available. There are many conundrums in measuring such fractal curves, for\nit can easily be shown that the length of such curves depends upon the scale and\nsophistication of the measuring device, although the area enclosed by such curves\nis always finite. Natural phenomena such as coastlines and man-made boundaries\nsuch as frontiers are both fractals (Richardson, 1961). It is clear that a preliminary\napproach to measuring the extent and irregularity of urban areas must begin with\nan assessment of the extent to which the boundaries defining such areas are fractal.\nIn this paper, we will extend our earlier work in measuring such boundaries (Batty\nsized English town, Swindon, Wiltshire which had a population of 125 000 in\n1981. This paper will also embrace an attempt to classify various land uses on the\nbasis of their fractal dimensions.\nThere have been many attempts in several disciplines to use fractal geometry to\nmeasure morphologies by defining edges which can be treated as boundaries. In\nfine particle science, there is a stream of work based on measuring the irregularity\nof two-dimensional outlines (Kaye, 1986). Much work exists in defining the fractal\ndimensions of coastlines (Kaproff, 1986) and terrain (Mark and Aronson, 1984), in\nthe geometry of fracture (Aviles et al, 1987), and in cartographic line generalisation\n(Muller, 1987). This is apart from the enormous literature that now exists in the\nphysics of phase transitions, metereology, the mathematics of iterated functions, and\nin computer graphics. We have referenced only those areas which involve the\ndefinition and measurement of identifiable boundaries in the plane, and the literature\ncited is the latest we have come across in a long line of related work. Interested\nreaders are also referred to the review article by Goodchild and Mark (1987) for a\nrecent survey of applications in spatial analysis.\nMethods for determining the fractal dimension, and hence the irregularity of\ncurves, are comparatively straightforward. Richardson (1961) first demonstrated\nthe usual method, which consists of measuring the length of a curve at different\nscales, and finding the least squares fit of length to scale from which the dimension\nis an immediate consequence. However, the method is sensitive to the way length is\nmeasured, and to the number of scales over which the relationship is likely to\nhold. We have demonstrated variations and problems in this method in earlier\nthe main purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which we can associate\ndifferent boundaries with different areas, in this case of land uses, based on their\nfractal dimensions. An immediate problem which will be raised is the fact that\nmost land uses share the same boundaries with other land uses; in a system of\ncontiguous areas like a town, the boundary to each use will always consist of parts\nThe morphology of urban land use 463\nof the boundary of other uses. The convoluted nature of every boundary poses\nsevere conceptual problems which we will raise, if not resolve, for the first time here.\nWe will begin by providing a consistent summary of the mathematics of scale\nand dimension involving the line and the plane. We will then present two models\nof scale dependence, and four methods or algorithms for extracting fractal dimensions\nfrom various boundary data. The application of these methods to land-use boundaries\nin Swindon is then presented beginning with a description of the characteristics of\nthe urban area in question. Fractal dimensions based on area - perimeter relations\nacross scales are then estimated, and these same dimensions are then derived by\nexamining scale changes within the digital representation of the perimeters themselves.\nLast, individual dimensions of each of the land-use parcels are derived, and\ninterpretations are made as to the extent to which land uses can be classified on\nthe basis of their fractal dimensions. The analysis presented is inconclusive, but it\nis clear that careful measurement is required in such applications. The sensitivity\nof the analysis here to measurement differences casts considerable doubt on many of\nthe applications presented so far in a variety of fields. Directions for further\nresearch are then indicated.\nThe mathematics of scale and dimension\nIn Euclidean geometry, the measure of size in a given dimension will scale directly\nwith the measure in another (for example, adjacent) dimension; this scaling will be\nsome product of the dimensions themselves. Consider area A and volume V based\non two dimensions and three dimensions, respectively. Area has a size calculated\nas the square of the line measure P, that is P2, and volume has a size P3. If it is\nrequired to derive area from volume, it is clear that this can be done as A \u00b0c V2S.\nIn the same way, if it is required to derive the base line P, which we will hence-\nforth call perimeter, from area A, the relation is\nAll relationships such as those implied by equation (1) show that size in one\ndimension can be scaled directly if one knows the dimension of the object in a\nhigher or lower dimension. For example, if A = jtr2, the area of a circle with\nradius r, P \u00b0c 7ir, and so on for a variety of regular forms. These types of relation\nappear widely in the natural sciences where they form an essential part of the\nstudy of relative growth, or allometry (Gould, 1966). If the relationship between\nline and area is as postulated in equation (1), this is the condition of isometry. If\nthe power of A were greater than \\, this would be positive allometry, if less, this\nwould be negative allometry.\nLet us now define the area at a given scale n as An\n. If area is regarded as a\nmeasuring device for the perimeter, now called Pn\n, when the scale is increased to\nn+1, it is clear that\nbecause more and more scaled detail about the boundary will be picked up. In\nfact, the conundrum emerges that, in the limit as n -* \u00b0o, the ratio of areas in\nequation (2) will converge, but the ratio of the perimeters will continue to increase.\nFrom equation (1) it is clear that, to derive P from A, area must be rescaled by a\nparameter which is greater than 1 but less than 2. That is\nwhere 1 < D < 2. If D = 2, then perimeter would scale up as area, which would\nimply that area be defined as a space-filling curve, a physically impossible\nrealisation for the kinds of systems dealt with here. If D = 1, perimeter would not\nscale more than the basic unit of measurement which would imply that no scale\neffects were present as area increased. The coefficient D is known as the\nHausdorff-Besicovitch or fractal dimension (Mandelbrot, 1983). In this context it\nserves as an empirical measure of how much the curve in question departs from a\nstraight line, thus indicating how 'crinkled' or tortuous the boundary across the\nspace is. The relation in equation (3) is known as the area-perimeter relation and\nit clearly implies a way of estimating the value of D (Lovejoy, 1982).\nThere is another way of showing how perimeter is related to the scale of\nmeasurement. Consider a scale defined by a unit Axn\n, where this is the basic unit\nused to define the perimeter Pn\n. When Axn\nis used to define the perimeter, it\nyields Nn\nchords such that Pn\n= Axn\nNn\n. Assume that the scale is now halved, so\nthat Axn+1\n= hAxn\n. This scale then yields Nn+l\nchords, but, as finer detail is\npicked up, Pn+1\n> Pn\n, which implies that\n% * > 2 , while - ^ \" = 2 . (4)\nEquation (4) shows that halving the scale yields more than twice the number of\nchords or line segments.\nTo derive Nn+1\n, hence Pn+i\n, from Axn+l\n, we can write equation (4) as\nAx, D\nNn\nl\nwhere D > 1 in the given case. Equation (5) can also be written as\np \\D\nNn+l\n= -- n - \\ , (6)\n;\nbut, as Pn\ncan be regarded as a base-level constant (a previous estimate of the\nperimeter), equation (6) can be simplified to\nA U = A A ^ . (7)\nThe perimeter Pn+l\nis now calculated from equation (7) as\nMore generally, the relation between any perimeter P and its scale Ax can be\nwritten as\nWe thus have two relationships for P, one in terms of area, as in equation (3), and\none in terms of scale, as in equation (9). Combining these gives\nIt is tempting to try to equate these by considering how A relates to the scale, Ax.\nHowever, it is not possible to do this in general, for it is only meaningful in special\ncases where the geometry is known or assumed.\nBesides the area-perimeter, and perimeter-scale relations, there is a third which\ncould be used to estimate the fractal dimension, D. This is the number-area rule,\nThe morphology of urban land use 465\nfraction of areas, F[A), with an area greater than A, to the area itself as\nWe will not use equation (11) in the sequel for it requires a much larger number of\nareas (in this case, land-use parcels) than the level of resolution of the example we\nhave chosen permits. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances amongst the kinds\nof applications described here where it might be useful.\nDetermining irregularity through the estimation of fractal dimension\nThe area - perimeter and perimeter - scale relations in equations (3) and (9),\nrespectively, are both power laws, the parameters of which can be estimated by\nmeans of least squares regression on their logarithmic transformations. However,\nthe data for these estimations are quite different. For the area - perimeter relation,\nit would in theory be possible to measure the area and perimeter of an irregular\nobject at different scales and perform the regression on these measurements; but\nthe relation is more suited to estimation with a series of areas and perimeters\nassociated with a set of objects, all of different sizes. If the relationship holds over\nmany scales, more scaling detail will be picked up in larger objects than in smaller\nones. In contrast, the perimeter-scale relation is best estimated by calculating\nperimeter lengths at different scales for the same object. Later in the paper, we\nwill explore the consequences of these two methods and note some of the conceptual\ndifficulties resulting from their comparison. In the rest of this section, however, we\nwill concern ourselves solely with their estimation and with techniques for measuring\nthe effects of scale.\nFirst, we will write the area - perimeter relation in equation (3) as\nwhere </> is a constant of proportionality and t(D) is some power function involving\nthe fractal dimension D, in this case f(D) = \\D. Taking logs of equation (12) gives\nl n P = ln^ + f(X>)lnA , (13)\nwhere, in the case of equation (3), ln^ is the intercept and i(D) = \\D is the slope\nof the regression line of the log of perimeter on the log of area. Clearly, the slope\nf(D) can take different functional forms from which D can always be derived, given\nan estimate of the slope. The perimeter - scale relation in equation (9) can also be\ngeneralised as\nwhere A is a constant of proportionality and g(D) a power function, which in terms\nof equation (9) is g(Z>) = 1-D. Taking logs of equation (14) gives\nlnP = lnA + g(D)lnAx, (15)\nwhere In A is the intercept and g(D) = 1-D is the slope of the regression of the\nlog of perimeter on the log of scale.\nThe conventional fractal model based on the use of equation (3) in equation (13)\nand equation (9) in equation (15), has a linear form, which implies that D is scale-\ninvariant. However, in some contexts, it can be hypothesised that dimension itself\nmight vary with scale or area and, in this case, the linear form would be more\ncomplex. We have used a second model based on the notion that fractal dimension\ndoes vary systematically with scale to model the perimeter-scale relations for the\nboundaries of urban development in the town of Cardiff (Batty and Longley, 1987b).\nThese models will also be tested here. In the case of the area-perimeter relation,\nthe fractal dimension D can be hypothesised as f(D) = y^c+dA) which when used\nin equation (13) gives\nInP = Inf + hcXnA+hMlnA . (16)\nIn equation (16), the coefficient \\c has an analogous role to \\D in equation (3) as\napplied to equation (13). The third term on the right-hand side of equation (1.6) is\na dispersion factor which measures the nonlinearity of the area - perimeter relation.\nIt is also clear that, as d -*- 0, c -+ D and equation (16) collapses back to the\nlogarithmic transformation of equation (3).\nFor the perimeter-scale relation, the hypothesis becomes g(D) = 1-D = a+bAx,\nwhere D is a linear function of the scale Ax. Using this in equation (15) gives\nInP = InX + alnAx+bAxlnAx. (17)\nAs b -* 0, (1 -a)\u00b7-\u00b7 D and equation (17) collapses back to the logarithmic\ntransformation of equation (9) in equation (15). The third term on the right-hand\nside of equation (17) is a dispersion factor, again measuring the nonlinearity of the\nperimeter - scale relation, and thus acting as a kind of weighted entropy modulating\nthe effect of the fractal dimension. In some contexts involving research into the\nstability of dimensions across scales, it has been postulated that the data are best\nfitted by a multifractal model in which several distinct regression lines can be\ndiscerned. In short, various ranges of scale are reflected by different dimensions\nand (17) is the logical consequence of this multifractal specification (Suzuki, 1984).\nIn the rest of the paper, this model based on the systematic variation of dimension\nwith area or scale will be referred to as the modified model in contrast to the\nconventional model of equations (3) and (9) where dimension is scale-invariant.\nEstimating D for the two models from the area - perimeter relations in\nequations (13) and (16) is straightforward. For each land parcel, the area and\nperimeter can be easily measured and form the dependent and independent\nvariables, respectively. The number of parcels in the study obviously affects the fit\nof the regression, and it may be necessary to identify and exclude outliers. However,\nthe variation in scale within the observations forming the data set is only influenced\nby the prior selection of land parcels, not by any peculiarity of the area-perimeter\nmeasurement.\nIn contrast, the perimeter - scale relations depend upon the choice of scale and\nthe measurement of the perimeter associated with that scale for each individual\nobject. In this case, we will form aggregate perimeters from more than one land\nparcel in the first instance. We have used four methods which enable these\nmeasurements to be made. These methods are examined in detail elsewhere\n(Longley and Batty, 1986), but they will be summarised here. The most accurate\nand time-consuming method involves traversing the perimeter of the object at\ndifferent scales by 'walking' a pair of dividers set at an appropriate scale around\nthe perimeter, thus enabling the perimeter to be derived as a function of the number\nof chords generated, Nn\n, and the divider length, Axn\n, used; that is, Pn\n= Axn\nNn\n.\nThis method was first used by Richardson (1961) to derive the log-log plots of\nperimeter versus scale, as implied by equation (15); these graphs have been\nsubsequently called 'Richardson plots' by Kaye (1978) who also refers to the\nmethod as the structured walk, Richardson used a literal, hence manual, version of\nthis method but here we are able to simulate the walk with a computer algorithm\nsimilar to that suggested by Shelby et al (1982).\nThe morphology of urban land use 467\nThe structured walk is time-consuming because it involves a trigonometric\ninterpolation between the digitised points on the perimeter, to determine the\nlocation of the start and end points of each chord which approximate the perimeter\nat the given scale. To reduce the computer time required, a second method\nsuggested by Kaye and Clark (1985), which they refer to as the equipaced polygon\nmethod, involves computing the approximation to the perimeter from chords based\non successive sequences of every second, or third, or fourth (and so on) point\ndefining the base-level perimeter. The chords at any level of aggregation are thus\nnot equal to one another, but the aggregation is very quick. It is argued that this\nmethod enables deep fissures as well as heavily digitised sections of the base-level\nperimeter to be more clearly detected than by the structured walk method, since it\ntakes account of the original digitisation of points which are rarely equally spaced.\nA third method which we call the hybrid walk method was first suggested by\nClark (1986) as a compromise between the time-consuming structured walk and the\nquicker equipaced polygon method. As in the structured walk method, a divider\nlength or scale, AJC, is fixed, but instead of interpolation of each chord onto the\noriginal base-level perimeter, the chord is fixed by approximating its end point as\nthe nearest point on the original curve.\nThe fourth and final method is based on approximating the perimeter by means\nof a grid of cells whose spacing is set at different scales over the range of scales\nadopted. At each scale, the perimeter is calculated by counting the number of\ncells which are astride the original curve, and it is thus called the cell count method\n(Goodchild, 1980). This is the only method in which scale aggregation is consistent\nover the entire area and perimeter of the object. In essence, it approximates the\noriginal curve by rasterised images at different scales, whereas the other three methods\nuse the original curve to fix the scale at different levels. The cell count method is\nthus the least accurate with respect to the resolution of the original object, but is\nthe most consistent with respect to objective scale aggregation.\nThere are three additional features characterising the use of these methods.\nFirst, with N points defining the base-level curve, the perimeter values obtained\nare not independent of their starting point. Thus, each method has been applied\nby starting at each of the N digitised points and forming an average perimeter\nvalue from the N perimeter estimates obtained. For boundaries with several\nthousand points, a method such as the structured walk can take several hours of\ncpu time on a VAX 11/780 machine if an average perimeter is required for each\nscale. As we have had sole access to such a machine for several days at a time\nthis has not constituted a problem; further details of these aspects of this kind of\nsimulation are given in Longley and Batty (1986).\nSecond, from each starting point, none of the methods will close exactly on the\nfirst and last points in the base-level curve. A fraction of the chord length will\nusually remain, and thus, in all applications, we have added these fractions to the\nperimeter values.\nThird, the range of aggregations used varies from scales which are fixed at the\naverage chord length of digitised base-level data up to the value of the maximum\nspanning distance between any separate sets of points on the original object, this\nmaximum being known as Feret's diameter (Kaye, 1978). Within this range, with a\ngiven number of aggregations to perform, the scales are determined in geometric\nprogression so that they will be equally spaced with respect to the logarithmic\nregression.\nApplications to urban land use: the area-perimeter relations\nSwindon, Wiltshire, the town chosen for analysis, is located in south central\nEngland about 70 miles west of London. The town is quite compact and not\naffected in its form by any rapidly growing nearby towns. It has a reasonably\nbuoyant economy which in the 1960s was a result of its designation as an expanded\ntown, taking overspill population from Greater London. More recently, its\nfavoured location in a rapidly expanding area of southern England has led to the\nlocation of new service and high-technology industries in and around the town\nitself. Figure 1 shows land use in the town in 1981. It is clear that, as the town\nhas grown, it has absorbed villages in its immediate periphery. Figure 1 was\ncompiled as a fairly aggregated land-use map from diverse data sources: remotely\nsensed data and local authority map records used by Rickaby (1987) as part of his\nstudies into the energy requirements of small towns.\nThe five land uses--residential, commercial - industrial, educational, transport,\nand open space--shown in figure 1 constitute the basic data for this study. The\nmap was digitised with the Map Manager software (Bracken et al, 1987) and the\nland parcels were extracted in polygon form by means of conventional digital\ncartographic techniques in software developed by the authors. Figure 2 shows the\npolygons which constitute the land parcels; they are drawn to scale and classified\naccording to the five land uses, but they are not arranged in any particular order.\nWhen one observes how these parcels fit together to form the overall map, the\nconundrum raised earlier relating to contiguous boundaries between different uses\nis immediately apparent. For example, the largest land parcel of all is part of the\nset of residential land uses shown in figure 2. In one sense, this parcel can be\nconsidered as the skeleton of the entire town, but it is clear that about half its\nThe morphology of urban land use \u00b7 * 469\nboundary is common with other land uses; this raises the conceptual difficulty of\nmaking comparisons of the irregularity and form of this boundary with that of\nadjacent land uses. For the moment, we will assume that the different parcels can\nbe treated separately, and we will pursue the estimation in this manner before\ncommenting further on the problem later in this paper.\nSome characteristics of the digital representation of the five land uses are\npresented in table 1. There is considerable variation in the set of land uses and it\nis clear that no generalisations can be made about educational land use which\ncomprises only three parcels; and there are limits to how far one can make\ninferences about the transport land use which comprises only six parcels. However,\nan examination of the average chord length of these data, which ranges from\nindependent of land-use type. The number of digitised points given in table 1 for\neach land use and for the total involves the double counting of common boundaries\nreferred to above, in that the points which are common to any pair of land uses\nare included in each land use.\nOf the 6059 points which constitute the total number of points in each of the\ndistinct land uses, there are only 2335 points which are not common to adjacent\nland-use boundaries. The remaining 3724 points which are common to various\npairs of land uses are in fact counted twice (for each land use in each pair) and\nthus there are 1862 points which are common in the data set. In total, there are\n4197 distinct points in the set, 43% of these being common to adjacent land uses.\nIn terms of the individual uses, 51% of the points defining the residential parcels are\ncommon to other uses, whereas over 90% of the points referring to open space are\npart of the boundaries of other land uses. These percentages, shown in table 1,\ngive some indication of the position of the land uses within the town. For example,\nResidential\nCommercial - industrial\nj?^\nEducational\nTransport\nOpen space\nFigure 2. Land parcels separated into distinct land uses.\nmost of the open space is enclosed within the town itself, not on its edge, whereas\neducational land use is mainly on the town's edge. In table 1, the perimeter length\nrefers to the sum of all the perimeters relating to a given land use and the Feret\ndiameter represents the maximum spanning distance found amongst the parcels of\nany given land use. It is clear from this and from figure 2 that there is some\nconsiderable variation among land-use parcels with respect to size.\nWe are now in a position to estimate the first set of fractal dimensions based on\nthe area - perimeter relation. In figure 3, the log-log plots of perimeter against\narea are presented as scatter diagrams for each of the five sets of land uses in\nturn, and then for all five land uses making up the seventy-two land parcels in the\ntown. These plots demonstrate strong relationships between perimeter and area,\nand it is difficult to detect any significant nonlinearity in their form. To these data\nwe have fitted the conventional model based on using equation (3) in equation (13),\nwhich we can restate as\nl n P = l n ^ + i D l n A , (18)\nand the modified model given earlier in equation (16), which we will also repeat\nfor convenience as\nInP = Infc + ^clnA+^dA^lnA (19)\nNote that we now distinguish the intercept terms in equations (18) and (19) as <f>x\n, respectively.\nThe results of these regressions are presented in table 2. With the exception of\neducational land use where there are only three observations, the adjusted R2\n(correlation) statistics for both sets of models are acceptable. There are no obvious\noutliers, for example, whose removal might improve these statistics. The modified\nmodel gives a slight improvement over the conventional one, but this is not\nsignificant. The fractal dimensions in the conventional model are as postulated,\nthat is, 1 < D < 2, with the exception of the educational land use which we must\nexclude from serious analysis. Interpretations of the parameter c in the modified\nmodel are problematic because of the size of d. As d -+ 0, it is hypothesised that\nc -\u00bb D, but none of these results show any meaning in these terms in contrast to\nsome previous work of the authors (Batty and Longley, 1987b). The conventional\nmodel is the only one acceptable here and excluding education, the analysis suggests\nthat the commercial-industrial {D ~ 1.47) and transport land uses (D ~ 1.44) have\nmore tortuous boundaries than those of residential (D ~ 1.33) and open space\n(D ~ 1.24). The dimension associated with all the land uses (D ~ 1.29) is clearly\nan average. All these results are consistent with other estimates from aerial data\nTable 1.

In examining the five land uses, we might\nargue that open space is more likely to be defined according to the boundaries\nimposed by natural terrain, in contrast to more artificially determined land uses\nsuch as the commercial-industrial and transport uses. Residential land use is\nlikely to have a degree of irregularity in its form somewhere between these\nextremes, as might educational use. With respect to the area - perimeter relations,\nthis a priori ranking of open space, residential, educational, commercial-industrial,\ntransport is not borne out at all by the fractal dimensions. Indeed, table 2 implies\nsomewhat the reverse, but the Rh are lower than anticipated and it is possible that\narea-perimeter relations do not capture scale effects to the same precision as\nmethods based on perimeter-scale relations.\nHowever, to be consistent with the area-perimeter analysis, it is necessary to\ndevise a way of determining single fractal dimensions for each set of land parcels\naccording to land-use types. In a later section, we will look at the variation in\nfractal dimension across land parcels and types, but here we will begin by defining\na global (or total) perimeter for each land-use set. Were we simply to calculate a\nsingle total perimeter for each land use based on all its parcels, and regress these\nagainst scale, this would be similar to our previous analysis as scale would be a\nproxy for area. What we have done in fact is to calculate a total perimeter for\neach land use by stringing together the individual land-parcel perimeters in the\narbitrary order in which the parcels and their coordinate points have been digitised.\nWe have also derived a total of total perimeters in the same way which contains all\nthe points relevant to each land parcel over all land uses.\nIn figure 4, we show these total perimeters for each of the five land uses. These\nare not drawn to the common scales of the parcels contained in figures 1 and 2,\nbut are scaled up or down to be roughly comparable in area when displayed on a\ngraphics terminal. It should be quite straightforward to identify the land parcels\nfrom their classification in figure 2. The total perimeters are in fact derived by\ncentring the first digitised point of each land parcel on a common point and\nproducing a string of coordinates in the order in which each land use was digitised.\nThe educational and transport land uses with the fewest land parcels show this\nmost clearly in figure 4. We have not included the total of total perimeters because\nit is not possible to produce a clear and clean plot as a result of the continual over-\nlapping of boundaries; we will, however, use this total in the subsequent analysis.\nThe morphology of urban land use 473\nFrom these base-level perimeters, aggregations across the given range of scales\nyielding approximate perimeters provide the data for estimating the parameters of\nthe perimeter - scale relation. Two issues are important. First, the order and\norientation of the land parcels forming the total perimeter could be crucial, and\nsecond the aggregations should not be so great as to pick up the aggregate shape\nof these composite perimeters which is clearly quite arbitrary. Order and orientation\nhave been varied and this makes little difference to the subsequent results, but the\nFigure 4. Aggregate perimeters for the five land uses.\naggregate shape problem does affect the estimated dimensions. In fact, this leads\nto a reestimation of the perimeter - scale relations with a reduced set of aggregations\nwhich will be reported in the next section.\nThe number and scale of the aggregations for each of these perimeters, which\nprovide the set of observations for the log-log regressions, are fixed so that each\nobservation is of equal weight in the estimation. The limits of aggregation for the\nstructured walk, hybrid walk, and cell count methods are first calculated as follows.\nThe maximum spanning distance or Feret diameter, F, is computed from\nF = max{4,} , where ]\ndtj\n= [(x-x^ + iy-yjfr2 ; J\ndtj\nis the distance between two distinct points referred to as / and j in the base-\nlevel TV-coordinate data set which defines the total perimeter from the coordinate\npairs xt\nyt\n(i = 1, ..., N). The average chord length, d, in this data set is given as\n*-?&\u00b7 <2i\u00bb\nwhere there are N-- 1 chords making up the base-level perimeter.\nThe sequence of aggregations where d represents the first chord size and F\nrepresents the last, and where m is the number of aggregations, is given by\nIn fact, the starting point is set as the minimum, not average, chord size, and this\ncan be represented as a fraction, JLL, of d. Therefore, equation (22) becomes\nThe weight a scales one chord size to the next in the sequence of aggregations\nand this is computed from equations (22) or (23) as\nThis method of aggregating perimeters can only be applied to the structured walk,\nhybrid walk, and cell count methods of approximation, for the equipaced polygon\nmethod does not involve distances between points, only the order of points in the\nbase-level data set.\nA similar method of weighting is used, however, involving numbers of base-level\nchords, not length based on distances. As the number of base-level chords used to\nform a new chord increases, the actual length of the new chord increases and this\nis akin to aggregation to larger distance scales. Then, if the number of original\npoints needed to approximate the coarsest acceptable perimeter is Nm3LX\nand the\nminimum number Nmin\n, the sequence of chord sizes in the sequence of aggregations\nis given as\nM = a\niymax ** iymin > \\^uI\nfrom which a is determined in the same way as previously; that is, as\n(lnJVmax\n-lnJVmin\n^ . *\n\\ m-\\ J\nIn fact, Nmin\nis always 2, and iVmax\nis set as N/6, thus implying that the number of\nchords defining the most aggregate perimeter is 6; this would make the top level of\nThe morphology of urban land use 475\nThe algorithm used to aggregate the original chords on each iteration into new\nperimeters uses a in equation (26) only as a guide. Clearly the number of chords\nmust be integral, not real, thus equation (25) involves truncation or addition to\ncreate integer numbers. The number of aggregated chords on each iteration n+1\nis given as Nn+1\n= int{aNn\n). However, if Nn+1\nis equal to Nn\n, then Nn+1\nis increased\nby one chord length, that is Nn+1\n= Nn\n+ 1. In the application of these algorithms,\nwe have set m as 100 in each case. In fact, for the equipaced polygon method,\nalthough this also applies, the actual number of aggregations made is always less\nthan 100 because of the discrete conditional nature of the aggregation.\nResidential\nV ^\nV *\nCommercial - industrial\n* \\\n-i i r\" r\nEducational Transport\nX ,\n\"**\u00bb*\u00b7\nOpen space\n\u00b7 * * * \u00ab * \u00b7 *\nV\nV\nAll land uses\n\" H ^\n+A\nLog scale (InA*)\nLog scale (InA*)\nFigure 5.

These are seen as departures from the trend of each graph and as obvious\ntwists and turns in the tails of some of the plots. Second, these plots show strong\nevidence of nonlinearity suggesting, as in previous work (Batty and Longley, 1987b;\nOrford and Whalley, 1983), that the modified model, where fractal dimension varies\nwith scale, is more applicable than the conventional model.

Last, the\naggregation, in the case of educational land use, over 100 levels is problematic in\nthat there are only 109 digitised points in the total perimeter set as shown in table 1.\nWe will present the fractal dimensions derived from the conventional and modified\nmodels for all the plots shown in figures 5-8, notwithstanding the fact that the\nequipaced polygon method and educational land use are, in the sense just described,\nlikely to yield unreliable results.

In table 4, we show the\nsame for the modified model as given in equation (17)., In this table, we first give the\nfractal dimension D derived from the coefficient a as 1 - a, and then we give the\ndispersion coefficient, b, noting of course that as b ~* 0, D ~* 1 -- a.\nIt is immediately clear from tables 3 and 4 that the modified model in which\ndimension is a function of scale gives by far the best performance over all methods\nand land uses. Yet the equipaced polygon and hybrid walk methods produce\nstrange results for the modified model, in that fractal dimensions are less than 1 in\nfour cases. In the case of the conventional model, these methods also appear to\ngive D values higher than anticipated.

Richardson plots of perimeter-scale with the cell count method.\nThe morphology of urban land use 479\nfrom table 3, there is, however, a fairly consistent order over all methods in which\nopen space, all land uses, and commercial - industrial have higher fractal dimensions\nthan residential, which in turn is higher than educational and transport.\nA more disordered set of ranks is associated with the modified model, although\nthere are some similarities with the conventional model results, and in any case,\nthe dispersion coefficients pick up the nonlinearity in the relations and hence\ninfluence the value of D. In this respect, the dispersion coefficients are quite low\nfor most land uses. To summarise, then, if the equipaced polygon and hybrid\nmethods which seem to pick up inappropriate larger scale effects, are ignored, the\nstructured walk and cell count methods produce a ranking of fractal dimensions\nacross all land uses (with the exception of educational) according to our a priori\nexpectations. At this stage, it is even possible to say that variations in dimension\nand coefficients between land uses are clearly wider than between methods, and\nthis implies that the choice of method is less significant than the division into\nstandard types of land use.\nTable 3.

It is quite clear from figures 5-8 that we\nmust remove the highest aggregations from all these plots. In doing so, we also\nimmediately remove some of the nonlinearity from the data, thus hopefully\nimproving the conventional model estimates as well as resolving some of the\nanomalous dimensions evident in tables 3 and 4.\nReestimation of the perimeter-scale relations\nThe range of aggregations with respect to the structured walk, cell count, and\nhybrid walk methods as given in equations (23) and (24) begins with the first and\nlast chord lengths set as low as 70% of the average distance, d, and Feret\ndiameter, F, for residential land use, to as high as 99% of d and F for the\neducational land use. Shelby et al (1982) recommend that the starting points\nshould be no lower than \\d and Kaye (1978) recommends the end point be no\nhigher than \\F. The lower limits (jud) we have used do not pose any problem, but\nthe upper limits {juF) yield approximations to the total perimeter with as few as\ntwo chords and only as many as five chords. An approximation to the boundary\nof any irregular object can never be made in less than six chords and in the case\nwhere we have up to thirty land parcels forming an aggregated perimeter, it could\nbe argued that we should never go below 180 chords. Below this level we\nunwittingly include scale effects which pick up the arbitrariness of the 'constructed'\nperimeters; these are also sensitive to order and orientation of the land-parcel\nstrings. In terms of this argument, it would appear that we should take an upper\nlimit no greater than 20% of Feret's diameter, that is ju = 0.2.\nFrom an examination of figures 5-8, it is quite straightforward to determine\ncutoff limits at the upper tails of each plot which would remove those observations\nclearly sensitive to these unwarranted scale effects. We have defined these cutoff\nlimits in these figures, showing the number of observations each set has been\nreduced to. This varies for the structured walk methods from 9% to 22% of the\noriginal set to as little as between 5% and 10% in the case of the equipaced\npolygon methods. From figures 5-8, it is clear that we could impose even harsher\nconstraints on the observations used, but, although this would probably improve\nthe results still further, relevant scale effects would probably be removed too.\nTables 5 and 6 show the reestimations of the two models using the four methods\napplied to each land use and the total of all land uses. There are marginal\nincreases in the performance of the conventional model as comparisons between\nTable 5.

There is increased consistency between the methods with\nrespect to the dimensions estimated, with the exception of the equipaced polygon\nmethod. This is the most volatile of all the methods, with the structured walk\nbeing the most consistent in terms of the original estimation and the reestimation.\nWith respect to the ranking of land uses by dimension, an even clearer pattern\nemerges. Those with the higher fractal dimensions are open space and all land\nuses, then commercial - industrial and residential, with much lower dimensions for\neducational and transport uses. This bears out the a priori analysis even more\nstrongly, but it must be noted that the performance of the conventional model is\nonly just adequate.\nThe modified model results shown in table 6 are even better than those of\ntable 4. The ranking pattern is more variable than that of the conventional model\nwith the commercial-industrial, educational, and open space land uses having the\nhighest degree of nonlinearity as measured by the dispersion coefficient. The equi-\npaced polygon method somewhat ironically perhaps, has by no means the worst\nperformance, but it still generates coefficients out of line with the other methods.\nAs with the conventional model, the structured walk provides the most consistent\nresults over each land use, and together with the cell count method gives the best\nperformance.\nIt is now worth summarising all these results with respect to the fractal dimensions\nproduced. In figure 9, an attempt is made to capture the variations in dimension\nobtained across all methods and land uses in a single diagram. Each of the\ndiagrams shows this variation with respect to the area-perimeter, conventional\nperimeter-scale, and modified perimeter - scale methods, the last two being shown\nwith respect to their original estimation and reestimation. It is quite clear from\nthese plots that the equipaced polygon method is the most problematic and should\nbe excluded. Yet the structure of these results does show that there are greater\ndifferences between land uses than between methods, and this bears out the\noriginal hypothesis that such differences can be detected and possibly explained\nwith respect to the processes governing the formation and evolution of different\nland-use activities. We will say more about this in our conclusion, but before we\nexplore the variations between land parcels, we have averaged the dimensions\nproduced in the last three sections, and these are shown, together with those of the\nsubsequent section, in table 7.\nTable 6.

Variations in fractal dimensions with respect to models, methods, and land uses.\nThe morphology of urban land use 483\nIt is clear that the area-perimeter method produces quite different results from\nthe perimeter - scale methods, but that the patterns produced by the perimeter -\nscale methods are more robust and consistent with our a priori theorising. For the\nconventional model, the fractal dimensions vary from D ~ 1.55 for open space and\nall land uses to D - 1 . 4 5 for residential and commercial - industrial to D ~ 1.30\nfor educational and transport. With respect to the modified model D ~ 1.25 (in its\nlimit) for open space, all land use, and residential, whereas for the other three land\nuses, 1.00 < D < 1.10. This implies that these last three land uses present greater\nnonlinearity; that is, their fractal dimensions vary more strongly with scale. These\nresults mask the wide variation in dimension between land-use parcels within any\nland-use type, and do not in any way address the equality of fractal dimension\nover common boundaries between different land uses. We will address some of\nthese questions in the next section.\nTable 7.

There are eight such\ninner boundaries, all relating to residential land use as shown in figure 2, and in the\nsubsequent analysis they are treated as separate land parcels, thus augmenting the\nnumber of parcels treated to eighty. First, all four aggregation methods--the\nstructured and hybrid walks, the equipaced polygon, and the cell count methods-\nwere applied to each of the eighty parcels, with the number of aggregations structured\nin geometric form as implied by equations (21)-(25) but with a fixed and m\nvaried accordingly.\nIn the case of the equipaced polygon method, the aggregation of sixteen perimeters\nout of the eighty possible yielded too few observations for any subsequent regression.\nThe other methods produced Richardson plots that were generally more linear than\nthose shown in figures 5-8 and therefore it was decided to fit the conventional\nmodel to all sets of observations generated. The R2-values ranged from 83.3% to\n99.9% in the case of applying the equipaced polygon method, but it was the\nstructured walk that produced the most consistent plots in contrast to the hybrid\nand cell count methods which were more volatile across the land parcels. Some\nmethods produced dimensions for individual land parcels outside the range\n1 < D < 2.

In fact, the emphasis in this section is on the variation between land\nparcels, not on the variation between methods, hence the choice of the most robust\nmethod to generate the perimeter - scale observations.\nThe application both of the conventional and of modified models is shown in\nfigure 10 with respect to their fractal dimensions and associated #2-statistics. The\nresults for each land parcel are shown in the arbitrary order of figure 2 according\nto the way the parcels were digitised but ordered within land-use types as given\npreviously. All fractal dimensions for the conventional model are in the postulated\nrange from 1 < D < 2. For the largest land parcels, the dimensions appear higher\nthan for the rest but a regression of the number of digitised points of all parcels\non their conventional model dimensions yields an i?2-value of only 15.6%. With\nrespect to the five sets of land uses, these Revalues were more variable, rising to\n68.6% in the case of commercial - industrial. But in general, there does not appear\nto be a strong bias to higher dimensions for those land-use parcels with the highest\nnumber of perimeter coordinates. Figure 10 also shows that the parameters of the\nmodified nonlinear model are consistent with the range of 1 < D < 2, and the\nlevel of dispersion reflecting the nonlinearity of each parcel over scale, is fairly\nmodest in every case.\nOne way of summarising these parameters and statistics is by computing means\nand standard deviations. Table 8 presents these results for both models. The\nparameters and dimensions in this table are in their original form as predicted\nfrom the application of equations (15) and (17), that is, the coefficient of the\nconventional model is a, a = g(D) = 1 -- D, and the coefficients for the modified\nmodel are a and b, where a -* (1 -- D) as b --> 0 {b is the dispersion parameter).\nTable 8 presents the variation in size of the land parcels for each land use and\nover the whole set in terms of their mean number of coordinates. The distribution\nof these coordinates with respect to the number of land parcels is skewed, with a\nmuch greater proportion of parcels below their mean size. In the case of the\nresidential parcels, this distribution is highly skewed, largely because of the\nexistence of the one large parcel which provides the skeletal structure of the town.\nThe variation in parameters and performance of the models, however, is much\nless than the variation in the features of the land parcels themselves. Figure 10\nmakes this apparent, and these results are averaged for each land use over all\nparcels in table 8. With respect to the conventional model, the /?2-values only\nrange from 93.4% in the case of residential parcels down to 91.9% for transport\nand the range with each land use over the land parcels is also quite narrow. The\nfractal dimensions D also show a pattern over the land uses which is consistent\nwith the aggregated perimeter - scale results but is considerably clearer. The ranking\nof land uses from largest to smallest D is ordered from residential {D ~ 1.15),\n(1.09) with an average over all land uses of 1.13. These values are considerably\nsmaller than those shown previously, yet they are more in line with previous work\nfigure 2) is just one of five parcels which has a dimension greater than 1.20. From\nthese results it is quite clear that the much higher dimensions produced by the\naggregated perimeter - scale relations are caused by the method of aggregating\nindividual perimeters into strings of coordinates. It would appear that the aggregation\npicks up arbitrary scale effects which are central to the method itself and not the\norder or orientation of the individual parcels in the process of forming these\ncomposite perimeters.\nThe modified model results also shown in table 8 have a wider range of variation\naround their mean estimates than those of the conventional model. In terms of the\nTable 8.

The\nvalues of the dispersion factors show this order and the i?2-estimates, although\nslightly better than those of the conventional model, are not as high as those\nproduced by the aggregate perimeter - scale relations. Nevertheless, the nonlinear\nmodel is an improvement over the linear and, in general, these results for the\nindividual parcels are better than originally anticipated.\nConclusions\nThe analysis presented here is generally inconclusive. At most, it would appear\nthat residential and open space land uses have a greater degree of irregularity than\ncommercial-industrial, educational, and transport. There is a logic here which we\nspelt out before we began the analysis in that, for land uses which are larger in\nscale, there is likely to be less effort put into the geometric control of land under\ndevelopment. Yet there remains considerable uncertainty over the processes in\noperation. We have, however, shown that, in general, scale effects vary with scale\nitself, and this is likely to be the result of multiple processes changing their relative\nimportance through the range of scales. This argument was spelt out by Batty and\nLongley (1987b) and is further confirmed here.\nWe have added to table 7 the results of the last section where the whole range\nof models and methods applied throughout this paper are displayed in suitably\n'averaged' form. This shows up the arbitrariness of the analysis, with open space\nD ~ 1.15 for the linear conventional model. In previous work, the methods them-\nselves have been subject to considerable variation, but here despite some mild\nassociation of dimension values with land uses, the main variation concerns the\nway area, perimeter, and scale are defined and the type of approach or method\ntaken.\nQuestions of scale are never very clear in much fractal analysis, despite the fact\nthat fractals are defined by scale-invariance. In the area-perimeter method it is\nassumed that objects of varying sizes show the effects of varying scale itself\n(Woronow, 1981). In short, a small residential development will not pick up the\naggregate scale effects which can be detected by a large-scale development; so\nThe morphology of urban land use 487\nTable 8 (continued).\noDi\nb ob\nruns the logic. However, this will depend on the base level of resolution in the\nfirst place and there is seldom much discussion of this in the literature. The\nmethod of aggregating perimeters used in the composite perimeter-scale analyses\nof land uses, is also suspect because of arbitrary scale effects which can be produced,\ndespite careful control over the process of aggregation. Last the individual land-\nparcel analysis using conventional perimeter - scale, not aggregated relations, suffers\nfrom its very inability to aggregate parcels, other than by arbitrary statistics such as\nsimple averages.\nWhat is clearly required in future work is a close examination of these approaches\nin terms of scale effects. We have paid great attention to problems of denning\nscale limits and ranges here, but on reflection, our analysis should have reduced\nthe range of scales much further. New methods are required which are more\nrobust than those used here, and we should now accept that in the perimeter - scale\nanalysis, the hybrid walk and equipaced polygon methods should be abandoned in\nfavour of methods such as the structured walk and cell count methods whose\nproperties of aggregation are better understood.\nThe final conclusion we will draw relates to more substantive questions. Although\nwe have tackled individual and aggregate analysis here, much finer analysis of the\nfractal dimension of parts of perimeter boundaries is required. With k land uses,\nthere are \\k(k+l) possible pairwise boundaries to examine separately. Better\nclassification of the fractal shapes of land parcels will not emerge until the\ncommon boundary problem is directly broached. This must involve a detailed\nexamination of how such boundaries are formed and how they evolve over time.\nBy explaining the development process, more satisfactory explanations can be given\nof the way land uses 'stick' to each other to form the whole town. Only by\nextending the analysis along these lines can conclusive results about the ways in\nwhich urban morphologies are structured and evolve, be demonstrated.\nReferences\nAviles C A, Scholz C H, Boatwright J, 1987, \"Fractal analysis applied to characteristic\nBatty M, Longley P A, 1987a, \"Fractal-based description of urban form\" Environment and\nBracken I, Holdstock S, Martin D, 1987, \"MapManager: intelligent software for the display\nof spatial information\", Report 3, Wales and South West Regional Research Laboratory,\nUniversity of Wales at Cardiff, Cardiff\nClark N N, 1986, \"Three techniques for implementing digital fractal analysis of particle\nGoodchild M F, 1980, \"Fractals and the accuracy of geographical measures\" Mathematical\nGoodchild M F, Mark D M, 1987, \"The fractal nature of geographic phenomena\" Annals of\nGould S J, 1966, \"Allometry and size in ontogeny and phylogeny\" Biological Review 41\nKaproff J, 1986, \"The geometry of coastlines: a study in fractals\", in Computers and\nMathematics with Applications 12B 651-671; also reprinted in Symmetry: Unifying Human\nUnderstanding Ed.
