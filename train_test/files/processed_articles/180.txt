    "reduced_content": "Double Jeopardy, Aging as Leveler,\nor Persistent Health Inequality?\n \n \n \nLongitudinal datafrom a 15-year national survey of adults are used to test the doublejeopardy to health hypothesis as\nwell as the alternative hypotheses that aging levels ethnic differences and that health inequalities persist across the life\ncourse. Findings show that African Americans began the study in poorer health and manifested higher mortality.\nAmong survivors, young and middle-aged Black adults developed more serious illness and their subjective health\ndeclined more rapidly than their White counterparts during thefirst 10 years of the study. Among subjects with heart\nfailure, Blackpeople were also more likely than Whites to become more disabled over time. Depending upon the health\nmeasure considered and the analytic strategy applied, there was evidencefor all three processes, but the weight of the\nevidence shows persistent health inequality over the life course. Indeed, evidence for the age-as-leveler thesis was\neliminated by accountingfor mortality during the study.\nA MAJOR initiative of research on health among minority\n\u00b7**\u00b7 elders has been an examination of the double jeopardy\nResearchers have sought to determine if being both old and a\nmember of a minority creates a double disadvantage to the\nhealth of people in this subpopulation. As originally formu-\nlated, racial discrimination throughout one's life and age\ndiscrimination in later life may have combined negative\neffects on health status and perhaps the procurement of\nhealth resources available to others (i.e., White, younger\npeople). There is substantial evidence that Black persons\ngenerally suffer more health problems (Livingston, 1994;\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991;\nWolinsky et al., 1989). According to the double jeopardy\nhypothesis, however, one needs to demonstrate that the\nhealth differential between adult Whites and Blacks in-\ncreases with age.\nDespite the popularity of the concept in American society\nand its extension to the triple jeopardy involving the com-\nbined effects of social disadvantage by race, age, and\ngender, empirical tests of the hypothesis as it pertains to\nhealth have been fairly limited. The most serious limitation\nis that most previous research has used a cross-sectional\ndesign. Yet, if age changes are to be traced, cross-sectional\ndata are not optimal for testing the hypothesis (Dowd and\nThe primary purpose of this research is to use a nationally\nrepresentative longitudinal survey to determine if the health\ndisadvantage experienced by young and middle-aged Black\nAmericans increases, decreases, or stays about the same in\nthe later years. While this study examines Black/White\ndifferences in health, the findings may also be useful for\nstudies of other minority groups and to inform policy\ndiscussions regarding health care services (Cornelius,\nReview of Literature\nSocial scientists have long been interested in the origins\nand consequences of racial and ethnic discrimination. The\ndouble jeopardy hypothesis focuses on how discrimination\nuniquely affects persons of color as they reach older ages.\nAccording to Feagin (1991), \"Particular instances of dis-\ncrimination may seem minor to outside white observers\nwhen considered in isolation. But when blatant acts of\navoidance, verbal harassment, and physical attack combine\nwith subtle and covert slights, and these accumulate over\nmonths, years, and lifetimes, the impact on a black person is\nfar more than the sum of individual instances\" (pp. 114--\nare not simply psychological or economic; he argues that\nracism should be considered as having \"a critical impact on\nhealth and mortality within the United States\" (p. 113).\nDouble jeopardy has generally been conceptualized as\noccurring when minority persons are faced with a double\nburden of racial and age discrimination or \"multiple haz-\nactuality, this is one of three possible scenarios discussed in\nthe literature. The second is the possibility of age acting as a\nleveler of Black/White health differences. The double jeop-\nardy hypothesis posits additional disadvantage from growing\nolder, but Dowd and Bengtson drew from the work of Kent\n(1971) to alternatively hypothesize that minorities may be\nbetter off in older ages. This may occur because (a) aging\nbrings such basic challenges to health and functional ability\nthat racial inequality is not as important and/or (b) minority\npersons adopt coping strategies throughout the life course to\ndeal with racial discrimination, and these may help in deal-\ning with age discrimination. Dowd and Bengtson's (1978,\n1981) research provided evidence for the double jeopardy to\nhealth for both African and Mexican Americans in compari-\nson to White Americans, and other studies have registered\nsome support as well on health (e.g., Jackson, Kolody, and\nWood, 1982) and institutionalization (e.g., Belgrave,\nAnother set of studies tested the double jeopardy hypothe-\nsis but led to the third scenario in considering how age and\nrace are related to health: persistent inequality (stability of\nethnic differences). Evidence for persistent health inequality\nbetween Black and White persons comes from cross-\nWard, 1983) and two longitudinal ones (Clark and Maddox,\nimportant health disadvantage of African Americans being\nsimilar across the life span. Age neither levels the differ-\nence, nor exacerbates it.\nBesides the obvious preponderance of cross-sectional\nanalysis used to test a hypothesis on aging, another key\nlimitation of the extant literature is the failure to consider\nselective mortality. Indeed, the question of differential mor-\ntality is critical to the considerations of what is meant by\ndouble jeopardy. Recognizing minority differences in life\nexpectancy, a sample from a cross-sectional analysis yields\ncomparisons among representatives of different populations\nfor Black and White Americans. Because Black life expec-\ntancy is generally lower (and not keeping pace with White\ngains in recent years; Kochanek, Maurer, and Rosenberg,\n1994), the proportion of Black adults surviving into older\nages is much smaller. In other words, the differences in life\nexpectancy between the two groups would decrease the\nlikelihood of revealing the operation of a double jeopardy\nthesis in cross-sectional data. A longitudinal study of double\njeopardy, on the other hand -- especially a long-term one --\ncan account for mortality differences so as to determine if the\nrate of intraindividual change is different for Black adults.\nPerhaps this is why Markides, Timbers, and Osberg (1984)\nclaimed, \"Long-term longitudinal designs that allow for the\nimpact of dropouts will be necessary to test more adequately\nthe double jeopardy hypothesis\" (p. 47).\nThere appears to be little debate as to whether Black\npersons generally have poorer health. The inconsistency in\nfindings derives from whether these differences amplify,\nattenuate, or remain the same in the later years. Two\nquestions must be answered affirmatively in order to provide\nevidence on these three alternatives: (1) Does the minority\ngroup have poorer health than the White majority? (2) Are\nthe declines experienced by the minority group in later life\ngreater than, less than, or about the same as those experi-\nenced by the White majority? Accordingly, these two ques-\ntions correspond to two statistical tests: the first corresponds\nto the main effect for the ethnic group studied, and the\nsecond corresponds to the interaction of ethnicity and age\nacross the adult years.\nMETHOD\nSample\nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey-I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) are used\nfor Health Statistics, 1987). The study traced respondents of\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I\nlimited both in terms of variables assessed and number of\ncases interviewed and seems to add little to the present\ninvestigation. Therefore, data from the baseline survey and\ninvestigation. For the purpose of this study, references to\nwaves one (Wl), two (W2), and three (W3) will refer to the\nThe sampling design for the baseline survey was a multi-\nstage, stratified, probability sample of persons ages 25-74\n(see National Center for Health Statistics [1987] for details).\nThe analyses will be completed on the NHANES I subsam-\nple, which was administered the \"detailed component\"\nincluding the Health Care Needs Questionnaire (N =\n6,913). The percent of cases at baseline receiving the de-\ntailed component and traced through follow-ups is very good\nexcellent representation of the U.S. noninstitutionalized\npopulation within this age range, and provides adequate\nstatistical power for this analysis.\nVital status was determined for all traced respondents in\nthe baseline survey. In-depth interviews were conducted\nwith surviving participants, including those placed in nurs-\ning homes, and brief interviews were conducted with prox-\nies for those who were deceased or incapacitated between\nwaves. Date of death was obtained for 1,337 decedents.\nTherefore, event history analyses were performed to model\nattrition due to mortality and will be discussed in detail\nbelow. In addition, logistic regression analyses were used\nto examine Black/White differences in other forms of attri-\ntion. A total of 284 of the baseline subjects refused partici-\npation by W3, and 453 respondents were not available\n(e.g., not traced, out of the country). Results from the\nlogistic regression analyses reveal that Black subjects were\nnot more likely to either refuse participation in or be\nunavailable for the follow-up surveys.\nMeasurement\nTable 1 presents means and standard deviations for all\nvariables used in the analyses. The measures of health status\ncover indicators which are more objective indicators of\nmorbidity as well as the widely used \"self-rating of health,\"\noften referred to as subjective health. As such, they represent\na broader array of variables than what has been used in most\nprevious studies of the subject. Some measures are available\nfor all three waves; others are only available at two.\nThe measures of chronic and serious illnesses are counts\nof the conditions that each respondent identified. Respon-\ndents were asked a series of questions for selected condi-\ntions; for example: \"Did a doctor ever tell you that you had\nhypertension or high blood pressure?\" Dummy variables for\neach condition were constructed (0, 1) and these were\nsummed. Serious or life-threatening illnesses were cancer,\ndiabetes, heart failure (attack or trouble), hypertension, and\nstroke; chronic conditions include arthritis, cataracts, hip\nfracture, and kidney disorder. Adding the illnesses together\nis widespread in measuring morbidity (Gibson, 1991b;\nTable 1.

N varies due to missing data. The standard deviation for each binary\nvariable is omitted. Significance tests were for chi-square on binary variables and /-tests on ordinal or interval variables.\n\"Covariates measured at baseline; revised as appropriate for analyses of change between times 2 and 3.\nLiang et al., 1991). At the same time, adding serious and\nchronic conditions separately captures a fundamental dis-\ntinction between the illnesses without resorting to a large\nnumber of dummy variables to represent each illness. For\nselected analyses, however, dummy variables for each ill-\nness will be used (e.g., Idler and Kasl, 1991).\nIdentical measures of functional health were not available\nat all waves. At Wl, restricted activity was used as a basic\nmeasure of functional impairment and is coded 1 = quite\ninactive, 0 = otherwise. It is the sum of two questions on\nrecreational and nonrecreational exercise. For W2 and W3,\nthe Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Dis-\nability Index is used in revised form (Foley et al., 1990). The\noriginal index included 26 items but a few items were either\ndeleted or modified in the 1987 interview; the index used\nhere is based on 21 items. Missing data on the index were\nrecoded to the mean if the number of items across which a\ncase was missing data was less than six (Hertel, 1976;\nRubin, 1987). If respondents missed more than six items,\nthey were treated as missing on the index (Little and Rubin,\nSubjective health was measured with the question,\n' 'Would you say that your health in general is excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor?\" (Ranging from 1, poor, to 5,\nexcellent).\nTable 1 also presents the means and standard deviations\nfor the predictor variables used in the final analysis. (A\nnumber of additional variables were considered in prelimi-\nnary analyses but deleted because they did not significantly\naffect the results presented below.) The variables span a\nbroad range of factors known to be related to health, either\ndirectly or indirectly (Mutchler and Burr, 1991). The mea-\nsurement of most is relatively straightforward. Two different\ncoding schemes for education were used in preliminary\nanalyses, one with 18 categories reflecting years of school-\ning attended and one with eight categories reflecting socially\nrecognized achievement patterns for these cohorts (e.g.,\ncompleted high school). Preliminary results using the two\ncoding strategies for education were virtually identical, and\nthe latter was chosen because its distribution is less skewed.\nRespondents with Medicaid or private health insurance were\ndistinguished with binary variables. Obesity is defined ac-\ncording to the Centers for Disease Control's norms: body\nmass index equal to or greater than 27.8 for men and 27.3 for\nwomen (American Public Health Association, 1992). Smok-\ning was based on self-report of consumption of cigarettes,\ncigars, and pipe tobacco at the time of the interview and\nduring one's lifetime. All predictor variables are measured at\nthe baseline; some are available at follow-ups. When\nchanges occur (e.g., income), they were incorporated in the\nanalysis.\nRESULTS\nTo begin, means and standard deviations for the health\nvariables are shown in Table 1, and tests were conducted to\nassess between-group differences. At baseline, Black sub-\njects manifest a health disadvantage on all the indicators,\nfrom chronic illness to subjective health. The same pattern\nwas observed in W2 and W3: African Americans have more\nchronic and serious illness, higher disability, and poorer\nsubjective health than White Americans. Thus, consistent\nwith other studies, there is no question of whether Black\nadults have poorer health: they are clearly disadvantaged.\nThe double jeopardy hypothesis, however, rests on examin-\ning change in the health differential. Does the health differ-\nential increase with aging? The bulk of the analysis, there-\nfore, assesses change in health status indicators among all\navailable adult subjects in the study. A final step is to\nperform a series of analyses to examine the role of selective\nsurvival.\nHealth Change in Adulthood\nAll three waves of data were used to examine change in\nhealth for Black and White subjects. The bulk of the analytic\nplan uses two successive waves of data to identify basic\npatterns of change using residualized regression procedures\narticle by the authors, only change between the first and last\nsurveys was considered (Ferraro and Farmer, 1996). Al-\nthough many findings from the two approaches are similar,\nsome are unique and provide new insights for understanding\nethnic health inequality. Besides the different use of the\nwaves, we performed two additional sets of analyses for the\npresent research: (a) tests of other interactions by Black,\nespecially interactions with the separate diseases, and (b)\nexplicitly incorporating mortality into analyses of change in\n\"health\" following the procedures of Markides, Timbers,\nApplying residualized regression procedures creates\nmodels of change in the outcome under consideration. The\nWl indicator of health is entered first in the equation,\nthereby testing the effects of the covariates on change in the\nvariable measured at two times. An alternative procedure is\nto calculate change scores (Allison, 1990). Seven of the\neight OLS equations presented below were calculated with\nboth the residualized regression and change score methods\n-- and the pattern of results was almost identical. As\ndescribed earlier, the measures of functional limitations\nwere not identical at all three waves, so the change score\nmethod could not be applied to one of the eight equations.\nGiven this limitation as well as the widespread use of and\nease in interpreting the residualized regression procedures,\nthey are presented below.\nTable 2 presents the longitudinal regressions of the four\nhealth indicators at W2 on the relevant predictors at baseline.\nThe first equation shows that higher chronic morbidity was\nobserved for older people, those on Medicaid, obese per-\nsons, and those with higher chronic illness at Wl. In the\nsecond equation, serious illness became more prevalent by\nW2 among those .who had a serious illness at Wl, older\npeople, men, Black persons, rural residents, and those with\nless education. Health behavior was also important, as obese\npersons and past smokers were more likely to develop a\nserious illness. As might be expected, higher disability was\nassociated with higher morbidity at baseline and restricted\nactivity. In addition, higher levels of disability were ob-\nserved for older persons, women, widowed persons, smok-\ners, and subjects with limited incomes or on Medicaid. As\nshown in Table 2, an interaction term for Black and age was\nincluded in all three equations but was nonsignificant.\nTurning to the final equation, a decline in subjective\nhealth was observed for persons with higher levels of chronic\nand serious illness, restricted activity, and those who judged\ntheir health to be poor at Wl. A decline in health was also\nobserved for older people, men, Black adults, and persons\nwith lower educational attainment and less income. Obese\npersons and both current and past smokers were also more\nlikely to report a decline in subjective health over the 10-year\nperiod. Unlike the other equations, the Black x Age interac-\ntion is significant, but not in the direction consistent with\ndouble jeopardy. In tandem with the negative effect for\nBlack, the positive effect for the interaction term reveals that\nthe subjective health of young and middle-aged African\nAmericans declined more rapidly than for young and\nmiddle-aged Whites, but that among Black elders no such\ndecline occurred. Given that Black adults began the study in\npoorer health than their White counterparts, this is evidence\nof a shrinking of the health disadvantage in the later years,\nwhat has been referred to in the literature as aging as a leveler\nof ethnic differences. This was the only case where the\nstability of racial differences between Wl and W2 was not\nsupported.\nParallel equations for change in health between W2 and\nW3 are presented in Table 3. Most results are quite similar to\nthose reported in Table 2, but chronic illness increased more\nrapidly for women during this period, while serious illness\ncontinued to increase among men. No Black x Age interac-\ntions were observed for either of the indicators of morbidity.\nThe effects of social class variables continued to be impor-\ntant. Lower education, less income, having a regular physi-\ncian, and being on Medicaid were associated with more\nrapid declines in selected measures of health. Obesity's\neffect was also significant for increasing serious illness and\ndeclining subjective health. Not only were the interaction\nterms for Black and age nonsignificant, but the main effects\nfor Black were also nonsignificant during the five-year\nperiod. Overall, these results provide evidence for the stabil-\nity of racial differences.\nIn addition to double jeopardy, tests for triple jeopardy\n(age, race, and gender interactions) were also performed\n(not presented). In no case was evidence for the triple\nTable 2.

In short, the bulk of the evidence\nreveals substantial health inequality by ethnicity, but these\ndifferences did not amplify for either older Black men or\nolder Black women. Black/White differences in health\nemerge far before later life, and subjective health among\nBlack older adults does not decline more rapidly than it does\nfor White elders. In fact, for the first 10 years of observation,\nsubjective health among African American elders did not\ndecline as rapidly as it did for White elders -- suggesting a\nleveling of age differences among survivors.\nThe next procedure for assessing change was to examine\nthe effects of the individual illnesses on functional limita-\ntions and subjective health over the study period. The es-\nsence of this approach is to substitute dummy variables for\neach illness in place of the variables for chronic illness and\nserious illness used thus far. Given the ethnic differences in\nepidemiology for several of these conditions (e.g., hyperten-\nsion, diabetes), interaction terms were also created and\ntested (i.e., Black x Disease). Illnesses that were nonsig-\nnificant in the initial models were deleted from subsequent\nmodels. If there were main effects for an individual illness,\nthen interaction terms for each of the illnesses with Black\nwere created and tested one at a time. These analyses (not\npresented) showed that physical disability increased more\nrapidly for persons with arthritis, diabetes, heart failure, hip\nfracture, and hypertension. Only one case of statistical\ninteraction was uncovered: the interaction of Black and heart\nfailure on disability. The interaction of Black and heart\nfailure indicated that heart failure's effect on disability was\nstronger for Black subjects than for White subjects. Analy-\nses for change in subjective health with the individual\nillnesses as covariates were also conducted. Only three\ndiseases played a strong role in declining perceived health:\narthritis, diabetes, and hypertension -- the last two of which\nhave much higher prevalence among Black subjects. Yet,\nnone of the interactions for any of these conditions by Black\nwere significant. Overall, these findings confirm the earlier\nresults that Black Americans of all ages report poorer subjec-\ntive health as they age -- the decline is not limited to just\nBlack elders as predicted by the double jeopardy hypothesis.\nA final step in the analysis of health changes in adulthood\nwas to consider other periods of the life course when the\nBlack disadvantage may increase. Based on the emerging\nbody of research giving attention to important health differ-\nences developing in middle age, especially among persons\nof lower socioeconomic status (SES), a series of alternative\nspecifications were undertaken to examine the possibility\nthat the Black disadvantage may increase in middle age\nthese supplementary analyses, three age groups were con-\ngroup serving as the reference group, there were no in-\nstances where the Black disadvantage increased for the\nmiddle-aged group. While it is possible that Black disad-\nvantage may increase on other health indicators, there is no\nevidence of such an increase on the four indicators available\nover time in NHEFS.\nMortality Analysis\nOne of the weaknesses of how the double jeopardy hy-\npothesis was originally developed and specified was that it\ndid not explicitly consider the role of mortality. Therefore,\nthe next phase of the analysis seeks to account for mortality,\nespecially Black/White differences in mortality. Over 1,300\nof death was recorded, event history models were used to\ndetermine if Black Americans' mortality occurred sooner\nthan that of Whites in the sample. Estimates were obtained\nwith both parametric procedures based on Weibull models\nStatistical Analysis System, 1990; Teachman and Hayward,\n1992). The significance of effects is identical from the\nWeibull and the proportional hazards models; only the latter\nare presented below.\nThe results of four event history models using propor-\ntional hazards are displayed in Table 4. The first is a\nmortality analysis over the entire study period (W1-W3).\nThe results from this equation (first column) show that the\nstrongest effects on survival were for gender and present\nsmoking status: women and nonsmokers were less likely to\nhave died. Beyond sex and smoking, note that Black sub-\njects were more likely to die during the study period. The\neffect of serious illness on mortality is positive, whereas the\neffect of chronic illness on mortality is negative (although\nslight in magnitude). In addition, survival was higher for\nthose without activity restrictions, better subjective health,\nyounger respondents, higher income, and other health insur-\nance. Although African Americans are more likely to have\npoorer subjective health, there is an independent effect due\nto ethnicity.\nThe only difference in the second equation is the addition\nof the interaction term for age and Black. The results of this\nmodel are quite similar, but note that the main effect for\nBlack is stronger and the interaction term is also significant\nbut negative. In short, the Black disadvantage in mortality\nrisk is greater in the young and middle ages; Blacks' higher\nmortality risk actually decelerates in the later years, a finding\nthat is consistent with the racial-mortality crossover findings\nof others (Manton, 1982). The third and fourth models\npresented use the two-wave sequences to estimate mortality\nrisk and include the interaction term for age and Black.\nThese models are quite similar, but the interaction term is\nonly significant in the final equation. Given NHEFS upper\nage limit at baseline of 74, the deceleration of the Black\ndisadvantage in mortality risk is not significant in the third\nequation, but is significant by the final wave. This is consist-\nent with the findings that the racial-mortality crossover does\nNote also that other health insurance and smoking are sig-\nnificant risk factors only in the analysis between Wl and\nW2, but that serious illness is an important risk of mortality\nin all equations. The survivors, however, are more likely to\nmanifest chronic illnesses.\n' 'Health'' Status Change Including Decedents\nAs a final way to consider the effect of mortality on\ninterpretations of the double jeopardy hypothesis, a set of\n\"pseudovariables\" was created for W3 that included the\nrespondents who died for nonaccidental reasons (i.e., acci-\ndental deaths were excluded through the use of NHEFS\nTable 4.

Markides, Timbers, and Osberg (1984)\nused this procedure in their longitudinal study of health\namong Anglo and Mexican Americans (see also Vaillant,\n1978). The pseudovariables were created by coding the\ndeceased subjects in poorer health. For subjective health,\nwhere scores normally range from (1) = poor to (5) =\nexcellent, we scored deceased subjects as zero. (For the\nmorbidity and disability indicators, deceased subjects were\nscored higher.) The results of these analyses with NHEFS\nare displayed in Table 5. For parsimony, only the analysis\nbetween Wl and W3 is shown.\nThe purpose of the analyses shown in Table 5 is to\nexplicitly incorporate the role of selective survival in under-\nstanding health inequalities across the life course -- because\nnot doing so may underestimate the possibility of detecting a\ndouble jeopardy effect. The most obvious differences from\nthese findings in comparison to those among the survivors\nonly were that men, older people, and smokers manifested\nmuch greater \"health\" disadvantages in these analyses. In\naddition, serious illness -- but not chronic illness -- was\nimportant in predicting disability and subjective health, and\nthe effects of income were stronger in all four equations. A\nBlack x Age interaction was significant in the equations for\nchronic illness and disability, consistent with the double\njeopardy hypothesis. (Penultimate models without the inter-\naction term reveal significant main effects for Black and age,\nbut the main effect for Black in the two equations with the\ninteraction was not significant.) Thus, simultaneously con-\nsidering health status and mortality provides some evidence\nfor the double jeopardy hypothesis on two indicators:\nchronic illness and disability. A main effect for Black was\nobserved in the equation for subjective health; its effect was\nnegative as expected, but no significant interaction was\nmanifest. Coupling the findings of earlier analyses largely\nshowing the stability of ethnic differences in health with the\nfindings from Table 5 suggests that, indeed, the higher\nmortality risk of African Americans is part of the reason why\nevidence for double jeopardy has been lacking in the litera-\nture. At the same time, such an effect was only observed on\ntwo of the four measures of health status. The other conclu-\nsion from these findings is that there is no evidence in\nsupport of the age-as-leveler thesis when including the\ndeceased subjects in the analysis. Indeed, these results\nsuggest that selective survival may be a chief reason for\nfindings supporting the aging-as-leveler thesis, and that the\nhypothesis specified by aging as leveler (of individual differ-\nences) should be recast as selective survival as leveler among\npopulations. While caution is urged for interpretations based\non the pseudovariables used here, the direction of these\neffects cast serious doubts on the original formulation of the\naging-as-leveler hypothesis as pertains to health.\nDISCUSSION\nWhile the hypothesis of double jeopardy to health has\ngarnered the most attention in the literature, three outcomes\nwere considered related to aging and differences in health\namong minorities: (1) double jeopardy, which refers to\namplified health problems in later life; (2) age-as-leveler,\nwhich refers to diminished health differences by ethnic\ngroupings; and (3) persistent inequality of ethnic differ-\nences. Depending upon the measure of health considered\nand the analytic strategy employed, there is some evidence\nTable 5.

In\ngeneral, the findings show that Black Americans of all ages\nsuffer from health problems, not just the older adults. In\naddition, some of these differences are due to social class\nvariables (see also Blau, Oser, and Stephens, 1979). Be-\ncause African Americans have, on average, lower educa-\ntional attainment and family income, they also suffer a\nhealth disadvantage. Several of the previous studies of\ndouble jeopardy had limited indicators of social class and\nfinancial resources. While NHEFS does not have exhaustive\ndata on financial status, we have seen that income, educa-\ntion, insurance type, and having a regular physician are\nimportant. The effects due to smoking and obesity were also\nimportant when examining the outcomes and, again, few\nprevious studies on the subject included these as covariates.\nFuture research on age changes in health inequities needs to\nconsider these types of life-style factors for at least two\nreasons: (1) they differ across ethnic groups and (2) there has\nbeen substantial change in smoking and obesity during the\nThe findings do not in any way diminish the enormity of\nhealth problems for African Americans. Rather, it is the\ndepiction of Black elders, and their problems, which these\nfindings may call into question. The event history analyses\nshowed that African Americans were found to be less likely\nto survive into older ages. Black Americans suffer a health\ndisadvantage from birth through much of life (Baquet, 1988;\nMalone and Johnson, 1985; Mangold and Powell-Griner,\n1991). The evidence that health problems may have worse\neffects on African Americans was also demonstrated here by\nthe interaction of Black and heart failure on disability. Black\nadults with heart failure may have been identified later or not\nas quickly referred to treatment (Anderson et al., 1993;\nthese data show that once Black people have heart trouble,\nthe condition is more likely to disable them.\nOne limitation of these data for addressing the research\nquestion is the possibility of different orientations to and\nreports of health problems among Black and White subjects.\nFor instance, the morbidity questions are based on whether\nor not a physician ever told the subject that he or she had a\ncondition. Whereas White adults have more frequent physi-\ncian visits, they may be more aware of their health problems.\nThere is also the possibility that morbidity and functional\nlimitations mean something different to Black and White\nsubjects when evaluating their health. Gibson (1991b) found\nthat health reporting is actually quite similar among Black\nand White older adults, but some caution is in order. It is\npossible that the results from NHEFS may have underesti-\nmated the Black disadvantage, although these data clearly\nshow a Black disadvantage at the baseline interview.\nWhen confining the analysis to survivors of the 15-year\nstudy, there was no evidence for double jeopardy as origi-\nnally stated. African Americans who survive into advanced\nolder ages may not be nearly as health disadvantaged as\nsuggested by the double jeopardy hypothesis. As Gibson\n(1991a) shows, there is a more morbid group of younger\nBlack elders and a relatively robust group of Black elders in\nadvanced ages. The racial mortality crossover is also evi-\ndence of the more favorable status of Black elders who make\nit into advanced old age (Manton, 1980). Perhaps these\nsurvival dynamics are part of the reason that the gap in\nsubjective health between older Black and White survivors\nshrunk between the first two waves of the study.\nThe double jeopardy hypothesis may merit future research\nbut the bulk of accumulating evidence appears to speak\nagainst it (even for Mexican Americans; e.g., Markides,\nTimbers, and Osberg, 1984). Perhaps the emphasis upon\nchronological age was misplaced in the original hypothesis.\nGerontologists have long held a skepticism about the use of\nage as an independent variable (Botwinick, 1978), and the\ndouble jeopardy hypothesis implicitly falls into an ontoge-\nnetic fallacy (Featherman and Lerner, 1985; Stahl and\nFeller, 1990). The link to a specific chronological age (e.g.,\n65) is not necessary to conceptualizing ethnic inequality over\nthe life course (Ferraro and Farmer, 1996).\nFinally, the findings from this study emphasize the impor-\ntance of explicitly considering the role of mortality in models\nof health inequality. Most of the previous research attention\nwas focused on health but with cross-sectional data. By\nstudying respondents at one time period only, one compares\nthe health of minority and majority persons at different ages.\nWhile health and survival are obviously related, different\ninterpretations may derive from single-wave analyses of\nages known to have differential mortality. Because Black\nlife expectancy is generally lower, the proportion of Black\nadults surviving into older ages is much smaller, meaning\nthat the survivors are somewhat of an elite. Selective sur-\nvival in human populations also makes White older persons\nsomewhat of an elite, but the effect is more pronounced in\nthe Black population because of their higher mortality at\nearlier ages.\nWithout accounting for selective mortality, the idea of\nusing double jeopardy as a vehicle to study racial inequality\nin health at one point in time may be misleading. These data\nclearly show that Black Americans suffer the jeopardy of\nshorter life, but this is not something that develops in later\nlife; actually, the mortality risk for Blacks relative to Whites\nyears of the life course pose the greatest mortality risk, and\nthis risk continues throughout most of the adult years.\nIndeed, when including the deceased subjects in the analyses\nof \"health status\" change, there was evidence of double\njeopardy on two of the four health indicators. We are not\naware of any studies which have explicitly considered mor-\ntality in tests of these hypotheses among Black and White\nsubjects such as was done here (Markides, Timbers, and\nOsberg, 1984, studied Anglo and Mexican Americans).\nAlthough caution is warranted in the use of the pseudovaria-\nbles applied here, nonaccidental mortality conveys some\nhealth information, and integrating such information into\nhealth inequity studies deserves further investigation. Stud-\nies which do not explicitly account for selective survival may\ninadvertently \"stack the deck\" against finding a double\njeopardy effect. It appears that additional cross-sectional\nstudies of double jeopardy have little to offer in extending\nthe literature on health inequality among minority groups.\nHowever, additional panel studies which explicitly account\nfor mortality, perhaps with selection bias models (Winship\nThe results of the present investigation generally point to\nhealth inequities being present early in life and persisting\nthroughout the life course. These health inequities contribute\nto the higher mortality risk of Black adults, but the survivors\n-- Black older adults -- appear to have overcome considera-\nble disadvantage in maintaining their health. The findings\nalso suggest that the hypothesis specified by aging as leveler\nshould be recast as selective survival as leveler among\npopulations.\n"
