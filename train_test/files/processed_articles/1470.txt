Numerous studies have shown\nassociations between food insecurity and adverse health outcomes among children. Studies of the health effects of food\ninsecurity among adults are more limited and generally focus on the association between food insecurity and self-reported\ndisease. We therefore examined the association between food insecurity and clinical evidence of diet-sensitive chronic\ndisease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Our population-based sample included 5094 poor adults\n(assessed by the Food Security Survey Module) and self-reported or laboratory/examination evidence of diet-sensitive\nchronic disease using Poisson regression. We adjusted the models to account for differences in age, gender, race,\neducational attainment, and income. Food insecurity was associated with self-reported hypertension [adjusted relative risk\n0.89\u00ad1.58). Food insecurity was associated with laboratory or examination evidence of hypertension (ARR 1.21; 95% CI,\nsignificance in the fully adjusted model unless we used a stricter definition of food insecurity (ARR 2.42; 95% CI, 1.44\u00ad\n4.08).

Most\nadults living in food-insecure households report being unable to\nafford balanced meals, worrying about the adequacy of their\nfood supply, running out of food, and cutting the size of meals or\nskipping meals. At the most severe levels of food insecurity,\nmany adults report being hungry because there was not enough\nmoney for food and not eating for an entire day (2). Each\nepisode of food insecurity is generally short in duration.\nHowever, the dietary changes associated with food insecurity\nmay persist over extended periods, because food-insecure\nhouseholds often experience repeated food budget shortages.\nOn average, households that report being food insecure at some\ntime during the year are food insecure for 7 mo during the year\nCommon household responses to inadequate food supplies\ninclude food budget adjustments, reduced food intake, and\nalterations in types of food served (3\u00ad6). Dietary variety\ndecreases and consumption of energy-dense foods increases.\nThese energy-dense foods, including refined grains, added\nsugars, and added saturated/trans fats, tend to be of poor\nnutritional quality and less expensive calorie-for-calorie than\nalternatives (7,8). U.S. adults living in food-insecure households\nconsume fewer weekly servings of fruits, vegetables, and dairy\nand lower levels of micronutrients, including the B complex\nvitamins, magnesium, iron, zinc, and calcium (5,9,10). These\ndietary patterns are linked to the development of chronic\ndisease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes\nThere have been many studies suggesting that food insecurity\namong children has adverse health effects, including increased\nrates of iron-deficiency anemia, acute infection, chronic illness,\nand developmental and mental health problems (13\u00ad19).

Using clinical evidence of\ndisease is important in low-income populations, because delays\nin medical care may preferentially reduce disease diagnosis\namong the most financially vulnerable, biasing results toward an\nunderestimate of the association between food insecurity and\nchronic disease (24).\nIn this study, we used a population-based sample to evaluate\nassociations between food insecurity and objectively measured\ncardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipid-\nemia, and diabetes. Because we used examination and labora-\ntory data to assess the presence of chronic disease, we were able\nto quantify both the prevalence and severity of these conditions\namong adults living in food-insecure households.\nMethods\nSample. The NHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally representative\nsurvey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population (25). Details\nof recruitment have been published previously (26). We combined data\nWe restricted our analysis to adults aged 18\u00ad65 y reporting household\nincomes #200% of the federal poverty level (FPL).4 We excluded\nchildren because of the low prevalence of the chronic diseases in which\nwe were interested; the elderly because of the high prevalence of the\nchronic diseases in which we were interested (suggesting alternative\ndisease pathways) and because of differences in access to health care\nbetween poor elderly and poor nonelderly adults; pregnant women\nbecause pregnancy affects the clinical variables in which we were\ninterested; and individuals living in households reporting incomes\n.200% of the FPL because the prevalence of food insecurity in these\nhouseholds is ,4% (27). The FPL is a number updated annually by the\nCensus Bureau to reflect the household income at which a family is\nconsidered to be in poverty. The FPL varies according to household size\nand age composition; e.g. the FPL for a family of 2 adults and 2 children\nData collection. All NHANES participants completed an English or\nSpanish version of an interviewer-administered questionnaire in their\nown home. Participants then attended a specially equipped mobile\nexamination center where they underwent a standardized physical\n(including height, weight, and blood pressure measurements) and\nlaboratory examination (28). A random subset of participants under-\nwent a fasting laboratory examination.\nFood security. More than 99% of the eligible sample participated in the\nFood Security Survey Module, which is a well-validated questionnaire\ndeveloped by the USDA to measure household food security over the\nprior 12 mo (6,29). Because we were interested in adult health outcomes,\nwe used responses to only the 10 household and adult items in the 18-\nitem scale. (The remaining 8 items refer to household children.) Using\nvalidated cutpoints, we considered an adult to be food secure if #2 items\nin the scale were answered affirmatively (often referred to as high and\nmarginal food security) and food insecure if $3 items were answered\naffirmatively (often referred to as low and very low food security) (6). In\na sensitivity analysis, we also dichotomized the scale as #5 affirmative\nresponses (high, marginal, and low food security) and $6 affirmative\nresponses (very low food security). The Chronbach's a for the scale\nClinical variables. We evaluated as dependent variables both a self-\nreported and a clinical diagnosis of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and\ndiabetes. Self-reported disease was identified by affirmative answers to\nthe question \"Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you\n(that you had hypertension, also called high blood pressure) (that your\nblood cholesterol level was high) (that you have diabetes or sugar\ndiabetes)?\" Either of 2 criteria was used to define participants with\nclinical disease: out-of-range laboratory/examination measures or med-\nication use. Using this method, we included as having clinical disease\nthose who had undiagnosed disease (out-of-range laboratory/examina-\ntion measures) as well as those with diagnosed disease who were being\nsuccessfully treated such that their laboratory/examination measures\nwere now in the normal range (medication use). That is, we considered\nclinical evidence of hypertension to be either a measured systolic blood\npressure (SBP) .140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) .90 mm\nHg, consistent with current Joint National Committee guidelines (31), or\nself-reported use of antihypertensive medication. We considered clinical\nevidence of hyperlipidemia to be either a total cholesterol concentration\n$240 mg/dL (6.22 mmol/L) or a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration\n$160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L), consistent with current Adult Treatment\nPanel-III guidelines (32), or self-reported use of lipid-lowering therapy.\nWe considered clinical evidence of diabetes to be either a fasting plasma\nglucose $126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L), consistent with American Diabetes\nAssociation and WHO guidelines (33,34), or self-reported use of insulin\nor oral hypoglycemic medication.\nOur covariates included sociodemographic factors known to be\nassociated with chronic disease and/or food insecurity, including age,\ngender, race/ethnicity (self-reported non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic\nBlack, Hispanic, or other/multiple), education (less than high school,\nhigh school degree, or more than high school degree), and household\nincome. To fully adjust for income, we included income as both\nStatistical analysis. Results were weighted to represent the noninsti-\ntutionalized U.S. population aged 18\u00ad65 y. We used the complex survey\ncommands in Stata 9.2 (2007) to obtain weighted estimates, SE, and\nP-values that correctly reflected the stratification and clustering of\nobservations induced by NHANES' design. We used 6-y interview\nweights for self-reported variables and mobile examination center\nweights for laboratory and examination data. We considered all\nP-values , 0.05 as significant.\nWe compared differences in baseline characteristics using the design-\nbased F statistic. We estimated the association between food insecurity\nand disease prevalence using Poisson regression with robust SE and\nestimated probabilities directly from the regression models. We report an\nunadjusted prevalence, a crude relative risk (CRR; adjusting for age,\ngender, and race/ethnicity), and an adjusted relative risk (ARR; adjusting\nfor age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income). For participants\nwith more than 1 diagnosis (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes),\nwe evaluated each condition independently.\nTo determine whether self-management capacity among those with\nchronic disease was limited by food insecurity, we evaluated the subset of\nadults who self-reported a disease diagnosis for inadequate control. We\ndefined control as adherence to current treatment goals, because we were\ninterested in whether food-insecure adults were at increased risk of long-\nterm complications related to chronic disease. For hypertension, we\ndefined inadequate control as blood pressure .140/90 mm Hg, for\nhyperlipidemia a total cholesterol concentration $200 mg/dL (5.18\ndiabetes a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) .7% (36). Where significant\nassociations between food insecurity and inadequate disease control\nwere found, we used linear regression to estimate the association with\ncontinuous outcomes.\n4 Abbreviations used: ARR, adjusted relative risk; CRR, crude relative risk; DBP,\ndiastolic blood pressure; FPL, federal poverty level; HbA1c, glycated hemoglo-\nbin; RR, relative risk; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\nFood insecurity and chronic disease 305\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nWe performed 3 sensitivity analyses. In the first, we defined food\ninsecurity using all 18 items of the Food Security Survey Module,\nincluding the 8 items referring to the food security status of children in\nthe household that were not included in the main analysis. Second, we\nused a more severe definition of food insecurity ($6 affirmative\nresponses rather than $3 affirmative responses). Finally, we included\nBMI (calculated in kg/m2 from measured height and weight) in the\nadjusted models to determine the extent to which food insecurity might\nindependently contribute to the development of cardiovascular risk\nfactors.\nThe available sample size varies for the dependent variables because\nof skip patterns and the way in which NHANES participants are chosen\nto undergo the fasting laboratory evaluation. For example, all adults had\ntotal cholesterol level data as part of the laboratory evaluation (n =\n4559), but only adults reporting they had had their cholesterol checked\nin the past were asked if they had been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia\n(n = 1930). Because weighting accounts for differential sampling\nprobabilities, we used the entire available sample for each analysis\nrather than restricting the analysis to the subset of adults for whom we\nhad access to complete data. The sample sizes available for each analysis\nare indicated in the tables. This secondary data analysis was approved by\nthe Committee of Human Research at the University of California San\nFrancisco.\nResults\nstricted from the analysis pregnant women (n = 679), youth\nhousehold income .200% of the FPL and 45 participants\nbecause they did not respond to the Food Security Survey\nModule. These exclusions resulted in 5094 participants. Of\nthese participants, 95.6% of those from food-secure households\nand 98.5% of those from food-insecure households also\nparticipated in the mobile examination/laboratory evaluation\nLatino households were more likely to be food insecure than\nWhite households (P , 0.001). Household food insecurity was\nalso associated with low educational attainment, low house-\nhold income, lack of health insurance, and tobacco use (Table\n1). Consistent with previous studies, we observed an associa-\ntion between food insecurity and a higher BMI among women\nonly.\nWe combined results for men and women because stratifica-\ntion by gender yielded similar risk estimates for men and\nwomen. Among adults from food-secure households, 18.6% had\nclinical evidence of hypertension compared with 22.4% of\nadults from food-insecure households (Table 2). In adjusted\nanalyses, adults from food-insecure households had a 21%\n(95% CI, 4\u00ad41%) higher risk of clinical hypertension than\nadults from food-secure households (P = 0.02). Mean SBP and\nDBP did not differ by food security status (data not shown). The\nassociation between household food insecurity and clinical\nevidence of hyperlipidemia was not significant (P = 0.4).\nThere was clinical evidence of diabetes among 7.4% of adults\nliving in food-secure households and 10.2% of adults living in\nfood-insecure households. The risk of clinical diabetes was\n~50% higher among adults living in food-insecure households\ncompared with adults living in food-secure households (crude\nAmong adults already diagnosed with disease, food insecu-\nrity was associated with inadequate control of diabetes (ARR\nemia (Table 3). Mean HbA1c among adults with a self-reported\ndiagnosis of diabetes (n = 428) was 7.4% among adults living in\nfood-secure households and 8.1% among adults living in food-\ninsecure households (crude P = 0.09, adjusted P = 0.1).\nWhen we dichotomized food security at $6 affirmative\nresponses (instead of $3 affirmative responses), indicating more\nsevere food insecurity, the association between food insecurity\nand hypertension was no longer significant, although the\nprevalence was similar, suggesting an insufficient sample size.\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of eligible, low-income NHANES\nparticipants1\nSecure,\nInsecure,\nTime during last 12 mo without\nhealth insurance, %\nOccupational physical activity, % 0.05\nStands or walks, but doesnt carry or lift\nheavy things often\nLifts light loads, or climbs hills or\nstairs often\nLeisurely physical activity, %\nVigorous physical activity ($10 min in\nModerate physical activity ($10 min in\ngenerate population-based estimates of prevalence for the included sample.

The unadjusted\nprevalence of self-reported diabetes was 6.7% among adults in\nfood-secure households compared with 10.6% among those in\ndiabetes was 7.0% among adults in food-secure households\ncompared with 15.9% among those in food-insecure households\n4.08). The risk of clinical diabetes among those who did not self-\nreport a diagnosis of diabetes (suggesting undiagnosed disease)\nappeared higher among adults living in food-insecure house-\nholds than in food-secure households; however, this difference\nremained significant in the crude analysis only (CRR 2.73; 95%\nOur results were unchanged if we used the full 18-item scale to\nassess food insecurity rather than only the 10 items that reference\nadults in the household. Adding BMI as a covariate to the adjusted\nmodels did not change the association between food insecurity and\nhypertension or hyperlipidemia but made the association between\nfood insecurity and clinical diabetes significant (CRR 1.63; 95%\nDiscussion\nAmong nonelderly adults with household incomes ,200% of\nthe FPL, food insecurity is associated with clinical evidence of\nhypertension and diabetes. Evidence for an association between\nfood insecurity and hyperlipidemia is weak and not significant.\nWe previously reported an association between food insecurity\nand a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes (37). This study\nconfirms these findings with clinical evidence of disease and\nsuggests that adults living in food-insecure households may be\nmore likely to underreport a diagnosis of diabetes.\nA number of studies have reported cross-sectional associa-\ntions between food insecurity and self-reported chronic disease,\nincluding heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and general\nrecruited from community sites in rural Ohio, Holben et al.\n(39) found no relationship between food insecurity and clinical\nindicators of disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\nand hyperglycemia, except for higher mean HbA1c levels among\nwomen. Our work in a population-based sample suggests that\nfood insecurity may in fact be a risk factor for hypertension and\ndiabetes among nonelderly adults.\nControlling for BMI did not attenuate the association\nbetween food insecurity and chronic disease, suggesting that\nthese associations cannot be entirely attributed to an increased\nprevalence of obesity among food-insecure women. However,\nhypotheses to explain the association between food insecurity\nand obesity among women might also explain associations\nbetween food insecurity and the diet-sensitive chronic diseases\nwe evaluated in this study (11,12,39). These hypotheses include\nfood substitutions that emphasize relatively inexpensive but\nTABLE 2 Prevalence and crude and adjusted odds ratios for the association between food security and chronic disease among\nlow-income NHANES participants\nAssessment of diagnosis\nHypertension Hyperlipidemia Diabetes\nSelf-report,\nClinical,1\nSelf-report,\nClinical,2\nSelf-report,\nClinical,3\nFood secure\nFood insecure\n1 Clinical hypertension is defined as SBP .140 mm Hg, DBP .90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication.\n2 Clinical hyperlipidemia is defined as a total cholesterol $240 mg/dL (6.22 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol $160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L), or taking cholesterol-lowering medication.\n3 Clinical diabetes is defined as a fasting plasma glucose $126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or taking insulin and/or a hypoglycemic medication.\n4 Relative risk is for food-insecure adults compared with food-secure adults.

We\nare aware of no studies demonstrating a pattern of increased\nsodium and decreased potassium intake associated with food\ninsecurity (9,10), although qualitative work has suggested that\nfood-insecure adults have difficulty affording low-sodium food\nFood insecurity also appears to be more strongly associated\nwith diabetes than with hypertension, particularly at the most\nsevere levels of food insecurity. There are a number of reasons\nwhy this stronger association may exist. First, diabetes may be\nmore highly sensitive to diet, whereas hypertension and hyper-\nlipidemia may be more highly sensitive to medication adherence.\nSecond, an extension of the thrifty gene hypothesis suggests that\nperipheral insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes, may be\nadaptive in association with food insecurity insofar as it allows\nfor the preservation of muscle tissue during food restriction (47).\nThird, food insecurity is a highly stressful state, both emotion-\nally and physiologically (48). The elevated cortisol associated\nwith such stress is frequently linked to adiposity, particularly the\nvisceral adiposity that is a strong risk factor for diabetes. Finally,\nreplacement of dietary fruits and vegetables with relatively\ninexpensive carbohydrates, such as refined starches, increases\ndietary glycemic load and may increase the risk of developing\ndiabetes in predisposed individuals (49\u00ad51).\nWe also showed an association between food insecurity and\ninadequate glycemic control among adults diagnosed with\ndiabetes. This result might also be explained by the highly diet-\nsensitive nature of diabetes. In addition, self-management\ncapacity may be limited by difficulty affording prescription\nmedications in the face of extreme financial hardship. The\ndepression, fatigue, and poor self-efficacy that often accompany\nfood insecurity may exert additional effects (52). These self-\nmanagement barriers may establish a cycle in which higher health\ncare expenditures reduce food budgets; in turn, reduced food\nbudgets decrease self-management capacity and poor self-man-\nagement further increases medication needs, complication rates,\nand health care expenditures (53). This cycle may be exacerbated\nby the relative dearth of full-service grocery stores in many low-\nincome, and particularly African-American, neighborhoods\nacross the US (54,55). While healthy adults may be able to access\ntransportation outside of the neighborhood, those with chronic\ndisease may rely more heavily on corner stores and convenience\nstores for food purchases. Food available from corner and\nconvenience stores tends to be of lower nutritional quality and\nmore expensive, further limiting healthy food purchases (56).\nThere are 2 mechanisms whereby diabetes may increase the\nrisk of food insecurity. First, the out-of-pocket health care\nexpenditures associated with chronic disease may force adults\ninto food insecurity (57). Second, health education provided to\npatients with chronic disease may increase awareness of dietary\nintake and ability to afford healthy foods, causing a perception\nof food insecurity that may not have been otherwise noted.\nThese potential explanations for an effect-cause relationship\ndeserve further study.\nOur study was limited by small sample sizes for some\nvariables, in particular for inadequate disease control among\nadults with self-reported disease. The Food Security Survey\nModule assesses food security at the household level, which may\nmisclassify some individuals as food insecure if other household\nmembers are food insecure. However, most adults in a house-\nhold are food insecure when the household is food insecure (6)\nand any misclassification biases our results toward the null\nhypothesis. A single blood pressure or blood sugar measurement\nis generally not adequate for a diagnosis of hypertension or\ndiabetes. This misclassification is also likely to bias our results\ntoward the null hypothesis. Differential rates of nonparticipa-\ntion may have biased study results. We limited our sample to\nhouseholds with incomes ,200% of the FPL. This sample\nrestriction limits the generalizability of our findings to the U.S.\npopulation as a whole but provides important new information\nabout the population generally at risk for food insecurity and\nincreases the homogeneity of our sample with respect to\nunmeasured potential confounders (such as neighborhood\nenvironment). Finally, we used a self-reported measure of food\ninsecurity, because no objective measures of food insecurity (as it\nis currently conceptualized) exist. However, use of a self-\nreported measure is appropriate because many of the effects of\nfood insecurity may be mediated by an individual perception of\nthe degree to which food budgets are inadequate. Despite these\nlimitations, this study adds important population-based data to\nour understanding of the association between food insecurity\nand chronic disease.\nA number of interventions designed to reduce the financial\nburden associated with healthy dietary intake have been\nsuccessful at improving dietary intake. In 1 study, breast-feeding\nmothers receiving Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for\nWomen, Infants, and Children benefits, a public health program\nproviding food subsidies to pregnant and postpartum women\nand their children, were offered 10-dollar vouchers for fresh\nfruits and vegetables. Voucher redemption rates were ~90% and\nfruit/vegetable consumption increased (58,59). In another study,\ndelivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income, home-\nbound elders, some of whom reported an inability to afford\nfruits and vegetables, effectively increased fruit and vegetable\nconsumption (60,61). The long-term health implications of these\ninterventions are unclear.\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly\nthe Food Stamp Program) has a well-established and highly\nsuccessful infrastructure to reduce rates of food insecurity\nacross the US. To the extent to which SNAP can encourage\nshifts in dietary intake toward healthy food alternatives, it\nmight also have the potential to prevent the development of\ndiet-sensitive chronic disease and improve health outcomes.\nOngoing and planned modifications to the Supplemental\nNutrition Assistance Program attempt to encourage these\ndietary shifts. Using physiologic measures to rigorously eval-\nuate the health implications of these modifications will help\ndetermine the extent to which these programs may improve the\nhealth of the population by reducing the prevalence of\nhypertension and diabetes.\n"
