One study, for instance, reports that only 13%\nof skateboarders used helmets, jockstraps, and other protective\nequipment.5 Other studies report that a considerable percentage\nof children and teenagers (17% to 87%) do not use helmets when\nboarding.5,9 Researchers have tried to identify factors that promote\nhelmet use in child and teenaged boarders, including helmet use\nby parents9,10 and peers,7 and personal experience of a previous\nhead trauma injury.7 However, very little is known regarding fac-\ntors that influence helmet use in skateboarders.\nIn this study, we aim to 1) report the prevalence of, and factors\nassociated with, skateboarding and snowboarding in injured chil-\ndren and 2) explore factors influencing helmet use, head injury,\nand hospitalization in this sample. Although both activities are\nsimilar, the use of helmets in skateboarding has not been as aggres-\nsively promoted as in snowboarding. We therefore hypothesized\nthat there are statistical differences in helmet use, head injury,\nand hospitalization rates between skateboarders and snowboard-\ners. Our findings will help in designing and implementing spe-\ncific public education and awareness efforts, and in determining\nstrategies to promote helmet use. This, in turn, will likely reduce\ninjury in these sports.\nHoma Sadeghian, MD, is a Physician conducting research at the Neurovascular Research Laboratory in the Department of\nRadiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

They are selected as a\nstratified probability sample of all 5000-plus US hospitals with\nEmergency Departments. These hospitals have a minimum of 6\nbeds and provide 24-hour emergency services. Patient information\nis collected from each NEISS hospital for every emergency visit\ninvolving an injury associated with consumer products.\nSnowboard- and skateboard-related injuries were identified by\nthe correlating NEISS product code for snowboards and skate-\nboards, respectively. Data were collected during a 10-year period,\nchildren (aged < 18 years), both boys and girls, who had helmet\nstatus recorded in the comments section of the database. We\nseparated these children into 2 groups: age 12 years or younger,\nand older than age 12 years, mainly to distinguish teenagers from\nyounger children, and because there were very few snow- and\nskateboarders 4 years of age or younger. All medical records of\npatients who sustained a skateboarding or snowboarding injury\nduring the study period were retrospectively reviewed. Date col-\nlected included age, sex, race, location of boarding activity, body\npart injured, presence or absence of head injury, need for hospi-\ntalization, and mortality.\nTo analyze the data, we used descriptive and 2 tests to first de-\nscribe the overall characteristics of skate- and snowboarders in the\nsample, and then to identify factors associated with helmet use,\nhead injury, and hospital admission. Next, we used adjusted logistic\nregression to assess the independent role of skateboarding or snow-\nboarding in predicting helmet use, head injury, and hospital admis-\nsion, controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and activity location.\nUsing NEISS weighted data, all analyses were performed\nusing the Predictive Analytics Software (PASW) statistics Ver-\nsion 18.0 package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Ninety-five percent\nconfidence intervals were calculated, and p values below 0.05\nwere considered statistically significant. This study was ap-\nproved by our institutional review board and was conducted\nin accordance with regulations established through the Dec-\nlaration of Helsinki.\nRESULTS\npatients were found who met study inclusion criteria.

Two deaths occurred, both in skateboard-\ners who did not use helmets.\nAs illustrated in Table 1, the skateboarder group contained a\nhigher percentage of boys (54.8%), children 12 years or younger\n(76.6%), those who used \"other\" sites (other than sports/recre-\national parks) for boarding (94.4%), those who presented with\nhead injury (60.8%), and those who did not use helmets (68.6%).\nGirls were mostly snowboarders, and snowboarders were mostly\nteenager, white, less frequently admitted to the hospital, presented\nwith fewer \"other\" injuries, and used helmets (p > 0.05, Table 1).\nTable 1, column 2, shows that helmet use was significantly\n(p > 0.05) lower in skateboarders vs snowboarders, in boys vs girls,\nin children older than age 12 years vs children age 12 years or\nyounger, and in racial and ethnic minorities (ie, African Ameri-\ncans, Native Americans, Latinos, and Asians) vs whites. Helmet\nuse also was significantly lower in patients admitted to the hospital\nvs those who were not, in those who boarded in \"other\" settings vs\nsports/recreational parks, and in patients who sustained head injury\nvs those who did not.Table 1 also shows that those with head injury\nwere significantly (p > 0.05) more likely to be skateboarders, boys,\nethnic minorities, admitted to the hospital, and to have boarded in\n\"other\" locations.\nResults of the adjusted logistic regression show that the like-\nlihood of helmet use was significantly higher in children age\n12 years or younger (odds ratio [OR] = 2.48), and in those\nwho boarded in sports/recreational parks (OR = 1.18). Racial/\nethnic minorities (OR = 0.84), skateboarders (OR = 0.28), and\nthose who sustained head injury (OR = 0.58) had lower odds\nof using helmets (Table 2). Table 2 also reveals that male sex\n(OR = 1.44), minority race/ethnicity (OR = 1.19), not wearing\na helmet (OR = 1.7), and engaging in skateboarding as opposed\nto snowboarding (OR = 1.96) resulted in greater odds of head\ninjury, compared with female sex, white race, use of helmets, and\nengaging in snowboarding. With respect to hospital admission,\nour findings showed that boys (OR = 3.08), skateboarders (OR\n= 2.54), and children who sustained head injuries (OR = 2.33)\nwere more likely to be hospitalized, whereas the likelihood of\nhospital admission was lower in younger children (OR = 0.42)\ncompared with their older counterparts.\nDISCUSSION\nSkateboarding and snowboarding have become more popular\nsince the 1990s.1-4 In this study, we report on the prevalence\nand characteristics of injured skateboarders and snowboarders,\nand identify factors associated with helmet use, head injury, and\nhospital admission in the sample. We found that nearly half of\nthe sample engaged in skateboarding. More than half did not\nuse helmets, and almost one in three experienced head injuries.\nIn the sample, skateboarders were mainly boys, older teenagers\nand minorities, used \"other\" sites rather than sports/recreational\nparks, sustained head injury, and did not use helmets.\nTable 2.

In terms of being hospitalized, boys were three\ntimes more likely, skateboarders two and one-half times more\nlikely, and patients with head injury more than two times more\nlikely than their reference groups.\nSome of these findings are in agreement with other studies that\nhave showed increased rates of injury among adolescent and young\npopularity and the number of boarders increase, the incidence of\nhead injuries will also rise if further protective and educational steps\nare not taken. Our findings suggest that greater efforts should be\ndirected toward identifying incentives that increase helmet use in\nat-risk groups. Also, interventions that reinforce using helmets and\nperhaps other personal protective equipment must be a priority.\nOnce informed about the benefits of helmet use and when\nfamily and peers reinforce the routine use of protective gear,\nteenagers are more likely to use them.7,9 Popular media has a\nhuge potential in promoting and disseminating safety messages\nand changing safety perceptions in these groups, which can be\nreinforced by primary care physicians.12 These issues and concerns\nare of paramount importance, as we found no change in helmet\nThe higher incidence of helmet use at sports/recreation parks is\nreported in previous studies6 and is probably because of an emphasis\non safety at these locations. Children who use sports and recreation-\nal parks are usually required to use helmets as a condition of their\nuse. Usually this is a liability/insurance requirement. Nevertheless,\nchildren and their parents should be educated about the substantial\nrisks and burden of injury associated with these activities, and with\nnot wearing a helmet. In our study, skateboarders were more likely\nto be injured in other settings, including home or streets, where\nhelmet use warnings are not in place or are hard to enforce, which\nwarrants special precautions by their parents or guardians.\nRacial/ethnic minorities had a lower likelihood of helmet use\nand a higher probability of head injury and hospitalization. This\nmay stem from different shared attitudes and behaviors in safety\npractices, precautions, and routines, which needs to be further\nexplored. Larger studies are also needed to substantiate our find-\nings in separate racial/ethnic groups. The nature of our data limits\nour ability to perform such analyses.\nOur research has several other limitations. Our data are only\ncan account only for helmet use in pediatric boarders who were\ninjured and whose helmet status have been recorded. Our sample\nmay therefore not be representative of the population we intend\nto analyze because of selection bias. However, our findings are\npurported to be generalizable, because NEISS estimates of con-\nsumer product-related injuries for more than three decades attest\nto the stability and rigor of their reporting over time in contrast\nto a voluntary reporting system.13\nCONCLUSION\nA high proportion of skateboarders and snowboarders in our\nstudy did not use helmets and sustained head injury. We also\nfound that skateboarders, teenagers, minorities, and those who\nused places other than sports/recreational parks were significantly\nless likely to use helmets. In addition, boys, racial/ethnic minori-\nties, those who did not use helmets, and skateboarders were more\nlikely to sustain a head injury. Engaging in skateboarding, not\nwearing a helmet, and presenting with a head injury significantly\nincreased the odds of hospitalization. Publicity campaigns and\neducational efforts may have led to a higher rate of helmet use in\nsnowboarders. This suggests that similar injury prevention and\noutreach programs are needed for skateboarders to reduce head\ninjuries and hospitalization. v\nDisclosure Statement\nThe author(s) have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n"
