    "abstract": "Abstract. To assess the prevalence and motives for illicit use of\nprescription stimulants and alcohol and other drugs (AODs),\nassociated with these motives, the authors distributed a self-\nadministered Web survey TO a random sample of 9,161 under-\ngraduate college students. Of the study participants, 8.1%\nreported lifetime and 5.4% reported past-year illicit use of pre-\nscription stimulants. The most prevalent motives given for illic-\nit use of prescription stimulants were to (1) help with concen-\ntration, (2) increase alertness, and (3) provide a high. Although\nmen were more likely than women were to report illicit use of\nprescription stimulants, the authors found no gender differences\nin motives. Regardless of motive, illicit use of prescription\nstimulants was associated with elevated rates of AOD use, and\nnumber of motives endorsed and AOD use were positively relat-\ned. Students appear to be using these prescription drugs non-\nmedically, mainly to enhance performance or get high.\n",

We also assessed illic-\nit prescription stimulant use (ie, use of prescription stimu-\nlants not prescribed by a doctor), licit prescription stimulant\nuse (ie, use of prescription stimulants prescribed by a doc-\ntor), and AOD use. Finally, we asked participants about\ntheir motivations for illicit use of prescription stimulants.\nTo assess the lifetime prevalence of the illicit use of pre-\nscription stimulants, the following item was included in the\nsurvey: \"Sometimes people use prescription drugs that were\nmeant for other people, even when their own doctor has not\nprescribed it for them. On how many occasions in your LIFE-\nTIME have you used the following types of drugs, NOT pre-\nscribed to you?\" \"Stimulant medication (eg, Ritalin,\nDexedrine, Adderall, Concerta).\" Consistent with national\nresearch,2 the response scale was: (1) never, (2) 1\u00ad2 occa-\nWe used the following question to assess illicit use of\nprescription stimulants during the past year: \"On how many\noccasions in the PAST 12 MONTHS have you used the fol-\nlowing types of drugs, NOT prescribed to you?\" \"Stimulant\nmedication (eg, Ritalin, Dexedrine, Adderall, Concerta).\"\nThe response scale was: (1) never, (2) 1\u00ad2 occasions, (3)\nIf a student endorsed the LIFETIME illicit use of pre-\nscription stimulants, we asked the following question on the\nsurvey to assess the motives for this behavior: \"Please pro-\nvide the REASON(S) why you used a stimulant medication\nnot prescribed to you?\" (Check all that apply). Based on\nprevious literature (see Table 1), the survey provided 6\nfixed-item choices for the students to choose from, using\nlifetime as the time frame of analysis. The items were: (1)\n\"Because it helps me concentrate,\" (2) \"Because it helps\nincrease my alertness,\" (3) \"Because it counteracts the\neffects of other drugs,\" (4) \"Because it gives me a high,\" (5)\n\"Other (Specify)\" [open-ended text box], and (6) \"Re-\nfused.\" To provide an opportunity for students to choose\nmotives that were not represented in these items, we includ-\ned an open-ended text box in the Other (Specify) item that\nasked respondents to list additional motives for the illicit\nuse of prescription stimulants. This open-ended question\nalso allowed us to determine whether the items we devel-\noped provided adequate coverage of possible motives for\nthe illicit use of prescription stimulants. The other items we\ndeveloped did indeed provide adequate coverage of possible\nmotives for the illicit use of prescription stimulants.\nData Analysis\nTo meet our objectives of determining the prevalence of\nillicit use of prescription stimulants and examining students'\nmotives for this form of drug abuse, we established frequen-\ncies for each fixed-item motive. Then we developed an index\nof the number of motives each respondent endorsed to (1)\ndetermine the average number of motives for illicit prescrip-\ntion stimulant use and (2) assess whether or not providing\nmore motives for the illicit use of prescription stimulants\nwas associated with higher rates of AOD use. We used chi-\nsquare analyses to examine differences in motives between\nmen and women and to assess differences in AOD use on the\nbasis of individual motives students gave for the illicit use of\nprescription stimulants as well as the motives index.\nBecause of multiple comparisons, we adjusted alpha levels\n(p < .001) to reduce the likelihood of Type I errors. Finally,\nwe compared the distribution in motives between those who\nhad endorsed illicit prescription stimulant use who were also\nprescribed stimulants during their lifetime and those who\nhad illicitly used prescription stimulants without ever having\nreceived a prescription for stimulant use.\nWe compared the distribution of the frequency ranges (ie,\nas the proportion of each motive within each frequency\nrange to explore whether reporting a specific motive was\nassociated with more frequent ingestion of illicit prescrip-\ntion stimulants (eg, was reporting the use of prescription\nstimulants to \"get high\" associated with more frequent pre-\nscription stimulant ingestion?).\nTo identify other clinically significant motives for the\nillicit use of prescription stimulants, we conducted a latent-\ncontent analysis of the students' responses provided in the\nOther (Specify) item. The process for analyzing these qual-\nitative data involved 3 phases: During the first phase of the\ncontent analysis, 2 of the authors read all of the responses\nand individually identified dominant themes that emerged\nfrom the students' responses. These 2 authors discussed and\nreached consensus on the themes. After agreeing on the\nthemes, they established 13 categories that corresponded to\nthe themes. During the second phase, the authors estab-\nlished indicators for each category. Hence, the indicators\nbecame the operational definition for the category. During\nthe third phase, 2 independent and senior researchers used\nthe operational definitions for the respective categories to\ncode the students' responses into mutually exclusive cate-\ngories. It is these data that are reported here. We defined\ninterrater agreement as the number of responses agreed\nupon by 4 raters divided by the total number of responses\nassessed. The 4 raters included the 2 authors who developed\nthe thematic categories and the 2 independent raters. We\nused a random sample of 40 open-ended responses to obtain\nan interrater agreement of 90% for the 4 raters.\nRESULTS\nSample\nThe final sample consisted of 9,161 undergraduate stu-\ndents. As the data in Table 2 indicate, the demographic char-\nacteristics of the final sample closely resembled the charac-\nteristics of the overall student population. However, the\nfinal obtained sample included more undergraduate women\nthan in the overall student population based on chi-square\nanalysis (p < .001), which is consistent with national sur-\nveys of college students,16 and slightly more White students\nand fewer seniors relative to the overall student population\nPrevalence Rates and Motives for Use\nMore than 8.1% of the undergraduate student sample (n\n= 689) reported the illicit use of prescription stimulants in\ntheir lifetime, and 5.4% (n = 458) reported illicit use in the\npast year; undergraduate men reported significantly higher\nlifetime rates than did undergraduate women (9.3% vs\n7.2%, p < .001). Lifetime rates were higher for White\n(9.5%) and Hispanic (8.9%) students than for African-\nAmerican (2.7%), Asian (4.9%), or other racial student\nThe primary motives that students gave for using pre-\nscription stimulants illicitly were (1) to help with concentra-\ntion, (2) to increase alertness, and (3) to get high. We\nobserved no gender differences in motives for illicit use. The\nfrequencies for each motive and the index describing the\nnumber of motives endorsed are presented in Table 3.\nApproximately half the students who endorsed the illicit use\nof prescription stimulants gave more than 1 motive for this\n(range 0\u00ad5, mode 1.0) for the illicit use of prescription stim-\nulants. Of the 689 students who endorsed the lifetime illicit\nuse of prescription stimulants, 31 did not provide a motive\nTABLE 2.

For example,\nusing prescription stimulants \"to help concentrate\" accounted\nfor approximately 30% of the motives, regardless of the num-\nber of occasions of illicit stimulant use. However, the distrib-\nution in the actual frequency range of illicit prescription stim-\nulant use was skewed, with a steady decrease in the number\nof students reporting more frequent use. For example, a total\nof 254 students reported the illicit use of prescription stimu-\nor more occasions. The data in Figure 1 do not represent those\n31 students who did not provide a motive and therefore con-\nApproximately 14% (n = 97) of the illicit prescription\nstimulant users also reported being prescribed stimulant\nmedication in their lifetime. We found no differences in any\nof the motivations endorsed by those illicit users who were\nalso prescribed stimulants in their lifetime compared with\nthe illicit users who had never been prescribed stimulants.\nFor example, approximately 40% of those who endorsed\nthe illicit use of prescription stimulants provided \"to get\nhigh\" as a motive, regardless of whether they had also been\nlegitimately prescribed stimulant medications.\nAlcohol and Other Drug Use Behaviors\nChi-square analysis revealed significantly higher rates of\nAOD use for those students who reported the illicit use of\nprescription stimulants, compared with nonstimulant users\n(see Table 4). Furthermore, regardless of the motive or\nmotives for the illicit use of prescription stimulants, the 689\nstudents who endorsed these behaviors also reported signif-\nicantly higher rates of AOD use in the recent past. For\nexample, only 1.6% of those who reported no illicit pre-\nscription stimulant use had used cocaine in the past year,\nwhereas those who reported the illicit use of prescription\nstimulants to help them concentrate, increase alertness, or\nget high had past-year cocaine prevalence rates of 28.6%,\nthat the \"counteracts the effects of other drugs\" and the \"to\nget high\" motives were strongly associated with cocaine\nand amphetamine use. Finally, AOD use was positively\nrelated to the number of motives given for the illicit use of\nprescription stimulants, particularly for cocaine, ecstasy,\nand amphetamine use (See Table 5).\nFace Validity and Content Analysis\nOf the 689 students who reported the illicit use of pre-\nscription stimulants, 10% did not choose any of the motiva-\ntion items that we provided in the survey. This 10% con-\nsisted of those students who chose the Other (Specify) only\n(n = 39) and Refused (n = 19) categories as well as those\nwho provided no motive at all (n = 12). In other words, 90%\nof the students chose at least 1 of the fixed items to explain\ntheir illicit use of prescription stimulants. This suggests that\nour initial coding scheme provided sufficient coverage of\nthe content domain regarding the motivations for the illicit\nuse of prescription stimulants.\nEighty-seven students gave 94 open-ended responses\nconcerning motives for the illicit use of prescription stimu-\nlants. \"Curiosity and experimentation\" as well as \"to study\"\nwere the most frequently endorsed responses. In fact, more\nthan 20% of the students who responded to the open-ended\nquestion reported they had illicitly used prescription stimu-\nlants to enhance academic or work performance and nearly\n20% provided curiosity or experimentation as their motive\nfor the illicit use of these agents.\nProportion of Each Motive in Each\nFrequency Range\nNumber of Times Used\nFIGURE 1. Motives for the illicit use of prescription stimulants compared\nacross frequency of use (N = 658). The items were (1) \"Because it helps me\nconcentrate,\" (2) \"Because it helps increase my alertness,\" (3) \"Because it\ncounteracts the effects of other drugs,\" (4) \"Because it gives me a high,\" and\n(5) \"Other (Specifiy)\" [open-ended text box].\nOther\nHigh\nCounter\nAlert\nConcentrate\nCOMMENT\nPrevalence of Illicit Use of Stimulant Medications\nIn this study, we found that 8.1% of the undergraduate\nsample of university students reported they had used pre-\nscription stimulants illicitly in their lifetime and 5.4% had\ndone so in the past year. These prevalence rates are compara-\nble to college students nationally2 and to students at the Uni-\nversity of Florida,22 but are lower than findings from other\nstudies conducted at small colleges.1\u00ad3 When comparing\nprevalence rates between institutions, it is important to con-\nsider that there are significant differences in AOD use rates\namong student populations from different colleges and uni-\nbetween individual campuses, it may be the common features\nof the college environment (eg, staying awake for extended\nperiods of time) that lead to higher rates of illicit use of pre-\nscription stimulants. In fact, Babcock and Byrne1 speculated\nthat because stimulants such as methylphenidate delay the\nneed to sleep, this characteristic contributes to the likelihood\nTABLE 4.

Regardless of motive,\nit appears that the illicit use of prescription stimulants is a\nproblem among undergraduate students at colleges and uni-\nversities2 and therefore needs to be addressed both clinically\nand through additional research efforts.\nThe prevalence rate we found in the present study was\nconsiderably higher than the rates of illicit use of stimulants\nreported in the general population.25 Wu and Schlenger,25\nwho used data from the National Household Survey on Drug\nhousehold population aged 12 and older reported nonmed-\nical use of stimulants in the past year. However, that study\nspecifically included stimulant anorexiants such as Fastin\nand Ionamin, which make interpretation of the results more\ndifficult; they acknowledged that the motives for illicit psy-\nchostimulant use warrant further investigation. In addition,\nJohnston and colleagues2 found that college students report-\ned considerably higher rates of illicit use of methylphenidate\n(Ritalin) in the past year than their same-age peers who were\nnot attending college. Collectively, these studies suggest that\nMarijuana use Cocaine use Ecstasy use Amphetamine use\npast year past year past year past year\nMarijuana use Cocaine use Ecstasy use Amphetamine use\npast year past year past year past year\n% 2(df) p % 2(df) p % 2(df) p % 2(df) p\u00a7\nthe illicit use of prescription stimulants among college stu-\ndents may be occurring at higher rates than among noncol-\nlege populations.\nMen reported illicit use of prescription stimulants more\noften than women did, which is consistent with other studies\namong college students.2,5 Nationally, gender differences\nwere more pronounced with college men endorsing the past\nyear nonmedical use of Ritalin (8.4%) at significantly higher\nrates than were college women (3.9%).2 White and Hispanic\nstudents reported higher lifetime rates of illicit stimulant use,\nand these findings are consistent with racial differences in\nMotives for Illicit Use of Prescription Stimulants\nMany students in our sample reported that they used pre-\nscription stimulants to help with concentration, to increase\nalertness, or to get high. This finding is in agreement with\nKollins and associates8 posited that methylphenidate misuse\nis a means of obtaining other forms of reinforcement (eg,\nsocial interactions/partying, work, or studying) or as a\nmeans of avoiding other negative consequence. During a\nclinical study designed to determine whether reduced sleep\ntimes would enhance the reinforcing effects of methylphen-\nidate, Roehrs and associates26 found that performance-\nenhancing and fatigue-altering effects mediated the prefer-\nence for methylphenidate. In a survey of college students,\nmotivations for the illicit use of prescription amphetamines\nwere attributed to \"academic\" and \"recreational\" purposes\nand were similar to our findings that there were no gender\ndifferences in motivations.5 In an early report on high\nschool students, the top 5 reasons given by nonmedical\nusers of amphetamines were: (1) to get more energy (69%),\n(2) to stay awake (61%), (3) to experiment or see what it's\nlike (50%), (4) to feel good, get high (45%), and (5) to lose\nweight (40%).27 However, that report included the nonmed-\nically supervised use of all amphetamines and not those\nspecifically used for the treatment of attention-deficit\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Finally, the use of methyl-\nphenidate has been conceptualized as belonging to 1 of 2\ncategories--to stay alert and awake to study or party longer\nand to induce euphoria.9 Overall, the results of our present\nstudy provide evidence that support these conceptual frame-\nworks.\nAOD Use Behaviors\nAccording to our data, students who reported the illicit\nuse of prescription stimulants are engaging in significantly\nhigher rates of AOD use than are nonstimulant users. The\nAOD use rates were similarly elevated among those who\nreported illicit use of prescription stimulants, compared\nwith nonstimulant users regardless of the motives they gave\nfor this behavior. For example, compared with nonstimulant\nusers, the students who use prescription stimulants to help\nthem concentrate had similar rates of AOD use to those\nusing prescription stimulants to get high. This finding is\ncontrary to the notion that some students are using small\ndoses solely to study and are not engaging in excessive\nrisky behaviors. Despite these similarities in AOD use, the\nrelationship between the \"counteracts\" other drugs and \"get\nhigh\" motives and illicit drug use (ie, cocaine and amphet-\namines) appeared to be particularly strong, which may\nreflect a more extensive stimulant use profile for those stu-\ndents who use illicit prescription stimulants to counteract\nthe effects of other drugs or to get high. Furthermore,\naccording to our findings, those endorsing more motives for\nthe illicit use of prescription stimulants may have higher\nrates of AOD use. A similar relationship exists for alcohol\nconsumption in that those who are strongly motivated to\ndrink for various reasons (eg, increasing positive experi-\nences or avoiding negative experiences) are at heightened\nrisk for developing alcohol problems.15 This finding sug-\ngests that, to some extent, motivations for illicit stimulant\nuse may generalize to other substances.\nFinally, the frequency range of illicit use of prescription\nstimulants seems to be independent of the motives given,\nimplying that those using prescription stimulants to con-\ncentrate and increase alertness are using these drugs at rates\nsimilar to those using prescription stimulants to get high.\nFace Validity and Content Analysis\nOur fixed items thoroughly represented the motives\nendorsed by students, which supports the face validity of\nour items and suggests that the motivations identified from\nprevious literature are the most common in this population.\nThis finding indicates that our category scheme and the lit-\nerature from which it was developed capture the majority of\nimportant motives for the illicit use of prescription stimu-\nlants. In addition, some motives emerged from the open-\nended item that might be clinically significant and impor-\ntant for future research. For example, 17 students reported\nthat they used prescription stimulants from curiosity or\nexperimentally, and 88% of these students chose this motive\nas the sole explanation for their illicit use of prescription\nstimulants. The other common motive that surfaced during\nthe content analysis was to \"enhance study or work perfor-\nmance\"; this motive should be considered for inclusion in\nfuture surveys as separate from \"helps me concentrate\" or\n\"increases alertness\" because these motives may or may not\nbe directly associated with academic or work performance.\nLimitations and Strengths\nWe should note several limitations in this study before\nreaders assess the implications of our findings. Our sample\nconsists of students from a single campus, which limits the\ngeneralizability of our results. In addition, our study sample\nwas drawn from a predominantly White student population\nattending a large public university. Therefore, our findings\nneed to be compared with more diverse samples (both of\nstudents attending college and young adults who are not\ncollege students). Nonresponse may have introduced poten-\ntial bias in the present study; however, these concerns were\nsomewhat reduced because the demographic characteristics\nin the final obtained sample closely resembled the overall\nstudent population. In addition, the rates of drug use in the\npresent study were comparable to rates found in other\nnational substance use surveys of college students.2,28 We\ndid not survey students about the quantity of prescription\nstimulants they used illicitly per occasion. Also, we did not\ncollect information on the route of administration (ie,\nintranasal or injection), which would have an important\nimpact on the long-term morbidity and mortality as well as\nthe abuse potential of stimulant medications.29,30\nSeveral strengths of the present study are also notewor-\nthy. Our measure of motives for the illicit use of prescrip-\ntion stimulants was based on existing literature and appears\nto capture the most important motivations in this college\nsample. Further, our relatively large randomly selected sam-\nple provided us with an opportunity to examine the motives\nfor the illicit use of prescription stimulants in a high-risk\npopulation (ie, college students). The large sample size\nenabled us to obtain a substantial amount of qualitative data\nthat proved invaluable in assessing the validity of the items\nwe used to assess the illicit use of prescription stimulants.\nFrom a more general perspective, our use of a Web design\nis a novel feature, and our results highlight the usefulness of\nthis method for further research on illicit drug use among\ncollege students.\nFuture Practice\nClinicians, particularly those working directly with col-\nlege students (eg, pharmacists, nurses, and primary care\ndoctors working at college health clinics), should be aware\nof nonabusable prescription medication alternatives for the\ntreatment of ADHD. For example, atomoxetine is a\nnonabusable, noncontrolled substance that was recently\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration for the\ntreatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.31\nIn addition, limited data are available suggesting that bupro-\npion may also be effective for treating the symptoms of\nADHD, although this use is not approved for this condi-\ntion.32 However, despite the recent approval of atomoxetine\nand the limited information available for bupropion, no\nstrong data are available that indicate that these drugs might\nbe as effective as stimulant medications for treating the\nsymptoms of ADHD. Therefore, these medications may be\nespecially useful in those patients at risk for abusing their\nprescription stimulants and in those patients with a history\nof substance abuse. The use of novel pharmaceutical deliv-\nery systems such as those used in Concerta or the methyl-\nphenidate patch may limit the abuse liability of methyl-\nphenidate by decreasing the rate of the drugs' delivery of\nmethylphenidate to the brain. In fact, a letter to the editor of\nthe Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adoles-\ncent Psychiatry33 described the difficulty of extracting\nmethylphenidate from the polymer in Concerta tablets, pro-\nviding support that this approach may help curb the abuse\nof prescription stimulants. Furthermore, the reinforcing\neffects of methylphenidate have been partly attributed to\nrapid changes in serum drug concentrations, which may\nlead to fast dopamine increases in the central nervous sys-\ntem.30 Parents, school officials, and healthcare workers need\nto be educated on the potential for abuse with stimulant\nmedications, despite their proven efficacy in treating\nADHD. Prevention efforts might help curb the abuse of pre-\nscription stimulants through screening and assessment.\nClinicians who work with college students may find it\nuseful to ask them about their motives for illicit use of pre-\nscription stimulants because our results suggest that these\nmotives may indicate involvement with other substances.\nPostintoxication depression and the onset of suicidal\nideation have been reported after the abuse of methyl-\nphenidate,11 and these symptoms should be monitored\nclosely in any person suspected of abusing prescription\nstimulants.\nFuture Research\nQualitative research is needed to assess the motives for\nthe illicit use of prescription stimulants in various popula-\ntions, such as urban residents, those not attending college,\nand those with diverse racial backgrounds. Further refine-\nment of the measure of motives for the illicit use of pre-\nscription stimulants (eg, using a Likert-type rather than a\ncategorical response format) would facilitate psychometric\nevaluation of this scale and allow for assessing the strength\nof various motives for illicit use of prescription stimulants.\nIn addition, comparing the motives for use among those\nabusing prescription stimulants by alternative routes of\nadministration (ie, intranasally or intravenously) and among\nthose using varying doses might help clarify different char-\nacteristics of illicit users.\nThe long-term morbidity and mortality associated with\nthe illicit use of prescription stimulants should be examined.\nIn particular, studies that evaluate the routes of administra-\ntion and what quantities are being used would be informative\nin assessing the potential long-term consequences of use, as\nwould studies that review the concurrent abuse of prescrip-\ntion stimulants and alcohol. For example, Massello and Car-\npenter34 reported at least 1 fatality after the intranasal abuse\nof methylphenidate coingested with alcohol. Longitudinal\ndata would provide evidence for the trajectories of the illicit\nuse of prescription stimulants for assessing the impact of this\nproblem over time and would be valuable in investigating\nthe developmental course and long-term impact of this prob-\nlem in different populations. Studies should be conducted to\ndetermine to what degree college health professionals, such\nas primary care doctors and psychiatrists in campus health\nclinics, write prescriptions for stimulant medications. Tar-\ngeting these health professionals may be an effective strategy\nfor education and prevention efforts. Finally, learning about\nthe quantities of stimulants being prescribed by healthcare\nprofessionals may help identify whether these medications\nare being made available in excessive amounts resulting in\nincreased rates of diversion.\nSummary and Conclusions\nCollege students use prescription stimulants illicitly for\nmany reasons. Our findings highlight the importance of\nassessing the motives for the illicit use of prescription stim-\nulants and suggest that these motivations may be associated\nwith greater use of alcohol and other drugs, especially if the\nstudent reports the illicit use of such stimulants to counter-\nact the effect of other drugs or is using them to get high. In\naddition, those students who provide multiple motives for\nthe illicit use of prescription stimulants may also be using\nexcessive amounts of AODs. Although the long-term mor-\nbidity and mortality from these behaviors remain unknown,\nthe problem of prescription stimulant abuse exists in the\ncollege population and should be addressed both clinically\nand experimentally.\n"
