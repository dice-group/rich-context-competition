This was also\nillustrated in the STENO-2 study, which\nobserved a long-term CV benefit of an\nintensified, target-driven, multi-factorial\napproach in 160 type 2 diabetes patients\nwith albuminuria and high CV risk;7,8 an\neffect largely mediated (>70%) by the effects\nof lipid modulation.9\nThe randomized-controlled Asker and\nB\u00e6rum Cardiovascular Diabetes (ABCD)\nstudy showed that 2 years of structured,\nhospital-based multi-intervention signifi-\ncantly improved CV risk factors and\nreduced the estimated 10-year absolute risk\nfor coronary heart disease,10 driven by\nbetween-group differences in glycosylated\nhaemoglobin (HbA1c\n), systolic blood pres-\nsure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(LDL-C) and triglycerides. At the conclu-\nsion of the 2-year study, all patients returned\nto pre-study care with no further scheduled\nclinical intervention by the study team.10\nThe present pre-specified analysis assessed\nwhether the shorter-term reduction in esti-\nmated CV risk translated into longer-term\nreductions in CV outcomes and death as\nevaluated at a mean \u00c6 SD of 8.7 \u00c6 2.0 years\nfollowing randomization.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and study design\nThe study design, intervention and inter-\nmediate results of the ABCD study (clinical\nwith type 2 diabetes and !1 additional CV\nrisk factor were enrolled in an open, rando-\nmized controlled study and allocated to\neither 2 years of intensive, hospital-based,\nstructured multi-intervention (n \u00bc 60) or\nstandard care (n \u00bc 60) (Figure 1). All par-\nticipants underwent a comprehensive diag-\nnostic work-up at baseline including medical\nhistory, physical examination, 24-h ambula-\ntory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),\nlaboratory assessment and urinary assess-\nment of albumin excretion. A subpopulation\nof the cohort also underwent coronary\nangiography. All baseline procedures,\nexcept coronary angiography and 24-h\nABPM, were repeated 2 years after\nrandomization. Structured intensive multi-\nintervention comprised of 6 months of\nlifestyle intervention (i.e. advice on diet,\nexercise and smoking cessation and\nreimbursement of cost associated with exer-\ncise training), where medication was kept\nunchanged, followed by targeted, pharma-\ncological treatment to reach pre-specified\nFigure 1. Flowchart and outcomes during the Asker and B\u00e6rum Cardiovascular Diabetes study\ntreatment goals (HbA1c\ntolic/diastolic blood pressure [BP] < 130/\n80 mmHg) (for more details see Table 1).\nThe participants were seen by a physician\n(diabetologist) at 3-monthly intervals at the\nout-patient clinic of B\u00e6rum Hospital, Vestre\nViken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway.\nThe standard care group remained under the\ncare of their general practitioners (GPs) who\nwere recommended to treat according to\ncurrent guidelines with a recommended\nfollow-up at 3-monthly intervals (Table 1).10\nPatients who completed the 2-year\nstudy were returned to the standard of\ncare they had prior to study enrolment.\nPatients were followed for CV events, hos-\npitalizations and death and all patients alive\nwere invited to participate in this current\nfollow-up with clinical and laboratory\nassessments.\nInformed consent to participate was\nobtained from all participants in this study,\nwhich was conducted in accordance with the\nHelsinki declaration and approved by the\nRegional Committees for Medical and\nHealth Research Ethics.\nCardiovascular outcomes\nThe primary outcome was time to any first\nof the events of the composite outcome:\nnon-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-\nfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable\nangina pectoris (UAP), coronary revascu-\nlarization, percutaneous transluminal angio-\nplasty, amputation, hospitalization for heart\nfailure, and death from all causes. Since\ncoronary angiography was a study proced-\nure, revascularization procedures occurring\nimmediately during, and triggered by, the\nstudy procedure, were excluded. Secondary\noutcomes were total mortality as well as the\noverall cumulative event rates of the com-\nposite primary outcome and its components.\nInformation on events was collected from\nhospital records. In two cases, data on the\ncause of death were obtained from the\nNorwegian Cause of Death Registry. All\noutcome events were adjudicated by two of\nthe authors (L.L.G. and K.I.B.) blinded to\nthe treatment allocation.\nAnalyses of blood and urine\nLaboratory parameters were assessed in\nfasting venous blood samples. Urinary albu-\nmin excretion was determined in timed\novernight samples. Albuminuria was defined\nas urinary albumin excretion > 20 mg/min in\ntwo out of three samples.11\nExercise testing\nExercise capacity was assessed at baseline,\nstudy-end, and at the 7-year follow-up by a\nmodified conventional maximum stress test\non a cycle ergometer as described previ-\nously.12 Maximum oxygen consumption\n(ml/kg per min) was used to describe max-\nimum exercise capacity.\nCoronary angiography\nIrrespective of the results from noninvasive\ntests, coronary angiography was performed\nin 91 patients at baseline according to\nstandard procedures.13 Significant coronary\nartery disease was defined as the presence\nof ! 50% luminal diameter narrowing of\none or more of the epicardial arteries or its\nmajor branches.\nStatistical analyses\nBased on the STENO-2 study (approxi-\nmately 715 patient-years of follow-up),8\nthis present study targeted at least 1000\npatient-years of follow-up to ensure that the\neffect of the multi-intervention could be\nassessed with a reasonable level of power.\nAnalysis of outcomes was performed\naccording to the intention-to-treat principle\nand each patient who did not have an event\nTable 1.

Sensitivity analyses adjusting\nfor baseline differences between the groups\n(body mass index [BMI] and microalbumi-\nnuria) as well as sulphonylurea (SU) use at\nbaseline, were undertaken. The assumption\nof proportional hazards was tested using\nScho\n\u00a8 nfelds residuals.\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. A P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 120 patients with type 2 diabetes\nwere enrolled in the 2-year ABCD study.\nOf these, 106 patients (multi-intervention\ngroup: n \u00bc 49; standard care group: n \u00bc 57)\ncompleted the 2-year study (Figure 1), after\nwhich all participants returned to the care\nthey had prior to study enrolment. Patients\nwere followed for CV events, hospitaliza-\ntions and death during a mean \u00c6 SD of\n8.7 \u00c6 2.0 years from randomization, and all\npatients alive were invited to participate in\nthis current follow-up study with clinical\nand laboratory assessments that occurred at\nrandomization.\nBaseline characteristics of the two treat-\nment groups are given in Tables 2 and 3. Of\nthe 120 participants, three were lost to\nfollow-up (had moved) and complete infor-\nmation on the primary outcome was avail-\nable for 117 patients. Sixteen patients had\nmulti-intervention and standard care\ngroups, respectively) agreed and were able\nto participate in the clinical follow-up visit\nrandomization.\nDuring a mean \u00c6 SD observation time of\npatient-years, 27 patients, 16 in the multi-\nintervention group and 11 in standard care\ngroup, experienced at least one primary\noutcome event. In total, including recurrent\nevents, there were a total of 46 events (16\ndeaths [five CV deaths, 11 non-CV deaths],\nseven non-fatal MIs, eight non-fatal strokes,\none hospitalization for UAP, six hospital-\nizations for heart failure, one amputation,\none percutaneous transluminal angioplasty,\nand six coronary revascularizations)\n(Table 4), yielding a yearly incidence rate\nThere were numerically more events occur-\nring in the multi-intervention group than in\nthe standard care group, and, as expected,\nmore in the years after than during the\n2-year intervention in both groups. There\nwere more strokes occurring in the multi-\nintervention group compared with the\nstandard care group (eight versus none\nnon-fatal strokes and three versus one fatal\nstroke, respectively). In total, 19 patients\nunderwent 20 coronary revascularization\nprocedures during the entire study period,\nbut only six of these were considered to be\nstudy-independent and included in the ana-\nlyses as explained in the `Patients and\nmethods' section. The hazard ratio (HR)\ndetermined by Cox regression analysis of the\ntime to any first of the events in the primary\noutcome comparing allocation to the multi-\nintervention group with the standard care\n(Figure 2).\nAt the long-term follow-up visit, there\nwas no between-group difference in the\nmean \u00c6 SD overall number of oral antidia-\nbetic pharmacological agents used (1.6 \u00c6 1.0\nversus 1.3 \u00c6 0.8 in the multi-intervention\ncompared with the standard care group,\nrespectively), but the use of insulin was\nhigher in the standard care group\n(Table 5). Despite this, the mean HbA1c\nwas lower in the multi-intervention group\n(Table 6). The use of blood pressure-low-\nering medication, and in particular angio-\ntensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/\nangiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/\nARBs), remained higher in the multi-inter-\nvention group compared with the standard\ncare group, but the blood pressure levels\nwere similar in the two groups. Statin use,\nwhich had increased in both groups, but\nmore so in the multi-intervention group,\nduring the intervention (Table 7), continued\nto increase in the standard care group from\nstudy-end and remained unchanged in the\nmulti-intervention group (Table 5). This\nresulted in a significant between-group dif-\nference in the change in LDL-C levels, with\nthe LDL-C levels decreasing in the standard\ncare group and increasing in the multi-\nintervention group from study-end to\nsame period, estimated glomerular filtration\nTable 2.

While lipid and BP levels were similar\nin the two groups at 5 years after termin-\nation of the intervention period, the mean\nlevel was still slightly lower in the\nmulti-intervention group. Interestingly, a\nnumerical imbalance in the primary out-\ncome disfavouring intensified multi-inter-\nvention was observed. Although not\nsignificant, this finding may lead to specula-\ntion of an adverse effect of intensive glucose\nlowering, in line with what was reported\nfrom the ACCORD study.5 Potential mech-\nanisms for such an adverse outcome that\nhave been proposed include the high use of\nglitazones in the intensively-treated group,\nand the low target for and rapid decline in\nin this group.6 In the present study,\nthe lowest mean HbA1c\nlevel in the multi-\nintervention group of 50 mmol/mol (6.7%)\nwas achieved slightly slower than in the\nACCORD study, i.e. after approximately 12\nto 18 months.10 These present results show-\ning no long-term CV benefit associated with\nTable 5.

One could speculate whether\nin particular the higher use of glitazones\n(7% to 35% in the multi-intervention group,\n2% to 9% in the standard care group from\nbaseline to the end of the 2-year interven-\nthe multi-intervention group and 37% to\n27% in the standard care group from base-\nline to the end of the 2-year intervention),\nalthough small numbers, may potentially\nhave contributed to the possible harm\nseen, as both these drug classes are reported\nto have adverse or uncertain CV effects\nThese current findings are at variance\nwith the STENO-2 study, where a significant\nreduction in the risk of CV events and\nmortality was associated with the use of a\nmultifactorial intervention.7,8 Of note is that\nthe STENO-2 study included high CV risk\ntype 2 diabetes patients with microalbumi-\nnuria and hence higher baseline CV risk\nthan in the present study. There could be\nseveral reasons for these diverging results,\nthe major being the longer intervention\nperiod and follow-up used in the STENO-2\nstudy and the different approach to lipid\nmodulation.7,8 Furthermore, the minimum\nmean HbA1c\nlevel achieved in the current\nTable 7.

Thus, the\npresent study population was receiving a\ndifferent level of medication for CV protec-\ntion, potentially making it more challenging\nto improve CV outcomes further. This\nassumption is supported by a mediation\nanalysis indicating that > 70% of the CV\nrisk reduction seen in the STENO-2 study\nwas ascribed to lipid lowering.9\nFurther studies supporting the STENO-2\nstudy, with CV benefits being achievable\nalso in populations with advanced type 2\ndiabetes, are the follow-up study of the\nVADT16 as well as the EMPA-REG\nOUTCOME.21 The latter study demon-\nstrated that empagliflozin versus placebo,\non top of standard care, in type 2 diabetes\npatients with established CV disease (i.e. at\nan advanced disease stage), significantly\nreduced CV death by 38% and hospitaliza-\nbetween-group difference in HbA1c\nwas, as\n0.6%]); and given the multi-modal effects\nof empagliflozin (reductions in BP, arterial\nstiffness, weight and visceral adiposity),22\u00ad24\nit is likely that modulations of non-glycae-\nmic pathways are more influential.\nThe present study had several limitations\nof which the most important were the rela-\ntively small number of participants and the\nrelatively short intervention and follow-up\nperiods. Another limitation relates to the\nslight imbalances at baseline with a higher\nprevalence of microalbuminuria and higher\nBMI in the multi-intervention group, which\ncould influence the effects of the interven-\ntion. Furthermore, there was a lack data on\nthe frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes in\nthis study. Study strengths were the com-\nprehensive characterization of the partici-\npants, a real-life setting with an intervention\nthat was limited in time, however not too\nshort, and the blinded adjudication of all\nclinical endpoints.\nIn conclusion, 2 years of structured,\nhospital-based multi-intervention in a popu-\nlation with type 2 diabetes and additional\nCV risk did not improve long-term CV\noutcomes or mortality despite a short-term\nimprovement in estimated CV risk and\nsustained benefit on glycaemia. A numerical\nincreased risk of CV events and death in the\nmulti-intervention group may be related to\nthe choice of drugs used.\nAuthors' contributions\nO.E.J., L.L.G., K.I.B and A.P.O. designed the\nstudy.
