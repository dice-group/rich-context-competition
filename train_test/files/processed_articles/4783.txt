However, stronger, within-image, paired comparison studies, comparing art\nphotographs with the CoM moved on or off an axis (the 'gamma-ramp study'), or comparing adjacent\ncroppings on or off an axis (the 'spider-web study'), showed no support for the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory.\nFinally, studies moving a frame around two disks, of different size, greyness, or background, did not\nsupport Arnheim's Gestalt theory.

Gustav Theodor Fechner, in his Vorschule der Aesthetik (1876),\npointed out that\n[forms] are never used in isolation, but always with neighbouring shapes and proportions ...\n[together these result in what] I called the combinatorial determining influence .... (Fechner\nArt works typically have boundaries, which in the case of paintings, drawings, or\nphotographs are represented by a frame, which most often is rectangular, and may itself\nbe a work of art (Gombrich 1979) or, in modern works, may be minimal, being indicated\nprimarily by the image being in a different plane to the wall on which it is hung. Given a\nframe, then the problem of composition becomes the arrangement of objects and of patterns\nof light and shade within that boundary. Working artists typically know what is meant by\ngood composition, although defining the term, or dissecting its components, is far from\nstraightforward. Even less is known about the necessity of composition, for as the theoretician\nof photography Victor Burgin has put it:\n616 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nWe know very well what good composition is--art schools know how to teach it--but not why\nit is; 'scientific' accounts of pictorial composition tend merely to reiterate what it is under a\nvariety of differing descriptions (eg, those of Gestalt psychology) (Burgin1982, p. 150, emphasis\nin original).\nThe reference to Gestalt psychology is interesting, as there continues to be an interest in\nGestalt theory among artists (Behrens 1998; 2002), and the scientific literature itself contains\nfew other accounts of the nature of composition except those of Gestalt theorists.\nGestalt psychology emphasised that some forms, such as say a circle, are 'good', in the\nsense that they are simpler or are easier to recognise or describe. Descriptions of the Gestalt\nprinciples of good organisation (closure, similarity, proximity, symmetry, common fate, etc)\ncan be found in many introductory and advanced textbooks of vision (eg, Metzger 2006;\nGordon 2004). The intellectual origins of Gestalt theory can be found in the field theories\nof electromagnetism, which were described by physicists such as James Clark Maxwell (Ash\n1998). To a physicist a circle or sphere is formed, as, say, in a soap bubble, when a system finds\nan equilibrium at a minimum energy level. Using a similar argument, the Gestalt theorists,\nKohler in particular, suggested that the goodness of 'good forms' (gute Gestalten) occurs\nbecause the perception of the object, such as a circle on a page, results in a similar pattern\nof activity on the surface of the brain, a so-called isomorphic representation of the circle,\nwhich also has a minimum energy. Such ideas, which Verstegen (2007, p. 37) has referred to\nas 'the notorious Gestalt brain model', are, of course, completely incompatible with modern\nunderstanding of the neuroscience of vision so that although the Gestalt principles are in\nevery textbook, isomorphism is now nothing but a historical curiosity. That has, however, left\na difficult theoretical gap, for although the Gestalt principles seem to be sound as descriptions\nof perceptual phenomena, there is no strong theoretical underpinning for their origin. On\nthe one hand, it ought to be possible, as Verstegen (2007, p. 39) suggests, to keep the field\nmetaphor and jettison the specific mechanisms. On the other hand, that is the precise\nopposite of Cupchik, who says, 'Concepts such as fields and forces possess surplus meanings\ngrounded in other disciplines ... and are best treated in a metaphorical and reflective manner\nWithin psychological aesthetics one of the most important of writers has been Rudolf\nArnheim (1904\u00ad2007), much of whose theorising originates within Gestalt psychology\nPower of the Center (1982), Arnheim emphasised an holistic interpretation of an entire image\nor space, in which there are interacting, balancing sets of forces. Despite the suggestion of\nCupchik (2007) that the use of terms such as 'forces' should be considered as metaphorical,\nand he was writing specifically within the context of a critical reflection on Arnheim's theory,\na close reading of Arnheim suggests that he did indeed want his theory to be taken in a\nfairly literal sense (and indeed, when talking about 'perceptual forces', Arnheim is very\nclear, since after speculating whether these forces are, 'merely figures of speech, or are they\nreal', he continues,'they are assumed to be real in both realms of existence--that is, as both\nIn interpreting Arnheim, and the simple designs that he considers in Art and Visual\nPerception, it is important also to realise that much of Arnheim's theorising derives from\nDenman Ross's A Theory of Pure Design (1907), which Arnheim cites, and which takes a much\nmore explicitly physicalist approach. Denman Ross's book has been much neglected in the\npsychological literature, to the extent that in Web of Science we found only 11 citations,\nNevertheless, the book is of great interest, not least because Denman W Ross (1853\u00ad1935)\n(1)All quotations are taken from the 1974 edition.\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 617\nwas a polymath in the humanities and a lecturer in the Department of Fine Arts at Harvard\n(Hopkinson 1937), the university in which Arnheim was based when he prepared the revised\nedition of Art and Visual Perception. Although not a scientist, Ross does say in the preface to\nA Theory of Pure Design that although, 'Art is regarded as the one activity of man which has\nno scientific basis', it is nevertheless his, 'purpose ... to show how, in the practice of Art, as in\nall other practices, we ... follow certain principles' (1907, p. v). Elsewhere Ross was to talk of,\n'Design as a science' (Ross 1901), and he clearly had a desire for ' \"measurable quantities and\nqualities\" of art' (Johnson 1995, p. 59), so that he was aiming for, 'a scientific basis for design,\n[which could be] a verification or correction of visual feeling' (Ross 1901, pp. 371\u00ad72). In the\npresent paper we will firstly consider how the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory of visual composition\ncan be formalised so that it makes specific empirical predictions, and then test the theory\ndirectly by means of several experiments, mostly involving photographic images.\nChapter 1 of Art and Visual Perception is entitled 'Balance' and is devoted to the question\nof composition in visual works of art. The chapter begins with a reductionist approach that\nis reminiscent of the approach of a physicist, considering the relationship between a single\nblack disk placed on a white background within a square frame. When the disk is off-centre,\n'There is something restless about it. ... The disk's relations to the edges of the square [frame]\nare a ... play of attraction and repulsion' (Arnheim 1974, p. 11). The frame has an influence\nupon the disk, and indeed even an empty square frame,\nis empty and not empty at the same time. Its center is part of a complex hidden structure,\nwhich we can explore by means of the disk, much as we can use iron filings to explore the lines\nof force in a magnetic field (p. 12, our emphasis).\nArnheim's approach is undoubtedly derived from Ross's A Theory of Pure Design (1907),\nwhich Arnheim cites on page 19. Ross discusses the problem of achieving a visual balance\nfor a set of small disks arranged asymmetrically.\nThis is best done by means of a symmetrical inclosure or frame. In ascertaining just where the\ncentre is ... we depend upon visual sensitiveness or visual feeling, guided by an understanding\nof the principle of balance: that equal attractions, tensions or pulls, balance at equal distances\nfrom a given center, that unequal attractions balance at distances inversely proportional to\nthem. Given certain attractions, to find the center, we weigh the attractions together in the\nfield of vision and observe the position of the center (Arnheim 1974, p. 23, our emphasis).\nIt is hopefully clear that what Ross is describing is not mere metaphor, but is intended\nto be taken literally, in a sense that a physicist would recognise, and that in principle the\nbalance can be computed as if it were a problem in physics. Ross is also sensitive to the\nsubtleties that should occur when the objects are not mere black disks but 'vary in their tones,\nmeasures, and shapes, and where there are qualities as well as quantities to be considered'\n(p. 23), although he acknowledges that in such cases, 'calculations and reasoning becomes\ndifficult if not impossible, and we have to depend upon visual sensitiveness' (p. 23), the visual\nsystem presumably carrying out such calculations. In a direct analogy with the cropping\nmethodology to be described later, a composition which is in balance can be found by\nmoving a frame around the set of dots or objects:\nMove the frame up or down, right or left, and the center of the frame and center of the attrac-\ntions will no longer coincide, and the balance will be lost. We might say of this arrangement that\nit is a Harmony of Positions due to the coincidence of two centers, the center of the attractions\nand the center of the framing (p. 24).\nThis methodology is mentioned by Arnheim, who after describing Ross's work, says, 'the\ncenter of the frame coincides with the weight center of the pattern' (p. 19, our emphasis).\nThe only important difference between Arnheim and Ross is that while Ross seems to\nrequire the centre of the attractions to be at the physical centre of the frame, Arnheim\n618 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nsuggests that a picture can be balanced if the centre of the attractions is placed on any of\nthe major axes of an image, the horizontal or vertical axes, or of the two diagonals--and\nArnheim's Figure 3 (p. 13) shows that 'a disk is influenced not only by the boundaries and\nthe centre of the square [the frame], but also by the cross-shaped framework of the central\nvertical and horizontal axes and by the diagonals' (p. 13), which are 'comparatively restful\npositions' (p. 14). The psychological literature on balance has implicitly, and often explicitly,\nadopted physicalist ideas of balance [eg, in earlier work of one of us (McManus et al 1985;\nMcManus and Kitson 1995), as well as that of Locher et al (1996)]. Sometimes this involves\nsimple synthetic images, often only consisting of black and white, rather than the multiple\ngrey levels of photographs, as, for instance, in Locher et al (2001), Locher et al (1998), and\nWilson and Chatterjee (2005), or in images drawn from Japanese calligraphy (Gershoni and\nHochstein 2011), in all of which studies a balance score is calculated.\nFigure 1. The calculation of the centre of mass of two physical objects arranged on a beam, which has\na fulcrum, indicated by the triangle, at the centre. (a) The objects have mass m1 and m2 and are at\nhorizontal distances d1 and d2 from the fulcrum. The beam is balanced if m1.d1 = m2.d2. (b) More\ngenerally, if the positions of the two masses and the fulcrum are measured as distances,r1, r2, and R\nfrom an arbitrary horizontal position shown by the vertical dashed line, then the beam is balanced\nwhen R = (m1.r1 +m2.r2)/(m1 +m2) (see text), with the fulcrum being at the centre of mass.\nRoss's account, and by implication Arnheim's, is physicalist, as when Ross talks of how,\n'unequal attractions balance at distances inversely proportional to them'. Were Arnheim\nnot intending to be physicalist, then, having cited Ross, he would surely have felt obliged to\nclarify that his own interpretation was only metaphorical. For most of the rest of this paper\nwe will interpret the theory physically, using the standard ideas of elementary physics on\nidentification of a centre of gravity, or more generally the centre of mass (CoM), of a set of\nobjects. Figure 1a shows the situation of a simple balance, in which two objects of different\nmass, m1 and m2, are located at different horizontal distances, d1 and d2, from the fulcrum\nof the balance. The system is in static equilibrium, and tilts neither to left nor right if m1.d1 =\nm2.d2. In practice, a more useful calculation is to find the position of the fulcrum in relation\nto some arbitrary horizontal position, so that as in Figure 1b, the fulcrum and the two masses\nare at distances R, r1, and r2 from the arbitrary location. The fulcrum is then located at a\ndistance R from the arbitrary location, where R = (m1.r1 +m2.r2)/(m1 +m2). That formula\nthen generalises to n objects, using equation 1. Formula 1 can locate the horizontal CoM of\nany number of objects (and a directly equivalent formula can locate the CoM in the vertical\nor any other direction). In particular, as Figure 2 shows, the elements can be the pixels of a\nphotographic image in which the 'mass' or 'weight' of each pixel consists of the inverse of its\ngrey level (eg, white is regarded as 'light', and scored as 0, and black is regarded as 'heavy'\nand scored as 255, with other grey levels in between). It is therefore straightforward, for any\ngrey-level image, to calculate the centre of mass horizontally and vertically. An example\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 619\nanalysis of a monochrome image is shown in Figure 3. Superimposed on the image are\nseveral sets of lines. In particular, the blue line, g, running from left to right shows the average\nlightness (up = light, down = dark) of each of the 1,024 columns of pixels, and the yellow line,\nh, running from top to bottom shows the average lightness (left = dark, right = light) of each\nthe 768 horizontal rows of pixels. Using the formula provided above, those values can be used\nto locate the horizontal and vertical positions of the CoM, which is shown as the solid white\nsquare, i, which is .477 of picture width from the left of the image, and .455 of picture height\nfrom the bottom of the picture. The Arnheim\u00adRoss model suggests that the CoM should\nbe located on one of the main axes of the image, and the horizontal and vertical midlines,\nand the two diagonals are shown as solid red lines (c, d, e, f). The CoM in this case is not on\nany of the four axes specified by Arnheim. Expressed in units of picture width/height, the\nCoM is .023 units from the horizontal midline, .045 from the vertical midline, .048 from the\nmajor diagonal, and .016 from the minor diagonal, the axis to which it is closest. In this paper\nwe will define an image as 'on axis' when its CoM is within + 0.5% of standardised picture\nwidth/height of the vertical, horizontal, or diagonal axes. In the case of Figure 2 it is therefore\nthe case that the centre of mass does not meet that criterion, and although the closest axis is\nthe minor diagonal, the image as a whole is 'off axis'.\n|R| =\nn\nmi .ri\nn\nmi\nThe present paper tests some detailed predictions resulting from this physicalist interpre-\ntation of the Arnheim\u00adRoss model, described above, assessing the extent to which images\nthat are aesthetically satisfactory or superior have their centres of mass on one of the major\naxes, as Arnheim and Ross suggest. The five studies are complex, and readers might find it\nhelpful to have an overview of the structure of the paper and its broad conclusions at this\nstage. Study 1 investigates the location of the centre of mass in a large set of art photographs\nprinted in The Photography Book (Jeffrey 2005), comparing their location with an internal\nset of control images generated by sampling from the art photographs, and an external set\nof control images consisting of randomly taken photographs. To anticipate the results, art\nphotographs do indeed have their centres of mass closer to a major axis than do control\nimages, which supports the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory, although the test is relatively weak, since\nother processes may have resulted in those differences. Study 2 therefore provides a stronger\ntest of the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory, in which art photographs are manipulated, by means of\naltering gamma (in effect the contrast) of the images by different amounts in the horizontal\nand vertical directions, so that centres of mass are either moved to or from an axis. In a paired\ncomparison design, however, there was no evidence that subjects preferred images in which\nthe centre of mass was on an axis, providing no support for the Arnheim\u00adRoss model.\nStudies 3, 4, and 5 used a cropping paradigm, which we have described elsewhere\nof a 1024 x 768 image displayed on a computer screen, in a direct analogue of the way in\nwhich a camera is used to select or crop a portion of the visual world when a photograph\nis taken. The cropping task is also a close simulation of the procedure that Denman Ross\ndescribed: of moving a frame to determine 'just where the centre is ... depend[ing] upon visual\nsensitiveness or visual feeling'. Study 3 examined the photographic crops generated in the\nprevious study (McManus et al 2011) and compared their locations with the loci, suggested\nby the physical theory described earlier, which should produce balance with the centre of\nmass lying on one of the major axes. As the Arnheim\u00adRoss model predicts, the centres of\n620 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nFigure 2. Example of calculation of the centre of mass of an image.

The\n12 x 12 matrix shows the darkness or weight of each pixel (ie, 255 = black = heavy; 0 = white = light).\nThe table at the bottom show ri , the arbitrary horizontal distance of each pixel from the left-hand\nside, expressed as pixel number, the summed mass of each column of pixels, mi , and the product of\nmi and ri (mi .ri ). At the end of each row are the sums of ri and mi .ri , which are used to calculate R,\nthe position of the centre of mass (see main text for details), which is at 6.1 pixels from the left-hand\nside. The table at the right shows the equivalent calculations for the rows, with ri arbitrarily being the\nvertical distance from the top row of pixels. The centre of mass for the image as a whole is 7.4 pixels\nfrom the top and 6.1 pixels from the left, and those positions are shown by the red and green dashed\nlines in (b), with the intersection, shown by the white circle, being the centre of mass of the image.\nmass of cropped images were closer to major axes than were control images, although this is\na relatively weak test. Study 4 extended the analysis using a stronger test in what we have\ncalled the 'spiders-web' experiment; by analogy with Study 2, pairs of images were derived\nfrom the same images cropped in experiment 2, but one member of each pair was on a\nmajor axis,(2) and the other matched image was equidistant from adjacent major axes. In\nStudy 4 there was no support for the Arnheim\u00adRoss model. Study 5 also used the cropping\nparadigm, but instead of using real photographs, it instead used much simpler images based\non the example described by Arnheim, of two black disks, around which subjects were asked\nto position a frame, as Ross had suggested. The results with two black disks were broadly\nas Arnheim would have predicted, although that is a weak test. However, a stronger test\nconsiders the situation when one of the disks is grey rather than black, is smaller than the\nother disk, or when there is a grey-level ramp, running either vertically or horizontally across\nthe field. Although calculation in those cases suggests that croppings should be radically\ndifferent from Arnheim's example of two identical black disks, our participants framed the\nimages in precisely the same way as they framed two black disks, suggesting that the detailed\nArnheim\u00adRoss model is not supported.\n2 Study 1: The centre of mass in art photographs\nAny theory of aesthetics has to predict that works of art that are part of the recognised canon\nshould be different in some way from those that are of lesser quality, having been produced\n(2)A note on nomenclature. 'Horizontal' and 'vertical' are potentially very confusing. The axis running\nfrom top to bottom, is the vertical axis, which runs through the horizontal midline of the image, and if\nthe image is balanced, the horizontal CoM is on the vertical axis. We will therefore refer to the vertical\naxis (which relates to the horizontal CoM and the horizontal midline) and the horizontal axis (which\nrelates to the vertical CoM and the vertical midline).\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 621\nFigure 3. Illustration of the calculation of the centre of mass of a photograph, along with locations of\ncentres of mass of internal control images. Main image (a) shows a monochrome photograph of a coot,\nalong with (b) an enlarged detail from the centre of the analysed image. The vertical (c) and horizontal\n(d) red lines indicate the vertical axis and the horizontal axis of the image, and the red diagonal lines\nindicate the major diagonal axis (e) and the minor diagonal axis (f). The blue line (g) going from left to\nright indicates the lightness (up) or darkness (down) of each column of the image, and the yellow line\n(h) from top to bottom indicates the lightness (to right) or darkness (to left) of each row of the image.\nThe centre of mass of the image overall is shown by the white square with a black surround (i), and\nthe 289 (or 17 x 17) small coloured squares with black surrounds (eg, j, k, l, and m) correspond to the\nscaled centres of mass of the internal control images generated by systematically sampling all images\nof half the width and height of the complete image. In particular, j, k, l, and m correspond to the top\nleft, top right, bottom left, and bottom right quarters of the image, respectively (although the square\nfor j is overlaid with i). Original photograph is by one of the authors (ICM).\nby individuals who are not artists or representing works that are degraded in some way or\nanother. Although Arnheim in his later works avoided referring to 'the law of Pr\u00e4gnanz',\nnevertheless, as Verstegen has emphasised in a section entitled ' \"Goodness\" and beauty',\n'the idea that \"good\" Gestalten placed one on the road to explaining esthetic phenomena\nwas what so excited Arnheim in his early work' (Verstegen 2007, p. 12). It therefore seems\na straightforward prediction from the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory that accepted works of art of\nquality should show greater balance than those of lesser quality. That idea was tested in\nStudy 1 by looking at a large sample of representative 'art photographs' (for want of a better\nterm). Clearly, any such study requires a control group, and we describe two different types\nof controls, internal and external.\n2.2.1 Art photographs. These images were obtained from The Photography Book (Jeffrey\nphotographers, arranged alphabetically from A to Z, from Aarsman, Abbas, and Abbe\nto Zachmann, Zecchin, and Van der Zee. This corpus has the important advantage of\nbeing representative, and having only a single image from each photographer, we thereby\navoid statistical problems of non-independence. Photographs were included in the present\nstudy if they were single, rectangular images, without obvious technical blemishes or\npost-production alteration (eg, writing, painting, and so on). Images were scanned on a\nprofessional quality scanner (Epson Express 1640 XL), set at 300 dots per inch, 24 bit colour,\nthe unsharp masking filter set at medium, and the descreening filter in general mode. It\nshould be noted that the aspect ratio of the art photographs was not the same for all images.\n2.2.2 External controls. A series of 'random photographs' was taken by one of the authors\nstandard colour settings, autofocus and exposure, and the display turned off. The camera\n622 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nwas mostly held horizontal (except when photographing the ground) while walking down\nstreets or parks, sitting on buses or trains, in buildings, or other locations. An explicit attempt\nwas made to avoid pointing the camera at objects (and hence framing them), and often\nthe camera was held at the photographer's side so that he was not looking directly at the\nsubject of the photograph. Likewise, the shutter was pressed, where possible, at regular time\nintervals, such as every 15 s, to avoid bias. Similarly, the optical zoom of the camera was\nalso operated at random, to ensure images were as different as possible from one another.\nOverall, 595 photographs were available for use.\n2.2.3 Image analysis. Special purpose software was written using Matlab 7.5 with the\nPsychophysics Toolbox (Brainard 1997; Pelli 1997). Images in colour were converted to\nmonochrome using the decolorize routine, which is also written in Matlab (Grundland and\nDodgson 2007), and which has been shown psychophysically to give the most satisfactory\nconversion perceptually from colour to monochrome (Cadik 2009). The basic analysis of\nimages followed that which was described earlier and is described below in more detail\nand in the caption to Figure 3. Because the aspect ratio of the art photographs differed, the\nlocation of the centre of mass was described in terms of the proportion of the image width or\nheight (0 = left-hand side or bottom edge; 1 = right-hand side or top edge).\n2.2.4 Internal controls. An ideal control for any image would consist of scenes adjacent to\nthe image that the photographer might have chosen, but did not, since those images would\nhave similar contrast, lightness, colour balance, Fourier descriptors, and so on as those in\nthe original image, as well as similar content. Needless to say, such images are usually not\navailable. A compromise is to use alternative images within the actual photograph, a process\nthat can be conceptualised as examining sub-images that the photographer might have taken\nhad they used a lens of twice the focal length; such sub-images are half the width and half\nthe height (and hence a quarter of the area) of the original image. We looked at all possible\npositions of the sub-image on a grid within the original image, dividing the height and width\nof the original into 16 parts (ie, 17 possible positions for the left-hand edge of the sub-image,\nfrom the extreme left of the original image to the midline of the original, and likewise 17\npossible vertical positions for the top of the sub-image, from the top of the original image\nto its vertical midline). The CoM of these 17 x 17 = 289 sub-images was calculated in the\nstandard way and expressed as the proportion of the width and height of the sub-image. The\nCoMs, expressed as proportions of image size, can then be plotted on the original image (and\nfor comparative purposes, this is in terms of the proportions of the original image)--ie, if the\nCoM of a sub-image is exactly at the centre of the sub-image, then in Figure 3 it is plotted\nexactly at the centre of the original image so that if the corners of the sub-image are at [s, s]\nand [s + .5, s + .5], and the CoM is at (a, b), then the CoM is plotted at [2(a \u00ads), 2(b \u00ads)]).\nOverall, 455 art photographs and 595 random control images were analysed.\n2.3.1 Location of CoMs. Figure 4 shows the CoMs of the art photographs and the random\nphotographs. The Arnheim\u00adRoss model predicts that CoMs of art photographs should be\npreferentially located on the main axes (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), whereas the\nCoMs should be more evenly distributed in the random photographs. Using an arbitrary, but\nnevertheless strict criterion, a CoM was defined as being on an axis if it was within +0.5% of\npicture width/height from an axis (ie, including 1% of the total picture width or height). If\nCoMs were placed at random within the picture space, then about 4% of CoMs should meet\nthat criterion. However, Figure 4 shows that CoMs are not distributed randomly, but rather\nthe majority of CoMs are clustered around the middle of the image.

Table 1 shows that for the art photographs the\nCoMs of the sub-images used as internal controls are less likely to be located on an axis\n(43.5%) than is the case for the original images (46.6%). Statistical analysis of that result is\nnot, however, straightforward, as the sub-images are not independent. The Arnheim\u00adRoss\nmodel predicts that the CoM should be closer to an axis for the original images (but does not\nsay which axis the CoM should be closer to, so that, for sub-images, the distance is taken to\nthe nearest axis, whether or not that is the same axis as for the original image). For the jth\nof the i original images, let the distance to the nearest axis be dj . For each of the k control\nimages for the jth original image, let the nearest axis be at distance j pk. The variance of j pk\ndiffers greatly between images and is very skewed, making analysis difficult. As a result, for\n624 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\neach original image, j,dj is expressed as a percentile, qj , of the distribution of values of j pk\n(so that on average the expected value is 50% , with a value of qj less than 50% indicating\nthat dj is closer to an axis than the control values). As an example, it can be noted that for the\nimage in Figure 3 the CoM for the original image is on the 52nd percentile for the sub-image\ncontrols, meaning that it is marginally further from an axis than the set of sub-images. A\none-tailed t-test can then be used to test whether the distributions of values of qj across a\nset of images is significantly less than 50%.\n2.3.3 Distance from CoM to nearest axis. The Arnheim\u00adRoss model predicts that the CoM in\nart photographs should be closer to an axis than in internal controls derived from the image.\nThe shortest perpendicular distance to any of the four axes was calculated and expressed,\nas above, as a rank of the shortest perpendicular distance for the internal controls. The\naverage percentile rank for the art photographs was 46.32% (SE = 1.34), which is significantly\n2.3.4 Distance from CoM to image centre. A potential difference between the Arnheim and\nRoss theories is that Arnheim considers distance to the nearest axis whereas Ross considers\ndistance to the image centre (so that balance would be the same whatever the orientation\nof the image). The distance of the CoM to the centre must of necessity be greater than to\nthe nearest axis, and therefore we calculated distance to centre separately. In the original\nart photographs the CoM was a mean of .0444 (SD .0324) picture width/heights from the\ncentre, compared with .0516 (SD .0365) picture widths in the original random photographs,\n.0012). The distances to the centre in the original images and the internal controls were\ncompared using the percentile method described earlier. The original art photographs were\nphotographs therefore have a CoM closer to the centre than do random photographs, both\nby direct comparison and in relation to internal controls.\n2.3.5 Differences between horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes. Although Arnheim implies\nthat all four axes are important, that does not mean that CoMs are equally close to the\nfour axes. Table 2 shows the location of the nearest axis for the original images and the\ninternal controls. The internal controls, both for art photographs and random photographs,\nshow a very clear pattern, with a slight excess with the CoM closest to the vertical axis,\nprobably reflecting the fact that many objects, particularly in a man-made world, have mirror\nsymmetry around a vertical axis. Excluding cases where the CoM is closest to the vertical axis,\nthere is little difference in the proportion of cases which are closest to the horizontal axis or\neither of the diagonal axes, suggesting that in general only the vertical axis is privileged. The\noriginal versions of the random photographs, perhaps not surprisingly, show a very similar\npattern to the sub-images (and, of course, if the focal length had been different, they could\nhave been random sub-images), with a predominance only of the vertical axis. In contrast,\nthe original art photographs show a significantly different pattern from the random original\nphotographs (Chi-squared = 29.58, 3 d f ,p<.001), and also the control sub-images, with a\nsubstantial excess of CoMs closest to the vertical axis, a deficit of images with a CoM closest\nto the horizontal axis, and with the proportions closest to a diagonal axis being similar to the\nrandom photographs and all of the control sub-images.\n2.3.6 Historical shifts. A prediction from the Arnheim\u00adRoss model might be that good\ncomposition, as expressed through balance, would have to be learned. Particularly for\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 625\nTable 2. Results of Study 1. 'On axis' indicates that the CoM was within 0.5% of an axis.\nNearest axis The Photography Book Random images\nOriginal\nimages\nInternal\ncontrols\nOriginal\nimages\nInternal\ncontrols\nVertical\nHorizontal\nDiagonal 1\nDiagonal 2\nphotography, where there was initially no experience of estimating balance in photographs,\nit might be expected that there would be a learning process over time, so that later images\nshould be more balanced than earlier images (ie, a negative correlation with date). We\ntested that possibility by looking at the correlation between distance to the nearest axis and\nthe date of production of a photograph. Based on 452 photographs, the correlation was\n2.3.7 Non-linear modelling. The modelling so far has been based on the simple linear model\nof equation 1 in which the turning moment of the ith mass, mi , at a distance, di , from\nthe fulcrum, is simply mi.di, and hence averaged across all i masses, balance occurs when\n(mi x di ) = 0. Although the equation works in physics, it may not be appropriate for\npsychophysics, where the mass, m, and the effect of distance, d, may not scale linearly. A more\ngeneral equation is therefore,  [ f (mi ) \u00d7 g(di )] = 0, where mass is a non-linear function,\nf (.) of m, and distance is a non-linear function, g(.) of d. Clearly, there is an infinite number\nof such functions, and therefore here we will merely consider two intuitively reasonable\npossibilities, in order to assess their possible influence on CoM and their implications for the\nArnheim\u00adRoss model. It should also be noted that, unlike the equation  (mi x di ) = 0, the\nequation  [f (mi ) \u00d7 g(di )] = 0 cannot readily be converted to a form such as that in equation\n1, and in the general case it has to be solved iteratively rather than analytically.\nFor photographs the obvious non-linear transformation of m is the gamma correction\nfunction, which is much used in digital image analyses, where m = m, and intensities\nare scaled in the range 0 to 1. When  = 1, the image is unchanged; when  > 1, the image is\nsystematically (but non-linearly) darkened; and when  < 1, the image is lightened overall. For\nthe effect of distance from the fulcrum, an equivalent non-linear transformation is d = dp,\nwhere the effect of m is proportional to the pth power of its distance from the fulcrum (and\nwe refer to p as the 'distance power'). For p > 1, distant masses have a proportionately greater\neffect on the turning moment than when p = 1. A straightforward model would therefore\nseem to be:\nn\nm\ni\n.r p\ni\nA moment's reflection, however, reveals that there is a problem with this model, as the\nvalues of di are usually distributed to the right and the left of the fulcrum, with some having\nnegative signs and others positive. However, if these values are squared (ie, p = 2), then all\n626 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nare positive, and the equation cannot be solved. A solution is to raise the absolute value of di\nto the power p, and multiply it by the sign of di , as shown in equation (3).\nn\n(m\ni\n.sign(di ).|dp\ni\nIn order to keep the problem tractable, the model has been fitted to the images from\nandp = 1 is equivalent to equation 1). Without giving examples, suffice it to say that the\neffect of such gamma corrections on the photographs is visually quite dramatic (and for\nexamples of gamma corrections in general, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction).\nGamma corrections to the images were applied to entire images using the imadjust function\nin Matlab, and equation 3 was then solved using the fsolve function.\nTable 3 compares the effect of the three levels of  and p for the 455 images from The\nPhotograph Book. Columns 3 and 4 show the mean difference in position of the CoM\ncompared with CoM for  = 1 and p = 1. Altering  and p hardly alters the location of\nthe CoM, with means very close to zero (and typically less than .001--ie, one thousandth of\npicture width or height). Likewise the CoM correlates very highly with the X and Y positions\nof the CoM for  = 1 and p = 1, all correlations being higher than .965. Finally, columns 6\nand 7 show the mean percentile for the original image (after  and p have been altered),\ncompared with the internal control images. All percentiles are less than 48.66%, and in five\nof the nine cases, reach significance with p < .05. Overall, the conclusion has to be that the\nresults are robust against quite large changes in  and p.\nTable 3. Analyses of effects of altering gamma and distance power on location of CoM for the 455\nimages from The Photograph Book. Note that when  = 1 and p (Distance Power) = 1, then the analysis\nis equivalent to that presented previously.\n p Mean (SD) distance of\nCoM from CoM for  = 1\nCorrelation with CoM\nposition for  = 1 and\nPercentile of original full\nimage versus internal\ncontrols\nMean SD Mean\npercentile\nOne-tailed\nt-test\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 627\nThis descriptive study of a representative selection of high quality art photographs, which\ncan be regarded as canonical, has a number of interesting findings. The art photographs\nwere compared with external controls (a large set of random photographs taken by one of\nthe authors) and a set of internal controls produced by sampling from within the image itself.\nIn each case it was clear that art photographs have a CoM which is closer to an axis, and also\ncloser to the image centre, than is the case for random images. All images show a tendency\nto be closer to the vertical axis than other axes (probably because many objects in the visual\nworld show mirror symmetry about the vertical axis), but while random images show an\nequal distribution about the horizontal axis and the two diagonal axes, art photographs are\nless likely to have a CoM close to the horizontal axis.\nA possible problem for Study 1 is that the reproductions of the images from The\nPhotography Book are not exact. The original printed photographs have themselves been\nphotographed for the books, they have been printed, and they have then been scanned.\nEach process has its own characteristics, described most clearly by its gamma function. A\nconcern has to be that if the gamma functions change, then the CoM will itself also change.\nWe examined this possibility before commencing the study and found that altering gamma\nacross an entire image, within a reasonable range, produced hardly any change in the CoM\nat all. We therefore felt confident that our analyses conform to any reasonable differences in\nreproduction of the images. The analyses of Table 3 confirm that intuition systematically,\nlarge alterations in , and indeed alterations also of p, not substantially altering either the\nlocation of the CoM or the statistical significance of the results. Of course, in the extreme,\nalterations of  and p must result in non-significant results. When  = 0 or  = , then the\nimage will be entirely black or entirely white, and the CoM must then be precisely at the\ncentre both for the original image and the internal controls. Likewise, as p tends to 0, then\nthe fulcrum is at the median of the masses, and as p tends to infinity, so all pixels to right\nand left of the physical centre equally influence balance, and the CoM must be at the centre.\nFinally, it should be emphasised that the alterations of gamma were applied uniformly across\nthe entire image (in contrast to the 'gamma-ramp' experiment in Study 2).\nAlthough not a strong test of the Arnheim\u00adRoss model of balance, the present results are\ncompatible with it, the CoM of recognised works of art being closer to a major axis than is the\ncase in control images. Other processes could, however, result in that finding, particularly\nif, say, a large dark mass symmetrically fills most of the central area of a photograph (as in\nsome portraits or still lifes), as then the CoM will be constrained to the image centre, and any\nsub-image will be unlikely to show such symmetry, and hence the CoM will be less close to\nthe centre (and hence less close to an axis). Likewise, the random control photographs are\nless likely to contain such symmetrically placed central images.\nA stricter test of the Arnheim\u00adRoss hypothesis is therefore required, which uses experi-\nmental manipulation of the canonical images, so that the CoM is either on, or is not on, an\naxis.\n3 Study 2: The Gamma\u00adRamp experiment\nThe Arnheim\u00adRoss theory says that an image should be preferred more if it has its CoM on\none of the major axes and should be preferred less if the CoM is off a major axis. Study 2 uses\na simple method to move the CoM while retaining the content of the image.\nThe concept of gamma adjustment is much used in image processing, mainly for adjusting\nthe properties of cameras, scanners, printers, and monitors, to take into account the differing\nnon-linearities of the various devices, which otherwise make images appear too dark or\n628 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nalternatively appear as washed-out. Photographers of the old school who have worked with\npaper and chemicals in darkrooms will also remember that printing paper used to come in\nvarious degrees of 'hardness', hard paper producing very contrasty, black-and-white prints,\nwhereas soft paper has less contrast, so that the darker tones are more similar to the lighter\ntones. Gamma for computer-generated images is straightforward to adjust, and normally, as\nwith hard or soft paper in a darkroom, a single value of gamma is chosen for the entire image.\nHowever, with a computer it is also possible to adjust gamma so that it varies linearly across\nan image, be it up-down or from left-right (or both). If the gradient is kept small, the effects\nare subtle, but a consequence is that the centre of mass moves on or off of axes, according to\nthe values that are chosen. In effect, the image is being printed on paper which is harder or\nsofter in some parts than others.\nFigure 5. The bridge at Chantilly by Edouard-Denis Baldus (1855). Overlaying the image are\nthe horizontal, vertical and diagonal axes (in grey), and the centre of mass (shown as a white\nsquare). The blue line shows the lightness of the columns (light up and dark down) , and the\nyellow line the lightness of the rows (light to right and dark to left). (a) Original photograph in\nwhich the centre of mass is between axes. (b) Gamma ramps have been imposed vertically and\nhorizontally, which have moved the centre of mass so that it is the same standardised distance\nfrom the image centre but is now on the vertical axis. Most of the adjustment has been hor-\nizontally (blue line), and a careful comparison of the two images will show subtle differences,\nwhich are responsible for moving the centre of mass. Note: This image was not one of those\nactually used in Study 2 but is used here as an illustration since it is in The Photography Book,\nthough its date is out of copyright (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%C3%89douard_Baldus_-\n_Paysage_Pris_du_Viaduc_de_Chantilly.jpg).\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 629\nThe effects of the gamma-ramp adjustment can be seen in Figure 5, where at the top\nis the original version of an art photograph in which the CoM is between axes, and at the\nbottom is a modified version in which the CoM has been moved so that although remaining\nat the same standardised distance from the centre, it is now on the vertical axis. Comparison\nof the horizontal weights (the blue lines) will show that the left side in Figure 5b is slightly\nlighter and the right side is slightly darker than in Figure 5a, which has shifted the CoM to the\nright and on to the vertical axis. There are also small changes vertically to ensure the CoM is\nstill the same distance from the image centre.\nIn Study 2 the CoM of art photographs has been moved slightly, typically by about 20 or so\ndegrees, keeping the distance of the CoM from the image centre constant, but either moving\nthe CoM from an axis so that it is instead midway between axes, or alternatively moving\na CoM which is midway between axes in the original so that it is precisely on an axis. The\nArnheim\u00adRoss model should predict that preference will be higher for images which have\nthe CoM on an axis rather than off it.\nExamination of the two images in Figure 5 shows that they are extremely similar, to the\npoint that, in a preliminary study, it was found that a conventional paired-comparison design,\nwith the images placed side-by-side, was extremely hard for participants to carry out, the\ntwo images appearing almost indistinguishable. However, it was also found that if the two\nimages were overlaid and the viewer swapped back and forth between the two images, then\nthe differences became much clearer. A successive paired comparison design was therefore\ndeveloped in which one of the images randomly came upon the screen, and then at each\npress of a key the two images swapped. Participants were allowed to alternate as many times\nas they wished before they indicated which of the pair they preferred.\n3.2.1 Stimuli. Twenty images were chosen from The Photography Book in which the CoM of\nthe original image was on an axis ('On') and was a moderate distance away from the image\ncentre. Gamma ramps were then used to produce a modified image ('OnToOff'), in which\nthe CoM was moved so that it was off-axis, being midway between the original axis and the\nnext axis around (half clockwise and half anti-clockwise), keeping constant the distance of\nthe CoM from the image centre. Twenty original images were also used in which the CoM\nof the original image was midway between axes ('Off'), and was also a moderate distance\nfrom the image centre, and gamma ramps were used to modify those images so that the CoM\nwas on an adjacent axis ('OffToOn'), randomly clockwise or anti-clockwise. The CoM was\nmoved by a special purpose Matlab program, which used an optimisation procedure to find\nthe appropriate gamma ramps in order to move the CoM to the required position.\n3.2.2 Procedure. Participants were asked to compare the original version of an image with its\nmodified version (ie, On with OnToOff or Off with OffToOn). A successive paired comparison\ndesign was used (see above), and when participants had decided which of the two images\nthey preferred, they then indicated by how much they preferred it to the other image on a\nthree-point scale (Very much, Quite a lot, Not much).\nParticipants. A total of 38 participants took part, who had also taken part in Study 6 of\nMcManus et al (2011). Ten participants were experts (8 male, 2 female; mean (median) age =\n26.8 (28.5), SD=3.12), all of whom had attended art school and were professionally involved in\nthe visual arts. Twenty-eight participants were non-experts and were a convenience sample,\nmostly but not entirely consisting of undergraduates at University College London (4 male,\nparticipation.\nEthics. Ethical approval for this and the other studies was given by the Ethics Committee\nof the Department of Psychology of University College London.\n630 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nAlthough participants in effect made judgements on a six-point scale, for simplicity of\nanalysis the responses were treated as binary, as a preference for one of the stimuli in a pair.\nThe sequential paired comparison method worked well, with participants making an average\nof 4.8 alternations on each trial, looking at the stimuli for an average of 7.3 s before making a\npreference.\n3.3.1 Preference for On-Axis images. Each participant made 40 judgements, with one member\nof each stimulus pair having the CoM on-axis and the other having it off-axis. Table 4 shows\nfor the off-axis image. The mean percentage of on-axis preferences by the 38 subjects was\n(t = -1.384,37d f ,p = .175). Neither was there any significant difference in the percentage\nof times the on-axis image was preferred by the experts (mean = 47.75%, SE = 2.06%) or the\ncorrect), which is what would be expected by chance with 38 participants.\nTable 4. Results of Study 2, expressed in two ways, (top) in relation to whether the on axis or off axis\nimage was preferred, and (bottom) whether the original or the modified image was preferred.\nPreferred Off Axis Preferred On Axis\nPreferred Modified Image Preferred Original Image\n3.3.2 Preference for original images. In each pair, one image was an original and one was\npreferences for original images (SE = .62), which is significantly different from a chance\nNineteen participants were significantly better individually than chance with p<.05, whereas\nnone were significantly worse than chance (range 67.5% to 80.0%); the group significantly\nbetter than chance included 9 of the 10 experts.\n3.3.3 Analysis by images. Analysis at the level of the 40 individual photographs showed that\noverall there was no overall preference for the images on-axis (mean percentage = 48.42%; SD\nshowed preferences that were significant (p<.05) for the on-axis image, and 11 (27.5%) were\nsignificant for the off-axis image. These differences in fact reflect differences in preference\nfor the original image. Overall there was a highly significant preference for original images\nFor one photograph only (2.5%) was there an individual significance at the p<.05 level of\nsignificance for the non-original image, and that can probably be put down as a chance\nphenomenon.\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 631\nThe manipulation of gamma ramps provides a strong, experimental test of the Arnheim\u00adRoss\nmodel, in large part because the images are very similar--indeed, differing almost entirely\nin the location of the CoM (to the extent that a simple paired comparison is probably too\ndifficult for most participants). The sequential paired comparison design worked well, but\nthere was no evidence that participants, be they expert or non-expert, had any preference\nfor images where the CoM was on-axis rather than off-axis. However, and it is an important\nmethodological and theoretical point, there were clear preferences for original over modified\nimages, and that was despite the differences between images being quite subtle, and, of\nparticular interest, the preference was stronger in the experts compared with the non-experts.\nThe implication is that, even if it is not the CoM that is the crucial aspect of the organisation\nof an image, there has to be some property that is being perceived by the participants and\nwhich is telling them that an original image is preferable to a modified image.\n4 Study 3: Cropping of photographs\nAn important feature of Study 1 was that it used photographs which are of recognised\naesthetic quality. A major problem, however, is that in most cases one has little sense of what\nthe image might have looked like had the photographer chosen to take a slightly different\nphotograph, moving the camera up or down, to right or left, and so on. There are, of course,\noccasional exceptions, as when one can examine the contact prints of photographers such\nas Diane Arbus (Lee 2003) or Henri Cartier-Bresson (2006), but mostly we have no sense\nof the choices made by a photographer. Study 3 used a different method, based on the\ncropping paradigm which has been described elsewhere (McManus et al 2011), in which\nparticipants see a large image and then crop it down to half of its size (a quarter of its area).\nThe psychometrics of the method have been described in detail in the previous paper. Study\n3, which re-analyses data collected previously, asks whether the cropped images that are\nchosen have a CoM that lies closer to a major axis than would be expected by random\ncropping. The Arnheim\u00adRoss model predicts that they should.\nFigure 6 shows an example of one of the images used in the cropping experiment. The\nsmall inner yellow box is the Inclusion Box, which must be included in any cropping. As a\nresult, the crop window cannot be outside the area delineated by the outer yellow box, and\nthe midpoint of any possible crop window cannot be outside the middle yellow box. The\nindividual red and pink squares are the centres of the crop windows for non-experts and\nexperts, respectively.\n4.1.1 The balance loci. The green, blue, purple, and pink lines are complicated, but each\nindicates a 'balance locus' at which for a sub-image centred at that point, the image would\nbe balanced around the vertical axis (green), horizontal axis (blue), major diagonal (purple),\nor minor diagonal (pink). Thus, for instance, consider the green line. If a sub-image, of size\n512 x 384 pixels, had its centre anywhere on this green line, then the sub-image would be\nbalanced precisely around the vertical axis (but not necessarily around the other axes). The\norange box indicates the area of all possible image midpoints, irrespective of whether the\nInclusion Box is included, and the balance loci are plotted for that entire area. Where the\nfour lines for the separate balance loci intersect is the location of the centre of a sub-image\nwhich is balanced around all four axes, and that sub-image necessarily has its CoM precisely\nat its physical centre. Note that there can be one, several, or no points in an image at which\nall four balance loci intersect, and in Figure 6 there are two such locations, although the one\ntowards the upper-left corner would not be legitimate for the cropping experiment, given the\n632 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nFigure 6. An example of the results of the cropping experiment from Study 3. The small yellow box is\nthe Inclusion Box, the outer yellow box is the limits for a crop, given the size of the inclusion box, and\nthe middle yellow box is the limits of the midpoints of the crops, given the Inclusion Box. The red and\npink squares are the centres of the crops made by the individual participants (red: non-experts; pink:\nexperts). The blue, green, purple, and pink lines indicate the loci of the centres of crops, which would\nhave their CoM on the vertical, horizontal, major diagonal, and minor diagonal axes, respectively. The\norange box shows the limits for the midpoints of all possible images, and the balance loci are also\nshown for all possible midpoints, including those not permitted by the Inclusion Box.\nlocation of the Inclusion Box. Later, in Figure 11, will be seen images in which there is only a\nsingle balance locus, and hence there is no possible intersection for all four balance loci.\nThe data re-analysed here are described more fully in Study 4 of McManus et al (2011), and\nonly a brief description is necessary here.\n4.2.1 Procedure. In the viewing phase, participants firstly saw a photograph of size 1024 x\n768 pixels, which filled the screen of a computer monitor. They were allowed to look at the\nphotograph for as long as they liked, and then a click of the mouse button moved to the\ncropping phase in which a region of the photograph of size 512 x 384 pixels was visible to the\nparticipant. Moving the computer mouse moved the visible region, and the participant had\nas long as they wished in order to explore possible locations for the crop, clicking the mouse\nwhen the image 'looked best'. In each image there was an 'Inclusion Box' \u00ad a region of the\nimage which can be regarded as the 'subject' of the picture, and which the software ensured\nwas included in any crop. As a result not all positions of the cropping window on the screen\nwere possible.\n4.2.2 Stimuli. Although participants saw 80 images in the original study, some images\nwere repeated, and others were presented in variant forms such as in monochrome or\nas thresholded image. Only the first 30 images will therefore be analysed here, which were all\nin full colour and being seen for the first time.\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 633\n4.2.3 Participants. Of 51 participants, 10 were experts in the visual arts, having degrees in the\nvisual arts and being on the MA course in photography at the Royal College of Art. The other\n41 participants were non-experts, typically undergraduates at University College London.\nA similar analysis was carried out to that used in analysing art photographs in Study 1. For\neach cropped image produced by each subject, the distance of the CoM to the nearest axis\nwas calculated. A set of control images was generated, which systematically sampled the\nrange of possible crop window positions, taking into account the constraints of the Inclusion\nBox, and for each the distance of the CoM to the nearest axis was calculated. The distance to\nthe nearest axis for the actual crop window was calculated as a percentile of the distribution\nof distances for all possible crop windows, with lower percentiles meaning that the actual\ncrop window was closer to an axis than was the case in the control images.\nConsidering all 1,530 croppings, the CoM was on average 5.86 pixels from an axis (SD\nThose values cannot be directly compared statistically, as they are not independent of one\nSE 0.69) compared with the control croppings. The percentiles for each participant were\nAn analysis was also carried out at the level of the 30 images, the percentile being\nexamination of the individual means for each image found that although 47 of the 51 were\nStudy 3 shows that participants in a cropping study, in which a fixed image is cropped to\nhalf of its size, produce crops whose CoMs are closer to an axis than would be the case for\nrandom croppings of the same image, and that is compatible with the Arnheim\u00adRoss model.\nThe result is somewhat stronger than the similar analysis with the art photographs, not only\nbecause the effect is much larger in percentile terms, but also because all of the control\nimages were possible choices for the participants in the experiment. However, as with Study\n1, the result provides only weak support for the Arnheim\u00adRoss model itself, since it is possible\nthat other factors (such as preferences for overall symmetry, etc) are producing the result,\nrather than it being dependent on the relationship of the CoM to an axis. That possibility is\nseen in Figure 6, where a number of the crops are centred on the centre of the flower, and\nhence are close to several of the axes. It is also of interest that experts do not produce crops\nthat are closer to an axis than do non-experts.\n5 Study 4: The Spiders-Web experiment\nAlthough the data on cropping, in Study 3, are compatible with the Arnheim\u00adRoss model,\nthey are not a strong support for it, as many other factors may differ between the cropped\nimages and the control images. Study 4, which we call the Spiders-Web experiment, is, like\n634 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nStudy 2, the gamma-ramp experiment, designed to control many of the differences that may\noccur between a cropped image and the controls used in Study 3 and to produce paired\nimages which differ almost entirely because one has a CoM on an axis and the other does\nnot.\nFigure 7. The design of the Spider-Web experiment. See Introduction to Study 4 for details. The image\nin the bottom left-hand corner shows an enlargement of the key area.\nThe design of the experiment can best be understood by looking at Figure 7. As in Figure 6,\nthe image shows the green, blue, purple, and pink lines which are the balance loci for the\ncentre of a cropped image which has its CoM on one of those four axes. The dark green lines\nin Figure 7, which are similar in some ways to a spider's web, and hence the name, are the loci\nof balance points on individual balance loci which are equidistant from the physical centre\nof the sub-image. Consider just one of those dark green lines, for which the intersections\nwith the green, blue, purple, and pink lines have been indicated by red circles. The images\ncorresponding to these red circles all have a CoM on precisely one axis, and those CoMs are\nequidistant from the physical centre of the corresponding sub-image. In contrast, the orange\ncircles indicate the centres of sub-images which are the same distance from the physical\ncentre of the corresponding sub-image as are the red circles, but are not on any axis, and are\nindeed exactly midway between any two axes. The prediction for the Arnheim\u00adRoss model is\nthat there should be a preference for images based on the red circles compared with those\nbased on the orange circles. If adjacent red and orange circles are used in a pair, then the\ncontent of the images should differ only very slightly, meaning that the preference should be\na preference based almost entirely on composition, and particularly on balance, rather than\non content.\n5.2.1 Procedure. A conventional paired comparison experiment was carried out in which,\nas a part of a larger preference experiment, participants saw a series of 16 pairs of images\nwhich used the Spider-Web method, to make one image in each pair have its CoM on an\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 635\naxis, while the CoM of the other image was between adjacent axes. Participants responded\non a 6-point scale (Strong, Medium, or Weak preference for the left-hand image or Weak,\nMedium, or Strong preference for the right-hand image). Participants were allowed to work\nat their own pace.\n5.2.2 Stimuli. Examination of the loci for balance on the four axes in a large number of\nimages used in previous experiments found that many images do not show loci for balance\non all four axes, and as a result have no point at which the exact mid-centre of the image is\nalso at the CoM. Four images were identified from the set used in previous experiments in\nwhich there was a four-way intersection, and it was also possible to have a spider's web in\nwhich the contour of equidistant from the centre was sufficiently far from the intersection.\nFour pairs of images, one on-axis and the other off-axis, were then generated from each of\nthese four images, making 16 pairs altogether. On-axis members of the pair were presented\nrandomly to right or left in each pair.\n5.2.3 Participants. The participants in this study were the same 38 participants (10 experts,\n28 non-experts) as in Study 2.\nThe 6-point preference judgements, for ease of analysis, were reduced to 2-point preferences,\nfor either the on-axis or off-axis image. Overall, 608 preferences were made, of which 259\nEach of the 38 participants made 16 preferences, with a mean of 42.6% for the on-axis\nimage (SD 12.4%; SE 2.01%), which is significantly less than the 50% expected by chance\noccasions (SD 13.2%), compared with the non-experts on 43.8% of occasions (SD 9.8%), a\nThe Spider-Web experiment provides no support for the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory, as in images\nwhich are minimally different apart from one image having the CoM on-axis and the other\noff-axis, there was no preference for the on-axis image. Indeed, it is striking that there is a\nsignificant preference for the off-axis image. The reasons for that are far from clear, but while\nnot supporting the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory, they do suggest that the participants are making\nmeaningful judgements of some sort, and that there is agreement between the participants.\nWhat the features are which produce that preference are not obvious at present.\nIn many ways the result of Study 4 is similar to that of Study 2. In each case there was a\nweak result (in Study 1 and Study 3) which supported the Arnheim\u00adRoss model (but could\nhave been due to other factors as well), but then a much more focussed experiment, in one\ncase using the Gamma-Ramp, in the other the Spider-Web, found no support for a very\nspecific prediction from the theory.\nTaken together, Studies 2 and 4 suggest that at least when looking at complex photo-\ngraphic images, there is no preference for images which are balanced in the sense of the\nphysicalist model proposed by Ross and Arnheim. At that point one has to wonder whether\nthe model even works for much simpler images of the type that Arnheim uses in chapter 2 of\nArt and Visual Perception of two black disks placed in a square frame, and that is investigated\nin Study 5.\n6 Study 5: Cropping of Arnheim's own geometric stimulus\nArnheim, in Figures 5a and 5b of Art and Visual Perception (p. 18) (reproduced here as Figures\n8a and 8b), shows two square frames, the first of which (a) has two black disks arranged along\n636 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nthe main diagonal, symmetrically around the mid-point. In the second frame (b) the same\ntwo disks are moved so that one is now at the exact centre of the image and the other further\nalong the diagonal, about midway between the midpoint and the top right-hand corner.\nAfter comparing them, Arnheim goes on to say that:\nLike a physical body, every finite visual pattern has a fulcrum or center of gravity. And just\nas the physical fulcrum of even the most irregularly shaped flat object can be determined by\nlocating the point at which it will balance on the tip of a finger, so the center of a visual pattern\ncan be determined by trial and error. According to Denman W. Ross, the simplest way to do\nthis is to move a frame around the pattern until the frame and pattern balance; then the center\nof the frame coincides with the weight center of the pattern (p. 19).\nStudy 5 does exactly what Arnheim suggests, both with his figure (and the two versions are\nequivalent once the frame can move around the two disks) and with a range of related images.\nArnheim considers only a square frame, but we also consider rectangular frames, and in\naddition make the two disks of different sizes, make one of them grey, and also place a light-\ngrey/dark-grey ramp horizontally or vertically behind the disks. All of these manipulations\nwould be expected to alter the location of the CoM, and hence the optimal position of the\nframe. We also investigate right-left and top-down asymmetries since Arnheim suggests\nthat each of them will alter the apparent balance of an image (Arnheim 1974, pp. 30 & 33).\nA point not discussed by Arnheim, despite most painted and photographic images having\nrectangular rather than square frames (Fechner 1876), is that what Palmer and Guidi (2011)\ncall the 'structural skeleton' of a rectangle is more complex than that of a square. As Palmer\n(1991) suggests, for a rectangle, there is global symmetry around the horizontal and vertical\nmidlines, but there is also an area of 'local symmetry' which runs at 45 degrees from the\ncorners and does not intersect with the centre of the rectangle.\nThe method follows the cropping procedure described elsewhere (McManus et al 2011), and\nalso briefly described above for Study 3.\n6.2.1 Procedure. The procedure was similar to that for Study 3. Participants firstly, to ensure\nthat they understood the nature of the cropping task using real photographs, cropped a series\nof 40 photographic images, including ten repeats, that have been used in several previous\nstudies. In these cases the overall image size was 1024 x 768 pixels, which filled the screen of\na computer monitor, and the crop window was 512 x 384 pixels. Subjects then saw a series of\n24 abstract images similar to that described by Arnheim and were asked to crop these in a\nsimilar way to that in which the photographs were cropped. The first 20 images also used a\ncrop window of 512 x 384 pixels, and the last four used a square crop window, of size 384 x\n384 pixels, in order to reproduce Arnheim's Figure 5a.\n6.2.2 Stimuli. The stimuli were divided into four sets, the members of which were presented\nin random order, with the exception of the four images with a square crop window, which\nwere presented last. The four sets are shown in Figure 8 to Figure 11. In each case the Inclusion\nBox was set so that the two large disks set at 45 degrees had to just be included. The figures\nalso show the location of the balance loci along the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal axes.\nThe sets consisted of:\n1. Square images similar to those used by Arnheim (Figures 8c\u00adf). Figure 8c replicated\nthe Arnheim stimulus as closely as possible. For a 384-by-384-pixel square frame the\ndisks were of diameter 149 pixels and were 205 pixels apart. The black disks had a\ngrey level of 0. As in Arnheim, the disks are on a 45-degree diagonal. A point of some\ninterest in Arnheim is that he considers a square frame so that the diagonal is at 45\ndegrees. However, since most of our work has used a frame with an aspect ratio of 4:3,\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 637\nFigure 8. Panel (a) and (b) show the simple images described by Arnheim, with a square frame and\ntwo black disks. Panels (c) to (f) show the results of Study 5, in which the participants followed the\nprocedure described by Ross, and placed the frame around the disks until the position looked best.\nNote that unlike Figure 6, in which one sees the centres of all frames in relation to the entire set of\npossible positions on the screen, Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 reverse the process and show just the average\ncropping window (see text) in which the preferred placings of the disks are shown along with the\nindividual preferences relative to that average. What one sees is therefore what a typical participant\nwould say is the best location of the disks within a frame. As in Figure 6, the blue, green, purple,\nand pink lines indicate the loci of the centres of crops which would have their CoM on the vertical,\nhorizontal, major diagonal, and minor diagonal axes, respectively. If on average the participants have\na preferred position that is on an axis, then the intersection of the red cross-hairs should be on a\ncoloured line.\nfor which the diagonal is at an angle of 36.9 degrees, Figure 8e uses the same two disks\nwith that angle. Note that having the disks at an angle of 36.9 degrees does not alter\nthe predictions of the model (shown as the balance loci) because the frame is square.\nFigures 8d and 8f are similar to Figures 8c and 8e, except that the upper disk has a grey\nlevel of 192 (black = 0; white = 255). A prediction of the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory is that\nhaving one light grey disk should shift the balance point (and the intersection of the\nbalance loci in panels d and f have shifted towards the black disk, and is also now no\nlonger the same in Figures 8d and 8f).\n2. Anisotropy of left-right and up-down. Arnheim suggests that objects in images are\nheavier at the top of the image and on the right of the image. Figure 9 shows four\nimages in which there is a standard black disk, and also a grey disk (grey level 192)\nwhich is placed at top left (Figure 9a), top right (Figure 9c), bottom left (Figure 9b), or\nbottom right (Figure 9d). If anisotropies exist, then right and left and top and down\nshould not be mirror images of one another (although they are isotropic in the model).\n3. Variation in size and greyness of one of the disks. A smaller disk should weigh less than\none that is larger, as also should one that is visually lighter. Figure 10 shows 12 stimuli\nwhich systematically varied the size and greyness of the upper left-hand disk. The disks\non the top row (a, d, g, j) are of standard size; those on the middle row (b, e, h, k) have\nhalf the area of a standard disk (and hence the diameter is 1/sqrt(2) of the standard\ndisk). The disks on the bottom row (c, f, i, l) have a diameter half that of the standard\n638 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\ndisk (and hence a quarter the area). The disks in the first column are all black (grey\nlevel = 0), whereas the upper disk in columns two, three, and four have grey levels of 64,\n128, and 192. As the upper disk gets smaller and lighter-grey, so the intersection of the\nbalance loci moves towards the lower black disk, so that in Figure 10l the intersection\nof the balance loci is actually within the large black disk.\n4. Grey-level ramps in the background. If the disks are placed on a background that shows\na linear ramp, from lighter grey to darker grey, as in Figure 11, then that has important\nimplications for the Arnheim\u00adRoss model. In effect, it is only possible to balance around\none of the axes, there being no balance points for the other three axes. Thus, the vertical\nramp in Figure 11a and Figure 11c means that there can be symmetry only around the\nvertical axis, and the horizontal ramp in Figure 11b and Figure 11d means that there\ncan be symmetry only around the horizontal axis. The horizontal ramps varied from\ngrey levels of 0 to 234 across the entire image width of 1024 pixels, therefore by about\n117 greyscale units across the crop window. Likewise, the vertical ramps varied from 0\nacross the crop window. A subtle point about, say, images 11a and 11c, is that the green\nline is closer to the upper disk in 11a and to the lower disk in 11b. That occurs because\ntwo areas of lighter grey and darker grey have been replaced by two areas which are\nequal in their blackness, and hence the balance point shifts slightly towards the disk in\nthe lighter part of the image. An equivalent effect can be seen in Figures 11b and 11d.\nFigure 9. As for Figure 8, but for the four images used to assess top-down and left-right anisotropy.\nNote that the crop window in these images, and those of Figures 10 and 11, is rectangular in a 4:3\naspect ratio, rather than, as in Figure 8, a square.\n6.2.3 Participants. Thirty-six non-expert participants (12 male, 18 female) took part from the\nsubject pool at University College London and were paid for their participation. The mean\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 639\nFigure 10. As for Figure 8, but for the 12 images assessing the effect of having a smaller or a lighter-grey\ndisk in the top right-hand position.\nFigure 11. As for Figure 8, but assessing the effect of placing a grey ramp from top to bottom, bottom\nto top, left to right or right to left.\nIn Figures 8 to 11 the red box with the cross hairs at its centre shows the midpoint of the\nchosen crop window on each task (and hence, unlike Figure 6, the entire image space is not\nshown). An interesting feature of these data is that in 25% of cases (216/864) the participants\nhave chosen points which lie on one of the limits of the positions the crop window can\noccupy, with 94 cases (10.9%) where the chosen point is in one of the corners. These limits\nwere imposed because to allow the participants to crop further would be to crop the disks\nthemselves, which would not be the situation that Arnheim had been considering. In order to\navoid the descriptive and inferential statistics being distorted by these cases, a) in Figures 8\nto 11 the average crop window is based only on those participants who did not place the crop\nwindow at an edge; and b) inferential statistics are based both on all participants and also\n640 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\non participants who did not place the crop window at an edge. Statistical analyses used the\nFriedman rank test for related samples and are reported as `p(all participants) [p(participants\nnot on an edge)]'. If participants are, on average, placing their crop windows where the\nphysicalist theory would predict, then the intersection of the midpoints of the average crop\nwindow (shown as the thin red cross-hair lines) should lie on one of the balance loci.\n1. Square images similar to that used by Arnheim (Figure 8). Figure 8c is Arnheim's\nimage, and on average the participants are placing the frame where Arnheim would\nhave expected. That is also true for Figure 8e, with the average crop window lying\ncentrally between the disks. Figures 8d and 8f are more problematic, as the midpoint\nof the average crop window is still midway between the disks, despite the fact that the\nphysicalist model would expect it to have moved down and to the left, further from\nthe pale grey disk and nearer to the black disk. The Friedman test found no significant\ndifferences in the placement of the frame between the conditions in the X direction\n2. Anisotropy of left-right and up-down (Figure 9). The Friedman test found no significant\ndifference in the placement of the average crop window (X: p = .179[.119]; Y: p =\n.172[.503]). As with the previous experiment, although the physicalist theory would\nexpect the centre of the crop window to be placed nearer to the black disk than the grey\ndisk, Figure 9 shows that in all four cases the middle of the crop window is placed about\nmidway between the disks. In general, there is symmetry around the horizontal and\nvertical axes, and therefore given the absence of an overall effect, there is little point in\nsearching further for anisotropy.\n3. Variation in size and greyness of one of the disks (Figure 10). A physicalist theory would\npredict that the smaller and lighter the upper disk, then the more the CoM would\nbe pulled down and to the left towards the black disk. The Friedman test found no\nsignificant difference in the placement of the average crop window in the X direction\nHowever, detailed scrutiny of Figure 10 suggests that the effects are not as would be\npredicted by the physicalist model (and if the model were predicting properly, then the\nhorizontal axis of the average crop window should lie on the blue line). In 10c, 10e, 10f,\nno cases where it is further from the disk. In general the pattern is of the centre of the\naverage crop window being at the midpoint between the disks, irrespective of their size\nor greyness.\n4. Grey level ramps in the background (Figure 11). The grey level ramps effectively mean\nthat there is only one axis on which a balance can be obtained, on the vertical axis for\nthe vertical ramps (Figures 11a and 11c), and on the horizontal axis for the horizontal\nramps (Figures 11b and 11d). There is no significant difference in the locations of the\nThere should also be a much reduced variance horizontally in Figures 11a and 11c and\na reduced variance vertically in Figures 11b and 11d, but there seems to be no sign of\nthat. Overall, the distribution of individual points looks very similar to those in Figures\n8, 9, and 10, with a clustering of the majority of points at the centre and a few points on\nthe diagonals in particular.\nConsidering only the stimuli with rectangular crop windows (Figures 9 to 11), Figure 12 shows\nthe summed positions of the crop windows, expressed in terms of the mid-point of the two\ndisks when they are of equal size (eg, Figure 9 and Figures 10a, d, g, j and Figure 11). There\nis a clear clustering at the centre, midway between the two disks; there are many points on\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 641\nFigure 12. The results of all judgements in Study 5, aggregated across all stimuli where the crop window\nwas rectangular and plotted relative to the midpoint of the two large black disks in Figure 10a.\nthe diagonals; and in addition, there are points at the margins of the possible locations (and,\nparticularly at the corners, these are often super-imposed).\nStudy 5 has directly replicated the process that Ross and then Arnheim recommended\nfor finding the CoM of an image--moving a frame around the image until the image looks\nbalanced. One of the stimuli was as close as possible to that described by Arnheim, and on\naverage the participants did indeed place the frame where he would have expected, with the\ncentre of the frame exactly between the two disks. However, in a range of other situations\nwhere the disks varied in size or greyness, or were placed in front of grey-level ramps, and\nwhere any model of balance would surely predict that the frame should be placed closer\nto the larger and heavier of the disks, the frame was still placed in almost exactly the same\nsituation as with two identical black disks. Overall, the conclusion of Study 5 has to be that\naltering the size, greyness, or background of images has no effect at all upon their framing.\nThat is a paradox, not least because to take, say, the stimuli of Figures 10j, 10k, and 10l, there\npresumably has to come a point at which the disk becomes vanishingly small, or becomes\nas white as the background, when the frame would presumably, for Arnheim, have to be\ncentred around the sole remaining disk.\n7 General discussion and conclusions\nThis analysis of the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory of balance in aesthetic images has been based\non a literal, physicalist interpretation of Arnheim and Ross, one that uses the standard\nprinciples of statics, as understood by physicists, to investigate whether or not systems are\nbalanced. Whether or not Arnheim and Ross meant to be taken in such strictly physical terms\nis not entirely clear, and it may be, as Cupchik (2007) argued, that the use of terms such as\nbalance is primarily metaphorical. However, that does not really fit with the language and the\nlevel of description used by Arnheim and Ross. In particular, Arnheim (1971), as, for instance,\n642 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\nin his Entropy and Art, makes reference to a host of physicists and mathematicians, including\nBoltzmann, Bragg, Curie, Eddington, Kelvin, Lagrange, Mach, Newton, Planck, Schr\u00f6dinger,\nThomson, Tyndall, and Wiener, which suggests that he was thinking as a physicist, and meant\nhis use of terms such as balance to be considered literally. Arnheim also understood the\nstrengths (and the limitations) of mathematics in talking about art, quoting Leon Battista\nAlberti's comment at the beginning of his Della Pittura of 1435 that,\nI shall primarily take from the mathematicians those things which will seem to me to be\nappropriate. ... But in all of my argument I wish it to be observed that I shall speak of these\nthings not as a mathematician but as a painter (Alberti quoted by Arnheim 1966, p. ix).\nIf, despite this physical and mathematical underpinning, it is the case that Arnheim's\ntheory is not to be interpreted in a physicalist way, it is not clear to us how it should be\ninterpreted in order to obtain clear predictions for the various experimental situations we\nhave described. And even if Arnheim intended only metaphor, more practically oriented\nartists have been more explicit, as was Ross, and as was also the case of Len A Doust, who\nin the 1920s and 1930s wrote a series of books on art (The Doust Art Manuals), in one of\nwhich (Doust 1934) it is said that, `Composition is harmony, perfect balance; it is a sense of\nsatisfaction in quantity' (p. 51, our emphasis). Doust continues by saying,\nLet me define this problem of balance in a mechanical way. [Doust's] Figure 4c presents two\nunequal weights, which are balanced on a fulcrum in the centre of a picture; naturally, the\nbigger weight is nearer the fulcrum. ...This is the primary key of balance or composition. ...\n[G]ood composition depends upon a balance of unequal masses on the centre of the picture. ...\nOne could write volumes on composition, and it would be but an elaboration of the simple\nLikewise, and explicitly in the context of photography, Freeman (2007), immediately after\na section on 'Gestalt perception', has a section on 'Balance', where there is a diagram of\nscales almost exactly as that in Doust, and it is said that,\nWhen talking about the balance of forces in a picture, the usual analogies tend to be ones drawn\nfrom the physical world: gravity, levers, weights, and fulcrums. These are quite reasonable\nanalogies to use, because the eye and mind have a real, objective response to balance that\nworks in a very similar way to the laws of mechanics (p. 40, our emphasis).\nThat our physicalist interpretation of the Arnheim\u00adRoss model, as defined above, does\nnot explain our empirical findings seems clear enough. One possibility is that the essential\nform of the model is adequate, but that the parameterisation fails. It may be, for instance,\nthat grey levels are not linearly related to perceived weight, or that distance is not weighted\nlinearly to distance (as in equation (1) above); certainly, McManus et al (1985) found that\nthe weight of squares is not always proportion to the square of their linear dimension but\nthat individual subjects differ in the power relationship with different exponents. Although\nthat is a possibility, it raises such a near infinity of possibilities, each potentially different\nfor each individual perceiver, that it is not possible to take it further here. Whether or not it\nwould save a physicalist interpretation of Arnheim is not clear, or perhaps it merely makes\nthe theory unfalsifiable. Although testing only a subset of possible non-linear models, the\nanalyses of Study 1 using equation (3) do strongly suggest that the position of the CoM is not\nparticularly sensitive to the particular parameters of the model within a reasonable range.\nIn considering a physicalist interpretation of Arnheim, it should also be mentioned\nthat Arnheim seems to be using a somewhat more complex theory when in Art and Visual\nPerception he discusses his Figure 5a and particularly 5b (our Figure 8a and 8b). In particular\nhe says that the two disks `attract each other', but that `at a certain distance they repel each\nother because they are too close together' (p. 18). Arnheim also suggests that the two disks\n`form a pair because of their closeness and their similarity in size and shape', and that `as\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 643\nmembers of a pair ... they are given equal value and function in the whole' (p. 18). Finally,\nArnheim also discusses a series of attractive and repulsive forms within the space of a frame,\nwhich appear to be a repulsion from the frame itself and an attraction towards the centre (pp.\n12-16). Such speculations would certainly result in a more dynamic, more sophisticated\nmodel than the simple physicalist account we have presented, far closer to Maxwellian\nfields, with objects and frame all having attractions and repulsions. Having said that, it is still\ndifficult to see how such additional parameters and processes could account for the results\nseen in Figure 10. The devil, as ever, is in the details.\nWhether or not Arnheim was being physicalist there still remains a need to explain how\ncomposition in photographic and other images is determined. As Burgin (1982) said, the\nterm 'composition' is used meaningfully in the visual arts, and that also applies in our\nstudies, where participants make judgements which are consistent with one another. Clearly\nsomething is being done when participants compose images. Our studies have a number\nof positive conclusions, which should not be ignored. Our study of art photographs (Study\n1) found that the centre of mass is indeed closer to one of the main axes than in control\nimages (and in particular the external controls of randomly taken photographs). Although it\nseems unlikely that a physicalist account of balance can explain that result, some process\nmust be underlying the difference, which yet remains to be found. Likewise, although the\ngamma ramp experiment (Study 2) failed to find any support for the balance point being on\nan axis, it did show clearly that in a majority of cases participants, and particularly experts,\npreferred the original image from the manipulated image which was only subtly different.\nGiven that the image content, and especially its symbolic meaning, was effectively identical\nin the two images, the implication is that somehow formal, compositional properties of the\nimages did indeed account for the preference. The cropping experiments likewise found\nthat images cropped by participants had their centre of mass closer to an axis than did\nrandomly cropped images (Study 3), which again supports the idea that some compositions\nare superior to others, although, again, the details of the spiders-web experiment suggest\nthat the Arnheim\u00adRoss model cannot explain the effect. Finally, in Study 5, which used the\nparticular stimulus described by Arnheim, along with variants upon it, participants did\nnot crop at random but showed highly systematic choices, even if those choices did not\ncorrespond to what the Arnheim\u00adRoss theory predicts, and neither were they altered by\nobvious manipulations of size, greyness, or background. Overall, therefore, these findings,\nboth positive and negative, do require explanation and suggest that the methodologies\ndescribed here can be used to test such explanations.\nParticular theoretical challenges for any theory of composition are posed by two of our\nresults, which seem to pull in opposite directions:\n1. In Study 5, altering the size or grey level of one of the two disks in Arnheim's original\nimage, or using a vertical or horizontal grey-level ramp behind the disks, failed to alter the\npreferred framing position. That has to be a problem for any simple theory of balance which\nsomehow integrates grey-levels across the entire image. A partial clue to the problem may\nhave been suggested by Ross, who at the very end of his book states:\n[W]hen any line or spot has a meaning, when there is any symbolism or representation in\nit, it may gain an indefinite force of attraction. This however is a force of attraction for the\nmind rather than the eye. ... The consideration of such attractions, suggestions, meanings, or\nsignifications does not belong to Pure Design but to Symbolism or to Representation (Ross\nThe lack of any effect of the greyness of the circles, or of the background greyness, may\nresult from the circles not being treated as merely a part of a gestalt of pixels but instead\nas objects so that it is the object status as circles, qua exemplars of circles (ie, symbols of\n644 I C McManus, K St\u00f6ver, D Kim\ncircles as well as just being circles), that overrides any mere consideration of the circles as\nbeing part of a total image. If so, then the challenge is to find images for which there is no\nsuch symbolic component (and it may be that purely abstract images may in some situations\nmeet that requirement). Alternatively, it may be necessary to compare objects which differ\nin their symbolic force (so that although the attraction is large, it is not, in Ross's term,\n`infinite', and hence can differ between objects within a frame). Finally, it might be felt that a\npartial solution to the problem would be provided were the images, in effect, to have been\nconsidered only in terms of their edges, so that grey levels were effectively removed, and in\neach case just two circles remained. That is so, but it seems difficult to understand how two\ndifferently sized circles should have equivalent force (either in a symbolic or a more physical\nsense); and even if that were the case, at the limit, as one circle becomes ever smaller until,\nlike the Cheshire Cat, it disappears, the optimal balance at that moment would have to move\nso that the sole remaining circle would then be at the centre of the frame.\n2. The precise antithesis of the problematic results of Study 5 is the findings of Study 2, the\ngamma-ramp experiment. These images were manipulated so that the gamma coefficient\nvaried, in effect, in traditional photographic terms, the 'hardness' or 'softness' of the paper\non which the image is printed, varied linearly across the horizontal and vertical dimensions\nof the image. That manipulation moved the centre of mass onto or off of a major axis.\nThe physicalist interpretation of Arnheim's theory was not supported, as images with the\ncentre of mass on an axis were not more preferred to those off an axis. However, and it is\nan important theoretical result, the original images were preferred over the manipulated\nimages, despite the difference between the two barely being visible if the images were placed\nside-by-side (and hence the successive choice paradigm had to be adopted). The content\nof the original and manipulated images, in terms of what was being represented, was not\naltered, and therefore the images must surely have had near identical symbolic properties.\nThe preferences for the originals must therefore be preferences which are largely independent\nof the symbolic meanings, and hence are underpinned by particular patterns of different\ngrey levels across the image surface, despite those differences being hard to distinguish when\nthe images are placed side-by-side. Finally, and it has to be important, the preference for\noriginals was significantly greater in experts than non-experts.\nIn summary, any simple balance theory has severe problems because of Study 5, which\nseems to imply that it is symbolic values rather than any integral of grey levels which are\nimportant, whereas Study 2 seems to keep symbolic values constant, and yet original images\nare preferred to manipulated images, which must somehow depend on the integration of\ngrey levels across the image, since that is all that has been manipulated.\nAn interesting finding, particularly in Study 5, is that there is a tendency always to centre\nthe objects, irrespective of their actual weights or sizes. There is something similar here to\nthe tendency, which has been repeatedly found, for eye-movements to concentrate towards\nthe centre of images (Tseng et al 2009), even if they are blurred and of low resolution (Judd\net al 2011), although there is a tendency for artists to show scanpaths covering more of an\nimage (Vogt and Magnussen 2007). Since we have already referred to the work of Victor\nBurgin (1982), it is worth mentioning that he also considers the role of eye-movements in\nphotographic composition, suggesting that as the eye explores an image then eventually\nit encounters the frame, at which point the risk is that the viewer will stop looking at the\nphotograph and instead look outside the frame at the rest of the world. That risk,\nmay, however, be postponed by a variety of strategies which include 'compositional' devices\nfor moving the eye from the framing edge. 'Good composition' may therefore be no more or\nless than a set of devices for ... retarding the recognition of the autonomy of the frame (Burgin\nArnheim's Gestalt theory of visual balance 645\nArnheim's theory, at least in our physicalist interpretation of it, is a Gestalt theory par\nexcellence, the entire image contributing to its overall perception. In so far as many works\nof art are framed, and the entire image within the area is seen as contributing to the total\naesthetic effect, then it makes sense for any theory of art images to be a Gestalt theory. Our\nphysicalist interpretation of Arnheim and Ross is perhaps not the only type of theory which\nhas such properties. Research in recent years has attempted to look at eye-movement data\nto find which aspects of visual scenes are likely to attract attention [and the work of Itti and\nKoch (2000) has concentrated on such issues, using low-level (non-object) information],\nand it has been extended and developed by Torralba et al (2006), using a Bayesian approach\ninvolving the likelihood of particular types of objects within specific scene types. In recent\nyears, following the work of Mandelbrot on fractal geometries, a number of workers have\nargued that works of art are characterised by a particular relationship, in Fourier analytic\nterms, between the amplitude of particular harmonics and their frequency (the so-called\n1/f relationship occurring when log(amplitude) is a linear function of log(frequency), with a\nslope of -1). Naturally occurring stimuli, as well as art works, typically show 1/f patterns [see,\nKoch et al (2010), as well as studies of images by Jackson Pollock (Jones-Smith and Mathur\n(McManus and Jeffs 1990), have found preferences for fractal-like patterns in experimental\nsituations. It is possible that principles derived from fractal analyses might help in explaining\nsome of the results found in our studies, and that is being investigated at present. Certainly\nany such theory would be fundamentally Gestalt in its approach, integrating information\nacross the entire image. Finally, and we are grateful to a reviewer for pointing out to us, Gestalt\ntheory ultimately considers objects within frames, and not patches of light. Wertheimer (1923)\nmade the point very clearly when he said, in the opening of a paper,\nI stand at the window and see a house, trees, sky.\nTheoretically I might say there were 327 brightnesses and nuances of colour. Do I have\nAny adequate Gestalt theory of composition has surely, therefore, to take account of the\nmeanings of objects qua objects as well as the patterns of light and shade in which they find\nthemselves embedded.\nReferences\nAks D J, Sprott J C, 1996 \"Quantifying aesthetic preference for chaotic patterns\" Empirical Studies of\nArnheim R, 1954 Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye (Berkeley, CA: University\nof California)\nArnheim R, 1966 Introduction to 'Creative Painting and Drawing' by Anthony Toney (New York: Dover\nPublications)\nArnheim R, 1971 Entropy and Art: An Essay on Disorder and Order (Berkeley, CA: University of\nCalifornia Press)\nArnheim R, 1974 Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye.
