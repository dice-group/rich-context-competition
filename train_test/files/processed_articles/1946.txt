Guided by interactional role theory and employing a resilience framework, this study aimed to investigate\nwhether formal volunteering protects older adults with more role-identity absences in major life domains (partner,\nemployment, and parental) from poorer psychological well-being.\nMethods. We used data from 373 participants, aged 65\u00ad74, in the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the\nU.S. (MIDUS). Multivariate regression models estimated the effects of major role-identity absences, formal volunteering,\nand the interaction between major role-identity absences and volunteering on respondents' negative affect, positive affect,\nand purpose in life.\nResults. Participants with a greater number of major role-identity absences reported more negative affect, less positive\naffect, and less purpose in life. Being a formal volunteer was associated with more positive affect and moderated the\nnegative effect of having more major role-identity absences on respondents' feelings of purpose in life.\nDiscussion. Consistent with previous studies, findings indicate that having more role-identity absences constitutes a risk\nfactor for poorer psychological well-being. Results further demonstrate that being a formal volunteer can protect older\nadults with a greater number of major role-identity absences from decreased levels of purpose in life. The findings suggest\nthat associations between volunteering and psychological well-being might be contingent upon the volunteer's role-\nidentity status and the dimension of psychological well-being examined.\nVOLUNTEERING is an increasingly popular activity\namong older adults in the United States. A growing\nemphasis on staying active in later years, a widespread cultural\nvalue of volunteering, and rising income and educational levels\namong the aged have led to more older adult volunteers over\nthe last few decades (Chambre, 1993). Much of the current\nsocietal enthusiasm for volunteering in later adulthood focuses\non the mutual benefits of such activity, namely, that older adults\nhave the availability and ability to assist others and that\nvolunteering provides older adults with needed constructive\nactivities and productive roles (e.g., Rouse & Clawson, 1992).\nResearch on volunteering and well-being suggests that formal\ncommunity involvement, indeed, is beneficial for older adults'\nwell-being. Previous studies have found that volunteering is\nassociated with better self-health ratings (Morrow-Howell,\nHinterlong, Rozario, & Tang, 2003), increased life satisfaction\n(Van Willigen, 2000), decreased mortality (Musick, Herzog, &\nlevels of contentment (Jirovec & Hyduk, 1998), as well as lower\nlevels of functional dependence and depressive symptomatology\n(Morrow-Howell et al., 2003). Researchers also have suggested\nthat volunteering might have differential benefits on well-being\naccording to subgroup variations within the older adult\npopulation. For example, Musick and colleagues (1999) found\nthat volunteering has a greater protective effect on mortality for\nolder adults with lower levels of informal social contact relative\nto the effect for older adults with higher levels of informal social\ncontact. Overall, however, evidence for contingent effects of\nvolunteering on well-being has been limited and inconsistent\n(Morrow-Howell et al., 2003), and few studies have investigated\nthe extent to which volunteering might be associated with unique\nadvantages for different dimensions of psychological well-being.\nThe current study aimed to advance understanding of\nvolunteering and well-being by focusing on the possibly\ncontextual and dimension-specific advantages of older adults'\nformal volunteer activities. We draw on a large body of\nempirical and theoretical work that identifies role-identity\nabsences in major life domains to be a risk factor for older\nadults' well-being; this literature suggests that lacking partner,\nemployment, and parental role identities--independently and\ncumulatively--is adversely associated with older adults' well-\nbeing (Coleman, Antonucci, & Adelmann, 1987; Hong &\n1983). Guided by interactional role theory and using a resilience\nframework, we conceptualize being a formal volunteer as a role-\nidentity that might moderate the association between an older\nadult's accumulation of major role-identity absences and their\npsychological well-being.\nTheoretical and Empirical Background\nInteractional role theory. --Gerontologists often draw on\nrole theories in their investigations of volunteering and well-\nbeing (Morrow-Howell et al., 2003). Our study was guided by\ninteractional role theory--a framework outlined by Styrker and\nStatham (1985) that integrates classic symbolic interactionism\nand traditional role theory. Interactional role theory posits that\npeople in society occupy a number of social positions. These\npositions are associated with behavioral expectations for the\nsocial actors occupying them, regardless of the actors'\nindividual personalities, and become roles (Sieber, 1974).\nWhen a person internalizes a positional designation, which is\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\ngained through interactions in role relationships, a role-identity\nis formed, and role-identities collectively form one's self\nThe relation between role-identities and well-being con-\nstitutes a classic theme in the social sciences. Durkheim's\n(1979) notion of ``anomie,'' or the malaise resulting from\nrolelessness and separation from a larger social order, attests to\nearly ideas about the linkages between roles, identity, and well-\nbeing. Likewise, Turner (1978) considered role enactment to be\na germinal process through which people validate their self and\ngain esteem. Thoits (1983) further postulated that roles provide\nmeaning, guidance, direction, and purpose for individuals'\nlives, thereby helping persons to avoid negative mental health\nand disorganized behavior. Finally, Bronfenbrenner (1979)\nexplained that because roles are rooted in both people's micro-\nand macro-social worlds, they assert a powerful influence over\nhow a person acts, is treated, relates to others, thinks, and feels.\nInteractional role theory has guided research revealing that\nvolunteering holds greater psychological and physical health\nadvantages for older, as opposed to younger, adults (Van\nWilligen, 2000). Volunteering might hold more meaning for\nolder adults, because they are more commonly missing other\nmajor role-identities such as paid employment and marital role\nidentities. If this were the case, older adults who experience\na greater number of major role-identity absences would derive\ngreater psychological advantages from volunteering than older\nadults who experience fewer major role-identity absences.\nMajor role-identity absences and well-being in later adult-\nhood. --Research on marital, parental, and employment status\nsuggests that an absence in any one of these major roles is\nassociated with negative psychological outcomes (Gove, Style,\nresearch has demonstrated that having fewer of these three\nmajor role-identities is negatively associated with well-being;\nmany role-identity absences is a risk factor for poorer mental\nnumber of studies have examined the association between well-\nbeing and role-identity absences by considering the parental,\npartner, and employment role-identities together with others,\nsuch as being a volunteer, relative, friend, group member,\nneighbor, homemaker, grandparent, and student. Although\noccupying multiple roles has the potential to create conflicting\nand overwhelming demands for an individual's behavior\n(Goode, 1960), overall, studies on multiple roles have indicated\nthat a larger number of role-identities is associated with better\nMoen, & Dempster-McClain, 1991; Pietromonaco, Manis, &\nAlthough research has addressed the cumulative effects of\nrole-identities on well-being, little research has investigated the\nextent to which nonwork and nonfamily sources of role-\nidentity, such as volunteering, interact with partner, parental,\nand employment role-identity absences (i.e., major role-identity\nabsences) to influence well-being. Investigating these inter-\nactions is important for creating a more nuanced understanding\nof processes that promote psychological well-being in later\nadulthood, especially as individuals spend an increasing\nnumber of adult years in retirement (Kinsella & Velkoff,\n2001) and as an increasing number of adults enter later\nadulthood without partners and children (Schoen, Urton,\nApplying a resilience model: Volunteering as a protective fac-\ntor in the face of risk. --To model and test relationships between\nolder adults' major role-identity absences, volunteer activities,\nand psychological well-being, this study employed a resilience\nframework. Although scholars have long disputed definitions of\nresilience (for more detailed reviews, see Luthar, Cicchetti, &\na multidimensional process, which entails both adversity that\nplaces individuals at heightened risk for experiencing negative\noutcomes and protective factors that buffer individuals against\nthese negative consequences of adversity (Rutter, 1990). We\ntreat multiple types of major role-identity absence as a risk\nfactor for decreased well-being. Taking into account Moen and\ncolleagues' (1992) discussion of role context, which focuses on\nhow the effect of one role on well-being might be influenced by\na combination of other roles, we hypothesize that being a formal\nvolunteer might serve as a protective mechanism moderating\nthe risk of having major role-identity absences on three\ndimensions of psychological well-being.\nPsychological well-being: A multidimensional construct. --\nWithin the gerontologic literature on volunteering and psycho-\nlogical well-being, well-being has been investigated most\ncommonly in terms of life satisfaction (Van Willigen, 2000).\nAlthough gerontologists often characterize volunteer activities\nas opportunities for meaning, role enactment, and productivity\nresearchers have measured well-being in these or related terms.\nTo address substantive limitations of previous research, this\nstudy focuses on three dimensions of well-being relating to two\ndifferent approaches to conceptualizing well-being (Ryan &\nDeci, 2001). We include measures of positive and negative\naffect to investigate how volunteering is associated with\nhedonic conceptions of well-being, which typically approach\nwell-being as the maximization of life satisfaction and positive\naffect and the minimization of negative affect (Kahneman,\nDiener, & Schwarz, 1999). We also include a measure of\npurpose in life: an indicator that is consistent with eudaimonic\napproaches that conceptualize well-being as an individual's\nfruitful engagement with life, meaning finding, and experiences\nof optimal growth (Keyes, Shmotkin, & Ryff, 2002).\nHypotheses. --Guided by interactional role theory and\na resilience framework as well as the current empirical\nliterature, we developed a conceptual model (Figure 1),\nsuggesting that volunteering would moderate the risk of an\nincreased number of major role-identity absences on psycho-\nlogical well-being among older adults. We then tested the\nfollowing hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1. Older adults who have more role-identity absences\nin major life domains (partner, employment, and parental)\nwill report poorer psychological well-being compared with\nolder adults who report fewer major role-identity absences.\nHypothesis 2. Older adults who are volunteers will report better\npsychological well-being in contrast to older adults who are\nnot volunteers.\nHypothesis 3. Older adults with a greater number of major role-\nidentity absences who are volunteers will experience better\npsychological well-being in contrast to older adults with more\nmajor role-identity absences who are not volunteers.\nMETHOD\nData\nThis study used data from a subsample of National Survey of\nMidlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS) respondents. The\nMIDUS national probability sample that answered both\ntelephone and self-administered surveys includes 3,032\nEnglish-speaking, noninstitutionalized adults who were be-\nanalytic sample for this study consisted of 373 adults between\nThe MIDUS sample was obtained through random digit\ndialing, with an oversampling of older middle-aged respondents\nand men made to ensure a good distribution on the cross-\nclassification of age and gender. Sampling weights correcting for\nselection probabilities and nonresponse allow this sample to\nmatch the composition of the U.S. population on age, sex, race,\nand education. For this study, multivariate regression models\nwere estimated with both the unweighted and the weighted data.\nNo major differences in results were found. Therefore, results\nfrom unweighted analyses are reported, as these analyses provide\nestimates that are most efficient; that is, they provide parameters\nwith minimized standard errors (Winship & Radbill, 1994).\nRespondents first participated in a telephone interview\nlasting approximately 40 min. The response rate for the\ntelephone questionnaire was 70%. Respondents to the tele-\nphone survey were then asked to complete two self-adminis-\ntered mail-back questionnaires. The response rate for the\nquestionnaire was 86.8% of telephone respondents. Therefore,\nthe overall response rate for the sample that answered both the\ntelephone survey and the questionnaire was 60.8%. Non-\nrespondents to the MIDUS tended to have lower levels of\neducation and income and to be from nonmajority racial\u00adethnic\ngroups. Sampling weights correct for this bias in weighted\nanalyses, and we control for these factors in unweighted as well\nas weighted analyses. (For a detailed technical report regarding\nfield procedures, response rates, and weighting, see http://\nmidmac.med.harvard.edu/research.html#tchrpt.)\nMeasures\nNegative and positive affect. --Two six-item scales were\nused to measure positive and negative affect (Mroczek &\nKolarz, 1998). To assess negative affect, participants were\nasked how frequently in the last 30 days they felt (a) so sad\nnothing could cheer them up, (b) nervous, (c) restless or fidgety,\n(d) hopeless, (e) that everything was an effort, and (f) worthless.\nSimilarly, to assess positive affect, participants were asked how\nfrequently they felt (a) cheerful, (b) in good spirits, (c)\nextremely happy, (d) calm and peaceful, (e) satisfied, and (f)\nfull of life. Respondents answered each of the 12 affect items\nby using a 5-point scale (1 \u00bc all of the time, 5 \u00bc none of the\ntime). Items were reverse coded and summed so that higher\nscores indicated more negative and more positive affect.\nCronbach's alpha was .83 and .88 for the negative affect and\npositive affect indexes, respectively.\nPurpose in life. --To assess purpose in life, the questionnaire\nincluded a three-item version of Ryff's Purpose in Life Index\ncreated this three-item index as an additive measure designed to\nrepresent the conceptual breadth of ``purpose in life,'' which\nshe found in factor analyzing her 20-item scale. One subfactor,\nfuture orientation, is indicated with the item, ``I live life one day\nat a time and don't really think about the future.'' A second\nsubfactor, related to having a sense of aims and direction, is\nindicated with the item, ``Some people wander aimlessly through\nlife, but I am not one of them.'' A third subfactor, related to\nhaving new goals, is indicated with the item, ``I sometimes feel\nas if I've done all there is to do in life.'' For all three items,\nrespondents were asked to ``indicate how strongly you agree or\ndisagree'' with the statements on a 6-point continuum (1 \u00bc\nstrongly agree, 6\u00bcstrongly disagree). Items were reverse coded\nand summed so that higher scores indicated more purpose in life.\nThis additive index is correlated highly (r . .70) with its parent\nMajor role-identity absences score. --Participants received\na summative score of major role-identity absences by adding\ntogether their number of absent roles in major life domains:\npartner (not married), employment (not employed full- or part-\ntime), and parental (no living biological, adopted, or stepchild,\nnor any living child who a respondent had helped to raise for 5\nyears or more). Higher scores indicated participants who\nexperienced a greater number of major role-identity absences.\nVolunteer status. --A four-part item in the questionnaire\nasked participants, ``On average, about how many hours per\nmonth do you spend doing formal volunteer work of any of the\nfollowing types: (a) hospital, nursing home, or other healthcare-\noriented volunteer work; (b) school or other youth-related\nvolunteer work; (c) volunteer work for political organizations\nor causes; (d) volunteer work for any other organization, cause,\nor charity?'' Respondents who reported volunteering in any\nquantity per month for any combination of volunteer\nFigure 1. Conceptual model for the risk-buffering effect of\nvolunteering for older adults' psychological well-being.\norganizations were coded ``1.'' Respondents who reported no\nvolunteering were coded ``0.''\nControl Variables\nPrevious work has demonstrated that psychological well-\nbeing is associated with age, race, gender, education, income,\nto being related to the dependent variable, these sociodemo-\ngraphic variables are also related to the independent variables\nof interest: major role-identity absences (Tucker & Mitchel-\nKernan, 1995) and volunteering (Duke, Leventhal, Brownlee,\nmajor role-identity absences and their interaction with being\na volunteer contribute to psychological well-being independent\nof other factors, age, race, gender, income, education, and\nfunctional health limitations were controlled in all analyses.\nRespondents' age was assessed as years since birth at the time\nof the telephone survey. Participants who identified themselves\nas African American were coded ``1'' on a dichotomous variable\nfor race. Likewise, participants who identified themselves as\nfemale were coded ``1'' on a dichotomous variable for gender.\nParticipants' income was computed by combining their personal\nannual income with that of their spouse. Education was coded on\na 4-point scale, with ``1'' indicating that the participant had\ncompleted some or no years of high school, ``2'' indicating that\nthe participant had completed high school, ``3'' indicating that the\nparticipant had some years of higher education, and ``4''\nindicating that the participant had obtained a 4-year college\ndegree or more education. Functional health limitations were\nassessed with six items asking respondents to indicate the degree\nto which their health limits them in carrying groceries, climbing\nseveral flights of stairs, bending, kneeling, or stooping, walking\nseveral blocks, engaging in vigorous activity (e.g., running,\nlifting heavy objects), and engaging in moderate activity (e.g.,\nbowling, vacuuming; 1\u00bc``a lot,'' 4\u00bc``not at all''). Scores were\nreverse coded, and the mean level of response was computed;\nhigher scores indicated more functional health limitations.\nData Analytic Sequence\nMultivariate regression models were estimated to test the\nhypothesized associations among psychological well-being\noutcomes, major role-identity absences, and volunteer status.\nPreliminary analyses examined evidence for gender differences\nin the effects of major role-identity absences as well as for\ngender differences in the effects of volunteering, on each of the\nthree outcomes. None of the gender interactions in these models\nreached statistical significance (p .05); therefore, it was\ndeemed appropriate to analyze data from women and men\ntogether.\nFor final analyses, in the first model, the six control variables\nwere entered. In the second model, the main independent\nvariables (major role-identity absences and volunteer status)\nwere added to evaluate Hypotheses 1 and 2. In the third model,\nthe interaction term (major role-identity absences 3 volunteer\nstatus) was added to evaluate Hypothesis 3 and to further\nevaluate Hypotheses 1 and 2. All three models were estimated\nacross each of the three dimensions of psychological well-being.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Findings\nTable 1 presents descriptive information regarding the\nprevalence of major role-identity absences. More than three\nfifths (61.1%) of the respondents reported having only one\nmajor role-identity absence, and very few (4.0%) reported\nhaving all three. Having a parental role-identity absence was\nthe least common form of major role-identity absence; 8.1% of\nthe sample reporting having no living children. About one third\nof the respondents (32.6%) experienced a partner role-identity\nabsence, and 78.3% lacked an employment role-identity. Table\n2 provides descriptives for all analytic variables. Thirty-six\npercent of participants reported volunteering for a formal\norganization at least once per month.\nMajor Role-Identity Absences and\nPsychological Well-Being\nTo examine initial evidence for our first hypothesis regarding\nthe linkages between major role-identity absences and psycho-\nlogical well-being, we estimated a model regressing each\npsychological well-being outcome on participants' number of\nmajor role-identity absences and volunteer status (Table 3,\nModel 2). Major role-identity absences consistently predicted\nparticipants' poorer psychological well-being, which provided\nstrong initial support for Hypothesis 1. More major role-\nidentity absences were associated with more negative affect\nTable 1. Weighted Percentage Distribution for Major\nRole-Identity Variables\nVariable Percent\nType of role-identity absence\nNumber of role-identity absences\nSource: National Survey of Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS)\nTable 2. Descriptives for Analytic Variables\nVariable Mean (SD) Range\nNote: Descriptives computed with weighted data.\naDichotomous variables are reported as proportions.\nSource: National Survey of Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS)\nVolunteering and Psychological Well-Being\nTo examine initial evidence for our second hypothesis\nregarding linkages between volunteering and psychological\nwell-being, we again focus on Table 3 (Model 2). Results\ndemonstrated that being a volunteer was a predictor of more\npositive affect (b\u00bc .88, p .05). Volunteer status failed to help\npredict respondents' levels of negative affect and purpose in life.\nVolunteering as a Protective Factor\nTo examine evidence for our third hypothesis regarding how\nvolunteering might moderate the effect of major role-identity\nabsences on psychological well-being, we estimated Model 3,\nwhich added the major role-identity absences3volunteer status\ninteraction variable. Results demonstrated a significant\ninteraction effect for respondents' purpose in life (b \u00bc 1.05,\np .05), but not for their positive or negative affect. These\nfindings suggest that the effect of major role-identity absences\non respondents' feelings of purpose in life is contingent upon\nwhether or not they volunteer.\nTo better interpret this interaction, we calculated predicted\nscores for purpose in life for volunteers and nonvolunteers\nacross the two end-points of the continuum for major role-\nidentity absences (i.e., no major role-identity absences and all\nthree major role-identity absences). As Figure 2 demonstrates,\nfor nonvolunteers, an increase from zero to three major role-\nidentity absences lowered respondents' predicted purpose in\nlife by about 1 SD. However, for volunteers, a greater number\nof role-identity absences was not associated with a substantial\nchange in levels of purpose in life. These patterns suggest that\nvolunteering beneficially moderates the relationship between\nrespondents' major role-identity absences and feelings of\npurpose in life, providing support for Hypothesis 3.\nDISCUSSION\nThe findings of this study contribute to our understanding of\nlinkages among role identities in major life domains, formal\nvolunteering, and multiple dimensions of psychological well-\nbeing in later life. First, consistent with previous studies on\nroles and well-being in later adulthood (Coleman et al., 1987;\nHong & Seltzer, 1995), findings indicate that having major\nrole-identity absences constitutes a strong risk factor for older\nadults' poorer psychological well-being. When compared with\nrespondents with fewer major role-identity absences, older\nadults with more role-identity absences in major life domains\nreported lower levels of psychological well-being across all\nthree dimensions examined in this study.\nSecond, results from this study contribute to recent geronto-\nlogic interest in the need to investigate differential advantages of\nvolunteering, depending on the diverse contexts of older adults'\nvolunteer activities (Morrow-Howell et al., 2003; Musick et al.,\nwhich role context might influence the relationship between\nvolunteering and well-being. Specifically, results suggest that\nvolunteering serves as a protective factor against the psycho-\nlogical well-being disadvantage of reduced sense of purpose in\nlife that accompanies a greater number of major role-identity\nabsences. Consistent with interactional role theory, which posits\nthat social roles contribute to one's self through the creation of\nTable 3.

Predicted scores of purpose in life across two different\ncategories of risk for volunteers and nonvolunteers.\nrole-identities (Stryker & Statham 1985), the results suggest that\nformal volunteering provides a role-identity from which older\nadults can derive psychological advantages. The likelihood that\nmajor role-identities are associated with increased social contact\nalso makes our results congruent with the findings of Musick and\ncolleagues (1999) that volunteering has a greater protective\neffect on mortality for socially isolated older adults than for\nthose who are socially integrated.\nIt is noteworthy that the resilience model was not\nconsistently supported across all three dimensions of psycho-\nlogical well-being examined. Results suggest that volunteering\nmight not protect participants from the increased negative affect\nand the decreased positive affect that accompanies a greater\nnumber of major role-identity absences in young old age, but\nvolunteering provides a mechanism through which older adults\nwith more role-identity absences in major life domains can\nmaintain goals, aims, and direction (i.e., purpose in life). We\ncontend that the inconsistency in these results is substantively\ncoherent. Because eudaimonic approaches to well-being--\nwhich include purpose in life--address participants' active\nengagement with life and because marriage, work, children, and\nvolunteering are primary channels through which people gain\na sense of engagement, it is plausible that the proposed\nresilience model was confirmed for purpose in life, but not for\npositive or negative affect. Similarly, we interpret the pattern of\nmain, independent effects on hedonic dimensions of well-being\n(i.e., negative and positive affect) as substantively coherent. A\nstrong U.S. ideology of volunteering as a ``feel good'' activity\nfor people of all ages might explain why volunteering is\nassociated with positive affect, but not negative affect.\nVolunteering might not prevent us from feeling dysphoric, but\nit might help us to feel cheerful and happy in later adulthood.\nOverall, results from this study are congruent with geronto-\nlogic theorizing about social roles and might further illuminate\nwhy volunteering has been found to have greater psychological\nsignificance in the lives of older adults than younger adults (Van\nWilligen, 2000). Evidence for the buffering effect of volunteer-\ning on purpose in life supports theories that posit that social role\nidentities are an important source of meaning for adults (Thoits,\n1983). Accordingly, volunteering might provide older adults,\nwho are likely lacking other major sources of role-identity, an\nopportunity for developing more meaning and experiencing\nmore purpose in their lives. Younger adults might not derive as\nstrong a well-being advantage from volunteering because they\ntypically do not experience as many major role-identity\nabsences as older adults do.\nIn addition to helping to identify role contexts in which\nvolunteering holds greatest well-being advantages for partici-\npants, this study also demonstrates the importance of specifying\nand examining exactly which dimensions of psychological well-\nbeing are most likely to be influenced by volunteering. Patterned\ndifferences in results from this study suggest that, depending\nupon the conceptualization and dimensional measure of\npsychological well-being used, analyses might or might not\ndetect linkages between volunteering and well-being. Perhaps\nthis fact can account for some of the inconsistencies in previous\nfindings regarding older adults' volunteer activities and well-\nbeing (see Jirovec & Hyduk, 1998, for a review). Findings from\nthis study further support the idea that psychological well-being\nis a multidimensional construct (Keyes et al., 2002) and underline\nthe importance of continuing to do research grounded in varied\nconceptualizations of psychological well-being.\nIt is important to note that the conclusions drawn from this\nstudy must be considered with caution. Owing to its cross-\nsectional methodologic design, the direction of causality\nbetween volunteering and psychological well-being cannot be\nestablished with certainty. For example, having more positive\naffect might lead some older adults to engage in volunteering,\nrather than their greater positive affect being a result of\nvolunteer activities. Studies employing longitudinal designs are\nneeded to investigate more conclusively the causal associations\nbetween major role-identity absences, volunteering, and\npsychological well-being. Also, this study does not investigate\nwhether informal volunteering (e.g., helping a neighbor) serves\nas a protective factor for older adults' well-being, nor does it\nspecify the possibly varied advantages of different forms and\nlevels of formal volunteering. Additionally, the study's sample\nwas limited to young-old adults, aged 65\u00ad74. Patterns and\nprocesses might differ for adults age 75 and older.\nNonetheless, the results of this study contribute additional\nempirical support for the psychological benefits of increasing\nopportunities for older adults' volunteer activities. Findings\nsuggest, however, that volunteering is not a universal panacea\ninfluencing all dimensions of psychological well-being, nor is it\nassociated with the same degree of psychological benefit for all\nolder adults. Further research is needed to address the limitations\nof this study, to identify other factors that might serve as\nprotective mechanisms for older adults' psychological well-\nbeing when major role-identity absences put them at risk, as well\nas to develop a more precise understanding of when volunteering\nis most strongly associated with enhanced psychological well-\nbeing. Continuing to investigate these processes will provide\nresearchers and practitioners with a more comprehensive and\nuseful understanding of how optimal mental health might be\nachieved and maintained through the entirety of adulthood.\n"
