The nature of this resource was previously left unspecified, referred to using\nmetaphorical terms such as \"willpower,\" or with the notion that self-control was \"like a\nRecently, Gailliot et al. (2007) reported the results of nine studies designed to make\nthis model more concrete, specifying glucose as the resource necessary for, and depleted\nby, acts of self-control (see also Gailliot and Baumeister, 2007). Like much research in this\nliterature, the studies in question used methods along the following lines. First, a \"self-\ncontrol\" task was performed by subjects, after which a second \"self-control\" task was\nperformed. In this literature, it is frequently reported that compared to relevant controls,\nperformance on the second task tends to be lower (see Hagger, Wood, Stiff, and\nChatzisarantis, in press, for a recent meta-analysis); the \"resource\" explanation of such\nGlucose and self-control\neffects is that a resource was depleted by the first task, causing a reduction in performance\non the second.\nFor the glucose account to be able to explain such results, both of the following\npropositions must be true.\nProposition 1. Performing a self-control task reduces glucose levels relative to a\ncontrol task.\nProposition 2. Performing a self-control task reduces glucose levels relative to\nglucose levels before the task.\nIf Proposition 1 is not true, then the difference in performance observed in these\nstudies cannot be due to a reduction in glucose. If Proposition 2 is not true, and glucose\nlevels are as high or higher than they were before the task, then a reduction in glucose\ncannot be the cause of reductions in performance.\nThe requirement for Proposition 2 can be stated more strongly. Specifically, for any\nsubject in whom glucose does not go down relative to baseline, it cannot be the case that\nglucose is the resource in question. That is, because the model specifies that it is the\nreduction in the resource that causes the reduction in performance; if there is no reduction\nin the resource, then this cannot explain the reduction in performance.\nNote that the following two Propositions must also be true in order for the glucose\nmodel to be correct.\nProposition 3. Performance on self-control tasks depends in some way on glucose.\nProposition 4. Reduced performance on self-control tasks is due to reductions in\nglucose.\nNote, however, that these both represent conditions of logical necessity, not logical\nsufficiency. If either of these two additional Propositions is false, then the model must be\nfalse. However, if either or both of them are true, that does not logically entail that the\nmodel is true.\nThis short piece is not intended as a complete review of the self-control literature\nBaumeister, 2007). Instead, it is intended to consider the plausibility of the glucose model\ngiven what is known about brain metabolism, and, using this analysis, consider what is\narguably the best evidence in the social psychological literature that self-control tasks\nreduce blood glucose, the work by Gailliot et al. (2007). Note that the present paper\nreviews only five of the nine studies in Gailliot et al. (2007), and presents some novel\nanalyses of the data collected in this paper, but not reported originally.\nTo be clear, the goal of this reanalysis is to investigate only Proposition 2, above. If\nProposition 2 is false, then, because the truth of this Proposition is a necessary condition\nfor the glucose model to be correct, then the glucose model of self-control cannot be\ncorrect, independent of whether the other Propositions are true.\nWhen and why does peripheral glucose go down?\nThe glucose model of self-control is committed to the view that self-control tasks\ndeplete glucose because of energy consumption by the brain (as opposed to organs in the\nGlucose and self-control\nperiphery, such as the heart). Gailliot et al. (2007) write \"it seems likely that relatively few\npsychological processes are as expensive as self-control in terms of requiring large amounts\nof glucose\" (p. 334), locating the expense of self-control in psychology and so, the brain.\nThis makes relevant the question of the extent to which the brain consumes glucose as a\nfunction of task.\nThere is some evidence for a drop in peripheral glucose when subjects perform\ntaxing cognitive tasks. Scholey, Harper, and Kennedy (2001) found in a small study\n(N=11) that compared to a control (key-pressing) task, subjects performing a \"Serial\nSevens\" task showed reduction in glucose levels over a 5-minute interval. As the authors\nnote, the Serial Sevens task is known to lead to an increase in heart rate (80 to 90 beats per\nminute; Kennedy and Scholey, 2000), making problematic the inference that the\ndifferences between the computational activity in the brain across conditions are\nresponsible for the drop in glucose. (See also Scholey, Laing, and Kennedy, 2006;\nA second claim along similar lines is Fairclough and Houston (2004), who ran a\nstudy in which they measured subjects' glucose levels, and had them do one of two kinds\nof Stroop tasks for 45 minutes. One set of subjects did the Stroop task in which the word\nand the color of the word were the same \u00ad the \"congruent\" condition \u00ad and another group\nperformed the task in which word and color were different \u00ad the \"incongruent\" condition.\nGlucose measurements were taken at 15, 30, and 45 minutes. Glucose did go down further\nin the \"incongruent\" condition. It bears mentioning that task performance did not decrease\nover time \u00ad unusual for self-control tasks \u00ad and that Marcora, Statiano, and Manning (2009)\nrecently reported a study in which they also monitored subjects' blood glucose after a 45-\nminute task, the AX Continuous Performance Task, and this effect did not occur; glucose\nlevels did not go down relative to the control task.\nIn short, the relationship between self-control performance and blood glucose level\nbrief review and discussion of methodological difficulties with studies in this area.)\nFurther, even if there are such drops, the reason for them is unclear, possibly having to do\nwith what is going on in the rest of the body, rather than computations performed in the\nbrain. This points to the importance of data surrounding the brain's metabolism of glucose\nacross different types of tasks. If performing five-minute self-control tasks were found to\nreduce peripheral glucose levels, could this be due to brain metabolism?\nBrain metabolism\nResearch on brain metabolism suggests that the relationship between blood glucose\nand mental function is complex, and not simply a matter of more \"effortful\" processes\nleading to the \"soaking up\" of more glucose by the brain. (See Gibson, 2007, and Messier,\n2004, for recent excellent reviews.) This makes the intuition that \"effortful\" tasks\nstraightforwardly lead to greater reduction in glucose misleading. Gibson and Green\n(2002), discussing the relationship between glucose and cognition, remarked that research\nin the area \"...is based on the assumption that, since glucose is the major source of fuel for\nthe brain (for example, see Sieber and Traystman, 1992), alterations in plasma levels of\nglucose will result in alterations in brain levels of glucose, and thus neuronal function.\nHowever, the strength of this notion lies in its common-sense plausibility, not in scientific\nGlucose and self-control\nIndeed, evidence suggests that the sorts of tasks in which subjects are engaging in\nthis literature have very little effect on overall brain metabolism and, specifically, glucose\nuse by the brain. Clarke and Sokoloff (1998) remarked that although \"[a] common view\nequates concentrated mental effort with mental work...there appears to be no increased\nenergy utilization by the brain during such processes\" (p. 664), arguing that \"...the areas\nthat participate in the processes of such reasoning represent too small a fraction of the brain\nfor changes in their functional and metabolic activities to be reflected in the energy\nmetabolism of the brain...\" (p. 675). Messier (2004) similarly concluded that it is \"unlikely\nthat the blood glucose changes observed during and after a difficult cognitive task are due\nto increased brain glucose uptake\" (p. 39). This conclusion was recently echoed by Gibson\n(2007), who concluded that \"task-induced changes in human peripheral blood glucose are\nunlikely to reflect changes in relevant areas of brain glucose supply\" (p. 75).\nBrain imaging data provide powerful evidence about how much glucose\ncomputational mechanisms consume. Recently, Raichle and Mintun (2006), in their review\nof brain imaging, suggested that \"regional increases in absolute blood flow...rarely affect\nthe overall rate of brain blood flow during even the most arousing perceptual and vigorous\nmotor activity\" (p. 467, emphasis added). They argue that relative to the continuous energy\nexpenditure of the brain, local energy consumption due to a particular task \"could be as\nlittle as 1%.\" Indeed, they conclude that the delivery of additional glucose is not the reason\nthat blood flow increases to particular brain regions during particular tasks.\nAnother way to understand the magnitudes involved is to consider the numbers in\nterms of the familiar unit of calories. The brain as a whole consumes about one quarter of\none calorie per minute (Clarke and Sokoloff, 1998). The consumption rate for the fraction\nof the brain involved in the particular computations associated with \"self control\" must,\nlogically, be much smaller than .25 calories per minute. A one percent increase across the\nentire brain would, over the course of a 5-minute task, consume .01 X (5 minutes X .25\ncalories/minute) = .0125 calories. Suppose that one grants, for the sake of argument, an\norder of magnitude greater effect, a 10% increase (occasionally seen in regional changes\nusing PET; Madsen et al., 1995). Suppose one also grants this increase in glucose\nconsumption not just for the mechanisms involved in the self-control task \u00ad that is, the\nmarginal computational mechanisms \u00ad but instead that this increase occurs across the entire\nbrain. If one grants these very extreme assumptions, the caloric cost would still be well less\nthan .2 calories.\nThat is, if one were to use this aggressive estimate \u00ad which could be off by multiple\norders of magnitude \u00ad the brains of subjects categorized as \"depleted\" in this literature,\nhave, relative to controls, used an additional amount of glucose equal to about 10% of a\nsingle Tic-Tac.\nThe magnitude of the plausible marginal glucose consumption by the brain is\nimportant not only in the context of evaluating the plausibility that self-control tasks,\nrelative to control tasks, are having an effect on circulating glucose levels, but also in the\ncontext of controls used in this literature. The \"placebo\" drinks used, for example, in\nGailliot et al. (2007), were sweetened with Splenda, which is marketed as a \"No Calorie\nSweetener,\" which the authors claim \"does not increase blood glucose\" (p. 330). However,\nthe marketing slogan does not reflect the fact that while sucralose, which produces the\nsensation of sweetness, is not metabolized and so contains no calories (Roberts, Renwick,\nSims, and Snodin, 2000), each packet of Splenda contains .8 grams of carbohydrates in\nGlucose and self-control\naddition to sucralose, and so contains 3 calories (USDA National Nutrient Database for\nStandard Reference, 2009), or fifteen times the estimate above.\nTo put these values in further perspective, .2 calories is roughly the number of\ncalories burned by running at a 9-minute-mile pace for about one second (Ainsworth et al.,\n2000). The claims regarding \"depletion\" turn on a minuscule, even trivial amount of\nglucose. Indeed, the conceptual difficulty is much worse. The glucose claim turns on the\npresent concentration of glucose, not its recent history (see below), and not on the reason\nfor its present level. So, if the glucose model were correct, performance on self-control\ntasks should be worse after vigorous exercise, which consumes orders of magnitude more\nglucose. (Indeed, if the glucose as resource model were taken seriously, researchers would\nnot use self-control tasks to \"deplete\" subjects, given how little glucose these tasks\nconsume.) However, exercise has consistently been found to improve performance on a\nlarge number of tasks, including \"self-control\" tasks such as the Stroop (Tomporowski,\nfound that 20 minutes of aerobic exercise, compared to resting quietly, leads to an\nimprovement in performance on tasks requiring the cognitive control of attention among\npreadolescents.\nFurther, Madsen et al. (1995) directly measured the difference in blood glucose\nconcentration of blood going into and coming out of the brain \u00ad hence measuring how\nmuch was removed from the blood by the brain \u00ad by comparing the concentration in\narteries entering the brain compared to the veins leaving the brain. They measured this 41\ntimes, before, during, and after subjects did a 10-minute Wisconsin Card Sort Task. They\nfound no change in this difference from baseline compared to activation, suggesting that\nduring the task, the brain was not differentially soaking up more glucose from the blood\nduring this cognitively demanding task than before it.\nIn short, brain metabolism changes very little overall as a function of task (see also\nLennie, 2003, p. 495). These lines of evidence converge to suggest that the brain does not\nuse more glucose during activation when subjects are performing \"self-control\" tasks\nrelative to other times and, even if the brain were using more glucose, it would be a\nminuscule amount. These ideas from the literature on brain metabolism point to the\nimportance of looking carefully at claims that the brain is using more glucose during self-\ncontrol tasks, the topic of the next section.\nRe-analysis of data from Gailliot et al. (2007)\nGailliot et al. (2007) presented the first evidence that self-control tasks of the type\nused in the broader self-control literature lead to a reduction in peripheral glucose. In Study\n1, subjects who were asked not to eat for three hours prior to the experiment had their\nglucose levels assessed as the first element of the procedure. Subjects were subsequently\ninstructed to watch a film with common words appearing on the bottom corner of the\nscreen. Half of the subjects were told to avoid looking at these words \u00ad this was the \"self-\ncontrol\" condition \u00ad and half were not so instructed. Glucose levels were then measured.\nThe prediction was that glucose levels would go down more in the self-control condition\nthan in the control condition.\nBecause the above analysis makes the finding that blood glucose goes down when\ndoing a 5-minute task very surprising in the context of the brain metabolism literature\nreviewed above, I requested the data from this study, in addition to Studies 2 through 6 (see\nGlucose and self-control\nbelow). Gailliot (personal communication) indicated that \"The data from Study 1 have been\ncorrupted.\" The relevant results, from the original manuscript, are in the first two rows of\nTable 1, but I was obviously unable to independently verify these values.\nStudy 2 investigated the hypothesis that subjects \"low in internal motivation to\nrespond without prejudice\" (IMS) would show reduction in glucose following an\ninteraction with an opposite-race person as opposed to a same-race person. In contrast, no\nsuch reduction was predicted for those high in IMS because for these subjects, \"suppressing\nprejudice should be a well practiced and hence presumably automatic way of acting\" (p.\n328). In this study, glucose drops are predicted as a function of an individual difference\nmeasure, rather than as a function of assignment to condition, so I do not analyze it further\nbecause it cannot speak as cleanly to the key issue at stake.\nIn Studies 3, 4, 5 and 6, a similar procedure to Study 1 was used. (Studies 7, 8 and 9\ninvestigated whether consuming a glucose drink improves subsequent self-control\nperformance relative to a placebo. These studies are not relevant to Proposition 2.)\nSubjects' glucose was measured and then subjects completed a self-control task, after\nwhich a glucose reading was taken. Subjects were then asked to perform a second self-\ncontrol task because the researchers were interested in the relationship between\nperformance on this second task and 1) subjects' absolute level of blood glucose, and 2) the\nlevel of glucose at the second reading, controlling for the subject's baseline glucose level.\nThe procedure up to performing the second self-control task in Studies 3 through 6\nare replications of the attention condition in Study 1 with subjects who have not been asked\nto fast. The study was designed to look at performance as a function of the change in blood\nglucose levels. That is, given, for each subject, the drop in glucose, does this value predict\nperformance?\nThese studies are the core of the reanalysis here, and it is important to take note of\nthe logic that underlies these studies. First, this analysis only makes sense if one believed,\nbefore running the study, that the drop in glucose was a meaningful measure. Suppose that\none thought that the glucose drop was not a meaningful measure for some reason, such as\nthe concern that glucose might be entering into the blood stream, adding noise in sufficient\nmagnitude to render the difference between glucose pre- and post- useless. In this case, an\nanalysis investigating performance as a function of this difference would be of no value.\nTo be clear, if one did believe that this was a concern, one would not have\nconducted this study. That is, if the key measure, the glucose drop, is compromised because\nof glucose entering the blood, then the measure cannot be used to determine if the drop\npredicts performance. Note also that if one did have this concern \u00ad that endogenous glucose\nfluctuations swamp the putative change produced by the self-control task \u00ad then clearly one\nshould not expect people who have not fasted to show a decrease in task 2 performance\nrelative to those who do not do a self-control task. The noise from endogenous glucose\nentering the blood would, on this view, swamp any effect, making it just as likely that\nsomeone in the self-control treatment would have more, or less, blood glucose than\nsomeone in the control condition.\nThese points are important because the authors did not report the blood glucose\ndrop in these four studies, arguing that because subjects didn't fast, glucose might be\nentering the blood stream. However, the reported analysis using the difference between pre-\nand post- readings means that they did not, in fact, believe that these readings were\ncompromised. The fact that they reported an analysis based on this relationship, but not the\nGlucose and self-control\nrelationship itself, indicates that there was some reason, other than the argument offered in\nthe text, that they did report these analyses.\nNotice also that using the drop in glucose rather than the absolute measure as the\npredictor variable is inconsistent with the stated theory (though it might be consistent with\na different theory). The stated theory is that glucose is a limited resource, so the prediction\nshould be that performance depends on the level of the resource. The analysis presented,\nhowever, is based on the change, which means their implicit theory is that performance\ndepends on the recent change in glucose. As an analogy, in essence, these four studies rely\non a theory in which self-control is determined by the recent drop in charge of a battery\nrather than the remaining charge in the battery.\nIn any case, change in glucose was not reported for these four studies in the original\nmanuscript. However, as noted, if the glucose model is to explain performance decreases\nfor non-fasting subjects, then, even against the backdrop of endogenous glucose variation,\nglucose levels of subjects who have performed a self-control task must go down. If they do\nnot \u00ad whether for this or some other reason \u00ad then the glucose model cannot explain\nperformance reductions among such subjects because the model is that reduced\nperformance is caused by lower levels of glucose in the blood.\nIndeed, the question of whether glucose drops among subjects who have not fasted\nis actually more relevant than the data from subjects who have fasted (as in Study 1)\nbecause this methodological requirement is not frequently used in previous research in this\nliterature (Hagger et al., in press). The glucose model is not supposed to explain self-\ncontrol failures only for people who have not eaten for three hours and so have lower\nand/or more stable glucose levels. For this reason, the data from these four studies speak\ndirectly to the model.\nThe raw data from Studies 3 through 6, and the results are shown in Table 1. Note\nthat because the raw data for Study 1 were \"corrupted,\" I report data in the first two rows\nfrom the original manuscript. For Studies 5 and 6, the sample size reflects the raw data\nprovided, which differs by one from what is reported in the manuscript. In evaluating these\nvalues, it is important to bear in mind that the accuracy (SD) of readings by the Accu-\nCheck compact meters used for the blood glucose levels in the range reported is around 3.6\nmg/dL (Roche Diagnostics, 2006). Across the three tasks, including the attention task\n(Studies 3 and 4), and two different self-control tasks (Studies 5 and 6), in none of the four\ncases did the reduction in glucose replicate. The mean glucose levels were statistically\nindistinguishable from before the task to after the task. Collapsing across the four new\nstudies, again glucose levels do not change statistically. The same is true if one combines\nall the data from all five studies.\nWe can also simply ask what proportion of subjects in each condition experienced a\ndrop in glucose, which obviously reduces the impact of outliers. This is indicated in the last\ncolumn of Table 1, and none of these is different from chance. The distribution of changes\nin glucose from baseline to post-task across Studies 3 through 6 is shown in Figure 1 and\ncan be seen to resemble a normal distribution centered at zero.\nGlucose and self-control\nTable 1. Sample size, mean (SD) absolute levels of and changes in glucose levels (in\nmg/dL) in five of the studies reported in Gailliot et al. (2007). Significance tests are one-\ntailed, following the original manuscript.\nStudy Task n\nGlucose\nGlucose\nFraction\nIncrease\nAttention\nControl\nAttention\nControl\nAttention\nControl\nEmotion\nRegulation\nIn summary, although Gailliot et al. (2007) reported only those data consistent with\ntheir prediction, the complete dataset undermines the hypothesis that these tasks reduce the\nlevel of peripheral glucose. Obviously, if performing a short self-control task does not\nreduce glucose among subjects who have not fasted, then the glucose account of the effect\non task 2 performance cannot be correct for such subjects.\nThe difference between the Study 1 results and the results of Study 3 through 6\ncould be due to the fact that subjects fasted before Study 1, a Type 1 error in Study 1, or\nType II errors in Studies 3-6. If the result is due to fasting, then the glucose model does not\napply to subjects who have not recently fasted, and therefore cannot explain the results of\nthe studies the model is intended to explain.\nGlucose and self-control\nFigure 1. Histogram of changes in blood glucose levels between baseline and the\ncompletion of the first self-control task in Studies 3 through 6 in Gailliot et al (2007).\nValues on the x-axis reflect the top value of the bin (e.g., \"20\" corresponds to the values 11\nthrough 20). One observation (75) is not pictured.\nChange in Glucose (mg/dL)\nNumber of Subjects\nIf the result is not due to fasting, then the possibility of a Type 1 error in Study 1\nseems likely. In Study 1, mean glucose for subjects in the key cell in which glucose was\npredicted to go down started quite high, 107.1 mg/dL, even though these subjects were\nasked to fast for three hours before the experiment. Taking a weighted mean across all cells\nin all conditions, the mean of subjects' glucose coming into the lab was 103.0 mg/dL.\nEstimating the standard deviation of 20, given n = 168, we can estimate the standard error\nof the mean to be roughly 1.5 mg/dL. If we assume this estimate, a mean of 107.1 mg/dL is\nmore than two standard errors away.\nSo, the mean glucose level in the key cell in which glucose had to decline to see an\neffect was well above the mean of the population. If changes in glucose levels over the\nperiod of the study are a random walk (see Figure 1), then regression to the mean could\nhave led to the appearance of a reduction in glucose due to the task. The single case in\nwhich glucose was found to decline, then, might be simply to an unlucky draw of 52\nsubjects whose glucose was particularly high.\nDvorak and Simons (2009) have recently provided additional evidence of a glucose\ndrop among subjects performing a self-control task. In this work, subjects were asked to\nfast for three hours, as in Study 1 of Gailliot et al. (2007). Subjects watched videos, one\nhumorous and one disgusting, and then given anagrams to solve, some of which were\nsolvable, others of which were not. Some subjects were told to suppress their emotions\nwhile watching the video, while control subjects were not so instructed. Supporting the\nview that the initial 107.1 mg/dL measure in Gailliot et al (2007) was anomalous, the\naverage glucose level for the 180 subjects in this study who had fasted for three hours was\n97.7 mg/dl, with a SD of 11.0, yielding a standard error of about .8. It is important to note\nthat blood glucose did fall more in the suppression condition (97 mg/dl to 92 mg/dl) than in\nthe control condition (98 mg/dl to 95 mg/dl). These results suggest that among subjects\nGlucose and self-control\nwho have fasted, emotion suppression does lead to a larger glucose drop, though the\npossibility that this effect is driven by what is going on in the periphery, rather than the\nbrain, when one is suppressing emotion cannot be excluded.\nGlucose level: constraint or input?\nThe data in Gailliot et al. (2007) do not support the claim that, at least for non-\nfasting subjects, self-control tasks reduce the level of glucose in the blood. The level of\nglucose \u00ad or the recent change in level of glucose \u00ad might, nonetheless, affect performance\non many kinds of tasks, including, perhaps, \"self-control\" tasks (e.g., Donohoe, and\nBenton, 1999; Scholey et al., 2001). This issue is, however, subject to a certain amount of\ndebate. Gibson (2007) suggested that the evidence surrounding this relationship is\n\"divergent\" and that there is \"no clear mechanistic model that satisfactorily explains\" the\ndiversity of results. He concludes that \"...overall brain function appears to be quite\ninsensitive to such fluctuations in blood glucose...\" (p. 80), with clear benefits being\n\"limited to hippocampally mediated verbal memory\" (p. 71). Green, Elliman, and Rogers\n(1997) found no relationship between glucose levels and their measures of cognitive\nfunction, and concluded that \"the brain is, therefore, relatively invulnerable to short-term\ndeprivation,\" suggesting that effects might be seen only \"after several days of total food\nIf, however, some relationship exists, it need not necessarily be the one implied by a\nresource account. (See Gibson, 2007, for a list of possibilities.) Glucose, like water and\noxygen, is central to biological activities. The level of each of these is monitored by\nappropriate systems, and these levels probably influence behavior. In particular, it seems\nlikely that readings of these levels computed by some mechanisms can act as inputs to\nother mechanisms that influence the deployment of computational resources.\nConsider, for example, research in the animal literature, in particular on risk-\nsensitive foraging. The level of risk that an organism will endure depends on its current\nstate (Stephens, 1981). Organisms in a low caloric state will engage in more risky foraging\nbehavior. A resource construal of this effect would be that blood glucose is necessary in\norder for the organism to suppress risky foraging behavior. An input account, which seems\nmore likely, would be that there are mechanisms designed to monitor calories, and that the\ninformation produced by this mechanism acts as an input to a decision-making system\nregarding foraging. When calories are low, foraging is up-regulated.\nIn the same way that a low reading on a putative \"sociometer\" mechanism (Leary\nand Baumeister, 2000), for example, might motivate behavior to increase one's social value\n(at the expense of other priorities), mechanisms that monitor material needs might have\nsimilar effects. Messier (2004) reviewed evidence that is consistent with such an account in\nthe context of memory effects \u00ad though similar pathways might explain effects in other\ndomains \u00ad suggesting that \"a number of observations suggest the existence of one or more\nperipheral mechanisms that mediate the effects of glucose and other sugars as well as of\nother nutrients. Possible mechanisms include glucose-responsive neurons in the liver or\nelsewhere that transmit a neural message via the vagus nerve and a hormonal mediator\nreleased by the gut which could act in the periphery or centrally to influence brain activity\nrelated to memory processing\" (p. 48). Gibson and Green (2002) similarly summarize the\ndata relevant to this claim: \"The change in cognitive performance after administration of\nglucose, and other foods, may depend on the level of sympathetic activation, glucocorticoid\nGlucose and self-control\nsecretion, and pancreatic -cell function, rather than simple fuelling of neural activity\" (pp.\n169-170), and, more directly, they argue that \"behavioural effects of glucose ingestion\nshould not be seen as resulting from simple fuelling of neural activity\" (p. 198; see Rogers\nand Lloyd, 1994, and Green et al., 1997, for similar remarks regarding the role of\nsympathetic activity).\nWhy might the level of glucose in the blood be relevant to tasks requiring attention?\nOrganisms have mechanisms designed to make adaptive decisions about how their\ncomputational resources \u00ad such as those frequently discussed using the rubric of \"attention\"\n\u00ad ought to be deployed. In the same way that sensory information recruits attention \u00ad\nthreats from predators, mating opportunities, and so on \u00ad internal variables probably\ninfluence the deployment of resources. Thirsty organisms' attention is probably deployed\naround the task of acquiring water in the same way that hungry organisms' attention is\nallocated to determining how to find food. Given that computation is finite, there are\nnecessary tradeoffs. An organism computing means of gaining food, acquiring water,\nimpressing a mate, or evading a predator, is to some extent not using computational\nresources for the other tasks.\nTo the extent that glucose levels influence such computations, the degree of\ncomputational resources allocated to the particular cognitive task assigned by an\nexperimenter might well vary as a function of, perhaps, both absolute levels of glucose and\nrecent changes in glucose. Indeed, Scholey, S\u00fcnram-Lea, Greer, Elliott, and Kennedy\n(2009) recently took such a view, suggesting: \"One mechanism through which glucose acts\nas a cognition enhancer is through allocation of attentional resources.\" (p. 549). (See\nMessier, 2004, for proposals regarding detection mechanisms in the periphery that\ninfluence central nervous system performance.) Wang and Dvorak (2010) recently\npresented a related idea, suggesting that their \"findings suggest an adaptive mechanism\nlinking human decision making to metabolic cues\" (p. 4).\nMechanisms of these types might explain the relationship between peripheral\nglucose and performance. In this context, consider physical exercise performance, an area\nin which a resource or fuel model would seem to be a very likely model to explain\nperformance. That is, one might think that in the context of physical exercise, the idea that\nglucose is a constraint on performance would be even more likely to be the case than in the\ncontext of mental activity. If glucose is in fact an input in the context of exercise, the\npossibility that it is an input in the context of self control would be particularly plausible.\nChambers, Bridge, and Jones (2009) recently investigated the effect of a glucose-\nrich beverage compared to placebo placed in one's mouth and then spit out, rather than\ningested, on real, rather than metaphorical, muscles, studying people engaged in physical\nexercise. They found that simply putting the glucose in the mouth of cyclists improved\ntheir performance. They conclude that \"improvement in exercise performance that is\nobserved when carbohydrate is present in the mouth may be due to the activation of brain\nregions believed to be involved in reward...\" (p. 1779). Carter, Jeukendrup, and Jones\n(2004a) showed a similar result, concluding that \"the mechanism responsible for the\nimprovement in high-intensity exercise performance with exogenous carbohydrate appears\nto involve an increase in central drive or motivation rather than having any metabolic\ncause\" (p. 2107). Further, provocatively, simply infusing glucose into the blood does not\nimprove exercise performance (Carter, Jeukendrup, Mann, and Jones, 2004b), strongly\nsuggesting that it is the signal, rather than the glucose itself, that drives performance\nGlucose and self-control\nincreases.\nPottier, Bouckaert, Gilis, Roels, and Derave (2010) obtained a similar result and\nsuggested that the improvement observed when subjects rinsed with carbohydrate (CHO)\nsolutions derive from the possibility that \"fatigue signals from the muscles to the brain are\nbeing suppressed unconsciously by afferent CHO signals from the CHO receptors in the\noral cavity to certain areas of the brain\" (p. 109). This idea, that sugar in the mouth reduces\nsensations of effort, in turn influencing behavior, resonates closely with the idea that\nglucose is an input, rather than constraint.\nIn short, persistence on \"self-control\" tasks might depend on representations of\ncosts and benefits of continuing (Kurzban, in press). The perception of high glucose\nconcentrations in the mouth might activate reward systems, leading to increased effort on\ntasks. If physical effort can be explained by virtue of understanding glucose as an input or\nreward, mental effort might be similarly explained. This changes glucose in the blood or\nthe digestive tract from a resource tethering performance to an input that feeds into\ndecision-making systems that ultimately determine the allocation of continued effort,\nwhether physical or mental.\nConclusion\nThe data from Studies 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Gailliot et al. (2007), which replicate the\nprocedure in Study 1 and are directly relevant to the hypothesis that self-control tasks\nreduce levels of glucose in the blood, lead to a conclusion opposite to the ones that the\nauthors reached: exerting self control does not reduce levels of glucose in the bloodstream.\nIf one accepts this conclusion, because the glucose drop is a logically necessary component\nof the glucose account, the data reported in the manuscript undermine, rather than support,\nthis account. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that subjects in Study 1 were\ninstructed to fast. If glucose drops only among subjects who fasted before studies of this\nnature, then the glucose model cannot explain data from all those studies in which subjects\ndid not fast. Data from Dvorak and Simons (2009) support the view that relative glucose\ndrops occur in subjects who have fasted for the particular task they used.\nThe failure to find the effect predicted by the glucose model of self-control is not\nsurprising given what is known about brain metabolism. Even very different computational\ntasks result in very similar glucose consumption by the brain. The neuroscience literature\nvery strongly implies that the marginal difference in glucose consumption by five minutes\nof \"self-control\" tasks is unlikely in the extreme to be of any significant size. The research\non exercise shows that burning calories through physical activity, which should have much\ngreater \"depleting\" effects, in fact shows the reverse pattern. Even if it were the case that\nself-control reduced levels of peripheral glucose, the cause of the reduction is not in line\nwith a \"resource\" account in which self-control mechanisms burn through glucose in the\nbrain and are impaired by the subsequent lack of glucose, but rather a cascade of effects\nmediated through peripheral systems.\nFurther, holding aside failures to replicate the basic effects (Murtaugh and Todd,\n2004), it would seem that the glucose model \u00ad or any \"resource\" model \u00ad is undermined by\ndemonstrations that \"depleted\" subjects can do just as well as non-depleted subjects on a\nsubsequent self-control task if they are given a gift (Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, and\nMuraven, 2007). To the extent that such findings are taken to support the resource account,\nit is only because the model is sufficiently protean to accommodate essentially any\nGlucose and self-control\nfindings.\nThe weight of evidence implies that the glucose model of self-control in particular \u00ad\nand perhaps the resource model in general \u00ad ought to be carefully rethought. If there is no\nplausible candidate for the putative resource, then the resource metaphor ought to be\nabandoned. From a computational perspective, a \"resource\" account is the wrong kind of\nexplanation for performance decrements to begin with. No one whose computer is\nperforming slowly would think that the fault lies in the power supply \u00ad or the fact that\nrunning Excel for five minutes drained the battery \u00ad even though no one would deny that\nelectricity is necessary for computers. The correct explanation for changes in performance\nmight well lie in domain of computation (e.g., Dewitte, Bruyneel, and Geyskens, 2009).\n"
