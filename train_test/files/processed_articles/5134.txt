Using survey data of Chinese graduate students in two universities in the United States, I show\nhow Chinese ethnic identity salience varies with the percentage of Chinese in an individual's ego network revolving around\nhim or her. In addition, among newcomers to the United States, as the percentage Chinese in ego networks increases, the\ndecline of Chinese identity salience/prominence declines, but for old timers in the United States, as the percentage Chinese\nincreases, the decline of Chinese identity salience/prominence is reversed. The ethnic identity salience lapses with time unless\nthe respondents keep a cohort of co-nationals. Moreover, a cosmopolitan sociocultural environment is conducive to the\nmaintenance of ethnic identity when an individual has many co-nationals in his or her ego network while having many co-\nnationals does not stop the decline of ethnic salience in an isolated social environment.\n",

Self--consisting of multiple identities--emerges from\nthe patterned and organized social structure and therefore is\norganized (Burke & Stets, 2009). In contrast, traditional\nsymbolic interactionism opposes any suggestion that social\nstructure is stable and posits that identities are fluid as indi-\nviduals construct identities differently across situations.\nAlong the lines of structural symbolic interactionism,\nidentity theory specifically argues for the correspondence\nbetween social positions in networks of social relations and\nrole identities such as student. Empirical work to test and\nexplore the relationship between identity and network char-\nacteristics has appeared. McFarland and Pals (2005) opera-\ntionalize ego network1 context such as prominence to predict\nidentity change. Walker and Lynn (2013) suggest that role\nidentity salience--the likelihood a role identity is enacted--\nincreases as role-based others are more closely connected\nwith non\u00adrole-based others. Stark (2015) reveals how the\ntendency to avoid friends who have minority friends enables\nmajority group members to stay away from minority group\nmembers.\nIn this article, I answer this research question: Would\nChinese respondents in the new environment of United States\nbut with a large portion of Chinese acquaintances in their time\nnetwork2 develop a salient/prominent ethnic identity? Time\nnetwork is composed of people with whom an individual\nspends the most awake time.\nFurther, this article aims to clarify whether being sepa-\nrated from the host culture of the United States reduces the\nsalience/prominence of Chinese ethnic identity, or just\namong those who recently arrive in the host culture. Another\naim of this article is to investigate whether low exposure to\ndifferent cultures available in a locality reduces the salience/\nprominence of Chinese ethnic identity, or just among those\nwho have a large Chinese cohort.\nTheory and Hypotheses\nIdentity Prominence/Salience and Social Networks\nTo reiterate, identity theory posits that social positions--the\nstable, morphological components of social structure--carry\nthe shared behavior expectations termed \"roles.\" Role identi-\nties exist as individuals participate in structured social relation-\nships.

Given that networks of social relations are social struc-\nture (Wellman, 1988), the stable, morphological components of\nsocial structure as proposed by identity theory, or social posi-\ntions, therefore, are social positions in social networks. Identity\nsalience is a function of the strength and number of social rela-\ntions in networks, or ties (Burke & Stets, 2009). In short,\nStryker and colleagues' work is particularly articulate on the\nrelationship between identity salience and social networks.\nSocial Identity Theory and Identity Theory\nIdentity theory focuses on role identity that is related to role\nothers. For example, a parent role is in relationship to a child\nrole. Social identity such as Chinese ethnic identity emph-\nsizes in-group (i.e. Chinese) and out-group (i.e. non-Chi-\nnese) differences. However, the argument on the relationship\nbetween identity salience and social networks as specified\nin identity theory can be extended to social identities. Phinny\n(Howard, 2000) has a comprehensive review of ethnic\nidentity.\nIdentity theory scholars have actually called for a combi-\nnation of identity theory and social identity theory (Stets &\nBurke, 2000). Specifically, these scholars argue that the dif-\nferent bases of identity in social identity theory (category and\ngroup) and in identity theory (role) can be combined.\nAlthough category and group identity such as Chinese ethnic\nidentity emphasizes the similarities among in-group mem-\nbers (Hogg, 2006) while role identity stresses differences\nbetween roles and counter roles such as student identity and\nprofessor identity, role identities can also be category and\ngroup identities as students and professors are in-group and\nout-group to each other. In addition, category, group, role,\nand person identities all follow the same identity verification\nChinese Ethnic Identity\nChinese ethnic identity is a category identity. By definition,\nthe Chinese ethnic identity is conditioned by the difference\nbetween Chinese and non-Chinese as well as by the similari-\nties among Chinese as the in-group and similarities among\nnon-Chinese as the out-group. Therefore, a social network\nmeasure that captures in-group out-group contrast--percent-\nage of Chinese within the ego network--can be used to pre-\ndict salience of Chinese ethnic identity.\nIn addition, because the in-group out-group contrast is key\nto category/group identity, the Chinese ethnic identity of a\nfocal person--a Chinese person--is related with people the\nfocal person spends much time with. In other words, to under-\nstand ethnic identity, it is necessary to know an individual's\nclose relationships or ties that consist of the in-group as well\nas this person's acquaintances who are the out-group. Out-\ngroup members are those who have constant presence in the\nfocal person's life in geographical space but remain distant in\nsocial space. I thus use time network to delineate the relation-\nship between identity salience/prominence and ego network\ncharacteristics.\nHypotheses\nSocial identity theory suggests that category identity is based\non the distinction between in-group and out-group. For the\nin-group out-group distinction to maintain, there needs to be\na balance between in-group members and out-group mem-\nbers in an individual's time network. Therefore, having a\nhigh percentage of Chinese in one's time network means the\nopportunity for a person to establish the distinction between\nChinese and non-Chinese is low. I hereby hypothesize the\nfollowing:\nHypothesis 1: Having many Chinese in the time network\nis negatively related with Chinese ethnic identity for\nChinese egos.\nTime is important because it takes time for identities to\ninternalize. In this research, I am interested in short time\nspans: several months to approximately 8 years. That is, the\ntime span that would have an impact on a stable, cross situ-\national identity which is the focus of this project. I examine\nthe impact of in-person and between-person time difference\nin the United States on network and identity formation and\ntransformation.\nIn the literature of life course, Atchley (1993) suggests\nthat time after retirement witnesses a U-shaped development\nof self-perception: honeymoon, disenchantment, reorienta-\ntion, and stability. Changes in identities are constant while\ncontinuity in identities is more powerful. In addition, Burke\nmaintains that identity salience decreases as individuals can-\nnot verify their identities. With the passage of time, Chinese\ngraduate students are more and more integrated into the host\nculture with more non-Chinese, the opportunity for these stu-\ndents to verify their Chinese identity becomes slimmer.\nHowever, this process can reverse as these students' life\nbecomes stable. I hereby hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 2: Time in the United States has a U-shaped\nrelationship with Chinese identity.\nHaving a high Chinese composition in time network keeps\nindividuals from being in contact with the host culture and\nthus reduces ethnic identity saliences. However, ethnic iden-\ntity is fluid as individuals of various ethnic backgrounds are\nimpacted by ecological factors, such as politics in their deci-\nsion to claim or reclaim their ethnic identity (Alba, 1990;\nNagel, 1994). With the passage of time, the decline of Chinese\nethnic identity salience is slowed down as individuals are\nintegrated more into the host culture. I hereby hypothesize the\nfollowing:\nHypothesis 3: A longer stay in the United States will slow\ndown the decline of Chinese identity salience when indi-\nviduals have a higher Chinese cohort composition.\nSociocultural contexts or locations in the United States,\nanother ecological factor influencing ethnic identity, are\nimportant in the interaction of identity and networks of\nsocial relations as this research is designed to test relational\nidentity. Identity theory defines identity as internalized\nmeanings existent in the culture in the larger society which\nis supported by ethnic identity literature (e.g., Ichiyama,\nMcQuarrie, & Ching, 1996). That is, identity meanings are\nculturally determined. Consequently, it is important to\nexplain the \"cultural contingency\" of a social environment\nthe precedence or the consequence of identities depending\non the specific social environments. A social environment\nprovides the cultural meanings that may be absorbed into\nthe self-structure, and thus constrains the types of available\nidentities. More complex social environments can poten-\ntially generate more identities because of the many subcul-\ntures existent in such environments. Social environments\nalso offer different types of social relations at the dyadic\nand group levels which either enhance or constrain the for-\nmation of new identities.\nIn addition, distinctiveness theory (Mehra, Kilduff, &\nBrass, 1998) proposes that in a given situation, the trait such\nas race that is the rarest in the crowd will draw people with\nthat trait together. Therefore, in an environment where ethnic\nbackground is the rarest trait, people feel more strongly\nabout their ethnic identity. However, in a social context\nwhere diverse ethnic groups are present, people feel less\nstrongly about their ethnic identity. I hereby hypothesize the\nfollowing:\nHypothesis 4: Being in Northeast City (NE) in the New\nEngland area with exposure to various cultures is nega-\ntively related to Chinese identity compared with residents\nfrom Southeast City (SE).\nAs stated previously, having a high percentage Chinese in\none's network has a negative relationship with identity\nsalience/prominence. However, being in NE stems the\ndecline of Chinese ethnic identity salience/prominence\nbecause the existence of multiple cultures renders Chinese\nethnic background a sharp contrast to the host culture in the\nUnited States. As explained by Howard (2000), \"Population\nshifts, especially immigrations, are a major instigator of\nchanges in ethnic identities\" (p. 375). I hereby hypothesize\nthe following:\nHypothesis 5: Being in NE slows down the decline of\nChinese ethnic identity salience at a higher Chinese\ncomposition.\nMethod\nSample and Procedure\nTo identify patterns of linkages between ego network, time in\nthe United States, and localities in the United States and iden-\ntity, I conducted online surveys (Sue & Ritter, 2007) with a\nsupplementary paper version of the surveys (Dillman, 2007;\nWeiseburg, 2005) targeting the entire population of Chinese\ngraduate students at two universities. I used two public uni-\nversities--Harmony College in SE and Diversity College in\nNE as the subject frames though the subject's ego network\nusually reached far beyond the boundaries of the two col-\nleges, extending to the local communities and to their home\ncountry of China, assisted by physical and electronic interac-\ntion, particularly when these students first arrived in the\nUnited States and in their interaction with their family mem-\nbers back in China. Because the students from the two univer-\nsities were similar in terms of educational attainment in\nChina, localities in China, age group, and being city residents\nin China, I did not include variables associated with their\nChinese background to predict identity salience/prominence.\nThe survey was distributed to all Chinese graduate students\nthrough university administrative offices. Although I did not\nknow the exact number of the Chinese graduate students at\nDiversity College, I estimated the combined responses for the\nonline version of the survey from the two universities proba-\nbly accounted for around 15% of the population. The print ver-\nsion fared much better. The two batches of mail survey using\nexactly the same online format witnessed 70% response rate.\nSome responses in the second batch were not included because\nthey arrived later than the deadline. There were 95 total\nresponses to the online survey at Harmony College. At\nDiversity College, there were 21 responses to the online sur-\nvey and 56 responses to the print version of the online survey.\nIn total, Diversity College provided 77 responses to the sur-\nvey. Usable responses were 119 from the two colleges which\nwas sufficient for a multivariate analysis (Allison, 1999).\nThe survey asked for the respondents'general sociodemo-\ngraphic information, respondents' time network, and the\nimportance of ethnic identity. For each person named in time\nnetwork, I asked about his or her demographics and relation-\nships with the focal person. I also asked for an aggregate\nnumber of ties in time network. I calculated percentage of\nChinese for the networks thus obtained in the survey.\nThe identity salience/prominence section asked the\nrespondent to rate the importance of ethnic identity (Chinese\nfrom mainland China). The question read, \"We now ask the\nimportance of the major identities you might have. Please\ndrag the importance indicator along the scale 0-100, `1'being\nleast important and `100' the most important.\"\n4 SAGE Open\nThe survey took approximately 10 to 15 min to complete\non average though some respondents took longer (20-25\nmin). Students read a verbal script highlighting the voluntary\nnature of the questionnaire and my intent of protecting their\nanonymity.\nFor the analysis, I used both the basic term and the qua-\ndratic term of the time in the U.S. variable. First, I used per-\ncentage Chinese, time, a quadratic term of time, and locations\nas predictors and network size as control variable. Second, I\nadded interaction terms of the basic term and the quadratic\nterm of time, with the two network measures: percentage\nChinese and network size. Third, I added the interaction\nterms of location in the United States with the two network\nmeasures. I also added another control variable of gender\nwith male coded as 1.\nMeasures\nThe dependent variable identity salience/prominence was\nmeasured using a scale of identity importance ranging from\nuted importance of identities as the fundamental elements\nof self. Although defining identity salience as behavioral\noriented, Stryker and colleagues use identity salience and\nidentity prominence interchangeably as a concept and mea-\nTime in the United States was measured with years the\nrespondents had spent in the host country. Because the vast\nmajority of the respondents started their graduate program\nimmediately upon arrival in the host country of the United\nStates, I recoded time in graduate programs as time in the\nUnited States. As a new identity for the respondents, Chinese\nethnic identity showed a trajectory in salience/prominence\nwith the passage of time. This identity change process is\ngradual and takes place over a long period of time, ranging\nfrom weeks to months or even years (Burke & Stets, 2009).\nLocation in the United States was measured by delegating\n\"1\" to NE and \"0\" to Southeast city. These two locations\nwere selected because they demonstrated tremendous differ-\nences in ethnic compositions and degrees of cultural diver-\nsity as shown in Table 1.\nMajor Predictor: Percentage Chinese in Ego's\nTime Network\nThe major network measure to predict identity salience/\nprominence was percentage Chinese. The percentage\nChinese measure was calculated by dividing the number of\nChinese ties within a person's time network by the person's\ntotal number of ties. Percentage Chinese indicates a focal\nperson's access (Burt, 1984) to in-group members (Chinese)\nand by definition nonaccess to out-group members (non-Chi-\nnese). Descriptive analysis and hypotheses testing were\nbased on these data using Stata. The larger the percentage\nChinese measure is, the larger the Chinese in-group is for the\nindividual. Stated in a different way, larger percentage\nChinese measure shows that an individual was more embed-\nded in his or her home Chinese culture. Or conversely, larger\npercentage Chinese measure means that an individual was\nhaving limited contact with the host culture.\nControl Variables: Network Size and Gender\nI included two control variables: the size of the time network\nand gender. Identity theory maintains that the number of ties\nsupporting an identity is important to predict identity\nsalience/prominence (Burke & Stets, 2009; Stryker & Serpe,\n1994). Chinese and non-Chinese both functioned to help a\nfocal person to maintain the Chinese ethnic identity as\ndefined by the concept of ethnic identity. Chinese cohorts\nreminded an individual of what Chinese culture specified\nwhile non-Chinese acquaintances were a contrast group.\nTable 1. Demographic and Cultural Diversity Comparison of the SE and NE against the United States as a Country.\nDemographics Southeast city Northeast city United States\nLanguage other than English spoken\nat home\nGender was included as a control variable because literature\nsuggests people experience the host culture in the United States\ndifferently as a result of their gender, particularly immigrants\nResults\nThe demographic characteristics of the survey respondents\nare presented in Table 2.\nAround half of the sample was male (50%). Respondents\nyears. Over half of the sample was from Diversity College\n(54%). The length of stay in the United States ranged from 0\nto 9 years, with a mean of 3.2 years.\nThere were two network variables included in the descrip-\ntive statistics. The time network size was 3.90 on average\nThe percentage of Chinese people in this network was high:\nResults of regression analysis are presented in Table 3.\nAs shown in Table 3, Hypotheses 1, 3, 4, and 5 were sup-\nported. Consistent with social identity theory, having many\nChinese co-nationals in one's time network deprived a person's\nopportunity to perceive the boundary between Chinese and non-\nChinese due to the lack of separation from the native Chinese\nculture. Hypothesis 1 was supported that the higher percentage\nofChinesecohortsanindividualhad,thelowerhisorherChinese\nethnic identity salience/prominence ( = -.66, p < .05) was.\nContrary to the literature on the relationship between time\nand identity in general, results showed no significant\nU-shaped relationship between the time spent in the United\nStates and Chinese ethnic identity. Therefore, Hypothesis 2\nwas not supported. However, there was a significant negative\nrelationship between time spent in the United States and\nChinese ethnic identity ( = -14.93, p < .05). That is, Chinese\nethnic identity was the strongest when the respondents first\narrived in the United States and diminished as they were more\nand more integrated into the host culture in the United States.\nThis can be because China is a highly homogeneous country\nwith over 90% of the population belonging to the Han ethnic\ngroup while the host country of the United States has a very\nsmall percentage Chinese in its population. This conclusion is\nnot surprising as the literature on the relationship between\ntime and ethnic identity does support that the length of time in\na new environment and the identification with home culture\nhave a negative relationship (Ichiyama et al., 1996).\nThe analysis also revealed a negative relationship between\nbeing in NE and Chinese ethnic identity ( = -50.82, p <\n.05). That is, being a resident of NE which is highly diverse\nin racial composition and cultures led to lower Chinese eth-\nnic identity. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 is supported.\nHypotheses 4 and 5 predicted moderation effects of time\nand place in the relationship between percentage Chinese\nand identity salience/prominence. There was a significant\ninteraction between percentage Chinese and time in the\nUnited States ( = 0.13, p < .01). There was also a significant\ninteraction between percentage Chinese and place ( = 0.56,\np < .05). Figures 1 and 2 showed the moderation effects of\ntime and place, respectively, on the relationship between\nidentity salience/prominence and percentage Chinese.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the negative relationship between\nidentity salience/prominence and percentage Chinese was sig-\nnificantly strengthened among residents of SE while only mar-\nginally lowered among residents of NE. These findings have\nbeen confirmed by the slope analysis (Aiken & West, 1991).\nFor residents in NE, the simple slope for the first-order t was Y\nTable 2.

That is, among residents in NE, as the percent-\nage Chinese increased in ego networks, the decline of Chinese\nidentity salience/prominence also declined but at much a\nlower rate compared with residents in SE.\nFor respondents from NE, the average score of Chinese\nethnic identity was 73.88. For respondents from SE, the\naverage score of Chinese ethnic identity was 78.18.\nAs Figure 3 illustrates, the negative relationship between\nidentity salience/prominence and percentage Chinese was sig-\nnificantly strengthened among residents who had stayed in the\nUnited States for a short period of time while marginally\nreversed among respondents who had stayed in the United\nStates for a longer period of time.These findings have been con-\nfirmed by the slope analysis (Aiken & West, 1991). For\nrespondents with a short stay of 1.16 years in the United States\non average, the simple slope for the first-order t wasY= (-0.52)\nidentity salience/prominence was 72.81. For respondents with a\nstay of 5.24 years in the United States on average, the simple\n.01), and the average score of Chinese identity salience/promi-\nnence was 55.9. In other words, among newcomers to the\nUnited States, as the percentage Chinese increased in ego net-\nworks, the decline of Chinese identity salience/prominence\ndeclined, but for old timers in the United States, as the percent-\nage Chinese increased in ego networks, the decline of Chinese\nidentity salience/prominence was reversed.\nDiscussion\nImplications\nThis study contributes to our understanding of the social con-\ntexts in which ethnic identity varies in salience/prominence.\nThe immediate social environment of ego network provides\nthe arena for the cognitive and affective formation of ethnic\nin-group and out-group contrast for a person. However, ego\nnetwork is not immune to the larger social context with vari-\nous ethnic compositions in population and different degrees\nof culture diversity. A cosmopolitan sociocultural environ-\nment with high degree of diversity in terms of race/ethnicity\nand culture is conducive to the maintenance of ethnic iden-\ntity when an individual has many co-nationals in his or her\nego network. On the contrary, having many co-nationals in\none's ego network does not stop the decline of ethnic\nsalience/prominence in an isolated social environment.\nAlso, as an ethnic group who are recent arrivals in the\nUnited States from a highly homogeneous social context in\nmainland China, the heightened sense of ethnic identity\nformed at arrival lapses with time as the respondents become\nmore familiar with the social environment in the United\nStates. However, keeping a cohort of co-nationals changes\nthe function of time on Chinese ethnic identity salience.\nAmong newcomers to the United States, as the percentage\nChinese increases in ego networks, the decline of Chinese\nidentity salience/prominence declines, but for old timers in\nthe United States, as the percentage Chinese increases in ego\nnetworks, the decline of Chinese identity salience/promi-\nnence is reversed. Ethnic identity seems to require a balance\nbetween host culture and home culture to maintain.\nThe reason for the function of the percentage Chinese to\nvary with time can be the different degree of consciousness\nabout the differences between their home culture and the host\nculture. As the newcomers have limited knowledge of the host\nculture in the United States, by keeping many co-nationals in\ntheir social networks, they construct a home culture around\nthem and thus do not have to confront the differences between\ntheir home culture and the host culture. Without knowledge of\nthe differences between their home culture and host culture,\ntheir ethnic identity gradually declines in salience. However,\nFigure 2. Moderation effect of location on identity salience/\nprominence at lower and higher percentage Chinese.\nFigure 3. Moderation effect of time in the United States on\nChinese ethnic identity salience/prominence at lower percentage\nChinese and higher percentage Chinese.\nfor old timers, knowledge of the host culture is much more\nprofound. Thus, when they also have many co-nationals in\ntheir social networks, the differences between their home cul-\nture and host culture maintain sharp in their consciousness as\na result of deepened knowledge of the host culture and famil-\niarity with the home culture. This mindset is conducive to high\nethnic identity salience.\nThis study highlights the importance of the assumption of\nstructural symbolic interactionism: the stability of social struc-\nture exemplified in social positions in social networks and cor-\nresponding identities. In addition, the wisdom of identity\ntheory that social structure is multi-layered (Merolla, Serpe,\nStryker, & Schultz, 2012) is confirmed by the impact of local-\nity on the interaction of ego networks and identity salience/\nprominence. This wisdom is reiterated by scholars in social\nnetwork analysis as the ecological perspective of social net-\nworks (McFarland, Moody, Diehl, Smith, & Thomas, 2014).\nLast but not least, the verification model proposed by Burke\nand colleagues (Burke & Stets, 2009) seems to be a robust\nmodel as ethnic identity salience/prominence declines when\nan individual living in an isolated social environment with\nmany other co-nationals cannot verify his or her ethnic iden-\ntity based on in-group out-group distinction because this per-\nson never separates from his or her native culture. Meanwhile,\nthe fluidity of ethnic identity is highlighted with the significant\nimpact of time and location on the interaction of identity\nsalience/prominence and ego networks. Therefore, the vari-\nance of ethnic identity can be described as patterned fluidity.\nLimitations of Study\nI use identity prominence to measure identity salience. A bet-\nter measure of identity salience needs to replace the current\nidentity importance measure as identity salience is behavior\noriented while identity importance has various conceptual-\nizations. Identity prominence and salience were merged con-\nceptually and empirically in earlier works (Stryker & Serpe,\n1994). In addition, a distinction and a causal ordering\nbetween identity prominence and salience have been made,\ntested, and supported (Brenner, Serpe, & Stryker, 2014).\nHowever, because ethnic identity is a valued identity, the\nresults should remain the same using a behavior-oriented\nmeasure given the causal relationship between identity\nprominence and salience.\nThe dependent variable of identity prominence is mea-\nsured by one-item question of how important Chinese ethnic\nidentity is. Although one-item measure of identity promi-\nnence was used by scholars researching on identity, multiple-\nitem measure of identity salience provides better reliability\nand has been proposed by Stryker and colleagues (Merolla\net al., 2012). Future studies should use the multi-item mea-\nsure of identity salience.\nThe calculation of the major predictor percentage Chinese is\nbased on respondents'estimates of the number of total ties and\nChinese ties in their time network. The advantage of calculat-\ning percentage Chinese using estimates is that respondents are\nnot limited to a certain number of ties. However, because of\ncognitive obstacles respondents experience when recalling\npeople in their time network, such a measure suffers in preci-\nsion compared with ties generated through a name generator.\nFuture research can use name generator for better measure of\npercentage Chinese.\nFuture Researches\nLimitations notwithstanding, the article presents some impor-\ntant findings and has important implications. The immediate\nsocial environment of ego networks is a significant predictor\nof identity salience. The ecological factors of place and time\nadd complexity to the relationship between ego networks and\nidentity salience.We must be conscious of the balance between\nthe stability and fluidity of the Chinese ethnic identity condi-\ntioned by various levels of social structure.\nThis study relates to the gradual growth of the scholarship\non the link between identity and social networks as follows.\nFirst, this research on Chinese ethnic identity and social net-\nworks is a continuation of the current literature with its empha-\nsis on using network measures highlighting the structure of\nsocial networks to predict identity variables. Walker and Lynn\n(2013) find that the \"embeddedness of RBOs, the breadth of\naccess that a role-based group has to the rest of an individual's\nnetwork\" is statistically significant to predict the salience of\nreligious, student, and work identities (p. 151). McFarland and\nPals (2005) suggest network measures of prominence, homo-\ngeneity, and bridging are more powerful in predicting identity\nchange than categories. Stark (2015) proposes that the \"triadic\nclosure\" mediates the effect of prejudiced individuals' avoid-\nanceoffriendshipswithmembersofminoritygroups.Similarly,\nin this study, the measure of proportion of Chinese in a Chinese\ngraduate student's network is a structural measure of an indi-\nvidual's network: these students'access to co-nationals, or their\nnonaccess to the host culture in the United States.\nSecond, this study differs from the current identity theory\nliterature in the measure of identity salience. Brenner, Serpe,\nand Stryker (2014) use a more behavior-oriented definition\nfor identity salience in recent works and show a causal rela-\ntionship between identity salience and identity prominence.\nThis study uses an importance indicator to measure identity\nsalience. However, as there is a causal relationship between\nidentity salience and identity prominence and ethnic identity\nis a valued identity similar to other valued identities, it is\nhighly likely a more behavior-oriented measure of identity\nsalience as used by Stryker and colleagues would yield simi-\nlar results as the one used in this study with regard to the link\nbetween identity salience and social networks.\nThird, this study adds to the literature on the link between\nidentity and social networks by analyzing a social identity:\nChinese ethnic identity. Previous researches investigate how\nnetwork structure impacts role identities, which are the focus\nof identity theory. This article shows that the salience of\nsocial identities can also be predicted by network measures.\nThe combination of identity theory and social identity theory\n8 SAGE Open\nsubstantiated by social network analysis provides new theo-\nretical insight into the identity processes.\nThat is, researchers can examine other social identities\nsuch as nationality based identities and gender identity with a\nnationality or gender homogeneity measure because the eth-\nnic homogeneity network measure--proportion of Chinese in\na focal person's network--is effectively used for the analysis\nof Chinese ethnic identity in this study. Essentially, category/\ngroup identities are grounded in the contrast between the in-\ngroup and the out-group. Therefore, the proportion of people\nwith the same category/group membership is a feasible mea-\nsure for access to people with the same category/group mem-\nbership. This is an addition to the current literature and\nexplains why the homogeneity measure is not a functional\nmeasure for role identities such as student as found by Walker\n"
