National data suggest that PAD diagnosed via ankle-\nbrachialpressureindex(ABI)criteriaispresentin5millionUS\nadults (4). Black adults have been consistently reported to be\nmorelikelytohavePADthanarewhiteadults(4\u00ad6).Thisgreater\nrisk for PAD has been shown to be only partially explained by\nracial differences in traditional or novel CVD risk factors (5, 6).\nTherefore, the identification of additional factors that may con-\ntribute to this racial disparity in PAD is of primary public health\nimportance.\nIncreasing evidence from several lines of research suggests\nthat exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light radiation (290\u00ad315\nnm), which decreases with increasing latitude and which is\nlower during winter in nonequatorial regions, may influence\nthe risk of CVD (7\u00ad9). Because skin production is the prin-\ncipal source of vitamin D and because it is dependent on UVB\nradiation, vitamin D has been hypothesized to play a role in the\npathogenesis of CVD. However, evidence from clinical stud-\nies of the association of concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin\nD [25(OH)D], the primary circulating storage form of vitamin\nD, with cardiovascular events has been mixed. Studies have\nreported lower 25(OH)D concentrations in cerebrovascular\npatients, but high 25(OH)D concentrations have been reported\nin ischemic heart disease patients (14). More recent evidence\nsuggests that low 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with\nhigher rates of hypertension (15), myocardial infarction (16),\nVitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in the United States\nand around the world. Low vitamin D status has been estimated\nBlacks are one of several groups that are at high risk of vitamin\nD deficiency. Several factors may account for this racial dispar-\nity, including greater cutaneous melanin content, which blocks\nthe initial conversion of 7-dihydrocholesterol to previtamin\nin the skin (20, 21); a dietary intake that includes a lower\nconsumption of dairy products and other foods fortified with\nvitamin D (22, 23); and racial differences in vitamin D me-\nRecent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) suggested an association between vita-\nmin D deficiency and PAD (26).

We further sought to determine whether any of the risk for\nPAD in black adults may be explained by racial differences in\nvitamin D status.\nStudy design and population\nThe present study was based on data from NHANES 2001\u00ad\n2004 that was conducted by the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNHANES is an ongoing data-collection initiative that employs a\ncomplex, multistage, stratified probability-sampling design to\nselect participants representative of the noninstitutionalized ci-\nvilian US population. Data collection occurred during a home\ninterview and a health examination conducted in a mobile ex-\namination center.\nFor our purposes, we excluded persons who did not complete\nABI testing (n  800), those who were missing 25(OH)D infor-\ntypically is indicative of noncompressible vessels. The remain-\ntion for analyses.\nAll subjects provided written informed consent. The Institu-\ntional Review Board at the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention approved the overall design of NHANES.\nPeripheral arterial disease\nThe presence of PAD was determined with the use of ABI, a\nhighly sensitive and specific noninvasive test (27). Participants\n40 y old who completed a physical examination as part of\nReasons for exclusion included body weight  182 kg, bilateral\namputations, or the presence of a cast, ulcer, or bandage that may\nhave interfered with the measurement. The measurements of\nbloodpressureusedtodetermineABIdifferedfromthoseusedto\ndetermine hypertension. To calculate ABI, supine systolic blood\npressurewasmeasuredontherightarm(brachialartery)andboth\nankles (posterior tibial arteries) with the use of an 8-MHz Dopp-\nler probe (Parks Mini-Laboratory IV, model 3100; Parks Medi-\ncal Electronics, Las Vegas, NV). If the right arm had a condition\nthat interfered with the measurement, the left arm was used. Each\nlimb pressure was measured twice and averaged in subjects\n40\u00ad59 y old; it was measured once in those 60 y old. Left and\nright ABIs were calculated as the respective ankle systolic pres-\nsure divided by the brachial systolic pressure. An ABI of 0.90\nin either leg was used to define PAD (28).\nDuring the health examination, blood samples were obtained\nby venipuncture and immediately centrifuged, aliquoted, and\nfrozen to 20 \u00b0C. The frozen serum and plasma samples were\nthen shipped on dry ice to central laboratories and stored at\n70 \u00b0C until they were analyzed. Serum 25(OH)D [both\n] concentrations were measured by us-\ning a radioimmunoassay (Diasorin Inc, Stillwater, MN). Total\n(intraassay and interassay) CVs ranged from 6.3% to 13.2%, the\nlimit of detection was 7.5 nmol/L, and the reference range was\n25\u00ad137 nmol/L. Values are converted to ng/mL by division by\n2.496. Because the vitamin D distribution differed considerably\nbetween white and black adults, race-specific cutoffs were used\nto categorize 25(OH)D into quartiles.\nOther variables\nInformation on smoking, alcohol use, physical activity,\nvitamin-mineral supplementation, mobility limitation, educa-\ntion,andhouseholdincomewasobtainedbyself-report.Statusas\na current, former, or never smoker was based on the use of\ncigarettes, cigars, or pipe tobacco. Subjects who had smoked\nlifetime but no longer smoked were considered former smokers.\nFrequency of alcoholic beverage (ie, beer, wine, or spirits) con-\nsumption over the past year was assessed. Subjects were asked\nabout the frequency and duration of walking or bicycling for\ntransportation, home or yard work, and moderate- to vigorous-\nintensity leisure-time physical activity performed for 10 min at\na time during the previous month. Responses to those questions\nwere incorporated into a single summary variable expressed as\nmetabolic equivalents (measured as MET-min/wk) by using in-\ntensity values recommended by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (29). Data on the use of individual and multivitamin\nsupplements over the previous month were used to assess intakes\nof supplemental vitamin D. The presence of mobility limitation\nwas defined as any difficulty in walking without special equip-\nment or at least some difficulty in walking 2\u00ad3 blocks.\nUsing a mercury sphygmomanometer, a certified technician\nmeasured blood pressure a maximum of 4 times in seated sub-\njects after a 5-min rest. Hypertension was defined by any of 4\ncriteria: an average systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg, an\naverage diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg, physician di-\nagnosis, or medication use. Body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg and\nstanding height to the nearest 0.1 cm were measured by using an\nelectronic scale (Mettler-Toledo Inc, Columbus, OH) and a sta-\ndiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Body mass index (BMI; in\nkg/m2) was calculated.\nSerum cholesterol was measured enzymatically (Hitachi 704\nAnalyzer; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Hypercholes-\nterolemia was defined as a total cholesterol concentrations of\n6.2mmol/L(240mg/dL)ormedicationuse.High-sensitivity\nC-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with a Behring Nephe-\nlometer II Analyzer (Dade Behring Diagnostics Inc, Somerville,\nNJ). Serum creatinine was measured with the use of the Jaff\u00e9 rate\nreaction (Beckman Astra, Brea, CA). Glomerular filtration rate,\na measure of kidney filtration function, was estimated with an\nabbreviatedversionoftheequationfromtheModificationofDiet\nin Renal Disease Study (30), calculated as 175  (serum creat-\n1.212 (if African American). Plasma glucose was measured by\nusing standard hexokinase enzymatic assays. Diabetes was de-\nfined by history, use of diabetes medications, fasting glucose \nmmol/L (200 mg/dL). A history of CVD was defined as a\nphysician diagnosis of myocardial infarction, congestive heart\nfailure, or stroke.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were weighted to the US population to provide\nnationally representative estimates. SAS-callable SUDAAN\nstatistical software (version 9.0; Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) was used to account for the\ncomplex survey design, a stratified multistage cluster sample.\nBecause the concentration of 25(OH)D and the prevalence of\nPAD differed significantly between the races, we examined\npredictors of 25(OH)D and risk factors for PAD separately by\nrace. Differences in sample characteristics according to race\nand presence of PAD were determined with independent sam-\nple t tests for continuous measures and with chi-square tests\nfor categorical measures. Race-specific odds ratios (ORs)\n(and 95% CIs) for PAD according to 25(OH)D concentration\nwere estimated by using multivariate logistic regression mod-\nels. Tests for a linear trend were performed by entering the\ncontinuous 25(OH)D variable into the multivariate model as\nan ordinal term.\nTo visually explore the dose-response association between\n25(OH)D and PAD in white and black adults, we used flexible\ntiles of the race-specific 25(OH)D distribution (31). The mid-\npoint of the lowest race-specific 25(OH)D quartile served as the\nreferent value. To test for a nonlinear association between vita-\nmin D and PAD, we entered quadratic and linear terms or both\nquadratic and cubic terms along with a linear term in the multi-\nvariate models. The extent to which groups of covariates ap-\npeared to explain the excess odds of PAD in black adults was\ndetermined by calculating the percentage reduction (PR) in the\nOR associated with adjustment according to the formula PR \n(oa\n ob\n)/(oa\n 1), where oa\nis the OR for PAD in blacks versus\nwhites in the base model adjusted for age and sex; ob\nis the OR\nafter additional adjustment for covariates; and oa\n\u00ad 1 is the excess\nodds of PAD in blacks than in whites. Statistical significance was\ndefined as P  0.05 by using 2-sided tests.\nRESULTS\nMean (SEM) 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly\nwhite adults, whereas the prevalence of PAD was significantly\nhigherinblackthaninwhiteadults(8.5%and5.3%,respectively;\nP  0.05). Additional characteristics of the cohort stratified by\nrace and presence of PAD are shown in Table 1. Black adults had\na lower household income and education; were less physically\nactive and less likely to use vitamin D supplements; and had a\nlower ABI than did white adults. In addition, black adults had a\nhigher BMI and were more likely to smoke and to have mobility\nlimitation, higher CRP concentrations, and diabetes and hyper-\ntension than were white adults. In contrast, white adults were\nslightly older, had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate,\nand were more likely to have hypercholesterolemia than were\nblack adults.\nWhite and black adults with PAD were generally older, had\nlower income and education, drank alcohol less frequently, had\nSample characteristics according to race and presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) among persons 40 y old in the United States: NHANES 2001\u00ad\nWhite subjects Black subjects\n1 NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D; GFR, glomerular filtration rate.\n2 Significantly different from white subjects, P  0.05 (independent-sample t tests for continuous measures and chi-square tests for categorical measures).\n  SEM (all such values).\n4 Significantly different from those within the same racial group who have PAD, P  0.05 (independent-sample t tests for continuous measures and\nchi-square tests for categorical measures).\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nlower kidney filtration function, and were more likely to have\ndiabetes and CVD than were adults without PAD (Table 1). In\naddition, white adults with PAD had lower 25(OH)D and higher\nCRP concentrations, were less physically active, and were more\nlikely to have hypertension and hypercholesterolemia than were\nwhite adults without PAD.\nThe association between 25(OH)D and selected demo-\ngraphic, anthropometric, and clinical characteristics of the\ncohort stratified by race is shown in Table 2. In both white and\nblack adults, 25(OH)D was higher in men than women; was\ninversely associated with BMI, CRP concentrations, and es-\ntimated glomerular filtration rate; and was positively associ-\nated with physical activity. In white adults, ABI increased,\nwhereas age and the presence of mobility limitation decreased\nwith increasing 25(OH)D. In black adults, 25(OH)D increased\nwith age. Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated\nwith a history of CVD and the presence of diabetes and hy-\npertension in white adults only.\nIn white adults, a strong inverse dose-response age- and\nsex-adjusted association was observed between 25(OH)D and\nthe prevalence of PAD (Table 3). The strength of this asso-\nciation was only modestly attenuated after adjustment for\nsocioeconomic status; anthropometric and lifestyle factors; a\nhistory of CVD; the presence of mobility limitation, diabetes,\nhypertension, or hypercholesterolemia; kidney function; and\nthe CRP concentration.

However, results of the 4-knot\ncubic spline among black adults provided evidence of a non-\nlinear association (Figure 2).

After addi-\ntional adjustment for racial differences in 25(OH)D, the odds of\nPAD in black adults were further reduced by nearly 31%.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this nationally representative, population-based, cross-\nsectional sample of US adults, we observed a strong inverse\ndose-response association of vitamin D status with PAD in\nwhite adults that was independent of several potential con-\nfounding factors and PAD risk factors. In black adults, the\nassociation was nonlinear; models with cubic splines sug-\ngested evidence of higher odds of PAD and a trend for lower\nodds of PAD at the lowest and highest concentrations of\n25(OH)D, respectively. Differences in the dose-response as-\nsociation between black and white adults may be attributed to\na woefully inadequate vitamin D status of black adults, altered\nsensitivity to the effects of vitamin D, or differences in the\nconcentrations of related hormones. We further showed that\nracial differences in vitamin D concentrations may explain\nnearly one-third of the excess risk of PAD in black adults,\nabove and beyond differences in established and novel CVD\nrisk factors. In general, these findings are consistent with\nrecent studies suggesting that racial differences in vitamin D\nalso may contribute to the greater frequency of hypertension\nand cancer observed among black adults (32, 33).\nA higher prevalence of PAD in black adults has been con-\nfirmed by numerous studies (4\u00ad6). This excess risk does not\nappear to be fully explained by differences in traditional or novel\nCVD risk factors (4\u00ad6). Allison et al (5) showed that significantly\n(47%) higher odds of PAD in black adults remained after adjust-\nment for racial differences in socioeconomic status and for life-\nstyle, traditional, and novel risk factors. In the current study, the\nodds of PAD were 2.11 times as high in black adults. After\nadjustment for racial differences in socioeconomic status and in\nlifestyle, traditional, and novel risk factors, a significant 67%\nincrease in the odds of PAD remained. After additional adjust-\nment for racial differences in serum vitamin D, the excess odds\nwerereducedto33%,andthedifferencebetweenblackandwhite\nsubjects was no longer statistically significant. These findings\nsuggest that the high frequency of vitamin D deficiency observed\nin black adults may be an important contributor to their higher\nrisk of PAD.\nVitamin D is widely recognized for its role in regulating\ncalcium homeostasis, bone formation, and bone resorption.\nHowever, an accumulating body of evidence suggests that\nvitamin D deficiency may also play a role in the pathogenesis\nRace-specific adjusted odds ratios for peripheral arterial disease according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D concentrations by quartile (Q)\n1 NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n2 Tests for a linear trend were performed by entering the continuous 25(OH)D variable into the multivariable model as an ordinal term.

Furthermore,\nsmall clinical trials have shown that vitamin D supplementa-\ntion or UVB irradiation may lower systolic blood pressure\n(36), improve blood pressure control (37), and regress myo-\ncardial hypertrophy (38). Nonetheless, recent data from the\nWomen's Health Initiative showed that calcium and vitamin\nD supplementation did not reduce CVD risk in postmeno-\npausal women (39). There are several possible explanations\nfor this apparent discrepancy, including the design of the\nWomen's Health Initiative as a fracture prevention trial, an\ninsufficient dose of vitamin D, and the inability to examine\nFIGURE 1.

Furthermore, numer-\nous studies have shown, paradoxically, that black adults have\ngreater bone mass and a lower risk for fracture than do white\nadults, despite lower vitamin D status and a resultant higher\nparathyroid hormone concentration (42\u00ad45). Black adults may\nhave adapted to the secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by\nchronic vitamin D deficiency and to the observed intestinal re-\nsistance to the actions of vitamin D by developing skeletal resis-\ntance to the bone-resorbing effects of parathyroid hormone (46,\n47). Thus, we speculate that racial differences in the shape of the\nassociation between vitamin D and PAD may be due at least\npartly to an altered sensitivity to the effects of vitamin D, related\nhormones, or both. Further research is necessary to confirm this\nhypothesis.\nDespite the potential for an altered sensitivity to vitamin D,\nblack persons or other persons with dark skin can attain high\n25(OH)D concentrations, given sufficient UVB exposure or sup-\nplementation (48, 49). Attaining a definition of the optimal in-\ntake of vitamin D or 25(OH)D to promote health is an area of\ncurrent controversy. Existing recommendations suggest a daily\ny old, and 600 IU for those 70 y old. However, many experts\nhavearguedthatthecurrentrecommendedallowanceiswoefully\ninadequate because it was based largely on the prevention of\nosteomalacia or rickets (50). Some experts say an optimal intake\nconcentration that may be associated with maximal suppression\nof parathyroid hormone and a lower risk of fracture (50).\nSeveral mechanisms may explain the association of vitamin D\ndeficiency with PAD. Low vitamin D status has been shown to\nhave an association with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, all\nof which increase the risk of PAD (51). However, in the present\nstudy, the relation between 25(OH)D and PAD remained after\nadjustment for these risk factors, which suggests that there are\nadditional explanatory mechanisms. Vitamin D receptors have a\nbroad tissue distribution that includes vascular smooth muscle\ncells (52), macrophages (53), and lymphocytes (54). Further-\nmore, vitamin D regulates the expression of a number of proteins\nrelevant to the arterial wall, including vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor, matrix metalloproteinase type 9, myosin, elastin,\nand type I collagen (34). In addition, vitamin D has been shown\nto regulate the renin-angiotensin system by suppressing renin\ngene expression (55, 56) and to inhibit cytokine release from\nlymphocytes (54). Similarly, a transgenic rat model that consti-\ntutivelyexpressesvitaminD-24-hydroxylase--anenzymethatis\nresponsible for breaking down an activated form of vitamin D,\ntherebycausingdeficiency--developsaorticatherosclerosisand\nhyperlipidemia (57). In an animal model of chronic kidney dis-\nease, the administration of clinically relevant doses of vitamin D\nreduced aortic calcification, whereas higher doses increased ath-\nerosclerosis (58). In another study, rats fed a diet rich in choles-\nterol and extremely high in vitamin D (1.8 million units/kg) also\ndeveloped greater aortic calcification (59). Thus, evidence from\nanimal models and from clinical studies suggests that the optimal\nvitamin D concentration for cardiovascular health may be one\nthat is neither excessively high nor insufficient.\nThe present study had a number of strengths, including a\nnationally representative population-based sample, standardized\ndata collection protocols, and rigorous quality-control proce-\ndures. In addition, the use of ABI allowed the identification of\nsubclinical PAD. However, this study is limited by the cross-\nsectional nature of these data, which impedes the drawing of a\ncausal inference. It has been suggested that low 25(OH)D in\npersons with PAD may be the result of reduced ambulatory\nactivity and less access to sunlight. Despite this hypothesis, we\nfound that the association between vitamin D and PAD was\nindependent of physical activity and the presence of mobility\nlimitation. Furthermore, none of the participants were institu-\ntionalized, and all were mobile enough to attend the physical\nexamination. As in most racial-ethnic comparison studies, edu-\ncation and income are merely proxy indicators for socioeco-\nnomic status and are thus subject to residual confounding (60).\nAdditional limitations include the lack of information regarding\nthe geographic area of residence, the season during which blood\nsamples were obtained, and the measurement of parathyroid\nhormone concentrations. However, even if the results of the\ncurrent study are mediated by secondary hyperparathyroidism,\nthe appropriate treatment would focus on the repletion of vitamin\nD, which justifies our focus on vitamin D concentrations.\nIn conclusion, we found that racial differences in vitamin D\nstatus may explain nearly one-third of the excess risk of PAD in\nblack compared with white adults. Because vitamin D concen-\ntrations can easily be modified via supplementation or safe, mod-\nerate sun exposure, additional research to determine whether low\nvitamin D concentrations contribute to the greater risk of PAD in\nblack adults appears warranted.\nWe thank Barry Graubard at the National Cancer Institute for statistical\nadvice.\nAdjusted odds ratios for peripheral arterial disease in black compared with\nModel2 Odds ratio (95% CI) Excess odds explained3\n%\n1 NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n2 Model 1 adjusts for age and sex; model 2 adjusts for the covariates in\nmodel 1 plus income, education, BMI, smoking, physical activity, alcohol\nuse, and mobility limitation; model 3 adjusts for the covariates in model 2\nplus diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, estimated glomerular fil-\ntrationrate,C-reactiveprotein,andahistoryofcardiovasculardisease;model\n4 adjusts for the covariates in model 3 plus serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\nconcentrations.\n3 Excess odds explained  (oa\n\u00ad ob\n)/(oa\n\u00ad 1), where oa\nis the odds ratio\nforperipheralarterialdiseaseinblackscomparedwithwhitesadjustedforage\nand sex; ob\nis the odds ratio after adjustment for age, sex, and a group of\ncovariates; and oa\n\u00ad 1 is the excess odds for peripheral arterial disease in\nblacks compared with whites.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--JPR and EDM: developed\nthe concept for the study; JPR: collected the data, analyzed the data, per-\nformed the statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript; and EDM, DvM,\nand ERM: performed critical revision of the manuscript for important intel-\nlectual content.
