    "abstract": "Abstract\nSri Aurobindo's multifaceted engagements will continue to occupy scholars in different fields. As one who belongs to a\ncountry that has begotten eminent theoreticians in the fields of literature, arts, linguistics, and aesthetics, Sri Aurobindo's\ncontribution deserves a dispassionate assessment.Volume 27 of the Complete Works contains his \"Letters on Poetry and\nArt\" which can be examined for the potential for a theory of poetry.As letters, they are informal responses. However, they\nare also responses to specific and thoughtfully worded questions from individuals who have engaged SriAurobindo in serious\ndiscussions on the issues concerning poetry and the arts.An Indian academic is forged in a system of education that is more\nWestern, in character, than Indian. Hence, the present concern to explore the potential for a theory of poetry among Indian\nscholars and theoreticians.There is the large corpus of Indian aesthetic ideas and theories that have been ignored or relegated\nto a position behind the Western ideas and theories. So much so, the average scholar shows a greater familiarity with Plato,\nAristotle, Coleridge, Arnold and is wanting in the knowledge of Anandavardana, Bharatrihari, or, even, Sri Aurobindo. The\npresent article examines the Letters inVolume 27 for the purpose of cataloguing the major concerns, themes, philosophical\ncategories that inform the discussions, and theoretical issues that such a project would generate.\n",
    "reduced_content": "http://sgo.sagepub.com\nIt is a matter of amusement that a person like Sri Aurobindo\nwho has substantially contributed to the understanding, con-\nsolidation, propagation, and furthering of Indian thought\nshould still be a marginal figure in academia. Sri Aurobin-\ndo's contribution to the many aspects of Indian Culture makes\nhim a cultural institution whose value must be cherished and\nmerits critical revaluations from time to time. This study is a\nresponse to that perceived need. What really amuses one is\nthe fact that a person whose opinions on art, aesthetics,\npoetry, and literature were frequently sought by disciples,\nhave to wait like the metaphysical poets. Perhaps, the Indian\nacademy's self-consciousness is to blame for this calculated\namnesia: perhaps, the academy did not want to be stigma-\ntized as \"metaphysical\" or \"other worldly\"; a colonial taint\nwhich it has been fiercely struggling to avoid. Perhaps, the\nacademy itself was reeling under a self-actualization com-\nplex for which approval of the Western scholastic establish-\nment was absolutely necessary.\nIt is ironical that for one who was as well known, if not,\nbetter known than the Indian novelists in English at the\ntime, the triune of the Indian English novel--Anand, Rao,\nand Narayan--had to wait till the 1990s for official\nrecognition when V. S. Sethuraman edited Indian Aesthetics:\nAn Introduction (1992) which contains the essay, \"The Soul\nof Poetic Delight and Beauty.\" The irony of the situation is\nthe fact that Sri Aurobindo was, even more vigorously than\nRaja Rao of Kanthapura and Serpent and the Rope, R. K.\nNarayan of The English Teacher and The Guide, talking\nabout an ethos where more journeys are made inward, into\nthe spirit than outward toward a noisy reality that hems us in\non all sides. Perhaps, the time has come, though the oppor-\ntunity was always there, to attempt inquiries into vital areas\nof cultural import and identify concerns that can occupy us\nwhich is more redeeming than the overanxious urge to ratio-\nnalize our credentials as an ecumenical culture by dedicat-\ning academic careers to an understanding of Western\nscholarly dispositions and accents.\n1National Institute of Technology,Tiruchirappalli,Tamilnadu, India\nCorresponding Author:\nVinod Valiathakidi Balakrishnan, Associate Professor, Department of\nHumanities, National Institute of Technology,Tiruchirappalli, 620 015,\nTamilnadu, India\nEmail: winokrish@yahoo.co.uk\nBetween Mental Manufacture and\nPureTranscript: TheViability of\naTheory of Poetry in the Letters\nof Sri Aurobindo\nVinodValiathakidi Balakrishnan1\n Keywords\nSri Aurobindo, letters, theory, pure transcript, writing, waiting\n2 SAGE Open\nThe present project examines the viability of a theory of\npoetry from the perusal of the Letters on Poetry and Art\nwhich forms Volume 27 of the Complete Works. This vol-\nume incorporates material from three earlier collections\ntitled Letters on Poetry: Literature and Art, Letters on\n\"Savitri,\" and On Himself. In all, there are more than 500\nletters, in which Sri Aurobindo has, now laconically, now\nelaborately, dwelt on subjects relating to the arts, especially,\npoetry. They range from poetic creation to sources of inspira-\ntion to technique to artistry, rhythm, style, diction to form as\nwell as disciplinary concerns like Sadhana, reading, writing,\nlanguage, and yoga. There are also attempts at synthesis like\nreading and Sadhana, writing and Sadhana, poetry and\nSadhana, and language study and yoga.\nThe Letters may be reckoned as a valuable source for con-\nstructing a theory of poetry which will be, if not unique, at\nleast a definite departure from the Western theoretical posi-\ntions. Of course, the ideas about the aspects of poetry are not\nas sustained, developed, and complete as they obtain in The\nFuture Poetry. Whereas the latter is more reflective and car-\nries the shape of personal introspection, the former is more\nresponsive to the concerns of fellow travelers in the Word\nand in the World. So, there is an engagement, a dialogue, an\ninteraction between the well-considered question and the\nappropriate response. There is also the possibility of keener\napplication to problems because at the time of replying to\neach of his interlocutors, Sri Aurobindo was responding to a\ngiven problem where all the other issues would be kept in\nabeyance. Perhaps, even he was unaware of the multitude of\nissues identified and attended while the beautiful conversa-\ntion on poetry, with multiple interlocutors, was unfolding.\nIn this respect, the Letters may be seen to resemble Plato's\nRepublic or Sir Philip Sidney's An Apology for Poetry. Both\nthese seminal texts are responses to questions; the question\nwith the irresistible invitation to Socrates to dwell on the\npower of poetry and the \"other\" question which is an indict-\nment of Poetry as a worthy occupation. Plato's concern is\nmore about the health of the city-state whereas Sidney's must\nbe reckoned as the health of the individual. Plato's indictment\nof the poet and Sidney's defense of the poet imply concerns\nwhich can be metaphorized as the State of Athens as an\nIndividual (in an anthropomorphic sense) and the state of the\nindividual (in the context of Renaissance humanism), respec-\ntively. What we see is the juxtaposition of entities that are\nfounded on the principle of integrity if they have to exist at all;\nthe contrary is suggestive of disruption, disintegration, and the\nYeats-ian image of \"things fall[ing] apart.\" Poetry is the form\nof the symbolic integration of the state and the individual. The\nfact that Volume 27 begins with the origin of poetry and moves\ntoward Sadhana and yoga suggests the crucial integration of\nelements that are not, apparently, compatible.\nThe two key orientations of this study would be the refer-\nence to an Indian ethos as well as the integration that poetry\nsymbolizes. Both these orientations are informed by the\nreading of the Letters. They help us understand better the kind\nof poetry that Sri Aurobindo had conviction about, the poet\nwho would accomplish the rite of bringing the poem into\nbeing, and the significance of yoga and Sadhana in this pro-\ncess. What the orientations would further enable is an under-\nstanding of a scale of possibilities in language where at one\nend is the predominance of the outer mind/consciousness that\nresults in a \"mental manufacture\" and at the other end is the\nOvermind where pure inspiration performs a lila that culmi-\nnates in a \"Pure Transcript.\" Between these two points is an\nexpansive space with infinite levels of consciousness and\nperformance corresponding to the infinite possibility for\nperfection that is present in man.\nThe ground that needs to be immediately cleared is that of\ntheory itself. We would be on firmer ground if we can decide\nwhether it is consistent with what a Jonathan Culler would\nmean by \"Theory.\" Culler (2000) would first admit that\ntheory is \"a body of thinking and writing whose limits are\nexceedingly hard to imagine\" (p. 3). He illustrates the moves\nof theory by showing how a Foucault or a Derrida theoreti-\ncally explain and expose the actual complicity between sex\nand power (though it appears that power is resisted by sex)\nand how writing (much against the claim of Rousseau) is, by\nRousseau's own confession, not a supplement to speaking\nbut its superior other. Culler's position on theory, though\nerudite and persuasive, appears to promise much on the side\nof theory's possibility while, in an even measure, limits the\ntheoretical moves to an investigative and diagnostic approach\nthat serves to uncover, recover, revise, and rewrite an exist-\ning situation where the gap between the apparent and the\nactual needs to be filled with informed skepticism.\nOne is not sure whether such a notion about theory would\nhelp in constructing a theory of poetry using the Letters of Sri\nAurobindo. The reason for investing in an alternative position\nis the fact that the Letters are not mere language constructs\nthat may satisfy a Derridean skepticism for the contradictions\ningrained in language. Nor are they manifestations of an intri-\ncate and invisible web of forces that compel resistance from\nabove when they have actually orchestrated a complicity (that\nresembles resistance). There is a definite transcendental realm\nin the scheme of Sri Aurobindo, which the spirit of the Letters\nembodies that renders a Derridean skepticism a move predis-\nposed to challenge and subvert. There is also an engagement\nwith the self in more self-evaluating terms that is not satisfac-\ntorily answered by theories that believe in systems that control\nand coerce individuals. So, a theory about poetry based on the\nLetters of Sri Aurobindo locates the individual in a more sub-\nstantial manner than that of the Derridean skeptic with respect\nto what he or she can do as well as providing a more expansive\nlocation for the individual where he or she is not coerced by\nlarger forces, symbolized by the state, that remind him or her\non what they cannot do.\nThe purposes of a theory would require a revaluation of\naccepted alignments. The Western poetic theories are, with\nrespect to the Indian academy, aligned from Plato through\nAristotle to Horace to Longinus to Sidney to Dryden, to\nWordsworth, to Coleridge, to Arnold, to Eliot to Yeats to\nSeamus Heaney. There are, of course, theAmerican poets like\nBalakrishnan 3\nEmerson, Whitman, Edgar Poe, and Robert Frost who have\ndiscoursed on poetry. There is a transcendental region in\nPlato's scheme which is brought down to earth through an\nAristotelian unseating of the Gods to privilege the conceit of\nthe poet. Since that crucial intervention which Philip Sidney\n(1988) records as \"Her world is brazen, the poets only deliv-\ners a golden\" (p. 8), the poet has been recognized as a Maker,\na Prophet. Even, when Wordsworth strikes the notes of rebel-\nlion by characterizing the poet as \"man speaking to man,\" the\nhagiography of the poet as \"the maker\" is unmistakable and\nthis strain is sustained through to Seamus Heaney (1980),\nwho narrates the midwifery of the poet in the making of\nOmphalos, which is the Greek word meaning the navel, and\nhence the stone that marked the center of the world, and repeat\nit, omphalos, omphalos, omphalos, until its blunt and falling\nmusic becomes the music of somebody pumping water at\nthe pump outside our backdoor. (p. 17)\nThen, there are the classic deceptions committed by poets\nwho have chosen to unwrap for the aspiring poet the secrets\nfrom the omphalos of Helicon: The first, is Poe's (1987)\nabstract title \"The Philosophy of Composition\" where he\ndeclares how a poem can be turned into a concrete reality\n\"with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical\nformula\" (p. 229) The second is a rather concrete title of Frost,\n\"The Figure a Poem Makes,\" for an abstract understanding of\npoetry that must begin in delight and end in wisdom. However,\nwhat we see in these happy deceptions is the fact of the poet as\nthe craftsman who can give flesh to the word.\nThe Western alignment looks at the poet as the one who\nmakes, as the one who writes. Other than Coleridge who is\nbelieved to have terminated the process of poetic transcrip-\ntion following the interruption from the man from Porlock,\nmost poets have persisted with the urge, like Wordsworth\n(1962) who even after wondering \"Wither is fled the visionary\ngleam?/Where is it now, the glory and the dream?\" (p. 178)\nhave proceeded to complete the poem. Wordsworth is struck\nby the sense of despair in 1802 but perseveres to complete\nthe \"Immortality Ode\" in 1807. This anecdote does affirm\nthe determination of the poet to finish the job of crafting a\nverbal icon. It also underlines the suggestion that the poet is\nnot always as sensitive to the inner call like Coleridge at the\ntime of composing \"Kubla Khan.\" The Western alignment is\nmore consistent with the image of a Wordsworth determined\nto manufacture the poem as an artifact than with a Coleridge\nwho symbolizes the readiness to give up once the impulse\ndries up. The difference between Coleridge and Wordsworth\nis the difference between a transcription and a manufacture.\nThe construction of an Aurobindo-nian theory of poetry\nwill be possible only after the ideological framework is set up.\nNow, the ideological framework of Sri Aurobindo can only be\nconfigured in terms of large fields in the present context. The\nscope of the present article does not allow for a detailed delin-\neation of each of the fields that SriAurobindo was involved in\nand committed to as the very purpose of his life. However, for\nenabling the logic of the theory emerging out of the ideologi-\ncal framework, one may point to Sri Aurobindo's complete\nabsorption of Western education, which also marks the begin-\nning of his quest for the vital truth about man.\nHis journeys into the mind, where he confronts the issues\nabout the mind's constructions like the potency of medita-\ntion, the realization about the ascent of consciousness, the\nshape of the universal mind, the limits of psychoanalysis,\nand the passage toward supramental vision and supramental\npower, are journeys toward the \"interior landscape\" (a phrase\nused by A. K. Ramanujan) that also map the emergence of a\ndistinct terrain of knowledge which can lend greater cre-\ndence to the intellectual engagements in the humanities.\nHow else can one understand the triadic approach by Sri\nAurobindo to link the individual with the field of conscious-\nness and the poetic traditions?\nFor instance, Sri Aurobindo constructs a triad starting with\nthe romantic poetic tradition which, according to him, is an\n\"instinctive\" field of consciousness that occupies the individual\nat the level of the body. This triadic relationship is suggested by\nWordsworth in \"TinternAbbey\" as \"sensations sweet/Felt in the\nblood.\" A more evolved triad is the classical tradition that cor-\nresponds to the \"intelligent\" field of consciousness and it occu-\npies the individual at the level of the \"mind.\" Wordsworth's\nsecond category would be \"sensations sweet/ . . . Felt along the\nheart.\" Sri Aurobindo's third and highest triadic relationship\nwould be the \"real\" tradition that emerges out of the \"intuitive\"\nfield of consciousness and which corresponds to the \"yogic\"\nstage of evolution of the individual/poet. This is suggested by\nthe highest, ineffable stage that Wordsworth reached in these\nwords: \"Sensations sweet/ . . . And passing even into my purer\nbeing/With tranquil restoration.\"\nIt would suffice to register here, for any future elabora-\ntion, that Sri Aurobindo's Letters carry the potential for the\ntheory of poetry that stands on three guiding principles: First,\nthe theory of poetry outlined by Sri Aurobindo; second, the\nevaluation of English poetry (by which Sri Aurobindo means\npoetry by the English poets); and finally, the future of poetry\nwhich he calls the \"Future Poetry.\"\nThe first stage of the ideological framework would involve\nthe delineation of the idea of \"soul-poetry\" manifested as the\n\"mantra.\" This is directly related to Sri Aurobindo's ideas on\nthe \"essence\" of poetry that springs forth from \"rhythm\" and\n\"movement\" of speech that evolve beyond the merely pleasur-\nable to the truly incantatory. The poetic theory would then\nadmit only such \"style\" and \"substance\" as would contribute\nto the \"poetic vision\" evoked by the mantra.\nAfter positing the ideological framework, Sri Aurobindo\ncomments on the \"national evolution\" of poetry based on\nwhich he evaluates the \"character\" of English poetry and the\ncourse it describes from the time of Chaucer through modern\nliterature through the Victorian poets to the \"new birth\" of\nDecadence. In this regard, Sri Aurobindo characterizes the\npoets, Keats and Shelley, Byron and Wordsworth, and, finally,\nBlake and Coleridge as the \"poets of the Dawn\"; each pair\nsuggesting a particular stage of evolution from the body rep-\nresented by Keats and Shelley to the mind represented by\nByron and Wordsworth to the highest stage in English poetry\n4 SAGE Open\nwhich only Blake and Coleridge could come close to achiev-\ning. Sri Aurobindo feels that the last pair was wanting in \"the\ngravity and enduring substance.\"\nWhat Sri Aurobindo implies through the apparent vague-\nness in the phrase, \"the gravity and enduring substance\" can\nbe understood when one explores his ideas about \"Future\nPoetry\" about which he has spoken and written extensively.\nThe idea of the Future Poetry can be configured through an\nexploration of the \"ideal spirit\" of poetry; the idea of \"poetic\ntruth\"; the \"breath\" that brings into consciousness, the greater\nlife; the \"soul of poetic delight and beauty\"; the \"power\" of the\nspirit that infuses the poetry of \"mantra\"; its \"form\" and the\nprecise relationship between the \"word and the spirit.\"\nThe Letters, thus, become a viable site for the construction\nof a theory of poetry, provided one decides on a three-stage\napproach beginning with the ideological framework, the appli-\ncation of the ideas on poetic performance, and, finally, relocat-\ning the interaction with the framework of Sri Aurobindo's\nideas about the poetry of the future where he determines the\nrole of the poet as the conductor or the medium for the meet-\ning of the individual mind with the universal mind that brings\nabout the evolution of consciousness.\nWhat this author posits is that a theory of poetry based on\nthe Letters must shift from a Western alignment where the poet\nis the person who writes toward a different understanding of\nthe poet provided by Sri Aurobindo. An excerpt from the letter\ndated June 2, 1931, on \"Poetic Creation\" reads as follows:\nWhen the source of inspiration is in the heart or the\npsychic there is more easily a goodwill in the vital chan-\nnel, the flow is spontaneous; the inspiration takes at\nonce its true form and speech and is transmitted without\nany interference or only a minimum of interference by\nthe brain-mind, that great spoiler of the higher or deeper\nsplendours . . . The poet labours in anguish to get the\none true word, the authentic rhythm, the real divine\nsubstance of what he has to say, while all the time it is\nwaiting complete and ready behind; but it is denied free\ntransmission by some part of the transmitting agency\nwhich prefers to translate and is not willing merely to\nreceive and transcribe. (Sri Aurobindo, 2004, p. 6)\nThe excerpt talks about poetic creation and the role of the\npoet. It does talk about the poet as a writer but only when he\nis unable to allow the self to respond to the inspired call from\nthe subtle plane. The poet as a writer is one who fails to\nkeep the outer mind in check and presides over the spoiling\nof the inspiration as it flows through the creative vital. By\nimplication, then, the poet in the scheme of Sri Aurobindo\n(2004) would be a medium who allows the process of cre-\nation to happen where his intellect, intuition, and illumined\nmind do have a role to play; only, that the proportion to\nwhich the elements of integration are controlled by the poet\nwould determine whether the poem is going to be a \"pure\ntranscript\" or a \"mental manufacture\" (p. 5). The shift in the\ntheoretical alignment toward Sri Aurobindo's understanding\nof poetry and the role of the poet would mean a radical shift\nin the understanding of the poet as a writer to the poet as the\nenabling creative spirit that waits for the manifestation of\nbeauty: from the poet who writes to the poet who waits.\nDid Matthew Arnold mean the same when he talked about\nthe Scholar Gypsy waiting for the spark from heaven to fall?\nOr, did T. S. Eliot mean the same when he talked about the\n\"awful daring of a moment's surrender\"? Where they also\naligning themselves to an Eastern thinking where the body is a\nmedium through which the spirit expresses the splendor of\ntruth? These are questions that will become interesting when\none is persuaded that the more popular notion of the poet as the\n\"master craftsman\" as Eliot chose to call Ezra Pound changes\ntoward a notion of the poet as the integrated self that waits.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nPrimary Source\nSri Aurobindo.
