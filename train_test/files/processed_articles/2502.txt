Whereas advocates of high incarceration rates cite rational choice\ntheory to predict that consistent punishment will reduce crime rates, some observers of\ndisadvantaged communities see the criminal justice measures taken to deter crime as\nexacerbating poverty traps that are conducive to high crime rates [6]. Crowding overextends\nprison supervision, allowing violence against inmates to go unchecked. It also dilutes access\nto drug treatment resources. Trauma and deficient mental health services are both risk fac-\ntors for substance use disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Prisons also promote the\nacquisition and spread of infectious diseases through crowding, and this is especially true\nfor drug-related HIV and hepatitis C infections and crowding-related tuberculosis infec-\ntions [6, 7]. In California, the contribution of severe crowding to violence and grossly sub-\nstandard inmate healthcare warranted legal intervention by the federal government; the U.S.\nSupreme Court mandated that the state reduce its incarceration rates to redress crowding\nproblems [8].\nThis study examines prison crowding as a risk factor for recidivism. Crowding is defined as\noccupancy rate, which can be found by dividing the designed maximum capacity into the num-\nber of prisoners housed in an institution, and multiplying this by 100. Records from the Cali-\nfornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), from 1991 through 2010, show\nthe mean rate occupancy across all state institutions was 186.96% [9]. Some prisoners have\nspent the entirety of their sentences in converted reception centers operating at an occupancy\nrate of over 300% [10]. Furthermore, in the last 30 years California's general prison population\nCrowding-related stress is associated with both aggression and impaired executive function\nin both children and adults [12, 13, 14]. Short-term crowding has been shown to lead to more\ncompetitive behavior in children and adolescents, particularly for males, in a study examining\ncooperative and competitive play after exposure to crowding [15]. In adults, residential crowd-\ning stress has been linked to negative affect, social tension, learned helplessness and behaviors\nthat are more competitive, reactive, and involved with reestablishing control [16, 17, 18]. The\nenforced helplessness characteristic of prison life has been shown to exacerbate crowding-\nrelated behavior problems on several dimensions [16, 17, 18]. This study's hypothesis, that\nprison crowding predicts higher rates of recidivism, assumes that after an exposure to crowd-\ning-related stress, an adult's behavior and cognitive coping skills continue to be negatively\naffected by that experience, an assumption that has not yet been directly tested but which finds\nindirect support in some previous research [13, 15].\nThis study's outcome variable, recidivism, is associated with chronic socioeconomic and\npsychosocial disadvantage in communities affected by high rates of incarceration. California\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nhas some of the highest recidivism rates in the United States, and its unique parole system is a\nfactor [19]. Almost all prisoners are released on parole, usually for three years, with varying lev-\nels of monitoring. Recidivism may take any of three forms: (i) parole violations, (ii) new arrests,\nor (iii) parole revocation (termination of parole). Both parole violations and new arrests are\nmultifactorial and are related to behavioral, socioeconomic, community, and policy-driven\nconditions [20]. However, parole revocations are decided by an administrative board and are\nthe ultimate determinant of whether a parolee returns to prison [19]. Despite this review,\ninmates released from California prisons from 2006 to 2007 had an average recidivism rate of\nover 65%. In addition, among offenders who had been released two or more times, the rate was\ntors returning to custody [22].\nThis study's hypothesis, that prison crowding is associated with higher rates of recidivism,\ncontradicts the conventional wisdom in the field of criminology. Criminology theories, such as\nrational choice theory, argue that individuals make law violation decisions based on their indi-\nvidual needs relative to the perceived risk of legal consequences [23]. A crude way of applying\nthis theory would hold that adverse prison conditions (such as crowding) should increase per-\nceived risk, therefore decreasing the likelihood of individual recidivism. However, a more fine-\ngrained application of rational choice theory would hold that adverse prison conditions are less\nsalient to parolees facing an opportunity to reoffend than other considerations, such as the per-\nceived risk of arrest and successful prosecution, and the length of sentences associated with the\nviolation in question.\nIn fact, several studies have actually found that harsher prison conditions were positively\nassociated with recidivism. One of these studies, a study of federal inmates, found that higher\nlevels of security housing (commensurate with increased restrictions) did not reduce recidivism\n[24]. In addition, a survival analysis of California prisoners randomized into different security\nlevel classifications found that the highest level had more than a 30% increased risk of return-\ning to prison compared with the lowest level [25]. Higher security levels often correspond to\nlonger sentences, an important confounder in this analysis. Such sentences lead to less success-\nful reintegration into society after release, and thus contribute to recidivism. However, these\nstudies still raise doubts as to whether harsh prison conditions are crime deterrents, and they\nsupport the possibility that crowding could be one factor behind California's high recidivism\nrates.\nIf crowding does increase a prisoner's risk of recidivism, this could be explained by the psy-\nchosocial stress associated with adverse prison conditions, which may exacerbate decision-\nmaking problems (e.g., impulsivity) and problem behaviors (e.g., drug use, aggression) in\nprison populations. Such a relationship would, necessarily, be mediated by factors overrepre-\nsented in prison populations that include mental illness, cognitive dysfunction and intellectual\ndisability, in addition to factors related to former prisoners' social environment. The high prev-\nalence of substance use disorder (SUD) in prison populations may also be a factor in the high\nrates of drug-related recidivism seen among California parolees [22].\nRelatively little research has been done to date on the relationship between prison crowding\nand recidivism. Insufficient statistical methods and the availability of only aggregate level data\nhindered early attempts to study the effect of crowding specifically on recidivism [26\u00ad27]. One\nrecent individual-level data study of twenty-five thousand Italian former prisoners found that\nprison crowding was directly associated with recidivism [28]. However, these researchers were\nunable to measure the effect size with great precision (the upper limit of the confidence interval\nfor their estimated effect size was 0.064, whereas the lower limit was negative and close to 0).\nAdditionally, they did not assess what types of violations were more susceptible to an effect on\nrecidivism.\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nIn one other study of California parolees, investigators found that the more overcrowded a\ncorrectional institution was, the less likely parole boards were to return a violator back to\nprison [29]. Their analysis, however, did not consider crowding as a risk factor for parolees to\nactually violate parole. It is also unknown how these parole board decisions may have ulti-\nmately altered recidivism rates for specific parole violation types.\nStudy purpose and rationale\nCrowding overextends prison resources, to the detriment of prisoner safety and public health\n[6]. Running prisons over capacity makes adequate inmate behavior monitoring nearly impos-\nsible, leading to increased violence and rape [30\u00ad38]. Additionally, overcrowded prisons can-\nnot offer adequate drug treatment or any other medical care [39\u00ad41]. Limited access to drug\ntreatment may contribute to higher rates of drug use-related recidivism among parolees with\nSUD. For example, CDCR inmates who did not take part in drug treatment during and after\nprison had double the recidivism rates of those who did [22]. This study investigates the poten-\ntial for a vicious cycle between high incarceration rates and high crime rates, mediated by\nprison crowding levels.\nStudy question\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate whether parolees exposed to higher levels of prison\ncrowding returned to prison at higher rates than others. Consequently, the research question\nwas as follows: Does prison crowding exposure predict higher rates of parole violations? The\nhypothesis of this study is that crowding is associated with higher rates of parole violations.\nPsychosocial stress is the hypothesized mediator of the effect of crowding on rates of parole\nviolations. However, this study's statistical inference is limited to the effect of study exposure\n(prison crowding) on the study outcome (rates of parole violations), with no data on subjects'\nstress hormone levels (e.g., cortisol) or other clinical measures of stress associated with crowd-\ning-related behavior problems. We can look at effect size differences for different types of\nparole violations (e.g., drug-related charges), but because of the high frequency of missing data\non use of drug treatment programs within the study population (26%), and because data on\nSUD diagnosis were only available at the aggregate level, we are unable to control for history of\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe study population comprised a random sample of 5% of California's parolees under\ntions over this two year observation period were calculated using recurrent events survival\nanalysis.\nData\nSources. Data were combined from two sources. The first, maintained by the National\nArchive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD), contains the individual level data for all variables\nexcept prison crowding level [42]. Survival observations were made weekly to record whether\nor not a subject violated parole and which type of violation, if any, occurred. Violation events\nwere counted whenever a parolee was observed to have violated a technical or Level I to Level\nIII violation, or absconded. Technical violations include missed appointments with officers,\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nvisiting outside the parole region, and other non-criminal offenses. California is one of a few\nstates that returns parolees to prison as a sanction for technical violations. Absconding viola-\ntions include both cases in which the parolee has left the state's jurisdiction without permission\nand those in which he or she has simply failed to report for parole supervision. Level I viola-\ntions are predominantly personal drug offenses, such as drug use, drug possession, failure to\nregister as a drug offender, being under the influence, being drunk in public, etc. Level II viola-\ntions include drug sales, property offenses, and other non-injury crimes. Level III violations\nconsist of serious and violent crimes. Non-violation events were counted whenever a parolee:\n(i.) had no violation during an observation, (ii.) was censored, or (iii.) had their parole period\nend without violation.\nThe second source of data comprises monthly adult prison population reports hosted on\nCDCR's official website. Population totals were aggregated at the institutional (prison) level.\nThis study utilized reports for the months of July, 1990, through December, 2002.\nAggregating crowding levels. Monthly CDCR population census reports were digitized,\ncompiled, and cleaned. Prisons were then grouped according to geographical region, corre-\nsponding with CDCR's four parole regions based on map plotting. Region I includes the north-\nern part of the state, not including the coast. Region II includes only the coastal regions of\nNorthern California. Region III includes only Los Angeles County. Region IV contains both\nthe coastal and inland areas of Southern California. Weighted averages of prison crowding lev-\nels were then calculated for each group of prisons in a parole region over the 150 study months,\nresulting in 600 weighted measurements of crowding. These continuous values were subse-\nquently grouped into three discrete levels: \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high.\" Cut-off levels were\nbased on maximum capacity recommendations from the United States Government Account-\nability Office and expert testimony [39, 43]. \"Low\" was defined as less than 190% capacity,\nor greater. It was impossible to create a group without any crowding since all Californian pri-\nsons were over capacity.\nAssigning aggregate crowding levels to individual subjects. The crowding exposure level\nfor each subject was determined by the parole region of the parolees' prison and the crowding\nlevel in that region during the month prior to the date of their release from prison. Occasion-\nally, some prisoners (particularly those with medical conditions) are transferred between insti-\ntutions. However, even for these prisoners, the last thirty days represents a significant portion\nof total time served (77% of parolees served <5 months during the study) [10]. Release date\nwas calculated by subtracting a given parolee's days of freedom from the study start date\n(rounded to the nearest month).\nData Analysis\nSoftware. All data assembly and analysis were performed using R, an open source, object-\noriented programming language and environment [44]. All time-related data were first made\ndate attributable using the package Lubridate, making time calculations feasible [45]. A hot-\ndecking method of data imputation utilizing random recursive partitioning (RRP) for match-\ning was implemented using the RRP library [46]. This is a Monte Carlo procedure which gener-\nates a proximity matrix for nonparametric missing data imputation, classification, prediction\nand matching problems [47]. Cox proportional hazard regression models, including stratified\nand recurrent models, were run using functions from the Survival package [48].\nSome analysis and adjustments to the data were made by the NACJD prior to this research\nproject, and we cannot describe their work in this paper. The NACJD investigators did have\naccess to the relevant death file, but could not describe how censoring accounted for mortality\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nat the time of our research project. We do know that parolees were censored when their parole\nperiod ended without a violation or when the study period ended before they had either vio-\nlated or completed parole. We also know that there was left-truncation of the data set (for\nexample, almost half the observations used in the final model are for parolees who had been on\nparole for more than a year before the observation period begins).\nRationale for using recurrent events survival models. The standard Cox proportional\nhazards model is a nonparametric type of survival analysis that allows for adjusted calcula-\ntions of hazard ratios without needing to express a baseline hazard. However, upon release\nparolees could have accumulated several parole violations before being returned to prison.\nTherefore, it was necessary to use a survival analysis model that could accommodate recur-\nrent events within a subject. There are several approaches to recurrent events survival analy-\nsis that have been shown to be superior to the standard Cox proportional hazards model\n[49]. This may be accomplished by using a counting process approach, which considers sep-\narate event observations of the same subject as though they were from different subjects\nusing start and stop times for interval truncation [50]. Thus our data for time until parole\nviolation was converted into counting process format (stop/start times) for use in Cox pro-\nportional hazards models modified to account for recurrent events with discontinuous event\ntimes (time in prison was excluded from time at risk). It should be noted that because this\ncohort study used recurrent events survival analysis, we measured rates of parole violations\nrather than time until parole violations, unlike a conventional Cox proportional hazards\nmodel.\nAdjusting variance for within-subject correlation. Robust estimation was used to adjust\nthe variance of all model coefficients to account for within-subject correlation, using a sand-\nwich method similar to that introduced by Lin and Wei [51]. Frailty methods are considered\nmore effective than counting process models with robust error variance estimation at capturing\nheterogeneity when some subjects are believed to be more prone to accumulating events than\nothers, notably reducing the risk of underestimating effect sizes, but where there is no strong\nbiological relationship between first events and subsequent events, the methods are comparable\nand in some cases, their results are very similar [50, 52]. Because this technique involves adjust-\ning only the estimated variances and not the regression coefficients for the misspecification of\nthe correlation structure assumed (i.e., the non-independence of recurrent events), the hypoth-\nesis test using this method involves evaluating the confidence intervals for effect sizes, rather\nthan the effect sizes themselves [51].\nEvaluating the proportional hazards assumption. All variables were tested to determine\nwhether the hazard ratios for any two variables in a model were constant. These assumptions\nwere tested using a graphical approach. Specifically, log-log Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted.\nThey satisfied the assumption if the curves were subjectively parallel.\nStratified Cox procedure. The models produced in this study included variables that both\ndid and did not satisfy the proportional hazards assumption. That is, the hazard ratios for\nsome variables were not constant over time. A Cox stratified procedure was used to control for\nboth types of variables. This involves stratifying the data by a categorical variable that violates\nthe proportional hazards assumption [53]. One disadvantage of this method is that it does not\nshow how the hazard ratios vary over time.\nMissing data. Missing data on parole region (hence, exposure to prison crowding), time\nunder observation (days since release), and several of the covariates were imputed only for vio-\nlation events and censored observations. (Data on non-violation observation weeks are not\nused in the Cox proportional hazards model). Missing data were less extensive for these events\nthan for the dataset as a whole; the total percentage of imputed values was 11.5% and the high-\nest number of imputed values for a given event was three. The reasons for missing data are\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nunknown and may, therefore, be non-random. A random recursive partitioning (RRP) method\nfor non-parametric matching was used; this is a Monte Carlo procedure which generates a\nproximity matrix using regression trees for missing data imputation. The algorithm used 250\nreplications of the procedure, with continuous variables divided into 14 intervals [47]. Missing\ndata were then imputed using a hot-decking method, that is, one that matches persons with\nmissing data to persons with similar data on all other covariates and gives the corresponding\nvalue for the missing data [47].\nBaseline characteristics\nThis study's target population was predominantly male. Parolee demographics were 30.7%\nwhite (non-Latino) and 26.1% Black, despite the fact that there are six times as many non-\nLatino white people living in the state compared to non-Latino Blacks [54]. The categorical\ndata on race was transformed into a dichotomous variable for the analysis (either Black or\nnon-Black). Approximately 80% of the parolees were between 18 and 44 years of age. About\n66% reported having a substance use disorder and over half reported having a comorbid men-\ntal health condition [55]. Only aggregate level data were available on substance use disorder,\nhowever the final adjusted model does include mental health conditions as a controlled\nconfounder.\nThe type of offense for which subjects were on parole (not to be confused with the type of\nparole violation) was handled as a categorical variable, with drug offense as the reference value,\nas this was the largest category. For race and parole officer race, the reference category was\nnon-Black, and for sex and parole officer sex, the reference category was female. Three striker\nstatus refers to a \"three strikes law\" requiring harsher sentences for those with a second or third\nserious offense, and in this data set parolees are designated \"strikers\" if this was their second or\nthird serious offense. Serious offenses are distinguished from crimes such as personal drug use\nor tax evasion that are unlawful, but do not endanger others. Mental illness status was ascer-\ntained from official documentation on parolees, which may in some cases have been incom-\nplete. Parole supervision levels were defined as follows: (1) Minimum service level,\ncommunicating with the parole agent primarily through the mail (no drug testing), (2) Con-\ntrolled service level, a moderate level of supervision that may include services for drug use,\nmental health problems, education or employment deficits, (3) High control level, where the\nemphasis in supervision is on detecting or preventing serious criminal activity, (4) High ser-\nvices level, in which high levels of supervision are focused on the service needs of the parolee,\nand (5) High risk spec/non-spec, in which the parolee is supervised by a parole agent whose\ncaseload is composed entirely of high risk parolees who require a high level of supervision.\nThe baseline event characteristics are described in Table 1, broken down by crowding expo-\nsure level. Chi square statistics were calculated for differences across crowding levels, and\nTable 1 presents the p-values and degrees of freedom for these statistics. Because these are data\non parole violation or non-violation events (not persons), they represent a summation of the\nmost recent data for parolee characteristics with respect to each event for each person (for\nthose variables that may change between events).\nSignificant differences in exposure to prison crowding were found in most variable groups.\nThese groups included general demographic differences, offense type, parole region, supervi-\nsion level, and age at first incarceration. Black parolees were more likely than non-Black parol-\nees to have been in a prison with low crowding levels. Mentally ill parolees were more likely to\nhave been in a prison with high crowding levels. Parolees imprisoned for violent crimes were\nless likely to have been in a prison with high crowding levels, while the opposite was true for\nthose imprisoned for property crimes. Parolees at supervision level 1 were more likely to have\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nTable 1.

Those who had been imprisoned four or\nmore times before were more likely to experience higher levels of prison crowding than those\nimprisoned for the first time. Only the variable parole region differed dramatically between\ncrowding levels. Specifically, there were no prisons in either parole regions one or two that\nexperienced high levels of crowding. In region four, no prisons experienced low levels of\ncrowding.\nAdjustment for confounding. Hazard ratios were adjusted for confounding variables and\nfor variables that increased precision. Socioeconomic factors were also considered in our analy-\nsis, but were not significant confounders; these variables also had a disproportionately higher\nfrequency of missing values (>40%). No interaction effects were found between the variables.\nLeft-truncation of the dataset was accounted for by controlling for age at first incarceration. A\nCox stratified procedure (described above) was used to control for those variables that violated\nthe proportional hazards assumption and those that did not. Controlled variables that satisfied\nthe proportional hazards assumption were sex, race, mental health status, prior offense type,\nlevel of supervision, three-striker status, parole officer sex, and parole officer race. Controlled\nvariables that did not satisfy the proportional hazards assumption were sex offender status,\nparole region, age at first incarceration, age at release, number of prior imprisonments, and\nnumber of prior serious offenses leading to imprisonment.\nEthics Statement\nAll individual level data received anonymous identifiers and were encrypted for storage when\nnot in use. The National Archive of Criminal Justice Data reviewed and approved the study\nprotocol and data protection plan. Additionally, the study was reviewed and exempted by the\nTouro University-California Institutional Review Board (IRB) because only non-identifiable\ndata on human subjects were used.\nResults\nThis study period included 21 862 events that were either classified as violation or non-viola-\ntion events. The vast majority of the sample, approximately 98%, was observed for a period of\ning technical, criminal, and absconding violations. There were no missing violation values. In\nunadjusted analysis, parolees had fewer parole violations if they had been imprisoned at high\ncrowding levels for combined parole violation types, but they were more likely to have\nabsconded if they were imprisoned at medium crowding levels.\nTable 1.

Specific types of violations had different effect\nsizes. From largest to smallest, they were absconding, Type I, Type II, Type III, and technical\nviolations.\nCrude and partially adjusted results\nOverall, without any adjustments, the proportion of violations among low, medium, and high\ncrowding levels was relatively similar (41%, 41%, 33%, respectively). Partially adjusted Kaplan-\nMeier curves for all violation types diverged over the 50-month period, most immediately after\nrelease, and the effects were positively proportional to crowding level. The largest effects were\nseen for combined, absconding, and Type I violations (Fig 1).\nFig 1A shows that by the end of the study period, fewer than 20% of parolees from high\ncrowding prisons remained without parole violations, whereas close to 40% of those from mod-\nerately crowded prisons, and even more from prisons with low levels of crowding, remained\nwithout parole violations. For both combined violations and absconding violations, that is, Fig\n1A and 1B, the differences between crowding levels are dramatic within the first 500 days of\nparole. For level one violations, shown in Fig 1C, close to 80% of parolees remained without a\nviolation at all crowding levels, but the curves do still diverge significantly, with higher rates of\nparole violations for parolees who had been imprisoned at higher crowding levels.\nAdjusted results for any violation type\nAfter all adjustments, rates of parole violations were 2.28\u00ad2.77 times greater for parolees from\nhighly crowded prisons compared to those from prisons with low levels of crowding (HR 2.52,\npresented in Table 2. Hazard ratios for controlled confounders are also reported because these\nprovide, in a very limited fashion, indirect information about the relative importance of some\nuncontrolled confounders (e.g., surveillance bias, socioeconomic status, history of SUD).\nAdjusted results for specific violation types\nCrowding level-dependent effects were found for each parole violation type (Table 2). The larg-\nest effects of high vs. low crowding were found for absconding violations (HR 3.56, 95% CI:\ntern.

Parolees with three striker status had lower rates of\nsion level were also significantly associated with rates of parole violation, but as with the other\nconfounders, all these effect sizes were comparatively small.

The latter association was particularly strong for Type II parole violations (HR 5.78, 95%\nCI 4.77\u00ad7.01), which include property crimes. Parolees who had been imprisoned for violent\ncrimes were, however, more likely to have committed a Type II or Type III parole violation\nthan those who had been imprisoned for drug crimes.\nDiscussion\nThis study asked whether prison crowding is associated with higher rates of parole violations.\nRates of parole violations were found to be directly associated with prison crowding levels, par-\nticularly for absconding violations and drug charges. The cause of parolee absconding is not\nalways known. An indirect relationship with drug use is supported by some previous research\n[56, 57]. Other reasons for absconding could include seeking instrumental support from family\nTable 2.

A Cox stratified procedure was used to adjust for covariates not meeting the proportional\nhazards assumption as well as those that did meet this assumption. These variables are sex offender status, parole region, age first incarcerated, age\nwhen released, number of prior imprisonments, and number of prior serious offenses.\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nand friends outside the parole region, or difficulty meeting parole conditions such as finding\nand maintaining local employment. After absconding, the second largest effect was seen in\nType I criminal violations, which are considered to be the least serious and are almost entirely\ndrug-related.\nSubstance use disorder (SUD), which is overrepresented in prison populations, may be\ninadequately treated in crowded prisons, increasing the risk of drug-related recidivism for this\nsubgroup of parolees. Almost a third of recidivists return due to drug offenses [58]. In this\nrespect, SUD-related violations represent a major vulnerability within the parole system. For\ninstance, in Ohio and Texas, former prisoners with SUD are three times more likely to return\nto prison one year after release [59]. Others have found that parolees with SUDs that are\ncomorbid with other psychiatric conditions have a significantly higher likelihood of returning\nto prison within one year after release [60\u00ad61]. Nationally, 42.8% of individuals with SUDs also\nhave had a comorbid psychiatric disorder [62].\nSmaller magnitude-dependent effects were also seen for Types II and III violations. Type II\nviolations include moderately serious drug offenses, such as sales and trafficking, but they also\ninclude property offenses, consensual sex offenses, and other non-violent offenses. Type III\nviolations are serious violent and sexual offenses. The association with Type III violations was\nlarge enough to warrant further research on the impact crowding might have on public safety\n(e.g., rape, homicide, burglary, child abuse). This finding is consistent with research that\nreports that crowding induced violence against inmates is brutalizing in nature and may have\nan unintended violent criminogenic effect [63]. The smallest effect size was seen with technical\nviolations. Such events are not normally associated with criminal sanctions, and they include\nbehaviors such as missing appointments, traveling outside a parole boundary, accessing legal\nweapons, and other non-criminal parole conditions.\nThe relationship between prison crowding and recidivism may be mediated by stress hor-\nmones such as cortisol, which is associated with impaired executive function in children\nexposed to crowding-related stress [13]. An impairment in executive function has also been\nshown in parents exposed to residential crowding, and in patients with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder [14, 64]. Alternatively, executive function may also be impaired from drug use in\nthose with active SUD, who may have limited access to drug treatment in more crowded pri-\nsons. However, the literature on adverse effects of prison crowding on inmate health and\nbehavior is sparse, and the literature on crowding, executive function and aggression is most\nextensive for studies on childhood behavior and development [65]. Only studies on children\nshow adverse effects from crowding that are measureable after research subjects have been\nexposed to the crowded environment, as opposed to within crowded conditions [13, 15].\nStrong claims about cause and effect are impossible without further research, particularly on\nthe mediating roles of cognition, social environment and coping skills.\nThe relationship between prison crowding and recidivism may also be mediated by infec-\ntious, chronic and non-substance related psychiatric conditions that contribute to incarcera-\ntion. Crowding has been repeatedly linked to high blood pressure levels in prison populations,\nthe prison prevalence of infectious diseases is substantially higher than the national average,\nand upon release from prison, parolees have decreased access to care [65, 6, 66, 67]. The strain,\nmonetary and otherwise, of an added disease burden related to exposure to prison crowding\ncould lead to an increased parole violation rate. Due to limitations in available data, informa-\ntion about individual parolees' physical health conditions was not available. However, informa-\ntion pertaining to mental health conditions was available. The results indicate that parolees\nwith this designation had higher rates of parole violations (of all types) than those without a\nan interaction in parolees with co-occurring disorders.\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nThe potential for an effect of increased recidivism risk for parolees with chronic conditions\nis still possible. However, past research has shown only a very weak correlation between parol-\nees with chronic physical conditions and a greater risk for recidivism [68]. These parolees tend\nto be older, and age is a known confounder for recidivism. Further research is needed among\nthis older population.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, weighted averages for crowding measures were aggre-\ngated at the level of parole region for each observation point. The potential of an ecological fal-\nlacy bias arises for this reason, although it has been mitigated by hybridizing individual-level\ndata into multi-level models [69]. For example, if residency in Los Angeles County or Southern\nCalifornia carries additional risk factors for higher rates of parole violations, aggregating\ncrowding data by region would introduce important confounders to the model. Hybrid multi-\nlevel modeling mitigates this problem by nesting individual-level data with ecological variables,\nso that, in this case, risk factors for parole violation that vary by region (e.g., supervision level,\nrace) were captured at the individual level. Any number of missing variables may act as ecologi-\ncal confounders, such as regional variation in levels of access to SUD treatment outside the\nprison system, or regional variation in the intensity of the drug trade.\nSecond, more than 15% of the values were missing for the following variables: age at release\nreasons for missing data are unknown and may, therefore, be non-random. A random recur-\nsive partitioning method (described in the methods section) for missing data imputation was\nused to help lessen potential bias. Only data on violation events were imputed, and it should be\nnoted that the vast majority of missing data on parole region, age at release and days since\nrelease was for non-violation observations that were not censored. Because there were much\nhigher rates of missing data for censored events on supervision level, parole officer race and\nparole officer sex for observation week 105 only (the final observation week in the data set), the\nimputation was done using data through week 104 only.\nThird, we do not know how the data set was censored before it was made available to us.\nOverall, the data was left-truncated and right-censored, but we do not have a description of\nhow mortality was handled in the censoring. This is an important limitation to our paper, as\nwe are unable to report tests on informative censoring that would shed light on a potential\nsource of bias in our analysis.\nIt is possible that crowding does not significantly increase the risk of recidivism among Cali-\nfornia parolees. Risk factors outside of the criminal justice system (e.g., poverty, child abuse\nhistory, employment status, familial integrity) could potentially overshadow the effect of\ncrowding; if they vary by region within the state of California, they represent important\nunmeasured confounders with crowding in this ecological analysis. The influence of social\ndeterminants of health (e.g., poverty, county discipline, public assistance) on rates of recidivism\ncould not be included in our analysis because the percentage of missing values was too high\n(>40%) for the data to be imputed. Information on race was limited to a dichotomous variable\n(Black or non-Black). Important confounders with the demographic variables race, age and\ndisability (mental illness), such as socioeconomic status and education level, could not be\nincluded in the model because of the missing data, making the interpretation of the results for\ndemographic variables somewhat ambiguous. Low socioeconomic status, limited access to pub-\nlic assistance, low education levels and an adverse social environment are all risk factors for\nboth SUD and incarceration that may be overrepresented in regions with higher rates of prison\ncrowding.\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nSurveillance bias or differences across regions in quantitative enforcement activity targets\nmay also have biased the results. Quotas and other similar police management tools have been\nshown to strongly predict arrest rates even where measures have been taken to preserve officer\ndiscretion and prevent arbitrary arrests [70]. Many parole agents attest that parole violations\nare highly subjective, that is, that \"a parole agent can always find a violation for a parolee if he\nor she wants to\" [20]. Surveillance bias could also explain why all types of parole violations,\nincluding technical violations, were directly associated with prison crowding.\nUnfortunately, history of SUD was only measured at the aggregate level in this data set, and\naccess to drug treatment in prison was not measured at all. If prison crowding prevents some\ninmates with SUD from receiving adequate drug treatment prior to release, this could be an\nimportant predictor of drug-related parole violations. Our aggregate level data on this prison\npopulation shows that SUD is highly prevalent in this sampling frame, so this represents\nanother important uncontrolled confounder in our analysis--we do not have data on whether\nor not SUD prevalence varies by region among California parolees.\nMost of the parolees in this study had just served less than five months in prison, making\nthe control variables for prior history of imprisonment important covariates in our model. The\nadjusted analysis controlled for age at first incarceration, number of prior offenses leading to\nimprisonment (\"number of returns to prison\" in Table 1), number of prior serious offenses,\nprior offense type and three-striker status. There may, however, be important related con-\nfounders not included in the model, such as total duration of time in prison inclusive of all\nprior offenses.\nFinally, the Cox proportional hazards model assumes that observations among individuals\nare independent. This study's data involved repeated events within subjects. Although the beta\ncoefficients in the study models were not adjusted, the variances were adjusted for using an\nempirical estimator. These adjustments allowed for comparisons between the hypotheses and\ntheir confidence intervals [51]. However, robust error variance estimation does not capture\nheterogeneity among parolees in rates of recidivism; instead, this method considers within-\nsubject event likelihood correlation to be a nuisance variable. Offense type was an important\nconfounder in our model, strongly predictive of parole violation type in adjusted analysis. This\ndoes suggest within-subject correlation in propensity to violate parole.\nStudy Implications\nPrevious corrections studies have posited that adverse prison conditions act to deter freed pris-\noners from returning to prison. The present findings do not support this deterrent model of\ncorrections, instead agreeing with other findings [22, 26]. Additional criminal justice\napproaches to drug use, such as arrests, have similarly been found to be counterproductive\n[71]. Average outpatient drug treatment in the United States costs 14.4 times less, and long-\nterm residential drug treatment costs 3.8 times less, than incarceration [72]. In 2010, CDCR\nreported that the annual cost of incarcerating a single prisoner was $45000 per year. Addition-\nally, states with higher than national average drug treatment rates send approximately 100\nfewer people to prison per 100000 than states with below national average drug treatment rates\n[73]. Mental health courts are also considered an important means of redressing prison crowd-\ning; a shortage of beds in inpatient psychiatric wards is directly related to the high prevalence\nof mental illness in prison populations [74].\nThe relationship between mass incarceration and crowding-related stress as well as prison\nviolence and lack of access to SUD care may explain the finding that parolees who experienced\nhigher levels of prison crowding had higher rates of parole violations, and that this association\nwas particularly strong for drug-related parole violations. Potential interventions include\nPrison Crowding and Substance Use-Related Recidivism\nmeasures to redress both prison crowding and negligent SUD and mental health care, such as\nthe use of mandatory drug treatment referrals as an alternative to incarceration, and increased\nuse of mental health courts. Further research on the association between prison crowding and\nrecidivism is warranted.\nFuture Areas of Research\nAdverse prison experiences. Further research on negligent SUD care and prison violence\nwould be needed to better understand the relationship between prison crowding and both\nPTSD and SUD. In addition, data on drug-related parole violations are no substitute for direct\nmeasures of SUD relapse among parolees. Additional research on the relationship between\naccess to drug treatment in prison and rates of SUD relapse is warranted.\nCounty and city jails. A recent criminal justice reform (known as the Public Safety\nRealignment Act), charges counties and municipalities with additional responsibilities, includ-\ning; supervision of most state parolees and incarceration of most newly convicted persons, as\nwell as parole violators [75]. Little is known about the potential effect that such a large burden\non county facilities could have. Many counties, similar to the state, have opted to construct\nmore detention facilities [76]. As a whole California jails already are over capacity [77]. More\ninformation about the effects of overcrowding in county jails is currently needed.\nSupporting Information\nS1 File.
