However, partners\nranked highest, which is natural for people at the start of their reproductive career. All\nstudents gave to their parents, siblings, and children, most gave to their grandparents, and\nonly a third gave to some, but not all, of their genetic aunts/uncles. Twenty percent gave to\nfirst cousins, and none to second or third cousins. Similar patterns for gifts received were\nfound. There were also sex differences (e.g. women had larger exchange networks than\nmen), and birth order effects. Firstborns spent more on relatives than laterborns. However,\nmiddleborns gave more to their male friends than both firstborns and lastborns. We conclude\nthat the results are consistent with theories of kin selection, reciprocity, sex differences and\nbirth order effects.\n",

The human tendency to reciprocate a gift may be classified as a \"human instinct\"\n(Ridley, 1996, p. 121). The importance of a gift is usually not the transfer of an object in\nitself, but the social aspect, especially in terms of obligations, namely to give, to receive, and\nIn the old Norwegian Gulating law and other old Germanic law it was actually stated\nthat a gift should be valued with an equal gift in return (Hamre, 1960). In the old\nScandinavian civilization, as well as in a number of others, exchanges and contracts take\nplace in the form of presents which are voluntary in theory, but are given and reciprocated\nobligatory in reality (Mauss, 1950/1990). The notion of reciprocity seems to be a central\naspect of gift giving among humans in all cultures (e.g. Cheal, 1986; Davis, 1972; Hamre,\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nReciprocal giving of gifts is also a marked feature of the Christmas festivities in England\nAlthough some repayment is expected for any gift, it is crucial that it be deferred. To\nreciprocate at once indicates a desire to end the relationship, whereas delayed payment\nmakes the strings between giver and receiver longer and stronger (Mauss, 1950/1990). Note\nthat Christmas gifts represent an exception in this regard because the gifts given and\nreceived are expected to be exchanged simultaneously (Cheal, 1988; Davis, 1992). In\naddition, it is typical that Christmas gifts are distributed at gatherings where every person\ngives and receives gifts (Caplow, 1984).\nanthropological social-exchange literature and noted that the review supported general\nexpectations of the theories of kin selection (Hamilton, 1964) and reciprocal altruism\nanthropological exchange literature in light of these two evolutionary theories. Five\npredictions were all supported in most studies reviewed. 1. Kin will be given more\nunreciprocated help than non-kin, with close kin receiving the most unreciprocated help. 2.\nKin will be given more help than non-kin, with close kin receiving the most help. 3.\nFriendships will be reciprocal. 4. Large gifts and long-term loans are most likely to come\nfrom kin. 5. Individuals requiring unreciprocated help over long periods of time will\ngradually be abandoned by their former helpers. Even though Essock-Vitale and McGuire\n(1980) discussed the broader aspect of helping behavior, gift-giving behavior was a central\npart of their focus. But most of the data they reviewed was qualitative rather than\nquantitative. We wanted to extend the quantitative part of the data base on gift-giving\nbehavior and focus on the first four of their five predictions.\nA partner is the prerequisite for successful reproduction. We therefore tested if\npartners were given the most expensive gifts. We also asked if having a partner would affect\nthe gift-giving behavior relative to single individuals. We also studied if there were any sex\ndifferences in gift-giving behavior. Because women are the most investing sex in the\noffspring with larger need for all kinds of support and protection for themselves and their\noffspring (Judge, 1995; Judge and Hrdy, 1992), they may have a larger network of persons\nthey exchange gifts with than men.\nFinally, we asked if there were any birth-order effects (Davis, 1997; Hertwig, Davis,\ndocumented substantive birth-order effects for several personality traits, and we wanted to\ntest if functional firstborns (hereafter firstborns) differed from functional laterborns\n(hereafter laterborns) when concerning investment in their relatives. Since for example\nfirstborns identify more strongly with parents and with authority, we expected that they\nmight invest more in their close relatives than laterborns. Several studies have found that\nmiddleborns are distinct from first- and lastborns (Kennedy, 1989; Kidwell, 1982; Rohde et\nmiddleborns were less likely to indicate having a close relationship with their parents\n(Kennedy, 1989). We wanted to test if middleborns invested less in their close relatives than\nfirst- and lastborns or in other ways had different gift-giving behavior at Christmas.\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nMethods\nFifty graduate students out of a possible 338 at Department of Biology, University of\nOslo in Norway were interviewed during January 7-20 1998 about their gift behavior before\nand at Christmas 1997. The inclusion criteria was 1) Christian background, and 2) not\nentered paid work. The interviews were conducted by two of us (IM and TD), 25 each.\nTwenty-five males and 25 females were interviewed in private for 30-60 minutes, depending\non how many people each of them had given gifts to. We did not inform about the\ntheoretical background for the study but stressed that all answers were confidential.\nWe first asked about age, birth order (including number of brothers and sisters,\nnumber of year between them as firstborn and the next brother or sister or as later born and\nthe elder brother or sister next to them), address, civil status (married/co-inhabitant, with or\nwithout girl/boyfriend), how long they had been together with their partner, if their parents\nwere married or divorced, and if divorced, when that happened, and if their parents had new\npartners. We also asked why they give presents at Christmas. We then asked about each\nperson they had given a gift to: sex, age, the student's relation to them, birth-order\nparameters (see above), address, occupation and if they were working, how often he/she\ntalked and met them, if they subjectively felt that the person in question lived far away, how\nmuch time it usually took to visit them, when they bought/made the gift, what was given, the\nprice of it, if they bought/made the gift themselves, how many people shared the expenses\non the gift, what was received, price of what was received, and how many people gave the\nreceived gift. Then we noted possible relatives (aunts, uncles, first cousins, nieces, nephews\naso.) they did not give anything to, and why nothing was given. We also asked if they had\nreceived anything from persons they did not return a gift to and noted the student's relation\nto them and what was given. We asked if they had any relatives they did not get anything\nfrom. Finally we asked what kind of \"gift philosophy\" they used among six alternatives, or if\nthey used other principles. The least relevant data are omitted from this paper.\nThe students were generally positive to and interested in the project. It was our\nimpression that they answered honestly and in most cases remembered well who they had\ngiven to, what they had given and the price of it, and what they had received. They had more\ndifficulty with the price of what they had received. In many instances they had no idea about\nit, which is as expected with a norm of not asking about the price of a gift received.\nCharacteristics of the study population\nThe students' age lay between 23 and 31 years with a mean age of 26.0 years (SD =\nfirstborns and 22 laterborns in the sample (12 firstborn men, 16 firstborn women, 13\nlaterborn men, and 9 laterborn women). Mean age of these four categories was 26.0 (SD =\nconsisted of 9 middleborns and 13 lastborns (5 middleborn men, 4 middleborn women, 8\n= 2.1), and 25.2 (SD = 1.3), respectively. Thus, for both sexes, first- and laterborns, and\nfirst-, middle-, and laterborns, the ages were similar and the group pretty homogenous. Age\nof student was positively correlated with father\u00b4s age (p = .01), but not with mother's age (p\n= .34). Firstborns had younger mothers, but not younger fathers, than laterborns (p < .001\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nand p = .12, respectively). Firstborns and laterborns did not differ in how old their\ngrandparents were (p = .19). There was no association between the grandparents' age and\nthe students' age (p = .22).\nForty-two of the students had parents who were still married, five had divorced\nparents, and the parents of three students were widows/widowers. Forty-eight had genetic\nuncles and/or aunts, and 38 had grandparents alive. Five students were married, 16 were\nliving together without being married, 12 had a girl/boyfriend, 16 had no girl/boyfriend at\nthe moment and one was in the \"other\" category (no longer cohabiting, child from prior\ncohabitation). The latter was excluded from the variable civil status in the statistical\nanalyses. If one focuses on the period of time the students had been married, been living\ntogether or had a girl/boyfriend, the mean duration was 4.3 years (SD = 2.1; n = 25 available\nfor analysis). The students gave to a mean of 2.2 friends (SD = 2.7).\nCoding of data and statistical analyses\nWhen coding for functional birth order sensu Sulloway (1996) and Salmon and Daly\n(1998), one laterborn twin was coded as lastborn (the pair of twins was lastborn with one\nolder sibling) and only children (two men, one woman) were coded as firstborn. To test for\nlinear effects, firstborns were coded as 1, middleborns as 2, and lastborns as 3, and to test for\nquadratic effects, these three birth orders were coded as -1, 2, and -1, respectively.\nThe statistical analyses were done by means of the program S-PLUS version 4.5,\nusing standard tests such as paired t-test, ANOVA and Pearson regression analysis. For all\nregressions and ANOVAs, the assumptions of the models were checked (homogeneity of\nvariance by means of residual plots, normality of the data by means of QQ-plots) and log-\ntransformation (ln) of the variables performed if necessary. For imbalanced data sets,\nadjusted means are presented (instead of means). For the logistic regression analyses, the\nvalidity of the conclusions was checked by looking at the residual deviance, testing for\noverdispersion and using dispersion test. To save space, we mostly report only the p-values\n(alpha significance level of 0.5).\nResults\nAll students gave and received gifts. They gave gifts to a total of 550 persons (M:\n11.1, SE = .8), what we have termed \"gift-giving relations\", and received gifts from a total\nof 537 persons (mean: 10.7, SE = .8), what we have termed \"gift-receiving relations\". These\nnumbers did not differ (p = .42). The students gave a total of 719 gifts (mean: 14.4, SD =\n(p < .01). The total number of gifts given by a student was highly correlated with the total\n(approximately $190) in total for Christmas gifts (self-made gifts excluded). Excluding self-\nmade gifts, and cases where we did not know the price, the average student spent NOK 173\n(SE = 11) per gift-giving relation.\nRelatives and partners\nAll students of both sexes gave gifts to their closest family (to all mothers, fathers,\nbrothers, sisters and children). They also received gifts from at least one parent and own\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nchildren above a certain age. Thirty-two of 38 gave to their grandparents (Table 1), and 32\nalso received gifts from at least one of them. Forty-five of 46 received gifts from at least one\nof their siblings.\nTable 1. Number of men, women and all students who gave gifts to their grandparents out\nof number who could have given. The upper part shows how many of the students who gave\nto grandparents on mother's and father's side,1 the middle part sees the grandparents\ntogether while the lower part shows how many gave to all or 50% of their grandparents.\nRelation/explanation Men Women Total\n# who\ngave\n# who could\nhave given\n# who\ngave\n# who could\nhave given\n# who\ngave\n# who could\nhave given\ngrandparents\n1. Persons may be listed in more than one of these four categories, e.g. due to both having given to mother's\nmother and mother's father.\nTwenty-one of the students gave gifts to at least one of their uncles and/or aunts,\nwhile 22 received gifts from at least one. Out of 48 who had first cousins, only 10 students\ngave to one or more of them, and nine received gifts from one or more.\nOf 27 students who received one or more gifts (mean 2.4), with a value above NOK\n544 (mean value for all), 22 got it from their parents, four from their siblings, and five from\ntheir grandparents. Of non-kin, partners were on top with eight students receiving such gifts.\nNote that a student may be counted in more than one category.\nIn terms of money spent, the students gave significantly more to partners than to\neach of the other categories (all p < .01), relatively equally to their parents and siblings, and\nan equal, but less, amount to people in each of the other categories (Figure 1). They tended\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nto give slightly more to parents than siblings (p = .08), and more to parents than to\ngrandparents, genetic uncles/aunts, first cousins, friends, other family and \"others\" (all p <\n.02). The students also gave more to siblings than to grandparents, genetic uncles/aunts,\nfriends, other family and \"others\" (p < .007). They also spent more money on friends than\non people in category \"others\" (p = .005).\nFigure 1.

However, organizing the\ndata with all data points for giving to each of these six categories as one response variable, a\nregression with coefficient of relatedness as predictor was highly significant (p < .001; log-\ntransformed response variable): the larger coefficient of relatedness (r), the more money was\nspent on gifts. To see if each person invested in each of these same six categories in\nproportion to degree of relatedness, we added number of persons the students could have\ngiven to when estimating mean values (which only affected gifts to grandparents, genetic\nuncles/aunts, and first cousins) (Figure 2). Roughly, students invested twice as much in\nparents and siblings (r = .5) as in grandparents and nephews/nieces (r = .25), but much less\nin genetic uncles/aunts. In first cousins (r = .125), they invested equally little as in genetic\nuncles/aunts. The correlation between the means for each category and the coefficient of\nrelatedness was fairly high (p < .02).\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nFigure 2. Mean (+SE) amount of money spent on gifts to people in the relation categories\nwhen number of persons each could have given to, but did not give to, is included. Sample\nsizes are indicated above bars.\nParents (0.5) Brothers/sisters (0.5) Grand parents (0.25) Nephews/nieces (0.25) Genetic uncles/aunts\nCategory of relationship (r)\nAmount of money (NOK)\nMore money was spent on gifts to mothers the closer she lived (p = .01), and the\nmore often a student talked with her (p < .05), although the latter relationship was no longer\nsignificant when controlling for distance (p = .14). If we combine birth order, civil status,\nhow often a student talked to the mother, and distance to where she lived in the same model,\nthere was no significant interaction between the four factors. Using type III Sum of Squares,\ndistance to where mother lived did not add to the model. Removing this variable, there were\nsignificant effects of birth order (p = .01), civil status (p < .01), and frequency of talking (p\n< .01). We found no association between mean amount of money given to mothers and\nfathers and the mean age of the mothers and fathers (p = .69 and p = .43, respectively, log-\ntransformed response variables). Likewise, money spent on grandparents was unrelated to\nthe mean age of grandparents (p = .87; log-transformed response variable). When\ncontrolling for number of brothers, the students' age could explain a significant proportion\nof the variance on how much was spent on gifts to brothers (p < .03): the older the student,\nthe less was given to brothers.\nMany students did not give gifts to \"half near\" family (i.e. grandparents, aunts and\nuncles or first cousins), and we asked them why. Twenty-two of the 50 students answered\nthat it was due to sparse contact, 18 answered that it was due to tradition or convention in\nthe family of not doing so, and nine replied that they could not afford it or that it would be\ntoo many to give to. Only two gave to all first cousins, aunts, uncles and so forth. Note that\nmost of the persons the students referred to as \"half near\" family were first cousins, and that\nthe students were allowed to give more than one score.\nThe more often the students talked with their female friends, the more was spent on\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\ngifts to them (p = .02). This was also nearly significant when controlling for number of\nfemale friends given to (p = .06).\nCivil status\nThere was a significant correlation between number of gift-giving relations and civil\nstatus (p = .002): married/cohabiting students had more gift-giving relations than unmarried\nones without partner, and the latter had fewer gift-giving relations than unmarried ones with\npartner. This held also true when excluding friends from the analysis (p < .001). Focusing\non number of friends given to, there was no effect of civil status. There was no interaction\nbetween sex of giver and civil status on number of gift-giving relations, but significant main\neffects for both (sex: p < .001; civil status: p < .01; type III sum of squares). Similarly, there\nwas a significant correlation between (log-transformed) number of gift-receiving relations\nand civil status (p < .001): married/cohabiting and unmarried with partner both had more\ngift-receiving relations than unmarried ones without partner (adjusted means of 12.8, 11.7,\nand 6.6, respectively). There was no interaction between sex of giver and civil status, but\nthere were significant main effects for both (sex: p < .001; civil status: p < .001; type III\nsum of squares).\nMarried/cohabitant gave more gifts than unmarried with and without partner\nmarried/cohabitant spent more money than unmarried with partner, who again spent more\nrespectively; p < .02). However, when controlling for number of gift-giving relations the\neffect of civil status was no longer significant (p = .33).\nMarried/cohabitant gave gifts worth more to their partner than unmarried with\nmarried/cohabitant students spent less money on gifs to their mothers than both unmarried\nSex differences\nWomen had more gift-giving relations than men (modal numbers of 13 and 8,\nrespectively; p < .001). When excluding friends from the analysis, no statistical association\nwith sex of giver was found. Women gave to many more friends than men (mean number of\n3.9 and 0.6, respectively; p < .001). There was no correlation between how many non-\nfriends the students gave to (mainly own and partner's family) and number of friends they\nWomen had also more gift-receiving relations than men (modal numbers of 13 and 8,\nrespectively; p < .001). When excluding friends from the analysis, a tendency for women to\nreceive gifts from more persons than men still existed (mean values of 9.1 and 6.8,\nrespectively; p < .06). Men hardly ever received gifts from friends (mean value of 0.3 for\nmen and 3.2 for women; p < .001). Similarly, women gave more gifts than men (mean\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nrespectively; p < .001). Number of gift-giving relations (excluding relations which only\nwere given a self-made gift or where the price was unknown) was correlated with money\nspent in total (p < .001). Controlling for this factor revealed that the sex link was still\npresent (p = .05). Sex of giver could not explain the variation in any of the relation\ncategories, with the exception of partners: there was a tendency for women to give more\nthan men to partners (adjusted means of NOK 707 and 515, respectively; p = .09), which\nwas significant if an outlier was removed (p < .05).\nControlling for number of sisters, the only factors that explained how much was\nspent on gifts to sisters were sex of giver, age and their interaction (number of sisters: p =\n.44; sex: p = .04; age: p < .01; and sex*age: p = .03; log-transformed response variable,\ntype III Sum of Squares). The older the student, the less was spent on gifts to sisters, but\nbelow age 25, men spent more than women, while above this age, women spent more than\nmen. Women both talked to and met their sisters more often than did men (p < .01 and p <\n.001, respectively), even when controlling for age (p < .01 for both).\nWe classified a response variable for students who bought/made all gifts themselves\n(n = 20) versus students who had someone else buy/make at least one of the gifts (n = 30).\nOne-way logistic regressions revealed no influence of sex or age of giver. Logistic\nregression of the giftmakers (8) and non-giftmakers (42) showed that sex of giver, but not\nage or birth order (linear and quadratic), could explain this habit (p < .001). All eight\ngiftmakers were women. Five of them gave at least one such gift to a friend.\nBirth order\nFirstborns spent more than laterborns per gift-giving relation (adjusted means of\nNOK 188 and 154, respectively; p = .05). In general, firstborns gave more to their parents\nand grandparents than laterborns (Figure 3; p < .01 for both). The statistical tests were done\non log-transformed response variables, but Figure 3 shows the untransformed ones.\nFirstborns gave much more to their mothers than laterborns (adjusted means of NOK 267\nand 177, respectively; p = .03), and also more to fathers (adjusted means of NOK 269 and\n153, respectively; p = .005). Money spent on fathers correlated with distance to where the\nfather was living (p = .04). However, combining distance and birth order in the same model,\nthere was no interaction and distance to father's home added little (distance: p < .10, birth\norder: p = .01; type III Sum of Squares).\nWe tested if birth order influenced how often the students talked to and met their\nclosest relatives. Almost significant quadratic effects for how often they met mothers (p <\n.06) and fathers (p = .08; log-transformed response variables) were found. Firstborns had\nmore such contact with their fathers than lastborns (adjusted means of 3.05 and 2.71,\nrespectively), but lastborns had more contact with their mothers than firstborns (adjusted\nmeans of 3.42 and 3.05, respectively). Middleborns met their mothers and fathers least often\n(adjusted means of 2.36 and 2.33, respectively). We therefore tested if the linear birth-order\neffects found for how much was spent on gifts to mothers and fathers were still present\nwhen controlling for how often the students met their parents. The effects were still present\n(p = .01 for both tests).\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nFigure 3.

For how much was given\nto siblings, only near-significant quadratic birth-order effects were found (p = .06).\nHowever, the more siblings the students had, the less money was spent on gifts to each of\nthem (p < .01), and when controlling for number of siblings, quadratic birth-order effects\ndisappeared (p = .64). Controlling for number of brothers, firstborns gave more to brothers\nthan laterborns (p = .02). There was also a quadratic birth-order effect (p < .05), but it was\nnot quite significant when controlling for number of brothers (p = .08). Combining birth\norder (linear) and age in the same model, there was no interaction, and age was most\nimportant for money spent on gifts to brothers (age: p < .04; birth order: p < .07; type III\nSum of Squares). Firstborns received gifts of higher value from their brothers than did\nlastborns, who in turn received more than middleborns (adjusted means of 5.65, 5.23, and\n4.73, respectively; p = .04; log-transformed response variable). With exception of this\nfinding, we found no significant birth order effects on how much was received from the\nvarious groups of relatives.\nIn logistic regressions, we considered people who had aunts and a yes-no to if they\ngave to at least one of them, as response variable. We then performed one-way analyses with\nseveral predictor variables. Only birth order was significant; more firstborns than laterborns\ngave to aunts (p < .01). No such relationship held for uncles.

A similar pattern was found for who in\nthe family gifts were received from, although some more students received gifts from\naunts/uncles than they gave to. Out of those students who could have given gifts to first\ncousins, slightly above 20% gave, and none gave to second or third cousins (similarly for\nreceived gifts), which is in accordance with what has been found elsewhere for cousins\nThe closer the kin, the more often a gift was given. Together with some earlier\nand Gill, 2003), it therefore seems that people of Western protestant cultures give to the\nclosest family (r = .5), most people give to grandparents (r = .25), fewer to genetic\naunts/uncles (r = .25), even fewer to first cousins (r = .125) and nobody to family with r <\n.125. Our main result about gift-giving in relation to kinship is therefore in accordance with\nwhat has been hypothesized from theory to be a universal feature (Daly et al., 1997, p. 282;\nThe students seemed to give as much to each of friends as to grandparents, genetic\nuncles/aunts, and the remaining category \"others\". One here has to keep in mind that all\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\n\"made\" gifts are excluded from this analysis and that a lot of these gifts were to friends.\nNumber of friends the students gave to seemed to be relatively independent of how large\ntheir extended family was (similar results by Dunbar and Spoors, 1995). The network of\nfriends may be maintained at the same time as economic expenditures are kept down by\nexchanging small, relatively cheap or self-made gifts. Thus, friendship may not primarily be\nmaintained by gift giving but by other forms of mutual assistance, like help in daily life\nStudents with a partner spent less on gifts to mothers than those who had no partner.\nWhen controlling for number of non-friends given to (mainly own and partner's family), the\nassociation became weaker. Thus it seems that less money is spent on one's own mother\nwhen their family in a wide sense increases. This may be to keep the total expenses down,\nbut also because less time is available per relation, and because the need for help from one's\nmother may be reduced. Similar arguments may explain why older students tended to spend\nless on gifts to brothers and sisters than younger students, namely to keep expenses down,\nand because of reduced contact with siblings, and reduced need for family assistance.\nGeographical distance\nThe closer the parents lived relative to the student, the more was spent on gifts to\nthem. Moreover, students talking often with their mother, spent more on gifts for her.\nDistance was less important than other variables in explaining money spent on gifts to\nmothers and fathers, and it was not significant for money spent on gifts to grandparents,\nbrothers and sisters. However, our findings fit with Cunningham's (1985) hypothesis that\nhumans have a tendency to become attached to those with whom they encounter most\ngifts may also repair and reinforce the kinship ties when weakened by distance (Caplow,\nGifts to partner and importance of civil status\nWe found that partners were the most likely of non-kin to give large gifts, which is in\naccordance with earlier findings (Borch, 1994; Bussey, Banks, Darrington, Driscoll,\n1986; Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1985). Gift giving can be an elaborate courtship ritual in\nhumans (Saad and Gill, 2003) and a way to avoid splitting up an important non-kin\nWe found that students with a partner had both more gift-giving and gift-receiving\nrelations than those without a partner, which is trivial (and also found by Borch, 1994)\nbecause the former had more people (partner's family) to give to and to receive from.\nHaving a partner may diminish the generosity toward friends compared to being single\n(Komter and Vollebergh, 1997). However, we found no effect of civil status on the number\nof gift-giving relations to friends, as also found by Borch (1994).\nSex differences\nWe found that women gave to more people at Christmas than men, which was also\nfound in a Canadian study (Fischer and Arnold, 1990). On average, the women in our study\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\npersons, which are very similar results. We also found that women spent more money on\ngifts than men, even when controlling for number of gift-giving relations. To compare,\nBorch (1998) found that women in her random Norwegian sample planned to spend less\nmoney than men. However, Borch (1998) did not control for how many people in total they\nplanned to give to. In their study of assumed gift consumption among Canadian students,\nSaad and Gill (2003) did not find any sex differences in total amount of money spent.\nHowever, the study was about gifts in general, and it did not measure actual behavior, and\nnumber of persons to which the students assumed to give, was not controlled for.\nThe extra gift-giving relations of women as compared to men were friends, which is\nconsistent with earlier findings (Argyle and Henderson, 1984; Borch, 1994; Essock-Vitale\nand McGuire, 1985). Our results are consistent with the finding that women tend to maintain\na more complex network of intimate social relationships than men (Geary, 1998; Golombok\nmotivated to develop and maintain a reciprocal and socially stable system of interpersonal\nrelationships with a relatively equal distribution of resources, whereas men are more\nconcerned with the establishment and maintenance of social dominance (Geary, 1998, p.\n242). Women tend to maintain stronger emotional ties with their contacts than do men\n(Booth, 1972), and feel more normative obligations to give gifts (Rossi and Rossi, 1990).\nMale students in our sample did not seem to use gifts as a mean to gain social\ndominance, which might have happened (competitive gift giving or giving to a large\nnetwork as a signal of wealth) according to Veblen's (1899) \"conspicuous consumption\"\nhypothesis (see also Boone, 1998). However, this could hardly be expected in a relatively\npoor student population. Moreover, in modern societies there exists a variety of means of\ndomination in which gifts may play little part (Cheal, 1988). We did not examine the sizes\nof the social networks of men and women, so it might be argued that women gave to more\npersons because they had a larger social network. This is probably not the case because\nDunbar and Spoors (1995) found that the modal network size was very similar for the two\nsexes in a British sample. In addition, Hartup and Stevens (1997) concluded in their review\nthat sex differences in network size among adults were not consistent across the relevant\nWhy did our female students give to a larger network than male students? Geary\n(1998, p. 248) argued that any such sex differences must be based on a consideration of the\nsocial groups within which our female and male ancestors likely lived. Men, unlike other\nmale primates, tend to stay in their birth group and women tend to reside in the birth group\nof their mate. Under such conditions, most men will have a social network of kin, whereas\nmost women will not. Because stable social relationships and social support are important\nfor the health and well-being of these women and their children, selection pressures may\nhave favored women who were skilled at developing and maintaining such relationships.\nAnd because these relationships would be developed with non-kin, they would require\ngreater reciprocity and equity (Geary, 1998, p. 296). Relationships with friends probably\ncannot be maintained without reciprocity and equity (Hartup and Stevens, 1997), and may\neven require higher levels of exchange than relationships with kin (Essock-Vitale and\nfor women than men may also exist because of the larger female investment in the offspring,\ncausing a greater need for all kinds of support and protection for themselves and their\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\noffspring, including protection against men (Smuts, 1995). In humans, as in chimpanzees,\ngorillas, and orangutans, female-female coalitions are relatively weak compared with those\nformed in many female-bonded primates. This tends to be the case even when women do not\ndisperse from their natal groups (Rodseth, Smuts, Harrigan and Wrangham, 1991; Rodseth,\nRucker et. al., (1991) found that males placed greater emphasis on price while\nfemales were more concerned with how much both partners liked their gifts; when gift\nexchange was between males and females, partners were less likely to report that the\nexchange was equitable. In our study, women tended to give more to their partners than men\ndid, which is consistent with some other studies (Rucker et al., 1991; Saad and Gill, 2003).\nHowever, the result is contrary to the prediction from evolutionary theory that men are\nexpected to give more than women (Buss, 1994), and also contrary to some empirical\ngenerally greater female involvement in gift giving (Cheal, 1988), and/or that women invest\nmore as a relationship stabilizes, while men invests most in the beginning as part of their\ncourtship strategy (Saad and Gill, 2003). Concerning the interaction effect for gifts to sisters,\nit was interesting to note that with age, the investment curve for sisters leveled off faster for\nmen than for women. One explanation may be due to the finding that women both talked to\nand met their sisters more than men did, even when controlling for age.\nBecause women invest more in a network of friends than men, it makes sense that it\nwas the female students who made gifts themselves in our study. This might be cheaper than\nbuying but also represents a more personal present. Apparently, the important thing is to\ngive a gift, not what is given or the expense of it, although some gifts may be judged as\ninappropriate among friends, for example money (Burgoyne and Routh, 1991; Cheal, 1987,\nWilson, 1989). We should also keep in mind that making of gifts is the old custom, which in\nour modern society has been almost abandoned by adults (B\u00f8, 1984, p. 172). Some decades\nago, most Norwegian women worked hard with finishing making of new clothes for\nChristmas, whereas today it is the group with least purchasing power (children and\nadolescents up to high school) who make the most gifts (B\u00f8, 1984), as has also been found\nelsewhere (Caplow, 1982). University students are a prolonged fork of this purchasing weak\ngroup, and female students may follow the tradition from older female relatives more than\nmen.\nReciprocity\nThe primary distinction between the nature of social relationships among kin and\nthat among friends is reciprocity (Geary, 1998, p. 182). Relationships with kin, especially\nparent-offspring relationships, are not always reciprocal, whereas long-term friendships are\ndefined by reciprocity (Hartup and Stevens, 1997; Trivers, 1974). Humans seem well\nprepared to keep track of who reciprocates and who does not in various kinds of social\nIn our study, the students gave gifts to equally as many as they received from, but the\npersons given to and received from were not always the same, because 48% gave to one or\nmore people without getting anything in return, and 42% received gifts from one or more\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\npeople without reciprocating. This would make the students inferior in this context,\nparticularly if the gifts were accepted with no thought of returning (Mauss, 1950/1990, p.\n65). Gift exchanges at Christmas time is not expected to be delayed on part of either giver or\nHowever, if we consider which kind of people these non-reciprocal relationships were\nabout, it fits nicely with one of Essock-Vitale and McGuire's (1980) predictions that kin will\nbe given more unreciprocated help than non-kin. Most of the persons who did not return\ngifts to the students were kin (genetic aunts/uncles, grandparents and first cousins), and most\nof these transactions were from the older to the younger generation (i.e. the students got\npresents from older people). Similarly, several students gave to children, who they did not\nget anything in return from.\nOnly four students did not reciprocate with giving gifts to friends they received from,\nand three to the family of cohabiting boy-/girlfriend. This fits nicely with Sahlins' (1965,\ncited by Alexander 1975) review of the anthropological literature, that the closer the kinship\nbetween the person giving the gift and the person receiving it, the less necessary it was that\nthe gift be balanced by a commensurate gift in return. Our results are also in accordance\nwith Essock-Vitale and McGuire's (1985) study of helping behavior in white, non-Hispanic,\nmiddle-class, American women. They found higher degree of reciprocity balance among\nboth the women and their friends and among the women and their husbands/husbands' kin\nthan among the women and their own kin. Contrary to this, most of the persons the students\ngave to without getting anything in return from, were friends.\nThe finding that the students gave to several persons who did not reciprocate and that\nthey gave more gifts than they received, fits recent research by Janicki (1998). She tested if\nhumans may have perceptual biases that function to take advantage of others (individual\nselfishness) or that function to maximize a person's benefits and minimize costs within\nreciprocal relationships (cooperative selfishness), and found convincing support for the\nlatter. Janicki (1998) argued that in order to maintain valuable reciprocal relationships in a\ncooperative selfishness situation, individuals could be motivated to maintain their share of\nreciprocating and to feel guilty if they do not. Reciprocating others seemed to be more\nimportant than not being reciprocated and not reciprocating more upsetting than not being\nreciprocated. One reasonable explanation is that not reciprocating can damage a relationship,\nleading to the cessation of future benefits (Janicki, 1998). Another reasonable explanation is\nthat not reciprocating can damage one's reputation as an exchange partner (Alexander, 1987;\nJanicki, 1998). Reciprocating others may also help avoiding indebtedness (Janicki, 1998).\nThe importance of giving more than one receives, thus acquiring a reputation of generosity,\nhas also been recognized by anthropologists (Carrier, 1987; Chiaramonte, 1970), and it does\nnot seem that people gain materially in the future in these exchanges.\nBirth order\nWe found clear effects of birth order for several response variables, and birth order\nwas one of the most important predictor variables. Our results therefore support the general\nbirth order seems to be an important parameter for determining personality. Firstborn\nstudents spent more on average on each gift-giving relation than laterborn students, and\nfirstborns gave more to their parents, brothers (but not sisters) and grandparents than\nGift giving in modern Norwegian society\nlaterborns. This fits Sulloway's (1996) thesis that firstborns identify more strongly with\nparents and with authority (including grandparents). This identification shapes their\npersonalities in formative early years, which seems to be reflected in their gift investments\nlater in life. In addition, firstborns were found to have more contact with their fathers than\nlaterborns, but lastborns had more contact with mothers than both first- and middleborns.\nWhen controlling for how often the students met their mothers and fathers, firstborns still\ngave more than laterborns.\nFirstborns gave more even to brothers, which may at first seem conflicting, but it can\nbe due to firstborns being more family-centered (Salmon and Daly, 1998) and influenced by\nkin ties (Salmon, 1998) than laterborns, especially middleborns. Note that consistent with\nthis middleborns actually met their parents least often. We also found that firstborns\nreceived more from their brothers than laterborns, and can therefore not decide if they give\nmore because they receive more or vice versa (but these findings did not come from paired\ntests). We have no good explanation as to why firstborns gave more to brothers, but not to\nsisters (actually firstborns got more from sisters, but again, we could not use paired tests).\nPerhaps it is due to our small sample size. A higher proportion of firstborns gave to relatives\noutside the nuclear family and grandparents (namely to aunts), which might also be due to\nfirstborns being more family-centered and influenced by kin ties than laterborns (Salmon\n1998; Salmon and Daly 1998). When controlling for number of male friends given to, it was\nfound that middleborns gave for more to each of their male friends than both firstborns and\nlastborns. This fits with previous research (Salmon and Daly, 1998) where middleborns'\nreduced closeness to parents (Kennedy, 1989) was made up by greater expressed closeness\nto both unrelated friends and siblings. However, we did not find any birth-order effects for\ngifts to female friends.\nA higher proportion of middleborns preferred to let someone else buy/make at least\none of their gifts. Also in this respect, middleborns seem different (cf. Kennedy, 1989;\nmiddleborns are less family-centered (Salmon and Daly, 1998) or less influenced by kin ties\n(Salmon, 1998) than both firstborns and lastborns, with less likelihood of indicating having a\nclose relationship with their parents (Kennedy, 1989): Christmas is a celebration with the\nclose family at its center, and middleborns may be less motivated to take part in the\ncelebration than first- and lastborns.\n"
