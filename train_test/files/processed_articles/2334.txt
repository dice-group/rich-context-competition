To examine the association between age at first alcohol use and risk of heavy alcohol use among the adult US general drinking\npopulation. Methods. This population-based study used the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from United\nStates. Multivariate Poisson regression was employed to predict the frequency of heavy alcohol use (five or more drinks per\noccasion) in the last 30 days with age at first use of alcohol controlling for potential confounding factors. Results. Younger age at\nfirst use of alcohol was associated with increased likelihood of heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days in this population-based sample.\nThis association remained significant when analysis was reperformed for the subgroup of participants who were with desired good\nhealth status and Kessler score lower than 12. Conclusion. Younger age at first use of alcohol was associated with increased likelihood\nof heavy alcohol use.\n1. Introduction\nSeveral studies have suggested that people who start drinking\nat a younger age have an increased risk of alcohol use\ndisorders [1\u00ad6]. It has been hypothesized that the interactions\namong genetic and environmental factors play an important\nrole in this observed association; however, the underlying\ncausal mechanism is not fully understood [6]. Our recent\nanalysis of data collected by the Australian National Drug\nStrategy Household Survey showed that age at first use was\nassociated with a higher level of subsequent alcohol use\namong the general Australian population [7]. This association\nremained significant even after the analysis was limited to\nthe population who had good (i.e., \"desired\") health status\nand low psychological distress [7]. To determine whether\nthis observation is specific to the Australian population\nor generalizable, it is important to further investigate the\nrelationship between early onset of alcohol use and heavy\nalcohol use in other populations. If early onset of alcohol\nuse independently (i.e., independent of other socioeconomic\nand environmental risk factors) leads to heavy drinking\nbehaviours, then it may be postulated that, to some extent,\nearly alcohol use causes alcohol use disorders by increasing\nthe frequency of heavy alcohol use. In this study, we aimed to\nexamine the association between age at first alcohol use and\nrisk of heavy alcohol use among the adult US general drinking\npopulation.\nDetails of sampling strategy and data collection methods\nhave been described in the 2010 National Survey on Drug\nUse and Health (NSDUH) report [8, 9]. Briefly, the NSDUH\nis a national survey targeting the 12-year and older non-\ninstitutionalized population of the United States. The 2010\nsurvey used computer-assisted face-to-face interviews to\ncollect drug use information and demographic information\nfrom respondents. In order to produce both national and\nstate level estimates, multistage stratification and randomiza-\ntion combined sampling method was used [8]. In the 2010\nNSDUH, participants were asked detailed questions about\ntheir alcohol use, including age at first use of alcohol. The\noriginal question was: \"Think about the first time you had a\ndrink of an alcoholic beverage. How old were you the first\ntime you had a drink of an alcoholic beverage? Please do\n2  \nTable 1: Prevalence of heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days by age at first use of alcohol.\nAge at first use of alcohol\nMale Female\nHeavy alcohol use over the last 30 days Heavy alcohol use over the last 30 days\nNo Yes % Yes No Yes % Yes\nnot include any time when you only had a sip or two from\na drink.\" In the 2010 NSDUH, a \"drink\" was defined as \"a can\nor bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of\nliquor, or a mixed drink with liquor in it.\" Participants were\nalso asked about the frequency of heavy alcohol use over the\nlast month. Heavy alcohol use was defined as consuming 5\nor more drinks on the same occasion. The original question\nasked in the survey was: \"During the past 30 days, that is since\n(the date 30 days before the interview), on how many days did\nyou have 5 or more drinks on the same occasion? By occasion,\nwe mean at the same time or within a couple of hours of each\nother\" [8]. In this study, we investigated whether age at first\nuse of alcohol predicted frequency of heavy alcohol (in the\nlast 30 days) at older ages.\n2.1. Data Analysis. Multivariate Poisson regression was\nemployed to predict the frequency of heavy alcohol use (more\nthan 5 drinks per occasion) in the last 30 days with age at first\nuse of alcohol. Potential confounding factors, including cur-\nrent age, gender, level of achieved education, income, marital\nstatus, general health status, and psychological distress level\nin the last 30 days, were controlled in the model. Sampling\nweight provided in the dataset was applied in the analysis.\nThe analysis was first performed with all adult participants\n(age 18) who consumed alcohol in the last 12 months. There\nsurvey and who had consumed alcohol in the last twelve\nmonths. Less than 3% of these participants did not provide\nnecessary information on the dependent variables or some\nof the independent variables and therefore were excluded\nfrom the multivariate analysis. Given that heavy alcohol use\nwas more prevalent among young adults, the analysis was\nAs noted in our previous study using an Australian\nsample, physical and mental morbidities may influence the\nrelationship between age at first use of alcohol and frequency\nof heavy alcohol use [7]. The 2010 NSDUH included the\nKessler 6 scale and a question on general health [8]. The\nKessler 6 scale is a sensitive measure of the existence of\nnonspecific mental conditions. A score of 0\u00ad12 indicates low\nrisk of a mental health condition being present [10\u00ad12]. Self-\nreported health status with five categories (excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, and poor) was used as the indicator of health\nin the survey. Self-reported health status has also been shown\nto be a valid and reliable measurement of general health and\nhas been repeatedly used in the NSDUH and other national\nsurveys [13\u00ad15]. Limiting the sample to those with a low\nKessler score and good self-rated health status substantially\nreduces the likelihood that any observed association will be\ninfluenced by the presence of physical or mental disorders [7,\n14, 16\u00ad18]. We therefore repeated the analysis on a subsample\nlimited to those with Kessler scores of 12 or less and with a\nself-rating of health that was good, very good, or excellent.\nIn order to further control for residual confounding\neffects, a proxy outcome (number of days smoked in the\nlast 30 days) was used to estimate the effects of residual\nconfounding effects. A similar approach has been used to\nexamine the \"protective\" effect of moderate alcohol use [16,\n17]. This was achieved by using number of days smoked in\nthe last 30 days as the outcome variable instead of frequency\n  3\nTable 2: Estimates from Poisson regression model.\nIRR (95% conf. interval)\nGender\nAge at first use of alcohol\nCurrent age\nHighest education level attained\nTotal family income\nSelf-rated health status\nKessler score\nMarital status\nLanguage used in the survey\nIRR: incidence rate ratios.\nof heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days, while keeping all the\ncontrolled variables unchanged. Participants included those\naged 18 years at the time of the survey who had consumed\nalcohol in the last twelve months. This approach operates on\nthe basis that alcohol use and tobacco use share a similar\nset of confounders [19\u00ad23]. We also assume that any causal\nrelationship between age at first use of alcohol and tobacco at\nolder ages is weaker than age at first use of alcohol and future\nheavy alcohol use. Any observed effects of age at first use on\ntobacco use were thus controlled for in the final model.\n3. Results\nFrom the univariate analysis, it was observed that the preva-\nlence of consuming more than 5 drinks on the same occasion\nat least once in the last 30 days was significantly higher among\nparticipants who started consuming alcohol before the age\nof 18 years among both males and females.

Discussion\nIn this study, we investigated the association between age at\nfirst use of alcohol and current alcohol consumption using\nUS data from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and\nHealth. Younger age at first use of alcohol was associated with\nincreased likelihood of heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days\nin this population-based sample. This association was not\ndependent on level of psychological distress and health status.\nThe findings of this study are consistent with the findings\nfrom a previous study of Australia's population [7]. This also\nsuggests that the association between early onset of alcohol\nuse and heavy alcohol consumption in later life cannot\nbe fully explained by concurrent negative socioeconomic\nand environmental factors that usually influence the risk of\n4  \nTable 3: Association between age at first use of alcohol and likelihood of heavy alcohol use in the last 30 days among subsample with low\nKessler score and good, very good, or excellent self-rated physical health.\nAge at first use of alcohol IRR (95% conf. interval) IRR (95% conf. interval)\nIRR: incidence rate ratios.\nModels controlled for all variables showed in Table 2.\nEstimations from subsample with Kessler scores of 12 or less and a self-rating of health as good, very good, or excellent.\nphysical diseases and mental disorders including alcohol use\nThe causal mechanism underlying this observed associ-\nation is not fully understood. It is plausible that starting to\nuse alcohol before the age of 18 years directly increases the\nrisk of developing heavy alcohol use behaviours. The risk\nof developing habitual heavy alcohol use before the age of\n18 years is nil for a person who starts drinking after the\nage of 18 years. However, in keeping with the relatively high\nprevalence of frequent heavy alcohol use among adolescents,\nthe risk well exceeds zero for a person who starts drinking\nbefore the age of 18 years [26, 27]. In addition, compared to\nadults, adolescents are more likely to engage in sensation-\nseeking and risk-taking behaviours [9, 16]; therefore given\naccess to alcohol, the risk of frequent heavy alcohol use\nmay be higher in adolescence than in adulthood. It is\nnevertheless important that parental attitudes and behaviours\nduring their children's initial exposure to alcohol may have\nsubstantial effects on their future consumption patterns\nThe causal relationship between heavy alcohol use and\nalcohol use disorders is clear as heavy alcohol use is a\nnecessary condition for the development of any alcohol use\ndisorder; it follows therefore that increased risk of heavy\nalcohol use will further increase the risk of alcohol use\ndisorders. Onset of alcohol use before the age of 18 years\nwould therefore increase the risk of alcohol use disorders.\nAbstinence from alcohol until the age of 18 years will\nreduce the risk of alcohol-related harm. These findings\nare closely relevant to legislations on minimum drinking\nage.\n5. Conclusion\nYounger age at first use of alcohol was associated with\nincreased likelihood of heavy alcohol use.\n"
