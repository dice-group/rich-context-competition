More than 2 million\nyouth in the United States (1 in 33) have been directly assaulted in incidents where the high\nlethality risk weapons of guns and knives were used. Differences were noted between\nvictimizations involving higher and lower lethality risk weapons as well as between any\nweapon involvement versus none. Poly-victims, youth with 7 or more victimization types,\nwere particularly likely to experience victimization with any weapon, as well as victimization\nwith a highly lethal weapon compared with nonpoly-victims.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings add to the field's broadening conceptualization of youth victimization\nhighlighting the potentially highly consequential risk factor of weapon exposure as\na component of victimization experiences on the mental health of youth.

Despite its relevance\nto public health, extant research on\nyouth firearm exposure has focused\non weapon carrying as the primary\nfocus of exposure.3\u00ad10 However, youth\nare also exposed to firearms and\nother weapons through direct\nvictimization and witnessing violence;\nunderstanding how often and in what\nways this occurs is critical to the\nfield's broadening conceptualization\nof youth victimization.\nPrevious research reveals that\ncumulative exposures to\nvictimization and other adversities\nlead to problematic developmental\noutcomes. In our research, a key\nconcept that has emerged is that of\nthe \"poly-victim,\" youth who suffer\na disproportionate quantity of\nserious victimization and a much\ngreater array and intensity of\nrelationship between the\naccumulation of victimization types\nand the level of adverse outcomes.15\nVictimization involving a weapon\nmay make particularly salient or\ntraumatizing contributions to the\npattern; there is a need to better\nunderstand how weapon\ninvolvement may be linked to poly-\nvictimization.\nUsing data from a national sample of\nyouth, ages 2 to 17 in the United\nStates, we examine the prevalence of\nweapons involved in the victimization\nof youth with particular emphasis on\nweapons with a \"high lethality risk\"\nand how such exposure may\nexacerbate the broader victimization\nand life experiences of children and\nadolescents. We use the term\n\"lethality\" to separate out weapons\nthat have a higher likelihood of\nlethality (ie, guns, knives) from those\nwith less likelihood of lethality (eg,\nsticks).\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThe Second National Survey of\nChildren's Exposure to Violence\n(NatSCEV II) consists of a national\nages 1 month to 17 years of age in\nthe subsample of youth ages 2 to\nProcedure\nA short interview was conducted\nover the telephone with an adult\ncaregiver to obtain family\ndemographic information. One child\nwas then randomly selected from all\neligible children living in\na household by selecting the child\nwith the most recent birthday. If the\nold, the main telephone interview\nwas conducted with the child. If the\nselected child was younger than age\n10, the interview was conducted\nwith the caregiver who \"is most\nfamiliar with the child's daily routine\nand experiences.\" Interviewers\nobtained verbal consent from the\ncaregiver for the child as well as\nverbal assent from the child before\nbeginning the interview. A number of\nsteps were taken to make sure that\nrespondents' confidentiality was\nmaintained.\nRespondents were paid $20 for their\nparticipation. The interviews,\naveraging 55 minutes in length, were\nconducted in either English or\nSpanish. The cooperation and\nresponse rates averaged across\ncollection modalities were 60% and\n40%, respectively. All procedures\nwere authorized by the Institutional\nReview Board of the University of\nNew Hampshire. Further details\nabout aspects of the methodology are\navailable from the authors or detailed\nMeasurement\nDemographics\nDemographic information was\nobtained in the initial caretaker\ninterview, including the child's\ngender, age, race/ethnicity, and\nsocioeconomic status (SES). SES is\na composite based on the sum of the\nstandardized household income and\nstandardized parental education (for\nthe parent with the highest\neducation) scores, which was then\nrestandardized. Family structure,\ndefined by the composition of the\nhousehold, was categorized into 4\ngroups: children living with (a) 2\nbiological or adoptive parents, (b) 1\nbiological parent plus partner\n(spouse or nonspouse), (c) single\nbiological parent, and (d) other\nnonparent caregiver.\nVictimization\nVictimization was measured by using\nthe Juvenile Victimization\nQuestionnaire a comprehensive\ninventory of childhood victimization\ndescribed in detail elsewhere.17\nChildren who had been exposed to\nparticularly large numbers of\ndifferent kinds of victimizations were\ndesignated as poly-victims,\ncomprising the 10% of children who\nhad experienced the highest number\nof victimizations. Past year poly-\nvictims were defined as having\nexperienced 7 or more types of\nvictimization in the past year.\nWeapon Involvement\nUsing information from the Juvenile\nVictimization Questionnaire follow-up\nquestions, victimization types were\nfurther classified by whether the\nincident involved a weapon (gun,\nknife, stick, rock, bottle, tool, or other\nitem that could cause injury such as\na piece of broken glass, piece of metal\nor brass knuckles).\nExperience\nPast year adversity due to nonviolent\ntraumatic events and chronic\nstressors were measured by using 15\nitems, 13 of which were taken from\nand 2 of which were constructed for\nthis study. Nonviolent traumatic\nevents included serious illnesses,\naccidents, and parental\nimprisonment, and chronic stressors\nincluded substance abuse by family\nmembers and homelessness. Mental\nhealth status was measured through\nthe use of trauma symptom scores for\nthe anger, depression, and anxiety\nscales of 2 closely related measures:\nthe Trauma Symptoms Checklist for\nChildren,20 which was used with the\ninterviews, and the Trauma Symptom\nChecklist for Young Children,21\nused in the caregiver interviews for\nthe 2- to 9-year-olds.\nWeaponized Environment\nExposure to gangs and peer weapon\ncarrying were measured by using 3 of\n10 items from the Community\nDisorder Questionnaire,22 which is\nintended to capture signs of elevated\nrisk for crime and violence, such as\ndrug deals and obvious signs of gang\npresence, or the aftereffects of crime,\nsuch as arrests and police raids.\nRespondents were asked if each\ncommunity disorder indicator had\nhappened in the past year. Exposure\nto gangs was indicated if the\nrespondent indicated they had either\nlived in a neighborhood where there\nwere gangs or ever seen graffiti in\ntheir neighborhood that had gang\nsigns or warnings. Peer weapon\ncarrying was indicated if the\nrespondent responded positively to\nthe following question: \"Have you\never gone to a school where a kid\nbrought a gun or knife to school?\"\nPast year personal weapon carrying\nwas measured by using an adapted\nitem developed by Loeber and\nIncident-Level Characteristics\nInformation from other follow-up\nquestions was used to construct\nvariables that capture additional\nincident characteristics. Specifically\nwe queried about: injury (\"Were you\n[your child] physically hurt when this\nhappened?\" Hurt means you could\nstill feel pain in your body the next\nday); location of the victimization\n(coded as home [1 = yes, 0 = no] or\nschool [1, 0]); relationship to the\nperpetrator (coded as juvenile peer\n[1, 0], juvenile sibling [1, 0], or parent\n[1, 0]); and impact: respondents were\nasked whether they missed school\nbecause of the incident or whether\nthey felt afraid (not at all/a little\nafraid versus very afraid) when the\nincident occurred.\nSample Weighting\nNatSCEV II used a multiframe design\nconsisting of 4 overlapping frames:\na landline random digit dial frame,\na cell phone random digit dial frame,\nan address-based sample frame, and\na list-assisted sample of prescreened\nhouseholds known to have children.\nTo ensure that the estimates derived\nfrom the combined frames were\nrepresentative of the target\npopulation of children in the United\nStates aged 17 and younger, a 4-step\nprocess, detailed elsewhere,16 was\nused to construct the analysis\nweights.\nData Analysis\nMost analyses in this study were\nconducted by using the child as the\nunit of analysis and examine the\ncharacteristics and associated\noutcomes of children's victimization\nexperience based on (a) any weapon\nversus none and (b) high lethality\n(gun or knife) versus low lethality\n(eg, sticks, rocks). Specifically, a series\nof cross-tabulations were conducted\ncomparing youth demographic\ncharacteristics (eg, gender, age) and\nyouth experience (eg, past year poly-\nvictim, high life adversity, trauma) by\nreport of any lifetime victimization\nwith a weapon with design-based\nF statistics reported for dichotomous\nand categorical variables and\nunadjusted odds ratios and 95%\nconfidence intervals for continuous\nvariables. Then, among all youth who\nreported victimization with a weapon,\nwe conducted the same cross-\ntabulations by whether the weapon\ninvolved was low versus high\nlethality risk.\nWe next examined the relationship\nbetween victimization with a weapon\non mental health symptomatology;\nwe did this separately for younger\nyouth given critical developmental\ndifferences and the different\ninformants for the 2 age groups.\nSpecifically, we conducted a series of\n6 linear regression analyses (3 mental\nhealth outcomes 3 2 age groups);\nstandardized regression coefficients\nare presented. The models take into\naccount poly-victim status and child\ndemographic characteristics.\nTo assess the impact of weapon\ninvolvement on outcomes, an incident\nlevel file was also created where\nvictimized children had separate\nrecords for each reported incident of\nlifetime victimization. Analyses\nconducted on the incident level file\nwere adjusted for nonindependence\nof incidents experienced by the same\nchild by calculating robust standard\nerrors. A series of cross-tabulations\ncompared various incident\ncharacteristics (eg, location of\nincident, relationship to perpetrator)\nby (a) any weapon involvement or not\nand (b) low versus high lethality risk\nweapon involvement.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the Sample\nFifty-one percent of youth were boys\n(Table 1). For approximately half of\nthe youth, data were collected by\nproxy from a caregiver (28.5% ages\n(24.1%) of respondents were ages\nSES households; 17.6% lived in high\nSES households. Slightly more than\nhalf (56.7%) of youth were white, non-\nLatino; 18.8% were Latino (any race);\n15.1% were black, non-Latino; and\n9.4% were of another non-Latino race.\nFifty-six percent of youth lived with\nboth biological parents.\nExperiencing Victimization With\na Weapon: Lifetime Prevalence and\nYouth Characteristics\nreported at least 1 victimization that\ninvolved a weapon in their lifetime,\nsuch as a knife, gun, stick, or rock;\nvictimization with a weapon, and\nwitnessed) victimization with\na weapon. Any victimization with\na weapon was more common among\nincreased with age, and was reported\nmore frequently by youth living in\nlow socioeconomic households, black\nor Latino youth, as well as those who\nlived in nontraditional families (eg,\nother adult caregiver, parent, and\nstep-parent; Table 2).\nIn terms of youth experience, youth\nreporting a weapon-involved\nvictimization were more likely to be\nclassified as a poly-victim in the past\nyear, experience high amounts of life\nadversity in the past year, and high\ntrauma symptoms in the past month\n(Table 2). They were also more likely\nto be exposed to a \"weaponized\nenvironment\": they reported more\npast year gang exposure, peer\nweapon carrying, and more personal\nweapon carrying (for youth ages\nVictimization With a High Lethality\nRisk Weapon: Lifetime Prevalence\nand Youth Characteristics\n3.1% of all youth reported\na victimization with a highly lethal\nweapon (ie, gun or knife) in their\nlifetimes; 0.9% reported at least 1\ndirect victimization, and 2.4% at least\n1 indirect victimization with such\na weapon. Report of any victimization\ninvolving a high lethality risk weapon\ndid not differ by gender but did\nincrease by age (Table 2). Compared\nwith all other youth, youth living in\nnontraditional families were more\nlikely to report such victimization,\nparticularly those with some other\ncaregiver besides a parent (eg, other\nrelatives, foster parents). Poly-\nvictims, youth with high trauma\nsymptoms, those who had peers who\ncarried weapons, and who personally\ncarried a weapon were more likely\nthan all other youth to report\na victimization involving a high\nlethality risk weapon.\nDoes Weapon-Involved Victimization\nIntensify Harm Beyond Poly-Victim\nStatus?\nPast year poly-victim status was\na significant contributor to mental\nhealth symptomatology for all\nsymptoms except anxiety among the\nyounger children (Table 3). Reports\nof any lifetime weapon-involved\nvictimization was significantly related\nto all mental health symptoms over\nand above the contribution of poly-\nvictimization. This was true for each\nage group. All findings adjust for the\nfollowing youth demographic\ncharacteristics: age, gender, race and\nethnicity, SES, and family structure.\nIncident-Level Characteristics and\nOutcomes\nIn Table 4, we report incident level\ncharacteristics for all youth (analyses\nwere run separately for younger\nyouth with similar findings--not\nshown in Table): Weapon-involved\nincidents were more likely to be part\nof an indirect only victimization or\nan incident that involved both direct\nand indirect forms of victimization\n(rather than direct only). Weapon-\ninvolved victimizations were more\nlikely to be perpetrated by a peer,\nand result in injury. A few differences\nwere noted when comparing low\nversus high lethality weapon\ninvolvement: More indirect only\nweapon-involved victimizations\ninvolved a high lethality weapon.\nFewer of the incidents perpetrated\nby siblings involved guns or knives;\nmore of those victimizations\nperpetrated by a caregiver involved\nsuch weapons.\nDISCUSSION\nNatSCEV II estimates indicate that\n.17.5 million youth in the United\nStates have been exposed to violence\ninvolving a weapon in their lifetimes\nas witnesses or direct victims, or .1\nin 4 children. More than 2 million\nyouth in the United States have been\ndirectly assaulted in incidents where\nthe high lethality risk weapons of\nguns or knives were used. Weapons-\nbased violence is 1 of the largest\npublic health crises affecting\nchildren in the United States, far\nexceeding the numbers of children\nwith illnesses such as diabetes or\ncancer. Despite its relevance to\npublic health, however, there is still\nmuch we do not know about youth\nweapon exposure and firearm\nexposure in particular. For example,\nfirearm factors may play into the\nvictimization accumulation cycle in\nvarious, yet undetermined, ways.\nNegative firearm exposures, for\nexample, may make particularly\nsalient or traumatizing\nTABLE 1 Characteristics of NatSCEV II\nAnalytical Sample, Ages 2 to 17\nChild Characteristic No. (%)\nChild gender\nChild age\nRace and ethnicity\nFamily structure\nPercentages are weighted.

Firearm\nfascination, acquisition, and carrying\nmay be a response among highly\nexposed children and youth, which\nmay in turn aggravate the cycle.\nPositive firearm experiences, on the\nother hand, for some youth may\nmoderate or buffer the effects of\nvictimization exposure. Findings\nfrom the current study suggest the\nneed for a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the range of\nfirearm exposures for youth and the\ncontexts that increase risk of harm\nand victimization.\nTABLE 2 Victimization With Any Weapon Involvement and High Lethality Risk Weapons Among All Youth, Ages 2 to 17\nYouth Characteristic No. Youth,\nAny Victimization With\nDesign-based F or\nHigh Lethality Risk\nDesign-based F or\nDemographic characteristic\nChild gender\nChild age\nSES\nRace and ethnicity\nFamily structure\nExperience\nHigh adversity (PY)\nHigh trauma symptoms (PM)\nWeaponized environment\nGang exposure (PY)c\nPeer weapon carrying (PY)c\nPersonal weapon carryingd\nPercentages are weighted. Ns are unweighted. Numbers and percentages reflect row totals. Comparison group is all other youth for all analyses. CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio;\na The weapon follow-up question was asked about both direct victimizations (eg, assault), as well as indirect victimizations (eg, witnessing domestic violence). The weapon question was\nasked only once per incident even when more than 1 victimization type was part of a single incident, and it was always asked about the first item reported for that incident. In the survey\norder, direct victimization questions were asked before indirect ones. Thus, if an incident involved both direct and indirect victimization types, the weapon follow-up would refer to the\ndirect victimization involved. Only a very small proportion of incidents (3%) involved both direct and indirect victimization types. Among direct victimizations, assault questions with the\nweapon follow-up mostly preceded nonassault ones for which the weapon question was not asked. However, it is possible that weapon use could be slightly understated in rare\ncombinations of victimization types. For example, if a nonassault victimization such as vandalism was the first 1 reported in an incident during which an assault also occurred, the\nweapon victimization question would not have been asked about the assault victimization because it is not asked after the vandalism question.\nb Adjusted for youth age, gender, race and ethnicity, SES, and family structure.\nDifferences were noted between\nvictimizations involving higher\nlethality risk weapons but also\nwhether any type of weapon was\ninvolved (versus none). Indeed,\nelevated rates of poly-victimization,\ntrauma symptoms, peer weapon\ncarrying, and personal weapon\ncarrying are noted with weapon-\ninvolved victimization regardless\nof the type of weapon. It could be\nthat the use or threat of a weapon\nis such a startling and troubling\nevent that the specific type does\nnot matter as much. More\ninformation is needed about the\ncontexts within which the\nvictimization occurs before we can\nfully understand any nuances\nassociated with specific weapon\ntypes at the incident level.\nAlthough more weapon-involved\nvictimization, both generally and\nthose with high lethality risk are\nindirect in nature, fear data reveal\nthat witnessing is often more\nfrightening to children24 and\nprevious analyses on poly-victims\nreveal direct and indirect forms of\nvictimization carry the same\nweight in terms of harm.25 Clearly\nall types of victimization that\ninvolve a weapon should not be\ntaken lightly, due to both their\nenhanced risk for physical injury\nand elevated trauma symptoms.\nEven when a weapon is not used,\ntheir mere presence greatly\nincreases the risk of injury and\nthreat and may exacerbate trauma\nsymptoms.\nThe classification of poly-victim\nproved to be strongly associated\nwith the risk of weapon violence\nexposure, providing further\nindication of the need to do more to\nidentify those youth who\nexperience the greatest burden of\nvictimization; poly-victims were\nparticularly likely to experience\nvictimization with any weapon, as\nwell as victimization with a highly\nlethal weapon compared with\nnonpoly-victims. Further, weapon\ninvolvement increases trauma over\nand above poly-victimization.\nFindings add to the field's\nbroadening conceptualization of\nyouth victimization highlighting the\npotentially highly consequential\nrisk factor of weapon exposure as\na component of victimization\nexperiences on the mental health of\nyouth.\nBeyond victimization, youth living in\nwhat we are calling weaponized\nenvironments are more likely to\nreport victimization with a weapon:\nYouth exposed to gangs are twice as\nlikely as those who are not to report\nweapon-involved victimization. Peer\nweapon carrying was a salient factor\nrelated to any weapon and high\nlethality risk weapon-involved\nvictimizations. The same was true for\npersonal weapon carrying. Findings\nsuggest some direction for\npromoting youth safety. Youth who\nstay away from gangs and peers who\ncarry weapons are less likely to\nexperience a weapon-involved\nvictimization. Yet, at the individual\nlevel, youth in some high-crime\ncommunities may have difficulty\navoiding such individuals pointing to\nthe importance of a public health\napproach to this problem and\nlooking for community-level and\npolicy solutions to reduce exposure\nto weapons and highly weaponized\nenvironments.\nWe recognize that some findings may\nbe influenced by unmeasured\ndimensions, such as a greater\nwillingness among some\nrespondents to disclose personal\nexperiences. We take multiple steps\nto reduce these issues through\nsurvey design and through\ninterviewer training to make sure\nyouth are in a private, safe place\nwhile answering questions. Concern\nis also often expressed about the\ndegree to which caregivers know\nabout or are willing to disclose\nvictimizations concerning their\nchildren, especially child\nmaltreatment. But comparison of the\ncaregiver and youth reports in\na similar survey using the same\nmeasures did not suggest\nTABLE 3 Effects of Victimization With Weapon (Lifetime) and Poly-victim Status on Depression, Anxiety and Anger/Aggression by Age: Standardized\nRegression Coefficients\nDepression Anxiety Anger/Aggression Depression Anxiety Anger/Aggression\nVictimization details\nChild demographics\na differential underreporting by\ncaregivers, even maltreatment.17\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data indicate that children are\nexposed to weapon-involved\nvictimization at disturbingly high\nrates, affecting 1 in 4 children when\na full range of weapons is included.\nIn comparison with some other\nserious concerns in our data, the\nrates of exposure to weapon violence\nis higher than the rates of suicidal\nideation, sexual victimization, and\ncaregiver maltreatment, for example.\nFurther, high lethality risk weapon\nviolence has a unique contribution to\ncurrent trauma symptoms over that\nof poly-victim status, indicating that\nit should be a focus of particular\nconcern. This is all the more\nnoteworthy because our past\nresearch with this and 2 previous\nnational samples indicates that many\nother victimization characteristics do\nnot make a unique contribution to\ntrauma symptoms above and beyond\nthe very large effect for poly-\nvictimization. Any child who is\nknown to have experienced\nvictimization should be screened for\nexposure to weapon violence.\nFurther work on improving gun\nsafety practices and taking steps to\nreduce children's exposure to\nweapon-involved violence is\nwarranted to reduce this prevalent\nproblem.\nABBREVIATIONS\nNatSCEV II: Second National\nSurvey of Children's\nExposure to Violence\nSES: socioeconomic status\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: The authors have indicated they have no financial relationships relevant to this article to disclose.\nFUNDING: Supported by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010-JF-FX-0001).\nPOTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: The authors have indicated they have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.\nTABLE 4 Incident Characteristics by Any Weapon Involvement and by Degree of Weapon Lethality Risk Among Youth, Ages 2 to 17, Experiencing at Least 1\nIncident Characteristic Lifetime Victimization Incidents Lifetime Incidents With a Weapon\nNo. Incidents,\nIncidents With Weapon,\nDesign-\nbased F\nNo. Incidents,\nIncidents With High Lethality Risk Weapon,\nDesign-\nbased F\nType of victimization\nIncident occurred at home\nIncident occurred at school\nPerpetrator was juvenile peer\nPerpetrator was juvenile sibling\nPerpetrator was parent/caregiver\nInjury resulted\nYouth was very afraid from incident\nYouth missed school from incident\nPercentages are weighted.
