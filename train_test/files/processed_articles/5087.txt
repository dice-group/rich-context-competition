Pain, disability (Oswestry Disability Index, ODI), static and dynamic muscle\nendurance, and health-related quality-of-life (short form-36, SF-36) were assessed at baseline and\nafter completion of treatment.\nResults: At the end of the 12-week intervention period, pain, disability, SF-36 physical component\nand SF-36 mental component were significantly better in the health education group (n \u00bc 25) than\nin the control group (n \u00bc 24). There were no significant between-group differences in static or\ndynamic endurance.\nConclusion: Health education provides additional benefits to exercise alone for improving pain,\ndisability and mental and physical health-related quality-of-life.\n",

Patients\nyears and havelow back pain (with or without\nradiating pain to the lower extremity) of !3\nmonths' duration. Exclusion criteria were: (i)\nvisual analogue scale (VAS) pain score >8 (0,\nno pain; 10, worst pain); (ii) previous partici-\npation in a health education programme; (iii)\nprevious spinal surgery; (iv) acute infection,\nprogressive neurological deficit, structural\nanomaly, severe instability, severe cardiovas-\ncular or metabolic disease. All patients\ncompleted a questionnaire prior to random-\nization,whichcollectedinformationincluding\nbasic demographic data, medical history,\nexercise habits (frequency and time/session),\nand past and present job status. Participants\nwere allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to either the\nhealth education group or the control group\nby computer-generated random number\nsequence.\nThe Ethics Committee of Hohai\nUniversity, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province,\nChina approved the study and all patients\nprovided written informed consent prior to\nenrolment.\nIntervention\nAll patients performed lumbar strengthen-\ning exercises three times a week (40 min each\nsession) for 12 weeks, focusing on trunk\nflexor and extensor muscles.4 Exercise pro-\ngrammes were led by registered physical\ntherapists. Each session included: (i) 5-min\nwarm-up; (ii) 15-min trunk flexor strength\nexercises, including straight leg raises and\nsit-ups with foot fixation; (iii) 15-min trunk\nextensor strength exercises, including prone\ntrunk extensions; (iv) 5-min cool-down.\nPatients in the health education group\nunderwent education sessions once a week\nfor 12 weeks. Sessions included a lecture\n(30 min) followed by discussion (10 min),\nand information was delivered by videos,\ncomputer presentations and instruction leaf-\nlets. Content included active management\nand postural hygiene, such as avoiding risk\nfactors for back problems, safe lifting prac-\ntices at home and work, and correct postures\nfor decreasing back muscle tension and\nspinal load.\nOutcome measures\nOutcome measures were assessed at baseline\nand at the end of the 12-week intervention\nprogramme by an investigator who was\nblinded to group allocation (L. W.)\nOutcome measures included: (i) pain inten-\nsity (VAS)11; (ii) Oswestry Disability Index\n(ODI); higher values indicate more severe\ndisability12; (iii) static muscle endurance13\n(length of time (in s) that the patient could\nhold their unsupported upper body in the\nprone [trunk extensors] and supine [trunk\nflexors] positions); (iv) dynamic muscle\nendurance4 (number of curl-ups [trunk flex-\nors] and prone trunk extensions [trunk\nextensors] performed in 1 min, to a max-\nimum of 25); (v) health-related quality-of-\nhigher scores indicate better quality-of-life).\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean\u00c6 SD. Between-\ngroup comparisons of baseline data were\nmade using 2-test or independent samples t-\ntest. Treatment effects were evaluated using\ntwo-way analysis of variance (group \u00c2 time).\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nMicrosoft Office Excel\u00d5 2007 software and\nSPSS\u00d5 version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values <0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study recruited 60 patients.

There were no statistically signifi-\ncant between-group differences in static or\ndynamic muscle endurance.\nDiscussion\nThis randomized, controlled study com-\npared health education plus exercise with\nexercise alone for the treatment of chronic\nlow back pain, and found that health edu-\ncation provided additional benefits in terms\nof pain severity, disability and physical and\nmental health-related quality-of-life com-\npared with exercise alone.\nThe added value of health education\nremains unclear. Some studies found health\neducation can reduce pain15 and absence\nfrom work,16 but a critical review of nine\nrandomized controlled clinical trials found\nno effect of education on preventing low\nback pain.10 The findings of the present\nstudy indicate that health education inter-\nvention is effective for improving pain and\ndisability in patients with chronic low back\npain. This may be accomplished by the\neducational goals of reducing anxiety and\nencouraging patients to self-manage their\npain actively. The short duration of the\neducation programme may explain the lack\nof significant between-group differences in\nTable 1.

It is\npossible that a longer education programme\nmay result in improved static or dynamic\nmuscle endurance.\nThe present study had several limitations.\nFirst, the study population included only\npatients aged 18\u00ad30 years, and the findings\ntherefore cannot be applied across all age\ngroups. Further studies are required to\ndetermine the value of health education in\nother age groups, such as the elderly.\nSecondly, it was not possible for patients\nand physical therapists to be blinded to\ngroup allocation. Thirdly, the sample size\nwas small, limiting the value of the findings.\nFinally, there was no long-term follow-up in\nour study.\nIn conclusion, health education provides\nadditional benefits over and above lumbar\nexercise alone for improving the pain, dis-\nability and health-related quality-of-life of\nchronic low back pain. It remains to be\nseen whether this is the case in other age\ngroups.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Key Laboratory of\nExercise and Health Sciences of Ministry of\nEducation, Shanghai University of Sport,\nShanghai, China.\nReferences\n1.
