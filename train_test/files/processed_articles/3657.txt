Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) protein\nis a naturally occurring competitive inhibi-\ntor of the pathological effects induced by\nRAGE; it is produced by alternative splicing\nof the RAGE mRNA, which involves the\non intron 8 of the AGER gene, has been\npostulated to be involved in the regulation\npolymorphism was reported to be associated\nwith antioxidant status.19 It was also\nreported to be associated with diabetes-\nassociated microvascular dermatoses in\nIn light of the strong association between\nDR and retinal oxidant status and micro-\nvascular lesions,8,9 it can be hypothesized\ntribute to the pathogenesis of DR by\ninfluencing the AGE\u00adsRAGE balance. The\naim of this present study was to investigate\nthe association between the 2184A/G poly-\nmorphism and DR in Han Chinese patients\nwith T2DM. This information will be\nimportant in understanding the influence\nof ethnic background on the association\nbetween AGER gene polymorphisms and\nDR, which might provide a basis for under-\nstanding the mechanism by which RAGE\ncontributes to DR.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis cross-sectional genotyping study\nenrolled consecutive Han Chinese patients\nwith T2DM in the Department of\nEndocrinology and Metabolism, First\nAffiliated Hospital of Nanchang\nUniversity, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province,\n2012. Family trees were used to ensure their\nHan Chinese ethnic background.

All\npatients underwent a complete eye examin-\nation that included dilated retinal examin-\nation and fundus photography or fundus\nfluorescein angiography using a TRC-\n50DX Mydriatic Retinal Camera (Topcon\nMedical Systems, Oakland, NJ, USA), and\nDR was diagnosed as previously reported.22\nThe patients with T2DM were divided into\ntwo subgroups: those with retinopathy\n(DR) and those without retinopathy\n(NDR). Demographic and clinical data\nincluding age, sex, body mass index, dur-\nation of T2DM, systolic and diastolic blood\npressure were recorded for each study\nparticipant.\nThe exclusion criteria were: (i) those aged\ndiabetes mellitus, acute infection, the acute\nstage of a chronic infectious disease, inflam-\nmatory disease, uterine disorders, severe\nliver or renal disease; (iii) patients with eye\ndiseases, spontaneous miscarriages or\nembryo transplant failures on more than\nthree occasions; (iv) patients taking drugs or\ntherapies that might affect reproductive or\nmetabolic functions; (v) patients with endo-\nmetrial thickness <7 mm on the secretory\ntransformation day; (vi) patients who were\nunable to comply with the study protocol.\nThe reproductive system-related exclusion\ncriteria were necessary because fundus fluor-\nescein angiography is contraindicated in\npregnant women.\nThis study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of the First Affiliated Hospital of\nNanchang University, Nanchang (no.\nconsent was obtained from all study partici-\npants. This study was performed in adher-\nence to the principles of the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\nBiochemical analyses\nVenous blood samples were drawn from\neach patient by venipuncture after at least an\n8-h fast for routine blood biochemical ana-\nlyses that included total triglycerides (TG),\ntotal cholesterol (TC), high-density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipo-\nprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood\nglucose, and glycosylated haemoglobin\n). TG (intra- and inter-assay coeffi-\ncients of variation [CVs] of <8% and <9%,\nrespectively), TC (intra- and inter-assay CVs\nof <6% and <9%, respectively), HDL-C\n(intra- and inter-assay CVs of <9% and\n<11%, respectively), LDL-C (intra- and\nrespectively) and fasting blood glucose\n(intra- and inter-assay CVs of <10% and\n<12%, respectively) were analysed using an\nchemistry immuno analyser (Olympus,\nTokyo, Japan) according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions. HbA1c\n(intra- and inter-\nassay CVs of <6% and <9%, respectively)\nwas measured using a Bio-Rad D-10TM\nhaemoglobin analyser (Bio-Rad, Hercules,\nCA, USA). All biochemical analyses were\ncarried out in triplicate.\nGenotyping\nFor genotyping analysis, genomic DNA was\nextracted from 5 ml of peripheral blood\ncollected in 1.5 mg/ml ethylenediaminete-\ntra-acetic acid using a DNA isolation kit\n(Bioteke, Beijing, China) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. The genomic\nDNA was subjected to polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) with the following primers:\nforward primer: 50-TAATTTCCTGCCCC\nATCTATGCCTCCT-30 (Shanghai Sangon\nBiological Engineering Technology &\nService, Shanghai, China). The PCR was\nperformed in a 10 ml reaction volume con-\nof forward and reverse primers, 0.225 U Taq\nDNA polymerase (Nearshore Protein\nTechnology, Shanghai, China), 200 mmol/l\nof each deoxynucleotide triphosphate\n(Nearshore Protein Technology), and\n2.0 mmol/l Mg2\u00fe using an Applied\n(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,\nUSA). The amplification protocol consisted\nof preliminary denaturation at 94C for\n5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation\nand elongation at 72C for 30 s, followed by\na final elongation step at 72C for 5 min.\nFor restriction fragment-length poly-\nmorphism analysis, the PCR products were\ndigested with BsmF1 (New England Biolabs,\nBeverly, MA, USA) for 2 h at 65C.\nDigestion products were resolved on a\n2.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis at\nmutation introduces a BsmF1 restriction site\ninto the gene;23 therefore, diagnostic BsmF1\ndigestion produced fragments of 160 base\npairs (bp) and 236 bp for the mutated minor\nallele 2184A, which does not contain this\nrestriction site, produced a single fragment\nof 396 bp in length. Four representative\nsamples from each genotype were further\nsequenced to confirm the overall genotyping\nresults.\nStatistical analyses\nThe sample size in this study was established\nbased on a pilot study, which demonstrated\nrespectively. With a sample size ratio\nbetween the NDR and DR groups of 2:1,\nit was calculated that the total number of\npatients needed to achieve 80% power with\na significance level a (two-sided a error) of\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5.

Variables that were not normally\ndistributed are presented as median (inter-\nquartile range) and compared with the\nMann\u00adWhitney U-test. Categorical vari-\nables and the Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium\nwere analysed using 2-test. Intergroup\ncomparisons of genotype and allele distri-\nbution were analysed using Fisher's exact\ntest and 2-test, respectively. A two-sided P-\nvalue <0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nenrolled in the study, including 285 patients\nin the DR group and 658 in the NDR group,\nwhich was an adequate sample size based on\nthe power calculation. The demographic\nand clinical characteristics for the DR and\nNDR groups are shown in Table 1. There\nwere no significant differences in age, sex\ndistribution, body mass index, TC, DBP,\n, FBG, 2hBG, TG, LDL-C, and\nHDL-C between the two groups. The dur-\nation of T2DM and systolic blood pressure\nwere significantly increased in the DR group\ncompared with the NDR group (P < 0.05\nfor both comparisons).\nThe genotype frequencies of the\nNDR groups were in Hardy\u00adWeinberg equi-\nlibrium. Table 2 shows the allele and geno-\ntype frequency distribution of the 2184A/G\npolymorphism in the NDR and DR groups.\nThere were no significant differences in the\nallele (A and G) and genotype (AA, AG,\nand GG) frequencies of the 2184A/G poly-\nmorphism between the DR and NDR\ngroups.\nDiscussion\nA number of single nucleotide polymorph-\nisms (SNPs) have been identified in the\ncoding and noncoding regions of the\nAGER gene.24 Many studies have investi-\ngated the association between various SNPs\nin the AGER gene with DR, but the results\nof these association studies have been incon-\nsistent or even directly conflicting. For\nexample, some studies suggested that the\ndies, including a previous study from our\ngroup, did not support a significant associ-\nation between these polymorphisms\nTable 1.

In contrast, an absence of a signifi-\ncant association between the Gly82Ser,\nmorphisms and DR has been reported in\nstudies reported that 2184A/G polymorph-\nisms were not associated with DR in patients\neven showed no association between 2184A/\nG polymorphisms and DR in a Chinese\npopulation.40 As the diverse nationalities\nwithin the very large Chinese population\nmight bring about complexity in the analysis,\nthis present study performed a cross-sectional\nanalysis to observe the correlation between\nChinese population that is representative of\nthe majority of the Chinese population.\nIn this present study, there were no stat-\nistically significant differences in the genotype\nand allele frequencies of the 2184A/G poly-\nmorphism among the DR and NDR groups,\nindicating that the 2184A/G polymorphism\nin the AGER gene is not associated with DR\nin Han Chinese patients with T2DM. The\nresults of this present study were similar to\nimportant differences exist between this pre-\nsent study and a previous study that also\nreported on a Chinese population:40 (i) this\npresent study exclusively assessed a Han\nChinese population, while the previous\nstudy evaluated a general Chinese popula-\ntion; and (ii) the present study used polymer-\nase chain reaction\u00adrestriction fragment-\nlength polymorphism, while the previous\nstudy utilized chip-based matrix-assisted\nlaser desorption ionization time-of-flight\nmass spectrometry for genotypic analysis.\nFurthermore, another study reported that the\nwas associated with diabetes-associated\nmicrovascular dermatoses in patients with\nT2DM.20 This finding and that of the present\nstudy suggest that there is heterogeneity in\nthe genetic susceptibility to diabetes-asso-\nciated microvascular complications among\ndifferent organs.\nThe present study had some limitations.\nFirst, it did not measure the serum levels of\nRAGE protein, so it was not able to deter-\nmine if the serum levels of RAGE protein\nchanged concomitantly with the presence of\ngene. Secondly, because of the limited sample\nsize, it was not possible to classify the patients\nwith DR into non-proliferative retinopathy\nand proliferative retinopathy for further\nsubgroup investigations.
