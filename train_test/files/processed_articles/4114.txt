The influence of comorbidities on\ntime to intensification was evaluated using\nthe chronic illness with complexity (CIC)\nscore.17 A diabetes comorbidity severity\nindex (DCSI) score was calculated for dia-\nbetes-related comorbid disease conditions.18\nData sources\nThe study used several administrative data-\nbases detailing health service usage in\nTaiwan, including the National Health\nInsurance (NHI) Research Database\n(NHIRD) and the virtual private network\nof the DM-P4P database. The DM-P4P\nprogramme was designed by the NHI\nBureau in Taiwan, and it is the most com-\nprehensive and mature P4P programme\nin Taiwan.12 Participation in the programme\nwas voluntary, and the DM-P4P database\nwas constructed to supplement regular NHI\nclaims data. DM-P4P patient outcome\ndata such as HbA1c\nvalues were reported\nby the hospitals and entered into the\nP4P-specific database automatically.12 This\nstudy was approved by the Research Ethics\nCommittee of National Taiwan University\nSigned informed consent was not required\nbecause this study used anonymized\ndata and did not involve any human\nexperimentation.\nPharmacological management\nIn this study, pharmacological therapy was\ndefined as prescriptions filled 120 days\nbefore and after receiving HbA1c\ntest results.\nAntihyperglycaemic agents were evaluated\naccording to the Anatomical Therapeutical\nChemical Classification Defined Daily\nDose (ATC/DDD) system developed\nby the World Health Organization.19\nAntihyperglycaemic agents were categorized\nmajor classes of oral antihyperglycaemic\nagent (ATC codes are listed outside par-\nentheses): A10BB (sulfonamides, urea deri-\n(i.e., glibenclamide, chlorpropamide, tolaza-\nmideglibenclamide, gliquidone, gliclazide,\nAnalysis\nMedications were quantified by assigning\nDDD units to each item from the NHIRD\nbased on the index of the ATC classification\nsystem.19 When used for the identification of\nchanges in prescription (Pafter\n\u00adPbefore\n), the\nprescribed total DDD was generally com-\nprised of the 17 major classes. When pre-\nscription medications from more than one\nclass were considered, any increase in the\ndosage among any of the drugs was con-\nsidered as intensified therapy.\nMeasurements\nIn this study, the following prescription\nchanges that occurred following HbA1c\nmeasurements were classified into four\nmutually exclusive groups: group 1, the\naddition of one or more new classes of\ndrug; group 2, an increase in the dosage of\nthe same drugs used prior to HbA1c\nmeasurements; group 3, no change in the\ndrug class or a decrease in the dosage\n(DDD); group 4, discontinuation of drug\ntherapy.\nDefinition of intensified therapy\nAny change in prescription according to the\nfollowing conditions was defined as intensi-\nfied therapy: the prescription of new oral\nantihyperglycaemic agents, increasing the\ndosage of any current medication, switching\nto another medication in a different thera-\npeutic class, or the initiation of insulin use.\nThe study did not treat switches to medica-\ntions in the same therapeutic class as therapy\nmodification unless the DDD of the new\nagent was more than that of the previous\nagent, because switching medications could\nbe a response to side effects rather than\nintensifying the therapy.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe Statistical Analysis System (SAS) ver-\nsion 9.3. (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\nDescriptive statistical analyses were used to\nexamine modifications in therapy to identify\ntherapeutic inertia. 2-test for categorical\nvariables were used to compare groups\n(intensified therapy and therapeutic inertia)\non key variables obtained from the NHIRD\ndata set. A P-value < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nFollowing the exclusion of ineligible\npatients, the research sample comprised of\nrevealed HbA1c\nlevels ranging from 7% to\nhad their therapy intensified, compared with\nThe mean \u00c6 SD age of the patients was\nwith HbA1c levels between 7% and 8% was\nidentified the following clinical characteris-\ntics that were significantly different between\nthe intensified therapy group and the thera-\npeutic inertia group: age, HbA1c\nlevels,\nDCSI scores, and CIC count (P < 0.001 for\nall four characteristics).\nPatients were prescribed new drugs in\ninvolved an increase in dosage of the same\ndrug class.

This present study also observed\nthat in the intensified therapy group, the\npercentage of patients who were prescribed\nmore than two types of drug was consider-\nably higher than that in the therapeutic\ninertia group. For example, for the three\noral drug combination group, 70.7% of the\nprescriptions were from patients in the\nintensified therapy group. In the therapeutic\ninertia group, however, the present study\nobserved that in many cases only a single\ntype of hypoglycaemic drug was prescribed,\nor that the dosage remained unchanged.\nFew studies have discussed switching drug\ntypes in intensified therapy.

Most of the\npatients in the intensified therapy group\nwere prescribed a combination of two\nof drug. However, in the therapeutic inertia\nvisits) of the visits the patients were pre-\nscribed with one or two types of medication.\nAcademic studies or treatment guidelines for\nchronic diseases such as high blood pressure,\ndyslipidaemia, and diabetes mellitus, indi-\ncate that complications can be prevented\nor delayed if the disease is adequately\ncontrolled.27 According to the treatment\nrecommendations for type 2 diabetes from\nthe Taiwan Diabetes Society,28 prescribing a\nlow-dose combination of drugs rather than a\nhigh dose of a single type of drug is\nmore effective in lowering blood glucose\nand alleviating the side-effects of the\nmedications.\nThis present study had several limita-\ntions. First, the study population was highly\nspecific, focusing on the DM-P4P popula-\ntion rather than the entire population of\npatients with diabetes mellitus in Taiwan.6\nA previous study reported that patients who\npresent with comorbidities or severe diseases\nare more likely to be excluded from\nDM-P4P programmes.12 Secondly, the\nstudy was unable to collect data on patient\nadherence to the prescribed therapy.\nThirdly, the study concentrated on whether\nphysicians chose to intensify treatment for\npoorly controlled blood glucose levels\nthrough the use of hypoglycaemic drugs.\nOther measures of health care such as the\nrisk of hypoglycaemia, type of drugs\nselected, increase in dosage, dietary habits\nof patients, and referral to care teams were\nnot considered in this study.6 Nevertheless,\nthe large patient population in the\nvalidated nationwide database should be\nconsidered as a representative sample, and\nshould thus provide a reliable clinical repre-\nsentation of diabetes care in routine practice\nin Taiwan.\nIn conclusion, this is the first study in\nTaiwan that has linked HbA1c\nresults to\nantidiabetic drug prescribing patterns. By\nanalysing changes in prescriptions before\nand after HbA1c\ntest results, this present\nstudy sought to determine whether phys-\nicians modified prescriptions within 120\ndays of receiving abnormal HbA1c\nresults\n(i.e., >7%). These findings suggest that\nchanges in drug prescriptions for patients\nwith poorly controlled blood glucose levels\ncould be used as an indicator of health care\nquality. For patients with HbA1c\na high proportion of those in the intensified\ntherapy group were prescribed a combin-\nation of drugs, indicating that these patients\nwere receiving adequate clinical care. In the\ntherapeutic inertia group, however, the\nstudy observed that in many cases only a\nsingle type of hypoglycaemic drug was\nprescribed or the dosage remained\nunchanged. Further studies are necessary\nto clarify the relationship between\ntherapeutic inertia and efforts to maintain\nglycaemic control.\nAuthor contributions\nThe conception and design of the study, or\nacquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation\nof the data were performed by L.Y.H., W.Y.S.,\nM.C.Y., H.L.Y., S.S., and M.S.L.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThe authors thank the Bureau of National\nHealth Insurance for financial support\nReferences\n1.
