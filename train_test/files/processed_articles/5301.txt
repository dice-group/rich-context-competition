The objective of this\nstudy is to examine the relationship between market orientation (MO) and organizational performance (OP) with service\nquality (SQ) as a moderator in the context of the hotel industry in Malaysia. MO and OP were conceptualized as three- and\ntwo-dimensional constructs, respectively, whereas SQ, which consists of two-dimensional constructs, namely, technical\nquality and functional quality, was used as a moderator. Data were gathered through a survey using a structured questionnaire\nwith a sample of 187 executive-level employees employed in hotels rated three stars and above in Malaysia. SmartPLS 2.0\n(M3) with path modeling and bootstrapping was used to examine the standard error of the estimate and t-values. The findings\nsuggest that only competitor orientation dimension of MO was significantly related to OP, whereas customer orientation and\ninter-functional coordination were not related. Interestingly, SQ was found to have moderated the relationship between MO\nand performance of the hotels in Malaysia. SQ exists to fill in the gap between customers' expectations and their perception\nof the service providers' performance that further creates differentiation and competitive advantage, which enhance MO\npractices and ultimately lead to improvements in the firm's performance.

Among the various types of\nsectors, the service sector has become one of the major con-\ntributors to Malaysian economy. As seen, service sector con-\ntributed approximately 50% of the nation's real gross\ndomestic product (GDP) over the past few years and in addi-\ntion to that, the hotel industry is said to be one of the major\ncontributors to Malaysian economy (Khairil, Isyak, Radzi, &\nmaking tourist industry the largest industry in Malaysia, the\nhotel industry needs to improve on market orientation (MO)\nand service quality (SQ) for better organizational perfor-\nPast studies have shown the positive relationship between\nMO and OP and further confirmed the importance of MO in\ndetermining firm performance (Ahmad, 2011; Chao &\nSullivan & Butler, 2009). On another note, SQ appeared to\nbe another critical measure of OP especially in service orga-\nnizations (Voon, 2005). The influence of SQ to create\ncompetitive advantage for organizations has been validated\nby various studies (e.g., Hojati, Shahin, & Shirouyehzad,\nand generally bring effect on customer satisfaction as well\n(Arasli, Katircioglu, & Mehtap-Smadi, 2005; Zeithaml &\nBitner, 2003) and subsequently better business performance\n(Kersten & Koch, 2010). This paper is organized as follows.\nFirst, discussion of past literatures and hypotheses, method-\nology, and analysis of the results are highlighted. Next, the\nlimitation of the study and directions for future research are\npointed out.\nDespite the importance of MO and SQ in determining OP,\nit is important to know how these variables are related to\neach other. Based on the research by Aziz, Yassin, and\nAhmad (2010), they postulated that MO practices are posi-\ntively associated with firm performance as well as service\n1Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia\n2Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nChee-Hua Chin, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universiti Malaysia\nEmail: cch.febunimas@hotmail.my\nMarket Orientation and Organizational\nPerformance: The Moderating Role of\nService Quality\nChee-Hua Chin1, May-Chiun Lo1, and T. Ramayah2\n Keywords\nmarket orientation, service quality, organizational performance, hotel industry, Malaysia\n2 SAGE Open\norganization in the context of Malaysia (Ramayah, Samat, &\nLo, 2011). Besides that, SQ was also found to have signifi-\ncant impact on Malaysian universities'performance from the\nperspective of international students (Shekarchizadeh, Rasli,\n& Tat, 2011). In realizing the importance of OP, firms' pur-\nsued to enhance their performance to obtain differentiation in\nthe market (Miguel, Silva, Chiosini, & Schutzer, 2009)\nthrough MO practices (Rodrigues & Pinho, 2010) and SQ\nconcentration (Lasser, Manolis, & Winsor, 2000). In addi-\ntion, better SQ provided by organizations would result in bet-\nter customer satisfaction and customers' loyalty, and further\nresulted in increased customers' retention (Levesque &\nMcDougall, 1996). Hence, MO and SQ are posited to influ-\nence OP, but those studies did not look at the link between\nMO, SQ, and OP. Thus, this paper tries to fill that gap by\nconceptualizing SQ as a moderator in the relationship\nbetween MO and OP. This paper examines the importance of\nMO and SQ that may lead to superior OP in which OP is\ntaken as a dependent variable. Two major objectives devel-\noped for the present study are as follows:\n1. to investigate the relationship between MO and OP\nand\n2. to examine the impact of SQ in moderating the rela-\ntionship between MO and OP.\nConceptual Background and\nHypotheses Market Orientation and\nOrganizational Performance\nMO\nKohli and Jaworski (1990) were the first practitioners who\nstarted investigating MO with three major components,\nnamely, intelligence gathering, intelligence dissemination,\nand responsiveness to market intelligence in their research\nand defined MO as a firm implementing the marketing con-\ncept to achieve firm superior performance. Later, this topic\nwas further examined by previous researchers (for example,\nMO would lead to superior value for customers and subse-\nquently resulted in better performances of the organizations\nLevitt (1960) posited that MO is needed in business man-\nagement and administration to increase firm performance. As\nstated by Parasuraman, Berry, and Zeithaml (1988), market-\ning skills as well as MO were needed in organization to fulfill\ncustomers' needs and satisfaction. In addition, with the skills\navailable, the organizations can make use of MOs and convert\ninto marketing capabilities effectively to gain competitive\nadvantage (Liu & Wang, 2009). In addition to that, Caruana,\nMoney, and Berthon (2000) proposed that market-oriented\norganizations would be able to deliver superior customer\nvalue and satisfaction. Past studies have indicated that mar-\nket-oriented organizations use inter-functional capabilities to\ncreate market-driven customer value (Day, 1994) and cus-\ntomer orientation (CO) and inter-functional coordination\n(IFC) were important criteria for service companies. Martin\nand Grbac (2003) described MO as a strategy to create com-\npetitive advantage to satisfy customers (Chao & Spillan,\nCO.Lafferty and Hult (2001) defined CO as a firm must\nunderstand the potential customer needs, satisfy customer's\nneeds, and creating value to them in a continuous basis for\nsustainable competitive advantage (Taleghani, Gilaninia, &\nstated that the adoption of CO requires firms to collect infor-\nmation about customers and act as an advantage to identify\nand satisfy customer's needs and wants through the applica-\ntion of customer data (Kok & Biemans, 2009). Thus, due to\nthe fluctuated of customer's demand, CO requires firms to\ntarget customers in a strategic way to save cost (Zhou,\nBrown, & Dev, 2009), and CO is also recognized as a firms'\nco-creator for value creation (Lewrick, Omar, & Williams,\n2011), which will further increase firm performance (Kai &\nCompetitor orientation (CPO). CPO was defined as the ability\nto understand the competitor's short term strengths and\nweaknesses and its long term capabilities and strategies to\ngenerate competitive advantage in the organizations (Zhou\nthat the collaborative organizational culture enables firms to\nimprove competitive performance. Hence, the importance\nfor firms to understand their current and predicted future\ncompetitors was highlighted (Kai & Fan, 2010). However,\nfirms that overly focus on CPO might reduce their own inno-\nvations (Lukas & Ferrell, 2000) because they tend to follow\ntheir competitor's path by producing similar products to\ncompete in the market. Hence, it is important for organiza-\ntions to find out their competitors'information and strategies\nfor the organization to plan and construct strategic strategies\nand increase competitive advantage.\nIFC. IFC was defined as the coordinated efforts of an organi-\nzation's resources in creating superior value to customers\n(Narver & Slater, 1990) and to generate the cooperation\namong all departments in the organizations to create superior\nvalue for customers (Wooldridge & Minsky, 2002). Porter\n(1980) mentioned that each employee has to play his or her\nown role effectively and efficiently in each department to\ngenerate sustainable competitive advantage for the firm, and\neach unit must clearly understand their job scope and specifi-\ncation (Narver & Slater, 1990). Farzad, Nahavandi, and Caru-\nana (2008) postulated that employees are no longer people\nwho provide goods or services to customers, but they work as\na team that coordinated into functional area. A recent study\nproposed that IFC be noted as an important determinant to\ncreate the ability for employees to work around conflicting\nChin et al. 3\nperspectives (Auh & Menguc, 2005) and different depart-\nments or functions in an organization cooperating to work\ntogether to achieve certain objectives (Tay & Tay, 2007).\nSQ\nSQ is essentially important for firms or organizations, espe-\ncially service organizations, to create competitive advantage\n(C. A. Gronroos, 1988), and there is a need to improve the\nSQ as supported by past researches (Camarero, 2007;\nHadikoemoro, 2002). Past researchers defined SQ as exist-\ning to fulfill customer's needs or expectations (Lewis &\nCronin and Taylor (1994) defined SQ as a form of attitude\nformed in long term throughout the overall evaluation of a\nGronroos's SQ model had been widely used by recent\nSQ as a series of activities of intangible nature that take\nplace in interactions between physical resources (cus-\ntomer and service employees) or goods or systems of the\nservice provider. In addition, the SQ model as proposed\nby C. A. Gronroos (1984) consists of two major dimen-\nsions that are technical quality (TQ) and functional qual-\nity (FQ). To date, SQ has been commonly used to measure\ncustomer satisfaction by researchers (Cronin & Taylor,\nied that adopted C. A. Gronroos (1984) SQ model, namely,\nFQ and TQ, and have show significant relationship\nbetween both TQ and FQ on several variables of customer\nTQ.TQ was widely accepted and significantly affects cus-\ntomer's perception toward the service provided (C. A. Gron-\ndefined TQ as the quality customers actually receive (result\ndimension) and mostly hidden from the customers where\nthey have little awareness of it (Bopp, 1990). C. A. Gronroos\n(2007) explained TQ as what is provided by the service.\nFQ. C. A. Gronroos (1984) defined FQ as the way services\nare delivered (how) to the customer (process dimension) and\n\"how\" the product or service functions. In a recent publica-\ntion by C. A. Gronroos (2007), FQ is defined as the charac-\nteristics of service provider and its employees, and how the\ncustomer perceives the service process. The related charac-\nteristics include professionalism and skills, attitudes and\nbehavior, accessibility and flexibility, and reliability and\nOP\nHamon (2003) defined OP as a variable used to measure the\ndegree of OP in achieving organizations' objectives,\nefficiency, and effectiveness in achieving their goals\nOP as an indicator to measure the efficiency of an organiza-\ntion to accomplish its objectives, in terms of achieving orga-\nnization MO and financial goals (Li, Ragu-Nathan,\nThere are a number of indicators used to measure OP\nsince 1900; however, among the popular indicators in the\nfinancial performance (FP) construct of OP were profit\ngrowth rate, return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA),\nand overall performance (Hancott, 2005). Furthermore,\nLi et al. (2006) mentioned that OP can be measured in\nterms of market performance (MP) and FP, which consists\nof organization's profits, return on investments (ROI),\nmarket share, and also growth of sales. Discussions in the\nfollowing sections are about two main dimensions of OP,\nthat is, FP and MP.\nFP. FP is defined as the OP in relation to profitability such as\nROA, ROS, sales growth, and overall performance (Dimara,\nOcasio (1994) proposed that FP indicators were more on\naccounting-based financial indicators. However, some even\nargue that FP indicator should be market-based (Hoskisson,\nJohnson, & Moesel, 1994). Besides, firms' FP such as return\non equity (ROE) is found to be affected by MO (Tang &\nZhang, 2002) and often being used to evaluate the growth of\nMP.MP is related to OP in terms of market share growth,\nprofit ratio, sales growth, or customer satisfaction (Ho, 2011).\nA firm's profitability ratios are used to determine how well\nthe firm performs in the market. If an organization is able to\nperform well in terms of market share or profit ratio, it can be\nconcluded that the organization is doing well in MP. Besides\nthe numeric measures, the increase in customer satisfaction\ncan be related to an increase in MP. If customers are satisfied\nwith the services or products provided, customers' retention\nrate will increase. Based on the above view, development of\nhypotheses is described in the following section.\nDevelopment of Hypotheses\nMO and OP\nIn the past decade, a number of past researches had provided\nan empirical support about the positive relationships that\nexisted between MO and OP (Hanzaee, Nayabzadeh, &\nfound to be positively linked to firm performance in terms\nof FP and MP (Chao & Spillan, 2010; Kenneth, Inman,\nBrown, & Willis, 2005; Rapp, Beitelspacher, Schillewaert, &\nBaker, 2012; Smiraova, Naude, Henneberg, Mouzas, &\nKouchtch, 2011) and the creation of organizational\n4 SAGE Open\ncompetencies that lead to superior performance of hotel\nindustry (Dev, Agarwal, & Erramilli, 2008; Sin, Tse, Yau,\nLee, & Chow, 2004; Subramanian, Kumar, & Strandholm,\noriented enable firms to respond to the market and fulfill cus-\ntomer's needs and results in an increased firm profitability.\nIFC is also noted to be positively related to firm performance\nby promoting communication and information sharing\namong department in a firm (Peters & Fletcher, 2004).\nMatsuno, Mentzer, and Ozsomer (2002) argued that there\nexisted a positive relationship between MOs and market\nshare. Furthermore, past research also highlighted that MO\npractices by focusing on customers centered will positively\nlink to firm performance, specifically to an increase of firm's\nMP besides increased firm's FP (Kenneth et al., 2005). The\nstudy by Zhou et al. (2009) indicated the importance of CO\nand CPO in creating a hotel's competitive advantage for bet-\nter business performance. Therefore, the following hypothe-\nses are established:\nHypothesis 1: CO is positively related to OP.\nHypothesis 2: CPO is positively related to OP.\nHypothesis 3: IFC is positively related to OP.\nSQ Moderates the Relationship Between MO and\nOP\nPrevious studies highlighted the linkage and positive rela-\ntionship between MO and a firm's FP (Camarero, 2007;\nKropp, 2005), some even showing the relationship between\nSQ and MO (Boo, 2006) and firm performance (Kersten &\nKoch, 2010). SQ is also considered to be a critical measure\nof OP in terms of FP or MP (Lasser et al., 2000). Moreover,\nSQ is also regarded as an important indicator in determining\na firm's FP (Kersten & Koch, 2010). The positive linkage\nbetween SQ and OP as well as MP has been established\n(E. Anderson, Fornell, & Lehmann, 1994; Golhar &\nDeshpande, 1999). For a firm to stay competitive in the mar-\nket, it should provide differentiation compared with its com-\npetitors by developing better SQ (Gounaris et al., 2003) and\nimproving on MO practices (Ramayah et al., 2011).\nFurthermore, a firm that provides superior SQ would increase\nMP as well as enhance its corporate image (Arasli et al.,\nin the past (e.g., Ramayah et al., 2011) highlighted that SQ\nhas a significant linkage to MO and has an impact on OP.\nHowever, there are no known researches in the past to\nhave found SQ as a moderator in the relationship between\nMO and OP. Hence, the following hypothesis is established:\nHypothesis 4: SQ moderates the relationship between\nMO and OP.\nMethod\nPrior to data collection, a pilot study was conducted with 20\nrandomly selected respondents among the hotels rated three\nstars and above in Kuching to ensure the clarity and reliabil-\nity of the questionnaires. A total of 285 questionnaires were\nsent out to executives employed at the top, middle, and lower\nmanagement level from 57 selected hotels rated three stars\nand above in Malaysia. The selection of these hotels was\nbased on the simple random sampling method and a calcula-\ntion of minimum sample size technique (Luck, Taylor, &\nstars and above with the Ministry of Tourism Malaysia\n(2011) were selected. The targeted respondents were com-\nprised of subordinates who were working executives and\ntheir immediate supervisors who were lower and middle\n(73%) were returned, and only 187 sets were usable. The\nmajority of the respondents were from lower level of man-\nagement (40.61%), followed by middle level of management\nlevel of management. The first section was used to collect\nthe demographic profile of the respondents. Next, in Section\nB, the MKTOR scale developed by Narver and Slater (1990),\nwhich consisted of 14 items, was used to measure the degree\nof MO practices in the organizations. For Section C, 11 items\nfrom C. A. Gronroos' (1984) SQ model was used to measure\nSQ in their organization. Last, in Section D, 12 items of the\nOP scale developed by Kohli and Jaworski (1990) were used\nto measure OP. A 7-point Likert-type scale was used, with\n1 (strongly disagree), 2 (disagree), 3 (somewhat disagree),\n4 (neither agree or disagree), 5 (somewhat agree), 6 (agree),\nFindings\nThis section presents the results of the study. To assess the\nresearch model developed in Figure 1, SmartPLS (M3) was\nused to analyze the data collected. This included path model-\ning and then bootstrapping (Chin, 1998; Gudergan, Ringle,\nof 500 re-samples were used to generate the standard error of\nthe estimate and t-values. As stated by Chin, Marcolin, and\nNewsted (2003), PLS can give more accurate estimates of\nmoderator effects by accounting for the error that attenuates\nthe estimated relationships and improves the validation of\ntheories (Helm, Eggert, & Garnefeld, 2010; Henseler &\nFassott, 2010). First, we tested the convergent validity, which\nis the degree to which multiple items to measure the same\nconcept are in agreement. Next, we proceeded to test the dis-\ncriminant validity in which the measures are not a reflection\nof some other variables and it is indicated by the low correla-\ntions between the measure of interest and the measures of\nChin et al. 5\nother constructs (Cheung & Lee, 2010). Discriminant valid-\nity can be examined by comparing the squared correlations\nbetween constructs and variance extracted for a construct\n(Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Finally, we used the Cronbach's\nalpha coefficient to assess the inter-item consistency of our\nmeasurement items (J. C. Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).\nAssessment of the Measurement Model\nFirst, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to\ntest the item reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant\nvalidity of the measurements scales. As shown in Tables 1\nand 2, all the items loading exceeded the minimum cut off\nconsistency was achieved. In terms of convergent validity,\nall the composite reliability (CR) values were above .70\nRios, 2010) and the average variance extracted (AVE) values\nmeet the minimum criteria of .50 (Henseler, Ringle, &\nthe t-values exceeded 1.96 significant levels (statistically\nsignificant at .05 levels), hence, all the measurements items\nwere significantly explaining the research construct. For dis-\ncriminant validity (see Table 4), the value of AVE was square\nrooted and testified against the intercorrelations of the con-\nstruct with other constructs in the research model (Chin,\ngreater than each of the constructs correlations (Chin, 2010),\nhence, the measurement model satisfactory achieved. In\norder to testify the reliability of the variables, Cronbach's\nalpha (see Table 5) was used to validate the reliability of the\nvariables and the minimum cut off point must above .70\n(Cronbach, 1951). Thus, all the internal reliabilities of scales\nHence, the measurement model was satisfactory and pro-\nvided sufficient evidence in terms of reliability, convergent\nvalidity, and discriminant validity.\nAssessment of the Structural Model\nNext, Figure 2 and Table 6 present the results of the hypoth-\neses testing. The results showed that SQ exists to be moder-\nating the relationship between MO and OP but negative\nrelationship between CO and IFC toward OP. However, CPO\npositively related to OP. Two hypotheses were accepted,\nnamely, H2 and H4, whereas, H1 and H3 were rejected.\nThe researcher also conducted a global fit measure (GoF)\nto examine the global validation of PLS model (Amato,\nwas calculated (see Equation 1), and results of .661 (R2 was\nvalue of .36 and indicated that the GoF value was large\nenough to support the validation of PLS model globally\n(Wetzels, Schroder, & Oppen, 2009). As seen, the model has\nbetter explaining power in comparison with the baseline val-\nues (GoFsmall = .1, GoFmedium = .25, GoFlarge = .36;\nFigure 1. Research model.\nNote.

Besides, SQ is equally impor-\ntant for an organization to achieve competitive advantage\naims to examine the impact of MO practices on OP and the\nChin et al. 7\nmoderating factor of SQ in the relationship between MO\nand OP.\nInterestingly, the results have demonstrated that SQ influ-\nenced the relationship between MO and OP such as FP and\nMP. MO often relates to external practices of providing value\ntoward customers, and SQs are commonly used to influence\nor enhance the market-oriented services in fulfilling custom-\ners' needs and wants (Lin, 2011). SQ is equally important\nto OP, especially those of the service organizations\nshowed similar results from past researches in which SQ\npositively affected MO and OP such as FP (Chang & Chen,\nfulfill customers' needs and wants (Lewis & Mitchell, 1990)\nas SQ fills the gap between customers'expectations and their\nperceptions with regard to the service providers' perfor-\ncan influence MO practices that could lead to a better firm\nperformance such as FP.\nIn addition, past researchers (Gamage, Suwanabroma,\nhad highlighted the importance of SQ to better serve their\ncustomers by adopting the concept of MO to fulfill custom-\ner's needs (Samat, Ramayah, & Mat Saad, 2006) and to\nabsorb competitors' strengths to gain competitive advantage\nin the marketplace for better hotel's marketing and FP (Sin\net al., 2004). Apart from obtaining customer satisfaction, a\nsuperior SQ would lead to customer loyalty (Heskett, 2002),\nwhich would ultimately lead to improvements in a firm's\nMP. Previous researches (Ahsan & Herath, 2006; Lainema &\nHilmola, 2006) showed that SQ has significant influence on\ncustomers' purchase intention. As firms provide better SQ to\nbetter serve their customers, this would increase the custom-\ners' purchase intention as well as attract more customers\nthrough the positive word of mouth (WOM) generated by\nsatisfied customers. In the long term, this will create cus-\ntomer loyalty, resulting in a larger base of customers who\nprefer to purchase products and services from this organiza-\ntion (Ahmadi & Bidarpoor, 2011). Providing good SQ would\nTable 4. Discriminant Validity of Constructs.\nCustomer orientation Competitor orientation\nInter-functional\ncoordination Service quality\nOrganizational\nperformance\nNote.

For employees to\nprovide good quality of service to customers, the firm needs\nto provide the appropriate training that will generate a good,\npositive attitude that is equally important in service indus-\ntries (Dennis, Chris, & Eli, 2005). In return, there will be an\nincrease in employee satisfaction, which leads to a better\nimplementation of IFC process and achievement of certain\nOn the other hand, CPO was found to be significantly\nrelated to OP such as FP and MP.

The\nresults are congruent with past studies whereby MO such as\nCO and IFC has no positive impact on the financial aspect of\nOP (Khamwon & Speece, 2005; Hult, Ketchen, & Slater,\n2009). Thus, it is believed that there exist some barriers to\nMO practices on management behavior such as poor top\nmanagement skills (Tomaskova, 2009) and lack of compen-\nsation and reward system (Hashim, 2011; Islam & Ismail,\n2008) being in place, which point to the contrast in the find-\nings of the study. Nonetheless, some of the researchers even\nhighlighted that failure of MO practices is highly due to cul-\ntural differences (Anantatmula & Kanungo, 2010), lack of\ncommitment (Trueman, 2004), and interdepartmental con-\nIn short, the findings have noted that SQ is essentially\nimportant in determining the success of MO practices that\nFigure 2.

In contrast, the results revealed that there\nwas no direct relationship between MO dimensions such as\nCO and IFC toward OP. However, CPO was found to be sig-\nnificantly related to OP. Hence, the results have provided\nevidence of SQ as an important key indicator in linking the\nrelationship between MO and OP.\nImplications\nThe present research has a number of theoretical and practi-\ncal implications for scholars and practitioners. First, this\nstudy represented the theoretical study about MO, OP, and\nimpact of SQ on hotel industry. In the past, there were lim-\nited studies on SQ in moderating the relationship between\nMO and OP. The present research offers a foundation for\nresearchers who are concerned in this field to further investi-\ngate the use of SQ as a moderator in other industries. Second,\nthis study is also believed to be able to provide useful guide-\nlines for scholars in the study of SQ as a moderator in the\nrelationship between MO and OP.\nCertainly, the finding of this study can provide valuable\ninformation to hotel managers by adopting a more system-\natized view of their SQ, MO practices, and future develop-\nment. Knowledge from this study can provide managers with\nan enhanced ability to design their services much more effi-\nciently and can be used to shape their organizational opera-\ntional strategy to create competitive advantage (C. A.\nGronroos, 2007) and gain superior return. Besides, this study\nalso increases managers' understanding of the importance of\nMO practices and SQ orientation.At the organizational level,\ntop management should always emphasize and provide train-\ning to employees to ensure that employees always put their\ncustomer first and satisfy customers' needs in the most\nappropriate and efficient way. This is to ensure greater under-\nstanding among all employees and work together to achieve\nsuperior performance. This finding has suggested that SQ be\nincorporated as a tool to evaluate MO in the hotel industry.\nHence, this can be used in determining the service firm's\nmarketing strategy in achieving better performance.\nLimitations and Direction for Future Research\nThere are some restrictions and limitations during the devel-\nopment and implementation of this study as with any other\nstudy. First, this study was cross-sectional in which the data\nwere collected in a limited time frame and this only offered a\nstatic perspective on fit.
