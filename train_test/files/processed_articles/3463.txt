With the LNT model, any radiation exposure is as-\nsumed to increase one's risk of cancer. Based on the LNT model, others have\npredicted tens of thousands of deaths related to environmental exposure to radio-\nactive material from nuclear accidents (e.g., Chernobyl) and fallout from nuclear\nweapons testing. Here, we introduce a mechanism-based model for low-dose, radia-\ntion-induced, stochastic effects (genomic instability, apoptosis, mutations, neoplas-\ntic transformation) that leads to a LNT relationship between the risk for neoplastic\ntransformation and dose only in special cases. It is shown that nonlinear dose-\nresponse relationships for risk of stochastic effects (problematic nonlethal muta-\ntions, neoplastic transformation) should be expected based on known biological\nmechanisms. Further, for low-dose, low-dose rate, low-LET radiation, large thresh-\nolds may exist for cancer induction. We summarize previously published data\ndemonstrating large thresholds for cancer induction. We also provide evidence for\nlow-dose-radiation-induced, protection (assumed via apoptosis) from neoplastic\ntransformation. We speculate based on work of others (Chung 2002) that such\nprotection may also be induced to operate on existing cancer cells and may be\namplified by apoptosis-inducing agents such as dietary isothiocyanates.\n",

The key discussion relates to whether the linear nonthreshold (LNT) model\nfor low-dose extrapolation of cancer risk is valid. This model is widely used by\nregulatory agencies and in radiation and chemical protection. With the LNT hy-\npothesis, risk progressively increases as dose increases. Any amount of carcinogen\nexposure increases one's risk of cancer. Thus, for radiation, any exposure is as-\nsumed to increase one's risk of cancer. Tens of thousands of cancer deaths in the\nU.S. have been calculated to arise from fallout from nuclear weapons testing (CDC/\nNCI 2001). Similar numbers could possibly emerge if one chose to use the LNT\nmodel to calculate cancer deaths from inhaling smoke from forest fires that have\noccurred over the years (which contains naturally occurring and manmade radionu-\nelides) .\nOther possible dose-response curves (linear-threshold, sigmoid, u-shaped, etc.)\nare considered to be more in line with known mechanisms of carcinogenesis\npublic health implication is that if a threshold response were assumed, then expo-\nsures below the threshold value would be considered safe (Calabrese and Baldwin\nIt is highly unlikely that use of the LNT model will be abandoned by regulatory\nagencies and in radiation/chemical protection unless substantial evidence ofthresh-\nolds can be demonstrated from epidemiological studies and from mechanisms-\nbased experimental and theoretical investigations. Now there is growing evidence\nfrom epidemiological, experimental, and mathematical modeling studies that does\nnot support use of the LNT model for central estimation ofcancer risks at low doses.\nInstead, the results support the existence of thresholds (quite large in some cases)\nfor radiation-induced excess cancers, possibly in association with complex dose-\nresponse relationships (e.g. u-shaped). The u-shaped dose-response relationship is\nThe foe us of this paper is to use a mechanisms-based model (called NEOTRANS2)\nfor radiation-induced neoplastic transformation (considered an early stage in can-\ncer development), to show how thresholds for specific radiation-induced excess\nstochastic effects (problematic nonlethal mutations and neoplastic transformation)\ncould arise in some cases as a result of natural protection (resilience) from radia-\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\ntion-induced damage.

However, over\nthese years, supporting data have slowly emerged via publications and presentations\nby others in a variety of fields. Here, we introduce and explain the supporting data\nand present the NEOTRANS\nmodel as though it were developed based on existing\ndata to support key modeling assumptions. This form of presentation was selected\nto help the reader feel more familiar with these assumptions (as some relate to novel\nmechanisms) when presented.\nMacromolecular Changes\nIonizing radiation induces a range of DNA damage similar to that which arises\nendogenously from reactive oxygen species generated as byproducts of metabolism\nOeggo 2002). Daniel Billen (1990), in discussing the concept of negligible dose in\nthe context of naturally occurring DNA damage and repair, has reported that\nthousands of spontaneous DNA-damaging events occur in each cell each day.\nRobert Stewart (1999) reported an estimate (best estimate) numerically equivalent\nto 105 spontaneous \"Locally Multiple Damage Sites\" (in particular double strand\nbreaks) occurring in DNA, per million cells, per day. These lesions are quickly\nrepaired, essentially error free in most cases. It is highly plausible that adding a few\ntens or hundreds more of such lesions through low-dose radiation (especially low-\nLET radiation) or low-dose chemical exposure is unlikely to overwhelm the cell's\nhighly efficient damage repair machinery. Therefore, it is reasonable that error-free\nrepair could operate after very low doses of low-LET radiation or genotoxic chemi-\ncal.\nNumerous repair processes are now known and include nucleotide excision\nrepair, base excision repair, transcription-eoupled repair, mismatch repair, and\nHanawalt 2001). The indicated repair processes operate at the individual cell level\nand provide for individual cell resilience to vulnerable states. A complex cell\nsignaling network regulates the individual-resilience system. The failure of this\nsystem can lead to repair errors, which in turn can lead to problematic lethal and\nnonlethal mutations (forms of genomic instability).\nOperationally, two types of mutations (heightened vulnerability states) are used\nto classifygenes: (I) those where a mutation causes a gain in function (protooncogene\nto oncogene change); and (2) those where mutations cause function loss (tumor\nsuppressor genes). In the development of leukemia and lymphoma, the first step is\nconsidered to be activation of a protooncogene into an oncogene, which arises via\na translocation of a promoter beside the active site of a normally repressed growth-\nScott et al.\nIn the case of thyroid cancer, specific genes are rearranged that involve activation\nof the ret protooncogene (Jacob et at. 1996; Rabes and Klugbauer 1998; Smida et at.\n1999). Whereas oncogene activations are quite specific, for tumor suppressor gene\nmutations, random deletions of large amounts of DNA, large parts of a gene, an\nentire gene, or several genes could occur. For many solid tumors, the inactivation\nofa tumor suppressor gene is considered to be the first step in the cancer induction\nprocess and is commonly assumed to affect a tissue-specific \"gatekeeper\" (Sidransky\nexpansion of tissue-specific stem cells is allowed (Sidransky 1996).\nRadiation mutagenesis may principally proceed via DNA deletions through\nmisrepair and misrecombination at DNA double-strand breaks (ICRP 1999; Trott\nand Roseman 2000). In our modeling of radiation-induced neoplastic transforma-\ntion, mutations are assumed to arise from misrepair of DNA damage, and nonlethal\nmutations are assumed responsible for the initial persistent genomic instability.\nHere, we have not distinguished between misrecombination of DNA double strand\nbreaks, misrepair, or incomplete repair. Presently, we only distinguish between\nlethal and nonlethal mutations.\nGenomic Instability and Mutations\nThe concept of genomic instability was introduced by W. F. Morgan and col-\nleagues (1996) and is now widely accepted. Genomic instability can propagate over\nmutations to represent genomic instability. Problematic nonlethal mutations among\ndividing cells we consider to possess persistent problematic instability (PPI) transfer-\nable to progeny. Most radiation-induced mutations directly involve the loss of large\nparts of the tested gene, leading to loss ofheterozygosity (Trott and Roseman 2000).\nHowever, most radiation-induced mutations associated with genomic instability are\npoint mutations and small deletions (Little 1999). In modeling radiation-induced\ngenomic instability, we do not assume PPI to be associated with a specific type of\nmutation. We only distinguish between lethal and nonlethal mutations, and we\nassume that neoplastic transformation arises as a stochastic process among cells\n(including progeny) with PPI.\nSome useful findings related to genomic instability have been reported in a study\nof 20 liver tumors, which were diagnosed in a cohort of people treated with\npoint mutations. Iwamoto et at. (1999) concluded that the relevant genetic alter-\nations leading to liver cancer result from an induced genetic instability (indirect\neffect), rather than from radiation exposure directly. In our modeling of neoplastic\ntransformation, we have characterized PPI as an indirect effect (arising via misrepair)\nof irradiation (or chemical exposure) that can be passed to cell progeny. We have\nalso introduced a new class of genomic instability (transient; Scott 1997), which is\nnow modeled as a direct effect (hit hypersensitive cells) and indirect effect (includ-\ning deleterious bystander effects) of irradiation.\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\nApoptosis: Protector of the Cell Community from Stochastic Effects\nIn contrast to the necrotic mode of cell death, apoptosis protects from problem-\natic cells in the body via their elimination without causing inflammation (Mendonca\net at. 1999). Strasser et at. (2000) summarized key points associated with apoptosis\nsignaling as follows:\nApoptosis, a physiological process for killing cells, is critical for the normal\ndevelopment and function of multicellular organisms. Abnormalities in cell\ndeath control can contribute to a variety of diseases, including cancer, autoim-\nmunity, and degenerative disorders. Signaling for apoptosis occurs through\nmultiple independent pathways that are initiated either from triggering events\nwithin the cell or from outside the cell, for instance, by ligation of death\nreceptors.\nNew research results indicated that problematic cells in the body may be detected\nvia molecular biological mechanisms and selectively eliminated via apoptosis to\nprotect the cell community (Yang et at. 2000). A key assumption of the NEOTRANS\nmodel to be introduced is that existing problematic cells (e.g., problematic mutants,\nneoplastically transformed cells) in the cell community can be signaled to undergo\napoptosis and selectively eliminated via low-dose-induced protective bystander mecha-\nnisms. These mechanisms of reduction in cell community vulnerability status we\npresume to explain, at least in part, reported low-dose hypersensitivity to cell killing\namong cancer cell lines (joiner et at. 1999) as well as virally transfected cells\nThus, the NEOTRANS\nmodel to be presented includes both deleterious and\nprotective bystander effects.\nPossible Mechanisms for Recognizing and Selectively Eliminating Problematic\nCells\nAs already indicated, we have hypothesized the existence ofa protective apoptotic\nbystander effect for neoplastic transformation. Such an effect is necessary to ad-\nequately explain existing data whereby risks for neoplastic transformation (Azzam\nrather than increase at very low doses.\nA crucial missing link related to our modeling is identification of mechanisms\nwhereby problematic cells already present in a population can be recognized and\nsignaled to undergo apoptosis, while nearby normal cells are essentially unaffected.\nSome progress is being made by researchers to identify and characterize such a\nprotective process for the cell community.\nCucinotta et at. (2002) point out that ionizing radiation produces DNA damage\nthat causes protein fluctuations through binding damage recognition proteins to\nDNA breaks and subsequent downstream events. The type of fluctuations may\ndepend on the type of DNA break such as simple or complex single-strand breaks\nand double-strand breaks or base damage (Cunniffe and O'Neil 1999).\nNonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No. I, 2003 97\nScott et at.\nBarcellos-Hoffand Brooks (2001) point out that bystander effects after low doses\nof radiation are extracellular signaling pathways that modulate both cellular repair\nand death programs. The authors also indicate that transforming growth factor J3\n(TGFB1) is known to be an extracellular sensor of damage. They further indicate\nthat extracellular signaling relevant to carcinogenesis in normal tissue can eliminate\nabnormal cells or suppress neoplastic behavior.\nDr. C.-R. Yang and colleagues (2000) at Case Western University have reported\nclusterin [CLU, a.k.a. TRPM-2, SGP-2, or radiation-induced protein-8 (XIP8)] to be\nimplicated in apoptosis. In a recent study (Yang et at. 2000), they reisolated CLUj\nXIP8 by yeast two-hybrid analyses, using as bait the DNA double-strand break repair\nprotein Ku70. They showed that low-dose, radiation-induced nuclear CLU /XIP8\nprotein coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized in vivo with Ku70/Ku80, a known\nDNA damage sensor and key double-strand break repair protein, in human MCF-\n7:WS8 breast cancer cells. Their key finding was that enhanced expression and\naccumulation of nuclear CLU/XIP8-Ku70/Ku80 complexes appear to be an impor-\ntant cell death signal after irradiation. Further, their data suggest that CLU/XIP8\nmay play an important role in monitoring cells with genomic instability and/or\ninfidelity, created by translesion DNA synthesis, by facilitating removal ofgenetically\nunstable cells as well as severely damaged cells. Yang et at. (2000) strongly suggest\nthat the CLU/XIP8 protein is a general cell death signal, monitoring overall cell\nhealth.\nYang et at. point out that the recent findings that Ku70, but not Ku80, knockout\nmice are cancer prone appear consistent with the notion that formation of nuclear\nCLU/XIP8 with Ku70 may play an important role in eliminating carcinogenic\ninitiated (problematic) cells.\nIt is now known from in vitrostudies of viral-induced neoplastic transformation\n\u00b7 Increasing plating density reduces transformation frequency.\n\u00b7 Transformed cells are selectively killed via apoptosis.\n\u00b7 Cytokines and reactive oxygen produced by nontransformed neighboring cells\ntrigger apoptosis.\n\u00b7 TGFB1 enables nontransformed cells to trigger apoptosis among transformed\ncells.\nGiven the above information, we consider our key modeling assumption of the\nexistence of an inducible protective bystander apoptosis effect whereby problematic\ncells are recognized (after signaling from other cells) and selectively eliminated\nfrom the cell community to be highly plausible.\nAnother assumption we make is that neoplastic transformation is a necessary\nearly step for cancer induction (a widely held view). Thus, demonstrating low-dose-\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\ninduced protection from neoplastic transformation in vitro is consistent with the\npossibility of low-dose-induced protection from cancer in vivo.\nCellular Differentiation\nThe current view is that some problematic cells may undergo differentiation\n(group resilience), and this also protects the cell community from propagating\nstochastic adverse effects. Presently, the NEOTRANS2\nmodel does not include this\nfeature. We consider differentiation to be more important in vivo than in vitro. Our\nmodeling applications presented in this paper relate to in vitro studies.\nDeleterious Bystander Effects\nDeleterious bystander effects (Ballarini etal. 2002) whereby unirradiated cells are\ndamaged have been examined in two general types of cellular systems. In the first,\nmonolayer cultures have been exposed to very low fluences of alpha particles either\nfrom an external source (Nagasawa and Little 1992; Azzam et al. 1998; Little et al.\nnique involves harvesting medium from irradiated cells and incubating it with\nniques have demonstrated that cells not being irradiated can still be damaged.\nFurther, the bystander effect does not arise from simply irradiating media. Cell\ndamage and intercellular signaling are essential.\nWe also allow for the possibility of deleterious bystander effects via model param-\neters that account for both direct and indirect deleterious radiation effects.\nOur modeling research focuses on characterizing excess stochastic effects (mu-\ntations, neoplastic transformations) after very low doses ofradiation by using mecha-\nnisms-based models. While many in vitroexperimental studies have been conducted\non radiation-induced neoplastic transformation, only limited experimental data are\nIn previous work, we introduced a class of models (that included NEOTRANSj )\nfor characterizing neoplastic transformation of cells that relates the probability of\nneoplastic transformation to the state ofgenomic instability (Scott 1997; Schollnberger\nmodeled as heterogeneous with both hypersensitive- and resistant-cell subpopula-\ntions (considered the simplest case of heterogeneity). NEOTRANS1\nhas now been\nrefined, leading to a model called NEOTRANS2\n(Figures 1 and 2) that includes\napoptotic and necrotic death pathways. In this paper, NEOTRANS2\nis applied to in\nvitro data for low-radiation-dose-induced neoplastic transformation.

The expression \"ge-\nnomic instability state\" refers to any spontaneous or toxicant-induced instability in\nthe genome, including any initial transient instability, as well as any persistent\ninstability that can be passed to cell progeny. In addition to a stable (ST) genome,\nmodel (as well as NEOTRANS1) involves four types of genomic\ninstability (Figures 1 and 2): (1) Normal-minor instability (NMI), associated with\nnormal cell function and normal genome status; (2) Transient-minor instability (TMI) ,\nassociated with toxicant-induced genomic damage that is fully repairable (without\nany significant errors); (3) Transient-problematic instability (TPI), associated with\ngenomic damage that may sometimes be fully repaired but can be misrepaired; and\n(4) PPI, which arises from misrepair that yields nonlethal mutations. Thus, PPI can\nbe passed to progeny, increasing their potential for stochastic effects such as neo-\nplastic transformation. We use the term misrepair in a broad sense as already\nindicated. We consider TPI and PPI to be vulnerability states (for additional delete-\nrious stochastic effects).\nOther Model Features\nWith the NEOTRANS2\nmodel, a very small fraction, To\u00ab 1, of the cell population\nis presumed to have already undergone neoplastic transformation over their life\nhistory. The discussion that immediately follows relates to the remaining vast major-\nity (1 - To \"\" 1) of the cells. With both NEOTRANS2\n(Figures I and 2) and\nNEOTRANS\nj ,\nonly cells in the high vulnerability state PPI (viable mutants) can\nproduce neoplastically transformed progeny. Only genomically ST cells, those with\nNMI, and those with PPI progress through the cell cycle and divide. Other cells are\nassumed arrested at cell cycle checkpoints (resilience facilitation) where genomic\ndamage is repaired or misrepaired. Irradiation times were assumed quite short\nrelative to cell cycle transit times, so that no equations were used to account for\nprogression through the cell cycle during irradiation. Neoplastic transformations\nare assumed to occur as a stochastic process, and the transformed cells may have an\naltered cell cycle transit time distribution.\nWith NEOTRANS2, target genes are specified (Figures 1 and 2) and include\ntumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, repair genes, apoptosis genes, and cell-eycle\nregulator genes. Unlike NEOTRANS1, with NEOTRANS2\ncell killing is explicitly\naddressed and not treated as independent ofneoplastic transformation. Two modes\nof cell death are considered: apoptosis (assumed to predominate at very low doses)\nand necrotic death (assumed important only at moderate and high doses). Again,\nnonlethal mutations are assumed to arise via misrepair. Lethal mutations are as-\nsigned to the apoptosis pathway (including delayed lethal mutations). The analytical\nsolutions in the present paper apply only to very low-radiation doses where necrotic\ndeath can be assumed negligible.\nScott et al.\nModel parameters aI' a 2, and a 3, common to both NEOTRANSj\nreflect genomic sensitivity to initial and higher levels of damage production and\nshould be multiplied by the dose rate c. The parameters III and 112 are also common\nto both models and govern the commitment rate of damaged cells to an error-free\nrepair pathway. In addition, the parameters 111 and 112 are common to both models\nand govern the commitment rate ofdamaged cells to a misrepair pathway that leads\nto nonlethal mutant cells (PPI cells).\nIn light of new evidence that protracted exposure to low-LET radiation can lead\nto large dose thresholds for cancer induction, we allow 111 and 112 to be step functions\nof dose rate. Below a critical dose-rate value c* (presently undetermined), the\nparameters take on a value of zero. This dose-rate threshold is presumed to depend\non the type of radiation and type of cancer. For dose rates above c*, the parameters\nthen take on fixed values> zero. The parameters <1>1 and <1>2 appear only in NEOTRANS2\nand govern the rate of commitment of damaged cells (including lethal mutations)\nto the apoptotic pathway. The parameters KI and K2\n(which are important only for\nmoderate and high doses) appear only in NEOTRANS2\nand when multiplied by\ndose rate, govern the rate at which already damaged cells enter the necrotic death\npathway. Typical units for ex, and 1\\ are mGy-I. Typical units for u, 11i' and <1>i are min-I.\nParameters aI' a 2, and a 3\nshould be viewed as being comprised of two parts: (1)\none part relates to direct damage to DNA; (2) the other part relates to indirect\ndamage to DNA and includes deleterious bystander effects.\nFor very low-radiation doses, only hypersensitive cells are assumed to be induced\nto transform (new transformations) and cells are modeled as being killed only via\nthe apoptotic pathway. Thus, only Figure 1 applies for very low doses and to the\nhypersensitive subfraction, fl , of cells at risk.\nFurther, with our current version of the NEOTRANS\nmodel, a fraction To\n(stochastic quantity) of cells at risk is assumed to have already undergone sponta-\nneous neoplastic transformation, based on genomic alterations over their life his-\ntory, but prior to dosing with radiation (or chemical). Because the life history ofcells\nspans a long time compared to the short time period over which cells are irradiated\nduring in vitro studies, this is considered a highly plausible assumption when apply-\nto data from in vitro irradiation studies. For in oioo exposure,\nadditional protective mechanisms could be important (Stecca and Gerber 1998;\nModel Solutions for Very Low Doses\nEvidence is now strong that death via apoptosis at low radiation doses can occur\npossibility that a fraction foof the To cells already neoplastically transformed is killed\nvia a bystander effect for apoptosis (a key modeling assumption). In such cases, the\ndose response at very low-radiation doses could decrease rather than increase.\nIndeed, this type of dose response has now been demonstrated experimentally with\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\ngamma irradiation of HeLa x skin fibroblast human hybrid cells (Redpath and\nThe analytical solutions that follow apply to very small dose increments. As\nindicated, a small fraction To of cells in the population is modeled as already having\nthe problem of interest (e.g., neoplastic transformation in this case, but a similar\nequation would apply to nonlethal problematic mutations). At such doses, newly\ninduced neoplastic transformations are modeled as arising from a small (in num-\nber), hypersensitive subfraction of remaining (I - To) cells at risk. This hypersensi-\ntive subfraction is given by fl(1 - To) \"\" fl' From Figure I (which shows only\nhypersensitive cells), it can be seen that a very small dose increment ~D (where ~D\n== c M, for a small time increment M) to the fraction fl(I - To) of hypersensitive cells\nwill lead to an expected fraction fl(1 - To)ul~D of cells in the state TPI (assuming\nall hypersensitive cells are initially in the state NMI); for this fraction entering the\ntransient state TPI, the conditional probability ofsubsequently undergoing misrepair\n(leading to PPI) is just fIJ/ (I-ll + TIl + cl>1)'\nThe dose-response function for radiation-induced, neoplastic transformations\nper surviving cell, TFSC(~D), at very low doses ~D is thus given by the following:\nTFSC(~D) = To, for ~D = 0,\nTFSC(~D) = (l - fo)To + [(1 - To)fluITlIQ/(1-l1 + TIl + lJ>1)] ~D, for ~D > O. (1)\nparameter Q is the proportion of the newly induced parental PPI cells that produce\nnc-oplastically transformed progeny. The parameter Q, therefore, depends on fol-\nlow-lip time. It is also likely influenced by the signaling characteristic ofthe cellular\nroumumity (Barcellos-Hoff and Brooks 2001). Equation I leads to the LNT model\nonly when fo = 0 (i.e., when the protective apoptosis effect is absent) and TIl > 0\n(misrepair occurs).\nEquation I is based on the assumption that intercellular signaling that leads to\nthe protective bystander apoptosis effect occurs without a radiation dose threshold.\nData to be presented later (Azzam et al. 1996; Redpath et al. 2001) support this\nhypothesis for ionizing radiation. However, this may not be the case for genotoxic\nWith Equation 1, the dose-response relationship is discontinuous at zero dose\n[steps down from To to (1- fo)To]. The dose-response associated with Equation I is\nlinear but with a zero-dose intercept of (1 - fo)Torather than To when fitted to low-\ndose data with the zero-dose group excluded (see hypothetical dose-response curve\nin Figure 3). As indicated in Figure 3, To is stochastic.\nThe dose-response curve forTFSC will exceed To (a random variable) only for ~D\nin excess of a stochastic threshold (StoThresh) dose DTh\n(Figure 3) given by:\nNonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine.

This is consistent with observations of\nAzzam et al. (1996). A StoThresh (as apposed to a deterministic threshold) is consid-\nered to occur because To as well as all other model parameters are treated as\nstochastic.\nSince To is on the order of 10-4 to 10-5 for most in vitro studies of neoplastic\ntransformation, selectively killing all To cells (i.e., fo = 1) would still lead to a cell\nsurvival fraction> 0.999. Unfortunately, currently available data at low doses for\nwhich equations apply are inadequate to derive distributions for individual model\nparameters 111' TIl' <1>1' fl, aI' fo' and O. However, more general forms of Equations 1\nand 2 are derived and used in obtaining estimates offo,To, and 0.\nstrating that DTh\n> 0 has important implications for radiation protection and radia-\ntion risk assessment, these more general solutions are quite useful.\nEquation 1 can be rewritten in the more general form:\nwhere\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\nEquation 3 can be considered a generalized, three-parameter (stochastic param-\neters fo, To, and kT) form of the NEOTRANS2\nmodel for application to very low-\nradiation doses. A corresponding equation may also apply to highly genotoxic\nchemicals, with ~D then representing a very small dose of the agent of interest. For\na constant exposure time (for a chemical), ~D could be replaced by the concentra-\ntion with the parameter kTredefined to include the exposure time in the numera-\ntor.\nEquation 2 can also be rewritten in the more general form:\nFigure 3 shows a hypothetical mean dose-response curve based on Equations 3 and\n4. In the figure, hypothetical distributions F(To) (shown vertically) and G(Dn,)\n(shown horizontally) are presented for To and DTh, respectively.\nFor very low doses and in the framework of the NEOTRANS2\nmodel, it is possible\nthat the protective bystander effect may predominate (fo\u00bb kT~D) when the spon-\ntaneous frequency To of transformation is relatively high and when fo> 0 and ~D is\nvery small (e.g., less than about 100 mGy low-LET radiation). Implied here is a\nrelative small value for the slope parameter kTin combination with a small dose. In\nsuch cases, the data for radiation-associated neoplastic transformation (and for\nspecific problematic nonlethal mutations) should be adequately represented by the\nrelationships:\nTFSC(~D) = To, for ~D = 0\n= (1 - fo)To, for ~D > O. (5)\nFurther, TFSC (~D) should be uncorrelated with dose over the dose range for which\nthe above applies. This requirement only applies to doses in excess of background.\nWe later apply Equation 5 to two data sets for gamma-ray-induced neoplastic cell\ntransformation for doses up to about 100 mGy.\nWe describe later how distributions for To (stochastic), DTh (stochastic), and the\nslope parameter kT have been obtained for induced neoplastictransformation.\nData Used to Estimate Model Parameters\nWe fitted the protective bystander effects version of the model to available data\nfor radiation-induced neoplastic transformation (two data sets) and low-dose apoptosis\n(one data set):\nData Set 1 - Gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation data of Redpath et\n\u00b7 HeLa x skin fibroblast human hybrid cells\nScott et al.\nData Set 2 - Gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation data of Azzam et at.\n\u00b7 BOCO gamma rays\n\u00b7 Dose rate: 2.4 mGy/min\nData Set 3 - Gamma-ray-induced cell killing (via apoptosis) data ofSeymour and\n\u00b7 Human keratinocytes (immortalized via viral transfection but not transformed)\n\u00b7 BOCO gamma rays\nEstimating Model Parameters\nFor the narrow dose range (0 to 100 mGy), all data (for ~D > 0) for transforma-\ntion and cell survival were uncorrelated with dose. This is in line with characteristics\nof the NEOTRANS2\nmodel that predicts that the largest effect at very low doses is\nthe protective bystander apoptosis effect, which is modeled as being independent of\ndose.\nFor data in the dose interval 0 to 100 mGy (excluding the zero dose group), the\nparameter \u00a3;) was evaluated for both the data of Redpath et at. (2001) and Azzam et\ntion was calculated as a function of the mean observed transformation frequency,\nTFSC, and reported mean for To using the relationship\nfO= 1 - (TFSC/To)' (6)\nEquation 6 was used for each dose in the dose range indicated leading to different\nestimates of fo. and corresponding values (l-fo)To. Mean values for (1-fo)Toand the\nassociated standard deviation were obtained. Dose-response relationships (horizon-\ntal line) were based on these means and the associated 95% confidence intervals\nassuming a normal distribution.\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\nBayesian methods (Siva 1998) were used only for the neoplastic transformation\ndata of Redpath et at. (2001) and only when doses over the wider range of 0 to 500\nmGy were evaluated. For this dose range, Equations 5 and 6 do not apply. Equation\n3 applies and was therefore used. WinBUGS software (Spiegelhalter et at. 1999) was\nused to carry out the Bayesian inference via use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) analyses. Transformants were modeled as having Poisson distributions.\nFor the Bayesian analysis, the prior distribution for kT\nwas uniform over the interval\nused; for To, a normal prior distribution was used with a mean of 2.24 x 10-5 and\nstandard deviation of2.8 x 10~ [same values as reported by Redpath et at. (2001)).\nFive thousand MCMC iterations were first run. Auto correlations were then exam-\nined to judge how many additional iterations were needed for convergence. Fewer\nthan 30,000 iterations (total) were found needed to ensure convergence. Iterations\nwere then increased so that the total was 60,000. These iterations were more than\nwere needed, but they essentially guaranteed convergence of the Markov chains.\nThe first 40,000 iterations were then discarded as bum-in. Analysis of posterior\ndistributions was then based on the final 20,000 MCMC realizations.\nFigure 4 shows results obtained for our analysis of the Azzam et at. '5 (1996) data\nfor gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation ofC3H 10T1/2 cells in vitro. Only\ndata in the very low dose range (0 to 100 mGy), where Equation 5 applies, were used.\nFor this dose range (with the zero dose group excluded), there was no significant\ncorrelation between transformation frequency and dose (R2 = 0.18, P > 0.5).\nThe corresponding results for application of the NEOTRANS2 model to the\nRedpath et at. (2001) data for gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation of\nHeLa x skin fibroblast cells are presented in Figure 5. Solid points in these figures\nrepresent the experimental data, and smooth and dashed curves represent model-\nassociated results with means (central curve) and 95% confidence regions. For these\ndata and for doses above zero, there was no significant correlation of transformation\nIn both Figures 4 and 5 the risk of neoplastic transformation clearly drops\nimmediately below the spontaneous frequency to a fixed value independent of\nradiation dose, as predicted by the NEOTRANS2 model (Equation 5).\ndata of Redpath et at. (2001) and Azzam et at. (1996), respectively. The parameter\nfomean was therefore 2.2 times larger for the C3H lOT1/2 cells than for the HeLa\nx skin fibroblast human hybrid cells. Similarly, the spontaneous frequency mean was\nabout 76 times larger for the C3H 10T1/2 cells than for the HeLa xskin fibroblast\ncells. These results suggest that fo may be correlated with genetic sensitivity, being\nlarger (more protective) for the more sensitive target cells. However, what implica-\ntion this has for sensitive individuals is unclear.\nScott et al.\n~\u00b7o\u00b7\nlit -:\no\n.\\\nQ\nor-\n5 .....~----------\n.... ~\"\"'\"-.:..., ... .-...II! _ _~ _ _: - - ..... _ _ ..... -_-.Ill!\n0-1-------...-------,...--------,\nD'o'se {mGy)\nFigure 4.

For this dose, the benefit/harm ratio exceeds 600,000. This\nmeans that on average, for each newly induced transformant, more than 600,000\nassumed already present spontaneous transformants are eliminated via the pre-\nsumed protective bystander apoptosis effect.

(2001).\nDISCUSSION\nmodel, neoplastic transformation arises as a stochastic\nprocess but only for cells in the high vulnerability state PPJ. The PPJ (spontaneous\nor induced) is assumed to arise via nonlethal mutational events. These mutations\nare the type described by Mothersill and Seymour (l998b) as nonlethal but possibly\ncancer-facilitating mutations.\nResults in Figures 4 and 5 are consistent with predictions of the NEOTRANS2\nmodel that for very low doses of low-LET radiation, TFSC (L1D) should be below the\nspontaneous frequency and independent of dose (e.g., in the range 0 to 100 mGy).\nResults in Figure 6 for gamma ray-induced neoplastic transformation of HeLa x skin\nfibroblast human hybrid cells have 5% (percentile), 50%, and 95% values for the\nBayesian posterior distribution for the StoThresh of approximately 50, 150, and 250\nmGy, respectively. We can state that the data used are consistent with a StoThresh and\nthat the Bayesian posterior distribution for the threshold assigns essentially a zero\nprobability for the threshold being zero. A value of zero corresponds to the LNT\nmodel. The dose-response curve for excess transformations is clearly of the nonlin-\near, threshold type.\ne\nf\nu,\nc::\n'>\n.~\n:;$\n(I)\nScott et al.\n;Dos~(rt1GYl\nFigure 8. Observed and simulated survival of gamma-irradiated human papillomavirus\ntransfected keratinoeytes based on the Seymour and Mothersill (2000) data\n(solid points). Analyses were performed for the dose range ato 100 mGy. Model-\nassociated means (central curve), 5% (percentile; lower curve), and 95% (upper\ncurve) values are presented based on an assumed norrnal distribution.\nA similar analysis was attempted for fission neutron (Hill et at. 1984; Balcer-\nKubiczek and Harrison 1991) and for alpha particle data of others (Bettega et at.\n1992) for induced neoplastic transformation. However, a close examination of\nposterior distributions for the StoThresh revealed modes (highest values in the\ndistribution function) very close to zero with the distributions having a tail to the\nright but not to the left of the modes. Such results indicate that a zero-dose\nthreshold for the high-LET radiation-induced neoplastic transformation could not\nbe excluded based on the very limited data used. Central (mean) estimates of the\nthresholds were < 10 mGy, which would be very difficult to demonstrate experimen-\ntally.\nWe now introduce the term group (G) adaptation to describe any cell community\nadaptation initiated by a group of cells that protects the cell community (including\nthe elimination of problematic cells as well as reducing cell vulnerability by cell\ndifferentiation). G-adaptation therefore also applies to low-dose radiation therapy\nfor cancer (used in Europe but currently forbidden in the U.S.) assuming problem-\natic cancer cells to be signaled via irradiated normal cells to undergo apoptosis.\nWhere an individual cell adapts to an environmental stress by changing its\nresilience or vulnerability status, we called this individual (1) adaptation. Thus,\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\n'?I-adaptation can be beneficial or problematic, depending on the endpoint consid-\nered. An example ofbeneficial I-adaptation would be the induction of an error-free\nrepair process, thereby increasing the cells' resilience to the induction of stochastic\neffects. An example of problematic I-adaptation would be a stress-related induction\nof an error-prone repair process producing viable mutations that facilitate the\noccurrence of neoplastic transformations.\nAnother example of problematic I-adaptation is when an individual cell through\nadapting to a different environment has a net reduction in its capacity to undergo\napoptosis. A reduced capacity to undergo apoptosis increases the risk for stochastic\neffects such as neoplastic transformation and cancer. Studies at our Institute suggest\nthat background radiation can influence cells through problematic I-adaptation.\nDr. Saxena and colleagues (2002) have conducted studies whereby cells irradiated\nafter maintenance at background radiation levels were compared to corresponding\ncells irradiated after being maintained at lower than background (via special shield-\ning). The cells maintained at lower than normal background had reduced compe-\ntence for undergoing apoptosis. These finding are in line with the view that back-\nground radiation may serve as a natural nutrient. Moving from a region of moderate\nbackground radiation to a region oflower background may over time increase one's\nsusceptibility to the induction of stochastic effects.\nNote that the view that problematic I-adaptation can lead to an increase in cancer\nrisk is consistent with reported cancer risks from radon in homes (Cohen 1995). Dr.\nCohen (1995) reported lung cancer mortality related to residential radon exposure\nin the U.S. After adjusting for smoking, lung cancer mortality was found to decrease\nwith increasing mean residential radon levels.\nSome early modeling publications attempted to explain high-LET radiation\ninverse dose rate effect in vivo based on cell culture studies where cells were\nirradiated over several hours (Brenner and Hall 1990; Elkind 1994). These models\nwere essentially based on the hypothesis that cells would be repeatedly hit at\nsensitive stages of the cell cycle during protracted irradiation. Such a hypothesis is\ninconsistent with the observation that damaged cells are arrested at cell-cycle check-\npoints rather than progress through the cell cycle. Further, biological kinetics over\na few hours cannot explain inverse dose rate effects from radiation doses delivered\nover months to years. We speculate that inverse dose rate effects, such as those seen\nby Dr. Cohen (1995) that involve dose delivery over months to years, are more likely\nrelated to problematic I-adaptation, where cells in lower radiation environments\n(relative to an optimum) lose ability to undergo apoptosis. Additional problematic\nI-adaptation may be associated with the known decrease in DNA repair efficiency\nwith increasing age.\nWith the current version of NEOTRANS\n2, a fraction fo of the spontaneous\nneoplastic transformants is eliminated via a radiation- (or chemical-) induced pro-\ntective bystander apoptosis effect. The parameter fo can be viewed as representing\nthe number of present spontaneous neoplastic transformants (of the type of inter-\nest) eliminated via the protective bystander apoptosis effect divided by the total\nScott et al.\nnumber of spontaneous neoplastic transformants present. We give the parameter fo\nthe special name protection factor (PROFAC). Thus, the PROFAC represents the\nremoval efficiency via intercellular signaling mechanisms of existing problematic\ncells among the problematic cells present. The PROFAC is considered to relate to\n-adaptation but its magnitude may be influenced by I-adaptation.\nUsing our NEOTRANS2\nmodel, which includes a protective bystander effect via\napoptosis, we have found a rather large StoThresh for gamma-ray-induced neoplastic\ntransformation of HeLa x skin fibroblast human hybrid cells. Others (Kondo 1999;\nand Pollycove 2001) also put forth the notion that a threshold for radiation-induced\nexcess stochastic effects could arise from such a protective mechanisms.\nIn the current version ofNEOTRANS2, the misrepair pathway is assumed to apply\nonly for a dose rate in excess of a critical value c*. This has been changed in the\nmodel to account for others' observation that chronically administered (low-dose\nrate) low-LET irradiation appears to induce cancer (at certain sites in the body) only\nafter very large radiation doses, if at all (Ootsuyama and Tanooka 1991, 1993; Rossi\nHarold Rossi and Marco Zaider (1997) critically reviewed the literature on\nradiogenic lung cancer and concluded that \"at radiation doses generally of concern\nin radiation protection \u00ab 2 Gy), protracted exposure to low-LET radiation (x- or\n-rays) does not appear to cause lung cancer. There is, in fact, indication of a\nreduction of the natural incidence.\"\nHoel and Li (1998) have demonstrated that use of a threshold-type, dose-re-\nsponse model leads to better characterization of both the leukemia incidence and\nmortality data for atomic bomb survivors than use of the LNT model. In addition,\nlung cancer induction by alpha radiation, based on Mayak workers who inhaled\nplutonium-239. R. E. Rowland (1994) has reported a large threshold for bone\ncancer induction by alpha radiation based on data for radium dial painters.\nThe recent Hanford Thyroid Disease Study did not find evidence for any excess\nrisk of thyroid cancer induction for persons who were exposed to radioactive iodine\nreleased from the Hanford facility (USDHHS 2002). For doses in the range of 0 to\n100 mGy, risk was not correlated with dose and was less than for the control group\nbased on persons outside what was considered the irradiation zone. Further, for\nseveral health effects, the mean slope of the risk vs. dose relationship was negative.\nIt is important to point out implications of our findings related to low-dose\nrisk assessment for chronic exposure. Firstly, G-adaptation can lead to protec-\ntion of the cellular community from low-dose-induced stochastic effects. How-\never, there is a possibility that some risk gains and risk losses can occur. Persons\nwho would have developed spontaneous cancers may be protected by low-dose\nexposure, while others exposed and who would not have developed spontaneous\ncancer may have added risk (likely very small if any) for cancer induction.\nMechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response\nThe net population effect could be a reduction in the number of cancer cases\nafter low-dose exposure, but the subgroup that would not have developed spon-\ntaneous cancers might have a higher cancer incidence. This poses some \"food\nfor thought\" for the future discussion of protecting the public from low doses of\ngenotoxic agents.\nmodel has also been adapted for ethylene oxide (EO)-induced\nmutations in T cells of mice after inhalation exposure to a genotoxic chemical\n(Walker etat. 2002). The In ternational Agency for Research on Cancer has classified\nEO (an immediate oxidative metabolite of ethylene, a normal body constituent) as\na Group 1 human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence in animals with strong\nevidence in humans ofa relevant carcinogenic mechanisms, rather than on support\nfrom epidemiological studies of EO-exposed workers (!ARC 1994). For application\nto chemicals such as EO, the variable c then becomes the time-dependent exposure\nconcentration or dose rate (e.g., for a critical metabolite) to target tissue. The\nindicated adapted model, called NEOTRANS\nincludes a postulated threshold\nconcentration for the induction ofintercellular signaling that leads to the protective\nbystander apoptosis effect as well a second threshold for excess mutations (Walker\nWe have explained the low-dose protective effects against radiation-induced\nneoplastic transformation as being due to a bystander apoptosis effect. Another\npossible explanation would be the induction ofa highly efficient repair process that\nis not available at background levels of irradiation. However, we do not consider the\nnotion ofinduced efficient repair adequate to explain a decrease in risk for neoplas-\ntic transformation. For one reason, the induced repair process may not be highly\nefficient (for protecting against problematic cells) as recently demonstrated\n(Oudalova et at. 2002). The cited researchers demonstrated that moderate doses (>\n400 mGy) induce a system ofSOS response leading to elevated survival and elevated\nyield of chromosomal aberrations among surviving cells (meristem cells of spring\nbarley). Secondly, with induced efficient repair, plating efficiency for low-dose-\nirradiated cells should then be significantly higher than for controls, which appears\nnot to be the case.\nIt is important to mention the issue of genetic sensitivity. Some humans are\nhighly sensitive to low-dose radiation-induced stochastic effects, due to inherited\nabnormalities in DNA repair. How the protective bystander apoptosis effect pre-\nsented here relates to such individuals has not been resolved. One could speculate\nthat such individuals would have high frequency of spontaneous neoplastic trans-\nformations. If so, how these individuals will be affected by low-dose radiation or\nlow-dose chemicals would be expected to depend on their ability to mount a\nprotective response via apoptosis. Since both DNA repair and apoptosis are regu-\nlated through signaling pathways that involve p53, it is possible that persons with\ninherited deficiencies in DNA repair will also have deficiencies in apoptosis. If so,\nsuch individuals may not benefit from the protective bystander apoptosis effect\ndiscussed.\nScott et al.\nCONCLUSIONS\nNonlinearity in the dose-response relationship for the risk of radiation- (or\nchemical-) induced problematic, nonlethal mutations and neoplastic transforma-\ntion could arise via several mechanisms:\n1. The induction of a protective bystander apoptosis effect whereby existing\nproblematic cells are selectively eliminated.\n2. Only error-free repair below a specific dose rate with misrepair occurring\nabove that dose rate.\n3. An induction ofan error-prone repair process above a dose threshold whereby\ncells with significant genomic damage are more likely to survive. This would\nbe expected to lead to an increase in mutations and neoplastic transforma-\ntions and possibly for cancer cases (rather than a decrease).\nBoth 1 and 2 above would be expected to lead to a threshold for excess (relative\nto the spontaneous level) problematic mutations, excess neoplastic transformation,\nand possibly for excess cancers.\n"
