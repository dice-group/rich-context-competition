    "abstract": "Abstract\nPsychological well-being has been linked with better health, but mostly with cross-sectional evidence. Using MIDUS,\na national sample of US adults (N\n=\n4963), longitudinal profiles of well-being were used to predict cross-time change\nin self-reported health over 9\u00ad10\nyears. Well-being was largely stable, although adults differed in whether they had\npersistently high versus persistently low or moderate levels of well-being. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors,\nthose with persistently high well-being reported better health (subjective health, chronic conditions, symptoms, and\nfunctional impairment) across time compared to those with persistently low well-being. Furthermore, persistently\nhigh well-being was protective of improved health especially among the educationally disadvantaged. The findings\nunderscore the importance of intervention and educational programs designed to promote well-being for greater\nsegments of society.\n",

Whether high\nwell-being across time is protective of better health in the\ncontext of adversity, defined as low educational standing,\nis also examined. Educational gradients in health have\nbeen well documented, with low education predictive of\nelevated risk of disease and mortality (Adler et al., 1994;\nhigh levels of PWB have been linked with reduced inflam-\nmation (interleukin-6) among educationally disadvan-\ntaged adults (Morozink et al., 2010). Such work adds to\nthe growing body of research documenting the health\nbenefits of psychological and social strengths among\nthose lacking high economic or educational standing\net al., 2014). The focus on socioeconomic adversity in the\npresent inquiry thus provides a more stringent test of\nwhether health benefits of persistently high well-being are\nevident in vulnerable (socio-economically disadvantaged)\nsegments of the population.\nWe utilize multiple self-report indicators of physical\nhealth: self-rated health, chronic conditions, physical\nsymptoms, and functional limitations. Self-rated health is\na subjective global assessment of health status and in mul-\ntiple studies and countries has been robustly linked to\nhealth outcomes, including mortality (Idler and Benyamini,\nmeasures. Furthermore, dynamic profiles of self-rated\nhealth have been linked with psychosocial factors. In a\nlongitudinal study of Taiwan elders, consistently low self-\nrated health across a 14-year period was predicted by\nhigher baseline scores on the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression (CES-D) scale (Lee et al., 2012). For\nmore specific health assessments, such as chronic condi-\ntions and physical symptoms, the associations with well-\nbeing tend to be bi-directional, with lower baseline levels\nof well-being predicting subsequent poorer health as well\nas poorer health predicting lower well-being (Steptoe\net al., 2015). Importantly, clinical studies have shown that\nparticipant reports of chronic illnesses closely match\nadministrative data and medical records (Katz et al., 1996;\nKriegsman et al., 1996). Finally, higher levels of PWB,\nincluding purpose in life, have been associated with\nreduced risk of disability (Boyle et al., 2010b; Ostir et al.,\n2000). This diverse array of physical health indicators, all\ncommonly used in life course studies, is valuable for clari-\nfying whether persistently high well-being is predictive of\nbetter cross-time health in particular domains or shows\nbroader impact across all four indicators.\nAlthough longitudinal analyses frequently use baseline\nmeasures of well-being to predict subsequent change in\nhealth, our analyses focus instead on cumulative profiles of\nwell-being. The rationale is that most respondents had\nhighly stable profiles of well-being across time, although at\nnotably different levels (low, medium, and high). Key\nhypotheses were that (1) those with persistently high PWB\nwould show better health at Time 2 (controlling for Time 1\nhealth) compared to those with persistently low or moder-\nate levels of PWB, and (2) persistently high (vs low) well-\nbeing would moderate the linkages between educational\nstatus and cross-time health. That is, stable high PWB\nwould predict better Time 2 health especially among the\neducationally disadvantaged, thus demonstrating protective\nhealth benefits of high PWB in vulnerable subgroups. To\ndetermine whether the cumulative well-being approach\naffords substantive advances over use of baseline well-\nbeing alone, findings from the two approaches were also\ncompared.\nMethods\nSample\nParticipants were from the Midlife in the United States\nadults included a random digit dialing (RDD) telephone\nsurvey, with oversampling in five cities (related to geo-\ngraphic-specific agendas) (n=4244), plus a sibling sam-\nple of the main-sample respondents (n=950). Also\ngenerated by screening a representative national sample of\napproximately 50,000 households for the presence of a\ntwin (as part of ongoing national omnibus surveys). The\nbaseline survey employed a 30-minute phone interview\nfollowed by two Self-Administered Questionnaires\n(SAQs), mailed to individuals after completing the phone\ninterview. Response rates for the phone survey were: RDD\nthese individuals, response rates for the SAQs were: RDD\nWith support from the National Institute on Aging, a\nlongitudinal follow-up was initiated in 2004. The Time 2\ndata collection used the original protocol: following suc-\ncessful completion of a 30-minute phone interview, partici-\npants were mailed two SAQs. Of the original 7108\nparticipants completing the phone survey at baseline, 4963\n(70%) were successfully re-contacted and completed the\nyears later. Adjusted for mortality, the\noverall retention rate was 75\npercent (see Radler and Ryff\n(2010) for details on attrition). Separate retention rates\nwere: RDD sample (69%), siblings (81%), and twins\n(81%). Comparison of the longitudinal and baseline\nMIDUS samples revealed the usual selective bias evident\nin prior research--namely, that retention rates were higher\namong those in better health and with more education at\nbaseline as well as among women, Whites, and married\nRyff et al. 3\nparticipants completed the Ryff's PWB scales (Ryff, 1989)\nat each of the two occasions of measurement and were thus\nincluded in analyses that follow. At Time 2, the ages of\nthese participants ranged from 32 to 84years.\nMeasures\nThe demographic variables included baseline characteristics\nof age (continuous), gender (0=male, 1=female), and edu-\ncational level (1\n=\nno school/some grade school, 12\n=\nPhD,\nMD, or other professional degree). PWB was measured with\nsix scales (Ryff, 1989): autonomy, environmental mastery,\npersonal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in\nlife, and self-acceptance. Each scale consisted of three\nitems,withamixofpositiveandnegativeitems.Respondents\nindicated the extent (from 1 strongly agree to 7 strongly\ndisagree) to which the statements described them. Negative\nitems were reverse coded so that higher scores reflected\nmore positive appraisals. Summed scores were created from\nall scales. Table 1 provides summary statistics and cross-\ntime correlations for these measures.\nFour physical health outcomes (Time 2) were examined:\n(1) self-reported physical health (1=poor, 2=fair, 3=good,\n=\nvery good, and 5\n=\nexcellent); (2) number of chronic\nconditions (such as asthma, stomach problems, and diabe-\nsymptoms such as headaches, joint problems, difficulty\nsleeping, and so on (0=not at all, 1=once a month, 2=sev-\neral times a month, 3\n=\nonce a week, 4\n=\nseveral times a\nweek, and 5\n=\nalmost every day; range\n=\ninstrumental activities of daily living (IADL) where higher\nscores indicated more functional limitations. Summary sta-\ntistics of health at both Time 1 and Time 2 as well as cross-\ntime correlations for these variables are given in Table 1.\nLongitudinal trajectories of well-being\nBaseline psychological factors, such as personality traits\n(e.g. neuroticism, conscientiousness), are often used to pre-\ndict cross-time health, such as heightened risk of illness or\nalternative approach uses longitudinal trajectories of psy-\nchosocial factors to predict changing health. This strategy\nmay be particularly useful when psychological factors are\nhighly stable as it allows emphasis on cumulative effects\nacross time. Most MIDUS participants, in fact, had stable\nprofiles of well-being over the 9- to 10-year period: using\nthe index of reliable change (Christensen and Mendoza,\nincrease or decrease on any dimension of well-being over\n9\u00ad10years. Nonetheless, they were stable at different lev-\nels, with some individuals showing persistently high and\nothers persistently low or moderate levels of well-being\nacross time.\nTo classify respondents into cumulative subgroups, a\ntypology was created wherein each respondent was jointly\ncharacterized based on Time 1 and Time 2 well-being. Such\ncross-classification could be done in multiple ways (i.e.\nusing tertiles, quartiles, or quintiles of distributions at each\ntime point). We examined all three possibilities and ulti-\nmately selected quartiles so as to produce a typology of\nchange and stability that was neither too undifferentiated\n(tertiles) nor too granular (quintiles). That is, the goal was\nto find the optimal balance between using overly loose\n(large subgroups) versus overly strict (small cell sizes)\ncross-time classification criteria.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, quartiles made it possible to\nidentify respondents who were stable (at low, medium, and\nhigh levels) across the two waves as well as those who\nincreased or decreased across time. Change was defined as\nmoving upward, or downward, 2+ quartiles from Time 1 to\nTime 2. We chose this criterion based on its comparability\nwith reliable change index (Christensen and Mendoza,\n1986), which is slightly more conservative. Thus, our\nresulting typology classified the majority (78%\u00ad83%) of\nrespondents as stable at low, medium, or high levels, with\nthe rest (17%\u00ad22%) classified as increasing or decreasing.\nContrasts between these categorical groups were then used\nto predict changing profiles of health.\nResults\nStepwise multiple regression analyses were performed using\nthe four Time 2 health variables as outcomes. In the first step,\nage, education, gender, and Time 1 health were entered. By\nentering the Time 1 health, the dependent variable (Time 2\nhealth) focused on residualized change in health. In the\nTable 1.

In the tables that follow, no contrasts of\nstable hi with increasing are included because few such\neffects were obtained across the four outcome variables. To\ntest whether persistently high well-being afforded greater\nprotective health benefits among the less educated, a third\nstep entered interaction term of education with stable lo ver-\nsus stable hi. Significant interactions were graphed using the\nderived regression equation for each model. Middle, low,\nand high education levels in such graphs were, respectively,\ndefined as the mean and 1 standard deviation below and\nabove the mean.\nSubjective health\nTable 2 shows results of hierarchical regression analyses pre-\ndicting Time 2 subjective health from cumulative profiles of\nPWB, after adjusting for education, age, gender, and Time 1\nhealth. For all six scales of well-being (as well as for the\noverall composite), those with stable lo profiles had worse\ncross-time health compared to those with stable hi well-\nbeing. In addition, for three domains of well-being (environ-\nmental mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance), those\nwith stable mid well-being had significantly worse cross-\ntime health compared to those with stable hi well-being. For\nall scales except autonomy, those with decreasing well-being\nhad poorer health at Time 2 (net of Time 1) compared to\nthose with stable hi well-being.\nInteraction analyses contrasting stable lo versus hi well-\nbeing at different levels of education showed significant\nFigure 1.

The pattern,\nillustrated for positive relations in Figure 2(a), shows the\npredicted protective influence: among those with stable hi\npositive relations, there is little difference in Time 2 health\nas a function of education, whereas among those with sta-\nble lo quality ties to others, those with limited educational\nattainment had poorer health compared to those with higher\neducational standing. This same pattern was also evident\nfor autonomy, environmental mastery, and personal growth.\nChronic conditions\nTable 3 shows the results of hierarchical regression analyses\npredicting Time 2 chronic conditions from cumulative pro-\nfiles of PWB, after controlling for education, age, gender,\nand Time 1 chronic conditions. Across all dimensions of\nwell-being (as well as for the overall composite), those with\nstable lo well-being showed greater increments in chronic\nconditions compared to those with stable hi well-being. In\naddition, for environmental mastery and self-acceptance,\nthose with stable mid well-being had significantly greater\nincrements in chronic conditions compared to those with\nstable hi well-being. For all scales of well-being except\nautonomy, those with decreasing profiles of well-being also\nshowed significantly greater increments in chronic condi-\ntions compared to those with stable hi well-being.\nInteraction analyses contrasting stable hi versus stable lo\nwell-being at different levels of education revealed a sig-\nnificant effect only for autonomy. The effect, illustrated in\nFigure 2(b), shows that among those with stable hi auton-\nomy, educational status does not matter in predicting cross-\ntime changes in chronic conditions. However, among those\nwith stable lo autonomy, there is a gradient in chronic con-\nditions wherein less educated show greater increments\nacross time compared to those with high educational stand-\ning. Thus, persistently high autonomy served as a protec-\ntive factor against cross-time increments in chronic\nconditions among the less educated.\nHealth symptoms\nTable 4 shows results of hierarchical regression analyses pre-\ndicting Time 2 health symptoms from cumulative profiles of\nPWB, after controlling for education, age, gender, and Time 1\nhealth symptoms. Cross-time increments in health symptoms\nwere significantly higher for those with stable lo compared to\nstable hi well-being across all six dimensions of PWB (as\nFigure 2.

In addition, those with sta-\nble mid well-being had significantly greater increments in\nhealth symptoms compared to those with stable hi well-being\nfor four dimensions of well-being (autonomy, environmental\nmastery, personal growth, and self-acceptance). For all scales\nof well-being except purpose in life, those with decreasing\nprofiles of well-being also showed significantly greater incre-\nments in health symptoms across time compared to those\nwith stable hi well-being.\nInteraction analyses contrasting stable hi versus stable lo\nwell-being at different levels of education revealed signifi-\ncant effects for autonomy and environmental mastery. This\neffect is illustrated for environmental mastery in Figure\n2(c) and shows that among those with stable lo environ-\nmental mastery, there is a gradient in which the less edu-\ncated show greater increments in health symptoms across\ntime compared to those with higher educational standing.\nAlternatively, persistently high environmental mastery\nserved as a protective buffer against cross-time increments\nin symptoms conditions among the less educated. The same\npattern was obtained for autonomy.\nFunctional health (IADLs)\nTable 5 shows results of hierarchical regression analyses\npredicting Time 2 measures of functional health (IADLs)\nfrom cumulative profiles of PWB, after controlling for edu-\ncation, age, gender, and Time 1 IADLs. Cross-time incre-\nments functional health limitations were significantly\nhigher for those with stable lo compared to stable hi well-\nbeing across all six dimensions of PWB (as well as for the\noverall composite). In addition, for environmental mastery\nand self-acceptance, those with stable mid-level well-being\nalso had significantly greater increments in functional limi-\ntations compared to those with persistently high well-being.\nFor all scales of well-being except autonomy, those with\ndecreasing profiles of well-being also showed significantly\ngreater increments in functional health limitations com-\npared to those with stable hi well-being.\nInteraction analyses contrasting stable hi versus stable lo\nwell-being at different levels of education revealed signifi-\ncant effects for environmental mastery and self-acceptance.\nThe effect for self-acceptance is illustrated in Figure 2(d)\nand shows that among those with stable lo self-acceptance,\nthere is an educational gradient such that those with less\neducation show greater increments in IADLs across time\ncompared to those with higher educational standing.\nHowever, among those with persistently high self-accept-\nance, educational status does little to differentiate cross-\ntime increments in functional impairment, thus illustrating\na protective influence among the less educated. The same\npattern was evident for environmental mastery.\nTable 5.

First, to examine\nwhether baseline levels of PWB have as much predictive\ninfluence in predicting cross-time health as cumulative pro-\nfiles of well-being, separate regression analyses were run\nusing the baseline well-being (separately for all six PWB\nscales) as an independent variable entered at step 2, rather\nthan the categorical cross-time groups. Such analyses tested\nwhether varieties of stability constitute an advance over\nwhat can be learned from using baseline levels of well-\nbeing in predicting subsequent health change. In every\ninstance, the cross-time typology (i.e. cumulative profiles)\nhad more explanatory power than the baseline measures\n(measured by change in R2 at step 2 when the trajectory set\nor, alternatively, the baseline variable was entered); that\nis \u00ad the cumulative well-being approach explained between\n1.1 and 4.5 times more variance than baseline measures\nalone. Specifically, of the 24 regression models run, over a\nthird (9 models) explained 2 to 3 times the variance as base-\nline measures only, and nearly half (11 models) explained 3\nto 4+ times the variance compared to baseline measures\nonly. Thus, cumulative assessments of well-being per-\nformed notably better than baseline assessments in account-\ning for variance in changing health.\nSecond, another set of regression analyses tested the\nalternative implied causal directionality--namely, where\nbaseline levels of health (four different indicators) predicted\ncross-time changes in PWB (six different dimensions). In\nthe majority of these analyses (87%), the well-being typol-\nogy explained substantially more variance (ranging from 2\nto 4+ times as much) in cross-time health than the reverse.\nThis result likely reflects the fact that self-reported health\nshowed greater cross-time variability, whereas PWB was\nlargely stable for the majority of respondents.\nFinally, because the MIDUS study includes twin pairs\nand siblings of the RDD sample members, assumptions of\nindependent observations are violated. To address whether\nsuch familial dependencies biased the results, mixed effects\nmodels with random intercepts for family clusters were\nused to re-run the analyses. All conclusions drawn from the\nmixed effects models were unchanged from those reported\nabove.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this investigation was to examine whether\ncumulative profiles of PWB would predict better health,\nmeasured with multiple indices over a 9- to 10-year period.\nMost respondents showed stable profiles of well-being;\nthus, the key question was whether those with persistently\nhigh well-being would have better cross-time health com-\npared to those who had persistently low or moderate well-\nbeing. The results provided robust support for this\nhypothesis, net of sociodemographic factors (educational\nstatus, age, and gender) known to be linked to both well-\nbeing and health. Thus, for all outcomes (subjective health,\nchronic conditions, symptoms, and functional impairment),\nthose with persistently high levels of autonomy, environ-\nmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with\nothers, purpose in life, and self-acceptance had better\nunfolding health (after adjusting for baseline health) than\nthose with persistently low levels of well-being.\nFurthermore, those with persistently high compared to\npersistently moderate well-being had better health, albeit\nfor fewer outcomes. For environmental mastery and self-\nacceptance, differences between persistently high versus\nmoderate well-being were significant for all health meas-\nures. For autonomy and personal growth, such effects were\nevident in predicting fewer increments in health symptoms\nacross time, while for purpose in life, the same pattern\noccurred in predicting better subjective health across time.\nThese effects underscore that the health advantages of\nwell-being are not restricted to extreme group contrasts\n(high vs low), but also pertain to high versus moderate\ncontrasts, thereby underscoring gradient-like benefits to\nexperiencing PWB.\nAlthough fewer adults showed change in well-being\nacross time, those with declining profiles had negative\nhealth changes (increments in chronic conditions and func-\ntional impairment, decrements in subjective health) com-\npared to adults with persistently high well-being. This\npattern was evident for all aspects of well-being except\nautonomy. Similarly, for all aspects of well-being except\npurpose in life, those with declining profiles had worse\nhealth symptoms over time compared to those with stable\nhi well-being. The overarching message was that mainte-\nnance of high well-being translated to advantaged profiles\nyears later, compared to those who chroni-\ncally lacked well-being, or were declining on well-being\nacross time, or even those with only moderate levels of\nwell-being (effects less pervasive in this comparison).\nFurther analyses addressed whether persistently high\nwell-being was protective of better health among those who\nare socioeconomically disadvantaged. This query extends\nresearch on educational gradients in health (Adler et al.,\nemerging evidence indicates that PWB may serve as a\nbuffer against the adverse health consequents of low educa-\ntional attainment (Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Miller et al.,\ndicted, interaction analyses showed that the typical educa-\ntional gradient in subjective health was reduced among low\neducation adults with persistently high levels of autonomy,\nenvironmental mastery, personal growth, and positive rela-\ntions with others. Similarly, persistently high levels of\nRyff et al. 9\nautonomy were protective against increments in chronic\nconditions and health symptoms among less educated\nadults, while persistently high environmental mastery was\nprotective against increments in health symptoms and func-\ntional impairment among those with low educational stand-\ning. Finally, persistently high levels of self-acceptance\namong the less educated protected against increments in\nfunctional impairment. Thus, extensive interaction effects\nprovided support that persistently high well-being is espe-\ncially protective of better health across time among the\neducationally disadvantaged.\nThe overall pattern of results extends contrasts between\ncumulative advantage and cumulative adversity that have\nlong been prominent in life course research (Alwin and\ndescribed the compounding of strengths over time as the\nMatthew effect, drawn from the biblical passage \"unto\neveryone that hath be given, and he shall have abundance.\"\nCumulative advantage has typically been applied to socio-\neconomic status, where the pluses of greater education and\nincome have been shown to translate to progressively\ngreater health disparities over time (Mirowsky and Ross,\ncumulative advantage differently--namely, in terms of\nPWB, which was found to be largely stable over time.\nUnderscoring varieties of stability, some individuals\nshowed persistently high levels of autonomy, mastery,\nself-acceptance, and so on, across time, while others\nrevealed persistently low, or moderate, levels of well-\nbeing. Fewer respondents evidenced gains or losses in\ntheir well-being over time. After controlling for baseline\nlevels in health, the central message was that unfolding\nprofiles of subjective health, chronic conditions, health\nsymptoms, and functional impairment were better among\nthose who enjoyed persistently high well-being across\ntime. Pushing the query further, interaction effects showed\nthe protective influence of persistently high well-being\namong educationally disadvantaged individuals known to\nhave greater risk of subsequent health decline.\nThis investigation has several limitations. First, selec-\ntive attrition is in the background of any longitudinal\ninvestigation: those present at the second wave of MIDUS\nwere in better health and had higher educational standing\ncompared to their baseline counterparts who dropped out\n(Radler and Ryff, 2010). This selection bias suggests that\nresults may have been stronger (particularly the interac-\ntion analyses) had more disadvantaged individuals\nremained in the longitudinal follow-up. Second, only two\ntime points were assessed, and they were common for\nmeasuring both well-being and health. Although the 9- to\n10-year lag constitutes a notable advance over short-term\nefforts to link well-being to future health (e.g. Su et al.,\n2014), the possibility that cross-time changes in health\ncould also be affecting unfolding profiles of well-being\ncannot be fully ruled out. That said, the choice to use\ncumulative well-being as a predictor of changing health\nstatus was strengthened by the fact that well-being was\nlargely stable across time, while health status on average\nwas declining. In addition, comparative analyses clarified\nthat far more variance in outcomes was explained using\ncumulative profiles of well-being to predict health than\nusing baseline health to predict subsequent changes in\nwell-being. Third, although cumulative indices of well-\nbeing accounted for more variance in cross-time health\nthan baseline well-being, the variance accounted for after\nadjusting for initial (Time 1) health status was limited.\nSimilar small effect sizes have been noted in other studies\nwhere psychological characteristics (e.g. traits, positive\naffect) have been used to predict major life outcomes,\nsuch as socioeconomic standing (Roberts et al., 2007), as\nwell as morbidity and mortality (Chapman et al., 2010;\nThe accompanying argument is that practical significance\nmay nonetheless be evident.\nPractical significance may be particularly true for PWB\nwhere mounting research documents that it is protective\nagainst Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment\n(Boyle et al., 2010a), functional cognitive decline in the\nface of organic pathology in the brain (Boyle et al., 2012),\nstroke (Kim et al., 2013b), myocardial infarction (Kim\nTuriano, 2014). Other work is explicating the neural cir-\ncuitry, showing that those with higher well-being are slower\nto evaluate negative stimuli and have reduced amygdala\nactivation (Van Reekum et al., 2007). Those with high pur-\npose in life have also shown better recovery profiles after\nemotional provocation in the laboratory (Schaefer et al.,\n2013), while overall well-being has been linked with sus-\ntained activation of reward circuitry (e.g. ventral striatum)\nwhen viewing positive stimuli as well as lower cortisol out-\nIn light of the above evidence, an important question is\nwhat can be done to enhance experiences of PWB for\ngreater segments of the population. The cross-time stability\nin reported well-being may suggest a kind of fatalism\nwherein some are blessed with high well-being over time,\nand others not. This interpretation is challenged by clinical\napplications and educational interventions that have grown\nup around PWB (see Ryff (2014) for a review). Such work\ndocuments that even among those who suffer from chronic\nmajor depression or anxiety, recovery from emotional dis-\ntress can be achieved and sustained over the long term by\npromoting experiences of well-being (Fava et al., 1998,\nand Ryff, in press). Thus, those with low well-being are not\ninherently disadvantaged and doomed to a life of psycho-\nlogical ill-being with adverse physical health consequents\nlikely to follow. What longitudinal analyses of the sort\nreported herein offer are strategies to identify those indi-\nviduals most in need of such treatments.\n10 Health Psychology Open \nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe MIDUS I study (Midlife in the United States) was supported\nby the John D. and Catherine T.
