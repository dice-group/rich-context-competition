Robinson, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, and approved December 15, 2010 (received for review August 6, 2010)\nIt is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans\nwho have similar characteristics, but it is unclear whether this\ntendency has consequences for the distribution of genotypes in\na population. Although geneticists have shown that populations\ntend to stratify genetically, this process results from geographic\nsorting or assortative mating, and it is unknown whether geno-\ntypes may be correlated as a consequence of nonreproductive\nassociations or other processes. Here, we study six available\ngenotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps of the\nfriendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we\napply strict controls for population stratification, the results show\nthat one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one\ngenotype is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication\nstudy in an independent sample from the Framingham Heart\nStudy verifies that DRD2 exhibits significant homophily and that\nCYP2A6 exhibits significant heterophily. These unique results\nshow that homophily and heterophily obtain on a genetic (indeed,\nan allelic) level, which has implications for the study of population\ngenetics and social behavior. In particular, the results suggest that\nassociation tests should include friends' genes and that theories\nof evolution should take into account the fact that humans might,\nin some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans\naround them.\nsocial networks | gene\u00adenvironment interaction | indirect genetic effects\nHumans are unusual as a species in that virtually all individ-\nuals form stable, nonreproductive unions to one or more\nfriends. Although people apparently choose their friends freely,\ngenes are known to play a role in the formation (1), attributes\n(2\u00ad4), and network structures (5) of these unions. It remains\nunclear, however, whether variation in specific genes might be\nrelevant to the process of friend selection or, distinctly, whether\nthe process of choosing friends might result in correlated geno-\ntypes between friends. Both processes would have implications\nfor our understanding of population genetics and gene\u00adenvi-\nronment interactions.\nHere, we examine whether or not phenotypic similarity be-\ntween individuals connected in a social network is reflected in\ntheir genotypes. Associations between the genotypes of con-\nnected individuals are known to result from genetic correlations\nbetween mates or as a result of groupings established on the\nbasis of kinship (e.g., matrilineal tribal groupings). Indeed, kin\nrecognition has been shown in a variety of organisms, including\nplants (6), ants (7), and vertebrates (8), and is important for\nstabilizing cooperation and promoting inclusive fitness benefits\nin some species (9).\nHowever, kinship may not be the only basis on which natural\nselection might possibly operate at the group level. For example,\nif genetic differences between social networks (or, conversely,\ngenetic similarity within networks) were found at significant\nlevels among humans, it would enhance the opportunity for\nnatural selection to operate at the level of social groups estab-\nlished on a basis other than kinship. Such associations have long\nbeen postulated in the theoretical evolutionary genetics litera-\nture (10\u00ad13), but there is little extant evidence to support\nthese theories.\nSuch a finding would also have relevance in the growing area\nof indirect genetic effects, wherein the phenotypic traits of a fo-\ncal individual are influenced by genes in the genomes of its\nneighbors. This type of effect has recently been shown in a large\nSNP study in laying hens where it was found that an individual's\nfeather condition is very strongly influenced by the genotypes of\nits neighbors (14). In fact, the number of such genes was an order\nof magnitude larger than the number of genes with a direct effect\nin the focal individual's own genome, and the average phenotypic\neffects of the \"social\" genes were more than two times greater\nthan the genes with direct effect. Interestingly, some of the genes\nwith indirect or associative effects in hens involve the serotonin\npathway, which has also been shown to influence social behavior\nin humans (15, 16). Similar phenomena related to \"social\" fitness\nhave also recently been observed in bacteria (17).\nIn humans, one of the most replicated findings in the social\nsciences is that people tend to associate with other people that\nthey resemble, a process known as \"homophily\" (\"birds of\na feather flock together\") (18\u00ad20). Although phenotypic re-\nsemblance between friends might partly reflect the operation of\nsocial influence (21, 22), genotypes are not materially susceptible\nto change. Therefore, genotypic resemblance could result only\nfrom a process of selection. Such genotypic selection might in\nturn take several forms.\nFirst, correlation in genes may be a trivial by-product of\n\"population stratification,\" resulting from the tendency for hu-\nman groups with low mobility to reproduce with geographically\nproximate mates. Over time, the processes of genetic drift and\nlocal adaptation would cause groups that are geographically\ndistant to develop distinct frequencies of genotypes (23). If\npeople also tend to make friends with geographically proximate\nindividuals, then their genotypes would appear to be more cor-\nrelated within geographically separate groups than between\nthem. Therefore, any attempt to discern whether some other\nselection process is involved in the correlation of genotypes must\nuse very strict controls for population stratification.\nSecond, people may actively choose friends of a similar geno-\ntype. Although it is unlikely that people would observe the actual\ngenotypes of others around them, they could observe their phe-\nnotypes, and these may be influenced by specific genotypes. For\nexample, a person of normal weight may choose to associate only\nwith others of normal weight, and this would cause people lacking\nthe risk allele of the FTO gene [which has been associated with\nobesity (24)] to tend to befriend others with the same genotype.\nSimilarly, people might choose to terminate relationships with\npeople whose weight status differs from their own (25).\nThird, people may actively choose environments they find\nconvivial, environments where they are consequently likely to\nAuthor contributions: J.H.F., J.E.S., and N.A.C. designed research, performed research,\nanalyzed data, and wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

If people tend to choose friends from within\nthese environments (even at random), it would tend to generate\ncorrelated genotypes. For example, individuals interested in, and\ncapable of, long-distance running may be drawn to clubs or loca-\ntions where they have the opportunity to make similar friends.\nFourth, people may be chosen by others or otherwise selected\ninto environments where they come into contact with similar\npeople. For example, the admission process at a university or the\nhiring process in a workplace may select for people with specific\nphenotypes (e.g., cognitive skills) that are influenced by specific\ngenotypes. Similarly, these institutions may get rid of individuals\nthat do not exhibit certain phenotypes after they are admitted, and\nthese phenotypes might also be influenced by genotypic variation.\nIn contrast to homophily, people might also exhibit \"hetero-\nphily,\" that is, they might actively choose to associate with people\nwho are different with respect to some traits (\"opposites at-\ntract\"). It is noteworthy that if there is any substantial negative\ncorrelation between friends' phenotypes or genotypes, this would\nbe unlikely to result from population stratification or from\npeople choosing, or being drawn to, the same environment (as in\nthe case of homophily noted above). Instead, there are two other\nprocesses that might be at work. First, people may actively\nchoose to befriend people of a different type. The classic ex-\nample of this kind of negative correlation at the genetic level\noccurs during mate choice; human beings have a slight prefer-\nence for mates with different HLA types, a process perhaps\nmediated by a chemical signaling mechanism (26). Second, cer-\ntain environments may require specialization. For example, some\nworkplaces may select people with different skills to work to-\ngether, and if these traits are related to genotypes, then people\nmay tend to be frequently exposed to dissimilar people with\nwhom they may have a higher probability of becoming friends.\nResults\nAs noted, genotypes tend to be correlated between people who\nlive physically close to one another because of population\nstratification. However, no work has yet established that, net of\nsuch stratification, there are any genes that are correlated (either\npositively or negatively) between individuals in nonreproductive,\nfriendship unions. To study whether such correlation exists, we\nanalyzed two independent samples with information about\nrespondents' genes and about respondents' friendship ties and\nsocial networks: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health) and the Framingham Heart Study Social\nNetwork (FHS-Net). Add Health allowed respondents to name\nup to 10 friends at each of three waves over 6 y (27), and the\nFHS-Net captured up to two close friends at each of seven waves\nIn Add Health, subjects were genotyped for one marker each\ngenes (Materials and Methods). Figs. 1 and 2 show how genotypes\nfor two of these genes are distributed in the largest connected\ncomponent of the friendship network. Notably, significant clus-\nters of similar genotypes for DRD2 suggest the possibility of\nhomophily, but the substantial absence of any connection be-\ntween individuals with minor alleles of CYP2A6 suggests possible\nheterophily. In SI Appendix, Fig. S1, we show the results of\nsimple Monte Carlo tests that suggest these clusters are unlikely\nto be the result of chance.\nTo evaluate statistically whether or not genotypes are corre-\nlated between friends, we regressed friend's genotype on sub-\nject's genotype (including controls for the age, sex, and race of\nboth subject and friend) for each of the six available genotypes in\nAdd Health (Materials and Methods). We restricted the sample\nto friends who were not related, and we conducted a sibling\ntransmission disequilibrium test (sib-TDT), which includes the\naverage sibling genotype in the model and has been shown to\neffectively control for population stratification (29\u00ad32). Fig. 3\nshows the two genes that indicated significant correlation in both\nthe permutation test and the sib-TDT after Bonferroni correc-\ntion. The TaqI A repeat-fragment length polymorphism in the\ncorrelation (heterophily).\nWe replicated the statistical procedure for these genotypes in\nthe FHS-Net using a TDT that includes parental genotypes to\ncontrol for population stratification (29\u00ad32). Imputed genotypes\nfor DRD2 and CYP2A6 made possible direct comparison with\nthe Add Health results (SI Appendix). Both genotypes, DRD2\nsignificant correlation in the same direction and at about the\nsame magnitude in the FHS replication (Fig. 3).\nDiscussion\nThese results suggest that there is genotypic clustering in social\nnetworks that exceeds what might be expected solely from pop-\nulation stratification. People's friends may not only have similar\ntraits, but actually resemble each other on a genotypic level, even\nat the level of specific alleles and nucleotides.\nIt may seem improbable that two of the six genotypes we test\nshow signs of significant association, given that genome-wide\nFig. 1. This social network figure shows genotypes for CYP2A6 in the\nlargest connected component in the friendship network in the Add Health\nstudy. Each arrow indicates that the receiver was named as a friend by the\nsender; a double-headed arrow indicates both subjects named the other as\na friend.\nFig. 2. This social network figure shows genotypes for DRD2 in the largest\nconnected component in the friendship network in the Add Health study.\nEach arrow indicates that the receiver was named as a friend by the sender;\na double-headed arrow indicates both subjects named the other as a friend.\nstudies often find only a handful of candidate genotypes. How-\never, it is important to remember that the six genes chosen for\ngenotyping by Add Health are those that were already known to\nhave significant effects on human social behavior. We suspect\nthat a genome-wide study would show that many genes in the\nserotonin and dopamine pathway exhibit similar correlation, and\nperhaps genes from other pathways relevant to social behavior or\nneuronal development as well.\nIndeed, the fact that the genes investigated here have also\nbeen associated with certain behavioral and personality traits\nhelps shed light on one possible mechanism for this observation\n(see SI Appendix for more detail regarding the known pheno-\ntypes of these genes). For example, DRD2 has been associated\nwith alcoholism (33) and it is not hard to imagine that non-\ndrinkers may actively avoid alcoholics, or that alcoholics may be\ndrawn to environments that nondrinkers avoid. Less is known\nabout CYP2A6. This gene has been associated with the trait of\nopenness in one study (34), but it is not clear why people who\nscore highly on this trait would tend to associate with those who\ndo not. However, regardless of the causal mechanism, homophily\nand heterophily on a specific allele is especially noteworthy be-\ncause the phenotypes with which these genes are related are\nlikely polygenic (they are affected by many genes) and the genes\nare also likely pleiotropic (they affect many traits).\nWhatever the specific phenotypes that might be involved, the\nsignificant negative correlation in CYP2A6 suggests that genetic\nstructure in human social networks does not arise solely because\nof the tendency of people with similar genotypes to be drawn to\nsimilar environments. That is, the mechanism at play in the asso-\nciation between friends' genotypes (whether homophily or heter-\nophily) may reflect, at least in part, active friendship choice\nby individuals.\nAn important implication of these results is that genetic\nstructure in human populations may result not only from the\nformation of reproductive unions, but also from the formation of\nfriendship unions within a population. This finding implies that\nthere may be a certain amount of omitted variable bias in as-\nsociation studies. For example, a person with a genotype that\nmakes her susceptible to alcoholism may be directly influenced\nto drink. However, she may also be indirectly influenced to drink\nbecause she chooses friends with the same genotype (homophily)\nwho are more likely to make alcohol available to her. If so, then\nan association test between alcoholism and genotype that does\nnot include friends' genotypes would overstate the effect of the\ngenes. In contrast, if she chooses friends with a different geno-\ntype (heterophily), they may be less likely to give alcohol to her.\nIf so, then the inhibitory effect of her friends' genes could\ncounteract the direct effect of her own genes and an association\ntest that omitted friends' genotypes would understate the effect\nof one's own genotype.\nThus, homophily and heterophily in friendships, expressed at\nthe genetic level, may have notable implications for our un-\nderstanding both of the way that our genes can shape our envi-\nronmental exposures and the way that our social environment\nmight emerge whereby a person's genes lead to the selection of\nfriends with certain genotypes, which in turn facilitates or\nmodifies the expression of a person's own genes. The idea of an\nevocative gene\u00adenvironment interaction, proposed more than 30\ny ago, suggests that a person's genes can lead him to seek out\ncircumstances that are compatible with his genotype (2, 36).\nThese circumstances could include not only the social behavior\nof a person's friends, but also their very genes. Such a process\ncould also play out over longer time scales; the human evolu-\ntionary environment is not limited to the physical and biological\nenvironment, but also includes the social environment, which\nmay itself be an evolutionary force (37, 38).\nTo the extent that genes play a role in the formation of non-\nreproductive unions, and to the extent that there is allelic simi-\nlarity in connected but biologically unrelated individuals, this\ncould constrain or facilitate a number of other biological and\nsocial processes, from the spread of germs to the spread of in-\nformation. In some sense, humans might be \"metagenomic\" not\njust with respect to the microbes within them (39, 40), but also\nwith respect to the humans around them. We could possibly view\nan individual's genetic landscape as a summation of the genes\nwithin the individual and those around him, just as in certain\nThere may even be genetic niches within social networks that\npromote or inhibit the evolution of certain kinds of social be-\nhavior. The people to whom we are connected provide important\ncapabilities, from the ability to ward off infections, to the ability\nto exploit or transmit useful information, to the ability to re-\nciprocate cooperative exchanges and thus enhance their payoffs\n(35). For example, some individuals might be \"immune\" to\nwhatever pathogen is spreading in a population not because of\ntheir own constitution, but rather because they have come to\nsurround themselves with others with particular genotypes.\nPersonality traits associated with being a leader, based in part on\ncertain genotypes, might best be matched with those in others\nassociated with being a follower. Or cooperation might most\neasily arise and be sustained within social networks and friend-\nship connections of a particular kind (41). Perhaps genetic\nproperties of friendship groups might confer fitness advantages\nto individuals who choose them.\nMaterials and Methods\nFor our candidate sample, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent Health. Add Health is a large nationally-representative and\npublicly available study started in 1994 that explores the causes of health-\nrelated behavior of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 and their outcomes in\nyoung adulthood. In the first wave, information was gathered from subjects\nin 142 schools about their social networks. Student's were allowed to\nnominate up to five female and five male friends and were then asked more\nspecific details about those friendships.\nIn Wave I of the Add Health study, researchers created a genetically in-\nformative sample of sibling pairs based on a screening of the in-school sample.\nThese pairs include all adolescents who were identified as twin pairs, half\nsiblings, or unrelated siblings raised together. Twins and half biological siblings\nwere sampled with certainty.TheWave I sibling-pairs samplehasbeen foundto\n(homophily)\n(heterophily)\nAdd Health\nFHS Replication\nChange in Friend's Genotype Associated\nWith Each Additional Subject Allele\nFig. 3.

Hence, remaining friends are unlikely to be genetically related.\nAdd Health produced genotype values from saliva samples collected in\nreceptor), DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor), MAOA (monoamine oxidase A-\nuVNTR), SLC6A3 (dopamine transporter), and SLC6A4 (serotonin trans-\nporter). We provide a detailed description of each of these markers and their\nassociated phenotypes in the SI Appendix. DNA samples were genotyped at\nthe University of Colorado, Boulder, Institute of Behavior Genetics. The Add\nHealth study tested the validity of their genotyping protocols using pre-\namplified DNA compared with genomic DNA for 315 individuals from non-\nAdd Health samples, and found agreement in 98.7% of cases.\nWe identified all subject\u00adfriend pairs for which we had genetic in-\nformation, and also race, sex, and age. To reduce the likelihood of false-\npositives caused by population stratification, we conduct a sibling family\ndisequilibrium test, including siblings' mean genotype as a control (30). For\nthe purpose of this test, we only include as controls the genotypes of full\nsiblings and nonidentical twins (half siblings, identical twins, and all other\nrelated pairs are excluded). To test for genetic homophily (positive associa-\ntion) or heterophily (negative association) in Add Health, we regressed\nfriend's genotype on subject's genotype and included both the subject's and\nfriend's age, sex, and race as controls. Genotype takes the value 0, 1, or 2\ndepending on the number of minor alleles. Because some subjects name\nmultiple friends, we use generalized estimating equation regression (43)\nwith clustering within family and an independent working covariance\nstructure. Mean squared error fit statistics show the difference between\npredicted and observed values for the model and a null model with no\ncovariates. Models with an exchangeable correlation structure yielded\npoorer fit.\nBecause we conducted tests on six genetic markers, a Bonferroni correction\nimplies that the threshold for 95% confidence in an association is P = 0.05/6 =\n0.008. SI Appendix, Table S1 A and B, show that three associations between\nsubject and friend genotype are significant at this level, but only two are\nalso significant in the permutation test shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1.\nFor replication of these two candidate associations, we turned to the FHS.\nWe had to make some modifications in our analytic approach, compared with\nthe Add Health data, given the nature of the FHS data collection. In par-\nticular, we used a family-based TDT and we imputed SNPs to match the Add\nHealth loci.\nThe FHS is a population-based, longitudinal, observational cohort study\nthat was initiated in 1948 to prospectively investigate risk factors for car-\ndiovascular disease. Since then, it has come to be composed of four separate\nbut related cohort populations: (i) the \"Original Cohort\" enrolled in 1948\n(n = 5,209); (ii) the \"Offspring Cohort\" (the children of the Original Cohort\ngrandchildren of the Original Cohort), enrolled beginning in 2002 (n =\n4,095). Published reports provide details about sample composition and\nstudy design for all these cohorts (44\u00ad46). As described elsewhere, we col-\nlected information identifying who was connected to whom via ties of\nfriendship (and also ties of marriage, kinship, and so on) (21).\nwas conducted using the Affymetrix 500 K array and an Affymetrix 50 K\nsupplemental array. We had data on additional unobserved genotypes for\n1,345 of the participants from an Affymetrix 100 K GeneChip array, so we\nused PLINK 1.06 (47) to merge the two datasets by subject. We also merged\nthe data with European ancestry HapMap samples from Phase II and\nPhase III.\nWe applied a number of recommended quality control measures to the\ndropped individuals who were missing genotypic information for 5% or\nmore of their available SNPs. High missingness indicates that a problem may\nhave occurred in the genotyping procedure for the individual. Next, we\ndeleted individual SNPs with a missing-data frequency greater than 2.5%.\nThen we eliminated SNPs with minor allele frequency less than 1% because\nlow-frequency alleles are more likely to produce false high-magnitude\nestimates in association tests. Finally, we excluded SNPs that failed a test of\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the 10-6 level. The null hypothesis of this test\nis that the observed genotype frequencies are equal to their theoretical\nexpectations under random mating. A large departure from Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium may be an indication of genotyping errors.\nWe used the SNPs that survived these quality checks to estimate the\npairwise relatedness between every single pair in the sample. Friendship pairs\nthat showed greater than zero percent of their genome identical by descent\nwere removed from the data to ensure that association in friend genotypes is\nnot, in fact, a result of people tending to make friends with family members.\nNone of the candidate genotypes from the Add Health study are available\nin the FHS, but there are nearby SNPs that may be in linkage disequilibrium\nwith the Add Health markers. For CYP2A6 we used the proxy-impute com-\nmand in PLINK to impute rs1801272. This procedure identified nine SNPs in\nresults should be treated with some caution because the INFO score in-\ndicating the goodness of fit for this imputation was 0.697 (scores above 0.8\nare preferred). However, as we will show below, an analysis of rs7251418\n(the unimputed, nearby SNP in highest linkage with rs1801272) also suggests\nsignificant heterophily for CYP2A6.\nidentified two SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with the target SNP,\nindividuals. The INFO score indicating the goodness of fit for this imputation\nAlthough the individuals in the FHS are almost all of European ancestry,\npopulation stratification has been shown to be a concern even in samples of\nEuropean Americans (50). Therefore, we used a family TDT (51) to partition\nbetween-family variance and within-family variance. This test includes the\naverage number of alleles in the mother, father, or both (if known) as\na control for the contribution of between-family variance (b). This value is\nsubtracted from the genotype of the subject, and the coefficient on this\nvariable indicates the extent to which within-family variance (w) is associ-\nated with the dependent variable. Results of these tests are shown in SI\nAppendix, Table S2.\nSummary statistics for the variables in the regressions in SI Appendix, Table\nS1 A and B, are shown in SI Appendix, Table S3. Summary statistics for the\nvariables in the regressions in SI Appendix, Table S2, are shown in SI Ap-\npendix, Table S4.\nsomewhat low, in SI Appendix, Table S5, we show the results of a regression\n(r = 0.30, distance = 12.9 K base pairs). These unimputed results also suggest\nthe existence of significant heterophily (P = 0.04) in the region of CYP2A6.\n"
