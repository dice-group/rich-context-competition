    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study sought to identify barriers and facilitators to delivery of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in schools. Four\nfocus groups were conducted with 28 staff members, from four National Health Service school-aged vaccination (SAV) teams\nin London. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. School engagement and support, and understanding and education\nabout the vaccination (or conversely, a lack of) were identified as both barriers and facilitators. Limited school and team\nresources, fear of the vaccination, and poor consent form return were identified as barriers. Explanations for why some girls\ndo not complete the vaccination series were provided. Individualizing approaches used to promote and encourage the vac-\ncination was identified as a facilitating factor. Optimal delivery of the HPV vaccination program is dependent on school\nengagement and the allocation of time for SAV teams to promote vaccination uptake. Immunization program providers should\nwork with schools to improve understanding and support of the HPV vaccination program.\n",

Forster, PhD1\n Keywords\nhuman papillomavirus vaccines, immunization, delivery of health care, prevention, qualitative research, focus groups, school\nnursing\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually trans-\nmitted virus. Most sexually active adolescents and women\ncontract HPV shortly after initiating sexual activity (World\nHealth Organization, 2014). For the majority of women,\nthe virus will spontaneously clear; however, in some cases,\nit can cause cell abnormalities that can develop into cervi-\ncal cancer (World Health Organization, 2014). Cervical\ncancer is the fourth most common cancer in women world-\nwide (IARC, 2012), and persistent infection with HPV is\nknown to cause almost all cases (World Health Organiza-\nSince 2008, a national publicly funded immunization\nprogram for HPV has been available in the United King-\ndom. This program is commissioned by National Health\nService (NHS) England under Public Health England\n(PHE) guidance and delivered by school-aged Vaccination\n(SAV) or school nursing teams (SAV refers to the child flu;\nHPV; meningitis types A, C, W, and Y; and teenage booster\nSection 7a immunization programs). HPV vaccination is\noffered to all girls aged 12\u00ad13 years (in School Year 8)\nand is primarily offered in secondary schools--although\ncan also be received through community clinics or general\npractice--up to the age of 18 years. The vaccine is free at\nthe point of delivery and is currently administered in a two\ndose series (PHE, Department of Health, NHS England,\n2014). HPV immunization programs have now been imple-\nmented in 64 countries nationally, some of whom have\nbeen delivering the vaccine for over a decade, for example,\nUnited States, United Kingdom, and Australia. The vaccine\nis delivered through schools in 42 countries (Bruni et al.,\n2016). Adolescent boys are not currently included in the\nUK school HPV immunization program (although this is\ndue to change in the future), but men who have sex with\nmen up to age 45 can be vaccinated in sexual health or HIV\nclinics.\nIn the United Kingdom, uptake of the HPV vaccination is\nhigh, with 87% of 12- to 13-year-old girls receiving at least\n1 Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL, London,\nUK\n2 NHS England (London Region), London, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nAlice S.

However, there are pockets of\nthe population who remain unvaccinated, and there is huge\nvariability in uptake between areas; for example, uptake of\nthe first dose in Enfield is 74%, whereas in North Yorkshire\nuptake of the vaccination is suboptimal at 84%, placing it\nvariation in uptake has the potential to widen inequalities in\nHPV-related disease.\nPrevious research has suggested that ethnicity may be an\nimportant factor contributing to lower uptake of the HPV\nvaccination. Girls from non-White British backgrounds are\nless likely to receive the vaccination than White British girls\n(Fisher, Audrey, Mytton, Hickman, & Trotter, 2014; Fisher,\nTrotter, Audrey, MacDonald-Wallis, & Hickman, 2013). For\nWhite British girls had initiated the series, compared to\n89% of those from Mixed backgrounds, 81% from Asian\nbackgrounds, 79% from Chinese backgrounds, and 77%\nfrom Black backgrounds (Fisher et al., 2014). This ethnic\ndisparity has been shown to remain even when controlling\nfor deprivation (Fisher et al., 2014). Parents from ethnic\nminority backgrounds have reported concerns about the vac-\ncine, including a lack of perceived need for it because they\nteach abstinence from sex before marriage to their daugh-\nters, concerns that having the vaccination may encourage\npromiscuity, and believing that 12\u00ad13 is too young to vac-\ncinate their daughter (Forster, Rockliffe, et al., 2017; Mar-\nHowever, other issues affect parental decision-making,\nregardless of ethnicity. For example, concerns about side\neffects, having a lack of knowledge about the vaccination,\nand hearing negative stories about the vaccine from other\nparents have all been reported as affecting the decisions\nabout the HPV vaccination of parents from all ethnic back-\ngrounds (Forster, Rockliffe, et al., 2017).\nWhile we have some understanding of the factors affect-\ning parental decision-making, we have limited knowledge\nabout factors that may facilitate or inhibit delivery of the\nHPV vaccination in the UK school context, which may sub-\nsequently affect vaccination uptake. Of the research that has\nbeen carried out in this area, interviews with nurses high-\nlighted that commitment to the vaccination program from\nschools and school staff has the potential to affect uptake\n(Batista-Ferrer, Trotter, Hickman, & Audrey, 2016). Simi-\nlarly, other studies have cited additional barriers to delivery\nincluding schools not prioritizing the vaccination and\nschools not following up missing consent forms or schools\nbeing unable to help organize the vaccination sessions\nreported barriers include the increasing workloads of immu-\nnization nurses and small team sizes (Brabin et al., 2011;\nHilton, Hunt, Bedford, & Petticrew, 2011).\nThese aforementioned findings are not unique to delivery\nof HPV vaccination, nor to a UK setting. A recent review of\nstudies focusing on the delivery of school based vaccination\nprograms in high-income countries found comparable results\nto those previously reported (Perman et al., 2017); manage-\nment and leadership of vaccination programs at a school or\narea level and interorganizational relationships (e.g., between\neducation and health sectors) were found to be important\nfactors influencing how effectively vaccination programs\nwere delivered. More specifically, however, the review high-\nlighted the importance of strong professional relationships\nand of the commitment and engagement of all school staff\nin influencing program effectiveness (Perman et al., 2017).\nThe competing demands model (Jae\n\u00b4n, Stange, & Nutting,\n1994; see Figure 1) provides a framework of interrelated\nfactors that may create barriers to service delivery within\nthe context of clinical preventive services. The model was\ndesigned to explain the delivery of preventive health ser-\nvices in primary care with a focus on physicians; however,\nconcepts are relevant for understanding other health profes-\nsionals' ability to deliver preventive health care. According\nto the model, the factors that may create barriers to service\ndelivery involve health professionals, patients, and the ser-\nvice environment. The model suggests that lack of time,\nalternative demands, and workload will affect a health pro-\nfessional's ability to deliver a preventive service. Similarly,\nthe service environment may affect delivery due to the way\nin which it is organized, the involvement of other (allied)\nhealth professionals, or the characteristics of the community\nin which the service is set. In the context of HPV vaccina-\ntion, this model may help to enhance our understanding of\nthe way in which the vaccination is delivered in schools and\nof the multiple competing demands placed upon immuniza-\ntion nurses, which may ultimately affect delivery and/or\nuptake of the vaccination.\nIn the UK, there is a distinct lack of research exploring\nissues affecting delivery of the HPV vaccination within the\nschool setting. Of the limited research that does exist, it has\neither been conducted immediately after the introduction of\nthe vaccination, now almost 10 years ago, or not focused\nexclusively on the views of the immunization nurses who\ndeliver the vaccination. Factors affecting delivery may\nchange over time, or as a consequence of changes made to\nthe vaccination schedule, for example, changes to the vac-\ncine offered (from the bivalent HPV vaccine to quadrivalent\nvaccine) and the number of doses required (from three doses\nto two). Nurses' perspectives on delivery may also shed light\non ethnic and geographical disparities in uptake. It is there-\nfore important to assess how the vaccination is being deliv-\nered at this point in time and to identify factors that may be\naffecting delivery of the vaccination, to better understand\nhow uptake may be improved. The purpose of this study is\nto explore the barriers and facilitators to delivering the HPV\nvaccination within the school environment reported by\nimmunization nurses.\n2 The Journal of School Nursing XX(X)\nMethod\nThis focus group study was conducted between February\nand September 2017 in London, UK. Ethical approval was\ngranted by University College London (UCL) Research\nSetting\nIn the UK, all routine vaccinations for school-aged children\nare generally delivered in school by SAV providers or\nschool nurses. This approach has the advantage of facilitat-\ning vaccination of large groups of children at one time (with\nparental consent), rather than children having to individually\nvisit a health provider, resulting in high vaccination uptake.\nThere are 11 SAV providers in London covering 32 London\nproviders for the first dose of the vaccine ranged from 79%\nSample and Recruitment\nFour London-based NHS SAV teams were purposively\nsampled. All members of the four SAV teams were eligible\nto participate, as we wanted participants to contribute a vari-\nety of viewpoints. The SAV teams from which participants\nwere recruited were based in different areas of London, with\nvarying rates of vaccination uptake, to ensure a mix of views\nand experiences. Recruitment was facilitated by collaborat-\ning researchers from NHS England (London) immunization\ncommissioning team (L.R. and a public health registrar),\nwho contacted SAV providers across London, requesting\ntheir participation in the study. Those SAV providers who\nagreed to participate invited their team members to take part\nin the focus groups on our behalf.\nData Collection\nFour focus groups were conducted with SAV team members\nat their place of work. We used focus groups to facilitate\ndiscussion and interaction between participants. It was not\nfeasible to conduct more than four focus groups given the\nworkload and time restraints imposed upon SAV teams.\nHowever, this number of focus groups was deemed suffi-\ncient, as it has been suggested that 90% of qualitative themes\nare likely to be discoverable within three to six focus groups\n(Guest, Namey, & McKenna, 2016). Each focus group com-\nprised participants from the same SAV teams, who were\ntherefore familiar with one another.\nFocus groups were facilitated by two researchers (L.R.\nand a public health registrar) and took place in the partici-\npants' workplace. All participants provided written consent,\nand all sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verba-\ntim. Focus groups lasted an average of 1 hr. Participants\nwere also asked to complete a short questionnaire that gath-\nered information about participants' sex, job title, length of\ntime in current role, and date of qualifying as a nurse/immu-\nnization nurse, if applicable.\nA topic guide was used to direct the discussions and\nfocused on the perceived barriers and facilitators to the\ndelivery of the HPV vaccination in schools (delivery of both\ndose one and two). We used the competing demands model\n(Jae\n\u00b4n et al., 1994) to help develop the topic guide and\nFigure 1. The competing demands model.

For example, prompts covered\ntopics such as workload (related to both the health profes-\nsional and service environment), and knowledge and atti-\ntudes (related to both the health professional and the\npatient). The researchers took detailed notes following the\ncompletion of each focus group and discussed the outcome\nof each session to identify ways in which the facilitation of\nthe sessions could be improved (e.g., by improving interac-\ntions with participants).\nAnalysis\nData were analyzed thematically by two researchers (L.R.\nand A.F.), one of whom had conducted the focus groups.\nInitially, these two researchers each generated codes for\nhalf of the data to develop a basic coding frame. L.R. and\nA.F. next discussed and refined this coding frame before\nusing it to recode all the data using the qualitative data\nanalysis software NVivo 11. Interpretations were made\nby both researchers, and any discrepancies were resolved\nthrough discussion.\nThe results present a summary of the themes derived from\nthe data. Quotes are presented to illustrate the themes and are\nreported with focus group number and participant number.\nAdditional participant quotes can be found in Online Sup-\nplemental Material.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nFocus groups were conducted with a total of 28 participants\nand comprised between 6 and 9 participants in each group.\nParticipants had worked in their respective roles for an aver-\nParticipant job roles included nurse (17) and administrative\nand managerial staff, some of whom were trained as nurses;\nproject officer (2); team assistant (2); administrator (2); clin-\nical lead (1); operations manager (1); project manager (1);\nclinical director (1); and team lead (1).\nSummary of Themes\nSeven main themes emerged from the data relating to issues\nthat were perceived to either hinder or facilitate the delivery\nof the HPV vaccine. Lack of school engagement and support\n(Theme 1) was identified as a barrier to delivery, as was\nlimited school and team resources (2), and a lack of under-\nstanding and education about the vaccination from schools,\nparents, and girls (3). Fear of the vaccination (4) and poor\nconsent form return (5) were also identified as barriers.\nExplanations for why some girls do not complete the vacci-\nnation series (6) were provided. Conversely, facilitating fac-\ntors were identified as the engagement and support of\nschools (1), and good understanding and education about\nthe vaccination (3). SAV teams adopting an individualized\napproach (7) were also identified as a facilitating factor.\nBarriers and facilitators that fall under the same theme have\nbeen reported together.\nSchool Engagement and Support\nParticipants discussed the challenges of engaging schools\nthat are unsupportive and less willing to facilitate the\nvaccination program, particularly larger schools, those\nin more deprived areas, and schools where the head\nteacher does not support the vaccine. Several participants\nfound engaging certain faith schools particularly difficult;\nparticipants experienced issues such as consent forms not\nbeing handed out, alternative covering letters being\nattached to consent forms discouraging vaccination, and\nin a minority of cases, denial of entry into the school.\nParticipants felt that in some schools, the vaccination was\nnot prioritized due to pressures and competing demands\nplaced upon school staff.\nParticipants talked about the reluctance of some schools,\nboth faith and nondenominational, to have the SAV teams\nvisit, and about feeling as though they were viewed as an\ninconvenience. Participants mentioned specific incidents\nwhen schools had been uncooperative by denying them the\nopportunity to carry out catch-up sessions, withholding par-\nental contact information and reluctance to allow teams into\nthe school for more time than the school deemed necessary.\nOne participant commented that some schools merely pay\nlip service to vaccination.\nWhat I'm finding is not all of the areas are, school-wise, sup-\nporting us. [ . . . ] umm, I find that without the support of the\nschools, that makes it a hard job. (FG1, P4)\nConversely, the provision of support from participating\nschools was felt be an important facilitating factor; schools\nthat are on board with the vaccination program, that are\norganized, and communicate well were felt to be easier to\nwork with, and it was suggested that these factors are\nstrongly linked to the number of returned consent forms.\nAt an individual-level, good working relationships\nbetween immunization nurses and key members of staff was\nperceived to be important, as is working with organized staff\nmembers who are persistent and proactive at \"chasing up\"\n(following up) unreturned consent forms. Furthermore, hav-\ning a school nurse available (in private schools), or a coor-\ndinator, was perceived to be helpful, as was the cooperation\nof the school in letting immunization nurses chase up girls\nwho have not returned their forms.\nSome schools [ . . . ] as our relationships gained with them, the\nuptake has got better and how they work in the school with\ngetting these girls ready and getting consent forms for us has,\nlike, increased the uptake. (FG2, P13)\n4 The Journal of School Nursing XX(X)\nSchool and Team Resources\nSchool resources. Allocation of school staff to assist with the\nvaccination was discussed by several participants who felt\nthat this responsibility is sometimes given to staff members\nwho are too busy to undertake such tasks such as heads of\nyear. Furthermore, participants discussed the inconsistency\nof staff members with whom they liaised. Being unable to\nmaintain a relationship with one key member of staff was\nperceived to be problematic; one participant explained that\nwhere good relationships did not exist, it could be difficult\nto encourage school staff to chase (follow up) consent\nforms, to organize vaccination sessions, and to release par-\nental contact information.\nThere's one school that we go into where the receptionist is the\nperson that's getting the children to come down for the vaccina-\ntion session [ . . . ] and they won't release other members of staff\nto be with us during the vaccination session, so we have to allow\nmore members of staff in that school and rely on a person who's\nalready very busy and stressed during that time. (FG4, P28)\nTeam resources. Participants also discussed the pressures\nthey experienced as a team, in terms of their workload and\nthe labor intensity of some of the tasks they have to per-\nform. Several participants described being limited for time,\nwhich affected their ability to fully carry out certain tasks\nsuch as making phone calls to all parents who have not\nreturned consent forms. Having few permanent staff mem-\nbers within the SAV teams and small team sizes were felt to\ncompound these issues.\n. . . doing the session is the easy bit, it's the preparation. It's the\nconsent forms. It's getting the consent forms back, and having\nenough time to triage, `cause no one can write, fill a form in\nproperly. Y'know, they [parents] never answer questions,\ny'know. I spent a day last week making 70 phone calls.\nEducation and Understanding\nPoor education about the vaccine was cited by a number of\nparticipants as a barrier to vaccination. Firstly, it was sug-\ngested that for some parents, and schools, the importance of\nthe vaccination was not paramount enough, which partici-\npants believed was due to a lack of understanding. Partici-\npants felt that negative parental attitudes toward the\nvaccination were often based on poor understanding about\nthe nature of the vaccine. Secondly, participants gave exam-\nples of common misconceptions, which participants felt\ninfluenced parents' decision-making. Misconceptions\nincluded parents believing that the vaccination may promote\npromiscuity, that girls are too young to have the vaccine, and\nthat promoting safe sex practices or abstinence before mar-\nriage will prevent HPV infections.\nSome participants felt that deprivation (a lack of mate-\nrial benefits considered basic necessities in society) and\ndemographic factors affected parents' understanding, espe-\ncially in areas of London that are particularly ethnically\ndiverse and where language barriers exist. Sources of inac-\ncurate information (e.g., some online sources) were also\nhighlighted by some participants as contributing toward\nparents' lack of knowledge. A number of participants felt\nthat the way in which information is delivered is also\nimportant, with accurate information sometimes hindered\nby poor delivery methods; for example, providing informa-\ntion in a lengthy format.\nIt's, that's just an education thing, isn't it? Umm, which, I think\nis, is key, actually. That's where I think there is a massive gap,\nnot just from the parents' point of view, but also from the\nschools' point of view. I don't think the schools really under-\nstand the importance of that vaccine as well as the parents.\nParticipants explained how they support parents with\neducational barriers to become more informed about the\nvaccination by providing information directly over the\nphone and at school open evenings, signposting parents to\ndifferent sources of information and providing them with\nwritten materials such as leaflets. The importance of tailor-\ning both the content and the delivery of information to dif-\nferent audiences was also discussed; the provision of\nculturally sensitive materials (including having materials\nin non-English languages) was viewed as important, as was\nthe tailoring of delivery approaches to the demographics of\ndifferent communities. Several participants discussed the\nbenefits of phoning nonresponsive parents, as it provides\nan opportunity to answer questions, address misconceptions,\nand challenge parents' decision-making.\nAnd often they [parents] will say, you know, it's good to talk\nrather than read the leaflet `cause the questions aren't often on\nthe leaflet that they want to discuss properly . . . . (FG3, P20)\nNormalization and heightened awareness of the vaccina-\ntion were perceived to act as facilitators to delivery of the\nvaccination. Knowing other girls and older siblings, who\nhave received the vaccination, was viewed to be helpful in\nreducing opposition from girls. Knowing someone person-\nally who had been affected by cervical cancer was also\nidentified as a facilitating factor for parents, when making\ntheir decision regarding consent.\nFurthermore, a number of participants discussed how\ngood communication with girls can be used to facilitate\nvaccination. Participants talked about taking any opportu-\nnity to talk to girls about the vaccination and to educate\nthem, as well as calming nervous girls down before the\nprocedure, and dispelling misconceptions and fears. These\napproaches were discussed in addition to more formal\nRockliffe et al. 5\nmethods of communication such as delivering talks and\nengaging in health promotion activities via the schools.\nFear of Vaccination\nParticipants reported that some girls' fears affected their\nwillingness to have the vaccine. Fear was perceived to be\nrelated to the use of a needle, anticipation of pain, or in some\ncases the belief that the vaccine is harmful. The social\nimpact of other girls' negative experiences of the vaccina-\ntion was perceived to heighten levels of fear; it was reported\nthat some girls opt out after realizing other girls have done\nso. Some participants believed that some parents mask their\nown concerns about the vaccine by claiming their daughters\nare needle-phobic.\nSome children will give us all sorts of stories that they've been\ntold or they've heard, erm, some children will just refuse out-\nright because they don't want to have it done [ . . . ] they're\nPoor Consent Form Return\nParticipants explained that parents, girls, and schools can all\ncontribute to low rates of consent form return, which can\nhave a direct impact on vaccination uptake. Participants felt\nthat many parents who fail to return the forms may do so\nbecause they are too busy or time restricted rather than mak-\ning an active decision to reject the vaccination. These par-\nents may be more likely to provide consent if contacted by\nan immunization nurse, helping to address practical barriers.\nHowever, contacting parents can be problematic in itself,\nwith many parents hard to get in touch with. A number of\nparticipants believed that some girls were responsible for\nmissing forms, by not delivering them to their parents or\nfailing to return them to school. Furthermore, disorganiza-\ntion within schools was felt to contribute to the problem, as\nwas having a lack of oversight over the consent form distri-\nbution/return process within the school.\nThey won't even reach home, `cause they [the girls] don't\nwanna have it and they don't want their parent . . . and if there's\nno email that goes home, or anything that makes the parent\naware that that's gonna take place, then they might not even\nsee the consent form. (FG4, P27)\nExplaining Why Some Girls Don't Finish the\nVaccination Series\nA number of suggestions were made to explain why some\ngirls receive the first dose of the vaccine but not the second.\nThese reasons included girls being absent on the day of\nvaccination, having a negative reaction after the first dose\n(e.g., feeling unwell or developing a rash), or having a par-\nticularly negative experience (e.g., experiencing a lot of\npain). Furthermore, participants cited that girls moving\nschools or leaving the country after receiving the first dose\nwas a particular issue in London. Participants also felt that\nsome parents may do more research into the vaccine after\nconsenting to the first dose and then change their mind.\nDelays in delivering dose two means that on occasion deliv-\nered doses will not be included in the uptake figures, if they\nare done in the next school year.\nI think it has to be accounted for a little bit that if the girls leave,\nbecause although we try and find out obviously where they've\ngone to, it's sometimes out of our hands to be able to catch up\nwith that child that's left. (FG4, P26)\nIndividualizing the Approach\nOwing to differences in the ways schools work and in the\nvarying maturity levels of girls, participants emphasized the\nneed for individualized approaches. This was sometimes to\nhelp girls feel more comfortable with the process and\nincluded offering them biscuits or chocolate, playing music\nduring the session, providing magazines for them to read,\nand allowing them to bring a friend along for moral support.\n. . . it's to have a nice, quiet area with, and also an area, when\nyou've got the really nervous ones, where you can take them\nover as well, because those, y'know, don't forget, these kids\nhaven't had a vaccine without their mum for years, y'know. A\nlot of them, y'know, they're mature, but some of them are very\nimmature . . . (FG1, P3)\nOther approaches included providing incentives for the\ngirls (e.g., bracelets, food, pens), running catch-up clinics,\nemphasizing the financial value of the vaccination to the\ngirls, and feeding back to schools on their performance.\nTaking verbal consent was also found to be effective, and\nparticipants from one focus group felt positively about their\nexperience of using electronic consent forms. Several par-\nticipants discussed the different approaches they have used\nto vaccinate girls in schools, which opposed the vaccina-\ntion, including gaining verbal consent from parents over\nthe phone and taking the girls off school premises to vac-\ncinate them.\nParticipants had suggestions for other approaches that\nthey did not currently use that might improve uptake includ-\ning providing schools with monetary incentives, using name\nand shame techniques with poorly performing schools and\ncelebrity endorsement of the vaccination. Going forward,\nparticipants felt that they could have more help and support\nfrom the NHS England/PHE immunization commissioning\nteam as well as backing from local authorities.\nI personally think that if the local authorities were a little bit\nmore driving of the programmes, I think that more of the\nschools would respond better because I think it's okay it coming\nfrom us as a health issue, but it need to come from the local\nauthority, from the education department . . . . (FG2, P11)\n6 The Journal of School Nursing XX(X)\nDiscussion\nThis study sought to understand the barriers and facilitators\nto delivery of the HPV vaccination in schools, using the\ncompeting demands model (Jae\nwork to guide our exploration. Our analysis of focus groups\nconducted with NHS SAV team members identified seven\nmain themes relating to factors that were perceived to either\nhinder or facilitate the vaccination process. Engagement and\nsupport of schools was felt to affect vaccination delivery. A\nlack of resources within the school and within SAV teams\nwas also perceived to act as a barrier. Education and under-\nstanding was perceived to affect parents' attitudes and\nschools' commitment to the vaccination program. Fear of\nthe vaccination and poor consent form return were also felt\nto act as barriers. Participants provided explanations for why\nsome girls do not complete the vaccination series and dis-\ncussed ways in which the SAV teams individualized\napproaches to improve uptake.\nLack of support and engagement of schools participating\nin the vaccination program was perceived to be one of the\nmain barriers to delivery of the vaccination. These findings\nare reflective of issues raised by school nurses in previous\nstudies, who similarly experienced low levels of staff com-\nmitment, cooperation, and prioritization of the vaccination\nConversely, school support facilitated delivery. These find-\nings support Perman et al. (2017) who identified that insti-\ntutional relationships play an important role in the delivery\nof school-based vaccinations, both in the United Kingdom\nand abroad.\nOur findings identified poor education and understanding\nabout HPV and the vaccination as another major challenge\nfor vaccination delivery. Previous research has shown that\nboth girls' and parents' knowledge about HPV and the vac-\ncination is associated with uptake (Bartlett & Peterson,\nhave been found for both groups, in the United Kingdom\nBowyer, Marlow, Hibbitts, Pollock, & Waller, 2013; Dodd\nery, Ostini, & Waller, 2013). Our results lend support to\nthese findings but also identify that low levels of education\nand understanding within the school are additional barriers\nto delivery of the vaccine. The lack of knowledge of school\nstaff about the importance of the vaccination was felt to\naffect levels of school engagement and commitment to the\nvaccination program and is an issue that has not previously\nbeen identified in the literature as a barrier to delivery.\nAlthough participants believed that greater education for\nparents and girls would further facilitate vaccination, there\nis limited evidence that educational interventions for these\ngroups are effective at improving uptake (Fu, Bonhomme,\nCooper, Joseph, & Zimet, 2014). However, the use of edu-\ncational interventions for school staff is a novel suggestion,\nas research has not previously examined the impact of edu-\ncation for this group on uptake of HPV vaccination. This is\nan area that future research could usefully explore further.\nThe use of individualized approaches within the school\ncontext, such as the use of electronic consent forms or pro-\nviding culturally sensitive materials, may also better facil-\nitate delivery of the vaccination. The use of incentives to\nencourage vaccine receipt was also an approach favored by\nsome participants. However, there are ethical concerns\nassociated with incentivizing vaccination (McNaughton,\nAdams, & Shucksmith, 2016), and therefore, incentivizing\nvaccination consent form return instead may be a more\nacceptable method. Financial incentives have shown great\npromise as an approach to use to encourage consent form\nreturn, as a means to increase vaccination uptake, with a\nrecent trial suggesting that it is both practical and feasible,\nto offer such an incentive within the school environment\n(Forster, Cornelius, et al., 2017). Although individualized\napproaches are successfully used by some immunization\nteams, these are not universal approaches. Further consid-\neration is needed about how sustainable such approaches\nmight be and whether these can be developed into workable\nmodels of delivery.\nThese findings must be interpreted being mindful of the\nlimitations of this study. The focus groups comprised team\nmembers who were familiar with one another, including\nsenior members of staff in some cases. Although the estab-\nlished relationships between participants may have facili-\ntated discussion, it is possible that some participants may\nhave been reluctant to voice their opinions on certain topics,\nfor fear of being judged negatively. Alternatively, some\nparticipants may have provided answers that they perceived\nto be socially acceptable within the group, rather than voi-\ncing their own views, and therefore creating a social desir-\nability bias. This may also have been the case given the\ninvolvement of NHS England (London), which commissions\nand monitors performance of SAV services. However, focus\ngroups were conducted by a researcher external to the NHS,\nand participants were reassured that their involvement in the\nstudy was confidential. There may also have been a selection\nbias in those who chose to participate in the study; it is\npossible that some of those who participated did so because\nthey had issues or grievances that they wished to air, there-\nfore providing a potentially skewed perspective of the issues\ndiscussed. A further consideration is that while we believe\nthe findings of this study to be applicable and relevant to\nschools throughout the United Kingdom, some of the issues\nraised may only be of relevance to schools based in London.\nImplications for School Nurses\nOur findings suggest that barriers to delivery of the vaccina-\ntion program may be minimized by nurses or program coor-\ndinators attempting to educate and motivate schools\nregarding the importance of HPV vaccination. However,\nRockliffe et al. 7\nthere is little evidence supporting the best approach to do\nthis, and evaluations of approaches used by school nurses\nneed to be documented to build an evidence base of ways to\novercome barriers to delivery of the vaccination program.\nEfforts to improve consent form return, such as offering\nrewards to adolescents, may also facilitate uptake.\nConclusions\nOptimal delivery of the HPV vaccination program is depen-\ndent on school engagement and the allocation of SAV team\ntime to promote uptake and completion of the vaccination\nschedule. Those providing school immunization programs\nshould work with schools and local partners to improve\nunderstanding and support of the HPV vaccination program.\nFuture research is warranted around the development of\neducational training interventions for school staff, promot-\ning the importance of the vaccination.\nAuthor Contributions\nLR designed the study, collected the data, analysed and interpreted\nthe data, and drafted the manuscript.
