However, the underlying physiologi-\ncal processes that may be contributing to this increased\nrisk of poor behavioral outcomes has not been well stud-\nied. Recent work highlights the importance of studying\nmultiple physiological systems in order to achieve a more\naccurate picture of behavioral functioning compared to\nstudying one system in isolation [3]. In this study we fo-\ncused on the parasympathetic and neuroendocrine sys-\ntems, giving evidence that both are predictive of behav-\nioral regulation later in life [4\u00ad6].\nRespiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is an index of the\nparasympathetic nervous system and is a phenomenon\nwhereby the heart rate shows high frequency variability in\ntime with respiration [4]. High baseline RSA reflects the\nfunctional relationship between the central nervous sys-\ntem and the heart as mediated by the vagus [7, 8] and is\nrelated to neural integrity and readiness to respond to en-\nvironmental stressors [4]. It may be an important predic-\ntor of behavioral and emotional functioning later in life [4,\n9\u00ad11]. Cortisol is one of the hormonal products of the lim-\nbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system. The\nneuroendocrine and parasympathetic systems do not op-\nerate in isolation [12]. Both the neuroendocrine and auto-\nnomic nervous systems are mediated by the limbic fore-\nbrain, hypothalamus and brainstem [13], thought of as the\ncentral autonomic network [14]. This network regulates\nthe parasympathetic nervous system directly and HPA ac-\ntivity via the amygdala. Only one study that we know of\nhas examined relations between baseline cortisol, baseline\nRSA and measures of problem behavior in older children.\nIn this study, children with both high baseline RSA and\nhigh baseline cortisol, or low baseline RSA and low base-\nline cortisol, had low levels of depressive symptoms in 1 of\nthe 4 models tested, while in the other 3 models, children\nwith high baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the\nlowest levels of depression and anxiety [12].\nIn previous work we found that prenatal cocaine expo-\nsure predicted neurobehavioral disinhibition in adoles-\ncents, which in turn was related to the initiation of sub-\nstance use [1]. Neurobehavioral disinhibition is a singular\nmultiproblem dimension involving lack of behavior con-\ntrol and poor emotional modulation that has features of\ndisruptive behavior disorders, affective and anxiety disor-\nders, cognitive impairment, and poor self-control. Here,\nwe examine whether individual differences in parasympa-\nthetic and neuroendocrine functioning predict neurobe-\nhavioral disinhibition and, in turn, drug use and risky sex-\nualbehavioroutcomes.Basedontheexistingliterature,we\nhypothesize that children who exhibit concordance be-\ntween their parasympathetic and neuroendocrine systems\nwill have the lowest levels of neurobehavioral disinhibi-\ntion and, in turn, will initiate the use of substances later\nand have a later onset of age of first sexual intercourse.\nGiven that both drug use and risky sexual behavior out-\ncomes may differ between the sexes [15, 16], we tested our\nmodels separately for males and females.\nMethods\nParticipants\nWe used data from 1,388 participants drawn from the Maternal\nLifestyle Study, a multisite investigation of the effects of prenatal\nsubstance exposure in a longitudinal follow-up from 1 month to 16\nyears. In the present study data were used from the birth visit and\nwhen children were aged 3, 11 and 13 years. Participants were re-\ncruited from Detroit, Mich., Memphis, Tenn., Miami, Fla., and\nProvidence,R.I.,USA.TheMaternalLifestyleStudysampleincludes\nchildren in the following racial and ethnic categories: African\nAmerican (77%), Caucasian (16%), Hispanic (6%), and children\nwhose parents identified other racial or ethnic backgrounds (1%).\nDetails on the enrollment and exclusion criteria are described else-\nwhere [17]. In brief, the families were selected for the exposed group\n(maternal report of cocaine or opiate use during pregnancy or gas\nchromatography \u00ad mass spectrometry confirmation of presumptive\npositive meconium screens for cocaine or opiate metabolites) or the\ncomparison group (maternal denial of cocaine or opiate use during\npregnancy and a negative enzyme multiplied immunoassay meco-\nnium screen for cocaine and opiate metabolites). The exposed and\ncomparison youths were group matched on race, gender and gesta-\ntional age within each study site. Background substances associated\nwith cocaine use (alcohol, tobacco and marijuana) were present in\nboth groups; thus, most participants were polysubstance exposed.\nDownloaded by:\nReadCube\nConradt/Lagasse/Shankaran/Bada/Bauer/\nWhitaker/Hammond/Lester\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board at\neach study site, and written informed consent (from caregivers)\nwas obtained for all participants. Each site had a certificate of con-\nfidentiality from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).\nExaminers were blinded to group status.\nMeasures\nPolysubstance Exposure\nPrenatal substance exposure was measured as a summative in-\ndex ranging from 0 to 5 for use of cocaine, opiates, marijuana, al-\ncohol and tobacco during pregnancy, as previously reported [18].\nMaternal report/meconium screen of drug use (1 = yes, 0 = no)\nprenatally was computed; 1 point was assigned for each substance\nused. Dichotomous measures are frequently used in testing prena-\ntal substance exposure effects [18, 19].\nEarly Adversity\nEarly adversity was a summative risk index assessment from\nbirth to age 3 and included 9 risk factors. Each risk factor was\neither a continuous scale or a count score that was dichoto-\nmized to create an overall risk index (0 = no/none, 1 = yes/1 or\nmore).\nMaternal Report of Postnatal Substance Use\nAny maternal report of postnatal substance use of cocaine, opi-\nates, tobacco, alcohol or marijuana up to the year 3 assessment was\nassessed using the Caretaker Inventory of Substance Use [20].\nChronic Poverty Status\nChronic poverty status was calculated as income below USD\nLow Social Status\nLow social status was scored from the Hollingshead Index of\nSocial Position [21]. Education and occupation were averaged over\nannual visits. Participants received 1 point if their Index of Social\nPosition score fell 1 standard deviation (SD) or more below the\nmean.\nPrimary Caretaker Changes\nThe presence of primary caretaker changes was assessed\nannually.\nSexual or Physical Abuse or Neglect\nCaregivers were interviewed about whether or not there had\nbeen any reports of sexual or physical abuse and/or neglect annu-\nally from the birth to age 3 assessment.\nCaregiver Depression\nChildren received 1 point on the cumulative risk index if assess-\nments of caregiver depression were 1 SD or greater above the mean\nfor averaged depressive symptoms on the caregiver-reported Beck\nCaregiver Psychological Distress\nThis risk item was calculated as present if assessments of care-\ngiver psychological distress were 1 SD or greater above the mean\nfor total psychological symptoms on the Brief Symptom Inventory\nHome Environment\nThis risk item was coded as present if scores fell 1 SD or more\nbelow the mean on the Home Observation Measurement of the\nEnvironment [24] as assessed by a home visitor when the child was\nHistory of Child Protective Services Involvement\nIf the child had any history of Child Protective Services involve-\nment, assessed annually by caregiver report until the year 3 assess-\nment, then 1 point was given on this risk index.\nBaseline RSA\nBaseline RSA was measured at age 3 because of research sug-\ngesting that RSA in early childhood is predictive of later behav-\nioral problems [25, 26]. RSA was derived from the R-R time series\ncollected from digitized ECG recordings using Porges algorithm\nfrom MXEdit [27]. ECGs were recorded via three electrodes\nplaced on the child's chest and abdomen. The ECG signal was\nsampled at 1 kHz and stored on a computer for later scoring. In-\nterbeat intervals were defined by detection of R-waves to the near-\nest millisecond.\nPostprocessing of the data took place off-line by using a series\nof automated algorithms. R-R intervals outside of expected values\nwere identified. Missed or spurious R-waves were flagged and cor-\nrected by linear interpolation. A 21-point moving polynomial was\nthen applied to remove low frequency trends in the HR signal.\nNext, a bandpass filter extracted the variance in heart period with-\nin the frequency band of spontaneous respiration in young chil-\ndren (0.24\u00ad1.04 Hz). This process removes periodicities in the\nECG signal that are outside the frequency range of the respiratory\ncycle. The resulting measure of RSA is in the frequency range of\nrespiration. RSA was computed as the natural logarithm of heart\nperiod variance and reported in units of milliseconds squared and\nis one of several acceptable approaches for calculating RSA [28].\nRSA data were calculated in 30-second overlapping windows and\nthen averaged within each episode (baseline and attention task).\nThe RSA data for an individual was used as long as there was a\n30-second segment with less than 20% of segments identified with\nartifact [29], which is the shortest duration recommended when\ncalculating RSA with children \u00ad 30-second epochs are frequently\nsampled in studies of young children [30\u00ad33]. In addition, small\namounts of artifact can be expected to have a minimal effect on\nmeasures of heart rate variability such as RSA [7].\nBaseline RSA was assessed during a nonchallenge `control' task.\nSpecifically, children played with a toy alone or with an experi-\nat a table. Although this baseline required some attention, which\nmay evoke vagal withdrawal [34], the toy with which the child\nplayed was simple and no task demands were placed on the child\nduring this time.\nBaseline Cortisol\nBaseline cortisol was measured at age 11 because by this age the\neffects of early adversity and prenatal substance exposure may\nhave become biologically embedded to impact the limbic-hypo-\nthalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical response to stress. Further-\nmore, the kind of problem behavior we examined in this study,\nincluding the initiation of alcohol use and risky sexual behavior, is\nmore likely to manifest in adolescence as opposed to childhood.\nBaseline cortisol was collected 20 min before the start of a social\nDownloaded by:\nReadCube\nPhysiology, Neurobehavioral Disinhibition,\nAdolescent Drug Use and Risky Sex\nstress task and involved children filling out questionnaires on top-\nics that were innocuous and familiar to the child from previous\nvisits (e.g. extracurricular activity, ethnic identity and nutrition\nquestionnaires). It took approximately 20 min to fill out these\nquestionnaires. We chose this task before the stress task because\nwe wanted to control for individual differences in the type of activ-\nity the child was engaged in before coming to the laboratory and\nto control for differences in the car ride to the laboratory.\nTo collect the samples, the child deposited saliva through a\nstraw directly into a 2-ml vial. Ideally, the samples were 1.0 ml but\n0.5 ml was accepted if the collection time was over 3 min. The vials\nwere prelabeled with study site, ID and sample type with unique\nbarcodes (provided by Salimetrics LLC). Samples were immedi-\nately placed in a \u00ad20\u00b0C freezer until shipped on dry ice to Salimet-\nricsLaboratory[35]forassay.Allsampleswereassayedinduplicate\nfor salivary cortisol using a highly sensitive cortisol immunoassay\ng/dl and a range of sensitivity from 0.007 to 1.8 g/dl. Mean intra-\nassay and interassay coefficients of variation were less than 5 and\n10% averaged duplicate scores were used in all analyses; 97% of\nparticipants provided the prestress sample between 11:00 a.m. and\n5:00 p.m. to address the diurnal cycle of cortisol that flattens be-\ntweenlatemorningandearlyevening.Theearliestprestresssample\nmation on steroid medications, time of last meal or beverage in-\ncluding dairy or caffeine, and vigorous physical exercise.\nThe raw cortisol values (microgram/deciliter) were positively\nskewed and normalized using a log transformation. Outliers above\nor below 3 SD in all 3 samples and the difference score were win-\nsorized by replacing the value with the value at 3 SD (<1.5% of\ncortisol values were affected).\nNeurobehavioral Disinhibition\nBased on previous work [1, 18], 2 construct scores were em-\nployed to assess neurobehavioral disinhibition at age 13/14. The\nconstruct scores for behavioral dysregulation and executive dys-\nfunction were computed from multimethod, multiagent, validat-\ned, well-established measures. The neurobehavioral disinhibition\nconstruct has good predictive validity, particularly in its ability to\npredict substance use onset, and good construct, discriminative\nand concurrent validity, as well as good test-retest and internal re-\nBehavioral Dysregulation. The behavioral dysregulation con-\nstruct was a composite score of 6 measures of internalizing and\nexternalizing problems: (1) problem behaviors reported by care-\ngivers on the Child Behavior Checklist [37] using the standardized\nT scores for total problem behaviors at age 13; (2) oppositional\ndefiance disorder; (3) conduct disorder; (4) attention deficit disor-\nder; (5) major depression symptom counts reported by the parent\nfrom the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children \u00ad IV [38] at\nage 14, and (6) delinquency summary scores for the number of\nself-reported crimes against people and acts of general delinquen-\ncy and school delinquency from the Things That You Have Done\nThe composite was computed as the average of the 3 indicators\nwith higher scores indicating more behavioral dysregulation.\nCronbach's alpha was 0.80 for the composite score of behavioral\ndysregulation. Using principal components factor analyses, we ob-\ntained a single-factor solution: an eigenvalue of 3.25, explained\nover 50% of the variance.\nExecutive Dysfunction. This was measured with 2 computer-\nized tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automat-\ned Batteries [41] at age 13. There is variability in the indicators that\nresearchers use to measure executive dysfunction as a component\nof neurobehavioral disinhibition. We chose tasks that assess spatial\nworking memory, thinking time and planning, all of which have\nbeen shown to be related to brain areas related to deficiencies\namong children exposed prenatally to drugs [42]. The spatial\nworking memory task is self-ordered and requires the respondent\nto find a `token' in an array of colored boxes; we measured the to-\ntal number of errors in the task. The Stockings of Cambridge task\ninvolves spatial planning, and the respondents must use `balls' in\none display to copy the pattern shown in another display. Thinking\ntime includes 2 trials measuring the time to select the initial stim-\nulus. Shorter times have been related to impulsivity. We measured\nthe total number of correct solutions in the minimal number of\nmoves (reverse scored to indicate executive dysfunction). The\ncomposite score was the average of the 2 indicators rescaled to 0\u00ad1,\nwith higher scores indicating more executive dysfunction.\nSubstance Use\nSubstance use was measured with the Things That You Have\nDone questionnaire yearly from ages 8 to 16. Use of each substance\n(alcohol, tobacco and marijuana) was coded as yes or no (dummy-\ncoded as 1 and 0, respectively); 3 dichotomous variables were com-\nputed based on the subject's report of use at any age: alcohol only,\ntobacco only or marijuana only.\nAge of first sexual intercourse\nAge of first sexual intercourse was reported by the adolescent\nat age 16 using the Adolescent Sexual Behavior Assessment [43].\nThe age the adolescent first engaged in any type of intercourse\n(vaginal or anal with the same or opposite sex) was recorded. Low-\ner levels (compared to higher levels) of this variable indicate that\nchildren were younger when they first engaged in sexual inter-\ncourse.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test pathways\nbetween prenatal substance exposure, early adversity, physiologi-\ncal functioning and our behavioral, drug use and sexual behavior\noutcomes. All predictors were grand-mean centered and assump-\ntions of normality were tested prior to inclusion in the model. As\nour interest was in the concordance between parasympathetic and\nneuroendocrine systems we only present SEM models in which the\ninteraction between baseline RSA and baseline cortisol was statis-\ntically significant. Following Aiken and West [44], interactions\nwere probed at \u00b11 SD from the mean of baseline RSA and baseline\ncortisol using the online-computational tools provided by Preach-\nCovariates\nBecause of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol, we examined wheth-\ner the time of prestress cortisol measurement was correlated with\nthe baseline cortisol value. Time of measurement was not signifi-\ncantly related with the time-specific measurement of cortisol (r =\n\u00ad0.05, p = 0.15). We also examined whether prescription and/or\nnonprescription steroid medication impacted cortisol concentra-\ntions. Steroid use within the last 12 hours was not significantly as-\nsociated with baseline cortisol (r = 0.05, p = 0.16). No one reported\nDownloaded by:\nReadCube\nConradt/Lagasse/Shankaran/Bada/Bauer/\nWhitaker/Hammond/Lester\neating or drinking beverages within 1 h of the baseline sample or\nvigorous exercise within 1.75 h of the baseline sample.\nWe also examined variables that have been shown in previous\nstudies to covary with baseline cortisol and/or RSA. These variables\ninclude child sex, race and gestational age. Race, sex and gestational\nage were not associated with baseline cortisol (all p > 0.13). Race and\nsex were associated with baseline RSA (p < 0.03) so they were in-\ncluded as covariates in our SEM models. We also included executive\ndysfunction at age 9 or behavioral dysregulation at age 9 as covari-\nates. Because males and females may differ with respect to their drug\nuse and risky sexual behavior, we used a multiple group SEM frame-\nwork to test pathways between prenatal substance exposure, early\nadversity, baseline RSA, baseline cortisol, and our outcomes. This\napproach allowed us to examine whether the same structural model\noperatesindifferentpopulations\u00adinthiscaseformalesandfemales.\nResults\nAt age 11, there were 860 children with cortisol data.\nlier), 388 did not participate in the visit at 11 years. A fur-\nther 115 children did not participate in the cortisol reac-\ntivity task due to chronic disability (n = 57), child or par-\nent unable or refusal (n = 14), or technical problems or\nresource limitations (n = 44). Of the 885 who participated\nin the cortisol reactivity task, 22 had an incomplete pro-\ncedure or saliva collection and 3 were excluded because\nthe quantity of saliva was insufficient.\nWe analyzed whether there were differences in prena-\ntal substance exposure or early adversity among children\nwith and without missing cortisol data. No differences\nwere found in exposure to substances prenatally or expo-\nsure to early adversity between children with and without\nMissing data were accounted for using the full informa-\ntion maximum likelihood feature of Mplus, which uses\nall available information from the observed data to pro-\nvide statistically appropriate standard errors.\nOf the 860 total participants, there were 41 youths who\nexperienced no early adverse events and 178 youths with-\nout prenatal substance exposure. Both the prenatal sub-\nstance exposure and early adversity variables are continu-\nous. Inspection of data for outliers revealed that both\nvariables were normally distributed. That the prenatal\nsubstance exposure variable was normally distributed is\nnot surprising given that we oversampled for substance\nexposure in this study.\nModel 1: Executive Dysfunction, Drug Use, and Risky\nSexual Behavior\nIn the first model we examined pathways from prena-\ntal substance exposure, early adversity, baseline cortisol\nand baseline RSA to executive dysfunction and drug use\nand risky sexual behavior outcomes. The interaction be-\ntween RSA and cortisol was statistically significant in fe-\nmales but not in males (fig. 1).

Executive dysfunction, in turn,\npredicted the initiation of alcohol use by age 16 such that\ngreater executive dysfunction indicated an increased like-\nlihood that the child had used alcohol by age 16. Race was\nalso a significant predictor of baseline RSA. Post hoc tests\nrevealed that African Americans had significantly greater\nbaseline RSA compared to Caucasians, Hispanics and\nthose who identified themselves as `other'.\nWe probed the significant RSA and cortisol interac-\ntion at 1 SD above and below the mean for baseline RSA\nand baseline cortisol (fig. 2). Executive dysfunction was\nlower among girls whose baseline cortisol and baseline\nRSA were concordant; that is, if both were high or both\nwere low. Girls with either high baseline RSA and low\nbaseline cortisol or low baseline RSA and high baseline\ncortisol had the highest levels of executive dysfunction.\nThere were no differences in prenatal substance or early\nadversity exposure among these groups.\nModel 2: Behavioral Dysregulation, Drug Use, and\nRisky Sexual Behavior\nIn the second model we examined pathways from pre-\nnatal substance exposure, early adversity, baseline corti-\nsol and baseline RSA to behavioral dysregulation and\ndrug use and risky sexual behavior outcomes.

Greater behavioral dysregu-\nlation, in turn, was related to an increased likelihood that\nthe adolescent had initiated alcohol use by age 16.\nWe probed the significant RSA and cortisol interac-\ntion at 1 SD above and below the mean for baseline RSA\nand baseline cortisol (fig. 4). The lowest levels of behav-\nioral dysregulation were found among boys with both\nhigh baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol.

There were no dif-\nferences in behavioral dysregulation among boys with\nlow baseline cortisol, regardless of their baseline RSA lev-\nels.

The interaction be-\ntweenbaselineRSAandbaselinecortisolpredictedunique\naspects of neurobehavioral disinhibition, separately for\nmales and females. Neurobehavioral disinhibition in turn\npredicted the initiation of alcohol use and age of first sex-\nual intercourse. These results highlight the importance of\nstudying interactions between physiological systems to\npredict important developmental outcomes. They also\ndemonstrate that unique developmental pathways to\nthese poor outcomes may exist separately for males and\nfemales.\nThe interaction between baseline RSA and baseline\ncortisol was predictive of both executive dysfunction and\nbehavioral dysregulation, though in different ways for\nmales and females. Females who exhibited discordance in\nbaseline RSA and baseline cortisol (those who exhibited\nhigh levels in one system and low levels in another) had\nthe highest levels of executive dysfunction. Higher levels\nof executive dysfunction in turn predicted the initiation\nof alcohol use by age 16. The literature examining sex dif-\nferences in executive functioning is small and equivocal,\nthough some research suggests that planning may devel-\nop later for girls than boys [46], which may have made\ngirls in this study more vulnerable to the initiation of al-\ncohol use.\nDiscordance between baseline RSA and baseline corti-\nsol was also found in the one other study that we know of\ninvestigating baseline effects in both the parasympathetic\nand neuroendocrine systems [12]. In this study, both\nmales and females were more likely to exhibit symptoms\nof depression if discordant in baseline RSA and baseline\ncortisol. It is not surprising that children with low base-\nline RSA and high baseline cortisol would exhibit execu-\ntive dysfunction, as this profile is reflective of poor emo-\ntional regulation and greater physiological arousal, both\nof which are associated with poorer performance on ex-\necutive functioning tasks [47]. It is less clear why a pattern\nof high baseline RSA and low baseline cortisol would be\nassociated with executive dysfunction, though it may be\nthat discordance across systems is a stronger predictor of\nexecutive dysfunction rather than the specific pattern of\nparasympathetic and neuroendocrine responding. For\ninstance, in their description of autonomic space, Bern-\ntson et al. [48] note that when the parasympathetic and\nsympathetic nervous systems are reciprocally activated\n(when there is activation in the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem and deactivation in the sympathetic nervous sys-\ntem or vice versa) the organism may be better suited to\ndeal with survival challenges. Perhaps over the long term,\nconsistent with the theory of allostatic load, this recipro-\ncal activation needed to manage challenge may lead to\nwear and tear and subsequent `burn-out' of these systems,\nwhich is observed functionally in this study by poorer ex-\necutive function in girls. In addition, for girls only, great-\ner early adversity was also associated with executive dys-\nfunction. Therefore, the combination of wear and tear on\nboth the parasympathetic and neuroendocrine systems as\nwell as the experience of early adversity may have resulted\nin poorer executive functioning and subsequently the ini-\ntiation of alcohol use by age 16.\nAmong boys, there too existed a significant baseline\nRSA by baseline cortisol interaction, though in boys this\ninteraction was predictive of behavioral dysregulation.\nThis increase in behavioral dysregulation was in turn re-\nlated to initiation of alcohol use by age 16 and lower age\nof first sexual intercourse. Again, the literature on sex dif-\nferences in behavior control and substance use is small\nand equivocal. In one study, the relation between behav-\nioral regulation (in the form of self-restraint) and sub-\nstance use was stronger for boys than girls [49], though in\nanother study this effect was stronger in girls [50]. Some\nliterature, however, suggests that girls mature more\nquickly than boys in the domain of behavioral regulation,\nsuch that by age 11 it may be that the boys who have not\n`caught up' with the girls are at increased risk of initiating\nalcohol use and engaging in risky sexual behavior. It is\ninteresting to note that behavioral dysregulation at age 9\nwas associated with behavioral dysregulation at age 13 in\nmales but not in females, suggesting that this cluster of\nbehavioral problems emerges earlier in males, which\ncould also reflect sex differences in maturation.\nThe interaction between baseline RSA and baseline\ncortisol was significantly predictive of behavioral dysreg-\nulation, though in a slightly different way. Male children\nwith low baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the\ngreatest levels of behavioral dysregulation while children\nwith high baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the\nlowest levels. These findings fit with the hypothesis posed\nby El-Sheikh et al. [12] that poor physiological regulation\nin the form of low baseline RSA and greater arousal in the\nform of high baseline cortisol is a risk factor for poor be-\nhavioral regulation. In this study, we extend previous\nwork as we have found that this profile of physiological\nresponding was related to behavioral dysregulation, while\nDownloaded by:\nReadCube\nConradt/Lagasse/Shankaran/Bada/Bauer/\nWhitaker/Hammond/Lester\nEl-Sheikh et al. found this profile was related to internal-\nizing behavior. It appears as though high baseline RSA\nwas protective in this sample, as high baseline cortisol in\naddition to high baseline RSA was related to the lowest\nlevels of behavioral dysregulation for boys. Importantly,\nthese results replicate those of El-Sheikh et al. [12], who\nfound that this profile was related to the lowest levels of\ninternalizing symptoms. In these models prenatal sub-\nstance exposure was also a significant predictor of behav-\nioral dysregulation. Prenatal substance exposure could\nhave affected the dopaminergic reward circuitry in the\nbrain and nucleus accumbens, affecting behavioral regu-\nlation, cognitive control and impulsivity, all of which are\nrisk factors for the initiation of substance use and engag-\ning in risky sexual behavior [1].\nA number of limitations should be acknowledged. Al-\nthough most of our physiological measures were evalu-\nated before symptom assessments, we still cannot infer\ncausality with these data. Future studies using a cross-\nlagged approach will be helpful in understanding wheth-\ner a physiological process at one point in time influences\nbehavior later in development. Furthermore, it is not\nknown whether baseline RSA and/or baseline cortisol are\nrelated to our behavioral outcomes, over and above the\neffects of baseline RSA and cortisol measured earlier in\nlife. We also did not isolate the effects of a single sub-\nstance, such as cocaine, on our outcomes and instead used\na summary score approach, which may be a more eco-\nlogically valid indicator of prenatal substance use [51].\nWe acknowledge that the mechanism of action of these\ndrugs is different, and we cannot study the relative impact\nof one drug over another. In addition, we chose measures\nof executive dysfunction which have been shown to be\nrelated to brain areas related to deficiencies among chil-\ndren exposed prenatally to drugs [42]. However, there\nmay have been others (such as inhibitory control) that\ncould have been assessed.\nThis study reveals sex-specific pathways to the initia-\ntion of alcohol use and risky sexual behavior through\nparasympathetic and neuroendocrine functioning. These\nresults are important as they suggest that in order to bet-\nter understand which adolescents are more likely to initi-\nate substances and engage in risky sexual behavior we\nshould assess physiological functioning across a range of\nsystems, as opposed to studying them in isolation, as the\ninteraction between the parasympathetic and neuroen-\ndocrine system revealed which adolescents were more\nlikely to engage in these behaviors. Follow-up work\nshould continue to incorporate a multiple-levels-of-anal-\nysis perspective, focusing on physiological data from\nmultiple systems in addition to behavioral and even ge-\nnetic and epigenetic information to arrive at a more com-\nplete picture of who may be at risk for the development\nof substance use disorders and risky sexual behavior.\n"
