We use pooled data to enable us carry out logistic regression analysis at the state level and allow for robustness\nof our results. Our analysis shows wide disparities in both infant and under-5 mortality rates in the six geopolitical zones of\nNigeria and the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. Furthermore, the results show highly significant differences\nin infant and under-5 mortality rates among the six geopolitical zones and among the 36 states of Nigeria. Our result shows\nthat urban advantage over rural areas in under-5 mortality rate only exist among the richest quintiles in Nigeria. We find\nno evidence of statistically significant difference between the urban poorest and poorer quintiles and the rural poorest and\npoorer quintiles in both infant and under-5 mortality in Nigeria. We find wealth, educational attainment of the mother, the\nuse of health facility, religion, gender of a child, and number of births in the last 3 years to be highly correlated with infant and\nunder-5 mortality in Nigeria. Both infant and under-5 mortality rates declined between 2003 and 2008 in Nigeria.\n",

Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney (2006) argued that\nfalling mortality has also meant better health for the living, so\nthat people are also living better, healthier, and longer lives\nthan did their forebears. Their study noted that cross-country\nevidence does not suggest economic growth will improve\nhealth without deliberate public action. Akachi and Canning\n(2010) argued that in addition to the direct welfare gains from\nimproved health, healthier workers tend to be more produc-\ntive. Currie (2009) argued that health in childhood affects\nhuman capital accumulation and health and labor market sta-\ntus in adulthood. Apouey and Geoffard (2013) found housing\nconditions, nutrition, and clothing to have large independent\neffect on child general health. Past studies have found strong\nassociation between mothers' educational attainment and\nreduction in infant and child mortality (Caldwell, 1979;\nCutler etal. (2006) argued that there is a positive relationship\nbetween income and health within countries: low-income\npeople live shorter lives than high-income people in a given\ncountry. They suggested that health inequalities, also known\nas gradients, are part of a wider pattern that relates mortality\nto measures of socio-economic status. They called for further\nstudies on the decline in mortality over time, differences in\nmortality across countries, and differences in mortality across\ngroups within countries.\nAkachi and Canning (2010) argued that the decline in\ninfant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa may have resulted\nfrom medical intervention measures and broad-based reduc-\ntions in exposure to infectious diseases that prevent infant\ndeaths rather than improved nutrition and childhood morbid-\nity. Antai (2010) argued that the rich geographical, cultural,\nethnic, and socio-economic diversity of Nigeria implies that\nimmunization uptake varies between and within geographical\nregions. The study further posits that these differences may\nresult in some segment of children not vaccinated and thus\n1Jackson State University, MS, USA\n2Nigerian Turkish Nile University, Abuja\n3Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nOkechukwu D.

United Nations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF; 2009) reports that west and central Africa region\nhas the highest regional under-5 mortality rate in the world.\nThe report showed that under-5 mortality for west and central\neastern and southern Africa. The literature on infant and child\nmortality rate is robust for developed countries. Houweling\nand Kunst (2010) noted that it is only recently that research in\ninequalities is being studied more systematically in relation to\nlow- and middle-income countries (LMICs). One of the key\nfindings in The National Population Commission (NPC &\nICF Macro, 2009) study showed a wide disparity in under-5\nmortality within Nigeria. The difference between the south-\nwest zone and north-east zone is 2.5 times, 89 deaths per\nlive births in north-east zone. Adedini, Odimegwu, Imasiku,\nOnonokpono, and Ibisomi (2013) argued that residence in a\nparticular region of Nigeria is a major determinant of infant\nand child mortality in the country. Antai (2011) found that the\nrisk of under-5 deaths were almost twofold higher for chil-\ndren of mothers residing in the north-east and south-south\nregions compared with children of mothers in the south-west\nregion.\nHowever, very few studies have focused on the regional\ndifferences in Nigeria with specific emphasis on the role of\nwealth and maternal educational attainment in explaining\ndisparities on infant and child mortality rate. This article,\ntherefore, helps to fill the void that currently exists in the\nliterature by using the demographic and health surveys\n(DHS) data to examine the impact of wealth, education,\nbeliefs, and location on infant and child mortality rates in the\nsix geopolitical regions of Nigeria. It is evident from the rel-\nevant literature above that there is a strong need for an empir-\nical investigation of the source of disparities in infant and\nchild mortality in Nigeria. In Nigeria, most of the decreases\nin infant and child mortality occurred among the rich just as\nmost of the gains in infant and child mortality took place\namong the rich developed countries of the world (UNICEF,\n2012). Nigeria is one of the least successful countries in\nAfrica in achieving improvements in child survival over the\npast four decades (Ngowu, Larson, & Kim, 2008). Several\npublic health policies have been under taken at various points\nin Nigeria. However, the complex nature of the proximate\ndeterminants of under-5 and infant mortality has made it dif-\nficult to ascertain the exact effectiveness of these policies.\nPrevious studies identified location as highly correlated\nwith both under-5 and infant mortality in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. The urban\u00adrural difference in under-5 and infant\nmortality has been documented in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA)\nGiven the diverse geographical and cultural nature of\nNigeria, we propose to study the differences in infant and\nunder-5 mortality among the six geopolitical zones as well\nas the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.\nGiven the above backdrop, we test the hypothesis that dis-\nparity in infant and under-5 mortality rates in the six geopo-\nlitical zones and the different states is correlated with\nmothers' educational attainment, wealth, and location.\nUnderstanding these differences if any will enable policy\nmakers and practitioners to design programs that will effec-\ntively address the high levels of infant and under-5 mortality\nrates that are prevalent in Nigeria. To achieve this, we use\ndata gives us enough data points at the state level for the\nrobustness of the result and generalization from the results.\nThis study marks the first time that infant and under-5 mor-\ntality has been studied at state level in Nigeria, thus contrib-\nuting to our understanding of the differences in infant and\nunder-5 mortality in Nigeria. Past studies have found strong\nassociation between poverty and infant and child mortality\nmortality is systematically and considerably higher among\nlower socio-economic groups within countries.\nMethods\nnature of the survey design of DHS data meant that we apply\nthe sampling weights to correct for the bias in probability\nselection. Logistic regression analysis technique is used to\nexamine the effect of wealth quintiles, educational attain-\nment, geopolitical zones, states, the use of health facilities,\nand urban and rural areas on the probability of infant and\nchild mortality in Nigeria. Using logistic regression tech-\nnique, we are able to obtain the odds ratio of which group has\nlower or higher odds of infant and child mortality in Nigeria.\nThe DHS data used in this study are the children's file data.\nThe model is given by a linear probability model (LPM)\nmeasure of a household experiencing infant or child mortal-\nity. If the household has lost a child before or at the 59th\nmonth, child mortality Y = 1, otherwise, Y = 0. If the house-\nhold has lost a child before or at the 12th month, infant Y = 1,\notherwise, Y = 0.\nY = + + u,\nY is a binary variable that takes the values of 1 or 0. X is a\nvector of independent variables, and  is the intercept term, \nis the vector of coefficients to be estimated while u is the\nerror term. The problem with the LPM is that the error terms\nare heteroskedastic. Also, u is not normally distributed since\nY takes only two values of 1 or 0. The predicted probabilities\ncan be greater than 1 or less than 0. In light of the above\nAnyamele et al. 3\nproblems of LPM, we see the logistic regression as adequate\nfor this study where the outcome variable takes the values of\n1 or 0. Thus we can write the logistic equation to be esti-\nmated as\ni i\n/ -\n( ) = + +\nLogistic regression with multiple predictor variables is\nwell suited for this study. Each of the  coefficient estimated\nis a measure of the expected change in the log odds of a\nhousehold experiencing infant or child mortality for a unit\nincrease in the corresponding predictor variable holding the\nother predictor variables constant at certain value. The theo-\nretical framework of our article is based on the work of\nMosley and Chen (1984) which suggested combining social\nscience and medical science approaches to study child sur-\nvival in developing countries. We make no attempt to distin-\nguish between proximate and distal variables in this study.\nData\nThe sample size for this study is 34,676 households from\nof 886 primary survey units (PSU). The rural population is\nfrom the 2008 DHS data. The zonal composition of the data\nthe sample is from the south-west region of Nigeria. This\nDHS selected participants for the study through probability\nsampling procedures. Pooling data from different surveys\nrequires that we account for the differences in survey years\nand regions. This is achieved by creating a strata identifica-\ntion using year and region as the stratification factor. DHS\nselected participants for the study through probability sam-\npling procedures. It separated urban and rural strata to pro-\nvide valid samples of urban and rural populations at the\nnational level.\nThe DHS surveys were conducted in single rounds with\ntwo main survey instruments: household schedule and indi-\nvidual questionnaire for women of reproductive age 15 to 49\nyears. Whereas the household schedule collects a list of\nhousehold members and basic household demographic infor-\nmation and is used to select respondents who are eligible for\nindividual survey, the individual survey provides informa-\ntion on household assets, reproductive histories, health, and\nnutritional status of the women's young children.\nThe DHS surveys use the following assets and services in\nconstructing the wealth index. DHS wealth index is made up\nof the following items: flooring, water supply, sanitation\nfacilities, electricity, radio, television, telephone, refrigera-\ntor, vehicle, persons per sleeping room, ownership of agri-\ncultural land, domestic servant, and some country-specific\nitems. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used for the\nDHS wealth index. The DHS procedure uses SPSS factor\nanalysis method. First, the indicator variables are standard-\nized by calculating z-scores, then factor coefficient scores\nare calculated for each household's index value. The result-\ning sum is itself a standardized score with a mean of zero and\na standard deviation of one.\nRutstein and Johnson (2004) argued that wealth as a mea-\nsure of economic status has several advantages. It represents\na more permanent status than does either income or con-\nsumption. A pooled model represents data on different coun-\ntries pooled together without regard to differences that may\nresult in different coefficients. Houweling and Kunst (2010)\nsuggested future studies to examine the comparability of the\nwealth indices, and to complement these by measures based\non educational level, ethnicity, geography, and other dimen-\nsions of social position. Wooldridge (2013) stated that an\nindependently pooled cross section is obtained by sampling\nrandomly from a large population at different points in time,\nusually, but not necessarily, different years. Ware (1984)\nconcluded that women who have been to school lose fewer\nof their children in childhood and infancy than their\nunschooled peers. Schultz (1984) concluded that empirical\nstudy of the biological and behavioral determinants of child\nsurvival may proceed in two directions: either to estimate the\nreduced-form unconditional relationships between child sur-\nvival and individual and community level variables that are\nassumed to be exogenous to the many demographic, con-\nsumer, and producer choices a household makes over time or\nto estimate both the demand equations for health inputs and\nthe production function linking health inputs to child sur-\nvival by simultaneous structural equation methods. Child\nsurvival should be viewed as one among many endogenous\nhousehold variables that are modified by economic and\nDescription of Variables Used\nThe categorical and socio-economic and socio-demographic\nvariables used for the multivariate analysis are in Table 6:\nmother's educational attainment (no education, primary, sec-\nondary, and higher), place of residence (urban/rural resi-\ndence), wealth quintiles (poorest 20% is assigned the lowest\nquintile and the richest 20% is assigned the highest quintile),\ngeopolitical regions or zones of six (north-central, north-\neast, north-west, south-east, south-south, and south-west),\nreligion (Christians, Islam, Traditionalist, Other), child sex\n(male or female), birth in the last 3 years, (less than or equal\nto two births, or more than two births), birth order (less than\n4 SAGE Open\nor equal to four or more than four), place of residence (rural\nor urban), and use of health facility (use or not use health\nfacility in the last 12 months).\nStatistical Models\nTable 6 is the multivariate logistic regression that shows the\nodds ratio of infant and child mortality based on mother's\neducational attainment, wealth quintiles, zonal place of resi-\ndence, religion, child sex, number of births in the last 3 years,\nbirth order less than four, place of residence either rural or\nurban, and use of health facility.\nModel 1 is multivariate logistic regression of infant mor-\nmultivariate logistic regression of infant mortality in Nigeria\nplace of residence for urban/rural on infant mortality in\nNigeria in Model 2.

The only geopolitical zone that recorded an\nincrease in child or under-5 mortality in all the zones was the\nnorth-central geopolitical zone. North-central geopolitical\nzone had an increase of 14% in child or under-5 mortality\nrate in her urban areas. Figure 4 is the change in child or\nunder-5 mortality in rural Nigeria among the six geopolitical\nzones. Figure 4 shows south-east geopolitical zone as the\nonly geopolitical zone with increase in child mortality in the\nrural areas of Nigeria.

North-central, north-west, and south-west geopo-\nlitical zones followed in child mortality reduction of 25%,\nTable 1 shows the distribution of risk of infant and child\nmortality in the six regions of Nigeria. Table 1 shows the\nproportion of wealth quintiles, mothers' education, number\nof births in the last 3 years, religion, and other variables that\nexplain the disparities in infant and child mortality in Nigeria\nin the six regions. Table 1 shows that among the poorest\nwealth quintiles, the risk of infant and child mortality is\npared with the south-west region. However, among the rich-\nest wealth quintiles, the risk of infant and child mortality is\npared with the north-east region of Nigeria.\nTable 2 shows the distribution of the risk of infant mortal-\nity in the six regions of Nigeria. The risk of infant mortality\ntiles compared with the richest wealth quintiles in Nigeria.\nThe risk of infant mortality between the poorest wealth quin-\ntiles in the south-west region and the poorest wealth quintiles\ntimes higher for the north-east region. Within the north-east\nregion, we see a very high degree of disparity between the\nrichest wealth quintile and the poorest wealth quintile. The\nhigher for the poorest wealth quintile in north-east region.\nTable 3 shows a similar pattern that we saw in both Tables\n1 and 2.

Also, Table 3\nshows that the risk of child mortality in Nigeria is (8.72/2.94)\n2.97 times higher for those who did not use health facility\nover the last 12 months compared with those who used it\nover the same period. The distribution of risk of child mortal-\nity is almost consistent across the six regions for households\nthat made use of health facilities. However, the risk of child\nmortality between the south-west region and south-east,\nsouth-south, north-central, north-east, and north-west is 1.93\nrespectively.\nTable 4 is the unweighted infant mortality in the 36 States\nof Nigeria and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja.

As\ndiscussed elsewhere, the results are consistent with Figures 1\nEstimation Results\nTable 6 shows the summary of the different logistic regres-\nsions on infant and under-5 mortality rates in Nigeria. Model\n1 is the pooled infant multivariate logistic regression. Model\n1 shows an inverse relationship in infant mortality with pri-\nmary, secondary, and higher educational attainment. However,\nonly higher education is significant in lowering the risk of\ninfant mortality. The richer and the richest wealth quintiles\nshow the risk of infant mortality falling. Compared with the\nnorth-central geopolitical zone as the referent point, north-\neast geopolitical zone has an odds ratio of 1.05. Basically, the\nodds of experiencing infant mortality increase by 5% in\nnorth-east geopolitical zone than in north-central geopolitical\nzone. The odds of infant mortality increase by 2% in north-\nwest geopolitical zone than in north-central geopolitical zone.\nThe odds of child mortality increase by 15% in south-east\ngeopolitical zone than in north-central geopolitical zone. The\nodds of infant mortality increase by 6% in south-south geopo-\nlitical zone compared with north-central geopolitical zone.\nThe odds of infant mortality decrease by 19.2% in south-west\ngeopolitical zone. This is the only geopolitical zone with\nlower odds of infant mortality than north-central geopolitical\nzone among the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria.\nFigure 4.

The odds of infant mortality for\nthose who practice Islam is 5.23% lower compared with those\nwho practice Christian religion. Although this result is not sig-\nnificant, however, the odds of infant mortality is 1.75 times\nhigher for Other religions compared with Christian religion\nand are statistically significant. Table 1 show that female chil-\ndren have higher odds of surviving than male children in\nNigeria. The odds of infant mortality decrease by 13.75% for\nfemale infant compared with male infant in Nigeria. The odds\nof infant mortality increase by 5.1 times for mothers who had\nmore than two births in the last 3 years.\nHigher birth order is positively associated with under-5\nmortality in Nigeria. The odds of infant mortality decrease\nby 83.67% for birth order lower than four. The odds of infant\nmortality decrease by 12.65% for those who use health facil-\nity and the result is highly statistically significant.\nModel 2 is the logistic regression of infant mortality in\nNigeria with place of residence as an explanatory variable.\nThe results are similar to the results in Model 1. From Table\n6 we see that living in urban Nigeria results in lowering the\nrisk of infant mortality by 13.75%. When we examine infant\nmortality in the six geopolitical zones with north-central as\nthe referent zone, we find a similar pattern as in Model 1.\nModel 3 is the logistic regression for child mortality in\nNigeria. As evident in the result, educational attainment is\nnow significant at both secondary and higher level. The signs\nperformed as expected. Both the richer and richest wealth\nquintiles are highly associated with reduction in under-5 mor-\ntality in Nigeria. The odds of child mortality for the richest\nwealth quintile decrease by 37.67% compared with the poor-\nest wealth quintile. The odds of child mortality for the richer\nwealth quintile decrease by 20.05% compared with the poor-\nest wealth quintile. The odds of child mortality increased in\nthe six geopolitical regions with the exception of south-west\ngeopolitical region when compared with the north-central\nAnyamele et al. 7\ngeopolitical zone. The odds of child mortality in the six zones\nof north-east, north-west, south-east, and south-south\npared with north-central zone respectively. The odds of child\nmortality in south-west geopolitical zone decrease by 21.10%\ncompared with north-central geopolitical zone. On religion,\nwe find the odds of child mortality in Nigeria increase by\n22.79% for traditional religion compared with Christian reli-\ngion. The odds of child mortality in Nigeria increase by\n79.74% for Other religion. The odds of child mortality in\nNigeria decrease by 2.81% for Islam compared with Christian\nreligion.\nThe variable representing lower than or equal to two\nbirths in the last 3 years is highly inversely associated with\ndecrease in under-5 mortality rate in Nigeria. The odds of\nchild mortality in Nigeria decrease by 80.71%. Birth order\nlower or equal to four decreases child mortality in Nigeria\nand is highly significant. The odds of child mortality in\nNigeria for female child falls by 11.72% compared with a\nmale child in Nigeria. The variable for health use is signifi-\ncant in explaining child mortality in Nigeria.\nModel 4 is the logistic regression of child mortality in\nNigeria with place of residence included as an explanatory\nvariable. Educational attainment is highly significant in\nreducing child mortality at secondary and higher levels. The\nodds of child mortality in Nigeria decrease by 2.26%,\nand higher education respectively compared with mothers\nwith no education. The wealth variable is highly significant\nfor the richest quintile and barely significant for the richer\nTable 2.

Although the south-east is barely significant at\n10% level of significance, the north-east and north-west\nzones have higher odds of child mortality compared with the\nnorth-central zone and are statistically significant. Only the\nsouth-west zone has a lower odds of child mortality com-\npared with the north-central zone in Nigeria. On religion, we\nsee a similar pattern with the results of Model 3.

The\nresults in Table 6 Models 1 to 4 seem to confirm the high\nproportions in Table 1 of mothers with no education and pri-\nmary education in the three northern regions compared with\nthe three southern regions of Nigeria.\nTable 3.

Higher proportions of the\nricher and richest wealth quintiles are resident in the south-\nern regions of Nigeria compared with the proportion resident\nin the northern regions of Nigeria. The findings in this study\nindicate that the south-west region has the lowest infant and\nchild mortality in Nigeria. Obviously, this is an indication of\nthe fact that more health facilities, social amenities, and edu-\ncational institutions are available in the south-west region\nthan in any other region of Nigeria.\nThese facilities provide an enabling environment that\nreduces the risk of infant and child mortality. Table 1 shows\nthat 70.45% did not make use of health facility, and only\n29.55% used health facility in Nigeria. However, compared\nwith Nigeria, the proportion in the south-west region who\ndid not use health facility to those that used it is almost the\nsame, with those who used it 5.76% slightly higher than\nthose who did not use it (5.60%).

These results are similar to the findings of past stud-\nlogistic regressions of Table 6 on Model 1 show that geo-\ngraphical place of residence is only statistically significant in\nreducing infant mortality in the south-west region of Nigeria.\nFurthermore, this result is similar to the result of Model 2 that\nused urban/rural residence as an explanatory variable. Models\n3 and 4 show that north-east and north-west has higher odds of\nchild mortality in Nigeria.Also, Model 4 shows that the south-\neast region has higher odds of child mortality and it is statisti-\ncally significant only at 10% level of significance. Again, the\nresults from both Models 3 and 4 show that the south-west\nregion has lower odds of child mortality in Nigeria. From\nModel 4 we see that households that live in urban areas have\nlower odds of child mortality than households that live in rural\nareas of Nigeria. This is also the result on infant mortality in\nModel 1 from Table 6. These results are similar to previous\nfindings on rural/urban residence (Anyamele, 2009; Cai &\n2002). The limitation of this study comes from not being able\nConclusion and Policy Implications\nThis study has established strong disparity in infant and\nunder-5 mortality rates between the six geopolitical zones of\nNigeria and in the 36 states. Furthermore, our findings show\nthat urban Nigeria continues to have advantage over rural\nNigeria in infant and under-5 mortality rates. Educational\nattainment, wealth, the use of health facility, and religion\nappear to be strongly associated with both infant and under-5\nmortality rates in Nigeria.\nSome of these findings are in agreement with previous\nstudies on the topic (Adedini et\nThe policy implications of these findings are that policies and\nprograms should be implemented to target poverty alleviation\nin both rural and urban areas of Nigeria. It is also evident\nfrom our results that increasing educational attainment and\nliteracy levels in all the states will greatly reduce infant and\nunder-5 mortality rates in Nigeria. It is obvious from our\nresults that Nigeria continues to have high infant and under-5\nmortality rates. This finding gives credence to previous work\nby (Ngowu etal., 2008). However, the trends show a steady\ndecline in both infant and under-5 mortality rates in Nigeria.\nThe intervention measures in infant and children immuni-\nzation of 2003 in most of the north-west and north-east geo-\npolitical zones seem to have helped in the reduction of infant\nand under-5 mortality rates in the two zones. Such efforts\nshould continue in all the zones of Nigeria.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdedini, S.
