    "abstract": "Abstract\nAfter the Asian financial crisis in 1997, firms listed on Bursa Malaysia were allowed to repurchase their shares on the open\nmarket. The number of companies engaged in share buyback is increasing and has become a tool to stabilize price by signaling\nundervaluation of the share. However, studies on share buyback in Malaysia are limited to the price performance surrounding\nthe buyback events. This study aims to fill this gap by examining long-run price performance after the actual share buyback\nevent over a sampling period of 2 years from 2009 to 2010 for Malaysian firms listed on FTSE Bursa Malaysia. There is no\nevidence to conclude that there exist long-term abnormal returns using the calendar-time portfolio approach that support\nthe inefficient market hypothesis. On the contrary, buy-and-hold method was found to be significant supporting that the\nMalaysian stock market is semi-strong efficient.\n",

Share\nbuyback activities have grown dramatically in the last 30\nyears, and it has become an increasingly important event not\njust in the United States or Europe, but also inAsia. The most\ncommon reason for share buyback is \"undervaluation\" of the\ncompany's shares (Ikenberry, Lakonishok, & Vermaelen,\n1995) and as a more flexible payout mechanism compared\nwith dividends (Jagannathan, Stephens, & Weisbach, 2000).\nThe history of share buyback in Asian markets started in the\nearly 1990s in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and\nTaiwan. In 1991, Hong Kong legalized share buyback\nthrough the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 1991 (Firth\nIn the United States, the volume and value of buyback\nprograms were carried out in the open market and the actual\nbillion in 1996. In Malaysia, the buyback program was intro-\nduced during the financial crisis to boost the market, which\nis in contrast to the share buyback activity in the United\nStates. Share buyback has reduced significantly during the\nof future cash flow, many firms chose to conserve capital by\npulling back on expenditures including share buyback.\nShare buyback has long been authorized in developed\nmarkets such as in the United States and Europe. Research\nhas shown that buyback announcements have positive effects\non the price returns (Dann, 1981; Ikenberry, Lakonishok, &\nlocal market, studies by Jais and Chin (2001) and Lim and\nBacha (2002) are consistent with the findings of more devel-\noped markets. Abnormal returns are also found in the studies\nof actual buyback programs in overseas markets and also in\nIn Malaysia, share buyback was permitted in 1997 in the\nKuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), currently known as\n1University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates\n2University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nMohamed Albaity, University of Sharjah, Sharjah 27272, United Arab\nEmirates.\nEmail: malbaity@sharjah.ac.ae\nImpact of Open-Market Share\nRepurchases on Long-Term Stock\nReturns: Evidence From the Malaysian\nMarket\nMohamed Albaity1 and Diana Syafiza Said2\n Keywords\nbuy-and-hold abnormal returns, Fama\u00adFrench three-factor model, long-term performance, share repurchases, Bursa Malaysia\n2 SAGE Open\nBursa Malaysia Securities (Bursa), due to the depressed capi-\ntal market during theAsian financial crisis. Many stocks expe-\nrienced price declines with the Kuala Lumpur Composite\nJanuary 1998. Companies are allowed to repurchase their\nunderpriced shares to shore up the share prices, hence helping\nto stabilize the weakening market. By buying back their\nshares, the company can reduce the supply of the floating\nshares outstanding so that the share price will be supported or\neven increase eventually.\nHowever in Malaysia, the previous findings are only lim-\nited to the price impacts surrounding the share buyback events\nlong-run price performance after the actual buyback has not\nreceived adequate attention using Malaysian data. Few studies\nlooked at the impact of share buyback on performance and\nindicated that the initial market reaction to the open-market\nshare buyback announcement is incomplete (Ikenberry et al.,\n2013). This suggests that the economic benefits may not be\ncompletely realized immediately, and long-term drifts of\nabnormal returns following the announcement exist. This is\nalso supported by Lakonishok and Vermaelan (1990) who\nfound that the abnormal returns remained after 2 years of buy-\nback execution through fixed-priced tender offers repurchase.\nOther documented empirical evidence of delayed market reac-\ntions to other types of events exists in the form of initial public\nofferings (IPOs; Ritter, 1991), mergers (Agrawal, Jaffe, &\nMandelker, 1992), proxy contests (Ikenberry & Lakonishok,\nsoned equity offerings (Loughran & Ritter, 1995).\nIkenberry et al. (1995) discovered that the long-run abnor-\nmal returns following the repurchase execution are superior in\nthe high book-to-market (BTM) firms, which is 45.3% above\nthe control benchmark, unlike the market reaction to repur-\nchase announcement which is similar across all BTM group.\nZhang (2005) indicated that the price performance after the\nactual buyback varies with a clear and regular pattern across\nthe BTM and firm size groups. This is consistent with a local\nstudy by Wong et al. (2011) using Malaysian data. There is\nincreased participation by small size firms in buyback activities\nin Malaysia because the managers want to signal information\nto shareholders and media about the potential of their firms\n(Ramakrishnan, Ravindran, & Ganesan, 2007). This happens\nbecause there is a wider information asymmetry in smaller\nfirms which results in them delivering superior price perfor-\nmance in share buyback programs compared with bigger firms.\nTherefore, the long-run share price performance follow-\ning a buyback event in Malaysia on the firm size and BTM\nratio should be examined to determine the sustainability of\nthe share price post-buyback based on these factors.\nThis research extends the existing studies by assessing\nthose factors affecting the long-term price performance fol-\nlowing the share buyback. It also investigates the existence\nof long-term abnormal returns following the buyback events\nto determine the effectiveness of buyback as a tool to increase\nand maintain share prices in the long-horizon and to con-\nclude whether share buyback can be part of long-term invest-\nment strategy. The research investigates the long-run price\nperformance of buyback firms compared with the benchmark\nfollowing the actual buyback programs. It then investigates\nthe effect of BTM ratio on the long-run price performance\nsubsequent to the buyback event. Third, it investigates the\neffect of market capitalization on the long-run price perfor-\nmance after the buyback event.\nThis study also attempts to test the relevance of hypothe-\nsized factors that affect the long-term returns after share buy-\nback. Many studies found that small and value firms deliver\nsuperior long-run abnormal returns following the actual buy-\nTherefore, this study will look into the relationships between\nthe market capitalization and BTM ratio with the long-term\nreturns subsequent to buyback.\nLiterature Review\nAn early study of the long-term share price behavior follow-\ning the tender offer repurchases by Lakonishok and\nVermaelan (1990) showed that the repurchasing firms earn\nsignificant positive abnormal returns over 22 months after\nthey found that the positive return is largely contributed by\nthe small firms who experience a significant decline in share\nprices prior to the repurchase. Large firms, however, behave\ndifferently in which they experience positive abnormal\nreturns prior to the repurchase and zero abnormal returns\npost-repurchase. This suggests that tender offer share buy-\nback by large firms may be motivated by corporate restruc-\nturing activities rather than undervaluation.\nIkenberry et al. (1995) reported the same results for the\nopen-market buyback program in the U.S. market from 1980\nto 1990. By using a buy-and-hold strategy, the abnormal\nreturn over a 4-year period outperforms the market index by\n12%. The results also reported that firms with high BTM\nratio earned 4-year abnormal performance of 45.3% with\nrespect to a controlled benchmark and concluded that under-\nvaluation motivates these firms to carry out buyback. Firms\nin the lowest bottom two of BTM quintiles exhibit abnormal\nreturns close to 0 or slightly negative, implying that true\nundervaluation was not the primary motive.\nFurther study done by Ikenberry et al. (2000) on the long-\nterm performance of open-market stock repurchases in\nCanada found that the abnormal return over a 3-year holding\nperiod is about 7% per year. Using a sample from 1989 to\n1997, they also found that high BTM firms experienced\nhigher post-announcement returns compared with low BTM\nfirms and suggests that better long-term performance is\nanticipated from repurchase motivated more by undervalua-\ntion than other motives.\nAlbaity and Said 3\nM. L. Mitchell and Stafford (2000) found evidence that is\nconsistent with Ikenberry et al. (1995) by utilizing the buy-\nand-hold returns approach in the U.S. market. The abnormal\nreturn over a 3-year period is 14.5%. However, their esti-\nmates using the calendar-time portfolio approach produced\nno evidence of long-term abnormal performance.\nGrullon and Michaely (2004) found positive long-term\nprice performance in their study of the actual repurchase.\nfound that 3-year post-announcement abnormal return is\npositively related to the current and future profitability while\ninversely related to the cost of capital.\nChan, Ikenberry, and Lee (2004) found in the U.S. open-\nmarket repurchase program that the long-term result sug-\ngests the market does not fully incorporate the information\nduring the announcement of the buyback. They reported that\nby controlling both size and BTM effects, the abnormal\nreturn over a 4-year period is 23.56%. Chan, Ikenberry, and\nLee (2007) extended their previous study by reexamining the\nlong-run abnormal returns after the open-market repurchase\nannouncements. Using both the buy-and-hold strategy and\nthe calendar-time portfolio approach, they established robust\nand significant evidence of positive long-term share price\nreturn. They concluded that managers possess the timing\nability and that the pseudo-market timing only drives a small\nportion of the return buyback drifts.\nYook (2010) further stratified the firms in the U.S. market\ninto firms with actual repurchase and without actual repur-\nchase after the announcement. Firms with actual repurchase\nexperience significant returns over a 3-year period, whereas\nthe firms without actual repurchase experience negative\nreturns, although not significant. The actual repurchase firms\nare then further broken down into frequent and infrequent\nrepurchasers. The results showed that infrequent repurchas-\ners earn superior returns than frequent repurchasers.\nHong Kong and Japan are two of the very few Asian\ncountries listed in the developed market defined by all five\nmajor financial services firms. Zhang (2005) studied the\nprice performance subsequent to share repurchase of firms\nThe study found that the 3-year buy-and-hold abnormal\nreturn (BHAR), which is benchmarked against a portfolio of\ncontrol firms, is up to 20%. The study concluded that over a\nlong-horizon, there is strong evidence that the value-firm\nmanagers are capable of delivering superior performance to\nlong-term shareholders.\nUnlike in the United States, share repurchase was allowed\nin European countries at a much period due to many concerns\nsuch as creditor protection, price manipulation, unequal\ntreatment of shareholders, and insider trading by the firms\n(Rasbrant, 2011). Sweden was the last country in the European\nUnion to permit share buyback in March 2000. Similar to\nHong Kong and most Asian countries, firms in Sweden are\nobliged to disclose their repurchase activities on a daily basis,\nand they are also required to obtain shareholders' approval to\nauthorize the repurchase programs. These are as opposed to\nthe quarterly disclosure in the U.S. market and direct authori-\nzations by the Board of Directors for the share repurchase\nprograms. The daily disclosure rules may have an impact on\nthe share price as they allow market participants to be notified\nof any buyback activities and related updates more frequently\non a daily basis. Another interesting factor to note about share\nrepurchase in Sweden is that the repurchase volume on the\nrepurchase days is quite large, thus leading to a price support\non the repurchase days. On average, the repurchase volume\nstands at 31% (median 22%) of the total outstanding shares of\nthe firm on the repurchase days. Using data from Stockholm\n6% to 7% positive abnormal performance in 12 months fol-\nlowing the initiation announcement, and this is positively\nrelated to the portion of shares bought back in the program.\nBased on the results described above, it is evident that the\nstudies in the developed markets, especially in the United\nStates where share buyback programs first started in the\n1960s, strongly support the existence of long-horizon posi-\ntive drifts in stock prices for over 3 to 4 years post-announce-\nment and post-repurchase of both the tender offers and\nopen-market share buyback programs.\nAccording to Technical Committee of the International\nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO; 2004),\nAsian countries are bound to more stringent regulations\ncompared with the United States in which firms in these\ncountries must get approval from their shareholders before\nexecuting buyback activities. Taiwan, for instance, requires\nfirms that announce buybacks programs to buy back all the\nintended shares within 2 months, and failing to do so, a letter\nexplaining the cause of failure must be produced to the\nFinancial Supervisory Commission. In Malaysia and\nSingapore, the number of shares bought back by the firms is\nlimited to 10% of the outstanding shares, as opposed to the\nunlimited number of shares that can be bought back in the\nUnited States. In most Asian countries, the daily disclosure\nof open-market repurchase is mandatory whereas it is only a\ndiscretionary in the United States. Taken together, these\nstricter terms could have a different impact on the long-term\nprice performance subsequent to share buyback in Asian\ncountries.\nLee, Jung, and Thornton (2005) conducted a study in the\nunique in such a way that the repurchase program must be\ncompleted within 3 months after the announcement, begin-\nning 3 days after the decision to repurchase by the Board of\nDirectors, unlike the share repurchase program in the United\nStates where repurchases continue for 3 years or more after\ncommencement (Stephens & Weisbach, 1998) or at least 1\nyear in other countries. Their study is aimed to eliminate the\nconfounding effects of ongoing repurchases that could influ-\nence the long-term price performance post-repurchase and\nalso the lagged price response due to repurchase announce-\nment. Another feature of the Korean market is the stringent\n4 SAGE Open\ndisclosure requirements that are mandatory for the repur-\nchasing firms. A repurchasing firm is required to submit\nreports for both planned and completed stock repurchase via\nStock Repurchase Plan and Stock Repurchase Completion\nReport, respectively. The firm also has to state the reason if\nthe repurchase of targeted stock is incomplete. The price per-\nformance results then show evidence of positive abnormal\nperformance in the 3-month period but no evidence of abnor-\nmal performance in the post-repurchase 3-year period, thus\nsupporting the efficient market hypothesis.\nEven though regulation in Korea is in essence similar to\nthat in Taiwan (e.g., the disclosure of the stock repurchase\nplan, the intended percentage of shares to be repurchased,\nand the execution period), a study by Wang, Lin, Fung, and\nChen (2013) showed an interesting result. Using data in\nabnormal daily returns for 6 days surrounding the announce-\nand 19.67% by using the calendar-time portfolio approach,\nthus ruling out the conclusion by Lee et al. (2005) that strict\nregulation is the key factor in resolving investor skepti-\ncism. This finding, however, conflicts with Su and Lin\n(2012), which stated that there is no evidence that the\nrepurchasing firms experience positive and significant\nlong-term abnormal return relative to the matching firms\nwhen using the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and\nbuy-and-hold strategy. By using the calendar-time portfolio\napproach, Su and Lin (2012) also found significantly nega-\ntive return drifts over 12, 24, and 36 months, implying that\nthe repurchased stocks underperformed in the post-repur-\nchase period.\nStudies of share buyback are limited in Malaysia. Jais and\n1998 and reported that announced and implemented buyback\nfirms earned a significant abnormal return of 3.75% over a\n2-day period whereas the announced but not implemented\nfirms earn a statistically insignificant 1.23%. Lim and Bacha\n131 announced companies and reported that announced and\nimplemented buyback firms earned a significant abnormal\nreturn of 2.97% over a 3-day period whereas the announced\nbut not implemented firms earn a statistically insignificant\nabnormal returns experienced by the actual 26 buyback firms\nfor the tender offer share repurchase. Isa et al. (2011) found\nthat, on average, firms earn a CAR of 1.25% over 20 trading\ndays subsequent to the actual buyback. They also reported\nthat there is a general price decline prior to the actual buyback\nday, suggesting that managers tend to time their repurchase\nafter several days of successive price drops. Wong et al.\nover 20 trading days subsequent to the actual buyback. They\nalso found that the abnormal return is affected by the firm size\nand BTM ratio.Arecent study done by Latif and Mohd (2013)\nto investigate the signaling and substitution hypotheses in\nMalaysian firms found that the signaling hypothesis was sup-\nported but not the substitution hypothesis.\nThe study of motivations that drive the implementation of\nbuyback in Malaysia has been conducted by Zainudin and\nRegupathi (2003) who stated that most of the reasons for\nbuyback are to stabilize share price, pay stock dividend, and\nas investment and increase earnings per share. The signaling\nhypothesis, however, is not mentioned in the study.\nRamakrishnan et al. (2007) complemented this by conclud-\ning that managers used share buyback as an effective infor-\nmation signaling tool to the investors.\nThese are empirical studies of share price performance\nsurrounding the buyback events. No study of long-term price\nperformance following a repurchase has been documented in\nMalaysia.\nMethod\nA research framework has been developed based on a review\nof literature to determine whether share repurchase can be\nused to increase the share price in the long run and, therefore,\nbe used as a long-term investment tool.\nThis study covers open-market share buyback programs\nfor all 865 Malaysian firms listed on the Main Market of\nstudy by Isa et al. (2011), the financial crisis period should be\nexcluded from the sample as it may clutter the results. Similar\nstudies in the U.S. market also exclude the financial crisis\nhaving unusual repurchases dominating their studies (Chan\nto Gurcharan, Wong, and Folk (2010), the global financial\ncrisis that started with the U.S. sub-prime mortgage in 2007\nand 2008 led to serious financial challenges globally, includ-\ning in Malaysia. Therefore, open-market share buyback pro-\nconsidered in this study.\nFirms that are not engaged in share buyback programs are\nexcluded from the subsequent study, leaving only a total of\n216 firms taken into consideration. Out of this number, 26\nfirms have been delisted or involved in major restructuring,\nstock split, and dividend distribution within the study period.\nSeven firms in utility and financial services sectors are also\nexcluded from the sample as these firms have different regu-\nlatory settings and are imposed with various requirements\nthat may influence the profitability (Latif & Mohd, 2013;\nLee et al., 2005). Twenty firms with incomplete daily prices\nand financial information are also not included in the\nsample.\nBased on a study by Isa et al. (2011), daily transaction size\nin Malaysia is typically very small, with 98% being below\n0.5% of the total outstanding shares. The sporadic pattern of\nbuyback implementation could be due to the managers being\ncautious in their repurchase strategies and does not project\nAlbaity and Said 5\nmanagement confidence to suggest the undervaluation of the\nshares. To ensure that repurchase implementation presents a\nmeasurable impact financially, only firms that have bought\nback cumulatively 0.5% of their outstanding shares within\nthe sampling period are included in the final sample. Finally,\nfirms studied during the period. Table 1 below shows the\nsampling criteria followed to reach the final sample.\nData such as daily share prices, BTM ratio, and market\ncapitalization for the firms listed on the Main Market of\nextracted out from Bloomberg terminal service and exported\nto Microsoft Excel for further analysis. This includes the\nyield of Malaysian Treasury Bill and the daily prices of\nFTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI), FTSE\nBursa Malaysia (FBM) Small Cap, Morgan Stanley\nComposite Index (MSCI) Malaysia Value, and MSCI\nMalaysia Growth indices for the market return and factors.\nThe information on share buyback dates, volumes, and\nvalues are obtained from Bursa Malaysia's website and\nBloomberg terminal.\nSimilar studies in the emerging and developed markets\ndefine a 3-year period as an appropriate measure for long-\nterm performance (Grullon & Michaely, 2002; Ikenberry\nabnormal return for a multiple event window periods subse-\nquent to the actual share buyback is the dependent variable.\nThe independent variables include the BTM ratio of the\nfirm, which is taken from the nearest announced value prior\nto the actual buyback event and the market capitalization of\nthe firm on the actual buyback event.\nThe hypotheses examined in this study will be tested\nusing the standard event study methodology popularized by\nFama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll (1969) in capturing the price\nreaction to new information. This model was later used by\nsure the abnormal returns surrounding the buyback events.\nBased on the literature and research objectives, the study's\nhypotheses are formulated.\nLakonishok and Vermaelan (1990) reported a significant\npositive abnormal buy-and-hold return over 22 months after\nthe expiration of the offer. The same results are also reported\nby Ikenberry et al. (1995) for the open-market buyback pro-\ngram. By using the same strategy, the abnormal return over a\n4-year period outperforms the market index by 12%. This\nresult is evidence not only in a developed market but also in\nthe emerging market (Wang et al., 2013).\nIn contrast to the short-run method, \"the analysis of long-\nrun abnormal returns is treacherous\" (Lyon, Barber, & Tsai,\n1999). The reality of price over-reaction and under-reaction\nsubsequent to an event seems to point to market efficiency.\nHowever, Fama (1998) pointed out that long-run return\nanomalies, regardless of under-reaction or over-reaction, are\nchance results and, hence, consistent with the efficient mar-\nket hypothesis. The long-run return anomalies will disappear\nif reasonable methods are used. Most previous studies that\nreported positive long-run abnormal returns use the BHAR\nmethod over the CAR, as CAR will produce significant\nbiases as a result of a new listing, rebalancing, and skewness.\nThey also claimed that BHAR is the appropriate measure\nbecause it reflects the investor experience.\nFama (1998) argued against the BHAR method as it suf-\nfers from cross-correlation and bad model problems. He sug-\ngested a monthly calendar-time portfolio abnormal return\n(CTIME) approach as a substitute. This approach was first\nperformance of event-firms' portfolio in calendar-time rela-\ntive to either an explicit asset pricing model or a benchmark.\nLyon et al. (1999) then extended their prior study by com-\nparing BHAR and CTIME, and concluded that both methods\nhave their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of\nBHAR is that it yields an abnormal return that mirrors the\ninvestor experience whereas the disadvantage of this\napproach is its high sensitivity toward the problem of cross-\nsectional dependence among sample firms and a poorly spec-\nified asset pricing model. Meanwhile, the advantage of\nCTIME is that it can handle the cross-correlation problem\nand is less sensitive to the poorly specified asset pricing\nmodel. However, CTIME yields an abnormal return that\ndoes not accurately measure the investor experience.\nM. L. Mitchell and Stafford (2000) also compared the\nreliability of BHAR and CTIME approaches using mergers,\nseasoned equity offerings, and share repurchases. They\nfound that unlike CTIME, BHAR is not an adequate method-\nology as it assumes independence of multiyear event-firm\nabnormal returns.\nThis study seeks to minimize the confounding effect due\nto multiple repurchase programs by a firm within the study\nwindow. The confounding effect will contaminate the clean\nestimation of price performance subsequent to the first repur-\nchase if the firm announces or carry out another new repur-\nchase programs within the estimation period of the first\nrepurchase. The new announcements or actual repurchases\nwould produce the noise effect that is incorporated in the\nTable 1.

Therefore, this\nstudy used both methods carried out by M. L. Mitchell and\nStafford (2000) in using CTIME and also the standard\nmethod, BHAR approaches, to estimate the abnormal return.\nFor the BHAR method, the difference of a sample firm's\ndaily compounded returns and the benchmark daily com-\npounded returns are calculated for three window periods, 1\nactual repurchase day (Zhang, 2005). The BHAR of firm i\nand event date t is defined as follows:\nBHAR\ni t T i t\nt t\nT\nb t\nt t\nT\n-\n( )\n= =\n= +\n( )- +\n( )\n \n, ,\nwhere BHAR\nis the buy-and-hold return of buyback\nfirm i from day t1 to day T. R\ni,t\nis the return of the buyback\nfirm during day t and R\nb,t\nis the return of the benchmark. The\ncalculation of long-term abnormal return can be very sensi-\ntive to the selection of benchmark (Barber & Lyon, 1997;\nWhittaker (2003) proposed a matched-firm benchmark based\non size and industry, for it has lower levels of bias as mea-\nsured by mean squared error (MSE). However, in this study,\nindex benchmark is used based on the firm size. FTSE Bursa\nMalaysia Small Cap Index (FBMSC) is used as a benchmark\nfor firms with a market capitalization of RM1,300 Mil and\nbelow, FTSE Bursa Malaysia Mid 70 Index (FBM70) for\nThe statistical test of BHAR is based on the equal-weight\ncross-average which is calculated as follows:\nt T i t T\ni\nN\nN\n-\n( ) -\n( )\n=\nBy using this alternative approach, an equal-weight portfolio\nof firms is constructed consisting of all firms that have\nimplemented buyback programs within the previous 36\nmonths, supposed a 3-year period of abnormal returns are to\nbe analyzed. Portfolios are rebalanced monthly to include\nfirm that has just executed a transaction and also to exclude\nfirms that reach the end of their 36-month period. The\nmonthly abnormal return earned by this portfolio is defined\nas the portfolio's excess return. As opposed to the BHAR\nmethod in which the abnormal return is calculated from each\nof the event-firms, the excess returns from the CTIME\nmethod are regressed on the three Fama\u00adFrench (Fama &\nFrench, 1993) factors as these are the monthly portfolio\nreturns of the event-firm.\nThe three Fama\u00adFrench (Fama & French, 1993) as\nfollows:\nR R R R s h\np t f t m t f t t t p t\n, , . . ,\n,\n- = + -\n( )+ + +\n  \nwhere R\np,t\nis the portfolio's return in month t; R\nf,t\nis the risk-\nfree rate (3-month Malaysian T-bill); R\nm,t\nis the monthly\nmarket return in month t; SMB\nt\nis the average return on small\nmarket capitalization portfolio minus the average return on\nlarge market capitalization portfolio; HML\nt\nis the average\nmonthly return on high BTM equity portfolios minus the aver-\nage monthly return on low BTM equity portfolios (refer to\nFama and French, 1993, for a detailed description of SMB\nt\nand HML\nt\n). The ordinary least square regression is estimated\non portfolio returns. The intercept, alpha, is the measure of the\naverage monthly abnormal return on portfolios of buyback\nIn the work of Fama and French (1993), the factors of\nSMB and HML are self-constructed. However, in this study,\nmarket portfolios that are readily available in the market are\nutilized to represent the SMB and HML factors. In Malaysia,\nAbdullah, Hassan, Redzuan, Muhammad, and Abdullah\n(2013) used market indices as a proxy for those factors. The\nreturn differential between FBMSC (a proxy for small capi-\ntalization portfolios) and FBMKLCI (a proxy for large capi-\ntalization portfolios) is used as the SMB factor. For the HML\nfactor, this study uses the return differential between MSCI\nMalaysia Value Index (a proxy for high BTM ratio portfo-\nlios) and MSCI Malaysia Growth Index (a proxy for low\nBTM ratio portfolios).\nshare repurchase.\nIn reference to the findings that use CTIME as a method of\ninvolved in the actual share repurchase program will earn a\nvery small insignificantly positive or significantly negative\nlong-term abnormal return. Using those different methods, the\nfirst hypothesis that the study is proposing is as follows:\nHypothesis 1: There are positive long-term abnormal\nreturns of the repurchasing firm as compared with the\nspecified benchmark.\nThe BTM ratio has also been identified as another important\nfactor by local and overseas researchers in determining the\nshare price performance following share buyback programs\nreturns over 4 years, Chan et al. (2004) found that high BTM\ncompanies have larger returns over their matched sample\nnies. Firms with high BTM, or \"value stocks,\" were also proven\nby Hackethal and Zdantchouk (2006) to have outperformed the\n\"glamour stocks\" or firms with low BTM by 45%.\nHypothesis 2: Firms with high BTM ratio experience\nhigher long-term abnormal returns compared with firms\nwith low BTM ratio.\nAlbaity and Said 7\nMarket capitalization has been identified as an important\nfactor by local and overseas researchers in determining the\nshare price performance following share buyback programs\nRamakrishnan et al. (2007) found that information asym-\nmetry which has caused greater undervaluation and mispric-\ning is larger in small firms due to less public disclosure and\nfocus by the analysts as compared with bigger firms. Zhang\n(2005) concluded that smaller firms have higher abnormal\nreturns, which are 0.95% in the immediate response and\n2.78% in 20 trading days after the event as compared with\nHypothesis 3: Smaller firms experience higher long-term\nabnormal returns compared with bigger firms.\nBased on findings that use BHAR as a method of\ncalculation(s), this study suggests that the firms involved in\nthe actual share repurchase program will earn positive and\nsignificant long-term abnormal returns.\nFinally, the information on the firms' share prices, event\ndates, and return model are consolidated and processed in\nEvent Study Metric software to calculate the abnormal\nreturns and to obtain the statistical analysis.\nResults and Discussion\nThe final sample consists of 221 open-market share buyback\nevents carried out by 132 firms listed on the Main Market of\nBursa Malaysia within the study window.\nTable 2 shows the share buyback activities recorded for\n2010. One hundred thirty-two participating firms reported a\ntotal of 221 events of share buyback in the entire study\nperiod. Panel A in Table 2 shows the different repurchase\nevents done by those firms. Half of the firms have a repur-\nchase event within 25 days whereas the rest have more than\nPanel B shows the increase in dollar value of the shares\nrepurchased accordingly. Panel C illustrates that the number\nTable 2.

Many firms may be changing strategy by buying\nback their shares in large amounts per transaction to gain\nmeasurable price support. This is supported by the figures in\nPanel D in which the mean and median of the percentage of\nshares repurchased based on the outstanding shares are also\nincreasing.\nThis table also shows that there is a greater difference\nbetween the median and the mean for Panels B and C. The\nmedian that is less than the mean indicates that the distribu-\ntions are positively skewed and the greater difference\nbetween those values shows that there are several firms in\nthe sample that carried out considerably higher volume and\ndollar value of share repurchase than the rest of the firms in\nthe sample. Panel E also shows positively skewed distribu-\ntions for the market capitalization and BTM ratio of the sam-\nple firms. However, there is a greater difference between the\nmedian and mean of the market capitalization, and this indi-\ncates that the sample contains more small size firms whereas\nbased on the BTM ratio, the sample is practically normal.\nAbnormal returns are computed using BHAR and CTIME\nyears (0, 3) as mentioned in the \"Method\" section. The\nresults for BHAR and CTIME are shown in Tables 3 to 9.\ndaily BHAR for each event is calculated relative to the speci-\nfied market index for the whole sample period of 780 trading\ndays (for a 3-year period) by using Equation 2. The daily\nBHARs for all the events are then averaged to get the daily\naverage buy-and-hold abnormal return (ABHAR) using the\nformula below:\n=\n=\n\nN\ni\nN\ni\n.\nTable 3 shows the long-term price performance for the\nfull sample event-firms calculated using BHAR method for\ndifferent time periods. This result is consistent with Zhang\nmeans returns are not significantly different from 0 at the\nnominal 5% significance level when looking at the p values\nand t values. We can conclude that the first year abnormal\nreturn is only significant at 21% significance level whereas\nthe second year abnormal return is significant at the 22%\nlevel. Overall, this result does not support the under-reaction\nhypothesis, even though the market is seen as adjusting\nslowly from the first year to the subsequent years and the\nlong-term performance is positive.\nFollowing Fama and French (1992), many studies reported\nthat BTM ratio and firm size significantly influence cross-\nsectional stock returns and the subsequent market perfor-\nmance. It is evident that small firms with high BTM ratio are\nthe main contributors to the positive market performance sub-\nsequent to buyback events (Chan et al., 2004; Ikenberry et al.,\nTable 3. Full Sample Post-Repurchase Performance Calculated\nUsing BHAR for Three Time Periods.\nEstimation time period\nNote. BHAR = buy-and-hold abnormal return.\nTable 5. Post-Repurchase Performance Calculated Using BHAR\nfor Three Time Periods Based on Market Capitalization.\nEstimation time period\nNote. BHAR = buy-and-hold abnormal return; MCAP = market\ncapitalization.\nAlbaity and Said 9\nThe sample is then divided into three portfolios, each con-\ntaining 73 to 74 firms according to the BTM ratio as shown\nin Table 4. Assuming the managerial timing exists, this study\nexpects to observe higher drifts for the \"value stock\" who are\nthe frequent repurchasers.\nHowever, the probability that all the abnormal returns\nobtained in this analysis are due to chance is more than 5%\nsignificance level as the p values for all returns are more than\nmonths and 24 months of high BTM firms are significant at\n.1502, respectively. This implies that the empirical results of\nthis analysis are not robust enough to support the hypothesis\nthat high BTM firms outperform the low BTM firms in the\nlong run subsequent to the actual share repurchase, even\nthough the return drifts for high BTM firms is more positive\nand increasing over time, as expected.\nThe full sample is also divided into three subgroups based\non the market capitalization to examine the return drifts\nacross the firm size as shown in Table 5. Literature review\ndiscussed the literature that pointed out that information\nasymmetry is higher for smaller firms. Hence, any new infor-\nmation should give a higher price adjustment. Consistent\ntured in the sample are the constituents of the FBM Small\nCap. Table 5 shows that the abnormal returns for the smallest\nand 36-months holding periods.\nHowever, the probability that all the abnormal returns\nobtained in this analysis occurred due to chance is more than\n5% significance level as the p values for all returns are more\nthan .05 (p > .05). Even though the abnormal return of small\nfirms in the 2-year and 3-year periods are high and positive\nat the 25% level. Nonetheless, the return of large firms for\nTable 9.

This implies that the empirical results of this analysis\nare not robust enough to support the hypothesis that small\nfirms outperform the large firms in the long run subsequent\nto the actual share repurchase, even though the return drifts\nfor small firms are more positive and increasing over time, as\nexpected.\nTable 6 shows the descriptive statistics for abnormal\nreturns using the CTIME approach. The monthly portfolio\nabnormal returns are calculated using Equation 3. Based on\nthe three time periods, the mean, median, maximum, mini-\nmum, standard deviation, and skewness of abnormal returns\nare then obtained from the monthly portfolio abnormal\nreturns.\nTable 7 clearly shows that no evidence of long-term\nabnormal performance was found in the full sample. This\napproach produces negative monthly average abnormal\nreturns for all three time periods and is consistent with Su\nand Lin (2012) who are also using CTIME in their calcula-\ntions. Meanwhile, other studies using the same method, M.\n(2010) found very low monthly average abnormal returns\nrespectively), which is equivalent to less than 3% for 3 years.\nThe data quality for the regression parameters shows that this\nstudy has a slightly decent fit with the data, with the raw R2\nranging from .64 to .68, which implies that the three factors\nexplain 64% to 68% of the abnormal returns. The traditional\nbeta of the portfolio, \np\n, is around .85, which is close to 1 and\nis significant to the 1% significance level, which is expected\nas a typical equity-only portfolio. The SMB loading s = 0.54\nfor the first and second year while s = 0.56 in the third year\nare also statistically different from 0 at 1% level, which\nmeans that the portfolio contains mostly small cap firms (s >\nthe 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. This means that the\nportfolio is a growth portfolio in general (h < 0.3), albeit the\ninsignificant value. The insignificant values for all h-loading\nin all the analyses may be because the portfolio is not signifi-\ncantly affected by the firm's value premium.\nLooking into the 3-year holding period, the alpha value\nindicates a monthly abnormal performance of -0.41% with a\nvery significant t statistic (t = -7.5662). Compounding this\nmonthly return over 36 months implies a 3-year abnormal\nperformance of -13.74%. The monthly abnormal returns are\nalso becoming more negative over the period with strong sig-\nnificant t values. This result suggests that repurchasing firms\nhave severe underperformance in the long-horizon subse-\nquent to the actual share repurchase. Therefore, the long-run\ninvestors cannot benefit from the firms' buyback programs.\nTo check whether the long-term abnormal return is con-\ncentrated in small firms and in \"value firms,\" the sample is\nfurther partitioned into three subgroups based on the BTM\nratio and the firm size. Tables 8 and 9 show the results,\nrespectively. To be consistent with the previous studies, it is\nexpected that only high BTM and small firm groups have\nhigh positive and significant intercepts. This study, however,\nshows negative and significant alpha values instead. Yook\n(2010) confirmed this finding as there is no clear pattern in\nthe occurrence of positive and significant intercepts () in\nboth analyses. In fact, the negative intercepts show a reversal\npattern from the expectation. Assuming a 3-year holding\nperiod, the alpha value for high BTM firms is more negative\nwhereas the small firms group earns a more negative monthly\nabnormal returns (-0.55) in comparison with the large firms\ngroup (-0.27%). Therefore, it is concluded that in this sam-\nple, small firms do not outperform large firms and \"value\nstocks\" do not outperform \"growth stocks\" based on the cal-\nculation using CTIME for all three time periods. These\nresults are also consistent with Yook (2010) and Su and Lin\n(2012) but inconsistent with the results calculated using\nBHAR as demonstrated in Tables 3 to 5. Therefore, based on\nBHAR, there is no evidence of over- or under-reaction,\nwhereas based on CTIME, there is clear evidence of over-\nreaction that leads to negative performance.\nConclusion\nShare repurchase is a relatively new phenomenon in\nMalaysia, and the effects of the actual implementation are\nstill not widely discussed, especially regarding the long-term\nperformance. The purpose of this article is to examine the\nlong-term price performance subsequent to the actual buy-\nback in the Malaysian market. The patterns of abnormal\nreturns are also examined across BTM ratio and firm size.\nThis study has implications for interested parties. Even\nthough Isa et al. (2011) stated that in the short-term share,\nrepurchase can benefit firms and investors in Malaysia, with\nregard to longer horizon, this may not be the case. Lee et al.\nthe total amount of share repurchased provides a significant\nresult of long-term outperformance by the repurchasing\nfirms. At this moment, in Malaysian market, Isa et al. (2011)\nand Wong et al. (2011) found no evidence of abnormal\nreturns with respect to buyback volume. This implies that the\nrestricted amount of shares that can be bought back does not\nprovide strong price support to the stocks. Therefore, the\npolicymakers should look into the restriction and the impact\nit has on firms.\nEven though Ramakrishnan et al. (2007) found an increas-\ning number of small firms participating in buyback activities,\nthere is weak evidence discovered in this study that relates\nthe small and value firms to the superior long-term returns as\ncompared with the larger firms. Thus, although the firms are\nrelatively undervalued, repurchasing shares may not benefit\nthe long-term shareholders.\nOverall, the results of this study provided strong support for\nthe efficient market hypothesis and ruled out the theory of mar-\nket under-reaction subsequent to repurchase announcement by\nusing BHAR methodology. On the contrary, market ineffi-\nciency is supported by the results of CTIME.\nbe taken into consideration as the estimation period of the\nconsecutive years includes the crisis period. This makes the\nsample smaller as the estimation period of 3-year ahead is\nneeded to evaluate the long-term performance. We suggest\nthat the sampling period should be extended to a longer time\nframe to provide a more accurate study.\nAssessment for frequent and infrequent repurchasers can\nbe done to identify whether the frequency of repurchase has\nan effect on the long-term performance. This has been done\nwell as in the Korean market by Lee et al. (2005). They found\nthat infrequent repurchasers earned much better price perfor-\nmance than frequent repurchasers.\nWith respect to the results presented in \"Results and\nDiscussion\" section, some returns anomalies detected appear\nto contradict the expected pattern, for example, the mid-\nBTM return that is lower than the low BTM return. Bhunia\n(2011) obtained the same finding, and he investigated the\nmatter further. He found that earnings growth also has high\ninfluential power on the abnormal returns of the repurchas-\ning firms apart from the BTM ratio. This could be done in the\nfuture research in the Malaysian market.\nSeparate evaluation can also be done by including the cri-\nsis period in the sample, or by separating the crisis and non-\ncrisis period in the results. This is important as during\ndifferent economic conditions, investors may react differ-\nently to information in the market. A firm may experience\ndifferent nature in activities during this period including\nshare buyback. Therefore, external factors should be consid-\nered in the future study to better understand the effect of the\neconomic conditions of the abnormal returns.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbdullah, A.
