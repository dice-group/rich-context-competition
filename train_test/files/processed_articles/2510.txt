The mechanisms theorized to drive that\nassociation suggest that persistent exposure to short sleep should be\nassociated with greater accumulations of body mass. We use prospec-\ntive cohort data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of\nciations between cumulative exposure to short sleep throughout\nadolescence and early adulthood and obesity and elevated waist\ncircumference outcomes. We compare several clinical and distribution-\nbased standards of short sleep to assess which measures are associ-\nated most strongly with body mass. Cumulative exposure to short sleep\nexhibits dose\u00adresponse associations with obesity and elevated waist\ncircumference. Relative to respondents with no instances of short sleep,\nthose who slept \u00c00.50 standard deviations or less than the age and sex-\nspecific average sleep hours in all four waves had 1.45 [95% confidence\n1.02, 2.06) times the odds of having an elevated waist circumference.\nOur findings suggest that cumulative exposure to short sleep during\nadolescence and young adulthood may play an important role in the\netiology of obesity and elevated waist circumference during this\nimportant developmental period.\nINTRODUCTION\nA growing body of evidence finds that shorter sleep durations\namong children and adolescents are associated with higher\nbody mass, adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes\nand unhealthy diets (Javaheri et al., 2008; Kruger et al.,\nresearchers have linked declines in average sleep time\namong US children and adolescents to the increasing\nprevalence of obesity (Calamaro et al., 2009; Chen et al.,\n2008), and others promote additional sleep to help youth\nmaintain healthy weights (Taheri, 2006). However, most\nresearch on the association between sleep and body mass is\nExisting longitudinal studies often focus on young children\nPatel et al., 2006), rather than on adolescents who experi-\nence developmental changes in sleep duration, height and\nweight, and who have growing control over their sleep,\nphysical activity, diet and sedentary behaviours. Further,\nlongitudinal studies sometimes rely on small, regional sam-\nterm exposures to short sleep.\nOur first aim is to examine associations between cumula-\ntive exposure to short sleep duration throughout adolescence\nand early adulthood and body mass outcomes including\nobesity and elevated waist circumference in early adulthood.\nShort sleep duration may be linked to increased body mass\nand adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes through\npathways including hormonal dysregulation (Hitze et al.,\n2008), changes in the quality and quantity of food consumed\nexpenditure (Mcknight-Eily et al., 2011). Each of those\npathways implies that persistent exposures to short sleep\nover long time-periods will be associated more strongly with\nbody mass than short-term exposures.\nLongitudinal studies often use sleep duration at one point\nin time or average sleep duration from several time-points to\npredict subsequent body mass (Agras et al., 2004; Landhuis\nheterogeneity in sleep duration over time. As a result,\nlongitudinal studies find inverse associations between sleep\nduration and body mass among adolescents and young\nadults (Lumeng et al., 2007), although that association is not\nsignificant in several studies (Snell et al., 2007; Suglia et al.,\n2014). We know of only one paper that specifically considers\ncumulative exposure to short sleep. Touchette et al. (2008)\nfind that 5% of children in a representative sample from\nQu\nebec province, Canada are persistent short sleepers\nbetween the ages of 5 months and 6 years; those children\nhave higher odds of overweight and obesity at age 6 than\nintermittent short sleepers. We extend prior research by\nexamining cumulative exposure to short sleep through\nadolescence and early adulthood.\nOur second aim is to explore how various measures of\ncumulative exposure to short sleep duration are associated\nwith body mass outcomes. Standards that distinguish\nadequate sleep from short sleep among adolescents and\nyoung adults are informed insufficiently by a robust evi-\ndence base. Longitudinal studies of children and adoles-\ncents that assess sleep duration with single continuous\net al., 2014) offer little consensus about how much sleep is\nnecessary at different ages to help prevent weight gain and\nobesity. Indeed, Matricciani and colleagues assert: `sleep\nrecommendations are still being issued in the acknowledged\nabsence of meaningful evidence' (Matricciani et al., 2012:\nWe compare multiple standards for adequate sleep. First,\nwe consider the National Sleep Foundation's (NSF) recom-\nmendations of at least 9 h of sleep for those aged 6\u00ad13, at\nstandards derive from expert panels' reviews of the literature,\nbut have not been validated in longitudinal studies of body\nmass. Secondly, we consider a 7-h threshold for adequate\nsleep. Many studies of adults define short sleep as fewer\nthan 7 h per night (Cappuccio et al., 2008; Chaput et al.,\n2008). The NSF report provides a rationale for using the 7-h\nstandard among youth by cautioning that the harm associ-\nated with sleeping fewer than 7 h among children aged 6\u00ad17\noutweighs any benefits, and is `not recommended'\n(Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). Finally, we consider measures\nderived from age- and sex-specific distributions of sleep\nduration in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to\nAdult Health (Add Health)--a nationally representative cohort.\nWe employ prospective cohort data from all four waves of\nage = 28.8). In wave 1, Add Health conducted brief inter-\nviews with a nationally representative sample of more than\nthen selected a much smaller subsample for detailed\nlongitudinal follow-up (Chantala, 2006). Add Health conducts\nphysical examinations of adolescents, as well as in-home\nsurveys with parents and adolescents, on topics including\nhealth, academics, romantic and friend relationships, employ-\nment and family formation. Our analyses focus on the 14 800\nwave 4, and their data from prior survey waves. The\nresponse rate for eligible respondents was more than 77%\nin each wave, but retention was reduced temporarily by the\nintentional exclusion of high school seniors in wave 1 from\nwave 2. Wave 4 data were reweighted to be nationally\nOutcome variables\nOutcome variables are measured in wave 4 (Entzel et al.,\n2009). Body mass index (BMI) is calculated from measured\nheights and weights, and is dichotomized as obese\nence is measured at the superior border of the iliac crest, and\nis dichotomized as those who are at or above the 75th\npercentile, by gender, and those who are below the 75th\npercentile. We estimate the 75th percentile of waist circum-\nference separately for Asians and non-Asians (Grundy et al.,\n2005). Models that predict waist circumference also adjust for\nheight at wave 4. We dichotomized the body mass measures\nbecause we sought body mass thresholds that have estab-\nlished associations with adverse outcomes.\nCumulative short sleep duration\nSleep duration is self-reported. In waves 1 and 2, respon-\ndents report their usual sleep duration in hours. In waves 3\nand 4, respondents report the hour and minute they usually\ngo to sleep and then awake on (a) days that they attend work\nor school-related activities (`weekdays') and (b) days that\nthey do not have to wake up at a certain time (`weekends').\nWe multiply sleep hours on weekdays by 5/7 and on\nweekends by 2/7, and then add the resulting figures to\ncreate a daily weighted average of usual sleep hours. Waves\n3 and 4 data yield negative sleep hours or implausibly high\nsleep hours (e.g. 16+ h) for 3 and 5% of respondents,\nrespectively. Most misreports occur among respondents who\nreport `12' as the hour of waking or sleep onset, suggesting\n(midnight). By correcting these misreports, we obtain similar\ncorrelations in sleep hours across each pair of consecutive\nwaves.\nWe create the following measures of cumulative exposure\nto short sleep duration from usual sleep hours in each wave.\nNSF standard\nRespondents receive a 0 in each wave if they meet the NSF\nage-specific standard for adequate sleep (at least 9 h for\nleast 7 h for those aged 18\u00ad25), and 1 otherwise (Hirshkowitz\net al., 2015). Summing across waves provides a count of the\nnumber of waves in which respondents fail to meet the NSF\nstandard for adequate sleep.\nSeven-hour standard\nRespondents receive a 0 in each wave if they sleep 7 h or\nmore, and 1 otherwise. Summing the four items provides a\ncount of the number of waves in which respondents fail to\nsleep at least 7 h.\nDistribution-based measures\nWe use standardized residuals to indicate how much less a\ngiven respondent sleeps compared to the average for age-\nand sex-specific peers, based on the distribution of sleep\nhours in the Add Health data. We begin by estimating a\nhierarchical linear model (with wave-specific observations\nnested within respondents) that predicts average sleep\nduration with age, sex and the wave of observation. We\ninclude quadratic splines for age, with knots at ages 15, 20\nand include interactions between sex and the age variables.\nOur model, shown in Appendix S1, finds that residual\nvariability in usual sleep duration increases from ages 11\u00ad\nAncillary analyses found that sex differences in residual\nvariability were trivial in magnitude, and were thus excluded\nfrom our final models.\nWe square the within-individual and between-individual (by\nage) residual standard deviations, sum them, and take the\nsquare root to calculate a standard deviation (SD) for\nsleep duration, conditional on the variables included in the\nbetween-individual residuals and divide them by the age-\nspecific conditional standard deviations to create a standard-\nized residual (Snijders and Bosker, 2011). A standardized\nresidual of \u00ad1 indicates that a respondent's usual sleep\nduration is 1 SD below peers of the same age and sex.\nWe use the age- and sex-specific standardized residuals to\nstandards. In each wave, we create four dichotomous\nvariables (one for each standard) that equal 1 if the residuals\n\u00c01.00 or smaller, respectively. The dichotomous variables\nequal 0 if respondents have residuals that are above the\nthreshold for a given standard in a given wave. Summing the\ndichotomous variables creates a count of the number of\nwaves that respondents fail to meet a given standard for\nadequate sleep.\nConfounders\nNumerous variables are associated with sleep duration, but\nthe causal ordering of those variables is unclear (Krueger and\nFriedman, 2009). Thus, we focus on confounders that are\nmost clearly exogenous. All models adjust for demographic\nvariables. Age in years in wave 4 is coded continuously. We\ndo not find evidence of a non-linear association between age\nand body mass for the ages examined. Sex is coded\ndichotomously. Race/ethnicity is coded categorically as\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian,\nNative American and other.\nSubsequent models adjust for additional potential con-\nfounders. Nativity is coded dichotomously as US versus\nforeign-born. Among women, a categorical variable indicates\nthose who were never pregnant, previously pregnant or\ncurrently pregnant at wave 4. Models that exclude women\nwho are currently pregnant are virtually identical to those\nshown herein. Years of education among mothers and\nfathers are measured continuously and range from 0 (never\nattended school) to 18 (any post-baccalaureate education).\nTotal family income in 1994 is measured continuously; we\nadd 1 and take the natural log to account for the diminishing\nassociation between income and health as income increases\n(Krueger and Burgard, 2011). Parental marital status at wave\n1 is coded categorically as never married, married or\npreviously married. Dichotomous variables indicate whether\nmothers or fathers ever smoked cigarettes [`Has your\n(mother/father) ever smoked cigarettes?'] or were obese\n[`Respondent's (mother/father) has obesity?'] at wave 1. Like\nother proxy reports, adolescent reports of mothers' and\nfathers' smoking and obesity may be measured with error\nand, thus, might account incompletely for confounding of the\nassociation between cumulative exposure to short sleep and\nbody mass outcomes. We use information about biological\nparents where available; otherwise we use information about\nthe current mother or father figure in the household.\nSensitivity analyses exclude adolescents who are obese at\nbaseline. Obesity in wave 1 is determined by comparing BMI\nto age- and sex-specific standards provided by the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Kuczmarski\net al., 2002). To correct potential biases in self-reported\nheights and weights in wave 1, we employ wave 2 data that\ninclude both self-reported and measured heights and\nCumulative exposure to short sleep 631\nweights, use linear regression to predict differences between\nself-reported and measured items by age, race/ethnicity and\nsex, and adjust our wave 1 measures accordingly.\nAnalyses\nWhen arraying our data such that there is a row for each\nrespondent in our analyses, and a column for each variable,\nonly 5.2% of the cells have missing values. Despite this small\npercentage of missing data, listwise deletion of missing data\nwould result in the exclusion of more than one-third of our\nsample because many respondents are missing on only one\nof the numerous variables in our analyses. Respondents may\nhave missing data due to wave non-response (i.e. non-\nparticipation in a given wave of the study) or item\nnon-response (i.e. refusal to respond to an item when\nrespondents participated in a given wave). All the respon-\ndents in our analyses participated in both waves 1 and 4.\nThus, in terms of wave non-response, 100% of eligible\nrespondents participated in at least two waves, 94% of\neligible respondents participated in three waves and 63.7% of\neligible respondents participated in all four waves. Item non-\nresponse is rare for our key variables. In wave 4, only 0.5% of\nrespondents are missing on sleep duration, 0.1% are missing\non BMI and 1% are missing on waist circumference.\nWe use multiple imputation to preserve our sample size\nand to reduce the potential for biased estimates due to\nmissing data. Multiple imputation fills in each piece of missing\ndata with multiple values that are drawn from a distribution of\nprobable values. Multiple imputation methods assume that\ndata are missing at random (MAR), conditional on observed\ncovariates. In contrast, the listwise deletion of missing values\nrelies on a less plausible assumption that data are missing\ncompletely at random (MCAR), unconditional on observed\ncovariates (Little and Rubin, 2002). The MAR assumption is\nmost plausible when numerous variables are included in the\nimputation model. We include more than 60 variables in our\nimputation model (including sleep and body mass variables,\nas well as variables associated with sleep and body mass) to\nprovide information about the probable distribution of missing\nusing chained equations methods. Because all respondents\nin our study are interviewed in at least two waves, we use\nboth cross-sectional and longitudinal variation to impute\nsleep duration within individuals and over time. Simulation\nstudies show that multiple imputation results in less biased\nresults than listwise deletion of missing data (Lee and Carlin,\n2010). In our data, estimates that use multiple imputation\nrather than listwise deletion provide similar point estimates\nbut narrower confidence intervals due to enhanced statistical\npower.\nWe use multivariate logistic regression models to estimate\nassociations between measures of cumulative short sleep\nduration and the wave 4 measures of obesity and elevated\nwaist circumference. We pool males and females in all\nmodels--although average sleep duration varies by sex, we\nfound no sex differences in the association between cumu-\nlative exposure to short sleep and obesity or waist circum-\nference. We use Taylor-series expansion to obtain robust\nstandard errors, given the complex sampling frame employed\nby Add Health (Korn and Graubard, 1999). We use STATA\nsoftware for all analyses (StataCorp, 2013).\nEthics committee approval\nStaff at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nreceived Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the\nAdd Health data collection and attained consent from survey\nrespondents. The IRB at the University of Colorado Denver/\nAnschutz Medical Campus further approved our use of the\nde-identified version of the Add Health data for the current\nproject.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents age- and sex-specific average sleep\ndurations in Add Health, as well as the distribution-based\nthresholds for short sleep (derived from the model in\nAppendix S1). Average sleep duration among females decli-\nage 34. Compared to females, males have slightly longer\nsleep durations before age 18, and have somewhat shorter\nsleep durations after age 19.\nTable 2 shows that, by wave 4, only one-third of respon-\ndents are normal weight and slightly more than one-third of\nrespondents are obese. By definition, approximately one-\nquarter of respondents have waist circumferences at or\nabove the 75th percentile. Few respondents have short sleep\ndurations in all four waves. Approximately 3% of respondents\nreport short sleep in all four waves according to the NSF\nstandard, 5% report short sleep in all four waves according to\nthe \u00c00.25 SD standard and fewer than 2% report short sleep\nin all four waves according to the 7-h and \u00c00.75 SD\nstandards. Further, few respondents meet standards for\nadequate sleep hours in all four waves. Just 28% of\nrespondents meet the NSF standard in all four waves and\n45% meet the 7-h standard in all four waves. A majority of\nrespondents (62%) report adequate sleep in every wave only\nwhen considering the \u00c01.00 SD standard.\nCompare measures of short sleep\nTable 3 presents models for the odds of obesity (models 1\nand 2) and elevated waist circumference (models 3 and 4).\nEach panel reports results for a different measure of short\nsleep. Each measure of cumulative exposure to short sleep\nhas a graded association with the odds of being obese\n(model 1) or of having an elevated waist circumference\n(model 3) in wave 4. The trend is statistically significant for\neach sleep measure, but those who are short sleepers in one\nwave based on the NSF (a) or \u00c00.25 SD (c) standards do not\nhave significantly higher odds of elevated body mass than\nthose who are not short sleepers in any wave.\nModels 2 and 4 in Table 3 examine whether short sleep\noccurs prior to body mass outcomes by excluding respon-\ndents who were obese at wave 1. Compared to the first\nmodel for each outcome, the odds ratios for the cumulative\nsleep variables are slightly attenuated, although two or three\nof the indicator variables remain significant for the 7-h (b),\nCumulative exposure to short sleep and body mass\nTable 4 shows models that predict the odds of obesity and\nelevated waist circumference with the NSF, 7-h, \u00c00.50 SD\nand \u00c00.75 SD standards, while adjusting for additional\nconfounders. We exclude the \u00c00.25 SD standard because\nit had the weakest association with the elevated body mass\noutcomes of all the distribution-based measures, and we\nexclude the \u00c01.00 SD standard because repeated exposure\nto extremely short sleep is rare (see Table 1). Each measure\nof cumulative exposure to short sleep has a graded associ-\nation with the odds of obesity (models 1\u00ad4) and elevated\nwaist circumference (models 5\u00ad8), although two or three of\nthe indicators for the NSF and \u00c00.75 SD standards fell from\nsignificance.\nFigure 1 illustrates the dose\u00adresponse association\nbetween the predicted probability of being obese and\ncumulative exposure to short sleep. We calculate the\npredicted probabilities from model 2 (7-h standard) and\nmodel 3 (\u00c00.50 SD standard) of Table 4, when the covari-\nates are set to their mean values. Consistent with the results\nin Table 4, the association between cumulative exposure to\nshort sleep and the probability of being obese is slightly\nstronger for the 7-h standard than for the \u00c00.50 SD standard,\nbut the 95% confidence intervals are somewhat wider.\nDISCUSSION\nThe hypothesized hormonal (Hitze et al., 2008) and beha-\nmechanisms suggest that persistent exposures to short\nsleep will have stronger associations with body mass than\nshort-term exposures. We find a dose\u00adresponse association\nthat is consistent with the hypothesis that sleep duration is\nassociated causally with body mass, although we cannot rule\nout the possibility of unobserved confounders with observa-\ntional data. After adjusting for numerous confounders, those\nwho report short sleep in all four waves, compared to those\nwho do not report short sleep in any wave, have increased\nodds of obesity and elevated waist circumference that are\nTable 1 Mean sleep duration and distribution-based thresholds for short sleep, by age and sex, Add Health*\nFemales Males\nDistribution-based thresholds Distribution-based thresholds\nSD, standard deviation.\n*Derived from the model shown in Appendix S1.\nCumulative exposure to short sleep 633\ncomparable in magnitude to the odds ratio for obesity when\ncomparing blacks to whites.\nTwo measures of short sleep perform similarly well. The 7-\nh standard that is often used among adults (Cappuccio et al.,\nelevated waist circumference when applying that standard to\nadolescents. Although the 7-h standard fails to consider the\npotential for changing sleep needs throughout adolescence\nand early adulthood, it is easy to use in clinical settings as a\nmarker for obesity risk. Our findings affirm the NSF report,\nwhich asserts that sleeping fewer than 7 h per night is\nparticularly harmful for children aged 6\u00ad17 (Hirshkowitz et al.,\nassociated persistently with body mass outcomes in early\nadulthood, and reflects smoothly changing sleep needs\nthroughout the ages examined.\nOur distribution-based approach has limitations similar to\nother approaches that classify individuals based on the\ndistribution of their peers (e.g. the CDC's definition of\noverweight and obesity among children). In our case,\ndefinitions of `short sleep' are based on an empirical\ndistribution, even though the average child may not be\ngetting adequate sleep (Calamaro et al., 2009; Chen et al.,\n2008). Nevertheless, we tested various distribution-based\nthresholds and found that children who occasionally sleep\n\u00c00.25 SD or less than the average for their age and sex do\nnot have consistently elevated body mass outcomes. Thus,\nadolescents and young adults who report the average sleep\nduration for their age and sex group appear to have adequate\nsleep--at least in terms of body mass outcomes. Further,\ndistribution-based methods provide a smoothly-changing set\nof values for adequate sleep, rather than the sharp changes\nTable 2 Means (standard deviations) and percentage\ndistributions of study variables, Add Health*\nBody mass variables\nWave 4 BMI, %\nWave 1 BMI, %\nRespondent confounders at wave 4\nRace/ethnicity, %\nPregnancy status at wave 4, %\nCurrently pregnant 3.0\nParent confounders at wave 1\nParents' marital status, %\nNumber of waves respondents failed to meet a given standard for\nadequate sleep\nBelow NSF standard, %\nBelow 7-h standard, %\nTable 2 Continued\nNSF, National Sleep Foundation.\n*Standard deviations (SD) are undefined when applying probability\nweights to survey data.

Add\nHealth provides repeated measures of sleep duration and\nobjective measures of height and weight. Separate analyses\n(not shown) show similar results when adjusting for `current'\nsleep duration at wave 4. Ancillary analyses (not shown) also\nfind similar results when examining the waist-to-height ratio\nas an outcome. Our study is limited by relying upon self-\nreported sleep duration. However, respondents with higher\nBMIs who are most likely to experience sleep apnea may be\nmost likely to overstate their sleep durations (Weaver et al.,\n2004), which would tend to bias our results towards smaller\nassociations.\nIn sum, cumulative exposure to short sleep appears to be\nan important risk factor for obesity and elevated waist\ncircumference.
