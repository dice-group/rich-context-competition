    "abstract": "Abstract\nPrevious research on harmony perception has mainly been concerned with horizontal aspects of\nharmony, turning less attention to how listeners perceive psychoacoustic qualities and emotions in\nsingle isolated chords. A recent study found mild dissonances to be more preferred than\nconsonances in single chord perception, although the authors did not systematically vary\nregister and consonance in their study; these omissions were explored here. An online\nempirical experiment was conducted where participants (N \u00bc 410) evaluated chords on the\ndimensions of Valence, Tension, Energy, Consonance, and Preference; 15 different chords were\nplayed with piano timbre across two octaves. The results suggest significant differences on all\ndimensions across chord types, and a strong correlation between perceived dissonance and\ntension. The register and inversions contributed to the evaluations significantly, nonmusicians\ndistinguishing between triadic inversions similarly to musicians. The mildly dissonant minor\nninth, major ninth, and minor seventh chords were rated highest for preference, regardless of\nmusical sophistication. The role of theoretical explanations such as aggregate dyadic consonance,\nthe inverted-U hypothesis, and psychoacoustic roughness, harmonicity, and sharpness will be\ndiscussed to account for the preference of mild dissonance over consonance in single chord\nperception.\n",

(p. 304) and Gabrielsson and Lindstro\n\u00a8 m (2010) concur: ``. . . there is practically\nnothing on how different kinds of chords . . . may affect expression'' (p. 393).\nWhile there have been some empirical studies conducted on specifically vertical harmony\nperception, the emphasis has been mainly on harmonic intervals (e.g., Costa, Bitti, &\n2009), on the major or minor triad distinction (e.g., Bakker & Martin, 2015; Crowder,\ndissonance mostly in triads (e.g., Bidelman & Krishnan, 2011; Cook, 1999; Pallesen et al.,\n2005; Roberts, 1986). Research addressing the perception of chords containing more than\nthree pitches has been rare: Studies focusing directly on single chord perception while using a\nmore diverse chord palette have been conducted by Minati et al. (2009) who applied tetrads in\na neurological experiment on consonance or dissonance perception; Kuusi (2010, 2011) who\ninvestigated how listeners perceive nontraditional (nontonal) chords; and by Lahdelma and\nEerola (2016) who focused exclusively on the emotion perception of single chords, spanning\nboth triads and seventh chords.\nAs Parncutt (1989) puts it, ``musical sounds are consonant if they are perceived to `sound\nwell' with each other (con sonare), and suggests that ``chords are consonant if they contain no\ndissonant intervals'' (p. 56). Consonance or dissonance can be divided into two subcategories:\nSingle isolated intervals and chords represent sensory consonance or dissonance\n(psychoacoustics), while consonance or dissonance in chords and intervals while being part\nof a musical context is referred to as musical consonance or dissonance or musical acoustics\nIt is widely held that sensory dissonance arises from the beating of frequency\nAccording to McDermott, Lehr, and Oxenham (2010) ``beating occurs whenever two\nsinusoids of differing frequency are combined'' (p. 1), which in turn creates the sound\nquality of roughness that listeners typically perceive as unpleasant. The effect of roughness\nis seen as prevalent in dissonant, but not in consonant musical chords (e.g., Hutchinson &\npreferential bias for consonance could be innate, basing this view on their finding that\ninfants are biologically prepared to treat consonance as more pleasant than dissonance;\nthis view of an innate preference for consonance, however, has later been challenged by\nZwicker and Fastl (1990, p. 313) point out three actual factors that contribute to sensory\nconsonance or dissonance: (a) roughness, (b) sharpness, and (c) tonalness (in contrast to\nnoisiness). More recent studies (Cousineau, McDermott, & Peretz, 2012; McDermott\net al., 2010), however, suggest that harmonicity, that is, ``the extent that the sonority's\naudible spectrum corresponds to a harmonic series'' (Parncutt, 2014a, p. 972) plays also an\nimportant role in the perception of consonance or dissonance, possibly an even more\nimportant one than roughness. According to this view, ``consonant chords derive their\npleasantness not from the absence of beating, but rather from their similarity to single\nnotes with harmonic spectra'' (McDermott et al., 2010, p. 2). The study by McDermott\net al. (2010) curiously indicates that harmonicity preferences correlate with musical\nexpertise, suggesting that exposure to music amplifies preferences for harmonic frequencies\nbecause of their musical importance.\nAccording to the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016), chords that are considered as\nmildly dissonant in terms of both sensory (i.e., chords containing dissonant intervals) as well\n2 i-Perception\nas musical consonance or dissonance (see e.g., Re\n\u00b4 ve\n\u00b4 sz, 1954) were actually the most preferred\nones among a heterogeneous and big sample of listeners including both experts and inexperts:\nThe mildly dissonant minor seventh and major seventh chords were more preferred than the\nconsonant major and minor triads. This proposes an ostensible paradox: Consonance and\npreference or pleasantness are often seen as indisputably overlapping or even being\ncompletely synonymous in terms of harmony perception (see e.g., Bidelman & Krishnan,\nParncutt (1989), however, aptly reminds that ``relatively consonant sounds are not necessarily\npreferred to relatively dissonant sounds. If this were the case, single tones would always be\npreferred to chords'' (p. 57). He proposes that the relationship between dissonance\n(complexity) and preference usually takes the form of an inverted-U curve: ``for relatively\nlow degrees of dissonance, preference increases with increasing dissonance, while for\nrelatively high degrees, preference decreases with increasing dissonance'' (p. 57).\nWhile the inverted-U hypothesis (e.g., Berlyne, 1971) offers one possible explanation for\nwhy mild dissonance is preferred over consonance in single chord perception, it does not seem\nto be all-encompassing. For example, it cannot account for the fact that according to the data\nof Lahdelma and Eerola (2016), the dominant seventh chord (major\u00adminor seventh) was less\npreferred than the major and minor triads, which according to the inverted-U hypothesis as\nsuch should be the other way around; the dominant seventh being somewhere in between the\nextremes of consonance and dissonance when considering a large number of possible chord\nsonorities (cf. Huron, 1994). Moreover, on an empirical note, Orr and Ohlsson (2005) did not\nfind evidence for an inverted-U relation for experts in their experiment when testing the\nrelationship between liking and complexity in musical improvisations.\nInspecting the phenomenon from a different angle, it is striking how in Huron's (1994)\naggregate dyadic consonance calculations (the sum of the consonances of all interval classes\nwithin a chord) the most consonant pitch set for tetrads (out of all possible four-pitch\ncombinations) is the minor seventh chord, the major seventh chord being the third most\nconsonant. Intriguingly, with regard to tetrachords, the highest amount of aggregate dyadic\nconsonance is parallel with the evaluations for highest subjective preference in the data of\nLahdelma and Eerola (2016). Huron (1994), however, reminds that ``in the case of these\nthree- and four-note sets, it is important to recognize that the consonance measures do not\nreflect the consonance of the complete set of concurrently sounding tones (such as the\nconsonance of `a major triad')'' (p. 301). Despite this important caveat, the analogy\nbetween high aggregate dyadic consonance and preference in single chords is striking.\nAs pitch class sets comprising five and six pitches yield the most aggregate dyadic\nconsonance in single chords (Huron, 1994), the aim of the current experiment is to\nbroaden the chord palette of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016) to encompass not only triads\nand tetrachords but also penta- and hexachords containing most aggregate dyadic\nconsonance to empirically test how these are perceived compared with one another and\nwhether there indeed is the possibility that high aggregate dyadic consonance values\npredict preference in single chord perception.\nIn addition, the current experiment's aim is to test whether the found differences in the\nperception of triadic inversions in the data of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016) hold up with\nrandomized chord roots. In their data, with the major triad, the tendency was that the applied\ndimensions of valence, tension, and energy all exhibited a pattern of increasing ratings from root\nthrough first inversion to second inversion, on both applied timbres (piano and strings). A similar\npattern also occurred for the dimensions of interest or expectancy, happiness or joy, and liking or\npreference. However, in their experiment, the chords were played only in a single octave (C4) and\nexclusively with C roots. Hence, the results could be due to register differences between the\nLahdelma and Eerola 3\ninversions (e.g., the major triad's second inversion being higher in register than the root position\nand the first inversion), as pitch height reportedly affects actual music perception (e.g., Ilie &\nThompson, 2006; Jaquet, Danuser, & Gomez, 2014). Thus, we feel that with regard to the triadic\ninversions, the randomization of chord roots across two octaves can tell us more about the role of\nregister in accounting for the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016).\nExperiment\nIn the current experiment, we asked participants to rate single chords (see Figure 1) isolated\nfrom all musical context (major and minor triads with inversions, selected tetra-, penta-, and\nhexachords in root positions) using five scales measuring separate emotional and perceptual\nqualities.\nThe first three bipolar dimensions of the five scales were adopted from Schimmack and\nGrob (2000). Their three-dimensional model of affect attempts to capture the core affects\nusing the three bipolar dimensions of valence (intrinsic attractiveness or aversiveness), energy\narousal, and tension arousal. These dimensions have been applied in studies using actual\nmusic as stimuli (e.g., Ilie & Thompson, 2006), effectively separating the effects of register\non perception, as well as in an experiment conducted directly on single chord perception\n(Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016). The fourth applied dimension was consonance (used in studies by\ne.g., Bidelman & Krishnan, 2011; Roberts, 1986) in order to capture the participants'\nsubjective perception of consonance and dissonance in a given chord. The fifth dimension\nmeasured the participants' subjective preference for each chord. These last two dimensions\nwere chosen in order to investigate the amount of intersection between perceived consonance\nand preference with regard to single chord perception.\nMethod\nParticipants. The participants for the study were recruited through the Internet with the aim of\ndrawing the attention of both musicians and nonmusicians in order to have a substantial,\nheterogeneous, and international participant pool (see e.g., Honing & Ladinig, 2008 and\nHoning & Reips, 2008 for a review of the benefits of this strategy). The experiment was\nFigure 1. The chord stimuli. The chords are notated here with C roots; Forte pitch-class set names can be\nseen above each individual chord type in brackets.

The total amount of\nparticipants was 434, out of which 418 were considered valid for further statistical\nanalysis; 12 participants were removed due to technical problems evident on the basis of\nthe interface's result database (and in most cases corroborated by reports that certain chords\ndid not play because of internet connection problems), and 4 participants were annulled as\ntheir answers were obviously malicious in nature (i.e., no chord evaluations done or evidently\nrandom clicking in a minimum amount of time spent on the experiment website). Out of the\nremaining 418 participants, 8 extreme outliers were removed (described in more detail in the\nResults), making the final number of valid cases 410.\nIn total, 42 different nationalities were represented in the final participant pool\n(continental breakdown: 61.2% Europe, 30.5% Americas, and 8.3% others). The biggest\nnationality groups represented were Finland (33.9%), the USA (21.2%), and Great Britain\nparticipants' musical sophistication was measured with the Ollen Musical Sophistication\nIndex (Ollen, 2006), a 10-item questionnaire yielding a score for each participants' musical\nthreshold between a respondent being more musically sophisticated and less musically\nsophisticated (see Marcs Auditory Laboratories, http://marcs-survey.uws.edu.au/OMSI/\nomsi.php).\nStimuli. The chord material (Figure 1) consisted of major and minor triads (played in their\nroot positions and in their first and second inversions, respectively), tetrachords (major sixth\nand minor seventh), pentachords (dominant ninth, minor ninth, major ninth, pentatonic, and\nNeapolitan pentachord [as referred to in Solomon, 2005]), and hexachords (dominant\nseventh sharp eleventh and diatonic hexachord). Only the triad chords were played with\ninversions in order to further investigate the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016), all\nother chords were played exclusively in their root positions. All chords were played in\nclose position. The tetrachords, pentachords, and hexachords were selected on the basis of\nHuron's (1994) table for chords containing most aggregate dyadic consonance.\nAs familiarity is an important component in chord perception (see e.g., Parncutt & Hair,\n2011), we decided to include highly consonant chords (selected from a list by Tymoczko,\n2011, p. 63) that are more familiar from actual musical context when compared with some of\nthe rarer chord sonorities containing high aggregate dyadic consonance in order to see how\nthis possibly affects the chord evaluations. The major sixth and the minor seventh represent\nthe same pitch-class set as they contain the same pitches in different orderings; we decided to\ninclude both chords in order to investigate if there is any difference in how they are perceived\ndepending on the chord's root.\nAll selected chords were transposed with a randomization across two octaves ( \u00c6 5\nsemitones around C4 and C5, the possible chord roots being all equally likely to occur\nwithin this range). Thus, the stimuli consisted of 15 chords (Figure 1) performed with\npiano timbre across two octaves, making the total sum of chords for each participant 30.\nAll chords were exactly 4.8 seconds in length and played in equal temperament. The chords\nwere generated with Ableton Live 9 (a commercial music sequencer software), using the\nSynthogy Ivory Grand Pianos II plug-in. The applied sound font was Steinway D Concert\nGrand with a touch of ambience reverb added to the chord samples to make them sound more\nnatural. The attack, articulation, and reverb values of the chords were kept as neutral as\nLahdelma and Eerola 5\npossible to keep the participants' attention exclusively on the actual chords. The stimuli can\nProcedure. The web-based chord evaluation application was programmed with JavaScript.\nThe application was made specifically for the purpose of the current experiment and was\nparticipants' demographic background information (gender, nationality, age), musical\npreference (Short Test Of Music Preferences; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), musical\nsophistication (Ollen Musical Sophistication Index; Ollen, 2006), and the type of audio\ndevice used to take the experiment.\nThe participants received the following instructions:\nIn the experiment you will be asked to rate 30 chords on 5 dimensions, and to provide some\nbackground information concerning your musical education. You can listen to each chord as\nmany times as you like before evaluating it. Each chord should be evaluated as a separate entity,\nregardless of preceding or sequential chords.\nThe participants were asked to rate each chord on the presented 5-item scale (Appendix).\nThe five dimensions were rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. With valence, the\nbipolar extremes were 1 \u00bc negative and 7 \u00bc positive. With tension, the extremes were\n1 \u00bc relaxed and 7 \u00bc tense, and with energy, the extremes were 1 \u00bc low and 7 \u00bc high. With\nconsonance, the extremes were 1 \u00bc rough and 7 \u00bc smooth, these two poles having been used\nextensively in research literature (e.g., Bregman, 1994; Parncutt & Hair, 2011; van de Geer,\nLevelt, & Plomp, 1962). For preference, the applied poles were 1 \u00bc low and 7 \u00bc high.\nThe participants were given the chance to listen each chord as many times as they wished.\nThe ordering of the chords, the chords' roots (across two octaves), as well as the ordering of\nthe five dimensions were randomized for each participant.\nResults\nAll extreme outliers (over \u00c6 3.0 SD's in dimension aggregations, 8 sets of answers altogether)\nwere removed from the participant pool (N \u00bc 418), making the final number of valid cases\n410. The rating scales' internal consistency was measured with Cronbach's alpha (range\n.80 \u00c0 .87, see Table 1 for details). Correlations between the five variables were calculated\n(Table 1). The strongest correlations were found between the dimensions of tension and\nconsonance (\u00c0.97), tension and preference (\u00c0.79), and between tension and energy (.78).\nTable 1. Correlations Between the Rating Scales Across Chords and Register.\nValence Tension Energy Preference Consistency\nNote. df \u00bc 20. Consistency refers to Cronbach's alphas.\n6 i-Perception\nWhile there is certainly overlap between the dimensions of valence, consonance, and\npreference, this overlap is not complete (cf. the virtually complete negative correlation\nbetween tension and consonance) and shows that perceived consonance does not\nautomatically result in more perceived valence and preference in single chord perception.\nThe Effect of Musical Factors on the Chord Evaluations\nTo estimate whether the ratings across the chords and register exhibited any differences, a\ntwo-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was carried out for all five dimensions with\nthe Chord Type and Register (Low and High) as the two within-subject factors. Chord Type\nconsisted of the 11 main categories of chords in which the triadic inversions were collapsed\ninto the main types of triad chords.\nChord Type and Register. As displayed in Table 2, all scales display significant main effects of\nChord Type and Register. Out of these two factors, Chord Type is typically larger, with effect\nsizes ranging from 0.07 to 0.37, whereas Register exhibits considerably lower effect sizes\n(0.001\u00ad0.04). In all cases, except for energy, there was also a weak interaction between the\nfactors. The summary of the analysis of variance (Table 2) reveals that for valence, tension,\nand consonance, the differences in ratings across Chord Type were strikingly large (i.e., effect\nsizes above .25, which display generalized eta squared values, 2\nG\n, at the Chord Type column's\nright side). The effect sizes across Register (the Register column's right side) were\nconsiderably smaller, the two largest being on the dimensions of tension (.04) and energy\n(.03). The effect size for valence was conspicuously small, and these findings are in line with\nParncutt (2014b) who proposes that pitch height in music is normally associated with arousal,\nnot valence. Parncutt also suggests that music with a high average pitch tends to contain\nmore energy than music with a low average pitch; this seems to hold true also for single chord\nperception. Ilie and Thompson (2006) also found tension to grow with pitch height in an\nempirical setting using actual musical excerpts as stimuli; again, this same effect is present in\nsingle chord perception as well (Figure 2).\nThe main effects of Chord Type across the dimensions provide further interesting results.\nWhen we look at the effects of Chord Type (aggregated over register), the perceived valence\nwas highest for the major triad with a mean of 5.56 (SD \u00bc 1.27) and lowest for the Neapolitan\npentachord with a mean of 2.62 (SD \u00bc 1.26). Perceived tension was highest for the Neapolitan\nTable 2.

The lowest mean rating on the dimension\nof tension was for the major triad's mean of 2.65 (SD \u00bc 1.46). Perceived energy was highest\nfor the dominant seventh sharp eleventh chord with a mean of 4.81 (SD \u00bc 1.28), followed by\nthe Neapolitan pentachord's mean of 4.56 (SD \u00bc 1.47), and the dominant ninth's mean of\n4.54 (SD \u00bc 1.25). The lowest mean rating on the dimension of energy was for the minor triad\nwith a mean of 3.52 (SD \u00bc 1.34). The perceived consonance mean rating was highest for the\nmajor triad with a mean of 5.71 (SD \u00bc 1.31), the lowest for the Neapolitan pentachord's\nmean of 2.16 (SD \u00bc 1.13). On a side note, it is worth noting how the added sixth chord\n(M \u00bc 4.49, SD \u00bc 1.31) was perceived as less consonant than the minor seventh chord\n(M \u00bc 4.68, SD \u00bc 1.30), even though the chords represent the same pitch class set. The\nhighest rating on the dimension preference was for the major ninth chord with a mean of\nminor seventh's mean of 4.68 (SD \u00bc 1.30). The lowest mean rating on the dimension of\npreference was for the Neapolitan pentachord with a mean of 3.40 (SD \u00bc 1.65), followed\nby the dominant seventh sharp eleventh chord's mean of 3.95 (SD \u00bc 1.65).\nWe also explored the influence of additional variables such as diatonicity (the proportion\nof tones belonging to diatonic scales within each chord) and chord ambitus (difference\nFigure 2. Mean ratings of the five dimensions across Chord Type and Register.\n8 i-Perception\nbetween highest and lowest tone in semitones) to ANOVA analyses as within-subject\ncovariates, but both of these variables failed to make an impact on the results.\nTriadic inversions. As can be seen from Table 3, the perception of triadic inversions is mostly in\nline with the results of Lahdelma and Eerola (2016): Energy and tension exhibit significant\nmain effects with the ratings growing from root through first inversion to second inversion in\nboth major and minor triads, and the scale of preference does not exhibit a significant main\neffect with regard to inversions. The current study's added scale of consonance or dissonance\nexhibits a significant main effect with an opposing pattern when compared with the scales of\ntension and energy: In both major and minor triads, perceived consonance decreases from\nroot through first inversion to second inversion (Figure 3). With regard to the major triad, the\nleast amount of perceived consonance in the chords' second inversion is notably in line with\nmusical convention (see e.g., Randel, 2003); intriguingly, however, this pattern of perception\nwas not influenced by musical sophistication. Strikingly, both musicians and nonmusicians\ndistinguished between the triadic inversions on the dimensions of energy, tension, and\nconsonance or dissonance similarly. To our knowledge, the current experiment is the first\none to empirically demonstrate this trend.\nThe only notable difference between the current data and the results of Lahdelma and\nEerola (2016) is on the scale of valence. While exhibiting a statistically significant main effect,\nthis significance is considerably smaller in the current data and showcases a different pattern.\nThe randomization of roots seems to have dissolved virtually any perceived difference\nbetween the major triad's inversions, and the minor triad's first inversion was perceived as\ncontaining the most amount of positive valence (Figure 3); in the data of Lahdelma and\nEerola (2016), the difference between the minor triad's first and second inversions with regard\nto valence was negligible. However, the current finding could be explained with the fact that\nthe minor triad's first inversion has a major third above the bass and might hence sound\nsomewhat ``major.'' Curiously, Hutchinson and Knopoff (1979) suggest that the minor triad's\nfirst inversion is actually the most consonant of the chords' inversions; paradoxically this was\nnot corroborated by the current empirical data (despite the most perceived valence in this\nparticular inversion), as the minor triad's root position was perceived as containing more\nconsonance than its first inversion.\nIn sum, the randomized chord roots of the triads might provide a slightly more\naccurate picture of the perceived differences between the triadic inversions, but the\noverall tendency of the current results is quite similar to the findings of Lahdelma and\nTable 3.

Mean ratings of the triadic inversions across all dimensions.\nEerola (2016) who did not randomize chord roots in their study and played the triads\nexclusively with C-roots.\nThe Effect of Background Factors on the Chord Evaluations\nPast studies indicate that gender (e.g., Costa et al., 2000; Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016) and\nmusical expertise (e.g., Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016; McLachlan, Marco, Light, & Wilson,\n2013) may affect vertical harmony perception. Moreover, it has been suggested that\nfamiliarity affects the perception of chords (e.g., McLachlan et al., 2013; Parncutt & Hair,\n2011) and the perception of consonance or dissonance in general (e.g., Cazden, 1972;\nIn the current study, musical expertise was assessed with the Ollen Musical Sophistication\nIndex (Ollen, 2006); music preferences were inferred from the ratings of 13 genres that were\nrecoded into four meta-genres suggested by Rentfrow and Gosling (2003) according to\nhierarchical cluster analysis clustering the participants according to the similarity of their\nmusic preferences into four clusters. Each participant belonged to one of these clusters,\nlabeled as Reflective or Complex (n \u00bc 215), Intense or Rebellious (n \u00bc 86), Upbeat or\nConventional (n \u00bc 76), or Energetic or Rhythmic (n \u00bc 33). Separate mixed ANOVAs were\ncarried out with emotion ratings across the three between-subjects factors (Gender,\nMusical Expertise, and Music Preferences) reported in Table 4.\nMost of the ratings scales did not yield significant main effects; we will now briefly outline\nthe ones that actually portrayed differences. For valence ratings, Gender, Musical Expertise,\nand Music Preferences yielded significant differences; males rated the chords as more\nlabeled as preferring music that is ``reflective and complex'' also had higher ratings of valence\nFor ratings of energy, only Music Preferences showed significant differences (those classified\nas listening to Upbeat or Conventional music, M \u00bc 4.09, SD \u00bc 1.39, whereas listeners of\nIntense or Rebellious music rated the chords lower on energy, M \u00bc 3.89, SD \u00bc 1.33). With\nrespect to tension, none of the background variables contributed to the chord ratings.\nConsonance, on the other hand, exhibited differences according to Gender and Musical\nExpertise, where males (M \u00bc 4.42, SD \u00bc 1.66) displayed higher ratings than females\n(M \u00bc 4.32, SD \u00bc 1.71) and those listening to Reflective or Complex music displayed higher\nTable 4. ANOVA Summary for All Ratings Across the Main Background Variables.\nGender Musical expertise Music preferences\nG\nG\nG\nLahdelma and Eerola 11\nindicated significant differences across the background variables, being very similar to the\npattern exhibited by valence (males, musicians, and those preferring reflective and complex\nmusic showing higher ratings of preference for all chords). It is important to note here that few\nof the scales displayed interactions between background variables and chords. The exceptions\nwere energy, where Musical Expertise displayed an interaction with chord types, F(10,\nand Gender, F \u00bc 1.83, p < .001, interacted with chord types. Also consonance interacted with\nMusical Expertise and chords (F \u00bc 3.51, p < .001), as well as preference, where Music\nPreferences created an interaction with the chord types (F \u00bc 2.28, p < .001).\nTo summarize, these results suggest that those with higher musical expertise perceived the\nchords as more positive in valence, more consonant, and also preferred the chords more. This\nfinding is in line with the notion that familiarity in fact affects the perception of chords\n(McLachlan et al., 2013), as well as the perception of consonance or dissonance in general\n(Cazden, 1972; Heyduk, 1975). In the context of all ratings, the magnitude of variations\naccording to background, however, is considerably small and negligible (effect sizes < .01).\nAcoustic Properties of the Chords\nTo examine the relationship between psychoacoustic properties and perceptual evaluations of\nthe chords, few selected features were extracted using MIR toolbox (version 1.6.1; Lartillot,\nToiviainen, & Eerola, 2008) and custom MATLAB functions based on prior studies. These\nwere (a) harmonicity (Jensen, 1999) that accounts for the regularity of the amplitude of\nadjoining partials, (b) roughness that captures the sensory beating of the partials in the\nsound using a psychoacoustic model by Vassilakis (2001), and (c) sharpness that is related\nto the high-frequency content of the sound (Zwicker & Fastl, 1991). Figure 4 displays the\nmean values across the chord types for all three features. Moreover, to formally connect\nthe ratings to these descriptors, a linear regression was used to assess the degree of fit between\nthe descriptors and the ratings (see Table 5).\nAs can be seen in Table 5, roughness and sharpness correlate statistically significantly with\nthe dimensions of tension, energy, and consonance. Both roughness and sharpness correlate\npositively with tension and especially with energy, while negatively with consonance. We\nsuggest that the lesser amount of perceived consonance in chords played in the higher\nregister (Figure 2) could be explained with the effect of sharpness, as chords in the lower\nregister actually have significantly more objective roughness compared with chords in the\nhigher register (Figure 4), despite being subjectively perceived as more consonant. This\nfinding is in line with the notion that sharpness is another form of sensory dissonance (in\naddition to roughness), caused by energy at high frequencies (see Aures, 1985a, 1985b).\nWith regard to the difference between objective roughness and subjective dissonance, the\ncurrent data offer some intriguing insights. As can be seen from Figure 4, the diatonic\nhexachord is theoretically more rough than the dominant sharp eleventh chord, and the\npentatonic chord more rough than the Neapolitan pentachord. The ordering of these\nchords' subjective dissonance, however, was exactly the opposite: the pentatonic chord was\nperceived as significantly more consonant compared with the Neapolitan pentachord and the\ndiatonic hexachord slightly more consonant compared with the dominant sharp eleventh\nchord (Figure 2). This difference could be explained with Johnson-Laird, Kang, and Leong\n(2012) concept of tonal dissonance. They suggest that dissonance\nResults from a combination of sensory and tonal dissonance, where `sensory' dissonance\narises . . . in particular from roughness (i.e., the rapid beating of partials), and `tonal'\nFigure 4. Harmonicity, Roughness, and Sharpness values across Chord Types and Register.\nLahdelma and Eerola 13\ndissonance is a consequence of high-level cognitive processes that rely on a tacit knowledge of the\nprinciples of tonality. (p. 24)\nThey propose that tonal dissonance depends on the scales in which the chords can occur: ``chords\noccurring in a major scale should be less dissonant than chords occurring only in a minor scale,\nwhich in turn should be less dissonant than chords occurring in neither sort of scale'' (p. 24).\nThe Neapolitan pentachord is not present in either of the scales, and it was in fact perceived as the\nleast consonant and was the least preferred of all the presented chords in the current experiment.\nThe second least consonant and preferred dominant sharp eleventh chord is not present in a\nmajor scale (cf. the diatonic hexachord) either, but could theoretically be constructed from the\nmelodic minor scale's pitches in an extended tonality. The rest of the chords applied in the current\nexperiment contain no tonal dissonance. Hence, the results clearly corroborate Johnson-Laird\net al.'s (2012) theory of tonal dissonance with regard to single chord perception.\nIt is somewhat surprising that harmonicity did not exhibit statistically significant correlations\nwith any of the five dimensions. As higher harmonicity is often seen as resulting in a higher\namount of perceived consonance (e.g., Cousineau et al., 2012; McDermott et al., 2010), and\nconsonance in turn being often described as a synonym for pleasantness (e.g., Bidelman &\nKrishnan, 2011; Bones, Hopkins, Krishnan, & Plack, 2014), the data of the current study\nimply that harmonicity does not automatically result in consonance and preference in the case\nof single isolated chords consisting of three or more pitches. Concrete examples of this\nphenomenon in the current data are the chords of the dominant ninth and the dominant\nsharp eleventh: Both chords have strikingly high harmonicity values (Figure 4) but were\nnonetheless rated quite low on the dimensions of consonance and preference (Figure 2). The\npentatonic chord in turn has a low amount of harmonicity but was rated relatively high for\npreference. The chord with the lowest amount of harmonicity, the minor seventh, was in fact\nperceived as the third most consonant and also the third most preferred among the presented\nchords. The obtained results might also be influenced by the piano timbre that was used in the\ncurrent experiment. We will return to these questions in the Discussion part.\nAs harmonicity, roughness, and sharpness by themselves did not correlate statistically\nsignificantly with the dimension of preference, we will next outline the possibility of how\naggregate dyadic consonance (Huron, 1994) might affect perceived preference in single chords.\nAggregate Dyadic Consonance\nAggregate dyadic consonance and roughness seem to be related to preference in a curvilinear\nfashion. There is no linear correlation between the means of the chords in terms of preference\nand aggregate dyadic consonance (r \u00bc \u00c0.16, p \u00bc .68) or roughness (r \u00bc \u00c0.24, p \u00bc .54), but a\nTable 5.

Normalized betas and the model fit indices are shown.\nsecond-order polynominal fits the relation better (see Figure 5), especially for roughness\n(R2adj \u00bc .58, p < .05). In other words, combining the aspects of roughness and aggregate\ndyadic consonance could explain why mildly dissonant chords are most preferred. The\nchords of the dominant sharp eleventh and the Neapolitan pentachord are omitted from\nthis model, as they contain tonal dissonance (Johnson-Laird et al., 2012).\nAscanbeseenfrom Figure5,chords that containa medium amount of roughness(minorninth,\nminor ninth, minor seventh, added sixth, and dominant ninth) are not equally highly preferred as\nwould be predicted by the inverted-U hypothesis. The minor ninth, the major ninth, and the minor\nseventhchordsaremorepreferredthantheothersemi-roughchords,possiblybecausetheycontain\nhigh aggregate dyadic consonance. While the added sixth chord contains the same amount of\naggregate dyadic consonance as the minor seventh chord, it however contains slightly more\nroughness; the major second interval present in the chord clearly has a negative impact on its\npreference, possibly due to enculturation (cf. Krantz et al., 2004). As for the pentatonic and\nhexatonic chords, these chords also contain high amounts of aggregate dyadic consonance, but\nthe overall roughness of these chords seems to ``overrule'' their preference, especially in the\nhexatonic chord's case. The preference ratings dramatically drop between the pentatonic and\nthe hexatonic chords: It could be argued that there is a critical threshold of roughness in single\nchord perception which cannot be exceeded in order for the chord to gain high preference ratings.\nCuriously,however,thehighamount ofroughnessandsubjectivedissonance inthepentatonic\nchordshouldtheoretically predictamuchhigheraversion--itshighaggregatedyadicconsonance\nFigure 5. Preference, Roughness, and Aggregate Dyadic Consonance values across Chord Types, excluding\nchords containing tonal dissonance.\nLahdelma and Eerola 15\nmight explainwhythechordisrelativelypreferrednonetheless. Inotherwords,amoderately high\namount of roughness does not automatically result in declined preference in single chord\nperception. In the hexatonic chord's case, the overall roughness of the chord seems to cross\nthat critical threshold for roughness: this particular chord is the roughest of all the presented\nchords, and hence not preferred despite its theoretically high aggregate dyadic consonance. Thus,\ninterestingly a combination of the U-theory with aggregate dyadic consonance seems to most\neffectively predict preference in single chord perception: the most preferred chords contain a\nmoderate amount of aggregate dyadic consonance. It is important to keep in mind, however,\nthat the current model has only nine data points; further research is needed to shed light on the\nrole of aggregate dyadic consonance on the preference of single chords.\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to investigate how listeners perceive single chords across a 5-item scale of\ndimensions consisting of valence, tension, energy, consonance, and preference. The results\nsuggest that mildly dissonant chords in terms of both musical (see e.g., Re\n\u00b4 ve\nsensory consonance or dissonance were actually more preferred than maximally consonant\nchords among a large and heterogeneous pool of participants, across both expert and\ninexpert listeners.\nWe outlined theoretical explanations to account for the preference of mild dissonance in\nsingle chord perception. These include aggregate dyadic consonance (Huron, 1994), the\ninverted-U hypothesis (e.g., Berlyne, 1971), as well as the role of psychoacoustic\nphenomena in the form of harmonicity, roughness, and sharpness. We feel that the\ninverted-U hypothesis is not necessarily all encompassing to account for the preference of\nmild dissonances: Both the dominant seventh chord in the data of Lahdelma and Eerola\n(2016) as well as the dominant ninth in the current study were rated low for preference even\nthough these chords are representing middle ground in terms of complexity when considering\na wide range of sonorities.\nThe overall results suggest that the background factors of gender, musical sophistication,\nand musical preferences affected single chord evaluations to some extent--musicians\ninterestingly objecting less to dissonance than nonmusicians. The overall magnitude of\nvariations according to background was, however, quite small. Nonetheless, the findings are\nin line with propositions that familiarity affects chord perception (McLachlan et al., 2013) as\nwell as the evaluation of consonance or dissonance (Cazden, 1972; Heyduk, 1975). On the other\nhand, it is intriguing how familiarity does not seem to predict preference in the dominant ninth\nchord's case: It is the only pentad present in major\u00adminor tonality and should thus be more\nfamiliar than the other, possibly more exotic five-pitch sonorities used in the current experiment.\nDespite its familiarity, the dominant ninth was the least preferred pentad after the Neapolitan\npentachord. This is somewhat surprising taking the high amount of harmonicity and only the\nmoderate amount of roughness present in the chord. We surmise that the low preference for the\ndominant seventh chord (Lahdelma & Eerola, 2016) and the current study's dominant ninth\nchord might stem from the culturally loaded tritone interval present in these chords. The\navoidance of tritone as an interval has both psychoacoustic and cultural origins (Parncutt,\n1989, 2014a), and this avoidance seems to influence also the perception of chords in which it\nis present. The chord also contains low aggregate dyadic consonance. The low-perceived\nconsonance and preference of the Neapolitan pentachord also suggests the role of\nenculturation in the form of tonal dissonance (Johnson-Laird et al., 2012) instead of a purely\npsychoacoustic explanation: This particular chord was the least preferred sonority and judged\nclearly as subjectively least consonant, despite not being among the objectively roughest chords\nof the presented stimuli. Hence, we see that enculturation indeed affects judgments of sensory\nconsonance or dissonance also even in single isolated chords, not just in chords within a musical\nAlso the difference between the perceived amount of consonance in the common pitch\nclass set of the added sixth and the minor seventh chords is intriguing; the added sixth chord\nwas perceived as more dissonant than the minor seventh chord. We surmise that this is caused\nby the slightly higher amount of roughness that the added sixth chord contains when\ncompared with the minor seventh chord. An interesting detail is that the added sixth\nchord was nonetheless perceived as more positive in valence than the minor seventh chord.\nThis could imply that the added sixth is more affiliated with the major triad because of its\nroot when compared with the minor seventh, and again suggests that enculturation affects\nsingle chord perception in addition to psychoacoustics.\nThe negligible role of harmonicity in the perception of single isolated chords is somewhat\nsurprising, especially when considering the importance it has been given in previous research\n(e.g., Cousineau et al., 2012; McDermott et al., 2010) with regard to the question of\nconsonance or dissonance. However, this finding is in line with Bregman (1994), who\nsuggests that ``harmonicity may not be critical for chord perception'' (p. 496). Also,\naccording to Mellinger and Mont-Reynaud (1996) the relationship between harmonicity\nand the perception of harmony is a complex one, and for example, perceived pleasantness\nis not necessarily completely tied to harmonicity.\nParncutt (2012) proposes that dissonance is in fact based on a combination of roughness,\nharmonicity, and familiarity. If we consider chord perception encompassing also emotion\nperception, Lahdelma and Eerola (2015) demonstrate a theoretical possibility of the role of\nharmonicity affecting the perception of complex musical emotions conveyed by single isolated\nchords. With the dimensions used in the current study, however, harmonicity does not offer any\nsignificant explanation to account for the results. This may have to do also with the fact that the\ncurrent experiment applied only the piano timbre. According to Pierce (1999), the small\ndepartures from perfect harmonicity are important to the piano sound; in other words,\nharmonicity is presumably more important in nonpercussive, steady sounds than in\npercussive, rapidly fading sounds. The role of timbre with regard to the importance of\nharmonicity in single chord perception is a crucial question and should be addressed with\nfuture experiments. Also, the question of the relationship between sensory and musical\nconsonance is a fascinating one: How does the perception of single chords change when\nheard in different kinds of musical contexts (cf. Bharucha & Stoeckig, 1986; Krumhansl, 1990)?\nWe see that the possible role of pitch relations (aggregate dyadic consonance) with regard\nto the perception of single isolated chords should be examined further. The role of aggregate\ndyadic consonance as an explanation for why the relationship between the lack of roughness\nand preference is not linear could be studied with a higher number of chord sonorities. Also,\nthe crucial threshold of maximum roughness in simultaneous pitch combinations resulting in\na decline of preference should be investigated.\nThe current results suggest that vertical harmony perception may have more to do with\nhorizontal harmony perception with regard to single chords than has been previously\nthought; this finding is in line with Tramo et al. (2001) who point out that ``a listener's\nimplicit (or explicit) knowledge about harmony in the horizontal dimension bears on\nharmony perception in the vertical dimension'' (p. 96). Furthermore, it is tantalizing to\ndraw a parallel between these two distinct aspects of harmony when considering a\nhistorical point of view. As Parncutt (1989) points out (referring to Grout, 1960),\nhorizontal intervals between tones existed before simultaneous tones in music: ``History\nsuggests . . . that musical intervals (octaves, fifths) between sequential tones existed long\nLahdelma and Eerola 17\nbefore people started singing or playing tones simultaneously in music . . . '' (p. 9). Could this\nevolution of harmony somehow still affect the perception of vertical sonorities? The question\nof how the ear parses the overall consonance of simultaneous intervals in vertical pitch\ncombinations or whether it does so remains to be examined with future research.\n"
