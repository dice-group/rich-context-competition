Here, we assessed the association of spot albumin-to-\ncreatinine ratio with anemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and\nable adjustment including eGFR, higher albumin-to-creatinine ratios associated with anemia, acidosis,\nhypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension but only weakly associated with acidosis and\nanemia. Furthermore, the associations between albumin-to-creatinine ratio and both anemia and acido-\nsis were not consistent across eGFR strata. Higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio levels did not associate\nwith hyperphosphatemia. Lower eGFR associated with higher prevalence ratios for all complications, and\nthese associations were stronger than those observed for the albumin-to-creatinine ratio; after multi-\nvariable adjustment, however, the associations between eGFR and both hypoalbuminemia and hyper-\ntension were NS. In conclusion, albuminuria and eGFR differentially associate with complications of CKD.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide ma-\njor public health problem with an increasing prev-\nalence of kidney failure and poor outcomes.1 It is\nestimated that 11.5% of U.S. adults have CKD,2 and\nmultiple studies have demonstrated its relationship\nto an increased risk for mortality, cardiovascular\ndisease, and kidney failure.3\u00ad5\nCKD is defined by the presence of reduced esti-\nmated GFR (eGFR) or markers of kidney damage,\ngenerally determined by elevated albuminuria, and\nit is staged for severity primarily by level of eGFR.6,7\nRecent data have demonstrated that albuminuria is\na strong and independent predictor of risk for mor-\ntality, cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal dis-\nease, acute kidney injury, and CKD progression,\nand it has been suggested that incorporation of al-\nbuminuria into the CKD staging system will facili-\ntate clinical decision making regarding patients'\nprognosis.8\u00ad12 However, there is little data on\nwhether albuminuria is also associated with con-\ncurrent complications of CKD, which is also rele-\nvant for physicians' decisions regarding evaluation\nand management at a particular patient encounter.\nData from the U.S.-based National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) have\nbeen used to document the prevalence of CKD\ncomplications by level of eGFR in the general\nrelation between albuminuria and CKD compli-\nPublished online ahead of print.

We pooled data from the NHANES III,\ntermine the relationship between level of albuminuria and\nsix conditions considered to be complications of CKD: ane-\nmia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, hy-\nperparathyroidism, and hypertension. The association of\nalbuminuria and eGFR with these complications was evalu-\nated separately and in combination.\nRESULTS\nThe majority of the population had albumin-to-creatinine ra-\nrespectively (Table 1). Similarly, most people had eGFR 60\nml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively (Supplemental Table 1).\nThose with higher levels of ACR and lower eGFR were older,\nwere more likely to be non-Hispanic black, had a higher body\nmass index, and had diabetes mellitus (Table 1 and Supple-\nmental Table 1). Additionally, eGFR levels 90 ml/min per\n1.73 m2 were more common at higher ACR levels.\nHigher levels of ACR were associated with anemia, acidosis,\nhypoalbuminemia, and hyperparathyroidism but not hyper-\nphosphatemia (Figure 1). For hypertension, the prevalence ra-\ntio increased progressively through approximately ACR of 100\nmg/g and thereafter remained stable. For acidosis, there was an\nincrease in the prevalence ratio at approximately ACR of 30\nmg/g. Table 2 shows the prevalence and adjusted prevalence\nratios for the six complications by level of ACR. At ACR levels\n10 mg/g, 10% of the population had anemia, acidosis, hy-\nperphosphatemia, or hyperparathyroidism whereas 20.3% of\nthe population had hypertension. The prevalence of anemia,\nacidosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hyper-\ntension was higher with higher ACR, whereas the prevalence of\nTable 1.

After multivariable adjustment, there\nwas a graded association between higher levels of ACR and\nhigher prevalence ratios for anemia, acidosis, hypoalbumine-\nmia, and hyperparathyroidism, but there was a substantial at-\ntenuation of the relationship between ACR and hypertension,\nsuch that the prevalence ratios were similar for all ACR levels\n10 mg/g (Table 2). There appeared to be a threshold for\nhypoalbuminemia with a large increase in the prevalence ratio\nThese results were similar in sensitivity analyses, where we\nmodeled urine albumin concentration instead of ACR.\nThere was an increase in the prevalence of anemia, acidosis,\nhyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperparathy-\nroidism with decreasing levels of eGFR, with the increase in\nprevalence beginning at approximately eGFR of 60 ml/min per\n1.73 m2 for acidosis and hyperphosphatemia and at eGFR of 90\nml/min per 1.73 m2 for the remaining three complications.\nOther than for hypertension, there was also an increase in the\nthe most pronounced effects for anemia, hypoalbuminemia,\nand hyperparathyroidism (Figure 2). Table 3 shows the prev-\nalence and prevalence ratios for complications by level of\neGFR. In contrast to albuminuria, there was a significantly\nhigher prevalence of each complication at lower eGFR. Other\nthan hypertension, 10% of the population with eGFR  90\nml/min per 1.73 m2 had any complication, whereas for those\nhyperphosphatemia, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperpara-\nadjustment, an association remained between lower eGFR lev-\nels and higher prevalence ratios for anemia, acidosis, hyper-\nphosphatemia, and hyperparathyroidism, but not for hy-\npoalbuminemia or hypertension (Table 3).\nInstratifiedanalyses,theassociationbetweenACRandanemia\nand acidosis was present for certain eGFR strata (40 to 59 and\n0.036, respectively), whereas the association between ACR and\nhypoalbuminemia and hypertension was significant for multiple\nspectively; Table 4 with the number of participants in each\nACR/eGFR stratum provided in Supplemental Table 2).\nHigher ACR was not associated with an increased age-, race/\nethnicity-, and sex-adjusted prevalence for hyperphos-\nphatemia within any eGFR strata. Indeed, for eGFR levels 30\nphatemia was lower at higher ACR categories. Within most\nACR strata, the adjusted prevalence of anemia, acidosis, hy-\nperphosphatemia, and hypertension was higher at lower\nlevels of eGFR.\nFigure 1.

Recent publications have emphasized the role of\nalbuminuria, a marker of kidney damage to the glomerular\npermselectivity barrier, in predicting outcomes.8\u00ad12,16 Clinical\nencounters also focus on detection, evaluation, and manage-\nment of current conditions, as well as future risk of outcomes,\nand there are fewer data available on the association between\nACR and concurrent complications of CKD. The present anal-\nysis of a general population sample of U.S. adults showed a\nminimal association between higher levels of ACR and an in-\ncreased prevalence of anemia, hypoalbuminemia, acidosis, hy-\npertension, and hyperparathyroidism, and no association with\nhyperphosphatemia. In contrast, lower eGFR was strongly as-\nsociated with all six of these complications, although hyperten-\nsion and hypoalbuminemia were attenuated after adjustment\nfor demographic factors and comorbid conditions. These find-\nings have implications for clinical practice, research, and the\nclassification of CKD.\nSeveral studies have previously documented the strong as-\ntent with these prior studies, in the current analysis, a strong\nrelationship was observed between lower eGFR and a higher\nprevalence for all six concurrent complications. Associations\nremained strong for anemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia,\nand hyperparathyroidism, even after adjustment for demo-\ngraphic factors, cigarette smoking, body mass index, diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, and ACR. Associations with hyperten-\nsion were substantially attenuated after adjustment for age,\nwhich is likely secondary to the increasing prevalence of hyper-\ntension with older age regardless of level of eGFR. Although\nassociations with hypoalbuminemia were nonlinear at the low-\nest levels of eGFR, this may be secondary to small numbers of\npeople with hypoalbuminemia and severe reductions in eGFR.\nFor hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hyperten-\nsion, a significant association was observed at eGFR levels as\nhigh as 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, whereas the significant associ-\nation for anemia and acidosis started at eGFR of 60 ml/min per\n1.73 m2. A higher prevalence of complications was observed at\nthan hypertension.\nA graded relationship between ACR and anemia, acidosis,\nhypoalbuminemia, and hyperparathyroidism was observed.\nCompared with ACR 10 mg/g, people with ACR 300 mg/g\nprevalence ratio for anemia, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, and\nhyperparathyroidism, respectively. The prevalence of anemia\nand hyperparathyroidism began to increase at levels of ACR of\nhypoalbuminemia, and these associations were robust to ad-\njustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, eGFR, cigarette smoking,\ndiabetes, hypertension, and body mass index. Nevertheless, the\nFigure 2.

For all compli-\ncations, the associations were not as strong as was observed for\neGFR. No association was present between higher ACR levels\nand the prevalence of hyperphosphatemia, and even in the\nanalysis stratified by eGFR and ACR, the association was NS.\nAs with eGFR, the relationship with hypertension was substan-\ntially attenuated after adjustment, again likely demonstrating\nthe collinearity with age. Little data is available on ACR and\neach of these complications in the general population. How-\never, in patients with diabetes, it has been previously demon-\nTable 4.

These associa-\ntions are independent of eGFR, consistent across outcomes,\nand comparable in magnitude to the excess risk associated with\nlower eGFR.8\u00ad12,16 Taken together, data from multiple sources\nnow demonstrate that albuminuria is a strong risk factor for\nlong-term outcomes and is moderately associated with some\nbut not all complications of CKD. These divergent findings\nlikely reflect the relationship of concurrent complications with\ndifferent functions of the kidney, the heterogeneous nature of\nCKD, and other nonrenal causes for these abnormalities. One\npossible explanation is that excretions of both hydrogen ions\nand phosphate are specifically regulated by the renal tubule\nand that these excretory functions are more closely related to\nGFR. A second possible explanation is that albuminuria may\nreflect systemic disorders that result in inflammation and gen-\neralized endothelial damage, and that anemia, hypertension,\nand hyperparathyroidism are secondary to these systemic dis-\norders as well as decreased GFR. This is more expected with\nanemia and hypertension than with hyperparathyroidism, but\nthere is some preliminary supporting evidence for this hypoth-\nesis. Prior studies have described the association of low vitamin\nD levels to higher C-reactive protein.22 Treatment with vitamin\nD in animal studies and humans has decreased albumin-\nuria.23\u00ad25 Hypoalbuminemia may relate in part to urinary pro-\ntein loss, or to malnutrition, but may also be related to systemic\ninflammation and endothelial dysfunction.\nIn many prior analyses, a J-shaped relationship has been\nobserved between eGFR and long-term and concurrent com-\nplications of CKD, reflecting low creatinine generation and\noverestimation of measured GFR in people with muscle wast-\ning.3,26 In the current analyses, the J-shaped relationship was\nobserved with all complications other than hypertension but\nwas most pronounced with anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and\nhyperparathyroidism. Lower levels of hemoglobin, bicarbon-\nate, and serum albumin at higher eGFR levels have been ob-\nserved previously. However, most prior analyses have focused\non hyperparathyroidism at lower levels of GFR, and it has not\nbeen reported at higher eGFR levels.13\u00ad14,27 Presumably, the\nJ-shaped relationship identifies a group of people with chronic\ndisease leading to muscle wasting. If anemia, hypoalbumine-\nmia, and hyperparathyroidism do reflect systemic disease, as\nwas hypothesized above, then this may provide a possible ex-\nplanation as to why these conditions were most strongly asso-\nciated with the J-shaped curve.\nCurrently, there are proposals to include albuminuria in the\nstaging system for CKD given its predictive power for the oc-\ncurrence of long-term outcomes.28 These proposals assume\nthat its inclusion will facilitate patient care. For long-term out-\ncomes, the strong associations may mean that knowing a pa-\ntient's albuminuria level will help clinicians develop prognoses\nfor patients, and as such may possibly facilitate decisions re-\ngarding treatment. More studies are required before specific\nstrategies can be implemented. In the current study, ACR was\nassociated with only some of the complications that were eval-\nuated, and apart from hypoalbuminemia, the prevalence of\ncomplications at higher levels of ACR among individuals with\nappear to contribute much additional information for identi-\nfication of patients who should be tested for most CKD com-\nplications or who may require specialized care for these com-\nplications. Recommendations for the evaluation and\nmanagement of decreased GFR and elevated albuminuria\nshould differ depending upon the specific outcome and com-\nplication in question.\nStrengths of the analysis include a large ethnically diverse\nrepresentative sample, measurement of multiple CKD compli-\ncations, and rigorously collected data using standardized pro-\ntocols and laboratory procedures. In addition, there are several\nlimitations of this analysis. First, we evaluated only selected\ncomplications. Nevertheless, we purposely selected complica-\ntions that reflect different biologic processes. Second, ACR was\nused to assess albuminuria and, consistent with most large ep-\nidemiology studies, a 24-hour urine collection was not feasible.\nOnly a single ACR measurement was available. It is estimated\nthat approximately 50% of individuals with ACR 30 mg/g on\na single measurement will not have persistent albuminuria.29\nFurthermore, the ACR may be high due to extremely low levels\nof creatinine as well as high levels of albuminuria; however,\nresults were consistent when considering urinary albumin\nconcentration rather than ACR. Third, different assays were\nused across the NHANES for some biochemical measures (e.g.,\nbicarbonate). Fourth, despite a large sample size, there were\nsome cells with small numbers. In particular, there were few\npeople with lower levels of eGFR and higher albuminuria lev-\nels. Hypoalbuminemia is uncommon and associations for this\ncomplication had wide confidence intervals, and the patterns\nobserved may be secondary to these small numbers. Fifth, im-\nmunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was only available\non a subset of participants, and we were not able to perform an\nanalysis stratified by ACR and eGFR for this complication. Fi-\nnally, although we adjusted for C-reactive protein, we are not\nable to state with certainty that associations between albumin-\nuria or eGFR with concurrent complications are mediated by\ninflammation because only a low-sensitivity C-reactive protein\nassay was available in NHANES III.\nIn conclusion, ACR was significantly associated with ane-\nmia, acidosis hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and\nhypertension but not with hyperphosphatemia. However, the\nassociations for anemia and acidosis were not consistent\nwithin eGFR strata, and relationships were substantially\nweaker than those observed between eGFR and these same\ncomplications. Revisions to the CKD classification system\nshould consider implications for all aspects of the clinical ac-\ntion plan including these complications.\nwww.jasn.org\nStudy Population\nThe NHANES are cross-sectional, multistage, stratified, clustered\nprobability samples of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized popula-\ntion conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.

Prevalence ratios are recommended for use in cross-sec-\ntional studies with common outcomes32; therefore, with ACR 10\nmg/g as the reference group, log-linear generalized estimating equa-\ntions were used to calculate the prevalence ratios for anemia, acidosis,\nhyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, hypoalbuminemia, and\nhypertension associated with higher levels of ACR.
