    "abstract": "Abstract\nResearch with European Caucasian samples demonstrates that attractiveness-based biases in social evaluation depend on the\nconstellation of the sex of the evaluator and the sex of the target: Whereas people generally show positive biases toward\nattractive opposite-sex persons, they show less positive or even negative biases toward attractive same-sex persons. By\nexamining these biases both within and between different ethnicities, the current studies provide new evidence for both the\ngeneralizability and the specificity of these attractiveness-based social perception biases. Examining within-ethnicity effects, Study\n1 is the first to demonstrate that samples from diverse ethnic backgrounds parallel the finding of European Caucasian samples: The\nadvantageous or adverse effects of attractiveness depend on the gender constellation of the evaluator and the evaluated person.\nExamining between-ethnicity effects, Study 2 found that these attractiveness-based biases emerge almost exclusively toward\ntargets of the evaluator's own ethnic background; these biases were reduced or eliminated for cross-ethnicity evaluations and\ninteraction intentions. We discuss these findings in light of evolutionary principles and reflect on potential interactions between\nculture and evolved cognitive mechanisms.\n",

Maner5\n Keywords\nphysical attractiveness, cognitive bias, biological sex, ethnicity, social evaluation\nImagine a manager evaluating a very attractive job applicant.\nWould the candidate's attractiveness give him or her an advan-\ntage in the job selection process? Most of the extant literature\nprovides a clear answer to this question: Yes, it would. Attrac-\ntiveness has been shown to exert powerful positive effects on\nsocial evaluation and decision-making (Langlois et al., 2000;\nHowever, recent research suggests that the manager's reac-\ntion to the candidate's attractiveness might depend on whether\nor not the manager and candidate are of the same sex. Although\npeople tend to positively evaluate attractive members of the\nopposite sex, the same does not always hold true for evalua-\ntions of the same sex. Indeed, people often see attractive mem-\nbers of their own sex as a threat--both to their self-esteem and\nto their relationships and reproductive success (Gutierres, Ken-\nrick, & Partch, 1999). From an evolutionary perspective,\nattractive same-sex persons may be perceived as rivals (Bleske\nRouby, & Miller, 2007), so that people might sometimes react\nnegatively to them (Buss & Dedden, 1990; Buss, Shackelford,\n1 Department of Psychology, Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Munich,\nGermany\n2 Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany\n3 University Seeburg Castle (USC), Seekirchen, Austria\n4 Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Munich, Germany\n5 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMaria Agthe, Department of Psychology, Ludwig Maximilians University of\nEmail: mariaagthe@lmu.de\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nlancourt, 2013). Consequently, the manager might be inclined\nto derogate an attractive same-sex applicant (Agthe, Spo\n\u00a8rrle, &\nBut now imagine that the attractive same-sex candidate and\nthe manager are of different ethnic groups. Would the manager\nstill derogate the attractive same-sex applicant? Or, instead,\nmight differences in their ethnicities change their social\nschema such that the applicant is no longer perceived as a\nthreat? In the current article, we demonstrate that whether\nsomeone is evaluating an individual of the same versus a dif-\nferent ethnicity plays a critical role in whether attractiveness\naffects social judgment and decision-making. Examining the\nmoderating effects of ethnicity provides a fruitful opportunity\nto investigate both the generalizability and the specificity of\nattractiveness-based social evaluation biases.\nPositive and Negative Effects of Attractiveness\non Social Evaluation\nAcross cultures, attractive persons receive favorable interper-\nsonal evaluations (Chen, Shaffer, & Wu, 1997; Shaffer, Cre-\nreflect people's desire to interact with good-looking persons\nbecause they represent social opportunities (e.g., as romantic\npartners; Lemay et al., 2010). From an evolutionary perspec-\ntive, physical attractiveness is highly valued because it serves\nas a cue to the health, level of genetic fitness, and fertility of\npotential partners (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000; Kenrick &\n\u00a8ger, Oberzaucher, Katina, Holzleitner, &\npeople tend to categorize opposite-sex persons on their level of\nphysical attractiveness (Li & Kenrick, 2006) and react favor-\nably to good-looking persons of the other sex (Maner & Acker-\nDespite the generally positive effects of attractiveness, stud-\nies with European Caucasian samples also indicate negative\neffects of being attractive. People's preference for attractive\nmates may lead them to perceive attractive same-sex persons\nas intrasexual rivals, and the perception of such rivals is linked\nwith the activation of mate-guarding motives (Maner & Acker-\nMiller, Rouby, & Gailliot, 2009). This perception of attractive\nsame-sex persons as potential rivals even occurs automatically\nand without awareness (Buunk, Massar, & Dijkstra, 2007; Mas-\nsar & Buunk, 2010), thus pointing to an adaptive sensitivity to\nrelevant social categories. Because attractive same-sex persons\nelicit unfavorable upward social comparisons (Jones & Buck-\ningham, 2005) and serve as intrasexual rivals over relationship\nopportunities (Gutierres et al., 1999), people tend to perceive\nattractive same-sex individuals as threats to self-esteem (Park &\nas soon as people reach sexual maturity (Agthe, Spo\n\u00a8rrle, Frey,\nWalper, & Maner, 2013), they tend to derogate (Fo\n\u00a8rsterling,\n(Agthe,Spo\n\u00a8rrle,&Fo\nsame-sex persons. In addition, women display heightened vigi-\nlance to attractive intrasexual rivals during the fertile phase of\ntheir menstrual cycle, the time during which the women's repro-\nductive prospects are most salient (e.g., Fisher, 2004).\nNegative responses to attractive same-sex persons have been\nfound not only in romantic contexts (Maner, Gailliot, Rouby,\ntional decision-making (Agthe, Spo\nEuropean Caucasian samples confronted with same-ethnicity\ntargets, the nature of attractiveness biases depends on whether\none is evaluating a target of the same sex or the opposite sex.\nDo Attractiveness-Based Social Evaluation Biases\nGeneralize to Other Ethnic Groups?\nThe underlying adaptive social motives these attractiveness-\nbased evaluation biases are designed to serve (cf. Neuberg,\nKenrick, Maner, & Schaller, 2004; Kenrick, Delton, Robertson,\nBecker, & Neuberg, 2007) are relatively universal across cul-\ntures and ethnicities (Buss, 1989): Despite cultural differences\nin the importance of attractiveness (Anderson, Adams, & Plaut,\n2008), persons from different cultures still regard attractiveness\nas a valuable criterion for mate choice (Buss, 1989; Chang,\nWang, Shackelford, & Buss, 2011; Kamble, Shackelford,\nPham, & Buss, 2014), so that across cultures, attractive\nopposite-sex persons tend to receive favorable social evalua-\nHowever, this preference for attractive persons seems to be\nlimited to opposite-sex targets (Li & Zhou, 2014). In many\ncultures, attractive same-sex targets are regarded with jealousy\nthat also in non-European Caucasian samples, people will per-\nceive highly attractive members of their own sex and ethnicity\nas a threat and, consequently, will respond negatively toward\nthem (e.g., derogate them). Thus, we predicted that, across\ndifferent ethnicities, participants would positively evaluate\nattractive opposite-sex targets, but negatively evaluate attrac-\ntive same-sex targets. We test this hypothesis in Study 1.\nDo Attractiveness-Based Biases Generalize\nto Between-Ethnicity Evaluations?\nEven though persons from different ethnicities and cultures\ntend to generally agree on whom they consider attractive (Coet-\nzee, Greeff, Stephen, & Perrett, 2014; Cunningham, Roberts,\nattractiveness-based biases will be reduced or even eliminated\nfor between-ethnicity evaluations. That is, although an individ-\nual may respond in a biased way to attractive members of their\nown ethnicity, such biases may not be as strong when members\nof a different ethnicity are evaluated.\nThere are three (not mutually exclusive) reasons for this\nprediction: First, members of other ethnic groups may be rel-\natively less likely than same-ethnicity targets to be seen as\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\npotential mates and romantic rivals (e.g., Eastwick, Richeson,\nthat people's ability to judge health cues (like natural skin color\nvariation) for other-ethnicity targets is rather limited (com-\npared with same-ethnicity targets). Thus, people might be more\nsensitive to mating-related cues in targets who share their own\nethnicity. This might partially result from socialization, such as\nthe perception that family acceptance for a partner of another\nethnicity would be rather low (Mills, Daly, Longmore, & Kil-\nbiases (including preferences for same-ethnicity partners) may\nalso be linked to adaptive motives such as greater caution and\nvigilance toward (particularly male) out-group members (Maner\nyoungchildrenshowfavorablereactionstowardthosewhobelong\nto their own social category (for reviews, see Bigler & Liben,\nComer, 1989), and even though explicit ethnicity-related biases\nbecome more egalitarian across individual development, implicit\nattitudes favoring the in-group remain stable (Baron & Banaji,\nthat people have evolved to categorize others into racial or ethnic\ncategories (see Cosmides, Tooby, & Kurzban, 2003), race and\nethnicity serve as important group markers in modern cultural\ncontexts. Accordingly, some studies find evidence for a potential\n(though not always strong and completely consistent) own-race\npreference in attractiveness judgments (Burke, Nolan, Hayward,\nSecond, a key feature of whether a target person is perceived\nas a potential mating rival involves the perceived likelihood\nthat a potential mate (whom oneself desires) would be inter-\nested in the target person. Given that people typically prefer to\ndate and mate within ethnicity (e.g., Hitsch, Hortac\n\u00b8su, &\n2011), one might perceive a relatively lower likelihood that a\npotential (or current) mate would view members of other eth-\nnicities as desirable partners. That is, one might be relatively\nless likely to see same-sex members of other ethnicities (versus\nthe same ethnicity) as rivals because they are less likely to be\nviewed as desirable by one's own romantic interests.\nThird, other-ethnicity targets might be perceived as rela-\ntively less relevant for appearance-based social comparison\nbecause they appear to be less similar to the evaluator and are,\nthus, less likely to elicit self-other comparison (Tesser, 1988;\nMajor, Testa, & Bylsma, 1991). That is, other-ethnicity targets\nare less likely to pose a threat to one's self-esteem and to be\nperceived as a potential object of social comparison. Accord-\ningly, attractiveness-based biases are hypothesized to be stron-\nger for targets of one's own ethnicity than for targets of another\nethnicity. We test this hypothesis in Study 2.\nOverview of the Current Research\nAcross cultures, adaptive mating-related motives may guide\nsocial perception (e.g., for Caucasian samples, see Maner,\nGailliot, Rouby, Miller, et al., 2007, and for Asian samples,\nsee Li et al., 2015). Given that the social motives underlying\nattractiveness-based biases (e.g., mating, social comparison)\nare presumed to be relatively universal, we hypothesize that\nthose biases will generalize to other-ethnicity samples evaluat-\ning targets of their own ethnic background (Study 1). With\nregard to between-group effects, we hypothesize that European\nCaucasians will display larger evaluative biases when judging\nmembers of their own ethnicity than members of other ethni-\ncities (Study 2).\nStudy 1 tests the hypothesis that, across samples from diverse\nnon-Caucasian ethnic backgrounds (i.e., Asia [AS], Middle\nEast [ME], Latin America [LA]), people will evaluate attrac-\ntive same- and opposite-sex targets of their own ethnicity in\nbiased ways (i.e., attractiveness will have a positive influence\nfor opposite-sex constellations, and a negative influence for\nsame-sex constellations). That is, paralleling the findings of\nCaucasian samples these biases should generalize to the\nwithin-ethnicity evaluations of non-Caucasian samples and\nbe reflected in attributions as well as social interaction\nintentions.\nMaterials and Method\nParticipants\nand AS (n \u00bc 195) staying at German language schools and\nuniversities for language courses participated in our study.\nhad advanced German-language skills.\nDesign and Procedure\nFor each ethnic group (i.e., LA, ME, AS), Study 1 employed a 2\n(participant sex) \u00c2 2 (target sex) \u00c2 2 (target attractiveness;\nhighly attractive versus less attractive) between-subjects\ndesign.\nSimilar to prior studies (Agthe et al., 2008; Fo\n\u00a8rsterling et al.,\n2007), participants received a scenario describing the occupa-\ntional history and success of a target person. It contained edu-\ncational (e.g., education in home country), occupational (e.g.,\nemployed as a doctor in Germany), and social (e.g., family)\nbackground information about the target and highlighted the\ntarget's early career success. This information was constant\nacross all experimental conditions. In addition, the materials\nincluded a passport-sized black and white facial photograph of\nthe target, which portrayed a male or female, highly attractive\nor less attractive person of each of the three different ethnic\ngroups. Photographs were prerated and selected for higher and\nlower attractiveness in an independent pretest: Across ethnici-\nties, attractive targets were between 7.00 and 9.00 and less\nrating scale. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the\nAgthe et al. 3\nfour experimental conditions; all targets matched participants'\nethnic groups (i.e., each participant only saw a stimulus person\nof his or her own ethnicity). After reading the scenario, parti-\ncipants responded to measures of social evaluation and desire\nfor social interaction as well as a manipulation check. The\nmethods of both studies were evaluated and approved by a\nuniversity research ethics committee.\nMeasures\nExplicit measures of social evaluation can elicit social desir-\nability effects and other response biases. Thus, instead of ask-\ning people to explicitly evaluate each target, we used a more\nimplicit attributional measure used in previous research to tap\nunderlying biases in social judgment (Agthe et al., 2008; Fo\n\u00a8r-\nsterling et al., 2007). Using 2 items (from 1 \u00bc not important to\n10 \u00bc very important), participants attributed the target's early\ncareer success to ability as well as to luck. As in previous\nresearch, the difference score between these 2 items served\nas dependent variable reflecting the extent to which partici-\npants attributed the target's successes to internal versus exter-\nnal causes. Previous studies (Agthe et al., 2008; Fo\n\u00a8rsterling\net al., 2007) have shown that positive social evaluations foster\ninternal attributions of success (i.e., to ability), whereas nega-\ntive evaluations promote external attributions (i.e., to luck).\nSubsequently, participants provided measures of their desire\nfor social interaction with the target: Participants reported the\ndegree to which they would like to (a) work with the candidate\nand (b) become friends with the candidate (1 \u00bc not at all, 10 \u00bc\nvery much). The two variables were highly correlated (.60 r\n.75 for the three samples) and were averaged to create a\ncomposite measure of desire for social interaction. As manip-\nulation check, participants rated the target's attractiveness from\n1 (unattractive) to 10 (very attractive).\nResults\nManipulation Check\nIn all three ethnic samples, the attractive targets (Moverall\n\u00bc\n7.18, SD \u00bc 1.97) were perceived as better looking than the less\nattractive targets (Moverall\nEvaluative Attributions\nFirst, we examined the hypothesized Participant Sex \u00c2 Target\nSex \u00c2 Target Attractiveness three-way interaction.

However, they provided more positive\nattributions for attractive females than for less attractive\nfemales, p < .01. These findings provide first evidence that the\nrecently described three-way interaction between respondent\nsex, target sex, and target attractiveness found for European\nCaucasian samples generalizes to non-Caucasian samples.\nEven though we detected no significant influence of ethni-\ncity on the three-way interaction (see above), we conducted\nexploratory analyses for each ethnic group (i.e., LA, AS, and\nME) to confirm that the expected pattern was present in each of\nthe three ethnicities (see Table 1). For all three ethnicities, we\ndetected the hypothesized three-way interaction, Fs > 5.00, ps\n< .05, which predominantly (i.e., in 11 of 3 [ethnicity] \u00c2 4\n[respondent sex-target sex constellation)] \u00bc 12 conditions) was\nin line with the hypothesized response pattern (i.e., more pos-\nitive evaluations for attractive targets in opposite-sex constel-\nlations and more negative evaluations for attractive targets in\nsame-sex constellations, Table 1). The only exception was for\nmales from the ME who unexpectedly tended to show a (insig-\nnificant) preference for attractive male targets, p \u00bc .08.\nDesire for Social Interaction\nAs before, we examined the hypothesized Participant Sex \u00c2\nTarget Sex \u00c2 Target Attractiveness three-way interaction.\nBecause we again detected no significant influence of ethnicity\non this interaction (i.e., the four-way interaction was not sig-\nnificant, p > .15), we aggregated data across ethnicities.\nA 2 (participant sex) \u00c2 2 (target sex) \u00c2 2 (target attractive-\nness) analysis of variance revealed significant main effects for\nparticipant sex, p < .05, as well as target sex, p < .05, indicating\noverall higher desire for social interaction intentions for female\n(compared to male) participants and concerning male (compared\nto female) targets. More importantly, these lower order effects\nwere qualified by the hypothesized three-way interaction, F(1,\nbottom of Table 2). In order to elucidate this interaction, we\nfollowed the same analytical approach as before: Lower order\ntwo-way interactions confirmed Target Sex \u00c2 Target Attractive-\nexpressed less desire to interact with attractive female targets\ncompared to less attractive female targets, p < .005, but greater\ndesire to interact with attractive male targets compared to less\nattractive male targets, p < .05. Similarly, male participants were\nless inclined to interact with attractive male targets compared to\nless attractive male targets, p < .005, whereas they expressed an\nincreased desire to interact with attractive females compared to\nless attractive females, p < .005.\nEven though we did not detect a four-way interaction (i.e.,\nno effect of the ethnicities on the three-way interaction), we\nanalyzed the three non-Caucasian samples separately. The\nhypothesized three-way interaction was (marginally) signifi-\nwith the hypothesized response pattern (i.e., more positive eva-\nluations for attractive targets in opposite-sex constellations and\nmore negative evaluations for attractive targets in same-sex\nconstellations, see Table 2).\nDiscussion\nFindings from Study 1 provide some of the first empirical sup-\nport for the hypothesis that attractiveness-based biases in social\nevaluation (which operate in opposite directions depending on\nTable 2.

In 23 of the 24 (\u00bc 4 respondent sex-target sex\ncombinations \u00c2 3 ethnicities \u00c2 2 depending variables) constel-\nlations, individuals positively evaluated attractive members of\nthe opposite sex but negatively evaluated attractive (in compar-\nison to less attractive) members of their own sex. These findings\nare in line with the notion that social comparison and adaptive\nmating-related motives (i.e., mate search and intrasexual com-\npetition)--which can be found cross-culturally--might contrib-\nute to the bias. That is, positive responses might reflect approach\nmotivation (toward attractive opposite-sex targets as social\nopportunities; Lemay et al., 2010), whereas negative responses\nmight reflect avoidance motivation (away from attractive same-\nsex targets as social threats; Agthe et al., 2011).\nInterestingly, the biased response pattern for participants'\ndesire for social interaction with same-ethnicity target per-\nsons was somewhat smaller in the AS sample, which hints\nat potential cultural variations of the bias. For instance, this\ncorresponds to findings indicating that reactions toward a\npartner's imagined infidelity are somewhat less intense in\nAS samples compared to Western samples (Geary, Rumsey,\nBow-Thomas, & Hoard, 1995), which might point to lower\nunderlying rivalry. Yet, research with AS participants\naccords with Western findings that the preference for attrac-\ntive persons seems to be limited to opposite-sex targets (Li\nTo our knowledge, Study 1 is the first research that showed that\nattractiveness-based biases which depend on the sex constella-\ntion of respondent and target (i.e., consistent positive versus\nrather negative effects for opposite-sex versus same-sex target\nattractiveness) generalize to non-Caucasian ethnicities' within-\ngroup ratings. This has so far almost exclusively been docu-\nmented for European Caucasian samples. Study 2 extends these\nfindings by addressing corresponding between-ethnicity effects\nfor the first time. Based on considerations that self-other com-\nparison as well as mating-related motives tend to be less strong\nregarding other than one's own ethnicity, Study 2 tests the\nspecificity of attractiveness-based social evaluation biases.\nWe hypothesize that these biases would be replicated for a\nCaucasian sample evaluating Caucasian targets (which would\nbe in line with former findings) but would be reduced or elim-\ninated for Caucasian participants evaluating non-Caucasian\n(i.e., African, AS, LA, ME) targets (which so far has not been\nempirically examined).\nMaterials and Method\nParticipants\nA total of N \u00bc 2,557 German participants of Caucasian ethni-\ncity were recruited at several universities across Germany.\nDesign and Procedure\nStudy 2 employed a 2 (participant sex) \u00c2 2 (target sex) \u00c2 2\n(target attractiveness; highly attractive vs. less attractive) \u00c2 5\n(target ethnicity) between-subjects design.\nThe procedure was identical to that used in Study 1. Target\nStudy 1, the Caucasian-only sample of Study 2 provided eva-\nluations of targets from their own as well as from other ethni-\ncities. Thus, only in the case of Caucasian targets, participant\nand target were of the same ethnicity. In addition to the picture\nsets of Study 1 (i.e., pictures of LA, ME, and AS stimulus\npersons), pretested picture sets of African and Caucasian target\npersons (according to the same selection criteria as in Study 1)\nwere used.\nMeasures\nWe used the same measures as in Study 1, that is, the difference\nscores of attributions to ability minus attributions to luck (con-\ncerning the target person's occupational success), the 2-item\nmeasure (r \u00bc .68) of desire for social interaction with the target\nperson, and the manipulation check of target attractiveness.\nResults\nManipulation Check\nIn all five target ethnicity samples, the attractive targets (Moverall\n\u00bc 7.24, SD \u00bc 1.97) were perceived as better looking than the\nless attractive targets (Moverall\nSame-ethnicity and other-ethnicity targets did not differ signif-\nicantly in the attractiveness ratings they received, p > .90.

In contrast, male participants provided less positive\nattributions for attractive male targets than for less attractive\nmale targets, whereas they tended to provide more positive\nevaluations for attractive compared to less attractive female\ntargets (for mean values, see Table 3 bottom row). This three-\nway interaction did not reach significance when participants\nevaluated targets from other (i.e., non-Caucasian) ethnicities,\nWhen distinguishing between the different non-Caucasian eth-\nnicities, no significant three-way interaction emerged for any of\nthe non-Caucasian target ethnicities either, Fs < 1.50, ps > .22.\nThere was neither a consistent pattern of attractivesame-sextarget\nderogation nor systematic evidence of glorification of attractive\nopposite-sex targets (for mean values, see Table 3 first four rows).\nDesire for Social Interaction\nIn line with the previous analysis, we ran a 2 (participant sex) \u00c2\n2 (target sex) \u00c2 2 (target attractiveness) \u00c2 2 (ethnicity con-\nstellation) analysis of variance.\nAs hypothesized, we detected a significant four-way inter-\nthe three-way interaction between respondent sex, target sex,\n.01, varied as a function of whether respondents provided\nanswers regarding their own or a different ethnicity.

In line with our hypotheses\nand the already confirmed four-way interaction, this three-way\ninteraction was not observed when respondents provided\nresponses regarding targets from other ethnicities, F(1, 2,038)\nFor explorative purposes, we ran separate analyses for the\ndifferent ethnicities of the targets.

This three-way interaction regarding LA (i.e.,\nother ethnicity) targets was significantly smaller than the pre-\nviously described interaction observed for Caucasian (i.e.,\nTable 3.

Moreover, as hypothesized, this biased response\npattern did not emerge for evaluations of other-ethnicity tar-\ngets. The attractiveness-sex constellation had no effect on the\noverall evaluations of other-ethnicity targets, thereby pointing\nto the possibility that the latter might be relatively less relevant\nfor the respondents. This is consistent with preferences to date\nsame-ethnicity partners (Lin & Lundquist, 2013; Pota\n^rca\n &\nMills, 2015) and findings of racial exclusion of other-\nethnicity persons in mate search by different ethnic groups\n(e.g., AS, Caucasian, LA), particularly regarding the mate pre-\nferences of Whites (Herman & Campbell, 2012; Robnett &\nFeliciano, 2011). Moreover, persons from an ethnic group other\nthan one's own are more readily associated with the presence of\nthreat (compared with persons of one's own ethnicity; Olsson\nThe only exception in the pattern found in this study per-\ntained to responses to LA targets, such that desire for social\ninteraction with LA targets varied as a function of their attrac-\ntiveness. These results from the Caucasian sample suggesting\nthat positive responses to attractive opposite-sex persons as\nwell as negative reactions toward attractive same-sex persons\nemerged more strongly for European Caucasians and LAs than\nfor targets from other ethnic backgrounds fit with findings\nindicating that Caucasians seem to prefer Whites and LAs as\npotential partners (Feliciano et al., 2009), that mate poaching--\nwhich might enhance the sensitivity to rivalry--is more fre-\nquent in Europe and LA than in other (i.e., AS or African)\ncultures (Schmitt et al., 2004), and that LA students are more\nlikely than other ethnic groups to date interculturally (Keels &\nHarris, 2014). Moreover, regarding partner preferences, the\n``Latino-White boundary'' seems to be less rigid than other\nethnic barriers: Latino Americans tend to prefer other Latinos\nor Caucasians as mates (Feliciano, Lee, & Robnett, 2011). This\nis in line with notions that mating rivalry is not completely\nlimited to one's in-group (Klavina & Buunk, 2013). However,\nthe overall pattern for LA targets was not the same as that for\nCaucasian targets, and the pattern did not generalize to social\nevaluations. Thus, on the whole, results suggest that\nattractiveness-based social evaluation biases did not generalize\nto between-ethnicity contexts.\nGeneral Discussion\nPhysical attractiveness exerts powerful biases on social percep-\ntion. Recent research suggests that the well-documented posi-\ntive stereotypes about good-looking people reflect a desire for\nsocial interaction (Lemay et al., 2010) because attractiveness\noften represents the presence of desirable social opportunities.\nConversely, negative social reactions may be directed toward\nattractive members of one's own sex who are perceived as\nthreatening in the context of social relationships (Agthe\net al., 2011). To date, this pattern has so far been documented\nalmost exclusively in European Caucasian samples.\nTable 4.

The current findings thus provide new evidence for both\nthe generalizability and the specificity of attractiveness-based\nbiases in social perception.\nStudy 1 extends prior research by showing that\nattractiveness-based social evaluation biases are not restricted\nto Caucasian ethnicities from Western cultures. When evaluat-\ning members of their own ethnicity, AS, ME, and LA partici-\npants displayed positive biases toward attractive opposite-sex\npersons and negative biases toward attractive same-sex per-\nsons. The findings are consistent with evolutionarily inspired\nthat, across many cultures, highly attractive individuals reflect\nboth desirable mating opportunities (opposite-sex targets) as\nwell as potential relationship threats (same-sex targets). Our\nfindings support the notion that attractiveness biases might be\nbased, at least in part, on universal adaptive motives linked to\nmating and related social comparison processes.\nIt is worth noting that explanations for attractiveness-based\nbiases, which involve mate preferences and rivalry on the one\nhand, and social comparison as well as threats to one's self-\nesteem on the other hand, are not mutually exclusive. Because\nphysical attractiveness represents a highly desirable criterion\nfor mate choice across different cultures and ethnicities (Buss,\n1989), it is likely also to be relevant for social comparison and\nself-esteem cross-culturally. As prior research suggests (Agthe\njudgment biases that emerge as a function of attractiveness are\nunlikely to be caused merely by concerns associated with self-\nesteem and social comparison. Rather, these processes may in\npart reflect proximate manifestations of underlying adaptive\nmating-related motives.\nInterestingly, the attractiveness-based biases were found\nboth in women and men. Although women generally compete\nmore on the dimension of physical attractiveness than men do\nattractiveness is important for both sexes (e.g., Asendorpf,\nyoung adulthood. Because women display a preference for\ngood-looking men (e.g., Niesta Kayser, Agthe, & Maner,\n2016), physical attractiveness also represents an important\ndimension of rivalry for men, although comparison dimensions\nsuch as status and dominance gain more and more importance\nfor them with increasing age.\nStudy 2 contributes to the literature by demonstrating that\nattractiveness biases are stronger when one is evaluating a mem-\nber of one's own ethnicity than when one is evaluating a member\nof a different ethnicity. European Caucasian participants showed\nno significant attractiveness bias toward African, AS, or ME\ntargets, despite recognizing other-ethnicity targets as highly\nattractive. The only exception to this pattern emerged for LA\ntargets: In line with the attractiveness stereotype, male and\nfemale participants wished to have contact with attractive\nopposite-sex persons. In addition, female participants preferred\nto avoid attractive same-sex targets. However, these\nattractiveness-based biases did not extend to social evaluations\nand were significantly smaller in size compared to the biased\nresponse pattern regarding same-ethnicity targets.\nAttractiveness-based biases are presumed to be linked to\nmating-related motives and related social comparison processes\nVijver, 2006). Thus, although individuals certainly form and\nmaintain romantic relationships with members of other ethnici-\nties, the current findings are in line with evidence suggesting that\nmating-related social evaluation biases may be observed most\nstrongly when individuals are exposed to members of their own\nMontoya, Horton, & Kirchner, 2008). Particularly regarding the\nfirst stage of contact (i.e., when initiating romantic interest), the\ndegree of self-segregation is comparably higher than when reci-\nprocating romantic interest (Lewis, 2013), so that a preference\nfor persons of one's own ethnicity may dominate mate-searching\nbehavior for both men and women (Lin & Lundquist, 2013).\nGiven that prior research has often documented negative\nbiases toward ethnic out-group members, it is interesting that,\nin the case of attractiveness-based biases within specific sex-\nconstellations, being of a different ethnicity might sometimes\nbe beneficial. There were actually less negative reactions\ntoward attractive same-sex persons when the person being\nevaluated was of a different ethnicity, arguably because\nreduced similarity and comparability might have lessened the\nperceived threat to one's relationships and self-esteem. The\nrelatively smaller negative bias for out-group members can\nbe contrasted with the numerous studies indicating strong neg-\native biases toward out-group members (Plant, Goplen, &\nUnkelbach, Forgas, & Denson, 2008). The differences in find-\nings likely derive from the fact that the types of threat denoted\nby out-group members in previous studies (e.g., threat to phys-\nical safety; Maner et al., 2005) are categorically different than\nthe type of threat typically posed by attractive individuals (e.g.,\nthreats to one's romantic relationship).\nThe emergence of different reactions to attractive opposite-\nsex and same-sex persons between and within ethnicities is\nconsistent with the fundamental social motives framework\n(Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, & Schaller, 2010): Due to\ntheir centrality over the course of human evolutionary history,\nmotivational states associated with survival and reproductive\nsuccess are able to direct processing of social information in\norder to manage the relevant benefits and costs of social life\n(Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller, 2010;\nNeel, Kenrick, White, & Neuberg, 2015). Mate search and\nintrasexual competition may functionally shape people's reac-\ntions to attractive other sex versus same-sex persons when the\ntargets appear relevant in the respective context, activating\nmotives designed to avoid negative outcomes by potential riv-\nals and to gain access to potential mates. Accordingly, our\nfindings are in line with evolutionarily inspired empirical find-\nings suggesting that adaptive motives such as mate seeking,\nAgthe et al. 9\nmate retention, or self-protection can bias interpersonal percep-\ntion of, attention to, and cognitions about individuals who dif-\nfer in gender, physical attractiveness, and ethnicity (Li et al.,\nMueller, 2003). Such effects often reflect adaptive biases\nmeant to help individuals reap the benefits and avoid the costs\nassociated with social living.\nOne interesting question for future research pertains to\nwhether or not the reduced attractiveness-based biases regard-\ning out-group members might be specific for European Cauca-\nsian respondents because individualistic (in comparison to\ncollectivist) cultures generally show less inclination to devalue\nout-group members (Triandis & Gelfand, 2012).\nLimitations and Future Directions\nLimitations of the current research offer useful avenues for fur-\nther investigation. One limitation is that Study 1's non-\nCaucasian participants were temporarily living in Germany (for\na language course or a semester as an exchange student). Thus,\nthe sample is relatively selective in that it only includes people\nwho were able and willing to study abroad. Moreover, some\nacculturation may have occurred because, by attending language\neducation in Germany, the other-ethnicity participants had\nalready been heavily exposed to the influence of Western media\nand culture. Future research would benefit from examining dif-\nferent ethnic groups in their own immediate cultural context.\nIn Study 1, the biases were less pronounced for the AS\nsample compared to the LA and the ME sample, pointing to\npotential cultural differences in the strength of attractiveness-\nbased biases. One factor to be examined in future studies\nregards the role attractiveness plays in mating choices within\ntraditional societies; in traditional societies, mate choice is lim-\nited by family expectations and kinship rules (Yu & Shepard,\n1998), so the extent of individual choice that is allowed in\npersonal relationships may affect attractiveness-based biases\nTherefore, differences could be expected between Western cul-\ntures and more traditional cultures and societies. Besides,\nsocial influence exerted by one's environment and social net-\nwork (e.g., one's peer group) may affect perceptions of attrac-\ntiveness even in very different surroundings, economic states,\nand political climates (Lehmiller, Graziano, & VanderDrift,\nee, 2007). In addition, in organizational\ncontexts (which are often also influenced by culture), the\nanticipated level of competition or cooperation with a new\ncolleague (i.e., the perceived instrumentality to oneself) may\ninfluence whether a person's attractiveness and/or ethnicity\n(i.e., being of the same vs. another ethnic group) promotes\nnegative versus positive reactions (Lee, Pitesa, Pillutla, &\nMoreover, other contextual factors like the target person's\nstatus and achievements (Agthe & Spo\nindividual differences like people's social comparison orienta-\ntion (Agthe, Spo\n\u00a8rrle, Frey, & Maner, 2014), their own level of\nattractiveness (Agthe et al., 2010), their sexual preference (Fo\n\u00a8r-\nsterling et al., 2007), sociosexual orientation (Simpson &\nGangestad, 1992), or partnership status and commitment\n(Lydon, Fitzsimons, & Naidoo, 2003) may influence whether\npositive or negative attractiveness-based biases are likely to\nemerge toward an other-sex versus same-sex target person.\nConsidering that our hypotheses referred to heterosexual parti-\ncipants, failing to measure sexual preference may have added\nnoise to our current data, so it is important for future research to\nattend more carefully to people's partner preference (i.e.,\nwhether they feel attracted to other-sex versus same-sex per-\nsons). It might also be helpful to use more precise ethnic cate-\ngories. For instance, people from AS are likely to differentiate\nsomewhat better than European Caucasians whether a stimulus\nperson from AS is Chinese, Japanese, or from another ASn\ncountry, and this may affect reactions to the target. Besides,\nthere might be substantial variability in reaction pattern across\npopulations (Heinrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010).\nMoreover, the tendency to stereotype on the basis of appear-\nance when drawing characterological inferences may be\nweaker for people from collectivistic or interdependent cul-\ntures (e.g., East AS) because individuals might rely more on\ngroup-level attributes when evaluating others (Dion, Pak, &\npotential cultural influences on the nature of attractiveness-\nbased biases could be profitably addressed in future research.\nAlthough our results fall short of identifying the specific\nmechanisms underlying attractiveness biases within and\nbetween ethnicities, previous studies provide important clues.\nFor instance, prior research has documented that the likelihood\nto have contact with the target person (Luxen & van de Vijver,\nLemay et al., 2010) partly explain positive versus negative\nreactions toward attractive other-sex versus same-sex persons.\nFuture studies investigating the potential underlying processes\nfor attractiveness-based biases within and between ethnicities\nwould move us toward a better understanding of the observed\npatterns. For instance, investigations might test more directly\nwhether particular target persons who vary in attractiveness\nelicit perceptions of threat associated with either romantic riv-\nalry or social comparison. Testing potential mechanisms\nshould also control for participants' sexual preference, as the\nattention to the likely partner preferences might also explain\nwhy gay or lesbian participants might not show the same reac-\ntion patterns (Fo\nConclusion\nThe current studies are the first to show that positive (negative)\nbiases toward attractive opposite-sex (same-sex) persons of the\nsame ethnicity generalize across diverse ethnic backgrounds\n(within-group effects; Study 1) but emerge almost exclusively\ntoward targets of the evaluator's own ethnic background\n(between-group effects; Study 2). At a broader conceptual\nlevel, this research provides support for the notion that the\nmotives underlying biases in social evaluation--including\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\nadaptive motives associated with mating and social compari-\nson--seem to be manifested in relatively universal ways across\nhuman cultures. At the same time, findings provide evidence\nfor important boundary conditions in how--and toward\nwhom--those motives are expressed. Overall, our studies high-\nlight the value of attending both to fundamental social motives\nshaped by natural selection as well as to possible cultural influ-\nences when exploring biases in social perception.\n"
