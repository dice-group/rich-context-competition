    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Pay-for-performance, public reporting, and accountable care\norganization programs place pressures on physicians to use health\ninformation technology and organized care management processes to\nimprove the care they provide. But physician practices that are not large\nmay lack the resources and size to implement such processes. We used\ndata from a unique national survey of 1,164 practices with fewer than\ntwenty physicians to provide the first information available on the extent\nto which independent practice associations (IPAs) and physician-hospital\norganizations (PHOs) might make it possible for these smaller practices\nto share resources to improve care. Nearly a quarter of the practices\nparticipated in an IPA or a PHO that accounted for a significant\nproportion of their patients. On average, practices participating in these\norganizations provided nearly three times as many care management\nprocesses for patients with chronic conditions as nonparticipating\npractices did (10.4 versus 3.8). Half of these processes were provided only\nby IPAs or PHOs. These organizations may provide a way for small and\nmedium-size practices to systematically improve care and participate in\naccountable care organizations.\nMany US physicians work in\nthird were in solo or two-\nphysician practices, and an-\nother 15 percent worked in\npractices with three to five physicians.1 Many\nother physicians worked in medium-size practic-\nes--those with fewer than twenty physicians.2\nAt their best, small and medium-size practices\ncan provide personalized care to patients in an\nenvironment in which patients, staff, and physi-\ncians know each other well. However, for de-\ncades physicians have been gradually migrating\nto larger practices.3,4 This movement appears to\nbe accelerating,5 especially in the case of physi-\ncians who become employees of hospitals. But\nthe persistence of large numbers of indepen-\ndent, physician-owned small and medium-size\npractices suggests that many physicians and\npatients prefer this setting, that it is difficult\nto create large practices, or both.6\nHowever, small and medium-size practices are\nfacing increasing pressure to improve the quality\nand value of the care they provide. This pressure\nincludes incentives to adopt and make effective\nuse of electronic health records and to perform\nwell in the rapidly expanding public reporting\nand value-based purchasing programs imple-\nmented by Medicare and health insurers. In ad-\ndition, programs that encourage the formation\nof accountable care organizations--organiza-\ntions of providers that agree to take responsibil-\nity for the cost and quality of care received by\ntheir population of patients--are beginning to\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nLawrence P.

Smaller practic-\nes are unlikely to have enough of these patients\nto keep a nurse care manager busy.\nLarge medical groups have the resources to\ncreate care management processes to improve\nthe care of their populations of patients. How-\never, not many communities have such groups.\nHospitals also have enough resources and are\nincreasingly employing physicians, but some\nphysicians resist working for a hospital.5 It is\nnot yet known whether most hospitals can suc-\nceed at creating and operating medical groups.\nAn alternative for physicians who wish to re-\nmain in a small or medium-size independent\npractice might be to share care management\nand information technology resources9 with\nother practices through an independent practice\nassociation (IPA) or physician-hospital organi-\nzation (PHO).10,11 An IPA is a network of physi-\ncians who agree to participate in an association\nto contract with health insurance plans. Physi-\ncians maintain ownership of their practices and\nadminister their own offices; the IPA serves as an\norganizational structure for negotiating health\nplan contracts and for creating processes to im-\nprove quality and control health care costs.12\nPHOs allow physicians in independent practices\nto join with one or more hospitals to create a\nnetwork intended to serve the same functions\n300 physicians, but such organizations may be\nmuch smaller or larger.8\nThe Affordable Care Act specifies that IPAs and\nPHOs can qualify as accountable care organiza-\ntions. Health insurers are also including IPAs\nand PHOs in their accountable care organization\ncontracts; an example is Blue Cross Blue Shield\nof Massachusetts, with its Alternative Quality\nContract.15 IPAs and PHOs that negotiate con-\ntracts with health insurers on behalf of their\nphysician members are subject to antitrust regu-\nlation.16 It is a violation of the antitrust laws for\nindependent practices to join together to nego-\ntiate contracts with health insurers. However,\nthe Federal Trade Commission and the Depart-\nment of Justice--the federal agencies that can\nbring lawsuits to enforce antitrust regulations--\npermit IPAs and PHOs to negotiate with insurers\nwhen the practices in the larger organizations\nare \"clinically integrated.\"17 The provision of care\nmanagement practices by the IPA or PHO is one\nof the key criteria for such clinical integration.16\nDespite their potential importance, very little\nis knownabout IPAs and PHOs. Thereareno data\navailable on thenumber of active IPAs and PHOs,\nand very few studies have focused on these types\nUsing data from a large, unique national sur-\nvey of small and medium-size physician practic-\nes, we present in this article the first available\ninformation on these types of provider groups.\nWe sought to answer the following questions:\nFirst, what proportion of independent small and\nmedium-size practices participate in an IPA or\nPHO? Second, among practices that do partici-\npate in such an organization, to what extent does\nthat organization provide care management\nprocesses for patients with one or more of the\nfour following chronic conditions: asthma, con-\ngestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes?\nThird, when an IPA or PHO provides care man-\nagement processes to a participating practice, to\nwhat extent do those processes duplicate ones\nthat the practice is already providing? Fourth,\nwhich types of practices receive the most help\nwith care management processes from IPAs or\nPHOs? Fifth, which types of care management\nprocesses do IPAs and PHOs provide most\nfrequently?\nStudy Data And Methods\nStudy Population The data come from the\nNational Study of Small and Medium-Sized\nMarch 2009 we conducted forty-minute tele-\nphone surveys with the physician leader or ad-\nministrator of a national sample of practices that\nhad one to nineteen physicians. The sample was\ndrawn from a population constructed using the\nIMS Health Healthcare Organizational Services\ndatabase. Practices were eligible to participate in\nthe survey if at least 60 percent of their physi-\ncians were adult primary care providers, cardiol-\nogists, endocrinologists, or pulmonologists.\nThese specialties were selected because their\npractitioners routinely provide care for patients\nwith one or more of the four chronic conditions\nlisted above. The number of responding practic-\nes was 1,745. The adjusted response rate was\n63.2 percent, using method 3 of the American\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Of\nwere owned by a hospital, health system, or\nhealth maintenance organization. We excluded\nthese from our analyses because they were not\nindependent practices and could use their own-\ner's resources to provide care management proc-\nesses. Our analyses were performed on the re-\nSurvey Instrument The survey instrument\nincluded questions on practice size, specialty\nmix, ownership, patient mix, internal payment\nmethods, involvement in pay-for-performance\nor public reporting programs, and acceptance\nof financial risk for the cost of patients' care. It\nalso included questions on the practice's use of\nclinical information technology and care man-\nagement processes, such as disease registries\nand patient reminders for people who had one\nor more of the four chronic conditions on which\nthe survey focused.\nThe survey also asked respondents whether\ntheir practice received \"a significant proportion\nof patients through an IPA or an integrated de-\nlivery system or a...PHO.\" Practices that re-\nsponded \"yes\" were considered to be participat-\ning in an IPA or PHO. Practices that are part of an\nintegrated delivery system are owned by the sys-\ntem and thus were not included in our analyses.\nUse Of Care Management Processes For\neach of the four chronic conditions, the survey\nasked about the practice's use of the following\nfive care management processes: registries to\ntrack patients with these conditions, nurse care\nmanagers to provide ongoing care for patients\nbetween office visits, guideline-based reminders\nprovided at the point of care for physicians about\nservices their patients should receive, patient\nreminders sent by the practice to patients with\nchronic diseases about needed preventive or\nfollow-up care, and reporting of quality data to\nthe practice's physicians. For each process for\neach condition, the survey asked whether the\npractice provided the process and whether an\nIPA or PHO provided the process.\nWe constructed six indices of the care manage-\nment processes provided by the practice, the IPA\nor PHO, or both the practice and the IPA or PHO.\nThe maximum score on any index was 20 (five\ncare management processes multiplied by four\nchronic conditions). The practice care manage-\nment process index assigned one point to a prac-\ntice for each care management process that the\npractice provided, regardless of whether an IPA\nor PHO also provided it. The IPA/PHO index\nassigned one point to the practice for each care\nmanagement process provided by an IPA or\nPHO, regardless of whether the practice also\nprovided it. The practice-only index assigned\none point to a practice for each process that\nthe practice provided and an IPA or PHO did\nnot provide, while the IPA/PHO-only index as-\nsigned one point to a practice for each process\nthat an IPA or PHO provided and the practice did\nnot. The practice and IPA/PHO duplicate care\nmanagement process index assigned one point\nto a practice for each care management process\nthat both the practice and an IPA or PHO pro-\nvided. Finally, the total care management proc-\ness index assigned one point to a practice for\neach care management process that was pro-\nvided by either the practice, an IPA or PHO, or\nboth the practice and the larger organization.\nPractice Characteristics Our analyses in-\ncluded variables for practice size, ownership,\ninvolvement in pay-for-performance or public\nreporting programs, acceptance of financial risk\nfor the cost of patient care, the percentage of the\npractice's revenue that came from Medicaid pa-\ntients and uninsured low-income patients, and\nthe percentage of the practice's patients with\nlimited English proficiency.\nStatistical Analyses We conducted t tests to\ncompare the characteristics of independent\nphysician practices that did and did not partici-\npate in IPAs or PHOs. We also compared the\nparticipating and nonparticipating practices'\nscores on each of the six care management proc-\ness indices.\nWe analyzed the relationship between the total\ncare management process index and participa-\ntion in an IPA or PHO, holding practice charac-\nteristics constant and using negative binomial\nregression, a modeling approach useful for deal-\ning with count data. Below we report the mar-\nginal effects from this analysis--that is, the addi-\ntional number of care management processes\nprovided to patients of practices that received\na significant proportion of patients from an IPA\nor PHO.\nWe then examined the relationship between\npractice characteristics and the IPA/PHO-only\ncare management process index, again using\nnegative binomial regression. This analysis was\ndesigned to produce an estimate of the extent to\nwhich various types of practices benefited from\nparticipating in an IPA or PHO.\nAll analyses were weighted to account for the\nprobability of selection for the reporting practic-\nes, adjusted for nonresponse, and controlled for\npopulation distributions.

First, although we used a large and ran-\ndomly selected sample of small and medium-size\nUS practices, we cannot claim that ours was a\nprecisely representative sample. There is no\n\"gold standard\" data set that contains the pop-\nulation of US physician practices. Second, our\ndata were reported by a knowledgeable leader of\neach practice; we did not conduct an indepen-\ndent audit of the care management processes\nprovided by any practice, IPA, or PHO.\nThird, we based our analyses on whether the\npractice leader reported that the practice re-\nceived a \"significant proportion\" of its patients\nfrom an IPA or PHO, or an integrated delivery\nsystem. Leaders may have differed on how they\ndefined significant proportion. Nevertheless, re-\nsponses to this question should reflect the lead-\ner's opinion of whether or not the practice was\nparticipating in an IPA or PHO in a meaning-\nful way.\nFourth, our data were collected before the start\nof the Medicare accountable care organization\nprogram. It is possible that IPAs and PHOs in-\nvolved in this program now provide more care\nmanagement processes.\nFinally, the care management processes in-\ncluded in our study are generally considered to\nbe important in improving the quality of patient\ncare.20\u00ad22 However, our study does not provide\ndata on whether these processes are associated\nwith improved outcomes of care. Few data are\navailable on the quality of care provided by IPAs\nand PHOs, although one study and one review of\nthe limited literature suggest that large medical\ngroups may provide better care than IPAs on a\nlimited set of quality process measures.23\u00ad25\nStudy Results\nNearly a quarter (23.8 percent) of practices\nreported participating significantly in an IPA\nor PHO (Exhibit 1). Practices that did participate\nwere significantly more likely than nonpartici-\npating practices to have external incentives to\nimprove quality in the form of public reporting\nperformance programs (59.7 percent versus\n31.2 percent). Participating and nonparticipat-\ning practices did not differ significantly in terms\nof size, percentage of patients with limited\nEnglish proficiency, or percentage of revenue\nreceived from Medicaid and uninsured patients.\nPractices that participated in an IPA or PHO\nprovided significantly more care management\nprocesses than did nonparticipating practices\n(not counting the processes provided by the\nIPA or PHO), although as shown in Exhibit 1\nPractice Characteristics And Use Of Care Management Processes\nPractices that participate\nsignificantly in an IPA or PHO\nPractices that do not participate\nsignificantly in an IPA or PHO\nMeasure\nNumber or\npercent SE\nNumber or\npercent SE\nRevenue from Medicaid and uninsured\nCare management process index\nSOURCE Authors' analyses of data from the National Study of Small and Medium-Sized Physician Practices (Note 18 in text).

On average, IPAs or PHOs provided 7.9 care\nmanagement processes to participating practic-\nes, and 5.4 of them were performed by the IPA\nor PHO only (the remaining 2.5 were performed\nby both the practice and the IPA or PHO).\nPractices varied considerably in the number of\ncare management processes that they received\nfrom IPAs or PHOs. Out of twenty possible proc-\nesses, 16.6 percent of practices received no proc-\nesses at all from an IPA or PHO, 25.6 percent\nreceived two or fewer, and 32.5 percent received\nten or more processes (data not shown).\nWhen the care management processes pro-\nvided by IPAs and PHOs were included, partici-\npating practices provided 10.4 processes to their\npatients, while nonparticipating practices pro-\nvided 3.8 (Exhibit 1). This difference was some-\nwhat diminished in a multivariate analysis:\nWhen other variables were held constant, par-\nticipating practices provided 4.8 more care man-\nagement processes, including processes pro-\nvided by an IPA or PHO, than nonparticipating\npractices did (Exhibit 2).We were unable to iden-\ntify any practice characteristics that were signifi-\ncantly associated with the practice's receiving\nmore care management processes performed by\nan IPA or PHO (see online Appendix Exhibit 1).26\nExhibit 3 provides detailed data on practices'\nprovision of care management processes by type\nof process and by disease. In general, care man-\nagement processes were most likely to be pro-\nvided for patients with diabetes and least likely to\nbe provided for those with depression. IPAs and\nPHOs provided more processes than practices\ndid for almost every type of process and for each\nof the four chronic conditions. Practices rarely\nprovided care management processes that re-\nquired extensive resources and economies of\nscale (notably, the use of nurse care managers\nand the provision of quality data to physicians),\nwhereas these care management processes were\namong those most frequently provided by IPAs\nand PHOs.\nMarginal Effects Of Participation In An Independent Practice Association (IPA) Or Physician-Hospital Organization (PHO)\nOn Total Use Of Care Management Processes\nVariable Marginal effect SE p value\nPractice size\nSOURCE Authors' analyses of data from the National Study of Small and Medium-Sized Physician Practices (Note 18 in text).

For these\npractices, IPAs and PHOs provided enough care\nmanagement processes, on average, to double\nthe number of processes offered to the practices'\npatients. To our knowledge, this is the first study\nto report this information, which is consistent\nwith the hypothesis that IPAs and PHOs can pro-\nvide care management processes to practices\nthat lack the resources and scale to implement\nthese processes themselves.\nThe care management processes that IPAs and\nPHOs provided were, as expected, those that\nrequired large numbers of patients (the use of\nnurse care managers) or needed expensive in-\nformation technology capabilities to be efficient\n(providing internal performance data to physi-\ncians).\nOur findings provide some encouragement to\nthose who hope that IPAs and PHOs can create\nthe best of both worlds, making it possible for\nphysicians to share resources while remaining in\ntheir own independent practices. But much re-\nmains to be learned. The literature comparing\nthe performance of large medical groups to that\nof IPAs is sparse, and to our knowledge there is\nno research comparing the performance of hos-\npital-employed physicians to those in physician-\nowned practices of any size.\nConclusion\nOur findings may be of interest to physicians in\nindependent practices, leaders of IPAs and\nPHOs, Medicare and health plan executives,\nand antitrust regulators. Physicians in indepen-\ndent small and medium-size practices who want\nto participate in an accountable care organiza-\ntion, for example, may have the option--depend-\ning on what is available in their community--of\nbecomingemployed by a hospital or a largemedi-\ncal group. The data presented in this article sug-\ngest that IPAs and PHOs may be able to provide\nan additional, potentially viable organizational\nalternative during an era of major changes in\nhow health care is delivered and paid for.\nOur findings suggest that it is a reasonable\ndecision for leaders of the Centers for Medi-\ncare and Medicaid Services and commercial\nhealth insurers to sign accountable care organi-\nzation contracts with IPAs or PHOs, and reason-\nable for physicians and hospital leaders to try to\ncreate high-functioning IPAs and PHOs.\nIt also appears reasonable for the Federal\nTrade Commission to permit independent physi-\ncians in some IPAs and PHOs to negotiate jointly\nwith health insurers, without being deemed in\nviolation of antitrust law, because some IPAs and\nPHOs do provide a large number of care man-\nagement processes. At the same time, the Federal\nTrade Commission should continue to scrutinize\nnegotiations between health insurers and physi-\ncians in IPAs or PHOs carefully, since our data\nsuggest that 42 percent of practices that partici-\npate in these larger organizations receive no\nor very few care management processes from\nthem. \nAn early version of the analyses in this\narticle was presented at the\nAcademyHealth Annual Research\nMeeting in Orlando, Florida, June 26,\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nLawrence Casalino serves as an unpaid\nmember of the boards of directors of\nthe American Medical Group Foundation\nand of the Health Research and\nEducational Trust.
