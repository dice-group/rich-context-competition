Using survival analysis, the authors analyzed longitudinal data from the NHANES I\nEpidemiologic Follow-up Study (1982\u00ad1992). The findings showed that the presence of severe depressive\nsymptoms significantly elevated mortality risk among US adults with diabetes; the same pattern was not observed\namong people without diabetes. After results were controlled for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-status\nvariables, diabetic persons with Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale scores of 16 or\nmore had 54% greater mortality than those with scores under 16 (p 5 0.004). After exclusion of participants who\ndied during the first year of follow-up, mortality remained higher among those with CES-D scores greater than or\nequal to 22 as compared with those with CES-D scores less than 16, but not among those with CES-D scores\nbetween 16 and 21. No significant relation between depression and mortality was found in the nondiabetic\npopulation. This analysis indicates that diabetes modifies the effect of depression on mortality.

Diabetes is a leading cause\nof death in the United States. During 2000, the disease\naccounted directly for 69,301 deaths and contributed to\nDiabetes is also a major cause of loss of quality-adjusted life\nyears, largely because of vascular complications (3).\nDiabetes is associated with depression and depressive\nsymptoms, but the strength and causal direction of these\nassociations are unclear (4\u00ad10). In two recent studies that\nused data from the First National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I) but utilized different\ninstruments to measure depressive symptoms, investigators\ncame to different conclusions about the role of depression as\nusing the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression\n(CES-D) Scale, found no evidence to support an etiologic\nrelation between depression and diabetes.

Depression\nhas also been found to affect glycemic control and both\nmacrovascular and microvascular complications (13\u00ad20),\nbut it is unclear whether there is a reverse causal relation\n(i.e., whether diabetes causes depression) (7, 21, 22). In\na review, Talbot and Nouwen (21) stated that there is no\nsolid evidence that the initial occurrence of clinically\nsignificant depression results either from biochemical\nchanges directly attributable to type 2 diabetes or its\ntreatment or from the psychosocial demands imposed by\nthe illness or its treatment.\nA similar ambiguity exists with regard to the relation\nbetween depression and mortality. As many studies report\nthat depression is associated with increased mortality in\ngeneral populations, especially among older adults (21, 23\u00ad\nreview of the relation between depression and mortality,\nWulsin et al. (34) identified 57 studies carried out between\n13 negative results, and 15 mixed results. Further examina-\ntion (35\u00ad42) revealed that a relation may exist between\ndepression and excess mortality only when subjects have\ncertain illnesses--such as coronary artery disease (42),\ntive heart failure (39), or ischemic heart disease (37)--or\nwhen subjects have a disadvantaged social position with low\nincome or less education or are socially isolated (43\u00ad45).\nHowever, we have not identified any study that directly\ncompares the depression-associated mortality rates of pop-\nulations with and without medical conditions at baseline.\nIn this study, we examined the association between\ndepression and diabetes by studying the relation between\ndepressive symptoms and mortality among people with\ndiabetes. We used a nondiabetic population as a comparator\nto determine whether depressive symptoms played the same\nrole in mortality among persons with and without diabetes\nwhile controlling for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and\nhealth-status variables.\nThis study used data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic\nFollow-up Study (NHEFS). The NHEFS is a follow-up\nstudy of adults who participated in NHANES I, which was\nfollow-up surveys; the first one was conducted between\n1992. The NHEFS study population was drawn from\na probability sample of noninstitutionalized civilian US\nvital status of 93 percent of the original NHANES I sample\nThis study included the subgroup of NHEFS adult\nparticipants who had baseline diabetes status and depressive\n9,990). The vital status of these participants was ascertained\nexamination conducted at baseline did not provide adequate\ninformation by which diabetes could be identified (i.e.,\nplasma glucose level, fasting plasma glucose level, or results\nof oral glucose tolerance testing), diabetes was assessed by\nself-report, with information derived from two survey\nquestions: ``Did a doctor ever tell you that you had diabetes\nor sugar diabetes?'' and ``Are you now taking medicine for\nthis condition (diabetes)?'' In total, 714 (7.1 percent)\npersons with diabetes and 9,276 persons without diabetes\nwere identified. Using information from each follow-up\nsurvey question on the subject's vital status, we identified\ndeceased cases in the nondiabetic population. This vital\nstatus information was based on death certificates (98.7\npercent of death cases) and proxies' reports (1.3 percent of\ndeath cases). Because of missing or incomplete information\non date of loss to follow-up and CES-D scores, 156\nparticipants with diabetes and 2,213 participants without\ndiabetes were excluded from our analysis. Thus, the\ndeaths, 282 survivors), and the analyzed nondiabetic pop-\nSurvival time, or the amount of time that elapsed from the\ncensoring, was the outcome variable in our survival\nanalysis. Survival time (in weeks) was defined in terms of\nthe following variables: 1) date of interview in the 1982\u00ad\n1984 follow-up survey, 2) date of later follow-up interview,\nand 3) date of loss to follow-up or date on which the subject\nwas last known to be alive as reported by a proxy (date of\ncensoring). Survival time was calculated as the date of death\nor censoring minus the date of interview in the 1982 survey.\nIndependent variables evaluated included depressive\nsymptom score, demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and\nhealth status. The first group of variables constituted the\nexplanatory variables of primary interest, and the other\ngroups of variables were potential confounders.\nWe assessed depressive symptoms using the CES-D\nquestionnaire, which consists of 20 descriptive statements\nof depressed mood; feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness,\nand loneliness; loss of appetite; sleep disturbances; concen-\ntration problems; and psychomotor retardation. Although in\nprevious studies a score of 16 was defined as clinical\ndepression (46) and a score of <16 was defined as ``not\ndepressed'' (47), we treated the cutoff score not as diagnosed\ndepression but as an indicator of risk for clinically significant\nimpairment. We also categorized persons as having either\npressive symptoms. The CES-D questionnaire is reliable and\nvalid (48), with high sensitivity and adequate specificity as\na screening instrument for depression (49). Scoring for the\nfour positively worded items was reversed in this study.\nConsequently, the 20 items, which were scored on a standard\nfour-point scale from 0 to 3, had a potential range of 0\u00ad60,\nwith the higher scores representing responses in the de-\npressed range. Only persons who answered all 20 items\non the questionnaire were included in our primary analysis\nWe controlled for age, gender, race, marital status,\nresidential area (rural vs. urban), education, work status,\nand income, since there are known correlations between\nDepression and Mortality in Persons with and without Diabetes 653\nmortality and these sociodemographic variables (52\u00ad55).\nWe also included five lifestyle variables as control factors,\nsince they are known to be associated with mortality (56,\n57): ever having smoked at least 100 cigarettes, current\nsmoking, alcohol consumption (number of drinks per day),\ncurrently being on a diet for weight loss, and physical\nactivity level (on a three-point scale: quite inactive (1 point),\nmoderately active (2 points), or very active (3 points)).\nBecause health status has been found to be a good predictor\nof mortality (58, 59), we also adjusted for eight health-status\nvariables: self-rated health; body mass index (weight (kg)/\nheight (m)2); a history of cancer, hypertension, heart attack,\nor stroke; blindness; and current use of antidepressants.\nThe analyses were conducted in three steps. First, using\nsurvival analysis, we examined the individual effects of\nexplanatory and control variables on mortality. Variables\nthat were significantly related to mortality in either diabetic\nor nondiabetic subgroups were used in our final model.\nSecond, using survival analysis and the Cox proportional\nhazards model, we examined the association between\ndepressive symptoms--as measured by the CES-D\nScale--and mortality while controlling for physical health-\nstatus variables. We categorized CES-D results in two\ndifferent ways. First, participants were stratified by CES-D\nscore: <16 vs. 16. Second, participants were stratified into\nthree groups based on their CES-D scores: <16 (group 1),\nexamine the possibility that the relation between depressive\nsymptoms and mortality was explained by concurrent\nterminal illness, severe disease, or severe depression, we\nconducted a sensitivity analysis to examine differences\namong subjects after excluding participants who died within\nthe first year of follow-up. We also compared mortality\namong participants who answered all 20 items on the\nquestionnaire with mortality among participants who an-\nswered at least 17 items. We performed these analyses using\nthe SPSS statistical software package (version 9.0 for\nRESULTS\nBaseline descriptive data for the outcome variable and\nits covariates are presented in table 1, along with the dif-\nferences found between the diabetic and nondiabetic\npopulation groups. Within the diabetic and nondiabetic\npopulations, we observed no significant differences in\nsociodemographic characteristics, CES-D scores, lifestyle\nvariables, or physical health-status variables between the\ntotal original sample and the subgroup of respondents who\nhad both adequate CES-D scores and acceptable dates of\ndeath or loss to follow-up (statistics for the total original\npresumed survivors in the diabetic subgroup (49.5 percent\nin the nondiabetic subgroup (21.2 percent cumulative\nsurvival time was 7 years in the diabetic population and\n8.5 years in the nondiabetic population. The prevalence of\nCES-D scores greater than or equal to 16 in the diabetic\nthe prevalence in the nondiabetic cohort was 15.8 percent\nIn the cohort of 7,621 adults who were included in our\nprimary analysis, nondiabetic participants, as compared\nwith diabetic participants, were younger (mean age 5\nhad higher incomes (mean score on a six-point income scale\n(see table footnotes): 4.0 vs. 3.1). The nondiabetic cohort\nwas also healthier than the diabetic cohort on the basis of\nself-reported better health (mean score on a five-point Likert\nscale: 2.5 vs. 3.6) and lower body weight (body mass index:\n25.3 vs. 29.8); were less likely to have a history of cancer\nstroke (1.0 percent vs. 5.0 percent); were less likely to have\nblindness (1.4 percent vs. 3.6 percent); and were less likely\nto currently use antidepressants (2.3 percent vs. 3.6 percent).\nIn addition, the nondiabetic cohort, as compared with the\ndiabetic cohort, was more likely to have smoked at least 100\ncigarettes (54.4 percent vs. 49.5 percent), to smoke currently\nalcohol (mean number of drinks per day: 1.4 vs. 0.8) and\nwas less likely to be dieting for weight loss (4.6 percent vs.\n24.7 percent). Finally, the nondiabetic cohort, in comparison\nwith the diabetic cohort, was more physically active (mean\nphysical activity scale score: 2.1 vs. 1.8).\nFigures 1 and 2 show the unadjusted survival functions\nstratified by CES-D scores. These functions demonstrate\nthe expected positive relation between depression and\nmortality--that is, the group with lower CES-D scores had\nlonger survival. The two survival functions in each figure are\nparallel, suggesting that depression satisfies the proportional\nhazards assumption. However, although the survival func-\ntions were significantly separated from each other in the\ndiabetic cohort, they were not so in the nondiabetic cohort.\nBefore constructing our final model of survival analysis,\nwe identified the following independent variables that were\nnot significantly related to mortality (a 5 0.05) when\nentered individually into the model: rural residence, current\nsmoking, alcohol consumption per day, and current use of\nantidepressants. Using an identical model, we examined\ndepression-associated mortality among people with and\nwithout diabetes after excluding the insignificant variables\nidentified above (table 2). When results were controlled for\nsociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-status variables,\ndepression played a significant role in mortality risk among\npeople with diabetes. Compared with respondents with\nCES-D scores less than 16, respondents with scores of 16\nor higher had death hazards that were increased by 54\npercent (p 5 0.004). Although depression slightly increased\nhazard ratios among people without diabetes, the relation\nwas not statistically significant (p 5 0.67). Increased levels\nof physical activity and health status significantly reduced\nmortality rates in both population groups. Income signifi-\ncantly decreased mortality risk among people without\ndiabetes but not among people with diabetes.\nTABLE 1.

Using CES-D scores less\nthan 16 for comparison, we categorized people with CES-D\nscores of 16\u00ad21 as having moderate depressive symptoms\nand those with scores of 22 as having severe depressive\nsymptoms. Again, depressive symptoms were associated\nwith increased mortality risk among people with diabetes.\nOther things being equal, respondents with moderate de-\npressive symptoms had a hazard ratio that was increased\ndepressive symptoms had a ratio increased by 49 percent\n(p 5 0.029). No such relation was found in any subgroup\nrespectively).\nWe examined the relation again after excluding respon-\ndents who died during the first year of follow-up. Moderate\ndepressive symptoms no longer significantly increased the\nrisk of mortality among persons with diabetes, whereas\nmortality risk remained increased in respondents with\nmodel, no significant relation between depression and\nmortality was found among people without diabetes.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses using an enlarged group\nof respondents (n 5 8,007), including those who answered\n17\u00ad19 items on the CES-D questionnaire. We found no\nsignificant difference in depression-associated mortality\nbetween respondents who answered all 20 items and respon-\ndents who answered at least 17 items in either the diabetic\npopulation or the nondiabetic population. We also tested for\nbias introduced by missing data by including the subsample of\nrespondents whodidnotprovideanswersforcertainquestions\n(the mostcommonly missing data were those related to family\nincome, where 7.2 percent of the datawere missing). After the\nmean value for family income was assigned to these cases, no\nsignificant difference in depression-associated mortality was\nfound between the subgroup with complete data and the\nsubgroup with missing data.\nDISCUSSION\nUsing prospective data from the NHEFS, we examined\nthe relation between depressive symptoms and mortality\namong persons with and without diabetes at baseline. Our\nfindings addressed the following three questions: 1) Do\npatients with diabetes have higher levels of depressive\nsymptoms compared with a healthy population? 2) Do\ndepressive symptoms significantly increase mortality risk in\ngeneral populations as they did in a population with\ndiabetes? 3) How does diabetes modify the depression-\nmortality association? Our findings not only confirm that\npeople with diabetes are prone to be depressed but also\ndemonstrate that depressive symptoms play a more impor-\ntant role in mortality among people with diabetes than\namong people without diabetes. Compared with respondents\nwith CES-D scores less than 16, respondents with scores of\n16 or more had death hazards that were increased by 54\npercent. However, no such relation was found among people\nwithout diabetes. We found the same patterns after strati-\nfying depressive symptoms and excluding respondents who\nhad died within the first year of follow-up.\nOur findings also demonstrate that diabetes is more\nlikely to be related not only to worse mental and physical\nhealth but also to a disadvantaged social position. Compared\nwith nondiabetic people, people with diabetes are more\nlikely to suffer from depression; to rate their health as\nworse; to report more cases of cancer, hypertension, heart\nattack, stroke, and blindness; to be physically inactive; to be\nFIGURE 1.

Although many studies\nclaim that depression elevates humans' susceptibility to\ndiabetes (4\u00ad10) and that depression further deteriorates\ndiabetic patients' health status by affecting their glycemic\ncontrol and their macrovascular and microvascular compli-\ncations (13\u00ad20), much contradictory evidence also exists (7,\nbetween depressive symptoms and excess mortality among\npersons with diabetes, this study indicates that an associa-\ntion does exist between depression and diabetes.\nUsing a nondiabetic subgroup as a comparator, this study\ndesign may exclude other potential confounders. After we\ncontrolled for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle,\nand health status, our results showed that depression\nsignificantly elevates mortality only among persons with\ndiabetes. This finding implies that diabetes modifies the\ndepression-mortality association.\nThis study also clarifies the relation between depressive\nsymptoms and mortality among general populations. Pre-\nvious studies carried out in restricted populations have\nindicated that a relation exists between depression and\nexcess mortality only when subjects have certain cardio-\nvascular illnesses--such as coronary artery disease (42),\ntive heart failure (39), or ischemic heart disease (37)--or\nwhen subjects have a disadvantaged social position, such as\na low income, less education, or social isolation (43\u00ad45).\nHowever, we have not identified any study that uses a\ncomparison group to examine the relation between de-\npression and mortality. We found that diabetes, similarly to\nother chronic diseases, significantly affects the depression-\nmortality association. This relation was not observed in the\nnondiabetic comparison population. Our findings demon-\nstrate the importance of examining subgroups, rather than\naggregated populations, when examining the effect of\ndepression on mortality.\nOur study had several strengths. First, the data we used\ncame from a nationwide longitudinal survey with 10 years\nof follow-up. Second, the most important confounding\nvariables, such as sociodemographic, health-status, and\nlifestyle variables, were controlled for when we examined\nthe relation between depression and mortality. Third, an\nidentical model was used to analyze two different popula-\ntions, and the comparison confirmed a relation between\ndepressive symptoms and diabetes. Fourth, sensitivity\nanalyses provided a degree of methodological validity.\nOur study also had various limitations. First, depressive\nsymptoms were measured only at baseline, and the CES-D\nscale was used as a time-independent variable in our model.\nAs a result, any change in depressive symptoms was not\nreflected in our survival analysis. Second, baseline charac-\nteristics in the diabetic and nondiabetic populations differed,\nwhich decreased the explanatory power of the comparison\nmodel. Third, information on specific causes of death was\nnot available, and this affected the generalizability of our\nfindings. Fourth, the diabetic population was identified by\nself-report--an approach that may have introduced mis-\nclassification. However, this methodological approach has\nbeen found to cause only minor bias, with high agreement\nbetween personal interviews and medical records in diabetic\nWe recognize that our study does not provide a causal\nexplanation for the relation between depression and excess\nmortality. Because the major explanatory variable, CES-D\nscore, was used as a time-independent variable, our model\nmore likely demonstrates a valid association. Further in-\nvestigation should focus on the mechanism of how de-\npression affects mortality among persons with diabetes.\nTwo paradigms are available for further investigation of\nsuch mechanisms (5, 63\u00ad67); one paradigm relates to\nphysiology and psychology, and the other relates to health\nbehavior. Depression and diabetes may be linked by neuro-\nhormonal changes mediated through the hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal axis. Depression has been found to in-\ncrease levels of counterregulatory hormones, particularly\nthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic\nnervous system, the counterregulatory hormones related to\ndepression increase human susceptibility to obesity, insulin\nresistance, and type 2 diabetes (5, 63). In addition, de-\npression activates the central sympathetic nervous system\nand leads to increased catecholamine levels and subsequent\ninsulin resistance (5, 63). These physiologic processes may\ncontribute to morbidity and mortality risk.\nDepressive symptoms may be related to health behaviors\nassociated with diabetes (68). Depressed persons may be\nmore likely to adopt unhealthy behaviors, such as a seden-\ntary lifestyle and a poor diet, which are associated with\na greater likelihood of obesity and type 2 diabetes (68, 69).\nDepressed persons may isolate themselves and be less likely\nto contact other people, decreasing the availability of social\nsupport, which could be crucial for glycemic control,\nOur study found an association between diabetes and\ndepressive symptoms at baseline. Thereafter, depressive\nsymptoms appeared to play a significant role in elevating\nmortality risk among persons with diabetes but not among\npersons without diabetes during a 10-year period. Our\nfindings also help clarify the contradictory findings on the\nassociation between depression and mortality among gen-\neral populations. Depression should probably be considered\na target for diabetes management interventions (72). In\naddition, however, more investigation is needed to clarify\nthe nature and etiology of the interaction between diabetes\nand depression.\n"
