These differences between the\ncurrent environment and that of the past could affect our psychological well-being (e.g., see\ndifferences include efficient means of transportation, machinery that can replace physical\nlabor, a constant progression of technologies to improve communications, and numerous\nother resources that afford a greater level of convenience and efficiency than found in the\npremodern world. However, these societal and technological advances have concurrently\ndeprived modern man of exposure to various factors that were present in the evolutionary\npast. Many of these factors may have served as natural facilitators of mental health.\nFor example, in the premodern environment early man would have likely had a\nsleep pattern more attuned to natural circadian rhythms not influenced by artificial light\n(e.g., Bower, 1999), foods with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., Eaton, Eaton,\nSinclair, Cordain, and Mann, 1998; Eaton and Konner, 1985), higher levels of physical\nactivity (e.g., Cordain, Gotshall, Eaton, and Eaton, 1998), less ruminative thought\nprocesses (e.g., Hollan, 1992; Schieffelin, 1985), more time exposed to sunlight (e.g.,\nEvolutionary lifestyle and mental health\nDeacon, 1999) and fewer periods of social isolation (e.g., Gat, 1999). Research, in fact, has\nestablished that all these factors are related to mental health (e.g., for sleep, see Cukrowicz\nfor physical activity, see Doyne et al, 1987; Dunn, Trivedi, Kampert, Clark, and Chambliss,\n2005; Freemont and Craighead, 1987; for rumination, see Beck, Rush, Shaw, and Emery,\nSuch evidence suggests that mental health could be impaired when levels in modern\nlife of these six elements--sleep, omega-3, exercise, rumination, sunlight, and\nsocialization--differ from that found in the evolutionary past. Recently, Ilardi and\ncolleagues (Ilardi, Karwoski, Lehman, Stites, and Steidtmann, 2007) have argued that a\nmodern lifestyle no longer provides adequate amounts of these factors and proposed a\nnovel treatment for individuals suffering from depression. The therapy prompts individuals\nto make lifestyle changes by adjusting the six factors in their lives, and preliminary\nevidence suggests the success of this approach (Ilardi et al., 2007; Karwoski, 2006).\nAlthough research has linked each of the six individual lifestyle elements with\nmental health, their relationship with mental health has not yet been evaluated\nsimultaneously for the same individuals. The aim of the present research was to assess\nclaims about these elements by examining whether their levels are related to mental health\nin the general population. Further, by including multiple elements, the research allowed an\nassessment of the possible combined effect of the elements. In the study, a large sample of\ncollege undergraduates were asked to report levels of the lifestyle elements as well as\nperceived psychological distress. We then evaluated whether there were linear or\ncurvilinear effects for each element and whether any of the findings varied by age or sex.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 495 college students recruited from undergraduate psychology\nand 70% were female.\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited from undergraduate psychology courses.\nAnnouncements informed students that at the beginning or end of their next scheduled\nclass, they would have the opportunity to participate in a self-report survey in exchange for\nextra course credit. For those who wished to participate, the survey was administered at the\nnext class meeting or an alternative time for students who could not attend the class\nadministration.\nEach participant first completed the Lifestyle Elements Scale, which asked them to\nindicate daily amounts of the six lifestyle elements experienced for the last week. They\nthen indicated their level of distress by completing the Beck Depression Inventory and the\nEvolutionary lifestyle and mental health\nHopkins Symptom Checklist.\nThe sample included only those who completed at least 20 of the 21 items on the\nBeck Depression Inventory, 55 of the 58 items on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and an\nentry for at least one day for each of the lifestyle elements. Missing scores were handled by\nestimating the missing value from the mean of the other items on the measure.\nWhen responding to the daily entries on the Lifestyle Elements Scale, a few\nparticipants entered a verbal designation instead of a number. Verbal responses for a small\namount such as \"a little\" were assigned a value one standard deviation below the mean for\nthat day, terms for a large amount such as \"a lot\" were given a value one standard deviation\nabove the mean, and a response of \"all day\" was scored as the maximum reported number\nfor the day.2\nMeasures\nBeck Depression Inventory. The Beck Depression Inventory II (Beck, Steer, and\nBrown, 1996) is a widely used self-report measure for depression that includes 21 items.\nEach item is scored from 0 to 3 to reflect the presence and severity of a depressive\nsymptom, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of depression.\nHopkins Symptom Checklist. The 58-item version of the Hopkins Symptom\nChecklist (Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Uhlenhuth, and Covi, 1974a, 1974b) is a self-report\nmeasure of symptoms commonly reported by individuals seeking psychological help. Each\nsymptom item is scored on a 4-point scale, indicating that the symptom bothered them not\nat all (1), a little (2), quite a bit (3), or extremely (4).\nLifestyle Elements Scale. The Lifestyle Elements Scale is a self-report questionnaire\ndeveloped for this research to assess the amount of sleep, omega-3, exercise, rumination,\nsunlight, and socialization that individuals have over the course of a week. Respondents\nfirst indicate their age and sex. Then, for each day of the week, they enter a numerical value\nin response to the following six questions: (a) \"How many hours did you sleep each\nnight?\"; (b) \"How many servings of the following did you consume: fresh fish, canned fish,\nan omega-3, or fish oil dietary supplement (pills)?\"; (c) \"How many minutes of physical\nexercise did you receive each day? (i.e. aerobics programs, weightlifting, jogging, lap\nswimming, sports such as basketball, soccer, racquetball, or similar exercise activities)\";\n(d) \"How many minutes during the day did you find yourself thinking or worrying over any\nparticular issue(s) in a nonproductive manner? (i.e. stressing, ruminating, obsessing, etc.)\";\n(e) \"How many minutes did you spend directly exposed to sunlight? Please only consider\ntimes you were directly outdoors (not in the car, not sitting in shade, etc.)\"; (f) \"How many\nminutes each day did you spend socializing outside of class? (i.e. attending parties,\nshopping with friends, going to movies with friends, attending study groups, etc.).\"\nEvolutionary lifestyle and mental health\nTable 1.

As can be seen, participants reported relatively low\ndaily averages of each element: approximately seven hours of sleep; less than half a serving\nof omega-3; one-half hour of exercise, rumination, and exposure to sunlight; and two hours\nsocializing.\nBecause the Beck Depression Inventory and symptom checklist were highly\ncorrelated, r(493) = .80, p < .001, a primary measure of overall distress was created by\ntransforming depression inventory scores and symptom checklist scores into standard\nscores and then averaging these standard scores. To normalize their distributions, values for\nthe lifestyle elements were transformed by the square root.\nTable 2 displays correlations between the lifestyle elements and the measure of\noverall distress, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hopkins Symptom Checklist. Only levels\nof rumination related reliably with either the overall distress measure or the component\nmeasures of the depression inventory and symptom checklist. Correlations for the other\nfive elements were all close to zero. Moreover, a regression analysis of all the elements\n= .3. Given the size of the sample, any substantial relationship would likely have been\ndetected. In fact, power analysis indicates that a sample of this size has a 95% chance of\nEvolutionary lifestyle and mental health\ndetecting correlations greater than .16 at the .05 confidence level.\nIt is possible that moderate levels of some of the lifestyle elements are associated\nwith better mental health, whereas extreme levels are related to greater distress. We\ntherefore assessed this possibility of curvilinear effects.

We therefore assessed whether participant age might moderate\nrelationships between the lifestyle elements and distress. These analyses failed to indicate\nthat the relationship of any of the elements with distress varied as a function of age (all\ninteraction ps > .1).\nTable 2.

Rumination was related to distress more strongly for males (r = .52, p\nrelationship between exposure to sunlight and distress differed between males and females,\ninteraction partial r = .09, p = .05, neither the relationship for males (r = -.11, p = .2) nor\nEvolutionary lifestyle and mental health\nfor females (r = .08, p = .2) differed reliably from zero.\nDiscussion\nAmong participants in the study, time spent ruminating was the only one of the six\nlifestyle elements to yield a simple linear relationship with psychological distress. This\nfinding is consistent with previous research regarding ruminative thought processes (e.g.,\ncontrast, levels of sleep, omega-3, exercise, exposure to sunlight, and socialization--either\nindividually or taken together--did not correlate reliably with the distress measures. The\nfailure to detect such correlations is especially striking given the substantial statistical\npower of the analyses.\nFurther analysis did indicate that sleep was related to mental health, although in a\nnonlinear fashion. There seemed to be an optimum range of sleep: Typical amounts were\nassociated with lower distress, whereas participants who slept either less or more than the\nmid values reported greater distress. This result parallels evidence from other research\nsuggesting the advantages of an optimum sleep range (e.g., Kaneita et al., 1996).\nParticipants in the study reported relatively low levels for many of the lifestyle\nelements and this may explain the lack of other relationships with distress. For example,\nalthough research has established the effectiveness of light therapy for improving mood\n(e.g., Golden et al., 2005), investigators have noted that the time individuals typically spend\nexposed to sunlight is rather low--as was the case in the present sample--and the intensity\nof natural sunlight is less than that provided in bright light therapy research (Espiritu et al.,\n1994). Similarly, investigations that have linked omega-3 and exercise to psychological\ndistress involved much higher levels than observed in our sample (e.g., for omega-3, see\nRelationships between the lifestyle elements and distress may also have been\nsuppressed because of the way the elements were measured. For instance, research focusing\non the quality of social interactions has found that positive social experiences correlate with\nbetter mental health (e.g., Cohen, 2004; Ezquiaga, Garcia, Pallares, and Bravo, 1999). In\nthis study, however, participants indicated only how much time they spent socializing, not\nthe quality of those interactions. Also, participants may have been inaccurate in their\nreporting of the lifestyle elements. In particular, they may not have been sufficiently\nknowledgeable about omega-3 or the amounts of omega-3 typically found in foods (e.g.,\nVerbeke, Sioen, Pieniak, Van Camp, and De Henauw, 2005). Further, past research\nmeasuring omega-3 has used biological measures such as blood levels (Edwards, Peet,\nShay, and Horrobin 1997). Measuring the elements using similar biological measures or\ndaily intake diaries may yield more accurate reports than retrospective recollections.\nNevertheless, if the links with mental health are robust, even a relatively crude self-report\nmeasure of the lifestyle elements would be expected to reveal relationships between these\nelements and distress.\nEvolutionary lifestyle and mental health\nBecause our goal was to examine the role of the lifestyle elements in the general\npopulation, participants were drawn from a nonclinical sample. Not surprisingly, the degree\nof psychological distress reported by participants in the study was relatively modest\ncompared to that observed in clinical populations (e.g., see Beck et al., 1996, chap. 3;\nDerogatis et al., 1974b). Relationships between the lifestyle elements and distress may\nsimply not occur within the range of distress levels of a normal population.\nWe did not find that the pattern of relationships between the lifestyle elements and\ndistress varied as a function of age. However, this was a college-age sample in which there\nwere relatively few older participants. Therefore, any moderating effect of age may have\nbeen difficult to detect.\nAlthough rumination was related to distress for both males and females, our\nanalyses indicated that the relationship was stronger for males. It is unclear why this pattern\ndiffers from other research, which has suggested a stronger relationship among females\nBecause rumination had by far the strongest and most straightforward relationship\nwith distress, adding other lifestyle elements to traditional anti-rumination strategies may\nbe unnecessary. Dealing only with problematic thought processes might be as effective as a\ntherapy combining multiple elements. Of course, this treatment implication presupposes\nthat our observed correlation between rumination and distress stems from rumination\ncausing distress rather than the other way around.\nPromoting a lifestyle more consistent with that of the evolutionary past seems a\nplausible approach to enhancing mental health. In fact, researchers have recently\nrecommended to the general public just such lifestyle changes for alleviating psychological\ndistress (e.g., Klein, 2007). However, results from the present study suggest that\nrelationships between many of these lifestyle elements and distress may not be particularly\nprominent within the range of values typically found in the general population. To be\neffective in reducing psychological distress, an intervention may need to expose individuals\nto these lifestyle elements at the higher levels more similar to those experienced by our\nPaleolithic ancestors.\nNotes\n1 An additional 22 individuals were excluded from the analyses because their questionnaires were not fully\ncompleted.\n2 Only 21 individuals used a verbal response when completing the Lifestyle Elements Scale. The pattern of\ncorrelations between the lifestyle elements and the measures of distress were comparable when these\nparticipants were excluded.\nEvolutionary lifestyle and mental health\n"
