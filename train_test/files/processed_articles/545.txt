The purpose of this paper was to describe the data\ncollection methods and report preliminary population estimates for each measures.\nMethod. Frequencies, means, or medians were estimated for each measure stratified by age and gender, using the\nage-eligible samples in Wave 1 (n = 3,005) and Wave 2 (n = 3,196). An adapted phenotypic frailty scale was constructed\nin the sample common to both waves (n = 2,261). Changes over 5 years were reported for four measures common to\nboth waves.\nResults. The functional measures worsened with age (p < .001). The syndromes were more prevalent with age except\n\"all fractures\" (p value range < .001\u00ad.03). Functional measures were worse among females than males except chair\nstand performance and the accelerometry-assessed (in)activity measures (p value range < .001\u00ad.01). The syndromes\nwere more common among females than males except Wave 2 falls and Wave 2 hip fractures (p value range < .001\u00ad.03).\nworse health.\nDiscussion. The NSHAP provides a comprehensive assessment of geriatric health. Our findings are consistent with\nthe literature and support the construct of the study measures.\nKey Words:\nAccelerometry--Falls--Fracture--Frailty--Functional assessment--Gait--Older adults--Physical\nactivity.\nEvaluating functional status and geriatric syn-\ndromes are critical to the health assessment of older\nadults and are often used to help predict their subsequent\nhealth outcomes. Both subjective and objective evalua-\ntions of geriatric functional measures (GFM) and geriat-\nric syndromes (GS) exist. These measures may be used\nindividually or collectively in indices. Older adults con-\nstitute a rapidly growing and increasingly heterogeneous\npopulation (Engelman, Canudas-Romo, & Agree, 2010),\nand accurate assessments of their functional status and the\npresence of geriatric syndromes are essential for efficient\ndelivery of high-quality and cost-effective care. The utility\nand application of prognostic tests has, therefore, become\na central issue in efforts to individualize and optimize\nmedical care.\nTo inform these efforts, this paper describes several\nkey functional and geriatric syndrome measures col-\nlected in Wave 1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2) of the National\nSocial Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). The\nGFM collected in W1 and/or W2 of the NSHAP data\nset include disability in activities of daily living (ADL)\nor instrumental ADL (IADL), timed up and go (TUG),\ntimed walk (TW), timed chair stands (TCS), and both\nself-report and accelerometry-measured physical activity\n(Figure 1). The GS measured in W1 and W2 of NSHAP\nincludes a history of falls, prior fracture, incontinence,\ndepression, cognitive impairment, and pain (Figure 1).\nWe also propose a frailty scale based on Fried's frailty\nphenotype utilizing NSHAP's available measures for use\nin W2. For each GFM and GS, excluding incontinence,\ndepression, cognitive impairment, and pain which are\npresented in other papers in this issue (citation to fol-\nlow), we describe the data collection and preliminary\nfindings of the NSHAP by age and gender subgroups. We\nalso report the change in these measures between W1 and\nW2 for the sample included in both waves. We conclude\nby reviewing some considerations for data use in future\nstudies.\nMegan Huisingh-Scheetz ET AL.\nMethod\nNSHAP W1 and W2 Overview\nNSHAP was designed to evaluate the health and well-\nbeing of older adults within the context of their romantic\npartners and social context. The NSHAP data set includes\nsurvey and biomeasure data collected from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of community-dwelling older adults.\nL. J., Laumann, E. O., Levinson, W., Lindau, S. T., &\nO'Muircheartaigh, C. A. National Social Life, Health, and\narbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and\nE., Laumann, E. O., McClintock, M., O'Muircheartaigh, C.\nA., Schumm, L. P., and Cornwell, B. National Social Life,\nHealth, and Aging Project (NSHAP): Wave 2 and Partner\nuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research [dis-\nassessments were conducted in the home by trained NORC\n85 were interviewed. These W1 respondents were reinter-\nor partners in addition to newly recruited respondents and\npartners, for a total of 3,377 completed interviews; however,\nonly a subset of partners were considered \"age-eligible\" and\nfell between the ages of 62 and 91 (O'Muirchaigtaigh et al.,\nthis issue). Excluding age-ineligible respondents, the total\nW2 sample was 3,196. Of the total age-eligible sample inter-\nboth W1 and W2 assessments. Respondents were selected\nusing a multistage area probability design, with oversam-\npling among men and minorities. The detailed sampling\ndesign, respondent recruitment, and study methods have\nbeen reported elsewhere (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &\nW1 and W2 Evaluations\nThe W1 data collection contained two main parts: (a) the\n1.5-hr in-person computer-assisted interview (CAPI) with a\ncore biomeasure assessment, and (b) a leave-behind ques-\ntionnaire (LBQ), a paper-and-pencil questionnaire com-\npleted by the respondent on their own time. In addition to\nthese key portions, there were six substudies containing\nvarious combinations of additional questions and additional\nbiomeasures. W1 respondents were randomly assigned a pri-\nori to complete one of six evaluation pathways which deter-\nmined: (a) which additional questions and biomeasures were\nto be administered and (b) whether the additional questions\nwere to be given in the CAPI or in the LBQ. These pathways\nhave been previously described (Smith et al., 2009).\nIn W2, all respondents were also administered a CAPI\nwith a core biomeasure assessment and LBQ. W2 had three\nadditional biomeasure substudies which were administered\nin a subset of respondents following random assignment to\nan interview path (Jaszczak et al., this issue). In addition, a\nrandomized subset of the W2 sample (n = 738) participated\nin an Actigraph Study which included the accelerometry\nprotocol and a separate self-report sleep activity log. W2\npathways are described in detail elsewhere in this journal\nissue (Jaszczak et al., this issue).\nFunctional Assessment\nADL and IADL.--Difficulty with ADL and IADL were\nassessed by self-report in W1 and W2 in the CAPI portion\nof the interview. All W1 and W2 participants were asked to\nreport degree of difficulty completing the following ADL\nactivities: (a) walking one block, (b) walking across a room,\n(c) dressing, including putting on shoes and socks, (d) bath-\ning or showering, (e) eating, such as cutting up food, (f)\ngetting in or out of bed, and (g) using the toilet, includ-\ning getting up and down. All W1 participants were asked to\nreport degree of difficulty completing the following IADL\nactivities: (a) driving a car during the day and (b) driving a\ncar during the night. Only W2 participants were asked to\nreport degree of difficulty completing the IADL activities:\n(a) preparing meals, (b) taking medications, (c) managing\nmoney such as writing checks and keeping track of bills,\n(d) shopping for groceries, (e) performing light housework\nsuch as dishes, light vacuuming, or dusting, (f) using a tel-\nephone, (g) driving a car during the day, and (h) driving\na car during the night. Answer options for all ADL/IADL\nquestions in both waves included (a) no difficulty, (b) some\ndifficulty, (c) much difficulty, or (d) unable to do. In W2,\ninterviewers also recorded whether the respondent stated\nthey have never previously done the IADL.\nFigure 1.NSHAP geriatric functional measures and geriatric syndromes.\nNSHAP = National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project.\nFor the current analysis, we created anADL scale for both\nW1 and W2 and an IADL scale for W2 to measure func-\ntional ability. To create the scales, we assigned one point for\neach activity that was reportedly done without difficulty. We\nsummed the points for each activity to give a total score. For\ntheADL scale, we included the following activities: walking\na block, walking across the room, dressing, bathing, eating,\ntransferring in and out of bed, and toileting. For the IADL\nscale, we included meal preparation, money management,\nshopping, light housework, medication administration, tel-\nephone use, driving during the day, and driving during the\nnight. The ADL scales ranged from 0\u00ad7, a score of 7 indi-\ncating the best function. The IADL scale ranged from 0\u00ad8,\na score of 8 indicating the best function. (Researchers may\nconsider an alternative scale that consolidates the two walk-\ning ADL functions. For example, respondents able to \"walk\na block\" should be able to \"walk across a room\" and could\nbe assigned only 1 point; respondents only able to \"walk\nacross a room\" could be assigned 0.5 point.)\nTimed up and go.--In W1 only, approximately half of\nthe respondents (N = 1,506) were randomly assigned to\ncomplete a 3-m TUG test (Podsiadlo & Richardson, 1991)\n((Respondents who were wheelchair bound or were unsafe to\ncomplete the gait or chair stands exercise were also identified\nas \"unable to do\" and considered the group with the poorest\nfunctional status for that measure.). Using a chair from the\nhome setting and a 3-m length of string placed on the floor\nstarting at the chair legs and extending directly outward, the\ninterviewer first demonstrated the activity and then asked the\nrespondent to complete the task. Respondents were allowed\nto use walking assistive devices and were recommended to\nwalk at a \"comfortable and safe\" pace. Time was recorded\nat the end of three intervals during the TUG test: (a) start-\ning with respondent seated in the chair and ending when the\nrespondent reached the end of the 3-m string, (b) starting\nwith the respondent turn and ending when the respondent\nreached the chair, (c) starting with the respondent initiation\nof sit movement and ending with respondent fully seated.\nThe total time to complete this test was calculated by sum-\nming the three intervals. Interviewers recorded any observed\ngait abnormalities (Gait abnormalities noted include: walked\nunsteadily; limped, shuffled or dragged a leg; had an unsteady\nturn; used a cane or walker; or stated the walk was painful).\nThe TUG test was scored using previously published guide-\nlines (Podsiadlo & Richardson, 1991). Respondents complet-\ning the task in 10 or fewer seconds were considered to have\na \"normal\" performance; respondents requiring 11\u00ad20 s to\ncomplete the task were considered to have a \"delayed\" per-\nformance; respondents requiring more than 20 s to complete\nthe task were considered to have an \"impaired\" performance.\nGait speed.--In W2 only, respondents completed a 3-m\nTW which was completed two times (Respondents who\nwere wheelchair bound or were unsafe to complete the gait\nor chair stands exercise were also identified as \"unable to do\"\nand considered the group with the poorest functional status\nfor that measure). The TW exercise was derived from the\nShort Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (Guralnik et al.,\n1994). The interviewer first demonstrated the exercise for\nthe respondent. The respondents were asked to stand at the\nbeginning of a 3-m piece of string. When given a cue, they\nwalked the length of the string at their \"usual pace.\" Walking\ndevices such as a cane or walker were allowed during the\ntask. Interviewers recorded the total time required to com-\nplete each walk. Exercise limitations were identified when\npresent (Exercise limitations noted included: there was an\nequipment problem; the respondent tried but was unable to\ncomplete the task; the respondent could not walk unassisted;\nthe walk was not attempted due to respondent or interviewer\nsafety concerns; the respondent could not understand the\ninstructions; or other reasons prevented completion of task).\nInterviewers also noted any observed gait abnormalities as\ndescribed above. Scoring of the fastest TW was based on the\ngait speed score for the SPPB, which originally applied to a\n4-m walk (Guralnik et al., 1994) but scoring was later pro-\nvided for an 8-foot walk (Guralnik et al., 2000): 1 point if the\nChair stands.--TCS were measured in W2 only\n(Respondents who were wheelchair bound or were unsafe to\ncomplete the gait or chair stands exercise were also identified\nas \"unable to do\" and considered the group with the poor-\nest functional status for that measure). The TCS exercise was\nadapted from the SPPB (Guralnik et al., 1994). Respondents\nwere first asked to complete a single chair stand using a chair\nin the home setting without the use of their arms. The inter-\nviewer first demonstrated the activity: feet were planted firmly\non the ground leaving approximately one hand's width of\nspace between the knee and the chair, arms were folded across\nthe chest, and the person attempted to stand keeping the arms\nfolded. At the end of the task, interviewers noted any exer-\ncise limitations as described above. If the single chair stand\nwas successful, the respondent was asked to perform the TCS\nexercise, five serial chair stands, as quickly as possible. The\ntime was recorded after the respondent completely stood up\non the fifth stand. Exercise limitations were again identified\nas previously described. Scoring of the TCS was based on the\noriginal TCS score from the SPPB: 1 point if time to complete\nPhysical Activity\nNSHAP measured physical activity in two ways: (a)\nself-report in both waves and (b) accelerometry in Wave\n2. Accelerometers have been applied extensively in clini-\ncal and research settings to objectively measure physical\nMegan Huisingh-Scheetz ET AL.\nactivity (Cheung, Gray, & Karunanithi, 2011; Kowalski,\nRhodes, Naylor, Tuokko, & Macdonald, 2012; Prince et al.,\n2008). NSHAP used Actiwatch Spectrum accelerometers to\nevaluate physical activity objectively in a subset of W2 study\nrespondents.\nPhysical activity measurement: self-report.--In W1, all\nrespondents were asked a single question about their exercise\nhabits: \"How often do you participate in physical activity such\nas walking, dancing, gardening, physical exercise, or sports?\"\nResponse options included: (a) 3 or more times per week, (b)\n1\u00ad2 times per week, (c) 1\u00ad3 times per month, (d) less than 1\ntime per month, (e) never, (f) don't know, or (g) refused.\nIn W2, self-reported physical activity was assessed using\nfour questions. All respondents were asked to report their\nparticipation in vigorous physical activity with the follow-\ning question: \"On average over the last 12 months, how\noften have you participated in vigorous physical activity or\nexercise? By vigorous physical activity, we mean 30 MIN\nOR MORE of things like sports, exercise classes, heavy\nhousework, or a job that involves physical labor.\" Answer\nchoices included (a) 5 or more times per week, (b) 3 or 4\ntimes per week, (c) 1\u00ad2 times per week, (d) 1\u00ad3 times per\nmonth, (e) less than 1 time per month, or (f) never. In the\ncurrent analysis, respondents reporting \"3 or 4 activities per\nweek\" or \"5 or more activities per week\" were combined\ninto a single category to be able to compare it to W1 data.\nAdditionally in W2, respondents in the Actigraph Study\n(n = 793 total; n = 738 age eligible) were given a take-home\nsleep activity log. Respondents were asked about the frequency\nof their involvement in three intensities of activity. First, \"How\noften do you take part in sports or activities that are vigorous,\nsuch as running or jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics or\ngym workout, tennis, or digging with a spade or shovel?\"\nSecond, \"How often do you take part in sports or activities\nthat are moderately energetic, such as gardening, cleaning the\ncar, walking at a moderate pace, dancing, or floor or stretching\nexercises?\" Third, \" How often do you take part in sports or\nactivities that are mildly energetic, such as vacuuming, laun-\ndry, or home repairs?\"Answer options were the same for each\nquestion: (a) more than once a week, (b) once a week, (c) one\nto three times a month, and (d) hardly ever or never.\nPhysical activity measurement: actigraphy.--A random\nsample (n = 738) of the W2 respondents was included\nin the Actigraph Study. The Actiwatch Spectrum model\n(Actiwatch Spectrum; Philips Respironics, Andover, MA),\na uniaxial, omnidirectional, piezo-electric, waterproof\naccelerometer worn on the wrist (Respironics, 2013), was\nused in the NSHAP Actigraph Study to objectively measure\nsleep and physical activity patterns. It continuously collects\nacceleration/deceleration data at a rate of 32 Hz; the move-\nments are then averaged in real time over 15-s intervals\ncalled \"epochs\" and recorded as an activity \"count.\" If no\nactivity occurs during the epoch, such as during sleep or\nrest, 0 is recorded for that activity count. There are 5,760\nactivity counts recorded per day. The Actiwatch Spectrum\nis optimized to collect movement in the 0.35\u00ad7.5 Hz range.\nTo help distinguish sleep and awake intervals, theActiwatch\nSpectrum model also records ambient light exposure and\nwearers can record when they go to bed and when they\nsize and weighs 30g. Data stored in the accelerometer can\nbe downloaded and analyzed using the Actiware software\navailable from the manufacturer (Respironics, 2013). Once\nthe data are downloaded, rest and wake intervals can be\nidentified using manufacturer-suggested guidelines, cues\nfrom respondent recordings, and the light data (Lauderdale\net al., this issue). Several commonly used accelerometer\nmeasurements, including the rest and wake intervals, are\nalso available in the public NSHAP W2 data set.\nRespondents were given instructions during the interview\non use of the accelerometer monitors. Then, a copy of the\ninstructions was mailed with the monitors to the participating\nrespondents. Respondents were asked to place the monitors\non their nondominant wrist and to wear the monitors for 72hr\n(notremovedduringwateractivitieslikebathing.)Sleepactiv-\nity booklets were also provided and respondents were asked\nto record daily events including date, time arising, number of\nminutes napped, and time to bed. Respondents also pushed\na button on the monitors to indicate when they went to bed\nand when they got up from bed. After confirming the mailing\naddress, interviewers called respondents to arrange a time of\npackage delivery.After use, the monitors were returned to the\nproject in a prepaid mailing box. When the accelerometers\nwere returned, the data were downloaded using the Actiware\nsoftware. Preliminary findings are reported for the follow-\ning measures: mean count over the total wear time, peak\ncount during total wear time, and percent of day spent at rest\n(count = 0). For each gender/age subgroup, we presented the\nGeriatric Syndromes\nFalls.--Respondents' falls history was collected via\nself-report in both W1 and W2 of NSHAP. In W1, respond-\nents were first asked whether they had fallen in the past\n12 months. If the respondents answered \"yes,\" they were\nthen asked, \"How many times have you fallen in the past\n12 months?\" Responses were recorded as integers. In W2,\nall respondents were asked if they had fallen 0, 1, or 2 or\nmore times in the last year in the LBQ. For this analysis, we\nseparately reported the percent of participants in W1 and\nW2 who reported falling once in the past year and the per-\ncent who reported two or more times in the last year.\nFracture.--History of fracture was assessed by self-\nreport in W1 and W2. In W1, respondents were asked in\ntheir interview whether they had a fracture or broken a bone\nafter the age of 45. For those answering \"yes,\" a follow-\nup question asked respondents to identify which bone\nwas broken (hip, leg, wrist, vertebrae/backbone, or other).\nIf respondents reported \"other\" bone, they were asked to\nspecify. In W2, an interviewer asked all respondents if a\ndoctor had ever told them they had a hip fracture. In the\nLBQ, respondents were also asked whether they have had\na fracture or broken bone in the past 5 years (e.g., since the\nW1 survey). Those who responded yes were asked to iden-\ntify which bone was fractured (hip, leg, wrist, vertebrae/\nbackbone, nose, skull, or other). If respondents reported\n\"other\" bone, they were asked to specify. In this analysis,\nwe reported results for the LBQ question.\nFrailty.--Frailty measurement. Several proposed mod-\nels for measuring frailty exist including the accumulated\ndeficits index first proposed by Rockwood et al. (Mitnitski,\nMogilner, & Rockwood, 2001), a set of phenotypic crite-\nria proposed by Fried and colleagues (2001), and a physi-\ncian index proposed by Studenski and colleagues (2004).\nSeveral frailty measurements could be constructed using\nthe NSHAP data set. As an example, we proposed adapted\nfrailty phenotypic criteria in W2 based on the original\nfive criteria: (a) unintentional weight loss, (b) weak grip\nstrength, (c) slow gait speed, (d) presence of exhaustion,\nand (e) low physical activity (Fried et al., 2001).\nAll five of the criteria were either directly measured\nor a surrogate measure was available in the subset of W2\nrespondents included in both waves. Presence of exhaus-\ntion was determined using two modified Center for\nEpidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale ques-\ntions (Radloff, 1977). Respondents were asked how often\nover the last week they felt that everything was an effort and\nhow often they felt that they could not get going. Answer\noptions for both questions included: (a) rarely or none of\nthe time, (b) some of the time, (c) occasionally, or (d) most\nof the time. A point for exhaustion was assigned to respond-\nents who answered \"occasionally\" or \"most of the time\" to\neither of these questions. Gait speed was measured directly.\nA point for slow gait speed was given to individuals requir-\ning 5.7 s to complete the TW and to individuals who were\nwheelchair bound or could not complete the exercise safely.\nPhysical activity was assessed using a single self-reported\nquestion described above in W2. Respondents were given a\npoint for low physical activity if they reported participating\nin physical activity \"1\u00ad3 times per month,\" \"less than 1 time\nper month,\" or \"never.\" TCS was used as a surrogate meas-\nure for grip strength. Respondents were assigned a point for\nweakness if they required 16.7 s to complete the exercise\nor were wheelchair bound or could not complete the task\nsafely. Weight loss was calculated by determining the dif-\nference in measured weight between W1 and W2 for each\nrespondent. A weight loss point was assigned to individuals\nlosing 10% of their weight or more. A frailty score, ranging\n0\u00ad5, was created by summing the points for each criteria.\nA similar but abbreviated frailty scale could be constructed\nin W1 using self-reported exhaustion, TUG performance in\nplace of gait and chair stands, and self-reported physical\nactivity participation; weight loss was not measured in W1.\nChange Over Time\nSeveral GFM and GS measures were available in both\nwaves allowing comparison of trend over time: self-reported\nphysical activity, gait/chair stand evaluation, ADL func-\ntion, and falls. For these measures, we reported the follow-\ning changes over time: (a) proportion of respondents who\nimproved, (b) proportion of respondents who stayed the\nsame, and (c) the proportion of respondents who declined\nover 5 years. In addition, the 5-year incidence was also cal-\nculated for the following measures: those reporting 3 vig-\norous activities per month, those declining to the slowest\n25th percentile of the sample for gait and chair stand perfor-\nmance, those reporting dependence in at least oneADL, and\nthose reporting two or more falls in the prior year.\nSince gait and chair stand function were evaluated\ntogether using the TUG in W1 and separately in W2 using\nthe TW and TCS, we summed the fastest walk time from\nthe TW and the time to complete the TCS. Comparing the\nW1 TUG measure to the combined W2 measure yielded\nthe best correlation factor of all attempted combinations of\nthe variables: 0.29 (Figure 2). To indentify the proportion\nof the sample who performed better, worse, or stayed the\nsame on their walk and chair stand performance, we calcu-\nlated the change in quantile among respondents with non-\nmissing values for both measures. To report the incidence\nof the poorest performers, we identified the proportion of\nrespondents whose time to complete the exercises dropped\ninto the lowest 25th percentile in W2\nFastest 3 m Walk + 5 Repeated Chair Stands\n(seconds)\nTimed Up and Go (seconds)\nFigure 2.

Pearson's correlation coefficient r = .29.\nMegan Huisingh-Scheetz ET AL.\nStatistical Analysis\nVersion 2.1 of the NSHAP data set was used for all analy-\nses. Sample design weights were used in the analyses to\naccount for the complex survey design and to obtain point\nestimates and standard errors that reflect the national popula-\ntion composition. Proportions, means, or medians were esti-\nmated for each functional measure and geriatric syndrome\nstratified by age/gender subgroups using the age-eligible\nrespondents in W1 and W2. Standard errors are presented for\nall values. The significance of age and gender was assessed\nusing linear (log TUG, log gait speed, log chair stands, mean\nactivity count, peak activity count, percent time spent at rest)\nand logistic regression (physical activity: 0\u00ad2 vs. 3\u00ad4; ADL:\nno vs. yes; hip fractures: no vs. yes; osteoporotic fractures: no\nvs. yes; frailty: 0\u00ad2 vs. 3+) as appropriate for each functional\nmeasure and geriatric syndrome, though only p values for t\ntests are reported in the text. Stata 13 (StataCorp, 2011) was\nused for all analyses except to calculate medians and quan-\ntiles. TUG, TW, and TCS medians and quantile summaries of\nactigraphy data were obtained using the R 2.15 (R Core) (R\nDevelopment Core Team, 2012) svyquantile function avail-\nResults\nFunctional Assessment\nADLs and IADLs.--Using the ADL scale in W1, mean\nADL functional ability was 6.2 (SE = 0.04) for the total sam-\nple. ADL function significantly declined with age (p < .001)\nand was worse among females (p < .001). Therefore, the\noldest age groups had the worst ADL function (men = 5.9,\nthe total sample. Difficulty with ADL functions was more\ncommon with advancing age (p < .001) and among females\n(p = .001). The oldest age groups has the worst ADL func-\nthe W2 IADL scale, mean IADL functional ability was 7.0\n(SE = 0.6) for the total sample. Difficulty with IADL func-\ntions was also more common with advancing age (p < .001)\nand among females (p < .001). The oldest groups had the\nTUG.--In the W1, 1,506 respondents were randomized\nto complete the TUG test (Table 1). The median time to\ncomplete the TUG for the entire sample was 10.8 s (range\n3\u00ad118 s). TUG performance was significantly slower\namong women than among men (p = .003) and worsened\nwith age (p < .001). Of the total sample, 7.1% (SE = 1) took\ngreater than 20 s to complete the exercise, whereas 41.3%\n(SE = 2) completed the exercise within 10 s, the fastest per-\nformance category.\nGait speed.--All of the age-eligible respondents in W2\nwere asked to complete two, 3-m TWs (n = 3,196). One\nwalk time was recorded as 0 s. Since 0 s is not physi-\nologically possible, this value was recoded as missing.\nExcluding this respondent, the median gait speed for the\ntotal sample was 4.1 s (range 2\u00ad60 s). Gait speed sig-\nnificantly declined with age (p < .001) and was generally\nslower among women (p = .01). Of the faster of the two\nwalks, approximately 29.6% (SE = 1.5) of the age-eligible\n(SE = 1.2) were able to walk the same distance in less than\nChair stands.--All of the W2 age-eligible respondents\nwere asked to complete the TCS (n = 3,196). One TCS\ntime was recorded as 1 s. Since 1 s is not physiologi-\ncally possible, this value was recoded as missing.

The variation in reported activities between W1\nand W2 is likely due, in part, to differences in question\nwording.\nActigraphy data was collected in 793 W2 respondents;\nonly 738 of them were age-eligible (Table 3). The mean\nactivity count and the peak activity count significantly\ndeclined with age (p < .001 for both), while percentage of\ntime spent at rest increased with age (p = .005). The mean\nactivity count was significantly higher among females than\nmales (p < .001); peak activity count and percentage of\ntime spent at rest did not vary by gender (peak activity\ncount p = .59, percentage time spent at rest p = .26). The\n5th percentile of the mean activity count for this sample\nactivity count was 63.0 counts per day (SE = 2.4). The\nmedian percent of time spent at rest was 50.2% (SE = 0.9),\nbut this measure varied widely: its 5th percentile was 38%\nof the day (SE = 0.7).\nTable 1.

Overall prevalence of\nW2, prevalence of all fractures in the prior 5 years in the\ntotal sample was 12.7% (SE = 1) (Table 2).

The con-\nsistent application of objective functional measures like\nTCS, TW, and accelerometry across several studies (e.g.,\nStudy of Osteoporotic Fractures; Health, Aging, and Body\nComposition; Minority Aging Project) allows for compari-\nson between the NSHAP cohort and other large, American\ncohorts. NSHAP's baseline and 5-year follow-up data fur-\nthermore allow the evaluation of functional status trends\nover time. Below we highlight several ways in which the\nNSHAP data could be used in future research and note\nissues that researchers should consider when using the data.\nThe NSHAP GFM and GS are appropriate for use as\neither primary outcome variables or covariates. For exam-\nple, two or more falls could be used as an outcome in studies\ninvestigating fall risk factors. In contrast, studies compar-\ning the size of social networks among subgroups might\nTable 2.

Slow gait speed, for example, may occur as a\nresult of worsening heart failure (an outcome of the disease)\nand can also help identify people with more severe stages\nof heart failure (disease burden). The NSHAP functional\nmeasures allow for these important comparisons in older\nadult health studies.\nSelf-reported measures have been used widely among\nnationally representative datasets given its relative brev-\nity and ease of administration (e.g., National Health and\nNutrition Evaluation Survey, Health and Retirement Study).\nAmong older adults--particularly those with cognitive\nTable 3.

While NSHAP excluded people with a history of\ndementia, it is not uncommon for early cognitive impair-\nment to go undiagnosed in the community (Bradford,\nKunik, Schulz, Williams, & Singh, 2009) and, indeed, vary-\ning levels of cognitive functioning were identified in this\npopulation (Kotwal et al., this issue). NSHAP uniquely\noffers several objective measures in this national data set\nproviding for numerous opportunities to evaluate subjective\nversus objective survey measurements.\nActigraphy-measured physical activity is a distinctive\nfeature of the NSHAP data set; however, several points\nshould be considered when using the actigraphy data. The\nActiwatch Spectrum is one of several Actiwatch models\nTable 6.

Each\nActiwatch model has unique features; the Actiwatch 2 and\nActiwatch Spectrum have a more durable accelerometer\nthan the Actiwatch 64. Data output between these models,\nhowever, is highly correlated (\"Equivalence of Activity\nRecordings and Derived Sleep Statistics: Actiwatch-64,\nActiwatch-2, and Actiwatch Spectrum,\" 2008). Older\nActiwatch models have been used to validate the acceler-\nometer against indirect calorimetry (Chen et al., 2003; Van\nRemoortel et al., 2012). The output (activity counts) from\nthe Actiwatch models are moderately correlated (r = .53)\nwith minute-to-minute metabolic equivalents (kcal/kg\n\u00d7 hr) measured by indirect calorimetry in older, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease adults performing a set of\nlab-based exercises mimicking typical day-to-day activities\n(Van Remoortel et al., 2012). Activity counts are also sig-\nnificantly correlated (0.65\u00b10.09) with indirect calorimeter-\nmeasured energy expenditure in kilocalories among young\nto middle-aged, healthy but sedentary women (Chen et al.,\n2003). The value of individual activity counts can, there-\nfore, be used to help identify periods of higher or lower\nintensity activity or inactivity.\nA few Actiwatch Spectrum limitations are also worth\nnoting. The Actiwatch is worn on the wrist and does not\nreadily detect (a) the increase of intensity when activities\nare performed on an incline or (b) acceleration when activi-\nties are performed on stationary units (i.e., ergometers). For\nthe NSHAP data set, activities such as stair-climbing or\nstationary bicycle use may be underrepresented. Previous\nresearchers have published an equation to predict kilocalo-\nrie energy expenditure from the Actiwatch activity counts\n(Chen et al., 2003). Predicted energy expenditure is only\nmodestly correlated with measured energy expenditure and\ntypically underestimates measured kilocalories, particularly\nat higher intensity activity (Chen et al., 2003).\nFrailty, defined as a state of increased vulnerability and\nloss of ability to maintain homeostasis (Rockwood, Fox,\nStolee, Robertson, & Beattie, 1994), is an important clini-\ncal concept carrying significant prognostic weight, predict-\ning subsequent disability, falls, and mortality. A number of\nindexes of frailty for older adults have been suggested, each\nwith advantages and disadvantages. While we proposed\nadapted frailty phenotype criteria, other frailty measures\ncould easily be constructed using the NSHAP data set and\nThe modifications to the frailty phenotype criteria raise\nseveral notable considerations. Respondents may be more\nlikely to meet the frailty criteria for exhaustion using the\nNSHAP alterations to the wording in the CES-D (\"occa-\nsionally\" replaced \"occasionally or a moderate amount of\ntime.\"). In the Cardiovascular Health Study, Fried and col-\nreported exhaustion, while the NSHAP study found 24.9%\nin W1 and 24.3% in W2. In addition, depressed respondents\nmay be classified as prefrail using the proposed frailty scale\nbased on exhaustion as a symptom of their depression rather\nthan a symptom of their physical decline.\nThe TW is not adjusted for height or gender like the\noriginal 15-foot walk in the frailty phenotype (Fried et al.,\n2001). Not accounting for these factors could conceivably\noverestimate the presence of slow gait speed among those\nwith short stature or among women compared with men. In\naddition, the W1 and W2 gait exercises differed. Comparing\ngait performance in W1 to W2 may be best done through\nchange in quantile for each respondent.\nMeasured weight loss is calculated over the course of\nthe 5-year follow-up from W1 to W2. While the original\nfrailty phenotype criteria used 5% or more of unintentional\nweight loss over 1 year, extrapolations of this criteria have\nbeen applied over longer intervals (Xue, Bandeen-Roche,\nmore weight loss as the adapted criteria; however, investi-\ngators may have reasons for choosing an alternative cutoff.\nNSHAP did not distinguish intentional from unintentional\nweight loss and may consequently overestimate frailty, par-\nticularly among the respondents who were actively trying\nto lose weight during this time frame. However, given the\nsedentary lifestyle of most U.S. adults (Li et al., 2011) as\nwell as the difficulty sustaining weight loss for 5 years once\nachieved through lifestyle modifications (Kraschnewski\net al., 2010), this type of overestimation is probably rare.\nFinally, using chair stands as a surrogate for grip strength\nmay additionally introduce an estimation of balance and\nproprioception into what should be strictly a sarcopenia\nmeasure. Since loss of balance and proprioception have also\nbeen shown to correlate with frailty measures, substituting\nchair stands for grip strength is reasonable (Deshpande,\nStudying change over time in the function and geriatric\nsyndrome measures creates a unique opportunity to study,\nnot only decline in health, but also improvement in health\nas we have shown. Of particular importance in our aging\nsociety is studying the social environment predictors of\nimprovement in health. While we attempt to prevent any\navoidable circumstances that might precipitate functional\nloss, some acute events such as hospitalization will inevi-\ntably occur among elders. NSHAP can be used to help\nstudy the factors that promote function recovery. It should\nbe noted that some of the functional measures were simi-\nlar but not identical between waves. In particular, W1 used\nthe TUG while W2 used a separate TW and TCS. Caution\nis strongly advised when comparing these measures across\nwaves. It should also be noted that the sample participants\nwho dropped out of the study after W1 were less educated\nand more functionally impaired at baseline. Studying trends\nover time will not reflect this group and should be consid-\nered a limitation in future studies.\nIn conclusion, functional measures are some of the most\nimportant indicators of health status and tools for prognosis\nin older adults. NSHAP provides a rich resource for study-\ning functional status among a nationally-representative\nsample of older community-dwelling adults. These impor-\ntant clinical measures combined with the detailed data on\nsocial networks, disability, cognitive function, medication\nuse, mental health, comorbidity, and mortality provide a\nkey resource for investigating trends in health status among\nolder adults in the United States.\nFunding\nThe National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project is supported by\nthe National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute on\nResearch, the Office of AIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and\nresponsible for the data collection.
