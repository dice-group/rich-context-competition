Symptoms of\nENS include paradoxical obstruction, dry-\nness, suffocation, and dizziness. ENS, a term\nfirst coined by Kern and Stenkvist in 1994, is\na rare yet potentially debilitating complica-\ntion of inferior turbinate resection.1,2 There\nare three subtypes of ENS: ENS-inferior\nturbinate, ENS-middle turbinate, and ENS-\nboth based on the pathological changes in\nthe inferior, middle, and both turbinates,\nrespectively.3 Although ENS is not a mental\nillness, it greatly influences patients' quality\nof life, and psychological factors often cause\npatients to experience more pain. The inabil-\nity to diagnose ENS objectively has fuelled\nfurther speculation that it could be either a\nform of nasal neuropathy or rhinitis hyster-\nicus.4 In fact, ENS has not been given\nenough attention. It is described as an\niatrogenic disease that can make affected\npatients feel a paradoxical obstruction, and\nsome patients subjectively believe that the\noperation was unsuccessful. In recent years,\nsome such patients have retaliated against\nthe surgeon, and others have even com-\nmitted suicide as a result of their disabling\nsinonasal symptoms. However, the common\netiologies, optimal management, and vari-\nous treatment options for ENS remain con-\ntroversial. Thus, investigation of ENS\ntreatment is necessary. Surgical therapy is\na safe and effective treatment modality for\npatients with ENS, especially those with\npoor outcomes of conservative treatment.\nThe Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT) is a\nvalidated survey that examines general nasal\nsymptoms and can be used to compare\npreintervention and postintervention out-\ncomes. We used the SNOT to compare\npreoperative and postoperative symptoms\nexcluding olfactory disturbances after place-\nment of various ENS implants. The purpose\nof nasal surgery is to reduce the nasal cavity\nvolume, increase the nasal airway resistance,\nand reconstruct the nasal anatomical\nstructure.\nRecent studies have revealed that surgery\nmay result in clinical improvement in\npatients with ENS but that it does not\nguarantee improvement in all patients, and\ninsufficient evidence is available to favor any\nparticular implant material.5 Radical tur-\nbinate surgery is strongly opposed because\nit results in ENS, while the safety and\nlow invasiveness partial turbinectomy are\nguaranteed. Surgical treatment of ENS is\ntechnically difficult, and the outcome is\npoor. Some studies have indicated that\ndifferent materials have different treatment\neffects. The nasal airway resistance must be\nincreased by narrowing the nasal valve\nregion or reconstructing a pseudoturbinate\nin patients with ENS. Some researchers\nhave found that acellular dermis grafts are\nreliable, predictable, and readily shaped.6\nPlacement of Medpor implants (Stryker,\nKalamazoo, MI) in patients with ENS is\nassociated with statistically significant\nimprovements in disease-specific quality-of-\nlife measures.7 Some studies have revealed\nthat costal cartilage may be more useful than\nconchal cartilage in endonasal microplasty\nimplants and in the treatment of patients\nwith ENS.8 Bastier et al.9 found that use of\na b-tricalcium phosphate implant to repair\nthe head of the inferior turbinate is safe\nand efficient for restoration of nasal com-\nfort. Different materials are used in ENS\nimplants to alleviate ENS symptoms. Thus,\nwhether and how ENS can be cured is\nan important clinical question. Various\nmaterials are used, but there is currently no\nevidence that demonstrates the superiority\nof any one material or technique. Therefore,\nthe present meta-analysis was performed\nto evaluate the efficacy of implantation\nof foreign material grafts (FGs) versus\nautografts/allografts (AGs) in patients with\nENS. Additionally, because the efficacy of\nnasal air conditioning differs among various\ncountries,1 the curative effects of surgical\nmethods for ENS were compared to identify\nany differences between China and other\ncountries. The results are expected to pro-\nvide patients and clinicians with a realistic\nviewpoint on surgical outcomes.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nWe consulted the Preferred Items for\nSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\n(PRISMA) guidelines.10 A literature search\nwas conducted in MEDLINE (OVID\nand PubMed), EMBASE (OVID), and the\nCochrane Library (Wiley) from 1 January\nwords: ``empty nose syndrome,'' ``atrophic\nrhinitis,'' ``implants,'' and ``transplanting.''\nThe literature search was limited to the\nEnglish language. The abstracts were\nappraised for relevance, and full-text articles\nwere obtained as appropriate. The bibliog-\nraphy of each article was reviewed to iden-\ntify any other potentially relevant study. The\nsearch covered the literature published from\nthe year the database was established to\npreoperative and postoperative symptoms\nafter placement of ENS implants and attain-\nment of objective surgical outcomes by\nradiologic examination, nasal air flow evalu-\nation, and endoscopic scoring.\nEthical considerations\nAll analyses were based on previously pub-\nlished studies; thus, no ethical approval or\npatient consent was required.\nInclusion criteria\nThe inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis\nwere as follows: (i) All patients had a clinical\ndiagnosis of ENS, had failed conservative\nnasal hydration therapy, and had undergone\nENS implantation; (ii) the intervention\ninvolved the implantation of AGs or FGs;\n(iii) preoperative and postoperative param-\neters were compared; (iv) surgical outcomes\nwere assessed by the SNOT scores after\nimplantation; and (v) the study was a\nrandomized controlled trial (RCT) or obser-\nvational study.\nExclusion criteria\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (i)\nDuplicate publications, case reports, animal\nstudies, reviews, and systematic reviews and\n(ii) lack of a control group.\nData extraction\nData were extracted in duplicate by\ntwo independent investigators (Drs. Yang\nand Ke). Any disagreement was settled by\ndiscussion with a third reviewer (Dr. Hu).\nA third researcher was consulted when there\nwere discrepancies in the data, and agree-\nment was reached after discussion.\nThe following data were extracted from the\noriginal studies: first author, year of publica-\ntion, country, sample size, age, sex, surgery\nallocation, study design, follow-up, surgery\ntechnique, and SNOT scores.\nQuality assessment\nQuality assessment of the included RCTs was\nperformed using the Cochrane quality assess-\nment criteria.11 The prospective studies were\nevaluated using the Newcastle\u00adOttawa quality\nassessment scale.12 Two researchers con-\nducted a blinded quality assessment of the\nincluded studies. When the researchers' assess-\nments were discrepant, a third researcher was\nconsulted for the final grading.\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses of outcomes were performed\nwith Review Manager software (ver. 5.2;\nCochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).\nA Mantel\u00adHaenszel fixed-effects model or\nrandom-effects model was used to calculate\nsummary effect measures (risk ratio) with the\ncorresponding 95% confidence interval (CI),\nand forest plots were created. Homogeneity\nwas measured by the Cochrane 2 test.\nSubgroup meta-analyses were performed\naccording to the implant material and\nsources of different countries. The pooled\nparameters were the 95% CI and relative risk\n(RR). Publication bias was examined using\nBegg's test and Egger's test.7 A sensitivity\nanalysis was completed by converting the\npooled results into a fixed-effects model.\nResults\nIn total, 1612 publications were retrieved\nfrom the electronic and manual searches. No\nconference materials were retrieved. After\ninputting the search limits (Title/Abstract,\nAfter excluding articles on primary atrophic\nrhinitis, 29 publications remained. Finally,\nafter excluding reviews and case reports, six\narticles on ENS implantation remained. We\nanalyzed these studies and used the SNOT\nto compare the preoperative versus post-\noperative outcomes of patients with ENS.\nSix publications involving 122 patients were\n(Figure 1). Of these, two studies were\nRCTs and four were non-RCTs (Table 1).\nWe found that the overall kappa statistic\ngroup and other countries group was 0.47\nIn the forest plot of the SNOT scores, the\nstandardized mean difference for AGs\n(Figure 3b), indicating that the treatment\neffects of AGs were superior to those of\nFigure 1.

As shown in\nFigure 3a, Figure 3b, and Figure 3c, the\npreoperative and postoperative SNOT\nscores were obtained in all six clinical studies\ninvolving implantation of AGs and FGs in\npatients with ENS. Our meta-analysis was\ncarried out according to the sample sizes of\nthe patients, and the results showed statis-\ntical significance with an interval variance of\ndifference was observed in the preoperative\nand postoperative SNOT scores between the\ndifferent implant groups (P < 0.05). There\nwas also a significant difference between\nthe preoperative and postoperative SNOT\nscores for the different implants. In the\nsubgroup analysis of the implant materials,\nthere was a significant difference between\nAG and FG (P < 0.05). With respect to the\ncountry subgroups, there was a significant\ndifference in the effects of the China group\nversus the other countries group (P < 0.05).\nThese results indicate that AGs are superior\nto FGs based on SNOT outcomes.\nemployed to examine the pooled values from\nfive or more studies. The results indicated no\npublication bias in any of the analyzed data.\nA sensitivity analysis (Figure 2a and Figure 2b)\nwas conducted for the pooled results by\nconverting the pooled model (fixed-effects\nmodel). The implant materials and country\nsubgroups exhibited large differences in the\nRRs and 95% CIs before and after surgery,\nindicating instability in the pooled values for\nthese two subgroups (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIn this meta-analysis, all patients reported\nthat their subjective symptoms were\nTable 1.

We found a significant difference\nbetween the preoperative and postoperative\nSNOT scores in the different implants\n(P < 0.05). In the subgroup analyses based\non implant materials, there was a significant\ndifference in AG and FG (P < 0.05); we also\nfound a significant difference between the\nChina group and the other countries group\n(P < 0.05). The results of these subgroup\nanalyses indicate that AGs are superior to\nFGs. We found that a greater number of\npatients with ENS in China than in other\ncountries were treated by surgical implant\ntherapy.\nENS is a rare rhinologic disorder that\ntypically develops many years after sinonasal\nsurgery, most notably turbinate surgery.18\nEffective treatment is necessary for patients\nwith ENS. All patients with ENS in the\npresent meta-analysis had undergone a pre-\nvious inferior turbinectomy. This meta-ana-\nlysis included six trials reporting the\npostsurgical outcomes in patients with ENS\nwho were treated with different implants.\nBesides the preoperative and postoperative\nSNOT scores, the following factors were also\nconsidered: implant material, country of\norigin, and follow-up duration. The results\nof these subanalyses provide evidence-based\npractices for such surgeries and were statis-\ntically significant with an interval variance of\nwith ENS experienced significant\nFigure 2.

The results of the\nsubgroup analysis indicated that there was a\nsignificant difference between AGs and FGs\nafter surgery (P < 0.05) (Figure 3b). We also\nfound a significant difference between China\nand other countries (P < 0.05) (Figure 3c). In\none previous study, patients with silastic\nimplants and acellular dermis grafts showed\nmarked subjective and objective improve-\nments.2 In the comparison of the SNOT\noutcomes between AGs and FGs, the sum-\nmary effect measures were estimated by a\nfixed-effects model. The I2 measure of het-\nerogeneity for AGs was \u00bc 0%, while that for\nFGs was 34%, suggesting little heterogeneity\nbetween the preoperative and postoperative\nSNOT scores among the studies. The present\nmeta-analysis demonstrated that the SNOT\ncan be used as a comprehensive assessment\ntool to aid in the evaluation of the effects of\nturbinate reconstruction surgery in patients\nwith ENS, and the SNOT score can serve\nas a comparative parameter before and\nafter surgery. Clinical diagnosis of ENS is\ndifficult because no reliable objective tests are\navailable; hence, the otolaryngologist must\nrely on the patient's subjective symptoms.3\nSome studies have indicated that sub-\nmucosal implantation of Medpor (Stryker)\nis a feasible surgical treatment for ENS.12\nOther studies have shown that endonasal\nmicroplasty by submucosal implantation of\ncartilage may be a useful treatment option in\nthe management of ENS.19\nOur results have potential implications\nfor clinical practice and health policies\nregarding ENS. The SNOT scores were\nsignificantly different from the preoperative\nscores as shown by an interval variance\nAlthough based on only six clinical trials, the\ncurrent findings indicate that the symptoms\nof ENS were alleviated after the implant-\nation surgery; furthermore, there was differ-\nence between AGs and FGs. We consider\nthat ENS should not be overlooked, espe-\ncially because it can severely affect certain\npatients whose only presenting complaint\nis nasal obstruction.20 The aim of treatment\nis to increase the nasal airway resistance\nby narrowing the nasal valve region or\nTable 2.

Modrzynski21 reported that\nhyaluronic acid injections appear to be worth\nconsidering in less severe forms of ENS.\nGraft material implanted below the\nmucosa is a practical choice to reconstruct\nthe deficient anatomy in patients with ENS.22\nComputational fluid dynamic studies of nasal\naerodynamics may have a role in planning\nthe placement and quantity of implants for\nprediction of neonasal airflow in patients\nwith ENS.23 Nevertheless, surgeons must\nemploy a realistic but empathetic approach\nthat takes the current evidence regarding\nsurgical intervention into consideration.\nFuture studies are needed to establish the\nefficacy and safety of the implant approach.\nIn this meta-analysis of randomized\nobservational studies, the heterogeneity of\nthe studies was estimated using the I2 test as\nshown in Figure 2a and Figure 2b. We\nfound a low degree of heterogeneity among\nthe studies, indicating reliability of our\nresults. One limitation of our study is the\nSNOT 25 comprise slightly different evalu-\nation items; however, these differences did\nnot affect the assessment of ENS symptoms\nby the meta-analysis. A second potential\nlimitation involves the fact that only six\nstudies were included and that the sample\nsize was small after application of the\nrigorous inclusion criteria and review pro-\ncedures. This limitation is associated with a\nhigh risk of false-positive results. Third, the\nmeta-analyses was performed to compare\nsubjective symptoms, not objective symp-\ntoms. Overall, evaluation of the efficacy of\nAGs versus FGs in patients with ENS by a\nmeta-analysis is clinically useful. The results\nare expected to be helpful for patients and\ndoctors in the clinical setting. Because we\ndemonstrated the superiority of AGs over\nFGs based on a meta-analysis, we speculate\nwhether this justifies a change in the opera-\ntive treatments of patients with ENS in the\nfuture.\nConclusion\nThe present meta-analysis suggests that\nsurgery can improve the symptoms and\nSNOT scores of patients with ENS. The\nresults also indicate that AGs are more\neffective than FGs in patients with ENS\nand that patients from China undergo sur-\ngical implant therapy more frequently than\ndo patients from other countries.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict\nof interest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Nature\nReferences\n1.
