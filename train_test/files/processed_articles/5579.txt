For Hispanics or Latinos, the\nfollowing age-adjusted prevalence estimates from\nthe National Health Interview Survey/National\nCenter for Health Statistics were given for diag-\nnosed conditions in people aged 18 years in\nheart disease, 5.8% had coronary heart disease,\nand 2.0% have had a stroke.\nCurrent hypertension guidelines state that the\nmajority of patients will require combination\ntherapy with at least two antihypertensive medi-\ncations to achieve BP control [Chobanian et al.\nhypertension, fixed-dose combination therapy\nwith two or more medications can simplify the\ntreatment regimen and potentially improve adher-\nDespite the availability of effective antihyperten-\nsive treatments and clear guidelines for the treat-\nment of hypertension, ethnic minorities are often\nnot treated appropriately to achieve BP goals;\nstudies have shown that racial/ethnic differences\nin many aspects of hypertension are mainly due\nto social and environmental factors [Thorpe et al.\n2008]. Barriers to achieving hypertension control\nin patients of all races include non-adherence to\ntherapy, lack of awareness (though awareness is\nimproving), lack of access to treatment, and clini-\ncal inertia (failure to intensify treatment) [Weinick\nThe Blood Pressure Control in All Subgroups\nWith Hypertension (BP-CRUSH) study evalu-\nated improvement in BP goal achievement after\npatients whose BP was uncontrolled on previous\nantihypertensive monotherapy were switched to\nfixed-dose amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil\n(AML/OM) with or without hydrochlorothiazide\n(HCTZ) combination therapy [Weir et al. 2011].\nA subgroup analysis of BP reductions and goal\nachievement in Hispanic and non-Hispanic\npatients is reported here.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis was a prespecified subgroup analysis of\nHispanic and non-Hispanic patients enrolled in\nthe BP-CRUSH study [ClinicalTrials.gov identi-\nAfrica), prospective, multicenter, open-label, sin-\ngle-arm, dose-titration study with a 20-week active\ntreatment period. The results of the 20-week\nactive treatment period, including study popula-\ntion demographics, inclusion and exclusion cri-\nteria, study design, efficacy and safety variables,\nand statistical analyses for the total cohort, are\nPatients with hypertension whose condition was\nuncontrolled on monotherapy after 1 month of\ntreatment were screened for study eligibility. Full\nstudy inclusion/exclusion criteria have been\ndescribed previously [Weir et al. 2011]. Briefly,\nthe study inclusion criteria included uncontrolled\nBP [mean systolic BP (SBP) 140 mmHg (or\n130 mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus)\nand 180 mmHg and mean diastolic BP (DBP)\n110 mmHg on two consecutive visits during\nscreening] after at least 1 month of antihyperten-\nsive monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting\nenzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker,\n blocker, calcium channel blocker (CCB), or\ndiuretic. On day 1, eligible patients were switched\nfrom their previous antihypertensive monother-\napy to a fixed-dose combination of AML/OM\n5/20 mg. Active treatment was administered once\ndaily each morning. Uptitration was permitted\nevery 4 weeks according to the following schedule\n(Figure 1): uptitration to AML/OM 5/40 mg,\n+ HCTZ 25 mg. Patients were eligible to be upti-\ntrated to any AML/OM combination dose if their\nH Punzi, A Shojaee et al.\nmmHg, or if their mean DBP was at least 70 and\nless than 115 mmHg. Patients were eligible to be\nuptitrated to any dose including an HCTZ add\non if their mean SBP was at least 125 and less\nthan 200 mmHg, or if their mean DBP was at\nadequately controlled BP were maintained at\ntheir titrated drug dose level. However, if BP\nbecame uncontrolled during the maintenance\nthen patients were uptitrated to the next dosage\nlevel and re-entered the titration phase of the\nstudy. Patients receiving AML/OM 10/40 mg\n(\u00b1HCTZ) who achieved a mean SBP of less than\nmmHg, and who were asymptomatic for hypoten-\nsion, entered maintenance treatment and contin-\nued in the study at their current dosage level.\nPatients with a mean SBP of at least 200 mmHg\nor DBP of at least 115 mmHg at any visit exited\nthe study, as did patients with either an SBP of\nmmHg with symptomatic hypotension.\nStudy assessments\nThe primary efficacy endpoint for the main study\n(and for this subgroup analysis) was the cumula-\ntive proportion of patients achieving the seated\ncuff SBP (SeSBP) goal of less than 140 mmHg\n(or <130 mmHg in patients with diabetes) during\nthe first 12 weeks of active treatment.\nSecondary endpoints included the proportion of\npatients achieving the SeSBP goal of less than\ndiabetes) at the last post-baseline visit at or prior\nto week 12 [last observation carried forward\n(LOCF)]; the cumulative proportion of patients\nachieving the seated cuff BP (SeBP) goal of less\npatients with diabetes) from baseline to weeks 12\nand 20; and the change from baseline in mean\nSeSBP and seated cuff DBP (SeDBP) by titration\ndose (LOCF). A cumulative approach to measur-\ning the proportion of patients achieving the BP\ngoal was used because BP is a dynamic variable\nand patients with hypertension achieve the BP\ngoal at different time points during any clinical\nassessment period just as would be observed in a\nreal-world setting. Consequently, this method\nwas chosen rather than reporting BP goal rate for\njust one office visit which would not provide a\ncomprehensive view of BP goal achievement over\nthe course of treatment.\nIn the ambulatory BP (ABP) subgroup, endpoints\nincluded the proportion of patients achieving com-\nbined ABP monitoring (ABPM) targets at weeks\n12 and 20, using the American Heart Association\nmmHg for mean daytime (8 am\u00ad4 pm) ABP, and\n[Pickering et al. 2005], and the change from base-\nline in mean ambulatory SBP and DBP, including\nmean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime BP, and change\nin mean SBP and DBP during the last 2, 4, and 6\nh of the dosing interval at weeks 12 and 20.\nSafety assessments included the evaluation of\nadverse events, laboratory parameters, and phys-\nical examinations.\nFigure 1.

The ABPM subgroup included all treated\npatients with a valid baseline measurement and\nThe cumulative SeBP goal achievement rate by\nvisit was calculated as the ratio of the number of\npatients who achieved the goal at any time from\nthe first dose date to the visit date over the num-\nber of patients who had any post-baseline BP data\nby that visit. These continuous efficacy variables\nwere summarized with their corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals. Changes in SeBP and ABP\nfrom baseline were summarized by titration dose\n(LOCF method) and by visit without the LOCF\nmethod. The one-sample paired t test was used\nto test for significance, and all statistical analyses\nwere performed at a two-sided significance level\nResults\nStudy disposition, demographics, and\nbaseline characteristics\nOut of a total of 1406 patients who were screened,\npatients were of Hispanic ethnicity and 894 were\nnon-Hispanic.

Data have\nshown that the morning surge in BP resulting\nfrom variations in the circadian rhythm of BP is\nassociated with an increased risk of cardiovascu-\nlar events, particularly during the first 2 h after\nawakening [Gosse et al. 2004].Thus, agents that\nprovide 24 h BP control play an important role\nin potentially reducing cardiovascular events\nand improving outcomes.

Mean 24 h,\ndaytime, and nighttime ABP target rates achieved\nat week 12 were similar in Hispanic and non-\nHispanic patients, with higher proportions of\nHispanic patients achieving these same targets;\nhowever, greater proportions of non-Hispanic\npatients had achieved these ABP targets compared\nwith the Hispanic subgroup at week 20. It should\nbe noted that the number of Hispanic patients who\nunderwent ABPM was small at 44.This may be one\npossible explanation for the discrepancy observed\nin week 12 and week 20 ABP target achievement\nrates in Hispanic patients. Overall, mean SeBP and\nmean 24 h, daytime, and nighttime ABP, and ABP\nmeasured in the last 2, 4, and 6 h of the dosing\ninterval were all significantly reduced from baseline\nFixed-dose combination therapy with AML/OM,\nwith or without HCTZ, was well tolerated in this\npatient population; no new safety issues were\nobserved.The incidence of peripheral edema that\nhas been previously associated with CCB therapy\nwas expectedly highest in both the Hispanic and\nnon-Hispanic groups for the AML/OM combina-\ntion. The addition of HCTZ decreased its inci-\ndence in both cohorts, which was also reflected in\nthe decreased incidence of drug-related TEAEs\nreported for the AML/OM + HCTZ treatment\nTable 2.

Thus, these data support previous obser-\nvations that the incorporation of a thiazide diu-\nretic into a high-dose AML regimen can help to\nreduce the incidence of edema. Although not\nsubject to statistical analysis, the incidence of\ndrug-related TEAEs appeared to be lower in\nHispanic patients compared with the non-Hispanic\npopulation. Taken together, these data support\nthe utility of an AML/OM-based titration regimen\nin providing well tolerated, 24 h BP control in\nHispanic patients with hypertension uncontrolled\non previous monotherapy.\nAlthough guidelines advise that the use of at least\ntwo antihypertensive agents will be necessary for\nmost patients to achieve BP goals in the seventh\nreport of the Joint National Committee on\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment\nof High Blood Pressure and in European guide-\n2009], this aspect of the guidelines is often not\nwell translated into clinical practice [Spranger\net al. 2004]. In addition to lack of awareness,\nlack of access to treatment, and clinical inertia\n[Cushman and Basile, 2006; Basile and Neutel,\n2010], a main barrier to BP goal achievement\nis patient non-adherence to treatment, which is\nknown to be associated with increasing pill burden\n[Bangalore et al. 2007]. The development of\nfixed-dose combinations such as AML/OM help\ndecrease pill burden, thereby potentially increasing\npatient adherence to treatment and the likelihood\nof BP goal achievement [Bangalore et al. 2007].\nTreating to BP goal is important for all patients,\nregardless of their ethnicity/race, in order to min-\nimize adverse cardiovascular events [Chobanian\net al. 2003]. Analyses such as ours demonstrate\nthat high rates of BP control are achievable in\nHispanic patients; however, the difficulties lie in\ntranslating goal rates achieved in clinical trials to\nthe real-world clinical setting [Singer et al. 2002;\nCushman and Basile, 2006].Treat-to-goal strate-\ngies for hypertension management and initiatives\nto improve awareness and treatment of hyperten-\nsion have been shown to reduce the ethnic/racial\ndisparities in hypertension control by eliminating\nsome of the previously discussed barriers to BP\nLimitations of this subgroup analysis include the\nopen-label, single-arm design, possibly resulting\nin treatment bias due to lack of blinding. For the\nABP data analysis, the number of patients in the\nHispanic subgroup was relatively small, and thus\nthese results need to be assessed with caution if\nextrapolating to similar populations seen in the\nclinical setting due to low statistical power. In\naddition, potential gender effects on antihyper-\ntensive efficacy were not assessed in this study\nand it would be interesting to evaluate the effect\nof gender in combination with ethnicity in future\nstudies. The strengths of this subgroup analysis\nwere that it was prespecified in the study protocol\nand that it provides efficacy and safety data in a\nsubgroup of patients that is often under-reported\nin the literature.\nConclusions\nThis prespecified subgroup analysis showed that\nswitching to a fixed-dose combination of AML/\nOM \u00b1 HCTZ provided significant BP lowering\nand effectively controlled BP to achieve SeSBP\nand SeBP targets, as well as mean 24 h, daytime,\nand nighttime ABP targets in a large proportion of\nboth Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients with\nhypertension whose condition was previously\nuncontrolled on antihypertensive monotherapy.\nIn addition to achieving SeBP goals and 24 h ABP\ntargets, the AML/OM \u00b1 HCTZ combination\ntherapy regimen was well tolerated in both\nHispanic and non-Hispanic patients.\n"
