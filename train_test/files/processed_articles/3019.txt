Four mod-\nels were compared: a 1-factor model, a 2-factor model\nin which some disorders represented internalizing prob-\nlems and others represented externalizing problems, a\n3-factor variant of the 2-factor model in which internal-\nizing was modeled as having 2 subfactors (anxious-\nmisery and fear), and a 4-factor model in which the\ndisorders represented separate affective, anxiety, sub-\nstance dependence, and antisocial factors.\nResults: The 3-factor model provided the best fit in the\nentire sample. This result was replicated across random\nhalves of the sample as well as across women and men.\nThe substantial empirical intercorrelation between anx-\nious-misery and fear (0.73) suggested that these factors\nwere most appropriately conceived as subfactors of a\nhigher-order internalizing factor.

The results thereby argue for focusing research\non these core processes themselves, rather than on their\nvaried manifestations as separate disorders.\nCOMORBIDITY among men-\ntal disorders is com-\nmonly observed in both\nclinical and epidemiologi-\ncal samples.1-5 The robust-\nness of this observation is rarely ques-\ntioned; however, what is at issue is its\nmeaning.

Rather than conceiving of com-\nmon mental disorders as discrete, dichotomous entities,\nthese disorders are conceived as extreme points on con-\ntinua that span a range of emotional and behavioral func-\ntioning. This dimensional conception brings the robust\nempirical data on comorbidity into sharper resolution.\nIf such continua underlie multiple common mental dis-\norders, these disorders should show strong patterns of\ncovariance (ie, comorbidity).\nIn the current research, diagnoses of major depres-\nsive episode (MDE), dysthymia (DYS), panic disorder\n(PD), agoraphobia (AGPH), social phobia (SOP), simple\nphobia (SIP), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), alco-\nhol dependence (AD), drug dependence (DD), and an-\ntisocial personality disorder (APD) were submitted to con-\nfirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a formal statistical means\nof evaluating dimensional accounts of comorbidity among\nmental disorders. Four competing models, positing from\n1 to 4 latent factors, were evaluated to determine their\nfit in the entire NCS sample, in random halves of the\nsample, in the male and female halves of the sample, and\nin a subsample of persons in treatment for mental dis-\norder.\nRESULTS\nTetrachoric correlations among the 10 lifetime mental\ndisorders were computed, along with their SEs\n(Table 1).

Informed consent was obtained from all partici-\npants and also from the parents of minor participants. The\ndata were weighted to adjust for nonresponse, to adjust for\nvariation in probability of selection within and between\nhouseholds, and to approximate the distribution of major\ndemographic variables in the US population. Results from\nthe NCS have been covered extensively in the ARCHIVES and\nelsewhere7; these previous publications may be consulted\nfor further details about the NCS.\nThe analyses in this report focused on lifetime diagnoses\nin the NCS, which were based on DSM-III-R9 criteria. In\naccordance with standard practice in psychiatric epidemi-\nology, the diagnoses examined were made without the im-\nposition of hierarchical exclusionary rules.7,10 Interviews\nwere conducted by trained nonclinician interviewers us-\ning a modified version of the World Health Organization\nComposite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI): the\nUniversity of Michigan CIDI. Acceptable reliability and va-\nlidity data have been obtained for the CIDI11 and the Uni-\nThe NCS diagnostic data were analyzed via CFA. Briefly,\nCFA is a means of explaining the correlations (ie, patterns\nof comorbidity) among variables (ie, DSM-III-R mental dis-\norders) by postulating that these correlations arose\nbecause of the influence of a smaller number of underly-\ning, latent dimensions. Specifically, the computer program\nPRELIS (version 2.20; Scientific Software International Inc,\nLincolnwood, Ill) was used to create tetrachoric correlation\nmatrices and asymptotic covariance matrices from the NCS\nlifetime diagnostic variables. Tetrachoric correlations are\nappropriateindicesofassociationwhenoneadoptsaliability-\nthreshold model for the disorders of interest--a model\nappropriate for common mental disorders.14\nMy analyses focused on a subset of the DSM-III-R dis-\norders assessed in the NCS. To ensure reliable, stable es-\ntimates of interrelationships among disorders, the lowest\nbase rate disorders (ie, nonaffective psychosis and mania)\nwere excluded. Clinical reappraisal studies in the NCS have\ndocumented the low prevalence (1%) of verifiable cases\nof these disorders.7,15 With rare disorders, the confidence\nintervals surrounding correlations estimated between these\ndisorders and other disorders become unacceptably large,\napproaching the size of the correlations themselves (analy-\nses verifying this in the NCS can be obtained from the author\non request). Alcohol abuse, drug abuse, panic attack, adult\nantisocial behavior, and conduct disorder were excluded\nbecause their more severe variants (AD, DD, PD, and APD)\nwere included. In addition, posttraumatic stress disorder\nwas excluded because this disorder requires the occur-\nrence of an event external to the person and is therefore a\nless meaningful indicator of a latent, endogenous \"core psy-\nchopathological process\" and because this disorder was only\nassessed for a subset of the total NCS sample.16 The life-\ntime disorders remaining after these exclusions were made--\nwere submitted to CFA.\nFour competing models were evaluated. First, a 1-fac-\ntor model was evaluated in which all disorders were pre-\nsumed to be indicators of a single, unitary propensity to\nexperiencecommonmentaldisorders.17 Althoughthismodel\nmay at first seem far-fetched, overall severity of maladjust-\nment has been recognized by the DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and\nDSM-IV, but is recorded on the fifth axis as the Global\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nence these common mental disorders correlated, they\nare systematically correlated. Specifically, the liabilities\nto experience affective and anxiety disorders are highly\ncorrelated, the liabilities to experience substance disor-\nders and APD are highly correlated, and the correlations\nbetween these two broad domains are smaller. Also, the\nSEs for these correlations are relatively small. It is rea-\nsonably certain that these correlations present an accu-\nrate representation of the structure of lifetime mental\ndisorders in the US population as they were accurately\nestimated in the NCS sample, which was painstakingly\ndesigned to represent the US population.\nFit indices were computed for the 4 potential dimen-\nsional models in the entire sample (Table 2). Looking\nacross the 3 fit indices, a compelling argument can be\nmade for the superior fit of the 3-factor model. The 3-fac-\ntor model achieved the only negative BIC value and was\nsuperior to the other models at reproducing the ob-\nserved sample correlations (RMR, 0.06).\nExaminationofthestandardizedparameterestimates\nfromthe3-factormodelrevealedahighcorrelation(0.73)\nbetweentheanxious-miseryandfearfactors.Thesizeofthis\ncorrelationsuggestedthatbothanxious-miseryandfearare\nsubfactorsofahigher-orderinternalizingfactor.The3-factor\nmodel was therefore reparameterized by defining fear and\nanxious-miseryaslatentindicatorsofahigher-orderinter-\nnalizingfactor(Figure).Thehigher-orderinternalizingfac-\ntor in the Figure is simply an alternate way of expressing\nthe0.73correlationbetweenanxious-miseryandfear--one\ncantracethroughthepathsconnectingthesefactorstore-\ncover their correlation in the original 3-factor model (ie,\ninternalizing factor in the Figure had very large loadings\ningful way to express the 3-factor model.\nThe SEs for the parameters in this model (Figure)\n(P.05 for all).

These labels highlight a novel finding: GAD has\nAssessment of Functioning score (as opposed to being of-\nfered as an account of comorbidity among Axis I disor-\nders). Second, a 2-factor model was evaluated in which af-\nfective and anxiety disorders were presumed to reflect\ninternalizing problems, and alcohol/drug dependence and\nantisocial personality to reflect externalizing problems. This\nmodel was inspired by reports on childhood behavioral and\nemotional problems, which consistently show a concep-\ntually similar 2-factor pattern.18,19 Third, a 3-factor variant\nof the 2-factor model was evaluated. Initial exploratory fac-\ntor analyses of the NCS data suggested that the internaliz-\ning factor has 2 highly correlated subfactors: an anxious-\nmisery factor formed by MDE, DYS, and GAD and a fear\nfactor formed by PD, AGPH, SOP, and SIP. The external-\nizing factor in this model remains as it was in the 2-factor\nmodel (ie, a factor indicated by AD, DD, and APD). Fi-\nnally,a4-factormodelinspiredbytheorganizationalschemes\nof recent DSMs and by current trends in research special-\nization was evaluated. In this model, MDE and DYS formed\nan affective disorders factor; GAD, PD, AGPH, SOP, and SIP\nformed an anxiety disorders factor; AD and DD formed a sub-\nstance dependence disorders factor; and APD formed an an-\ntisocial behavior disorder factor.\nThemodelswereexaminedintheentiresample,inran-\ndomhalvesofthesample,inbothsexes,andwithinatreatment-\nseeking subsample, identified as follows.

The model parameters were estimated using\nweighed least squares, a procedure that requires the afore-\nmentioned asymptotic covariance matrices. The weighted\nleast squares procedure is appropriate for the analysis of\npatterns of comorbidity among common mental disorders\nbecause, unlike other fit functions (such as maximum like-\nlihood), it does not assume that the measured variables\n(ie, mental disorders) have a joint multivariate normal dis-\ntribution in the population. The fit of the models was evalu-\nated using multiple fit indices: the 2 goodness of fit sta-\ntistic, the root mean residual (RMR), and the Bayesian\ninformation criterion (BIC). Each of these indices is com-\nmonly reported in CFA analyses, and each provides a\ncomplementary perspective on the fit of a CFA model.\nBriefly, the 2 value for a model indexes the discrepancy\nbetween the model-estimated and sample-derived correla-\ntions; smaller 2 values result from better-fitting models.\nThe RMR indexes how far off the model-estimated corre-\nlations are from sample-derived correlations (on average)\nand hence should be small for well-fitting models. Finally,\nthe BIC deserves special mention in the current context, as\nit has been very useful in balancing fit and parsimony con-\nsiderations in large samples (such as the NCS).20 Because\nmodels with more parameters make weaker claims about the\nstructure of the data, simply including more parameters can\ntypically reduce the 2 value for a model.

Another notable finding is that\nthe factor loadings in the Figure are uniformly large; each\ndisorder is a reliable indicator of its corresponding factor.\nTo alleviate concerns that these findings were spe-\ncific to lifetime disorders, the models were refitted us-\ning past-year diagnoses in place of lifetime diagnoses (with\nthe exception of APD, which was assessed only on a life-\ntime basis). The 3-factor model was also the best-fitting\nmodel when past-year diagnoses were used.

For the entire\nNCS sample, across sexes, and across random halves, a\n3-factor model provided the best fit to the correlations\namong the 10 disorders. Because of the high correlation\nbetween the anxious-misery and fear factors in the 3-fac-\ntor model (0.73), these factors were meaningfully ex-\npressed as subfactors of a higher-order internalizing fac-\ntor. However, in a treatment-seeking subsample, the\n2-factor model provided the best fit. Thus, at the high-\nest level of the factor hierarchy, a broad internalizing fac-\ntor (with anxious-misery and fear subfactors) and a broad\nexternalizing factor explained the pattern of correla-\ntions among liabilities to experience common mental dis-\norders. Within a treatment-seeking sample, however, it\nwas not possible to recover the subfactors of internaliza-\ntion.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of the study should\nbe kept in mind when interpreting these results. The NCS\nsample is a strength because of its large size and repre-\nsentativeness; results from this study can be safely gen-\neralized to the population of US adults and its subcom-\nponents (ie, men, women, and people who seek\ntreatment). This extends and replicates my prior work\non the 2-factor structure of common mental disorders,6\nwhich was limited to people in late adolescence and did\nnot examine replicability across sex and treatment-\nseeking status.\nNevertheless, two weaknesses are notable. First,\ninterviews in the NCS were administered by nonclinicians,\nand supplementary information, such as informant re-\nports, was not used in making the diagnoses. Examina-\ntion of the factor structure of common mental disorders\nwhen clinicians make diagnoses using all available in-\nformation is an important goal for future research. Sec-\nond, the NCS study was cross-sectional, and hence, of\nnecessity, retrospective reports were relied on when life-\ntime diagnoses were made. Although logistically daunt-\ning in terms of time and expense, fine-grained longitu-\ndinal studies of the experience of common mental\ndisorders and their symptoms in large, representative\nsamples would be valuable in refining our current no-\nsological understanding.\nIn spite of these concerns, the value of the study rests\non the utility and generativity of the structural model in\nthe Figure. Evidence that the model helps to organize ob-\nservations and suggest directions for future research comes\nfrom three domains: psychiatric epidemiology, psycho-\npharmacology, and psychiatric genetics. First, the model\norganizeskeyfindingsfrompsychiatricepidemiology.One\nkey finding is that common mental disorders exhibit con-\nsistently positive intercorrelations (ie, comorbidity) that\nvary in magnitude (ie, rate of comorbidity) (Table 1).\nRather than viewing these correlations as nuisance co-\nvariance, the model in the Figure renders them psycho-\nlogically sensible. The model organizes common psy-\nchopathological variance into internalizing patterns, such\nas pervasive anxiety and sadness (anxious-misery) and\nphobic avoidance of others and the external world (fear)\nas well as externalizing patterns involving antisocial be-\nhaviors (APD) and lifestyles (AD, DD). Psychologically\nspeaking, the model suggests that maladjustment can be\nexpressed primarily inward, as anxious-misery and/or fear,\nor primarily outward, as antisocial, disruptive behavior.\nAnother key finding from psychiatric epidemiol-\nogy is the positive association between comorbidity and\nseverity of psychopathological dysfunction; that is, the\nseverity of a disorder predicts not only its intensity and\nlongevity, but also the likelihood of meeting criteria for\nother disorders.1 The model in the Figure also renders\nthis finding sensible. If multiple mental disorders are in-\ndicators of a finite number of latent, continuous factors,\nthose mental disorders should be correlated (ie, they\nshould be comorbid).\nSecond, the model predicts the observed effective-\nness of similar pharmacological interventions for puta-\ntively different common mental disorders. For example,\nthe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), al-\nthough initially regarded as antidepressants, have been\nfound to be effective in treating other internalizing con-\nditions, such as PD21 and DYS.22 Indeed, the SSRIs are\nnow being marketed as treatments for diverse internal-\nizing conditions. The SSRIs may be effective in treating\nall these conditions because they influence a core inter-\nnalizing process--perhaps the personality trait of neu-\nroticism/negativeemotionality,whichhasalsobeenshown\nto be reduced by SSRI administration.23,24\nThird, consider research on the genetic etiology of\ncommon mental disorders. Internalizing disorders share\ngenetic variance. As predicted by the model in the Fig-\nure, MDE and GAD are closely linked,25,26 PD and the pho-\nbias are closely linked,27 and MDE and the phobias, al-\nthough significantly linked, are linked to a lesser degree.28\nIn addition, APD and substance use disorders share sig-\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association.

These three lines of evidence from psy-\nchiatric epidemiology, psychopharmacology, and psy-\nchiatric genetics support the utility of the model in the\nFigure. Considered together, they make a strong case for\nrefocusing the study of common mental disorders on their\ncommon substrates: broad, higher-order internalizing and\nexternalizing dimensions.\nThe National Cormobidity Survey is funded by grants\nInstitute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Md, with supplemen-\ntional Institute on Drug Abuse, Bethesda, and by grant\nReprints:  , Department of Psy-\nchology, University of Minnesota, 75 E River Rd, Minne-\nREFERENCES\n1.
