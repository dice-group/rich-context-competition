At one extreme of the\ndistribution, early-morning (EM) people typically go to bed early in the evening and get up\nearly in the morning; they usually exhibit optimal cognitive performance early in the\nmorning, and do not function effectively in the evening. In contrast, night-owls (NO) go to\nThe evolution of eveningness\nsleep late in the evening and wake up late in the morning; they perform better in the\nevening or at night and have trouble functioning in the morning (e.g., Horne, Brass, and\nBuela-Casal, 1994, for reviews). Although many people easily self-identify as having one\nsleep pattern or the other, others fall in between the EM and the NO extremes and do not\nappear to have a clear sleep pattern or preference. Individual differences in\nmorningness/eveningness (also known as chronotype) are generally stable over time and\nshow a moderate degree of heritability (h2 = 0.45; Hur, 2007; Hur, Bouchard, and Lykken,\n1998; Klei et al., 2005). Environmental factors (e.g., geographic and seasonal variation,\nwork schedule), however, also make important contributions to variation in sleep pattern\nOne of the most consistently reported findings concerning individual variation in\nsleep pattern involves sex differences. Men sleep, on average, for fewer hours than women\nat any age, and at around the time of puberty (children tend to have the early-morning sleep\npattern) men also begin to show a greater tendency to be night-owls than women (Adan and\nsleep pattern persists into adulthood, but becomes weaker or disappears after women reach\nmenopause (Randler, 2007; Randler and Bausback, 2010). The sex difference in sleep\npattern is accompanied by differences in some physiological variables. For example,\nmelatonin levels in women peak earlier at night than in men (Gibertini, Graham, and Cook,\nconductance peaks earlier in the day in EM than in NO types (Wilson, 1990), whereas\ncortisol levels peak about 1 hour earlier in EM than in NO types, and the amplitude of the\ncortisol rhythm is smaller and more flattened in NO than in EM types (Bailey and\nHeitkemper, 2001; see also Rosenberg, Maximov, Reske, Grinberg, and Shah, 2014, for\ndifferences in brain function).\nThe sex difference in sleep pattern (but not in sleep amount) and its relation to\npuberty and menopause led Piffer (2010) to propose a hypothetical scenario for the\nevolution of the night-owl pattern. Specifically, he speculated that since humans evolved\nfrom diurnal primate ancestors, morningness was probably the ancestral evolutionary\ncondition for our species (see also Kanazawa and Perina, 2009), whereas eveningness may\nrepresent a relatively new trait that evolved due to its mating-associated fitness benefits.\nIncreased safety from predation and other ecological dangers during early human evolution\nmay have increased opportunities to engage in social and mating activities in the late\nevening hours, when adults are less burdened by work or child-rearing. Individuals \u00ad both\nmale and female \u00ad with a new genetic predisposition for eveningness presumably benefited\nmore from these new social and mating opportunities, particularly if these individuals were\nnot permanently pair-bonded, or if they were pair-bonded but engaged in extra-pair mating.\nIn this scenario, NO males had a higher reproductive success than EM males, thus a genetic\npredisposition for eveningness gradually became more and more prevalent in the male\npopulation (EM males, however, continued to reproduce successfully, e.g., in the context of\nlong-term pair-bonds with faithful EM females). Finally, since eveningness increased the\nfitness of men more than the fitness of women, eveningness became a sexually dimorphic\ntrait, being more prevalent in men than in women. In a series of studies inspired by this\nhypothetical evolutionary scenario, Piffer and collaborators reported that in men,\nThe evolution of eveningness\neveningness (but not average sleep duration) was positively associated with number of\nsexual partners (Gunawardane, Piffer, and Custance, 2011; Piffer, 2010; Randler et al.,\nRegardless of whether or not individual differences in sleep patterns are associated\nwith variation in mating success in contemporary human societies, a question may arise as\nto whether eveningness is associated with behavioral or psychological traits that favor\nshort-term mating strategies. This is because different traits promoting short-term mating\nstrategies are likely to evolve in clusters rather than independently from one another. One\nobvious candidate is personality. Extraversion is a personality dimension that is generally\nlinked with higher short-term mating success (Nettle, 2005; Randler et al., 2012a), and\nseveral studies have reported that NO people are generally more extraverted than EM\nFabbri, and Natale, 2009). Moreover, personality studies have reported that eveningness is\nalso associated with higher impulsivity and novelty-seeking (e.g., Caci, Robert, and Boyer,\nMachiavellism (Jonason, Jones, and Lyons, 2013), which is also consistent with the\nhypothesized functional significance of this trait for short-term mating strategies.\nBesides personality, two additional traits that favor short-term mating, and should\ntherefore be associated with eveningness, are risk-taking and short-term relationship-\norientation (i.e. the propensity to be single or to engage in short-term romantic\nrelationships) (e.g., Baker and Maner, 2008; Kelly and Dunbar, 2001). There is no previous\nresearch on chronotype and relationship orientation, and so far only one study has\ninvestigated the relationship between sleep pattern and risk-taking. In this study, Killgore\n(2007) examined different measures of risk-taking (Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale,\nEvaluation of Risks Scale, and the Balloon Analog Risk Task) in a sample of 54 young\nadults (29 male, 25 female) who were subdivided by a median split into an Evening (n =\n28) and a Morning (n = 26) group based on self-reported sleep patterns and preferences. He\nreported that Evening types scored higher than Morning types on the BSS scale and in\nTotal Risk-Taking Propensity (a cumulative Index obtained by combining all the items in\nthe ER Scale), but there were no differences in the behavioral Balloon test. Sex differences\nin risk-taking and their possible interaction with chronotype were not considered in this\nstudy. Moreover, it was not clear how men and women were distributed into the Evening\nand Morning groups after the median split of the subject population. This is problematic\nbecause men generally score higher than in women in all measures of risk-taking (e.g.,\nByrnes, Miller, and Schafer, 1999; Figner and Weber, 2011). Therefore, if men were over-\nrepresented in the Evening group and under-represented in the Morning group, then\ndifferences in risk-taking in relation to sleep pattern were confounded by sex.\nThe sex variable was not taken into consideration also by the three studies by Piffer\nall conducted with male subjects. Sex, however, is an important aspect of the sexual\nselection hypothesis of eveningness evolution. Clearly, both men and women engage in\nshort-term mating and the night-owl sleep pattern occurs in both sexes, though it is more\nprevalent in men than in women. Therefore, when investigating whether eveningness is\nassociated with traits that favor short-term mating strategies, both men and women should\nbe considered.\nThe evolution of eveningness\nIn this study, I tested the hypothesis that eveningness is associated with greater\npropensities for risk-taking and for short-term relationship orientation. Specifically, I tested\nthe prediction that NO females should be more similar to NO males (or to males in general)\nthan to EM females in risk-taking and short-term relationship orientation. Since sexually\ndimorphic hormonal variables (testosterone and cortisol levels are higher in men than in\nwomen; Maestripieri, Baran, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2010) may be potential physiological\nmechanisms underlying the link between a predisposition for eveningness and traits such as\nrisk-taking and short-term relationship orientation, I tested the prediction that NO females\nshould be more similar to NO males (or to males in general) than to EM females in their\nsalivary concentrations of testosterone and cortisol. Furthermore, if testosterone or cortisol\ndiffered significantly in relation to sleep patterns, I tested its possible role as a\nphysiological mechanism mediating the relationship between social and physiological\nvariables. Finally, I compared the number of sexual partners between NO and EM males to\nassess whether I could replicate the previously reported association between male\neveningness and higher number of sexual partners.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nBooth Business School at the University of Chicago. Participation in the study was one of\nthe requirements for a course and therefore it was mandatory for the entire 2008 cohort of\nMBA students. Students, however, were paid $20 or more for their participation. The use of\nhuman subjects was approved by the IRB and all students were asked for informed written\nconsent for their participation in the study.\nProcedures\nFor all study participants (n = 501), information on the following variables was\ncollected: age, sex, relationship status, financial risk aversion, self-reported risk-taking\ntendencies, and salivary cortisol and testosterone concentrations measured before and after\nthe experimental risk aversion test. For a subset of study participants (n = 201; 110 males,\n91 females), additional information was collected about self-reported baseline stress level,\nsleep pattern, sleep amount, and number of previous sexual partners (only for male\nparticipants) (see below for details).\nAssessment of financial risk aversion and salivary cortisol and testosterone.\nStudy participants were asked to take a 90 minute computerized test in which they\nplayed a game that assessed their tendencies for financial risk aversion, along with other\neconomic games (Sapienza, Zingales, and Maestripieri, 2009). All students were tested on\ntwo days. Tests were conducted in the afternoon, between 1:30 and 5:00 p.m. Taking the\ntest was a stressful experience (see Maestripieri et al., 2010). To assess changes in cortisol\nand testosterone in relation to the test, two saliva samples were collected from each study\nparticipant, one at the beginning of the test session and the other 2 hours later, after the\nparticipants completed their tests. Hormone changes from the pre-test to the post-test were\ncalculated using the regressor variable method, namely as the unstandardized residuals of a\nThe evolution of eveningness\nregression analysis with pre-test hormone as the predictor and post-test hormone as the\ndependent variable. This method ensures that the measure of hormone change is\nindependent of the pre-test scores (see Maestripieri et al., 2010). Approximately 2-3 ml of\nsaliva was collected by passive drool into plastic vials. Although salivary concentrations of\ntestosterone and cortisol are lower in the afternoon than in the morning, afternoon hormone\nlevels are more stable and therefore better suited for psychoneuroendocrine studies. All\nsamples were immediately placed into dry ice and transported to Dr. Robert Chatterton's\nEndocrinology Laboratory at Northwestern University, where they were frozen at \u00ad80 \u00b0C\nuntil assayed. Before assay, samples were thawed and centrifuged to reduce viscosity.\nSalivary concentrations of testosterone and cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay,\nusing antisera prepared within the laboratory (Chatterton, Vogelsong, Lu, and Hudgens,\n1997). Cross-reactivity of the cortisol antiserum with cortisone was nonexistent; cross-\nreactivities of the testosterone antiserum with dihydrotestosterone and androstenedione\nwere 13 and 0.2%; those for androsterone, etiocholanone, estradiol, and dehydroe-\npiandrosterone were all less than 0.1%. The lower sensitivity of the assays was 0.07 ng/ml\nfor cortisol and 7.5 pg/ml for testosterone. Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were\nall < 10% and inter-assay CVs were < 15%, consistent with published data for other assays\nfrom this laboratory (Chatterton et al., 1997). All samples were assayed in duplicate, and\nthe average of duplicates was used in all analyses.\nSelf-report measures.\nSelf-reported risk-taking. Risk-taking tendencies were assessed by asking\nparticipants to answer the question \"Are you generally fully prepared to take risks?\" on a 0\nto 10 scale, with 0 = unwilling/unprepared and 10 = willing/fully prepared.\nSleep pattern. Study participants were asked the question \"Are you a night-owl or\nan early morning person?\" If participants could not identify themselves as being one\npattern or the other, they were given the option of answering \"I don't know.\" This single-\nitem measure for the assessment of chronotype represents a simplification of the 5-item\n\"reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire\" (rMEQ; Adan and Almirall, 1991),\nwhich in turn is a validated simplification of the 19-item Morningness-Eveningness\nQuestionnaire (MEQ) developed by Horne and Ostberg (1976). In the rMEQ, individuals\nare asked four questions about the time at which they prefer to get up or go to sleep and the\ntime at which they perform best or feel tired. Item 5 in the rMEQ requires that the\nindividuals self-identify as \"definitely a morning type,\" \"rather more a morning than an\nevening type,\" \"rather more an evening than a morning type,\" or \"definitely an evening\ntype.\" Individuals are then classified into three groups (Morning Type, Neither Type,\nEvening Type) or two groups (Evening Type, Morning Type). Investigations of the\npsychometric properties of the rMEQ have shown that this scale has high inter-item\ncorrelations and high coefficient alpha (e.g., Caci Deschaux, Adan, and Natale, 2009;\nChelmiski, Petros, Plaud, and Ferraro, 2000). This means that people's self-assessment of\nchronotype (item 5) accurately reflects their self-assessment of circadian behavior and\npreferences (items 1-4). The single-item assessment of chronotype used in this study\nrequires a self-identification of the subjects as a morning or an evening-type, similar to\nitem 5 of the rMEQ. The psychometric properties of the rMEQ suggest that this 5-item\nscale and the single-item measure should result in a similar classification of chronotypes.\nThe evolution of eveningness\nThe single-item measure, however, provides a more conservative assessment of chronotype\nthan the rMEQ (particularly when this scale is used to assign study participants to two\ngroups with a median split) because participants who answer \"I don't know\" are excluded\nfrom data analyses.\nSleep amount. Participants were asked to estimate how many hours per night they\nusually slept.\nRelationship status. Subjects were asked whether they were single or in a long-term\nrelationship. The long-term relationship category was defined as being with a romantic\npartner for at least 6 months up to the time of testing, including being married. By\ndefinition, the single category included both single individuals and individuals who were in\na short-term (less than 6 months) relationship at the time of testing.\nNumber of previous sexual partners. Male participants were asked to indicate the\nnumber of different individuals with whom they had sexual intercourse in their life.\nInformation was also collected on background variables such as the participants'\nage, height, weight, general health, smoking and drug use, handedness, sexual orientation,\nand use of contraceptives. Women were asked whether they used hormonal contraceptives\nat the time of testing, the first and the last day of their most recent menstrual flow period,\nthe average length of their menstrual cycles, and whether cycles were regular or irregular.\nNone of the above background variables had any significant effects on the variables of\ninterest in this study.\nResults\nSex differences in variables and correlation between risk-taking measures\nWith one exception (cortisol responses to stress), there were significant sex\ndifferences in all the variables considered in this study.

Given this correlation, and to avoid redundancy, only the self-reported measure\nof risk-taking was used in subsequent analyses. Males (n = 319) were significantly more\nlikely to be single than in a relationship when compared to females (n = 144), 2(1) = 4.92,\nThe evolution of eveningness\nFigure 1.

The distribution of the two sleep\npatterns was significantly different in males and females, 2(1) = 5.75, p = 0.01: Among\nThe evolution of eveningness\nmales, NOs were more than three times as common as EMs (68 vs 21) whereas among\nfemales, NOs were approximately 1.5 times as common as the EMs (48 vs 33) (see Figure\n5). There was no significant effect of sleep pattern on the amount of sleep (ANOVA; F(1,\n166) = 0.10; ns) or a significant interaction between sleep pattern, sex, and sleep amount,\nFigure 5. Relative number of males and females who reported being EM or NO\nAn ANOVA examining the effects of sleep pattern and sex on risk-taking revealed\nno main effect of sleep pattern, F(1, 166) = 0.45, ns, but a significant interaction between\nthat EM females scored significantly lower on risk-taking than individuals in the other\nthree groups (all p values < 0.05). NO males, EM males, and NO females were not\nsignificantly different from each other (see Figure 1b).\nThe percentage of individuals who were single was similar in NO males and NO\nfemales and significantly higher than the percentage of individuals who were single in EM\nregardless of sex, were more likely to be single than Early-Morning individuals. Although\nNO males reported having had, on average, almost twice as many sexual partners as EM\nThe evolution of eveningness\nSleep pattern, hormones, and risk-taking\nANOVA revealed no significant main effect of sleep pattern on average cortisol\nlevels, F(1, 166) = 2.40, ns, but a significant interaction between sleep pattern and sex, F(1,\n166) = 3.96, p < 0.05. Similar to the effects of sleep pattern and sex on risk-taking, post-\nhoc tests revealed that EM females had significantly lower average cortisol levels than\nindividuals in the other three groups (all p values < 0.05; see Figure 3b), whereas NO\nmales, EM males, and NO females were not significantly different from each other. Unlike\ncortisol, there was no significant main effect of sleep pattern on average testosterone, F(1,\nMeasures of cortisol or testosterone change in response to stress were not affected\nby sleep patterns. Thus, there was no significant main effect of sleep pattern on the cortisol\nstress response, F(1, 166) = 0.49, ns, and no significant interaction between sleep pattern\nmain effect of sleep pattern on testosterone residuals, F(1, 166) = 0.63, ns, and no\nsignificant interaction between sleep pattern and sex, F(1, 166) = 1.86, ns; NO males: M +\nVariation in average cortisol or in risk-taking was not correlated with variation in\nsleep amount regardless of sex (average cortisol and sleep amount: r(168) = 0.05, ns; risk-\ntaking and sleep amount: r(168) = 0.09, ns). Furthermore, there was no significant\ndifference in sleep amount in relation to relationship status, t(168) = -0.15, ns. Thus,\ndiscrete variation in sleep patterns was a more powerful predictor of variation in cortisol,\nrisk-taking, and relationship status than continuous variation in sleep amount.\nThe hypothesis that cortisol mediated the influence of sleep pattern and sex on risk-\ntaking was tested with a four-step multiple regression approach (Baron and Kenny, 1986).\nIn Model 1, sleep pattern and sex were a significant predictor of risk-taking ( = -0.17, t =\n-2.31, p = 0.02). Sleep pattern and sex were also a significant predictor of average cortisol\n(Model 4), the effect of sleep pattern and sex on risk-taking was no longer significant after\ncontrolling for cortisol ( = -0.13, t = -1.72, ns), whereas the effect of cortisol on risk-\ntaking remained significant after controlling for sleep pattern and sex ( = 0.18, t = 2.30, p\n= 0.02). These results support the cortisol mediation hypothesis. Finally, there were no\nsignificant differences in risk-taking or average cortisol between individuals who were\n= 0.68, ns), suggesting that relationship status played no significant role in accounting for\nthe association between sleep pattern, cortisol, and risk-taking.\nThe evolution of eveningness\nFigure 6. Correlation between average cortisol levels (across sex and sleep pattern groups)\nand risk-taking scores\nDiscussion\nThe hypothesis that eveningness should be associated with higher risk-taking was\nsupported by results obtained in women but not in men. Night-owl females were\nindistinguishable from NO and EM males in risk-taking, and all three groups scored higher\nthan the EM females. The prediction that NO males should score higher in risk-taking than\nEM males was not supported. In a previous study, however, eveningness was found to be\nassociated with higher risk-taking in both men and women (Killgore, 2007; but see the\nIntroduction for a criticism of this study).\nThe hypothesis that eveningness should be associated with greater propensity for\nshort-term relationship orientation was supported in both men and women, as NO males\nand females were more likely than EM males and females to be single than in a\nrelationship. NO males reported, on average, a higher number of sexual partners than EM\nmales (11.00 vs 6.36); this difference was not statistically significant but it might have\nreached significance with a larger sample size. Although demonstrating that NO individuals\nhave a higher number of sexual partners is not a crucial test of the adaptiveness of\neveningness, if the finding by Piffer and collaborators could be replicated in both men and\nwomen, it would contribute to a better understanding of the functional significance of\nindividual differences in chronotype and their possible evolutionary origin.\nIn this study, the association between eveningness and risk-taking in women was\ntestosterone-independent, as NO females were similar to EM females in testosterone levels.\nThe evolution of eveningness\nAverage cortisol, instead, was a significant predictor of risk-taking across sexes, and a\nregression-based mediation analysis indicated that cortisol likely mediated the effect of\nsleep pattern on risk-taking in women. Men had significantly higher average cortisol than\nwomen but, as with risk-taking, NO females were indistinguishable from NO and EM\nmales in average cortisol levels, and all three groups had higher cortisol than EM females.\nThe finding that cortisol was more strongly associated with chronotype and risk-\ntaking than testosterone was somewhat surprising, since Randler et al. (2012b) presented\nevidence that eveningness is associated with higher testosterone in men. However, cortisol\nand testosterone were positively correlated in this subject population and variation in\naverage testosterone levels accounted for variation in financial risk aversion among women\nUnlike variation in average cortisol levels, which may potentially be the result of\nvariation in sleep patterns and/or reflect stable individual differences in arousability or\nreactivity to the environment (see also Adam, Hawkley, Kudielka, and Cacioppo, 2006;\nDecker and Aggott, 2013, for evidence that high-functioning adults have high cortisol\nlevels, as elevated cortisol may provide an \"adaptive boost\" to meet daily demands),\nvariation in cortisol responses to stress was not associated with sleep patterns or with risk-\ntaking. Similarly, variation in average sleep amount (i.e., self-reported number of hours of\nsleep per night) was not a significant predictor of average cortisol or of risk-taking.\nTherefore, it appears that variation in average cortisol and in risk-taking is specifically\nassociated with individual differences in morningness/eveningness, especially in women,\nrather than with sleep amount or stress reactivity.\nThe origin of individual differences in sleep patterns is probably, in part, genetic\nand, in part, environmental; regardless of relative contributions of genes and environment\nto this trait, different sleep patterns could result in different cortisol profiles, and cortisol, in\nturn, could affect variation in people's propensities to take risks. It is also possible,\nhowever, that correlations between sleep pattern, cortisol, and risk-taking are the product of\nindependent associations with a fourth variable not considered in this study, such as\npersonality (for a discussion of personality and risk-taking, see Zuckerman and Kuhlman,\n2000). Establishing causal relationships between variables is difficult without an\nexperimental manipulation of these variables, which was beyond the scope of this study.\nThe possibility that sleep patterns, cortisol profiles, and risk-taking propensities (and\npossibly also relationship orientation) are all linked together through personality is still\nconsistent with the hypothesis that this is a cluster of traits functionally linked to short-term\nmating strategies in both sexes.\nThe lack of significant differences between NO and EM males in cortisol or risk-\ntaking may be the result of the low number of EM males in the subject population (n = 21)\nand does not necessarily argue against the hypothesis that eveningness and risk-taking are\nassociated with short-term mating strategies. Although eveningness may be an important\ncomponent of short-term mating strategies, there may be other aspects of short-term mating\nstrategies that are unrelated to sleep pattern, especially in men.\nAlthough a great deal of research has already been conducted on human\nmorningness/eveningness, with a few exceptions (e.g., Jonason et al., 2013; Kanazawa and\nPerina, 2009; Piffer, 2010), most of this research has not been conducted from an\nevolutionary perspective and therefore has not investigated the possible adaptive\nThe evolution of eveningness\nsignificance of variation in this trait. The relationship between chronotype, sex, relationship\norientation, and risk-taking highlighted in this study, however, suggests that further tests of\nadaptive hypotheses are warranted.\nThe present study has some methodological limitations, including the way\nchronotype was assessed, the lack of personality measures, the small sample size,\nparticularly for the EM males, and the use of a subject population consisting of MBA\nstudents with particular demographic and chronotype characteristics. Future studies are\nneeded to replicate these results and assess the extent to which they can be generalized to\nother populations. The hypotheses and the data presented here, however, can stimulate and\nguide future research on the evolutionary significance of chronotype and contribute to the\nelucidation of this poorly understood aspect of human biology and behavior.\n"
