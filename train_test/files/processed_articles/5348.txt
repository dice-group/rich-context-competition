    "abstract": "Abstract\nProtests at national party conventions are an important setting in which political parties and social movements\nchallenge one another. This article examines the motivations of participants in these events. Drawing upon data\nfrom surveys of protesters outside the 2008 national party conventions, it focuses on how partisan and independent\npolitical identifications correspond with the reasons that individuals give for protesting. The results demonstrate that\nthere are some conditions under which independents place a greater focus on issues than do partisans and under\nwhich partisans place a greater focus on presidential candidates than do independents. However, there are also\nconditions under which independents are inclined to work alongside partisans, such as trying to stop the election\nof a threatening candidate and in championing an issue outside their opposing party's convention. The article argues\nthat micro-level partisan identifications are thus likely to affect the broader structure of party coalitions. These\nconsiderations promise to become increasingly relevant as social movements \u00ad such as the Tea Party, Occupy Wall\nStreet, and Black Lives Matter \u00ad launch new campaigns against or within established parties.\n",

For example,\nAmerican Federation of Labor, led a march for labor rights\noutside the Republican National Convention (RNC) in\nChicago (Staff, 1908). Over the years, conventions have\nseen protests for woman suffrage, civil rights, farm subsi-\ndies, peace in Vietnam and Iraq, the right to life and the\nright to choose, tighter financial regulations on banks, and\nmany other issues.Activists travel to conventions to express\ntheir viewpoints because these gatherings symbolize the\nparties as institutions in a way that no other events do\nlize outside conventions because it is a relatively easy way\nto seize media coverage for their causes (Sobieraj, 2011).\nConvention protests have been especially contentious in the\n2000s, which have seen frequent clashes between protest-\ners and police, as well as mass arrests (Hermes, 2015).\nDespite the regular appearance of convention protests\nduring the presidential election cycle, relatively little is\nknown about why individuals participate in this type of\nactivism. Are they there to help or hurt a candidate? To pro-\nmote an issue? To express themselves? To see friends? Or\nsome mixture of all of these? What factors shape these\nmotivations? This lacuna is unfortunate because protest\norganizers are among the policy demanders that work to\nshape party coalitions (Bawn et al., 2012). Through these\nprotests, parties and movements meet in the streets outside\nthe conventions in a tangible way. A sizeable body of\nresearch has emerged on how leaders in parties and move-\nments influence one another (see, e.g., Clemens, 1997;\nmovements affect, and are affected by, rank-and-file activ-\nists remains less-explored territory (but see Heaney and\nUnconventional protests: Partisans and\nindependents outside the Republican and\nDemocratic national conventions\nMichael T. Heaney\n Keywords\nPolitical party, social movement, partisan identification, independent, Democratic National Convention, Republican\nNational Convention\nOrganizational Studies Program and Department of Political Science,\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMichael T. Heaney, Organizational Studies Program and Department of\nPolitical Science, University of Michigan, 2016-J Ruthven Museums Building,\nEmail: mheaney@umich.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nIn examining this topic, Fabio Rojas and I (Heaney and\nmovements sometimes come together in a social space that\nwe call \"the party in the street.\" This space provides an\nopportunity for activists to pressure a party to pursue a\nmovement's issues and, reciprocally, to pressure the move-\nment to support a party's candidates. We argue that partisan\nidentification draws activists into politics when it serves the\nparty's interests, but also pushes activists out of politics\nwhen their involvement no longer serves the party's goals.\nThus, we see a trade-off between party and movement\nactivism \u00ad which is largely to the advantage of parties \u00ad at\nleast during periods of high partisan polarization. However,\nthis empirical analysis is limited by the fact that it focuses\non issue involvement without considering the actions that\nactivists may try to help or hurt candidates directly.\nSamara Klar and Yanna Krupnikov (2016) also examine\nhow partisan identification affects political participation,\nthough they stress the consequences of the decision by an\nincreasing number of citizens to identify as independents,\nwho avoid making public commitments to one of the major\nparties. They argue that even though independents may\ntend to vote as if they are loyal partisans, their embarrass-\nment with the parties and with contemporary politics may\nmotivate them to refrain from disclosing their partisan lean-\nings. In particular, independents tend to avoid the kind of\ninterpersonal activism that promotes the flow of partisan\nideas through social networks, such as talking to friends\nabout politics and displaying partisan bumper stickers, yard\nsigns, and buttons. This avoidance of partisan engagement\non the part of independents is an impediment to the parties'\nefforts to win elections and govern.\nthat parties gain from the participation of independents\nwhen they are allied with partisans, Klar and Krupnikov\nemphasize that parties lose when independent identifiers do\nnot participate in politics. Yet, Klar and Krupnikov do not\nexamine what happens when independents do participate in\npartisan politics. How is their participation different from\nthat of party identifiers? Moreover, their empirical analysis\nfocuses on actions that independents may or may not take\nto help candidates, but does not consider the potentially\npowerful actions that independents may take to hurt\ncandidates.\nIn this article, I argue that combining the Heaney\u00adRojas\nand Klar\u00adKrupnikov perspectives on partisan and inde-\npendent identifications provides significant insights into\nthe competing motivations of protesters outside the national\nparty conventions. It considers that activists may act to help\nor hurt a candidate, or speak out on an issue, within the\nsame analysis. I argue that partisan identification \u00ad or its\nabsence \u00ad affects the mixed conditions under which activ-\nists seek to be a resource to parties or movements.\nThe article proceeds, first, by discussing the role of par-\ntisan identification and independence in individuals' par-\nticipation in activism. Second, it outlines the research\ndesign based on a survey of demonstrators outside the 2008\nnational party conventions. Third, it presents descriptive\nsurvey results. Fourth, it reports estimates of probit models\nfor protest motivation. It concludes by considering how\npolitical parties and social movements relate to one another\nat the grassroots level.\nPartisans, independents, and activism\nPolitical activism is a widely prevalent form of political\nparticipation, though it receives substantially less attention\nthan does voting behavior. Activism reflects individuals'\ninvolvement in politics that takes place informally, such as\nby participating in demonstrations, writing about issues\nonline, organizing citizens' groups, and writing letters to\nelected officials. Using data from a longitudinal study of\n(2012) reports that approximately two-thirds of Americans\nengage in some form of political activism over their life-\ntimes. Schlozman et al. (2012) argue that this activism\nredirects the attention of politicians away from the prefer-\nences of the median voter and toward the causes champi-\noned by activists.\nI argue that partisan identification \u00ad or the lack thereof\n\u00ad is closely linked with the ways that individuals make\nsense of their participation in political activism. People that\nidentify closely with a political party may turn to party poli-\ntics to understand and explain their involvement in activ-\nism. They are more likely to be attracted to the competitive\naspects of elections that are integral to party politics\nPeople who describe themselves as independents are\nlikely to have different types of concerns about politics than\ndo partisans.As Klar and Krupnikov (2016) point out, inde-\npendents may be put off by the conflictual aspects of poli-\ntics to a degree that self-identified partisans may not be.\nHowever, they may also reject partisan identities because\nthey are cross-pressured on issues with which they strongly\nidentify (Magleby and Nelson, 2012). Social identities\nrelated to these issues, then, may help to motivate protest\nparticipation (Polletta and Jasper, 2001). Convention pro-\ntests usually have a strong issue orientation that is likely to\namplify these motivations. As a result, the independents\nwho protest at conventions may not be in the \"middle of the\nroad\" between the Democratic and Republican parties.\nRather, they may identify as independents because there is\nat least one issue on which they do not think that the parties\nare extreme enough.\nBuilding on these arguments, it is possible to state a\nseries of hypotheses related to partisan identification, inde-\npendence, and the motivation of individuals for participat-\ning in activism outside conventions. First, partisans at\nconvention protests are likely to want to help the presiden-\ntial candidate of their party, especially if they are attending\nthe convention at which that candidate is nominated. Thus:\n: Partisans are more likely than independents to be\nmotivated by the desire to help a candidate if they are\nprotesting at their more-proximate party's convention.\nSecond, it is possible that activists protest to hurt the\nchances of the candidate from the other party. They are\nmore likely to see the opportunity to do so if they are attend-\ning the convention of the opposing party. Thus:\n: Partisans are more likely than independents to be\nmotivated by the desire to hurt a candidate if they are\nprotesting at their more-distant party's convention.\nThird, partisans and independents are likely to be differ-\nently motivated by issues. Because their energy is drawn\ninto the competitive aspects of partisan politics, partisans\nare less likely to articulate their motivations explicitly in\nissue terms. In contrast, independents are more likely to see\nissues as closer to their political identities. These propensi-\nties underlie the trade-off between party and movement\nactivism. Thus:\n: Partisans are less motivated to protest by issue con-\nsiderations than are independents.\nUnderlying these hypotheses is the more general hypothe-\nsis that independents are differently motivated than parti-\nsans in attending protests. Independents generally eschew\nworking to affect the chances of candidates and instead\nconcentrate on their issue concerns. Thus:\n: Partisans and independents are differently moti-\nvated to protest in that partisans place a greater empha-\nsis on candidates and independents place a greater\nemphasis on issues.\nConvention protest surveys\nThis study is based on surveys conducted of protesters out-\nDemocratic National Convention (DNC) in Denver,\nColorado. The attitudes of the participants in the protests\nwere assessed using a five-page, pencil-and-paper survey.1\nThe questions queried individuals' motivations for partici-\npating in the protest, partisan identification, ideology, emo-\ntional engagement in politics, social networks with other\nprotesters, where they live, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, age,\nlevel of education, and annual income, as well as other atti-\ntudinal and demographic questions.\nSurveys were collected at all protests using the \"anchor\nsampling\" method developed by Heaney and Rojas (2007,\nvey team began by distributing itself throughout the major\nregions of the crowd. Surveyors were instructed to look\ninto the crowd and select a person to serve as an \"anchor\"\nfor their counting process. This anchor could be anyone\nthey preferred, though the anchor would not be surveyed on\nthe understanding that s/he might be selected with bias.\nFrom the anchor, surveyors counted five persons to the\nright, and then issued a survey invitation; again, counted\nfive to the right, then issued a survey invitation, continuing\nuntil three individuals had accepted the survey. Once three\nsurveys were completed, the surveyor selected a new\nanchor and repeated the procedures. Non-responses were\nrecorded for the purpose of tabulating response rates.\nResearch shows that if these surveys are conducted with\nattention to ensuring random selection and account for\nbiases in non-response, then they can generate samples that\nare a good representation of the individuals attending the\nWho are convention protesters?\nThe survey yielded 412 respondents from the DNC, with a\nresponse rate of 65 percent, and 990 respondents from the\nRNC, with a response rate of 77 percent. All of the analysis\nreported here is weighted according to differences in\nresponse rates and accounts for different variances in the\ntwo strata of the survey (i.e. the DNC and the RNC).\nThe partisan breakdown of protest participants is pro-\nvided in Figure 1. The distribution has a strong, overall\nskew toward non-Republicans. Republicans and people\nwho lean Republican made up about 6 percent of protesters\nat the RNC and 11 percent of protesters at the DNC.Among\nother participants, there was a greater percentage of inde-\npendents at the DNC and a greater percentage of Democrats\nat the RNC. Roughly 36 percent of protesters at the RNC\nwere independents, as were 44 percent of respondents at the\nDNC. Democrats and Democratic leaners made up 45 per-\ncent of protesters at the DNC and 57 percent at the RNC.\nRespondents were asked \"Which are the most important\nreasons that you decided to come to this convention?\" They\nwere shown a list of 12 options (plus \"other\") and asked to\ncircle up to three of them. This article focuses on three of\nthese options: (1) \"To help a candidate win this year's pres-\nidential election\"; (2) \"To help prevent a candidate from\nwinning this year's presidential election\"; and (3) \"To\nexpress my view on a particular issue or issues.\"\nRespondents who indicated that they were motivated by\nissues were also asked to \"Please specify the top issues.\"\nSelected motivations are reported by convention in\nFigure 2.2 Respondents were more likely to seek to help a\ncandidate at the DNC (14%) than at the RNC (10%) and\nmore likely to seek to hurt the chances of a candidate at the\nRNC (18%) than at the DNC (7%). However, issues pro-\nvided a more powerful source of inspiration for these\n4 Research and Politics \nrespondents.3 Approximately 32 percent of DNC protesters\nand 44 percent of RNC protesters were motivated by\nissues.4 War and peace was the issue most commonly men-\ntioned, with 27 percent of respondents volunteering this\nmotivation. There was a significant fall-off after war/peace,\nwith 6 percent concerned about the economy, 5 percent\nmentioning health, 4 percent calling for group rights, 3 per-\ncent pointing to problems with the environment, and all\nother issues falling below this threshold.\nModels of protest motivation\nThis article estimates three probit regression models of pro-\ntest motivation: one for helping a candidate, one for hurting\nthe chances of a candidate, and one for issue motivation.\nComplete-case imputation (Little, 1988) was used to\nreplace the values of missing data, which is an appropriate\nmethod given the low percentage of missing data (King\nEach equation includes the same independent variables.\nThe first focus variable is More-Proximate Party\nConvention. This variable takes the value of 1 if a Strong\nDemocrat, Not Very Strong Democrat, or Independent Who\nLeans Democrat is protesting the DNC; or, if a Strong\nRepublican, Not Very Strong Republican, or Independent\nWho Leans Republican is protesting the RNC; 0 otherwise.\nThe second focus variable is More-Distant Party\nConvention. This variable takes the value of 1 if a Strong\nFigure 1. Partisan identification of protesters by convention.\nFigure 2. Selected motivations of protesters by convention.\nDemocrat, Not Very Strong Democrat, or Independent Who\nLeans Democrat is protesting the RNC; or, if a Strong\nRepublican, Not Very Strong Republican, or Independent\nWho Leans Republican is protesting the DNC; 0 otherwise.\nThe implicit excluded category is independent, which com-\nbines both middle-independent category and the other-\nindependent category.\nThe remaining variables are included for the purpose\nof statistical control. Ideology is measured on a 9-point\nordinal scale from left to right, with \"To the `right' of\nstrong conservative\" receiving a score of 9 and \"To the\n`left' of strong liberal\" receiving a score of 1. Enthusiasm\nabout Politics and Anxiety about Politics are included in\norder to account for positive and negative emotional\nengagement with the political process. They are measured\non a 5-point ordinal scale, with people reporting enthusi-\nasm and anxiety \"Almost Always\" receiving a 5 and peo-\nple who \"Never\" experience enthusiasm and anxiety\nreceiving a 1. Social Networks at Protest accounts for the\npossibility that people that perceive that they are well con-\nnected at the protest may be motivated differently than\npeople that perceive that they are poorly connected at the\nprotest. Live in State of Convention controls for the pos-\nsibility that local people are differently motivated than\nthose that travel a considerable difference to protest the\nconvention. Sex/Gender takes the value of 1 for women\nand 0 for men. Race/Ethnicity takes the value of 1 for\nwhites and 0 for nonwhites. Age is measured in years.\nEducation is measured on a 6-point ordinal scale, with\n\"Graduate or professional degree\" receiving a score of 6\nand \"Less than high school diploma\" receiving a score of\n1. Income is measured in thousands of dollars for 2007.\nProbit results are reported in Table 1. The estimates in\nequation (1) are consistent with H1\n. They show that when\npartisans are protesting at their more-proximate party con-\nvention, they are more likely than independents to do so\nfor the purpose of helping a candidate for president.\nAdditionally, consistent with H4\n, the results show that par-\ntisans protesting at their more-distant party's convention\nare also more likely than independents to want to help a\ncandidate for president. That is, they may see their protest\nof the opposing party directly in terms of being helpful to\ntheir home party. On this point, independents are clearly\ndifferent from partisans: they are very unlikely to protest\nwith the intention of helping a candidate. Only about 6 per-\ncent of independents reported doing so.\nThe estimates in equation (2) are consistent with H2\n.\nThey show that when partisans are protesting at their more-\ndistant party's convention, they are more likely than inde-\npendents to work to hurt the chances of a candidate.\nHowever, the results are not entirely consistent with H4\n.\nThe estimates reveal that independents are significantly\nmore likely than partisans attending their more-proximate\nparty's convention to protest with the intention to hurt the\nchances of a candidate. Thus, rather than being strictly less\ninterested in candidate politics than are partisans, inde-\npendents occupy a middle ground. About 10 percent of\nindependents were motivated to stop a candidate, which\nwas more than the 4 percent of partisans at their more-\nproximate convention and less than the 25 percent of parti-\nsans at their most-distant convention.\nThe estimates in equation (3) support H3\n. They demon-\nstrate that partisans at their more-proximate party conven-\ntion are less likely than independents to protest because of\nissue concerns. However, again, the results are not entirely\nconsistent with H4\n. There is no statistically significant dif-\nference in the degree to which they are motivated by issues\nbetween independents and partisans when they are attend-\ning their more-distant party's convention. About 40 percent\nof independents and 46 percent of partisans at their more-\ndistant convention came out due to issues. In contrast, only\n28 percent of partisans at their more-proximate convention\nmentioned issues as one of their reasons.\nThe effects of the control variables exhibited variation\nacross the equations. Anxiety about politics had significant,\npositive correlations across all three equations, though\nenthusiasm about politics only significantly contributes to\nhelping a candidate. Women were more likely than men to\nbe motivated by issue politics and to hurt the chances of a\ncandidate, but were no different from men in wanting to\nhelp a candidate. Older respondents were more likely than\nyounger respondents to be motivated by issues, but age was\nnot associated with differences in motivations about\naffecting candidates' chances. Ideology, Social Networks\nat Protest, Live in State of Convention, Race/Ethnicity,\nEducation, and Income were not significantly related to the\ndependent variables in any of the equations.\nGiven that the largest group of issue-focused protesters\nwere concerned with issues of war and peace, I considered\nwhat would happen if this group was removed from the\nanalysis. The results of this alternative specification are\npresented in Table 2. The pattern of direction and signifi-\ncance (or lack thereof) matches the main analysis for five of\nsix coefficients that were the focus of the hypothesis tests.\nFrom these results, we can conclude that if issues of war\nand peace moved off the agenda (which, for example, was\nlargely the case during the 2016 convention protests), the\neffects of partisan and independent identities would likely\nremain very similar.\nConclusion\nThe results of this study exhibit consistencies and incon-\nsistencies with the extant literature. Consistent with Klar\nand Krupnikov (2016), the results show that independents\nare much less likely than partisans to work to help a can-\ndidate. Likewise, consistent with Heaney and Rojas\n(2015), the results demonstrate a trade-off between issues\nand party activism, as protesting at one's own party con-\nvention is associated with candidate, rather than issue,\n6 Research and Politics \nmotivations. However, in contrast to the argument of Klar\nand Krupnikov, the results reveal that independents are\nmore prone than some partisans to protest with the inten-\ntion of stopping a candidate. One possible explanation,\nsuggested by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky,\n1979), is that independents are more likely to join the par-\ntisan fray if they see the need to stop a loss (i.e. the elec-\ntion of a bad candidate), than to achieve a gain (i.e. the\nelection of their preferred candidate). Thus, it may be pre-\nsumptuous to count independents completely out of parti-\nsan politics. In contrast to Heaney and Rojas, the results\nindicate there is not necessarily a trade-off between party\nand issue activism when partisans are protesting their\nmost-distant party's convention, where partisans are often\nfighting for issues right beside independents.\nIt is a mistake to see independents as having abandoned\nelectoral politics; though, under certain conditions, they do\nexhibit less concern than do partisans. Yet it must also be con-\nsidered that a growing share of independents in the population\nrepresents an opportunity for movements. If movements can\nmobilize people based on issue identities \u00ad rather than partisan\nidentities \u00ad then they may better withstand the vicissitudes of\npartisan politics. Advocates truly committed to issues may be\nmore likely to push back against parties, even when their\nmore-preferred party is in office, thus sowing the seeds for\nincreased relevance by movements in American politics.\nTable 1.
