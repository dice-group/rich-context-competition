Seasonal variation in disease incidence\nis a well-known phenomenon, and we there-\nfore aimed to identify any seasonal variation\nin the occurrence of IC. For example, acute\nmyocardial infarction and heart failure occur\nmost frequently in the winter,6\u00ad9 possibly\nassociated with low-temperature-induced\nstimulation of sympathetic nerves and\nSeasonal variation in some gastrointes-\ntinal diseases has also been reported,12 such\nas peptic ulcer diseases, which are more\ncommon in colder seasons.13 Cold stress\nstimulates sympathetic nerve activity and\nincreases catecholamine secretion from the\nadrenal medulla, causing blood vessel con-\ntraction. Contraction of the celiac artery and\nthe resulting decreased blood supply to the\ngastroduodenal mucosa are expected to\nincrease the risk of developing gastroduode-\nnal ulcers. Seasonal variation, especially\nduring the winter, may also occur in other\ngastrointestinal diseases with a pathogenetic\nrelationship to decreased blood supply. This\nsuggests that there may be seasonal vari-\nation in the occurrence of IC, though there is\ncurrently no evidence to support this\nhypothesis.\nWe aimed to identify the clinical charac-\nteristics of IC and to investigate the presence\nof seasonal variation in the occurrence\nof IC.\nMethods\nData sources and definitions\nThis study involved a retrospective ana-\nlysis of the medical charts of patients who\nwere admitted to the gastroenterology\nwards of Shimane Prefectural Central\nHospital has the largest emergency depart-\nment in Izumo city, and approximately\nhalf of all patients requiring emergency\ncare in the Izumo area are admitted to\nthis hospital. Most patients with IC are\nadmitted for treatment in Shimane\nPrefectural Central Hospital. The diagno-\nsis of IC was confirmed based on typical\nmedical history supported by colono-\nscopic, histopathological, and radiologic\nfindings. An absence of antibiotic admin-\nistration prior to the clinical diagnosis and\nnegative stool cultures were mandatory for\nMeteorological characteristics and data\nThe city of Izumo has a temperate, humid\nclimate (Ko\n\u00a8 ppen\u00adGeiger Climate\nClassification; Cfa), with a wide seasonal\ntemperature range. It has a high rainfall\nunder the influence of monsoons in June and\nJuly, and a relatively cold, dry climate in the\nwinter. Weather parameters (monthly mean\ntemperature, diurnal temperature difference,\nmean humidity, mean atmospheric pressure,\ndaylight hours, and precipitation) were\nobtained from the Japan Meteorological\nAgency (http://www.data.jma.go.jp/risk/\nobsdl/).

The mean (\u00c6stand-\nard deviation [SD]) age at diagnosis was 66.8\nWomen were approximately three times\nmore likely than men to develop IC.\nHowever, IC could occur at any age, and its\nincidence increased with age in both sexes,\nwith a small additional peak in women in\nmajor symptoms at diagnosis. IC was classi-\nfied as transient type (294 cases), stricture type\n(17 cases), or gangrenous type (2 cases), while\n51 cases could not be classified. There were no\ndeaths, including deaths from comorbidities,\nduring the study-observation period.

The\nmean atmospheric pressure was lowest in\nJune\u00adAugust and highest in December\u00ad\nJanuary. The mean humidity was lowest in\nMarch\u00adApril and increased rapidly in May.\nMonthly daylight hours were longer in the\nsummer. There were large variations among\nyears in terms of monthly precipitation, with\nno clear seasonal trend.\nNew-onset and recurrent IC\nThe study population included 315 new-\nonset and 49 recurrent cases. There was no\nsignificant difference in age, sex, form of\ndisease, comorbidities, or drugs used at the\ntime of IC occurrence between initial and\nrecurrent cases (Table 1). Seasonal variations\nand biochemical data, such as peripheral\nleukocyte count and C-reactive protein, did\nnot differ significantly between the two\ngroups. Twenty of the 49 recurrent cases\nhad developed initial events before the start\nof the study. We compared seasonal recur-\nrence of IC in the remaining 18 patients (29\nevents), in whom the initial and recurrent\nevents both occurred during the study\nperiod. Half of the recurrent cases developed\nrecurrent IC in the same season as the initial\nevent (Table 2). Of the 18 patients, seven\n(seasonal recurrent group) experienced recur-\nrence in the same season as the initial event,\nwhile the other 11 experienced recurrence in a\ndifferent season (non-seasonal recurrent\ngroup). There was no significant difference\nin age, sex, form of disease, comorbidities, or\ndrug usage between the two groups (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIC is thought to be caused by changes in the\nsystemic circulation or by anatomic or\nWinter Spring Summer Autumn\nAverage yearly number of patients with IC\nadmitted in each season\nFigure 3.

Vertical lines indicate the SD.\ncan be explained by the vascular anatomy of\nthe colon and rectum. The boundary of the\nblood supply from the superior mesenteric\nartery and the inferior mesenteric artery is\nlocated on the descending and sigmoid\ncolons, which are thus vulnerable to ische-\nmic damage. Accordingly, the descending\nand sigmoid colons were the most com-\nmonly involved segments in the current\nstudy, as also reported in previous\nSeasonality is a well-known feature of the\nepidemiology of many diseases.

However, the results\nof this study found no evidence for any\nsignificant seasonal variation in the inci-\ndence of IC, although there was a tendency\nfor IC to be less frequent during the winter.\nPrevious studies have indicated that the\ndivided into vascular and intestinal factors.\nArteriosclerosis, congestive heart disease,\natrial fibrillation, and hypotension are con-\nsidered to be vascular factors that cause a\ndecrease in the blood supply to the colon,\nwhile constipation, diarrhea, and irritable\nbowel syndrome are considered to be intes-\ntinal factors that cause intestinal hypercon-\ntraction. Both factors may be affected by\npharmacologic agents and past history of\nabdominal surgery, and it is possible that the\nexistence of multiple complex risk factors\nmight mask any effects of seasonal environ-\nmental changes on IC. Diarrhea and consti-\npation occurring just before the onset of IC\nare considered to be important.\nConstipation increases colonic intraluminal\npressure and can reduce colonic perfusion.\nAlthough the possible presence of constipa-\ntion before the onset of IC could not be\nevaluated in the current study, laxative use\npatients may have constipation without\ntaking a laxative. Longstreth and Yao3\nreported that constipation preceded the\nsymptoms of IC in only 7% of episodes,\nbut another prospective study15 reported the\npresence of constipation during the 30 days\nbefore the event in 25% of patients with IC.\nThis study demonstrated an obvious\nfemale predominance in IC occurrence, as\noral contraceptives may cause hypercoagul-\nability and ischemia,28,29 these are rarely\nused in Japan and were not used in this study\npopulation. In addition, this would not\nexplain the female predominance among\nelderly women who do not use oral contra-\nceptives. However, constipation and laxa-\ntive use are more common in women than in\nTable 2.

This sug-\ngests that IBS was more strongly associated\nwith IC risk among young patients.\nThe present analysis of patients with\nrecurrent IC suggested a possible role of\nseasonal environmental changes. We com-\npared the seasonality of each event in 18\npatients hospitalized for treatment of IC\nmultiple times, and found that IC often\nrecurred in the same season. This suggested\nthat seasonal factors may play a role in in\nindividuals with certain vascular and intes-\ntinal factors. Patients with a history of IC\nmay thus have a higher chance of developing\nrecurrent IC in the same season in the future,\nthough we were unable to identify possible\npredictive factors for future recurrence in\nthe same season.\nThere were no deaths, including deaths\nfrom comorbidities, during the observation\nperiod in this study. Cosme et al.34 reported\nmortalities due to IC in Spain of 5.9%\nat first admission and 7.4% 5 years later,\nTable 3.

These rates were high com-\npared with those observed in the current\nstudy. In contrast, Nagata et al.35 reported\nthat only one of 57 patients (1.8%) with IC\ndied from a comorbidity during a mean\nfollow-up period of 29 months in a study in\nmortalities, including deaths from comor-\nbidities, of 0% and 6.7%, respectively. The\napparent differences in mortalities between\nJapan and Western countries are interesting.\nSome authors16,26 reported that IC has a\nworse prognosis when isolated in the right\nside of the colon, and about 25% of patients\nin the United States were classified as having\nright-colon ischemia. This was higher than\nin the current study, and in sharp contrast\nwith the previous Japanese reports.\nDifferences in lifestyle and genetic factors\nmay influence the prognosis of patients with\nIC, and further studies are needed to inves-\ntigate the predictive factors for IC.\nThis study had several strengths, includ-\ning being the first report of seasonal vari-\nation in IC onset. Furthermore, although no\nclear seasonality was observed, we deter-\nmined that IC was more likely to recur\nduring the same season as the initial event.\nThis study also had some limitations. First,\nit was a single-center, retrospective study.\nSecond, the overall temperature of a speci-\nfied geographic area may not accurately\nrepresent the actual temperature that an\nindividual is exposed to, which is also\ninfluenced by personal behavior. Third,\ndaily variations in weather conditions were\nnot evaluated.\nConclusions\nThis study found no evidence for seasonal\nvariations in hospital admissions due to IC,\nthough IC may recur more frequently in the\nsame season as the initial event.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
