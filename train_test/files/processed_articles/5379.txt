Fechner (1865, as cited in Berlyne, 1971)\nwas well aware of this when he first established the field of experimental aesthetics and observed that\n\"aesthetic phenomena are among the most complex phenomena within the domain of\npsychology, and this is often used as an excuse by psychologists for being able to say so little\nabout them\".\nThis difficulty stems, in part, from a wide range of definitions of what constitutes, or contributes\nand complexity of the stimuli, including paintings and sculpture, architecture, musical compositions\nand performances, film and dance, which can be evaluated aesthetically. These challenges frequently\nresult in a reductionist approach, which allows more precise questions about the relationship between\nsome feature of the stimulus and the consciously articulated preferences to be explored in a highly\ncontrolled manner. However, as observed by Arnheim (1974), the aesthetic experience is rather fragile\nand typically relates to the gestalt, or whole, rather than the sum of any isolated parts meaning that\na reductionist approach will never be able to explain the effects of the complex interaction of many\nindividual features on the aesthetic evaluation of the stimulus. Previously, we have shown (Holmes &\nprovide a robust method for searching complex feature spaces for highly fit interactions, can be used to\nanswer questions relating to aesthetic preference, using the time spent fixating each image in a simulta-\nneously presented array as a measure of fitness. In this paper, we identify a more powerful oculomotor\nUsing an oculomotor signature as an indicator of\naesthetic preference\n*Corresponding author.\nsignature which correlates with selections based on visual aesthetic preference using a wide range of\nphotographic stimuli, with a view to integrating this signature as a fitness measure in the gaze-driven\nevolutionary algorithm (Holmes & Zanker, 2008) to facilitate the aesthetic evaluation of complex\nvisual stimuli without the need for conscious articulation of that preference.\nThe association between the task being performed and the eye movements made while performing\nthe task is well established. In picture viewing (Buswell, 1935; Yarbus, 1967), music and word read-\nreal-world scene perception (Henderson, 2004), and motor tasks (Land, 2007), consistent patterns of\neye movements have been detected across participants which point to the crucial role that the task\nplays in the direction of overt attention. Free viewing tasks, where the participant is not given any task\nto perform but is merely encouraged to explore the visual scene, are typically used to highlight the\ninfluence of low-level, or bottom-up, influences on eye movements stemming from the visual scene\nitself. However, such effects are not stable over time (Tatler, Baddeley, & Gilchrist, 2005), suggesting\nthe presence of some internally motivated, top-down tasks generated by the participant. It has been\nsuggested that humans seek to create a stimulating and pleasing visual environment for themselves\n(Berlyne, 1971) and that such behavior might be biologically conditioned as a result of the positive sen-\nsations that such stimuli provide (Biederman & Vessel, 2006). If that is indeed the case, then the pattern\nof eye movements made while performing an aesthetic evaluation task might allow preferences to be\npredicted under free viewing conditions, allowing aesthetic preferences to be explored experimentally\nwithout the many problems associated with conscious reporting of subjective preferences (Nisbett &\nArtworks have long been used to elicit eye movements for scientific study, whether for the purposes\nof exploring task demand effects (Yarbus, 1967) or for providing an insight into the relationship be-\ntween artistic images and the viewer's aesthetic response to it (Buswell, 1935; Locher, Krupinski, Mello-\n& Gale, 2002). Most attempts to relate eye movements to the aesthetic qualities of the stimulus have\nconcentrated on the looking behavior of participants while viewing paintings one at a time (Buswell,\ndegree of consistency between viewers with respect to the number and duration of fixations in regions\nof the artwork which are highly detailed and thus potentially more informative. Attempts to correlate\nsuch fixational measures with respect to the outcome of a relative evaluation of several stimuli presented\nsimultaneously are less common, perhaps due to the large individual differences in aesthetic preference\n(Arnheim, 1974; Berlyne, 1971), but this does not preclude a potential consistency in the oculomotor be-\nhavior during the collection of visual information about the stimuli prior to the decision being made, and\nthere is evidence to support a tendency for gaze to linger on objects or artistic images we prefer (Pieters\nPreferential selection based on eye movements is not new and is central to the preferential looking\nparadigm (Dobson, 1983; Teller, 1979) and further supported by the gaze cascade model of preference\ndecision making (Glaholt & Reingold, 2009; Shimojo, Simion, Shimojo, & Scheier, 2003). Funda-\nmental to both of these is the relationship between accumulated fixation time and task relevance first\nidentified by Yarbus (1967). Supporting empirical studies are traditionally performed with just two\nconcurrently presented stimuli, with preference being attributed to a stimulus if it attracts the gaze\nabove chance, that is, more than 50% of the presentation time. In other words, the preferential look-\ning paradigm utilizes a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) method of selection which reduces the\nnoise in the decision making by controlling the cognitive load on the participant and the differences\nbetween the images in the binary choice (Houston-Price & Nakai, 2004). However, this inevitably\nconstrains the variability between stimuli to one or two features (i.e., stimulus dimensions) and means\nthat an exploration of interactions among multiple stimulus features results in a large number of trials,\nintroducing the risk of additional noise arising from participant fatigue.\nMost models of overt visual search involving multifeatured stimuli, suggest two phases; the first\nbeing associated with scanning the visual field for relevant locations and the second being associ-\nated with the more detailed identification, comparison, and evaluation of these image regions (Locher\nThis first phase has been shown to be highly susceptible to the distribution of low-level image features\nover the visual field (saliency; Itti & Koch, 2000) and is characterized by frequent, short fixations\n(Antes, 1974; Glaholt & Reingold, 2009). The second phase introduces top-down effects, for exam-\nUsing an oculomotor signature as an indicator of aesthetic preference 428\nple, driven by the task being performed, the emotional content of the image, or personal preferences\n(Antes, 1974; Glaholt & Reingold, 2009). Over a prolonged viewing period, the two operation modes\nare likely to alternate repeatedly and interact, because participants look for what they like but their\npreferences can also be influenced by what they see (Glaholt & Reingold, 2009; Shimojo et al., 2003).\nThis would suggest that the time course of the eye movements, over and above the cumulative fixation\ntime used in the preferential looking paradigm, is likely to provide substantial information, which re-\nlates to the participant's decision making. A variety of oculomotor measures, other than fixation time,\nare available from an eye tracker, which have, to varying degrees, been correlated with viewing strate-\ngies during visual search, single image viewing, and decision making. These include number, spatial,\nsize (amplitude) which has been show to have an inverse correlation with fixation duration during\nthe later (top-down initiated) phase while viewing artworks (Pannasch et al., 2008). This paper will\nfocus on the spatiotemporal distribution of gaze positions and their associated durations, which should\nalready contain implicit information that also could be derived from analysis of saccade amplitudes.\nTo test whether the oculomotor measures generalize across aesthetic preference tasks, it is im-\nportant that a range of images is evaluated, and four different categories were used in the current\nexperiment. Common small objects and buildings are known to have distinct representations in the\nhuman brain with differing typical locations in the visual field--small objects are typically located\nin the fovea, while buildings are more frequently seen in the peripheral visual field (Aguirre, Zarahn,\n& D'Esposito, 1998; Levy, Hasson, Avidan, Hendler, & Malach, 2001). These two stimulus types\nare used along with familiar packages of commercial products, which represent an everyday exam-\nple of preference-based visual search in visually cluttered environments such as supermarket shelves\n(Van der Lans et al., 2008). We have shown previously that simple images such as monochromatic\nrectangles with varying height to width ratio and colored shapes can be evolved using an evolutionary\nalgorithm in which the fitness of each image is based on the cumulative fixation duration (Holmes &\nZanker, 2008). To link to such work on basic figures, a fourth category of simple colored geometric\nshapes is included in the present study to further validate the generality of the experimental findings.\nWithin each main category, images representing four different types of stimuli (subcategories) are used\nto control for any effects unique to a semantically associated type of image or to a particular class of\nfeatures. In addition to manipulating the image type, the display size and presentation duration are var-\nied in our experiments, with the intention of determining an optimal signal to noise ratio for sampling\naesthetic preference with a view to providing sufficient competition between images without fatiguing\nthe participant. This is particularly important if the signature is to be incorporated in an evolutionary\nalgorithm where competition for a limited resource, such as the attention of the participant, is vital to\nestablish relative preference, or fitness scores, for the images being presented in an iterative process.\n2 General Methods\nSeven participants with normal, or corrected-to-normal, vision were recruited from the Psychology\ndepartment at Royal Holloway, University of London. The project was approved by the institutional\nethics committee.\nSamples of two, four, and eight images from one of four categories, each comprising four subcate-\ngories (see Figure 1), were displayed using a Cambridge Research Systems ViSaGe (Visual Stimulus\nGenerator). Luminance was not normalized across the images, as we were interested in identifying\noculomotor signature that would work despite uncontrolled luminance. Background luminance (white)\nwas 86.3 cd/m2. Stimuli were displayed on a 48-cm diameter cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor at a dis-\ntance of 57 cm from the participant. The physical size of an image on screen ranged from 20 mm 3 30\nmm to 50 mm 3 40 mm. Random sampling without replacement from a set of eight images for each\nsubcategory ensured that no image was displayed more than once in each screen presentation, but the\nsame image could be displayed in more than one trial (in case of eight displayed images, the full set\nwas presented in each trial). This was intended to introduce contextual effects because the aesthetic\nevaluation of each image is relative to the other individuals presented (Shen, Elahipanah, & Reingold,\n2007). Individuals were displayed in a radial fashion (see Figure 2) with their center at 8\u00b0 from a\ncentral fixation cross-hair presented immediately prior to the stimuli, that is, the stimuli were presented\nperipherally with respect to the fixated location at the start of each screen presentation.\nParticipants were presented with samples of images and instructed to look for the image they most\npreferred. The following variables were manipulated:\nDisplay size: Two, four, or eight images randomly placed at the cardinal/ordinal locations.\nExamples of the locations of two, four, or eight image presentations are shown in Figure 2.\nobliterated by a number indicating the button to be pressed to select the image.\nImage category: The images in a single screen presentation were taken from a single subcategory\nof the following categories: objects, buildings, commercial products, or shapes.\nImage subcategory: Each of the four image categories comprised four semantically related\nsubcategories, for example, the shape category featured differently colored circles, squares,\ntriangles, and pentagons. The full list of subcategories is given in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Complete image set for Experiments 1 and 2. All eight images for each category and subcategory\nare shown in one of their 8AFC presentations. Reading top-down and left to right: objects (scissors, cameras,\nwatches, mobile phones); buildings (houses, churches, schools, shops); product packages (Bio powder, color\npowder, bio tablets, color tablets); shapes (circles, triangles, squares, pentagons). Random samples from the set\nof images formed 2AFC and 4AFC presentations. The spatial position of each image was randomly selected for\neach trial, so, for example, the red square could appear in any of the 2/4/8 locations for presentations from the\nsquares subcategory.\nUsing an oculomotor signature as an indicator of aesthetic preference 430\nEach subcategory comprised eight distinct images taken from Google Image searches on the cat-\negory names that were converted to a 256-color bitmap and resized for presentation. The full image\nset is shown in the 8AFC configuration in Figure 1.\nAfter a central fixation cross-hair was displayed for 1,000 ms, participants were presented with a\nnumbers corresponding to buttons on a keypad were displayed at the stimulus locations, obliterating\na large part of each image; this was to ensure that enough of the image was visible so that participants\ndid not need to spend time encoding the spatial location of their preferred image during the image\npresentation stage but were unable to continue evaluating the images after the image presentation time.\nParticipants then indicated their preferred image by pressing the number corresponding to the image\n(see Figure 2) on a physical keypad. No time limit was imposed on the manual response, but partici-\npants were encouraged to do this as quickly as possible. On making their selection, a color noise mask\nwas presented for 250 ms to eradicate after images, before the next trial began.\nA Cambridge Research Systems 50-Hz Video Eye-Tracker (CRS VET) was used to sample raw x and\ny coordinates for gaze location every 20 ms. Fixations were defined as distinct periods of 100 ms or\nmore with gaze location remaining within a 2.5-mm window on the screen, that is, 0.25\u00b0 of visual an-\ngle at a viewing distance of 57 cm. Areas of interest extending 5 mm beyond the edges of each image\nwere used, which corresponds with the 0.5\u00b0 spatial resolution of the eye tracker. Oculomotor measures\nwere calculated as follows:\nDuration was calculated by simply summing the duration of all fixations for each image.\nThe sequence of first fixations was recorded on the basis of the first fixation on an image\nlocation, for example, in the 4AFC condition, a first fixation sequence of (Images 1, 3, or 4)\nwould indicate that Image 1 was fixated first, then Image 3 followed by Image 4, with possible\noff-target fixations and refixations of Image 1 prior to the first fixation of Image 3, possible off-\ntarget fixations and refixations of Images 1 and 3 prior to the first fixation of Image 4 and Image\n2 never being fixated.\nFigure 2. Image positions when two, four, or eight images were presented in a single screen presentation. The\nnumbers shown in each configuration correspond to the button on the numeric keypad used to identify preference\nfor the image at that location.\nLast fixation was recorded as simply the last location fixated prior to images being obliterated\nby the manual selection numbers.\nReturns were defined as distinct refixations, that is, they were separated by at least one fixation\nof a different image or empty space.\nExperiment 1 evaluated the effects that array size and presentation length have on the predictive poten-\ntial of the oculomotor measures. It comprised two stimulus presentations for each of the four catego-\ndisplay sizes of two, four, and eight, that is, 72 trials, for each of the seven participants. All conditions\nwere randomly interleaved, meaning that the participant was unaware of how much time they had to\nlocate their preferred image.\nEach of the oculomotor measures (duration, first fixation, last fixation, returns) was examined for its\ncorrelation with the manually chosen image, that is, the number of times the longest fixation, first\nfixation, last fixation, and most frequently returned to location matched the manually chosen preferred\nlocation was calculated for each participant, for each of the display sizes. If a measure is uncorrelated,\nthen the number of matches should be at chance level (i.e., 50% in the 2AFC condition, 25% in the\n4AFC condition, 12.5% in the 8AFC condition), meaning that the ratio of matches to chance (propor-\ntion of correct matches/chance level for the presentation size) should be 1, with results higher than 1\nindicating a positive correlation and results less than 1 indicating a negative correlation. The results\nfor the ratios of correct matches to chance across the 3 display conditions and 3 presentation durations\nare shown in Figure 3.\nThe results of two-tailed repeated measures ANOVAs, corrected using Bonferroni, for each of the\noculomotor measures showed a significant main effect from the number of images presented: fixation\nthree AFC levels identified significant differences between presentation of two and four images for\nfixation duration (p < .05), presentation of two and eight images for last fixation (p < .05) and returns\n(p < .01), and presentation of four and eight images for last fixation (p < .05) and returns (p < .005). The\nresults of two-tailed repeated measures ANOVAs, corrected using Bonferroni, for each of the oculomo-\ntor measures showed only a marginal main effect from the presentation duration on fixation duration,\nthe interaction between number of images and presentation duration was only significant for fixation\nduration, F(4, 24) = 4.284, p < .05. Post hoc analysis of this interaction for fixation duration revealed\na significant effect from presentation in the 8AFC condition, F(2, 12) = 5.825, p < .05, and from the\nconditions.\nThe results for the returns measure show performance below chance in both the 2AFC and 4AFC\nconditions. This is largely because returns were very scarce in those trials, suggesting that participants\neither did not have enough time to complete first fixations on all the stimuli, as would certainly be\nthe case in the 1,500-ms presentation for eight images, or were able to maintain representations of up\nto four locations in working memory from initial scanning of the images prior to any prolonged fixa-\ntion based on preference. Overall, the results clearly show an increased performance above chance\non all measures when the participant is presented with more choice, that is, the oculomotor statistics\nare more informative when there are more candidates to be evaluated, with little or no effect from\nextended presentation time, especially for the single fixation measures.\nThe second experiment evaluated the effects that image category and presentation length have on the\npredictive potential of the oculomotor measures. It comprised four stimulus presentations with a fixed\nms each, that is, 192 trials for each of the three participants, selected from the initial seven. This meant\nthat the participants saw images from Experiment 1 supplemented by images they had never seen be-\nUsing an oculomotor signature as an indicator of aesthetic preference 432\nfore. Randomization of the location of the images meant that participants were highly unlikely to see\nthe same arrangement viewed in the 8AFC condition in the first experiment. As before, all conditions\nwere randomly interleaved, meaning that the participant was unaware of how much time they had to\nlocate their preferred image.\nFigure 4 shows little difference in the overall performance of the four oculomotor measures for the\nfour categories, with all performing better than chance. The results of two-tailed repeated measures\nANOVAs, corrected using Bonferroni, for each of the oculomotor measures showed only a significant\nmain effect from the category for first fixation (F(3, 6) = 11.271, p < .05). There was a significant\nmain effect from the presentation duration for the returns measure (F(2, 4) = 17.777, p < .05), and a\nsignificant main effect from the interaction of category and duration for first fixation (F(6, 12) = 4.723,\np < .05). No significant effect was observed between subcategories of image type for any of the four\nmajor categories.\nThese results are similar to those for the 8AFC condition in the Experiment 1 and suggest that the\nimage type had little effect on the measures. The strong performance of the first fixation measure in\nthe 1,500-ms shape is probably a result of the simplicity of the eight images being used in each of the\ntrials allowing an almost reflexive saccade to be made to the preferred color in later trials. The consist-\nent improvement in the performance of the returns measure for longer presentation times across all\nimage types confirms the importance of this behavior when making comparative preference choices\nand suggests that in the absence of prior knowledge of the image characteristics, this might be the best\nsingle indicator of preference.\nFigure 3. Ratio of number of times the four oculomotor measure corresponds with the subsequent manual AFC\nselection, relative to chance levels: (a) fixation duration; (b) first fixation; (c) last fixation; (d) returns. Consistent\nimprovements are visible across measures with increased number of images, with no consistent effect from\npresentation duration. Results are averaged over 24 trials for each condition, N 5 7. Bars show standard error.\n4.1 Oculomotor signature\nThe results from Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that predictive potential of each of the oculomotor meas-\nures depends on the size of the stimulus sample and duration of presentation while only being mildly\naffected by the image category and, in this case, associated image complexity. Figure 5 shows an\nexample of the cumulative fixation plot for a single participant (P4) in a single trial (5,000 ms, 8AFC,\nbuildings category). From this plot, it can be seen that neither the first image fixated nor the image be-\ning fixated at the end of the trial was identified as the preferred image by the viewer, highlighting the\nproblem with single fixation measures, as the first fixation is made without information about the other\nchoices available, and the final fixation might be made after a decision has been made.\nThe number of times first fixation matches the selected preference, expressed as a percentage of\nall trials in which at least one image was accurately fixated (396 of the 6 3 72 = 432 trials reported in\nExperiment 1), is shown in Figure 6 for all items presented. Here, it can clearly be seen that the first\nitem fixated is less likely to reflect the final selection as both presentation duration and presentation\nsize increases and although always above chance for the display size, as choice and presentation time\nincrease, late fixated items are increasingly likely to correlate with the manual preference selection.\nHowever, this presents a problem for a cumulative duration-based fitness evaluation, as the later an\nitem is first fixated, the less chance it has to accumulate a long fixation duration. This suggests the need\nto weight the fixation duration according to the lateness of the first fixation for each item.\nOn the basis of these observations and the group results for Experiments 1 and 2, a new oculomo-\ntor measure, or \"signature,\" was calculated using a multiplicative weighting which effectively scales\nthe cumulative fixation duration, according to the likelihood that this image will be the preferred\nimage, using the sequence of first fixations and the number of returns (distinct refixations after first\nfixation) to the image, as follows:\nFigure 4. Ratio of number of times the four oculomotor measure corresponds with the subsequent manual AFC\nselection, relative to chance levels: (a) fixation duration; (b) first fixation; (c) last fixation; (d) returns. Results\nare averaged by image category (object, building, package, or shape) over 16 trials for each category and each\npresentation duration (192 trials in total), N 5 3.

In addition, this work provides further support for the gaze cascade model\n(Glaholt & Reingold, 2009; Shimojo et al., 2003) which suggests an increase in sustained interest that\nis visible from fixations late in the presentation period. This correlation between accumulated fixation\nduration and consciously expressed preference also lies at the heart of the gaze-driven evolutionary\nalgorithm (Holmes & Zanker, 2008) and the results from Experiments 1 and 2 further support the use\nof eye movements as a fitness measure for aesthetic preference. This is because the fixation duration\nrepresents a \"better than chance\" indication of preference and so can be used to provide the selection\npressure needed to drive an evolutionary optimization process. Early versions of the algorithm relied\non the specification of a task, such as \"look for your preferred shape,\" to motivate the participant's eye\nmovements. While the active selection of a pleasing and stimulating visual environment has been sug-\ngested to be a background task for humans (Berlyne, 1971; Biederman & Vessel, 2006), an oculomotor\nsignature, such as that developed here, which correlates with such a task could now be incorporated\nin a free viewing version of the paradigm, which simply requires the participant to look at the images\nevolving on screen without any explicit task specification. The removal of task specification, as well as\nconsciously articulated response, would provide a language-independent means for exploring complex\npreferences relating to aesthetics. Early results using stimuli inspired by Op Artist Bridget Riley sug-\ngest that the signature in Equation 3 can be used to generate aesthetically pleasing complex patterns in\nClearly, the oculomotor signature developed here does not represent a comprehensively optimized\nmodel for preferential looking, which would need to incorporate parameters for the presentation dura-\ntion, the image complexity, and the complexity of the decision-making task, perhaps using pupilom-\netry with respect to the amount and variety of the choice (Holmes, 2010). However, the improved cor-\nrelation between looking and preference could facilitate better fitness estimation than fixation duration\nalone in gaze-based computer interactions where aesthetic preference is used to drive an optimization\nalgorithm (Holmes & Zanker, 2008). The improved correlation between the new oculomotor signa-\nture and aesthetic preference would increase the selection pressure in that evolutionary algorithm and\naccelerate the location of highly fit solutions (Goldberg, 1989) allowing more complex image spaces\nhas important consequences for the nonreductionist investigation of visual aesthetic preference, since\nsuch an approach is dependent on the availability of techniques which can manipulate and search\ncomplex images.\nThe present experiments highlight the importance of the presentation time for the preferential\nlooking paradigm with normally functioning adults, especially with a measure such as the returns\nmeasure used here. If presentations are too short for the number and complexity of images being\ncompared, then there is insufficient time to complete the bottom-up\u00addriven location phase of visual\nsearch before initiating the top-down\u00addriven identification phase (Locher et al., 2007; Van der Lans\net al., 2008), which is important for a meaningful response to an aesthetic preference task (Glaholt &\nReingold, 2009). With short presentation times, it is possible that gaze-based measures such as the one\nproposed here might better reflect image saliency than image preference (Itti & Koch, 2000), although\nmore recent evidence suggests that the looking behavior changes less during the course of viewing\nthan previously thought (Tatler, Hayhoe, Land, & Ballard, 2007), meaning that the benefit from pro-\nlonged exposure might simply be the result of longer fixations later in the time course (Glaholt & Rein-\ngold, 2009). However, this interaction between a feed-forward and a feedback loop raises a question of\ncausality: Does fixation precede preference or preference precede fixation? Clearly, correlation results\nsuch as those presented here cannot resolve this, and further investigation of this is needed. However,\nthe inclusion of this signature in a task-independent gaze-driven evolutionary algorithm does present\nan opportunity for learning general trends in a participant's preference, through the frequencies of\nspecific image features in final population, and these can then be used to generate previously unseen\nstimuli for a forced-choice task where the presentation duration is manipulated to verify the effects of\ntiming on actual preference (Zanker et al., 2010).\nThe oculomotor signature developed here is a quantitative behavioral measure which can be\nused to evaluate aesthetic preference with highly complex visual stimuli without any prior knowl-\nedge as to the contribution to that preference from individual features. As such, it already addresses\nseveral concerns with experimental research into aesthetics including the ambiguity of qualitative\nmethodologies (Arnheim, 1974) and the unreliability of conscious reflection on subjective decisions\n(Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). Advances in technology are resulting in eye trackers that are more accurate,\neasier to use, and more affordable. Moreover, off-the-shelf portable eye trackers now present the possi-\nbility to study such signature oculomotor behaviors away from the laboratory facilitating quantitative\nevaluation of artworks in their original forms as they were meant to be seen. It seems that in addition\nto beauty itself and understanding of beauty might lie in the eyes of the beholder.\n"
