These emergent research\napproaches are not necessarily exclusive of Western scien-\ntifically oriented methods (Jones, Ingham, Cram, Dean, &\nhowever, require adaptation and interrogation of method-\nological impact upon participants and Indigenous peoples\n(Durie, 2004). Effective application of integrated methodol-\nogies requires consideration of cultural sensitivity and cross-\ncultural reliability for the reconciliation of academic research\npriorities with diverse participant realities (Saini, 2012).\nTension is evident for researchers balancing representation\nof participants' realities and the need to conform to conven-\ntionality and rationality of \"acceptable\" Western science\u00ad\nbased research protocols (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014; Ritenbaugh\net al., 2008). The power embedded in the underlying philoso-\nphy of research methodologies must be acknowledged (Carr,\n2002). Furthermore, if comparisons are to be made between\nhealth systems grounded in divergent worldviews, with con-\ntrasting definitions of well-being (Connor, 2012), research-\ners must possess expertise in the system being studied as\nwell as in the research methods being applied (Durie, 2004).\nThe potential for revelation of insights from TCAM and\nIndigenous knowledge systems is being limited by polarized\nviews of legitimacy and validity between research paradigms\n\"rules\" of research can act as a control mechanism and risk\nthe assimilation of traditional knowledge, under the guise of\nfacilitating \"legitimate\" discourse (Saini, 2012). Indigenous\nscience provides empirical evidence, gathered over the cen-\nturies and sustained by oral or codified traditions, that is\nalready available to look to for insights (Winkelman, 2009).\nLiterature included in this synthesis indicates recent research\nin TCAM, and Indigenous healing is less interested in find-\ning new information. Rather, it seeks to validate what those\nsystems already know and to translate that knowledge into\nlanguage and measures that can be understood according to\nTCAM encompasses knowledge of healing systems from\naround the globe, including Indigenous medicine traditions\n(Hollenburg, Zakus, Cook, & Xu, 2008).These healing systems\n1University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand\nCorresponding Author:\nRay Kirk, Associate Professor, School of Health Sciences, University of\nEmail: ray.kirk@canterbury.ac.nz\nBridging Indigenous and Western\nSciences: Research Methodologies\nfor Traditional, Complementary, and\nAlternative Medicine Systems\nAmy Massey1 and Ray Kirk1\n Keywords\nepistemology, methodology, research paradigms, TCAM, Indigenous science, narrative synthesis\n2 SAGE Open\nprovide ancient and living knowledge of therapeutic strate-\ngies for health based on the experiences of culturally or geo-\ngraphically defined groups. Examples include Ayurveda\nand yoga, the traditional healing systems of India, and tradi-\ntional Chinese medicine (TCM) (Patwardhan, Warude,\nPushpangadan, & Bhatt, 2005). Indigenous healing systems\nhave roots in various Indigenous cultures (Winkelman,\n2009).Although they shareTCAM classification (Hollenburg\net al., 2008), Indigenous medicine systems are uniquely\ncharacterized by oral traditions, distinct languages, the\nimportance of community, and the view that human health is\ninterconnected with the earth (Robbins & Dewar, 2011). The\nexample included in this article is Rongoa Mori, traditional\nMori medicine in Aotearoa, New Zealand (McGowan,\n2009). In many places around the globe, TCAM remain the\nmost accessible systems of health care. Although the bio-\nmedical system is dominant in New Zealand and other colo-\nnized, Westernized countries, TCAM coexist--even though\nbiomedicine has questioned and, in some cases, discounted\ntheir efficacy. The resultant state of medical pluralism is\ncommon to modern societies (Winkelman, 2009).\nThe role of research in TCAM, including Indigenous\nhealing traditions, is debated (Durie, 2004; Coulter, Lewith,\nWith increasing rates of acceptance and use (Coulter et al.,\neffectiveness and safety of TCAM is important. Not only\ndoes it assure the protection of its users, it also holds poten-\ntial to reveal greater knowledge and resources for health. The\nquestion for researchers is how to both evaluate evidence of\nhealing capacity and access the fullest meaning of data gath-\nered from distinct worldviews (Coulter et al., 2014).\nThis article explores the interface between TCAM and\nWestern science, with a narrative synthesis of emergent and\nIndigenous research approaches for the investigation of\nwhole systems of healing. This narrative synthesis works to\nbridge discourses by demonstrating the potentiality, applica-\nbility, and credibility of research methodologies representa-\ntive of distinct worldviews. It acts as yet another strand in the\nweaving of knowledge across typical discipline and sector\nboundaries (Chacko, 2003). Ultimately, this synthesis aims\nto make a contribution to the transfer of knowledge between\nIndigenous and Western scientific paradigms (Saini, 2012)\nfor the enrichment of health practices and greater choice in\nhealth care.\nBackground\n\"Research is methodology.\" Methodology guides the way\nresearch questions are applied in the field, allowing the\nresearcher to make statements about the significance of results\nor outcomes (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002). Methodology,\ntherefore, provides the rationale for methods used to produce\n\"valid\" knowledge. Knowledge is considered valid only if it is\nproduced in ways conforming to methods prescribed by a\nchosen research methodology. Methodology claims a knowl-\nedge of its own in asserting certain procedures. An aptly\nselected methodology will justify decisions of the researcher\nand prove necessity of researcher actions. While research\nmethods are justified by the methodology, the methodology\nis justified by an underlying philosophy. Access to the func-\ntions of methodology, from conception of research questions\nto drawing of conclusions, is provided by exploration of rela-\ntionships between the methodology's philosophy and the\nresearched subject. There is immense power in the philoso-\nphy of methodology that is assumed superior in its ability to\njudge and validate claims to truth made by the research sub-\nject (Carr, 2002). Truth is an ever-evolving creation (Cajete,\n2004). To look beyond current knowledge, a researcher must\ndevelop capacity to see their subject through different lenses.\nThis is the place for new methodology, seeking not only evi-\ndence but also meaning from the data (Clough & Nutbrown,\nIn its broadest sense, the Latin root of science, scientia,\nmeans knowledge. The term Western science has been used\nwith a degree of exclusivity since the 20th century to refer to\nofficially sanctioned knowledge of positivist inquiry, sup-\nported and acknowledged by governing bodies. As a domi-\nnant, global system of knowledge, Western science has\nserved as a basis for research investigating efficacy and\neffectiveness of health care, including Indigenous and\nTCAM healing practices. Aspects of knowledge from\nIndigenous healing and traditional medicine systems may\nconflict with the rationale of Western science or may be mis-\nunderstood in codified or highly metaphoric oral information\nsystems. But that does not make this knowledge unscientific.\nRather, it makes it scientific knowledge of a different kind\n(Snively & Corsiglia, 1998). Indigenous science is empirical\nknowledge founded in processes of revelation, traditional\nteachings, and empirical observation in real-life settings over\nIndigenous science as relative to both scientific knowledge\nof long-time resident, usually oral-culture, populations (as in\nIndigenous healing traditions), and scientific knowledge of\npersons within a society, affected by the interests and world-\nviews of their own community (as in TCAM). Traditional\necological knowledge is a richly documented example of\nIndigenous science. It also serves as an example of an\nIndigenous science being \"rediscovered\" by Western science\nresearchers, looking to traditional local knowledge which\nWestern Science claims to legitimize, in endeavors such as\nbioprospecting (Battiste & Henderson, 2000). Binary discus-\nsions of Western science and Indigenous science are now\nconverging as significant Indigenous knowledge is tran-\nscribed and acknowledged as equally valid according to rela-\ntivist, rather than universal, notions of science (Snively &\nNonetheless, the application of research methodologies in\nconcordance withWestern scientific criteria can lead research-\ners to draw conclusions according to Eurocentric scientific\nMassey and Kirk 3\nthinking. Indigenous and culturally derived traditional\nknowledge has its own distinct philosophies and understand-\nings of health. Rationalization of this knowledge for coinci-\ndence with Western scientific principles is taking data out of\nits true context, rendering it meaningless in the absence of\nthe overarching principles of knowledge. Indigenous knowl-\nedge cannot be sufficiently assessed by Western scientific\nIndigenous research as a site of struggle between Indigenous\nknowing and Western interests. Tuhiwai-Smith (1999) fur-\nther noted injustices of colonization and research for their\nsignificant impacts upon Indigenous populations, regulating\nand realizing an underlying code of imperialism with scien-\ntific paradigms, scholarly disciplines, and the individuals\nand institutions supporting them. It is significant to\nacknowledge that practices that constitute folk medicine in\none society may in fact represent professional practice in\nanother, according to differences in local power structures\nConsiderable numbers of people use complementary and\nalternative medicine (CAM) in both developing and devel-\noped nations, many of them well educated (Chacko, 2003;\nWinkelman, 2009). As attitudes are changing so too health\nservices are changing. At one time competing and marginal-\nized, doctors are now training in modalities such as acupunc-\nture and herbal medicine; holistic health professionals are\nintegrating use of stethoscopes and practicing alongside\nmedical practitioners; and, Indigenous frameworks are being\nintroduced for provision of more holistic, culturally compe-\ntent care. Thus, the distinction between biomedical and com-\nplementary health sectors is no longer absolute (Winkelman,\nThere are calls for further scientific research documenting\nclinical evidence of efficacy to support access to and utiliza-\ntion of complementary and alternative practices alongside\nbiomedical practices (Wellcome Trust, 2000). There is also\nalready a multitude of other information sources providing\n\"clinical\" evidence already in existence; for example, identi-\nfiable patterns in long-standing traditional use, similar appli-\ncations in various areas of the world, and congruencies found\nbetween pharmacological, biomedical properties of healing\nagents, and the pathophysiology of disease (Winkelman,\n2009). The development of research methodologies can sup-\nport a fuller understanding of TCAM and Indigenous prac-\ntices as whole systems of healing and the place for these\nmodalities in provision of modern health services.\nObjectives\nThis article presents a narrative synthesis that identifies and\ncompares methodologies used in the evaluation of traditional\nhealing practices. In considering the aim(s), suitability, and\nvalidity of each approach, contributions can be made to the\ninterpretation of research findings for maximum receptivity\nto learnings brought to light in a meeting ground between\ntwo distinct worldviews (Popay et al., 2006).\nMethod of Synthesis\nFollowing the protocol guidance of Popay and colleagues\n(2006), this article provides a narrative synthesis of articles\napplying either or both Indigenous and Western research\nmethodologies to evaluate effectiveness of various healing\napproaches. From the synthesis, this article also considers\nthe potential for transference of findings between knowledge\nsystems.\nPopay and colleagues (2006) described narrative synthe-\nsis as a form of trustworthy story telling. Just as story telling\nis central to the sustaining and transmission of knowledge\namong Indigenous cultures, the nature of this narrative syn-\nthesis aims to bring evidence together to tell a story about\nlong-established practices and newly determining research\napproaches for the sharing of knowledge that can enrich\nhealth systems and health care practices.\nFour main elements of a narrative synthesis detailed in the\ngeneral framework provided by Popay and colleagues (2006)\nand relevant to this research involve theorizing how, why,\nand for whom certain research methodologies work; organiz-\ning a preliminary synthesis of research findings; looking for\nrelationships within the data; and assessing the robustness of\nthe data and the data synthesis. First, the lead author sur-\nveyed studies considering whether or not the research inter-\nventions achieved objectives, for whom they were effective,\nand why they may have been effective. This initial survey of\nthe data enabled selection of studies utilizing a range of\nmethodologies and preliminary assessment of applicability\nfor this narrative synthesis. Next, factors seen to be facilitat-\ning research implementation or acting as barriers in imple-\nmentation were identified and organized thematically for\nfurther exploration. These relationships in the data were then\ninvestigated to understand why and how the research was\nundertaken and why the interventions had an effect, if any.\nFindings have been expanded upon for generalizability and\nrelevance in different contexts.\nAppropriately, the protocol for narrative synthesis does\nnot rely upon any one authoritative system of knowledge or\nrigorously tested techniques. However, as the Cochrane\nhandbook (Higgins & Green, 2011) highlights, it is possible\nsuch a narrative approach to the synthesis of data may be\nprone to bias or generate unsound conclusions. These prob-\nlems are not limited to narrative synthesis. Statistical tech-\nniques can equally produce misleading results and may also\nbe reported with bias, as this synthesis later demonstrates.\nSomewhat aligned with the motivation for this synthesis,\nthere is also a need for methodological strengthening of this\nnarrative technique. The authors have aimed to address this\nneed by way of application of Popay and colleagues' (2006)\nguidance.\n4 SAGE Open\nStudy Selection\nAtotal of 14 articles were included in the primary synthesis and\nappraisal of research quality, considered together with exten-\nsive supplementary reading of background information and\narticles related to content of the studies. The retrieval strategy\nfor studies to be included involved electronic bibliographic\ndatabase searches of EMBASE and MEDLINE, generating\n304 and 12 studies, respectively. The search returned articles\nreporting research in multifarious modalities broadly classified\nas CAM. Only those studies with specific reference to healing\npractices with Indigenous or cultural origins in long-established\ntraditional knowledge systems were included. Acknowledging\nthe diversity and depth of Indigenous and TCAM healing tradi-\ntions, the authors have focused on four systems, including\nRongoa,Ayurveda, yoga, and TCM. The selection of these sys-\ntems is based on, and limited by, the authors' relevant training\nand familiarity with these traditional medicine systems. Further\nlimits were applied to source articles using human participants,\npublished since the year 2000, and reported in English lan-\nguage. The search criteria used for both databases was\n([Complementary medicine or alternative medicine] or [tradi-\ntional medicine or Indigenous medicine] or [integrative medi-\ncine]) AND ([qualitative research] or [quantitative study] or\n[methodology or mixed methods])AND ([Ayurveda] or [yoga]\nor [Rongoa] or [Chinese medicine]). It was necessary to sup-\nplement these database searches with the use of Google Scholar\nto find research articles representative of Kaupapa Mori\napproaches. Resources from relevant websites, such as the\nWorld Health Organization and Association of Ayurvedic\nProfessionals, and resources provided by University of\nCanterbury teaching staff were also examined for relevant\ncontent.\nEach of the studies selected evaluates TCAM healing\npractices and/or the associated healing experience. Articles\nwere chosen to represent diverse research methodologies uti-\nlizing either or both Indigenous scientific research designs\nand/or Western scientific research standards, making it pos-\nsible to consider compatibility of methods and transfer of\nlearnings between knowledge systems (Saini, 2012).\nWith methodological, observational, and analytical con-\ntributions from fields of anthropology, geography, biology,\nconservation, education, social science, history, and public\nand clinical health, the research reviewed in this article is\nevidence of the multidisciplinary expertise culminating in\nemergent methodologies for research in TCAM and\nIndigenous healing systems. Its relevance reaches far beyond\nhealth and political sectors. Its primary impact is upon the\npeople to whom this knowledge belongs, the Indigenous\ncommunities of our world, and its potential impact is for the\nhealth of all people. The purpose and positionality of each\nresearch article is examined with reference to these wider\nperspectives. Certain characteristics of researchers' method-\nological choices are discussed, making explicit connections\nbetween methodological assumptions, relevance of data, and\nthe obtaining of multiple meaning from the data (with use of\ninterpretive analyses and researcher-led reporting).\nFindings\nResearch Methodologies\nA multiscience perspective (Ogawa, 1995) is valuable when\nconsidering suitability of research methodologies. With\naccess to two systems of knowledge, researchers investigat-\ning TCAM, and especially Indigenous healing, must bridge\nany \"divide\" between Western scientific and Indigenous sci-\nentific paradigms (see \"Background\" section; Durie, 2004).\nDetermining a valid research design is fundamental. At polar\nends of the debate, the position of researchers trained in bio-\nmedical methodologies may consider knowledge as valid\nonly when it is verified in a randomized double-blind, con-\ntrolled trial. Whereas critics of biomedical methodologies\nmaintain that evaluation of traditional medicines according\nto concepts of biomedicine may fail to produce true knowl-\nedge, owing to a dependence on scientific vocabulary and\ndesign criteria representative of imperialistic, Westernized\nways of thinking (Tilburt & Kaptchuk, 2008). It may be sig-\nnificant to recognize many Indigenous people living in\ndeveloped countries are already living in the divide, informed\nby both Western science and Indigenous science. There\nwithin may be the greatest opportunity for innovation: allow-\ning each system its own integrity while developing research\napproaches that incorporate elements of both for maximum\nrelevance and creation of new knowledge (Durie, 2004).\nTe Karu et al., 2013) reveal a new frame of thinking indica-\ntive of a coming together of Indigenous and Western scien-\ntific bodies of knowledge, sustaining credibility of both\nWestern Science\u00adBased Methodologies\nThe World Health Organization's (2002) First Global\nStrategy on Traditional and Alternative Medicine supports\nclinical research and evaluation of traditional medicine's\nefficacy in treating certain diseases while also acknowledg-\ning challenges of incomparable methodologies and termi-\nnologies.

Although\nthe chosen methodology is consistent, in actuality, there is\nvariance in application of the methodology.\nKligler and colleagues (2011) assessed yoga as a comple-\nmentary strategy in an integrative treatment for asthma among\nMassey and Kirk 5\nevaluated combined effectiveness of an integrated, lifestyle-\noriented treatment program in clinical status as well as qual-\nity of life (QoL).Adouble-blind control protocol was deemed\nimpractical and unethical, making a rigorous study design a\nchallenge.

The\nresults of this study are particularly noteworthy for the vari-\nance in outcomes between measures. Clinical testing of pul-\nmonary function tests revealed no change. However,\nstatistical analysis of the QoL survey showed both overall\nand disease-specific QoL improved significantly. These\nresults indicate improvements are mediated by mechanisms\nnot physiologically attributable to effects on airway inflam-\nAs the first clinical trial of its kind, Ritenbaugh et al.\n(2008) researched TCM as an individualized, whole system\napproach to treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders\nand compared outcomes with naturopathy and standard care\noptions. Whole systems research aims to maintain theoretical\ncongruency with the system of medicine being investigated.\nTreatments were not provided in isolation, rather within a\nframework that fostered development of health-enhancing\nbehaviors, including dietary habits, exercise, and stress\nrelease practices. Subjective reports were quantified using\nlinearly interpolated values. Standard care, naturopathy, and\nTCM groups all reported positive change, though TCM pro-\nvided most effective pain relief. Divergent of the classical\ngold standard of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), the\nstudy was limited by sample size with 160 randomized\npatients, inconsistencies in treatment duration between\ngroups, and changes made to reduce participant burden and\nprovide rapid pain relief. However, as the first study of its\nkind, the authors are quick to point out the exploratory nature\nof the research and the greater importance of providing guid-\nance for future studies as opposed to rigorous adherence to\nmethodology.\nIn contrast, Macklin et al. (2006) focused exclusively on\nacupuncture, as an aspect of TCM. Macklin and colleagues\n(2006) emphasized soundness and validity of research\nbased on a large sample size and rigorous adherence to both\nresearch methodology and TCM principles. Three groups\nwere provided acupuncture treatment, using the following:\nacupuncture points individualized according to TCM diag-\nnosis; preselected, standardized acupuncture points; or\nsham points not correlated with acupuncture points. Despite\nvariable changes in blood pressure recorded for all groups\nthroughout treatment duration, Macklin et al. (2006)\nreported no significant benefits for individualized or stan-\ndardized treatment versus sham acupuncture. For all the\nreported validity of the methodology, the researcher's\napplication does not fit with recent recommendations for\nstudy in the maturing field of acupuncture research,\nrequiring either application of whole system interventions\nor a more mechanistic focus to understand how each\ntreatment component translates into a physiological out-\nIndigenous Science\u00adBased Methodologies\nIndigenous research methodologies are predicated on the\nlegitimacy and validity of Indigenous knowledge and philoso-\nphy, including language and culture (Tuhiwai-Smith, 1999).\nBeliefs of participants are not only protected, they are also\nendorsed in the research process (Durie, 2004).
