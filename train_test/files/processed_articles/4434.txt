Government employed technologies to speed up the process. Among banking technologies, mobile banking\nappeared as a possible solution for financial exclusion with wide mobile phone coverage. Inputs on rural people's intention\ntoward technologies for effective financial inclusion were essential. Technology adoption factors, performance expectancy,\neffort expectancy, social influence, attitude, perceived risk, and behavioral intention (BI), were short listed after literature\nreview. Factors were subjected to reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multiple regression, and interaction analysis.\nRural provinces in Karnataka state were surveyed. We used mixed sampling technique to reach 959 samples. Multiple\nregression\u00adinteraction analysis revealed age and gender moderated attitude's path toward BI.\n",

RBI aimed rules for\nmobile banking transactions in 2008. Daily transactions limit\naimed IT and banking services to 600 million new customers\n(Ketkar etal., 2012). Mobile banking guidelines emphasized\nsafety, efficiency, and accessibility (RBI, 2014).\nDonner (2008) found more mobile phones possessions\nthan bank accounts in the world.

Potnis and Deosthali (2012)\npointed the need to find factors that explain electronic bank-\ning resistance.\nData comparison of the world with two growing nations,\nIndia and Bangladesh, confirms that mobile phones outnum-\nber bank accounts (Table 1).

Jensen (2007) highlighted the dig-\nital divide as a major issue in developed and developing\ncountries. Burrell and Anderson (2008) brought out advan-\ntages of mobile phones in constrained situations. Indian\nbanks used business correspondents for inclusive banking\nwith less success. Banking technology is essential for effec-\ntive inclusion (Chung & Kwon, 2009; Duncombe & Boateng,\nResearch Gap 2\nAccording to Ravichandran and Rai (2000), technology\nadoption requires active user participation. Developing\nnations face resistance in technology implementation\n(Kleijnen, Wetzels, & de Ruyter, 2004). Suoranta and Mattila\n(2004) expressed concern on low mobile banking adoption\nrates in the world. Riivari (2005) and Y.-S.

Subobjectives assess the relationship of\nindependent variables, performance expectancy (PE), effort\nexpectancy (EE), social influence (SI), attitude, and per-\nceived risk (PR), with dependent variable, behavioral inten-\ntion (BI). The study also attempts to measure moderation of\nage and gender on PE, EE, SI, and attitude's path toward BI.\n4 SAGE Open\nPrior Research and Theoretical\nBackground\nIn literature review, various theoretical models in IT/IS\ndomain were reviewed. Conceptual models had roots in psy-\nchology and sociology explaining technology acceptance\n(Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Technology adoption was a dis-\ntinguished area in IS research (Benbasat & Barki, 2007;\nFishbein and Ajzen (1975) introduced \"Theory of\nReasoned Action\" (TRA). TRA had three variables, namely,\nBI, attitude, and subjective norm. In 1980, Ajzen and\nFishbein revised TRA as \"Theory of Planned Behavior\"\n(TPB) later known as \"Decomposed Theory of Planned\nBehavior\" (DTPB). DTPB used relative advantage, compat-\nibility, and risk variables. These variables belonged to\nDiffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, also known as\nInnovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). Rogers (1995) intro-\nduced DOI with five attributes: relative advantage, complex-\nity, trialability, compatibility, and observability. Out of five\nvariables in DOI, relative advantage, complexity, and com-\npatibility were consistently related to innovation adoption.\nDavis in 1986 studied computer-usage behavior. Davis\n(1989) improved TRA framework to Technology Acceptance\nModel (TAM) with perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived\nease of use (PEOU) as basic factors. Venkatesh and Davis\nusage intention from SI perspective.\nTAM was influential and famous. Various empirical plat-\nforms tested TAM for measurement validity. Adoption stud-\nies based on TAM investigated simple technologies. TAM\nstudies used teenagers and students in universities.\nGeneralization of findings was questionable (Legris, Ingham,\nVenkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis (2003) had already\nintroduced Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of\nTechnology (UTAUT). UTAUT explained the adoption of\ncomplex technologies like online bulletin boards and instant\nmessengers, online stock trading (Yang, 2005), electronic\nmarketplaces (Y.-S. Wang et\nmerce adoption in Finland (Carlsson, Waiden, & Bouwman,\nadoption studies on TAM and stressed on the need to look\nbeyond TAM. UTAUT is a powerful framework (Goodhue,\n2007). There are limited studies on UTAUT investigating\nmobile banking adoption (Samudra & Phadtare, 2012).\nResearch Gap 5\nUTAUT condenses 32 variables not only from TAM but also\nfrom Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) by Bandura (1977) and\nCompeau and Higgins (1995), Model of Personal Computer\nUsage (MPCU) by Triandis (1977) and Thompson, Higgins,\nand Howell (1991), and Motivational Model (MM) by Davis,\nBagozzi, and Warshaw (1992). UTAUT helped to study\nmind-sets of people at organizational and nonorganizational\nenvironments. Johns (2006) and Alvesson and K\u00e4rreman\n(2007) suggested borrowing and experimenting variables\nimprove a theory. Moderating variable (MV) inclusion in\nUTAUT boosts its ability to measure interaction effects\n(Bagozzi, 2007). Three types of UTAUT extensions are as\nfollows:\n1. Studying new users (Yi, Jackson, Park, & Probst,\n2006), new technologies (Chang, Hwang, Hung, &\nLi, 2007), and new cultural settings (B. Gupta etal.,\n2.

Initially, UTAUT catered to technology accep-\ntance explanation in organizations. Later, the framework was\nalso used to study consumer technologies as it was a multi-\nbillion dollar industry (Llamas & Stofega, 2010). Basic con-\nstructs of UTAUT, PE, EE, SI, and facilitating condition\nconsistently measured BI. Innovations and perceived enjoy-\nment constructs effectively measured actual usage (Thakur,\nHypothesis Development\nVariables PE, EE, SI, and BI are from UTAUT. Study\ndropped facilitating condition variable as its items measured\nafter sales service aspect. Study has added attitude and PR\nvariables to theoretical framework from TAM as each exper-\niment is a quest for more knowledge (Alvesson & K\u00e4rreman,\nPE. PE describes the extent of benefits technology offers in a\nstated, \"If a system doesn't assist its users performing jobs, it\nis not received.\" PE consistently relates to BI at voluntary\n(nonorganizational) and involuntary (organizational) settings\nWe can compare PE with relative advantage (McCloskey,\nin TAM (Venkatesh et\nPikkarainen, Pikkarainen, Karjaluoto, and Pahnila (2004)\nand Cheong and Park (2005) uphold PU's role in technology\nadoption studies. Eriksson, Kerem, and Nilsson (2005);\nLuarn and Lin (2005), and Chiu, Hsu, Sun, Lin, and Sun\nKishore and Sequeira 5\n(2005) linked PU to BI supported by Guriting and Ndubisi\n(2006). PU helped to study performance aspects in technol-\nogy adoption. Venkatesh and Bala (2008), Chung and Kwon\nPadashetty and Krishna (2013) studied and validated PU\nperformance.\nPE was consistently related to BI in adoption studies of\nproductivity in the workplace (O'Cass & Grace, 2004; Yang,\n2005), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), phones\n(Nysveen, Pedersen, & Thorbjornsen, 2005b), and mobile\ncommerce (Y.-S. Wang etal., 2006). Lai, Lai, and Jordan\nWang (2010); Bumguardner, Strong, Murphrey, and Dooley\ninfluences BI. This leads us to hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): PE about mobile banking service\ntechnology has a positive impact on user's intention to\nadopt it.\nEE. EE was consistently related to BI in both organizational\nand nonorganizational settings. EE effectively measures\ntechnology adoption behavior in pretechnology implementa-\ntion stages. Postimplementation studies cannot access details\nof product/service features (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000). EE\nis ease of learning a technology (Meuter, Ostrom, Roundtree,\n2003). EE evolved from PEOU and complexity variable.\nComplex technologies face resistance (Y. E. Lee & Benbasat,\nUsability characteristics explain PEOU (Lederer, Maupin,\netal. (2003) have linked EE to PEOU as they both measure\ncomplexity levels in technology usage. Better ease of use\nVrechopoulos, Constantiou, Sideris, Doukidis, &\nMylonopoulos, 2003). Ease of use in mobile services is a\ncrucial factor for adoption (C. Kim, Mirusmonov, & Lee,\nAccording to Venkatesh (2000), inexperienced people in\nsurveys respond based on beliefs. PEOU was strongly related\nto BI in TAM, TAM2, and combined technology acceptance\nmodel and technology planned behavior (C-TAM-TPB;\nVenkatesh et\nal., 2003; Y.-S. Wang, Wang, Lin, & Tang,\n2003). There are various aspects of experience (Luarn & Lin,\nAmin, Hamid, Lada, and Anis (2008) observed the PEOU's\nrelationship with BI in mobile banking service adoption.\nPEOU was also used by AL Rawashdeh, Abu-Errub, Areiqat,\nand Dbbaghieh (2012) to study e-learning adoption, Internet\npass delivery adoption (M. Y. Wu, Yu, & Weng, 2012),\ne-books adoption (Gao & Deng, 2012), and interaction board\nFoon and Fah (2011); Pappas, Giannakos, Pateli, and\nChrissikopoulos (2011); Yahya, Nadzar, Masrek, and\nvalidated significant relationship of EE and BI. Hence, we\nhypothesized the following:\nHypothesis 2 (H2): EE about mobile banking service\ntechnology has a positive impact on user's intention to\nadopt it.\nSI. SI is an individual's belief on other's expectation of him\nor her to use a system (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). SI con-\nstruct consists of family, relatives, and friends items (Peder-\nsen & Ling, 2002). SI has two facets. That is interpersonal\nand external influence in DOI theory. Interpersonal influence\noccurs from family, friends, neighbors, and relations,\nwhereas media externally influences (Bhattacherjee, 2001;\nTeo & Pok, 2003). SI in UTAUT evolved from social factors,\nsocial image, and subjective norms. S. Singh etal. (2010),\nthe strong family and friends influence in technology adop-\ntion. Social norm explains SI.

Puschel and Mazzon (2010) studied prod-\nuct decision patterns for Internet service adoption using SI.\nRural people depend on opinion leaders for decision mak-\ning. In these situations, SI provides vital inputs on varied\nbelief structures and attitudes. Venkatesh and Davis (2000),\n(2011) validated SI effect on BI. Therefore, we hypothesized\nthe following:\nHypothesis 3 (H3): SI about mobile banking service\ntechnology has a positive impact on user's intention to\nadopt it.\nAttitude.Attitude variable was widely used in TAM (Fish-\nbein & Ajzen, 1975). The attitude variable provides insight\non favorable and unfavorable beliefs about a specific behav-\nior (Xu, 2006). Attitude explained adoption leading to inten-\ntion development for decades (Schepers & Wetzels, 2007).\nAjzen and Fishbein linked attitude to BI as early as 1980.\nTheir work garnered good support.\nTRA and TPB models assume that intention exactly pre-\ndicts an individual's behavior better. Ajzen in 1985 argued\n6 SAGE Open\nintention as a function of attitude and reiterated again in\n2002. Attitude is an outcome of personal influence and SI\ncluded relationship between attitude and BI varies for tech-\nnologies in service sectors. Tsang, Ho, and Liang (2004),\nPark et\nKrogstie (2012) validated attitude's relationship with inten-\ntion. This led us to hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Attitude about mobile banking ser-\nvice technology has a positive impact on user's intention\nto adopt it.\nPR. PR is an insecure feeling about technologies (Bebko, 2000;\n1960s, technology adoption studies used PR variable (Laroche,\nMcDougall, Bergeron, & Yang, 2004). Doubts augment risk\nperception on technologies (Chen, 2008; Gewald, W\u00fcllenwe-\nNdubisi & Sinti, 2006). Risk perception includes low trust,\ntechnological anxiety, and behavioral introspection variables.\nSecurity is a concern for banks in the mobile banking intro-\nduction where data safety (Coursaris, Hassanein, & Head,\nneed attention. Strategy plays an important role in managing\nconsumer anxiety (G. Kim, Shin, & Lee, 2009; Koenig-Lewis,\nPalmer, & Moll, 2010). Banks need strong know your cus-\ntomer (KYC) norms (Dasgupta etal., 2011). Privacy issues\nfuel increased risk perception (Bansal, Zahedi, & Gefen, 2010;\nDupas, Green, Keats, & Robinson, 2012; Eastlick, Lotz, &\ngained recognition from scholars in IS studies by providing\ninsight on hidden intentions behind a conduct.

Coursaris etal.\npassengers. J. H. Wu and Wang (2005) found a significant\nrelationship between PR and intention studying mobile com-\nmerce adoption at Taiwan. Furthermore, Gu, Lee, and Suh\nfound PR as a major barrier in mobile banking adoption.\nTherefore, we can hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 5 (H5): PR about mobile banking service\ntechnology has a negative impact on user's intention to\nadopt it.\nBI. BI is defined as the degree of user's willingness to use\nnew technology. Ajzen and Fishbein in 1980 introduced BI\nas reliable predictor. Multiattribute models used BI. Ajzen\nand Fishbein explored consumer belief, attitudes, and inten-\ntions. Most of the technology adoption frameworks used BI\nas the dependent variable. Predicting outcomes were better\nFeatherman and Fuller (2003); Cunningham, Gerlach,\ncluded BI development patterns vary, and they depend on\nfeatures of technologies. BI played vital role in IS adoption\nUTAUT had voluntariness of use and experience as MVs.\nThey were only significant in organizational settings. Prior\nexperiences of mobile banking were nil in rural areas, and\ntherefore, study selected age and gender for moderation anal-\nysis. Age and gender are demographic variables. Baker,\nAl-Gahtani, and Hubona (2007); Sulaiman, Jaafar, and\nSingh, and Ahmad (2011) validated importance of age and\ngender role in IS research.\nGender (MV). Gender is one of the crucial variables in con-\nsumer behavior research (Forsythe & Chun, 2000). Lack of\ngender-based studies, especially in mobile banking adoption\nresearch, was clear (Thomas & Taskov, 2007; Venkatesh &\nMorris, 2000). Some isolated technology adoption studies\nare found on email (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000), information\nretrieval (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000), e-learning (Ong &\nLai, 2006), communication technologies (Laforet & Li,\n2005), and online purchasing behavior (Thomas & Taskov,\nMorris and Venkatesh (2000) identified gender and age\ndifferences in technology adoption.

Garbarino and Strahilevitz\nimportant demographic variable in technology adoption\nstudies. Li and Kishore (2006) theorized that gender moder-\nates the relationship in the path of PE, EE, and SI leading to\nBI. We can hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 7a (H7a): The influence of PE on develop-\nment of BI is moderated by gender.\nKishore and Sequeira 7\nHypothesis 7b (H7b): The influence of EE on develop-\nment of BI is moderated by gender.\nHypothesis 7c (H7c): The influence of SI on develop-\nment of BI is moderated by gender.\nHypothesis 7d (H7d): The influence of attitude on devel-\nopment of BI is moderated by gender.\nAccording to Fernando and Porter (2002), men adopt tech-\nnologies faster than women. Slyke, Comunale, and Belanger\n(2002) found gender moderation in Internet banking adoption\nsupported by Lichtenstein and Williamson (2006). Sulaiman\nferred mobile banking compared with 34.4% females as men\nread more technology magazines. Females used more online\nshopping than men. In the latest research on gender differ-\nences, L. Zhou, Dai, and Zhang (2007) identified gap reduc-\ntion in gender behaviors. Porter (2008), further explaining\nFernando and Porter's (2002) findings, concluded that, in the\ntransportation sector, males adopted technologies faster as\ntheir occupation demanded it. Kwiatkowski, Zettlemoyer,\nGoldwater, and Steedman (2010) observed low-cost online\nservice drives mobile banking adoption.\nAge. Affiliation needs increase with age. Elderly people with\nlow experience gave more importance for SI (Venkatesh &\nMorris, 2000). Older people resisted scanners (Oumlil &\nWilliams, 2000). Age was preferred by psychology research-\ners and practitioners (Mattila, Karjaluoto, & Pento, 2003).\nWhile reviewing age literature, the quest was on whether\nyoung or old people prefer technology.

Needs and preferences change with age.\nAge and gender are crucial in moderating paths of independent\nand dependent variables (Y. C. Lee, Li, Yen, & Huang, 2010).\nResearch Methodology\nThe study probes prevailing mobile banking service adop-\ntion problem by descriptive approach.\nData Collection\nA questionnaire consisted of variables and their items.\nQuestionnaire measured items on a 7-point scale. Technology\nadoption studies in nonorganizational setting measured vari-\nables on a 7-point scale. Survey method execution prompted\nadministering of questionnaire.\nSampling Design\nThe mixed sampling technique helped to reach 959 samples.\nThe technique combines probability and nonprobability sam-\npling methods. Absence of sample frame led to use of non-\nprobabilistic sampling method. Mixed sampling enhances\ninternal and external validity of a study. It facilitates general-\nization with less bias in procedure.\nProbabilistic sampling methods randomly pick samples.\nProbabilistic sampling requires a sample frame. Villagers'\nlist of names (sample frame) was not clearly available. The\nIndian Census database as sample frame was a clear fit in\nsampling process (see http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_\nData_2001/Village_Directory/List_of_Villages/List_of_\nVillages_Alphabetical.aspx?cki=&ComboState_Code=29).\nWith systematic probability sampling, villages were ran-\ndomly selected. Nonprobabilistic sampling permits inclusion\nor exclusion of population elements in a sample. Researcher\nused judgmental sampling to include rural respondents in the\nsample (see Figure 1).\nProbabilistic sampling method randomly picked villages\nfrom a vast exhaustive list of villages in Karnataka using\n2011 census. Calculation of Kth element is as follows:\nK\nN\nn\n= ,\nwhere N is the population size, and n is the sample size.\nwas sample size. When substituted, the result was 39,071. So\ntive list was a rural area for the survey. Judgmental sampling\nhelped in identifying the respondent depending on his or her\nability to understand and respond to queries. The survey col-\nlected a total of 972 samples, out of which 959 samples were\neligible for editing, coding, and tabulating processes.\nData Analysis and Interpretation\nData analysis consisted of various steps. The procedure\nexamined coded data before analysis. The steps involved in\ndata analysis are as follows:\n8 SAGE Open\n1. Data screening for treatment (missing data, unen-\ngaged responses, outliers)\n2. Reliability analysis (for Cronbach's  values above\n3. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for validity\n4. Multiple regression analysis\n5. Mean centering instead of median split\n6. Interaction/moderation analysis (Aiken and West's\napproach, Jeremy Dawson's approach).\nAfter treating data, constructs of theoretical framework\nwere subjected to reliability analysis. Convincing values of\nCronbach's alpha cleared the way for EFA. EFAwas conducted\nto check sample adequacy by Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO)\ntest and convergent validity of the constructs. Principal compo-\nnents analysis (PCA) extracted pure and true eigenvalues.\nWhile performing EFA, multicollinearity was also examined to\ndecide on rotation pattern. As there was no correlation among\nconstructs, variables were orthogonally rotated with varimax\nrotation. After confirming validity and successful extraction of\nconstructs, multiple regression analysis revealed relationship\nstrengths. In the interaction analysis, every data entry influ-\nences the output. Interaction approach followed mean center-\ning for accurate results. Previous studies used median split.\nMedian split, though widely followed, was not supported by IS\nadoption researchers (Irwin & McClelland, 2003). Splitting\nconverts a continuous variable to categories (low, high) on the\nbasis of median. Studies that preferred median split were much\nfamiliar using ANOVA not regression analysis. Median split\nresults in loss of predicting power in a continuous variable\n(Aiken & West, 1991). Nearly one third of the data are lost\n(MacCallum etal., 2002) and lead to false conclusions (Austin,\nBarbir, Ferris, & Garg, 2004; McClelland, Lynch, Irwin,\nSpiller, & Fitzsimons, 2015). Centering was essential in inter-\nval scale measurement. Centering concentrates power in vari-\nables (Snijders & Bosker, 2012). Later interaction moderation\nanalysis output provided interesting insights on relationships.\nPreanalysis Data Screening\nThe details of factor and reliability analysis are as follows\n(see Table 2).\nPCA method perfectly loads variables with small dimen-\nsions (Berk, 2008). All items under six factors loaded on\ntheir constructs. KMO test and Bartlett's test for sample ade-\nance from six factors. Gorsuch (1983) recommended\nminimum sample size of 100 for EFA. Comrey and Lee\nsupported by Pearson and Mundform (2010). Sample size\n959 was convincing for EFA (see Table 3).\nReliability value of the model remained .798. Constructs\nexceeded the acceptable norm of .50 to .60. Reliability score\nof all constructs met Hari, Egbu, and Kumar's (2006)\nrequired alpha value of mobile banking adoption constructs\n(equal or more than .70).\nIn multiple regression analysis, we followed Aiken and\nWest's approach for mean centering of variables. Tables 4 to\n6 represent a multiple regression analysis.\ncally significant. Independent variables, PE, EE, SI,Attitude,\nand PR, were significantly related to dependent variable BI.\nCentered variables were further subjected to interaction\nanalysis. Gender was not centered as it was a perfect categor-\nical variable. Attitude had interaction effect by age and gen-\nder.

Age provided vital\ninsight on mobile banking adoption behavior in rural\nKarnataka (see Figure 4).\nAmong H6 and H7, only H6d and H7d were statistically\ntistically significant. Results are found in the online\nappendix.\nImplications\nTechnology, installed just as a part of the campaign, is aim-\nless. Hands on training and demonstrations drive adoption\n(Keengwe etal., 2008). By the findings, it was clear that if\nmobile banking technology improves job performance com-\npared with traditional banking methods, it gets adopted as\nPE was related to BI. If mobile banking service is easier to\nlearn, rural people would adopt it as part of EE's relationship\nwith BI. SI revealed a mild influence of family members and\nfriends on people in adopting mobile banking service. The\nattitude was significantly related to the BI signaling presence\nof favorable environment for mobile banking service. PR\nhad a negative relationship indicating risk perception of rural\npeople. In interaction analysis, age strengthened attitude's\nrelationship with BI. Higher the age of an individual, more\npositive would be the individual's attitude leading to BI\ndevelopment.\nImplication on Academics\nGeneralization is tough for academicians in adoption and\ninteraction curve predictions due to uneven demographic\nTable 7.

Rural people can learn the need of open-\ning and sustaining bank accounts. Bank transactions enhance\ntheir cash management skills and increase national financial\ndepth.\nE-Commerce offers bank opportunity in mobile banking\nservice. Mobile currency service providers can get a gist of\nrural population's mind-set by academic studies. The cam-\npaigns should communicate mobile banking advantages.\nEase of use variable gives product/service implication\ninformation to corporate sector (Venkatesh, Thong, Chan,\nHu, & Brown, 2011). Mild SI relationship with BIs indicates\nprobability of opinion leader's influence to help technology\nadoption. Corporates can target promotions of mobile bank-\ning services with opinion leaders. The issue of risk percep-\ntion needs attention. Instilling confidence and trust eliminates\ngossips and grapevines. As more aged people are with favor-\nable attitude, people aged 30 years can also be targeted\nbased on mobile banking's valuable contribution to their\noccupation and lifestyle. Academics can supplement corpo-\nrate with crucial inputs to target campaigns. Companies can\ndesign campaigns to diffuse mobile banking service technol-\nogy among rural people (Munongo & Chitungo, 2013;\nConclusion\nMobile phones are the future of financial transaction. It\nshould reach average person (Sharma & Kansal, 2012).\nFavorable attitude was found in rural people. These factorial\nrelationships hold crucial information for technology\ndiffusion.\nRelevance of Findings\nThe findings were relevant with earlier studies conducted by\nIS adoption scholars. List of supporting studies in chrono-\nlogical order is as follows:\nPE was related to BI, supported by J. C. C. Lin and Lu\nNysveen et\nY.-S.

Mattila\net\nal.\nGallego, and Laukkanen (2010); and Venkatesh et\nal.\n(2010) supported age's moderation. Findings unsupported\nby earlier studies are given in Table 13.\nIS Studies from 2008 to present timeline supported our\nfindings. Compared with PE, EE, and attitude's strength, SI's\nrelationship with BI was weak. However, responses indi-\ncated that surrounding people mildly influenced rural peo-\nple's choice in mobile banking service adoption. PR was\nnegatively related to BI. SI consistently did not influence BI\nstudies. Venkatesh etal.'s (2003) study upholds varied demo-\ngraphic distributions as a reason. Kleijnen etal. (2004) and\nS. C. Chan and Lu (2004) used SI construct to study wireless\nfinance adoption and Internet banking, where a significant\nrelationship with BI was clear. Gender dampened strength\nbetween attitude and BI. Age strengthened the relationship.\nThe study did not support the Ben Oumlil and Williams\nolder age resulted in lesser chances of technology adoption.\nA study supported rare finding of Karjaluoto, Pakola, Pietil\u00e4,\nadopted technology faster than younger people. Furthermore,\nCruz etal. (2010) in Brazil had similar conclusions. Study\nconcludes rural elders have a favorable attitude leading to BI\ndevelopment adopting mobile banking service.\nFuture Scope of the Study\nIn Pune (Maharashtra), electricity payment, telephone bill\npayments, and funds transfers are already launched as pilot\nprojects. Future studies can aim inclusion of more independent\nvariables and dependent variables with added moderators at an\nexpanded territory. SI apart from the present practice of mea-\nsuring in basic items can also be measured from social net-\nwork sources (Goldstein & Cialdini, 2009; Sykes, Venkatesh,\n& Gosain, 2009). This can work well in an urban setting.\nAccording to Central Intelligence Agency (2011), India is a\nmixture of multilingual, multiethnic symphony. North and\nSouth India are demographically different. Identical financial\ninclusion campaigns all over the country may not yield suc-\ncess. As moderations of age and gender have occurred, espe-\ncially in the path of attitude to BI, more studies can also focus\non exploring attitude and its nearest components leading\ntoward development of BI.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAiken, L.
