Percentage body fat tended to be significantly more\ncorrelated with WC than with BMI in men but significantly more\ncorrelated with BMI than with WC in women (P , 0.0001 except in\nthe oldest age group). WSR tended to be slightly more correlated\nwith percentage body fat than was WC. Percentile values of BMI,\nWC, and WSR are shown that correspond to percentiles of percent-\nage body fat increments of 5 percentage points. More than 90% of\nthe sample could be categorized to within one category of percent-\nage body fat by each measure.\nConclusions: BMI, WC, and WSR perform similarly as indicators\nof body fatness and are more closely related to each other than with\npercentage body fat. These variables may be an inaccurate measure\nof percentage body fat for an individual, but they correspond fairly\nwell overall with percentage body fat within sex-age groups and\ndistinguish categories of percentage body fat.

US and international\ndefinitions of overweight and obesity for adults are based on\nBMI (1, 2). Weight and height can be measured relatively\nsimply and accurately.\nBMI is a measure of weight adjusted for height and does not\nmeasure body composition directly. Obesity refers to an excess of\nbody fat. The underlying assumption of using BMI to define\nobesity is that at a given height, higher weight is associated with\nincreased fatness (3). However, BMI is an imperfect measure of\nbody fatness (4, 5), largely because it does not directly measure\nfat mass. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is one of the\nmost accurate and precise methods available to directly measure\ntotal body fat and lean soft tissue mass, but it requires special-\nized DXA systems and X-ray exposure. Partly because of the\nlimitations of BMI, the use of other simple measures to evaluate\nadiposity, such as waist circumference (WC) or the waist-stature\nratio (WSR), has also been suggested (6\u00ad8).\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the relations\nbetween BMI, WC, WSR, and percentage body fat (from DXA)\nin adults in a large nationally representative US population sample\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES). We compare these measures with each other. We\nalso estimate the percentile values of BMI, WC, and WSR that\napproximately correspond to specified values of percentage body\nfat.\nIn NHANES, a representative cross-sectional sample of the US\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized population was selected by using\na complex, multistage probability design. Beginning in 1999,\nNHANES is a continuous survey that includes an interview in the\nhousehold followed by an examination in a mobile examination\ncenter. Adolescents aged 12\u00ad19 y, persons aged !60 y, blacks,\nand Mexican Americans were oversampled to produce more\nprecise estimates for these groups. Data from NHANES 1999\u00ad\nreview board approval and included written informed consent.\n1 From the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, Hyattsville MD (KMF, ACL, LGB, CLO, and\nNS); the Department of Radiology, University of California, San Francisco,\nCA (JAS); and the National Cancer Institute, (BIG), the National Institute on\nAging (TBH), and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and\nKidney Diseases, (JEE), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.\n2 The findings and conclusions of this report are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent those of abovementioned agencies.\n3 Reprints not available.

Weight, height (stature), and WC were measured\nby using standardized techniques and equipment (9). WC was\nmeasured just above the iliac crest. WSR was calculated as WC\n(cm)/height (m).\nWhole-body percentage body fat was calculated as total body\nfat mass divided by total mass (from DXA) 3 100. Whole-body\nDXA scans were acquired by using a Hologic QDR 4500A fan-\nbeam densitometer (Hologic Inc, Bedford, MA) (9). The scan for\neach survey participant was reviewed and analyzed by the\nUniversity of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department\nof Radiology, using standard radiologic techniques and study-\nspecific protocols developed for NHANES. Hologic Discovery\nsoftware, version 12.1, was used to analyze the scans. Beyond\nplanned exclusions, a number of participants were missing valid\nDXA data for a variety of reasons. The percentage of partic-\nipants with valid data decreased with increasing age, primarily\nbecause of an increase in implants such as pacemakers, stents,\nand hip replacements. These artifacts can affect the accuracy of\nthe DXA results. Metal appears as dense bone, and soft tissue\nimplants such as breast augmentation appear as additional lean\nsoft tissue mass. In addition, the proportion of participants with\nvalid data was lower at higher BMI levels, in part because of\ntruncal adiposity. The DXA scanner cannot penetrate much\nthicker than 15 cm, after which the accuracy of segmenting the\nbone is limited.\nImputation Data Files as released by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (10). In part because data were not missing\ncompletely at random, missing DXA values were imputed in\nthese public-use data sets. Because missing DXA data were\nrelated to age, BMI, weight, and height and possibly to other\ncharacteristics, participants with missing data could no be\ntreated as a random subset of the original sample. Otherwise,\nanalytic results could be biased toward participants with the\nleast amount of missing data. Multiple imputation (11) was\ncarried out to allow analyses to reflect the additional variability\ndue to the use of imputed values for the missing data. With\nmultiple imputation, M (in this case, M \u00bc 5) versions of the\nimputed values are created randomly and independently under\nthe imputation model, resulting in M completed data sets. Each\ndata set is analyzed using the analysis that would be used with\ncomplete data, and the M sets of results are combined, with the\nvariability across the M analyses measuring the additional var-\niability due to missing data.\nThe characteristics of the missing data and the imputation\nData Files are both described in detail in the technical docu-\nmentation (12). Briefly, however, a sequential regression mul-\ntivariate imputation procedure (13) was implemented separately\nwithin 10 age-by-sex groups. A large number of predictors were\nused, including the non-DXA variables analyzed in this article as\nwell as body measurements, indicators of health, variables on\ndiet and use of medications, blood test results, variables related\nto the design of the NHANES sample, and other demographic,\nsocioeconomic, and geographic variables. In addition, the cor-\nrelations between DXA measurements for different parts of the\nbody were taken into account. Thus, when measurements were\nobserved for some parts but not for others, the observed mea-\nsurements were used to predict the missing values.\nThe information used in the imputation process helps to adjust\nsubsequent analyses for the fact that the persons with missing\nDXA data are not a completely random subset of the original\nNHANES sample. The multiple imputations help to reflect un-\ncertainty in relations between the missing DXA values and other\nvariables that are analyzed with them.\nAnalytic sample\nThis report uses data for participants aged !20 y. There were\n12,936 nonpregnant participants in this age range who had\ncomplete weight and height data. Of these participants, 3005\nwere missing some or all DXA data and 2970 had some or all\nimputed DXA data for a final analytic sample size of 12,901\nnonpregnant adult participants with both BMI data and per-\ncentage body fat data. Of these, 345 were missing data on WC,\nso the analyses based on WC used data on 12,556 participants,\nof whom 2678 had some or all imputed DXA data.\nStatistical methods\nWe calculated sample-weighted Pearson correlation coef-\nficients between each pair of the variables percentage body fat,\nBMI, WC, and WSR within each age-sex group. For purposes of\nstatistically testing differences between correlation coefficients,\nthese correlations were transformed by using Fisher's z trans-\nformation. For each imputation data set, the within-imputation\ncomponent of variance for a difference between 2 transformed\ncorrelation coefficients was computed by using a (stratified)\njackknife method leaving out one primary sample unit (PSU) at\na time (14). These variances were combined with a between-\nimputation component of variance for the differences in the trans-\nformed correlations over the 5 imputation data sets (11); t tests\nwere used to test for equality between 2 transformed correlations,\nand the df was determined according to Barnard and Rubin (15).\nForty-seven df (number of PSUs 2 the number of sampling\nstrata) was used as the complete-data df in this determination.\nStandard BMI categories are well established and widely used.\nHowever, categories of percentage fat are not well standardized.\nAccording to a World Health Organization expert committee,\n``there is no agreement about cut-off points for the percentage\nof body fat that constitutes obesity'' (16; p 420). Thus, we calcu-\nlated the weighted prevalence, averaged over the multiply im-\nputed data sets, of arbitrary categories of percentage body fat\nwithin age and sex groups using arbitrary increments of 5 per-\ncentage points. Because the distribution of percentage body fat\ndiffered considerably between men and women, the ranges\ncovered were different for men than for women. For descriptive\npurposes, we estimated the age and sex-specific percentile val-\nues of BMI, WC, and WSR that would correspond to the per-\ncentage fat categories in the sense that they identify the same\npercentiles and proportion of the distribution and thus produce\napproximately the same prevalence estimates as the percentage\nfat categories. We used these levels to create categories of BMI,\nWC, and WSR that were prevalence-matched to the percentage\nfat categories. The overall classification by age- and sex-specific\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ncategories was evaluated by calculating the percentage of\nthe population that fell into the corresponding category by any\n2 measures (exact agreement) and using separate logistic\nregression to model the dependence of exact agreement between\neach pair of measures on sex, age group, and race-ethnicity\ngroup. We also calculated the percentage that agreed to within\none category. The BMI, WC, and WSR categories were de-\ntermined empirically to match the percentage fat categories.\nThis empirical determination was not taken into account in the\nestimation of the SEs in our analysis involving the BMI, WC,\nand WSR categories; therefore, these SEs were most likely\nslightly underestimated.\nAnalyses were conducted with PC-SAS (version 9.1; SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (version 9.03; Research\nTriangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). All statistical\nanalyses used sample weights and accounted for the sample\ndesign and the multiple imputations. Estimates were averaged\nover the 5 sets of imputations. Statistical significance was de-\ntermined based on a P value ,0.05 with Bonferroni adjustment.\nRESULTS\nBasic descriptive information about the analytic sample is\nshown in Table 1. Differences in mean values between men and\nwomen were tested by using a 2-sample t test for complex\nsurvey data (14). Pearson correlations between percentage fat,\nBMI, WC, and WSR are shown in Table 2 by sex and age group.\nCorrelations by race-ethnicity group within sex and age groups\nwere similar to those seen overall (data not shown). All corre-\nlations were significantly greater than zero (P , 0.0001). For\nmen, the correlations between percentage fat and BMI ranged\ncomparisons between pairs of correlations, statistical signifi-\ncance was based on a P value of 0.00045, which was equivalent\nto a P value of , 0.05 after Bonferroni correction. For men,\npercentage fat was significantly more highly correlated with WC\nor with WSR than with BMI (P , 0.00001, except in the oldest\nage group in which the differences were not statistically sig-\nnificant). For women, percentage fat was significantly more\ncept in the oldest age group in which the difference was not\nstatistically significant (P \u00bc 0.037).

We identified\ncutoffs for BMI, WC, and WSR that corresponded to the same\npercentiles of the distribution as did the percentage fat values\nand thus were matched to percentage fat categories in the sense\nthat these cutoffs would categorize the same proportion of\npeople within each BMI or waist or WSR category as did the\ncorresponding percentage fat category, although not necessarily\nhad percentage fat values !40; the corresponding BMI cutoff\nof 43 shown in Table 3 identified the highest 1.8% of BMI values,\na WC cutoff of 136 cm or more identified the highest 2.0% of\nWC values, and a WSR cutoff of 75 identified the highest 1.8%\nof WSR values. Although the prevalence estimates could not\nalways be matched exactly, the cutoffs shown in Tables 3 and\n4 are the closest rounded values, and generally the prevalences\nmatched within 1 percentage point or less. These values suggest\nthat, for men in the age group 20\u00ad39 y, cutoffs of a BMI of 25,\na WC of 90 cm, or a WSR of 51 represent approximately the\nsame percentile of their respective distributions as a percentage\nfat cutoff of 25%. However, in the oldest age group, a percent-\nage fat cutoff of 25 was equivalent to the same percentile as\na cutoff of a BMI of 22 or a WC of 89 cm. At higher values\nof percentage fat, the range of BMI values corresponding to a\n5-percentage-point increase in body fat was wider than at lower\nvalues of percentage fat. For example, for men aged 20\u00ad39 y, the\nrange of BMIs corresponding to a range in percentage body fat\ncorresponding to a range in percentage body fat from 35% to\nWC and WSR as well.\nWe applied the age- and sex-specific cutoffs shown in Tables\n3 and 4 to create BMI, WC, and WSR categories corresponding\nto the prevalence of the percentage fat categories shown in Tables\n3 and 4. Thus, all 4 sets of categories (percentage fat categories,\nBMI categories, WC categories, and WSR categories) represent\nsimilar estimated prevalences within each age-sex group. We\nthen assessed the agreement between percentage fat, BMI, WC,\nand WSR categories by calculating the percentage of the population\nthat fell into the corresponding categories by 2 different\nDescriptive information (weighted estimates) for the analytic sample\nMen Women\nAge group (% of total)\nRace-ethnicity group (% of total)\n1 Mean 6 SE (all such values).\n2 Significantly different from men, P , 0.05 (2-sample t test for com-\nplex survey data).\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nmeasures and also the percentage that agreed to within one\ncategory by 2 different measures. For example, a woman in the\nage range 20\u00ad39 y with an estimated percentage body fat of 35%\nand a BMI of 23 would fall into corresponding categories by\nthese 2 measures, as shown in Table 4. However, if the BMI was\n22, the woman would fall into a lower BMI category and thus be\nconsidered to fall into different categories by these 2 measures,\nbut to agree within one category. The results for exact agreement\nand agreement to within one category are presented in Table 5.\nOverall, 46% of men and 49% of women were in the same\ncategory by percentage fat and by BMI. Results for the agreement\nof WC categories with percentage body fat categories were similar\ntothose for the agreement ofBMI categories withpercentage body\nfat categories, with estimates slightly higher for men (51%\nagreement of WC categories with percentage body fat categories\ncompared with 46% agreement of BMI categories with percentage\nbody fat categories; P , 0.00002 for the difference) and slightly\nlower for women (42% agreement of WC categories with per-\ncentage body fat categories compared with 49% agreement of\nBMI categories with percentage body fat categories; P , 0.00001\nfor the difference). Estimates of agreement for WSR with per-\ncentage body fat were similar to those for WC and differences\nbetween estimates of agreement with percentage body fat for WC\nand estimates of agreement with percentage body fat for WSR\nwere not statistically significant (P \u00bc 0.23 for the difference for\nmen and P \u00bc 0.43 for women) As was also seen for the correlation\nPearson correlations of percentage body fat, BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-stature ratio (WSR)\nby sex and age group1\nSex and\nage group\nPercentage body\nfat with BMI\nPercentage body\nfat with WC\nPercentage body\nfat with WSR\nBMI\nwith WC\nBMI\nwith WSR\nWC\nwith WSR\nMen\nWomen\n1 Within each sex-age group, values with different superscript letters are significantly different, P \u00bc 0.00045 (equiv-\nalent to P , 0.05 after Bonferroni correction).

For example, the data in this table show\nto ,32 corresponds more closely to the percentage fat category of\nin Table 3, which suggests that at a given BMI, percentage fat is\nsomewhat lower in non-Hispanic blacks than in the full sample\nor in non-Hispanic whites.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this large population-based, nationally representative\nsample, WC, WSR, BMI, and DXA-derived percentage body fat\nwere all highly correlated with each other within sex-age groups.\nBMI, WC, and WSR all performed very similarly as indirect\nmeasures of body fat, and they were more closely related to each\nother than with percentage body fat. Percentage fat tended to be\nslightly but significantly more correlated with WC than with BMI\namong men, but significantly more correlated with BMI than with\nWC among women; the differences were slight. Generally,\nsimilar correlations of BMI with percentage body fat have been\nthat WC is slightly more correlated with fat than was BMI\namong men but slightly less so among women.\nWe estimated values of BMI, WC, and WSR that identified the\nsame percentiles of the distribution as did arbitrary percentage\nbody fat categories and thus identified the same proportion of\nthe population. Approximately 40\u00ad50% of respondents were\nclassified into equivalent categories of WC, WSR, or BMI,\nand .90% were classified similarly to within one category. The\npurpose of presenting these values is to describe the distributions\nof these variables and not to propose that these cutoff values be\nused for categorization. Further research is needed to show how\nbest to use BMI, WC, or WSR to classify individuals according to\npercentage fat. However, the relatively good agreement between\nthese variables suggests that BMI, WC, and WSR may serve well\nin classifying individuals into broad categories corresponding to\npercentage fat categories. Agreement in classification by WC or\nWSR relative to BMI was higher, in the range of 60\u00ad70%.\nfications differed by only one category.\nFIGURE 1. Agreement of BMI and waist-stature (WSR) categories\nshown in Table 3 with percentage fat categories for non-Hispanic white\nFIGURE 2. Agreement of BMI and waist-stature (WSR) categories\nshown in Table 4 with percentage fat categories for non-Hispanic white\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nAs shown previously (17, 18), and as would be expected from\nconsiderations of body composition (24, 25), percentage fat does\nnot increase linearly with body weight. Thus, a given difference\nin BMI, WC, or WSR at low levels reflects a larger change in\npercentage fat than does the same difference in BMI, WC, or\nWSR at high levels.\nBMI is widely used in epidemiologic studies to assess the risks\nof health outcomes associated with different levels of body\nweight. Some studies have suggested that WC, either singly or in\ncombination with BMI, may have a stronger relation to some\nhealth outcomes than BMI alone (6, 26\u00ad28). In the NHANES\ndata, both BMI and WC had a similar relation to percentage body\nfat and both were more highly correlated with each other than\nwith percentage body fat. It is not clear whether percentage\nbody fat is the most relevant variable in terms of relation of body\ncomposition with health outcomes; some other aspect of body\ncomposition such as lean mass or visceral adipose tissue might be\nequally or more important. Bosy-Westphal et al (23) found that,\nfor practical purposes at the population level, BMI, WC, and\npercentage fat all predicted metabolic risk factors equally well.\nSimilar findings have been reported by Dalton et al (29). Vazquez\net al (30) found that BMI and WC performed equally well in\npredicting incident diabetes. Shen et al (31) found that WC was\nmore highly related to health risk factors than was percentage\nbody fat. Although WC has been suggested to be a better\nmeasure of visceral adipose tissue (32), some evidence suggests\nthat it may also primarily be related to total body fat rather than\nto visceral adiposity per se (33). Different health outcomes may\nhave different relations to body composition and to these various\nhighly correlated measures, so that the results may vary de-\npending on the outcomes examined and on other characteristics\nof the study samples.\nWSR has been suggested to be a better indicator of adiposity\nthan WC alone (7, 8). In the NHANES data, WSR tended to be\na slightly better indicator of percentage fat than was WC alone,\nalthough the differences were not large. The cutoff value of 50\nfor WSR, suggested by Ashwell and Hsieh (8), is close to the\npercentile that corresponds to percentage of 25% for men or of\n35% for women; differences could arise in part from measuring\nWC at a different anatomic location.\nOther approaches have been taken to finding values of per-\ncentage fat comparable with BMI categories from samples with\nboth weight and height measures and body fat measures. Norgan\nand Ferro-Luzzi (34) used prediction equations to predict per-\ncentage body fat (estimated from underwater weighing) at dif-\nferent BMI levels for men and found cutoff values of 15%, 22%,\n40--roughly similar to our estimates. Several studies have used\nPercentile cutoffs for BMI and waist circumference (WC) corresponding to specified percentage body fat categories\nfor non-Hispanic black men by age group\nPercentage body fat\nCorresponding BMI percentiles\nCorresponding WC percentiles\n1 Insufficient data.\nPercentile cutoffs for BMI and waist circumference (WC) corresponding to specified percentage body fat categories for\nnon-Hispanic black women by age group\nPercentage body fat\nCorresponding BMI percentiles\nCorresponding WC percentiles\n1 Insufficient data.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nreceiver operating characteristic curves to assess different an-\nthropometric measures relative to percentage body fat (5, 17, 35).\nThat approach, however, requires specifying a fixed percentage\nbody fat as the outcome; at present, there are no standard or widely\naccepted categories of percentage body fat, as evidenced in part\nby the fact that each of these articles used different cutoffs.\nThe relation of BMI to percentage fat varies by sex, age, and\nrace-ethnicity group (22, 36), so that the percentage fat that\na given BMI represents will tend to vary across sex, age, and\nrace-ethnicity. Considerable discussion has addressed the public\nhealth and policy issues of using different BMI cutoffs for dif-\nferent ethnicity groups that have different relations of BMI to\nbody fat and to health risks (36\u00ad45). Our findings confirm that\nthe same BMI categories are associated with lower levels of\nbody fat in non-Hispanic blacks than in other race-ethnic groups\n(36, 46, 47) and indicate that this is also the case for WC. Other\nresearch has also suggested that the health risks associated with\na given BMI level may be lower for blacks than for whites (44,\n46, 48\u00ad51). In general, the selection of BMI cutoffs is related to\nhealth outcomes, but the method used to establish exact cutoffs\nhas been called ``largely arbitrary'' (16). The BMI, WC, or WSR\ncutoffs that identify similar levels of body fat across age, sex,\nand ethnicity groups may differ from the BMI, WC, or WSR\ncutoffs that identify similar levels of health risk across age, sex,\nand ethnicity groups.\nOur study had some limitations. Percentage fat was based only\non DXA measurements, not on more complex body-composition\nmodels such as a 4-compartment model (52\u00ad56). WC was mea-\nsured just above the iliac crest, and this may limit the compara-\nbility of our results with WC measured in other anatomic locations\n(57). Multiple imputation methods were used to adjust for missing\nDXA data. As with any method that adjusts analyses for missing\ndata, the validity of results depends on the validity of the as-\nsumptions about the missing data.\nThe results presented herein show the values of BMI, WC, and\nWSR that will divide the population into categories prevalence-\nmatched to those identified by the percentage body fat categories.\nThese are presented for descriptive purposes and not as a pro-\nposed approach to use in categorizing these variables. However,\nthey may assist in showing the distributions of BMI, WC, and\nWSR relative to the distribution of percentage fat. These values\nvary by age, sex, and to some extent by race-ethnicity group. In\ngeneral, BMI, WC, WSR, and percentage body fat are all closely\nrelated, and, as percentage body fat increases, BMI, WC, and\nWSR all increase. BMI and WC or WSR showed somewhat\nhigher agreement with each other than either did with percentage\nfat. For men, WC and WSR agreed slightly better than did BMI\nwith categories of percentage fat. For women, however, BMI\nagreed with categories of percentage fat better than did WC or\nWSR. Although an estimate of body fat based on BMI, WC, or\nWSR for an individual may be inaccurate, overall BMI, WC, and\nWSR values correspond fairly well within groups and distinguish\ncategories of body fatness.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--KMF: study design and\nwriting of the first draft of the manuscript; JAS, LGB, and ACL: acquisition\nand interpretation of data from the DXA scans; NS, LGB, ACL, and KMF:\nmultiple imputation of DXA data; and BIG and NS: statistical analysis.

None of the authors had a per-\nsonal or financial conflict of interest.\nREFERENCES\n1. Expert Panel on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Over-\nweight in Adults.
