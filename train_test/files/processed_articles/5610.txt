    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere continues to be a shortage of qualified graduates for agriculture jobs within the United States. One reason for this\nshortage is the decline in student enrollment in colleges of agriculture. One tool that can increase college preparation for\nfuture graduates and help students succeed is the agriculture dual-enrollment program. Dual enrollment allows high-school\nstudents to take courses while dually enrolled in a corresponding college course. The program was found to have a positive\nimpact on students taking more rigorous courses and gaining in-depth knowledge of agriculture. Teachers felt that this\nprogram helped in establishing higher standards in coursework and in feeling satisfied about their job. It enhanced prestige\nand program reputation. Dual enrollment was seen to have little to no impact on school counselors. Research focused on the\npedagogical approaches of these course offerings will benefit the creation of future high-quality dual credit courses.\n",

Communities need to work together to improve 21st-\ncentury learning and increase high-school graduation rates to\nprepare more students for college and successful careers\nObama made a call to increase college graduation rates by\nthe year 2020. He laid out his desires for this initiative in the\nform of innovative strategies that promote college comple-\ntion. Less than half of new college students earn an associ-\nate's degree within 3 years or a bachelor's degree within 6\nyears (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2011). This\naffects all industries, especially agriculture. This issue is\ncompounded when we find that there continues to be a short-\nage of qualified graduates for agriculture jobs within the\nUnited States (Goecker, Smith, Smith, & Goetz, 2010). One\nreason for this shortage could be contributed to the decline in\nstudent enrollment in colleges of agriculture and agriculture\nmajors (Baker, Settle, Chiarelli, & Irani, 2013).\nThe national high-school average freshmen graduation\nrate (AFGR) is 78.2%. In the state of New Mexico, of every\n100 students who enter ninth grade, only 67 will graduate\n(Stillwell, Sable, & Plotts, 2011). This rate is even lower for\nHispanic students with a national AFGR of 71% and a state\nof New Mexico Hispanic average of 63%. Only 32% of New\nMexico high-school students were found to possess college-\nready skills in math and science (Winograd & Sallee, 2011).\nYasar (2002) found that innovative project-based learning\nincreases conceptual understanding of science and promotes\npositive attitudes toward learning science. The rate of stu-\ndent success drops further as they continue into higher edu-\nNew Mexico students who entered a 4-year degree program\ngraduated. It is secondary and post-secondary educators' job\nto reach these students through innovative programs that\nexpose these students to the rigor of college courses and\nhigher education expectations early. Such programs allow\nstudents to enter higher education better prepared and more\nlikely to succeed in academics and their careers (Bailey,\nAn innovative program that can help students succeed and\nincrease college preparation for future graduates is the agri-\nculture dual-enrollment program. Although dual enrollment/\nconcurrent enrollment options have been in use for many\nyears, agriculture-based dual-enrollment programs are not as\nprevalent. Dual enrollment (sometimes referred to as concur-\nrent enrollment) allows high-school students to enroll dually\nin their normal high-school class and a corresponding col-\nlege course (Estaci\u00f3n, Cotner, D'Souza, Smith, & Borman,\n2011). These classes can be offered as a face-to-face/online\n1Texas A&M University--Kingsville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSteven Boot Chumbley, Texas A&M University--Kingsville, 700 University\nEmail: steven.chumbley@tamuk.edu\nThe Impact of a Career and Technology\nEducation Program\nSteven Boot Chumbley1\n Keywords\ndual enrollment, agriculture education, teachers, distance learning\n2 SAGE Open\nhybrid where students participate in lab activities through\ntheir high-school courses but complete assessments (test and\nquizzes) online from the university instructor. This is also\nreferred to as blended learning (Barnett & Stamm, 2010).\nThis model has a high probability of success, because instruc-\ntors deliver the same rigorous college content while consid-\nering the pedagogical strategies that may be better at\nengaging secondary students (Karp, Bailey, Hughes, &\nThe original intent of the dual credit programs was to pro-\nvide a challenging curriculum to academically prepared\nhigh-school students (Kim, Kirby, & Bragg, 2004). As it has\nevolved, this program has become a tool to help ease the\ntransition from high school into college (Bailey & Karp,\n2003), to develop vocational skill readiness, and to reduce\ntime to a college degree (Burns & Lewis, 2000; Menzel,\n2006). These programs have been shown to help alleviate\nstudent boredom and \"senioritis\" (Klein, 2007) by allowing\nfor more independence in the learning process. Adelman\n(2006) found that rigorous and innovative course offerings\nhave a significant impact on the transition from high school\ninto college success. As these programs have become more\ncommon, they have become an option for both high- and\nlow-achieving students (Le & Frankford, 2011).\nthat momentum to completion is an important factor in a stu-\ndent's quest to obtain a college degree. When students to do\nnot obtain at least 20 credits by the end of their freshmen\nyear or choose not to enroll in postsecondary education right\nafter high school, they do not generate sufficient academic\nmomentum. This may eventually lead to failure to obtain a\ncollege degree. Barnett and Hughes (2010) also found that\nstudents who participate in dual enrollment enhance their\nchances of college admission. Participating in dual enroll-\nment has the chance to create circumstances by which stu-\ndents are reluctant to give up the credits earned. These\nstudents are perhaps more likely to experience a sense of\nachievement in their initial college credit classes and, there-\nfore, enter post-secondary education without delay after high\nschool to a greater degree than non-participants.\nStudent participation in a dual-enrollment program has\nalso showed to have an impact on students'decision of a col-\nlege major (Morrison, 2008), college persistence (Andrews,\n2001), enhancing self-confidence, and helping students see a\nconnection between academic work and career success\n(Medvide & Blustein, 2010). Dual enrollment has been\nshown to benefit underrepresented and underachieving stu-\ndents (Bailey et al., 2005), students who are enrolled in\ncareer and technology education programs, first-generation\nstudents (Farrell & Siefert, 2007), and both boys and girls\n(Karp, Calcagno, Hughes, Jeong, & Bailey, 2007).\nAlthough the benefits of dual enrollment have been\naddressed, this research study will also help with any per-\nceived barriers to program success. Critics of dual enroll-\nment have also warned about students not participating in\nthese courses until they are ready. Mead (2009) cited stu-\ndents who take courses too young or before they are ready\nmay end up becoming discouraged against any college in the\nfuture. The study's review of literature has shown that other\nconcerns exist that must be addressed for a program to be\nsuccessful. These include providing strong support systems\nfrom both secondary and university students, especially for\nminority and low-income students (Barnett & Stamm, 2010);\nengaging a broad student population (Edwards, Hughes, &\nWeisberg, 2011); providing appropriate dual course sequenc-\ning); and modeling hybrid Career and TEcnology Education\n(CTE)/academic courses that prepare students for career suc-\ncess, all while maintaining high academic standards\nAgriculture Dual-Enrollment Program Model\nThe State of New Mexico School Grading Accountability\nsystem requires that all students have taken at least one dual\ncredit/dual enrollment course or Advanced Placement (AP)\nclass to fulfill the requirements for graduation (New Mexico\nPublic Education Department, 2013). Those classes that\nwere dual-credit must have been completed successfully\n79% of the students met this criterion. It was also found that\n41% of the students limited themselves to only taking one\ncollege course during their high-school career. Established\nrelationships with school leaders, teachers, and students can\nlead to increased enrollment and success of students in dual-\nenrollment programs. Offering more diversity in course\nselections in the area of agriculture sciences will also help to\nrecruit and retain students in this high-need area.\nThe strategic plan of this program relies on four specific\ngoals for the overall program: access, accountability, afford-\nability, and student success. These courses are offered at no\ncost to the school or student and are paid for by the state.\nSchool administrators, secondary teachers, and university\nfaculty must be in agreement on the courses offered and in\nwhat format they will be taught. A memo of understanding\n(MOU) is kept on file with the high school, college, and the\nstate public education department. Teachers must be deemed\nqualified by the university faculty and most often require a\nminimum of a master's degree. Students must be at least a\njunior in classification and in good academic standing (mini-\nmum 2.5 grade point average [GPA]).\nCurrently, Eastern New Mexico University offers six dif-\nferent agriculture dual enrollment courses. These courses\ninclude introduction to animal science, dairy science, intro-\nduction to horticulture, introduction to metal fabrication,\nrural buildings construction, and principles of engines and\npower units. The 18 hr of dual-enrollment courses offered all\napply directly to majors in agricultural science. These courses\nare offered in three different formats: fully online through the\nuniversity instructor, as a hybrid online/face-to-face model\nwith the university faculty offering online content and the\nChumbley 3\nsecondary teacher leading lab activities; and solely by the\nhigh-school teacher serving as a university adjunct instruc-\ntor. It has been found that programs with the hybrid course\nmodel have a high probability of success, because instructors\ndeliver the same rigorous college content while considering\nthe pedagogical strategies that may be better at engaging sec-\nondary students.\nTo ensure program rigor, university instructors and high-\nschool teachers work together to make sure students are per-\nforming their own work and put forth the required effort.\nStudent assessments are developed by the university instruc-\ntor and are completed online through the university black-\nboard system. This increases student accountability and\nupholds the high standards and rigor of the university.\nAlthough strengths and benefits of the program have been\nidentified, areas that merit program improvement exist as\nwell. The dual-enrollment program, agriculture course offer-\nings, and how those courses are offered are continually\nchanging and adapting to best serve the needs of the students,\nsecondary schools, and the university. This research will\nassist program leaders in addressing all of these needs and\nmaking the necessary pedagogical, program, and course-\ncontent changes.\nConceptual Framework\nThis research was guided by the Concern-Based Adoption\nModel (CBAM; Hall & Hord, 2006), a conceptual frame-\nwork that describes, explains, and predicts probable teacher\nconcerns and behaviors throughout a change process. In this\ncase, the CBAM is applied to the change process of teachers\nimplementing and enrolling in the agriculture dual-enroll-\nment program. It was originally based on research that\nshowed that beginning teachers went through developmental\nstages and expressed predictable concerns at each stage as\nthey learned to teach (Hall & Hord, 2001). The model was\nlater adapted to measure concerns teachers expressed as they\nlearned to use new practices and the extent to which they\nactually implemented the innovations.\nToday's educational systems involve numerous individu-\nals responsible for facilitating change. These facilitators\nneed a means of assessing the needs of the individuals with\nwhom they work so that the most appropriate and timely\nassistance can be given. Two important kinds of assessment\ninformation CBAM provides are as follows: Concerns of the\nindividual about whatever new programs, products, or ideas\n(innovations) are being offered, delivered, or implemented,\nand individuals' knowledge of and how they use these inno-\nvations. The particular focus of this study is on teachers'\nstages of concern and levels of use components of this model.\nStages of Concern is a framework that describes the feel-\nings and motivations a teacher might have about a change in\ncurriculum and/or instructional practices at different points\nin its implementation (Sweeny, 2003).At Stage 0,Awareness,\nthe teacher has little knowledge about or interest in the\nchange. At Stage 1, Informational, the teacher is interested in\nlearning more about the innovation. Teacher concerns at\nStage 2, Personal, involves concerns about how the innova-\ntion relates to the individual. Stage 3, Management, is\nreached when the teacher begins to experiment with imple-\nmentation; at this point, teacher concerns intensify around\nthe logistics and new behaviors associated with putting the\nchange into practice. At Stage 4, Consequence, looks at con-\ncerns about the effect of the innovation on the students. Stage\n5, Collaboration, reflects teacher interest in coordinating\nwith other in using the innovation. Stage 6, Refocusing,\ninvolves thinking about making major modifications in the\nuse of the innovation, or perhaps replacing it with something\nelse.\nThe CBAM Levels of Use focuses on general patterns of\nteacher behavior as they prepare to use, begin to use, and\ngain experience implementing a classroom change (Hall &\nthe teacher has little knowledge of the change and no plans\nfor its implementation. Level I, Orientation, is when she or\nhe decides to seek more information about the change, but\nhas not made a decision to implement it. Level II, Preparation,\nis when a teacher is actively preparing to put the change into\npractice but has not actually begun to implement it in the\nclassroom. Level III, Mechanical, is when the teacher begins\nchange implementation. Level IVA, Routine, has been\nreached when the teacher is comfortable with the change and\nnot planning to amend how it is used. Most teachers settle in\nat a Routine level of use. Some, however, may actively assess\nthe impact of the innovation on their students and initiate\nchanges in the innovation or their use of it on this basis.\nThe CBAM is helpful not only in understanding the\nchange process, but also in designing change strategies. An\neffective change strategy is one that helps teachers through\nthe stages, addressing the seven concerns more or less in\nsequence (Anderson, 1997). For example, skipping the stage\nof personal concern, or not giving teachers enough time to\nwork through it, makes successful change more difficult.\nDifferent concerns always interact and are operationalized\nby users at various development points throughout the pro-\ncess. For example, the teachers' knowledge of the innova-\ntion grows through the process of implementing the\ninnovation and may affect the raising or lowering of per-\nsonal concerns.\nPurpose/Objectives\nInformation from this study can contribute to a better under-\nstanding of the agriculture dual-enrollment program partici-\npants, their opinions of course offerings, and the overall\nagriculture dual-enrollment program. The purpose of this\nstudy was to understand teacher's perceptions of the New\nMexico agriculture dual-enrollment program impact on sec-\nondary school and students. Objectives that guided the\nresearch for this study include the following:\n4 SAGE Open\n1. Determining teachers' perceptions of the impact of\nthe agriculture dual-enrollment program to areas of\nstudent success.\n2. Evaluating teachers' perceptions of the impact of the\nagriculture dual-enrollment program to secondary\nteachers.\n3. Evaluating teachers' perceptions of how the agricul-\nture dual-enrollment program's presence on a cam-\npus influences counselors.\n4. Evaluating teachers' perceptions of the overall bene-\nfit of the agriculture dual-enrollment program to the\nsecondary campus.\nMethod\nThis research used a descriptive study with open-ended\nquestions. These research methods sought to overcome\nweaknesses of a single method (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie,\n2004). After institutional review board (IRB) approval\nand individual participant agreement to participate, col-\nlection of data began. The sample population for this\nstudy was all New Mexico teachers (N = 34) who were\ncurrently offering the agriculture dual-enrollment courses\non their high-school campus out of the 90 teachers in the\nstate. We received a response rate of 84% (n = 28).\nComparison of early and late responders revealed no sig-\nnificant (p < .05) difference. Based on this information,\nthe researcher felt the findings could be generalized to the\npopulation.\nQuantitative data were collected in relation to teacher's\nperceptions on the cost and benefits of the dual-enrollment\nprogram. Teachers were asked to rank the impact of the dual-\nenrollment course offerings on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = strongly\ndisagree to 5 = strongly agree). The rating was on the dual\ncredit course offering in relation to areas of student success,\nimpacts on the high-school teacher, guidance counselor,\ncampus principal, and secondary school campus as a whole.\nTeachers were asked open-ended questions relating to the\nimpacts on students, themselves as a teacher, and the school\nas a whole, and their overall opinion of the agriculture dual-\nenrollment program. The instrument used for this study was\nthe Teacher Dual Enrollment Impact Survey, developed by\nthe National Association for Concurrent Enrollment\nPartnerships (NACEP)).\nThe NACEP is a professional organization with more than\n200 postsecondary members across the United States. Per\nNACEP guidelines, none of the \"essential questions\" was\ndeleted or modified beyond specifying course focus (in this\ncase, agriculture science). The validity of this instrument has\nbeen established through testing and usage across the coun-\ntry within the NACEP (2011). Chief academic officers at the\ninstitution were also given a chance to review drafts of the\nsurvey to ensure validity from their perspective. The reliabil-\nity of the instrument resulted in a Cronbach's alpha score of\nOpen-ended responses were solicited to investigate pro-\ngram participants' experiences because this method allowed\nresearchers to understand how people \"make sense of their\nworld\" (VanMaanen, 1979). The researcher felt this was\nappropriate with the CBAM as change within this model is\nviewed as \"a highly personal experience and involves devel-\nopmental growth in feelings and skills\" (Hall & Hord, 2001).\nOpen-ended questions were asked at the end of each Likert-\ntype scale. These were reviewed by the researcher and the\ndata analyzed using the constant comparative method (Glaser\n& Strauss, 1967). This used unitizing and categorizing of the\ndata. The constant comparative method allowed the research-\ners to repeatedly compare the responses with previous\nresponses in an attempt to discover new relationships (Dye,\nSchatz, Rosenberg, & Coleman, 2000). Following the unit-\nizing of the data, the data were coded as part of an audit trail\nto ensure confirmability (Erlandson, Harris, Skipper, &\nAllen, 1993). The units of data were sorted into emergent\ncategories of ideas.\nThe researcher used measures of credibility to ensure vali-\ndation of the study. Credibility relates to the level of confi-\ndenceintheresearcher,studydesign,andfindingstoaccurately\nrepresent the data (Ary, Jacobs, Razavieh, & Sorensen, 2010).\nCredibility was established through member checks and peer\ndebriefing. Participants were purposely selected for this study\nbased upon their experience teaching and participating in the\nagriculture dual-enrollment program. Although there is poten-\ntial to transfer this to other settings, the findings of this study\nare limited to the participants of this study in the state of New\nMexico.\nFindings\nObjective 1 sought to measure the impact of the agriculture\ndual-enrollment program on student success. Table 1 illus-\ntrates the perceived impact dual enrollment has on student\nsuccess.\nOverall teachers agreed that the program had a positive\nimpact on student success. Teachers felt the largest impact of\nthe agriculture dual-enrollment program on students'success\nwas the learning of in-depth agriculture knowledge, staying\non campus to get college credit, and gaining an appreciation\nfor the challenge of college courses.\nTeachers were also asked the open-ended question, \"What\nis the single greatest impact agriculture dual enrollment\ncourses have had on your students?\" They responded that\ninvolvement in the program led to more students getting\ninvolved in more rigorous courses and different types of stu-\ndents getting involved, encouraged them to stay in school,\nand gave them the opportunity to start college early. Examples\nof teacher comments include,\nMany of these students are the first in their family to take college\ncourse or even consider going to college. They never thought\nabout it until taking these courses.\nChumbley 5\nThis program encourages students to stay in school and take a\nserious look at post-secondary education.\nSeveral teachers saw the program as a benefit to students'\nunderstanding of college rigor, gaining confidence in their\nacademic skills, allowing them more elective options, posi-\ntively affecting their work ethic, helping them tie material to\nreal-world skills, and helping them to meet state standards\nfor graduation.\nThe second objective was to determine the perceived\nbenefit of the agriculture dual enrollment to secondary-\nschool teachers. Table 2 provides more detail on these\nfindings.\nIt was found that high-school teachers perceived the agri-\nculture dual-enrollment program as a benefit to them person-\nally. They felt that this program had the greatest impact on\ntheir ability to establish higher standards for student work,\nmaking their job more satisfying, and helping them to feel\nmore connected to their discipline. It was found that teachers\nfelt supported by the university liaisons for the program.\nOverall, they did not feel that their participation in the agri-\nculture dual-enrollment program took away from other\nduties, nor did it result in them being released from other\nschool duties.\nWhen asked, \"What is the single greatest impact the agri-\nculture dual-enrollment program has had on you as the\nteacher?\" teachers reported a variety of impacts this program\nhas on them as a teacher. These included more students get-\nting involved and increased motivation as a teacher. Multiple\nparticipants noted that it increased the rigor in their teaching\nand their knowledge of new agriculture technologies. Several\nteachers felt that it opened up more teaching options for\nthem. Two of the more experienced teachers wrote,\nIt has allowed me to view myself in a different way and evaluate\nmyself as an educator in order to improve my craft.\nIt has inspired me the continue learning and stay up with current\ninformation and trends.\nObjective 3 was evaluating teacher's perceptions of how\ndual enrollment's presence on a campus influenced counsel-\nors. Table 3 details how teachers felt this program affects\ncounselor decisions.\nThe dual-enrollment programs'impact on school counsel-\nors was found to have the lowest average of all of the areas\nof impact. They \"disagreed\" that the agriculture dual-enroll-\nment program had an impact on the way counselors enrolled\nstudents in their classes or the way they presented college\noptions to students over other areas. These were also the\nareas found to have the most variability in their responses.\nThe fourth objective was to assess teacher's perceptions\nof the benefits of the agriculture dual-enrollment program to\nthe overall secondary campus. These findings are presented\nin Table 4.\nWhen determining teachers' perceptions of the dual-\nenrollment program's impact on the overall secondary cam-\npus, teachers \"agreed\" that it had a positive impact. They felt\nthe strongest impacts of the program were in the areas of\nenhanced prestige and reputation of the high-school campus.\nThe program was shown to have a positive impact on courses\nTable 1.

They felt this program established a positive relation-\nship between the high school, the agriculture program, and\nthe university. Teachers noted that it has led to increased par-\nent and community support. Two of our teachers who have\nworked with this program for the last 2 to 3 years replied,\nIt gives the community a different view of our school. It gives\nparents and the community ideas about what our school has to\noffer our students.\nThis has been a selling point for many of the electives and it also\nhas made an impact on the student work in all classes.\nThe final question of the survey was an open response\nasking, \"What are some challenges that you have seen from\nyour involvement with the agriculture dual enrollment pro-\ngram?\" Teachers expressed that some possible challenges\nthey faced included getting all students interested in the\ncourses, aligning lab activities to match the college course\nmaterial, and finding time to develop lab activities that fit\nwith dual-enrollment agriculture courses, and that they\nwould like to have more resources from the university with\nregard to technology.\nDiscussion\nThe researchers found that overall, teachers felt the agri-\nculture dual-enrollment program had a positive impact on\nstudents, teachers, and the secondary campus as a whole.\nThere was found to be an affirmative effect on the com-\nmunity's perception of the agriculture program and high-\nschool course rigor, similar to findings by Hughes (2010).\nThese findings are comparable with previous research on\nthe benefits of dual-enrollment courses (Bailey & Karp,\nenrollment program leaders were validated in their goals\nfrom the findings on their relationships with teachers and\nthe constructive comments made within open-ended ques-\ntions. The positive impact on the campus as a whole is a\nmajor part of change adoption within the CBAM. One of\nthe primary principles of this model is that the context of\nthe school influences the process of change. The teachers'\ncomments backed up these findings as well as provided\nsome more detail in how exactly they were affected in\nthese areas.\nBased upon the comments, with regard to stages of con-\ncern, teachers were found to be in Stage 4, Consequence.\nThis is when the teacher concerns focus predominantly on\nthe impact of the change on students in their classrooms and\non the possibilities for modifying the innovation or their use\nof it to improve its effects. With regard to the framework\nlevels of use, teachers were found to be at Level IVA,\nRoutine. This involves teachers establishing a pattern of reg-\nular use and making few changes and adaptations in use of\nthe innovation.\nTeachers did not feel that the program had a highly\npositive impact on the way counselors perceived their pro-\ngrams or worked with their students. These findings were\ncounter to the findings of Medvide and Blustein (2010).\nThe findings of this study suggest that counselors are at\nthe lowest levels of concern and levels of use, awareness\nand nonuse, respectively. These findings may be due to\ncounselors having limited contact with agriculture dual-\nenrollment liaisons. By addressing the early stages of con-\ncern related to awareness and informational, the researcher\ncan successfully reach the later stages of collaboration.\nAs the school counselors advance through the stages of\nCBAM, it is the researchers' hope that this will lead to\nthem becoming advocates of the agriculture dual-enroll-\nment program.\nTable 3. Perceived Impact of the Agriculture Dual-Enrollment\nProgram in Relation to School Counselors.\nPrompt M Mode SD\nPerceived more students as capable\nof higher levels of academic\nachievement\nIncreased their knowledge of current\ncollege requirements\nDeveloped a better understanding of\nskills students need to succeed in\ncollege\nChanged the way they present college\noptions to students\nEnrolled more students in my\nagriculture science class\n*(1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).\nChumbley 7\nRecommendations for Educational\nPractice\nDual-enrollment program directors are encouraged to develop\nand present a professional development workshop for school\ncounselors to increase their level of understanding and adoption\nof the agriculture dual-enrollment program. We thought this\nwas important as the level of counselors' support was the con-\nstruct that had the lowest average scores from teachers. Using\nthe CBAM, counselors need to be better informed through\nappropriate professional development before they can advance\nfurther along the spectrums for levels of concern and levels of\nuse. As noted within CBAM, an organization does not change\nuntil the individuals within it change (Hall & Hord, 2006).\nIt is suggested that continued professional development\nshould be offered focused on the training of new teachers and\nexperienced teachers as they possibly enter the higher stages of\nconcern, which involve refocusing and the consideration of\nmaking major modifications in the use of the innovation. This\nis suggested because, even with high overall opinion scores\nfrom teachers, there is a little more than one third of the pro-\ngrams in the state that actually are taking advantage of this\nunique program offering. This should include the development\nof suggested lab activities to address some of the comments\nmade by participants. These trainings can help the high-school\ninstructors create the necessary college-like atmosphere and\nassist in pedagogical strategies necessary for student success.\nThe best way to offer this professional development that\nwill reach the largest audience is by offering it at the annual\nNew Mexico agricultural science teachers' conference. It is\nalso suggested that professional development be offered for\ncampus administrators. In Chapter 1 of their book, Hall and\ntional CBAM, one of which is that administrator support is\nvital to long-term program change and adoption.\nRecommendations for Further\nResearch\nResearch focused on the pedagogical approaches of these\ncourse offerings, both from the university instructor and the\nsecondary agriculture science teacher's teaching methods,\nwill benefit the creation of high-quality dual-credit courses.\nIt is suggested that researchers continue studying the benefit\nof students' participation in the dual-enrollment program on\ncollege entrance and success in higher education. Research\nshould also be done in relation to the reasons students take\ndual-enrollment courses and the ultimate career paths of\nthese program participants. To develop a program that is\navailable to a wide range of learners, while maintaining high\nstandards for course accountability, more research should be\ndone to find how well these programs address student vari-\nances (attitude, learning style, autonomy, etc.). It is also sug-\ngested that a similar study be conducted with school\nadministrators and school counselors to gauge their level of\nuse and stages of concern with the agriculture dual-enroll-\nment program.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This project was\nmade possible by funding from the United States Department of\nAgriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food & Agriculture\nReferences\nAdelman, C.
