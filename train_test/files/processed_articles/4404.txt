By activating\ntype 1 receptors (AT1Rs) on vascular smooth muscle cells,\nANG II elicits vasoconstriction, leading to an increase in\narterial pressure,1\u00ad4 and also, through activation of AT1Rs at\nsympathetic nerve terminals, exerts facilitatory effects on\nneural transmission.5,6 In contrast, type 2 receptors (AT2Rs)\nappear to modulate renal afferent arteriolar resistance as well\nas intra-renal production of bradykinin and nitric oxide7 and\noppose the aforementioned vasoconstrictor effects ofANG II\non AT1Rs when the RAS is activated in adult animals.8,9\nInterestingly, during the perinatal period, the RAS is also\nactivated. For example, there are increased plasma levels of\nrenin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and ANG II at\nbirth and a decline as postnatal maturation proceeds.10\u00ad17 The\nexpression ofAT1Rs andAT2Rs is also developmentally reg-\nulated, with AT2Rs predominating in the brain, adrenal gland\nand kidney of fetal and newborn rats, fowl, rabbits, sheep and\nhumans.18\u00ad31 In near-term fetal sheep and newborn lambs,\nAT2Rs are primarily expressed in systemic artery vascular\nsmooth muscle cells.32 After 2 weeks of postnatal life, there\nis a transition from AT2Rs to AT1Rs that is complete by 3\nmonths of age in sheep, when AT1Rs are the predominant\nreceptor expressed in the systemic vasculature.25,32 The\nphysiological significance of this preponderance of AT2Rs\nin major blood vessels during the perinatal period is not\nknown, as reviewed recently by us.33\nDo Angiotensin Type 2 Receptors\nModulate Haemodynamic\nEffects of Type 1 Receptors\nin Conscious Newborn Lambs?\nAngela E Vinturache and Francine G Smith\n Keywords\nNeonate, cardiovascular,AT1R,AT2R,ANG II, physiology, haemodynamics\nUniversity of Calgary, Calgary,Alberta, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nFrancine G.

These responses to ANG\nII were mediated exclusively by activation of AT1Rs in\nconscious newborn lambs under physiological conditions,\nwhereas AT2Rs did not alter these effects. From these\nobservations, we postulated that, in the newborn period\nwhen the RAS is normally activated, AT2Rs may buffer the\nhaemodynamic effects ofAT1Rs, as they do later in life.37,38\nThe present experiments were, therefore, carried out to\ninvestigate the potential role of AT2Rs in modulating the\nresponses to AT1R activation in conscious lambs, by\nexploring the haemodynamic effects of combined inhibi-\ntion of both ATRs. To this end, haemodynamic effects of an\nAT1R antagonist alone, an AT2R antagonist alone, and\nantagonists to both AT1R and AT2R combined were meas-\nured in conscious lambs aged ~1 week \u00ad when circulating\nlevels of ANG II are increased and AT2Rs predominate in\nthe conduit arteries \u00ad and ~6 weeks \u00ad when circulating\nANG II levels as well as AT2R expression are decreased.\nMethods\nExperiments were carried out in two separate age groups of\nconscious chronically instrumented lambs aged ~1 and ~6\nweeks at the time of experiments (Table 1). Animals were\nobtained from a local source (Woolfit Acres, Olds, Alberta,\nCanada) and housed with their mothers in individual pens\nin the vivarium of the Health Sciences Centre of the\nUniversity of Calgary, where they were provided with\nstandard food and water, except during surgery, training,\nand experiments. All surgical and experimental procedures\ndescribed herein were carried out in accordance with the\nGuide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals pro-\nvided by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and with\nthe approval of the Animal Care Committee of the\nUniversity of Calgary.\nSurgical procedures: Surgery was carried out using\naseptic techniques as previously described.39,40 Briefly,\nanaesthesia was induced with a mask and isoflurane (~5%)\nin oxygen, the trachea was intubated, and then anaesthesia\nwas maintained by ventilating the lungs with isoflurane\nUnder sterile conditions, catheters (Tygon\u00ae Microbore\n0.09 OD, venous catheter) were inserted into femoral ves-\nsels bilaterally and advanced to the aorta and inferior vena\ncava, respectively, for later pressure measurements, as well\nas I.V. injections of drugs and solutions. Catheters were\ntunnelled subcutaneously to exit the lamb on the right and\nleft flank, respectively. The right kidney was then\napproached retroperitoneally, and a pre-calibrated ultra-\nsonic flow transducer (size 3S\u00ad6S, Transonic Systems Inc.,\nIthaca, New York, USA) was placed around the renal artery\nfor later measurement of renal blood flow (RBF) as previ-\nously described.41 After closure of incisions, catheters and\nthe flow transducer cable were contained in pouches on a\nlamb body jacket (Lomir Inc., Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada) for\nsafe storage between experiments.\nLambs were allowed to recover from the effects of sur-\ngery and anaesthesia in a small animal critical care unit\n(Shor-line, Kansas City, KS, USA) for ~30 to 60 min, after\nwhich time they were returned to the vivarium, where they\nwere housed with their mothers until the time of the experi-\nment at least 4 days later.Antibiotics (Excenel\u00ae (Ceftriofur)\n2.2 mg/kg (Pfizer, Kirkland, QC, Canada)) were adminis-\ntered intramuscularly at 24 h intervals beginning the day\nbefore surgery for a total period of 4 days. During the\nrecovery after surgery, animals were trained daily for ~1h\nto allow them to accommodate to the supportive sling in\nwhich they were housed during experiments. This training\nperiod ensured that animals were resting quietly and accus-\ntomed to their surroundings during experiments in the labo-\nratory environment.\nExperimental details: On the day of the experiment,\nthe animals were placed in the supportive sling in the labo-\nratory environment for at least 60 min. During this time, an\nintravenous (I.V.) infusion of 5% dextrose in 0.9% sodium\nchloride at a rate of 4.17 ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7h-1 through the right fem-\noral venous catheter was initiated and continued for the\nduration of the experiment to assist in maintaining fluid\nand electrolyte balance. The left femoral catheters were\nconnected to pressure transducers (Model P23XL, Statham,\nWest Warwick, RI, USA) to continuously measure arterial\nTable 1.

The flow transducer cable was\nconnected to a flowmeter (T101, Transonics Systems) to\ncontinuously measure RBF in real-time using ultrasound\ntechnology. These haemodynamic variables were recorded\nonto a polygraph (Model 7, Grass Instruments Inc., West\nWarwick, RI, USA) and simultaneously digitized at 200\nHz using the data acquisition and analysis software pack-\nage, PolyVIEWTM (AstroMed Inc., USA).\nAt the end of each experiment, lambs were returned to\nthe vivarium, where they were housed with the ewe until\nthe next experimental day. After all experiments, animals\nwere administered a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbi-\ntone. Following postmortem inspection for verifying\ncatheters and flow transducer placement, the zero offset\nof the flow transducer was recorded for RBF measure-\nment correction. The kidneys were removed, examined\ngrossly and weighed to normalize renal haemodynamic\nmeasurements.\nExperimental protocol: Experiments were carried out\nin each animal in random order and at minimum intervals\nof 48 h in order to ensure adequate time for drug clearance\nbetween experiments.34 Each experiment consisted of con-\ntinuous haemodynamic measurements for 30 min before\n(Control) and 60 min after I.V. administration of antago-\nous haemodynamic measurements for 30 min before\n(Control) and 60 min after I.V. administration of either ZD\nmal. The three experiments were carried out in random\nadministered as an I.V. infusion of 70 \u00b5g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7h-1 following\n\u00b5g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7h-1,36 using a microprocessor-controlled syringe\npump (Mi 60-1B, World Precision Instruments Inc.,\nSarasota, FL, USA) at a rate of 4.17 ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7h-1.

In the older age group, the\nsample size was adjusted to N=11, due to the technical limi-\ntations that influenced the success rate for direct RBF\nmeasurements (i.e. transducer malfunctions).\nThe normal distribution of the data was evaluated with the\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test.

Novel findings of this\nstudy are that in both age groups: (a) the decrease in arterial\npressure which occurs following inhibition of AT1Rs was\nnot altered by concomitant inhibition of AT2Rs; (b) the\ndecrease in RVR and increase in RBF which occur after\ninhibition of AT1Rs were also not altered by concomitant\ninhibition of AT2Rs; (c) there were no effects of combined\nTogether, these data show that, under physiological condi-\ntions, AT2Rs, which are highly expressed in systemic blood\nvessels early in life, do not appear to modulate the haemo-\ndynamic effects of AT1Rs postnatally. Therefore, we con-\nclude that there is no interaction betweenAT1Rs andAT2Rs\nin modulating systemic and renal haemodynamics in the\nnewborn period under physiological conditions.\nthat systemic ANG II infusion elicits a dose-dependent\nincrease in arterial pressure, but, when administered locally\ninto the hind limb, it does not elicit a vasoconstrictor\nresponse until 2 weeks after birth, which supports earlier\nfindings of a preponderance of AT2Rs in major arteries in\nnewborn lambs. Chappellaz and Smith (2005) also meas-\nured the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to\nexogenous ANG II in conscious lambs.34 Administration of\nANG II was associated with a dose-dependent increase in\n6 weeks, and a dose-dependent decrease in RBF to the\nlambs aged 6 weeks.

More recently, Wehlage and Smith (2012) con-\nfirmed the important role of AT1Rs in influencing cardio-\nvascular homeostasis as well as the arterial baroreflex\ncontrol of heart rate early in life.36\nUnder certain conditions in adult animals and humans,\nANG II counterbalances its own vasoconstrictor effects of\nAT1R activation through vasorelaxation mediated by acti-\nvation of AT2Rs. These effects of AT2Rs are, however,\nrevealed only when (a) the RAS is activated (i.e. by a low\nFigure 2.

Therefore, the responses we\nobserved in conscious newborn lambs in the present study\ncould result from the fact that resting arterial pressure was\nnot elevated, although the aforementioned conditions (a)\nand (c) were met. It is, therefore, possible that the known\ncrosstalk betweenAT1Rs andAT2Rs is only elicited in con-\nditions of a prevailing increase in arterial pressure. This\npremise warrants further investigation.\nRecent experiments in adult rodents and humans have\nalso revealed that the haemodynamic roles for AT2Rs may\nbe species specific: in cultured cells and isolated vessels,\nas well as in vivo experiments in mice and rats, AT2Rs\nhave been implicated in counteracting the effects of\nresponse of isolated umbilical arteries to ANG II is\nincreased in the presence of the AT2R inhibitor, PD\nIn contrast, recent studies in isolated umbilical arteries\nremoved from pregnant and non-pregnant women showed\nthat ANG II induced vascular contractions were not altered\nin the presence of AT2R inhibition.47 This may implicate\nspecies differences in the role of AT2Rs in modulating\nhaemodynamic effects of AT1Rs.\nThe protective AT2R-mediated renal vasodilation48,49\nappears to occur by the renal production of bradykinin, nitric\noxide and cGMP as well as prostaglandins.50 Our hypothesis\nregarding a potential regulatory role for AT2Rs in the new-\nborn period was based upon such an assumption, that there\nwould also be a developmentally regulated crosstalk between\nthe AT1Rs and AT2Rs in mediating renal haemodynamic\neffects of ANG II. This is supported by a developmentally\nregulated intra-renal expression and distribution of ATRs in\nvarious species.27,51 The temporal and spatial profile of ATR\nexpression in the ovine kidney microvasculature during post-\nnatal development has not yet been characterized. It is con-\nceivable, however, thatATR expression, signalling pathways\nand/or modulatory effects of other vasoactive peptides may\nalso be developmentally regulated.\nThe results of the present study are intriguing, since\nAT2Rs appear to predominate in the systemic vasculature\nof developing lambs.25,32 AT2Rs are the primary subtype\nexpressed in the systemic vasculature near term and during\nthe first 2 weeks of postnatal life in sheep, after which there\nis a near complete transition from AT2Rs to AT1Rs by 3\nmonths postnatally. Based upon these observations, we\nwould expect there to be a preponderance of AT2R activity\nin the systemic vasculature in the 1-week-old lambs in the\npresent study, whereas in older lambs we would expect the\ntransition toAT1Rs to be in place. The physiological impact\nof increased ANG II levels during the perinatal period, as\nwell as the preponderance of AT2Rs in the vasculature\nearly in life, is not yet known.\nAT2Rs may function as a backup mechanism in regulat-\ning high blood pressure in the newborn period, whereas\nAT1Rs predominate in regulating both cardiovascular\nhomeostasis and the arterial baroreflex.34\u00ad36 AT2Rs may\nalso be predominantly involved in growth processes at cel-\nlular and subcellular level at this age, while a haemody-\nnamic component of their function may develop later in\nlife. While this assumption is interesting, more studies are\nrequired to elucidate the perhaps more complex physiologi-\ncal roles for AT2Rs in the newborn period. The current\nfindings may impact therapeutic choices in human infants\nwith high prevailing blood pressure, as well as contribute a\nnew perspective to explaining the developmental origins of\nchronic adult disease.\n"
