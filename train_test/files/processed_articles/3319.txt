    "abstract": "Abstract\nFamilies sometimes face prolonged and frequent absences of a parent due to employment in industries that require work\naway or for military deployment. Many families, however, are finding ways to survive and thrive. Within Australian Defence\nForce (ADF) families, despite the high stress and inherent danger, most do cope, displaying strength and resilience. Limited\nresearch has been conducted with Australian military families with young children, even less focusing on protective factors.\nThere is particularly a dearth of research about families who have left the ADF or who have experienced the death of an\nADF parent. This study offers unique insights through exploring family experiences of parental deployment by applying\na socioconstructivist approach from data derived through narrative research. Protective factors were identified through\nrelationships, the ADF, social media, community organizations, government departments, and digital communication\ntechnologies. Understanding how these families manage and the protective factors they utilize may enable early childhood\neducators and family support services to better understand family resilience, and thus provide appropriate services for\nmilitary families with young children.\n",

This stress places other individual family\nmembers, as well as the whole family unit, at risk and con-\ntributes to higher levels of workplace attrition (Pincombe &\nPincombe, 2010). Risk factors are experiences and issues\nthat place strain on the well-being of the family unit, and thus\nthe children. In particular, Pincombe and Pincombe (2010)\nnoted that families who are apart are likely to grow further\napart the longer the separation.

Protective factors\nare \"experiences that can help the development of positive\nsocial and emotional skills, essential for good mental health\"\n(Australian Government & Beyondblue, 2014). Within mili-\ntary families, despite the stresses of deployment, most fami-\nlies seem to manage short-term separations that are less than\n6 months (Flake, Davis, Johnson, & Middleton, 2009), and\nshow strengths and resiliency (Jensen-Hart, Christensen,\nDutka, & Leishman, 2012; Sheppard, Malatras, & Israel,\n2010). To date, much research has been focused on under-\nstanding the impacts of deployment on families and children,\nbut little is understood about the protective factors that oper-\nate to support families throughout the deployment cycle\nKnowledge about family stressors helps direct policy makers\nto work toward reducing stresses within the workplace and\nthe broader community, and may contribute to raising the\nawareness of professionals who collaborate with families.\nThis study uses the socioecological model, created by\nBronfenbrenner (1986), to explain both the origins and effects\nof the stresses military families face and the protective factors\nthat buffer them during difficult times. The model is made up of\nconcentric circles and places the child at the individual level at\nthe center. The next layer of the model is the microsystem, made\nup of those people the child has direct contact with. This typi-\ncally includes immediate family members, peers, health work-\ners, and educators. The levels of congruence within the\nmicrosystem are termed the mesosystem (Grace, Hayes, &\nWise, 2016). The next layer consists of those people the child\nnormally does not have regular contact with and is called the\nexosystem. This may include parent's workplaces, community\nservices, government policies, media, family friends, and\nextended family that live away. The macrosystem surrounds the\nexosystem and is made up of the culture, ideologies, economy,\nand global issues. Finally, within the model, the chronosystem is\nthe changes that occur over time for the individual child due to\ndevelopmental changes or changes in circumstances. This\nmodel takes into account the changeable physical, social, and\npsychological environment in which they live (Grace et al.,\n2016). In such a view, children are impacted by their environ-\nment but also impact upon their environment. The following\nsections outline the relevant literature that underpins the study.\nCharacteristics of Healthy Family\nFunctioning\nHealthy family functioning is about families spending time\ntogether, building and maintaining intimate relationships.\nThese intimate relationships involve supporting, sharing, and\ncaring for each other within the family unit, and it includes\ncouples, children, other kin, and family friends (Poole, 2011).\nAccording to Sims (2002), strong families are flexible and\nview change positively, work together to cope, can identify\nwhen outside assistance is needed and connect with extended\nfamily, friends, community, and their culture. Shimoni and\nBaxter (2008) believed that strong families effectively com-\nmunicate, value one other, have a shared belief, and balance\ntheir needs. In addition, they support others in times of need\nand try to reconcile differences (Sims, 2002). The ability to\nmaintain levels of intimacy and family strength is challenged\nwhen a family member is absent for significant periods of\ntime, such as when a parent is away for work. Currently, this\noccurs among families who experience long absences of at\nleast one parent due to military deployment or employment\non oilrigs. Other families may experience frequent parental\nabsences for military training, transport industry require-\nments, and Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) and Drive-In-Drive-Out\n(DIDO) mining rosters. These frequent absences can be just\nas difficult as prolonged absences, as Hubinger, Parker, and\nCalavarino (2002) explained the frequent separations and\nreintegrations are emotionally draining.\nProtective Factors in Military Families\nAlthough the study of protective factors within military fam-\nilies is limited, and much more is needed, this section out-\nlines some of the findings within the literature. For\nnondeployed spouses, Spera (2009) found that military \"unit\nrelationship quality, leadership effectiveness, and tangible\nsocial support from community members\" were the most\nimportant protective factors to well-being (p. 286). For\nreturned personnel, Rentz et al. (2007) outlined that protec-\ntive factors such as disciplinary measures particular to the\nmilitary may help decrease the prevalence of family violence\nand addictions, but unfortunately these measures may\nincrease the likelihood of nondisclosure due to stigma and\nfear of curtailed career progression. For children experienc-\ning difficulties during deployment, Saltzman et al. (2011)\nexplained that nurturing and adaptive parenting are the most\nimportant protective factors. For families, Andres and\nCoulthard (2015), in a cross-country comparison, found that\neffective communication was a protective factor. In the\nAustralian Timor-Leste study, identified protective factors\nincluded parental and child well-being, relationship quality,\naccess to care, social support, and the family's ability to\nfunction during times of increased stress (McGuire et al.,\n2012). Importantly, the Timor-Leste study did not explore\nthe role of other protective factors addressed in this article:\nrelationships with educators support through social media,\nrelationship quality through digital communication technol-\nogy, effective parenting, and economic security.\nStresses and Risk Factors Caused by\nWork-Related Parental Absences and\nDeployment\nDeployment itself causes ongoing stress for the deployed\nparent, even after they are back at home. Deployment for\nRogers-Baber 3\ncombat, peacekeeping, and border protection can result in a\ncombat stress response (CSR; Pincombe & Pincombe, 2010),\nmoral injury (Sherman, 2010), or mental health issues,\nincluding depression, addictions, posttraumatic stress disor-\nder (PTSD), and violence. Compounding this issue is a\nstrong acculturation process that positions seeking help as a\nroute to potential dismissal and the impact disclosure could\nhave on their career progression (Crompvoets, 2012).\nStressors unique to shorter or lengthy parental absences and\nstressors that are common across all parental absences are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nPalmer (2008) and Pincus, House, Christenson, and Adler\n(2007) outlined the reasons military families are at risk, both\nas a family unit and as individuals due to the ongoing stresses\nthey experience. For families, poor access to communication\nwas found to be a risk factor by Andres and Coulthard (2015)\nin a cross-country comparison. For children, some risk fac-\ntors are associated with the nondeployed parent's reduced\nability to manage effectively due to the stress of parenting\nalone.\nStrengths-Based Approach\nStrengths-based approaches are more commonly accepted as\nthe best way to assist families, but conversely Wilson (2016)\nreported that the evidence to confirm this approach is only just\nemerging. Concentrating on the negative is a legacy of the\nmedical model that adheres to a deficit model of human behav-\nior (Graybeal, 2001). It is an approach many professionals\ncling to because of their conventional instruction in this\napproach (Sims, 2002) and one that infiltrates policy makers.\nStrengths-based practice is grounded in the concept that\nstrong families not only cope but also flourish despite the\nstressors they face. Bowes and Warburton (2012) described\nfamily strengths that arise from the way families communi-\ncate, problem solve, make decisions, interact and sustain\nrelationships. The operation of these strengths changes over\ntime as families respond to stress inside and outside the fam-\nily (Bowes & Warburton, 2012). A more comprehensive list\nof the characteristics of strong families that has been adapted\nTable 1.

It is important to note\nthat risk and protective factors are not static within families\nFurthermore, Sims (2002) identified a number of protective\nfactors within the various levels of the ecological family sys-\ntem, as outlined by Bronfenbrenner (1986), starting from\nindividual characteristics and moving through the various\nlayers where government decisions and policies within the\nmacrosystem impact on the family and child.\nOnce these strengths and resources have been identified,\nprofessionals can work with families on utilizing the\nresources to improve the current issues or situation\nprocess empowers individuals and families. It helps children\nto utilize support factors within the community and family\n(Allison et al., 2003), thus building resilience through the\nprovision of services. For early childhood educators, the\nstrengths-based model aligns with Vygotsky's notion of\nthe Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky & Cole, 1978)\nbecause it begins with what children are familiar with and\nwhat they can already manage (Sims, 2011). This complex\nprocess involves empowering the parents and children as\nthey acquire and demonstrate the language skills and prac-\ntices effective in the context in which they are operating. In\nthe strengths-based approach, it is hoped that eventually\nthese acquired skills become established behaviors within\nthe family.\nProtective Factors\nThe study here concentrates on the protective factors that\nenable families with young children attending early child-\nhood services to manage and thrive under difficult circum-\nstances. The wide variety of these factors may be useful for\nprofessionals and policy makers who work with these fami-\nlies by revealing a broad picture of families' capacities and\nlimitations. Concentrating on families with young children\nemphasizes the importance of the early years. Internationally,\nresearch corroborates easier access to quality education and\ncare in the early years that is acknowledged by the Australian\nGovernment's programs and policies (Arthur, Beecher,\nCloser examination of the protective factors is useful\nbecause it enables support services and professionals, includ-\ning early childhood educators, to understand and explore\nfamily strengths, and thus provide appropriate resources.\nImportantly, engaging effectively with potentially vulnerable\nfamilies and children in early childhood settings is vital\nbefore crisis intervention is necessary and negative behav-\niors have become entrenched (Bowes, Hayes, Cashmore, &\nHodge, 2012). In early childhood settings, parents are more\nlikely to actively engage in authentic partnerships with edu-\ncators and associated professionals; and, through the build-\ning of relationships and trust, information exchange and\nprovisions can be targeted where there is apparent need\n(Wilson, 2016). While globally there has been \"an increased\nrecognition of the importance of the early years\" (Arthur,\nBeecher, Death, Dockett, & Farmer, 2012, p. 2) due to fund-\ning shortages within Australia, early intervention programs\noften focus on the families who are either in crisis or have the\nhighest need (Bowes, Hayes, et al., 2012). This lack of fund-\ning to preventive programs transfers the responsibility to\nparents, early childhood educators, and family workers to\nsource the information and provision needed to effectively\nassist children who are living under stressful circumstances,\nsuch as the absence of a parent due to work.\nThis study focuses on the protective factors identified\nwithin three families with young children who experienced\nprolonged parental deployments and frequent, short-term\nparent training periods away from home during Australian\nDefence Force (ADF) service. The data allow us to examine\ntheir experiences and importantly give us rare insight into a\nfamily who had left the ADF and another who has experi-\nenced a death of a parent.\nMethod\nIn this study, a narrative methodology was employed that\ninvolves rebuilding individual experiences within personal\nTable 2.

While narrative\nresearch is considered a contemporary approach, Clandinin\nand Rosiek (2007) argued that we have discussed the stories\nwe tell for about as long as we have been telling them.\nGottschall (2012) believed that humans have been telling\nstories since they have been on earth, and this ability is what\nsets humans apart as a species. Narrative methodologies\nhave become increasingly popular in the fields of social sci-\nence bringing with them higher levels of analysis and dis-\ncourse around stories and their importance in our lives\n(Clandinin & Rosiek, 2007). This study examines the stories\nparticipants share about their experiences of deployment and\ntheir interpretations of these stories.\nParticipants\nThe participants were engaged through convenience sam-\npling of three families. The families were invited to partici-\npate due to their involvement in a storybook project about\ndefense families as part of a larger, unpublished doctoral\nstudytitled\"YoungChildren'sExperienceandUnderstanding\nof Deployment Within an ADF Family.\" The unique data\nfrom these three families, including five children, were sepa-\nrated into a subset, as summarized in Table 3. The three fami-\nlies represent two different Australian states and were from\nthree different military bases.\nCaleb, from Family 1, had left the defense force during the\nperiod of data collection. In Family 2, Nathan had come home\non leave briefly after the birth of Michael; however, he was\nkilled in action very soon after he returned to active service.\nIn Family 3, Seb was undergoing extensive training (away\nfrom home) to prepare him for further deployments. Table 3\nlists the ages of the children at initial contact with the family,\nalthough the data were collected using various methods over\na 3-year time frame. Small-scale studies such as this often\nface issues of identity protection of participants. Newman and\nPollnitz (2005) discussed the importance of maintaining self-\nsufficiency, and managing personal information and identity.\nFor this reason, the data have been scrambled between fami-\nlies, pseudonyms were used, and some of their details were\nchanged.\nTo understand the context of the participants, it is impor-\ntant to have a degree of knowledge concerning the ADF as an\nemployer. As one of the biggest employers in Australia, the\nADF has more than 80,000 permanent and reserve personnel\n(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012) working across the\nNavy, Airforce, and Army. Most of these employees are at an\nage at which they have a young family or are starting to have\nchildren. The ADF (2013) described deployment as normally\nlasting 3 to 9 months, and may involve peacekeeping, strate-\ngic, or combat operations. Redeployment rates are as high as\n33% of all personnel who stay with the ADF. Attrition rates\nare of concern for the ADF (Department of Defence, 2010)\ndue to the loss of skills and the high cost of training and\nrecruitment.\nData Collection and Analysis\nData were collected over a period of 3 years via face-to-face\ninterviews, emails, and phone conversations with families\nutilizing the mode of contact that suited families and the\nresearcher at the time. Contact with the families for inter-\nviews and conversations occurred 4 to 6 times during this\nperiod. The interviews were semistructured, and questions\ncentered on themes about their experiences of deployment as\nparents, coparents and as a couple. I also explored their per-\nceptions of the children's experiences and understandings\nand the protective factors they utilized. Member checking\noccurred by presenting the parents with various data outputs\nfor validation. To increase researcher integrity and reflexiv-\nity, I maintained a reflective journal during the process, and\ndiscussed the findings and themes with other academics and\nresearch supervisors to monitor any inherent bias. The par-\nents were positioned as knowledgeable source of informa-\ntion about their children. In narrative data collection, thick,\nrich descriptions of the contexts, environment, participators'\nemotions, and nuances are necessary to enable the researcher\nTable 3.

Once this awareness was constructed, analy-\nsis of the data was undertaken.\nData were analyzed using a thematic approach and appli-\ncation of Bronfenbrenner's (1986) socioecological frame-\nwork to understand the way families created meaning in their\nlives. The steps in narrative analysis included first an immer-\nsion in the data. Second, a narrative retelling of the data was\ncreated from all sources of data for each family while keep-\ning in mind the adult's role and authority in the children's\nlives. Third, these family narratives were developed from\nthemes within the framework, emerging from the data by\ninductive analysis. Fourth, the data were inspected again,\nmoving from description to an interpretation of participants'\naccounts within the research themes (Willis, 2013). Narrative\nanalysis is a useful method in this research field because it\nbrings out the hidden voice (Spector-Mersel, 2010) and\nemphasizes that there is not one truth or interpretation. As\nReissman (2005) explained, narrative analysis can create\nlinks between stories and social and political organization.\nThe next section explores the themes identified within the\ndata.\nOverview of Protective Factors\nEmploying Bronfenbrenner's Model as\na Framework for Analysis\nA major theme that emerged from the data was the importance\nof protective factors in the young children's life and their fam-\nily. These factors encompassed relationships, the ADF, com-\nmunity provisions, and communication and technology. These\nthemes reflect the concept of resilience by focusing on positive\noutcomes and utilizing a strengths-based approach as described\nby Cologon and Hayden (2012). When examining resilience,\nthe relationship between protective factors, susceptibilities, and\nliabilities is highlighted (Cologon & Hayden, 2012). The qual-\nity of the protective factors within the layers of the socioeco-\nlogical family system will often affect the families' ability to\nsurvive the deployment cycle. Being a member of the defense\ncommunity builds resilience because of the protective factors it\nprovides (Baber, Fussell, & Porter, 2015). In this study, the nar-\nrative data reveal varying protective factors within the case\nstudy families across the four levels of Bronfenbrenner's\nThemes From the Data\nIn the next section, each identified protective factor is exam-\nined in turn with reference to the layers within the socioeco-\nlogical model. The identified protective factors are\nsummarized in Figure 2.\nProtective Factors Provided by Relationships\n(Microsystem)\nThe protective factors provided by relationships with sib-\nlings, parents, family friends, extended family, educators,\nand teachers are explored in the next three sections.\nSibling relationships\nThe kids fought at times over time on the phone with Seb.\nDavina would stay on the phone for a long time just listening to\nDaddy's voice and trying to talk and Brian would get very cross\nwhen he had to wait.\nRogers-Baber 7\nTypical of sibling relationships, Brian and Davina in Family\n3 exhibited some competition for parental attention, as evi-\ndenced by the verbal and physical altercations over phone\ncalls with their deployed father. Conversely, Fiona from\nFamily 1, as a positive response, identified sibling assistance,\nrole flexibility, and emotional support:\nSam was also helpful at home, he would bring me toys and give\nme cuddles, bring me the tissue box if I was crying and help with\nthe bins, gardening and feeding the dogs. He would also help me\nto get Jess ready sometimes if we were going out.\nParenting relationships\nI had some photo books made with photos of Caleb and the kids.\nWe also video-recorded Caleb reading to the children that they\nloved to watch. We made up a special calendar so Sam could\nmark the days he was away with stickers. He didn't understand\nthe difference between deployment and going to work, which\ncreated huge meltdowns when Caleb was home after deployment\nand then said he was going to \"work.\"\nWe were all having trouble sleeping and Brian was having\nnightmares. It just saved the fights at the time and was much\neasier on everyone. I think I just had to get through it at the time\nby doing things my way.\nIn Family 3, Brenda displayed responsive and supportive\nparenting by adjusting to the children's physical and emo-\ntional responses and allowing them into her bed, and by pro-\nviding support to help Sam understand the concepts of\ndeployment. In Family 1, as shown below, both Caleb and\nFiona showed role flexibility during the initial time of reinte-\ngration. In addition, Caleb and Fiona revealed parenting\nstrengths and emotional support for their children by revisit-\ning unresolved issues the children had. They were surprised\nthe children's emotional issues were still evident a year after\nCaleb had left the ADF:\nAfter Afghanistan Caleb decided to take a step back for the\nre-integration period. This meant I took care of them and all\ndiscipline was handled by me for the first couple of weeks.\nI was surprised to see how upset Sam got since Caleb hasn't\nbeen away for a large stint since last year. It has shown me how\nmuch they have held onto the emotions they used to feel when\nhe was away and how raw it obviously still is for them. It was a\ngood chance for Caleb to have a good chat to them about the\nwhole thing.\nCoparenting relationships\nFamily 1 Caleb\nWe had never planned as a family that I would be there forever.\nIn the end it came down to more time away for promotion and I\nwas away all of 2012, came home in February for 6 weeks, then\nhome for 2 weeks then away for 3-4 months again. The main\nreason I left was just lifestyle. It was the right decision for our\nfamily to leave.\nFamily 1 Fiona\nWhen Jess turned 3 we realized Caleb had only been there 1 year\nof her life. All the time away was the big issue for us. Caleb had\nmissed the first soccer games and other big events in the\nchildren's lives. Getting used to Caleb being home full-time\ntook a while for the children. Sam acted out at him being home\nall the time and would avoid him and Jess did not want to speak\nto him in the mornings. She would completely ignore him at\nother times. I told Caleb the kids were \"punishing him\" for\nhaving been away for so long. Since leaving things are much\neasier for us all. We can plan events and know we will all be\nthere, including the holidays. The uncertainty is gone. The\nchildren are more settled. It's great knowing the time you have\nwill be yours as a family.\nThese data reveal Family 1's ability to make career decisions\nin the interest of family cohesion, showing flexibility with\ngoals and arrangements. It displays the family's ability to\nmove on positively despite lingering issues from the past,\nsuch as the children's behaviors. It shows their ability to\nfocus on the improvements such changes have brought to the\nfamily as a whole, regardless of the drawbacks of financial\nand career sacrifices. In the example below, Brenda from\nFamily 3 exhibited determination to spend time together as a\nfamily unit, despite her husband's protests. It demonstrates\nSeb's struggles with reintegration as a parent when decisions\nFigure 2. Identified protective factors within the families'\nsocioecological model.\nNote. ADF = Australian Defence Force.\n8 SAGE Open\nhave been made he disagrees with and children have devel-\noped new skills and matured in his absence. The vignette\ndemonstrates Brenda's empathetic response, by avoiding\nblame for the difficulties that arose during reintegration:\nI made him come away on a family holiday soon after he came\nback. He didn't want to, but it made a big difference to reconnect.\nIt is hard as the kids were up to different stages so he was often\nbabying them and they didn't want to be babied. Nine months is\na long time in a young child's life and they changed a lot. He was\nalso really upset by some of the parenting decisions I had made\ninhisabsence.Itwashardhavingthoseveryhonestconversations\nwhere he was saying he thought those decisions were wrong. I\nmade them to cope during that tough time. Issues like the kids\ncoming and sleeping in our bed.\nHe was really tired (during reintegration) and tried sleeping\nduring the day to catch up. The kids just made really loud noises\nsuddenly and he would be angry at being woken up. I kept\nsaying: \"They are just young kids, Seb.\" He said it is hard\nbecause when you are on base you are with adults for 9 months,\nbut adults who are good at following orders. When he came\nhome, he was dealing with a toddler and a preschooler.\nSpousal relationships (individual)\nBefore he deployed there was a family information session\ndefence put on where they said not to bother your partner with\nthings that can be solved by yourself or with support at home.\nThey also said to avoid telling them things that might play on their\nmind and affect them on duty. That made it really hard. Jess was\nreally sick and we were in and out of hospital and medical visits\nand testing a lot for many months and I couldn't mention it except\nto downplay the seriousness of it. Caleb's Aunt also got really ill\nand I couldn't mention that either. It was weird when he came\nback as we had lots of conversations where I had to explain to him\nwhat really happened. That was hard as he felt he was lied to.\nI was not told to hold back any information from Seb, but I felt\nguilty if I told him how bad things were at home and how hard\nI was finding it. There was a period of about 2 months when\nthe children were continually sick between the two of them\nand I was really struggling with very little sleep. After it was\nover, I told him. Then he was really upset I had held that back\nfrom him and he felt really guilty I had gone through that by\nmyself.\nIn this study, two families spoke of the issues around protect-\ning each other from what was happening at home. One fam-\nily was told by theADF to keep stressful issues to themselves\nto avoid distracting the deployed parent. The other nonde-\nployed parent just kept quiet about her struggles without\nbeing instructed by defense personnel to do so. Both\nnondeployed parents spoke of the later difficulties this\ncaused in their communication when the deployed parent\neventually realized the truth. Similarly, the deployed parents\ndid not share detailed matters of defense with their spouses\nto avoid burdening them with what they were witnessing and\nexperiencing and for security reasons.\nAt the individual level of Bronfenbrenner's (1986) model,\nparents choose to filter the information given to the other\nspouse, and the nondeployed parent often controls what the\nchildren communicate to soften the news. Brooks (2011)\nstressed the importance of establishing boundaries about\nwhat is shared in communication. Minute details may be\noverwhelming for deployed parents, and they may become\ndistracted through worrying about how to solve issues at\nhome when they are away (Brooks, 2011). Conversely,\nTomforde (2015) explained one coping strategy of the\nspouses of German deployed military personnel that involved\nwriting everything down, including all the emotions they\nwere experiencing in letters or diaries. Carefully chosen\nexcerpts of the diaries were sent to the deployed spouse dur-\ning deployment or left at home for them to read when they\nreturned. In their U.S.-based research, Andres, De Angelis,\nand McCone (2015) discovered that deployed spouses gener-\nally protected their spouse by keeping military operations to\nthemselves. Family members at home may become anxious\nif the deployed parent shares too much about their operations\nor surrounds (Brooks, 2011). In line with these family's\nexperiences, stress can be caused by unhealthy family com-\nmunication patterns which include both ignoring other fam-\nily members and sharing too much information (Dekel,\nFamily friends and extended family relationships\nMy parents were great during both deployments, but especially\nthe first because I moved in with them. There was another\nmother whose husband was a FIFO worker (Fly in Fly Out\nminer). I don't think I would have survived without her.\nWe were living in Army accommodation and then he found out\nhe was to be deployed. They offered me the option of relocating\nto be with my family as we were both away from family at the\nbase.\nBefore he left, we moved to the coast to be near my Mum and\nDad so I could have that support when he deployed. We had\nlots of sleepovers with them and they would look after me. It's\nnice going home and someone caring about me. The kids also\njust go there and I have a break sometimes. Working part time,\nhaving the kids and coping by yourself is hard, so they are a\nbig help.\nRogers-Baber 9\nThe narrative data demonstrated that nondeployed parents\nfound assistance during their first deployment experience\nfrom their own parents. The ADF offered families the oppor-\ntunity to relocate to be near other family members during\ndeployment, and families were grateful for the ADF's facili-\ntating role. The extended family provided both physical and\nemotional support. Some of the nondeployed parents viewed\nthis support as offering opportunities to catch up on rest,\nhelping them cope with the demands of parenting alone, and\nalleviating their feelings of being stretched. Relocation\ncloser to extended family also provided opportunities for\nparents to access child minding that enabled them to social-\nize, thus reducing their feelings of isolation. The parents\noften cited benefits, including special time for the children\nwith their grandparents and other extended family.\nInterestingly, following the death of a parent, the ADF sever-\ning these supports was taken personally during such an emo-\ntional time, as shown in the excerpt below:\nI took up the offer (of relocating to her parent's house) and most\nof our belongings were packed up and left in a Commonwealth\nStorage Facility for when Nathan returned. Six months after the\nfuneral they moved our belongings down to my mother's house\nbecause they could no longer be in a Commonwealth Storage\nFacility. I was no longer considered a defence family. That was\na rude shock. You are not really in or out after they die.\nIn Family 1, Fiona's narrative data identified that she found the\nsecond deployment, when she had two young children, more\ndifficult than the first when she had only one child. She and her\nchildren did not relocate to be near her own parents during the\nsecond deployment and when both children were very sick for\nan extended period, her narrative outlined how difficult and\nstressful she found this experience. Given the absence of fam-\nily close by, both Fiona and Caleb reported how they found the\nphysical and emotional encouragement given by a family\nfriend as critical to their coping. The friend, who was in a simi-\nlar situation because her husband worked away as a FIFO\nworker at a mine site, was more easily able to empathize and\nrespond appropriately. Fiona was not living on a military base\nat the time, reducing the amount of available support.\nEducators and teacher relationships\nThe Early Childhood teacher was great and helped me access\nfunding for a specialist for Michael due to his hyperactivity. His\nschool teacher is not very helpful getting a letter organized to help\nwith funding now that he has been diagnosed with ADHD and\nAsperger's. The school counsellor has had a chat to Michael too.\nIn Family 2, Wendy emphasized the importance of a support-\nive early childhood educator who was able to help source\ndefense funding for her son Michael's additional learning\nneeds. Subsequently, Wendy had more difficulty building\nthis type of relationship with Michael's first primary school-\nteacher, and this affected the provision of additional school\nassistance. She believed that Michael's education suffered\nbecause of the difference of opinion about the need to access\nfunding to support his learning difficulties. In the excerpt\nbelow, Fiona from Family 1 stressed the importance of the\nprovision and knowledge of Sam's early childhood educator\nwho was able to suggest effective strategies to assist family\ncommunication. Sam initially reacted with joy for the first\nfew days when his father returned from deployment or\nlengthy training episodes. This subsequently changed to\nongoing displays of anger and refusals to speak to his father\nor be physically near him for a number of weeks, affecting\nthe father's anxiousness about reintegration each time.\nInterestingly, Caleb attributed the eventual improvement to\nSam's increasing maturity:\nFamily 1 Fiona\nSam's preschool teacher was amazing and had child psychology\ntraining. She was very helpful with Sam's phases and behavior\nand encouraged us to have conversations with Sam when he was\nacting out before the deployment. She told us Sam might have\nbeen behaving like that because of the things he may have\noverheard about deployment. We took her advice and put a map\nof the world in Sam's room with a star where we lived and one\nwhere Caleb was going to Afghanistan. Once we explained it, all\nthe behaviour stopped immediately.\nFamily 1 Caleb\nAfter East Timor and then during the extra time away, Sam had\na rebellion against me I suppose you would say. This improved\nwith age. There was some nervousness about coming home and\ntrying to fit back in with the children, especially after Sam's\nepisodes of not wanting to have anything to do with me.\nProtective Factors Within the Exosystem and\nMacrosystem\nADF support\nFamily 1 Fiona\nThe Padre was really good and the social worker was helpful.\nThere was also a head person to email if anything was needed\nand he was really excellent. The welfare people called a few\ntimes and I totally panicked of course. Those calls were really\nreassuring though, after I calmed down. It was great to know\nthat they were checking up that we were OK. For our personal\nexperience I really don't think there was much more they (the\nADF) could have done for us. We were given a book on dealing\nwith deployment that was very informative and helpful. They\ncovered everything from the emotions of deployment to a\nchecklist of things we should organise before Caleb left. It also\ngave tips to deal with the homecoming. I had been given a list of\nall the numbers and email addresses of all people we could\ncontact if I needed help or had any questions. There was a\nfarewell parade before Caleb left which was turned into a family\nday where all families got to meet each other and meet people\nlike the welfare officer. For us I think they prepared us very well\nand I never felt like they were not supportive of us.\nFamily 1 Caleb\nThere was one talk we went to one day. It was a seminar and\nthere were some handouts. The Welfare Officer and Padre were\nalso available.\nFamily 1 identified Army Unit days as useful to connect with\nother families and ADF support staff. Information shared\nverbally and in booklets at predeployment family events was\nconsidered relevant and helpful. Being able to meet support\nstaff, such as Padres and social workers, for possible later\naccess was seen as useful. For Family 2, there had been a\nchange in the chronosystem as Wendy had once enjoyed\nthese days. Attendance at such events since the death of her\nhusband on deployment had been difficult as she did not feel\npart of the defense culture anymore and found it hard to\nrelate to families who had not experienced this type of loss,\nalthough her son enjoyed them and gave him an opportunity\nof mixing with other fathers. Wendy found the ADF-funded\ntrip to the overseas base very helpful to give meaning and\nclosure to her spouse's death:\nArmy days are hard with the hierarchy and feeling like I am not\nreally part of the defence culture anymore. I find it hard to connect\nwith other defence families at Army unit days. It is hard to hear\nthe other wives whining about how tough they have it when their\nhusbands are on night duty. Michael enjoys them though and\ntends to gravitate toward the other Dads. He gets upset when he\nsees other Dads at school or at the park. I got a lot of closure when\nI was allowed with a small group of other families toAfghanistan.\nI got to see Nathan's room, and got some understanding of what\nhis work was like over there for him at the base.\nOrganization (exosystem) and government department (macro-\nsystem) support\nLegacy have been helpful, but mostly are older. They got me a\nnew computer. The local RSL (Returned Services League)\nbranch have been a great support. The Defence Trust is also\nthere to help but I am not entitled to the Commando Trust\nbecause I was given the wrong paper work by the Department of\nVeteran Affairs. (DVA)\nA number of charity organizations and Australian\nGovernment Departments assist military and veteran\nfamilies. The veteran's charity organization, Legacy, had\nprovided funding to Wendy and her son Michael (Family 2),\nand the organization also offered ongoing emotional care.\nOther assistance was welcomed from the local branch of the\nReturned Services League (RSL). After her spouse's death,\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs had issued the wrong\nform for Wendy's claims, thus limiting her entitlements.\nThey had, however, funded a number of needed resources\nbut not to the level she was entitled.\nProtective Factors Utilizing Communication and\nTechnology\nBoth positive and negative communication and technology\nissues arose from the data with families during respective\ndeployment cycles.\nSocial media (macrosystem)\nI am close to other war widows in our Facebook group. They\nhave been a great support and know what it is like. I could access\nit (counselling) but it would be a waste of time. How would a\ncounsellor know what I was going through? They have not\nexperienced the death of a husband and the father of their child.\nI just talk to my Facebook group.\nAt the macrosystem level, Wendy (Family 2) took great\ncomfort in the emotional support offered by a group of\nyoung war widows who communicated using FacebookTM.\nConversely, Wendy did not access the ADF-supplied coun-\nselors who she felt would not understand her. She felt her\nsituation was unique and that being a war widow was not\nsomething counselors would understand or could assist\nwith.\nCare packages (macrosystem)\nHe sent some parcels and we sent him a care package most\nweeks. We would cook his favourite biscuits and send drawings\nthe kids did and other things.\nCare packages are parcels containing presents and nonperish-\nable food sent from home to deployed parents. Items from the\ndeployed parent can also be sent, often containing toys or tour-\nist items depending upon the nature and area of deployment.\nDuring deployment, the family or deployed parent can post one\npackage a week free of charge. Parents from two of the case\nstudy families cited care packages as an effective communica-\ntion strategy for the families at home to communicate with the\ndeployed parent. Parents who discussed this type of communi-\ncation used the packages to show children's artwork and send\nfavorite food items they had baked with the children.\nVideo conferencing and phone calls (macrosystem)\nFamily 1 Caleb\nI was able to use SkypeTM most days and that was great. It was\nreally helpful to me to be able to see them and know they were\nsafe and OK.\nFamily 1 Fiona\nHe was able to use SkypeTM most days. He said he found that\nreally helpful being able to see us every day and know we were\nOK. I found it very draining. Phone calls are better as Caleb can\nbe on speakerphone and I can keep attending to the children and\ndo housework while we chat. SkypeTM sessions every night\nmeant you had to be totally available for an hour at a really bad\ntime of night. The kids and I were both tired, the kids were\nwhingey and sometimes it was the last thing you felt like doing.\nI did it anyway and of course would never tell him how much I\nhated it.\nSkypeTM and phone calls helped. Sundays were special SkypeTM\ndays once a fortnight normally. There were no mobile phones or\ntexts. Seb left his phone at home.\nAnother type of communication technology, video-confer-\nencing software, such as SkypeTM was often utilized by fami-\nlies during deployment when it is available. For one family\nwithin this study, utilizing such services was a pleasant\nweekly event, looked forward to by all concerned even\nthough it involved the deployed parent lining up for lengthy\nperiods of time. For another family, the deployed parent took\ngreat comfort in the ability to see and hear his family each\nnight, but for the nondeployed parent it became yet another\nresponsibility. She felt she had to cope with the nightly ses-\nsions without complaint to attend to the needs of her spouse.\nDiscussion\nThis discussion focuses on the three areas of protective rela-\ntionships within the microsystem, exosystem, and macrosys-\ntem evident from the data.\nProtective Factors Provided by Relationships\n(Microsystem)\nProtective factors provided by personal relationships\nrevealed family cohesion, support, role flexibility, and\nawareness. Protective factors provided by professional rela-\ntionships demonstrated the parent's desire and high regard\nfor quality partnerships.\nPersonal relationships.Many families are able to show an\nincreased level of flexibility, with members taking on new\nresponsibilities and roles during deployment (Bowling &\nSherman, 2008). This flexibility was revealed in Family 1\nwhen Sam took on his father's household chores and helped\nhis sister get ready for day care. Sibling relationships often\npromote resilience in children as they learn to help others in\ntimes of need, and this behavior can become an ongoing part\nof their lives (Brooks, 2011). However, love and friendship\noften go hand in hand with fights and competition within\nsibling relationships (Burton, Westen, & Kowalski, 2012),\nand children in this study also demonstrated this tension.\nManigart, Lecoq, and Lo Bue (2015) identified a typical\nresponse of older siblings, where they feel they need to take\ncare of younger siblings to assist during deployment. Shep-\npard et al. (2010) listed \"flexible gender roles and comfort\nperforming multiple roles\" as useful in helping families cope\nwith the difficulties during deployment (p. 603). Children's\nemotional development begins in infancy (Gonzalez-Mena\n& Widmeyer Eyer, 1997) and is dependent on social support\n(Hayes, 2013). This social and emotional development\noccurs most commonly within parent and sibling relation-\nships, and therefore the manner in which these relationships\noperate can be protective, or conversely, potentially expose\nchildren to greater risks.\nSocial support across a range of levels is important to nur-\nture resilience in families (Burton et al., 2012). In military\nfamilies, as in all families, resilience is generally linked to a\nsupportive extended family (Lemmon & Chartrand, 2009).\nFurthermore, Linke (2007) stressed the importance of the\nnondeployed parent having access to emotional and physical\nsupport. When families are stretched, they are often working\nat their peak emotional and physical capacity, meaning that\neven small changes or disruptions can cause major upsets\n(Arthur, Beecher, Death, Dockett, & Farmer, 2008). While\none might argue that relocation could potentially trigger feel-\nings of overload, it does appear that the family assistance\nresulting from the relocation mitigated the stress to an extent.\nIn this study, all families relocated to be closer to the chil-\ndren's grandparents at some stage. It is clear that extended\nfamily, family friends, and educators can be a source of spe-\ncial relationships that operate as protective factors assisting\nthe development of resilient children as reported by Brooks\nWhite, de Burgh, Fear, and Iversen (2011) have argued that\nmultiple deployments increase the risks families experience.\nThis is most likely due to the repeated feelings of grief and\nloss (Gillies & Neimeyer, 2006) when families are still vul-\nnerable and are less able to be resilient. This was evident in\nFamily 1 who found the second deployment far more stress-\nful for a number of reasons. Chandra, Martin, Hawkins, and\nRichardson (2010) stressed the need for increased assistance\nfor families affected by multiple redeployments or longer\ndeployments. In contrast, Lowe,Adams, Browne, and Hinkle\nbetween the impact of single and multiple deployments on\nfamilies; however, McGuire et al. (2012) conceded that\nparents tend to be increasingly negative about the effects of\ndeployment on their children with multiple deployments.\nDeVoe and Ross (2012) described this as a common reaction\nof nondeployed parents who are dealing with the loss of their\npartner and the overwhelming \"financial, household, and\nparenting responsibilities\" (p. 186). Reinforcement is more\nreadily available for families when they live on or close to\nthe defense base (Brooks, 2011), which is particularly impor-\ntant for those without extended family nearby because access\nto parental support also affects the children. Flake et al.\n(2009) believed that parenting, resources, supports, and resil-\nience influence children's psychosocial functioning during\nthe deployment cycle.\nSims (2002) outlined characteristics of strong families,\nincluding spending time together, encouraging individual\ngrowth within a cohesive unit, communication without\nblame or prejudice, supporting each other physically and\nemotionally, working together to cope and caring for one\nanother. Walsh (2003) discussed the key processes in family\nresilience as the ability of a family to make sense of difficul-\nties along with adaptability, interconnectivity, attitude,\nshared problem solving, and healthy emotional expression.\nThese abilities are diminished when multiple and ongoing\nstressors overwhelm the family, increasing their susceptibil-\nity to further problems (Walsh, 2003). Within ADF families,\nconstant comings and goings of parents due to training epi-\nsodes can cause this type of ongoing, spasmodic family dis-\nruption and along with deployment, can increase family\nstress (Pincombe & Pincombe, 2010). The returned parent's\nneeds are heightened by anxiety about the reunion and rein-\ntegration. Many experience a sense of being no longer\nneeded, nor part of the family. Others fear rejection that may\nlead to more serious reintegration issues (Palmer, 2008). Seb,\nwithin Family 3, demonstrated some of these issues during\nintegration. An understanding and supportive spouse can\nhelp alleviate many of these issues, as evidenced in the data.\nProfessional relationships with educators and teachers.Belong-\ning, Being, Becoming, The Early Years Learning Frame-\nwork for Australia (EYLF; Department of Education,\nEmployment and Workplace Relations [DEEWR], 2009)\noutlines the importance of genuine partnerships between\nfamilies and educators to achieve the best learning outcomes\nfor children by valuing each other's knowledge and efforts\nand collaborating in decision making. Elliott (2014) recom-\nmended building this type of trusting relationship based on\nthe sociocultural assumptions those families' diverse cul-\ntures; experiences and family traditions are esteemed and\nappreciated. In this study, all families expressed their desire\nfor educator support, input, and suggested strategies.\nIn Family 2, Wendy had more difficulty building this type\nof relationship with Michael's first primary schoolteacher,\nand this affected the provision of additional school assis-\ntance. She believed that Michael's education suffered\nbecause of the difference of opinion about the need to access\nfunding to support his learning difficulties. The ecological\nframework positions the mesosystem in terms of relation-\nships between different players within the microsystems:\nThe greater the coherence between the players, the better the\noutcomes for Michael. This level of coherence and the rela-\ntions between the players are framed as the mesosystem\n(Bowes, Grace, & Hayes, 2012). Specifically, there was a\nchange over time (chronosystem) in the quality of the rela-\ntionships between Wendy and Michael's early childhood\neducator, then schoolteacher, with negative consequences for\nMichael.\nAndres and Moelker (2011) described the difficulties a\nnumber of children face during the reintegration stage of the\ndeployment cycle, due to their feeling separated and uncer-\ntain. Educators who have strong relationships with young\nchildren or are communicating with the family will be more\nlikely to identify times of need and may be able to provide\nextra time to support during this vulnerable stage. They\nneed to invest time to listen to the children and acknowledge\ntheir emotions, responding professionally and creating joint\nunderstandings (Nolan, Stagnitti, Taket, & Casey, 2014).\nLowe et al. (2012) stressed the importance of addressing\nissues during this period to promote the long-term stability\nof the whole family unit. Sharing insightful dialogues with\nan early childhood professional to assist with family com-\nmunication during this stressful reintegration period was\nvery comforting for Fiona from Family 1. This type of com-\nmunication with families is recognized as a crucial element\nin quality early childhood service delivery where educators\nand families reciprocate information in a respectful manner\nommended that educators become knowledgeable about\nways to support families' connection with the community\nand help engage the assistance they need. In addition, edu-\ncators can often be the link between families and support\nProtective Factors Within the Exosystem and\nMacrosystem\nWithin this theme, several substrands are discussed, including\nthe formal supports and various forms of communication.\nFormal supports (exosystem and macrosystem).Within the\nexosystem, the ADF culture can be quite encouraging in\nmany families during times of stress (Baber et al., 2015). In\naddition, Brooks (2011) stated that \"families cope best if\nthey accept the military lifestyle and see meaning in the sac-\nrifices they make\" (p. 496). In this study, Wendy from Fam-\nily 2 also stated that she wanted her son Michael to understand\nthis. Bowling and Sherman (2008) explained that creating a\nshared narrative can help bind families together and reduce\nstress. The content of these narratives demonstrates a high\nlevel of acculturation from the ADF and the wider commu-\nnity and Australian Government meta-narratives.\nAnumberofcharityorganizationsandAustralianGovernment\nDepartments assist military and veteran families. Similar experi-\nences to Wendy's are identified by Crompvoets (2012) who\nraised issues of outdated models being used to deal with current\nveterans and their families, thus creating issues in accessing\nappropriate and effective provision, revealing a need for reform.\nCommunication (macrosystem).Within research with FIFO\nfamilies, Meredith, Rush, and Robinson (2014) reported on\nthe impact social networking sites can have as an \"impor-\ntant mediating effect\" (p. 15). Other war widows sharing\ntheir experiences of ADF counseling via social media may\nhave influenced Wendy's decision not to use ADF counsel-\ning. Within the ADF, Siebler (2015) reported family mem-\nbers' experiences accessing the ADF's professional support\nstaff who struggled to effectively listen to their concerns,\nempathize and build relationships that are essential in\nengendering trust and usage of such services. His findings\nrecommended the use of digital communication technolo-\ngies and social media as an opportunity to build upon assis-\ntance for ADF families in online communities (Siebler,\nThe availability of being able to send ADF-funded care\npackages helped Family 1 and Family 3 feel connected.\nLinke (2007) stated that care packages provide excitement\nwhen they arrive for the children, whereas for the deployed\nparent it can be encouraging having something familiar from\nhome arriving at the base (Defence Community Organisation,\nAlong with letter writing, emails are thought to serve as a\nprotective factor for families during deployment (Palmer,\n2008). Families who made the effort to stay in touch were\neasing the way for the reintegration process because main-\ntaining contact and regular communication kept relation-\nships strong and fresh, potentially relieving feelings of\nloneliness and loss, and reducing stress. Family 1 also\ninvolved the children in this process, sharing artwork and\ncaptions. Such opportunities to share special moments, emo-\ntions, and reaffirm love and care also help maintain relation-\nships (Defence Community Organisation, 2014) highlighting\nthe importance of ADF-supplied communication technolo-\ngies for the deployed parent.\nBartone (2015) rationalized other defense force's exten-\nsive funding of video-conferencing communication services\nfor deployed forces to increase morale and mitigate stress.\nWithin Family 1, Fiona's frustrations of nightly SkypeTM ses-\nsions with Caleb reflect the increasingly crowded and stress-\nful family life associated with managing dual careers and\nfamily responsibilities described by Poole (2005). In defense\nfamilies, De Angelis and Segal (2015) described this con-\nflict, stating \"Military families, . . . exist at the intersection of\ntwo major social institutions that make great, often compet-\ning, demands on their time, energy and loyalty\" (p. 22). In\nline with the revelations from the data, military families are\nencompassed by a culture of service and sacrifice that\nfeatures heavily in the justification of the regime, legitimiz-\ning the gender inequities (Eran-Jona, 2015).\nLimitations of the Study\nWhile various themes have emerged during data analysis, the\nstudy represents only three families from defense forces in\nAustralia. While every effort was made to reduce researcher\nbias, the narrative methodology including interview ques-\ntions and interpretation of secondary data about the children\nwas open to my understandings. As a researcher, I am not\nfrom a military family. This may be beneficial, being able to\ndetect detailed nuances of the culture and the acculturation\nprocesses; however, Chandra and London (2013) indicated\nthat this may also limit the understanding of the defense\nculture.\nConclusion\nThis study acknowledges and identifies the stressors of hav-\ning a parent who works away, especially in defense families.\nDe Angelis and Segal (2015) described both the military and\nthe family itself as greedy institutions who have undergone\nenormous change over the past decades, increasing the con-\nflicting interests between them. Outdated models of deploy-\nment still place family responsibility onto the nondeploying\nspouse who is generally juggling their own career and family\nresponsibility (De Angelis & Segal, 2015) while often iso-\nlated from their extended family. Despite deployment being\ntaxing and testing for families (Siebler, 2015), a number of\nprotective factors were identified for the three families in this\nstudy. These protective factors came from the microsystem,\nincluding within the families themselves, in the extended\nfamily and friend network and from educators. Protective\nfactors were also identified within the exosystem through the\nADF provisions and community organizations and within\nthe macrosystem through Australian Government\nDepartments and social media. Communication tools and\ntechnology also provided a medium for many of these provi-\nsions. By utilizing these protective factors, the families were\nshowing varying degrees of resilience. All identified protec-\ntive factors were acknowledged as important to assist defense\nfamilies cope with the deployment cycle and even after the\ndeath of a family member. Although not all families utilized\nall available supports, it can be reassuring to know assistance\nis available (Baber et al., 2015). Importantly, these protective\nfactors form a vital buffer for the children and families dur-\ning the stresses of deployment cycle, therefore reducing risk\nfactors. The well-being of military children is important, and\nunderstanding which protective factors are valued and effec-\ntive may increase our capacity to support these potentially\nvulnerable families. These findings can inform the ADF:\npolicy makers, social workers, Regional Education Liaison\nOfficers (REDLOs), and others who support military fami-\nlies such as counselors and educators. Further research into\nthese protective factors is crucial; hence, assistance can be\ntargeted and effective for military children and families.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAllan, J.
