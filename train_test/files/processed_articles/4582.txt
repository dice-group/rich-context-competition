Clinical, blood and echocardiographic parameters were\nobtained at baseline and after 12 months, and before and after each levosimendan infusion.\nHospitalizations for heart failure and in-hospital length of stay in the 6 months before enrolment\nand after 6 and 12 months were recorded, along with 1-year mortality.\nResults: Twenty-five patients treated with levosimendan and 25 controls were studied. After each\nlevosimendan infusion, ventricular function and various clinical and metabolic parameters were\nimproved. After 12months, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) had improved compared with\nbaseline in the levosimendan group. The 1-year mortality rate was similar in both groups. During the\n6months before enrolment, hospitalizations were fewer in controls compared with the levosimendan\ngroup; after 6 and 12months they increased in controls and decreased in the levosimendan group.\nSeven patients were super-responders to levosimendan, with LVEF improving more than 20% and\nhospitalizations being reduced at 12months compared with the rest of the levosimendan group.\nConclusion: Intermittent levosimendan improved LVEF and decreased hospitalizations in\nadvanced heart failure and represents a therapeutic option for patients whose disease is\nworsening.\n",

Patients with arterial hypotension or\nsevere renal failure (estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate < 30 ml/min) were excluded,\nas treatment with levosimendan is not\nindicated in such patients.7\u00ad10 Patients\nwith similar clinical characteristics who,\ndespite being eligible, did not receive\nrepeated levosimendan infusions, either\nbecause they were not referred by their\nphysicians or because they refused the treat-\nment for personal or logistical reasons, were\nused as controls.\nEchocardiographic and blood parameters\nwere evaluated at baseline and after\n12 months; during this period all patients\nwere treated according to the ESC guide-\nlines.1 In addition, some patients from both\ngroups underwent intermittent outpatient\ninfusions of furosemide, and patients in the\nlevosimendan group followed an additional\nprogramme of levosimendan infusions,\nechocardiograms and blood tests.10\nAll patients provided written informed\nconsent. The study formed part of an insti-\ntutional clinical protocol10,12 approved by\nthe Ethical Committee of the Istituto\nAuxologico Italiano IRCCS (LEVOrep\nciples of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nLevosimendan treatment\nThe protocol for levosimendan infusion\nhas been described in detail elsewhere.10\nBriefly, levosimendan (Simdax\u00d5, Abbott\nLaboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) was\nadministered intravenously without an ini-\ntial loading dose, as a continuous infusion at\n0.1\u00ad0.2 mg/kg per min, to a total dose of\nThe number of infusions and the interval\nbetween them were set for each patient\naccording to their clinical condition. In line\nwith previous experience,8,9,11 a cycle of three\ninfusions at 28-day intervals was performed\nin all patients, with additional infusions being\ngiven if a patient showed clinical worsening\nat monthly follow-up visits.\nEchocardiographic assessment\nEchocardiographic examination, including\nDoppler and tissue Doppler imaging ana-\nlysis, was performed at baseline and at the\nend of the 12-month follow-up period in all\npatients. In addition, echocardiography was\nperformed in the levosimendan group within\n12 h before and within 12 h after each infu-\nsion of levosimendan,10,14 in accordance\nwith the recommendations of the American\nSociety of Echocardiography.15 At each\nechocardiographic examination, left ven-\ntricular ejection fraction (LVEF), estimated\nsystolic pulmonary artery pressure and left\nventricular end-diastolic volume were rec-\norded. Pulsed Doppler was used to assess\ntransmitral and pulmonary venous\nflow in the apical four-chamber view.\nTissue Doppler velocities were acquired\nat the septal and lateral annular sites.\nMitral inflow measurements included peak\nearly (E) and peak late (A) velocities,\nthe E/A ratio and the deceleration time of\nE velocity. Pulmonary venous flow meas-\nurements included peak systolic, diastolic,\natrial reversal velocities, systolic filling frac-\ntion and duration of atrial reversal. The\nearly diastolic (E0) velocity at the septal and\nlateral annular sites was measured using\ntissue Doppler, and the E/E0 ratio was\ncalculated using the mean of the septal and\nlateral E0 values. The severity of mitral\nregurgitation was graded semi-quantita-\ntively from minimal (grade 1) to severe\n(grade 4) using colour-flow Doppler images\nof the apical four-chamber view.\nAssessment of blood parameters\nBlood samples were taken to assess serum\ncreatinine (with the glomerular filtration\nrate being estimated using the Cockroft\u00ad\nGault formula), serum electrolytes, haemo-\nglobin and plasma B-type natriuretic\npeptide (BNP) levels (measured using the\nTriage BNP Test\u00d5, Biosite, San Diego, CA,\nUSA, according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions) at baseline and at the end of\nthe 12-month follow-up period in all\npatients. In addition, blood samples were\nobtained within 12 h before and within 12 h\nafter each infusion of levosimendan for the\nmeasurement of the same set of parameters\nin the levosimendan group.\nAssessment of outcomes\nThe primary endpoints considered were\nmortality at 12 months and hospitalizations\nfor heart failure in the 0\u00ad6 month period and\nthe 0\u00ad12 month period of follow up. Both\nthe total number of hospitalizations and the\nlength of stay in hospital were recorded;\nadmissions to the Emergency Department\nwere not included. The number of hospital-\nizations and in-hospital length of stay in the\n6 months before the baseline evaluation\nwere used for comparison. Changes in clin-\nical, blood and echocardiographic param-\neters over the same observation periods were\nused as secondary endpoints. All-cause mor-\ntality was assessed at 12 months after\nbaseline.\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical variables were expressed as the\nnumber of patients and percentages and\ncompared using the 2-test. Continuous\nvariables were expressed as the mean \u00c6 SD\nand compared using either the paired or\nunpaired Student's t-test. A P-value < 0.05\nwas considered to be statistically significant.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nOriginPro software version 7.0 (OriginLab,\nNorthampton, MA, USA).\nResults\nA total of 25 patients who had received\nrepeated levosimendan infusions were\nincluded in the study, along with 25 patients\nwith similar clinical characteristics who were\neligible for levosimendan treatment but did\nnot receive it because they were not referred\nby their physicians (n \u00bc 10) or because treat-\nment was refused for personal or logistical\nreasons (n \u00bc 15) as controls. Baseline patient\ncharacteristics are given in Table 1. No\nstatistically significant differences were\nobserved between the levosimendan and\ncontrol groups with regard to age, clinical\nhistory, heart failure aetiology, comorbid-\nities, NYHA class, renal function, haemo-\nglobin level, medical treatment or the\ncardiac and comorbid condition heart fail-\nA total of 16 patients received intermit-\ntent outpatient infusions of furosemide, six\nin the levosimendan group and 10 in the\ncontrol group.\nAcute effects of levosimendan\nThe mean infusion time for levosimendan\nperformed. Patients underwent a mean of\ninterval between infusions of 56 days\nbetween the baseline and last infusion of\neffects were observed apart from asymptom-\natic hypotension requiring a lower infusion\nrate, which occurred in nine patients.\nIn the patients receiving levosimendan,\nthere was a statistically significant improve-\nment from baseline in both systolic and\ndiastolic function after the first infusion\n(Table 2). There was also a reduction in\nBNP levels, a clear improvement in renal\nfunction, and a slight decrease in haemoglo-\nbin and potassium levels (Table 2). Similar\neffects were seen after each subsequent\nlevosimendan infusion (data not shown).\nFollow-up results\nAfter 12 months' follow-up, NYHA class\nhad remained stable in the levosimendan\nnificantly worsened in the control group\nline there were no differences between the\ntwo groups with regard to echocardio-\ngraphic data (Table 1). However, after\n12 months follow-up, there was a slight\npared with baseline in the levosimendan\ngroup and a worsening of estimated pul-\nmonary pressure (P \u00bc 0.02) in the control\ngroup (Table 3). In the levosimendan group,\nserum creatinine and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate worsened compared with\nbaseline values, but did not differ from the\nvalues observed in the control group\n(Table 3). In the 43 patients for whom data\nwere available, BNP levels did not change\nsignificantly in the levosimendan group\n(n \u00bc 23) but were higher at follow-up in the\nMortality and hospitalization\nAfter 12 months, mortality was similar in the\ntwo groups: two patients in the control\ngroup and three patients in the levosimen-\ndan group had died (mortality rates of 8%\nand 12%, respectively). In both groups the\nmortality rate was lower than that predicted\nby the baseline 3C-HF score (Table 1). In\nthe 6 months preceding the baseline analysis,\nthe number of hospitalizations and the in-\nhospital length of stay were lower in the\ncontrol group than in the levosimendan\n(Table 4).

In the present study,\nsimilar to previous studies,8\u00ad10 a trend\ntowards a better clinical state was observed\nat follow-up in patients treated with levosi-\nmendan: their NYHA class remained stable,\nwhile it worsened in the control group, and\nthere was a slight improvement in LVEF.\nLevels of BNP were not available in every\npatient; although they did not change in\npatients treated with levosimendan, they\nworsened over time in the control group.\nTaken together, despite the inherent weak-\nnesses of a retrospective analysis, these\nresults are coherent with the hypothesis\nthat levosimendan might slow the progres-\nIn the present study the mortality rate\nwas lower than that predicted by the base-\nline 3C-HF score, and therefore a similar\nsurvival rate in the two groups of patients\nwas not surprising. To date, a reduction in\nmortality with levosimendan treatment\nin chronic heart failure has been shown\nonly in meta-analyses17,18 and has not been\nconfirmed in randomized studies.19 In the\npresent study, the number of hospitaliza-\ntions and the length of stay in hospital were\nreduced in the levosimendan group\n6 months after the beginning of treatment,\nwhen patients were still undergoing repeated\ninfusions. After 12 months of follow-up,\nmost patients were no longer being treated\nwith regular infusions of the drug, which\nmay explain the trend towards relapse at\nthat time; however, both the number of\nhospitalizations and the length of stay in\nhospital were still lower than in the control\ngroup, which is in line with the results\nreported by Bartesaghi et al.20 who studied\nlevosimendan treatment in outpatients with\nend-stage chronic heart failure and who thus\nwere more seriously ill than the patients in\nthe present study. The initial higher number\nof hospitalizations and in-hospital length of\nstay in patients treated with levosimendan\ncompared with patients who did not\nundergo this treatment suggests the two\ngroups may be two different populations.\nHowever, levosimendan infusions were\noffered to the majority of control patients\n(some eligible patients were not referred by\ntheir attending physicians), and there were\nno significant differences in clinical charac-\nteristics between the two groups at baseline\n(Table 1). During the follow-up period, the\ntrends in the number of hospitalizations and\nin-hospital length of stay in the two groups\ndiverged and became reversed. It is worth\nnoting that many of the patients treated with\nlevosimendan would not have been eligible\nfor the drug after 6 months since they did\nnot require hospitalization during that time.\nIn a few patients, repeated infusions of\nlevosimendan was associated with an\nimprovement in LVEF, a long-lasting\ndecrease in BNP levels and a reduction in\nthe number and length of hospitalizations at\n6 and 12 months; these patients were termed\nsuper-responders. With respect to the other\npatients in the levosimendan group, the\nventricles of these younger patients might\nhave carried a lesser degree of fibrosis and a\ngreater amount of viable myocardium\nthat was more responsive to the calcium-\nsensitizing action of levosimendan.\nThe present study had a number of\nlimitations. First, it was a retrospective\nanalysis of data derived from the clinical\nregistry of single heart failure unit, so the\nnumber of patients to be studied could not\nbe defined in advance. Moreover, the con-\ntrol group was chosen on the basis of the\nmore relevant clinical characteristics rather\nthan treatment being randomized. Finally,\nthe number of levosimendan infusions was\nnot predetermined (as in the previous ran-\ndomized study10) but was event-driven by\nthe clinical protocol, which is used by a\nThe benefits of intermittent administra-\ntion of levosimendan in patients with\nadvanced chronic heart failure are still\noffers the perspective of a hospital-based\nheart failure unit in which this drug has\npreviously been tested in pilot randomized\nstudies.10,12 Despite the limitations of the\npresent study, the results suggest that inter-\nmittent levosimendan may represent an\noption for patients whose disease is rapidly\nworsening despite optimal treatment.\n"
