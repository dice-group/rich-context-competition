This article is published with open access at\nSpringerlink.com\nBACKGROUND\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate of any\nindustrialized country, with 1 in 100 American adults incar-\ncerated in 2008.1 Longer sentences and reductions in discre-\ntionary parole have led to an increased proportion of older\nwere aged 55 or older,4 and substantial increases in the\nnumber of older prisoners are expected.1\u00ad3,5 The vast majority\nof prisoners (97%) eventually return to the community,6\ntypically with no health insurance, limited employment pro-\nspects, and insufficient finances.7 Most prisoners are released\nwith a nominal amount of \"gate money\" (generally 50\u00ad100\ndollars) and a bus ticket, and half of state correctional\ndepartments provide only a 1\u00ad2 week supply of medication.7\nThose eligible for government benefits such as Medicaid,\nMedicare, and social security income must wait up to 3\nmonths for reinstatement.8\u00ad10 Older prisoners are far less\nlikely than younger prisoners to be reincarcerated after\nrelease.11,12 Compared to younger prisoners, older prisoners\nhave higher rates of chronic medical conditions and a higher\nrisk of post-release death,2,13,14 yet little is known about the\nhealth status of older prisoners awaiting release.\nOlder prisoners may also face challenges to successful\ncommunity reentry that compound health problems.17,18 Many\nnewly released prisoners confront difficulties with employment\nand housing,15 and up to half of the nation's homeless have a\nhistory of incarceration.15,16 Although the US homeless popula-\ntion has aged over the past several decades,19 and homelessness\nis associated with increased morbidity, mortality and acute\nhealth care utilization,20\u00ad25 the risk of post-release homelessness\namong older adults has not been evaluated. Such information\nwould be valuable since coordinated treatment programs can\nimprove health outcomes for homeless adults.22\nBecause veterans comprise about 10% of the prison popula-\ntion26 and one-third of the homeless population,27 the Depart-\nment for Veterans Affairs has spearheaded several nationwide\ninitiatives to help meet the health care and housing needs of\nveterans being released from prisons.28,29 However, services for\nnon-veteran released prisoners are poorly established and are\navailable only on a state-by-state basis.6,30 It is unclear if the\nreentry needs of non-veterans differ from those of veterans,\nraising the question of whether similar interventions should be\ntargeted to non-veterans. We assessed and compared the health\nstatus and risk of homelessness among older veteran and non-\nveteran prisoners who were within 2 years of release.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Sample\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study of 360 prisoners, aged 55\nor older, who were within 2 years of release from a US federal or\nstate prison using data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in\nState and Federal Correctional Facilities (SISFCF). The SISFCF\ntargets a nationally representative, random sample of US\nprisoners who participate in confidential interviews conducted\nby the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics\n(BJS).31 The self-report medical questions were developed by\nBJS from health questions in other national health surveys.32\nWe included prisoners within 2 years of release to characterize\nthe health status and risk of homelessness of older adults who\nwould soon reenter the community. Consistent with prior\nliterature, we defined \"older\" prisoners as those who were\n55 years to reflect the increased and premature burden of\nillness and disability occurring among prisoners in comparison\nprisoners from 39 federal prisons were randomly selected to\nparticipate in the 2004 SISFCF. The response rate was 89% for\ners, 37.0% were within 2 years of anticipated release, resulting\nin a final sample size of 360.\nMeasures\nHealth Status. Health status was based on self-report of 11\nchronic medical conditions and 3 categories of serious mental\nillnesses. The 11 medical conditions included current cancer or\nparalysis, and current or past diagnosis of hypertension, brain\ninjury or stroke, diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems,\narthritis, asthma, cirrhosis, or hepatitis. The three categories of\nserious mental illnesses included depressive disorders, bipolar\ndisorder, and schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. We\nreported post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately from\nserious mental illness to be consistent with prior literature.35,36\nThe SISFCF used brief questions to elicit medical histories (e.g.,\n\"Have you ever had high blood pressure or hypertension?\").\nSurvey participants who reported a history of cancer or paralysis\nwere asked if the condition was still present. To ascertain mental\nhealth status, participants were provided a list of psychiatric\ndisorders and asked if a mental health professional had ever told\nthem they had any of the conditions. To assess disability status,\nwe analyzed responses to four questions: (1) \"Do you use a cane,\nwheelchair, walker, hearing aid, or other aids to help you with\nyour daily activities?\" (2) \"Do you consider yourself to have a\ndisability?\" (3) \"Do you have difficulty hearing a normal\nconversations even when wearing a hearing aid?\" (4) \"Do you\nhave difficulty seeing ordinary newsprint, even when wearing\nglasses?\" Self-report of medical conditions and disability is well\nRisk of Homelessness. Risk of homelessness was primarily defined\nwith two measures: self-report of homelessness at the time of\narrest and/or having been homeless at any time in the 12 months\nprior to arrest. Respondents who answered they were living \"on the\nstreet or in a homeless shelter\" were categorized as homeless. We\nchose these criteria because a history of homelessness is a strong\npredictor of post-release homelessness.41 In order to better\ncharacterize the spectrum of homelessness beyond living on a\nstreet or in a shelter,42,43 we also examined a history of marginal\nhomelessness: those who reported living in a hotel, motel, or\nrooming house upon arrest. Because decreased social contacts\ncan confer added homelessness risk,44,45 we also identified those\nwho planned to live alone following release.\nVeteran Status. We determined veteran status based on the\nquestion: \"Did you ever serve in the US Armed Forces?\"\nRespondents were categorized according to their service era,\nself-reported combat status (\"During this time did you see\ncombat in a combat or line unit?\"), and discharge type\n(honorable/general with honorable conditions versus other\ndischarge type). However, in the main analyses, we compared\nall veterans, regardless of discharge type, to all non-veterans\nbecause even veterans with dishonorable discharges can\nsometimes become eligible for VA benefits.46,47\nOther Demographic Characteristics. We characterized\nparticipants according to their sociodemographic characteristics,\nincluding age, race/ethnicity, marital status, educational\nattainment (having a high school diploma or GED vs. not), and\npre-incarceration employment. We also characterized criminal\nhistory (age at first and current arrest, total arrests, and number\nof years currently incarcerated). We characterized substance\nabuse history using CAGE questionnaire data to assess alcohol\ndependence and the Texas Christian University Drug Screen\n(TCUDS), which was developed to assess drug dependence in the\ncorrectional setting.48 By convention, a CAGE alcohol dependency\nscore of 2 or a TCUDS score of 3 indicates a substance abuse\nStatistical Analyses\nWe examined the differences between veterans and non-veterans\naccording to sociodemographics, employment history, criminal\nhistory, health conditions (medical and psychiatric), and risk of\nhomelessness. All reported results were weighted to account for\nthe sampling design in order to obtain nationally representative\nresults.\nWilliams et al.: Health and Homelessness: Older Pre-release Prisoners\nJGIM\nThis study was approved by the Committee on Human\nResearch at University of California, San Francisco and the\nSan Francisco VA Medical Center, and was conducted using\npublicly available, de-identified data. All statistical analyses\nwere performed using STATA software version 10.1 (STATA\nCorporation, College Station, TX).\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of Older Prisoners Within 2 Years\nof Release\nwere employed before arrest. Of those who were employed,\n87.2% had full-time jobs. Participants had been incarcerated\nfor an average of 7.5 years and had an average of 3.1 prior\narrests (Table 1).\nCharacteristics According to Veteran Status\nOverall, 142 (39.8%) of the pre-release older prisoners were\nveterans. The veterans were more likely than non-veterans to\nbe men, married, and to have a high school diploma or GED\n(Table 1). Veterans were more likely to identify as white (76.7%\nor Latino/Hispanic (4.3% vs. 22.2%). Veteran status was not\nrelated to employment prior to arrest, monthly income less\nthan $1,000 in the month preceding arrest, number of prior\narrests, age at first or current arrest, or number of years\nincarcerated.\nThe majority of veterans served in the Vietnam-era (69.4%),\nbetween the Korea and Vietnam eras (14.1%), the Korean era\n(9.8%), or the Pre-Korean era (5.1%). Thirty-five percent of the\nveterans had served in active combat, and 77.2% had received\nan honorable or general (with honorable conditions) discharge.\nHealth Status of Older Prisoners\nNearly 80% of older pre-release prisoners reported one or more\nmedical conditions with an average of 2.1 (Table 2). The most\ncommon medical conditions included hypertension (51.8%),\narthritis (43.6%), and \"heart problems\" (34.1%). Additionally,\n30.7% of the older prisoners reported having a disability,\n13.6% reported at least one serious mental illness, and 8.1%\nreported a history of hospitalization in a mental health facility.\nA quarter had a TCUDS score of 3, suggestive of drug\ndependency, and nearly half (45.6%) had a positive CAGE\nscore for alcohol dependency.\nHealth Status According to Veteran Status\nVeterans and non-veterans reported a similar average number\nTable 1.

There was no statistically significant difference in PTSD\nbetween non-combat veterans and non-veterans (6.5% vs.\n2.3%, p=0.08). Although there was no relationship between\nveteran status and alcohol or drug dependency, not all\nrespondents answered all relevant items; 57.3% of subjects\nanswered all CAGE alcohol dependency questions and 47.1%\nanswered all TCU drug dependency questions.

These experiences were similar for veterans\nand non-veterans. Older veterans were not more likely than\nnon-veterans to expect to live alone after release (31.6% vs.\nDISCUSSION\nAs the American population ages, the number of incarcerated\nand homeless older adults is increasing rapidly.1\u00ad3,19 We found\nthat older veteran and non-veteran prisoners who were within\n2 years of release had a similar burden of medical and\npsychiatric conditions, and an equal number of risk factors\nfor homelessness.\nAppropriate targeting of community-based medical ser-\nvices to the growing number of newly released older prisoners\nis hampered by inadequate information about their health\nneeds.17 A survey of returning prisoners of all ages showed\nthat one-third of those with physical or mental health\nconditions used emergency room care and one-fifth were\nTable 2.

This exclusion is the result of an operational\ndefinition created to maintain consistency and comparability\nwith other studies and is not intended to imply that PTSD is\nnot a serious mental illness. There is a complex relationship\namong mental illness, homelessness, and incarceration, and\na heightened risk of both recidivism and homelessness\namong released prisoners with mental illness has been\nillness and an incarceration history have a higher likelihood\nof experiencing long-term homelessness than those without\nmental illness.54 These findings underscore the importance\nof providing linkages to community-based mental health\nservices for older released prisoners.\nBecause of the association between homelessness and\nincreased acute health care utilization and mortality,20\u00ad25\nhomelessness prevention strategies have received increasing\nattention.44 A history of incarceration is a risk factor for\noners of all ages use homeless shelters following release.41 At\nleast 8.4% of our sample was at risk for homelessness (based\non a prior history of homelessness) and more than a quarter\nexpected to live alone following release. These findings suggest\nthat expanded efforts to secure housing for pre-release older\nprisoners are warranted.\nAlthough pre-release health care and homelessness\nprevention planning for all older prisoners is needed, well-\nestablished and coordinated programs are typically available\nonly to veterans. In 2001, Congress mandated that the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs collaborate with the Depart-\nment of Labor and the Bureau of Prisons to assist veterans\nduring reentry.28 This collaboration culminated in the\nIncarcerated Veterans Transition Program in 2003, a demon-\nstration program providing incarcerated veterans with con-\nnections to housing, health care, training, and employment.56\nThe Healthcare for Reentry Veterans Program, implemented\nin 2007, has provided outreach and reentry services to over\nolder prisoners who were veterans reported military dis-\ncharges with conditions likely to make them eligible for VA\nservices. In addition, while veterans comprise about 10% of\nthe state prison population,26 nearly 40% of our sample of\nolder prisoners were veterans. This highlights the importance\nof the VA's outreach efforts for this segment of the incarcerated\npopulation.\nConversely, 60% of our sample of older prisoners were non-\nveterans, underscoring the importance of developing national\ntransition programs for non-veterans for whom existing\nservices are limited.58 While non-veterans on parole may\nreceive reentry assistance via a parole officer or formal parole\nprograms, such services are diminishing with increasing\nnon-parole releases and parole officer caseloads.58 Although\nthe Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative, established in\ndevelopment, the programs only focused on prisoners aged 35\nAlthough coordinated reentry programs for non-veteran\nolder prisoners are lacking, we found that rates of poor health\nstatus and risk of homelessness were just as high among this\ngroup as among veterans. Unfortunately, most states termi-\nnate Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security Disability\nIncome eligibility during incarceration,8\u00ad10 and reinstituting\ncoverage can take up to 3 months.8,9 Given the high costs of\nemergency department services and the high risk of home-\nlessness, all pre-release older prisoners should receive assis-\ntance with securing housing, medical care, and reinstatement\nof benefits, and should be screened for eligibility for VA\nservices.\nA strength of our study was that it included a random,\nnationally representative sample of US prisoners. Limitations\nincluded the use of self-reported data, although the majority\nof studies have found relatively strong agreement between\nself-report and medical record validation of major medical\nconditions in older adults.37\u00ad40 A validation of the medical\nquestions in the SISFCF did identify some underreporting of\nmedical conditions compared with administrative medical\ndata.32 Although we do not know the extent of underreport-\ning, the fact that Census Bureau employees conducted the\nsurvey and that no financial incentive was offered for\nparticipation likely minimized any incentives to provide\ninaccurate information. Additionally, underreporting of med-\nical conditions would strengthen our finding that pre-release\nolder adults have more medical conditions than nonincar-\ncerated older adults. Also, it is possible that some veterans in\nour sample failed to self-identify, while other respondents\nfalsely identified themselves as veterans. Given that we found\nfew differences between the two groups, this possibility is\nunlikely to have affected our findings. Finally, because this\nstudy was cross-sectional, we were unable to determine how\nmany respondents actually experienced homelessness after\nreentry. Prospective studies are needed to assess rates of\nhomelessness, medical decompensation, and mortality\namong older released prisoners.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study describing the\nhealth status and homelessness risk for older pre-release\nprisoners. We found that such prisoners had high rates of\nmedical conditions, serious mental illness, and risk of post-\nrelease homelessness, regardless of veteran status. While\nnational reentry planning programs for veterans are expand-\ning, the overwhelming similarity in poor health status and\nhomelessness risk between older veterans and non-veterans\nsuggests that programs of equal breadth and caliber are\nneeded for non-veteran older prisoners.\n1042 Williams et al.: Health and Homelessness: Older Pre-release Prisoners JGIM\n"
