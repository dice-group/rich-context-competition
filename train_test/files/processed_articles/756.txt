Objective: To describe the incidence and\npatient characteristics of traumatic brain injuries\n(TBIs) treated in U.S. emergency departments (EDs).\nMethods: A secondary analysis was performed on\ndata from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical\nvisit was determined to represent a case of TBI if the\nerage annual estimate of new TBI treated in U.S.\nmately 3,136 new cases of TBI per day and accounts\nfor 1.3% of all ED visits. Males were 1.6 times as\nlikely as females to suffer TBI until the age of 65\nyears, when the female rate exceeded the male.

Key\nwords: traumatic brain injury; incidence; emergency\nTRAUMATIC brain injury (TBI) is a signifi-\ncant source of morbidity and mortality in the\nUnited States, accounting for approximately one-\nthird of injury-related deaths.1 The magnitude of\nTBI mandates a thorough understanding of the ep-\nidemiology of these injuries, in order to elucidate\nrisk factors for TBI and design appropriately tar-\ngeted prevention programs.\nData on TBI-related mortality are readily avail-\nable.2 Estimates of the incidence of nonfatal TBI\nhave been reported through population surveys,\nmedical record reviews, and hospital and trauma\nregistries.

The principal outcome measure was a report\nof head injury resulting in a loss of consciousness\nwithin the previous 12 months. Their results re-\nvealed an annual brain-injury rate of 618 per\nical care, 14% were treated on an outpatient basis,\n35% were treated and released from EDs, and 25%\nwere admitted to a hospital.

The purpose of the current study, therefore,\nis to quantify the incidence and describe the char-\nacteristics of patients who experience TBI and are\nseen in EDs using a national database.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design. We conducted a secondary anal-\ntional Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey\n(NHAMCS). The original intent of the NHAMCS\nwas to provide national estimates of the care pro-\nvided in hospital EDs and outpatient departments.\nOur goal was to describe the incidence, demo-\ngraphics, and characteristics of patients diagnosed\nas having TBI who present to U.S. EDs. The study\nwas approved by the Institutional Review Board of\nAllegheny University of the Health Sciences.\nData Source. As detailed elsewhere,8\u00ad11 the\nNHAMCS is a national probability survey of visits\nto emergency and outpatient departments of non-\ninstitutional, general and short-stay hospitals (ex-\ncluding federal, military, and Veterans Affairs hos-\npitals) located within the 50 states (and the\nDistrict of Columbia). The NHAMCS is adminis-\ntered by the Division of Health Care Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nIt uses a four-stage probability design that in-\ncludes geographic primary sampling units (PSUs),\nhospitals within PSUs, EDs within hospitals, and\npatients within EDs. The first-stage sample con-\nsisted of 112 PSUs comprising a probability sub-\nsample of the 1,900 geographically defined PSUs\nical Care Survey (NAMCS). The PSUs used in the\nNHAMCS were then selected with a probability\nproportional to their size. The intent of this com-\nplex sampling design was to establish the gener-\nated data as representative of the U.S. population.\nIn the recruitment and orientation phase of the\nsurvey, the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) employed experienced interviewers spe-\ncially prepared for recruiting hospitals and train-\ning hospital personnel in survey-specific data col-\nlection procedures. Data collection occurred over a\nrandomly assigned four-week period for each hos-\npital and was the responsibility of the hospital\nstaff. A separate data collection form was filled out\nat or near the time of the visit. A total of 91,935\ncompleted, the forms were sent to the NCHS,\nwhere ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and E-codes (ex-\nternal cause) were assigned using the data collec-\ntion form--not the original medical record. Coding\nfrom the data collection forms was done centrally\nby experienced NCHS nosologists. Quality assur-\nance procedures included a 10% sample of inde-\npendently processed survey records to ascertain\ncoding quality. Coding error rates are reported in\nthe NHAMCS as no more than 2% for the different\nsents approximately 274 million ED visits (close to\n91 million visits per year). Each visit was assigned\na statistical weight in order to generate annual na-\ntional estimates for the three-year period.\nDefinition and Case Selection. In accordance\nwith the CDC surveillance guidelines for TBI,13 an\nED visit was classified as a case of TBI if it con-\ntained one of the following ICD-9-CM codes within\nthe primary, secondary, or tertiary diagnosis fields:\n``intracranial injury, including concussion, contu-\nsion, laceration, and hemorrhage.'' More than 92%\nof the cases were identified from the primary di-\nagnosis field. Although ``injury, first visit'' and ``in-\njury, follow-up'' data items were included in the\n1992 data collection forms, these variables were\nGiven that only 4.5% of ED visits for TBI were\nlisted as ``injury, follow-up'' visits in the 1992 data\nset, it was not deemed necessary to adjust data\nfrom subsequent years to avoid double counting of\nfollow-up visits to determine incidence. Out-of-hos-\npital deaths and injuries treated in non-ED out-\npatient settings were excluded from this data set.\nEstimates of payments for TBI-related ED visits\nwere determined using a payment model based\non the average reimbursement of a non-NCHS/\nNHAMCS sample of actual ED visits for the same\nICD-9- coded injuries. This model did not include\nfollow-up visits, inpatient care, or non-ED-related\ncharges.\nData Analysis. Data were obtained from the\nNCHS on diskette in ASCII format and analyzed\nusing SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In-\nformation from all three years was combined and\naveraged to provide mean annual estimates of na-\ntional ED visits. The entire database was searched\nwhich met the case definition. Rates were calcu-\nlated using mid-year 1993 population figures from\nthe U.S. Census Bureau. Confidence intervals\nwere calculated using approximate relative stan-\ndard errors as percentages (based on recommen-\n136 TBI Jager et al. \u00b7 TBI EVALUATED IN U.S. EDs\nTABLE 1.

More than half of the TBIs sustained\nat a home were in the 0\u00ad9-year age group, and\nrepresented 62% of head injuries within this group.\nMost TBI cases (93%) were assigned a ``cause of\ninjury'' designation. Falls represented the most\ncommon cause of injury (39%), followed by motor\nvehicle-related trauma (23%) and the category\n``struck by or against'' (23%). Pedestrian and bicy-\ncle-related injuries accounted for 6.2% of all inju-\nries, and three-fourths of these (77%) occurred in\nthe 0\u00ad14-year age group. The ``other'' category rep-\nresented 8.7% of injuries. Assault-related injuries\n(8.9% of the total) were contained in both the\n``struck by and against'' category and the ``other''\ngrouping. These findings are summarized in Fig-\nure 2. Examination by specific age groups reveals\nthat falls constituted the most common mechanism\nof head injury in children less than 9 years of age\n(50% of all falls) and in those aged more than 50\nyears.

The total dollar estimate for\nannual TBI-related ED charges was $346 million.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study reveals that every year, 444 of every\nMales and blacks were found to have higher over-\nall rates of TBI. Rates of TBI were highest among\nthe very young and elders; and a smaller peak was\npresent within the 15\u00ad24-year age group. Falls\nrepresented a larger proportion of TBI than has\nbeen seen in other studies. The majority of these\noccurred in younger children and elders. The sub-\ngroup of women older than 85 years represents the\nhighest rate of TBI, the majority of which were due\nto falls (71%). Motor vehicle-related trauma ac-\ncounted for 23% of TBI and, although present in\nall age groups, was most common in men between\nThe current study supports several of the con-\nclusions reached by Sosin et al. in the NHIS.7 A\ncomparison of the two also helps put our data in\nperspective. The estimate of 1.14 million annual\ncases of TBI with a corresponding rate of 444 per\nhigher than that extrapolated from rates deter-\nmined by Sosin et al. Rates of TBI by sex were\ncomparable. The male rate was 3.8% lower in our\nfered more by race; the rate for whites was 8%\nlower and that for blacks was 23% higher in the\npresent study. The estimated hospital admission\nsions and transfers) is significantly lower than that\nis closer to rates found in the five-state survey\nnoted.4 Sosin et al. found assaults to represent 9%\nof total TBI cases in the NHIS study, similar to our\nstudy. Several explanations for the discrepancies\nfound between these two studies exist, including\nsomewhat different case definitions, the potential\nfor recall bias when using telephone survey meth-\nods, and the potential imprecision of using ICD-9\ncodes to quantify TBI. Nevertheless, the majority\nof findings of these two population-based ED stud-\nies were similar, thereby strengthening our under-\nstanding of the epidemiology of TBI.\nThe injury pyramid provides a model whereby\nthe burden of an injury on a population may be\nevaluated at different levels of medical treatment.\nThe height represents increasing injury severity\nand the width corresponds to the total number of\ncases in each level. Waxweiler and associates de-\nscribe an injury pyramid for TBI in which the tip\nrepresents mortality (before and after hospital ad-\nmission), the mid-portion contains cases for which\nmedical care was sought (including hospital ad-\nmissions), and the base corresponds to those per-\nsons suffering disability from TBI without consult-\ning a physician.4 Sosin et al. amend this concept\nby noting that the NHIS revealed that more per-\nsons suffering head injuries sought medical atten-\ntion than did not.7 Whether or not the burden of\nTBI is pyramidal, the visual concept is useful in\ndescribing the medical care provided to those suf-\nfering the injury. Our study serves to further de-\nfine the mid-portion of this injury construct, de-\nscribing those who seek medical care in EDs\nfollowing TBI. Using Waxweiler et al.'s estimate\npatients suffering TBI who are either hospitalized\nity there are roughly 5 hospitalizations and 18 ED\nvisits. This does not include those patients either\nseen in outpatient clinics or not medically evalu-\nated for their injuries.\nNational costs for head injury have been esti-\nmated to be $54 billion annually in the United\nStates.14 The average estimated annual cost of\nits is small in comparison, but it represents only\nthe initial charge for those hospitalized, and the\nfirst payment for those who continue to require\noutpatient services.\nOne of the problems found in TBI case ascertain-\nment is the fact that case definitions may lead to\nthe inclusion of those suffering only injury to the\nskull (i.e., skull fracture) without intracranial or\nneurologic damage. Likewise, if objective evidence\nof TBI is not present, the diagnosis of TBI rests on\nclinical judgment, which may vary by practitioner\nand by patient report. The lower limit of TBI is\nthus not clearly delineated by most case-finding\ndefinitions. Following an impact to the head, one\nmay simply experience a brief episode of disorien-\ntation or not be able to recall the specific details of\nthe incident to the clinician's satisfaction, in order\nto be viewed as one of the ``traumatic brain-in-\njured.'' The 1995 CDC case definition of TBI is sus-\nceptible to the above concerns, and may not prove\nto be representative of actual cases of TBI when it\nis applied to an ED population of head-injured pa-\ntients. In the present study more than half of the\ncases were coded as ``intracranial injury of other or\nunspecified nature.'' Examples of these cases might\ninclude those with a clinical diagnosis of ``mild\nclosed head injury'' or ``head injury--possible con-\ncussion,'' and it is unfortunate that limited diag-\nnostic and prognostic information may be gleaned\nfrom this classification. Patients who are hospital-\nized following head injury frequently receive more\nspecific diagnoses, and may be more appropriately\nrepresented by the CDC case definition.\nSeveral other limitations of the present study\ndeserve mention. Underascertainment of cases\nwas possible since a multiply injured patient may\nnot receive an initial ED diagnosis consistent with\nTBI. The random hospital sampling design was not\nstructured to account for the location of trauma\ncenters, and this may have led to biased ascertain-\nment. The ED NHAMCS data set did not provide\nthe more precise and complete ICD-9-CM diagno-\nses typical of hospital discharge data, and this pre-\ncluded accurate assignation of severity scores. The\ndata set provides no estimate of out-of-hospital\ndeaths, which are believed to account for up to 65%\nof all TBIs, and thus does not quantify the most\nsevere injuries. Brain injuries sustained by fire-\narms are not described in the NHAMCS data sub-\nset representing TBI due to their relatively rare\noccurrence and the sample size of the survey, al-\nthough selection bias cannot be ruled out. Finally,\nthe database does not include fields pertaining to\nrestraints or other protective devices, and thus no\nmention of their utility may be made.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the majority of\nall TBI cases in the current study were of mild\nseverity, given that 80% of the patients were dis-\ncharged directly from the ED. The long-term se-\nquelae of mild TBI have not been adequately char-\nacterized in the literature and are worthy of\nfurther study. Evidence from other studies sug-\ngests that a clinically significant number of pa-\ntients with mild TBI (up to 40%) remain impaired\nfrom both a neuropsychological and an occupa-\ntional standpoint up to at least one year post in-\njury.15,16 In addition to examining the long-term\nsequelae of mild TBI, future research should de-\ntermine the effectiveness of preventive interven-\ntions for TBI, examine the influences of managed\ncare and health care financing on the treatment of\nTBI, and evaluate the impact of new therapeutic\nmodalities for those who have sustained TBI.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTraumatic injuries to the brain are commonplace\nand their potential to cause prolonged impairment\nis a source of concern for health care providers, the\ninjured, their family members, and the community\nat large. This study corroborates prior research de-\nfining the incidence of ED-treated TBI. While mo-\ntor vehicle-related trauma represents the most im-\nportant cause of fatal and severe TBI, other injury\nmechanisms such as falls represent a significant\nsource of potential TBI-related disability. Young\nchildren and the elders were found to be at signif-\nicantly increased risk for ED-treated TBI, suggest-\ning the need to target these high-risk subgroups in\nthe population with prevention programs.\nReferences\n1.
