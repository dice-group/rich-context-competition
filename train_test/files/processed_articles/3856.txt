We performed a technical replication of the\noriginal study, correcting four deficiencies, which led us to a different conclusion. First, we discuss substantive significance\nin addition to statistical significance. Second, we ran significance tests on all comparisons instead of limiting them to an\narbitrary subset. Third, we performed pairwise comparisons between the three types of members instead of using\npooled groups. Fourth, we avoided the inflation of the type-I error rate due to multiple testing by using the Bonferroni\u00ad\nHolm correction. We found that most of the differences between the types lacked substantive significance, and that\nstatistical significance only coherently distinguished the types of members in their future membership, but not in their\npresent behaviour and attitudes.\n",

The questionnaire comprised 13\ntopics covering multiple items that asked about the respond-\nent's socio-economic characteristics and their perceptions,\npreferences, behaviour and expected future involvement in\nand Harrison first hypothesized that young party members\ncould be primarily designated as being either morally,\nsocially or professionally minded. Morally oriented mem-\nbers serve a moral duty by getting engaged in a party; pro-\nfessionally oriented members are focused on office and\nthink and behave like political leaders; socially oriented\nmembers use their party as a source of social interaction\nan exploratory factor analysis confirmed the hypothesis\nBuilding on this finding, Bruter and Harrison (2009)\ntested four hypotheses on how the three member types dif-\nfer in terms of i) membership objectives, ii) levels and\nforms of activism, iii) efficacy and democratic perceptions,\nand iv) self-perceived political future and membership in\nthe party.1 Each of the four hypotheses is a compound or\nNot so different in present attitudes\nand behaviour, but expected future\nmembership: A technical replication of\na study of party youth in six European\ndemocracies\nLion Behrens1 and Ingo Rohlfing2\n Keywords\nMultiple testing, party members, party youth, significance testing, type-I error\nFaculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Utrecht University, The\nNetherlands\nCologne Center for Comparative Politics, Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln,\nGermany\nCorresponding author:\nIngo Rohlfing, Cologne Center for Comparative Politics, Universit\u00e4t zu\nK\u00f6ln, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, K\u00f6ln, 50931, Germany.\nEmail: i.rohlfing@uni-koeln.de\nResearch Note\n2 Research and Politics \ncomposite hypothesis covering two to six theoretical expec-\ntations, yielding 19 expectations in total (Bruter and\nappendix). We have reproduced the hypothesis on member\nattitudes as an example of a composite hypothesis. The\nnumbers in brackets highlight the individual expectations:\nProfessional-minded members are the most efficacious [1], the\nmost positive about the party's organization [2], and the most\nlikely to think of politics as a profession [3]. Social-minded\nmembers are the most critical [4] and least efficacious [5];\nmoral-minded members are least likely to think of politics as a\nEach individual expectation was tested by running an\n`ANOVA test of difference' between the mean responses\nof party members belonging to different groups (Bruter\nwith one item, while others were linked to up to six items\n(see Tables A.3\u00adA.6 in the online appendix). For example,\nthe expectation that socially minded members are most\ncritical means that this member type would show the low-\nest mean response across six items measuring different\nattitudes towards their own party (Bruter and Harrison,\nresults confirmed the hypotheses, and stated that `Each\ntype of young party member is characterized by different\npatterns of perceptions, attitudes, activities, preferences,\nand hopes and expectations about their own future' (Bruter\nIn this paper, we point to four deficiencies in the original\nempirical analysis and remedy them in a technical replica-\ntion. Our results qualify the original conclusion. Young party\nmembers only show statistically significant differences in\ntheir long-run expectations and display an incoherent picture\nwhen it comes to present perceptions, attitudes and activities.\nWe further show that most differences in mean responses are\nmarginal and lack substantive significance.\nFour problems with the analysis\nWe admire the effort that Bruter and Harrison put into col-\nlecting the data to answer a relevant research question.\nHowever, we argue that the analysis suffers from four prob-\nlems. The shortcomings we have corrected are, first, a\nneglect of substantive significance. Since the number of\nobservations \u00ad about 3000 \u00ad is large, it is particularly\nimportant to consider substantive significance because sta-\ntistical significance should not be difficult to achieve.\nSecond, some comparisons of means were excluded from\nsignificance testing for no obvious reason. For the 22 items\nthat we reanalyse below, the original analysis contains sig-\nnificance tests for only 11 of them.\nThird, the test of differences between the three types of\nyoung members assessed whether one group `differ[s] ...\nsignificantly from the rest of the sample' (Bruter and\nto the pooled mean response of the two other groups is\ninconsistent with the valuable idea of distinguishing three\ngroups of young members. A test of one group against the\npooled mean response of the other two groups does not\nallow one to say that the three groups differ from each\nother, because this is not what is being tested. One can eas-\nily conceive of constellations in which a test of one group\nagainst two pooled groups masks interesting findings. It is\npossible that one group differs from the pooled group, but\nnot from one or even both groups if we run separate signifi-\ncance tests. Similarly, one group of young members might\nnot differ from a pooled sample, but differ from one or both\nof the other two groups in pairwise comparisons.2\nThe fourth problem is significance testing without taking\ninto account that multiple comparisons inflate the probability\nsons require controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER)\nby using an appropriate error correction technique. In the\noriginal study, multiple testing was an issue because 12 tests\nrelated to both the objectives of young members and the\nexpected future involvement in the party; 21 tests were tied to\nboth activism and democratic perceptions.3 Figure 1 shows\nhow the FWER depends on the number of tests. The uncor-\ntests, demonstrating that the original analysis ran a consider-\nably increased risk of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of\nno significant mean differences.\nA technical replication and its results\nWe performed a technical replication that remedied the four\ndeficiencies of the original analysis. Since the original data\nis lost (see Note 2), we had to rely on the summary statistics\nreported in the article \u00ad mean, standard deviation and num-\nber of responses per type \u00ad to replicate the analysis of the\nFigure 1. Family-wise error rate conditional on number of\ntests.\nBehrens and Rohlfing 3\nfour hypotheses. First, our replication ran analyses on all 22\nitems instead of a subset of them. Second, we aligned\ndesign and theory by comparing one group of young mem-\nbers with another group instead of a pooled sample, yield-\ning 66 tests in total because we had to perform three\npairwise comparisons per item.4 Third, for each hypothesis\nwe established a FWER of 0.05 by using the Bonferroni\u00ad\nHolm (1979) error correction, which is widely applied and\nhas more power than the Bonferroni correction (Abdi,\n2010). Fourth, we discuss the substantive significance of\nthe findings and how large the mean differences were.\nWe re-evaluated the hypotheses by cross-tabulating the\naggregate results of the significance tests with and without\nerror correction.5 Table 1 aggregates the results across all\nhypotheses. Table 2 summarizes the results separately for\neach hypothesis.\nTwenty-one tests out of 66 did not allow us to reject\nthe null of no mean difference without error correction.\nThis number increased to 32 when we controlled for mul-\ntiple testing, and means we failed to reject the null\nhypothesis almost as many times as we rejected it. The\naggregate perspective showed that the three types of\nyoung members can hardly be considered to `have their\nare some differences between young party members, but\nonly half of their story is unique while the other half of\nthe story is shared.\nThis conclusion was supported by a disaggregated\nanalysis because none of the four hypotheses was fully\nconfirmed. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of no\nmean difference in the majority of tests for three hypoth-\neses: seven out of 12 for party objectives, 13 out of 21 for\nparty activism and 10 out of 21 for democratic percep-\ntions. The only dimension for which we could reject\nthe null hypothesis most of the time concerned expected\nfuture involvement, displaying 10 significant compari-\nsons out of 12. This dimension was also the only one for\nwhich error correction did not affect the results.\nWhen we further disaggregated the perspective and looked\nat individual comparisons between groups (TablesA.3\u00adA.6 in\nthe online appendix), we found that less than one-third of all\ncomparisons allowed us to reject the null hypothesis for both\npairwise comparisons implied by a specific expectation in a\nsignificant and the second one not, and 10 items failed to\nreject the null hypothesis for both comparisons.\nIn the last step of our reanalysis, we focused on the sub-\nstantive significance of the mean differences. This is based\non the premise that an assessment of statistical and substan-\ntive significance should go hand in hand. Figure 2 plots the\nTable 1.

On a five-point\nscale, we considered differences of less than 10% of the\nscale to be of little significance (equivalent to 0.5 points).7\nOf all 66 comparisons, only 5% involved a difference in\nmeans of 0.5 or more. Even if we reduce the definition of\npoints), only 25% of all comparisons reach this threshold.\nMost of the mean comparisons therefore lacked substantive\nsignificance.8\nConclusion\nWe identified four deficiencies in the statistical analysis of\nan original survey of young party members and corrected\nthem in a technical replication. In contrast to the original\nconclusion that `Each type of young party member is ...\nsuggests that the picture is much more nuanced. We argue\nthat young party members do not display relevant differ-\nences in their membership objectives, levels of activism or\ndemocratic perceptions, because half of the comparisons\nwere not significant and most of them lacked substantive\nsignificance. The only statistically significant mean differ-\nences we found related to the party members' self-per-\nceived political future. Most of these differences, however,\nalso displayed low substantive significance.\nThe replication results provide crucial insights into\n`who exactly young party members are, what they seek,\nand how they perceive their involvement and future role'\nthat the differences in future aspirations are not strongly\ngrounded in present differences in young party members'\nattitudes and behaviour. Given that professionally\nminded, socially minded and morally minded members\ndo not differ coherently in their current opinions and\nbehaviour, it is puzzling that they believe their future\nengagement in the party and politics more generally will\nbe different. We cannot explore the reasons for this dis-\ncrepancy, but consider this an insight worth exploring in\nfollow-up research on the party youth.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFigure 2.
