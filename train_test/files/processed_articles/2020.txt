Dowling1\nBackground\nI-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is one of the most studied\npolymorphisms in relation to blood pressure and essential\nhypertension in humans.The evidence to date, however, on an\nassociation of this variant with blood pressure-related outcomes\nhas been inconclusive.\nMethods\nWe examined 5,561 participants of theThird National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a population-based and\nnationally representative survey of the United States, who were\n20 years of age and who self-identified as non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, or Mexican American.Within each race/ethnicity, we\nassessed genetic associations of the I/D variant with systolic blood\npressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hypertension, as\nwell as genotype\u00adsex interactions, in four genetic models (additive,\ndominant, recessive, and codominant).\nResults\nThe frequency of the I/D variant differed significantly by race/\nethnicity (P = 0.001). Among non-Hispanic blacks, the D allele was\nsignificantly associated (P < 0.05) with increased SBP in additive\nand dominant covariate-adjusted models and was also associated\nwith increased DBP in dominant models when participants\ntaking ACE inhibitors were excluded from the analyses. No other\nsignificant associations were observed in any race/ethnic group.\nSignificant genotype\u00adsex interactions were detected among\nMexican Americans, for whom positive associations with SBP and\nhypertension were seen among females, but not males.\nConclusions\nThis study gives limited support for association of the ACE I/D variant\nwith blood pressure and for sex-specific effects among particular\nrace/ethnic groups, though we cannot rule out the role of genetic or\nenvironmental interactions.\nKeywords:ACE;bloodpressure;cross-sectionalstudies;genetic\nsusceptibility;hypertension;NationalHealthandNutritionExamination\nSurvey;polymorphism\nAmericanJournalofHypertension, advance online publication 13 October 2010;\noriginal contributions Hypertension, BP, and ACE I/D Variant in NHANES\n\nconsistently show linkage across studies to blood pressure\nor \nhypertension.10 Hundreds of candidate gene association\n\nstudies have also been performed, though meta-analyses have\nfound little evidence for an association between the I/D vari-\nant and either outcome using data largely from white popula-\ntions in Europe and the United States.4,5 However, a significant\nassociation between the I/D variant and hypertension was\nfound among Han Chinese through recent meta-analysis.11\nInterestingly, data from genome-wide association studies\ndo not seem to support a role in blood pressure variation or\nhypertension for regions in or near the ACE gene,10,12 though\nmany studies may have been hampered by inadequate marker\ncoverage of this locus.10,13 Therefore, there continues to be\nuncertainty regarding association between the I/D variant and\nblood pressure or susceptibility to hypertension. There are also\nreports of gender-specific effects of the ACE gene on blood\npressure or hypertension in mice and humans,10 with signifi-\ncant associations of the DD genotype reported either only in\nIn light of this evidence, we studied the ACE I/D variant in\na large population-based and nationally representative sample\nof adults in the United States. We assessed the association of\nthe I/D variant with blood pressure and with hypertension and\nalso examined gene\u00adsex interactions in each of the three major\nrace/ethnic groups in the United States.\nMethods\nStudy population. The Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) is a population-based and\nnationally representative survey of the civilian, noninstitution-\nalized population of the United States aged 2 months or older\non a multistage, complex survey design and included four\nself-identified race/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white, non-\n\nHispanic black, Mexican American, and \"other.\" A DNA bank\nwas created that contains specimens from 7,159 participants\naged 12 years or older that were collected from phase 2 of the\nincluded in the DNA bank have been described.18\nCurrent analyses were limited to DNA samples of partici-\n(n = 111) and persons in the \"other\" race/ethnic group\npanic blacks, and 1,633 Mexican Americans. This study was\napproved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics at CDC.\nGenotyping and quality control methods. The ACE I/D poly-\nmorphism was genotyped by capillary fragment analysis18\nby laboratory staff who were blinded to the phenotypic data\nof the study participants. The variant passed quality control\ncriteria as defined by National Center for Health Statistics17\nand genotype frequencies did not significantly deviate from\nHardy\u00adWeinberg proportions (at P value 0.01) in any of the\nthree race/ethnic groups.18\nMeasurements and definitions. Blood pressure was measured\nat the household interview by a trained interviewer and at\nthe Medical Examination Center by the examining physician\n(a maximum of three measurements at each location). Up to\nsix measurements were obtained, each separated by 5min\nof rest, with the participant in the sitting position using a\nstandard mercury sphygmomanometer. The arithmetic mean\nof these measurements was used to determine the aver-\nage systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the average diastolic\nblood pressure (DBP) for each participant.19 Hypertension\nwas defined as SBP 140mm Hg, DBP 90mm Hg, or if the\nparticipant was currently taking prescribed medicine for\nhypertension.\nSeveral additional variables were used to characterize study\nparticipants and were included in multivariable-adjusted anal-\nmass index was classified into four categories (<18.5, 18.5\u00ad\nby self-report or by the presence of hemoglobin A1c\nlevels\n6.5%.20 Current use of glucose-lowering medication was cap-\ntured by participants who answered \"yes\" to the self-report\nquestion. Fasting plasma glucose was not included in the dia-\nbetes definition since this measurement was not available for\nall participants. Women with only a history of gestational dia-\nbetes were not considered diabetic. Other reported variables\ninclude educational attainment and smoking status (as catego-\nrized in Table 1).\nStatistical analysis. All analyses were performed using SAS-\nCallable SUDAAN 10 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC) and SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)\nto account for the NHANES III complex sampling design.\nNationally representative estimates were calculated using\nsample weights for the NHANES III DNA bank as previously\ndescribed.18 Standard errors and confidence intervals were cal-\nculated using the Taylor series linearization approach21,22 to\ncorrect for correlations within sampled clusters, including the\npossible genetic relatedness of persons sampled from the same\nhousehold.\nGenotype frequencies were calculated as previously\ndescribed.18 Genetic associations were assessed separately\nin each race/ethnic group in crude and adjusted linear\nregression models (for SBP and DBP) and logistic regres-\nsion models (for hypertension). Analyses were performed\nby examining four possible modes of inheritance: additive\n(per D allele), dominant ((DD+ID) vs. II), recessive (DD\nvs. (ID+II)), and codominant (DD vs. ID vs. II). Age-sex\nadjusted and fully adjusted regression models were run for\neach outcome. Inclusion of covariates into multivariable\nmodels was determined by significant association (P < 0.05)\nof the variable with the outcome in nongenetic univariate\nmodels in at least one of the race/ethnicities. Beta-coefficients\nand prevalence odds ratios, along with 95% confidence inter-\nvals, were estimated from the regression models. Differences\nin effects between men and women were estimated and tested\nby including genotype \u00d7 sex interaction terms in the models.\noriginal contributions\nHypertension, BP, and ACE I/D Variant in NHANES\nMain effect and genotype\u00adsex interaction analyses were also\nperformed on the subset of participants who were not tak-\ning ACE inhibitor medication at the time of the survey (n =\n5,280). All associations (descriptive and genetic) were tested\nat the threshold of 0.05 using the Satterthwaite-adjusted\nF-statistic, a conservative and preferred test statistic for the\nanalysis of complex survey data.23\nStatistical power to detect genetic associations within each\nrace/ethnic group was calculated using a two-sided  set at\n0.05 and assuming a design effect of 1.2. Minimum detect-\nable effect sizes given 80% power were calculated for additive,\ndominant, and recessive models.\nResults\nBasic demographic and clinical characteristics of the par-\nticipants are displayed in Table 1. All listed demographic\nvariables differed significantly by race/ethnicity (P < 0.05).\nMexican Americans had a larger proportion of males and\nfewer older adults (50 years) than non-Hispanic whites or\nnon-Hispanic blacks. Mean body mass index was highest\namong non-Hispanic blacks, who also displayed the greatest\nprevalences of diabetes and hypertension (P < 0.001 for all).\nThe use of any antihypertension medication differed signifi-\ncantly by race/ethnicity (P < 0.001; data not shown), whereas\nthe specific use of ACE inhibitors (noted by 281 \nparticipants,\nTable 1| Characteristics of included study participants by race/ethnicity,NHANES III DNA bank (1991\u00ad1994)\nCharacteristic\nP value\nWeighted\nfrequency (%)a\nor mean s.e.\nWeighted\nfrequency (%)\nor mean s.e.\nWeighted\nfrequency (%)\nor mean s.e.\nAge(years)(%)\nEducation(%)\nSmokingstatus(%)\nAlcoholuse(%)\nGenotype(%)d\nACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; BMI, body mass index; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; NHANES III, Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; SBP, systolic blood\npressure.\naWeighted percentage based on NHANES survey weights. bDefined as self-reported diabetes (answering\"yes\"to\"ever been told you have sugar/diabetes,\"but excluding women with\na history of only gestational diabetes) or hemoglobin A\n(HbA1c) 6.5%. cDefined as SBP 140mm Hg, DBP 90mm Hg, or currently taking prescribed medicine for hypertension.\ndGenotype prevalence listed as weighted frequency (95% confidence interval).\noriginal contributions Hypertension, BP, and ACE I/D Variant in NHANES\nor 4.18% of the total study population) was borderline\n\nsignificant across race/ethnicities (P = 0.051, Table 1).\nThe frequencies of the I/D variant in each race/ethnic\ngroup are almost identical to prevalence estimates that were\npreviously published for the entire NHANES III DNA bank\n(12 years old).18 Genotype prevalence varied significantly\nby race/ethnicity (P = 0.001, Table 1), with the prevalence\nof the DD genotype lowest among Mexican Americans and\nhighest among non-Hispanic blacks. Within each race/ethnic\ngroup, the distributions of the three genotypes did not dif-\nfer by sex, by age, by ACE inhibitor use, or by diabetes status\n(data not shown), nor did the distribution differ among those\nwith and without hypertension (Figure 1). Since some stud-\nies have noted a sex-specific association of the I/D variant with\nhypertension, we examined the prevalence of I/D according\nto hypertension status among males and females separately\nwithin each race/ethnicity. We found no differences in geno-\ntype prevalence between those with and without hypertension\namong males or females who identified as non-Hispanic white\nor non-Hispanic black. However, Mexican American females\nwith hypertension displayed a significantly different distri-\nbution of genotype frequencies compared to those without\nhypertension (P = 0.024; Figure 1). There was no such differ-\nence identified among Mexican American males.\nTo assess the contribution of the I/D variant to blood pres-\nsure variability and to the prevalence of hypertension in the\nUS population, we examined regression models separately for\neach racial/ethnic group. The D allele was significantly associ-\nated (P < 0.05) with an increase in SBP among non-Hispanic\nblacks in both age-sex and fully adjusted dominant models\n(Table 2) and additive models (Supplementary Table S1).\nThere were no significant findings among non-Hispanic whites\nor Mexican Americans for SBP under any genetic model\n(Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The main\neffect of the I/D variant was also not significantly associated\nwith DBP or hypertension in any race/ethnic group (Table 2\nand Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), though the associa-\ntion with DBP was marginally significant (P  0.063) in non-\nHispanic blacks under dominant models (Table 2). Though the\nassociations were not statistically significant in most \nmodels,\nthe direction of the effect was generally positive (associated\nwith greater odds of hypertension or with higher SBP and\nDBP) among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans,\nwhereas the associations trended toward lower SBP, DBP, and\nodds of hypertension among non-Hispanic whites (Table 2\nand Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).\nResults were not materially different when participants\ntaking ACE inhibitors were excluded from all analyses, with\none notable exception. In non-Hispanic blacks, the asso-\nciation of the I/D variant with DBP in dominant models\nbecame statistically significant (crude:  (95% confidence\nBecause sex-specific associations of the I/D variant with\nblood pressure or hypertension have been reported, we\n\nformally tested for the presence of genotype\u00adsex interac-\ntions.

Among Mexican\nAmericans, significant interactions (P < 0.05) were detected\nin additive and/or dominant models of SBP and hyperten-\nsion (Table 3), but not for DBP (data not shown). In these\nanalyses, a significant association of the I/D variant with\nSBP was found among women but not men in an age-sex\nadjusted additive model (P = 0.009 for the interaction). The\nI/D variant was also significantly associated with increased\nodds of hypertension in females in both age-sex and fully\nadjusted additive and dominant models, but showed no sig-\nnificant association among Mexican American males (P <\n0.05 for the interactions, Table 3).

For hypertension, we not\nonly calculated the smallest detectable odds ratio assuming 80%\npower, but we also calculated our power assuming an odds ratio\nof 1.3, which is indicative of effects found in candidate gene\nstudies24 and in genome-wide association studies.25 Under this\nscenario, additive models were adequately powered (93, 86, and\n68% among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and\nMexican Americans, respectively), whereas \ndominant models\nethnic groups).\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrated no association of the common ACE\nI/D variant with hypertension in any of the three main race/\nethnic groups in the United States, a finding that is in line with\nmany other studies (reviewed in ref. 10).

Of note, the most\nrecently published meta-analysis of studies in white individuals\nfound that blood pressure was not associated with I/D genotype,\nthough this analysis is now outdated.4 The significant results in\nnon-Hispanic blacks may need to be interpreted cautiously, as\nwe did not correct for multiple testing since we included only\nTable 2| Association of the ACE I/D variant with blood pressure and hypertension in dominant models\nSBP DBP Hypertension\n-Coefficient\n-Coefficient\nNon-Hispanicwhites\nNon-Hispanicblacks\nMexicanAmericans\nACE, angiotensin I-converting enzyme; CI, confidence interval; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; I/D, insertion/deletion; OR, odds ratio; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\naFully adjusted models include age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, and diabetes.

It is interesting\nthat the effect of the I/D variant trended in opposite directions\nfor non-Hispanic whites compared with non-Hispanic blacks\nand Mexican Americans, though very few associations reached\nstatistical significance. This may reflect unknown allelic hetero-\ngeneity or gene\u00adenvironment interactions.\nSex-specific effects of the I/D variant have been noted in\nvarious populations,5,14,15 though we found evidence of a gen-\notype\u00adsex interaction in only one race/ethnic group. Indeed,\nwhile no association of the I/D variant with blood pressure\nor hypertension was found in the total Mexican American\npopulation, we detected such associations among Mexican\nAmerican females. This finding may also be a consequence of\ninteractions with environmental or phenotypic factors.10\nThe functional significance of the I/D variant has been dem-\nonstrated in multiple studies,2\u00ad7 though other tightly linked\npolymorphisms may be responsible for these findings.8,9 Serum\nACE levels were not measured in NHANES III, so we were\nunable to examine the association between I/D genotypes and\nACE enzyme levels or activity. The only genome-wide asso-\nciation study to examine genomic loci for serum ACE activity\nfound eight ACE polymorphisms significantly associated, of\nwhich only rs4343 was moved forward into further analyses.26\nvariance in serum ACE activity among the study participants\n(1,023 hypertensive patients) after adjustment for age, gender,\nand ACE inhibitor medication use. Though the authors26 did\nnot list the other significantly associated ACE variants, prior\nresearch has indicated a high amount of linkage disequilib-\nin individuals of European or African descent.27\u00ad29 Of note, a\nrecent meta-analysis of four studies found a significant asso-\nciation between rs4343 and hypertension among some race/\nethnic groups (Gulf Arabs and Pakistanis combined), but not\nothers (Han Chinese).30\nOur study has several limitations. First, NHANES are cross-\nsectional surveys, so we could not evaluate hypertension\nincidence. In addition, we were unable to assess population\nstratification, as data from ancestry-informative markers are\nnot yet available for NHANES III. However, our large sam-\nple size allowed for separate analyses within each major race/\nethnic group, self-reported designations shown to correspond\nwith ancestry as derived from ancestry-informative markers\nfor these populations.31\u00ad33 Race/ethnicity-stratified analy-\nses enabled us to account, at least partially, for differences\nin: blood pressure distribution and hypertension prevalence;\ngenotype prevalence; and linkage disequilibrium patterns\nbetween race/ethnicities. Nevertheless, we cannot overlook\nthat there may be residual population substructure that may\nhave affected our results. This may be particularly true for\nMexican Americans, in whom we detected sex-specific effects\nthough we were least powered to do so. Our study strengths\ninclude the large sample size, the availability of detailed infor-\nmation on a number of potential confounders, and the pop-\nulation-based representation of the three major race/ethnic\ngroups in the United States.\nWe did not examine potential interactions with environ-\nmental factors such as sodium intake, which was assessed in\nNHANES III by a single 24-h dietary recall. Dietary assess-\nment methods have poor correlation to the 24-h urine col-\nlection,34 which is often used as an external measure to assess\nthe validity of dietary evaluation.35 In addition, 24-h dietary\nrecalls have poorer correlations both with long-term sodium\nintake and with within-subject repeat measures compared to\n24-h urine samples.34 There were no urinary sodium excretion\nmeasurements performed in NHANES III that could validate\na self-reported 24-h dietary intake.\nOverall, the lack of consensus on the effect of the I/D vari-\nant on hypertension-related traits is likely due to a combina-\ntion of factors. First, examining the I/D variant in isolation may\nmask any effects, as interaction with other loci are probably\nimportant, including loci in non-ACE and nonrenin pathways\nthat are capable of producing angiotensin II. However, hyper-\ntension-associated variants such as those in angiotensinogen\n(CYP11B2)39 have not yet been genotyped in NHANES III.\nAlso, the I/D variant is possibly a marker for true functional\npolymorphism(s) in the ACE locus. No other ACE variants were\ngenotyped in NHANES III, so we could not examine the gene\nin greater detail. Conversely, it is possible that common genetic\nvariation (compared to rare alleles) in such classic pathways as\nthe renin\u00adangiotensin system does not play a significant role in\nblood pressure regulation or in the etiology of hypertension.40\nIn conclusion, we found minimal evidence for associations\nor for sex-specific effects of the ACE I/D polymorphism with\nblood pressure variation or with hypertension in United States\nadults, though interactions with other genes or environmental\nfactors cannot be discounted.\nSupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at http://\nwww.nature.com/ajh\n"
