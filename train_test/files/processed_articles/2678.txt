We further suggest police departments use training programs and community\nactivities to minimize implicit bias among their officers.\nKeywords\npolice, deadly force, race, implicit bias\nPolicing in America is in the midst of a legitimacy crisis, having faced immense\nscrutiny in recent years resulting in large part from several highly publicized deadly\nforce incidents captured on video (e.g., most recently, Keith Lamont Scott in\nCharlotte, NC and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, OK). These videos have gone \"viral\" on\nsocial media and have led to unprecedented levels of public discontent with the police\n(Weitzer, 2015). This discontent has fueled violence toward police officers: in July 2016\nin Dallas, for example, a peaceful protest turned deadly when five officers were fatally shot\nand another nine wounded.1 One specific concern is that minorities are disproportionately\nshot and killed by the police. For example, Black Lives Matter (n.d.) has proclaimed on\nits website that \"Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise\" and\nthat \"[e]very 28 hours a Black man, woman, or child is murdered by police or vigilante\nlaw enforcement.\" These statements imply that the police are overtly prejudiced toward\nminorities, which is certainly possible but unlikely. The results of experimental studies,\nhowever, have suggested that officers might be implicitly biased against minorities and more\nlikely to use force against them as a result (i.e., the \"implicit bias\" effect; see Correll, Park,\nthe same time, the results of more recent research have pointed to evidence of a \"counter\nbias\" effect, whereby officers seem more hesitant to use force against minorities (James,\nJames, and Vila, 2016; James, Vila, and Klinger, 2014). Mixed findings have been produced\nin prior studies examining the relationship between civilian2 race and police use of deadly\nforce (Goldkamp, 1976; Jacobs and Britt, 1979; Klinger, Rosenfeld, Isom, and Deckard,\n2015; Sorenson, Marquart, and Brock, 1993), but importantly, the focus has been on either\nsingle cities or national-level data that have noted flaws (Swaine and Laughland, 2015;\nWilliams, Bowman, and Jung, 2016). Consequently, our knowledge of race and police\ndeadly force at the national level is limited. Although many claims have been made, three\nempirical questions remain unanswered: (1) How often do civilians die by police gunfire\nin the United States? (2) Among those shot and killed, were minority civilians less likely\n1. Ten days later, three Baton Rouge police officers were ambushed and killed. There is growing concern\nabout a \"war on cops,\" but a recent article suggested that felonious killings of police officers do not\nseem to be increasing (Maguire, Nix, and Campbell, 2016).\n2. Here and throughout this article, we use the term \"civilian\" to refer to individuals not employed by a law\nenforcement agency.\n310 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\nthan White civilians to have been attacking the police or others? (3) Among those shot and\nkilled, were minority civilians more likely to have been unarmed than White citizens?\nOne reason for our absence of knowledge is the lack of national data available that\nwould allow researchers to address adequately such questions. Ironically, it was only after the\nAugust 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, that Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) Director James Comey became aware that his agency does not collect reliable data\npertaining to civilians killed by the police (Comey, 2015). Although the FBI through its\nUniform Crime Reports (UCR) Program keeps a record of justifiable homicides (i.e., the\nkilling of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty), reporting is voluntary and\nnot all agencies participate. According to The Guardian, only 224 agencies (or approximately\nIndeed, academic research findings have suggested that the FBI's data underestimate the\nprevalence of civilian deaths at the hands of police (Fyfe, 2002; Klinger, 2012b; Klinger\nU.S. government to develop a national database on officer-involved shootings (see, e.g.,\nproposed bills offer promise--but for now, the state of knowledge concerning police deadly\nforce in the U.S. remains \"a national embarrassment\" (Alpert, 2015b).\nAlthough the government has failed to provide the necessary information on police\nshooting deaths, at least two media outlets have developed national data sets. The Washington\nPost and The Guardian have developed repositories of reported officer-involved shootings\nand other use-of-force incidents resulting in civilian deaths. These resources afford re-\nsearchers an opportunity previously unavailable: the ability to analyze all civilian deaths at\nthe hands of the police on a national scale over an extended period of time. The purpose of\nthe present study is twofold: The first is to analyze the data on civilians shot and killed by\npolice in 2015, and the second is to determine whether minority civilians shot and killed\nby police were more or less likely to have been (a) attacking the police or (b) unarmed at\nthe time of their death. Such an analysis will allow for a more informed dialogue about the\nextent and nature of civilian deaths at the hands of police in America. We believe it will also\nprovide a meaningful contribution to our knowledge concerning the \"implicit bias\" effect,\ngiven that studies to date have relied on research carried out in laboratory settings or with\ndata from a single agency.\nLiterature Review\nPolice Use of Force\nPolice use of force is a controversial topic with a rich history. For decades, researchers have\nsought to provide a better understanding of the use of force by police officers (Adams et al.,\n1953). This line of research has generally been used to examine the issue from one of\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\nfour perspectives: individual (e.g., Paoline and Terrill, 2004), situational (e.g., McCluskey\nand Terrill, 2005), organizational (e.g., Smith, 2004), or ecological (e.g., Fridell and Lim,\n2016). The individual perspective holds that there is something about particular officers\n(e.g., their background or outlook) that makes them more likely to resort to using force in\na given interaction (Muir, 1977). The findings from this research indicate that officers with\nhigher levels of education are less likely to use force (Lim, Fridell, and Lee, 2014; Paoline\nbetter equipped to defuse a situation without having to resort to physical coercion. Officer\ngender and race, on the other hand, seem to be unrelated to use of force (Engel and Calnon,\ncorrelated with police use of force: those who have been in law enforcement longer seem\nnot only less likely to use force (Paoline and Terrill, 2007), but also they tend to have less\nfavorable attitudes toward using force (Kop and Euwema, 2001). Furthermore, a positive\ncorrelation between experience and certain types of force (e.g., electronic control devices--\nsee Fridell and Lim, 2016) has been suggested by some researchers, whereas still others have\nfailed to find a significant relationship (Lawton, 2007; Sun and Payne, 2004). Thus, beyond\nthe effect of officer education on use of force, the evidence pertaining to individual officer\ncharacteristics is mixed at best.\nAn understanding of the situational perspective shifts the focus to the suspect. Black\n(1976), for example, argued that the police are more likely to use coercive force against\nmembers of the lower class (e.g., the poor, minorities, and youth). Suspects who are mentally\nill, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, noncompliant, or otherwise disrespectful are also\nat a greater likelihood of having force used against them in part because the police view these\nsuspects as more deserving of punishment (see also Van Maanen, 1974). Officers are more\nlikely to use force when there is evidence that a crime has been committed (McCluskey\nand Terrill, 2005) or when the suspect is armed (Johnson, 2011), under the influence\nof drugs/alcohol (Engel, Sobol, and Wordon, 2000), or resistant (McCluskey and Terrill,\n2005). The evidence is not so clear-cut with respect to gender: the police are more likely\nto use force against males (Engel and Calnon, 2004; Kaminski, DiGiovanni, and Downs,\nhave indicated no relationship exists between the decision to use force and suspect gender\n(Engel et al., 2000; Lawton, 2007). Results from research exploring the effect of suspect race\non police use of force have been mixed as well. Minority suspects have a greater likelihood\nof being subjected to force (Engel and Calnon, 2004; Robin, 1963; Terrill and Mastrofski,\n2002), according to some researchers, whereas others have found no relationship between\nsuspect race and use of force (McCluskey and Terrill, 2005; Sun and Payne, 2004), and\nstill others have suggested that race effects wash away when accounting for other variables\nsuch as compliance (Garner, Maxwell, and Heraux, 2002). Further complicating matters,\nBlack suspects seem more likely to resist arrest and/or be combative than White suspects\n312 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\nwhich may explain any observed racial disparities in force applied by the police. Given the\ncurrent state of affairs in the United States, it is imperative that researchers continue to\nconsider whether suspect race significantly influences police use of force.\nThe organizational perspective seeks to explain variation in officer use of force using\nagency-level characteristics. Police agencies--with their formal policies, standard operating\nprocedures, and system of rewarding and disciplining officers--encourage officers to handle\nsimilar encounters in a consistent manner (Wilson, 1968). When longitudinal research has\nbeen conducted in single cities, restrictive deadly force policies yield fewer instances of deadly\nsample of 265 agencies, Alpert and MacDonald (2001) found that agencies that required\nsupervisors to complete use-of-force forms experienced significantly lower rates of force\nthan did agencies that allowed officers to complete such forms on their own. Importantly,\nhowever, these authors also found that the violent crime rate exerted the strongest influence\non use of force. Smith (2004) found that more \"formal\" agencies (i.e., those with a greater\nnumber of written rules) did not experience significantly fewer police killings; nevertheless,\nthe hours of field training required was positively associated with police killings. Again, the\nevidence with respect to the relationship between organizational variables and police use of\nforce is mixed, and more research is needed to help shed light on the topic.\nFinally, the ecological perspective asserts that police behavior, including the decision to\nuse force, varies according to the broader context of where the incident takes place (Bayley\nofficers are more likely to use force in areas that they perceive as more dangerous. Bayley\nand Mendelsohn (1969) suggested that the police are more apt to use coercion and make\narrests in neighborhoods with high levels of crime, and Terrill and Reisig (2003) later\ndemonstrated that police in two cities were more likely to use greater levels of force on\nsuspects in neighborhoods characterized by disadvantage and high homicide rates (see also\nMcCluskey, Terrill, and Paoline, 2005; cf. Lim et al., 2014). These effects were observed\nregardless of differences in officer age, education, and training. Furthermore, the relationship\nbetween suspect race and level of force used was mediated by neighborhood context.\nKlinger et al. (2015) found that neither economic disadvantage nor racial composition\nof neighborhoods influenced police shootings, but the rate of firearm violence exerted a\nsignificant curvilinear effect. That is, neighborhoods with moderate levels of firearm violence\nexperienced the greatest number of police shootings over a 10-year span. Beyond these few\nstudies, empirical research regarding the ecology of police force has been scant.\nAt a minimum, then, the results from this body of research have suggested that police\nuse of force is an intricate issue with many factors potentially affecting its occurrence.\nEach of the four perspectives--individual, situational, organizational, and ecological--\nhave received varying amounts of support. Up to this point, we have discussed police use\nof force generally. We now turn our attention to the most serious level of force: deadly\nforce.\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\nDeadly Police Force\nDeadly force by police has been a concern for the American public for many decades\nthe forefront again because of several highly publicized civilian deaths (Nix and Wolfe, 2015,\nwe do not have a good understanding of police use of deadly force because existing national\ndata reported by the government are flawed. The approach taken in prior reviews and\nresearch has been to rely on either UCR data or on the National Vital Statistics System\n(NVSS), and generally, researchers have concurred that police use of deadly force is positively\ncorrelated with violent crime (Jacobs and Britt, 1979; MacDonald, Kaminski, Alpert, and\n1993). Nevertheless, the findings from subsequent research have demonstrated that both the\nUCR and the NVSS underestimate the frequency with which civilians are killed by police.\nPlanty et al. (2015), for example, suggested the police kill about twice as many civilians in a\ngiven year than UCR and NVSS data indicate. As such, the findings from studies that have\nused these data must be interpreted with caution.\nFurthermore, as Fyfe (1978: 32) pointed out, deadly force encompasses much more\nthan just civilian deaths at the hands of police: it is \"physical force capable of or likely to\nkill; it does not always kill.\" As noted, this is a second limitation of prior research because\nthe police are using deadly force every time they fire their weapon--even if the suspect is\nwounded and survives or the bullets miss the suspect altogether. In Miami-Dade during the\n49% of the time and that only 16% of all suspects fired at were killed.\nFinally, as Klinger et al. (2015) pointed out, using national-level data results in aggre-\ngation bias. In their analysis of police shootings in 355 census block groups over a 10-year\nperiod, 208 blocks (58.6%) did not experience a single police shooting during that time-\nframe. Thus, national-level data are problematic because they mask heterogeneity within\nmuch smaller units of analysis, such as cities or census blocks. The alternative is to get a\n\"worm's-eye view\" of civilians killed by police by restricting analysis to one city, a group\nof cities, or one state. Klinger et al. (2015) provided one of the most sophisticated studies\nto date using a worm's-eye view, but unfortunately, it is impossible to know the generaliz-\nability of their findings. In other words, their study cannot provide any insight as to how\noften or how many civilians were killed by police nationwide. Given the recent emergence\nof national-level data collected by the media and Web-based crowdsourcing projects, it is\nimportant for researchers to examine the nature and extent of civilian deaths at the hands\nof the police.3\n3. Ironically, it was The Washington Post that conducted one of the most comprehensive studies on police\nshootings. On November 15, 1998, the newspaper started a series of articles evaluating police shootings\n314 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\nImplicit or counter bias? Much of the debate surrounding police use of deadly force\nin recent years has centered on the impression that Black civilians are disproportionately\nkilled by the police. Many publicized incidents involve White officers and Black civilians:\nMichael Brown in Ferguson, Walter Scott in North Charleston, Tamir Rice in Cleveland,\nand Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, MN. Although it is possible that some police\nofficers harbor explicitly biased attitudes toward minorities, psychological researchers have\ndemonstrated that less conscious attitudes also influence police behavior (Dovidio, Glick,\nunconscious profiling offered one possible explanation for why police would be more\ninclined to use deadly force against Blacks. According to the researchers, police officers\nover time become unconsciously biased toward minorities through social conditioning (i.e.,\nrepeated contact with minorities involved in deviance) or illusory correlation mechanisms\n(as it applies here, the tendency to overestimate the correlation between race and crime; see\nalso Hamilton and Gifford, 1976). In other words, the police, who are trained in the first\nplace to be suspicious, become conditioned to view minorities with added suspicion.4\nAlthough up to this point national data have not permitted researchers to assess\nadequately whether the police are more likely to use deadly force against minority civilians,\nimportant insight about the \"implicit bias\" effect has been exposed through experimental\nresearch. Payne (2001), for example, randomly presented study participants with an image\nof a White or a Black face and then briefly flashed an image of either a gun or a tool.\nThey were instructed to identify the object as a gun or a tool as quickly as possible. Results\ndemonstrated that participants were faster to identify an object as a gun when they had\nbeen primed with a Black face than when they had been primed with a White face. They\nwere also more likely to identify tools mistakenly as guns when they had been shown a\nBlack face. In a separate study, undergraduate students played a videogame whereby they\nwere randomly presented with one of four images: a White man holding a gun, a White\nman holding some other object, a Black man holding a gun, or a Black man holding some\nother object. The participants were instructed to determine whether the man was holding a\ngun and react by pressing a \"shoot\" or \"don't shoot\" button as quickly as possible. Findings\nincluded that participants shot more quickly at armed Black men than at armed White\nmen, and they decided not to shoot unarmed Whites more quickly than unarmed Blacks\nThe results of these studies have suggested that race (or color) is an important factor in\ndetermining whether a suspect is perceived to be a threat and, in turn, whether to shoot the\nperson. Nevertheless, the participants in these studies were college students and the findings\nmight not be generalizable to police officers, who should be trained extensively on how to\nin the Washington Metropolitan Police Force. See washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/\ndcpolice/deadlyforce/police1full.htm.\n4. For a review of prejudice and racial profiling more broadly, see Wilson, Dunham, and Alpert (2004).\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\nassess and respond to threats. Moreover, pressing one of two keyboard buttons to simulate\nthe decision to shoot or not shoot is a far cry from pulling the trigger of a gun.5\nThat said, Cox and colleagues (2014) addressed these limitations by randomly assign-\ning 54 police officers to complete a shooter simulation (using a realistic gun) in one of\ntwo neighborhoods: the first a predominantly non-White, high-crime neighborhood, and\nthe other a predominantly White, low-crime neighborhood. Officers were told they were\nresponding to a call with armed criminals nearby, and then they were presented with a series\nof pictures and video simulations. Results indicated that officers were faster to shoot armed\nBlack suspects in the picture trials but slower to shoot them in video trials presumably\nbecause they had a longer response window and therefore more time to exercise caution.\nJames and colleagues (2014; James, James, et al., 2016) provided further evidence of a\n\"reverse racism\" or \"counter bias\" effect, which means that officers are in fact more hesitant\nto use force against minorities for fear of the media backlash it could create. In these studies,\npolice officers completed a simulator that involved \"highly realistic, custom-made, high-\ndefinition video scenarios\" that \"depicted domestic disturbances, vehicle stops, robberies\nin progress, and investigations of suspicious persons/circumstances\" (James, James, et al.,\n2016: 7). Participating officers were armed with a modified Glock model 22s, which had\ninfrared emitters that registered shot placement on the video screen and the exact time (in\nmilliseconds) the officer pulled the trigger. The researchers found that officers were slower\nto shoot armed Black suspects than armed White suspects and that they were less likely to\nshoot unarmed Black suspects than unarmed White suspects.6\nCollectively, the research results leave us with more questions than answers. There are\nsound theoretical principles to consider that Black civilians are disproportionately considered\na threat by the police (Smith and Alpert, 2007), but empirical support for the implicit bias\nJames, et al., 2016; Payne, 2001). Previous research findings have left us with the critical\nquestions: (a) How often civilians are killed by the police, and (b) are minority civilians\nmore likely than White civilians to pose a threat to police by attacking them and/or being\narmed with a deadly weapon?\nThe Current Study\nThe primary contribution of the present study is that it represents one of the first analyses\nof civilians shot and killed by police using national-level data other than the data from the\nUCR or the NVSS. By using data collected by The Washington Post, we were able to provide\n5. It is also important to mention that researchers have shown that violent video games increase\naggressive behavior in young adults (see Anderson and Bushman, 2001).\n6. Interestingly, these studies were completed before Michael Brown's death in Ferguson in 2014.\n316 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\na breakdown of the characteristics of deadly shootings that occurred in 2015.7 Second, we\nused these data to consider whether minority civilians killed by police gunfire were more\nlikely to have not been attacking the police or more likely to have been unarmed at the time\nof their death, which based on prior literature would suggest implicit bias on the part of\nthe police. Simulation data or single-agency use-of-force data have been relied on in prior\nstudies. Officers who participate in simulation studies are not in any real danger and in fact\nmight exert more caution in \"shooting\" minority suspects simply because they do not want\nto be labeled prejudiced by their command staff. Our analysis provides insight as to whether\nthe implicit bias effect manifests itself in the real world where officer safety is an immediate\nconcern. Although we could not determine whether officers were quicker or more likely to\nfire their weapon at minority suspects, we argue that if minorities were more likely to have not\nbeen attacking the police/other civilians, or more likely to have been unarmed, this would\nindicate the police exhibit implicit bias by falsely perceiving minorities to be a greater threat\nto their safety (i.e., threat perception failures; see Fachner and Carter, 2015). Specifically,\nwe sought to answer the following three research questions with the current study:\nR1: What are the individual, city, and agency characteristics of all fatal shootings by police\nR2: Among those fatally shot, were minority civilians more likely than White civilians to\nhave not been attacking the police or other civilians?\nR3: Among those fatally shot, were minority civilians more likely than White civilians to\nhave been unarmed?\nMethod\nData\nData analyzed in the current study were ascertained from three sources. The primary data\nsource is The Washington Post's National Police Shooting Database. In 2015, The Post began\ncompiling data on the characteristics of incidents in which a civilian was shot and killed by\nthe police in the United States. The data were collected by a team of journalists employed\nby The Post who scoured Web-based news articles, public records, Internet databases, and\ncivilian reports to identify all civilians killed by a firearm, discharged by an officer acting in\nthe line of duty, in 2015.8 These data are one of the first nationally representative samples of\n7. Unfortunately, these data are limited to police shootings that resulted in the death of a civilian. Ideally,\nwe would like to be able to investigate each instance in which a police officer decided to pull the\ntrigger, but to date, these are the best available data pertaining to police shootings at the national level.\n8. An anonymous reviewer suggested that The Post's database may be biased because of missing cases.\nAlthough it is certainly possible that The Post did not identify every fatal shooting, it should be noted\nthat its total number of deadly shootings aligns very closely with other databases such as that of The\nGuardian. Those compiling the data were tasked with collecting data on all fatal shootings, not simply\nthose that were highly publicized. Indeed, The Washington Post was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in early\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\npersons killed by the police9 and contain baseline information on 990 incidents including\nthe demographics of civilians killed (e.g., age, race, and mental illness), circumstances\nsurrounding the event (e.g., civilian armed/unarmed and threat level), the agency responsible\nState and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA) were used to obtain additional data\npertaining to city- and agency-level characteristics.\nDependent Variables\nOfficial data (e.g., UCR and NVSS) has typically been analyzed to examine the impact\nof agency- and city-level variables on the aggregate number of civilians killed by police\nagencies (Smith, 2003, 2004). By using The Post data, we additionally examined two unique\ndependent variables that serve as indicators of threat perception failure. First, we examined\nwhether civilians shot and killed by the police were attacking law enforcement or another\ncivilian prior to their death. This variable was created using information collected by The\nPost's research team indicating the level of threat posed by civilians immediately before their\ndemise. To gather this information, several members of The Post's research team reviewed\neach incident and attempted to reach consensus on whether an attack was in progress based\non information ascertained from online news resources (e.g., news articles), statements made\nby public officials, and when necessary, phone calls to police officials. Specifically, the team\ncollected data regarding whether civilians were (a) firing a gun at a person (police officers\nor other civilians), (b) attacking with nongun weapons, (c) pointing/brandishing a firearm,\n(d) posing other threats (e.g., brandishing a knife/sharp object, refusing to drop a nongun\nweapon, driving a vehicle at a person, or moving quickly/lunging toward an officer without\na deadly weapon), (e) making furtive movements, (f) fleeing, or (g) accidentally shot by\npolice.11 These categories were hierarchical, such that the team members started with \"firing\n2016 for the collection and publication of its data. The newspaper has also committed to collecting data\nthrough 2016. See washingtonpost.com/graphics/2016/pulitzer-prize-winner-and-finalist/.\n9. Other endeavors to collect data on persons killed by the police have been undertaken by The\nGuardian's \"The Counted\" project, as well as by killedbypolice.net and fatalencounters.org, both\ncrowd-sourcing projects. Both sources include all deaths caused by both on- and off-duty police\nofficers, including deaths that resulted from being struck by police vehicles, Tasers (Taser International\nInc., Scottsdale, AZ), deaths in custody, firearms, and other actions by the police contributing to citizen\ndeaths. Although these data sources provide a comprehensive picture of police-involved deaths, The\nPost's data are unique in that they only include cases in which citizens were killed by on-duty police\nofficers who intended to use deadly force.\n10. Although perceived threat level on the part of the officer involved is part of the equation to determine\nwhether a shooting is justified, we are primarily limited to the information gleaned from news reports\nby The Post's research team. Note also that no data pertaining to the demographic characteristics of the\nofficers involved in each shooting were compiled.\n11. Although the behaviors included in item d certainly represent a threat to officers or others, we argue\nthey do not constitute an attack. The threat posed is less imminent than are those behaviors in items a\nthrough c, and it is therefore feasible that officers may have been able to use less than lethal force in\n318 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\na gun\" and worked their way down, assigning the first category that applied to each incident.\nIn a small number of cases, The Post could not reach consensus; these cases were deemed an\nundetermined threat level. For the present study, incidents were coded as an attack if, prior\nto their demise, civilians were firing a weapon at a person, attacking with nongun weapons,\nor pointing/brandishing a firearm. Non-attack is a dichotomous measure of whether an\nincident did not fit into one of these three categories (1 = non-attack, 0 = attack). Second,\nwe examined whether civilians were armed with a deadly weapon at the time of their death.\nThe Post coded civilians as armed when they were in possession of a firearm, knife, sharp\nobject, or some other deadly weapon (e.g., blunt object). Based on this information, we\noperationalized unarmed as a dichotomous variable (1 = unarmed, 0 = armed).12\nIndependent Variables\nCivilian Race/ethnicity. Our key independent variable was the race/ethnicity of civilians\nkilled by the police. Mixed results concerning police officer bias have been produced when\nusing single-agency data: evidence of implicit bias has been found by some researchers,\nwhereby officers perceive minorities as a greater threat (Correll et al., 2002; Cox et al.,\nwhereby officers are more hesitant to use force against minorities (James et al., 2014; James,\nJames, et al., 2016). To assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and our measures of\nthreat perception failure (i.e., the dependent variables non-attack and unarmed), we created\ntwo dummy variables--Black and Other race/ethnicity (e.g., Hispanic/Latino, Asian, Pacific\nIslander, and Mixed)--with White serving as the reference category. Significant race effects\nwould be indicative of implicit bias in fatal shootings by police officers in 2015.\nControl Variables\nWe also included several control variables in our multivariate statistical models to maximize\nthe likelihood of generating unbiased estimates. Control variables included in the analysis\nwere grouped into three categories: (a) civilian characteristics, (b) city characteristics, and\n(c) agency characteristics.\nCivilian Characteristics. We controlled for three civilian characteristics: civilian age,\nwhether the civilian displayed signs of mental illness, and whether the civilian was\narmed/attacking the officer(s) or others.13 Age was measured continuously, whereas mental\nthese situations. As an example, officers are discouraged from shooting into vehicles because of the\ndangerousness of doing so and the ease with which they could sidestep the vehicle in most scenarios.\nYet just to be sure, we ran supplementary analyses whereby the cases included in item d were placed in\nthe attack category. Results remained substantively the same even when correcting for potential\nsmall-sample bias and using multiple missing data imputation methods (available upon request).\n12. Note that civilians who grabbed an officer's firearm were coded as armed.\n13. That is, in the regression model where unarmed is the dependent variable, we control for whether the\ncivilian was attacking the officer(s) or others. In the regression model where non-attack is the\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\nillness was measured dichotomously (1 = displayed signs of mental illness). Armed (1 = yes)\nand attack (1 = yes) are also measured dichotomously.\nCity and Agency Characteristics. Based on the results presented in prior literature, we\nwould expect police shootings to be impacted by regional characteristics, violent crime rates,\nthe size of the city/jurisdiction, and agency characteristics (Smith, 2003, 2004). Accordingly,\nwe controlled for UCR region with three dummy variables: Northeast, Midwest, and West\n(South serves as the reference category because of its larger population, higher levels of violent\ncrime, and the role of race in its history). The violent crime rate per 100,000 residents for\neach jurisdiction was also obtained from the 2012 UCR14 and was measured by using two\ndummy variables for moderate crime (1 = 25th to 74th percentile) and high crime (1 = 75th\npercentile or higher; low crime [below the 25th percentile] serves as the reference category).15\nWith respect to jurisdiction size, large city was a dichotomous variable indicating that the\njurisdiction had a population of 100,000 or more residents. Finally, we used data from\nthe CSLLEA to control for agency size and whether an agency operated its own training\nacademy. Large agency indicated that the officer involved in the shooting was employed\nby an agency with 1,000 or more full-time sworn police officers, and In-house academy\n(1 = yes) indicated that the involved officer's agency operates its own training academy (as\nthese academies typically exceed state-mandated minimum hours, and the results of prior\nresearch have suggested officers who undergo more hours of training are less likely to use\nAnalytic Strategy\nOur analyses proceeded in two steps. First, to provide a comprehensive examination of\ncivilian-, city-, and agency-level characteristics of all fatal shootings by police in 2015,\nwe present descriptive univariate statistics. This descriptive analysis was critical because to\nthe best of our knowledge this was the first study that used The Washington Post data\nto provide a baseline understanding of the characteristics surrounding incidents in which\ncivilians were shot and killed by police. Second, because our measures of threat percep-\ntion failure--non-attack and unarmed--are dichotomous, we estimated two multivariate\nlogistic regression models using StataSE 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). These analy-\nses allowed us to provide context to the most controversial police shootings--when civilians\ndependent variable, we control for whether the civilian was armed. Note also that given the very small\nnumber of females present in the data, and consistent with reviewer recommendations, we elected not\nto control for gender.\n14. Four UCR measures were used to create the violent crime rate variable: (1) robbery, (2) aggravated\nassault, (3) forcible rape, and (4) murder.\n15. We realize this only allowed us to compare the 990 incidents to each other in terms of the various\njurisdictional crime rates, but we think it provides useful information nonetheless, allowing us to\ndetermine whether, for example, civilians were more likely to attack officers or be armed in jurisdictions\nwith higher rates of violent crime.\n320 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\ndid not pose an imminent threat to law enforcement or others. We first examined whether\nrace was associated with the likelihood of a civilian having not attacked the officer(s) or\nother civilian(s), net of control variables. Then, we estimated a second logistic model that\nregressed our race and control variables onto the unarmed dependent variable. In short,\nthese analyses examined whether race was significantly associated with our measures of\nthreat perception failure (as significant race effects would be suggestive of implicit bias), net\nof other theoretically important factors.16\nAfter several diagnostic tests were conducted, no harmful levels of collinearity were\nfound to be present in the multivariate models. First, all bivariate correlations fell below an\nabsolute value of .70 (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013). Second, all variance inflation factors\nfrom the multivariate models fell below 2.1, which was well below the recommended\nthreshold of 4.0 (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013). Finally, all condition indices fell below the\nResults\nThe first step of our analysis was to provide an in-depth understanding of deadly police\nshootings on a national scale. Table 1 displays the characteristics of the 990 police fatal\nshootings that occurred in the United States in 2015.17 Most civilians shot and killed\n= 36.7). Slightly less than half of these deadly shootings occurred in the South (42.8%).\nThe overwhelming majority of civilians shot and killed were armed with a deadly weapon\nfourths of these civilians were attacking the officer(s) or other civilians at the time of\nthe deadly shooting--either firing a gun (27.7%), attacking officers without a gun (e.g.,\nphysically assaulting them, 15.7%), or pointing/brandishing a gun (30.4%). Less severe\nthreats to officer/public safety included brandishing or refusing to drop nongun weapons\n(16.5%) and furtive movements (3.5%). A few civilians who were shot and killed were either\nfleeing (1.1%) or accidentally shot (0.7%). Approximately 1 in every 4 of these civilians\ndisplayed signs of mental illness.\nTable 2 provides information about city- and agency-level characteristics of the deadly\nshootings. More than 700 different agencies were involved in at least one shooting, the\nemployed listwise deletion to handle cases with missing race, UCR, and/or CSLLEA data, and as such,\nthe sample was reduced to N = 599. Nevertheless, to check the robustness of our findings, we\nperformed supplementary analyses--first using hot deck imputation (Myers, 2011) and again using\nmultiple imputation with chained equations (White, Royston, and Wood, 2011). The results remained\nsubstantively the same and are available upon request.\n18.

Almost 60% of fatal shootings in 2015 occurred in a jurisdiction with\n100,000 or more residents. Finally, as mentioned, we split the shootings into three categories\nbased on their crime rate according to the 2012 UCR. Roughly 18% of the deadly shootings\ninvolved officers employed in jurisdictions with high crime, whereas about 33% and 17%\ninvolved officers employed in jurisdictions with moderate and low crime, respectively.\n19. Note that many agencies were involved in multiple deadly shootings (e.g., the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment was involved in 21 over the course of the year).\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\nT A B L E 3\nCross-Tabulations of Citizen Race With Armed/Unarmed and\nAttack/Non-attacka\nVariable White Black Other Total\naTwenty-seven cases are excluded from this table because of missing race information.\nbCases involving an undetermined threat level were excluded from multivariate regression models.\nThe next step of our analysis was to determine whether the data provided evidence of\nimplicit bias. Table 3 provides a closer look at the intersection of race and (a) whether the\ncivilian was armed or unarmed and (b) whether the civilian was attacking the officer/other\ncivilians. Fifteen percent of Black civilians shot and killed by police last year were unarmed\nat the time of their death (Phi coefficient [] = .10, p < .01) compared with 6% of White\nroughly twice as many White civilians died by police gunfire as Black civilians (495 vs.\n258), more unarmed Black civilians (38) were shot and killed than unarmed White civilians\n(32). Similar findings emerged with respect to threat level: 24% of Black civilians ( =\nnot attacking the officer(s) or other civilians, whereas the same was true of approximately\n17% of White civilians ( = .14, p < .01). These simplistic findings provided preliminary\nevidence of an implicit bias effect, but they did not permit us to rule out the potential\nconfounding influence of other relevant variables.\nAccordingly, we next used multivariate regression models to predict our two measures\nof threat perception failure (see Table 4 for descriptive statistics of all variables used in\nthis analysis).20 Table 5 presents the results from a logistic model that regressed non-attack\nonto our two race variables along with 11 control variables that accounted for the potential\nconfounding influences of whether the civilian was armed, age, mental illness, region, crime,\nsize of jurisdiction, size of agency, and the officer involved was employed by an agency that\noperates its own basic training academy.

The Black coefficient is positive but statistically nonsignificant,\nwhich means Black civilians were no more or less likely than White civilians to have been\nattacking the officer(s) or other civilians when they were fatally shot by police. These results\nprovide support for an implicit bias effect with respect to non-Black minority groups. That\nis, civilians of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely than Whites to have been\nfatally shot because of an apparent threat perception failure.\nOur final multivariate analysis explored the factors associated with civilians having been\nunarmed at the time they were shot and killed by the police. Table 6 presents the results\nfrom a logistic model that regressed unarmed onto the race variables along with several\ncontrols. The model as a whole was statistically significant (Wald 2 = 115.86, p < .01)\nand explained roughly 19% of the variance in the outcome.

In the wake of controversial killings of unarmed Black civilians\n(e.g., Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, and Philando Castile, to name a few), awareness groups\nsuch as Black Lives Matter and Campaign Zero have been formed by activists who allege\nthat minorities are more likely than Whites to be victims of unjust police force. Their\nsuppositions claim the police are overtly prejudiced against minority groups, that minorities\n21. An anonymous reviewer pointed out that our regression model predicting unarmed may suffer from\nsmall-sample bias (i.e., a small number of cases in the \"unarmed\" category). We re-ran this model using\nfirthlogit (available in Stata 14), a penalized maximum likelihood estimation method that has been\nshown to reduce small-sample bias (Firth, 1993; Heinze and Schemper, 2002). The results were\nsubstantively unchanged; Black civilians remained significantly more likely than White civilians to have\nbeen unarmed prior to their demise.

Unfortunately, the results of\nempirical research on police use of deadly force at the national level have been plagued by\nunreliable data, leaving us unable to assess accurately how often the police shoot and kill\ncivilians, and whether minorities are unjustly killed by police at a higher rate than Whites.\nThese issues were examined in the present study by using data collected by The Washington\nPost on all civilians who were shot and killed by police officers in 2015. Some of the findings\nwarrant further discussion.\nThe Post's data indicate that 990 civilians were shot and killed by police officers in the\nline of duty last year. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the police make\ncontact with more than 40 million people each year. Out of these contacts, police force (or\nthreatened force) is used in less than 2% of these interactions (Eith and Durose, 2011).\nMoreover, most use-of-force incidents do not result in a death even when police officers\ncaused by police officers are extremely rare based on the overall number of police\u00adcivilian\nencounters. Additionally, as shown in the current analysis, most civilians killed by police\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\nwere armed with a deadly weapon or were actively attacking officers. Less than 10% (N =\n93) of civilians shot and killed by police in 2015 were unarmed.\nMainstream media and advocacy groups, most notably Black Lives Matter and Cam-\npaign Zero, have alleged that police disproportionately use force and deadly force against\nminorities. The Post data showed that police killed almost twice as many Whites as Blacks;\nnevertheless, this is expected as Whites far outnumber Blacks in the U.S. population. In\nan effort to standardize these numbers, The Guardian divides the number of White and\nBlack civilians killed by their respective population count. Presenting the number in this\nmanner suggests that Blacks were killed at more than twice the rate of Whites in 2015\n(7.2 per million to 2.9 per million, respectively). Similarly, The Washington Post recently\nstated, \"When adjusted by population, [unarmed Black men] were seven times as likely as\nunarmed White men to die from police gunfire\" (Lowery, 2016). We caution against using\npopulation as a benchmark because it does not account for each groups' representation in a\nvariety of more relevant measures, including police\u00adcivilian interactions and crime. The use\nof self-report data in criminological research has resulted in the finding that Black citizens\noffend at higher rates (Blumstein, Cohen, Roth, and Visher, 1986; Loeber et al., 2015)\nand are overrepresented in citizen complaints/calls for service (Engel, Smith, and Cullen,\n2012), police stops (Novak, 2004), and arrests (Brame, Bushway, Paternoster, and Turner,\n2014; Kochel, Wilson, and Mastrofski, 2011). These and related benchmarks can be used\nto clarify the representation of minority deaths at the hands of police.\nTo this point, we echo the sentiments of scholars who have argued that a national use-\nKlinger et al., 2015). Not just force that has resulted in death, which is what The Post\nand The Guardian have provided, but all use-of-force incidents. Collecting these data would\ncontribute to a more informed discussion about whether the police disproportionately use\nforce against minorities in all contexts. Recently, the FBI announced that it will begin\ncompiling data similar to The Post and The Guardian databases, but we argue it should take\nthe next step and track all use-of-force incidents. Furthermore, the FBI should not only\ncollect offender characteristics but officer characteristics as well (e.g., race, age, gender, rank,\neducation, and complaint history). Yet agencies have historically been reluctant to make\ntheir use-of-force data public, despite criminologists imploring them to do so for decades.\nPerhaps police leaders and politicians are concerned about the backlash that could result if\ntheir data uncover evidence of bias or excessive force. Whatever the case may be, the federal\ngovernment may need to provide funding incentives to increase participation. Without more\ncomprehensive data, we simply cannot determine whether the police disproportionately use\nforce against minorities on a national scale.\nAlthough we were limited to the 990 police shootings that resulted in death, we were\nable to analyze the data for evidence of implicit bias. Our findings showed that citizens in\nthe other racial/ethnic group were significantly more likely than Whites to have not been\nattacking the officer(s) or other civilians and that Blacks were more than twice as likely as\n328 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\nWhites to have been unarmed when they were shot and killed by police. These findings\nsuggest evidence of implicit bias in real-world scenarios. In line with previous police shooting\nofficers may have been more likely to experience threat perception failures in fatal shootings\nthat involved minority civilians. That is, officers subconsciously perceived minority civilians\nto have been a greater threat than they were (Fachner and Carter, 2015).\nOur results have several relevant implications for policy and practice (for excellent\nreviews, see Fridell, 2016; James, Fridell, and Straub, 2016; Spencer, Charbonneau, and\nGlaser, 2016). Although it might seem difficult or even impossible to overcome prejudices\nthat operate on a subconscious level, agencies can potentially reduce bias in several different\nways, including, for example, intergroup contact (Allport, 1954). Reducing bias through\ncontact requires that groups cooperate; have equal status and similar goals; and have the\nsupport of authorities, laws, or customs. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006), in a recent meta-\nanalysis, provided strong evidence that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice--94% of\nthe 696 samples they examined showed \"an inverse relationship between intergroup contact\nand prejudice\" (p. 766). Thus, police agencies might regularly sponsor activities that put the\npolice in direct, positive contact with citizens, such as citizen\u00adpolice softball tournaments or\nneighborhood block parties, which would permit officers to interact with minority citizens\nin an informal atmosphere. Alpert and Dunham (1998) suggested such a program, called\nNeighborhood Intervention and Community Evaluation (Miami NICE), in the late 1980s\nto help heal the wounds from civil disturbances (see also Duda, Klofas, and Drake, 2011).\nCommunity policing activities such as these are often viewed as a means of increasing\ncitizen satisfaction, yet they have the added benefit of exposing officers to citizens not\nengaged in deviance. Relatedly, bias can be reduced via exposure to counter-stereotypic\nexemplars. Park and Glaser (2011), for example, found that after officers performed a\nmodified shooting simulation that involved more armed White targets and unarmed Black\ntargets, they demonstrated less bias on subsequent simulations. Finally, agencies could\nconsider having their officers practice stereotype negation, which simply involves saying\n\"no\" in response to words or phrases consistent with racial stereotypes (e.g., \"Black citizens\nare dangerous\") and \"yes\" to words or phrases inconsistent with racial stereotypes (Kawakami,\nDovidio, Moll, Hermsen, and Russin, 2000).\nAgencies would also be wise to implement procedural justice training for their officers\nas researchers have consistently demonstrated that procedural justice is key to establishing\ntrust and legitimacy in the eyes of the public (see, e.g., Jackson, Bradford, Stanko, and Hohl,\nRojek, 2016). When citizens view the police as a legitimate authority, they are more likely\nto exhibit compliant behaviors (Murphy, Tyler, and Curtis, 2009; Papachristos, Meares, and\nFagan, 2012), cooperate (Jackson et al., 2012), and accept police decisions in both the short\n(Tyler and Huo, 2002) and the long term (Tyler, Sherman, Strang, Barnes, and Woods,\n2007). Every police\u00adcitizen interaction represents a teachable moment for both parties,\nResearch Article Civilians Killed by Police\nwhereby citizens will judge how fairly they have been treated and officers will interpret\ncitizens' responses to their actions (Bottoms and Tankebe, 2012; Tyler, 2011). Thus, it is\nimperative that the police emphasize procedural justice at every possible juncture. Indeed,\nmany situations that escalate into the use of deadly force could perhaps be defused through\nprocedural justice. For example, Owens, Weisburd, Alpert, and Amendola (2016) recently\nconducted an experiment in which they successfully implemented a low-cost procedural\njustice\u00adcentered training of officers in Seattle. Results indicated that trained officers were\nless likely to resolve incidents with arrest or force. Other results from research carried out in\nGreater Manchester suggested that officers who received procedural justice training reported\nmore favorable attitudes toward using procedural justice in the field and subsequently had\nimproved interactions with citizens (Wheller, Quinton, Fildes, and Mills, 2013). It is\nfeasible that increased usage of procedural justice in the field could reduce the number of\nfatal encounters between officers and the public in the long term.\nDepartments could also benefit from adopting body-worn cameras (BWCs; Jennings,\nFridell, and Lynch, 2014; Katz, Choate, Ready, and Nu\ntransparency and legitimacy in the public eye, with some researchers suggesting that officers\nbelieve BWCs would improve their interactions with civilians (see Jennings et al., 2014).\nIndeed, by using a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Rialto Police Department,\nresearchers demonstrated that officers wearing BWCs were less likely to use force against\ncitizens and less likely to have complaints filed against them than were officers not equipped\nwith BWCs (Ariel, Farrar, and Sutherland, 2015). Body-worn camera footage furthermore\naffords police agencies the opportunity to tell their side of the story after use-of-force\nincidents and review cases when complaints are lodged by citizens. As such, BWCs could\naid in the development and maintenance of early warning systems meant to flag problematic\nbehavior by officers (Walker, Alpert, and Kenney, 2000). Although there are certainly barriers\nto outfitting officers with BWCs, not the least of which are the costs associated with storing\nvideo footage and the fact that the footage is often limited, police leaders may find them a\nhelpful tool in reducing/removing bias from within their ranks.\nLimitations\nThis study is not without limitations. Most importantly, we only had data for the 990\npolice shooting incidents that resulted in death. It would be ideal to have national data on\nuse-of-force incidents that did not result in death as well, as prior studies have suggested\nthat civilian death only occurs in 15% to 25% of all police shootings (see, e.g., Klinger\net al., 2015). With these data, we could more accurately assess whether deadly force is\ndisproportionately used against Blacks, and we could more accurately determine whether\nimplicit bias occurs in real-world police\u00adcivilian interactions. Additionally, we were only\nable to analyze data for a 1-year period. Future research would benefit from longitudinal data\nto assess police shooting trends over longer periods. This is especially important considering\nthat 2015 was a period of great turmoil in American policing and might prove to be an\n330 Criminology & Public Policy\nNix et al.\noutlier over a more extended timeframe. Note, however, that Williams et al. (2016) recently\nsuggested that annual totals of fatal police shootings have remained stable over the last 5\nyears. In any event, given the national debate currently surrounding police shootings, it\nwas imperative to analyze the first year of The Post's data objectively to shed light on any\napparent racial disparities. Finally, although we were able to control for the influence of\nseveral relevant variables, we could not account for everything as evidenced by the modest\namount of variance explained by our regression models. For example, suspect death can\nbe influenced by factors such as departmental policy on rendering lifesaving aid or the\nproximity of level-one trauma centers (Giacopassi, Sparger, and Stein, 1992; Hanke and\nGundlach, 1995; MacKenzie et al., 2006). Yet without national data on nonfatal police\nshootings, we cannot determine whether the observed race effects would be washed away\nby the inclusion of these other variables.\nConclusion\nOur analysis has contributed to an understanding of the extent to which civilians were\nfatally shot and killed by police in the U.S. in 2015, as well as to an understanding of\nthe extent to which race was associated with two measures of threat perception failure:\nhaving not been attacking the police or other citizens and having been unarmed prior to\nbeing fatally shot. Flawed data have limited the empirical study of police deadly use of\nforce at the national level for far too long. News media outlets have provided us with\nmore accurate data on these incidents than has the research community. Nevertheless,\nmore is needed to provide reliable and generalizable analyses of police-involved shootings.\nFortunately, it seems that we are making steps in the right direction, and this study and the\ndata from The Washington Post serve as baseline analyses for future research on civilians killed\nby police.\nReferences\nAdams, Kenneth,  , Roger G.
