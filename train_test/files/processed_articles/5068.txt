The combination of\nhigh-dose telmisartan (80 mg/day) and hydrochlorothi-\nazide (HCTZ, 12.5 mg/day) (Micombi\u00aeBP) has the strong-\nest BP-lowering effect.5 We previously used a changeover\ndesign in which the patients were switched from high-dose\nARBs or a combination of medium-dose losartan (50 mg/\nday) and HCTZ to high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ.6\nAlthough we found that high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ\ninduced a significant reduction of BP at three months after\nchangeover, the combination therapy resulted in a\nEfficacy and safety of combination\ntherapy of high-dose losartan and\nhydrochlorothiazide in patients\nwith hypertension\nKuwano1, Yoshinari Uehara1,6, Asao Inoue2, Tetsuro Shirotani3,\nKazuaki Fujisawa4, Eiyu Matsunaga5 and Keijiro Saku1,6\n Keywords\nBlood pressure, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, uric acid\n1Department of Cardiology, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Japan\n2Inoue Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan\n3Shirotani Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan\n4Fujisawa Clinic, Fukuoka, Japan\n5Matsunaga Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan\n6Department of Molecular Cardiovascular Therapeutics, Fukuoka\nUniversity School of Medicine, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nShin-ichiro Miura, Department of Cardiology, Fukuoka University School\nEmail: miuras@cis.fukuoka-u.ac.jp\nOriginal Article\nsignificant increase in serum uric acid (UA). In particular,\nan elevation of serum UA was observed in patients who\nwere switched from a combination of medium-dose losar-\ntan and HCTZ to high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ.\nIt is still controversial whether a higher level of serum\nUA is a risk factor for arteriosclerosis and coronary artery\ndisease.Although a relationship between serum UAand car-\ndiovascular events was not observed in the Framingham\nstudy,7 such relationships have been demonstrated in some\nstudies.8,9 Moreover, in a subanalysis of data from the\nJapanese CoronaryArtery Disease Study, a high level of UA\nwas shown to be an independent predictor of all events,\nincluding cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.10 In\na prospective, randomized trial, allopurinol was shown to\ndecrease C-reactive protein and reduce cardiovascular and\nhospitalization risk in patients with estimated GFR (eGFR)\n<60 ml/min.11 AmongARBs, although both losartan and tel-\nmisartan significantly blocked urate transporter 1 (URAT1)\nin in vitro experiments,12,13 only losartan showed uricosuric\naction through the inhibition of URAT1 in humans.14\nWe hypothesized that a combination of high-dose losar-\ntan and HCTZ could produce similar reduction in BP and\nsignificant decrease in serum UA compared with a combi-\nnation of high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ. Therefore, we\nanalyzed whether a changeover with switching from a\ncombination of high-dose telmisartan and HCTZ to high-\ndose losartan (100 mg/day) and HCTZ would be more effi-\ncacious and safe for hypertensive patients.\nMethods\nStudy design\nForty hypertensive patients who received a combination of\nhigh-dose telmisartan and HCTZ were enrolled. We\napplied a changeover strategy with switching from\nMicombi\u00aeBP (a single-pill fixed-dose combination of\ntelmisartan (80 mg/day) and HCTZ (12.5 mg/day)) to\nPreminent\u00ae (a single-pill fixed-dose combination of\nlosartan (50 mg/day) and HCTZ (12.5 mg/day)) + losar-\ntan (50 mg/day). Twenty-four patients (60%) received\nMicombi\u00aeBP in the morning and the rest of patients (40%)\nreceived it in the evening. After changeover, we did not\nchange the administration time in all patients.\nWe divided the patients into two groups: those who\nachieved the target BP (controlled group) and those who\ndid not reach the target BP (uncontrolled group) before the\nchangeover, and performed further analysis according to\nthe Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines 2009.1\nWe excluded patients with secondary hypertension, heart\nfailure of NYHA grade III or IV, moderate to severe liver\ndysfunction (defined as aspartate aminotransferase and\nalanine aminotransferase levels of more than three-fold the\nnormal ranges), renal dysfunction (defined as a serum cre-\natinine (Cr) level of more than 2.0 mg/dl), pregnancy, or a\nhistory of allergy to losartan. The protocol in this study\nwas approved by the ethics committee of Fukuoka\nUniversity Hospital, and all subjects gave their informed\nconsent to participate.\nEvaluation of clinical parameters\nWe analyzed seated office systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP\n(DBP) and pulse rate (PR), body weight (BW), and blood\nand urinary levels of biochemical parameters at baseline\nand at three months after changeover. BP was determined\nas the mean of two measurements obtained in an office\nsetting by the conventional cuff method using a mercury\nsphygmomanometer after at least 5 min of rest. All of the\nblood and urinary samples were collected in the morning\nafter the patients had fasted overnight. Data regarding\nserum levels of biochemical parameters, such as high-\ndensity lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density\nlipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), UA,\nCr, eGFR, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), fasting blood\nglucose (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), sodium (Na),\npotassium (K), albumin (Alb), urinary (U)-UA, U-Cr, the\nratio of U-UA to U-Cr (U-UA/U-Cr), and the fractional\nexcretion of UA (FEUA, U-UA \u00d7 serum Cr/serum UA \u00d7\nU-Cr) were collected in all patients. Body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2.\nThe characteristics of the patients, with regard to his-\ntory of dyslipidemia (DL), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyper-\nuricemia (HU), smoking status and medication use, were\nobtained from medical records. Patients who had a current\npertensive therapy were considered to have hypertension.\nHDL-C < 40 mg/dl, or who were receiving lipid-lowering\ntherapy were considered to have DL. DM was defined\nusing the American Diabetes Association criteria or the\nuse of a glucose-lowering drug. HU was defined as a\nTable 1.

The significance\nof differences between mean values was evaluated by\npaired and unpaired t-tests or one-way analysis of variance\nfollowed by Fisher's protected-least-significant-difference\ntest, as appropriate.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nTable 2 shows the characteristics of the 40 patients, who\nincluded nine (23%) males. No patients withdrew from the\nstudy. The prevalence of DL, DM, HU and CKD was 63%,\nuse of calcium channel blocker (CCB), -blocker and\nno significant differences in the baseline patient characteris-\ntics between the controlled and uncontrolled groups. We did\nnot change these medications throughout the study period.\nChanges in BP and PR\nIn all patients, SBP/DBP and PR at baseline were\nmmHg at baseline to 119\u00b113 at three months after change-\nover in all subjects. In particular, the uncontrolled group\nshowed a significant decrease in SBP (143\u00b112 mmHg to\n126\u00b111 mmHg at three months). There were no significant\nchanges in DBP or PR during the study period.\nChanges in biochemical parameters\nAs shown in Table 3, there were no significant changes in\nbiochemical parameters such as serum blood urea nitrogen\n(BUN), Cr, K, HbA1c, BNP and lipid profile in all sub-\njects, or in the controlled and uncontrolled groups.\nChanges in serum UA, U-UA/U-Cr and FEUA\nin all subjects, and in the controlled and\nuncontrolled groups\nThe combination of high-dose losartan and HTCZ signifi-\ncantly decreased serum UA after three months in all sub-\njects, and in the controlled and uncontrolled groups (Figure\n2), whereas there were no changes in U-UA/U-Cr or FEUA\nin all subjects, or in the controlled and uncontrolled groups\n(Table 3).\nChanges in serum UA, K and HbA1c between\nsub-groups\nThe normal UA, K and HbA1c values at our University\nrespectively.

In the relatively low and high UA groups, their\nvalues at three months were significantly less than those at\nbaseline (Figure 3).

For example, a 2 mmHg reduction in SBP\nshould provide a 10% lower incidence of stroke mortal-\nity and about a 7% lower incidence of mortality from\ncoronary artery disease or other vascular causes in mid-\nThe synergistic effect of the combination of high-dose\nlosartan and HTCZ may be stronger than that with high-\ndose telmisartan and HTCZ. In a previous study, 12.5\nmg/day of HCTZ significantly increased plasma renin\nactivity (PRA).16 In this case, the blockade of the activa-\ntion of PRA induced by HTCZ with high-dose losartan\nmay be stronger than that with high-dose telmisartan.\nSince the combination of medium-dose losartan (50 mg/\nday) and HTCZ had the same depressor effect as that of\nmedium-dose telmisartan (40 mg/day) and HCTZ,17 we\ndid not expect that a changeover from high-dose tel-\nmisartan and HTCZ to high-dose losartan and HTCZ\nwould be a useful strategy for inducing a more significant\nreduction in SBP.\nIn this study, high-dose losartan and HTCZ signifi-\ncantly decreased serum UA after a switch from high-dose\ntelmisartan and HCTZ. Losartan has been shown to have\nuricosuric action via URAT1 in hypertensive patients.14\nHamada et al. reported that losartan and HCTZ increased\nthe ratio of UA clearance to creatinine clearance (CUA/\nCcr) in patients with a serum UA above 5.5 mg/dl,\nwhereas telmisartan and HCTZ significantly reduced\nCUA/Ccr.17 Unexpectedly, U-UA/U-Cr and FEUA did\nnot change after the changeover to high-dose losartan and\nHTCZ. The classification of HU into one of two types\n(i.e. the overproduction of UA or a decrease in the uri-\nnary excretion of UA) based on a 60-min spot urine or\n24-h urine collection in outpatients is important for deter-\nmining the treatment strategy,18 but there are no standard-\nized methods available. Thus, further studies will be\nneeded to resolve this issue.\nBenson et al. indicated that telmisartan activated per-\noxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-, which\nmay improve insulin sensitivity,19 whereas losartan did not\nactivate PPAR-.20 Telmisartan may be useful in hyperten-\nsive patients with insulin resistance or DM.21 Nonetheless,\nin this study, the levels of HbA1c and FBS did not change\nat three months after a changeover from high-dose tel-\nmisartan and HTCZ to high-dose losartan and HTCZ.\nTelmisartan-induced activation of PPAR- may not be\nclinically important in this study, and this result was con-\nsistent with a previous report.22\nZillich et al. reported that the treatment of thiazide-\ninduced hypokalemia might reverse glucose intolerance.23\nAlthough the level of K at three months after changeover\nwas significantly decreased in the relatively high K group,\nthe average value (K=4.3 mEq/l at three months) was still\nwithin the normal range and was clinically ignorable.\nTherefore, the level of K may not influence glucose\nintolerance.\nStudy limitations\nThis study has three important limitations. First, the sam-\nple size is relatively small, which limits our ability to\ndetermine significance. Second, we applied a changeover\nwith switching from high-dose telmisartan and HTCZ to\nhigh-dose losartan and HTCZ. However, a crossover study\nwould be preferable. Third, we applied a changeover strat-\negy with switching from one tablet (Micombi\u00aeBP) to two\ntablets (Preminent\u00ae + losartan). Twenty-four patients\nreceived Micombi\u00aeBP in the morning and the rest of\npatients received it in the evening before changeover,\nwhereas we did not change the administration time in all\npatients after changeover. The numbers of tablets and\nadministration time may affect drug adherence and BP\nlowering effects.\nConclusions\nThe combination of high-dose losartan and HTCZ signifi-\ncantly reduced SBP and decreased serum UA after three\nmonths.
