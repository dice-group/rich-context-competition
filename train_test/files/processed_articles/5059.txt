A\nsingle investigator (A.G.) with no access to\nthe patients analysed all data using anon-\nymised database registries.\nPatients were stratified according to body\nm2). Clinical efficacy was defined as a reduc-\ntion in mean psoriasis area severity index\n(PASI) during treatment. Patients provided\nwritten informed consent prior to treatment.\nEthical approval was not required due to the\nretrospective nature of the study.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n\nof patients, and compared using last-obser-\nvation-carried-forward (LOCF) analysis\nwith Statistics software, version W1.59\n(Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford,\nUK). A two-tailed P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe medical records of 300 consecutive\npatients were evaluated, 66 of whom fulfilled\nthe inclusion criteria. The demographic and\nclinical characteristics of these 66 patients\nare shown in Table 1. There were no\nTable 1.

A\nhigh BMI has been shown to be a potential\npredictor of anti-TNF-a drug discontinu-\nation.6 The literature regarding the effect of\nweight/BMI on efficacy is limited: one study\nhad an inadequate sample size,3 others had a\nshort duration (24 weeks),2,7 and another\nstratified patients into two groups only\nmajority of studies have focused on body\nTable 2.
