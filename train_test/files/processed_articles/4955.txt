    "abstract": "Abstract\nFew studies have explored the expressed support needs of suicide attempters in developing countries. Data, collected via\nin-depth interviews with suicide attempters admitted to a South African hospital, were analysed using thematic content\nanalysis. Participants explicitly asked for integrated psycho-social services at a primary health care level and say they\nrequire assistance with alleviating psychiatric symptoms, establishing connectedness, interpersonal conflict and solving\nsocio-economic problems. Findings highlight the importance for suicide prevention of (1) considering interpersonal\nand contextual socio-economic factors in addition to the psychiatric causes of suicidal behaviour; and (2) multilevel\nstrategies, intersectoral collaboration and integrated person-centred primary health care.\n",

Integral to sui-\ncide prevention is the provision of appropriate care to suicide\nattempters; nonfatal suicidal behaviour carries a high risk of\nrepetition and is associated with suicide. The dominant bio-\nmedical view asserts that suicidal behaviour is a symptom of\npsychopathology and that the treatment of psychiatric illness\nis the cornerstone of suicide prevention (Marsh, 2010). This\npsychiatric view of suicide has been critiqued within the field\nof critical suicidology for its failure to take account of the\ncontextual, socio-cultural, economic and historic factors\nwhich contribute to the aetiology of suicidal behaviour\nsuicidology has attracted criticism for failing to document the\ninsider perspectives of suicide attempters (Hjelmeland and\nexpressed support needs of suicide attempters, particularly in\nLMICs. It is within this context that I set out to document the\nexpressed support needs of a group of patients admitted to an\nurban hospital in South Africa (SA) following a medically\nserious suicide attempt. My intention was to understand from\nthe patient's point of view what might be done on discharge\nfrom hospital to reduce the risk of repetition of suicidal\nbehaviour. The findings are discussed within the context of\ncalls from critical suicidologists to focus on the socio-cultural\ncontext of suicide, and the challenges of suicide prevention in\nLMICs, like SA.1 The findings provide insight into possible\nsuicide prevention strategies and highlight structural prob-\nlems with the provision of mental health care in low-resource\nenvironments.\nLiterature review\nglobally (WHO, 2014) and for every completed suicide\n`Don't push me aside, Doctor':\nSuicide attempters talk about their\nsupport needs, service delivery\nand suicide prevention in South Africa\nJason Bantjes\n Keywords\nattempted suicide, critical health psychology, health care systems, South Africa, suicide, suicide prevention\nStellenbosch University, South Africa\nCorresponding author:\nJason Bantjes, Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University,\nPrivate Bag X1, Matieland, 7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa.\nEmail: jbantjes@sun.ac.za\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nthere are an estimated 20\u00ad30 suicide attempts (Wasserman,\n2016). A suicide attempt is defined as, `A nonhabitual act\nwith nonfatal outcome that the individual, expecting to, or\ntaking the risk to die or to inflict bodily harm, initiated and\ncarried out with the purpose of bringing about wanted\nsuicide are at high risk of repetition and are 20\u00ad30\ntimes\nmore likely than the general population to die by suicide\n2002). Suicide attempters who present at hospitals are a\nwell-delineated group of patients who may be amenable to\ntargeted interventions to reduce their suicide risk (Arensman\net al., 2011). It is, however, not always clear what interven-\ntions are effective to prevent suicides (Brown and Jager-\nthe ineffectiveness of suicide prevention strategies is in\nlarge part a result of the fact that suicide has predominantly\nbeen conceptualised within a biomedical risk-factor para-\ndigm; consequently, much of the research has been quanti-\ntative, de-contextual and narrowly focused on a handful of\nindividual variables and psychiatric factors (Hjelmeland\nEvidence of this is seen in a recently published meta-analy-\nsis which concluded that in spite of decades of quantitative\nrisk factor suicide research, experts' ability to identify\npatients who will engage in suicidal behaviour is no better\nthan chance and has not improved significantly in the last\nTypically, suicide prevention strategies have focused on\nidentifying psychiatric risk factors and promoting access to\npsychiatric care for at-risk individuals. For example, the\nfour-level approach to suicide prevention, advocated by the\nEuropean Alliance Against Depression, focuses on educat-\ning primary health care professionals and the general popu-\nlation about psychiatric risk factors for suicide, and\nincreasing access to appropriate psychiatric care for at-risk\nindividuals (Sz\u00e9kely et al., 2013). A systematic review of\npsychological autopsy studies concluded that `Suicide pre-\nvention strategies may be most effective if focused on the\nCritical suicidologists have pointed out the problems of\nfocusing solely on psychiatric risk factors while failing to\nconsider the socio-cultural context within which suicidal\nbehaviours occur (Hjelmeland et al., 2014). These critiques\nhave spurned a number of studies which have attempted to\nexamine more broadly the role of contextual factors in the\naetiology of suicide. Examples include the systematic\nreview on the relationship between poverty and suicidal\nbehaviour in LMICs (Iemmi et al., 2016) and a study among\nperinatal women living in a low-resource environment in\nSA which found that socio-economic adversity was a better\npredictor of suicidal behaviour than psychiatric conditions\nAuthors have drawn attention to the role of the socio-\ncultural context in suicidal behaviour (Chan and Thambu,\n2016). There are, for example, studies which have described\nhow suicidal behaviour in different parts of the world is\nshaped by models of hegemonic masculinity and prescrip-\nDervic et al., 2004), and attitudes towards suicide and help\nseeking (Reynders et al., 2014). This renewed interest in\nsocio-cultural context has led some authors to question the\nrole of mental illness in precipitating suicidal behaviour.\nHjelmeland et al. (2014) have gone so far as to assert that\n`suicide is about far more than mental disorders, and may\nbe about something quite different' (p. 1370). There are\ngood reasons to consider a wide range of contextual, socio-\ncultural and economic factors when planning suicide pre-\nvention interventions, particularly in low-resource\nenvironments. In many LMICs, psychiatric resources are\nscarce and consequently suicide prevention efforts that rely\nprimarily on mental health professionals are unlikely to\nhave the requisite reach to be effective.\npotential benefits of investigating first-person accounts of\nthe lived experiences of suicidal persons. White (2016) has\naffirmed that `those with lived experience of suicidality\nhave invaluable insights to contribute to the current evi-\ndence base' (p. 349). Documenting the voices of suicide\nattempters may help to highlight the social context in which\nsuicidal behaviour occurs and to draw attention to factors,\nsuch as culture, which are not easily measured and included\nin quantitative studies. Qualitative studies in this field not\nonly hold the promise of providing insight into the suicidal\nmind but, perhaps more importantly, can tell us what it is\nlike to be a suicidal person negotiating one's way through\nthe health care system (Bantjes and Swartz, 2017).\nFurthermore, qualitative studies with suicide attempters\nmay provide insight into the support needs of this group of\npatients and highlight problems with the organisation of\ncare within the health care system which impede suicide\nprevention. Although this is a largely unexplored area of\nresearch in LMICs, in the last 10years, there has been a bur-\ngeoning of research from high-income western countries\nwhich describes the lived experiences of suicide attempters\n(White, 2016). One of the earliest studies exploring the lived\nexperience of suicidal individuals was undertaken by Rosen\n(1975), who interviewed seven individuals who had jumped\nfrom the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in suicide\nattempts. On the basis of these qualitative interviews, Rosen\n(1975) suggested concrete strategies for suicide prevention.\nThis has established a tradition of employing qualitative\nresearch with suicide attempters in order to generate evi-\ndence for suicide prevention. On the basis of her review of\nqualitative studies on suicide ideation, attempts, and suicide\nprevention, White (2016) concluded, `Far from providing a\ndefinitive statement about the nature and meaning of suici-\ndality, these studies have shown the complex, dynamic,\ncontext-dependent, multiple, and contradictory character of\nsuicide ideation and attempts' (p. 349).\nMethodology\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 80 adult\npatients (46 females and 34 males) admitted to an urban\nhospital, following a suicide attempt. Participants were\nminutes and were\nconducted by the author, who is a psychologist. Participants\nwere asked to recount how they had come to be in hospital\nand to describe what they thought they might need to pre-\nvent future episodes of suicidal behaviour. Participants were\nprompted to talk about the socio-cultural context in which\ntheir suicide attempt occurred and to express their own\nunderstanding of their behaviour. Interviews were con-\nducted in a private space within the hospital prior to patients'\ndischarge. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.\nData were analysed independently by two researchers using\nthematic content analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). An\ninductive approach (Thomas, 2006) was adopted to code the\ndata using Atlas-ti software. Theoretical sense was made of\nthe findings after a process of triangulation of codes. This\ndata-driven process led to the identification of five superor-\ndinate themes which describe patients' expressed support\nneeds, namely (1) alleviation of psychiatric and somatic\nsymptoms, (2) access to integrated psychological care at a\nprimary health care level, (3) help to establish connected-\nness and belonging, (4) assistance with interpersonal and\nfamily conflict and (5) practical help to solve situational\nproblems. The analysis of data for this article was confined\nto identify expressed support needs, a more detailed account\nof the patients' first-person understanding of the socio-cul-\ntural context in which their suicide attempt occurred and the\ncontextual factors that contributed to this behaviour will be\npresented in subsequent publications.\nEthics\nPermission to conduct this study was obtained from the\nhealth science research ethics committees at the University\nof Cape Town and Stellenbosch University. Institutional\npermission was obtained from the relevant authorities at the\nhospital and participants gave written informed consent to\nparticipate in the study. Pseudonyms have been used to pro-\ntect the identity of the participants.\nFindings\nAlleviation of psychiatric and somatic symptoms\nMany participants asked for assistance with the alleviation\nof psychiatric and somatic symptoms. They ascribed their\nsuicide attempts to behavioural, cognitive and emotional\nsymptoms which they described as unbearable. Cleo said,\n`I just need to be back on my medication. That is very\nimportant'. Nancy said that she needed professional help to\ncontrol her feelings and thoughts because `... there is no\nway out of it and I feel like I'm drowning in everything that\nis happening in my mind'. Similarly, Jaco said,\nI just don't want to feel this way. I will get any help I can to\ntake it (these feelings) off my mind ... I don't know why I\ncan't get healed of this inner pain. It draws me to suicide every\ntime.\nWhile some patients described symptoms of depressive\nand anxiety disorders which they said contributed to their\nattempted suicide, there were other patients who spoke\nabout the role of trauma and loss. These patients asked for\nhelp with symptoms such as re-experiencing the trauma,\nhigh levels of fear, hyper vigilance and panic. Tim explained\nhow he had been repeatedly sexually abused when he was\ngrowing up and how the trauma of this had left him with\nunbearable memories and high levels of anxiety and mis-\ntrust, with which he needed help. Similarly, participants\ndescribed complicated grief reactions to recent losses. Jane,\nan 18-year-old school girl, described how her mother had\nrecently died, leaving her alone and without financial or\nfamily support to look after her young sister. She said she\nwas overcome with sadness at her mother's death but had\nno way to process this grief because she was left unsup-\nported and responsible for her sister.\nSome participants described symptoms of psychotic ill-\nness, including persecutory and command hallucinations,\nwhich they said contributed to their suicidal behaviour.\nThese participants said they required help with `the voices'\nand `the crazy thoughts inside my head'. Vuyo expressed\nthis by saying, `... maybe I can put this pain to bed and\nmaybe just stop hearing everything that they (the voices)\nare saying about me, because I am tired of it'.\nParticipants also described the role of chronic pain in\ntheir suicide attempt and said they would require help\nwith this. David said, `I need to be comfortable (free of\npain) at least'.\nParticipants expressed a need for sustained psychiatric\ncare within a supportive environment. Some patients\ndescribed their previous experience of receiving care, say-\ning that they had felt rushed and pushed aside by mental\nhealth service providers. Nina described the kind of care\nshe required saying,\nDon't rush me when I tell you, Doctor, this is what I've been\nthrough \u00ad I was raped or whatever. Don't push me aside,\nDoctor, because then I don't feel open enough to speak to you.\nThen I just close up.\nAccess to integrated psychological care at a\nprimary health care level\nParticipants articulated a need for psychotherapy and emo-\ntional support. They said they did not have access to ongoing\n4 Health Psychology Open \npsychological care in their communities. They requested\npsycho-social support to be integrated into existing primary\nhealth care settings. Ivan explained, `... they should actually\nhave community day-hospitals where they can have counsel-\nlors to help us if you feel down, besides sisters. We see sisters\nmaybe once a month. But we need to have counsellors on\nstandby for us'. Similarly, Jannie said, `... if I can just go into\ntherapy where it can help for at least a few months. The sup-\nport and the fact of professional help, it will be much easier\nfor me ...'\nSome participants asked for assistance to develop insight\ninto their emotions, change their behaviour and regulate\ntheir feelings. Anita said, `But the thing is, how do I change\nmy behaviour from having the same negative feelings go\naround and around and around in my head? How does that\nchange? How can I stop that from happening?' Likewise,\nBongani said, `I'd like to understand what triggers my\nmood. Like specially when my mood goes down \u00ad what\ntriggers it? And to learn methods of better managing when\nI lose focus and when my mind starts going ballistic'.\nHelp to establish relationships, connection and\nbelonging\nMany participants were emphatic about their need for help\nto establish connection and emotional closeness to others.\nThey expressed a desire for emotionally supportive rela-\ntionships. Anne said she needed `people to be there for me'\nin order to curb future suicidal behaviour. Anton said it\nwould help him if he was `not so alone' and if `people actu-\nally listen to you and talk to you and pay attention to you'.\nAnton went on to describe the power of physical and emo-\ntional closeness to curb his suicidal behaviour by saying,\n`That's what I always tell my girlfriend, the only thing that\ncan help me is if she just comes and holds me and tells me\nthat she loves me. I know for sure that that will help me'.\nSome participants described how their suicide attempts\nhad been precipitated by a sense of disconnection and `not\nbelonging'. Jane said, `I'm just like faulty, I just don't\nbelong here. I don't belong here'.\nSome participants said they needed help to establish\nsupportive and trusting relationships. Andile articulated\nthis by saying he needed to `meet people that are in my situ-\nation. Maybe we can support one another and help and talk\nto one another openly, instead of getting that pushing down\nfrom people'. Colin echoed this saying,\nDoctor, like I say, (I need) people I can talk to, just for one\nminute or two minutes or whatever for a day. People I can talk\nto who say, listen here, we are interested in helping you. We\nare genuinely interested to help you.\nSimilarly, Sally said, `I need a person that I can trust to\nspeak to, and help me through the difficult times that I'm\nfacing'.\nParticipants acknowledged that they needed help with\nestablishing intimacy, and finding connection. Liz said,\nIt's like nobody is around. I can't get close to somebody. I tried\nso much. I even took a husband, got married and had a child,\nbut I can't be close to somebody. I'm so far away from my\nchild as well. I can't get closer to somebody.\nParticipants said that they needed to learn how to com-\nmunicate their distress to others and how to ask for help in\nadaptive ways. Anthea described her experience saying,\n`... it feels like you're alone. No one worries about your\nproblems. If you speak, and try to explain, people do not\nrealise that you are calling out for help'. She said she would\nneed help to communicate her distress in order to ensure\nthat she did not hurt herself again as a way of accessing\nsupport and care.\nAssistance with resolving interpersonal and\nfamily conflict\nParticipants expressed a need for help to resolve interper-\nsonal difficulties and conflicted family relationships. Tanya\nsaid, `I need to sort out my relationship with my family'.\nNeil said,\nThe support I will need, if Doctor can phone my family and\nexplain to them that it's not to do with money or anything like\nthat. I just want them to support me where if I've got something\nto tell them, you know, don't turn their backs towards me ...\nSome participants also asked for help with communicating\ntheir needs to their family. Nigel said,\nMy family also supports me, but I would like them to also\nsupport me where \u00ad it's like if I go, at least come with me once\na month to the psychiatric sister or to the doctor and ask how\nam I doing. You know, things like that, which they don't do.\nParticipants described difficult family circumstances\nand identified family relationships as significant stressors\nwhich contributed to their suicide attempt. Nancy said,\n`Sometimes I wish I wasn't born into this family'.\nParticipants said that they needed help to achieve independ-\nence from their families and expressed a desire for libera-\ntion. Chris said, `I'm getting tired of living with my family.\nThat's what I want, I want to get my own place'. Fatima\nsaid, `And I really do want to be independent \u00ad I don't want\nto have to ask my family and people for stuff'.\nHelp to solve situational problems\nParticipants expressed a need for practical help to solve con-\ncrete situational problems such as finding employment,\nresolving a financial or legal crisis and finding a place to\nstay. Economic hardship and unemployment were identified\nas significant stressors which contributed to participants'\nsuicidal behaviour; they said they would need relief from\nthis burden. Jack said, `But a lot of it boils down to money',\nand Frans said, `I also want to have my own business. I need\nto make some money'. Participants expressed a belief that if\nthey had access to financial resources they would feel liber-\nated from and more in control of the situation that had pre-\ncipitated their suicidal crisis. Sabu explained, `I think what\nwill help me is a better job to get out of that harshness. I'm\napplying for jobs. I think that's one big obstacle ...'.\nSimilarly, Mark said,\nLike if I had won the jackpot, I could just have taken care of all\nthose worries ... I'm just saying if I was in a position where I\ncould at least have been in control, I don't believe that I would\nhave gotten to that stage (of wanting to die).\nMany participants said they needed help finding a place\nto live. Participants who were homeless described the hard-\nship of having no fixed abode and living on the street or in\na shelter. Other participants expressed a desire to find alter-\nnative accommodation because their current living arrange-\nments were stressful. Karin said, `If I had a home as well,\nan actual house where I could go ...', and Fred said, `I want\nto move out of the house (where I am staying now)'.\nDiscussion\nParticipants in this study are explicit in their request for\nongoing psychiatric and medical care, as part of a strategy\nto curb their own suicidal behaviour. This assertion seems\nto point to an implicit understanding that their behaviour\nwas at least in part a function of psychiatric and medical\nconditions which they believe doctors are equipped to alle-\nviate. It is possible that the primacy participants give to\nwhat is essentially a biomedical formulation of their own\nsuicidal behaviour, reflects something of the context in\nwhich the data for this study were collected. Interviews for\nthis study were conducted in a medical setting by a\nresearcher identified as a psychologist and with patients\nwho had been admitted to hospital and who had all received\nmedical and psychiatric care following their suicide\nattempt. It is plausible that the demand characteristics of\nthe situation in which the data were collected, the position-\ning of the data collector as a psychologist and the partici-\npants recent experience of receiving psychiatric and\nmedical care, all shaped how the participants narrated their\nsuicide attempt and framed what they expressed as their\nsupport needs. It is also possible that the participants in this\nstudy are simply reproducing the dominant biomedical\nview of suicidal behaviour as a symptom of mental illness\nbecause they believe this is what is expected of them and\nthey do not want to appear unsophisticated in their under-\nstanding of their own behaviour. Nonetheless, if we do as\nauthors such as Hjelmeland (2012) suggest, and we take\nseriously the insights and voices of the `true experts' on\nsuicide (i.e. suicide attempters) when seeking to understand\nsuicidal behaviour and plan interventions, then we have to\nacknowledge that many participants in this study explicitly\nattribute their suicide attempts to symptoms of mental ill-\nness and they ask for ongoing professional care to alleviate\nthese psychiatric symptoms.\nFrom the perspective of the participants in this study,\nappropriate, affordable, accessible, ongoing psychiatric\ncare is integral to suicide prevention. This finding is\nentirely consistent with the conclusions drawn in a review\nof systematic reviews on effective interventions for sui-\ncidal behaviour; the review concluded that best practice in\nsuicide prevention entails detecting and treating psycho-\npathology, principally depressive disorders (Van der\nFeltz-Cornelis et al., 2010). The focus on depression in\nthe international suicide prevention literature is notewor-\nthy, particularly since the participants in this study iden-\ntify needing help with symptoms of anxiety, psychotic\nillnesses, posttraumatic stress disorder, grief and pain dis-\norders. Participants' request for ongoing post-discharge\npsychiatric care is congruent with international best prac-\ntice literature. There is evidence that `professionals'main-\ntenance of long-term contact with patients at risk of\nsuicide can exert a suicide-prevention influence' (Motto\nParticipants' explicit request for ongoing psychiatric\nand psychological care for symptoms of psychopathol-\nogy and psychological distress calls into question the\nassertion by Hjelmeland et al. (2014) that mental illness\nand suicidal behaviour are unrelated and that suicide\nmay be `about something quite different' from mental\nillness (p. 1370). It is significant that suicide attempters\nin this study, all of whom live in resource-constrained\nenvironments, explicitly assert the importance of access\nto psychiatric care and ask for access to ongoing psychi-\natric treatment and integrated psychological support.\nThere is a real risk that claims made by authors such as\nHjelmeland et al. (2014) that suicidal behaviour is not a\nsymptom of mental illness will be taken up by policy\nmakers to undervalue or discredit the importance of pro-\nviding appropriate, accessible and effective psychiatric\nand psychological care as part of national suicide pre-\nvention strategies. There is a particular danger of this in\nlow-resource environments, like SA, where the health\ncare system is already under pressure and where there\nare a high number of competing demands for scarce psy-\nchiatric resources (Chopra et al., 2009; Mayosi et al.,\ndo that suicide is not a psychiatric condition, in high-\nincome countries where there is easy access to effective\npsychiatric care for those who seek it, but it is quite\nanother thing to argue that psychiatric responses to sui-\ncide prevention are not important in contexts where there\nare inadequate and inaccessible psychiatric services.\n6 Health Psychology Open \nIt is significant that participants describe their struggle\nto access mental health care at a community level and feel-\ning rushed by the psychiatric service providers they encoun-\nter. This finding draws attention to the health care context\nwithin which suicide attempts occur in SA and highlights\nthe significant mental health treatment gap, the shortage of\npublic mental health resources, and the fact that primary\nhealth care in the country is still predominantly biomedical\nand Lund, 2011). The participants in this study request\nongoing integrated person-centred care which includes\npsycho-social support at a community level. The findings\nsuggest that integrating psycho-social services in primary\nhealth care settings is important for suicide prevention in\nSA. It is noteworthy that the policy framework to achieve\nthis is already in place in the country (Department of\nHealth, 1997) in the form of the White Paper for the\nTransformation of the Health System in South Africa, but\nthat implementation of this policy has been hampered by a\nrange of factors, including resource constraints and a lack\nof political will. The constraints on clinic staff in primary\nhealth care and community clinics have resulted in a situa-\ntion where health care workers do little more than dispense\nmedication without providing any psycho-social interven-\nWhile participants attribute their suicidal behaviour to\npsychological distress and mental illness, they also\nacknowledge the significance of interpersonal factors and\nexplicitly ask for help in establishing connectedness, build-\ning relationships and resolving conflict with family mem-\nbers. This finding highlights the interpersonal context of\nsuicidal behaviour and draws attention to the need for fam-\nily interventions and interpersonally orientated psychother-\napy with individuals who have made suicide attempts.\nInterpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a time-limited psy-\nchotherapy that focuses on current problems with patients'\nrelationships (Weissman et al., 2000). A systematic review\nby Cuijpers et al. (2011) concluded that there is good evi-\ndence to support the use of IPT for depression. Similarly,\nevidence supports the use of IPT to treat mood disorders in\nprimary care settings (Linde et al., 2015). Studies have also\nshowed that IPT is effective in significantly reducing sui-\ncide ideation, death ideation, repetition of self-harm and\ndepressive symptom severity, and resulted in significant\nimprovements in perceived meaning in life, social adjust-\nment, perceived social support and psychological well-\nreview, meta-analysis and meta-regression of psychologi-\ncal and psycho-social approaches to reduce repetition of\nself-harm, concluded that on the basis of current evidence it\nis not yet clear what interventions should be delivered to\nreduce the risk of repetition of self-harm although `inter-\nventions with an interpersonal focus and targeted on the\nprecipitants of self-harm may be the best candidates'\n(Hetrick et al., 2016: 1). Integrating psychological\ninterventions alongside psychiatric and pharmaceutical\ninterventions is consistent with best practice in suicide pre-\nvention which advocates the use of multilevel strategies,\nthat is, strategies that target several populations or several\nlevels within health care systems or include interventions\nwith more than one focus, such as pharmacotherapy and\npsychotherapy (Van der Feltz-Cornelis et al., 2010).\nThe findings suggest that suicide attempters believe in\nthe importance of establishing connectedness as an antidote\nto suicide. The interpersonal-psychological theory specifi-\ncally identifies the role of `thwarted belonging'in the aetiol-\nogy of suicide (Hagan et al., 2016). Lack of relationships,\nsocial isolation, loneliness, living alone and being single are\nall recognised risk factors for suicidal behaviour (Ferreira\nfor help to establish connection and belonging is thus con-\nsistent with theory and empirical evidence. This finding\nhighlights the importance of addressing the interpersonal\ncontext in which suicidal behaviour occurs as part of the\npost-discharge care of suicide attempters.\nIt is noteworthy that participants articulate a need for\npractical help to solve socio-economic and situational prob-\nlems, such as financial difficulties, unemployment, home-\nlessness and legal difficulties. These situational stressors are\noutside the bounds of medicine to remedy, and highlight the\nsocial and economic factors that contribute to suicidal\nbehaviour. This finding suggests that teaching suicide\nattempters problem-solving strategies, helping them to\nidentify alternative solutions and connecting them to appro-\npriate social and legal services might reduce their suicide\nrisk. There is evidence of the effectiveness of brief prob-\nlem-solving cognitive therapy for suicide prevention\n2009). Data suggest that brief cognitive therapy produces\nrapid changes on dimensions such as negative problem ori-\nentation and impulsivity/carelessness problem-solving\nstyle (Ghahramanlou-Holloway et al., 2012). Of course,\nthere is a danger here that advocating problem-solving\ninterventions delivered to individuals as part of a suicide\nprevention strategy reinforces the idea that suicidal behav-\niour is a problem that is contained within the individual and\nthat building the resilience of the individual is central to\npreventing suicide. Interventions, such as teaching prob-\nlem-solving skills to individuals and building individual\nresilience, deny the reality that many individuals in LMICs\nlive under conditions of endemic violence, structural pov-\nerty, enduring inequality and continuous trauma. It is note-\nworthy that participants in this study ask for help with\nproblems such as poverty, unemployment and homeless-\nness. It is also significant that in the context of their suicide\nattempts, participants talk about their exposure to trauma\nand violence, particularly sexual- and gender-based vio-\nlence. While it is no doubt important to provide problem-\nsolving interventions and build individual resilience in order\nto prevent suicides, it is equally important to take note of\nwhat the data reveal about socio-economic and contextual\nproblems that are faced by the suicide attempters in this\nstudy. This social and economic context needs to be\naddressed at a political and economic level in order to\nreduce suicidal behaviour in LMICs. Fox (2003) has noted\nthat when research directly engages with the `politics of the\nsetting which it explores'(p. 96, emphasis in original), there\nis real potential for the research to become a source of social\njustice and to transform social relationships. The insights of\nthe participants in this study certainly make visible sites of\npotential social and political transformation.\nThe kind of support requested by the suicide attempters\nin this study is unlikely to be achieved without intersectoral\ncollaboration. The WHO has defined intersectoral collabo-\nration for health as the establishment of working relation-\nships between the health sector and other sectors (such as\nsocial welfare, criminal justice and housing services) in\norder to improve health outcomes more effectively, effi-\nciently or sustainably than would otherwise be achieved\n(WHO, 1997). The effectiveness of intersectoral collabora-\ntion for the community-based treatment of mental illnesses\nhas been documented and is considered best practice in a\nnumber of high-income countries (Darlington and Feeney,\nlaboration for suicide prevention, particularly in LMICs,\nhas been described (Bertolote et al., 2006; Reynolds and\nnumber of obstacles to achieving intersectoral collabora-\ntion in LMICs (Brooke-Sumner et al., 2016). Intersectoral\napproaches to the treatment of mental illnesses in SA have\nnot been adequately achieved, especially in rural areas,\nbecause of the lack of dedicated funding for such approaches\nof management and leadership to implement relevant pol-\nicy (Jenkins et al., 2011) and a lack of political will (Brooke-\nfurther noted that the attainment of effective intersectoral\ncollaboration is a complex challenge in LMICs due to the\nscarcity of resources, problems pertaining to the allocation\nand use of resources, inadequate organisational structures,\nmistrust, poor communication and a lack of distinct roles.\nLimitations\nData were collected from one urban hospital in SA. It is pos-\nsible that the experiences described by these participants are\nhighly context specific and representative of public services\nwithin a particular region of the country. Suicide attempters\nin other centres and rural areas may have different support\nneeds and other experiences of the health care system.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study draw attention to the need for sui-\ncide prevention efforts in SAto include access to psychiatric\ncare and integrated person-centred psycho-social support at\na primary health care level. Furthermore, the findings high-\nlight the interpersonal, social and economic context within\nwhich suicide attempts occur as well as systemic problems\nwith the organisation of care within the health system which\nimpede suicide prevention in SA. From the perspective of\nthe participants in this study, multilevel approaches and\nintersectoral collaboration would seem to be important com-\nponents of a national suicide prevention programme in SA.\nThere would, however, appear to be a number of problems\nwith the structure and delivery of health care in SA which\nimpede the attainment of these ideals. Crucially, the find-\nings of this study draw attention to the need in LMICs like\nSA, for suicide prevention interventions to focus on provid-\ning psychiatric and psychological care, and building indi-\nviduals'resilience while also addressing systemic social and\neconomic issues.\n"
