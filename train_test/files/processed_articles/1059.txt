    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Faced with growing numbers of uninsured people, many communities are de-\nveloping local programs to provide coverage or improve access. Some might predict that\nonly those with health problems would participate; however, little is known about who en-\nrolls. This paper examines participation and retention in three different community pro-\ngrams aimed at low-income uninsured adults. In two of the three programs, the typical par-\nticipant had no health problems. Improved access to preventive and routine physician care,\nand increased security about getting access to care should the need arise, appeared to be\nthe primary benefits of both initial and continued enrollment. [Health Affairs 25 (2006):\nThere are now 45.8 million unin-\nsured Americans, up from 38.7 million\nsured people are attributable not only to the\ndrop in take-up of health care coverage\namong workers, but also to the significant de-\ncline in the percentage of employers offering\ncoverage.2 With little response to this grow-\ning problem at the state and federal levels,\nmany communities have pursued local efforts\nto address the health care needs of their unin-\nsured populations. Recent initiatives such as\nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's\n(RWJF's) Communities in Charge (CIC) ini-\ntiative, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's Com-\nmunity Voices program, and the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration's\n(HRSA's) Community Access Program (CAP)\nand Healthy Communities Access Program\n(HCAP) have further spurred the growth of\nlocal programs. Such efforts are receiving in-\ncreased attention in the health services re-\nsearch literature and the media; however,\nmany questions remain unanswered about\nthe patterns of participation and retention in\nsuch programs and what those patterns\nsuggest about the programs' perceived role\nand value among their participants.\nThere are some common perceptions and\nmyths among community leaders and policy-\nmakers about the types of patients communi-\nty-based initiatives will attract. Some worry\nthat such programs will attract people with\nacute care needs who remain enrolled only un-\ntil their needs are met and then exit until they\nonce again have a short-term need for medical\nM a r k e t W a t c h\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e W 1 8 3\nErinFriesTaylor(etaylor@mathematica-mpr.com)isahealthresearcheratMathematicaPolicyResearchin\nWashington,D.C.CatherineMcLaughlinisaprofessorintheDepartmentofHealthManagementandPolicy,\nUniversityofMichigan,inAnnArbor.AnneWarrenisaresearchassistantintheDepartmentofEconomics,\nUniversityofMichigan.PaulaSongisaresearchassistantintheDepartmentofHealthManagementandPolicy.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The combi-\nnation of these two nonrandom selection\nprocesses could result in covering a pool of\nparticipants with high health care needs. To\nbetter inform policy surrounding coverage ex-\npansions, empirical evidence is needed on how\na program's eligibility criteria and target popu-\nlation affect who joins, who stays, and for how\nlong. Similarly, data on how enrollees use ser-\nvices while in these programs also represent\nuseful information to policymakers and pro-\ngram administrators.\nThis paper examines how the myths sur-\nrounding participation and retention play out\nin three local programs from the CIC initiative.\nUsing a survey of program participants, we de-\nscribe the ebb and flow of participants in these\nprograms, noting the characteristics of those\nwho enroll, which enrollees remain and which\nleave, and why. Examination of participants'\nhealth status, utilization, and disenrollment\npatterns provides important information on\nthe value of community-based programs to\ntheir participants.\nBackground On Communities In\nCharge\nacross the country to develop community pro-\ngrams aimed at improving access to care for\nlow-income, uninsured adults. This study ex-\namines results from the three sites chosen for a\nparticipant survey. Although all three pro-\ngrams provide fairly comprehensive benefits\nand aim to coordinate care in some fashion,\nthey differ greatly in their approach, target\npopulation, financing, and geography.\nn Alameda County, California. Alliance\nFamily Care was a coverage product adminis-\ntered by Alameda Alliance for Health, a not-\nfor-profit health maintenance organization\n(HMO) in Alameda County. The program tar-\ngeted low-income parents and their children.\nTo be eligible, a person had to be an uninsured\nresident of Alameda County with a household\nincome under 300 percent of the federal pov-\nerty level and ineligible for public coverage.\nAdults also had to have one or more children\nenrolled in the Alliance.4 Citizenship status\nwas not considered. Alliance Family Care is\nthe only program of the three studied here that\ncharged a monthly premium; however, premi-\nums were highly subsidized, ranging from $20\nto $120 per month, depending on age. Benefits\nincluded physician care, inpatient and outpa-\ntient hospital care, laboratory services, and\nprescription drugs. Some services required\nsmall copayments. Recertification of eligibility\noccurred every twelve months.\nFinancing for Family Care came primarily\nthrough the Alliance's reserve fund, with addi-\ntional funding through the California Endow-\nment and the California HealthCare Founda-\ntion (CHCF). The program also received some\ntobacco settlement money from the State of\nCalifornia.5\nn Austin, Texas. Seton Care Plus is an ac-\ncess program that provides health care to low-\nincome uninsured adults in Austin. The Seton\nHealth Care Network, a large nonprofit health\nsystem, administers the program. Enrollees re-\nceive care at one of three Seton community\nhealth centers (CHCs). To be eligible, a person\nmust have a household income under 250 per-\ncent of poverty and be ineligible for Medicaid\nand the local Medical Assistance Program (a\nprogram offered by the county). Citizenship\nstatus is not considered. Upon enrollment,\nparticipants are assigned a primary care pro-\nvider (PCP), given an access card to use when\nseeking medical services, and assessed sliding-\nfee copayments for various services based on\nincome. Benefits include physician care, inpa-\ntient hospital care, lab services, prescription\ndrugs, and (if approved as appropriate) emer-\ngency and urgent care. Seton generally recerti-\nfies eligibility every twelve months; however,\nthe program does recertify at six months for a\nsmall number of people expected to become\neligible for public programs. Seton Care Plus is\nfinanced by the Seton HealthCare Network as\npart of its mission to serve the poor.\nn Southern Maine. CarePartners offers\naccess to health care services (including care\nmanagement) for low-income adults in three\ncounties in southern Maine.

All hospitals in the three-\ncounty area (including those outside the\nMaineHealth system) and approximately 950\nlocal physicians have volunteered to provide\nfree care under the program. Although the cri-\nteria have since changed, at the time of our\nsurvey, eligibility criteria required that a per-\nson be a nonelderly adult with an annual\nhousehold income under 150 percent of pov-\nerty and ineligible for either government or\nemployer-sponsored health coverage. In addi-\ntion, a person must have resided within the\nprogram's service area for at least six months\na PCP and given a membership card. For spe-\ncialty care, enrollees must get a referral from\ntheir PCP. Benefits include physician care, in-\npatient hospital care, outpatient surgery, home\ncare, and prescription drugs. Copayments are\nrequired for certain services. CarePartners re-\ncertifies eligibility every six months.\nHealth care for CarePartners enrollees is\nprovided through the donated in-kind services\nof physicians and hospitals. However, Care-\nPartners differs from many other donated care\nprograms in that a local health system (Maine-\nHealth) also provides substantial funding for\nadministrative and support services (such as\nstaff salaries). The program has also received a\nHRSA CAP grant and grants from local foun-\ndations.\nData And Methods\nData for this analysis come from a multi-\nwave telephone survey of program partici-\npants in each of the three sites. Wave 1 was\nconducted within six to eight weeks of enroll-\nment (on a rolling basis between August 2001\nmately six months after enrollment; and wave\n3, at about twelve months after enrollment.\nWe attempted to interview everyone who par-\nticipated in the wave 1 survey in waves 2 and 3,\nregardless of their enrollment status at that\ntime. Only adult enrollees were eligible for the\nsurvey. If more than one person per household\njoined the program, one person per household\nwas randomly chosen for inclusion in the sam-\nple frame, to maintain independence.\nThe survey used a pretested, structured in-\nterview format. Many questions were similar\nto those of national surveys such as the Com-\nmunity Tracking Study (CTS) household sur-\nvey and the Urban Institute's National Survey\nof America's Families (NSAF). The wave 1 sur-\nvey included questions about health insurance\ncoverage, health care use, access, and unmet\nneed during the previous year; satisfaction\nwith and opinions about health care; and cur-\nrent health status, employment, and socio-\ndemographic information. The survey instru-\nment for waves 2 and 3 included many of the\nsame questions but also incorporated addi-\ntional satisfaction questions and, for those\nwho were no longer participating, questions\non reasons for disenrolling.\nResponse rates to the survey were high for\neach site and in each wave. Alameda's response\nrate ranged from 88 percent to 93 percent, de-\npending on the wave. In Austin, the wave 1 re-\nsponse was 76 percent, but response increased\nMaine, the response rate was 87\u00ad89 percent.\nKey Findings\nn Baseline characteristics of program\nenrollees. Enrollees' sociodemographic char-\nacteristics at the time of enrollment varied\ngreatly across the three programs studied (Ex-\nhibit 1). Alameda's Family Care program,\nwhich targeted parents, attracted the youngest\nadults, most of whom were married. In con-\ntrast, enrollees in southern Maine's program\nwere older and more likely to be unmarried.\nAll three programs attracted more females\nthan males. After household size was ac-\ncounted for, average income of enrollees across\nthe three sites was fairly comparable, ranging\nfrom an average 117 percent of poverty in Aus-\ntin to 139 percent in both Alameda County and\nsouthern Maine. The programs in Alameda\nand Austin both had large proportions of His-\npanic enrollees; in contrast, 88 percent of en-\nrollees in southern Maine were white.

At least half of the enrollees in\nall three sites were working at the time of en-\nrollment.\nBaseline health status and utilization pat-\nterns in the year before enrollment also dif-\nfered across the three programs (Exhibit 2). In\ntargeting parents, Alameda's program appears\nto have attracted the healthiest population of\nthe three programs. Enrollees in Austin's pro-\ngram--which drew working uninsured people\nwho were slightly older than enrollees in\nAlameda--were more likely than those in\nAlameda to report worse health and chronic or\nlimiting conditions. Southern Maine's pro-\ngram attracted predominantly users of the\nhealth care system: 90 percent had used health\ncare in the year before enrollment, compared\nwith about two-thirds of enrollees in Alameda\nand Austin. Southern Maine's average enrollee\nwas also in poorer health than enrollees in the\nother two sites: About half reported a chronic\nor limiting condition.\nn Stated and implied reasons for enroll-\nment. Although enrollees in the three sites\nwere fairly different in terms of age, marital\nstatus, health status, and previous health care\nusage, there was surprisingly little variation in\ntheir reasons for enrolling in the CIC pro-\ngrams. Responses from the vast majority of en-\nrollees suggested that they wanted the feeling\nof security associated with being in a program\nthat provides access to health care. For exam-\nple, when asked a series of agree-disagree\nquestions about their reasons for being in the\nprogram, 96\u00ad99 percent (depending on the\nsite) agreed or strongly agreed with the state-\nment: \"I feel more secure knowing I have\nH e a l t h T r a c k i n g\nBaseline Sociodemographics Of Enrollees In Three Communities In Charge (CIC)\nAlameda\nAustin\nSouthern Maine\nAverage age (years)***\nPercent female\nPercent married***\nRace/ethnicitya***\nAsian\nBlack\nHispanic\nWhite\nOther\nPoverty level***\nPercent currently employed***\nPercent self-employedb***\nNo coverage in year prior to enrollment***\nNever had coverage prior to CIC program***\nSOURCE: Communities in Charge (CIC) survey of program participants, wave 1 data.\nNOTE: Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between sites.\na All respondents reporting Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of race reported.

However, 41 percent of enrollees in\nsouthern Maine reported unmet need, for both\nhealth care and prescription drugs, in the pre-\nvious year.\nn Who stays enrolled, and why? At six\nmonths after enrollment, at least two-thirds of\nrespondents at all three sites were still en-\nrolled in the program (Exhibit 3).6 Retention\nwas highest among participants in Alameda's\nFamily Care program, an interesting finding\ngiven that this was the only program of the\nthree studied that required a monthly pre-\nmium. It appears that one important factor\ndriving the difference in retention might be the\nprogrammatic features of each site--specifi-\ncally, the eligibility criteria and the frequency\nof recertification. Alameda, which had the\nhighest retention, recertified eligibility every\ntwelve months and had the highest income-\neligibility threshold of the three sites. Austin,\nwith a slightly lower income-eligibility thresh-\nold, also recertified every twelve months.7 And\nsouthern Maine, which recertified every six\nmonths and had the lowest income threshold,\nhad the lowest retention rates.\nM a r k e t W a t c h\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e W 1 8 7\nSelf-Reported Health Status, Utilization, And Unmet Need In The Year Prior to\nEnrollment, Among Enrollees in Three Communities In Charge (CIC) Programs, 2001\u00ad\nAlameda Austin Southern Maine\nHealth status***\nExcellent\nVery good\nGood\nFair\nPoor\nChronic or limiting condition***\nAny health care use***\nUnmet health care need***\nUnmet prescription drug need***\nSOURCE: Communities in Charge (CIC) survey of program participants, wave 1 data.\nNOTES: Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between sites.

Specifically, disenrollees in Austin and\nsouthern Maine were younger than their con-\ntinuously enrolled counterparts. In Alameda,\ndisenrollees were more likely to be male and\nhave lower household incomes than continu-\nous enrollees.\nTo understand disenrollees' motivation for\nleaving the program (and perhaps provide\nsome insight into how they differed from con-\ntinuous enrollees), we examined reasons for\ndisenrollment.

Only 5 percent (or less, depending\non the site) of disenrollees reported leaving the\nprogram because they didn't think they\nneeded health care. Similarly, less than 5 per-\ncent of disenrollees in each site reported leav-\ning because of dissatisfaction with the pro-\ngram.\nA small percentage in all three programs re-\nported disenrolling because they were no lon-\nger eligible for the program (16 percent in\nsouthern Maine, which had the lowest income\nthreshold for eligibility, and 3 percent in each\nof the other two sites). Indeed, the most com-\nmon reason cited for losing eligibility was that\nhousehold income had become too high. In\nterms of program affordability, 22 percent of\ndisenrollees said that they could not afford to\nremain in the program in Alameda--the only\nprogram studied that charged enrollees a\nmonthly premium--compared with 5\u00ad8 per-\ncent in the other two sites. Although the sam-\nples of disenrollees are too small to detect any\nsignificant differences, this suggests that pre-\nmiums might have affected continued enroll-\nment.\nn Health status, use patterns, and dif-\nferences over time. To determine whether\nhealth care needs might have played a role in\nwhy continuous enrollees remained in these\ncommunity-based programs, we examined (1)\nhealth status and use patterns for continuous\nenrollees versus disenrollees, and (2) use pat-\nterns for continuous enrollees over time. The\nfirst set of analyses informs our understanding\nof who remains in these programs by compar-\ning and contrasting characteristics of continu-\nous enrollees with those of disenrollees. The\nsecond provides information on how continu-\nous enrollees use these programs, offering\nsome important insights into the value of these\nprograms for participants who took the time\n(in terms of eligibility paperwork) to remain\nenrolled and, in Alameda, continued to pay the\npremium.\nWe first examined how continuous en-\nrollees and disenrollees differed in health sta-\ntus and health care use at the time of enroll-\nment (Exhibit 4). There were few significant\ndifferences in health status and use between\nthese groups, and no consistent patterns. In\nAlameda, where there were very few disen-\nrollees, those with chronic or limiting condi-\ntions were significantly more likely than oth-\ners to disenroll. In the other two sites, there\nwas no significant difference. Nor were there\nsignificant changes in self-reported health sta-\ntus over the year of participation between con-\ntinuous enrollees and disenrollees (data not\nshown). About half of continuous enrollees\nand disenrollees in each site reported no\nchange in their health status over time. Among\nthose who did report a change, continuous en-\nrollees were no more likely than disenrollees\nto report an improvement or decline.\nTo determine whether usage patterns might\nhelp reveal enrollees' reasons for remaining en-\nrolled in their respective programs, we exam-\nined differences in use levels among continu-\nous enrollees for the year before versus the year\nafter enrollment (Exhibit 5). A significantly\nhigher proportion of continuous enrollees in\nall three sites reported physician use in the\nyear after enrollment, relative to the year be-\nfore, with the largest increase occurring in\nAlameda. Moreover, all measures of preventive\ncare included exhibited a statistically signifi-\ncant increase between the year before and the\nyear after enrollment. Over the same period,\ncontinuous enrollees' satisfaction with health\ncare increased significantly in all sites.\nConcluding Comments\nIn two of the three programs studied, the\nmajority of participants were in good, very\ngood, or excellent health and did not have\nchronic or limiting conditions. In these two\nprograms, Alameda and Austin, the majority of\nrespondents were still enrolled one year after\nenrollment, providing some evidence against\nthe myth that participants join programs for\nacute care needs and disenroll after those\nneeds are met. The program in southern\nMaine, the exception, attracted a significantly\nhigher proportion of people with either acute\nor chronic health care needs.\nThe majority of enrollees in all three sites\nM a r k e t W a t c h\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ We b E x c l u s i v e W 1 8 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Self-reported rates of preven-\ntive cares increased dramatically after enroll-\nment in all three sites. Getting preventive and\nphysician care seems to be an important aspect\nof participation for those who stay enrolled. In\naddition, program enrollees appear to derive\nvalue from the fact that these programs help\nthem avoid the financial risk associated with\ngetting health care when they need it. Almost\nall enrollees reported that they felt more se-\ncure knowing that they had health care cover-\nage or access after enrolling in the program.\nAnd although each of the three programs tar-\ngeted and attracted different subgroups of un-\ninsured people, the reasons for enrolling and\nstaying enrolled were fairly consistent across\nthe three programs.\nLess than 5 percent of disenrollees reported\nleaving the program because they did not\nthink they needed health care. Although some\nleft because they became eligible for other\nsources of coverage, many were disenrolled\nbecause they no longer met the program's eligi-\nbility criteria or failed to complete the neces-\nsary paperwork. The relatively high disenroll-\nment rates in southern Maine largely reflect\nCarePartners' recertification of eligibility ev-\nery six months.\nThere are several important limitations to\nthis work. The results are based on a small sur-\nvey of enrollees in each site, which limited our\nability to detect statistically significant differ-\nences, particularly when comparing sub-\ngroups such as continuous enrollees versus\ndisenrollees. The data reflect self-reported use,\nhealth status, and other measures, which are\nsubject to recall bias and other respondent er-\nror. Moreover, comparisons across the three\nsites are made with the caveat that these pro-\ngrams used different models of care and in-\ntended to attract different segments of the un-\ninsured population from the start.

Similar programs else-\nwhere might attract a very different set of en-\nrollees, depending on the generosity of a state's\nMedicaid program, the sociodemographic\nmakeup of the general population, local char-\nity-care efforts, and other factors.\nOur results suggest that although\ncommunity programs do not uni-\nformly attract high-use, high-cost en-\nrollees, their eligibility, recruitment, and re-\nenrollment strategies do influence who they\nattract.
