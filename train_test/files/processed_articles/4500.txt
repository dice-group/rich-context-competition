    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis mixed-methods study aimed to explore the initial process of engagement with an online support group (OSG) for\ndepression. Fifteen British National Health Service patients experiencing depression who had not previously used an OSG\nfor depression were offered facilitated access to an existing peer-to-peer OSG for 10 weeks. Pre- and post-measures of\ndepression, social support, and self-stigma were taken in addition to a weekly measure of OSG usage. A follow-up qualitative\ninterview was conducted with a subsample of nine participants. Depression and self-stigma reduced over the 10-week\nperiod, but perceived social support did not change. There was no evidence of adverse outcomes. Perceived benefits of\nOSG participation included connection to others, normalization of depression, and stigma reduction. However, engagement\nwith the OSG was generally low. Barriers included concerns over causing harm to others or being harmed oneself, feeling\ndifferent from others in the group, and fears of being judged by others. OSGs may potentially reduce depressive symptoms\nand perceived self-stigma. However, considerable barriers may hinder people with depression from engaging with OSGs.\nFurther work is needed to determine who will benefit most from participating in OSGs for depression and how best to\nfacilitate engagement.\n",

However, treatment may be hard to obtain or may\nnot be sought (Meltzer et al., 2000). One potential additional\nsource of help for people with depression is online support\ngroups (OSGs), which have many users worldwide (Griffiths,\nAlthough some people use depression OSGs even when\nthey are experiencing severe depression (Houston, Cooper,\nsome aspects of depression, particularly negative thinking\nstyles and low motivation, may make engagement with\ndepression OSGs difficult. Professionals wanting to refer\ntheir clients to a depression OSG may not know how best to\nproceed. The only empirical evidence comes from Van\nVoorhees et al.'s (2013) randomized trial, which found that\nan induction procedure emphasizing internal motivation led\nto greater engagement than one emphasizing external\nmotivation.\nThe present mixed-methods study aimed to explore the\ninitial process of engagement with a depression OSG by\nexamining the experiences of British National Health\nService patients encountering such a group for the first\ntime.\nMethod\nParticipants\nBritish National Health Service patients who experienced\ndepression were recruited. Adults on psychological therapy\nwaiting lists in three London boroughs were invited to par-\nticipate by their therapist; in addition, patients registered\nwith general practitioners in these boroughs were able to\nself-refer in response to a study website or to information in\ncommunity venues. The inclusion criteria were as follows:\n(a) self-identified as experiencing depression, (b) Internet\naccess (either at home or in a public venue), (c) no previous\nexperience of OSGs for depression, and (d) above 18 and\nfluent in English.

Ten (67%)\nwere university graduates. Nine (60%) were self-referrals\nand 6 (40%) were recruited via clinical teams. Eight (56%)\nwere currently taking anti-depressant medication. All partici-\npants were also invited to be interviewed, 9 (2, 22%, women;\nBritish and 4 (44%) were Asian. Eight (89%) were university\ngraduates. (See Table 1 for individual participant\ncharacteristics.)\nOSG\nThe OSG selected for this study was PsychCentral.com. This\nwas a U.S.-based peer-to-peer OSG which was \"stand-\nalone,\" that is, not linked to another intervention. It was cho-\nsen because it was a high-traffic website that had a\nconstructive atmosphere and was moderated by a team\nsupervised by a clinical psychologist. Permission was\ngranted by the website's owner for this research to take place.\nDesign and Procedure\nThis was a mixed-methods study, with quantitative measures\ntaken before, during, and after the intervention, in addition to\npost-intervention qualitative interviews.\nParticipants were emailed an information sheet. If they\nconsented to take part, they were emailed a link to the online\nquestionnaire, on completion of which they were directed to\nthe PsychCentral depression forum and given guidance on\nhow to register. They were encouraged to write a post to\nintroduce themselves to the group, and asked to engage with\nthe site as they wished over the next 10 weeks. At the end of\neach week, they were emailed a link to the OSG Usage\nReport. At the end of the 10 weeks, they were emailed a link\nto the final questionnaire and were invited to participate in a\nface-to-face interview. Participants were encouraged to con-\ntact the researcher by phone or email if they had difficulties\nusing the OSG or if they wished to discuss their\nexperiences.\nParticipants whose responses to the initial questionnaires\nsuggested that they were severely depressed or a risk to\nthemselves or others, i.e., scores >0.3 on the risk scale of the\nClinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation [CORE] or >1 on\nItem 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]\n(\"Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting\nyourself in some way\") were emailed with the suggestion\nthat they seek additional help, in line with the study risk pro-\ntocol. This procedure was followed for five participants.\nMeasures\nPre\u00adpost measures.The following pre\u00adpost measures were\nused: CORE--Outcome Measure (CORE-OM; Evans et al.,\n2000), a 34-item questionnaire assessing general psychologi-\ncal distress; PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), a\nnine-item depression scale; the Medical Outcomes Study\nSocial Support Survey (MOSSSS; Sherbourne & Stewart,\nSelf-Stigma Scale (DSSS; Kanter, Rusch, & Brondino,\n2008), two subscales of which were used: \"General Self-\nStigma\" and \"Treatment Stigma.\"\nMeasures taken at end only.OSG Questionnaire (OSGQ;\nChang, Yeh, & Krumboltz, 2001) is a nine-item scale mea-\nsuring overall satisfaction with an OSG. Overall usage: Post-\nings made to the group were identified by searching for\nparticipants' usernames. Each participant's total number of\nposts over the 10-week study period was recorded.\nMeasure taken weekly throughout the 10-week period.OSG\nUsage Report, designed for the current study, asked how\noften participants had logged on to the group during the\nTable 1.

It also had an open-ended question about\nexperiences of the group during that week.\nInterview\nThe semi-structured interview schedule covered three main\nareas: (a) depression and face-to-face social support, (b)\nengaging with the OSG, and (c) view of, and interactions\nwith, others in the group. Interviews lasted about an hour and\nwere digitally recorded. Participants were offered \u00a310 plus\nexpenses.\nThe data were analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun &\nClarke, 2006). For each transcript, units of meaning were\nidentified and collated into a tentative set of themes. Themes\nwere compared across all the transcripts and organized into\ngeneral themes and sub-themes, which were checked against\nthe original transcripts and modified accordingly. During the\nprocess of analysis, the two authors discussed the emerging\nthematic structure and attempted to resolve any areas of\nuncertainty. The interview data were also triangulated with\nweek-by-week written feedback from the OSG usage report.\nResearchers' Perspective\nQualitative research guidelines (e.g., Barker & Pistrang,\n2005) recommend that researchers disclose relevant back-\nground. The first author was a female clinical psychology\ngraduate student with a positive but limited experience of\nusing an OSG in a personal capacity. Her initial assumptions\nwere that OSGs can potentially be helpful, but that there\nmight be barriers to engagement. The second author was a\nmale clinical psychologist who had conducted research on\nsupport interventions. The researchers attempted to \"bracket\"\ntheir assumptions during the course of the study to be aware\nof how they might influence their interpretations of the data.\nResults\nOutcome, Usage, and Satisfaction\nEleven of the 15 participants completed all pre- and post-\nmeasures. Missing data were handled on an intent-to-treat\nbasis using last-observation-carried-forward.\nDepression and self-stigma reduced over the 10 weeks\n(Table 2). In terms of reliable change (Jacobson & Truax,\none deteriorated. There was no change in perceived social\nsupport or the total CORE-OM.\nUsage was generally low. The median percentage of\nweeks in which participants logged in was 30% (range =\n0-80%). The median number of posts over the 10 weeks was\n11-39), indicating a moderate level of satisfaction.\nQualitative Interviews\nContext. Most participants interviewed described experienc-\ning severe recurrent depression, which had affected their abil-\nity to work and had in several cases led to suicide attempts.\nOnly one was experiencing a first episode. Several also expe-\nrienced other mental health problems such as anxiety, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and trichotillomania. None\nhad had any experience of OSGs for depression. One\ndescribed a positive experience with an OSG for trichotillo-\nmania, and others had used non-mental health online com-\nmunities. About half had been hopeful about what the OSG\nmight offer them, for instance, looking forward to sharing\nideas with others and finding people with similar experiences.\nThe rest were less optimistic, reporting that they had not\nexpected to benefit from the OSG; they appeared to be moti-\nvated by curiosity or a desire to further psychological research.\nThematic analysis. The themes generated from the qualitative\ninterviews and weekly feedback were grouped into two\ndomains (see Table 3): perceived benefits and barriers to\nengagement.\nBenefits\nI'm not alone in this.Participants valued the opportunity to\nmake contact with others with experience of depression. Five\nsaid that they felt less socially isolated as a result of using the\nOSG and felt an emotional connection with other users, pro-\nmoted by others' openness about their experiences of depres-\nsion. Three felt that the site had helped to make depression\nTable 2. Outcome After 10 Weeks.\nBaseline M (SD) 10 weeks M (SD) t(14) p Cohen's d\nNote.

Feeling connected to others (5) There were some people who I could really empathize with. I felt like they were in\nexactly the same situation. I think on one occasion I actually posted something\nsaying that I empathize to that effect . . . (P2)\n1.2. The site normalized depression (3) [Using the site] has just reminded me that this is a . . . very common thing, and the\npeople of the world who experience this . . . that kind of normalizes it a bit. (P8)\n2. The value of talking to strangers online\n2.1. Site feels safe and non-judgmental (4) The thing about an illness like depression is I think the criticism you get from\noutside is quite harsh, painful, and people who have experienced it or have some\nunderstanding of it are, are not like that, it's safe. (P7)\n2.2. Anonymity makes it easier to self-disclose (3) It was a bit easier [online] because I knew that I was anonymous. I wouldn't\nnecessarily have to face those people again. (P8)\n2.3. Others here have no preconceptions of me (2) But usually when you're speaking to your friends, they already have an image about\nyou . . . in the group you're being addressed on what you actually say. (P9)\n3. Supporting others and being supported\n3.1. I have the group to fall back on (3) There is just this surplus of people in my life to help me that give me this\nassurance that I'm going to be okay, and that I'm never going to go into isolation\nagain . . . If nothing else works out, I have the group to fall back on, and as for\nmy problems, and I know that I'll have someone to speak to me. (P9)\n3.2. I wanted to help others (2) If they have been positively affected [by my post], then I would consider it like you\nknow, a pat on my back, like okay, so I've done a good job, I've done something\ngood for the day that has affected somebody's life. And that's why I would want\nto do it. (P9)\n3.3. Reading about others' experiences helped me (2) It's quite easy to get some support from reading the other people's experiences\n. . . Somebody's had something then they say what happened that made it better\nwhich helps because you think \"yeah, I can do that.\" (P7)\n4. Could be useful for others or for me at a different time\nIt could be useful for me if I were more/less\ndepressed (4)\nI remain open-minded about it. It could be that at a different stage of the illness it\nwould have been differently useful. (P4)\n4.2. It seems helpful for other people (4) I'm sure it's a really good site for a lot of people because there's a lot of people\nusing it and some of them have been on there like 11 years and I'm sure they\nget a great deal out of it. (P3)\nBarriers\n5. Fear of negative impact on others\n5.1. I would not be able to help others (3) I don't think [posting] contributed anything. I didn't think it did anything for me, I\ndidn't think it did, or would do, anything for anyone else. (P4)\n5.2. I might make others feel worse (5) So I kind of worry that I'll go on and there'll be some, probably some quite young\nperson in their teens or whatever, just coming to terms with this, and if I come\nalong and say \"Well, here I am after 20 years and it hasn't got any better\" then\nthat's not going to be very encouraging for them so I'd rather not say anything at\n5.3. I might cause trouble (3) People tend to say the same things. After a while a certain sort of house style starts\nto apply. People all say the same stuff and I thought if I do say something it's\ngoing to be radically different from what a lot of other people have said and it\nmight cause trouble. (P5)\n6. Fear of negative impact on self\n6.1. There's nothing helpful that anyone can say (3) I just didn't find the things, their replies, were particularly comforting or useful so I\ndidn't post again for a while. (P2)\n6.2. It might make me feel worse (5) \"I'd been there, I hated it, I don't want to remember\" was one of them; the \"no no\nno you're going to do yourself damage if you do that\" is another one; the \"no you\njust don't understand\" or at least \"you don't understand where I've been.\" (P4)\n6.3. Fear of being judged by others in the group (2) I felt like all my sort of social anxiety that I feel about going into a physical room\nfull of people it was also there, even in this totally anonymous online group. It\nstill felt as though I was walking into a big party and didn't know anyone, it was\nstrange.

This was linked to the size and the international\nnature of the OSG.\nThe value of talking to strangers online. Some participants felt\nmore comfortable talking about depression to strangers\nonline than to their friends and family. They attributed the\nsafe, non-judgmental nature of the OSG to the fact that users\nhad personal experience of depression. Three felt that the\nanonymity enabled them to disclose more freely. Two spoke\nabout the helpfulness of talking with people who did not\nhave any preconceived ideas about them.\nSupporting and being supported.Participants felt supported\nfrom being in contact with the group, even without any actual\ncommunication. Three said that knowing that it was there,\neven if they were not using it, was helpful. They appreciated\nbeing able to access the group immediately and at any time,\nand some contrasted this with their experience of waiting a\nconsiderable time for therapy. Two talked about wanting to\nhelp others as a result of reading their posts and the sense of\nreward that comes from offering help, and two others talked\nabout the support they had got from reading about others'\nexperiences. One felt that seeing other people going through\ncycles of low moods reminded her that she would once again\ncome through her own current low patch, and another spoke\nabout the way in which he had been inspired to try different\nways of coping.\nCould be useful for others or for me at a different time. Even if\nthey had not found the site helpful, participants without\nexception expressed the view that the site could potentially\nbe a useful resource for people with depression, and com-\nmented that users appeared to be supporting each other and\nseemed to benefit. Four felt that they had been severely\ndepressed at the time of the research: One spoke about find-\ning it difficult to even motivate himself to log on. Two felt\nthat the group may have been more useful to them if they\nwere less depressed, although others said that they would be\nmore likely to use the site if they were having a bad time.\nBarriers\nFear of negative impact on others.Participants' concern for\nthe other people involved with the group was striking, and\nsome cited the potential negative consequences that their\ninvolvement could have for others as one of the reasons that\nthey did not contribute more. In some cases, the concern that\nthey would not be able to help others held participants back\nfrom seeking support, as they felt strongly that their relation-\nship with the site should be reciprocal. Four participants said\nthat they sensed that others in the group were vulnerable and\nworried that their contributions could make people feel\nworse: one said that hearing about her long history with\ndepression might be discouraging for someone who was\nnewly diagnosed. Three worried that they might get into con-\nflict with others in the group and had held back from posting\nbecause they were afraid that they would express anger or\ncriticism.\nFear of negative impact on self. Participants were concerned\nthat spending time on the site might make their depression\nDomain and theme (Ns) Illustrative quotation\n7. Not my kind of people\n7.1. People were too different from me (5) There was almost a feeling of \"If you're well enough to be on here, relating like\nthis, writing coherently and reading stuff, then you and I are not in the same\nplace.\" (P4)\nIt was hard to tell whether people were\ngenuine (3)\nIt wasn't like I was reading things from real people, I was reading things from\npeople's online versions of themselves which put me off a bit. (P5)\n7.3.

(P8)\nTable 3. (continued)\n6 SAGE Open\nworse, particularly if they were not feeling especially\ndepressed. Three felt that others on the site could not help\nthem, and one who posted messages did not find the replies\nhelpful. One expressed the view that when people were\ndepressed they were too withdrawn to interact and when they\nwere well they were afraid of interacting with other depressed\npeople for fear of being pulled back down into depression.\nTwo participants described experiencing social anxiety in\nface-to-face situations, and worried about how they would\ncome across in the group and whether others might be criti-\ncal of them.\nNot my kind of people.Participants mentioned various\naspects of how others in the group communicated which\ndiscouraged them from becoming involved. The site being\nbased in the United States made it hard for some partici-\npants to relate to the other users: they mentioned differ-\nences in language, social contexts, and medication names\nas barriers to understanding. Three felt that it was hard to\ngauge whether others were being genuine, making it diffi-\ncult to feel comfortable sharing thoughts and feelings.\nThree said that the level of discussion on the site was\ntoo shallow and people's posts could be experienced as\npatronizing.\nIt was hard to talk (to strangers) online. Participants said that\nalthough they wanted to express themselves, it was difficult\nto do so in the OSG, because they felt embarrassed and vul-\nnerable. Four spoke about the difficulty in establishing rap-\nport online (sometimes attributed to factors such as the\nasynchronous nature of responses and the absence of body\nlanguage and eye contact) which would have made them feel\ncomfortable enough to reveal personal information. Two said\nthat both having time to think about what they were about to\nsay, and not having the pressure of having to produce some-\nthing for a listener in front of them, were the inhibiting fac-\ntors. Four felt that people who really knew them were in a\nmuch better position to help them through their depression\nthan strangers online. In interactions with people who knew\nthem well, these participants valued that they did not have to\nexplain themselves and their history, that people could tell\nhow they were feeling, and that they could remind them what\nthey were like when they were not depressed, which instilled\na sense of hope. Comments from strangers, although sup-\nportive, were experienced by some as \"meaningless\" whereas\nreal friends' support had more impact.\nDiscussion\nThis mixed-methods study introduced a small sample of 15\npeople with depression, recruited through the British\nNational Health Service, to a depression OSG and tracked\ntheir engagement with it. Most had moderate to severe levels\nof depression at baseline. Over the 10-week period of\nthe study there were modest reductions in depression and\nperceived stigma, with no change in perceived social sup-\nport. Overall, there were low levels of engagement with the\nThe reduction in depression is consistent with the results\nof many other studies (Griffiths, Calear, & Banfield, 2009).\nHowever, in the absence of a control group, it is not possible\nto attribute a causal role to OSG participation, particularly\nbecause engagement was low.\nThe low levels of activity may reflect the way in which\npeople naturally engage with OSGs, that is initially spending\na long time viewing the site without posting (\"lurking\")\nbefore joining the discussion. Lieberman (2007) found that\n74% of participants in breast cancer OSGs lurked before they\nposted, with half of these doing so for 2 to 8 weeks. To\nobserve the engagement process as it naturally occurs, a lon-\nger study period would be needed.\nParticipants not only described several benefits of taking\npart in the OSG but also emphasized factors that had hin-\ndered their engagement. In contrast to previous studies that\nhave recruited participants from among existing users of\nOSGs (who are likely to be at least reasonably satisfied with\nsuch groups), the present study recruited people who had\nnever before used a depression OSG, tracking their engage-\nment and allowing the voices of those who find such groups\nless helpful to be heard.\nParticipants showed a striking concern for the well-being\nof others in the group and wanted to help them, but several\nfelt unable to do so, often because their own struggles left\nthem without resources. Sometimes this inhibited partici-\npants from using the group, as they felt that their relationship\nwith it should be reciprocal. This raises the question of what\ncould be done to help users access support without feeling a\npressure to reciprocate immediately.\nThe main barriers to participation were fears of having a\nnegative impact on others in the group, or the group's having\na negative impact on oneself. Participants also worried about\ntheir depression being made worse by their interaction with\nthe group and reported avoiding reading posts with negative\ncontent. This may reflect a more general tendency toward\nemotional avoidance among participants which may have\naffected their low engagement with the group (Cameron\net al., 2005). In addition, negative beliefs about seeking help\n(e.g., that it is a sign of weakness) may also have inhibited\nparticipation.\nThese concerns are understandable in the light of the\nwell-documented \"cognitive triad\" of negative beliefs about\nthe self, the world, and the future that characterizes depres-\nsive thinking (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). Levine\nand Moreland (2006) suggested that in general people try to\njoin groups that are maximally rewarding and minimally\ncostly. Depressive thinking may have led participants to\nBreuer and Barker 7\nunderestimate the rewards and overestimate the costs of join-\ning the OSG. As they did not engage, there was no opportu-\nnity for them to gain evidence to disconfirm their negative\npreconceptions.\nLimitations\nThis was a small-sample, mixed-methods study. The quanti-\ntative arm had low statistical power; the measures were\nincluded to give an indication of participants' overall out-\ncomes. The sample was a convenience one, but it did have\nthe advantages of having a range of ages and ethnic back-\ngrounds, and of giving people access to an OSG for the first\ntime.\nLimiting participants' choice to a single OSG was prob-\nlematic, as there is evidence that when people choose a\ngroup that \"fits\" them best, they are more likely to engage\npredominantly North American group was with hindsight\nunfortunate, as cultural differences were often mentioned as\na barrier to participation. Thus, it is unclear whether the low\nlevels of engagement and barriers to participation found in\nthis study reflect engagement with OSGs for depression in\ngeneral or with this OSG in particular. When the study\nstarted, there was no comparable U.K.-based OSG in terms\nof moderation, positive group climate, and high volume of\ntraffic.\nImplications\nThere was no evidence of negative effects from the OSG,\nand some participants reported benefits, which suggested\nthat clinicians need not be concerned by their clients'involve-\nment with OSGs. It appears that prospective members who\nanticipate negative effects simply do not engage with such\ngroups. Many of the barriers to participation relate to peo-\nple's fears of what might happen were they to take part,\nrather than to actual experiences of participation. It is unclear\nto what extent these fears are related to cognitive aspects of\ndepression. Depressed clients may benefit from some thera-\npeutic work to help them test the accuracy of their negative\npredictions in the initial stages of engaging with such a\ngroup.\nSome of the barriers identified in this study are related to\nthe negative thinking style, withdrawal and lack of motiva-\ntion characteristic of depression. It would be valuable to\ndesign an intervention to help participants overcome these\ninitial barriers and evaluate if this had any impact on engage-\nment. If barriers to active participation can be minimized,\npeople with depression may then be able to derive more ben-\nefit from online support.\n"
