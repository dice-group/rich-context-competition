Data on maternal height (as a proxy for\noffspring growth potential and thus fetal nutritional demand) and third trimester maternal arm fat area (as a proxy for maternal\nsupply) were used to create four groups hypothesized to reflect a gradient of fetal energy sufficiency.\nResults: As fetal energy sufficiency increased among males, there was a decrease in total cholesterol (TC) (Po0.05 for trend),\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the ratios of TC/HDL-C cholesterol and LDL-C/HDL-C (all Po0.001), while\nHDL-C increased (Po0.05). Similar associations were identified when lipid levels were modeled as dichotomous `high-risk' cut-\npoints used in cardiovascular disease prevention in adolescents. These relationships were stronger, or only present, among\noffspring of mothers in the lower half of the third trimester energy intake distribution, and were independent of the child's\ncurrent adiposity, dietary energy and fat intake, maturity, household income, and birth weight. In females, the supply\u00addemand\nmodel did not predict any lipid outcome or clinical risk criteria.\nConclusions: Our findings in males support the hypothesis that the balance between fetal nutritional demand and maternal\nnutritional supply has implications for future lipid profiles. The lack of significant associations in females adds to mounting\nevidence for sex differences in lipid metabolism programming, and may reflect sex differences in fetal nutritional demand.\nSponsorship: The National Science Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, the Nestle Foundation, and the Emory University\nInternationalization Program.\nKeywords: fetal growth; maternal nutrition; serum lipids; cardiovascular diseases; sex characteristics; Philippines; birth weight\nIntroduction\nRisk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular\nmortality is elevated among individuals who were at the\nlower end of the birth weight distribution (Barker et al,\n1989). The prevailing hypothesis to explain these findings,\nthe `fetal origins hypothesis', is founded upon the observa-\ntion that fetal nutrition is a key determinant of fetal growth\nrate and thus assumes that birth weight functions as a\nAccording to this hypothesis, poor fetal nutrition forces the\nfetus to slow its overall growth rate to conserve resources,\nwhile relative adjustments in organ growth, hormonal set\npoints, and other physiologic responses boost immediate\nsurvival. These responses, collectively described as `program-\nming', are viewed as permanent, and contribute to elevated\nrisk for CVD in postnatal life (Lucas, 1991).\nWhile a growing number of studies have investigated\nrelationships between maternal nutritional status during\npregnancy and offspring CVD risk (Forsen et al, 1997;\n*Correspondence: C Kuzawa, Department of Anthropology,\nE-mail: kuzawa@northwestern.edu\nGuarantor: CW Kuzawa.\nContributors: CWK and LSA were responsible for study design, data\ncollection, and securing funds. CWK was responsible for data analysis\nand drafting the manuscript, which was revised by both authors.\nwww.nature.com/ejcn\nthe fetal origins hypothesis continue to use birth weight as a\nmarker of fetal nutritional sufficiency (Rasmussen, 2001).\nRecent reviews present a strong rationale to question this\ninterpretation of birth weight (Godfrey & Robinson, 1998;\nbaby may have realized a lower growth potential with\nadequate fetal nutrition (Chard et al, 1993). By the same\nreasoning, a baby with a high growth potential may attain\nan average or above-average birth weight despite growth\nrestriction, and be misclassified as having adequate growth.\nWhile unquestionably complicating the interpretation of\nbirth weight, the normal population variability in fetal\ngrowth potential also raises important questions about the\ndeterminants of fetal nutritional sufficiency. For a fetus\naiming for a higher growth target, maternal supply must be\ngreater to avoid fetal nutritional insufficiency and the\nmetabolic and developmental adaptations that restrict\ngrowth and elevate CVD risk after birth (reviewed by Godfrey\n& Robinson, 1998). It follows that fetal nutritional suffi-\nciency and associated postnatal CVD sequelae are not a\nsimple product of the level of nutrition delivered by the\nmother across the placenta, but the balance of maternal\nsupply relative to fetal demand (Figure 1). A complete test of\nthe fetal origins hypothesis would take both determinants of\nfetal nutritional sufficiencyFmaternal supply and fetal\ndemandFinto account.\nWe use data collected prospectively in the Philippines over\na 17-y period to develop and test markers of maternal third\ntrimester nutritional supply (arm fat area) and fetal nutri-\ntional demand (fetal growth potential as indexed by\nmaternal stature). Subjects are participants in a 1-y birth\ncohort study who have been followed since the third\ntrimester of pregnancy and had lipid profiles measured\nwhen they were 14\u00ad16 y of age. We have previously shown\nthat birth weight and maternal nutritional status during\npregnancy predict lipid profiles among the males in this\npopulation, which is experiencing a rising burden of\ncardiovascular disease (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003). Here we\ntested the hypothesis that categorizing individuals based\nupon the likelihood of having experienced energy shortfall\nin utero, as indicated by different combinations of high and\nlow maternal supply and fetal demand, would predict lipid\nprofiles measured in adolescence.\nSubjects and methods\nPopulation and research design\nData come from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition\nSurvey (CLHNS), a community-based cohort study of\nnutritional status and other characteristics were measured\nduring the third trimester of pregnancy (3072 weeks\ngestational age). Mothers and offspring were then followed\nsurvey when cholesterol was measured, 2089 adolescents\nhad available measurements of birth outcomes, gestational\nage, and current measurements, from which a subsample was\nselected for blood sample collection. Twin pregnancies\n(n \u00bc 10) were excluded and the sample limited to term births\ndefined as a gestational age at birth Z37 weeks. The\npopulation selected for blood draws was sampled at random\nwithin two birth weight strata. To ensure adequate numbers\nof lower birth weight individuals for an analysis of the effects\nof fetal growth restriction on CVD risk (not presented here),\nwe oversampled individuals with birth weights equal to 2600\ng or below. Final samples for the lipid analysis include\nwith higher birth weight. We correct for this sample design\nin the analysis (discussed below).\nThe potential for bias associated with attrition after the\nbaseline survey and selection of the subsample was assessed\nin several ways. First, we compared birth characteristics of all\nadolescents who were included in the 1998 follow-up with\nthose who were lost to follow-up. Mean birth weight of those\nlost to follow-up was roughly 50 g less (Po0.05) than those\nretained in the sample. This is most likely attributable to the\nhigher mortality rates among low birth weight infants. Birth\nlength did not differ significantly in the two groups. Those\nlost to follow-up were more likely to have been urban\nresidents (82.5% urban vs 73.5% in the retained sample), but\nthere were no significant differences in household assets,\nmaternal education or maternal height, age or parity. Next,\nwe assessed potential biases in the subsample selected for\nlipid analysis. Consistent with sampling design, females\nincluded in the CVD study had significantly lower birth\nweight, current height, and current weight (all Po0.05)\ncompared to those excluded, while these differences were\nFigure 1 Supply\u00addemand model of fetal nutritional sufficiency and\ncardiovascular programming.\nSupply\u00addemand model of fetal cholesterol programming\nCW Kuzawa and LS Adair\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nclose to significant in males (Po0.07 for birth weight,\nsignificant differences in current anthropometrics among\nthe selected males was in large part due to the greater body\nsize variability in males. The absolute differences between\nthe selected and excluded subsets were quite similar among\nmales and females (eg for current weight, the selected female\ndifferences between the included and excluded subsets in\ncurrent body mass index (BMI), skinfold thickness, house-\nhold income, or dietary fat intake.\nDiet, anthropometrics, and socioeconomic variables\nBody weight, height, waist circumference, mid-upper arm\ncircumference, and triceps skinfold thickness were measured\nin mothers and offspring using standard anthropometric\ntechniques (Lohman et al, 1988). BMI was calculated as the\nratio of weight (kg)/height (m2). Arm fat area was calculated\nfrom triceps skinfold thickness and mid-upper arm circum-\nchild's dietary intake was measured using two 24-h recalls on\nconsecutive days. Mean macronutrient intakes from the 2\ndays were used in analyses. Energy and fat intake were\ncalculated using Philippines Food Composition Tables\nproduced by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of\nthe Philippines (Institute and Medicine, 1990). In females,\nprospectively measured age at menarche was used to\nconstruct a five-level maturational status variable. Among\nmales, maturational status was assessed by self-rated five-\nlevel pubic hair staging, which was validated against\nphysician assessment (unpublished data). Although not\ndirectly comparable with one another, the male and female\nmaturity scales were used to control for variation in\nmaturational status within each sex. When data were\nsurveyed before boys. Consequently, boys are roughly 1 y\nolder than girls. Informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants, and all protocols were reviewed and approved\nby Institutional Review Boards at the University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill, with supplementary reviews by\nboards at the Emory University Medical School and the\nUniversity of San Carlos in Cebu, Philippines.\nLipid profiles\nFor measurement of lipid profiles, participants were asked to\nfast overnight for 12 h, and blood samples were collected in\nclinics the following morning using EDTA-coated tubes.\nAfter separation, samples were frozen and shipped on dry ice\nto the Emory Lipid Research Laboratory (Atlanta, GA, USA)\nfor analysis of lipid profiles. All samples remained frozen at\n\u00c0801C until ready for analysis. Total lipids were determined\nby enzymatic methods using reagents from Beckman\nDiagnostics on the CX5 chemistry analyzer. High-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C) were determined using the homoge-\nneous assay direct HDL-C and direct LDL-C (Equal Diagnos-\ntics, Exton, PA, USA). Total cholesterol (TC) was determined\nwith an enzymatic kit, while triacylglycerol (TG) was\ndetermined with a glycerol blank as a two-step reaction\n(Beckman Coulter Diagnostics). The atherogenic ratios of\nTC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C were also calculated (Labarthe,\n1998). The Emory Lipid Research Laboratory is a participant\nin the CDC/NHLBI Lipid Standardization Program to ensure\naccuracy and precision of the determinations.\nMaternal nutritional supply\nIn selecting a measure of maternal nutritional supply, we\nexcluded maternal weight or body mass index, as these in\npart reflect the weight of the feto-placental unit. Maternal\narm fat area (MAFA) measured during the third trimester of\npregnancy (3072 weeks of gestation) was deemed the most\nappropriate index of maternal nutritional supply as it is a\nmarker of energy balance that is correlated with maternal\noffspring birth weight in this sample (Adair & Popkin, 1988).\nPrior research in the Cebu sample has shown that third\ntrimester MAFA or the related measure of triceps skinfold\nthickness is inversely related to offspring CVD risk as\nindexed by lipid profiles (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003) and blood\npressure (Adair et al, 2001). We also use maternal third\ntrimester energy intake to validate our model.\nFetal nutritional demand\nWe use maternal height as a marker of fetal growth potential\nand thus fetal demand for nutrients. Of the candidate\nvariables at our disposal, mother's height is among the\nstrongest established predictors of birth weight (Institute of\nMedicine, 1990) and, compared to other measures of\nmaternal body size, is only weakly correlated with mother's\nthird trimester MAFA (r \u00bc 0.18). We did not have paternal\nheight measurements available for this analysis. This\napproach is similar to the use of adult height as an index\nof fetal growth potential in prior fetal origins research (Leon\nfetus born to a tall mother has, on average, a higher fetal\ngrowth potential, thus requiring a greater supply of nutrients\nto avoid nutritional insufficiency, growth restriction, and the\nsuite of adaptations that persist to elevate risk for CVD.\nConstructing the four fetal energy sufficiency groups and\nhypotheses\nWe first divided the population into high/low levels of fetal\ndemand based upon a median split (median \u00bc 150.4 cm) of\nmaternal height (tall/short), and two levels of maternal\nsupply as indexed by a median split (median \u00bc 12.2 cm2) of\nhigh/low third trimester maternal arm fat area (HAFA/LAFA).\nSupply\u00addemand model of fetal cholesterol programming\nCW Kuzawa and LS Adair\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nNext, we defined four groups representing the four possible\ncombinations of high/low supply and high/low fetal\ndemand (Figure 2). In our model, an individual born to a\ntall mother with low energy status (Tall-LAFA) has a high\nfetal demand for nutrients (high growth potential) but a\nmother with a poor capacity to supply these needs as\nindicated by her energy stores (LAFA). Thus, offspring of\nTall-LAFA mothers are predicted to have highest CVD risk. By\nthe same logic, the offspring of short but well-nourished\nmothers (Short-HAFA) are predicted to have lowest risk of\nfetal energy shortfall and thus lowest postnatal CVD risk.\nThe two intermediate risk groups (high demand/high\nsupply and low demand/low supply) have an associated\nlevel of hypothesized CVD risk that is more ambiguous.\nWhile our results are very similar when the two intermediate\nrisk groups are pooled (data not shown), we retained these\ngroups as separate in our analyses to illustrate both the\nindependent and combined effects of MAFA and maternal\nheight. Under the assumption that MAFA is a better index of\nmaternal supply than is mother's height as a marker of fetal\ngrowth potential, we expected the group born to Short-LAFA\nmothers to have higher risk than those born to Tall-HAFA\nmothers. We thus hypothesized that the four groups would\nrepresent the following gradient of fetal energy sufficiency\nand associated reduction in CVD risk in adolescence: Tall-\nLAFA o Short-LAFA o Tall-HAFA o Short-HAFA. To allow\ntrend tests in regression models, we defined a four-level\nordinal variable (`fetal energy sufficiency') based upon this\nhypothesized gradient of fetal energy sufficiency, with\nTall-LAFA \u00bc 1, Short-LAFA \u00bc 2, Tall-HAFA \u00bc 3, and Short-\nLowest energy sufficiency Highest energy sufficiency\nTall-LAFA Short-LAFA Tall-HAFA Short-HAFA\nTo validate our hypothesis that this four-level variable\nreflects a gradient of fetal energy sufficiency, we further\ndivided the population based upon a median split of\nmaternal third trimester energy intake. We hypothesized\nthat the gradient in CVD risk across fetal energy sufficiency\nlevels would be stronger, or only present, among offspring of\nmothers with lower third trimester energy intake.\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were performed with version 8 of the Stata\nStatistical Package (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas,\nUSA). In order to get an unbiased estimate of distributional\ncharacteristics (eg mean LDL-C or dietary energy intake of\nchildren), we weighted the observations such that both birth\nweight strata would be represented in the estimate in\nproportion to their occurrence in the population. Probability\nsampling weights (pweights) for each strata were calculated\nas the inverse of the within-strata sampling fraction (see\nabove), and the svymean procedure of STATA used to\nestimate distributional characteristics. For all analyses, a P-\nvalueo0.05 was considered a statistically significant rela-\ntionship with po0.10 noted as a statistical trend.\nWe tested the hypothesis that our four-level ordinal fetal\nenergy sufficiency variable would be inversely related to\nCVD risk in offspring, as indicated by circulating concentra-\ntions of each lipid and the two atherogenic ratios of Total/\nHDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C. To clarify the clinical significance\nof these relationships, we also calculate the prevalence and\nodds ratios (ORs) for members of each fetal energy suffi-\nciency group being classified as `high risk' for each lipid\noutcome, using clinical cut-points developed for use in\nadolescents (Kwiterovich, 1991). In this analysis, we also\ncalculate a summary risk index reflecting the total number\nof high risk lipid values for each individual (possible score of\n0\u00ad6). Diet and adiposity measures and HDL-C and TG were\nlog-transformed to approximate normal distributions before\nregression analysis.\nFor each lipid outcome, we first test for significant trends\nacross levels of fetal energy sufficiency, indicated by the\nsignificance of the beta coefficient for the four-level ordinal\nvariable in univariate regression models (linear regression for\nmean values, logistic regression for clinical cutpoints, and\nordered logistic regression for the summary risk index). For\neach lipid outcome, we ran a series of regression models to\ndetermine the degree to which any relationships with fetal\nnutritional sufficiency were independent of potential con-\nfounders and the child's weight at birth. We first report a\nunivariate model relating each lipid to the four-level ordinal\nfetal energy sufficiency variable alone. In model 2 we adjust\nfor factors that might confound associations with prenatal\nvariables, including the adolescent's current adiposity,\nMother Tall\nHigh fetal\ngrowth\npotential\nLow fetal\ngrowth\npotential\nHigh fetal\ndemand\nLow fetal\ndemand\nLow arm\nfat area\nLow\nmaternal\nsupply\nLowest\nenergy\nsufficiency\nIntermediate-\nLow\nHigh arm\nfat area\nHigh\nmaternal\nsupply\nIntermediate-\nHigh\nHighest\nenergy\nsufficiency\nFetal energy\nsufficiency\nShort\nFigure 2 Supply\u00addemand model defining four groups with variable\nlevels of fetal energy sufficiency.

In model 3, we further adjust for\nbirth weight to assess the degree to which any relationships\nbetween fetal energy sufficiency and lipids are independent\nof birth outcome.\nFor the purpose of evaluating whether the oversampling of\nindividuals with a birth weight r2.6 kg in our sample might\nbias the conclusions drawn from our models, in model 3, we\nalso substituted a categorical variable (r2.6 and 42.6 kg) for\nthe continuous birth weight measure. By assessing any\nchange in the beta coefficients for the energy risk variable\nbefore and after inclusion of birth weight strata variable, we\nwere able to assess whether fetal energy sufficiency\u00adlipid\nrelationships are biased due to over-representation of\nindividuals with a birth weight of 2.6 kg or below. Consistent\nwith our prior work in this sample (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003),\nsensitivity analyses for all models showed that including the\nvariable reflecting sampling design had negligible effect on\nthe estimates, precision, or significance of regression coeffi-\ncients for the fetal energy sufficiency variable (not reported).\nAs the fetal energy sufficiency\u00adlipid relationships that we\ndocument are independent of low birth weight status, we\nconcluded that they are not biased by over-representation of\nlow birth weight individuals in our sample.\nOur prior work in this population revealed highly\nsignificant sex differences in the association between\nprenatal factors and later lipid profiles and blood pressure\nmodels were stratified on sex.\nResults\nObesity was nearly absent in the population and the\nparticipants had relatively low dietary fat intake (Table 1).\nThere were significant trends for many of the dietary,\nanthropometric, and socioeconomic variables across the\nfour levels of fetal energy sufficiency.

In contrast to the males, there were no\nsignificant differences in any lipid outcome between the\nfour levels of the fetal energy sufficiency variable in females,\nwhether tested as a trend across the four-level ordinal\nvariable (regression) or as multiple comparisons between\nindividual fetal energy sufficiency levels (Bonferonni-cor-\nrected ANOVA).\nWe tested comparable multivariate regression models\nday) halves of maternal energy intake during the third\ntrimester of pregnancy (Table 4).

We therefore report results for males only.\nFor each lipid, the percentage of males considered to be ``at\nhigh CVD risk'' decreased significantly as fetal energy\nsufficiency increased; that is, for all five of the cholesterol\noutcomes, a higher proportion of males were at high CVD\nrisk in the Tall-LAFA group compared to the Short HAFA\ngroup. Intermediate levels of fetal energy sufficiency were\nassociated with intermediate ORs for high CVD risk in\nadolescence.

Our expectations were confirmed in\nmales but not females. Male adolescents who had a high fetal\ndemand for nutrients who were born to mothers who had\npoor energy status during pregnancy have the highest risk\nfor CVD as adolescents, as indicated by five of six of the lipid\noutcomes investigated. As the likelihood of having experi-\nenced energy shortfall in utero decreased across the four-\nlevel supply\u00addemand variable, the levels of TC and LDL-C\ndecreased while HDL-C increased. As a result of these\nopposing trends, fetal energy sufficiency was strongly\ninversely associated with the atherogenicity of the lipid\nprofile as indicated by the ratios of TC/HDL-C or LDL-C/\nHDL-C. These associations were independent of potential\nconfounding factors and were only present, or strongest,\namong offspring of mothers in the lower half of the\ndistribution of dietary energy consumption during preg-\nnancy. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis\nthat the balance between fetal demand for nutrients and the\nmaternal capacity to supply these needs has persistent effects\non male offspring lipid metabolism.\nThe supply\u00addemand model developed here is an extension\nand refinement of our prior work in this population, which\nillustrated the importance of MAFA alone as a predictor of\noffspring male lipids (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003). The gradient in\nlipid profiles across the four-level fetal energy sufficiency\nvariable (ie Table 5) illustrates the utility of considering both\nMAFA and maternal stature simultaneously. In the present\nanalyses, male offspring of both low MAFA groups have\nsignificantly elevated risk for developing future CVD com-\npared to the reference group born to well-nourished but\nshort mothers. However, offspring of low MAFA-Tall mothers\nwere significantly more likely to be classified as `high CVD\nrisk' for five lipid outcomes (all but TG), while the offspring\nof low MAFA-Short mothers were only at increased risk for\nlow HDL-C and high LDL-C/HDL-C, with an additional\nborderline-significant relationship with high TC. Thus, even\nwithin MAFA strata, information on mother's height pro-\nvides a refined basis for identifying males at risk for CVD. We\nbelieve that this finding is consistent with our hypothesis\nthat fetal demand for nutrientsFas indicated here by\nmaternal statureFis a variable in its own right, and one\nwith independent effects on the balance of fetal nutritional\nsufficiency.\nRecent commentaries emphasize that the fetal environ-\nment is likely to have a minor influence on cardiovascular\nrisk and mortality (Kramer, 2000). Our findings in males\nsuggest that this assessment may be premature, and a\nreflection of the widespread use of birth weight as a marker\nof fetal nutritional sufficiency. While weight at birth had\nlittle relevance to future lipid profiles in this population, the\nsupply\u00addemand model predicted multiple clinical criteria of\nhigh-risk lipid profiles in males. As has been noted\npreviously for relationships between maternal nutrition or\nnutritional status during pregnancy and offspring CVD risk\nenergy sufficiency variable predicted lipids independent of\nbirth weight. Compared to the group with highest energy\nsufficiency, males in the lowest energy sufficiency group\nwere about five times more likely to have a level of LDL-C or\nTC defined as `high risk' for cardiovascular disease. The\nlowest energy sufficiency group was also roughly three times\nmore likely to have low levels of beneficial HDL-C, and was\nfive times more likely to have an elevated atherogenic ratio\nof LDL-C/HDL-C. These findings suggest that fetal nutri-\ntional sufficiency, if modeled appropriately, may have great-\ner clinical relevance than suggested by studies that use birth\nweight as a proxy for fetal nutrition.\nSex differences in lipid programming: hypotheses\nThe consistency of the findings in males is striking in light of\nthe absence of any significant relationship in females. While\nsupport for our model would be stronger if results were also\nsignificant in females, these sex differences were not\nunexpected in light of past research. Our prior work in this\npopulation has identified inverse relationships between\nbirth outcomes or maternal nutritional status during\npregnancy and offspring lipids (Adair et al, 2001; Kuzawa &\ninteraction between birth length and postnatal growth as an\ninfluence on blood pressure (Adair & Cole, 2003) that were\nonly present among males. Based on human epidemiological\nevidence for lipid programming is commonly stronger, or\nonly present, in males. Thus, rather than discounting our\nmodel, we feel that our findings add to mounting evidence\nfor sex differences in the process of cardiovascular program-\nming, particularly of lipid metabolism.\nWhile no model has been proposed to account for sex\ndifferences in cardiovascular programming, the supply\u00ad\ndemand model suggests one possible interpretation of these\nfindings. Sexual dimorphism in growth rate begins before\nbirth, and is reflected in the common finding of higher mean\nbirth weight and length among male compared to female\nnewborns (Hindmarsh et al, 2002). The greater nutritional\ndemands of the male fetus may render it more precariously\nbalanced nutritionally, and more vulnerable to disruptions\nin supply. For instance, in rats, surgical reduction in uterine\nblood flow alleviates the normal sexual dimorphism in size\nheightened sensitivity of male fetuses to maternal nutrition\nis suggested in humans by the finding in some studies that\nnutritional supplementation of poorly nourished mothers\ndisproportionately improves male birth weight (Mora et al,\nfetuses suffer higher pregnancy losses under conditions of\nmaternal undernutrition (Andersson & Bergstrom, 1998). If\nSupply\u00addemand model of fetal cholesterol programming\nCW Kuzawa and LS Adair\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nthe greater male sensitivity to prenatal nutrition or stress\n(Stinson, 1985) manifests as sex differences in postnatal lipid\nprofiles or CVD risk, sex differences might be accentuated in\nthis population owing to the marginal nutritional status of\nthe mothers during pregnancy.\nSex differences in lipid programming may also reflect\nprogramming of the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adgonadal axis,\nwhich is known to have lasting influence on sex steroid\nmetabolism (Rhind et al, 2001). Males experience a prenatal\nand early postnatal surge in testosterone that `androgenizes'\nvarious target tissues, organs, and endocrine axes, altering\ntheir sensitivity and developmental response to the rise in\ntestosterone production initiated at puberty (Forest, 1983).\nFetal testosterone production, in turn, is sensitive to\nmaternal nutrition (Rae et al, 2002) and stress (Ward &\nthe pubertal rise in androgen production to the establish-\nment of the male-typical adult lipid profile (Berenson et al,\n1981), any long-term effects of the intrauterine milieu on sex\nsteroids or steroid-sensitive target tissues, such as liver\nenzymes (Gustafsson & Stenberg, 1974), could influence\nadult lipid profiles in males. Such dual `organizational' and\n`activational' effects of androgens are well established for\nnumerous tissues and organs (Rhind et al, 2001).\nImportance of fetal growth potential\nOur results add to a small but growing list of `fetal origins'\nstudies that attempt to account for variation in fetal growth\npotential. Prior work has used indices of fetal growth\npotential in combination with birth outcomes as a basis for\nassessing the sufficiency of growth in utero. Leon et al (1996)\nand Hennessy and Alberman (1997) found that inverse\nrelationships between birth weight and blood pressure were\nstrongest among individuals who ended up taller as adults.\nBased upon the assumption that small size at birth in a tall\nadult is an indication that growth potential was not attained\nin utero, both authors interpret their findings as evidence\nthat failure to reach fetal growth potential may be critical to\nblood pressure programming.\nIn contrast to this approach, our supply\u00addemand model is\nunique in operationalizing growth potential as an influence\non the fetus' risk of nutrient shortfall by determining its level\nof nutritional demand. While genetics presumably play a\ndominant role in setting the fetal growth trajectory,\nepigenetic mechanisms of fetal growth restriction may also\nbe important. Given evidence that the fetal growth trajec-\ntory may be reset in response to maternal nutrition or\nhormonal cues during early pregnancy or the periconceptual\nperiod (Godfrey & Robinson, 1998), growth restriction of\nepigenetic origin might paradoxically protect the developing\nfetus against nutritional insufficiency by lowering the level\nof nutritional demand during later gestation. Current work\non parent of origin effects (imprinting) on IGF-II and a\nrelated cluster of genes suggests a possible epigenetic basis\nfor separate regulation of fetal demand and maternal supply,\nmanifesting as differential expression of fetal growth-pro-\nmoting and placental-supply limiting genes in the fetus and\nplacenta (Reik et al, 2003). Our results, along with evidence\nfor sex differences in the transgenerational effect of maternal\nconstraint on birth weight (Price & Coe, 2000), suggest that\nthese processes may vary in important ways in males and\nfemales.\nLimitations of study\nAlthough prospectively collected data are a strength of our\nstudy, we were forced to rely on imperfect measures of both\nfetal growth potential and maternal supply capacity. The\nmothers in the Cebu sample have low mean stature relative\nto Western standards, which is presumably a reflection, in\npart, of poor postnatal nutrition and unattained growth\npotential (Siega-Riz & Adair, 1993). This is likely to reduce,\nbut not abolish, the utility of maternal stature as a marker of\noffspring growth potential. While maternal stature was the\nmost appropriate measure of fetal growth potential available\nfor our sample, prior research has used offspring adult stature\nown birth weight (Skjaerven et al, 1997) to similar effect. Our\nmodel should be viewed as a preliminary attempt to\nincorporate variation in fetal nutritional demand into the\nstudy of the fetal origins of adult disease.\nSimilar limitations apply to our measure of maternal\nsupply capacity, as obstructed substrate flow to the fetus\nsecondary to maternal hypertension, placental insufficiency,\nor other factors may compromise fetal nutrition indepen-\ndent of maternal nutrition and nutritional status (Harding,\n2001). We were not able to control for these additional\ninfluences on maternal supply capacity. The changes in\nadipose tissue stores that occur during pregnancy, and the\ninterindividual variability in this process, complicate our\ninterpretation of MAFA. The women in the Cebu sample\nwere marginally nourished during pregnancy, as indicated by\nlow energy intake and a third trimester BMI of roughly 23\nkg/m2. It is thus of interest that the relationships between\nthe fetal energy sufficiency variable and lipids in male\noffspring were stronger, or only significant, among mothers\nwith below-median energy intake during pregnancy. This\nstrengthens our interpretation that nutritional insufficiency\nis related to the observed results. The utility of MAFA as a\nfunctional measure of maternal supply may have been\naccentuated by the marginal nutritional status of the women\nin the sample, and by the fact that it was measured at a mean\ngestational age (3072 weeks) just prior to peak energetic\ndemands of pregnancy and fetal fat deposition (King,\n2000). Our model may prove most useful in populations\nexperiencing a similar level of energetic and nutritional\nrestriction.\nAs we are using maternal anthropometric characteristics to\npredict offspring lipid profiles, we are unable to rule out\nconfounding of the associations by shared genes or features\nof environment. However, we feel that this an unlikely\nSupply\u00addemand model of fetal cholesterol programming\nCW Kuzawa and LS Adair\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nexplanation for our findings in males. If the associations\nbetween fetal energy sufficiency categories and later lipids\nwere the result of shared genetic or lifestyle factors, we would\nexpect the offspring of mothers with greater adiposity to\nhave higher cholesterol. This is the opposite of the observed\ntrend in males. Indeed, it is the nonintuitive association\nbetween high offspring cholesterol and low maternal\nadiposity, especially in combination with low maternal\nenergy intake, that makes it unlikely that our findings are\nmerely due to offspring resembling their mothers. However,\nthese associations are in agreement with the predictions of\nthe fetal origins hypothesis.\nIn conclusion, our findings in males highlight the\npotential benefits of considering variation in fetal demand\nfor nutrients in tests of the fetal origins hypothesis, as a\ncomplement to current research focused on factors influen-\ncing the supply of nutrients to the fetus. Among males, the\nsupply\u00addemand model developed here predicted mean levels\nand clinical cut-points for five of six lipid outcomes\ninvestigated. Lipid risk factors for development of athero-\nsclerosis were most elevated among offspring of taller\nmothers with low adipose tissue stores, and these associa-\ntions were strongest when the mothers consumed below-\nmedian dietary energy during pregnancy. In contrast, the\nsupply\u00addemand model did not predict any lipid outcome or\nclinical cut-point among females. We speculate that sex\ndifferences in the level of fetal nutritional demand, or sex\nsteroid programming, may help explain these differences.\n"
