    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of sub-clinical inflammation, is a predictor of\nfuture cardiovascular diseases. Dietary habits affect serum CRP level however the relationship\nbetween consumption of individual food groups and CRP levels has not been established.\nMethods: This study was designed to explore the relation between food intake and CRP levels in\nchildren using data from the cross-sectional 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys. CRP level was classified as low, average or high (<1.0, 1.0-3.0, and >3.0 mg/L, respectively).\nAdjusted mean daily intakes of dairy, grains, fruit, vegetables, and meat/other proteins in each CRP\ncategory were estimated using multivariate analysis of covariance modeling. The effect modification\nby age (5-11 years vs. 12-16 years), gender and race/ethnicity was explored. We examined whether\ntotal or central body fat (using BMI Z-scores and waist circumference) explained any of the\nobserved associations.\nResults: A total of 4,010 children and adolescents had complete information on diet, CRP and all\ncovariates of interest and were included in the analyses. Individuals with high CRP levels had\nsignificantly lower intake of grains (p < 0.001) and vegetables (p = 0.0002). Selected individual food\nsubgroups (e.g., fluid milk and \"citrus, melon and berry\" consumption) were more strongly\nassociated with lower CRP than were their respective major food groups. Consumption of meat/\nother proteins did not influence CRP levels. The addition of body composition variables to the\nmodels attenuated the results for all food groups to varying degrees.\nConclusion: Children and adolescents with higher CRP levels had significantly lower intakes of\ngrains and vegetables. The associations between selected childhood dietary patterns and CRP levels\nseem largely mediated through effects on body composition.\nBackground\nC-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein, is a non\nspecific biomarker of inflammation produced by the liver\nin response to various inflammatory conditions [1]. The\nsynthesis of CRP is regulated by cytokines, for the most\npart Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [2]. The development of highly\nsensitive CRP assays (hs-CRP) has enabled the identifica-\ntion of more subtle elevations in CRP that may predict the\nincreased risk of atherogenic cardiovascular diseases\n(CVD)[3,4] with better specificity than traditional risk fac-\nThis article is available from: http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/6/1/40\n\u00a9 2009 Qureshi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntors such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lev-\nSub-clinical inflammation, as measured by CRP, has been\nindependently associated with fasting insulin levels in\noverweight children and adolescents [5]. Thus these\ninflammatory markers may be important early predictors\nof adult chronic disease risk and may be pro-atherogenic\neven at that early stage of life [6].\nA number of studies have analyzed the relationship\nbetween dietary factors and CRP in adults. For example,\nhigher intakes of grains, fruits and vegetables [7,8] in\nadults have been associated with lower CRP levels. Simi-\nlarly, those following or adopting a Mediterranean-style\ndiet [9,10] had reduced levels of inflammation. Among\nchildren, there are few data on the effects of diet on\ninflammatory markers although dietary fat (but not con-\nsumption of milk and meat) was positively associated\nwith CRP levels in 6-14 year-old children[11]. One inter-\nvention that combined activity and a diet rich in unre-\nfined carbohydrates, fiber (from grains, fruits and\nvegetables), protein-based foods and low-fat dairy prod-\nucts led to a lowering of CRP levels in obese children[12].\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate the association\nbetween the intake of foods in each of the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) major Food Pyramid\nserving groups[13] and serum CRP levels in children (ages\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES) will be used to address this question.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe NHANES are cross-sectional population-based sur-\nveys conducted by National Center for Health Statistics\nfor the purpose of assessing the health and nutritional sta-\ntus of U.S. adults and children[14,15]. The survey samples\nare selected using a stratified multistage probability\ndesign with random sampling of the civilian non-institu-\ntionalized population, with over-sampling of certain sub-\ngroups. Our analyses were conducted with the approval of\nour Institutional Review Board.\nsurveys, we included 5,857 children and adolescents, ages\n5 to 16 years. Adolescents' ages 17 years and older were\nnot included in the study since dietary habits during this\nearly post-high school period are often unstable due to\nsubjects with missing or unreliable dietary data as well as\n204 individuals with extreme energy intake (upper and\nlower 2% of the distribution). We further excluded sub-\njects meeting any of the following criteria: missing CRP\ndata (n = 590), pregnant or breastfeeding (n = 15), on\ndialysis or taking oral medications or insulin for diabetes\n(n = 11), missing data on covariates (n = 204), and those\nnot able to be classified into one of primary racial groups\n(n = 107). Finally, to eliminate illness as a possible cause\nof elevated CRP, we excluded 77 subjects (mean CRP =\n7.02 mg/L) whose white blood cell count was above the\nage- and sex-specific upper limit of normal as specified in\nthe NHANES laboratory manuals[18]. The final study\npopulation included 4,110 children and adolescents.\nAssessment of food group intakes\nNHANES with a single, multipass 24-hour recall, carried\nout using a computer-assisted dietary interview system\nthat has been previously described[19]. A revised five step\nautomated multiple-pass instrument was used starting in\nthe interview independently. A proxy respondent\nresponded for five-year olds while children ages 6 to11\nyears completed the interview together with a proxy\nrespondent.\nThe dietary recalls were analyzed by the USDA using nutri-\nent files that were appropriate to the time period of data\ncollection[21,22]. Food Pyramid servings were estimated\nfor each subject as defined by the USDA's Dietary Guide-\nlines[23] (see additional file 1).\nMeasurement of Highly Sensitive CRP (hs-CRP)\nBlood samples were collected from all subjects, stored at -\n20 degrees centigrade and then shipped to the University\nof Washington Medical Center for analysis. The CRP con-\ncentration in serum was measured by a high-sensitivity\nassay, latex enhanced nephelometry, on a Dade Behring\nNephelometer II Analyzer System. The analytical perform-\nance of this test has been validated[24] and shown to be\ncomparable to that of ELISA[25].\nPotential confounders and modifiers of effect\nWe considered the following potential confounding vari-\nables in our analysis: exact age, race/ethnicity, height (in\nmeters), height-for-age Z-Scores (HAZ), socioeconomic\nstatus (SES), body mass index (BMI) and BMI-Z Scores,\nwaist circumference, sedentary behavior (hours of TV\nwatching and video and computer time per day), energy\nintake (in kilo calories), percentage (%) of calories from\ncarbohydrates, protein and fat and fiber intake per 1000\nkilocalories of energy.\nRacial/ethnic origin was classified into three categories:\nnon-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics\n(i.e., Mexican-Americans). SES was estimated using com-\nbined data on income and food insecurity. Weight was\nmeasured on a Toledo Digital Scale and standing height\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n(to the nearest 0.1 centimeter) using a fixed stadiometer.\nWaist circumference was measured with a steel tape (to\nthe nearest 0.1 centimeter) at the high point of iliac crest\nat the end of normal expiration[26]. BMI was calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by the square of height, in\nmeters. CDC growth charts were used to calculate age and\nsex-specific BMI Z-scores and height-for-age Z-scores\nusing the Lambda, Mu, Sigma (LMS) method[27].\nStatistical analysis\nThe goal of the analysis was to evaluate the association\nbetween serum CRP levels at 5 to16 years of age and die-\ntary intake in the USDA food pyramid groups. Since\nNHANES provides only a single 24-hour dietary recall and\nsingle recalls may provide reliable estimates of population\ngroup means rather than individual means, we chose to\nestimate the adjusted food group means according to the\nchild's CRP group assignment[28]. CRP was classified into\none of three categories that have been previously shown\nto reflect low, average and high risk of future CVD[29]:\nAdjusted mean intakes of dairy, grains, fruit, vegetables\nand meat/other proteins were estimated in each of these\ncategories using analysis of covariance modeling with\nProc GLM.\nAll analyses were carried out using SAS, Version 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC). We used Proc Surveyreg to calculate\nadjusted mean differences in food group intake by CRP\nlevels accounting for stratification and clustering within\nprimary sampling units. Since we adjusted for the covari-\nates representing the over-sampled subgroups, we did not\nadjust for sampling weights in our analysis; this adjust-\nment is regarded as a good compromise between effi-\nciency and bias[30]. The results of the Surveyreg\nProcedure were almost identical to the simpler GLM mod-\neling, leading us to retain the GLM modeling in the results\nof this manuscript.\nResults\nThe characteristics of the study population in each of the\nthree categories of CRP are summarized in Table 1. There\nwere no meaningful differences in age or sedentary behav-\nior across categories of CRP. The BMI (p < 0.0001), BMI Z-\nincreased with higher CRP levels. Children with low CRP\nlevels were slightly shorter than those with higher levels.\nNon-Hispanic whites were most likely to be in the lowest\nCRP group while Hispanics were most likely to fall into\nthe highest CRP category.\nCRP levels were inversely associated with energy intake (p\n< 0.0001); those in highest CRP group reported consum-\ning the fewest calories. To address the concern of biased\nreporting of energy intake, we also examined the associa-\ntion between energy intake and BMI. We found that those\nin the highest tertile of BMI consumed fewer calories\nThe adjusted mean food group intakes in the three catego-\nries of CRP are shown in Table 2. After adjusting for age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, height, SES, and sedentary behav-\nior, children in the lowest CRP category consumed more\n0.047). We also explored controlling for the height-for-\nage Z-scores and found nearly identical results, leading us\nto retain the original height variable in the models (see\nadditional file 2).\nEffect modification was assessed using a product term in\nthe multivariable models. The only statistically significant\ninteractions were found between age and CRP levels (for\ngrain intake) (p = 0.03) and for race/ethnicity and CRP\nlevels for meat intake (p = 0.02). In that model, there was\nan inverse association between CRP and meat intake\namong Hispanics (p = 0.021) but no association was\nobserved among Non-Hispanic whites (p = 0.617) and\nNon-Hispanic blacks (p = 0.792) (see additional file 3).\nExploring role of body composition and other dietary\nfactors\nThe weak but beneficial association between CRP level\nand dairy consumption in the baseline analysis was atten-\nuated by controlling for either BMI Z-score (p for linear\nwas only a small amount of attenuation of the associa-\ntions of grains and vegetables with CRP level. In the final\nanalysis in this table, all other food groups were added to\nthe baseline multivariable models. In this analysis, only\nan independent association remained for grains and veg-\netables with CRP. In contrast, the inclusion of energy-\nadjusted macronutrients and fiber to the models did not\nfully attenuate the observed associations between any of\nthe food groups and CRP in these children.\nThe associations of food subgroups and CRP levels are\nshown in Table 3. A number of the food subgroups here\nare consumed infrequently by these children and adoles-\ncents (e.g., yogurt, whole grains, dark green/leafy vegeta-\nbles, deep yellow/orange vegetables), giving us little\nstatistical power to examine their relationship with CRP.\nThe milk subgroup was inversely associated with CRP (p\n= 0.040) while cheese consumption was not. Refined\ngrain intake appeared to be beneficially associated with\nCRP (p < 0.0001). Other food subgroups found to be ben-\neficially related to CRP level included citrus, melons, and\nstarchy vegetables (p = 0.004), and total starchy vegeta-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nC-reactive protein levels (mg/L)\nLow\nAverage\nHigh\nP value, two sided\nmean (SD)\nFood groups (servings/day)\nEnergy adjusted macronutrients\nNo. (row percent)\nGender\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; SD, standard deviation; kcal, kilocalories of energy\n* The number of usual hours spent watching television, playing video games or using a computer\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 2: Adjusted mean food intakes according to C-reactive protein level in children ages 5-16 years\nC-reactive protein levels (mg/L)* n Dairy Grains Fruit Vegetables Meat/Other Proteins\nmean (SE)\nBaseline analysis\nBody composition\nAdding BMI Z-Score to the baseline model\nAdding Waist Circumference to the baseline model\nOther dietary factors\nAdding other dietary food groups to the baseline model\nAdding percent calories from fat to baseline model\nAdding percent of calories from carbohydrates to baseline model\nAdding percent of calories from proteins to baseline model\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAdding Fiber intake/1000 kilocalories of energy to baseline model\nAbbreviations: SE, standard error;\nAdjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, socioeconomic status, and sedentary behavior. 25 subjects were missing information on waist\ncircumference\nTable 2: Adjusted mean food intakes according to C-reactive protein level in children ages 5-16 years (Continued)\nTable 3: Adjusted mean food subgroups intakes according to C-reactive protein level in children ages 5-16 years\nC-reactive protein levels (mg/L)\nLow\nAverage\nHigh\nP for trend\nmean (SE)*\nAbbreviations: SE, standard error;\n*Adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, socioeconomic status, and sedentary behavior.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nbles (p = 0.012). Neither total meat nor any of the meat/\nother protein subgroups were associated with CRP levels.\nDiscussion\nThis study found that children and adolescents with\nhigher CRP levels had significantly lower intakes of grains\nand vegetables. There was also a weak beneficial associa-\ntion between dairy intake and CRP level, particularly for\nmilk consumption. The low intakes of a number of food\nsubgroups made it difficult to assess the associations of\nthese dietary factors with CRP. Certain subgroups such as\ntomatoes and citrus, melon and berries were found to be\nbeneficially associated with CRP. Both starchy and non-\nstarchy vegetables had similar associations with CRP.\nIn general, the addition of body composition variables to\nthe multivariable models attenuated the associations\nbetween food consumption pattern and CRP levels. Only\nthe intakes of grains and vegetables were independent of\nBMI and waist circumference. The mechanism by which\ndifferent foods may affect the sub-clinical inflammatory\nstate is not clear although these results do suggest that\nbody composition plays a role.\nObesity is a potent risk factor for the development of\natherosclerosis as well as non-insulin dependent diabetes\nmellitus and these effects may be due in part to the sub-\nclinical inflammatory response associated with excess adi-\npose tissue[31]. It has been reported that adipose tissue\nsecrete cytokines such as IL-6 that in turn regulate CRP\nproduction[32]. Both obesity and inflammation are\nrelated in a circular fashion. Excessive weight gain stimu-\nlates an inflammatory response while inflammation itself\nleads to greater weight gain[33]. Recent published studies\nin children indicate that excess adiposity is associated\nwith significantly higher levels of CRP[34,35] and several\nother studies suggest that high CRP levels may lead to\nearly atherosclerotic changes in children[36].\nThe association between fruit and vegetable consumption\nand CRP in this study is consistent with some earlier stud-\nies of adults. Higher intakes of citrus, melon, berries or\ntomatoes may be linked with healthier lifestyles in general\nand with beneficial effects on body fat acquisition. Fruits\nand vegetables are low-energy dense foods (fewer calories\nper gram of food) with high contents of water and fiber.\nThe larger volume of food consumed combined with the\nlow energy density may benefit satiety[37], energy balance\nand weight status[38]. While controlling for body compo-\nsition in our analyses attenuated the effects of fruit intake,\nthe association between vegetable consumption and CRP\nwas unchanged, suggesting that the effects of vegetables in\nthis study was not entirely explained by differences in\nbody composition.\nSome food groups such as vegetables and fruits are partic-\nularly rich in antioxidant compounds including vitamin\nopene[42]. These anti-oxidants may lower the concentra-\ntion of CRP, thereby reducing sub-clinical inflammation.\nIn one study, the total antioxidant capacity of the diet was\nshown to be independently associated with lower CRP\nlevels, leading the authors to suggest that this mechanism\nmight be part of the explanation for the beneficial effects\nof certain dietary factors such as fruits, whole cereals and\nred wine on the risk of CVD [43]. In addition, low levels\nof antioxidant vitamin intake have also been associated\nwith obesity in children[44].\nUnlike vegetables, the association between CRP levels and\ndairy consumption in this study was attenuated by the\ninclusion of either BMI or waist circumference in the mul-\ntivariable models. Thus, it is possible that the association\nbetween dairy and CRP is explained by previously shown\nbeneficial effects of dairy intake on body composi-\ntion[45]. Dairy intake may also be linked with greater sati-\nety or a healthier diet in general. In a recent study in mice,\na diet rich in dairy led to decreases in the expression of\nseveral inflammatory cytokine genes in adipose tissue[46]\nwhich was in turn followed by decreases in the levels of\nplasma IL-6 and its associated inflammatory marker CRP.\nThe inverse association between CRP and grain intake was\nnot explained by differences in body composition. Nei-\nther body composition nor the intake of macronutrients\nor other foods explained the relation between CRP and\nrefined grains. The CRP-grain association in this study is\nconsistent with findings among adults in NHANES-III[47]\nbut not consistent with effects found in other studies[48].\nIn one recent study of adults on a hypo-caloric diet, the\nintake of both whole and refined grains was associated\nwith moderate weight loss but only whole grain con-\nsumption led to reductions in CRP levels[49].\nThere are several limitations of this study, the most impor-\ntant of which is its cross-sectional design. Certainly, it is\nvery unlikely that the reported dietary intake in this study\nis biased by knowledge of CRP level. However, it is possi-\nble that the reported dietary intakes are biased by the level\nof body fat which is closely linked with CRP. This bias is\nmore likely present among adolescents than among\nyounger children.\nA second important limitation of this study is the availa-\nbility of only a single 24 hour dietary recall, thereby pro-\nviding a less precise measure of intake. The use of a single\nrecall does not introduce bias but will reduce the power to\ndetect true effects that may exist, especially in population\nsubgroups (e.g., stratifying by race/ethnicity) and for\ninfrequently-eaten foods. To minimize error associated\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwith using a single 24-hour recall to classify children\naccording to dietary intake, we classified the children\naccording to CRP level and examined mean dietary\nintakes in these groups[28].\nWe were unable to exclude certain chronic diseases or\nprevalent acute infections in the children. However, we\ndid exclude those subjects whose white blood cell count\nwas above the upper limit of the reference range from the\nNHANES laboratory procedural manual. Another limita-\ntion of this analysis is that we were unable to control for\nphysical activity since these data were not collected for\nchildren at ages 5-11 years of age. While the association\nbetween physical activity and CRP levels during child-\nhood is uncertain[50], we attempted to address this\npotential confounding issue by including a measure of\nsedentary behavior in the multivariable models.\nThere are certain strengths of this study that we would like\nto mention. NHANES is a comprehensive national survey\nwith a large sample size (and over-sampling of minori-\nties), making the results more generalizable to US popula-\ntion. To our knowledge this is the first study to examine\nthe effects of USDA food group intakes on CRP levels in\nchildren, while examining the role of number of potential\nmodifiers of this relationship.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, in this cross-sectional study, higher levels\nof CRP were associated with lower intakes of vegetables\nand grains and, to a lesser degree, lower intakes of dairy.\nOnly the associations seen with grains and vegetable\nintakes were independent of body composition. Higher\nintakes of certain food subgroups, such as milk, citrus,\nmelons and berries, and tomatoes were also associated\nwith lower levels of CRP. These dietary relationships with\nCRP should be further examined in future prospective\nstudies.\nAbbreviations\nCRP: C-reactive protein; NHANES: National Health and\nNutrition Examination Surveys; BMI: Body mass index;\nIL-6: Interleukin-6; hs-CRP: highly sensitive CRP assays;\nCVD: cardiovascular diseases; LDL: low-density lipopro-\ntein; USDA: United States Department of Agriculture;\nSES: socioeconomic status; ELISA: Enzyme-linked immu-\nnosorbent assay; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention; LMS: lambda, Mu, Sigma; TAC: Total antioxi-\ndant capacity; p: p for trend\nCompeting interests\nEach of the authors has read and approved the final ver-\nsion of the manuscript and takes responsibility for its con-\ntent.
