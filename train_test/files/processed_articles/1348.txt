Another\nimportant purpose of this survey was to estimate the preva-\nlence of a variety of health conditions and risk factors.\nOperationally, NHANES III represented a 6-year study,\nNHANES III collected its data in two 3-year phases because\neach phase was considered nationally representative so that\ninterim analyses could be done when Phase I was com-\npleted. The results presented herein are derived from both\nphases of the NHANES III data collection. Mexican Amer-\nicans, non-Hispanic blacks, and older adults were over-\nsampled in NHANES III to ensure weighted, unbiased es-\ntimates from these particular groups.\nSurvey interviews took place in the participants' homes,\nfollowed 2 to 3 weeks later by a detailed clinical/physical\nexamination conducted in a mobile examination center.\nInterviews and examinations were conducted on 5724 adults\n60 years or older. Interviewers were well experienced, and\nmany were of Hispanic origin or fluent in both English and\nSpanish. All staff underwent yearly training sessions to\nensure quality control.\nStudy Variables\nSelf-reported race and ethnicity were used to classify\nparticipants as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or\nMexican American (i.e., persons of Mexican origin living in\nthe U.S.). Age was defined as the age in years at the time of\nthe household interview and, for analytic purposes, catego-\nDuring the medical examination, height was measured\nusing a stadiometer, and weight was measured on a balance\nbeam scale. Height and weight data were then used to\ncalculate BMI. BMI is largely independent of height (r \nable measure of adiposity (8). Based on the weight classi-\nfications developed by the National Heart Lung and Blood\nInstitute (9), we grouped participants according to six BMI-\n\"obesity class III\").\nParticipants were asked three separate questions to assess\nsignificant knee, hip, and back pain (i.e., \"whether they had\nexperienced significant knee pain on most days over the\npreceding 6 weeks,\" \"whether they had experienced signif-\nicant hip pain on most days over the preceding 6 weeks,\"\nand \"whether they had experienced significant back pain on\nmost days for at least 1 month and have had this pain within\nthe past 12 months\"). The pain-related questions asked in\nNHANES III are well-validated (10).\nStatistical Analysis\nWe performed the statistical analyses using SAS and\nSTATA statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\nFor each survey, we calculated sample weights that took\naccount of the unequal selection probabilities resulting from\nboth the cluster design and the planned over-sampling of\ncertain subgroups. Prevalence estimates were derived and\nare presented for the sex, race, and age categories as de-\nscribed above. All analyses reported have incorporated sam-\npling weights.\nResults\nThe overall prevalences of significant knee, hip, and back\nsents the sex-, race-, and age-specific prevalence estimates\nof older U.S. adults reporting significant knee, hip, or back\npain in each of the six BMI-defined weight classifications\n(see Table 1). For all three sites of pain, prevalence esti-\nmates increased with increased BMI. The relation between\nBMI and pain prevalence was stronger for knee pain (un-\nIn general, the sex-, race-, and age-specific pain preva-\nlence estimates also increased at increased levels of BMI.\nExceptions included: for knee pain, the estimates for men,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans; for hip pain,\nthe estimates for women, non-Hispanic blacks, and those at\n80 years of age; and for back pain, the estimates for\nwomen, non-Hispanic blacks, and those at 80 years of\nage. In these subgroups, we observed roughly J- or U-\nshaped relations between BMI and pain prevalence.\nDiscussion\nThese cross-sectional population-based survey data indi-\ncate that, among adults 60 years and older, the prevalence of\nsignificant knee, hip, and back pain increases markedly with\nincreased BMI. The estimated prevalence of knee pain\nincreased by 44% over the range of BMI (i.e., from 12% for\nunderweight participants to 56% for obesity class III par-\nticipants), and a similar pattern, though not as pronounced,\noccurred with regard to the prevalences of hip and back\npain.\nThis general pattern of findings remained even when we\ncalculated the pain prevalence estimates along the six BMI-\ncategories according to sex-, race-, and age-specific sub-\ngroups. The few exceptions to this pattern tended to show a\nJ-or U-shaped relationship between pain prevalence and\nBMI, that is, higher pain prevalence estimates at the lower\nand higher BMI categories. The reasons for the nonlinear\npattern are unknown but may relate to errors introduced by\nthe self-reporting of pain or sampling variation. Perhaps,\nhowever, for some reason, (e.g., occupational knee de-\nmands, underlying illness), there is a true difference in the\nassociation within the lower and upper BMI categories for\nPain with Weight Gain, Andersen et al.\nTable 1.

Understanding the reasons for these dif-\nferences requires further investigation.\nThe observed BMI-pain associations are consistent with\nwhat has been observed among persons with obesity seek-\ning weight loss using university-based treatments (11,12)\nand in the small body of work (e.g., 13,14) suggesting that\nweight reduction can reduce reports of musculoskeletal\npain.\nIt is important to note that self-reports of pain in\nNHANES III were not verified objectively. Moreover, the\ncross-sectional nature of the NHANES III does not allow us\nto test causal inferences (i.e., determine whether BMI pre-\nceded the pain or vice versa) nor determine whether the\nassociation between weight and pain is mediated by condi-\ntions such as osteoarthritis or diabetic neuropathy. None-\ntheless, one could speculate that, given the established link\nbetween obesity and osteoarthritis of the knee and hip\ning a healthy weight may reduce the prevalence of knee,\nhip, and back pain in older adults. However, whether inten-\ntional weight loss would reduce the prevalence of reports of\nsignificant knee, hip, and back pain in older adults remains\nuncertain.\n"
