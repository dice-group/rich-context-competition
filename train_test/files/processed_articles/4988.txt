The BRS together with measures tapping optimism, self-esteem, pessimism, and physical\nhealth were administered to 547 Hong Kong and 268 mainland Chinese undergraduates. The BRS was found to measure\none single construct and exhibited convergent validity in both samples. Further analyses using a path analytic model showed\nthat the BRS scores substantially mediated the link between the two positive traits (optimism and self-esteem) and physical\nhealth in the two samples.

Resilience research has been extended from its origi-\nnal focus on successful adaptation among children exposed\nto adversities (Cowan, Cowan, & Schulz, 1996) to adult\npopulations, and has more recently encompassed optimal\nfunctioning (Schetter & Dolbier, 2011). Despite the wealth\nof data demonstrating the health and adaptive benefits of\nresilience, issues related to the proper conceptualization of\nthis construct have recently emerged. Resilience has been\noperationalized in at least two ways in the literature. First, it\nhas referred to the possible trajectories (e.g., absence of\nsymptoms or recovery) following exposure to a trauma (e.g.,\nBonanno, 2004; Bonanno, Galea, Bucciareli, & Vlahov,\ndefined as the personal qualities and social resources that\ninfluence the aforementioned trajectories (e.g., Connor &\nDavidson, 2003; Friborg, Hjemdal, Martinussen, &\nRosenvinge, 2009). In other words, the term resilience has\nbeen used to denote both an adaptive outcome and the ante-\ncedents/predictors of that outcome, which is conceptually\nconfusing (Smith, Tooley, Christopher, & Kay, 2010; Smith\net al., 2008). As resilience was originally conceptualized as a\ntrajectory of possible outcomes after exposure to a traumatic\nevent or as a recovery from adversity, it can only be opera-\ntionalized in a longitudinal context in which a person's psy-\nchological response to adversity is monitored over time.\nIndividuals are considered to exhibit resilience if their\npsychological functioning or mental health status returns to\nits preexposure level after a traumatic encounter (e.g.,\nBonanno, 2004). Specific personal qualities and social\nresources may predict who exhibits resilience over time, but\nthese qualities and resources are not identical to outcomes.\nSmith et al. (2008) suggested that it would be more appropri-\nate to consider these qualities and resources as \"resilience\nresources.\" However, most existing measures of resilience\nhave been developed exclusively to assess resilience\nresources rather than outcomes.\nThe Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was developed to mea-\nsure an individual's ability to bounce back or recover from\nered to relate more closely to the original meaning of resil-\nience. The ability to bounce back from stress, or \"resilience,\"\nis conceptually different from \"resilience resources.\"\n\"Resilience\" is oriented toward stress (Smith et al., 2010),\nwhereas \"resilience resources\" such as optimism and self-\nesteem have broader effects because their influences are not\nrestricted to the domain of stress or negative events (Smith &\nthe BRS is a measure of a person's belief in how well he or\nshe can bounce back rather than his or her success in doing\n1City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\nCorresponding Author:\nJulian C.

L. Lai1 and Xiaodong Yue1\n Keywords\nresilience, Brief Resilience Scale, health, Chinese undergraduates\n2 SAGE Open\nso, this belief may serve as a prerequisite of the individual's\nactual ability to bounce back. As such, the effect of the BRS\ncan be considered as analogous to that of self-efficacy mea-\nsures, which involve an individual's beliefs about how well\nhe or she can do something rather than his or her actual\nperformance.\nThe six-item BRS has been shown to be a reliable and\nvalid measure of one's ability to bounce back from stress\nfied by the BRS is not the same as that measured by estab-\nlished scales such as the Connor\u00adDavidson Resilience Scale\n(CD-RISC) and the Ego Resilience Scale, with which it is\nonly moderately correlated (Smith et al., 2008). The BRS\nreliably predicts both affective and physical health measures\nwhen the effects of other resilience resources are controlled\n(Smith et al., 2010). Moreover, the effect of the BRS is more\nconsistent across different health outcomes compared with\nresilience resource measures. In a study conducted by Smith\net al. (2009), higher scores on the BRS were shown to predict\nquicker habituation to heat and cold pain in women, provid-\ning additional support for the validity of the scale.\nResearch related to resilience in Chinese populations has\nemerged only recently. The construct has been operational-\nized as a composite of optimism, self-esteem, and perceived\ncontrol, and has been shown to predict a better response to\nrehabilitation in Chinese cardiac patients (Chan, Lai, &\nWong, 2006) and more adaptive health outcomes in nurses\n(Chan, 2006), and to moderate the effect of daily problems\non the positive well-being of Chinese undergraduates (Lai &\nMak, 2009). Although this operationalization has been\nshown to apply to both Western (e.g., Taylor & Brown, 1988;\nTaylor, Kemeny, Reed, Bower, & Grunenewald, 2000;\nWanberg & Banas, 2000) and Chinese populations (e.g.,\nChan et al., 2006), it tends to obscure the differential contri-\nbutions of the three positive qualities, and is not immune to\nthe problem identified by Smith et al. (2008).\nResilience in Chinese people has also been studied using\nan adapted version of the CD-RISC developed by Connor and\nother resilience measures, the CD-RISC was devised to iden-\ntify the resilience resources that predict a person's adaptive\noutcomes rather than his or her ability to bounce back. Further\nresearch on resilience in Chinese people would be hampered\nwithout a reliable and valid measure of the construct. The\npresent study addresses this issue by validating the BRS\namong Chinese undergraduate participants from Hong Kong\nand Nanjing, China. Comparable Chinese samples were\nrecruited to ensure compatibility. Nanjing University was\nselected for three reasons: (a) both Hong Kong and Nanjing\nare key metropolitan cities in China; (b) the City University\nof Hong Kong and Nanjing University are comparable in\nterms of their rankings among Asian universities, with the\nCity University of Hong Kong ranking 19th and Nanjing\nUniversity ranking 28th according to the Quacquarelli\nand (c) the two universities are located in the center of the city\nand have similarly sized student populations.\nOne's ability to bounce back is different from the resilience\nqualities identified by the conventional measures of resilience.\ndemonstrated this observation, studies have not yet addressed\nthe issue of how such a personal quality is conceptually related\nto resilience resources. As the BRS is supposed to measure\none's ability to bounce back from stress, which is thought to be\naffected by resilience resources (Smith et al., 2008), one of the\nmost reasonable hypotheses is that the ability to bounce back\ncan be treated as a mediator of the link between resilience\nresources and health outcomes. This formulation is also com-\npatible with the core feature of psychological resilience sug-\ngested by cognitive adaptation theory (Taylor & Brown,\n1988), that is, the mobilization and augmentation of personal\nqualities including optimism, self-esteem, and perceived con-\ntrol in response to adversities. The augmentation of these resil-\nience resources potentiates an individual's ability to cope and\nincreases the likelihood that the individual will bounce back\nfrom stress. In other words, resilience resources lead to resil-\nience (the ability to recover from stress) in the individual,\nwhich, in turn, predicts his or her health outcomes. The present\nstudy tests this conjecture using path analysis. Verification of\nthe following hypotheses would lend strong support to the\nvalidity of the construct measured by the BRS.\n1. The BRS items measure one single construct. This is\ntested using exploratory factor analytic procedures.\n2. In terms of convergent validity, the BRS is positively\ncorrelated with measures of optimism, self-esteem,\nand physical health, and negatively correlated with\nmeasures of pessimism.\n3. In terms of incremental utility, BRS scores are able to\npredict a significant proportion of physical health\nvariance beyond that explained by other resilience-\nrelated qualities.\n4. BRS scores mediate the link between resilience\nresources and physical health. In the present study, a\npath model is used to delineate the effects of resil-\nience resources and a person's ability to bounce back\non his or her physical health. As depicted in Figure 1,\nthe ability to bounce back as indexed by the BRS\nscores mediates the effect of the two resilience\nresources (optimism and self-esteem) on an individu-\nal's physical health. These two attributes are consid-\nered because studies have found their reactive\naugmentation and that associated with perceived con-\ntrol to be crucial for successful adaptation to adver-\nMoreover, they form the core components of positive\npsychological capital (e.g., Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &\nNorman, 2007). The latter has been shown to predict\na number of positive organizational outcomes (e.g.,\nLai and Yue 3\nAlthough research conducted under the rubric of resil-\nience has focused on the mental health effects of the con-\nstruct, the present study uses physical health as its outcome\nmeasure for the following reasons. First, the physical health\nbenefits of specific resilience resources have been well docu-\nmented in the literature (e.g., optimism, Rasmussen, Scheier,\n& Greenhouse, 2009; and positive emotions, Tugade,\nFredrickson, & Barrett, 2004). Resilience resources have\nbeen shown to have a smaller effect on physical health than\non mental health, but the effect is consistent and significant\nacross studies (e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2009). The exclusive\nfocus of the resilience research on mental health outcomes is\nnot justified and has created a large knowledge gap, one that\nthe present study attempts to fill by focusing on physical\nhealth outcomes. Second, recent evidence has shown that\nresilience resources are associated with a number of physio-\nlogical benefits that may explain the better physical health of\nresilient individuals. These include a stronger vagal tone\n(Smeets, 2010), faster cardiovascular recovery from labora-\ntory stressors (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004), and lower sali-\nvary cortisol levels in the morning (Lai et al., 2010; Lai et al.,\n2005). This study's focus on physical health addresses an\nissue of growing importance and thus makes a significant\ncontribution to the literature.\nMethod\nParticipants\nHong Kong sample. The Hong Kong sample comprised 198\nmale and 349 female undergraduates recruited from a univer-\nsity in Hong Kong. The mean age of the sample was 21.26\nyears (SD = 1.84 years). The mean age of the male partici-\npants were ethnic Chinese and took part in the study anony-\nmously. The participants were given cash shopping coupons\nof HKD50 each for contributing their time and effort to the\nstudy.\nMainland sample.The mainland sample consisted of 268\nNanjing University in China. The mean age of the sample\nin the Hong Kong sample, they took part in the study volun-\ntarily and anonymously. However, they were given course\ncredits instead of cash coupons in return for their\ncontribution.\nProcedure\nEmail advertisements were sent to undergraduate students\nenrolled in psychology courses at a Hong Kong university\nduring the fall semester of 2009. The experimenter contacted\nstudents who showed interest in taking part in the study and\nbriefed them about its nature and requirements. As a result,\n547 students were recruited and subsequently tested in\ngroups of 5 to 20 throughout the semester. The procedure\nused to recruit the Hong Kong sample was also adopted to\nrecruit participants in Nanjing. Recruitment was conducted\ning to take part.\nThe participants in both samples were asked to complete\na set of questionnaires consisting of the following scales\nwritten in Chinese: (a) the revised Life Orientation Test (Lai,\n2009), (b) the Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ; Ng,\n2007), (c) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES; Cheng &\nHamid, 1995), (d) the Chinese Hopelessness Scale (C-HOPE;\nLai & Yue, 2000), and (e) an adapted version of the BRS.\nThese tests were administered to the two samples in a\nstandardized manner. The experimenter taught the partici-\npants how to fill out the scales to ensure correct completion\nduring each test session. It took each participant an average\nof 20 min to complete the questionnaire. At the end of the\nsession, the participants were debriefed about the nature and\naims of the study and given a chance to ask questions about\nthe tests they had just completed and the research in general.\nThey were then given a shopping coupon of HKD50 (Hong\nKong sample) or course credits (mainland sample) for their\nparticipation.\nMeasures\nResilience.The participants' resilience was measured using\nan adaptation of the BRS developed by Smith et al. (2008).\nThe original English BRS consisted of six items identifying\none's ability to bounce back from stress. As the BRS had\nnever been translated into Chinese, a back-translation proce-\ndure was adopted to translate the six items into Chinese. The\nexperimenter translated the items into Chinese, and a post-\ngraduate psychology student then back-translated them into\nEnglish. The Chinese translations were modified until each\nitem could be properly back-translated into English. To com-\nplete the scale, the participants were asked to indicate the\nextent to which they agreed with each of the six items accord-\ning to a 5-point rating scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 =\nstrongly agree). The BRS was scored by reverse-coding\nFigure 1. Hypothesized path model: Resilience traits, resilience,\nand physical health.\n4 SAGE Open\nItems 2, 4, and 6 and calculating the sum of all six items. The\nscale exhibited acceptable internal consistency in both sam-\nples, with Cronbach's  values equal to .76 and .72 in the\nHong Kong and mainland samples, respectively.\nOptimism. Optimism was measured by a Chinese version of\nthe revised Life Orientation Test (CLOT-R) adapted by Lai\ndifferent Hong Kong Chinese samples. The six-item CLOT-\nR is based on the English version of the revised LOT (Scheier,\nCarver, & Bridges, 1994), with half of the items worded\npositively and the other half worded negatively. All of the\nitems of the adapted scale were back-translated versions of\ntheir corresponding items in the revised English LOT except\nfor the second item, which was developed by Lai (2003) to\nmore precisely reflect a non-expectancy of positive out-\ncomes (\"Looking into the future, I do not see any positive\nscenarios\"). Studies have shown the scale to be internally\nconsistent for Hong Kong Chinese samples, with Cronbach's\nThe respondents rated the extent to which they agreed or\ndisagreed with each of the six items according to a 5-point\nscale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).

The Cronbach's  values were\n.81 for the Hong Kong Chinese undergraduate sample and\n.64 for the mainland sample, which were comparable with\nthe values reported in past studies (Chan et al., 2006; Lai,\nSelf-esteem.Self-esteem was measured using a nine-item\nrevised Chinese version of the Rosenberg SES. One of the\nnegatively worded items, \"I wish I could have more respect\nfor myself,\" was syntactically problematic in Chinese, and\nthe actual meaning was lost due to the differences in syntax\nafter the item was back-translated (Cheng & Hamid, 1995).\nMoreover, this problematic item was the only one that raised\nthe  coefficient when omitted from the calculation, and it\nwas thus excluded. The scale showed a high internal consis-\ntency. Cronbach's  values of .89 and .86 were obtained for\nthe Hong Kong and mainland samples, respectively, which\nwere comparable with those reported in recent studies\ninvolving Chinese cardiac patients (Chan et al., 2006; Cron-\nbach's  = .82) and Chinese undergraduates (Lai & Mak,\nPessimism.\nPessimism was measured according to the\nC-HOPE, adapted by Shek (1995) from the original version\ndeveloped by Beck, Weissman, Lester, and Trexler (1974) to\nmeasure each participant's expectations about himself or\nherself and his or her future life. The scale consists of 11\nitems negatively worded items and 9 positively worded\nitems. The respondents were asked to indicate the extent to\nwhich each item applied to them according to a 6-point scale\n(1 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). The scale was\nscored in the pessimistic or hopeless direction. It exhibited\nacceptable internal consistency with past studies involving\nHong Kong Chinese people (e.g., Cronbach's  values = .88\nof .87 and .85 were obtained in the Hong Kong and mainland\nsamples, respectively.\nPhysical health.Physical health was measured using a Chi-\nnese version of the PHQ (Schat, Kelloway, & Desmarais,\n2005), which was translated from the English version via a\nback-translation procedure used by Ng (2007). The scale\nconsists of 14 items (e.g., \"How often have you experienced\nheadaches?\") that measure four distinct dimensions of\nsomatic symptoms, including sleep disturbances, headaches,\ngastrointestinal problems, and respiratory illness. The\nrespondents were asked to rate the frequency with which\nthey experienced the symptoms on a 7-point frequency scale\nran (1 = not at all; 7 = all the time) in the past month. Except\nfor Item 4 (\"How often has your sleep been peaceful and\nundisturbed?\"), the endorsement of which indicated an\nabsence of symptoms, the scores for the other 13 items, the\nendorsement of which indicated the presence of symptoms,\nwere reversed before scoring. A total PHQ score was calcu-\nlated by adding the Item 4 rating to the ratings of the remain-\ning 13 items. Higher scores generally reflected better physical\nhealth. Studies have demonstrated the PHQ to have an\nacceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's  = .79; Schat et\nal., 2005). The Cronbach's  values of the PHQ in the Hong\nKong and mainland samples were .85 and .78, respectively.\nSchat et al. (2005) showed that the PHQ can measure four\nfactors that correspond to the different aspects of somatic\nsymptoms, including headaches, sleep disturbances, respira-\ntory infections, and gastrointestinal problems. However,\ntheir study also showed that these four factors are subsumed\nunder a single higher order dimension of physical health\n(Schat et al., 2005). In the present study, ratings of the 14\nitems were used to calculate an overall index of somatic\nhealth, and the PHQ was used as a criterion for validating the\nBRS rather than examining the different aspects of physical\nhealth.\nResults\nTable 1 summarizes the means, the standard deviations, and\nCronbach's  values of the scales measuring the two resil-\nience qualities (optimism, self-esteem), pessimism, resil-\nience, and physical health.

Cronbach's  values ranged from\n.64 to .89 in the two samples, indicating internal consistency\namong the scales.\nCronbach's  values of the BRS in the two samples were\n.76 and .72, respectively, which were comparable with those\nreported by Smith et al. (2008). Table 2 inspects the sample\ncorrelations and indicates that the BRS scores were signifi-\ncantly correlated with each of the two resilience resources (rs\nin the predicted directions. This correlation pattern provided\nmodest support for the convergent validity of the BRS in the\ntwo undergraduate samples.\nFactor Structure and Construct Validity\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was conducted for the\nresponses to the six items of the BRS in each of the two sam-\nples. For the Hong Kong sample, a single factor (eigenvalue\nextracted. Inspection of the scree plot also suggested a one-\nand .42). The Kaiser\u00adMeyer\u00adOlkin (KMO) measure (.82)\nthat the correlations among the BRS items were strong\nenough for factor analysis. A similar pattern of results was\nobserved in the Nanjing sample, from which a single factor\nance was extracted. A scree plot of the eigenvalues also sup-\nported a one-factor interpretation (initial eigenvalues = 2.53,\nthe correlation matrix for factor analysis. Table 3 shows the\nPCA loadings of the BRS items for the two Chinese under-\ngraduate samples.\nHierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to\nexamine the incremental utility of the BRS in predicting\nPHQ scores, while controlling for the effects of the two resil-\nience resources. This was also done to show that the BRS\nmeasured a construct that could not be reduced to the two\nresilience resources. The results clearly showed that the BRS\nscores were able to explain a significant portion of the vari-\nance in PHQ scores after the effects of gender, age, and the\ntwo resilience resources were controlled for (Table 4).\nand p < .001. Similar results were found for the Nanjing sam-\nent study, the predictive power of the BRS as indexed by the\nportion of the explained physical health variance (5.4% and\n3.6% in the Hong Kong and Nanjing samples, respectively)\nwas comparable with that reported in prior studies (Nygren\nGender and age also explained a significant percentage of\nthe variance in the Hong Kong sample. However, this was\nnot observed for the Nanjing undergraduates. In particular,\nmale and younger Hong Kong students tended to score\nhigher on the PHQ.\nPath Models\nTo test whether the BRS scores or resilience (one's ability to\nbounce back) mediated the link between resilience resources\nand physical health, the hypothesized path model was tested\nseparately in the Hong Kong and Nanjing samples using path\nanalysis (IBMAMOS 19). First, the model depicted in Figure 1\nwas tested in the Hong Kong sample. Using a maximum like-\nlihood estimation, the model fit was determined to be ade-\n0.996, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) =\n0.04 (Figure 2). As hypothesized, both optimism and self-\nesteem were positively associated with resilience, which\nwas, in turn, positively associated with physical health.\nThese results clearly pointed to an indirect-only mediation\nand suggested that resilience or the ability to bounce back\nwas the most crucial factor translating the two resilience\nqualities into better physical health (Zhao, Lynch, & Chen,\nA similar analysis was conducted for the Nanjing data,\nusing the model delineated in Figure 1. However, an ade-\nrized in Table 4 indicated that the effect of self-esteem on\nphysical health in the Nanjing sample was greater than that\nin the Hong Kong sample, such that the linear relationship\nremained significant in the Nanjing sample after resilience\nwas entered into the regression equation. The path model for\nthe Nanjing sample was then revised by adding a path\nTable 1.

The adapted scale\nwas shown to be a reliable and valid measure for assessing\none's ability to bounce back from stress in two samples of\nChinese undergraduates. The scale items loaded substan-\ntially on one single factor, implying that the scale measured\nthe same construct of resilience in the two samples.\nMoreover, consistent with resilience theories, the ability to\nbounce back mediated the effect of resilience resources such\nas optimism and self-esteem on physical health in the two\nsamples. These findings have two implications. First, the\navailability of the BRS facilitates studies of resilience in\nChinese people. Due to its brevity and ability to mediate the\neffect of resilience resources on health, the adapted BRS\nshould be more suitable for research or screening purposes\nthan either the Chinese version of CD-RISC (Yu & Zhang,\n2007) or a composite of resilience qualities (e.g., Chan et\nthe mechanisms in which resilience resources are translated\ninto better health outcomes. This has not been reported pre-\nviously, and should advance the general understanding of\nresilience. In support of the argument that one's ability to\nbounce back from stress is conceptually distinct from other\ndefinitions of resilience (Smith et al., 2010), the findings of\nthis study clearly show that the construct measured by the\nBRS, one's ability to bounce back from stress, cannot be\nreduced to resilience resources or positive traits. Rather, it is\nmore appropriately conceived as a separate construct that\nmediates the effect of resilience resources on physical\nhealth. Moreover, as this study found one's ability to bounce\nback from stress to be more predictive of physical health, it\nmay be a more important target for interventions than other\npositive characteristics.\nResilience research has focused on mental rather than\nphysical health outcomes, with only a handful of studies\nexamining both the mental and physical health outcomes of\nresilience factors. However, resilience factors have been\nshown to explain a smaller percentage of variance in physi-\ncal health outcomes than mental health outcomes (e.g., 4.7%\neffect of resilience resources on physical health could be\nattributed to the relatively large number of factors that could\ndetermine self-reports of physical health but might not have\nbeen controlled in most studies. These investigators have\nalso pointed out that self-reports of physical symptomatol-\nogy may not be perfect measures of the underlying physio-\nlogical events or symptoms actually experienced. Due to the\nsmall portion of explained variance in physical health\nobserved in our study, we would never claim that the two\nresilience resources and the ability to bounce back from\nstress are the sole determinants of physical health, only that\nthese qualities contribute reliably to the explanation of self-\nreports of physical health, as shown clearly by the results of\nour study.\nAlthough in the present study the BRS explained only a\nsmall portion of the variance in physical health, this study\nmakes contributions that compensate for this limitation.\nFirst, it is one of the few studies to extend the health-related\neffects of psychological resilience to the physical realm.\nFindings have clearly shown that resilience is a crucial vari-\nable in explaining the influence of positive psychological\nattributes on physical health. Second, it is the first study to\nexamine the validity of the BRS in Chinese populations.\nAlthough studies have examined the applicability of other\nresilience measures to Chinese populations (e.g., Wang, Shi,\ncally evaluated the conceptual basis of psychological resil-\nience, as the present study does.\nThe difference in the mediating effect of an ability to\nbounce back from stress between the Hong Kong and\nNanjing samples is worthy of further discussion. Using the\ntypology proposed by Zhao et al. (2010), the former is an\ninstance of \"indirect-only mediation,\" and the latter is a form\nof \"complementary mediation\" (p. 200). This raises the pos-\nsibility that the centrality of self-esteem in determining phys-\nical health might have varied between the two samples. This\nstudy's findings contradict recent evidence of the supremacy\nof self-esteem in determining physical and mental health in\nFigure 2.

For\nthe latter, the ability to bounce back from stress is the more\nappropriate target of intervention.\nDespite the significance of this study's findings, a number\nof limitations may moderate their effects. First, as only opti-\nmism and self-esteem were examined in relation to the BRS\nin this study, it is possible that one's ability to bounce back\nfrom stress could have been reduced to other unconsidered\npositive constructs. Although no Chinese sample data were\navailable to evaluate the validity of this conjecture, Smith et\nal. (2010) showed that BRS scores remained predictive of\ndifferent health outcomes when the effects of a number of\npositive characteristics including optimism, social support,\nmood clarity, spirituality, and purpose in life were controlled.\nTo further establish the importance of resilience in research\ninvolving Chinese populations, future studies must include a\nwider range of positive characteristics and multiple health\noutcome measures. Second, as all of the variables in the pres-\nent study were measured at the same time, the causal rela-\ntionships between the positive traits and health outcomes\nwere not convincingly demonstrated. Third, as the Hong\nKong and Nanjing samples were recruited from a single uni-\nversity in each of the two cities, the representativeness of the\ntwo samples might have been limited. Fourth, this study's\nexclusive focus on undergraduates makes it difficult to\nextend its findings to other age groups or populations with\nhealth problems. To further advance the general understand-\ning of resilience in the Chinese people, future research must\ntake the aforementioned limitations into account and exam-\nine resilience in relation to a wider range of variables in dif-\nferent populations with a longitudinal design.\n"
