    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe November 2014 midterm election was the first election since key coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act\n(ACA) were implemented, including the Medicaid expansion and creation of the health insurance exchanges. The pre-\nelection variability in the states' implementation of these provisions coupled with the large number of states selecting their\nnext governor made the election important at the state level. To better understand the role of health care in the recent\ngubernatorial elections, we analyzed health policy content presented by 71 candidates for governor on their campaign Web\nsites. Nearly 80% of all candidates discussed health policy on their Web site, including the subset of the 36 winning governors.\nThe predominant focus of health policy content was on the ACA as a whole or its provisions. Medicaid was discussed more\noften by candidates in non-expansion states than those from expansion states. Based on the statements of winning governors,\nwe expect serious consideration of the Medicaid expansion to occur in at least 4 states, whereas 2 states may make efforts\nto reverse course. Relatively few winning governors (33%) mentioned the exchanges. Only 1 expressed interest in switching\nfrom the federal exchange to a state exchange, which has particular relevance given the Supreme Court's pending decision on\nKing v. Burwell that could invalidate tax credits on the federal exchange. The prominence of health care in the gubernatorial\ncampaigns strengthens the likelihood that governors will play an influential role in the health system's future, especially as the\nACA undergoes further federal debate.\n",

We sought to answer the following research\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1: What positions did gubernatorial\ncandidates take on the ACA?\nResearch Question 2: Did they support or oppose\nexpanding Medicaid?\nResearch Question 3: Did they support a state or a fed-\neral exchange in their state?\nMethods\nIn October 2014, we reviewed the health policy content on\nthe campaign websites of all candidates running for the 36\ngovernorships (only 1 of the 72 candidates did not have a Web\nsite). From all major party candidates' official campaign Web\nsites, we systematically entered health policy content into a\nREDCap data extraction tool.6 If candidates explicitly pre-\nsented the ACA on their Web sites, we categorized their\nstance as either in favor or opposed to the ACA, recorded the\nreasons offered for any opposition, and if they used the term\nObamacare. We then categorized all candidates' views as\n1Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA\n2Harvard T.H.

Scott, Health Policy, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard\nEmail: kscott@fas.harvard.edu\neither opposed to or supportive of Medicaid expansion in\ntheir state, and similarly classified whether they planned to\nchange their state's current exchange design (eg, from state to\nfederal). Our primary analysis categorized our findings for\nthe 36 winning candidates, stratified by political party; sec-\nondary analyses also considered losing candidates. We used\nchi-square, and Fisher exact tests when appropriate, to com-\npare outcomes by political party.\nLimitations\nOur focus on governors is strategic given their unique, visi-\nble role in shaping their state's policy agenda.3,7,8 They can,\nhowever, be constrained by other state actors.7,9,10\nNonetheless, their campaign statements may be indicative of\ntheir willingness to facilitate (or oppose) changes to health\nreform in their state.11 In addition, campaign Web sites are a\ngrowing source of political data for capturing candidates'\nissue positions. Although they are imperfect, studies have\nshown that they are reliable source for capturing a candi-\ndate's policy views and comparable with other campaign\ncommunication that disproportionately favors well-funded\nResults\nhealth care on their campaign Web sites, with the predomi-\nnant focus being the ACA or its coverage provisions.\nRepublicans who mentioned the law overwhelmingly (90%)\nreferred to it as \"Obamacare,\" whereas not a single winning\nDemocrat used this term (though 4 losing Democrats did so).\nAmong the winning governors, only 3 of 12 Democrats/\nIndependent expressed favorable views on the ACA per se\nwhereas the majority of the 24 Republican governors (62%)\nindicated opposition to the law (see Table 1). The top reasons\nfor ACA opposition that these 24 Republicans offered were\nthat it was \"a failure\" (53%), represented federal overreach\ninto states (47%), raised premiums (47%), or caused plan\ncancellations (40%).\nMedicaid Expansion\nMedicaid expansion was explicitly mentioned more by\nDemocrats (49%) than Republicans (28%), especially those\nDemocrats who lost in the 15 non-expansion states with elec-\ntions. Among the 21 expansion states with elections, only 6\nwinning candidates (4 Democrats, 2 Republicans) discussed\nthis policy (29%). Both Arizona and Arkansas elected new\nRepublican governors who expressed willingness to shift\naway from traditional expansion under the ACA. In contrast,\nPennsylvania's new governor criticized his Republican pre-\ndecessor's plan to expand private coverage and instead\nfavored a traditional expansion. Among non-expansion states\nwith governors' races, Republican candidates won 14 of the\n15 elections. Half of the winning governors in these states\nmentioned Medicaid expansion on their Web sites, mostly\nreiterating opposition to expansion. But the governors of\nWyoming and Tennessee supported customized expansion\noptions as did Alaska's newly elected Independent governor.\nExchanges\nLess than one third of all candidates--regardless of political\nparty--mentioned health insurance exchanges on their Web\nsites. Among the winning candidates who discussed\nexchanges, 33% generally supported the current arrange-\nment in their state, though 2 operating state-based exchanges\nexpressed concerns with its rollout. Only 1 of the 17 gover-\nnors in states using the federal exchange (Pennsylvania)\nexpressed support for switching to a state-based exchange.\nDiscussion\nAlthough some suggested that the ACA would fade as an\nissue once the law was implemented,17 we find evidence that\nthe health reform law--and health policy more broadly--\nwas an important issue discussed on most candidates' cam-\npaign Web sites. However, opponents of the law were much\nmore vocal than supporters of the law. Republican governors\nwere more likely to mention their opposition to the ACA\n(\"Obamacare\") whereas Democrats distanced themselves\nfrom the law and generally did not mention it explicitly.\nWe also observed different strategic choices from the 2\nparties regarding the Medicaid expansion, in part depending\non each state's expansion status.18 Few winning governors\nfrom expansion states discussed this policy. For Republican\ncandidates, this likely reflects not only a balancing\nact between the ACA's general unpopularity with their\nconstituents2,19 but also potential political consequences of\ntaking away a tangible benefit that has already been given\nand is popular among those who have received it.18,20 Facing\nthese 2 alternatives, it was easiest for many Republicans sim-\nply not to discuss Medicaid at all. Republican candidates\nfrom Arizona and Arkansas, however, challenged this notion\nas they stated their intentions to potentially reverse course on\nthe Medicaid expansion. Meanwhile, Democrats in expand-\ning states avoided discussing the expansion, likely due to the\nongoing divided public opinion about the law.19\nIn non-expansion states, candidates from both parties dis-\ncussed Medicaid more frequently. Republicans won over\n90% of these elections and generally continued to oppose\nexpansion, overcoming Democratic candidates' efforts to\nmake the expansion a prominent campaign issue.3,21\nHowever, winning Republican candidates in 2 states\n(Tennessee and Wyoming) expressed plans to explore\nMedicaid expansion options even while expressing strong\nopposition to the ACA, likely in an attempt to balance their\nstates' politically hostile environment toward the ACA with\nScott et al 3\nFinally, we found little evidence that the exchanges were\na prominent election topic. However, days following the\nelection, the Supreme Court announced its decision to hear\nthe King v. Burwell case, which brings uncertainty to the\nTable 1.

The campaign positions expressed by the 36 win-\nning governors indicate that many of them--especially\nRepublicans--are willing to spend political capital to shape the\nACA's future in their state. Although several may expand\nMedicaid, others may reverse course. Finally, the stakes for\nstate-based decision making regarding the ACA will only\nincrease if the Supreme Court rules against the administration in\nKing v. Burwell. Overall, our results suggest that the ACA\nremains a hot-button issue for policymakers and worth studying\nas an election issue in forthcoming campaigns--both among\nstate and federal leaders, legislators, and executives alike.\nAuthors' Note\nDr. Sommers currently serves part-time as an advisor in the Office\nof the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, at the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS).
