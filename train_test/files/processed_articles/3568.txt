For this reason, some are of the view that the Yorubas are deeply spiritual.\nIn addition to the generally celebrated festivals among the Yorubas, each Yoruba tribe has its own festivals.

It analyzes the early beginnings of the\nfestival while providing insights into the epoch of the Ijebus.

The Yorubas\nhave a very rich culture with a strong spiritual background.\nThese cultural wealth and spiritual beliefs are exhibited dur-\ning their festive periods. Although there are festivals cele-\nbrated in all the Yoruba communities, some are peculiar to\ncertain Yoruba communities. These festivals are often staged\non an annual basis. One of the most popular festivals peculiar\nto the Ijebu-speaking community, a subgroup of the Yoruba\nethnic group, is the Ojude Oba (the frontage of the king) fes-\ntival, which is an annual event. The festival celebrates some\nof the unique features of the community such as their aes-\nthetic taste in clothes, music, costumes, food, and so on.\nPeople of all cultures celebrate festivals unique to their\nculture and customs. Festivals serve as a means of commu-\nnity assembly and unity. They are also a way of placing the\npeople at the heart of their culture and social environment.\nOwusu-Frempong (2005) in one of his articles noted that\nAfrican festivals are \"medium of cultural education and\nintergenerational communication and play an important role\nin the preservation of our cultural heritage, transmitting\nknowledge and our experiences as a people to future genera-\ntions\" (p. 730). The Ojude Oba serves all these functions,\nand in addition, it plays a religious role in the life of the peo-\nple of the community.\nThe Ijebu Kingdom\nThe Ijebus are located in the south-central part of\nSouthwestern Nigeria, regarded as Yorubaland. Ijebuland is\nbordered in the north by Ibadan, in the east by Ondo and\nOkitipupa, and the west by Egbaland (Sote, 2003). The\nsouthern border is close to the sea with the coastlines of Epe,\nIbeju-Lekki, and Ikorodu. Although the people have always\nregarded themselves as one, modern Nigeria political divi-\nsion has placed three Ijebu-speaking local government coun-\ncil areas (Epe, Ibeju-Lekki, and Ikorodu) in Lagos State,\nwhereas the larger part of Ijebuland is in Ogun State\nThere are legends that link the Ijebus to biblical Jebusites\nand Noah (Ijebu Kingdom, 2012). For this reason, the Ijebus\ncall themselves \"Omoluwabi\"--omoti Noah bi--\"the chil-\ndren of Noah,\" but this is a claim quite difficult to prove. The\nterm Omoluwabi is also said to have come from omo-olu-\niwa-bi (\"the child or children born of Olu-Iwa\"). The refer-\nence to Olu-Iwa can be found in the document given to the\nlocal British official in 1937 by Ijebu Ode community lead-\ners. The document states that the king of Ile-Ife gave his\ndaughter Gborowo as wife to Olu-Iwa. The marriage resulted\nin the birth of Ogborogan, which was the nickname (a dis-\nused term for addressing the king) of Obanta (the progenitor\nof Ijebu Kingdom; Oduwbi, 2006).1 A British officer in\n1906 quoted local sources who mentioned that the word\nIjebu was coined from the name of two of three brothers\nAjebu and Olode (the third was Osi who became the first\n1University of Ilorin, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nAbdulGafar Olawale Fahm, Department of Religions, University of Ilorin,\nIlorin, Nigeria.\nEmail: iwalewaolawale@gmail.com\nIjebu Ode's Ojude Oba Festival: Cultural\nand Spiritual Significance\nAbdulGafar Olawale Fahm1\n Keywords\nIjebu Ode, Ojude Oba, Africa, Nigeria, culture, religion\n2 SAGE Open\nking of Ijebu, but he later abdicated for Obanta--eldest son\nof the king of Ife--on his arrival).

Ijebu Ode is\nless in the center of the most densely settled districts of the\nIjebu province, which occupy south-central Western Nigeria.\nIt is the headquarters of the Ijebu and is surrounded by a ring\nThe Ijebus have their own dialect, and cultural and insti-\ntutional identity. The Agemo3 and Osugbo4 play important\npolitical and judicial roles. The most prominent institution is\nthe Awujaleship. The Awujale is the office of the king of\nIjebuland. The Awujale's role is to provide spiritual lordship\nin its relationship with various districts. The main city or the\ncapital of Ijebuland is Ijebu Ode. The people of Ijebu Ode\nsometimes regard themselves as the \"super Ijebus\" and see\nother areas as rural inhabitants. It is in Ijebu Ode that the\nOjude Oba (the frontage of the king) festival is held.\nIslam in Ijebuland\nIslam came to Ijebuland around 1879 during the reign of\nAwujale Afidipote (d. 1885), through an Ilorin slave servant\nof Tubogun, a merchant from the Porogun ward of Ijebu\nOde. The slave servant's name was 'Ali. Tubogun gave 'Ali\nthe freedom to worship in any manner his religion dictated to\nhim. He later took his master's name and became 'Ali\nTubogun (Botu, 1937). According to another account, Islam\nentered Ijebuland through Epe. This was as a result of Epe's\ncontact with Islam during the 1851 exile of Oba Kosoko and\nFigure 1.

While in Epe, Salu and his followers continued the\nproselytization of their faith, which later reached the Ijebu\nEpe areas, a hitherto secluded coastal town with link to\nIn another historical account, a trader from Gbogunja in\nIsale Iwade, with the name 'Ali Akayinode came in contact\nwith some Ilorin Muslims during his many travels outside\nIjebu Ode. He learnt from them about the religion and kept\nit private to himself, but on hearing about 'Ali Tubogun and\nhis strange religion, he decided to befriend him to learn\nmore. The friendship also emboldened Akayinode to discuss\nthe message of his new faith among his friends in his com-\nmunity. The coming together of the freeborn and slave ser-\nvant changed the people's perception of the religion; soon\nfriends of 'Ali Akayinode joined him and the congregational\nprayers were held in his house. Later, a suggestion came\nfrom one of the new members that the Muslim call to prayer\n(Azn) be made. The call drew the attention of the king's\ntraditional priests (Odis).6 The Odis protested and most pro-\ntest from the Odis often led to grave consequences.\nAkayinode had to leave the town as soon as he received the\nmessage that the Odis were coming for him. He returned to\nIjebuland 6 years later after receiving the news that the\nreigning Awujale had a free disposition to the religion\n(Abdul, 1967). As time went by, the number of the Muslims\nin the community increased with some of the closest allies\nverting to the religion. While Akayinode was away, Sanni\nOboromboro filled the vacuum, and also bought an Ilorin\nslave with the name Ilyas to teach the faith to the new\nMuslims. On Akayinode's return, Oboromboro abdicated\nthe seat of Imam for Akayinode. Oboromboro's reason for\ntaking such action was that Akayinode was more knowl-\nedgeable and older than him.\nLater on, the need arose for an Eid prayer ground and a\nrequest was made to the Awujale. He granted the request and\ndirected that a piece of land around the eastern outskirt of the\ntown be given to the Muslims. The first Eid was said to have\nbeen celebrated with great pomp and pageantry, as members\nof Imam Akayinode's age group rode on horses to and fro the\nEid prayer ground (Botu, 1937). As the number of Muslims\nincreased, a request was again sent to Awujale Atunwase for\na central piece of land that would be dedicated for the Friday\ncongregational prayer. The king granted the request, and the\nEtital central mosque currently stands on the land. Few days\nlater, representatives from the Muslim community were sent\nto the Awujale to express the Muslims' gratitude for the\nking's support and kindness. It was at this occasion that one\nof the eminent personalities of the community (Chief Kuku\nOduyingbo and later Balogun Kuku), impressed by the\nMuslim gestures, donated five shillings toward the building\nof the proposed masjid. He also decided to join the religion.\nBalogun Kuku embracing the faith marked an important\nturning point in the history of Islam in Ijebuland, as multi-\nHistorical Background of Ojude Oba\nOjude Oba which means, \"the king's fore-court or frontage,\"\ncould also be translated as \"majestic outing.\" The Ojude Oba\nfestival in Ijebu Ode is known to the Ijebus as a major festi-\nval that brings them together. The native age groups (reg-\nberegbe), indigenes, their friends, and associates from far\nand near throng the palace of the Awujale of Ijebuland for the\ncarnival-like celebration. The festival is celebrated on the\nthird day after Id-El-Kabir. Ojude Oba is one of the most\nglamorous cultural and spiritual festivals in Ijebuland and in\nOgun State in general. This is a celebration that has tradi-\ntional, cultural, religious, social, and military significance. It\nhas been celebrated for more than 100 years.\nAccording to oral historical accounts, the festival began\nwhen Balogun Kuku, one of the leading personalities in the\ncommunity, accepted Islam. He decided to gather his friends,\nfamilies, and well-wishers to pay homage to the king for giv-\ning them the opportunity to practice their religion peacefully\n(Balogun Kuku, n.d.). In another account, the festival was said\nto have started when Imam Tunwatoba led his friends and\nfamily members to pay homage to his friend, who was also the\nAwujale of Ijebuland, Oba Fidipote during the eid-l-adha fes-\ntival. Imam Tunwatoba thanked the king for being instrumen-\ntal to the freedom enjoyed by the Muslims in the community\nto practice their faith in a peaceful atmosphere (Babatunde,\n2007). They prayed for the monarch to enjoy a long life, good\nhealth, and for the progress and prosperity of Ijebuland. Since\nthen, what began as a visit has grown in leaps and bounds to\nassume the status of a flagship cultural festival.\nThe Festival\nThe glitz and colors associated with the festival rank among\nthe most celebrated cultural festivals in Nigeria. Ijebu sons\nand daughters, Muslim and non-Muslim, always look for-\nward to this event. It is an agelong tradition. The ceremony\ntakes place every year on the third day of eid-l-adha, when\nMuslims and non-Muslims go to the Awujale palace, singing\nand dancing with the principal chiefs of the town and riding\non horses to pay homage to the Awujale, no matter his reli-\ngious affiliation. What is important is that he sits on the\nthrone throughout the length of the ceremony to receive his\npeople (Danmole, 2008). Different age groups in specially\ntailored dresses dance around the town (Oladipupo, 1967).\nAlthough the festival began as purely a Muslim affair, it has\nover the years acquired new meaning as it now embraces fea-\ntures of local traditions (Danmole, 2008).\nThe Ojude Oba festival normally begins with prayers by\nthe Imam of Ijebuland, followed by the National Anthem,\nOgun state Anthem, and the Awujale Anthem, and finally the\nlineage praise of the Ijebus. The Awujale anthem goes thus:\nKaabiyesi o (2ce)\nAlaiye Oba wa,\n4 SAGE Open\nK'adepel'ori o\nkibatape lese,\nk'adepel'ori.\nK'odigbapel'orun,\nKi Oba petiti,\nKi ijobatuwalara,\nkaabiyesi o.\nOba waoninu re.\nAfter the anthems and lineage praise, the parade of differ-\nent ages in the community known as Regberegbe begins. The\nage grade societies were established in the 18th century.\nWompari is the general name given to all the age grade soci-\neties. Some of the age grades are Egbe Gbobaniyi male and\nEgbe Bobakeye, and Egbe Bobagbimo. All the age grades\npresent their special gift to the king as they parade (see\nThe Wompari is a unique and agelong institution, designed\nto wield the society into age groups, male and female, and for\nbringing development and progress to the community. Most\nof these groups comprise heads of industries, top managers,\nand chief executive officers. They dance before the king one\nafter the other. Each group is expected to clad in the latest\nfashion. They file past in turn with their drummers to pay\nhomage to the king.\nDuring the 1-day event are the glowing tributes of a festi-\nval that is responsive to social trends, while retaining the tra-\ndition of having different age groups to entertain and renew\ntheir allegiance to the traditional ruler. It is usually a dance,\nbut more importantly, a dance with meaning. Each age group\ndisplays at the expansive lawn that separates the king and his\nguests from the crowd. That makes the festival an inspiring\nexperience.\nThe Ojude Oba festival has always had enough visual\npleasantries for every visitor. Some of the attractions are the\nbeauty of a group of people in the same age group coming\ntogether in service of their motherland. Many of the groups'\nnames are related to the king such as Obafuwaji, Bobakeye,\nGbobayo, Gbobaniyi, and Gbobalaye (see Figure 5).\nEach of these groups has its uniqueness, either in the man-\nner of appearance, style of dressing, or dance pattern. The\nGbobaniyi comprises young middle-age men, and has\nGovernor Gbenga Daniel as its patron (2004-). They make\nFigure 3.

They all hold walking sticks and dance like con-\nquerors. The Bobagbimo, true to the group's name, always\nappear in learned and cerebral attire. The group has little of\ndance and pleasantries but more of grins, nods, and prayers.\nGaiety and dance are the hallmarks of the all-female\nGbobaleye, which has the Waka Music Superstar, Queen\nSalawa Abeni, as one of its prominent members. The parade\nof the Baloguns and Eleshins is usually the most colorful and\nbreathtaking event of the festival.\nA Balogun or an Eleshin is a direct descendant of the war\nheroes who gained notable victories for the Ijebu during the\ninter-ethnic Yoruba wars in the pre-colonial history of\nNigeria. It is commonly believed that it was at Ojude Oba\nthat the families of the war heroes led by the reigning\nBalogun and deputies exhibited their equestrian prowess by\nsimulating mock battle shows and displays (see Figures 6\nIt is always a performance to behold when each Balogun\nand Eleshin family takes its turn to pay homage to the king\namid martial music, jubilation, and hilarity of an estimated\ncrowd of over one million both at the palace square and\nthrough the town including participants, visitors, and tour-\nists. This was what made Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona to\ndescribe the Ojude Oba day as the Ijebus' national day.\n\"Ojude Oba is now maturing into a world class event. It has\nall the ingredients of uniqueness and greatness\" (Okoli,\nArtistic Beauty of the Ojude Oba\nFestival\nArt plays a significant role in the Ojude Oba festival. It is one\nof the reasons people from completely different cultural set-\ntings find the festival very interesting. While looking at the\nartistic beauty of Ojude Oba, we would take into consider-\nation the manner of dressing of the different age groups,\nmusic and musical instruments, the design on the horses of\nthe Balogun families, the pattern of the banners and fans\nused in the ceremony, and so on.\nDressing\nIn many Yoruba societies, dresses or the traditional robes\nplay important roles in ceremonies. It is one of the ways to\ndisplay one's economic status within the society. In Ojude\nOba, the age grades try to beat one another through the kind\nof dress they wear. Therefore, it is not surprising when we\nsee different age grades dressed in the most expensive kinds\nof cloth known to the people of the community.\nIn the age grade that comprises men and women, all are\nsupposed to dress in the same pattern of cloth. The sheer\nimpact of bulk and color and stripes created by an assem-\nblage of individuals in close proximity, each person robed in\nidentical pattern and hue, is indeed considerable. The attire\nworn in the previous festival would not be repeated in the\nnext festival. This is to show their economic status and\nwealth and make a statement that they are doing fine in their\nage grade. Most often, it is an entirely different dress that\nwould be worn in the next Ojude Oba. The difference would\nnot only be in color but also in style.\nTraditionally, the favorite colors of the Yoruba are tan, the\nrich natural tone of the silk known as sanyan, and blue, rang-\ning from the palest to the deepest blue black obtainable from\nthe indigo dye pots. Reds and an occasional yellow are also\ntraditional preferences. More recently, however, innovations\nin pattern and hue have come to be prized, so that there is a\nmore varied palette and an increased reliance on commer-\ncially manufactured yarns rather than dependence on hand-\nspun and locally dyed weaves. This is why today, some age\ngrades would wear agbada (big overall cloth for men), laced\nwith green damask.\nIn one of the previous Ojude Oba festivals, all the age\ngrades wore the same pattern of cloth; the only difference\nFigure 6. The Eleshin age grade entering the parade ground.\nFigure 7. One of the heads of the Balogun family on his way to\nthe Ojude Oba festival.\n6 SAGE Open\nwas the color of caps for men and the headgear of the ladies.\nThe reason for this was that that year's festival was used to\ncampaign for the creation of an Ijebu state for the Ijebu peo-\nple. On the cloth worn by the age grades, the Ijebu state was\nwritten all over it (see Figures 8-10).\nMusic and Musical Instruments\nMusic is an important part of the Ojude Oba festival and\namong the Yorubas, traditional music can to a certain degree\nbe described as music drama. The dramatic aspect of this\nmusic is given its highest expression in situations of a cere-\nmonial nature in which music, dance, speech, physical move-\nment, costume, and art objects all combine to constitute a\ncomplete performance (Euba, 1970). In Ojude Oba, all these\nare combined to the fullest and are part of what makes the\nfestival memorable. Popular musicians within the country as\nwell as those who are from Ijebuland, such as Salawa Abeni\nand Wasiu Ayinde Marshal among others, are also invited to\nMusical instruments used during the festival are another\naesthetic part of the celebration. There are various types of\ndrums such as Agere, Aran/Ipese, Igbin, Bata, Dundun. Also,\nthere is the s\u00e8k\u00e8r\u00e8 (a netted bottle gourd that rattles), which is\nFigure 8.

At the background is a drummer with the Bata drum.\noften used in a wide range of traditional Yoruba praise songs\nand social dance styles (Waterman, 1990).Anewly introduced\ninstrument however is the trumpet (see Figures 13 and 14).\nBanners/Emblems\nAnother interesting aspect of the festival is the various ban-\nners and emblems that signify those who are present to honor\nthe king depending on what is written on the banner. The\nbanners/emblems come in various colors and sizes. The pop-\nular colors are black and brown, but there are also pink, pur-\nple, red, and yellow. The Balogun Kuku family uses brown,\nwhereas theAlausa uses black. Some of the banners/emblems\nare decorated with wool whereas others are decorated with\nfeathers. Most of the banners have the name of the family\nwritten on them, with images of horses and the crown in\nThe Horses\nThe excessive decoration of the stallion horses is another\ninteresting thing about the festival. Everything about the\nhorse is decorated, from the head to its hoof. After all the\ndecorations on the horses are done, one finds it difficult to\nFigure 13. Three S\u00e8k\u00e8r\u00e8 can be seen in the figure.\nFigure 14. Three trumpets can be seen in the figure.

Almost all col-\nors can be found in the decoration of the horses. They also\nuse cloths that have beads on them to create a glittering\neffect. This is why for most people, the parade of the\nBaloguns (warlord) is the most interesting part of the festival\nThe Mock War\nLooking at the life of the Yorubas, one will quickly notice\nhow entertainment is injected into almost every facet of their\nlife. From the naming ceremony to burial ceremony, from\nconferment of chieftaincy title to festivals, just name it and\none will find entertainment and drama. The mock war is a\nsignificant part of the festival. All the Baloguns/Eleshins\ntake part in this show. In fact, movie actors sometimes not\nfrom Ijebuland are invited to take part. The sound of Dane\nguns and various kinds of hunters' guns are heard by all the\nspectators. Furthermore, to show their skills in riding horses,\nthe horses are made to dance and perform various kinds of\ntricks like standing on their hind legs and so on.

It includes customs characterizing a social group;\nsocial heredity of a particular community; meaning, values,\nnorms, their actions and relationships; beliefs, laws, traditions\nand institutions; religions, ritual, language, song dance, feast,\nliving habits, crafts, equipment. (p. 7)\nGoing by the above definition, culture entails all facets of\nhuman endeavor. It is a long-term process that is transferred\nfrom one generation to another. Culture varies from one soci-\nety to another. It is life in all its totality, it is not static; it\nchanges from time to time. AYoruba festival like Ojude Oba\nhas a socio-cultural importance. The festival has been used\nas a means of projecting the image of the Yoruba in general\nand the Ijebus in particular.\nThe Ojude Oba gives the Ijebus an opportunity to renew\ntheir allegiance to their king every year they return home\nfrom different places within and outside Nigeria. During the\nfestival, they express their support for the king and wish him\na peaceful tenure.\nAnother cultural significance is that the festival serves\nas an avenue for people to serve their motherland. The\nking in one of his speeches after the festival acknowl-\nedged the contributions of the age grades to his domain\nwhen he said,\nWe are pleased to observe the positive contributions that our\nunique regberegbe institution continues to make to the\ndevelopment of Ijebuland. We are pleased to see a healthy\nrivalry among them in their efforts to do something tangible for\nour society so as to immortalise their names in the annals of\nThe festival also promotes cultural contact. The festival is\nusually graced by people from all works of life. Other ethnic\ngroups in Nigeria also participate in the festival whereas\npeople from neighboring countries are not left out. This has\npromoted peace, tranquility, and harmony, which contribute\nto socio-economic development and integration.\nThe festival also signifies Yoruba flair for traditional\nattire. A typical Yoruba man wears gbariye, agbada, and\ndansiki for social activities whereas the women tie their iro,\nbuba, iborun, and ipele. These clothes show the beauty of the\nYoruba culture. More so, music, dance, and drums are an\nintegral part of the Yoruba culture. There is no occasion in\nYorubaland that is not accompanied by music; each festival\nhas its peculiar music, be it religious or social. Music brings\nlife and meaning to cultures and traditions (Jekayinfa, 2002).\nMusic, dress, chieftaincy titles, and respect for the monarch\nare carried over from the African culture, which the Ojude\nOba festival depicts.\nSpiritual Significance of the Festival\nIslam is a religion brought to Yorubaland through the efforts of\nHausa-Fulani jihadist (Gbadamosi, 1978). Since the advent of\nthe new faith, it has had a great impact on the norms, customs,\nand traditions of our society. Part of Islam influence on\nAfrica is that, there emerged a number of festivals which\nhave gained prominence over the traditional ones.\nIn the history of Islam, as Islam began to spread far and wide\ninto various foreign lands, strange and new ideas began to\nappear amongst the new Muslims. These ideas were foreign to\nthe Muslims of Arabia who had received their Islamic education\nthrough the pure teachings of the prophet's companions. Many\nof those who had accepted would often maintain certain beliefs\nand superstitions that were present in their societies and culture\nbefore their conversions to Islam. (p. 4)\nA festival like Ojude Oba is an aspect of African culture\nimported to Islam. Primarily, the spiritual significance is\nderived from the origin and aim of the festival. It was started\nby Muslims during their eid-l-adha, which is considered one\nof the important events for Muslims.\nFurthermore, the festival is seen as a continuation of the\neid-l-adha celebration by the Muslims in the community, as\nit is held on the third day of Eid. The festival is not only cel-\nebrated by Muslims; Christians as well as people from other\nfaiths join the Muslims in this celebration. The Ojude Oba\nfestival encourages peaceful co-existence of people of differ-\nent faiths. More so, the festival always begins with an open-\ning prayer by the Imam of Ijebuland. As such, the festival\nserves as an avenue to pray for the king, his members of cabi-\nnet, the people, and community as a whole.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have attempted to expound, albeit briefly,\nthe guiding beliefs of the Ijebu people with regard to the cel-\nebration of the Ojude Oba festival. The festival, it should be\nnoted, finds its basis in the people's belief in honoring the\nparamount ruler of Ijebuland. It is also a time for the people\nto display their aesthetic taste in fashion. The artistic and cre-\native talents of the people in terms of dressing, drama, music,\nand oral communication are also put into great use.\nHowever, beneath the hustle and bustle, and sparked dis-\nplay of colors of this traditional festival, one can discern its\nattendant religiocultural significance. Through this festival,\nthe people are not just entertained but the religious and cul-\ntural values find an outlet too. In addition, it is also the time\nmost Ijebu people come home to celebrate and reconnect to\ntheir roots, reflecting the religious, social, and cultural\nresponsiveness on the part of the people.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.

Samuel Johnson's The History of the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1s (written\ntraditions of servile origins for the Ijebus. One account was\nthat the Ijebus ancestors were \"victims offered in sacrifice by\nthe King of Benin to the god of the ocean, hence the term \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fa\nfrom Ije-ibu, i.e., the food of the deep\" (Johnson, 1921, p. 18).\nThe second account states that Obanta was actually a victim\nof sacrifice made by the Olowu of Owu. Obanta was expected\nto have died after the sacrifice, but survived, and later went on\nto establish the Ijebu kingdom. Thus, Oduwbi observes that\n\"to counter the notion of servile origins, a rebuttal seemed to\nhave been contrived that conceived the \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fa as om\u00f3l\u00f9w\u00e0b\u00ed,\nthe traditional Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 term for the freeborn, as distinct from\neru, the slave. For a morphological breakdown of the term,\nml\u00f9w\u00e0b\u00ed (m -ol\u00fa-iwa-b\u00ed) could literally be translated\nas `the child/children born of Ol\u00fa-Iwa.' The name Ol\u00fa-Iwa\nwould therefore appear to have been adopted from om\u00f3l\u00f9w\u00e0b\u00ed\nto discount any suggestion of the \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fa as an inferior Yor\u00f9b\u00e1\nsubgroup. It is within this context that claims of a consanguin-\neous relationship between Ol\u00fa-Iwa and banta . . . are also\npresumably to be understood. Equally worthy of mention is\nthe claim in the 1937 document that Oduduwa prognosticated\nthat banta's `kingdom shall . . . become great, and neither he\nnor his people shall be slaves to any man.'This was fulfilled, it\nis further stated, for `the \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fas were never made slaves . . .' It\nmay therefore be suggested that `Ol\u00fa-Iwa' is a fictitious char-\nacter invented as a response to Johnson's The History of the\nYorubas; and hence the absence of the name in local historical\n2. However, there is a strong evidence of the existence of the city\nPortuguese captain, explorer, soldier, and cartographer wrote,\n\"twelve or thirteen leagues up this river [i.e. the Lagos lagoon]\nis a very large city called Geebuu, surrounded by a great moat.\nThe ruler of this country in our time is called Agusale [i.e.\nAwujale], and the trade is mainly in slaves . . . but there is some\n3. The Agemo cult is one of the traditional institutions that unite\nall Ijebu lands. This is why one of the appellations of the Ijebus\nis Ijebu Omo Alagemo merindinlogun meaning \"Ijebu child of\nthe sixteen Agemos.\" There are three very important priests\nof Agemo and the most notable can be said to be the Oliwo\nAgbadagbodo. The Agemo represents continuity and survival\nand is in charge of protecting the community from external\naggression.\n4. This is the society of community elders. They are venerated\nbecause of the belief in their closeness to the ancestors. They\nhave immense knowledge and wield significant power within\nthe community.\n5. AlthoughAbdul (1967) believes this is highly unlikely because\n\"the Muslim leaders in Epe who were certainly strangers had\nneither the cause nor the courage to extend their activity to\nIjebu Ode; so, the possibility of introducing Islam to Ijebu Ode\nfrom Epe seems very remote. Because of this exclusiveness of\nIjebu Ode to strangers it appears that the only one who could\ncarry on any activity in Ijebu Ode should be one who had\ngained entry, unqualified one, to the town and had also been\nresident there\" (p. 22).\n6. The Odis likened the sound to the one made by the Oro (a spirit\ngod worshipped among the Yorubas and who resides in the\nbush). The shrill sound or voice of the Oro is said to emanate\nfrom \"bull roarer\" who is the representative of the god.\n7. Balogun Kuku was said to declare that he was a Muslim on the\nday he opened his new house, which has a mosque attached\nto it, in 1902. He called the building \"Olorunsogo\" (\"God\nis Wonderful\"). Guests were invited from Lagos, Abeokuta,\nIlorin, Ibadan, and Epe, and among them was also a sheriff\nfrom Cairo. His declaration before a mammoth crowd also\nled about 300 persons to declare for Islam on the same day.\nThey were not just ordinary Ijebu citizens but also impor-\ntant dignitaries of the community such as 'Abbs Odunsi,\n'Abbs Odejayi (the Otun Balogun), Giwa Kuye of Gbogunja,\nSumonu Apapalolaiye of Imose, 'Al Luyadi, Ajayi Logun,\n'Al Omoba, Bello Odedina, and the entire members of Egbe\nimmediate junior age group (Egbe Bobajolu, born between\n8.
