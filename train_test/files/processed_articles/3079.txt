The study cohort com-\nin the First National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey and its follow-up study.

Similar results were found for\nfatal CVA.\nConclusion: Periodontal disease is an important risk fac-\ntor for total CVA and, in particular, nonhemorrhagic\nstroke.\nTHE ROLE of infection in the\netiology of atherosclerosis\nand the development of car-\ndiovascular disease has re-\ncently received consider-\nable attention.1 Periodontal disease, one\nof the most common human infections, has\nbeen found to be a risk factor for coro-\nnary heart disease in a number of stud-\nies.2-9 However, the association between\nperiodontal disease and the risk for cere-\nbrovascular accident (CVA) is much less\nstudied. The purpose of this study was to\nexamine the association between base-\nline periodontal status and subsequent in-\ncidence and mortality of CVA in a repre-\nsentative sample of US adults.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the study cohort are\ngiven in Table 1.

The mortality rates per 1000 person-\nyears were 1.8 for total CVA, 1.4 for nonhemorrhagic\nstroke, and 0.3 for hemorrhagic stroke. Poorer peri-\nodontal status was associated with increased incidence\nand mortality for all CVA outcomes. For example, the\nage-adjusted incidence rates for total CVA per 1000\nyears of follow-up were 4.7 for participants with no\nperiodontal disease, 5.2 for those with gingivitis, 7.0\nfor those with periodontitis, and 7.2 for those who\nwere edentulous.\nAfter adjustment for a number of demographic\nvariables and several well-established risk factors for\ncardiovascular disease, periodontitis was significantly\nassociated with an increased risk for total CVA and\nnonhemorrhagic stroke, but not for hemorrhagic\nstroke (Table 3).

Incident cases of CVA met at least\n1 of the following criteria: (1) a death certificate with cause\nof death due to CVA or (2) one or more hospital/nursing\nhome stays during the follow-up period with discharge di-\nagnosis of CVA. The date of incidence was defined as one of\nthe following: (1) date of the first hospital/nursing home ad-\nmissionwithadischargediagnosisofCVAor(2)dateofdeath\nfor CVA if there were no records of hospital/nursing home\nstay for CVA.\nThe hospital/nursing home admission for CVA was as-\ncertained by the Health Care Facility Stay data collected at\neach follow-up survey. During the interviews, respon-\ndents were asked to report all overnight facility stays since\nthe baseline survey or prior interview. In addition to the\ninterviews, data on facility stays were gathered from the\ndeath certificate or by tracing sources and other hospital\nabstracts. All reported facilities were then contacted by mail\nand asked to review the subject's medical records and ab-\nstract information on exact dates of admission, discharge,\nand diagnoses onto standard abstract forms. Discharge di-\nagnoses were coded according to the ICD-9. The first dis-\ncharge diagnosis was used to define the cause of the cor-\nresponding admission.\nFatal events of CVA were ascertained based on the Trac-\ning and Mortality data from each follow-up survey. Infor-\nmation was based on death certificates and includes vital\nstatus, date last known alive, date of death, and underly-\ning causes of death coded according to the ICD-9.\nPeriodontal status measured at baseline is the expo-\nsure variable of interest. The dental examiners in NHANES\nI were carefully trained to follow a set of standards. The\nstandards/guidelines were used to help narrow the range\nof examiner variability by eliminating many borderline or\nquestionable conditions that were frequently a source of\nEach individual tooth was assessed for the extent of\ngingival inflammation, presence or absence of periodontal\npockets, and firmness of teeth in their sockets.

There was a slight difference in risk estimates\nfor the different outcome measurements, ie, RRs for\ntotal CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke associated with\nperiodontal disease tended to be larger for fatal events\nthan for incident events. The association between peri-\nodontal status and risk for hemorrhagic stroke was not\nsignificant.\nResults of multivariate analyses stratified by race\nand sex in whites are given in Table 4. For incident\nCVA, an increased risk with periodontitis was sig-\nnificant for African Americans and marginally signifi-\ncant for white men and white women. For fatal CVA,\nthe association tended to be stronger. For incident\nnonhemorrhagic stroke, a significant increased risk\nwith periodontitis was found in white men and white\nwomen. Compared with incident nonhemorrhagic\nstroke, point estimates of RR associated with peri-\nodontal disease are much larger for fatal nonhemor-\nrhagic stroke, especially in white men and African\nAmericans. For example, for white men, the RR (95%\n\u00b7 Gingivitis--inflammation completely circumscribed the\ntooth, but there was no apparent break in the epithelial\nattachment.\n\u00b7 Gingivitis with pocket formation--the epithelial attach-\nment had been broken and there was a pocket, not merely\na deepened gingival crevice, due to swelling in the free\ngingivae. There was no interference with normal masti-\ncatory function; the tooth was firm in its socket and had\nnot drifted.\n\u00b7 Advanced destruction with loss of masticatory function--\nthe tooth might be loose, have drifted, or sound dull on\npercussion with a metallic instrument.\nBased on the assessments of all individual teeth in the\nmouth, periodontal status for each participant was grouped\ninto one of the following categories: (1) no periodontal dis-\nease (no teeth with periodontal disease, or not more than\n1 tooth with mild gingivitis if 20 or more teeth were ex-\namined); (2) gingivitis (at least 1 tooth with mild ging-\nivitis or a worse condition that did not fit the category for\neither no periodontal disease or periodontitis); (3) peri-\nodontitis (4 or more teeth with overt pockets or worse con-\nditions); and (4) edentulousness (both arches edentulous\nor all teeth were roots). The same definition for baseline\nperiodontal status was used in a previous study on the as-\nsociation between periodontal status and the risk for coro-\nnary heart disease.2\nA number of baseline variables were used to control\nfor possible confounding. These variables included age, race,\nsex, years of schooling, family income level (poverty in-\ndex),16 smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension, al-\ncohol use, serum total cholesterol levels, and body mass\nindex (BMI) (weight in kilograms divided by height in me-\nters squared). All covariates were ascertained at the base-\nline survey; however, smoking information was collected\nonly for a subsample of the cohort at baseline (n=6913).\nFor the remaining persons (n=7502), smoking status at\nbaseline was derived from questions posed in the 1982\nthrough 1984 follow-up interviews on lifetime smoking his-\ntory or imputed history. The validity of this approach has\nSelf-reported medical histories of diabetes and hyper-\ntension were ascertained by positive responses to the\nquestions \"Has a doctor ever told you that you had any of\nthe following conditions? High blood pressure? Dia-\nbetes?\" A yes to either condition was followed in turn by\nthe question \"Do you still have it?\" Self-reported fre-\nquency of alcohol drinking during the past year at base-\nline was coded as (1) none, (2) once per month, (3) 2 to 4\ntimes per month, and (4) 2 to 6 times per week, and (5)\nevery day. The BMI was calculated from the weight and\nheight determined at the baseline survey. Serum total cho-\nlesterol levels were measured in the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) Lipid Standardization\nLaboratory using a semiautomated version of the Abell-\nDescriptive statistics including frequencies, means, SDs of\nthe covariates, various levels of periodontal disease, and the\noutcome events of interest were examined to show the char-\nacteristics of the study sample. The time of follow-up was\ndetermined as (1) the time interval between the date of medi-\ncal examination at baseline and the date the event oc-\ncurred for a participant with an outcome event of interest\nor (2) the time interval between the date of medical/dental\nexamination at baseline and the date last known alive for\na person without the outcome event. The CVA incidence\nand mortality rates per 1000 person-years of follow-up were\ncalculated for participants with various levels of periodon-\ntal status at baseline. Age-adjusted incidence or mortality\nrate for each level of periodontal status was obtained by the\ndirect method using the total study sample as the stan-\n65-74 years) were used in calculation of the age-adjusted\nrates.\nMultivariate analyses were conducted using the Cox\nproportional hazard model.20,21 In each model, the occur-\nrence of the event to be examined was defined as a failure.\nParticipants who did not have the events of interest were\nconsidered to be censored. For example, in the analysis of\nCVA mortality, the failure was death due to CVA, and the\ncensor was still alive at last contact or death caused by some-\nthing other than CVA. Hazard ratios from the Cox propor-\ntional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks\n(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjust-\nment for all covariates of interest. In order to take NHANES\nI design features into account, SUDAAN statistical soft-\nware22 and the weights for sample locations 1 through 65\nwere used in the analyses. Cox proportional hazard analy-\nses for total CVA, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and hemor-\nrhagic stroke were performed for the sample as a whole.\nThe multivariate analyses for total CVA and nonhemor-\nrhagic stroke were also performed separately for white men,\nwhite women, and African Americans. Owing to limited\nnumbers of outcome events, analyses for hemorrhagic stroke\nwere not performed separately for the sex- or race-specific\ngroups.\n\u00a92000 American Medical Association.

Specifically, periodon-\ntitis was associated with an increased risk for total\nCVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke but not for hemor-\nrhagic stroke. The finding of an increased risk for total\nCVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke associated with peri-\nodontitis was quite consistent for whites and African\nAmericans.\nOur findings are consistent with several previous\nstudies.3,23,24 In a prospective study, Beck and col-\nleagues3 found that periodontal bone loss was associ-\nated with an increased risk for stroke: 1147 participants\nwith periodontal assessments at baseline were followed\nfor an average of 18 years; RRs were 2.8 for stroke com-\nparing periodontal bone loss with no bone loss after ad-\njusting for a number of potential confounders.\nIn a case-control study, Syrjanen et al23 reported\npoorer dental status in people with cerebral infarction\nthan in healthy controls. In 40 patients with cerebral in-\nfarction younger than 50 years and matched by age and\nsex with 40 randomly selected community controls, those\nwith cerebral infarction had poorer periodontal status as\nmeasured by gingival bleeding on probing, subgingival\ncalculus, suppuration in the gingival pocket, and an in-\ndex reflecting periapical lesions, third-degree caries le-\nsions, vertical bone pockets, and radiolucent lesions in\nfurcation areas.\nIn a more recent study, Grau et al24 investigated 166\npatientswithcerebrovascularischemia,including130with\nbrain infarction and 36 with transient cerebral ische-\nmia. The 166 patients were matched by age and sex with\n166 hospital controls. Dental status was measured by a\ntotal dental index that reflected caries, periapical le-\nsions, periodontitis, and other dental lesions, and that\ndivided participants into 2 categories. Participants with\nbrain infarction and transient cerebral ischemia were ana-\nlyzed together, and the odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.60\ndental status.

First, it is\nbased on a sample that represents the US adult popula-\ntion; thus, it has good external validity compared with\nother studies in which study samples were restricted to\nlocal populations or clinical settings. As such, its rel-\nevant public health impact at the national level can be\nestimated directly.\nSecond, the association between periodontal status\nand the risk for CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke has been\naddressed for white women and for African Americans\nin this study. As found in white men, periodontal dis-\nease may also be an important risk factor for total CVA\nand, in particular, nonhemorrhagic stroke in these sub-\ngroups.\nThe prospective feature of the study has secured\nthe temporal sequence of a possible association. That\nis, cerebrovascular events ought to occur subsequent\nto the presence of periodontal disease, as the conse-\nquences of periodontal infection. The periodontal\nassessments in this study were performed before the\noccurrence of the outcome event, and thus, there\nshould be little if any bias in the assessment of peri-\nodontal health that related to the outcome measure-\nments. Selection bias should also have been low\nbecause of the high rate of follow-up.\nStatistical analyses were performed with adjust-\nment for a number of potential confounders. The de-\nsign features by which the data were collected were also\ntaken into account. Demographic variables such as age,\nsex, educational level, income, and well-established car-\nTable 3.

The design features such as stratification and clus-\ntering in collecting data were adjusted for using proper\nstatistical techniques. These techniques helped to re-\nduce bias in generating national estimates.\nThis study has several limitations. Periodontal sta-\ntus was assessed according to a standardized protocol,\nbut the assessments were quite crude compared with as-\nsessments used in more recent studies such as NHANES\nIII. Misclassification of periodontal disease status is there-\nfore likely in the present study, though it is likely to be\nnondifferential, since the outcome events occurred af-\nter periodontal status was already determined. Nondif-\nferential misclassification usually dilutes the estimate of\nan association. As such, this study is likely to underes-\ntimate the association between periodontal status and the\nrisk for CVA, although overestimation is not com-\npletely impossible.\nCausal microorganisms per se were not measured\nin this study. Although periodontal disease (as defined\nin this study) might reflect the exposure to harmful mi-\ncroorganisms, the underlying cause for periodontal dis-\nease, and the presumed causal factor linking periodon-\ntal disease to CVA, we were not able to sufficiently test\nthe role of specific microorganisms in this study. Thus,\nalthough we found an association between poor peri-\nodontal status and elevated risk for CVA, further stud-\nies are needed to confirm the possible role of specific\nharmful microorganisms in this association.\nPeriodontal status was measured only at the base-\nline survey. Changes in periodontal status over\nfollow-up are not taken into account. It is expected that\nthose who had no periodontal disease at one time might\ndevelop the disease later. Thus, the nondisease group,\nthe referents, might include those who developed peri-\nodontal disease during the follow-up period. In addition,\nthe periodontal disease status, especially acute periodon-\ntal inflammation, for those who already had the disease\nmight progress during the course of follow-up, or recess\nif properly treated. Since there are no available data to\nmeasure change in periodontal status over time, the\nobserved association between periodontal status and\nCVA might be biased, possibly in the direction toward\nthe null.\nPeriodontal status is associated with socioeco-\nnomic status and health-risk lifestyle or behaviors. These\nfactors may influence cerebrovascular risk through mecha-\nnisms in which periodontal status is not involved, thereby\nconfounding the observed association between periodon-\ntal status and the risk for CVA if not properly adjusted\nfor in the analysis. In this study, a number of variables\nincluding educational level, family income, alcohol and\ntobacco use, and BMI were adjusted for using multivar-\niate analyses. The analyses also indicate that the relative\nrisk of CVA tends to be higher for periodontitis than for\nedentulousness, which supports the hypothesis of peri-\nodontal pathogens as possible causes for the associa-\ntion. However, unknown factors not included in the analy-\nsis are still potential confounders in the observed\nassociation.\nCerebrovascular events were determined according\nto medical records or death certificates. The first step in\ncollecting information from medical records was the\nparticipants' recall of medical service use, and if partici-\npants with periodontal disease were less likely to use\nmedical service, their incident CVAs would be more\nlikely to be missed. Thus, the effect of periodontal dis-\nease would be underestimated. This may explain why\nthe association between periodontal status and fatal\nevents of total CVA and nonhemorrhagic stroke were\nstronger than that between periodontal status and the\nincident events.\nIn conclusion, this prospective study suggests\nthat periodontitis is significantly associated with risk\nof developing CVA and, in particular, nonhemorrhagic\nstroke. While a conclusive statement about cause-\neffect relationship cannot be made at this time, the\nconsistency of the findings in different racial groups\nand the strength of the association warrant further\nexamination of the potentially important association\nbetween 2 chronic conditions highly prevalent in the\nadult population.\nThis study was supported in part by grants DE04898,\nHealth, Bethesda, Md.\nReprints: Tiejian Wu, MD, PhD, Department of So-\ncial and Preventive Medicine, State University of New York\ntiejianw@acsu.buffalo.edu).\nREFERENCES\n1.
