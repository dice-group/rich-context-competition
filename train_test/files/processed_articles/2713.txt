Schulenberg3\n1Department of Sociology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA\n2Department of Sociology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA\n3Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\nThis study examines the impact of the \"Great Recession\" (from December 2007 to June 2009) on 8th and 10th graders\nin the USA, using annual nationally representative data from the Monitoring the Future study. Historical changes in\nyouth adjustment (self-esteem, depressed mood, risk taking, aggression and property crime), school achievement (grade\npoint average [GPA], time spent on homework and educational expectations) and structured and unstructured activities\n(volunteering, employment, sports and evenings out for fun) were examined between 1991 and 2014. Overall, there were\nonly slight changes in mean levels of adjustment, achievement and most youth activities. However, the percentage of youth\nworking during the school year did decline during the Great Recession. Several longer-term trends were also evident,\nthough not directly tied to the Great Recession. These include an increase in GPA, a decrease in time spent on homework,\nrising educational expectations and more time spent volunteering. Future work should assess how the shift to unpaid\nwork activities (e.g. volunteering and internships) among youth is impacting the transition from school to work in the\ncontemporary economy, and whether the Great Recession had deleterious impacts for younger children or among youth\nwhose parents lost work or had their homes foreclosed.\nKeywords: Adolescence; Historical trends; Recession; Population trends; Adjustment.\nThe USA experienced a \"Great Recession\" from Decem-\nin economic activity, broad increases in rates of jobless-\nness, long-term unemployment and poverty, along with\nsubstantial reductions in income and wealth (Brundage,\nity and length of this recession, as well as the slow pace\nof recovery, policymakers and researchers alike have been\nconcerned about the effects of the recession on the Amer-\nican population and whether any such effects will be\nlong-lasting. Whereas most of the attention has been on\nworking-age adults and families more broadly, there are\nkey reasons to pay attention to how adolescents specifi-\ncally fared. Children and adolescents are developmentally\nmore impressionable and vulnerable than adults; adverse\neffects of difficult economic times may cut deeper and\nleave lasting marks. In addition, adolescents are making\ndecisions about school, work and romantic and sexual\nrelationships that can set them on different pathways into\nadulthood.\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Monica Kirkpatrick Johnson, Department of sociology, Washington State University, Pullman,\nIn order to fully understand how the Great Recession\nmay have affected adolescents, studies using a range of\nmethodologies and samples are required. Studies with\ndetailed data on the extent to which adolescents expe-\nrience economic shocks in their families, and those\nfollowing the development of individuals over time, are\ncomplemented by those of the type we employ here--an\nexamination of broad, population-level trends. We pur-\nsue two research questions. First, we ask how adolescents\nin the USA as a whole were doing during and after the\nGreat Recession compared to beforehand. Second, we ask\nwhether any changes experienced by the adolescent pop-\nulation were concentrated among minorities and those\nin lower socio-economic status families, groups who are\nmore economically vulnerable in the USA. To address\nthese questions, we examine repeated cross-sectional data\nfor 8th and 10th grade students from the ongoing, nation-\nally representative Monitoring the Future (MTF) study.\nWe examine a broad range of indicators for how adoles-\ncents have fared, sketching out the \"big picture.\" These\n\u00a9 2016 International Union of Psychological Science\nindicators tap adjustment (self-esteem, depressed mood,\nrisk taking, aggression and property crime), achievement\n(grade point average [GPA], time spent on homework\nand educational expectations) and activities (volunteer-\ning, employment, sports and evenings out for fun). We\nexamine trends in these measures assessed annually with\nnew national samples of 8th and 10th graders over more\nboth before, during and after the Great Recession, as well\nContemporary approaches to understanding adolescence\nas a life stage and the developing young person him or\nherself emphasise the importance of historical period and\nsocial context (Crosnoe & Johnson, 2011). Adolescents\nare embedded in families, institutions and the larger soci-\nety, and these environments shape development along\nmultiple dimensions. This basic observation orients us as\nwe consider what kinds of impacts a severe recession can\nbe expected to have on adolescents. It suggests we look\nto the wider societal environment in which adolescents\nare learning, planning, taking risks and making invest-\nments. It also directs our attention to key institutions such\nas the labour market, as it expands, contracts and alters\nthe reward structure for varying skills, and to families, as\nthe most immediate social environment or \"microsystem\"\nthrough which social change is mediated (Bronfenbren-\nwe observe both direct ways in which a major recession\ncan affect adolescents, as well as indirect ways through\nthe family's experience of economic change.\nMost directly, major negative changes in economic\nconditions affect adolescents' labour market opportuni-\nties as companies lay off existing employees and offer\nfewer openings for new labour market entrants (Staff,\nJohnson, Patrick, & Schulenberg, 2014). The Great\nRecession may have also affected the way adolescents\nthink about the future, with implications for well-being\nand behavioural choices. Certainly the long-term eco-\nnomic restructuring in the USA, encompassing the rising\npremium to a 4-year college degree, has made pursuit of\nhigher education more desirable (Goyette, 2008). Nearly\n40% of ninth graders in the recent High School Longi-\ntudinal Study expect to achieve beyond the bachelor's\ndegree, anticipating earning a Master's degree or higher\n(National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). With\nbachelor's degree holders relatively protected in the Great\nRecession (e.g. unemployment at half the rate of high\nin the years immediately following the recession (Vuolo,\nMortimer, & Staff, 2016), obtaining a 4-year college\ndegree may have become even more important to ado-\nlescents. With educational expectations already so high,\nnot much change may be evident in them (i.e. there may\nbe ceiling effects), but perhaps adolescents' investments\nin studying rose along with other activities designed to\nassist in presenting competitive applications to college\n(e.g. volunteer work). If adolescents perceive higher\nstakes in education and the labour market, increased\nefforts aimed at succeeding in these realms may reduce\ntime spent in leisure pursuits.\nIn contrast to these arguments, there are countervail-\ning trends that complicate such predictions. Despite the\ngrowing value of education in the labour market, the cost\nof higher education rose as well, particularly during the\nGreat Recession (The College Board, 2015). Although\nmany young people and their families were able to find\nways to meet these costs, others were likely priced out.\nStudies have shown that risky behaviour among adoles-\ncents rises when higher education becomes less affordable\n(Cowan, 2011). For those who may have been on the mar-\ngin with respect to future educational routes, there may\nhave been even less to lose by engaging in risky behaviour.\nAdolescents may also have been impacted indirectly,\nparticularly through their families' experiences of the\nGreat Recession. Specifically, adolescents' well-being\nmay have declined as their parents lost jobs or felt greater\nemployment insecurity, had their homes foreclosed, or\nwitnessed their savings dry up. More than one in three\nhouseholds in the USA experienced unemployment, neg-\native equity in their home, or missed a house payment\ngard (2012) also reports an uptick in the rate of serious\npsychological distress among adults in the USA during\nthe recession.\nSpecific, disruptive events such as parental job loss\nand residential moves increase during recessions, and\nhave generally negative impacts on child and adoles-\ncent development, particularly among those in lower\nsocio-economic status families (Kalil, 2013). Financial\nstress on parents can find its way to children through par-\nents' own deteriorated well-being and increased conflict\nbetween parents (Conger, Ge, Elder, Lorenz, & Simons,\n1994). As such, adolescents may have experienced more\nstress at home, as well as less support from parents in cop-\ning with even routine difficulties.\nDespite strong arguments suggesting major impacts,\nit is equally important to consider that the Great Reces-\nsion may have had limited or weak effects on adolescents.\nOne possibility is that adolescents already faced uncer-\ntain futures prior to the Great Recession, and any adaptive\nresponses have been ongoing in the face of longer-term\neconomic trends. In addition, while some families expe-\nrienced major issues, many parents may have been able to\nbuffer the impact on their adolescent children by drawing\non their financial as well as emotional reserves to weather\nthe tough times. Studies of adults support the idea that\nthere were not wholesale effects of the Great Recession\nacross all aspects of life and well-being. Although there\n\u00a9 2016 International Union of Psychological Science\nis evidence of decline in mental health, other aspects of\nhealth showed little change, at least in the short-run (Bur-\ngard, 2012).1 And scholars tracking public opinion have\nnoted the \"surprisingly weak effect\" recessions have had\non Americans' views on economic and social issues (Ken-\nWe have limited empirical evidence to date with which\nto evaluate the effects of the Great Recession on ado-\nlescents. Two recent studies drawing on data from a\nlong-term panel study in the USA tracked achievement\norientations and work values of adolescents with changes\nin parents' incomes and employment conditions. Findings\nfrom the first study (Mortimer, Zhang, Hussemann, &\nWu, 2014) indicated that adolescents' expectations of\neconomic success in adulthood declined with increases\nin parents' financial problems over a 2-year period, but\nonly among those whose parents had no more than a\nhigh school diploma; educational aspirations were also\nlowered in the face of declining parental income if par-\nents had experienced intermittent unemployment in the\ndecade prior. The second study (Johnson & Mortimer,\n2015) found differences in adolescents' work values, or\nthe importance they attach to different job features. Ado-\nlescents whose parents experienced increases in income\nheld stronger extrinsic work values (i.e. greater emphasis\non income, security, a job that people regard highly, and\nadvancement opportunities). Those whose parents experi-\nenced a decline in job security held weaker extrinsic val-\nues. Findings for intrinsic values were very similar, with\nincreased income positively related to children's intrin-\nsic work values (greater emphasis on decision-making\nauthority, responsibility, opportunities to use one's skills\nand abilities, learning opportunities, contacts with peo-\nple and opportunities to help others), and a decline in\nparental job security negatively related to intrinsic work\nvalues. Representing a more disruptive change in the fam-\nily, parental unemployment was associated with higher\nextrinsic and intrinsic orientations among children when\nparents had low levels of education (high school degrees\nor less). The findings of this study support a generalisation\nmodel, wherein work values are stronger when jobs are\nmore rewarding (and weaker when they become less so).\nTaken together, these two studies suggest that chang-\ning parental circumstances in the Great Recession may\nshape adolescents' achievement-related orientations,\nthough often differentially by how families are posi-\ntioned economically. Looking outside the USA, having\nparents out of work was associated with Not in Education,\nEmployment or Training (NEET) status and duration in\nthe Great Recession in England, particularly among\n1Burgard (2012) does note a rise in reports of foregoing dental care, prescription medicine and eyeglasses in 2009, raising the possibility that health\neffects may arise later.\n2Details of the Monitoring the Future study are available at http://monitoringthefuture.org/.

We know that\nmany adults' financial circumstances changed greatly\nduring and in the aftermath of the recession, but con-\nsideration of other aspects of adults' orientations and\nwell-being suggest variable and sometimes short-term\neffects. In this study, we draw on national data collected\nannually from large samples of US adolescents in the\n8th and 10th grades, tracking aggregate trends in a wide\nrange of indicators in order to build a more complete\npicture of the Great Recession's impact on youth. Our\nfirst research question asks whether aggregate trends in\nadolescent adjustment, achievement and participation in\nactivities changed during or after the Great Recession.\nBecause, as we note above, there are competing possibil-\nities for how adolescents may have been affected, we do\nnot hypothesise that historical change occurred in specific\ndirections. Our second question asks whether any changes\ntied to the Great Recession were disproportionately evi-\ndent in groups more vulnerably positioned in the econ-\nomy. Our review of past studies suggests that economic\nchanges have stronger effects on disadvantaged groups.\nThus we examine whether historical trends in adolescent\nadjustment, achievement and participation in activities\ndiffered between Whites and non-Whites and by mothers'\neducation level, two key indicators of disadvantage.\nMETHOD\nData\nBased on a repeated cross-sectional design, the MTF\nstudy continues to collect data on nationally represen-\ntative samples of middle and high school students each\nyear. 2 Since 1991, in-school surveys have been collected\neach year. Students were randomly selected from approx-\nimately 160 public and private schools, and youth com-\npleted questionnaires with multiple choice items in the\nclassroom. About 90% of students responded to these sur-\nveys, with nearly all non-response due to absenteeism.\nAlthough school-based survey administrations exclude\ndropouts, estimates indicate a dropout rate of less than\nston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2016). We\nused weights in all of our analyses to correct for the multi-\nstage sampling procedure. The MTF uses multiple survey\n\u00a9 2016 International Union of Psychological Science\nforms (distributed randomly) to increase survey breadth\nand limit respondent burden, so not all of the survey items\nused in these analyses were asked of all youth. Thus, our\ndepending on the outcome.\nIn this article, we use 24 cohorts of 8th and 10th\nbefore, during and after the Great Recession. In the sam-\nare Black, 13% are Hispanic, 4% are Asian and 9% are\nanother race/ethnicity; approximately 42% of the students\nreported that their mother had completed college.\nMeasures of adolescent adjustment,\nachievement and activities\nWe consider five indicators of youth adjustment that\nhave been used in previous MTF analyses (e.g. Keyes\nSelf-esteem is a summary scale of the mean of eight\nitems ( = .88), such as \"I take a positive attitude toward\nmyself,\" \"I feel I am a person of worth, on an equal plane\nwith others\" and \"I am able to do things as well as most\npeople.\" Responses on each item ranged on a 5-point\nscale from \"disagree\" to \"agree.\" Symptoms of depressive\naffect is an average of four items with the same scale\n( = .76), such as \"Life often seems meaningless\" and\n\"The future often seems hopeless.\" Risk taking includes\ntwo items ( = .78): \"I get a real kick out of doing things\nthat are little dangerous\" and \"I like to test myself every\nnow and then by doing something a little risky,\" with\nresponses ranging on a 5-point scale from \"disagree\" to\n\"agree.\" Interpersonal aggression is a mean scale of three\nitems ( = .80) indicating how often in the past year the\nrespondent had: \"taken part in a fight where a group of\nyour friends were against another group,\" \"hurt someone\nbadly enough to need bandages or a doctor\" or \"gotten\ninto a serious fight in school or at work.\" Finally, property\ncrime is a mean scale based on five items ( = .78), such\nas how often in the past year respondents had taken\nsomething not belonging to them worth under $50, sold an\nillegal drug, or damaged school property on purpose. For\nboth the aggression and property crime items, responses\nranged from 1 \"not at all\" to 5 \"5 or more times.\"\nWe included three single-item measures of academic\nachievement. Youth self-reported their GPA during the\ncurrent school year (ranging from 1 = \"D or below\" to\n9 = \"A\"). Educational expectations assessed how likely\nthe adolescent felt that they were to graduate from a 4-year\ncollege program (ranging from 1 = \"definitely won't\" to\n4 = \"definitely will\"). Youth were also asked to report\nabout how many hours they spend on their homework in\nan average week (ranging from 1 = \"0 hours\" to 7 = \"25\nor more hours\" per week).\nFinally, we examined involvement in paid work,\nevenings out for fun, civic engagement and exercise or\nsports participation. Specifically, we created a binary\nmeasure indicating whether the adolescent was currently\nor had worked in a paid job during the school year\n(1 = yes, 0 = no). We included a binary measure assess-\ning whether the young person volunteers or participates\nin community service at least monthly (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nWe also created a binary measure of whether they played\nsports or exercised almost every day (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nFinally, youth were asked: \"During a typical week, on\nhow many evenings do you go out for fun and recreation?\n(Don't count things you do with your parents or other\nadult relatives).\" We created a binary measure distin-\nguishing respondents who go out for fun and recreation\nat least one evening per week (1) versus those who do\nRESULTS\nIn this descriptive study we present trend lines across\nsquares (OLS) and logistic regression models in which we\nestimate the size and statistical significance of historical\nchange on each outcome (see Table 1).

Given the very\nlarge sample sizes involved, it is important to keep in mind\nthat some statistically significant differences can still be\nvery small in magnitude.\nFigure 1 shows averages of self-esteem, depressed\nmood, risk-taking, interpersonal aggression and property\nscale, historical trends within indicators are the focus\n(vs. comparison across indicators), as the meaning of the\nfive points differs across them.

We used large national\nsamples of US teenagers to examine yearly changes in\nmultiple indicators of youth adjustment, achievement and\non shifts that coincided with the global Great Recession\nchanges in the years surrounding the Great Recession in\nmean levels of five indicators of adjustment (self-esteem,\ndepressed mood, risk-taking, interpersonal aggression\nand property crime), three indicators of achievement\n(GPA, educational expectations and time spent on home-\nwork) and three variables referencing youth activities\n(volunteering, playing sports or exercising and going out\nwith friends). Similarly, these indicators did not apprecia-\nbly change during or in the aftermath of other economic\nthe percentage of youth working during the school year\ndid decline during the Great Recession, and school-year\nemployment is particularly low among youth today (also\nshown by Staff et al., 2014), with some evidence to sug-\ngest similar declines in previous years of economic down-\nturn, especially in the aftermath of the 2001 recession.\nThus, our findings indicate that youth have been affected\nby the recent and previous economic downturns in a very\nlimited but direct way--through their own labour market\nopportunities. With respect to these employment trends,\nas well as all other measures we examined, we found\nno evidence that historical shifts were any more apparent\namong disadvantaged groups.\nThough many aspects of the social development of\nteenagers appear not to be directly affected by the Great\nRecession or previous economic downturns, our results\nshow some broad changes among youth across the past\nquarter century. For instance, compared to youth in the\n1990s, teenagers nowadays report higher overall GPAs\nwhile spending less time overall completing homework.\nAs other research has reported using data from the MTF,\neducational expectations have risen, with the majority of\n\u00a9 2016 International Union of Psychological Science\ncontemporary youth expecting to \"definitely\" graduate\nwith at least a Bachelor's degree. In addition, the steep\ndrop in teenage employment in the post Great Reces-\nsion period has coincided with a more gradual increase\nin the percentage of teens who are spending time as\nvolunteers or engaged in community activities (Syvert-\nsen, Wray-Lake, Flanagan, Osgood, & Briddell, 2011).\nFinally, it is clear that recent cohorts of youth are spend-\ning less time hanging out with friends in unstructured\nactivities that are away from parents, teachers or other\nadult guardians. Though it is unlikely that the Great\nRecession is directly involved in these recent trends, it\nis no doubt part of the myriad economic, social and\ntechnological changes that contribute to the changing\nmacrosystem of today's youth undergirding these social\nand well-being shifts. The repeated cross-sectional design\nof the MTF study allowed us to take a wide view of these\ntrends before, during and in the years following the Great\nRecession.\nWe do observe that the last several cohorts have expe-\nrienced slightly higher symptoms of depressive affect\nand lower self-esteem, and unlike the changes noted\nabove, these were not embedded within longer-term\ntrends. These changes could reflect a delayed effect of the\nrecession, emerging about 4\u00ad5 years afterwards, perhaps\nas it became clearer that opportunities in the economy\nwere not going to revert back to pre-recession levels. It\nis also possible that changes to well-being were limited to\nchildren whose families suffered major economic losses,\nand with more individual families affected as the poor\neconomy dragged on (even past the official end of the\nGreat Recession), it may have taken several years for this\ntrend to become visible at the population level. Though\nwe do not address these or alternative, non-recession,\nexplanations any further here, we encourage continued\nmonitoring. The differences observed were quite small,\nbut if they continue they could become consequential.\nIn previous research using MTF data (Staff et al.,\n2014), we documented the decline of employment among\nUS teenagers, who once commonly held part-time jobs\nafter school or on weekends during the school year.\nThough adults have experienced some recovery in terms\nof unemployment and overall rates of labour force par-\nticipation since the Great Recession (though still not up\nto pre-recession levels; see Brundage, 2014), no recov-\nery is evident in rates of paid work among 8th and\n10th graders since the Great Recession, nor for previous\n\u00a9 2016 International Union of Psychological Science\nprecipitous drops in youth employment during recession\nyears that never recovered. Change in the rates of employ-\nment among teenagers has the potential to reduce youth's\nopportunities to build human capital and learn important\nlife skills, but also lessens exposure to the risks asso-\nciated with intensive paid work in adolescence, such as\ncompromising school performance or increasing problem\nbehaviours (see Staff, Mont'Alvao, & Mortimer, 2015,\nfor a review). Our results indicated that youth increas-\ningly appear to be substituting unpaid work activities (i.e.\nvolunteering) to some extent for part-time jobs during\nthe school year, as a higher percentage of teenagers in\n2014 volunteered in the past month then held a job dur-\ning their current school year. As suggested by the recent\nInstitute of Medicine (2014) consensus study on health\nand safety during the transition to adulthood, future work\nshould assess how the shift to unpaid work activities (e.g.\nvolunteering and internships) among youth is impacting\nthe transition from school to work in the contemporary\neconomy.\nThough our results suggest that teenagers are largely\nshielded from economic recessions, including the Great\nRecession, it is important to note that these population\ntrends may mask adjustment problems for youth whose\nfamilies or communities were severely hit by the Great\nRecession. The MTF study does not collect data on\nparental job loss, unemployment or recent family eco-\nnomic setbacks, such as a home foreclosure, bankruptcy\nor significant loss of savings. Adolescent well-being may\nbe expected to drop when parents' own well-being does,\nor when conflict in the family increases, but we do not\nhave information about parental well-being or family\nconflict. Likewise, our repeated cross-sectional data may\nalso mask changes at the individual level that panel data\nfollowing development of adolescents over time could\nreveal. An additional limitation to our study is that while\nwe examined a broad range of indicators of social and\nbehavioural development, all measures were self-reported\nand some were based on only single questionnaire items.\nAn interesting question is whether younger children\nmight be more vulnerable to economic recessions than\nthe cohorts of 8th and 10th graders we observed in this\nstudy. Elder's (1999) classic study of youth coming of\nage during the Great Depression revealed how family\neconomic hardship had an especially strong effect on\nyoung children. Older children, by contrast, were better\nable to weather the stressors and struggles associated with\nthe Great Depression by working to help with family\nexpenses. In the analyses we show here, the most recent\neighth graders were elementary age during the Great\nRecession. Population level changes for elementary age\nchildren during that time would therefore be evident in the\nmost recent eighth graders in our sample, so if population\ntrends existed for children that age, they have dissipated\nsince then. Older teenagers and young adults may also\nbe more vulnerable to economic downturns compared to\nthe 8th and 10th graders we highlight here, as they may\nfind it difficult to establish adult independence (e.g. obtain\ncareer-relevant work, leave the parental home) in troubled\neconomic times. Furthermore, when work opportunities\nare in short supply, older youth may expect less from\ntheir future jobs, and these weakened work values in turn\ncould negatively impact later career opportunities and\nsocio-economic attainment (Johnson, Sage, & Mortimer,\nIn conclusion, results did not indicate strong direct\ndetrimental effects for US 8th and 10th grade youth\nduring the Great Recession, although the percentage of\nyouth working during the school year did decline. More\ngeneral historical changes, not directly linked to the Great\nRecession, such as an increase in GPA, decrease in time\nspent on homework, higher educational expectations and\nmore time spent volunteering, were found across the past\nquarter century; more recently there has been a decline in\nunstructured time with friends and very recently there has\nbeen a decline in self-esteem and an increase in symptoms\nof depressive affect. Additional research regarding how\nthese changes are affecting youth, including how the shift\nfrom paid to unpaid work activities (e.g. volunteering and\ninternships) affects the transition to adulthood, is needed.\nMoreover, while our study casts doubt on any wholesale\nnegative impact of the Great Recession, studies using\nalternative methods and targeting other age groups are\nneeded. In particular, a closer look examining the impacts\nof the Great Recession for youth who were most directly\naffected by economic hardship (e.g. those whose parents\nlost their jobs or who were displaced from their homes)\nwould be highly valuable.\nREFERENCES\nBronfenbrenner, U.
