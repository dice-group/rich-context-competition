Introduction\nSecondhand smoke (SHS) exposure, also known as passive smoking or exposure to environmental\ntobacco smoke, is known to be associated with a number of health effects, including respiratory illness,\ncancer and heart disease. Exposure has been shown to have an impact on children, adolescents and\nadults. These negative health impacts have been recently documented in several substantial reports\nwhich summarize the literature linking SHS exposure to respiratory effects in children and adult\neffects on cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease [1,2]. More specifically, SHS\nexposure has been shown to cause lung cancer [3], respiratory disease, particularly in children [4,5],\nand heart disease [6-8]. Recent evidence adds breast cancer in young women to the list of SHS related\ndiseases [2].\nThree recent studies have used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\ndata to estimate SHS exposure in the U.S. Pirkle and his colleagues [9] analyzed the NHANES III data\nfrom 1988-1991 and showed that serum cotinine levels indicate broader exposure to SHS than self-\nreported data. They found that the highest cotinine levels were for children, non-Hispanic Blacks, and\nadult males. In a later study, Pirkle and colleagues looked at trends in SHS exposure from 1988-2002\nusing serum cotinine concentration, and found that there have been substantial declines in exposure\nover this time period, though children and non-Hispanic Blacks have higher levels of exposure than\n2004. They found that the percentage of nonsmokers with self-reported home exposure and the\npercentage with detectable serum cotinine declined between the two time periods. The rate of decline\nwas smallest for children followed by adolescents. An analysis of the National Health Interview\nSurvey found that SHS exposure at home, measured as the number of days per week someone smoked\nin the home, declined more substantially between 1992 and 2000 than would be predicted by the\ndecline in active smoking [12]. Using data from the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS),\nMachlin, Hill, and Liang [13] report that children who were older, poorer, and lived with adults with\nless education, were most likely to be exposed to SHS at home, as indicated by their living with at\nleast one adult smoker. They do not report whether or not the person actually smoked inside the home.\nStudies that compare the rates of exposure to SHS among racial/ethnic groups have generally found\nthat among nonsmokers, African Americans have the highest rates of exposure. This has been reported\nfor young adults using both cotinine concentration and self-reported number of hours of exposed per\nweek [14], for women using self-reported number of days exposed per week [15], and for children\nusing urinary cotinine levels and self-reported number of hours exposed [16]. However, it must be\nnoted that when socioeconomic indicators were taken into consideration in one study, the higher rate\nof exposure among African American women was no longer found [15]. Hispanics have been found to\nhave relatively low exposure rates, using both cotinine concentration and self-reported number of\nhours exposed [16]. Among nonsmoking Hispanic women of reproductive age, exposure to SHS\ndiffered by country of origin, according to an analysis of the Hispanic Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey [17]. Exposure at home, indicated by whether or not someone in the household\nsmoked, was found to be 31-62% for Mexican-American women, 22-59% for Puerto Ricans, and\nyoungest women (age 12-19) had the greatest exposure. For Mexican-Americans, exposure decreased\nwith age, but for Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans, the pattern was less clear. At work, exposure\nwas indicated by whether or not the respondent worked near someone who smoked in their presence.\nCuban Americans during the same period from 1982-1984. There was no pattern for work exposure by\nage. Pirkle and colleagues [9] reported that non-Hispanic Blacks had the highest exposure to SHS\naccording to both serum cotinine measures and self-reported exposure. Findings from an analysis of\nthe MEPS indicate that non-Hispanic white and black children were more likely than Hispanic children\nto live with at least one adult smoker [13].\nPrevious studies that have examined SHS exposure use several different measures of exposure,\nincluding serum cotinine concentration, urinary cotinine concentration, amount of time exposed,\nwhether or not someone in the household smoked in the home, whether or not they lived with a\nsmoker, and whether or not someone in the workplace smoked in their presence. The results are\ngenerally consistent, though subtle differences have been found depending on the measure used.\nThe goal of this study is to analyze the pattern of SHS exposure using three measures of SHS\nexposure: self-reported exposure, whether or not someone has a detectable serum cotinine level, and\nthe actual level of serum cotinine. We will compare the patterns of exposure over time from 1999 to\n2006 and by sociodemographic characteristics for different age groups. We will also compare the\nresults from self-reported SHS exposure and cotinine measured exposure estimates. We extend the\nprevious research by focusing on more recent years, and looking at how patterns of exposure differ in\nan era when all exposure rates are much reduced from previous levels.\n2. Methods\nWe analyzed the data from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), which contains a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized civilian persons\nof all ages who were selected based on a complex sampling design. The NHANES is a household\nsurvey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S. Survey\nparticipants complete a home interview followed by a physical examination in a mobile examination\ncenter (MEC). The home interviews collect each participant's demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics, dietary patterns, health-related conditions, smoking and tobacco use status, and\nexposure to SHS. The physical examinations consist of medical, dental, and physiological\nmeasurements, as well as laboratory tests including blood and urine samples. During examination in\nthe MEC, blood samples are drawn for serum cotinine analysis for all individuals age 3 and older.\nSince 1999, the NHANES has been conducted on a continuous basis with data released every two\nadolescents 12-19 years, older adults (60+ years), and low-income persons have been oversampled to\nimprove the reliability of the statistical estimates for these subgroups. The response rate of the\nWhile smokers may also suffer ill effects from SHS exposure, it is challenging to separate the\nhealth impacts of active and passive smoking. Therefore, in this study we focused only on nonsmokers.\nOur study sample comprises three age groups of nonsmokers: children (age 3-11), adolescents (age 12-\n19), and adults (age 20 and older). We excluded anyone less than three years old because serum\ncotinine was not measured in this group. The age cutoffs for adolescents and adults were used to be\nconsistent with two sets of NHANES questionnaires about cigarette smoking and tobacco use. As part\nof the home interview, respondents aged 20 and older were asked about their history of cigarette\nsmoking and other tobacco use. These individuals (i.e., adults aged 20 and older) were defined as\n\"current smokers\" if they answered that they have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and\ncurrently smoke cigarettes everyday or some day, or that they have used other tobacco products\nincluding pipe, cigar, snuff, or chewing tobacco at least 20 times in their entire life and now use these\ntobacco products. As part of the audio computer-assisted self interview during the physical\nexamination in the MEC, respondents aged 12 to 19 years, who answered that they have tried cigarette\nsmoking, were asked how many days they smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. These individuals\n(i.e., adolescents aged 12-19) were defined as \"current smokers\" if they answered that they had\nsmoked cigarettes at least one day in the past 30 days. In addition to these two sets of questionnaires,\nall respondents aged 12 and older were also asked about their use of tobacco products (cigarettes,\npipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, or any other product containing\nnicotine) in the past five days during the physical examination in the MEC.\nWe considered all children to be nonsmokers. For adolescents and adults, nonsmokers were those\nwho were not \"current smokers\" as defined above, had not used any tobacco products in the past five\ndays, and had serum cotinine levels  10.0 ng/mL. While the choice of an arbitrary serum cotinine\ncutoff may lead to classifying some light smokers as nonsmokers, or excluding some nonsmokers who\nare heavily exposed to SHS, others have reported that using a cutoff of 10 or 15 mg/mL has little\nimpact on results [9,10]. For the analyses of self-reported SHS exposure, individuals with responses to\nhome exposure questions of missing, \"don't know\", or \"refused\" were excluded. The final sample size\nindividuals with missing serum cotinine data were excluded; the final sample size for nonsmokers was\n2.3. Measures of SHS Exposure\nWe analyzed exposure to SHS using two types of measures: self-reported exposure and cotinine\nmeasured exposure. Self-reported exposure to SHS was defined on the basis of the following\nNHANES questions: for each household participating in the survey, one family member was selected\nto answer whether any of the household members smoked cigarettes, cigars, or pipes anywhere inside\nthe home. If any household member smoked, then all members of that household were classified as\nbeing exposed to SHS in the home. Respondents aged 16 and older who reported that they had a job or\nbusiness in last week were asked: \"At this job or business, how many hours per day can you smell the\nsmoke from other people's cigarettes, cigars, and/or pipes?'' Those who reported one hour or more\nwere defined as being exposed to workplace SHS. For children and adolescents, we only examined\ntheir SHS exposure status in the home. For adults, we examined both exposure status in the home and\nexposure status at work.\nSerum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, was assessed in the NHANES using an isotope dilution,\nliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method [9]. Analyses were conducted at the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention laboratory at the National Centers for Environmental Health. In the\n1999-2000 survey cycle, serum cotinine measurement was designed to detect levels as low as\ndetectable limit of 0.015 ng/mL. We defined two kinds of cotinine measured exposure: whether or not\nsomeone has a detectable serum cotinine level of 0.05 ng/mL or greater, and the actual level of serum\ncotinine. The detectable limit of 0.05 ng/mL was used so that our data would be comparable across all\nyears.\n2.4. Measurement of Sociodemographic Characteristics\nWe considered the following sociodemographic variables: gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black, Mexican-American, other Hispanic, other race/ethnicity), country of birth\n(U.S., Mexico, elsewhere), poverty status and educational level. Poverty status was measured by the\npoverty income ratio (PIR) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau [19]. PIR is the ratio of family\nincome to the family's appropriate poverty threshold taking family size into account [20]. We\nhigh income ( 4.0). Values less than 1.0 indicate that family income is below the official poverty\nthreshold. Education level was classified into less than high school, high school graduate or General\nEducational Development (GED) diploma, and more than high school graduate. The education level\nfor children and adolescents was determined by the status of the reference person in their household.\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nAll analyses accounted for the complex survey design and incorporated sampling weights that\nadjusted for unequal probabilities of sample selection, nonresponse, and sample noncoverage. All the\nstatistical analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.1 [21] PROC SURVEYMEANS, PROC\nSURVEYREG, and PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC procedures which adjust for complex sample design\nwhen variance estimates are computed. We calculated the percentages of nonsmokers with self-\nreported SHS exposure and the percentages of nonsmokers with detectable serum cotinine levels. We\nalso calculated the geometric means of the serum cotinine levels among nonsmokers. Because the\ncotinine levels were not normally distributed, we log-transformed the actual values before performing\nany analyses [9,10]. For nonsmokers whose serum cotinine level was below the detectable limit, we\nused an estimated level of 0.035 ng/mL (ie, the detectable limit, 0.050 ng/mL, divided by the square\nroot of 2) [9,22,23]. Exposure prevalence rates and geometric means as well as their 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) were calculated by age group (children, adolescents, adults), time period (1999-2000,\nTo assess whether there was a significant time trend in SHS exposure during the eight years from\n1999 to 2006, we fit an ordinary least squares regression model for all nonsmokers within each age\ngroup. In the model, the dependent variable is one of the three SHS exposure measures and the\nand so forth. If the coefficient of the time trend variable is negative and statistically significant, it\nindicates there was a decreasing trend. For the analyses of the relationship between sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and SHS exposure, the four waves of data were combined. Differences in self-reported\nexposure among population subgroups were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models\nwhich adjust for gender, race/ethnicity, country of birth, education level, and poverty income ratio.\nAdjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Differences in geometric\nmeans of cotinine levels among sub-populations were evaluated using multivariate linear regression\nmodels of log-transformed cotinine levels by adjusting for sociodemographic covariates We\nconsidered estimates to be statistically significant if the two-sided P-value < 0.05.\n3. Results\n3.1. SHS Exposure over Time\nTable 1 shows the prevalence of self-reported exposure, prevalence of detectable serum cotinine,\nand geometric mean of cotinine levels among nonsmokers for the four waves of data and the three age\ngroups. Consistent with earlier studies, the serum cotinine measure indicates a much higher prevalence\nof SHS exposure than self-reports. For all the three age groups, the difference in exposure rates is\nnearly threefold. Over the four time periods from 1999 to 2006, children and adolescents were found to\nself-reported exposure includes both exposure status in the home and exposure status at work. Work\nonly exposure rates exceeded home only exposure rates. Very few people, 1.1 percent or fewer of the\nadult nonsmokers, were exposed in both settings. During the three time periods from 1999 to 2004 for\nwhich work and home exposure data are available, adults' total self-reported rates were in the range of\ncotinine measured prevalence over all periods, children had the highest SHS exposure rates.\nand adults had the lowest rates. The geometric mean of cotinine levels for children ranged from 0.11 to\n0.18 ng/mL during the 8-year period. For adolescents the range was 0.09 to 0.14 ng/mL and for adults\nthe range was 0.06 to 0.08 ng/mL. During every time period, children had the highest mean cotinine\nlevels, followed closely by adolescents, and adults had the lowest levels.\nWhile all three measures of SHS exposure were lower in the fourth time period than in 1999-2000,\nthey did not consistently decrease over time. In particular, there was an increase noted for 2003-2004\nover the previous period for all measures and all age groups except children measured through self-\nreports. The multivariate regression of trend analyses indicates that the prevalence of self-reported\nexposure decreased significantly over time only for children. However, for adolescents and adults,\nboth the prevalence of detectable cotinine and the geometric mean of cotinine levels proved to be\nstatistically significantly decreasing over time. We further explored whether there might be trends for\nspecific race/ethnic subgroups within an age group in a separate analysis. We found that none of the\nracial/ethnic subgroup for adolescents and adults exhibited any significant trend in self-reported\nexposure over time.\nTable 1.

Self-Reported SHS Exposure\nTable 2 shows the percentage of nonsmokers who report SHS exposure in the home during the\ncombined years of 1999-2006 for the three age groups disaggregated by sociodemographic\ncharacteristics. The prevalence rates of SHS exposure were 20.8%, 18.7%, and 14.5% respectively for\nchildren, adolescent, and adults. Prevalence rates of exposure were significantly higher for female\nchildren and adults compared to males, but were similar for male and female adolescents. Non-\nHispanic Blacks had the highest exposure rates of all race/ethnic groups. These rates were significantly\ndifferent from the rates for non-Hispanic white children and adults, even after controlling for other\nsociodemographic factors; however, the odds ratio for black children is less than one and significant.\nMexican American children and adolescents had the lowest prevalence rates of exposure and their\nlower rates were significantly different from the rates for their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Other\nHispanic children and adolescents also had significantly lower exposure rates than non-Hispanic\nWhites. Children, adolescents, and adults born in Mexico had significantly lower exposure than those\nborn in the U.S. Adolescents and adults born in foreign countries other than Mexico also had lower\nexposure than those who were U.S. born.\nEducation level was inversely related to self-reported SHS exposure for children and adolescents.\nChildren and adolescents living in households headed by someone with less than a high school degree\nhad exposure rates of 32.4% and 26.4% respectively. If the household was headed by someone with\neducation beyond high school, these rates fell to a significantly lower level of 14.7% and 13.6. The\nexposure rates for adults with education beyond high school were significantly lower than for adults\nwith less than a high school degree (11.9% compared to 17.4%).\nPoverty status as measured by the PIR was also inversely related to self-reported SHS exposure.\nChildren living in households above the poverty threshold (PIR  1.0) were significantly less likely to\nbe exposed to SHS in the home than those below the poverty threshold. For children in high income\n(PIR  4.0) households, the difference was fivefold (35.3% vs 7.0%). For adolescents, the SHS\nexposure rates differed significantly by a factor of two for those below the poverty threshold compared\nto those in high income households (22.6% vs 10.9%). Adults showed the same pattern, though the\ndifferences were not statistically significant.\n3.3. Cotinine Measured SHS Exposure\nTable 3 shows the geometric mean of cotinine levels for the three age groups disaggregated by\nsocioeconomic characteristics during the combined years of 1999-2006. Mean cotinine levels were\n0.15 ng/mL for children, 0.11 ng/mL for adolescents, and 0.07 mg/mL for adults. Consistent with the\nself-reported SHS exposure results, adult females had significantly lower cotinine concentration than\nmales. Black adolescents and adults had significantly higher mean cotinine levels than Whites, and\nMexican Americans of all ages had significantly lower mean cotinine levels than their white\ncounterparts. Nonsmokers of all ages born in Mexico and anywhere else outside the U.S. had\nsignificantly lower mean cotinine levels than those born in the U.S. Both educational level and poverty\nstatus were inversely related to the mean self-reported SHS exposure. Adults with education beyond\nhigh school, and children and adolescents living in a household with an educated head of household,\nhad significantly lower mean cotinine levels than those with less than a high school education.\nCompared to those living below the poverty line, all other income groups had significantly lower mean\ncotinine levels for all three age groups except for low income (PIR = 1.0-1.99) adolescents.\nThe patterns of prevalence rates of detectable serum cotinine among nonsmokers by\nsociodemographic characteristics during 1999-2006 are similar to the results from Table 2 using self-\nreported SHS exposure, except that the absolute values of cotinine-measured prevalence rates are\nmuch higher. The prevalence rates of cotinine measured exposure were 59.0%, 52.4%, and 40.5%\nrespectively for children, adolescent, and adults. The rates were particularly astonishingly high for\nnon-Hispanic Blacks: 79.6% for children, 75.5% for adolescents, and 62.1% for adults. We do not\nshow detailed results here, but instead only briefly point out some different patterns. Exposure rates\ndiffered by gender and country of birth only for adults, with females and those born in Mexico having\nsignificantly lower SHS exposure. Blacks of all ages had greater prevalence rates of detectable\ncotinine compared to Whites, while children of any other race/ethnicity groups and Mexican American\nadolescents were less likely to have detectable cotinine than Whites.\nNon-Hispanic Blacks of all ages had significantly decreasing prevalence of detectable cotinine over\nthe 8-year time period, and Mexican American children and adolescents had significantly decreasing\ntrends in both the prevalence of cotinine and geometric mean of cotinine concentration over the same\nperiod.\nTable 2.

Comparison of Self-Reported and Cotinine Measured SHS Exposure\nOur results indicate much higher rates of cotinine measured exposure than self-reported SHS\nexposure. To further analyze how these exposure measures differ, we calculated the prevalence rates of\ndetectable cotinine and the geometric means of cotinine concentration separately for nonsmokers who\nself-reported SHS exposure and those who did not (Table 4). 98.2% of children with self-reported\nexposure had detectable serum cotinine levels, with a geometric mean of 1.20 ng/mL. For children\nwho did not have self-reported exposure, almost half (47.6%) of them nonetheless had detectable\nserum cotinine, with a mean value of 0.08 ng/mL. The pattern is similar for adolescents, though only\n42% of those who report no home exposure had detectable cotinine, and the mean cotinine level for\nthose with self-reported home exposure was lower than that of children: 0.75 ng/mL. For adults, the\nagreement between self-reported and cotinine-indicated exposure is greater for those who reported\nbeing exposed only in the home (94.2%) or both in the home and work (98.4%). For those who report\nbeing exposed only at work, 63.5% have detectable cotinine. More than one-third of adults (36.1%)\nwho report that they were not exposed in the home or at work nonetheless had detectable cotinine\nlevels. Geometric means of cotinine concentration were greatest for adults who report being exposed\nboth in the home and at work (0.65 ng/mL), followed by those who report only home exposure\n(0.52 ng/mL). Levels were lowest for those who report being exposed only at work (0.11 ng/mL).\nMultivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between self-reported\nSHS exposure and cotinine measured exposure. We regressed the presence of detectable cotinine\n(yes/no) on self-reported exposure (yes/no) adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. For\nchildren and adolescents, only self-reported home exposure was included in the model. For adults,\nthree self-reported variables, exposure at home only, at work only, and both at home and at work, were\nincluded in the model. The results show that self-reported SHS exposure is a statistically significant\npredictor of cotinine-indicated exposure with odds ratios of 43.5 and 46.0 for children and adolescents.\nFor adults, the odds ratios were 90.0, 27.6 and 2.7 for exposure both in the home and at work, home\nonly, and work only, respectively. Children and adolescents living in households headed by someone\nwith education beyond high school, living in households above the poverty threshold, or who were\nMexican American, were less likely to have detectable cotinine level after controlling for self-reported\nSHS exposure. Adults with education beyond high school or in the mid or high income group were less\nlikely to have detectable cotinine level.\nTable 4.

Discussion\nSelf-reported SHS exposure rates for children fell significantly between 1999 and 2006; however\nthe prevalence rates of detectable cotinine and the mean cotinine levels did not show statistically\nsignificant trends. For adolescents and adults, the opposite occurred, with no significant trends in self-\nreported exposure, but a decrease in both the rate of people with detectable cotinine and the mean\ncotinine levels. All three SHS exposure measures are lower in the final time period compared to the\nfirst time period. However, the data for all measures show an increase during 2003-2004, and this\nmight have contributed to a lack of statistically significant trends in exposure for some groups. Over\nthe eight years we studied, serum cotinine concentration declined by 31% in children, 36% in\nadolescents, and 25% in adults. In contrast, Pirkle and colleagues [10] reported a 70% decline in serum\ncotinine concentration over the 14 years from 1988-2002. It is encouraging that the level of exposure\ncontinues to decline in more recent years.\nExposure patterns by demographic characteristics were similar when measured by either self-\nreports or serum cotinine. We found SHS exposure to be highest in children and also high in\nadolescents, consistent with earlier studies [10,11,13]. Among racial/ethnic groups, exposure rates and\nmean cotinine levels were highest in non-Hispanic Blacks across all age groups as documented in\nother studies [14-16], and lowest in Mexican American children [16] and adolescents. However, our\nfindings for black children raise some interesting questions. While black children had higher rates of\nself-reported exposure, the adjusted odds ratio was less than one. This implies that after adjusting for\nthe other demographic variables in the model, the exposure rates might have been lower. That would\nbe consistent with previous findings indicating that blacks smoke fewer cigarettes per day, and lower\nintensity of smoking is associated with lower SHS exposure [12,24]. In fact, we observed that black\nchildren were more likely to be living in poor or low income households compared to white children\n(67% vs. 37%). Furthermore, black children's exposure rates when stratified by poverty level were\nmuch lower than white counterparts for the poor group (36% vs. 51%) and low income group (25% vs.\n34%) but were higher only for the high income group (12% vs. 7%). Thus, the inter-relationship\namong race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and SHS exposure merits further research. Our findings\nindicate that poor children have the highest exposure rates and level of exposure. While were\nencouraged to find that both self-reported and cotinine-indicated exposure rates showed a significant\ndecline over the 8 years for poor children, the rates are still unacceptably high and there remains a\nneed to focus more effort on reducing the health risk for this particularly vulnerable group.\nWe found that the prevalence rate of self-reported SHS exposure was much higher than the\nprevalence rate of cotinine measured exposure, as shown in other studies [9,24-26]. This could be\nexplained by several factors. It is possible that people underreport their SHS exposure or that the\nsurvey designs lead to underreporting, particularly when self-reported SHS exposure is measured by\nthe presence of a self-identified smoker in the household. It is also possible that the large proportion of\nthe population with detectable cotinine is reflective of the widespread ubiquity of SHS in our\nenvironment and the challenges of controlling exposure in multiple settings. The self-reported\nexposure measure is based on questions pertaining to two environments only \u00ad the home and the\nworkplace. However, serum cotinine is not limited to those settings, and might also reflect exposure in\nrestaurants, other public and private places, and outdoors. There are also dietary sources of nicotine,\nand while these are unlikely to have a major impact on cotinine levels in the population as a whole,\nthey may have an impact on some individuals. Our findings suggest that the lower self-reported\nexposure levels underestimate the extent of the continuing public health issue.\nA number of limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. We did not have self-reported data\non exposure for anyone in other indoor or outdoor settings. We did not account for the self-reported\nexposure in the workplace for adolescents. Data on workplace exposure for adults for 2005-2006 were\nnot available at the time of our analyses. Serum cotinine is a good measure of SHS exposure during the\nprevious 3-4 days. However, it has a short half-life and thus would not measure exposure that had\noccurred more than a few days ago. However, cotinine is still considered the biomarker of choice for\nSHS exposure assessment [1].\nDespite many years of tobacco control efforts aimed at reducing SHS exposure in the home and\nworkplace, exposure to SHS in the home and in the workplace continues to be an important public\nhealth problem. While the prevalence of exposure as well as the mean cotinine concentration are lower\nthan they were decades earlier, people continue to be exposed. Children, adolescents, non-Hispanic\nBlacks, low income people, and people living in households headed by someone with low education\nremain particularly vulnerable.\n"
