    "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose. Studies have demonstrated beneficial health effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients, but predominantly\nin breast cancer. Research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer (PC) patients' side effects has been lacking. Our primary\ngoal was to determine the feasibility of recruiting PC patients on a clinical trial of yoga while they underwent external beam\nradiation therapy (RT). Methods. Twice-weekly yoga interventions were offered throughout the RT course (6-9 weeks).\nBaseline demographic information was collected. Feasibility was declared if 15 of the first 75 eligible PC patients approached\n(20%) were successfully accrued and completed the intervention. Additional end points included standardized assessments\nof fatigue, erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary incontinence (UI), and quality of life (QOL) at time points before, during, and\nand 45 (56%) consented to the study. 18 (40%) were voluntarily withdrawn due to treatment conflicts. Of the remaining\nsignificant variability, with fatigue increasing by week 4, but then improving over the course of treatment (P = .008). ED,\nUI, and general QOL scores demonstrated reassuringly stable, albeit not significant trends. Conclusions. A structured yoga\nintervention of twice-weekly classes is feasible for PC patients during a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient radiotherapy.\nPreliminary results are promising, showing stable measurements in fatigue, sexual health, UI, and general QOL.\n",

The impact of CRF\non a patient's ability to function in daily life is considerable,\nand it has been found to adversely affect patients' quality of\nlife (QOL) even more than pain.3-8 Fatigue is reported in\n40% to 75% of cancer patients. The prevalence of CRF\nincreases to 60% to 93% in patients receiving external beam\nradiation therapy (RT),3-5 and when Visual Analogue\nFatigue Scales were used, the percentage rose to 99%.9\nFurthermore, a significant number of cancer patients suffer-\ning from fatigue receive inadequate treatment for their\nsymptoms.1 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network\nguidelines recommend that integrative nonpharmacological\ninterventions be implemented for managing CRF. Various\nstudies have demonstrated a positive effect from physical\nactivity interventions during and after cancer treatment.\nThese studies also showed that exercise is safe and well tol-\nerated by patients during various cancer treatments, includ-\nexpected to undergo definitive RT at some point in their\nlifetimes. In addition to CRF, PC patients typically report\nhigh levels of urinary and sexual adverse effects before,\nduring, and after treatment, with more than half of the\npatients reporting poor sexual drive.14 Erectile dysfunction\n(ED) is defined by the National Institute of Health as \"the\ninability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for\nsatisfactory sexual performance.\"15(p. 83) ED is reported in\nprostate RT is still poorly understood, with\n1University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNeha Vapiwala, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of\nPennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, TRC 4 West, Philadelphia,\nEmail: vapiwala@uphs.upenn.edu\nYoga Intervention for Patients With\nProstate Cancer Undergoing External Beam\nRadiation Therapy: A Pilot Feasibility Study\nAvital Mazar Ben-Josef, DMD, MBA, RYT1, E.

Urge UI occurs\nwhen the bladder detrusor contracts involuntarily during\nbladder filling and is the more common type of inconti-\nnence seen with RT. The prevalence of UI after RT is 24%\nand may be acute or take years to develop.14,16 The popular-\nity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has\nbeen growing rapidly in the general population, with an\nestimated 70% of Americans currently using some CAM\nmodality.20 Among cancer patients, the prevalence of CAM\nuse has increased nearly 3-fold in the past two decades.21-23\nThe majority of cancer patients use some form of CAM,\nhoping to boost immunity, relieve pain, and/or control can-\ncer- and cancer treatment\u00adrelated morbidity.24 The National\nCenter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n(NCCAM) defines CAM as \"a group of diverse medical and\nhealth care systems, practices and products that are not\npresently considered to be part of conventional medicine\"\n(http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/). Yoga is a physi-\ncal, mental, and spiritual CAM practice aimed to bring body\nand mind together. Historically, most research on yoga as a\ntherapeutic modality has been performed in women, and\nspecifically breast cancer patients.25-28 In contrast, research\non the use of yoga as a modality for alleviating PC patients'\nside effects has been limited.29 Regarding sexual dysfunc-\ntion and yoga, there are a few published reports in women,\nbut to our knowledge, there are no data on the direct effects\nof yoga on ED. That said, as one of several mind-body prac-\ntices, yoga has been demonstrated to elicit a relaxation\nresponse characterized by decreased oxygen consumption,\nincreased levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO), and reduced\nstress.30 NO is known to play a prominent role in vascular\ndilation, which affects blood pressure.31 We hypothesize\nthat improving pelvic blood circulation as a result of an\nincrease in circulation blood NO levels may improve ED,\nalthough this hypothesis would need to be specifically and\nprospectively tested with biometric and QOL correlations.\nWith respect to UI, there is some evidence that yoga in com-\nbination with pelvic exercise can help reduce this symptom\nin women. We hypothesized that strengthening of the pelvic\nfloor muscles may reduce UI in PC patients.32,33 The main\ngoal of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of using\nyoga as a complementary treatment modality in PC patients.\nWe specifically sought to (1) determine if PC patients\nundergoing a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient RT as defini-\ntive or postoperative treatment would consent to participate\nin the study and comply with attendance of an intensive\ntwice-weekly yoga regimen and (2) study the effect of yoga\non fatigue, ED, UI, and general QOL during cancer\ntherapy.\nMethods\nParticipants\nAdult men with biopsy-proven PC who consented to undergo\na 6- to 9-week course of external beam RT at the University\nof Pennsylvania were recruited between May 2013 and June\n2014. Prospective participants were assessed for eligibility\non or before the day of radiation treatment planning (simula-\ntion). Patients were prescreened with PAR-Q/PAR-MED-X34\nfor barriers to participation in physical activity and deemed\neligible to participate when they met the following criteria:\nminimum age of 18 years, biopsy-proven diagnosis of clini-\ncal (intact) or pathological (postprostatectomy) stage I or II\nPC, suitable for a 6- to 9-week course of outpatient RT for\nPC, and English speaking. Patients were excluded if they,\naccording to their physicians, had medical restrictions that\ncould interfere with or preclude participation in the yoga\ninterventions, were active smokers (former smokers who\nhad been smoke free for the past 6 months or more could be\nincluded), currently participated in a yoga practice (any\nyoga classes on a regular basis within the past 6 months), or\nhad clinical evidence of metastatic disease.\nIntervention\nEischens yoga, an integrative style of yoga rooted in the Iyengar\npractice, is focused more on the energy of the poses rather than\nthe complexity and, thus, is more readily accessible for all body\ntypes and experience levels. The hands-on feedback technique\nhelps instructors to continually guide the students, to help them\nengage the weaker muscles in the body, and to actively improve\nalignment. This is believed to result in better posture and allow\nfor improved flexibility, greater self-awareness, higher pain tol-\nerance, and increased strength and energy.\nEischens yoga classes were held on several days during\nthe work week (typically late morning and late afternoon) at\ntheAbramson Cancer Center. Each class was led by a trained\nEischens yoga instructor, had between 4 and 8 participants,\nand lasted 75 minutes. A typical session included seated\n(using a chair), standing, and reclining poses (Table 1). Yoga\nposes were modified and included the use of props to facili-\ntate and adapt the poses for each participant's specific needs\nand restrictions. Each session began with breathing and cen-\ntering techniques as well as an inventory of energy and stress\nlevels.\nThere were 3 trained teachers available for this pilot\nstudy, but 77% of all classes were taught by the lead teacher\nand study first author, who is a certified Eischens yoga\nteacher. The remaining 23% of the classes were taught by 2\ncertified yoga teachers who were trained by the lead teacher\nin the details of the specific poses to be used for the study\nparticipants. Both assistant teachers also had prior experi-\nence working with cancer patients.\nAssessments\nPAR-Q/PAR-MED-X forms were used to assess patients' eli-\ngibility to participate in physical activity; these forms are\nderived from a 2007 collaboration of international authorities\nand regional health and fitness organizations seeking to reduce\nbarriers for low- to moderate-intensity physical activity par-\nticipation and to improve identification of individuals who\nmay require additional screening prior to becoming more\nphysically active. Background and demographic information\nwere collected at the initial meeting, including age, race/eth-\nnicity, marital/partner status, educational history, income,\nresidence location, travel time to facility, method of travel,\ndetails regarding comorbidities, disease stage, and details of\ncurrent radiotherapy.\nFatigue was assessed using the Brief Fatigue Inventory\n(BFI) questionnaire, a 9-item scale that rapidly assesses\nfatigue severity. The first 3 questions rate the severity of the\npatient's fatigue at its \"worst,\" \"usual,\" and \"now\" over the\npast 24 hours, with 0 indicating \"no fatigue\" and 10 indicat-\ning \"fatigue as bad as you can imagine.\" Six questions assess\nthe amount that fatigue has interfered with different aspects\nof the patient's life during the past 24 hours. The interfer-\nence items include general activity, mode, walking ability,\nnormal work (includes both work outside the home and\nhousework), relations with others, and enjoyment of life.\nThe interference items are measured on a 0 to 10 scale, with\n0 being does not interfere and 10 being completely inter-\nferes. Scores are simple sums of the items in each subscale.\nGeneral QOL was assessed using the FACT-G (Functional\nAssessment of Cancer Therapy\u00adGeneral), a 27-item validated\ninstrument measuring symptoms or problems associated with\nmalignancies across 4 scales: physical well-being (7 items);\nsocial/family well-being (7 items); emotional well-being (6\nitems); and functional well-being (7 items). Patients rate all\nitems using a 5-point rating scale ranging from not at all to very\nmuch. The measure yields information about total QOL as well\nas information about the dimensions of physical well-being and\ndisease-specific concerns. FACT-G takes about 5 minutes to\ncomplete and has been written at the sixth grade level.\nTheInternationalIndexofErectileFunctionQuestionnaire\n(IIEF-5), also referred to as the Sexual Health inventory for\nMen, was used to assess ED. Scores range from 0 to 25, with\nscores >21 indicating normal erectile function and scores\n<12 indicating moderate to severe ED. The International\nProstate Symptom Score Sheet (IPSS) was used to deter-\nmine the severity of urinary symptoms. Scores on this scale\nerately symptomatic and 20 to 35, severely symptomatic.\nThe final question on this scale addresses urinary QOL and\nis assigned a score of 1 to 6, where 6 is terrible.\nBFI forms were completed by patients at the following\ntime points:\n1. within2to3weekspriortostartofradiotherapy--thatis,\non the day of consultation or on the day of simulation;\n2. biweekly while receiving radiotherapy; and\n3. within a week of the last yoga class or at the end of\nthe EBRT course.\nFACT-G, IIEF-5, and IPSS forms were completed by\npatients at the following time points:\n1. within2to3weekspriortostartofradiotherapy--thatis,\non the day of consultation or on the day of simulation;\n2. in the fourth week of radiotherapy (when treatment-\nrelated symptoms are expected to peak); and\n3. within a week of the last yoga class or at the end of\nthe EBRT course.\nStatistical Considerations\nThis present study was designed as a single-arm longitudinal\npilot study of QOL measures, with a sample of 15 participants\nfor feasibility, to be followed by a larger randomized study. We\nspecifically aimed to achieve this goal of 15 out of the first 75\npatients approached because this represented an evaluable\npatient rate of 20%. We hoped to detect 80% participation in\nthe study intervention, defined as twice-weekly yoga class\nattendance throughout the entire radiation course.An observed\n80% participation in 15 patients gave us 80% power to reject\n50% or less participation using a 1-sided test at  = .05.\nAnalyses were conducted using Stata v13 (Stata Corporation,\nCollege Station,TX.). Secondary analyses examined the trends\nover time for QOL measures. Cross-tabulation and summary\nstatistics were used to make illustrations. We determined\nTable 1.

A total of 68 eligible PC patients were approached\nregarding this study after they agreed (but before they\nstarted) to undergo a course of therapeutic external beam\nradiation. Patient demographics are summarized in Table 2.\nOf the 68 patients approached, 23 (34%) declined to partici-\npate in the study. The most common reasons provided for\ndeclining participation were lack of time and incompatibil-\nity with work schedules, rather than a lack of interest or\n\"belief\" in yoga. Of the 45 remaining patients who con-\nsented to the study, 18 (40%) were withdrawn from the\nstudy early voluntarily by the principal investigator because\nof insufficient class attendance. The most common cause\ncited for inadequate class attendance was an unavoidable\nand unanticipated conflict between the radiation treatment\ntime and the yoga class schedule (15 of the 18; 83%). Of the\nrequired number of yoga classes and were ultimately\nTable 2.

The suc-\ncessful completion of the study by 15 patients out of the\nfirst 68 approached met our predefined protocol definition\nof a feasible intervention, and thus, feasibility was declared.\nWe have summarized the data across all time points in\nFigure 1. The measures were highly correlated within subject.\nBFI scales were correlated among time points, with  ranging\nfrom 0.6 to 0.7. FACT scales were slightly lower, ranging from\n0.84, and 0.78, respectively. The measures were also correlated\nwith each other, averaging 0.41 among measures.\nFatigue\nFigure 1 shows all 3 measures of fatigue (BFI\u00adseverity, BFI\u00ad\nimpact and BFI\u00adglobal). The global fatigue scores (Figure 1)\nshow a slight downward trend in the graph, with fatigue scores\nstaying in the low to midrange levels, but the model was not\nsignificant (P = .16). When looking at the impact of fatigue on\ndaily life (Figure 1), variation was also nonsignificant (P = .7).\nNevertheless, the severity of fatigue scores demonstrate a sig-\nnificant variability over time over the course of treatment (P =\n.008; Figure 1). Scores declined over the first 3 weeks but\nreturned to their prior levels by weeks 6 and 8.\nFunction and Quality of Life\nSexual health scores (IIEF-5) fell slightly over the course of\ntreatment, but the variation among time points was not sig-\nnificant. The IPSS increased sharply over the course of treat-\nment (P < .0001), with significant differences from baseline\nat 4 and 12 weeks. QOL scores associated with urinary\nsymptoms increased over the course of treatment (P = .005),\nwith significant changes at weeks 4 and 8. Functional, physi-\ncal, and social well-being parameters showed no significant\nchanges from baseline. Emotional well-being increased\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first published pilot study dem-\nonstrating the feasibility of an intensive yoga intervention for\npatients with PC undergoing outpatient radiotherapy. Two-\nthirds of the men approached were initially very enthusiastic\nand willing to take part in the yoga program. However, almost\nentirely because of conflicts between the radiation treatment\ntimes and the available yoga class schedule, one-third of the\npatients who started the program were unable to attend the\nrequisite minimum number of yoga classes.

Radiation\ntreatment machine malfunction leading to unpredictable\ndelays, severe inclement weather, and long travel time to and\nfrom the hospital were among the main issues that prevented\nenrolled patients from attending the twice-weekly classes\noffered at the hospital. But even despite these issues, the study\nmet our stringent definition of feasibility in this pilot study, in\nwhich we mandated a 20% rate of evaluable patients. Typical\nclinical trial enrollment rates among cancer patients have his-\ntorically been reported to be as low as 3%36; our rate of enroll-\nment was a surprising 66%, despite the prevailing perception\nthat \"old men don't do yoga.\" According to a published\nnational survey of yoga practitioners, we estimate that a little\nless than 7% of the adult yoga practitioner population com-\nprises men older than 44 years.37-39 Even after removing the\nstudy patients who had to be withdrawn early for noncompli-\nance, our rate of enrollment of eligible patients was nearly\n40%. Furthermore, we found that all the selected Eischens\nyoga poses were well tolerated by this patient population and\nwere approached with good will and, at times, a good sense of\nhumor. Most yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at\nthe end of each class; on finishing the yoga program and con-\ncluding their involvement in the study, many patients requested\nand received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs.\nThus far, we have also observed the potential for improve-\nment of CRF with this yoga intervention for PC patients\nundergoing active radiation treatment. The levels of fatigue\nthat are normally expected to increase midtreatment (weeks\n4 to 5) stayed unchanged, and the severity of the fatigue--\nthe ability to lead normal work and social lives--went to\npretreatment levels. These results are consistent with early\nstudies that demonstrated the ability of yoga interventions to\nreduce fatigue symptoms in breast cancer survivors.27\nAlbeit from nonrandomized data, our findings demon-\nstrate a potential positive signal for improvement in urinary\nsymptoms in patients undergoing radiation treatment for PC.\nAlthough the severity of the urinary symptoms expectedly\nincreased during the course of RT, the QOL associated with\nurinary symptoms stayed unchanged, with lower scores at\nthe range of \"pleased to mostly satisfied.\" Regarding male\nsexual health, with the exception of 1 patient who reported\nno ED, most patients had mild-moderate (IIEF-5 12-16) or\nmoderate (IIEF-5 8-11) ED. At present, we can only report\nstability in sexual function among those participating in the\nyoga intervention during radiation treatment. Further fol-\nlow-up and comparison with non-yoga-participating con-\ntrols are necessary. Overall, QOL parameters were\nmaintained throughout the treatment, with the exception of a\nstatistically significant decline in emotional well-being. This\ninitial decline (weeks 1 to 4) stabilized with the continuation\nof the yoga sessions. Because most patients reported a sense\nof well-being at the end of each class, one hypothesis is that\nthe emotional burden of daily radiation treatments was\nharder to overcome during the first half of radiation\ntreatment, but its negative effect decreased, and emotional\nwell-being stabilized as patients became increasingly profi-\ncient with their yoga practice.\nThere are several limitations to the present study. The\nsmall sample size of this pilot study and lack of a control arm\nnegates the ability to exclude an argument that the findings\nwere caused by a placebo effect. Furthermore, this study was\nnot designed to follow the participants' sustainability with\nany structured yoga practice and subsequently measure the\nlong-term effects (over a period of 1 to 3 years) of RT on ED\nand UI and, thus, QOL. Finally, attention and social support\nfrom other group members and/or instructors may have\nbiased the treatment effect and may have added to the overall\nmental and emotional well-being of the participants.\nFortunately, because our pilot feasibility criteria have\nbeen met, this study has continued seamlessly to a random-\nized phase II design. Future analysis of data from the full\ncomplement of yoga and non\u00adyoga participants in the ran-\ndomized phase of the study will permit more detailed evalu-\nation of the impact of a yoga intervention on fatigue, UI,\nED, and overall QOL. Until then, our study does strongly\nsuggest that PC patients, a population perhaps not tradition-\nally believed to have great interest in integrative and com-\nplementary therapies because of stereotypes of age and\ngender, may in fact prove to be a viable and attractive audi-\nence for such targeted interventions.At a minimum, the pre-\nliminary work presented here underscores the fact that PC\npatients have a clinically and emotionally significant need\nfor symptomatic management of fatigue and pelvic floor\ncompromise during cancer therapy and that nonmedical\napproaches should be considered in this setting.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was supported by an American Cancer Society Institutional\nResearch Grant.\nReferences\n1.
