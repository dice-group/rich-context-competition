Disparities in Youth Physical\nto examine changes in physical activity among children and adolescents, by race/ethnicity, in the United States from 2003\u00ad2004 to\n2005\u00ad2006. Methods: Secondary analysis of the objectively measured accelerometer data among children and adolescents 6\u00ad19 yr:\nfor sampling design and adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and number of hours monitored. We tested for differences in mean\naccelerometer counts per minute and minutes per day of moderate and vigorous physical activity trends by race/ethnicity and gender.\nResults: Physical activity decreased with age, boys were more active than girls, and non-Hispanic black children were more active\nan increase over time in mean accelerometer counts among 6- to 11-yr-old non-Hispanic white children (+52.4 counts per minute,\nP = 0.007; 95% confidence interval = 15.7\u00ad89) but a decrease among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children. No changes\nover the period in moderate and vigorous physical activity were found in either age group. Conclusions: The lack of improvement in\nphysical activity among all children and adolescents and a potentially emerging race\u00adethnic disparity indicate a need for further\nresearch on potential mechanisms underlying these differences. Effective interventions to improve physical activity opportunities and\nattenuate the decline in activity levels as children enter adolescence are needed. ",

This grow-\ning epidemic necessitates the identification and monitoring\nof modifiable behavioral contributors to energy imbalance.\nThe pivotal role of physical activity in weight management\namong adults is well established (19). Among children and\nadolescents, in addition to healthier weight gain during growth,\nthe health benefits of achieving recommended physical activ-\nity levels include a favorable body composition and improved\ncardiovascular health and muscular fitness. National guide-\nlines recommend that children and adolescents accumulate\nQ60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)\nResearch has consistently documented gender and age\ndisparities in youth physical activity such that boys are more\nactive than girls and children become less active as they grow\nethnic disparities in physical activity, but results have been\nmixed depending on self-report versus accelerometer esti-\nmates (39). The available data on trends over time indicate an\noverall decline in physical activities, including active trans-\nport to school (16), self-reported vigorous physical activity\n(1), and participation in high school physical education (3).\nMuch of the physical activity data have been traditionally\nassessed via questionnaires despite limited reliability and\nvalidity of self-reported activities, particularly for children\n(5). Recently, national accelerometer data measuring physi-\ncal activity levels among US children and adolescents have\nbecome available (32).

The NHANES is an ongoing series of\nnationwide surveys and clinical examinations conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The sur-\nveys use a multistage, clustered, probability sampling strat-\negy to select households and individuals to provide national\nestimates representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized\nUS population. Non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans,\nand adolescents ages 12\u00ad19 yr are among the oversampled\npopulations. Beginning in 1999, NHANES collected data\nyearly. This analysis includes two waves, four years of data\nlected using accelerometers among children and adolescents\nages 6\u00ad19. More complete description of data collection pro-\ncedures and analytic guidelines are on the NCHS Web site\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). Informed consent was\nobtained by the NCHS as part of the NHANES data collec-\ntion, and the institutional review board at the Harvard School\nof Public Health determined that, because we were using\npublicly available data, this work was exempt.\nFollowing the published research of Troiano et al. (32),\nwe included data from children and adolescents ages 6\u00ad19\nwith accelerometer data from these two nationally represen-\ntative samples. Our change analyses are presented for non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American\nchildren and adolescents only because of the small sample\nsizes for other racial/ethnic groups. We defined two age cat-\nto make our results comparable to previous research from\nthe same data set and reflect distinct developmental stages.\nAge, gender, and race/ethnicity were self-reported in home\ninterviews before accelerometer administration. Interviews\nfor participants G16 yr were conducted by a proxy.\nPhysical activity assessment. Measures of physical\nactivity including mean accelerometer counts per minute\nand minutes per day of MVPA were collected directly after\na health examination with the ActiGraph model 7164 accel-\nerometer (ActiGraph, LLC, Ft. Walton Beach, FL) (4). This\nsmall uniaxial device measures physical activity intensity by\nquantifying and recording ``counts'' of vertical acceleration\n(38) and was requested to be worn for 7 d (35). The ActiGraph\nIn addition, the ActiGraph has been validated against crite-\nrion measures (e.g., direct observation, oxygen consumption\n[V\n], HR, and doubly labeled water) and correlated with total\n(r = 0.39) and activity (r = 0.54) energy expenditure as mea-\nsured by the doubly labeled water (7).\nIn NHANES, the instrument was programmed to record\ndata continuously at 1-min intervals (or epochs). Participants\nages 6 and older were asked to wear an accelerometer on\nan elasticized belt positioned over their right hip during all\nwaking hours, only removing it for swimming or bathing.\nAssistants responsible for the medical examination adminis-\ntration fitted the accelerometers to participants and pro-\nvided initial instructions; further assistance with the activity\nmonitoring protocol was available over a toll-free number.\nParticipants mailed their accelerometers back to NHANES\nheadquarters in a prepaid envelope after the end of 7-d mon-\nitoring period (4).\nAccelerometer data processing. All analysis of ac-\ncelerometer data followed algorithms developed by Troiano\net al. (32), available at the National Cancer Institute Web\nsite (http://www.riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam). Fol-\nlowing these guidelines, we excluded data from participants\nwhose accelerometers were not calibrated on return. Im-\nplausible values, such as long sequences of very high counts,\nwere set to missing. Wear and nonwear times were defined\nto determine valid days. Nonwear time was defined as a\nperiod of at least 60 min of zero intensity counts, allowing for\n1- to 2-min spans with counts fewer than 101. Wear time\nwas calculated by subtracting nonwear time from 24 h. A\nvalid day was defined as any day with Q10 h of wear time\n(32). Our analyses only included youth with four or more\nvalid days of data consistent with prior recommendations in\nthe literature (33).\nMean counts per minute were calculated by dividing the\ntotal counts of activity by the minutes of wear time for all\nvalid days. We applied published age-specific count thresh-\nolds obtain from calibration studies by the Freedson group\nto calculate minutes of MVPA (34) as cited in Troiano et al.\nparticipants and 3 METs in 18- and 19-yr-old participants.\nWe used 1-min bouts to calculate total minutes per day\nof MVPA.\nStatistical analysis. Analyses were conducted with SAS\n(Version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We used the pro-\ncedures SURVEYMEANS and SURVEYREG to account for\nsamples weights and the clustered study design in estimating\nmeans and regressions documenting changes in physical ac-\ntivity between the two periods.

Among\nchildren, we observed racial\u00adethnic differences in change in\nmean accelerometer counts between the two time points as\nindicated by the significant negative interactions for His-\npanic and non-Hispanic black children with period. We did\nnot find significant changes between the time points in mean\naccelerometer counts or minutes of MVPA among children\nIt is also important to note the persistent and substantial\nage and gender differences in physical activity measures with\nadolescents being markedly less active than children and girls\nbeing less active than boys. These results are consistent with\nthe need for continued monitoring and the implementation of\neffective interventions that improve physical activity oppor-\ntunities for girls and attenuate declines in physical activity\nlevels as children enter adolescence.\nAlthough the present analyses are the first to document\nchanges over time in population-specific estimates of phys-\nical activity using nationally representative accelerometer\ndata, our results are consistent with earlier evidence for racial/\nethnic disparities in self-reported physical activity, including\ndeclines over time in physical education class participation\n(3) and in vigorous physical activity (1) among non-Hispanic\naccelerometer data indicates that young black children were\nmeeting physical activity recommendations at slightly higher\nrates than white children (39), it is the lack of improvement\nover time detected for non-Hispanic black and Mexican\nAmerican children in the present study--a possible emerging\ndisparity in physical activity--that is a cause for concern.\nThese results can be interpreted in the context of the\nenergy gap that contributes to growing overweight and obe-\nas the average resting metabolism for children and the aver-\nage body weight of 30 kg for a typical 9-yr-old boy from\nthe sample, we estimate that the increase in physical activ-\nity documented for non-Hispanic white children ages 6\u00ad11\nrepresents an increase of about 20.2 kcalIdj1. This level of\nchange, if not accompanied by increased energy intake,\ncould help to offset the average energy gap that has been\ncontributing to growing childhood obesity in the United States\n(37). The lack of change seen among non-Hispanic black\nand Hispanic children could, in fact, contribute to growing\ndisparities in childhood obesity.\nThis study uses objective measures of physical activity\nobtained using highly reliable accelerometers to produce\nphysical activity estimates that have been validated against\nmultiple end points. In addition, the large, nationally repre-\nsentative sample of children and adolescents with over-\nsampling of blacks and Mexican Americans improves the\nprecision of physical activity estimates for these population\ngroups.\nLimitations of the study include the use of two cross-\nsectional samples that do not follow the same children\nacross time and thus have less accurate estimates of change.\nNonresponse, either by refusing to partake in the study or\nforgetting to wear the accelerometer each day, may lead to\nsome bias.

In addition, the 1-min\nepoch used to collect accelerometer data may underestimate\nactivity levels for very young children because their activi-\nties often occur in relatively short bursts rather than in long\nbouts (2). The analysis also does not capture whether children\nhad any activity-limiting ailments or disabilities. Although we\nrecognize the effect of income and other measures of socio-\neconomic status on physical activity, we chose to focus on\nrace/ethnicity because family income frequently shifts across\ntime and has a complex relationship with race/ethnicity along\nthe pathway to disease and health behavior. Seasonality may\nhave effects on the physical activity pattern among children\nand adolescents. We explored this effect on our results by\nincluding a variable indicating whether a child is on school\nvacation between grades (generally indicating summer vaca-\ntion). However, our estimates did not change nor did it in-\ncrease the goodness of fit statistic (R2; data not shown).\nLastly, these data represent national physical activity patterns\ndata series to document population-specific trends in phys-\nical activity patterns using accelerometer data from future\nNHANES studies.\nAlthough this study does not examine how potential dif-\nferences in physical activity among racial/ethnic populations\nmay be emerging, differential access to resources, recent\nchanges in the US school climate and an increase in obesity\nprevention efforts including more physical activity in more\nprivileged communities may help to explain these potential\nhave reduced access to physical activity resources (e.g., rec-\nreational facilities, parks, playgrounds) and reduced access\nto safe playgrounds (6,8,11). Moreover, neighborhood factors\nthrough the built environmental (such as safety and walk-\nability) may be particularly large influences due to the per-\nsistence of racial segregation in the United States (17,25,40).\nThe initiation of No Child Left Behind in 2001 has\nsteadily shifted the focus of public schools to standardized\ntest achievement, and this focus has often led to declines in\nfunding for physical education, recess, and other school-day\ndeterminants of physical activity levels (29). Recent studies\nhave found racial differences in school sports participation,\nrequired physical education, and girls' physical activity levels\nin school (14,26). Because low-income and racial/ethnic mi-\nnority children get a larger percentage of their daily physical\nactivity within school settings, they are likely differentially\naffected by recent changes in school climate (13). Finally,\nbecause knowledge of the obesity epidemic has grown and\nbecome a national priority during the past decade, it is pos-\nsible that white children have been the early benefactors\nof physical activity interventions and programs within the\nThis evidence documenting a small overall change over\ntime in physical activity levels and disparities in activity\npatterns documents the need for continued focus on in-\ncreasing opportunities for physical activity among children\nand adolescents. Interventions targeted to racial/ethnic mi-\nnority children and adolescents at the policy, environment,\nand school levels have promise of reducing physical activ-\nity and obesity-related disparities (39). The Task Force for\nCommunity Preventive Services recommends increasing time\nin school-based physical education, urban design and land-\nuse policies at the community and street levels, as well as\nenhanced access to places for physical activity with informa-\ntional outreach as promising strategies for promoting physi-\ncal activity (12,31). Federal policies that require and enforce\nregular K-12 physical education and comprehensive school\nwellness policies can promote school environments that sup-\nport physical activity (29). Community change efforts can\nfocus on creating and restoring environments that are sup-\nportive of physical activity, which include safe parks, play-\nground, recreation areas and sidewalks (28). Particular focus\ncan be given to aesthetic and safety improvements because\nthese may address barriers to physical activity in otherwise\nwalkable, urban areas in poorer communities (21).\nThe recent nationally representative accelerometer data\nsuggest increases in overall accelerometer counts of physi-\ncal activity among non-Hispanic white children 6\u00ad11 yr,\nbut not among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks.\nThe insights gleaned from this study may help target pre-\nvention efforts and provide useful information to ameliorate\nracial/ethnic disparities in physical activity. Our results docu-\nment the need to develop interventions that can address these\nemerging disparities, improve physical activity opportunities\nfor girls, and attenuate the decline in activity levels as chil-\ndren enter adolescence.\nThis work was supported in part by grants from the Donald\nand Sue Pritzker Nutrition and Fitness Initiative, the Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation (no. 66284), and National Center for Chronic\nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion (Prevention Research\nThis work is the sole responsibility of the authors and does\nnot represent official views of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention.\nThe authors disclose no conflict of interests.\nThe results of the present study do not constitute endorsement\nby the American College of Sports Medicine.\nREFERENCES\n1.
