The immune system is\nknown to play a major role in the develop-\nment and pathogenesis of psoriasis; how-\never, despite numerous studies focused on\nthis disease, the detailed aetiology remains\nunknown. It is possible that many condi-\ntions involving immune and metabolic dis-\norders underlie psoriasis.\nThe incidence of cardiovascular disease is\nincreased in patients with psoriasis2 and the\nrisk of developing cardiovascular disease is\npredominant in young people with psoria-\nsis.3 Metabolic syndrome (defined according\nto the unified criteria of the International\nDiabetes Federation, American Heart\nAssociation, National Heart, Lung and\nBlood Institute)4 is characterized by compo-\nnents such as dyslipidaemia, obesity, hyper-\ntension and insulin resistance. Metabolic\nsyndrome is a good predictor of cardiovas-\ncular disease,4 and the increasing prevalence\nof metabolic syndrome constitutes a major\nhealth problem in terms of coronary heart\ndisease, due to the components involved.\nThe objectives of the present study were\nto assess clinical and laboratory parameters\nassociated with metabolic syndrome, com-\nparing levels between Turkish patients with\nmoderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis; in\naddition, levels of these parameters between\npatients with psoriasis and those with non-\npsoriatic dermatological disease were also\nstudied.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis cross-sectional study included\nCaucasian Turkish patients with moderate\nor severe plaque-type psoriasis and patients\nwith nonpsoriatic dermatological conditions\n(controls), who presented at the Dermatol-\nogy Clinic of Gaziantep University, Gazi-\nwere sequentially enrolled. Specific inclusion\ncriteria for the patient group were patients\nwith psoriasis who had a psoriasis area and\nseverity index (PASI) score !10, and who\nhad not received any systemic treatment\n(including acidretin, cyclosporine, metho-\ntrexate, phototherapy or biological agents)\nwithin the previous 3 months.5 Specific\ninclusion criteria for the control group\nwere patients diagnosed with verruca vul-\ngaris, tinea pedis, acne vulgaris, contact\ndermatitis, lichen planus, neurodermatitis\nor atopic dermatitis. All study participants\nprovided written informed consent and the\nstudy was approved by the local clinical and\ndrug investment ethics committee of Gazi-\nantep University Faculty of Medicine\nStudy protocol\nPsoriasis area and severity index scores were\ndetermined by dividing the body into four\nsections: head, H (10% of a person's skin);\n(40%). For each section, the percentage area\nof skin involved is estimated then trans-\nformed into a grade between 0 and 6: grade\nof involved area. Within each area, psoriasis\nseverity was estimated by three clinical signs:\nerythema (redness), induration (thickness)\nand desquamation (scaling). Severity par-\nameters were measured on a scale of 0\u00ad4,\nwhere 0 denoted no psoriasis and 4 denoted\nmaximum severity. The sum of all three\nseverity parameters was then calculated for\neach section of skin, multiplied by the area\nscore for that area and then multiplied by\nthe weight of the respective section (0.1 for\narea was scored individually, then the four\nscores were combined to determine the final\nPASI score.\nBlood pressure, waist circumference,\nbody weight and height were measured for\neach patient. Serum samples were obtained\nfor assessment of fasting blood glucose,\ntriglycerides, high density lipoprotein\n(HDL), fibrinogen, homocysteine and adi-\nponectin levels. Blood pressure measure-\nments were performed using an ERKA\n(ERKA, Bad To\n\u00a8 lz, Germany) with the\npatient in a seated position, following\n!20 min of rest and no smoking or intake\nof caffeine for 24 h prior to the measure-\nment. At 08.00 h, following an overnight\nfast, 10-ml venous blood samples were col-\nlected from each study participant into\nvacutainers without additives. To obtain\nserum, blood samples were immediately\nprocessed by allowing blood to clot at\nroom temperature for 30 min followed by\nSerum samples were analysed immediately\nor stored at 4\u00ad6C prior to analysis. Serum\nlevels of homocysteine were assessed using a\nhigh performance liquid chromatography-\nReagent kit for HPLC analysis; Chromsys-\ntems Instruments and Chemicals GmbH,\nMunich, Germany) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. Fibrinogen levels\nwere measured by the Clauss clotting\nmethod6 with Fibri-prest\u00d5 test kits (Diag-\nnostica Stago, Asnieres sur Seine, France)\nusing a Stago STA Compact Coagulation\nAnalyzer (Diagnostica Stago). Fasting\nblood glucose, triglyceride and HDL levels\nwere measured with commercial test kits\n(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)\naccording to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions, using an autoanalyser (Roche/Hitachi\nModular DP Systems, Mannheim,\nGermany). Adiponectin levels were assessed\nusing enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay commercial kits (Zen-Bio, Research\nTriangle Park, NC, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions.\nPatients were required to wear light\nclothes for waist circumference measure-\nments, during which the abdomen was\nmeasured at the superior border of the iliac\ncrest. The measurement was performed fol-\nlowing normal exhalation with the patient\nfree of any compression. Body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated by dividing body\nweight in kg by height in m. Metabolic\nsyndrome was diagnosed according to the\nNational Cholesterol Education Program\u00ad\nAdult Treatment Panel (NCEP\u00adATP) III\ncriteria7 (Table 1).\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses of parameters were per-\nformed using the SPSS\u00d5 software package,\nversion 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)\nTable 1.

Data were evaluated using\ndescriptive statistics (mean, SD, SE) in\naddition to independent t-test for paired-\ngroup comparisons, 2-test and Fisher's\nexact test for comparison of qualitative\ndata. Results were considered statistically\nResults\nA total of 90 patients were enrolled: 50 with\nmoderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis\n(patient group) and 40 with nonpsoriatic\ndermatological conditions (control group).\nThe patient group comprised 26 male (52%)\nand 24 female (48%) patients; the control\nfemale (50%) patients. In the control group,\n15 patients were diagnosed with verruca\nvulgaris, seven with tinea pedis, five\nwith acne vulgaris, five with contact derma-\ntitis, three with lichen planus, three with\nneurodermatitis and two with atopic\ndermatitis.\nSex and age distribution patterns were\nsimilar between the two groups. Statistical\nanalyses of systolic blood pressure, trigly-\ncerides, HDL, fasting blood glucose, waist\ncircumference, BMI, homocysteine, adipo-\nnectin and fibrinogen parameters between\nboth groups showed that systolic blood\npressure (P \u00bc 0.01) and fibrinogen\n(P < 0.001) levels were higher, and adipo-\nnectin levels were lower (P < 0.001), in the\npatient group than in the control group.\nThere were no between-group statistically\nsignificant differences in the other param-\neters measured (Table 2).\nBetween-group comparisons revealed\na significantly higher prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome in the patient group compared\nwith the control group (25 patients [50%]\nwith psoriasis versus 10 control group\nNo statistically significant difference was\nfound in the prevalence of metabolic syn-\ndrome between male and female patients\nwithin the patient and control groups.\nTable 2.

There\nwere no statistically significant differences in\nother parameters. Adiponectin levels were\nsignificantly lower in the female patient\ngroup compared with the female control\ngroup (P < 0.001). In addition, there were\nno statistically significant differences in\nother parameters between the two female\ngroups.\nSubgroup analyses between patients with\nmoderate psoriasis and those with severe\npsoriasis revealed no statistically significant\ndifferences in abdominal obesity, hypertri-\nglyceridaemia, HDL, hyperglycaemia or\nhypertension levels (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nPatients diagnosed with psoriasis constitute\n0.7\u00ad1.3% of polyclinic visits in dermatology\ndepartments.8,9 Psoriasis may be associated\nwith many underlying conditions\ninvolving immune and metabolic disorders.\nPopulation-based studies have shown a\nhigher risk for mortality in younger patients\nwith severe psoriasis,10 mainly due to an\nincreased risk of heart attack associated with\narterial and venous thrombosis.11 The pre-\nsent study aimed to compare patients with\nmoderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis, to\ndetermine the frequency of metabolic syn-\ndrome parameters, which are known to be\ngood predictors of cardiovascular disorders.\nThe study involved a small number of\npatients, which led to a large variance in\nthe data obtained. Indeed, although the\nodds ratios (OR) showed positive associ-\nations (e.g. abdominal obesity [OR 1.43]\nhypertriglyceridaemia [OR 1.35] and hyper-\ntension [OR 1.18]), such differences were not\nstatistically significant: this may have been\ndue to the small sample size, which resulted\nin wide variations in confidence intervals.\nThe prevalence of metabolic syndrome\nwas 33.9% in a Turkish population-based\nstudy and differed significantly between\npants.12 The present study revealed no sig-\nnificant difference in the presence of\nmetabolic syndrome between patients\nof different sexes. However, the prevalence\nFigure 1. Prevalence of metablic syndrome in patients with psoriasis (n \u00bc 50) and controls (n \u00bc 40) with\nnonpsoriatic dermatological conditions. In a total of 25 psoriasis patients and 10 control-group patients (25%)\nof metabolic syndrome was higher in the\npsoriasis group and lower in the nonpsor-\niasis group, compared with overall preva-\nlence of metabolic syndrome reported in the\nTurkish study.12 The authors acknowledge\nthat the choice of control group may have\naffected (and could have biased) the present\nresults. The chosen control group consisted\nof other patients receiving dermatology\ncare, many of whom were also likely to\nhave low-grade, chronic inflammation that\ncould have led to metoabolic syndrome.\nThis means that the present findings may\nunderestimate the results, because people\nwith other dermatological conditions may\nnot be representative of the general popula-\ntion. For example, acne is known to be\nassociated with a heightened prevalencee of\nmetabolic syndrome.13\nTo the authors' knowledge, there are no\npopulation-based data relating metabolic\nsyndrome and psoriasis in the Turkish\npopulation. The existence and magnitude\nof an association between metabolic syn-\ndrome and psoriasis in the general Turkish\npopulation, therefore, remains unknown.\nIn a US population-based study that also\nused NCEP\u00adATP III criteria, the prevalence\nof metabolic syndrome in patients with\npsoriasis was 40%, which was similar to\nthe prevalence found in the present study.14\nIn addition, the prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome in individuals without psoriasis\nwas approximately half of that found in the\nA study in Germany, which compared\n541 patients with moderate and severe\nplaque-type psoriasis with a control group\nbolic syndrome was 25% in patients\nwith psoriasis and 11% in the controls.\nPrevalence rates for hyperlipidaemia, arter-\nial hypertension, coronary artery disease\nand type 2 diabetes were higher in patients\nwith psoriasis compared with the control\ngroup. Obesity was significantly higher in\nmale compared with female patients.15 As\nwith the present study, no difference was\nfound between male and female patients\nwith psoriasis, in terms of body weight and\nincidence of diabetes and coronary artery\ndisease. Another study16 compared patients\n(n \u00bc 3 854) plaque-type psoriasis with a con-\ntrol group, and included parameters such as\nhypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia,\nobesity and smoking (all of which are risk\nfactors for coronary artery disease). In\npatients with moderate psoriasis, levels of\ndiabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,\nobesity and smoking were higher compared\nwith levels observed in the control group.\nTable 3.

In the present study,\nthe authors did not routinely collect infor-\nmation on other possible confounding fac-\ntors, such as smoking status.\nUnlike other published studies, the pre-\nsent study found no difference in BMI and\nwaist circumference measurements between\nthe psoriasis and control groups. In accord-\nmetabolic syndrome parameters between the\nmoderate and severe psoriasis groups\nrevealed no differences. However, this may\nbe due to the relatively small number of\npatients in each group, in the present study.\nIn addition, there was no difference in\nHDL and triglyceride levels in patients with\npsoriasis compared with controls, in the\npresent study. Absence of factors such as\nobesity and diabetes, which have an impact\non hyperlipidaemia, may account for the\nlack of difference in hyperlipidaemia rates\nbetween the groups. In a population-based\ncomparative study in the UK, no significant\nrelationship was found between psoriasis\nand hyperlipidaemia when factors affecting\nlipid levels (such as obesity and diabetes)\nHypertension is reported to be higher in\npatients with psoriasis compared with con-\ntrols.16\u00ad20 Echocardiograph and left ven-\ntricular abnormalities were also found to\nbe more frequent in patients with psoria-\nsis.20 Similarly, the present study found\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure to be\nhigher in the psoriasis group compared with\nin controls. It is likely that hypertension and\npsoriasis may share common risk factors.\nFor example, angiotensin II \u00ad a product of\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) \u00ad is\nknown to regulate vascular tone and stimu-\nlate the release of proinflammatory cyto-\nkines. Increased levels of serum ACE, in\naddition to increased serum renin activity,\nhave been reported in patients with\nIn the present study, no differences in\nobesity or hyperglycaemia rates were found\nbetween the psoriasis and control groups.\nHowever, serum adiponectin levels were\nlower in patients with psoriasis compared\nwith controls. Adiponectin is a protein-\nbased hormone, produced naturally by the\nbody, that reduces blood vessel tissue\ninflammation;23 adiponectin levels are\nabnormally low in obese patients.24 Lower\nserum levels of adiponectin without any\ndifference in obesity may suggest that the\nincreased prevalence of cardiovascular dis-\nease in patients with psoriasis is related to\ninflammation in the blood vessels. In the\npresent study, the reduced adiponectin levels\nobserved in patients in the psoriasis group,\ncompared with controls, were inversely\ncorrelated with the prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome, which was higher in the psoriasis\ngroup, with no difference between male and\nfemale patients. Metabolic syndrome is\nknown to be more prevalent in male\npatients, although the results of the present\nstudy contradict this understanding. This\nmay be due to an unknown mechanism \u00ad\nleading to the development of metabolic\nsyndrome in patients with psoriasis \u00ad that\naffects both sexes.\nIncreased levels of plasma fibrinogen and\nhomocysteine are risk factors for coronary\nartery disease.25 An association between\nincreased plasma levels of fibrinogen and\nmetabolic syndrome-related factors such as\nhyperglycaemia, hypertension and hypertri-\nglyceridaemia has been shown in numerous\nelevated serum fibrinogen levels in patients\nwith psoriasis, but no difference in\nhomocysteine levels. Due to the limited\nnumber of studies, further investigations\ninto the association between psoriasis and\nprothrombotic and proinflammatory cyto-\nkines (such as fibrinogen, homocysteine and\nadiponectin) are required.\nFor investigating the possible connec-\ntions between psoriasis, cardiovascular dis-\nease and associated risk factors, Miller\net al.29 conducted a meta-analysis of obser-\nvational studies using random-effects statis-\ntics. Of 835 references obbtained in the\noriginal search, Miller's group identified 75\nfound that psoriasis was associated\nwith ischaemic heart disease and cardiovas-\ncular risk factors, with the strongest\nassociations being seen in hospital-based\nstudies. Population-based studies did not\nshow significant associations, except for\nIn conclusion, the higher prevalence of\nmetabolic syndrome observed in patients\nwith psoriasis in the present study indi-\ncates that psoriasis may lead to an\nincreased risk of cardiovascular disease.\nThe finding of reduced adiponectin levels\nwithout the presence of obesity may be\nimportant, in relation to the tendency of\npatients with psoriasis to develop cardio-\nvascular disease. The authors believe that\nimprovement of modifiable metabolic syn-\ndrome parameters in patients with psoria-\nsis may contribute to a reduction in the\nrisk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, the\nauthors suggest that patients with psoria-\nsis should be evaluated for systemic par-\nameters in addition to skin lesions, and\nconsultations with specialists other than\ndermatologists should be sought when\nappropriate.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
