    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe English National Health Service (NHS) is undergoing significant reorganization following the 2012 Health and Social\nCare Act. Key to these changes is the shift of responsibility for commissioning services from Primary Care Trusts (PCTs)\nto general practitioners (GPs) working together in Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). This article is based on an\nempirical study that examined the development of emerging CCGs in eight case studies across England between September\n2011 and June 2012. The findings are based on interviews with GPs and managers, observations of meetings, and reading of\nrelated documents. Scott's notion that institutions are constituted by three pillars--the regulative, normative, and cognitive\u00ad\ncultural--is explored here. This approach helps to understand the changing roles and identities of doctors and managers\nimplicated by the present reforms. This article notes the far reaching changes in the regulative pillar and questions how these\nchanges will affect the normative and cultural\u00adcognitive pillars.\n",

Because of those\nvalues and principles you have to take your people with you.\nIntroduction\nThe Institution of the NHS\nIn July 2012, London hosted the Olympic Games and televi-\nsion viewers across the world tuned in to watch the opening\nceremony. Amid depictions of a selection of key moments in\nBritish history and cultural life was a tribute to the National\nHealth Service (NHS). A newspaper headline later pro-\nclaimed, \"Americans baffled by `left-wing tribute' to free\nhealthcare during Opening Ceremonies,\" with a Los Angeles\nTime sports reporter, Diane Pucin commenting, \"For the life\nof me, though, I am still baffled by NHS tribute at opening\nceremonies. Like a tribute to United Health Care or some-\nthing in US\" (Press Association, 2012). Danny Boyle, direc-\ntor of the ceremony, said, \"He chose to feature it because\n`everyone is aware of how important the NHS is to\neverybody in this country'\" (Stebner, 2012). The prominence\nof the sequence in the ceremony alongside references to\nimportant moments in the nation's social history certainly\nsuggests that the NHS is an institution sufficiently deeply\nembedded within Britain to contribute significant meaning to\nits society\nThe NHS is a relatively young institution that came into\nbeing in 1948 and was for some time inextricably linked with\nthe restructuring and nation-building that characterized the\npost-war period. In charting the history of the NHS, Baggott\n(2004) points out its popularity among post-war generations\nwho have grown up with the welfare state. For those with no\npre-1948 experience, a health service that is free at the point\nof delivery and paid for out of taxation still constitutes the\n\"natural\" order of things, although the waves of crisis around\nmanagement, finance, and reorganization that have beset the\n1University of Manchester, UK\n2University of Kent, Canterbury, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nJulia Segar, Centre for Primary Care, University of Manchester, 5th Floor,\nWilliamson Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.\nEmail: julia.segar@manchester.ac.uk\nChanging the Ties That Bind? The\nEmerging Roles and Identities of General\nPractitioners and Managers in the New\nClinical Commissioning Groups in the\nEnglish NHS\nJulia Segar1, Kath Checkland1, Anna Coleman1, Imelda\nMcDermott1, Stephen Harrison1, and Stephen Peckham2\n Keywords\nEngland, NHS, institution theory, Clinical Commissioning Groups, GPs, managers\n2 SAGE Open\nNHS from the 1970s onward together with scandals concern-\ning patient care have shaken employee and public confidence\nin aspects of the institution. Nevertheless, as Appleby (2012)\npoints out, recent surveys of public satisfaction with the\nNHS fluctuate but remain fairly high. Moreover, public sup-\nport for the principle that it is \"the government's responsibil-\nity to provide health care for the sick\" is undiminished, while\nbacking for government support for the unemployed has\nfallen (Park, Bryson, Clery, Curtice, & Phillips, 2013, Table\nIt is not surprising, then, that Danny Boyle should choose\nthe NHS as a symbol of \"Britishness\" and that outsiders\n(Americans) would find attachment to this institution baf-\nfling. The suggestion of a \"left wing tribute\" also highlights\nthe idea that the NHS is emblematic of the welfare state\nwhere health care is provided to all irrespective of wealth or\nstatus. Recent work focusing on developments within the\nNHS (Checkland, Harrison, Snow, McDermott, & Coleman,\nhas suggested that Scott's analytic approach to institutions\ntinent. Located within the tradition of sociological institu-\ntionalism, Scott argues that institutions can be understood in\nterms of three constitutive elements or pillars: the regulative,\nnormative, and cognitive\u00adcultural pillars. Institutions are\nshaped by sets of rules and regulations (the regulative pillar)\nenforced by sanctions and sometimes coercion. Scott argues\nthat the regulative aspects of institutions are those of which\nwe may be most conscious. The normative pillar of institu-\ntions refers to the norms and values held by individuals and\nthe behavior that ensues from their efforts to uphold these\nvalues. Institutions, Scott (2008) asserts, \". . . are widely\nviewed as having moral roots\" (p. 56), which shape the con-\nduct and behavior of individuals. The cognitive\u00adcultural pil-\nlar of institutions refers to the taken-for-granted and\nunremarked aspects of institutional life. These are the char-\nacteristics that an outsider may remark on but which the\n\"native\" intuits (as explicated by Geertz, 1973). We attach\nmeaning to how various institutions work; Scott &\nChristensen (1995) use the term \"cultural template\" (p. xviii)\nand assert we will understand what constitutes a commercial\ncorporation, a school, or a hospital. The cultural template we\nhave for each will be different and we can see how the mean-\nings we attach to these kinds of institutions will be deter-\nmined by context and history.\nMacfarlane et al. (2011) and Checkland, Harrison, et al.\n(2012) explain how Scott's institutional theory might help in\nunderstanding the NHS. The NHS is made up of many differ-\nent organizations including hospitals, public health, dental\nservices, GP surgeries, and so on. These organizations over-\nlap and are staffed by individuals with a range of profes-\nsional interests, for example, managers, nurses, and doctors.\nHowever, these writers argue that despite organizational and\nprofessional differences, the NHS as a whole has a particular\nethos and set of values with which the workforce can and\ndoes identify. So the managers interviewed by Macfarlane et\nal. strongly identified with the \"socialist origins and egalitar-\nian, no-frills values\" of the NHS (Macfarlane et al., 2011, p.\n919), while the doctors and managers in Checkland et al.'s\nstudies saw themselves as being part of an \"NHS family.\"\nFurthermore, there are a range of embedded cognitive\u00adcul-\ntural assumptions that NHS \"insiders\" take for granted, such\nas an assumption that those working in the NHS, regardless\nof their employing organization, are members of a shared\ncommon enterprise (Checkland, Harrison, et al., 2012).\nOne of the key concerns of Scott's institutionalism is the\nidea of stability and continuity: Something is said to have\nbecome \"institutionalised\" when it has become self-perpetu-\nating (Scott, 2008, p. 22). This is not to say that institutions\ncannot change, and understanding when and how such\nchange will occur is one of the key empirical puzzles for\ninstitutional scholars. The NHS is clearly a different institu-\ninstitutional theory can help us to think about how that\nchange might have occurred and become embedded over\ntime. Sustained change requires that the three pillars remain\naligned, with regulative changes backed up by complemen-\ntary evolution in both norms and cognitive\u00adcultural mental\nargues that regulatory changes unmatched by changes to\nnorms or cognitive scripts generated dysfunctional change in\nthe American health system. The past two decades alone\nhave witnessed profound changes affecting the English NHS.\nFor many commentators, the NHS and Community Care Act\nof 1990 was a watershed regulatory change, as it marked the\nbeginning of the purchaser\u00adprovider split and quasi-market.\nWith these reforms came challenges to medical professional\ncontrol and autonomy, increasing self-regulation and surveil-\nlance, and the entry of private providers into the NHS mar-\nMcDonald, Harrison, & Checkland, 2008). Commentators\nhave noted that competition, regulation, and the quasi-mar-\nket are stronger features of the English NHS in comparison\nwith those of Wales and Scotland, whose governance is\ndevolved from British central government (Greer, 2008).\nHarrison (2009) focuses on the introduction of self-regu-\nlation and commodification of health care through mecha-\nnisms such as the Quality Outcomes Framework (an incentive\nscheme for GPs with financial rewards going to practices\naccomplishing tasks on a menu of patient care indicators).\nHe shows that these regulations challenge normative views\nconcerning the professional roles of doctors, but suggests\nthat this \"commodification\" can, in time, become \"natu-\nralised\" as the normal way doctors think about their practice.\nThus, it seems that the profound regulatory changes experi-\nenced by the NHS in the past have been accompanied by\nsome shifts in the cognitive\u00adcultural taken-for-granted\nunderstandings among institutional members.\nIn the next section, we explore the possibilities of such\nshifts through an examination of the process of doctors\nSegar et al. 3\nbecoming managers, a process that is certainly not new but\nhas recently become more pronounced.\nChanging Roles and Identities: Doctors Becoming\nManagers\nOne of the shifts in institutional cognitive\u00adcultural assump-\ntions identified by Harrison (2009) was the way in which\nmanagerial ways of thinking became normalized among\nmembers of the medical profession. This normalization has\nboth fed and been fed by the significant increase in formal\nmanagerial roles for both doctors and nurses within the NHS,\ninitially mainly in hospitals but more recently also in primary\nIndeed, although Harrison (1988) noted that some clinicians,\nincluding GPs, have been involved in NHS management\nsince 1974, present reforms set the scene for GPs to be\ninvolved in management in unprecedented numbers.\nThe subject of \"doctors as managers\" has received a great\ndeal of attention and is particularly relevant here because it\ntouches on both the normative elements of what it means to\nbe a professional clinician and the deeper cognitive\u00adcultural\nassumptions, which underpin identity. What are the responsi-\nbilities and duties of a doctor and of a manager and what\nhappens when these roles are combined? A recurrent theme\nin this literature is the way in which doctors who take on\nmanagerial roles are confronted with questions about their\nidentity and in so doing often choose to reassert the primacy\nof their identities as clinicians. This was nicely illustrated by\nLord Darzi, a London surgeon, who was asked by the then\nLabor government to undertake a \"review\" of the NHS in\n2008. This was, in essence, a managerial task, but the final\nreport (Department of Health, 2008) is illustrated by a photo-\ngraph of Lord Darzi wearing operating theater clothes. He\nchose to present himself as primarily a clinician, although he\nwas acting in a managerial capacity.\nIn this context, we take \"roles\" to be the formal and infor-\nmal expectations held by individuals and their colleagues\nabout the duties and responsibilities associated with holding\nparticular positions (Katz & Kahn, 1978). \"Identities\" are\n\"the individual's own notion of who and what they are\"\nthe social situation in which they find themselves. Forbes,\ngest that doctors in hospitals who take on managerial roles\nundergo a recategorization of the social self. They regard\nthemselves as doctors first, primarily responsible to their\npatients, and some engage in \"organisational misbehaviour,\"\nwhich obstructs the work of senior managers. Both Mo\nis regarded as something that takes doctors away from their\nclinical work where their prime loyalties and allegiances lie.\nThey also make the point, as does Doolin (2001), that man-\nagement work has lesser status than clinical work and that\nthose doctors taking on managerial roles adversely affect\ntheir reputation in the eyes of their peers. Working in these\n\"hybrid\" roles entails a blurring of boundaries and hence\ngives rise to anxieties about identity. Similarly, nurses in\nmanagerial roles are keen to prioritize their clinical qualifica-\ntions over new leadership titles (Martin & Learmonth, 2012),\nand to make the point that they are nurses first and managers\nsecond (Bolton, 2005). McDermott, Checkland, Harrison,\nSnow, and Coleman (2013) make a similar observation in\nrespect of GPs who took on managerial roles under the\nscheme known as Practice Based Commissioning (PBC).\nPBC was a voluntary scheme that enabled groups of GP\npractices known as consortia to become involved in the com-\nmissioning of services. While participating GPs were enthu-\nsiastic about the scheme itself, GPs who took on managerial\nroles as GP commissioners identified themselves as GPs\nrather than as managers and displayed low levels of certainty\nabout their roles as managers. It could be argued that these\nuncertainties and tensions have an origin, at least in part, in\nsome deep-seated and only partially conscious cognitive\u00ad\ncultural assumptions about what a GP \"is\" and what they\n\"do.\"\nThus, clinicians taking on managerial roles continue to\nclaim that their prime allegiance remains to the ideal of\npatient care. Similarly, research among managers working in\nthe NHS suggests that they too have a strong commitment to\npatient care and to public service (Currie & Brown, 2003;\nagers' concern for patient welfare and points out that they\nshare a similar \"commitment to the values and ethos of the\nNHS\" (p. 564) as their clinical counterparts, contesting the\nstereotype of the gray suited manager concerned solely with\nthe \"bottom line\"\nSince the 1980s, managers in the NHS have borne the\nbrunt of politically inspired, top\u00addown reorganization and\nchange. This has been referred to by McMurray (2010) as a\n\"pandemic of organisational reforms\" (p. 56), which he sug-\ngests results in \"response fatigue\" among affected managers.\nNevertheless, Greener's (2008) study concluded that while\nNHS managers'work is constantly changing, they keep sight\nof their long-term goal to serve the best interests of the pub-\nlic. Likewise, Macfarlane et al. (2011) found that senior NHS\nmanagers held fast to their ideals of an NHS culture rooted in\na belief of public service.\nIt has been suggested that a public service ethos is charac-\nterized by traits such as working for the good of the commu-\nnity, loyalty to one's institution, and accountability to the\npublic (Pratchett & Wingfield, 1996). This implies that ideas\nabout public service are deeply connected to people's sense\nof identity, incorporating both a normative understanding\nabout roles and duties and a deeper cognitive\u00adcultural con-\nception of what it means to be a public servant. McDonough\n(2006) attempts to unravel these understandings using\nBourdieu's notion of habitus to explain Toronto-based\nmunicipal workers' fierce attachment to a sense of public\nservice even when experiencing restructuring, cutbacks, and\n4 SAGE Open\nprivatization of services. She argues that their \"public ser-\nvice habitus\" usually remains subconscious but is forced into\nconsciousness when confronted with the idea that the private\nsector may be more efficient. She suggests that the idea of\nwhat constitutes the public good will be increasingly con-\ntested and potentially shifted by the continued restructuring,\nresulting in a \"destabilised habitus\" for affected workers.\nScott (2008) considers the way in which institutions\nchange, and of interest here, discusses how they may weaken\nand disappear. He points out that scholarly analysis often\nhighlights one aspect--regulative or normative or cognitive\u00ad\ncultural change--as precipitating deinstitutionali-zation but\nargues that these elements usually interact with one another.\nFor the NHS, it can be argued that successive regulative\nchange has clearly shifted the roles and duties of personnel\nand may, as noted above, also begin to shift norms and val-\nues. Doctors and nurses who take on managerial roles are\ndescribed as becoming \"hybrids\" while health care profes-\nsionals who implement guidelines and algorithms are seen as\nhaving been gradually \"co-opted\" by management (Harrison,\nlong careers in the NHS have witnessed periods of empower-\nment and legitimation followed by a \"delayering\" of middle\nmanagement and a clawing back of power (Currie & Brown,\nnormative understandings have changed (Greener, 2008;\nHarrison & Dowswell, 2002). However, it would seem that,\nthrough these changes, both clinicians and managers have\nheld fast to a cognitive\u00adcultural sense of identity anchored in\na notion of public service and patient welfare.\nCurrently, the English NHS is adjusting to a major reorga-\nnization. As we show in the next section, workers in all parts\nof the service are taking on new roles and responsibilities as\nnew structures are put in place and new organizations cre-\nated. In terms of Scott's three institutional pillars, it is clear\nthat the regulative pillar of the NHS institution has under-\ngone profound change. We argue that these changes call into\nquestion the normative and cultural scripts held by GPs who\nmust now understand themselves as commissioners (that is\ncontracting with other organizations to provide services) as\nwell as providers of services. Being a commissioner is a\nchallenge to the normative sense of the GP role understood\nas focused on patient care. To a lesser extent, managers' nor-\nmative scripts of public service are also being queried, for\nexample, as some are moves to support units destined to sep-\narate from the NHS. As McDonough (2006) points out, these\nlevels of change force into consciousness questions about\nidentity, obliging individuals to think about their changing\nroles and what these mean, and potentially challenging the\ndeeply rooted cognitive\u00adcultural assumptions about the way\nin which \"things are done\" in the NHS. The rest of this article\nbriefly outlines some of these recent changes and then reports\non a research study that focused on one aspect of the changes:\nthe introduction of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).\nFindings from the qualitative part of this study are presented\nto show the implications of some of these changes for the\nroles and identities of GPs and managers.\nReorganization--The New Clinical\nCommissioning Groups\nIn July 2010, plans for a significant reorganization of the\nNHS were outlined in the White Paper--\"Equity and\nExcellence: Liberating the NHS\" (Department of Health,\n2010). Among other changes, responsibility for commission-\ning care for defined geographical populations was to be\npassed to groups of GPs working together in CCGs. Thus, in\naddition to their status as independent contractors to the\nNHS, some individual GPs are now used by the CCG to\ncarry out management duties. The White Paper envisaged\nthat this would make GPs more accountable to the patients\nthey serve, and that it would provide them with an incentive\nto act in ways that cut costs. At the same time, the previous\n(managerially dominated) purchasing organizations, Primary\nCare Trusts (PCTs), would be abolished and a new body,\nNHS England (initially called the NHS Commissioning\nBoard), established, with responsibility for overseeing the\nwork of CCGs, allocating budgets, and undertaking some\naspects of commissioning themselves (e.g., specialist ser-\nvices). It was argued that GPs' proximity to the frontline of\npatient care put them in the best position to understand the\nneeds of their patients, making them responsive\ncommissioners:\nIn order to shift decision-making as close as possible to\nindividual patients, the Department will devolve power and\nresponsibility for commissioning services to local consortia of\nGP practices. This change will build on the pivotal and trusted\nrole that primary care professionals already play in coordinating\nWhile GPs take on increasing commissioning roles and\nresponsibilities, the White Paper declared that management\ncosts were simultaneously to be cut by 45% and that \u00a320 bil-\nlion of efficiency savings would be realized by 2014. As\nAsthana (2011) points out, in this narrative, managers are\nunambiguously equated with unnecessary bureaucracy and\ncost. GPs, however, add value to the commissioning process\nby bringing their \"skills, knowledge and standing in local\ncommunities\" (NHS Commissioning Board, 2012b).\nEach practice compulsorily became a member of a CCG,\nwith mechanisms in place to elect peers onto the governing\nbody. These representatives are overwhelmingly GPs,\nalthough some have also elected practice nurses or practice\nmanagers. In addition, each CCG is required to have a nurse\nmember, a consultant, and two lay members. The configura-\ntion and organization of CCGs differ from site to site, with\nno overall template set from the center. Most have some kind\nof formal members' body, consisting of representatives from\neach member practice, and many have also set up\nSegar et al. 5\ngeographically based locality groups to involve a wider\nrange of local GP members. The choices that they have made\nso far often derive from their own recent history (Miller et\nal., 2012) and the particularities of the local context\nDuring the transition period, managerial support for\nCCGs came from PCT staff, some of whom transferred to the\nnew structures as PCTs disbanded. However, CCG manage-\nrial budgets have been set at a much lower level than was the\ncase for PCTs, and the new bodies are expected to \"buy in\"\nsignificant parts of their managerial support from newly\nformed organizations called Commissioning Support Units\n(CSUs). These have been set up by former PCT staff and\noften cover a large geographical area. While, initially, CSU\nstaff will be formally employed by NHS England, it is the\nstated intention that these organizations will become \"auton-\nomous organisations in 2016 and will be fully established,\nself-sustaining entities in a competitive market\" (NHS\nEngland, 2014). Overall, this represents a significant con-\ntraction in managerial numbers meaning redundancies and\njob losses, and will also mean that managerial staff who are\ntransferred from former PCTs to CSUs could be working for\nnon-NHS employers after 2016. At the time of writing, there\nare 211 CCGs in England (NHS Commissioning Board,\nMethod\nThis article derives from a project examining the early work-\nings of emerging CCGs (Checkland, Coleman, et al., 2012).\nThe aim of the project was to capture the experiences of\n\"Pathfinder\" CCGs (i.e., aspirant and emerging CCGs during\ntheir period of early formation) during a period of intense\nchange. The overall research questions for the project\nexplored their experiences during this process. In this article,\nwe focus on the experiences of GPs and managers as they\ncame to terms with their new responsibilities, answering the\nfollowing broad research question: \"How are GP and manag-\ners adapting to their new responsibilities, and what issues are\narising?\"\nEight case study sites in England were purposively sam-\npled, to include a range of population sizes, organizational\nstructures, socio-demographic variation, relationships with\nprovider organizations, and configuration in relation to local\nauthority boundaries. Groups had signed up to become\nPathfinder CCGs in five different temporal \"waves,\" and our\nsample included CCGs from Waves 1, 2, 3, and 5. Both urban\nand rural sites were included. This sampling strategy enabled\nthe capture of the full range of complexity in developing\nFieldwork was carried out in these sites from September\nwith the CCGs (e.g., lay members) and the observation of a\nrange of meetings including CCG governing body meetings,\noperational meetings, locality meetings, general members'\nmeetings, and meetings with a variety of external bodies\nsuch as Health and Wellbeing Boards (forums bringing\ntogether commissioners of health, public health, and social\ncare). Contemporaneous field notes were made and subse-\nquently written up. Documents associated with these meet-\nings and with the governance and organization of their\ngroups were collected and read. In total, 146 meetings were\nobserved (approx. 439 hr) and 96 interviews undertaken;\nthese were recorded (with consent) and transcribed. Ethics\napproval for this study was granted by the Greater Manchester\nWest Ethics Committee Research Ethics Committee 11/\nDuring the field research, we undertook to preserve the\nanonymity of our participants. This has been a strong and\nguiding principle throughout the research as we wanted to\nensure that all involved could speak freely. Care has been\ntaken that the anonymity of research participants has also\nbeen maintained in the presentation of this article.\nAll of these data were analyzed with the help of Atlas tiTM\nsoftware. Data collection and analysis for each case within\nthe study have been undertaken in parallel, allowing the\nresearch team to modify and develop topic guides as appro-\npriate, following up significant findings and seeking contra-\ndictory or confirmatory examples. Field notes taken during\nmeetings were coded alongside interview transcripts and rel-\nevant documents, and initially emerging coding definitions,\nanalytical themes, and theoretical ideas were discussed and\nrefined at regular face-to-face team meetings and Skype con-\nferences. Nineteen such meetings/conferences were held\nfield notes were read repeatedly for familiarization and\ncoded according to an initial framework based on our\nresearch questions, our reading of relevant literature, and our\nunderstanding of the policy context. Furthermore, \"second\nlevel\" coding was undertaken to capture any unexpected\nthemes, which emerged from the data, and the analysis con-\ntinually refined in written memos and team discussions.\nEmerging analytical ideas were tested among the research\nteam members and refined. Coded data were then further\nread and analyzed by a number of team members to ensure\nconsistency of approach. Initial thematic coding was refined,\nrevisited, and revised over the course of the fieldwork. Thus,\nthe data have been read and reread several times and unex-\npected second-order themes included in the analysis. For\nexample, \"doing things differently\" emerged as a recurring\ntheme, as those involved sought to establish their credentials\nas \"new\" organizations, untainted by the perceived failures\nof their predecessor commissioning organizations.\nTwo web-based surveys and a telephone survey were car-\nried out as part of the broader project; however, this article is\nbased solely on the qualitative data collected, focusing on\nevidence about possible changes in what participants take for\ngranted about their roles and identities in the NHS institu-\ntion. For full details of the broader project, see Checkland,\n6 SAGE Open\nColeman, et al. (2012). Analysis of the data resulted in four\nbroad themes relating to the roles of GPs and managers:\nshifting roles and identities, time pressures and other diffi-\nculties experienced, what it means to be a \"good commis-\nsioner\" in the new system, and the uncertainties facing\nmanagers.\nGPs With a Foot in Two Worlds: Shifting Roles\nand New Identities\nClinicians who take on managerial roles are described as\nbeing \"bridges,\" \"two way windows,\" \"Janus-faced\"\n(Witman, Smid, Meurs, & Willems, 2011) or \"wearing two\nhats\" (Checkland, Snow, McDermott, Harrison, & Coleman,\n2011). As mentioned above, they often feel that their clinical\nidentity is threatened or compromised by managerial involve-\nment but that clinical identity is paramount. GPs taking on\npositions in the new CCGs often had some previous experi-\nence of commissioning work such as GP Fundholding1 in the\nMiller et al.'s review highlights that many of the GPs who\nbecame involved in Fundholding were entrepreneurial by\nnature and were innovative leaders. The enthusiasm of these\nindividuals was not necessarily shared with rank and file\nGPs. Membership of CCGs, unlike predecessor primary care\ncommissioning arrangements, is mandatory for all GP prac-\ntices. GPs with formal roles will, in future, be involved in\ndecision making about commissioning/decommissioning of\nservices and will have statutory responsibility for these deci-\nsions in terms of finances and care. Their commissioning\nresponsibilities will be wider than under previous schemes as\nwill be their power to spend budgets. They will also negoti-\nate with secondary service providers, Local Authorities, and\nother external bodies such as Health and Wellbeing Boards.\nIt will also fall to these GPs to communicate the work of the\nCCG to its members and to oversee the clinical behavior of\nmembers through performance management of practices\nrelating to CCG budgets. It should also be remembered that\nGPs who sit on CCGs will also remain working GPs with\ncaseloads of patients in their own practices.\nAmong the GPs that we interviewed, some articulated\ntensions between their identities as clinicians and as manag-\ners. As the literature cited above demonstrates, this is not\nnecessarily new. As in previous GP commissioning arrange-\nments, the enthusiasts have taken on roles in the new CCG\ngoverning bodies. The key difference now is that all GPs,\nirrespective of inclination or enthusiasm, are through their\npractices, members of CCGs. Many enthusiasts commented\nthat they enjoyed their new roles on CCG governing bodies\nbut that this work differentiated them from fellow GPs:\n. . .you have to understand that the vast majority of GPs are not\nin the least bit interested in all this, they just want to do their day\njob, get on, look after their patients; they don't want to spend\ntheir time reading documents and papers and commissioning\nand all the rest of it. (GP and CCG chair ID 33)\nElections onto governing body positions showed the con-\ntinuing tension between the clinician and manager role, with\nmany of the leadership positions being taken on by previous\noffice bearers and evidence of reluctance among the general\nmembership to take on these roles. Some sites struggled to\nrecruit new leaders and one site had a GP vacancy on their\ngoverning board throughout our fieldwork period. On being\nasked about election as locality chair and member of the\nCCG governing body, this GP responded,\nI've been very clinical in my career and I've got lots of clinical\nspecial interests. And I've got lots of ideas and energy and\nenthusiasm to develop those, and this is putting some barriers in\nthe way of that, in terms of time and also conflict of interest. So\nit's opened some doors and closed others. And I still don't know\nhow I feel about that. (GP, locality lead and CCG board member\nSome CCGs were unable to hold elections for office bear-\ners because of lack of nominations for positions and several\nGPs explained that they had obtained their positions by\n\"default.\"\nIn common with some clinician managers in hospitals, GP\ninterviewees voiced misgivings about taking on managerial\nroles (Thorne, 2002). They were concerned, on a practical\nlevel, about not having the skills for these roles and not prop-\nerly understanding the governance structures of CCGs. On a\ndeeper level, they did not view themselves as really being\n\"proper\" managers:\nI think they're expecting a lot from people that don't have those\nskills and experience to do it and in all honesty I didn't go into .\n. . medicine to be a manager and a commissioner. I mean I quite\nenjoy it I think it's quite interesting in a way . . . but you only\nknow what you've picked up, it's not something you're trained\nto do. (GP, CCG locality board member ID 229)\nAnxiety about their role as both commissioners and\ndecommissioners of services is evident in the meeting extract\nbelow. Being on the \"frontline\" of patient care means that\nGPs will be responsible for commissioning decisions, includ-\ning decisions that may be unpopular with patients.

Problem was that once a patient was\nreferred there was no end date so many people were long term\nattenders. An additional issue was the location of the gym--\nmany people could not access the facility geographically so it\nwas not an equitable service and was currently not cost effective\n. . . We spend eight times as much on this service as other\nlocalities and have an insufficient service.\nProposal is to have a 16 week time limit on the service. For GPs\nto design a new pathway. We can't decommission the\nSegar et al. 7\nservice--this is unrealistic but we need to put a hold on new\nreferrals for 3 months . . . Patients will be unhappy as they like\nthe service. (CCG Locality executive meeting notes M35,\nemphasis added)\nThis extract seems to suggest that those present share\nsome cognitive\u00adcultural assumptions--it is said to be \"unre-\nalistic\" to decommission a service, and this statement is not\nchallenged.\nTime Pressures\nThose GPs who have accepted new roles in the CCG now\nface significant pressures on their time. They are usually\nfreed from their clinical duties for two to four sessions a\nweek and their practices are paid for locum cover. However,\nthese are not necessarily straightforward substitutions of\ntime and effort. As respondents pointed out, CCG work\nentails attending and participating in formal meetings, work-\nshops, and training sessions both internal to the CCG and\nexternal (e.g., Health and Wellbeing Boards). Associated\nwith these meetings is a significant volume of documents\nand emails. These commitments have implications for time\nspent with patients, in the practice and personal time. As\nillustrated below, there is no direct equivalence of the time\nspent on CCG work with the time missed from GP practice\nwork. Time spent with patients, with practice colleagues, and\non home life has significance over and above the minutes\nand hours involved. This resonates with Jones and Green's\n(2006) findings on the significance of work/life balance and\nflexible ways of working for the professional identities of\ncontemporary GPs.\nI think the roles . . . I mean if I look back to where we were . . .\nyou know, in practice-based commissioning from where we are\nnow and the role is just unrecognisable the amount of work that\ncomes through, is huge. And to be honest, it is limitless. So I\nvery much see it as I have to prioritise and I have to do what I\ncan, accept that I cannot go to every meeting, and I cannot be\navailable for everything, and there are some things that at the\nmoment are going to get more attention and for the others maybe\nless of a priority for the CCG. (GP and CCG clinical lead ID 36)\nThe ideal of GPs who are close to their patients and thus\nresponsive commissioners--as set out in the government's\n2010 White Paper--may potentially place a heavy burden on\nthe shoulders of a few GPs. This GP sets out her strong con-\nviction that being a \"good commissioner\" also requires her to\ncontinue to shoulder a reasonable load of clinical work. She\nreflects negatively on \"certain colleagues\" whom she feels\nhave already relinquished their \"GP identity.\"\nI always believed that to be a good clinical commissioner I need\nto be a good clinician, so I have to study being a GP . . . and I\nhave to deliver a sensible number of sessions so that people still\nknow that I'm a GP and I'm delivering what GPs do. Certain of\nmy colleagues I've already seen doing less and less and less . . .\nand their ability to continue in meetings already is . . . you know,\nyou could say: \"well, what do you think about this? [clinical\nservice]\" And they're like: \"I've never used that.\" (GP and CCG\nIn her view, the commissioning role requires the mainte-\nnance of a strong GP clinical identity, but the evidence pre-\nsented above suggests that this is both practically difficult to\nachieve as well as carrying with it inherent tensions and\nconflicts.\nIn addition, our respondents were aware that their involve-\nment at CCG level had an impact on their practice\ncolleagues:\nI think my biggest fear about all of the commissioning and the\nchanges that are going on with the reforms, is about the fact\nthat I'm not sure there is capacity . . . you're taking out, you\nknow, experienced GPs out of practice and . . . as a consequence\neither there's backfill with less experienced people, with\nlocums, with less continuity of care . . .. (GP and CCG board\nMany also pointed out that a great deal of CCG work had\nto be done in personal time, in the evenings or at weekends.\nIt is unlikely that this will be sustainable over any length of\ntime, raising issues for the future of GP-led commissioning,\nespecially if those involved are to continue to carry out sig-\nnificant clinical duties. If they relinquish those duties, our\nrespondent quoted above would suggest that they will lose\ncredibility as commissioners.\nBeing a Good Commissioner and Being\nAccountable\nThe idea that GPs are on the \"frontline\" of care and are there-\nfore responsive to patient need and requirements is one that\nresonated with our GP interviewees. They agreed that their\nproximity to patients placed them in a good position to com-\nmission services intelligently. There was, however, a grow-\ning awareness among some that they will shortly be directly\naccountable to patients for commissioning decisions (Lind,\n2012). With the handover of budgetary responsibility in the\ncontext of the target of \u00a320 billion of saving in health care, it\nis likely that GP commissioners may have to make unpopular\ndecisions about spending and decommissioning services.\nThe responsibility for such decisions will no longer be attrib-\nutable to PCTs, but to CCGs of which all GPs, via practices,\nare now members.\nGPs are probably the right people to do this, because the beauty\nof the fact that we have to sit across the table from the individual\npatient. And yes, we're not the most patient responsive bunch of\npeople, but we still have to meet Mrs Jones, and she still gets to\nrant at us about the fact that her hip operation isn't being done.\nAnd it will be our ears that get bent if we get it wrong. Whereas\nthat's not the case if you ask anybody else to commission. (GP\nand CCG locality board member ID 221)\n8 SAGE Open\nWhat does worry me is the very difficult financial situation\nwe're in. Huge quick savings that we have been tasked with, and\nthe potential difficult rationing decisions we're going to have to\nmake and how that's going to sit with the public in the future and\nthe newspapers and that sort of thing. (GP and CCG board\nBy contrast, both GPs and managers voiced more opti-\nmism and excitement about increasing opportunities to take\npart in contract negotiations with secondary care providers.\nBest thing I've done, I suppose, in terms of the service redesigns\nI've . . . discussing clinician to clinician with secondary care\ncolleagues, you . . . agree what makes obvious sense from a\npatient pathway point of view, and then . . . the managers find a\nway of making that work. (GP and CCG board member ID 67)\nAs McDonald (2009) points out, GPs enjoy high status\nrelative to the broader community, but this is not the case\nwithin the narrow context of medicine. It may be that enter-\ning into contract negotiations in this way might mark an\nincrease in status for GPs.\nManagers Facing Uncertainty and Insecurity\nMany of our respondents, both clinicians and managers, jok-\ningly enumerated how many NHS reorganizations they had\nexperienced. Managers in particular have borne the brunt of\nmany of these (Light & Connor, 2011; Macfarlane et al.,\n2011). They have also been portrayed by politicians and the\nmedia as a bloated sector whose numbers need to be cut\n(Merali, 2005). NHS managers have been characterized as\nbeing resilient and resourceful in the face of these changes\ninformants were optimistic and enthusiastic about the current\nreforms, highlighting the value that GPs' clinical expertise\nadds to the commissioning process. However, they were con-\ncerned about GPs taking on managerial roles and the con-\ncomitant shift in their own roles. Some articulated this as both\nGPs and managers having to undergo a \"culture change\":\nIt's really the cultural challenge I think, for GPs to understand\nwhat it's like to be commissioners. The statutory responsibilities\nyou have, you know, there are things that you must do, should\ndo, and them understanding, I think, some of the legal\nframeworks and constraints. And then for managers I think the\nchallenge has been around the shift of culture, becoming more\nclinically orientated . . . and for some managers that's quite a\nchallenge because they have little clinical awareness. (Manager\nAt a more pragmatic level, there was concern about GP\ncapacity to take on commissioning and managerial\nfunctions:\n. . . they don't always understand the pathways, which is\nsurprising--you realise how little some of them know about\nhospital-based care. As a manager, sometimes you think hmm,\nmaybe, physiologically I may not understand it, but I understand\nthe system and pathways and I understand what the cardiologist\ndoes. (Manager ID 9)\nThere was also a feeling among managers that GPs are\nfirst and foremost clinicians and that clinical work is some-\nthing they can always \"fall back on.\" For managers, though,\nthere is no fall-back position.\nRunning parallel with these concerns are worries about\nchanging employment structures and associated job losses.\nAs PCTs neared the end of their existence, managers were\nbeing assigned to work in CCGs, in Public Health in the\nLocal Authority or in the newly formed CSUs. In addition,\nsome faced redundancy and job loss and many were under-\ngoing processes of having to apply formally for their posts in\nthe changed structures. For those joining one of the CSUs in\nEngland, there is the prospect that these organizations will\npotentially no longer be part of the NHS after 2016. This\nmanager explained how some PCT colleagues had been\nassigned to the CCG while others had been assigned to a\nSo they're quite happy [those assigned to the CCG], I think,\nreally. The rest of the people in the PCT probably aren't quite as\nhappy because it's this, are you going to be a commissioning\nsupport organisation, and I think the connotations around that\nare that eventually . . . the NHS Commissioning Board [now\nNHS England] say that they'll host it till 2016 and then\npotentially they'll be privatised, or could be, and I think for\nindividuals that presents a challenge to them in terms of their\nemployment status, job security, etcetera . . . Because people\nwant to remain in the NHS. (Manager ID 287)\nAssignment to a CSU means that managers may lose their\nconnections with their immediate local community. This has\nimplications for both managers and CCGs, with the latter\nvoicing concern about losing local knowledge.\nOn a personal level, job losses and job insecurity place a\nheavy burden on individual managers, including those who\nhave to manage these changes.\nIn spite of upheaval and uncertainty, many managers--\nparticularly those in senior positions--still voiced enthusi-\nasm about the possibilities of future partnership working\nwith GPs. Evident too were high levels of commitment to the\nethos of public service and to patient care.\nI think, some of the clinical engagement that's come out of it:\nmassive buzz for me, because, if you get people with fire in their\nbelly and they get going, oh, it's fantastic . . . at the end of the\nday, and, you know, I drive people mad about this, but, we come\nto work, because, there's patients that need help. They need\nhealthcare and it's incumbent on us to make, you know, best use\nof the tax payer's pound. (Manager ID 117)\nThis suggests that the new opportunities offered to some\nmanagers in the new system had in fact strengthened their\nSegar et al. 9\nsense of themselves as public servants, working more closely\nwith clinicians to provide high quality health care.\nDiscussion\nThis research was undertaken during a period of intense and\nmajor change. These changes and their implications are still\nunfolding and it is too soon to talk definitively about their\nresults and outcomes. Notwithstanding, it may be possible to\ndiscern the \"direction of travel\" brought about by the current\nreforms. Periods of fundamental change can force into con-\nsciousness notions of identity and relationship to work and\npeers that are normally taken for granted: the cognitive\u00adcul-\ntural mental scripts referred to by Scott (2008). This research\nhas captured some of the issues surrounding role and identity\nchange currently being faced by NHS GPs and managers.\nOur findings resonate with previous literature in showing\nthat both GPs and managers (perhaps with different empha-\nses) view patient care as their raison d'\u00eatre and have a strong\npublic service ethos. These are the ties that bind them to the\ninstitution of the NHS. As Scott points out, we cannot pre-\nsume that institutions simply persist and that the beliefs and\npractices associated with them just endure. He argues that\nchanges in the three constitutive pillars of institutions inter-\nact with one another and that there may be times when the\npillars are \"misaligned\" and may \"support and motivate dif-\nfering choices and behaviors\" (Scott, 2008, p. 62). It is at\nsuch moments that institutional change occurs. What our\ndata suggest at this point of the reforms is that radical change\ntaking place in one of the organizational pillars may not nec-\nessarily be followed by changes in the other two pillars, thus\nleading to institutional dysfunctionality.\nIn Scott's terms, the current reforms constitute an obvious\ninstance of regulative change. Two hundred-eleven CCGs in\nEngland now have full responsibility for spending \u00a360 bil-\nlion of public money. It could be argued that these changes\nhave much in common with previous attempts to reform the\nNHS. We would contend that the current reforms go much\nfurther than their antecedents. In contrast to the predecessor\ncommissioning organizational forms of GP Fundholding and\nPBC, CCGs have wider commissioning responsibilities; and\nunlike the earlier schemes of Total Purchasing and PBC,\nCCGs control and spend real money (Miller et al., 2012). A\nfurther marked contrast with earlier GP commissioning\nexperiments is that CCGs are membership organizations\nwhere membership is not voluntary but compulsory. GPs are\nformally in control of CCGs with no buffer organization\nreplacing PCTs or their various predecessors.\nThe responsibility for commissioning spending, including\ntaking unpopular or difficult decisions in the context of\nsqueezed resources, will also now fall to CCG leaders. In\nScott's terms, this means an inconsistency or instability in\nthe normative organizational pillar. The norms and values\nthat GPs uphold in their roles as \"frontline\" clinicians are\ndifferent from their roles as CCG leaders, managers, and\nbudget holders.At its simplest level, GPs in their clinical role\nview the needs of the individual patient in front of them as\nparamount. Our data suggest that GPs in managerial posi-\ntions in CCGs must marry this with a population-level con-\ncern with budgets, priorities, and possible service cuts. GPs\nin our study showed themselves to be acutely aware of this\ntension. At best, some argued that their very closeness to\npatients would ensure that they made good decisions as com-\nmissioners; others expressed a concern that the need to\nengage with burgeoning budgetary pressures would under-\nmine their relationship with their patients and, by extension,\ntheir sense of identity as clinicians. These role and identity\ntensions faced by GPs taking on managerial roles are not\ncompletely new, but we argue that they are greater than under\nprevious GP commissioning models. These roles have the\npotential to change their relationships with peers as they will\nnow take responsibility for their performance management\nin light of devolved budgets and the need to attain savings\ntargets. The use of the term frontline to describe the position\nof GPs is significant. It has been used as shorthand to refer to\nGPs' proximity to their patients and to the concerns of their\npatients. It is clear that GPs identify with the notion that they\nare patient facing; it is less clear that they fully embrace the\nnorms associated with their new roles as managers and com-\nmissioners. They certainly do not take it for granted that all\nGPs by virtue of CCG membership have a stake and respon-\nsibility for commissioning.\nThe issue of the time and resource commitments required\nfor GPs to take on roles in CCGs is not a trivial one. At the\nindividual level, it also calls to question normative under-\nstandings about the role of GPs. It also reaches into general\npractices drawing on the expensive time of experienced GPs.\nSo while \"rank and file\" GPs may not understand CCG\nmembership as changing the nature of their clinical role, the\nabsence of practice members is felt. The need to cover these\nabsences might be seen as disrupting the cognitive\u00adcultural\nassumption underpinning general practices as small busi-\nnesses. In relation to secondary care, GPs will have increased\nopportunities to play a major role in contract negotiations\nalso potentially shifting elements of the cognitive\u00adcultural\nunderstandings of what it means to be a GP.\nThe data presented above already point to a distinct\nuneasiness concerning the roles of GPs as CCG board mem-\nbers who are responsible both for commissioning and decom-\nmissioning of services. It also points to a reluctance of many\nGPs to take on formal commissioning roles. It remains to be\nseen whether these shifting roles will become normalized,\nthat is, constitute change in Scott's cognitive\u00adcultural pillar;\nwill GPs and those they serve come to understand that they\nare commissioners and that this is part of their professional\nidentity? Either way, we would argue that such far reaching\nchange obliges those involved not only to consider their\nchanging roles but also what these changing roles mean in\nterms of identity. Such shifts in the cognitive\u00adcultural pillar\nof institutions take time to discern, and the data we have pre-\nsented do not yet present a clear story of cognitive\u00adcultural\nchange. Indeed, while some GP respondents highlight their\ndesire to cling on to a strong clinical identity, and argue that\nthis is essential if they are to fulfill their new role, others\nvoice their discomfort at the tensions they experience, with\nsome managers suggesting that GPs will \"need to change.\"\nOverall, this suggests that the significant regulative changes\nthat we have seen are in the process of destabilizing long-\nheld cognitive\u00adcultural assumptions about \"who we are\" and\n\"what we do.\" It is not possible at present to suggest what the\neventual outcome will be, but it seems likely that there will\nbe at least some shift in the nature of the institution that is the\nEnglish NHS.\nThe managers supporting CCGs are also in the midst of\nanother round of ebb and flow of their power and authority.\nMany of the managers that we observed and interviewed\nwere in the process of moving into different organizations set\non different pathways. Some were being made redundant and\nothers had chosen to leave ahead of the changes meaning the\nloss of talented and experienced people to the NHS. Many of\nour respondents pointed out that managerial teams are being\nfragmented with concomitant loss of organizational memory\nand of connection to local communities. For others, their\nleadership roles have changed as GPs are set to lead the new\nCCGs. There has clearly been a regulative shift seeking to\nsubordinate managers to doctors; whether this change will\nspread to the other pillars, thus recreating \"diplomatic man-\nagement\" as described by Harrison (1988), will be interest-\ning to watch. A key question to follow will be whether these\nchanges affect managers' identity as public servants who are\npart of the NHS family.\nThe question that our data raise is whether the current\nchanges may go further than creating shifting roles for some\nGP and managers. Might these changes erode what Scott\nrefers to as the cognitive\u00adcultural pillar so that some GPs and\nmanagers begin to relate to the NHS in different ways? Many\nof the issues that our interviewees raised were reflections on\nchanging identity, alongside their changing roles. The previ-\nously stated rationale for bringing GPs into commissioning\nwas their proximity to frontline patient care, their standing in\nthe community, and their understanding of local health care\nneeds. Our findings suggest that engagement in managerial\nwork may potentially take GPs away from patient care, may\nalienate them from their peers, and may, in time, make them\nunpopular with patients. GPs who have undertaken roles in\ntheir CCGs could opt to retreat to their \"day jobs\" leaving\ncommissioning in the hands of the few. Early evidence\nappears to support this contention, indicating that GP repre-\nsentation on CCG governing bodies is falling away (Kaffash\n& Mooney, 2014). It seems likely that those who stay on will\nsee themselves and be seen by others as being different from\n\"ordinary rank and file GPs.\" These GPs will be taking on\nnew identities as \"GP commissioners,\" and it is not yet clear\nwhether they will be able to maintain the same relationships\nwith their patients and with their colleagues.\nThe changes that we observed as CCGs are becoming\nestablished are still unfolding, and the questions posed here\nwill require further time to be answered definitively. In par-\nticular, can a good commissioner be a good GP? How will\nbudgetary accountability affect relationships between GP\nleaders, their patients, and their colleagues? Will managers\nbe able to retain their public service ethos if they no longer\nwork in their local community or no longer work directly for\nthe NHS? Will, as this initial research suggests, these changes\nserve to change the ties that bind them to the NHS?\nAuthors' Note\nEmployees of the Department of Health were members of an advi-\nsory group, which supported the conduct of the research and com-\nmented on an initial draft of the study final report, but the findings\nare those of the authors.
