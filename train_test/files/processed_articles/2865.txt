At the same time, institutions increasingly moved part\nof their business from interest to fee-earning activities. This study analyzes the\ndeterminants of non-interest income and its impact on financial performance and\nthe risk profile of German banks between 1995 and 2007. We find empirical evidence\nthat for all German universal banks risk-adjusted returns on equity and total assets\nare positively affected by higher fee income activities. Additionally, for commercial\nbanks we show that a strong engagement in fee-generating activities goes along\nwith higher risk. In order to analyze possible cross-subsidization effects between\ninterest and fee business we also examine how banks' expansion in fee-based services\nhas affected their interest margin. For savings and commercial banks we find that\ninstitutions with a strong focus on fee business charge lower interest margins when\ncredit risk is controlled.\n",

However, these studies neglected\nthe aspect of income diversification. Bearing in mind the shrinking interest margins\nwith which German banks are faced, the question becomes highly relevant of whether\nbanks can take advantage of the diversification of their income sources, i.e. the\ncombination of interest and fee-earning activities. Theoretically, banks would benefit\nfrom diversification when all income components are either negatively or only slightly\ncorrelated. On the other hand, however, latest experience from the current financial\ncrisis has shown that boosting non-interest income activities could also destabilize\nindividual banks as well as the banking system as a whole.\nOur study focuses on banks' primary income sources: interest and fee-earning ac-\ntivities. In the academic literature, the feedback effect between a bank's profitability\nand its strategic decision to expand its fee business plays only a minor role. Hence,\nwe would expect an increase in non-interest business to have two effects: First, a\nchange in a bank's profitability and, second, that rather weak banks would try to\ndevelop alternative business opportunities.\nThis study is divided into two parts: First, we examine whether banks with a\nheavy involvement in the fee business can increase their returns, and whether this in-\nvolvement goes hand in hand with higher risk taking. Owing to data considerations,\nwe measure activity in this business unit by fee income as a ratio of interest income\nand fee income. Our database is a micro panel of supervisory balance sheet data\n(BAKIS) and information on banks' lending to industry sectors (borrowers' statis-\ntics) for the years 1995 to 2007. The second part of the paper focuses on banks'\ninterest margins. Here, we control for credit risk using loan loss provisions to show\nthat savings and commercial banks with a high share of fee income charge lower\ninterest margins. We interpret this finding as an indication of subsidization between\ninterest and fee business.\nIn sum, our analysis shows that banks with a large share of fee income exhibit\na more favorable risk-return profile, i.e. they demonstrate a higher risk-adjusted re-\nturn on equity (ROE) and total assets (ROA). Additionally, for commercial banks\nwe find that strong activity in the fee business is accompanied by higher ROE/ROA\nvolatility and, therefore, by greater risk. Finally, in the case of savings and commer-\ncial banks, we observe that institutions with a strong focus on fee business charge\nlower risk-adjusted interest margins.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nIn Diversifikationsstudien zum deutschen Bankenmarkt wurde die Zusammen-\nsetzung der Kreditportfolien von Banken untersucht. Aspekte der Einkommens-\ndiversifizierung wurden bislang jedoch ausgeblendet. Dennoch erscheint gerade in\nZeiten sinkender Zinsmargen die Frage relevant, ob Banken Vorteile durch die Di-\nversifizierung ihrer Einkommensquellen, d.h. vor allem durch die Kombination von\nZins- und Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft, erlangen k\u00f6nnen. Aus theoretischer Sicht sind Diver-\nsifikationsvorteile dann zu erwarten, wenn s\u00e4mtliche Einkommensstr\u00f6me entweder\nnegativ oder nur gering miteinander korrelieren. Dem Diversifikationsargument ste-\nhen allerdings die j\u00fcngsten Erfahrungen aus der Finanzkrise entgegen, die gezeigt\nhaben, dass der Versuch, die Einkommensstr\u00f6me durch vermehrte Einnahmen aus\ndem Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft zu diversifizieren, auch destabilisierend auf Einzelbanken\nsowie das gesamte Bankensystem wirken kann.\nUnsere Studie ist auf die beiden zentralen Einkommensquellen von Banken fo-\nkussiert: Das Zins- und das Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft. In der akademischen Literatur findet\nhierbei der Feedbackeffekt zwischen der Ertragskraft einer Bank und deren stra-\ntegischen Entscheidung zur Ausweitung des Provisionsgesch\u00e4fts wenig Beachtung.\nHierbei ist zu erwarten, dass die Erh\u00f6hung des zinsunabh\u00e4ngigen Gesch\u00e4fts einer-\nseits die Ertragskraft einer Bank ver\u00e4ndert und dass andererseits gerade ertrags-\nschw\u00e4chere Banken nach alternativen Gesch\u00e4ftsm\u00f6glichkeiten suchen werden.\nIn der vorliegenden Arbeit wird in einem ersten Schritt untersucht, ob Banken\nmit verst\u00e4rktem Engagement im Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft ihre Gewinne erh\u00f6hen k\u00f6nnen\nund ob dieses Engagement mit zus\u00e4tzlichen Risiken verbunden ist. Wie stark ein In-\nstitut im Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft engagiert ist, wird dabei als Anteil der Provisionsertr\u00e4ge\nan der Summe von Zins- und Provisionsertr\u00e4gen gemessen. Als Datenbasis dient ein\nMikro-Panel mit bankenaufsichtlichen Bilanzdaten (BAKIS) sowie Informationen\nzur Kreditvergabe der Banken in die einzelnen Wirtschaftssektoren (Kreditnehmer-\nstatistik) f\u00fcr die Jahre 1995 bis 2007. In einem zweiten Schritt wird untersucht,\ninwieweit sich die wachsende Bedeutung des Provisionsgesch\u00e4fts auf die Zinsmargen\nder Banken auswirkt. Dabei k\u00f6nnen wir nachweisen, dass Banken mit einem hohen\nAnteil Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft eine geringere Zinsmarge einfordern, wobei wir das Kre-\nditrisiko mittels der Abschreibungsquote kontrollieren. Dieses Ergebnis deuten wir\nals Hinweis f\u00fcr eine Quersubventionierung von Zins- und Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft.\nUnsere Analyse zeigt, dass Banken, die einen h\u00f6heren Anteil ihrer Ertr\u00e4ge im\nProvisionsgesch\u00e4ft erwirtschaften, eine g\u00fcnstigere Risiko-Ertragssituation (gemessen\nam ROE und ROA) aufweisen, d.h. deren risikoadjustierte Eigenkapitalrendite gr\u00f6\u00dfer\nist. Gleichzeitig l\u00e4sst sich f\u00fcr die Privatbanken feststellen, dass ein st\u00e4rkeres En-\ngagement im Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft auch mit einer h\u00f6heren Volatilit\u00e4t der Eigen- und\nGesamtkapitalrenditen und damit mit einem h\u00f6heren Risiko verbunden ist. F\u00fcr die\nGruppe der Sparkassen und Privatbanken kann zudem gezeigt werden, dass Insti-\ntute mit einem starken Fokus auf das Provisionsgesch\u00e4ft geringere risikoadjustierte\nZinsmargen einfordern.\nContents\n2 Review of literature 2\n3 Factors influencing banks' changing income and profit structure 5\n4 Variables, data and the empirical model 6\n4.1 Measures of different income sources, diversification and performance 6\n4.2 Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n4.3 The empirical model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n4.3.1 Performance and non-interest income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n4.3.2 Risk and fee income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\n4.3.3 Fee income and interest margins . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n5.1 Return and risk-adjusted return in the fee business . . . . . . . . . . 10\n5.2 Risk in the fee business . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n5.3 Interest margin and non-interest income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n1 Introduction\nThe German banking sector comprises three pillars: privately-owned commercial\nbanks, savings banks and their central institutions (\"Landesbanken\") and credit co-\noperatives with two central institutions. All banking groups are different in terms\nof ownership, geographical concentration and business model.3\nIn the last few years the German banking industry has experienced decreasing\ninterest margins and profitability. At the same time the relevance of non-interest\nincome has increased. Across all banking groups, between 1975 and 2007 the average\nratio of fee surplus to interest and fee surplus increased from 12% to 26%. Graph\n1 shows that fee-income relative to interest income increased in all banking sectors,\nwhereby commercial banks traditionally create higher fee-income than cooperative\nand savings banks. In 2000 this ratio reached a peak due to the agile demand for\ninvestment share certificates and shares. In this paper we examine the relationship\nbetween earnings from the fee business and bank performance. Our study is based\non a micro panel of supervisory balance sheet data (BAKIS) and information about\nShare of net fee income in %\nCommercial banks 'Big five'\n* Commercial banks excluding the 'big five'.\nCommercial banks\nShare of net fee income in %\n* Savings banks incl.

In the context of the banking industry, institutions reach disintermediation\nby expanding fee-earning activities. This strategy leads to greater diversification of\nincome sources, which might help banks to reduce risks and stabilize profits, pro-\nvided the different income components are imperfectly correlated. On the contrary,\nsome fee income activities are associated with much higher risks than other income\nsources and, therefore, they could contribute to a destabilization of both individual\nbanks and the whole banking system. For example, the importance of loan secu-\nritization and credit derivatives has drastically increased over the last few years,\nwhich allowed in particular larger banks to replace interest income by fee income.\nThis development, however, goes along with higher risk taking mainly because of\nthe complexity of such instruments.\n2 Review of literature\nDiversification in banking can take on different dimensions. While there are a variety\nof studies that analyze diversification within loan portfolio, diversification of income\nsources, more specifically interest and non-interest income, has attracted increasing\nattention in academic research. Generally, it is believed that diversification of income\nsources should reduce total risk, as diversification should stabilize operating income\nif income streams are negatively or imperfectly correlated. While this argument is\nclear from a traditional point of view, DeYoung and Roland (2001) provide three rea-\nsons why non-interest income may increase volatility. First, revenues from fee-based\nactivities might be more volatile than interest income because the customer-bank\nrelationship is stronger in the traditional lending business, i.e. for many of the new\nfee-based activities it is easier for customers to switch to another bank. Second,\nexpanding into fee-based services can considerably increase fixed costs (e.g. by in-\nvestments in technology and human resources) whereas, if a lending relationship\nis already established, the only cost of an additional loan are the bank's interest\nexpenses. Third, in contrast to the lending business, fee-based activities require less\nregulatory capital, which suggests a higher degree of financial leverage and therefore\nleads to a higher earnings volatility. Indeed, DeYoung and Roland (2001) and Stiroh\n(2004a) find empirical evidence that reliance on non-interest activities increases the\nvolatility of large U.S. banks. In general, only a few papers identify empirical evi-\ndence that combined lending and non-interest activities cause diversification benefits\nand therefore lead to risk reduction. By contrast, there are some studies (mainly for\nthe US banking market) that have shown a positive and significant influence of\ndiversification through non-interest income on earnings volatility.5\nStiroh (2004a) analyzes the potential benefit of income diversification for U.S.\nbanks. Since the growth of net interest and net non-interest income in the period\n1984-2001 is increasingly correlated, he concludes that the diversification benefits\ndecreased during the period in question. Furthermore, he shows that at the bank\nlevel risk-adjusted returns are negatively associated with non-interest income shares.\nDe Young and Rice (2004) suggest that there are differences between the Euro-\npean and the U.S. banking sector. They argue that universal banking has been the\nhistoric norm in many European banking systems, possibly based on experience as\nEuropean banks are better informed as to how to exploit the diversification benefit\nof fee-based activities. Smith et al. (2003) likewise empirically confirm that Euro-\npean banks are able to seek diversification benefits through combining interest and\nnon-interest income activities. In the case of European banks, the authors find that\nnon-interest income is indeed more volatile than interest income but, in contrast\nto U.S. studies, there are negative correlations between these two income streams.\nHence, they conclude that non-interest activities potentially stabilize bank earnings,\na result that is also confirmed by Davis and Tuori (2000) for a number of European\nbanks, including some in Germany.\nGischer and J\u00fcttner (2003) find a weak negative relationship between ROA and\nthe fee income to interest income ratio for 19 OECD countries. The results for the\nAustralian banking sector are similar. Esho et al. (2005) show that for a sample\nof Australian Credit Unions the return on assets (ROA) is negatively associated\nwith the increment of transaction fees. Against expectations, risk rises in line with\na higher revenue share of this income source. Conversely, revenue shares of fees\nreceived for off-balance sheet facilities and fiduciary activities do not seem to have\nany influence on risk and return, possibly on account of the relatively small share\nof this income category. Lepetit et al. (2008) find that in the case of 602 European\nbanks during the period 1996-2002 there was a negative correlation between interest\nmargin and non-interest income. The authors assume that banks use loans as a loss\nleader to expand their non-interest income via cross-selling.\net al. (2008) differentiate between a \"direct exposure\" effect (a greater reliance on\nnon-interest activity) and an \"indirect diversification effect\" (change of concentration\nbetween the two income streams), whereby the latter is measured by the Herfindahl\nMercieca et al. (2007) show that for small European banks, small U.S. community\nbanks and U.S. financial holding companies higher concentration is accompanied by\na lower degree of income volatility, while shifting into non-interest income creates an\ninefficient trade-off between risk and return. Furthermore, all three studies conclude\nthat the banks' financial stability, measured through z-score, is negatively affected\nby reliance on non-interest income. In contrast to these papers, Chiorazzo et al.\n(2008) identify a positive relation between diversification and non-interest income\nSplit samples, grouped by size classes, reveal that large banks, in particular, benefit\nfrom non-interest income activities while within the group of small banks only in-\nstitutions with a low non-interest income share are able to benefit from expanding\ntheir non-interest business.\nIf, indeed, there are only two income streams the question remains, however, as\nto whether the \"direct exposure effect\" can be separated from the \"diversification\neffect\". In this context, Petersen (2004) complains that in the binary case, where\nthe bank chooses between lending and non-interest activities, the HHI is merely a\nnon-linear form of the non-interest income share. In particular, if the bank's non-\ninterest income share is less than 50%, which is true for most of the small banks,\nthe correlation between HHI and non-interest income share is extremely large and,\nhence, empirically separating these two effects might be impossible.\nUntil now academic literature has paid only little attention to the fact that non-\ninterest activity and banks' performance are interrelated. On the one hand, there\nis the suspicion that banks suffering from declining or highly volatile profitability\nare inclined to expand their engagement in non-interest activities in order to earn a\nhigher or more stable return. On the other hand, shifting banks' business towards\nnon-interest income also has an impact on profitability.\nIn econometric analysis it is necessary to pay attention to the possible endo-\ngeneity of non-interest income activities, as otherwise the endogeneity of indepen-\ndent variables leads to inconsistent estimators. Endogeneity in the modeling of non-\ninterest income is, for example, considered in De Young and Rice (2004), Laeven and\nLevine (2005) and Campa and Kedia (2002), whereas all studies use an instrumental\nvariable approach to derive consistent estimators.\nDe Young and Rice (2004) demonstrate the empirical links between banks' non-\ninterest income, business strategies, market conditions, technological change and fi-\nthat well managed banks, measured by a relative ROE measure, are less engaged\nin non-interest income while large banks and banks that focus more on relation-\nship banking are more reliant on non-interest income. They also find that marginal\nincreases in non-interest income engender higher, but more volatile profits, and a\ndecline in risk-adjusted profits. Craigwell and Maxwell (2006) also find a positive\nimpact of non-interest income on ROA and its volatility for Barbados banks between\n1985 and 2001. In contrast to other studies, however, they find no evidence that rela-\ntive performance helps to explain non-interest income. Surprisingly, in the Barbados\nstudy non-interest income - in relative terms - plays a larger role for smaller banks.\nWhile most previous work on bank diversification was dedicated to U.S. banks\nthere are only a few studies that analyze the relationship between the changing struc-\nture of bank income and risk in the European banking industry. To our knowledge,\nno study exists that explicitly analyzes the effect of non-interest income activities\non German banks. In order to contribute to this area of banking literature, we ana-\nlyze the effect of banks' fee generating activities on their risk-return profiles, with a\nspecial emphasis on banks' interest margins. Our database consists of a micro panel\nof supervisory balance sheet data and information on banks' lending to industry\nsectors between 1995 to 2007. We focus on the problem of endogeneity in two ways:\nfirst, we use a fixed effects panel with lagged variables to explain banks' return\nand risk-adjusted return and, second, we apply the two-stage least squares estima-\ntor to explain the volatility of bank returns. Our reasoning for this methodological\napproach is described in detail in section 4.\nIn section 3 we review the reasons for fee-income growth over the last few years\nwhile in section 4 we present a detailed data description and the empirical model.\nOur results are reported by banking group in section 5 and our final conclusions are\ncontained in section 6.\n3 Factors influencing banks' changing income and\nprofit structure\nGerman interest margins have constantly been declining since the mid eighties. This\ndevelopment has been accelerated by globalization but, on the other hand, global-\nization also leads to a rapid growth of international trade which in turn provides\nopportunities in the fee business6 (Gischer and J\u00fcttner, 2003). Hence, to compensate\nfor the adverse development in the interest business banks looked for other income\nsources (Koetter et al., 2004). For some banks it has opened up new markets, partic-\nularly in trading, asset management and investment banking activities (Davis and\nTuori, 2000). The introduction of new regulatory requirements (Basel I and Basel\nII) also impairs banks' non-interest income activities. Since regulatory requirements\nhave affected compliance and the cost of capital, banks have to look more closely\nat different assets on their books and price them accordingly. In this context it\nis often argued that the increase in off-balance sheet activities, which can be ob-\nserved in some European countries, largely results from lower capital requirements\nfor off-balance sheet items, and not from on-balance sheet activities.7\nMoreover, lower risk-weights for inter-bank loans lead to an increase in this bal-\nance sheet position. Since inter-bank loans have lower interest margins than loans to\nnon-financial clients, non-interest income declined (Davis and Tuori, 2000). In addi-\ntion, expanding consumer needs caused the creation of new types of bank activities.\nIn response to demographic changes, growing wealth on the part of individuals and\nthe expected loss in the pension system, a larger proportion of the population en-\ngages in portfolio investments. Furthermore, there has been a change in technology\n(e.g. automated teller machines and internet banking are now more common than\nyears ago) which also affects banks' cost structure (Hawtrey, 2003).\nFinally, the costs of collecting and processing information have decreased. This\nhas, for example, lead to more efficient \"production\" of financial information and\nbetter techniques for evaluating and pricing risk. Some banks have even specialized\nin the monitoring of credit exposures (as agents rather than principals), e.g. in the\ncontext of loan securitization which increases the share of non-interest income. Inno-\nvation in financial products has facilitated a rearrangement of the income structure\nand the balance sheet of banks. In general, the possibility of removing risk from cap-\nital has caused an increase in off-balance sheet activities, as some banks have been\nencouraged to take part in the process of securitization by undertaking investment\nbanking activities (Davis and Tuori, 2000).\n6E.g. letter of credit, international payment transfer, etc.\n7Note that in Germany the off-balance sheet activities to total assets ratio rather decreased over\nthe last few years.\n4 Variables, data and the empirical model\n4.1 Measures of different income sources, diversification and\nperformance\nIn our analysis we consider a bank's total interest earnings (interest income, II ),\nand total fee earnings (fee income, FI ), from which we create a variable SHFEE to\nmeasure the share of fee generating activities:\nSHFEE = (FI)/(FI + II)\nAs a profitability measure we consider return on equity (ROE) and total assets\n(ROA), which is the ratio of operating revenues to equity and total assets respec-\ntively. As risk measure we use the standard deviation () of ROE and ROA, which is\ncalculated over the entire period a bank is in the sample. Following Chiorazzo et al.\n(2008) we construct risk-adjusted returns (RAROE and RAROA) to risk-adjust\nprofitability:\n,t\n= ROEi\n,t\n,t\n= ROAi\n,t\nInterest margin (NIM) is calculated as interest surplus divided by total assets.\nFor our empirical analysis we use data from the Bundesbank's prudential database\nBAKIS (BAKred Information System), which incorporates information derived from\nbank balance sheets and the supervisory reports of individual German banks. The\nsecond data source for our analysis is the Bundesbank's borrowers' statistics, which\ncontain data about financial institutions' sectoral credit allocation. The third data-\nbase we use is the credit register for loans of 1.5 million euro or more. The credit\nregister gives us information to which regions banks gave loans of 1.5 million euro\nor more. We use this data to construct a competition measure (COMP). We also\nuse the Deutsche Bundesbank MFI interest rate statistics. Our sample covers Ger-\nman savings, cooperative and private banks but excludes Landesbanken, cooperative\ncentral institutions, and the \"Big Five\" private banks. We also exclude affiliates of\nGerman banks abroad, affiliates of foreign banks in Germany, mortgage banks and\nspecial-purpose banks. Due to the restrictive nature of the data frequency we use\nOver the observed period many bank mergers took place in Germany. When\ndealing with these mergers, we separate the merged bank from the two pre-merger\nbanks, i.e. we ultimately have three independent observations in our sample. In\norder to avoid counting observations twice, we drop target banks in the year of\nthe merger. Furthermore, a relatively moderate outlier treatment is applied to the\ndataset, in which we truncate selected variables, by banking group, at the 1st and\n99th percentile. For commercial banks we truncate at the 2nd and 98th percentile,\nsince commercial banks are more heterogeneous. We also consider only banks with at\nleast three time-series observations in our regressions as this ensures a more reliable\nmeasuring of banks' income variability. Finally, we apply both panel fixed-effects\nand cross-sectional two-stage least squares models. For the latter specification we\naverage variables over time.\n4.3 The empirical model\n4.3.1 Performance and non-interest income\nWe use the following empirical specification to analyze the relationship between fee\nincome and profitability:\nYi,t\n= k + t\n+ i\n\u00b7 SHFEEi,t-1\n\u00b7 HHIi,t-1\n\u00b7 NPLi,t-1\n\u00b7 SIZEi,t-1\n\u00b7 GROWTHi,t-1\n\u00b7 LOANSi,t-1\n\u00b7 EQUITYi,t-1\n+ i,t\nIn the regression model k is a constant,  is a time fixed effect, and  is a bank\nfixed effect. To account for endogeneity we lag regressors by one period. The variable\nY stands for ROE, ROA, RAROE, RAROA respectively.8\nWe use the following control variables:\n1. HHI is the Herfindahl index for concentration in the banks' loan portfolios, i.e.\nthis index measures diversification in the interest earning business. We differentiate\nbetween nine sectors: (1) agricultural, forestry and fishing products, (2) services, (3)\nmanufacturing industry, (4) building sector, (5) housing market, (6) trade, mainte-\nnance and repair of motor vehicles, (7) deferred payment credits and non-deferred\npayment credits, (8) energy, water supply and mining, (9) communications services.\n2. NPL is the share of non-performing loans relative to customer loans. This ratio\nmeasures risk in the credit portfolio.\n3. SIZE is the natural logarithm of banks' total assets in million euro. We use\nthis variable to capture bank size. Larger banks have more resources to build up\nknow how and technologies for high-quality risk-management. Furthermore, a larger\nsize allows the bank to exploit economies of scale. Small banks, on the other hand,\nmight take advantage of the greater flexibility (Chiorazzo et al., 2008).\n4. GROWTH is the growth rate of banks' total deflated assets. On the one hand\nthis variable reflects a bank's growing business opportunities. On the other hand,\nhowever, it may also be viewed as a proxy for bank managers' preference for risk\ntaking, assuming that risk-loving managers usually prefer fast growth.\n5. EQUITY is the ratio of equity to total assets and describes the degree of\ntotal financial leverage. This variable also represents a proxy for bank managers'\n8Following Chiorazzo et al. (2008) we analyze the effects on RAROE and RAROA in a fixed\neffects framework, although volatility is time invariant. Interpreting the results one has to bear\nin mind that part of the risk-adjustment is absorbed by the fixed effects.\nrisk aversion, since risk averse bank managers tend to keep more equity than risk\nloving managers.\n6. LOANS is the ratio of loans to total assets and is also a proxy for bank\nmanagers' risk aversion, assuming that a high degree of capitalization signals a high\nrisk aversion and vice versa.\nThe ROE (ROA) standard deviation ROE\n) is explained in cross-sectional\nregressions, using the same covariates as in the fixed-effects panel regressions with\ndependent variables ROE (ROA) and risk-adjusted ROE (ROA). Since ROE\n)\nis calculated from annual panel data all of the explanatory variables are averaged\nover time (indicated by bars over the variables). Following Stiroh (2004b) we also\ninclude year dummies (YEAR) to capture time trends and unobservable macroeco-\nnomic effects.9\ni\n\u00b7 HHIi\n\u00b7 NPLi\n+ Y EARi\n+ i\nTo solve the endogeneity problem we use an instrumental variables approach,\napplying the two-stage least squares estimator with the following specification in\n\u00b7 HHIi\n\u00b7 NPLi\n+\n+ Y EARi\n+ i\nIn the first stage we add three variables as excluded instruments: COMMER-\nCIAL, SERVICE, and DEPOSITS. As proposed by DeYoung and Rice (2004) we\ninclude COMMERCIAL, the ratio of commercial and industrial loans relative to to-\ntal loans. We assume that the cross-selling potential in the fee business is higher for\nbanks serving a larger share of commercial customers. SERVICE is a measure of ser-\nvice intensity, assuming that banks with higher service capacity have more resources\nto perform fee-generating activities. We create SERVICE by dividing the number of\nfull-time employees by deflated loan volume. DEPOSITS is the ratio of demand de-\nposits, term deposits, and time deposits relative to total assets. This ratio is a proxy\nfor traditional relationship banking, assuming that there is a certain cross-selling\npotential to the respective clients holding deposits (De Young and Rice, 2004). To\nsummarize, all our instruments proxy a bank's ability to engage in the fee business\nthrough customer relations, service capacities and cross-selling opportunities.\n9Note that we base our study on an unbalanced panel as (mainly because of mergers) not all\n10For the sake of consistency in the second stage of the model we do not use a tobit specification\nin the first stage (Angrist and Krueger, 2001).\n4.3.3 Fee income and interest margins\nIn this section we examine the link between banks' interest rate setting and the shift\ntowards fee generating activities. From the latter we would expect opportunities in\nthe interest business, i.e. for the cross-selling of loans. We employ a dealership-\nbased model of the bank which allows us to derive the determinants of the interest\nmargin (Ho and Saunders, 1981). In this model banks are considered risk-averse\nintermediaries between lenders and borrowers. In doing so, banks are exposed to\ncompetitive pressures, as well as interest rate and credit risk which determine their\ninterest margins. As proposed by Maudos and Fern\u00e1ndez de Guevara (2004) we\nadditionally control for managerial efficiency measured by the cost-income ratio,\nassuming that less efficient banks are obliged to charge higher margins. A bank's\nnet interest margin (NIM) is defined by total interest income minus total interest\nexpenses. The model setup is as follows:\nNIMi,t\n= k + t\n+ i\n\u00b7 SHFEEi,t\n\u00b7 BDRi,t\n+\n\u00b7 CIRi,t\n\u00b7 COMPi,t\n+ i,t\n1. R3M is the 3-month interbank rate (EURIBOR)11. R3M is expected to have\na positive effect on NIM, since the interest spread is expected to widen with in-\ncreasing interest rates. Furthermore an increase in the risk-free rate implies higher\nopportunity costs.\n2. BDR is a measure of borrower default risk, which is either presented by the\nratio of loan loss provisions relative to customer loans (LLP) or by the share of\nnon-performing loans relative to customer loans (NPL).\n3. EQUITY is the ratio of equity to total assets. This variable has two inter-\npretations: first, it is a proxy for the degree of banks' risk aversion and, second, it\naccounts for the effect of leverage on risk levels and the required risk premium.\n4. COMP is a Herfindahl index for regional market concentration based on lend-\ning data from the Bundesbank credit register. The index is calculated as the average\nconcentration across banks in each state (\"Bundesland\"), weighted by the bank's loan\nexposure in the state. The higher the share of COMP, the greater the concentration\nin this state and vice versa.12\n5. CIR is the cost-income ratio, calculated as operating expenses relative to gross\nincome. The literature provides mixed results on the expected coefficients. On the\none hand, a lowering in the cost structure should decrease interest rate margins.\nOn the other hand, screening and monitoring of borrowers require higher personnel\ncosts, which could also result in an increase of CIR and a lowering in default risk\npremium charged on loans.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the average transaction size positively influences\nthe interest margin. Since this variable can not be computed from our data, and is\n12Notice that the credit register reports exposures above 1.5 million Euro which leads to a certain\nbias towards large banks in this measure for regional market concentration.\nalso ignored in most of the other studies13, we also disregard this indicator. In an\nextended version of the model we interact credit risk with the fee-income share. By\nincluding this indicator we test how credit pricing, assuming given credit risk, varies\naccording to banks' share of fee business. This interpretation only holds provided\nfees are charged at an identical flat, meaning that the same conditions apply for any\ncustomer, or if fees are not risk dependent.\n5 Regression results\n5.1 Return and risk-adjusted return in the fee business\nTable 1 reports the statistics for fixed-effects regressions by banking group. For each\nsavings, cooperative, and commercial banks the share of fee earnings (FEE) has a\npositive and significant coefficient for risk-adjusted return on equity (RAROE) and\nrisk-adjusted return on total assets (RAROA). Furthermore, in the ROE and ROA\nregressions the coefficient on FEE is also positive and significant for commercial and\ncooperative banks. These results are in line with Chiorazzo et al. (2008) and Smith\net al. (2003) but differ from U.S. studies like those of Stiroh and Rumble (2006) and\nDe Young and Rice (2004). Since universal banking has been the historic norm in\nGermany as well as many European Countries, these banks may be more experienced\nin generating fee income and exploiting diversification benefits (De Young and Rice,\nWe also record some interesting results regarding bank size. While private banks\nappear to gain from economies of scale, in the case of savings and cooperative banks\nsize is negatively correlated with returns.14 This finding might be explained by the\nrole of small cooperative and savings banks in rural areas, where they face less com-\npetition than bigger savings and cooperative banks face in urban areas. Commercial\nbanks, in contrast, operate mainly in urban areas with a higher potential to exploit\neconomies of scale.\nThe banking groups also differ in terms of the effects of bank growth on the share\nof fee business. While for commercial banks ROE (ROA) and RAROE (RAROA)\nare not affected by growth, for savings and cooperative banks we find a positive\nassociation. Moreover, the positive sign on HHI suggests that ROE (ROA) and\nRAROE (RAROA) increase in line with a more concentrated loan portfolio. This\nmay be due to the fact that small German banks are able to generate benefits from\ntheir core lending activities. This result is in line with Hayden et al. (2006) and Behr\net al. (2007) who also find diseconomies of scope in the German banking sector. Such\ndiseconomies can arise if a bank has insufficient monitoring expertise in new lending\nactivities. The small number of significant coefficients on commercial banks result\nfrom the heterogeneity within this banking group.\nreturn in a sample which is mainly dominated by cooperative banks.\nTable 1: Fee business and bank returns\nCooperative banks Savings banks Commercial banks\nRobust standard errors in parentheses. ***, **, * denote significance on a 1 percent, 5 percent or 10 percent level, respectively.\n5.2 Risk in the fee business\nRisk is measured by the ROE (ROA) standard deviation () and is explained in two-\nstage least squares regressions. \"Good instruments\" for FEE should be both relevant\nand valid, i.e. the instruments should be correlated with the endogenous repressors\nand, at the same time, be orthogonal to the residuals (Baum et al., 2003).One rule of\nthumb is that the F-statistic of excluded instruments should not be less than 10. If\nthere are at least two instruments, overidentification restrictions can be tested with\nHansen's J-Test (Sargan's statistic), where rejection of the null hypothesis suggests\nthat at least one instrument is not exogenous (Wooldridge, 2003). In our regressions\nthe conditions for relevant and valid instruments are satisfied. All instruments are\nsignificant, except for COMMERCIAL in the group of commercial banks. The F-\nstatistic of excluded instruments is above 10. Furthermore, a comparison with Staiger\nand Stocks' critical values shows that the bias of IV-estimation is below 5 percent\nof the bias of OLS estimation. Hansen's J-statistics indicate that exogeneity can not\nbe rejected at the 10% level. The results by banking group for the first-stage are\nFirst, while for savings and commercial banks loan quality does not play a role in\nthe first-stage regressions, cooperative banks that face a higher loan quality are more\nactive in the fee business. The negative relationship seems to be reasonable as banks\nunder good management should enjoy a higher loan quality and, at the same time,\nbe better at generating fee income. Second, the negative sign on LOANS denotes\nthat banks with intermediation-based strategies rely on interest income generating\nactivities rather than on fee business. Third, bank size does not affect FEE for\ncommercial and savings banks; larger cooperative banks, however, are more engaged\nin fee-based activities than smaller ones. We anticipated this sign, since larger banks\nhave a greater capacity to generate fee income. Fourth, cooperative and savings\nbanks differ with respect to the coefficient on loan portfolio diversification. More\nspecialized savings banks exhibit a higher share of fee earnings, possibly because\nthey offer precisely compatible products for their customers and have better cross-\nselling opportunities. On the other hand, cooperative banks with diversified loan\nportfolios are increasingly engaged in the fee business, too, possibly based on a\ncomprehensive, bank-wide diversification strategy. Fifth, commercial and savings\nbanks that hold a higher amount of equity per unit assets are more concentrated\nin the interest business. Banks with little interest income can afford to hold less\nequity as a bank's balance sheet is mainly affected by interest-generating activities.\nAs with savings banks in our regressions, EQUITY could be negatively associated\nwith SHFEE, as fee-generating activities require less regulatory capital.\nThe coefficients of the second-stage regression are presented in table 3. Here we\nfind ROE (ROA) volatility is only significant for the commercial banks group. The\npositive coefficient implies that an increase in the share of fee income destabilizes\nprofitability, i.e. ROE\n) increases. For savings and cooperative banks we find\nno significant influence on ROE (ROA) volatility. The different findings for banking\n15In the case of savings and cooperative banks, the first stage is identical for both ROE and\nROA regressions as they are based on the same sample. For private banks we include one\nmore observation in the regression on ROA than we have in the regression on ROE. Since this\nobservation does not lead to relevant changes, we tabulate only the ROE regression for the\nfirst stage.\nTable 2: First stage regression: determinants of fee income\nCooperative banks Savings banks Commercial banks\nRobust standard errors in parentheses. ***, **, * denote significance on a 1 percent,\n5 percent or 10 percent level respectively\ngroups can be explained by the fact that commercial banks are already much more\ninvolved in fee business than savings and cooperative banks. Assuming that banks\nperform risk-return oriented ABC analyses to evaluate opportunities in the fee busi-\nness, an already high level of fee business implies additional C-class engagements, as\nA/B-class opportunities are already exhausted. Hence, for commercial banks, risk\nincreases in line with expanded in fee-generating activities. Another explanation is\nthat commercial banks run other types of fee-business than savings and cooperative\nbanks. While savings and cooperatives tend to have fees from insurance etc., more\nvolatile lines of fee-business matter for private banks, e.g. asset management and\nloan securitization.\nAs the results in section 5.1 indicate the increase in ROE (ROA) volatility is out-\nweighed by the increase in ROE (ROA). Hence, the fee income share positively in-\nfluences risk-adjusted return, i.e. the coefficient of SHFEE is positive in the RAROE\n(RAROA) regressions.\nWith regard to loan portfolio diversification, we also record different results\nacross banking groups from the two-stage least squares regressions. According to\nportfolio theory returns should be more volatile for banks with specialized loan\nportfolios; as far as cooperative banks are concerned this theorem is confirmed by\nour analysis. Finally, we find that well capitalized banks and banks with less risky\nloan portfolios enjoy more stable returns. 16\n16Robustness checks are performed. First we use a tobit model in the first stage. Second we include\na variable \"number of years in the sample\", to account for the case that a bank which is observed\nfor a shorter time horizon would have a higher volatility of return. The results remain stable.\nTable 3: Second stage regression: determinants of risk in the fee business\nCooperative banks Savings banks Commercial banks\nRobust standard errors in parentheses. ***, **, * denote significance on a 1 percent 5 percent or\n10 percent level, respectively.\n5.3 Interest margin and non-interest income\nIn the income diversification literature we uncover evidence of a relationship be-\ntween banks' non-interest activities and their loan pricing. This relationship is jus-\ntified by possible cross-subsidization (or cross-selling) effects, as banks might just\ncharge a lower interest margin when they expect increased revenues from fees and\ncommissions in the non-interest business (Lepetit et al., 2008). To analyze possible\ncross-subsidization effects between interest and fee income in the German banking\nindustry we specify a bank loan pricing model. In this model we explain banks'\nnet interest margins (interest income minus interest expenses) using a vector of\nprevailing variables in the literature to specify this kind of model. Table 4 shows\nthe results from the fixed effects panel regressions by banking group. As expected,\nthe fee income variable (SHFEE) has a significant negative coefficient suggesting\npossible cross-selling of lending and fee generating activities. In order to detail this\nfinding we control for the interaction of fee income and credit risk, where the latter\nis measured by non-performing loans (NPL) and loan loss provisions (LLP). While\nwe obtain only for the group of cooperative banks significant results for the first\ncredit risk variable, the LLP \u00b7 SHFEE interaction term indicates a lower interest\nmargin for savings and commercial banks, given LLP, when the share of fee in-\ncome increases. In other words, we find that savings and commercial banks charge\na lower risk premium for a given level of borrower default risk (measured by LLP),\nwhen they are more engaged in fee generating activities. In summary, we find that\ninstitutions from those two banking groups underprice credit risk when they have\nadditional opportunities to generate income from fees and commissions and inter-\npret this finding as an indication of some cross-subsidization (or cross-selling) effects\nbetween interest and fee business.17\n17Cross-subsidization effects should be examined in more detail by explaining loan-specific pricing.\nIn the supervisory balance sheet data for Germany, however, interest margins as well as fees\nand commissions can only be calculated as bank averages, a limitation that is also mentioned\nThe remaining control variables also confirm expected signs. A higher credit risk,\nmeasured by LLP, is associated with larger interest margins. Also, higher money\nmarket rates increase interest margins, as opportunity costs rise. As stated in sub-\nsection 4.3.3, theoretically coefficients on CIR can have different signs. While the\nsign on CIR is negative for commercial banks, the impact is positive for coopera-\ntive banks and insignificant for savings banks. Market concentration plays a role in\nthe cases of cooperative and savings banks because, as one would expect, institu-\ntions which operate in more concentrated markets charge higher interest margins.\nFinally, as EQUITY focuses on the effect of leverage on risk levels and the required\nrisk premium its coefficients are strongly significant for all banking groups.\nTable 4: Interest margin\nCooperative banks Savings banks Commercial banks\nRobust standard errors in parentheses; ***, **, * denote significance of a 1 percent, 5 percent or 10 percent significance level, respectively.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this study we focus on the primary income sources of banks: interest and fee\nbusiness. Our database is a micro panel of supervisory balance sheet data (BAKIS)\nand information about banks' lending to industry sectors (borrowers' statistics) for\nthe years 1995 to 2007. An essential aspect of our analysis is the treatment of en-\ndogeneity between banks' risk-return-characteristics and their activity in fee income\ngenerating operations. For the treatment of endogeneity we specify two models: one\nis a fixed-effects panel model with regressors lagged by one year and, the second is\na two-stage least squares estimator. The latter approach also allows us to analyze\nthe factors determining a banks' participation in the fee income business.\nIn our analysis, we show that banks with a large share of fee income exhibit\na more favorable risk-return profile, i.e. they enjoy a higher risk-adjusted return\non equity (ROE) and total assets (ROA). Additionally, we find that for commer-\ncial banks strong involvement in the fee business is accompanied by higher ROE-\nand ROA-volatility and, therefore, with increased risk. In particular for commercial\nbanks some fee income activities are associated with much higher risks than other\nincome sources and, therefore, they could contribute to destabilize both individual\nbanks as well as the whole banking system.\nIn the regression statistics we show that both return measures, ROE and ROA,\nshow robust results, not only in the fixed effects panel models but also in the two-\nstage least squares estimator.\nThe second part of the paper focuses on banks' interest margins. In order to ana-\nlyze possible cross-subsidization effects between interest and fee business we specify\na bank loan pricing model. In this model we explain banks' net interest margins (in-\nterest income minus interest expenses) by a vector of variables which are standard\nfor this kind of model specification. Here we find that for savings and commercial\nbanks institutions with a strong focus on fee business charge lower interest margins\nwhen credit risk is controlled by loan loss provisions. The examination of cross-\nsubsidization effects, however, is limited by data constraints, as for Germany loan-\nspecific interest rates are not available, i.e. interest margins can only be calculated\nas bank averages.\nReferences\nAngrist, J.
