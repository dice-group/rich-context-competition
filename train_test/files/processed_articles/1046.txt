With multilevel regressions both individual as well as contextual effects on self\nrated health were estimated.\nMain results: The effect of income inequality is not negative on men's self rated health as long as the level\nof inequality is not very great. When inequality levels are high, however, there is a tendency for men's\nhealth to be negatively affected. Regional health differences among men are in part explained by regional\nincome differences. On the other hand, women do not seem to be affected in the same way, and individual\ncharacteristics like age and educational level seem to be more important.\nConclusions: It seems that a rise in income inequality has no negative effect on men's self rated health as\nlong as the level of inequality is not very great. On the other hand, when inequality levels are higher a rise\ntends to affect men's health negatively. A curvilinear relation between self rated health and income\ndistribution is an interesting hypothesis. It could help to explain the confusing results that arise when you\nlook at countries with a high degree of income inequality (USA) and those with lower income inequality\n(for example, Japan and New Zealand).\nSince the fall of the communist regime in the early 1990s,\nand with the introduction of ``shock therapy'' in January\n1992, Russia has experienced dramatic economic and\nsocial changes. In response to these, Russian public health\ndeteriorated with an increasing mortality and a falling life\nrecovered somewhat, but only to start falling again in 1999\nThe economic changes have been difficult for many\nRussians. Rising unemployment rates and large groups of\npeople falling into poverty can illustrate this. The income\ndistribution has widened substantially, but only a very small\ngroup of Russians have benefited economically from the\nrecent changes. A good example of this is that about 80% of\nthe citizens in the city of Taganrog (Rostovskaya Oblast),\njudged their financial situation to have worsened between\nMoreover, there is good reason to believe that different\nparts of Russia have been affected differently economically,\nsocially, and in health, with some parts of the country\nmanaging the transition better than others. Shkolnikov and\nCornia4 found a greater deterioration in life expectancy in the\nthe Moscow and St Petersburg areas experienced the biggest\ndeteriorations during this period and therefore, they con-\ncluded, the decreases cannot be attributable to the economic\ncrisis as these two areas performed relatively better than\nother areas during this period. Walberg et al5 concluded that\nthe decline in Russian life expectancy cannot be attributed to\nimpoverishment only. Regions that have experienced the\nmost dramatic transition, with, for example, increasing\nincome inequalities as one result, have lost their social\ncohesion and therefore experienced a rise in mortality. The\neconomic and social changes during the early 1990s, created\na psychosocial stress among people that led to harmful\nbehaviours such as increased heavy alcohol consumption or\nincreased criminality.\nKennedy et al6 found an association between indicators of\nsocial capital and life expectancy in the Russian regions.\nRegions with higher mistrust in government, higher crimin-\nality, worse working relations, and poorer engagement in\npolitics also had a lower life expectancy. Therefore, they\nsuggested ``... that indicators of social capital could account\nfor an important portion of the cross-sectional variation in\nmortality and life expectancy across the regions of the\ncountry.'' (page 2037). Moreover, the relation between social\ncapital and mortality persisted when they controlled for per\ncapita income and poverty.\nThus, it seems that poverty in itself cannot explain regional\nvariations in mortality or life expectancy, but rather social\nand social-psychological factors associated with the economic\nand political changes.\nThere has been a lively discussion in the medical and social\nsciences about whether (and how) income inequalities can\naffect the health of the individual.7\u00ad9 Wilkinson7 suggested\nthat the distribution of incomes in a society may affect\npeople's health, at least in economically developed societies.\nIt is hypothesised that wide differences in income will\nnegatively affect social cohesion and feelings of trust and\nsolidarity, which in turn will affect all members of the\nsociety, but in particular those in a disadvantaged social\nposition. These will feel disadvantaged compared with others\nhigher up. Lynch et al9 are sceptical about this ``psychosocial''\ninterpretation and argue that ``Interpretation of links\nbetween income inequality and health must begin with the\nstructural causes of inequalities, and not just focus on\nperceptions of that inequality.'' (page1200) Income inequal-\nity is a consequence of several structural processes and these\nalso affect the individual's possibilities of getting, for\nexample, education, occupation, food, housing, health\nwww.jech.com\nservices, etc, which all are related to health. In other words,\nto understand the relation between income inequality and\nhealth, you should focus on those processes that create these\ninequalities. It is reasonable to believe that these structural\nprocesses have both psychosocial as well as material effects\non health.10 However, the question is how to separate them.\nIt has also been argued that attention should be directed\naway from income inequality. Deaton11 argues that income\ninequality in itself does not have any causal effect on\npopulation health and therefore any relation found can be\nexplained by some other factors, for example, poverty.\nInstead, he argues, focus should be on the health promoting\nrole of income.\nSeveral studies have examined the relation between\nincome inequality and public health in various countries\nand the results are mixed. Kennedy et al8 found from the USA\nthat people living in states with the greatest inequality were\nmore likely to report poor health than others. On the other\nhand, evidence from New Zealand (mortality) and Japan\n(self rated health) show no, or only a very weak, associa-\ntion.12 13 A Canadian study showed some evidence that higher\nincome inequality was related to better health, but the most\nimportant factor, however, seemed to be household income.14\nStudies on this topic conducted in Russia or other eastern\nEuropean countries are more sparse. Bobak et al15 found no\nrelation between income inequality and self rated health in\nseven post-communist countries. Instead, individual factors\nsuch as education and material deprivation were most\nstrongly related to self rated health.\nThe aim of the study is (1) to investigate whether in the\nregions of Russia income distribution has a ``contextual''\neffect on people's self rated health, and (2) whether regional\nincome distributions are related to regional differences in\nhealth.\nThe Russia longitudinal monitoring survey (RLMS) is a\nsurvey that is representative of the Russian population and\nhas been carried out at repeated intervals since 1992. It is\nobviously very difficult to obtain a sample that is representa-\ntive of the entire Russian population. In brief, the selection\nprocedure entailed the following three steps. (1) In accor-\ndance with certain criteria (including degree of urbanisation)\na number of regions were selected that together would\nrepresent the vast country's enormous heterogeneity. (2) A\nnumber of electoral districts were chosen at random. (3) A\nregister of households in each electoral district was used to\nselect a total of some 7000 households. The response rate was\naround 90% for the earliest surveys and about 80% for the\nlater ones. In this paper, the 1998 survey is analysed (a\ndetailed explanation of the study design and selection\nstrategy is available on the RLMS web site http://\nThus, RLMS is designed to obtain a national representative\nsample; results at the regional level may therefore not be\nrepresentative. Thus, to control for statistical problems\nrelated to the sample design and to separate the ``con-\ntextual effects'' (that is, the effects of group level properties\non the individuals) from individual ones, a multilevel\ntechnique with random intercepts was used, whereby you\ncan control for some statistical problems (for example,\nclustering) and thereafter estimate both individual and\ncontextual effects.16\u00ad18 The statistical software used was\nMLwiN 1.10. The multilevel model includes five levels, but\nonly the regional level and the individual level will be\ncommented on here. The other three levels--that is, family,\ncensus district, and population centre--are included only to\ncontrol for possible design problems related the sampling\nprocedure.\nThe logic of the regression models look like this;\nis the intercept, and is allowed to vary on five levels: i\n(individual), j (family), k (census district), l (population\ncentre), and m (primary sampling unit, i.e. region).\nrepresents the effects of the independent variables (here\nillustrated by x1ijklm\n) at individual level.\nrepresents the effects of the independent variables (here\nillustrated by x2jklm\n) at family level.\nrepresents the effects of the independent variables (here\nillustrated by x3m\n) at regional level.\nAccordingly, the models allow for random intercepts and\nfixed effects, which means that the intercepts are allowed to\nvary between, for example, regions, but the slopes (b) are\nassumed to be equal.19\nDependent variable\nSelf rated health is measured on a five point scale indicating\nwhether the respondent rates their health as ``very good'' (5),\n``good'' (4), ``average'' (3), ``poor'' (2) or ``very poor'' (1).\nIndependent variables\nThe household's reported total income was used to estimate\nthe individual's economic situation, the mean income level of\neach region, and the regional income distribution. To control\nfor family composition, the household's total income was\ndivided by the number of household members. However, the\nhousehold members were weighted differently. The first\nadult person in the household had a weight of 1.0, while all\nothers received a weight of 0.8. The most appropriate\nequivalence scale has been discussed earlier,20 and the choice\nmade here was based on a study from another post-Soviet\neconomy--that is, Estonia.21 The Gini coefficient was used to\nIncome inequality (Gini)\nWomen\nMean self rated health\nIncome inequality (Gini)\nMen\nMean self rated health\nFigure 1 Regional income inequality and mean self rated health in 38\nRussian regions.\nwww.jech.com\nmeasure regional income inequality and was calculated as\nfollows;\nN represents the number of households, m is the mean\nhousehold income, yi\nsymbolises household ``I'', and yj\nsymbolises household ``j''. As we do not have any expressed\nhypotheses about how the relation between income inequal-\nity and health may look like, linear or non-linear, we tested\nseveral models. A non-linear model, where the Gini\ncoefficient was squared, fitted the data best and was\ntherefore finally kept.\nBoth at individual and regional level the natural logarithm\nof household income is used, as it is assumed that the\npossible effects on health will stagnate at higher income\nlevels, both at individual and regional level.\nBackground variables\nSeveral background variables are controlled for in the analy-\nses (models 2\u00ad4). These are; age (in years), marital status\n(married or not married), type of settlement ((1) urban, (2)\nurban-rural, (3) rural) and education ((1) graduate school,\n(2) university, academy, (3) technical, medical, music,\npedagogical, art school, (4) vocational technical school with\na secondary education, (5) vocational school without a\nsecondary education, (6) professional courses).\nRESULTS\nComparisons and interpretations from table 1 must be carried\nout with caution, as the results may not be representative for\neach region. However, we can see significant ``regional''\nvariations in self rated health as well as in income and\nincome distribution. One region (Kabardino-Balkarija, Zolskij\nRajon) was excluded from further analyses, because of its\ngreat deviation from the other regions and it was therefore\nconsidered an outlier (see fig 1).\nIn tables 2 and 3, men and women were analysed\nseparately.\nFrom model 1 (tables 2 and 3) we can see that the average\nintercept). As expected, men rate their health better than\nwomen. There also seems to be, both for men and women, a\nsignificant, but not particularly large, regional proportion,\nvariation. In model 2 several background variables were\nincluded. Age, marital status (for men), and education but\nnot type of settlement had a significant effect on self rated\nhealth. In other words, older people, unmarried men\n(compared with married men), and the lower educated\n(compared with those with the highest education) tend to\nrate their health as worse. The regional variation (that is,\nvariance explained by region) seemed to increase somewhat\ndecreased considerably among women (242%). In model 3,\nthe household's total income was introduced to the model\ntogether with the mean household income of the region.\nTable 1 Regional distributions of self rated health, household income, and household income distribution in Russia 1998\nRegion (PSU)\nMean self rated health\nMean household\nincome\nHousehold income\ndistribution\nTotal Men Women (Eq scale) (Gini)\nRelatively poor, absolutely ill? 391\nwww.jech.com\nNone of these economic measures seemed to relate to the\nindividual's perceived health. The regional variation\nremained the same, both for men and women.\nFinally in model 4, regional income distribution (Gini) was\nincluded. For men (table 2), the squared Gini coefficient was\nsignificantly related to self rated health, showing a curve-\nlinear relation. Thus, at ``lower'' levels of inequality an\nincrease seems to slightly improve self rated health, but at\n``higher'' levels an increase seems to have a negative effect on\nself rated health. However, the effect does not seem to be very\nstrong. Among women there was a similar, but weak and\nnon-significant, curve-linear relation (table 3). For a graphi-\ncal presentation, see figure 2.\nIt is equally interesting to look at changes in the regional\nvariation. Among men, variance explained by region changed\nreduction. However, there was no change at all for women.\nDISCUSSION\nMay biases in the analysed data have affected the results? It\nshould be noted that the data are not necessarily representa-\ntive at the regional level. However, this is not a particular\nproblem because the aim of the study was to analyse the\npossible relation between income inequality and self rated\nhealth, and not to present representative estimations of levels\nof household income, self rated health, etc. Moreover, the\nused multilevel design is intended to control for possible\nstatistical problems, for example, clustering. Another pro-\nblem is the level of aggregation of income inequality. In this\nstudy the primary sampling units were used because this is as\nclose as we can get to where the federal political and\neconomic structures are formed. At the same time it is a level\nthat forms a significant cultural identity and to where people\nGini\nWomen\nPredicted self rated health\nGini\nMen\nPredicted self rated health\nFigure 2 Regional income inequality and predicted self rated health in\nRussia.\nTable 2 Self rated health regressed on independent variables (random intercept models): men\nVariable\nb SE b SE b SE b SE\nMarital status\nNot married ref ref ref\nType of settlement\nUrban ref ref ref\nEducation\n1 ref ref ref\nIncome distribution (Gini)\n(squared)\nVariance components\nVariance explained by region\nwww.jech.com\ncan relate. Of course it would be possible to analyse\ninequalities on other levels, for example cities, neighbour-\nhoods, families, etc, to where people can relate. However, it\ncan still be argued that the chosen level of aggregation here is\nmeaningful, both from the individual perspective and from a\nmacro structural one.\nSelf rated health was analysed as a continuous variable,\nbut as it is unclear whether this variable forms a continuum\nor not,22 an additional multilevel logistic regression was\nperformed. However, the results were very similar and the\nless complex models were kept.\nIt seems that a rise in income inequality has no negative\neffect on men's self rated health as long as the level of\ninequality is not very high. On the other hand, at higher\nlevels of inequality, a rise tends to affect men's health\nnegatively. Women do not seem to be affected in the same\nway. Individual characteristics like age and educational level\nseem more important. A curvilinear relation between self\nrated health and income distribution is an interesting\nhypothesis. It could help to explain the confusing results\nthat arise when you look at countries with a high degree of\nincome inequality (USA) and those with lower income\ninequality (for example, Japan and New Zealand).\nThe regional variation in self rated health cannot be\nconsidered large in relation to the total variation and this is,\nof course, not very surprising. It is more interesting to look at\nthe changes in regional variation between the models.\nAmong women, there was only a change when individual\ncharacteristics (age, marital status, type of settlement, and\neducation) were included. Perhaps these factors are more\nimportant in explaining female regional variations in self\nrated health. For men however, the regional variation in self\nrated health declined when income inequality was taken into\naccount. Moreover, we can conclude that the effect that\nincome inequality has on men's self rated health is not\nattributable to their own economic situation or that of the\nregion in which they live.\nThus, regional income inequality in Russia seems to affect\nmale self rated health to some extent, even though the effect\ncannot be seen as very strong. For women, it seems that other\nfactors are more important. Why men seem to be more\naffected by income inequalities than women is a matter of\nspeculation, but men and women may well be differently\nsensitive to different exposures.\n"
