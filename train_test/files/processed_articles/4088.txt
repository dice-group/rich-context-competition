    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe study household and context determinants of school dropout using data for 130,000 children in 363 regions of 30\ndeveloping countries using multi-level discrete-time event-history analysis. Most (72%) of the variation in school dropout is\ndue to household-level factors, with socioeconomic resources (parental education, father's occupation, and wealth) being\nmost important. Household structure plays a role too. Earlier born, non-biological children and children living with one\nparent drop out more. Important context factors are educational resources (availability of schools and teachers) and level\nof development of the region. Interaction analysis reveals that many effects of household-level factors depend on context\ncharacteristics, stressing the importance of a situation-specific approach. Results also indicate that the transition from primary\nto secondary education is a major breaking point in children's educational careers and that extending the duration of primary\neducation might be an effective strategy to keep children in school longer.\n",

It empowers people, improves individuals' earning\npotential, promotes a healthy population, is a major determi-\nnant of democracy, and builds a competitive economy\nHanushek & W\u00f6ssmann, 2007; United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2015; The\nWorld Bank, 2006). Since the start of the Education for All\n(EFA) campaign after the World Education Forum in Jomtien\nin 1990, remarkable progress has been made in getting young\nchildren in developing countries into primary education.\nHowever, still millions of children drop out of school at too\nyoung an age, shifting the problem from getting children into\nschool to keeping them there. In many countries in South and\nWest Asia and sub-Sahara Africa, one in every four children\nwho start school drops out before completion (UNESCO,\n2015). Children who leave school before they have finished\nthe curriculum do not develop their potential to the fullest,\nand their countries waste scarce resources sorely needed. It is\ntherefore of prime importance to get a better understanding\nof the factors that drive the decision to drop out of school in\ndeveloping countries.\nMost research on dropout has been conducted in the United\nStates and other highly developed countries. About the situa-\ntion in less developed countries, much less is known. This is a\npity because, as Buchmann and Hannum (2001) already noted,\nimproving our understanding of the determinants of educa-\ntional participation in developing countries might provide us\nwith new insights into the roots of educational stratification\nbeyond what we already know from Western countries. For\nexample, there is evidence that in poorer countries school char-\nacteristics are more important for educational achievement\nthan in richer countries (Fuller & Clarke, 1994; Heyneman &\nLoxley, 1983), and that in sub-Sahara African countries grow-\ning up in a single mother family is less detrimental (and some-\ntimes even beneficial) for children's education than in more\n1Radboud University, Centre for International Development Issues\nNijmegen (CIDIN), The Netherlands\n2Radboud University, Institute for Management Research, Global Data\nLab, Nijmegen, The Netherlands\nCorresponding Author:\nJanine Huisman, Centre for International Development Issues Nijmegen\nNetherlands.\nEmail: j.huisman@fm.ru.nl\nKeeping Children in School: Effects of\nHousehold and Context Characteristics\nDeveloping Countries\nJanine Huisman1 and Jeroen Smits2\n Keywords\neducation, school dropout, developing countries, school characteristics, interaction analysis\n2 SAGE Open\nIn this article, we aim to contribute to the literature on\nschool dropout in developing countries by answering the fol-\nlowing research questions:\nResearch Question 1: Which household, district, and\nnational factors influence the decision to stay in school?\nResearch Question 2: How are the direct effects of these\nfactors moderated by characteristics of the context in\nwhich the children live?\nTo address these questions, we use a comprehensive theo-\nretical framework derived from literature that structures the\nmany factors that influence the decision to drop out of school\n(cf. Spierings, Smits, & Verloo, 2010; Webbink, Smits, & de\nJong, 2013). This framework distinguishes between three\nconditions that affect this decision (resources, structure, and\nculture), which manifest themselves differently at the differ-\nent levels of analysis (household, district, national). With\nrespect to these conditions, we test three hypotheses.\nHypothesis 1: Children from households and contexts\nwith more resources are more likely to stay in school.\nHypothesis 2: Children from households and contexts\nwith a structure in which it is easier for children to benefit\nfrom education are more likely to stay in school.\nHypothesis 3: Children from a culture in which education\nis valued more are more likely to stay in school.\nBesides hypotheses related to our framework, we test an\nadditional hypothesis which is especially relevant from a\npolicy perspective. Given that there are indications that chil-\ndren are more likely to drop out of school right after finishing\na specific level, we formulate and test the primary duration\nhypothesis, which assumes that parents are more likely to\npull their children out of school after completion of the pri-\nmary level. If this hypothesis holds, increasing the duration\nof primary education might be an effective strategy to keep\nchildren longer in school in countries with high dropout rates\nat young ages.\nBesides predicting direct effects, our theoretical frame-\nwork allows for indirect effects in the form of interactions\nbetween the different risk factors for dropout. This increases\nthe possibilities to study determinants in their specific con-\ntext (Spierings etal., 2010). This \"role of the context\" is par-\nticularly important from a policy perspective, as problems\nwith respect to school dropout are often concentrated within\nspecific groups and regions and may require situation-\nspecific information to be addressed.\nTo answer our research questions and test our hypotheses,\nwe will apply a multi-level discrete-time event-history anal-\nysis on data for 130,000 children, living in the first years of\nThis analysis improves earlier research in three important\nways. First, we study effects of risk factors at the household\nand at the context level simultaneously, providing better esti-\nmates of the relative importance of the separate risk factors.\nSecond, with context data on 363 districts, our explanatory\npower for studying context effects is much larger than that in\nearlier studies using only context information at the national\nlevel. Third, we enriched our database with information from\nadministrative sources about the availability and quality of\neducational facilities in the regions where the children live.\nThis makes a detailed analysis of the role of supply-side fac-\ntors possible.\nTheoretical Framework\nTo obtain a thorough understanding of the roots of school\ndropout, we have to analyze the effects of all relevant factors\nat the various levels simultaneously. To make such an analy-\nsis possible, we have built an extensive theoretical frame-\nwork for understanding school dropout, taking models for\nlabor participation of women and children as a starting point.\nFollowing Spierings etal. (2010), our framework is built on\nthe following four ideas: (a) the context in which children\nlive can be divided into different levels (household, commu-\nnity, national); (b) decisions regarding educational participa-\ntion and school dropout are made at the household level, by\nparents, caretakers, and/or other family members, including\nthe child itself; (c) different factors at the different levels\ninfluence these decisions simultaneously; and (d) the strength\nof these influences may differ between contexts.\nOur framework is presented in Figure 1. At the center is\nthe decision to drop out of school or not. Because we focus\non school dropout rates, we restrict our analysis to children\nwho are or have been in school at the time of research. The\ndecision to drop out of school is dependent on the relative\nvalue that parents, caretakers of the child, and possibly the\nchild itself ascribe to educational attainment versus its alter-\nnatives, that is, helping at home and/or earning additional\nincome for the household. The factors which influence drop-\nping out are shown in ovals. These factors are located within\nconcentric circles that indicate the level at which the factors\nact, that is, household, district, and national. The lower-level\nfactors are embedded within and affected by the higher-level\nThe determining factors are further conceptualized as\nbeing part of three conditions that should be met for children\nto enter and stay in school regarding resources, structure, and\nculture (Webbink etal., 2013). Decisions regarding school-\ning of children depend first of all on the availability of suf-\nficient resources at household and context level such as\nhousehold wealth, parental education, and quality and quan-\ntity of local educational facilities. Furthermore, even if the\nnecessary resources are available, structural factors influ-\nence whether (continuing) schooling is considered the best\noption for this particular child. For instance, the household\nmight have too many children to send all of them to school,\nHuisman and Smits 3\nor one of the parents might no longer be part of the house-\nhold, so that it is considered better to let one or more children\nleave school to help out in the household. The labor market\nstructure might also be important for the decision to continue\nschooling. If people with a higher education earn substan-\ntially more, parents may decide to let their children stay lon-\nger in school. Local norms and values, that is, culture, might\nbe important too. This might influence the degree to which\npeople value education relative to other options. Especially\nfor girls, cultural barriers might prove an important force in\nreducing the time they spend in school. In the next section,\nthese conditions will be discussed in more detail.\nResources\nThe household needs to have enough of the right resources to\nbe able to send children to school. There is broad evidence\nthat children from families with more socioeconomic\nresources are more likely to stay in school (Coleman etal.,\nhouseholds, direct costs, such as fees, books, and uniforms,\nand opportunity costs, such as forgone earnings from child\nlabor, are likely to be less important (Basu, 1999). Also chil-\ndren of better educated parents more often go to school and\nUNESCO, 2015). Parents who have reached a higher level of\neducation might be better able to help their children succeed\nin school. For educational enrollment of girls, having a\nmother with a higher level of education might be especially\nimportant (Emerson & Portela Souza, 2007; Fuller, Singer,\nespecially in a non-manual occupation, might want their\nchildren to obtain a similar kind of employment and might be\nmore willing to invest time and energy in their children's\neducation (Breen & Goldthorpe, 1997). Self-employed par-\nents, such as (small) farmers, are more likely to expect their\nFigure 1. Model explaining school dropout in developing countries.\n4 SAGE Open\nolder children to drop out to help in the family business as\nNicaise, Tonguthai, and Fripont (2000) found for Thailand\nand Tansel (2002) found for Turkey. Children of a working\nmother might be taken out of school after receiving some\neducation to help out in the household.\nBoth availability and quality of educational facilities are\nimportant for educational participation, especially of specific\ngroups, like the poor and girls (Buchmann & Hannum, 2001;\n2009). If there are fewer schools available, average distance\nto school will be longer, which might negatively affect the\nlikelihood to stay in school (Colclough, Rose, & Tembon,\nmore likely to be severe for girls, partly due to parents' con-\ncern for their daughters' safety, which could become more of\na hurdle once girls reach puberty. Bad school quality has\nbeen found to have a negative effect on the decision to stay\nin school, the so-called push-out effect (Bergmann, 1996;\nAccording to Bergmann (1996), school quality is a gradient\nrunning parallel to job opportunities, \"peaking in the capital,\ndeclining through other urban areas and reaching its minima\nin remote rural areas\" (p. 601). Dropout, therefore, may be\nhighest in the rural areas. Presence of female teachers will be\nespecially important for girls (Colclough etal., 2000; Dee,\nmight not provide girls with enough support, or might even\nbe sexually threatening to them, leading to higher dropout of\nfemale pupils. The first hypothesis we will test in this article\nis therefore on resources. This resource hypothesis predicts\nthat children from households and contexts with more\nresources available for schooling are less likely to drop out\nof school.\nStructure\nThe structure of the household determines the degree of dilu-\ntion of the available resources and consequently the degree\nto which each child can actually benefit from these resources.\nThe number of siblings has been found to be negatively cor-\nrelated to educational enrollment both in the United States\n(Blake, 1989) and in some developing countries (e.g.,\nKnodel, Havanon, & Sittitrai, 1990 for Thailand and Pong,\n1997 for Malaysia). This might be because people with more\nchildren can devote less time and resources to each individ-\nual child (Downey, 1995). However, more children might\nalso mean more helping hands at home, which increases the\nchance that at least some children stay in school, as has been\nfound for Botswana (Chernichovski, 1985). The same effect\nmight be found in extended households, where relatives, par-\nticularly grandparents, may help out or contribute to the\nhousehold income, making it easier for children to stay in\nschool. Birth order has also been found to be important.\nYounger children in large families are more likely to stay in\nschool (Buchmann & Hannum, 2001; Emerson & Portela\nSouza, 2002), because the older children do the household\nchores or contribute to the household income by earning\nsome extra money (Estudillo, Sawada, & Otsuka, 2009).\nGirls, especially oldest daughters, have been found to suffer\nWestern countries and many developing countries, single\nparenthood has a negative effect on educational attainment\n(Seltzer, 1994). A possible reason being that single parents\nhave less time and attention to devote to their children.\nHowever, in some African countries, female-headed house-\nholds are associated with greater educational opportunities,\nprobably due to a higher propensity among women than\namong men to invest in children's education in situations of\nParents are also expected to favor their own children in stay-\ning in school over adopted or foster children (Fafchamps &\nWhen considering the necessity of continuing education\nbeyond a basic level, parents and children might estimate\nfuture employment prospects by looking at the current local\nlabor market structure (Chamarbagwala, 2008). Children are\nless likely to pursue further education if job opportunities for\npeople with few qualifications are good, like in districts\nwhere agriculture is a major sector (Buchmann & Brakewood,\nlikely to stay in school if formal job opportunities for which\nsecondary education is required are realistic. If it is easier for\nmen than for women to find a (well-paid) job, parents may\nalso take their child's sex into account (Colclough et\nal.,\nThe second hypothesis we will test in this article is there-\nfore on structure. This structure hypothesis predicts that in\nhouseholds and contexts where the structure is such that chil-\ndren can benefit more from the available socioeconomic and\neducational resources and from going to school, children are\nless likely to drop out of school.\nCulture\nThe local culture influences whether education is valued in\ngeneral. In more modern areas, there is generally more\nimpact of globalization, including value patterns that stress\nthe importance of education and equality among the sexes. In\nurban areas, the state influence is stronger and there might be\nmore pressure on parents and children to stay in school than\nCulture also influences whether education is valued more for\nsome children than for others. In more patriarchal cultures,\ninvestments in girl's education are expected to be lower, as\nwomen are supposed to remain in the private domain and not to\nengage in paid employment (G\u00fcnd\u00fcz-Hosg\u00f6r & Smits, 2008;\nSmits & Huisman, 2013). Parents might also be more moti-\nvated to invest in their son's education in cultures where sons\nare expected to look after their parents in old age (Colclough\nHuisman and Smits 5\nTurkey that girls from patriarchal families are more likely to\ndrop out. The third hypothesis we will test in this article is\ntherefore on culture. This culture hypothesis predicts that if\nthe local culture is such that education is valued more rela-\ntive to other options, children are less likely to drop out of\nschool.\nBesides this rather generic hypothesis on the role of cul-\nture, we will test a more specific one based on existing norms\nregarding school duration. There are indications that govern-\nments can use such norms to increase the age at which chil-\ndren leave school. If the local norm is that children leave\nschool after completing primary education, increasing the\nduration of primary education might be an effective way to\nkeep children longer in school (Aydagul, 2008; Hossain &\nour fourth hypothesis, the primary duration hypothesis, is\nthat children are more likely to drop out after finishing a spe-\ncific level. The Turkish government, for instance, in 1997,\nextended the legal duration of primary education to 8 years\naverage number of years of schooling in Turkey has increased\nconsiderably. However, because the extension was accompa-\nnied by other measures aimed at increasing participation, we\ndo not know to what extent the increase was due to the longer\nlegal duration of primary education. In this article, we test\nthis hypothesis in two ways. First, we test whether children\nhave a higher propensity to drop out directly after complet-\ning primary education. Second, we test whether countries\nwith longer legal duration of primary education have lower\ndropout rates in the higher age groups.\nThe Role of the Circumstances\nThe fourth pillar of our theoretical model is the supposition\nthat the strength of the effect of the factors in our model may\nvary among contexts, or, in other words, the causes of school\ndropout may differ depending on the circumstances. For this\nreason, standard solutions often do not work and policy mea-\nsures aimed at improving attainment should be as specific as\npossible. In this article, this specificity is achieved by incor-\nporating interactions in our models. By studying how the\neffects of the risk factors discussed differ according to charac-\nteristics of the context in which the household lives, we can\nmake our model and predictions more situation-specific.\nRegarding the effect of the context in which a child lives\non the chances of staying in school, we expect that favorable\nhousehold conditions, that is, more resources (in terms of\nwealth and education or work status of the parents) or a more\nfavorable household structure, will compensate children for\ndisadvantageous living conditions. When there are few\nschools available, parents with more resources or motivation\nmight be better able to get and keep their children in school\nThese parents might, for example, arrange transportation\nwhen traveling distances are longer. Huisman and Smits\n(2009) found distance to school to be less important for chil-\ndren from fathers with a non-farm job and working mothers.\nWhen schooling is of low quality, higher educated parents\nmay be better able to help their children with their home-\nwork, or, because they know the school culture, strike the\nright note with the head master in case of problems. Wealthier\nparents might hire a tutor. Children from extended house-\nholds might have grandparents or other relatives who can\nhelp with homework or accompany children to school.\nInteractions might also give us an indication about the\nvalidity of the hypothesis of Heyneman and Loxley (1983).\nThis hypothesis predicts that under the more difficult cir-\ncumstances found in developing countries, school charac-\nteristics would be more important relative to family\nbackground characteristics in explaining educational out-\ncomes of children. This hypothesis has since then been\ntested in many empirical studies (e.g., Baker, Goesling, &\n2010), but the findings are mixed and no definitive conclu-\nsion has been drawn. In the context of our study, it would\nimply that in regions with a lower level of development the\n(positive) effects of a better educational infrastructure are\nstronger than the (positive) effect of a more favorable family\nbackground.\nData and Method\nData\nWe use data derived from the Database Developing World, a\ndata infrastructure in which household-level datasets from\nvarious sources are harmonized, connected, and supple-\nmented with context data (www.datdevworld.org). The data\nused for this article are from Demographic and Health\nSurveys (DHS) and the Pan Arab Project for Family Health\n(PAPFAM) of the League of Arab States. We used data for\nthe 30 countries (26 DHS and 4 PAPFAM) for which also\ninformation on educational facilities at the district level was\navailable.\naged 12 to 15. For 7 countries (Bolivia, Colombia, India,\nIndonesia, Malawi, Peru, Philippines), a random sample of\nhouseholds was taken because the datasets were dispropor-\ntionately big. The household-level information of the chil-\ndren was supplemented with context information for the 363\ndistricts and 30 countries in which the children live. District-\nlevel information was partly obtained by aggregating from\nthe household surveys. This was possible because the sur-\nveys involve large samples and have a variable indicating the\ndistrict in which children live. Information on educational\nfacilities at the district level was derived from administrative\nsources. Detailed information on the data, including the\nsource and year of the surveys and the administrative data,\ncan be found in the appendix.\n6 SAGE Open\nMethod\nThe effects of the family background, district and national-\nlevel factors on staying in school are studied using multi-\nlevel discrete-time hazard models (Omariba & Boyle, 2007;\nYamaguchi, 1991). These models deal correctly with right-\ncensoring while taking the clustering of households within\ndistricts and countries into account (Snijders & Bosker,\n1999). The district and country differences in educational\ndropout are dealt with by estimating random intercepts at the\ndistrict and national level. This can be represented by a\nmodel with a binary response y\nijk\n(staying in school or not)\nfor child-grade i in district j of country k of the form: \nijk\n: y\nijk\n~ Bernoulli (l, \nijk\n), with \nijk\ngiven by the following\nequation:\nlog log\nit ijk\nijk\nijk\nijk ijk jk jk k\n\n\n   \n( ) =\n-\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= + + +\n\nk jk k\n+ +\nu v\nIn this equation, \nrepresents the mean log odds of stay-\ning in school versus dropping out for a specific child grade\nacross the sample. X\nijk\n, W\njk\n, and Z\nk\nrepresent vectors of house-\nhold, district, and country-level independent variables,\nrespectively. The parameters u\nand v\nrepresent the ran-\ndom differentials from the overall mean at the district and the\ncountry levels. In all analyses, robust standard errors (sand-\nwich estimators) are used.\nThe children included in our analyses were aged 12 to 15\nat the time of the interview and had completed at least one\ngrade. The upper age limit was put at 15 because we only\nhave parental information for children who still live with\ntheir parents. Each child was represented in the data by one\nor more child-grade records or spells. Children are repre-\nsented up to the year of survey or the grade they dropped out.\nFor example, a child who dropped out after completing\nGrade 5 is represented 5 times in the database. The child-\ngrade records were constructed on the basis of the informa-\ntion on the number of grades the children had completed at\nthe time of the interview. The total number of child-grade\nThe age of the children in a specific grade is not exactly\nknown, because we do not know at which age they started\nprimary education or whether they repeated or skipped\ngrades. However, we know exactly how many grades of\nevery level the children had completed at the time of the\ninterview. Our outcomes, therefore, give a better picture of\nschool dropout in a given grade than at a given age.\nTo test whether the effects of the explanatory variables dif-\nfer between boys and girls, we computed interactions between\nall variables and sex. If the interaction was significant, sepa-\nrate coefficients for boys and girls were estimated. To make\nour findings more situation-specific, we also estimated mod-\nels with interactions among various relevant context factors\n(educational facilities, urbanization, level of development)\nand between these factors and the household-level variables.\nTo compute the interaction terms, centered versions of the\ninvolved variables are used. The main effects therefore can\nbe interpreted as average effects. Given the large number of\npossible interactions, only significant interaction effects are\nincluded in our final models.\nVariables\nHousehold-Level Variables\nFather's occupation is measured as (1) farm, (2) lower non-\nfarm (manual, sales, and service jobs), and (3) upper non-\nfarm (professional, managerial, technical, and clerical).\nEmployment of the mother is measured by a dummy indicat-\ning whether (1) or not (0) she was gainfully employed.\nFather's education is measured with three categories: (1)\nnone, (2) at least some primary, and (3) at least some second-\nary. Given the very low levels of education of most mothers\nin the countries under study, their education is measured with\na dummy indicating whether (1) or not (0) she has at least\nsome primary education.\nHousehold wealth is used as a proxy for income and is\nmeasured by an index constructed on the basis of household\nassets and housing characteristics. Using a method devel-\noped by Filmer and Pritchett (1999), all households within a\ncountry are ranked based on the available assets and divided\ninto wealth deciles. For living in a rural area, a dummy is\nused indicating whether (1) or not (0) the area where the\nhousehold lived was defined \"rural\" in the surveys.\nPresence of parents is measured with two dummies indi-\ncating whether (1) or not (0) the mother or father is missing\nfrom the household. Extended household structure is mea-\nsured with three categories: (0) nuclear family, (1) more than\ntwo adults in the household but no grandparents, (2) more\nthan two adults in the household, including grandparents.\nWhether the child is a biological child is measured by a\ndummy, with (0) for foster, adopted, or unrelated children\nand (1) for biological children. Birth order and number of\nsisters and brothers are measured with interval variables. Sex\nof the child is measured as (0) for boys and (1) for girls. To\nget a rough indication of the strength of a woman's position\nwithin the household, we included a dummy showing\nwhether (1) or not (0) the mother had her first child below\nage 18. To test whether dropout is higher directly after com-\npleting primary education, we included a dummy indicating\nwhether (1) or not (0) the previous grade was the highest\ngrade of primary education in the national educational\nsystem.\nChildren with a missing parent were given the mean score\nof the other children in the database on the variables indicat-\ning characteristics of the parents. Because there are dummies\nfor missing mother or father in the model, this procedure\nleads to unbiased estimates of these variables (Allison, 2001).\nFor children with mothers younger than 16 or older than 49,\ninformation on occupation of the father, employment of the\nHuisman and Smits 7\nmother, and the age at which the mother had her first child\nwas not available in the DHS. To be able to include those\nchildren in the analyses, we gave them on these variables the\naverage of the children for whom information was available,\nand we included a dummy indicating whether (1) or not (0)\nthe respective variable was missing from the database. To\nfind out whether the coefficients of the other variables were\nbiased by this procedure, two robustness tests were per-\nformed. First, the models were reestimated after (separately)\nremoving the variables for father's occupation, mother's\nemployment, and age at which the mother had her first child.\nSecond, the models were reestimated after removing the\nchildren with missings on these variables. Both tests showed\nthat the way we handled these missings hardly influenced\nour results.\nContext Variables\nThe characteristics of the local educational facilities were\nmeasured with four variables. School availability in the dis-\ntrict was indicated by the area served per school, measured\nby dividing the number of square kilometers in a district by\nthe number of primary schools in that district. We used the\nsquare root of this variable to address the fact that in well-\nserved areas, an additional school makes less of a difference.\nBecause availability is likely to be only a problem in the rural\nareas, we included an interaction between this variable and\nurbanization. The interaction term is defined in such a way\nthat the coefficient of availability in our tables represents the\neffect in rural areas. The Teacher Child Ratio is computed by\ntaking the number of secondary school teachers per 1,000\nchildren aged 10 to 19 in the district. Availability of female\nteachers was measured by the percentage of female second-\nary school teachers in the district. For the duration of primary\neducation, we included a national-level variable indicating\nthe legal duration of primary education in years (derived\nfrom InternationalAssociation of Universities, 2009).As this\nvariable is expected to reduce dropout only at the higher lev-\nels of primary education, we also included an interaction\nbetween this variable and the grade a child is in.\nData for schools and teachers are for public and private\nschool combined, except for Benin, Bolivia, Mozambique,\nand Senegal. For Benin, only public data were available. For\nBolivia, the percentage of private teachers was lacking at the\ndistrict level. We therefore took the average of the percent-\nages of private pupils and private schools in the district. For\nMozambique data for public schools and for Senegal data for\npublic teachers were used because no private data were\navailable for these countries. For six countries (Colombia,\nPeru, Congo Brazzaville, Madagascar, Namibia, and\nBangladesh), the percentage of female teachers was not avail-\nable at the district level; therefore, national figures were used.\nFor part of the countries, the year of the household survey\ndiffered from the year for which data regarding schools and\nteachers were available. To test whether this might influence\nour results, we added a variable indicating the difference\nbetween the survey year and the school characteristics year\nto our models. This variable proved to be non-significant in\nall our analyses.\nThe labor market opportunities in the district are indicated\nby the percentage of men working in a white-collar (profes-\nsional, technical, managerial, clerical) occupation. District\nlevel of development is measured by an index constructed on\nthe basis of six variables aggregated from our household\ndatasets: the percentages of households in the district with a\nfridge, car, telephone, television, electricity, or running\nwater. Of these characteristics, the mean was taken of the\nstandardized values. National development is measured by\nnational gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in\nPurchasing Power Parity (constant 2,000 international dol-\nlar) derived from The World Bank (2009).\nCultural issues related to gender are measured with two\ndistrict variables. To indicate the degree to which women are\ndisadvantaged, we use the absolute difference between the\npercentages of men and women working in a white-collar\njob. To indicate the degree to which women in the district\nafter their marriage come to live in the families of their hus-\nbands, we use the percentage of married couples living in a\nhousehold where also parents from father's side are living.\nResults\nTable 1 shows that in almost all countries, the percentage of\nchildren in school at time of survey was low at age 7, then\nincreased until it reached its highest level in the 10 to 12 age\ngroup, after which it decreased again. In most countries, par-\nticipation rates at age 15 are substantially lower than at age\n12, thus revealing high dropout rates. The low participation\nrates at age 7 make clear that in the countries included in our\nstudy, quite a few children start school later than legally\nobliged. Hence, besides non-enrollment and dropout, start-\ning late is a problem. In most countries (16 of the 30) a higher\npercentage of girls than boys is in schools at age 7. As chil-\ndren get older, the percentage of boys in school becomes\nhigher than that of girls in ever more countries.\nTable 2 shows the results of the discrete-time event-his-\ntory analyses. Model 1 contains only coefficients of the main\neffects. Model 2 is similar to Model 1 but with the significant\ninteraction effects added. To keep the table readable, the\ninteraction coefficients are presented separately in Table 3.\nWe present multiplicative coefficients because these are\nmost easily understood. For example, the value of 2.68 for\nthe effect of father having at least some secondary education\nmeans that the odds of staying in school are 2.68 times (or\n168%) higher for children (girls and boys) whose father has at\nleast some secondary education compared with children\nwhose father has no education. The value of 0.95 for girls\nwhose mother is working indicates that these girls have 0.95\ntimes (or 5%) lower odds of staying in school than girls whose\nmother is not working. For those variables that interacted\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Hence, differences among households are\nresponsible for almost three quarter of differences in educa-\ntional participation.\nEffects of the household and contextual resources are\nlargely as expected. Father's and mother's education, father's\noccupation being upper non-farm and household wealth have\nsignificant positive coefficients. The effect of mother's edu-\ncation is stronger for girls, which is in line with earlier find-\nings (Emerson & Portela Souza, 2007). Mother's employment\nhas no significant average effect on staying in school, but\nthis effect is significantly more favorable for boys.\nIf there are more teachers available, as indicated by a\nhigher teacher child ratio, chances that children stay in school\nincrease significantly. The average effect of a higher propor-\ntion of female teachers in the district is not significant,\nalthough its effect is positive for girls. In earlier research\n(Huisman & Smits, 2009), a higher percentage of female\nteachers was found to promote girls' participation in primary\neducation. Hence, female teachers seem to be more impor-\ntant for getting young girls into school than for keeping them\nthere. With regard to the availability of schools in rural areas,\nwe find a significantly negative association between the size\nof the area served by schools and girls staying in school. For\nboys, availability seems to be less of a problem.\nRegarding the effects of structural factors, we see that\nwhen a father or mother is missing from the household, the\nlikelihood of staying in school is significantly reduced. The\nnegative effect of a missing mother is stronger for girls.\nLiving in an extended household with grandparents, being a\nbiological or a later-born child have significant positive asso-\nciations with a child staying in school, whereas having more\nsiblings is negative for all children. The availability of white-\ncollar jobs in the district is associated with a significant\nincrease in both boys' and girls' likelihood to stay in school.\nRegarding the role of the local culture, we observe that\nhaving a more traditional mother, as indicated by the age she\nhad her first child, is negative for all children. Living in a\npatriarchal culture, as indicated by a higher percentage of\nhouseholds with parents of the father, is not significant. For\ngirls, the effect of living in a district where the gender differ-\nence in the higher echelon of the labor market is wider is\nnegative, but this effect is not significant. These two vari-\nables were significant when tested bivariately, indicating that\nmore patriarchal districts tend to differ with regard to other\nfactors in the model that affect children's chances to stay in\nschool.\nUrbanization and national GDP per capita show signifi-\ncant effects in the expected direction. The odds of staying in\nschool are higher in countries with higher levels of GDP per\ncapita and--for girls--also in urban areas (Model 2).\nHowever, the effect of our other variable which indicates a\nmore modern context in which education might be valued\nhigher, the district development index, is significantly\n Southern Africa\nMENA\n South and East Asia\nSource.

This may seem\ncounterintuitive. However, bivariately this variable showed\nthe expected positive effect. Hence, the negative multivari-\nate effect is the result of controlling for other development-\nrelated factors.\nAs could be expected, children drop out significantly\nmore in the higher grades. They also have a substantially\nhigher likelihood of dropping out directly after finishing pri-\nmary school. This last effect seems to be stronger than that of\nany other factor in the model. We also see that dropout in the\nhigher grades is lower in countries where the legal duration\nof primary education is longer. Both findings are in line with\nthe idea that children (and their parents) tend to wait until\nthey have completed primary education before they stop\nschooling.\nInteraction Effects\nTable 3 presents the coefficients of significant interactions.\nThe likelihood to continue school directly after finishing pri-\nmary school is increased for boys from extended households\nwith grandparents. This indicates that grandparents consider\nsecondary education for their grandsons important and are\nprepared to take over tasks or help with homework to facili-\ntate that. Directly after completing primary education, the\neffects of father's occupation and education are significantly\nreduced. Hence, at that time, the decision to drop out seems\nless influenced by socioeconomic differences than at other\npoints in the school career.\nWith the teacher\u00adchild ratio, we find one significant inter-\naction. The positive effect of this factor is stronger in countries\nTable 3.

This finding runs opposite to\nthe idea of, for instance, Heyneman and Loxley that in less\ndeveloped countries the impact of schools and teachers is\nstronger. The significant positive effect of female teachers in\nrural areas, in contrast, is in line with their idea. Hence,\nincreasing the number of female teachers might reduce rural\ndropout (which is especially strong for girls). In districts\nwith a higher percentage of female teachers, the positive\neffects of father's occupation and household wealth are\nhigher. This indicates that girls from such households (for\nwhom the effect of female teachers is positive) are better able\nto profit from these favorable educational circumstances,\nleading to a kind of accumulation of positive effects.\nHowever for boys, such household conditions compensate\nthem for the negative effect that female teachers have for\nthem. Moreover, in those districts the negative effect of more\nbrothers is stronger for boys, pointing toward competition\nwithin the household. We also found that in districts with a\nhigher percentage of female teachers, the tendency to drop\nout in the higher grades increases. Hence, older children and\nchildren from households with more competition and fewer\nresources seem to profit less from the presence of female\nteachers.\nMost interactions with urbanization are as expected. In\nrural areas, children from extended households with grand-\nparents and biological daughters are more likely to stay in\nschool. Thus in rural areas, there seem to be more duties at\nhome that can be taken over by grandparents or put on the\nshoulders of foster daughters. The negative effects of more\nsiblings and a mother who got her first child young are also\nstronger in rural areas. This is in line with the idea that in\nurban areas educational facilities are more accessible, so that\nchildren from more difficult or competitive backgrounds\nhave more possibilities to go to school. The negative effect\nof the presence of (more) sisters for boys in rural areas might\nas well be interpreted as meaning that boys in cities profit\nfrom the presence of sisters.\nIn more developed districts, a missing father has a stron-\nger negative effect, whereas for boys the effect of a father\nwith an upper non-farm job becomes less positive. However,\nthe effect of paternal education in those districts becomes\neven more important, which might be interpreted as support\nfor Heyneman and Loxley's idea that when the level of\ndevelopment is higher, family background characteristics are\nmore important. In countries with a higher GDP per capita,\nliving in an extended household with grandparents is less\nimportant.\nConclusion\nWe studied effects of household and district-level factors on\nschool dropout of young children in the first years of the 21th\ncentury by applying multi-level discrete-time event-history\n30 developing countries. We tested four hypotheses: (a) The\nresource hypothesis predicts that children from households\nand contexts with more resources available for schooling are\nless likely to drop out of school; (b) the structure hypothesis\npredicts that in households and contexts where the structure is\nsuch that children can benefit more from the available\nresources and from going to school, children are less likely to\ndrop out of school; (c) the culture hypothesis predicts that if\nthe local culture is such that education is valued more relative\nto other options, children are less likely to drop out of school;\n(d) the primary duration hypothesis predicts that children are\nmore likely to drop out after finishing a specific level. Besides\ndirect effects of the determining factors, we studied interac-\ntion effects to make our study more situation-specific.\nRegarding the attendance rates by age, our descriptive\nanalysis reveals two major patterns. First, in almost all of the\ncountries children tend to start schooling at an age that is\n(often substantially) higher than the legal starting age of pri-\nmary education. Second, participation rates are highest in the\n9 to 12 age group, and then start to decrease. In most coun-\ntries, participation rates at age 15 are substantially lower than\nthose at age 12, thus revealing high dropout rates.\nWith respect to the determinants of school dropout, we\nfind that children from households and contexts with more\nresources are much more likely to stay in school, supporting\nour first hypothesis. Higher educated parents, a wealthier\nhousehold, and a father with a higher-level job are strongly\npositively associated with children staying in school. Parental\neducation and household wealth are most important. If the\nfather has more than primary education, the odds of staying in\nschool for both girls and boys are 157% higher than if the father\nhas no education, and if the household is in a one-step higher\nwealth decile, this odds increases by 20%. Mother's education\nis especially important. The odds of staying in school increases\nby 77% for daughters and by 40% for sons if the mother is in\nthe higher educational category. This result indicates that moth-\ners with more knowledge are in a better position to keep their\nchildren in school. This knowledge probably need not be very\nextensive; we only distinguished between none and at least\nsome education. Given the substantial difference in school\ndropout found with this simple variable, it seems that basic\nskills such as reading and writing are critical.\nDistrict availability of teachers (indicated by a higher\nteacher child ratio) is associated with a significant positive\neffect on a child's likelihood to stay in school, and district\navailability of schools in rural areas is positive for girls. The\npercentage of female teachers is not associated with a signifi-\ncant average effect on staying in school, but interactions\nshow a significantly positive association in rural areas.\nHence, female teachers seem particularly important under\nmore difficult circumstances. In addition, children in lower\ngrades drop out significantly less if there are more female\nteachers.\nWe also find support for our second hypothesis on the\neffect of structural characteristics of households and contexts.\nChildren from households with a structure which is less\nHuisman and Smits 13\nfavorable for them, that is, children with more siblings, chil-\ndren who have younger siblings, and children whose mother\nor father is missing from the household, are significantly less\nlikely to stay in school. The effect of a missing mother is\nstronger for girls. However, living in an extended household\nwith grandparents and being a biological child are associated\nwith a higher likelihood to stay in school, whereby grandpar-\nents are especially important in poorer countries as indicated\nby our interaction results. Also a structural context in which\neducation is more valuable, because it makes it more likely\nto find a higher paid occupation, as indicated by a higher\npercentage of men with a white-collar job, is associated with\na higher likelihood of children staying in school.\nThe results regarding our third hypothesis on culture are\nless convincing. Having a mother who got her first child at a\nyoung age, an indication of a more traditional household, is\nnot significant. Also the effect of the district-level variables\nmeasuring the gender difference on the labor market and the\ntendency for girls to marry into their husband's family are\nnot significant, suggesting that variation in school dropout\nbetween more and less traditional districts is largely due to\nvariation in other household and district characteristics. A\nhigher national GDP per capita, and for girls also living in an\nurban area are positively associated with staying in school,\nindicating that in a more developed environment education is\nmore valued as we hypothesized. However, the district\ndevelopment index (constructed based on assets of house-\nholds in the district) was negatively associated with staying\nin school. This might mean that developed districts have bet-\nter income-earning opportunities for children, so that child\nlabor would be an attractive alternative.\nRegarding the fourth hypothesis of this study, about the\neffect of extending the duration of primary education on\nschool dropout, several pieces of evidence are relevant. First,\nwe found that in countries where the legal duration of pri-\nmary education is longer, dropout in the higher grades is sig-\nnificantly lower. Second, the odds of continuing schooling\nwere strongly reduced (about 70%) directly after finishing\nprimary education. The magnitude of this effect is larger than\nthat of any other variable in the model, stressing its impor-\ntance. Third, the increased risk of school dropout after com-\npleting primary education was independent of the number of\ngrades the child had completed (no significant interaction\nbetween grade and having recently finished primary educa-\ntion). Together, these pieces of evidence clearly indicate that\ndirectly after completing primary education there is a critical\nchoice moment with a strongly elevated risk of dropping out\nof the educational system.\nThis risk moreover seems not restricted to the lower lev-\nels of society. Our interaction analysis makes clear that right\nafter finishing primary education, the advantage of having a\nfather with an upper non-farm job or with at least some pri-\nmary education is significantly reduced. Hence, the tendency\nto drop out of school after completing primary education is\nnot restricted to households with the fewest resources. Only\nchildren in households with grandparents, especially boys,\nare less likely to drop out of school after finishing primary\neducation, thus stressing the importance of this form of fam-\nily capital for educational achievement in poor countries.\nGiven these findings, it seems advisable for countries with\nhigh dropout rates of young children to consider prolonging\nthe legal duration of primary education (as was done in\nTurkey in 1998) as a policy to keep children in school longer.\nOf course, such a policy may make a heavy demand on the\navailable primary school facilities and requires a transfer of\nmeans from the lower secondary to the primary level.\nRegarding the other interactions we conducted to make our\nanalyses more situation-specific, we find that children who\nwere already in a more favorable situation (higher wealth\ngroup, father with a higher education, girls with a father with\na non-farm occupation, extended households, biological\ndaughters, fewer siblings, a mother who did not have her first\nchild young) profit more from the availability of female teach-\ners, or are less affected by living in a rural or less developed\narea. The evidence is not conclusive, however, as we also\nfound that in better developed districts, the advantage of the\nfather being present in the household and advantage of having\na father with an upper non-farm job are less important.\nThe finding that female teachers are especially important\nin rural areas provides support for the Heyneman\u00adLoxley\nhypothesis that educational facilities make more difference\nat lower development levels. Only the stronger effect of the\nteacher\u00adchild ratio in higher GDP countries is not in line\nwith this hypothesis.\nSome words of caution are needed. First, although the use\nof context factors at the district level is a major step forward\ncompared with research using such factors at the national\nlevel, the degree to which they represent the local context\nremains restricted, because the districts are still rather big.As\na result, our coefficients may underestimate the true effects.\nSecond, some additional measurement error might be\nexpected in the district-level characteristics of the educa-\ntional facilities, because they had to be collected from other\nsources, which for developing countries are not always of\ngood quality. District characteristics that we created our-\nselves by aggregating from our representative household sur-\nveys are more reliable. Third, for children who dropped out\nof school, we do not have reliable information on the age at\nwhich this happened. Hence, our conclusions are mainly\nvalid for dropping out in specific grades and not for dropping\nout at a specific age. Fourth, the substantial number of sig-\nnificant cross-level interactions found in our analyses con-\nfirms our expectation that the processes underlying the\ndecision to drop out may differ substantially among contexts.\nAt the same time, it is difficult to give clear interpretations\nfor the outcomes of the interaction analysis, which not\nalways point clearly to one direction. New theories on the\nrole of the context are therefore needed, the development of\nwhich constitutes a major challenge to the research commu-\nnity in this field.\nAppendix: Overview of data used in this study\nResponse rate\nHousehold survey\nSource and year\nHousehold\nsurvey\nWomen's\nsurvey\nEducational facilities: year of data\nSource\nSchools\nof data\nTeachers\nWorld region Country\nNr. of\ndistricts Schools Teachers\nFemale\nteachers\nNote. 1 = National Ministry of Education; 2 = National bureau of Statistics; 3 = Education Policy & Data Centre (www.epdc.org).
