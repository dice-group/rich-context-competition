The aim of this study was to examine the association\nof (changes in) self-care with HRQOL while adjusting for psychological distress.\nMethods: In total, 459 patients (mean age = 66.1\u00b110.5 years, 73% male) with chronic HF completed questionnaires at\nbaseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months of follow-up. Self-care and HF-specific HRQOL were quantified with the European\nHeart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire.\nResults: Using general linear models, multivariable between-subject (estimate=\u00ad0.14, p=0.005) and no within-subject\neffects of self-care were found for better HRQOL over time. Associations between self-care and HRQOL were\nfully explained by depression (estimate\n=\n<\n(estimate=13.3, p<0.001) were associated with poor HRQOL, but only partially accounted for the relationship between\nself-care and emotional HRQOL.\nConclusions: Self-care was prospectively associated with better disease-specific HRQOL in patients with HF, which\nwas fully accounted for by depression, and partially accounted for by anxiety and Type D personality. Changes in self-\ncare within a person did not affect HRQOL. Psychological distress should be considered in future efforts to address\nself-care and HRQOL.\n",

However, findings from\nprevious, primarily cross-sectional and small studies have\nyielded inconsistent results,11\u00ad14 also when examining the\neffects of self-care interventions on HRQOL.15 We there-\nfore investigated the longitudinal association of HF self-\ncare and HRQOL in a large cohort of patients with chronic\nHF. We extend previous work by examining whether dif-\nferences in self-care within and between patients were\nrelated to HRQOL over time. Furthermore, as psychologi-\ncal distress adversely relates to HRQOL,7,11 we explored\nwhether depression, anxiety and Type D personality\nexplained potential relationships between self-care and\nMethods\nPatients and procedure\nThis study is part of the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Heart\nFailure Cohort Study. Consecutive patients attending the\noutpatient HF clinic of the Elisabeth-TweeSteden teach-\ning hospital (Tilburg, The Netherlands) were approached\nfor participation in a longitudinal study with five meas-\nurement occasions over a total follow-up period of 18\nmonths.16,17 Exclusion criteria comprised: diastolic HF;\nage 80 years; a myocardial infarction or hospitalisa-\ntion in the month prior to inclusion; a life-threatening\ndisease with a life expectancy <1 year; serious psychiat-\nric illness except for mood disorders; or insufficient\nunderstanding of and fluency in the Dutch language.\nPatients were informed about the study and recruited by\ntheir cardiologist or specialised HF nurse. If patients\nagreed to participate, they were called in the same week\nto arrange a baseline appointment. At baseline, patients\ncompleted a psychological survey at home, which was\nreturned in a self-addressed envelope. At 6, 12 and 18\nmonths of follow-up, patients were contacted to com-\nplete the psychological survey again. In case of missing\nitems, patients were contacted by phone or email in an\nattempt to obtain the missing answers. If the question-\nnaire was not returned within 2 weeks, patients received\na reminder telephone call or letter. Of 570 eligible\nreturned the baseline questionnaire. Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all patients. The study proto-\ncol was approved by the institutional medical ethics\nreview boards of all participating hospitals.\nMeasures\nSelf-care. The nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care\nBehaviour scale (EHFScB-9)18 was administered in order\nto assess self-care at baseline and 6, 12 and 18 months of\nfollow-up. Items were rated on a five-point Likert scale\nfrom 1 (`I completely agree') to 5 (`I completely disa-\ngree'). To calculate sum scores, item scores were reversed,\nwith a possible range of 9\u00ad45. Raw sum scores were trans-\nformed into standardised scores from 0 to 100, with higher\nscores reflecting better self-care.19 This includes a four-\nitem `consulting behaviour' subscale that measures\nwhether patients contact their physician in case of a sud-\nden increase of the following symptoms: shortness of\nbreath, ankle swelling, weight gain or fatigue. The remain-\ning items assess how patients judge their adherence to the\nmost commonly recommended self-care behaviours: daily\nweight monitoring, limiting fluids, low-sodium diet, regu-\nlar exercise and medication adherence. The internal con-\nsistency of the total self-care and its consultation scale\nwere acceptable (Cronbach's  = 0.79) and good (Cron-\nbach's  = 0.87) at baseline, respectively. For descriptive\nstatistical purposes, we split the person-mean of self-care\n(i.e. an individual's self-care scores averaged over all time\npoints) at the median in order to denote low and high self-\ncare, as there are no well-validated cut-off values pub-\nlished in the literature.\nHealth-related quality of life.The Minnesota Living with\nHeart Failure (MLWHF) questionnaire was administered\nin order to assess HF-specific HRQOLat all time points.20,21\nThe MLWHF is designed to assess the effects of HF symp-\ntoms, functional limitations and psychological distress on\nthe patient's quality of life. Twenty-one items are answered\non a six-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5. Higher\nscores indicate worse HF-specific HRQOL, with a differ-\nence of five denoting a clinically relevant change.22 This\nprovides a total score that includes additional social, HF-\nspecific and healthcare-related items, as well as a physical\nand emotional dimensional subscale score.\nDepression.\nThe 21-item Beck Depression Inventory\n(BDI)23 was used in order to assess depressive symptoma-\ntology. This is a well-validated self-report measure and has\nbeen found to be reliable for measuring depressive symp-\ntomatology in patients with chronic HF.24 Each item is\nrated on a 0\u00ad3 scale. A total score is obtained by the sum of\nall items. We performed three assessments of depressive\nsymptoms at baseline and at the 12- and 18-month follow-\nup visits. Internal consistency was good at all three meas-\nAnxiety. Symptoms of anxiety were assessed with the two\nanxiety items (i.e. tension and restlessness) of the Symp-\ntoms of Anxiety\u00adDepression index (SAD4\n), which has\nbeen shown to detect an increased risk of anxiety disorder\nin cardiac patients.25 Items are answered on a five-point\nLikert scale with a range from 0 (`not at all') to 4 (`very\nmuch'). The internal consistency was high in this study\nType D personality. The 14-item Type D Scale (DS14) was\nused in order to assess Type D personality,26 which is\ndefined as the combination of the negative affectivity\n(NA) and social inhibition (SI) personality traits. Individ-\nuals with a Type D personality tend to experience negative\nemotions across time and situations, and have the ten-\ndency of not expressing themselves in social interactions\nbecause of fear of rejection or disapproval by others. Type\nD personality has been shown to independently predict\nHRQOL27 and self-care28 in patients with HF. Items are\nanswered on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0\n(`false') to 4 (`true'). The DS14 consists of two seven-\nitem subscales \u00ad NA and SI \u00ad which are time-stable and\nthe current study, Cronbach's  was .87 for NA and .84 for\nSI. The standardised cut-off score of 10 on both sub-\nscales was used in order to classify individuals with a\nType D personality.26\nSociodemographic and clinical covariates\nWe included demographics (i.e. age, gender, educational\nlevel and living alone), cardiac history and comorbidities.\nWe dichotomised education into two groups (i.e. 8 years or\nless vs. more than 8 years) for presentation purposes. We\ndid not include New York Heart Association (NYHA)\nfunctional class, as its criteria largely overlap with the\nitems of the MLWHF questionnaire. Left ventricular ejec-\ntion fraction (LVEF) was also not included as a covariate\nbecause the majority of studies have found no association\nStatistical analysis\nWe examined the course of total, physical and emotional\nHRQOL over all measurement occasions using pairwise\ncomparisons. We stratified the course of HRQOL for\nabove- and below-median levels of total self-care. In\norder to analyse the effects of the level (between sub-\njects) and change (within subjects) of self-care over time\non the course of HRQOL, we conducted linear mixed\nmodelling analyses (using maximum likelihood [ML]\nestimation and an unstructured covariance matrix). To\nthis end, we calculated the person-mean of self-care over\nthe measurement occasions in order to address a between-\nsubjects effect. Then, we calculated the deviations from\nthis person-mean at each time point in order to obtain\ninformation on the person-specific change in self-care so\nas to address within-subjects effects. These two variables\nconstituted our independent variables.\nThree separate analyses were performed for total,\nphysical and emotional HRQOL as outcome measures.\nSeparate analyses were performed for total self-care and\nfor the consultation behaviour subscale.13 In step 1, the\nself-care variables (person-mean and deviation) were\nentered (unadjusted model). In step 2, we adjusted the\nmodels for demographic and clinical covariates. In a final\nstep, we separately added depression, anxiety and Type D\npersonality. All illness-related and psychological covari-\nates were time-varying, except for demographic variables\nand Type D personality. Estimates were reported, which\nrepresent the non-standardised regression coefficients of\nthe dependent variable when the independent variable\nincreases by one unit. Analyses were performed with\nSPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics for\nWindows, version 20.0; Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. USA).\nTests were two-tailed with a p-value <\nstatistical significance.\nResults\nSample characteristics\nBaseline characteristics are presented in Table 1.\nPatients with below-median scores of total self-care\nreceived less education. They demonstrated less favour-\nable health behaviours (reduced physical activity and\nhigher body mass index). The below-median self-care\npatients more often had a cardiac history. Angiotensin-\nrelated medication and loop diuretics were less likely to\nbe prescribed to the below-median self-care group.\nThose who were low in self-care reported increased\nsymptoms of depression and anxiety. There were some\ntrend associations as well, suggesting that the below-\nmedian self-care patients lived alone a bit more often.\nThey also tended to have larger comorbidity burdens, as\nwell as fewer implanted cardioverter defibrillators or\npacemakers. Type D personality tended to be more\nprevalent in the low self-care group, although this was\nnot a significant difference (p=0.08).\nAttrition\ndropped out at the 12-month measurement occasion,\nwhile another 20 patients (4%; of whom seven were\ndeceased) dropped out at the 18-month measurement\noccasion. Patients who dropped out were more likely to\nhave a worse illness severity (NYHA class III, 2 = 12.1,\np\n=\nmore likely to have an elevated Charlson Comorbidity\ndifferences at earlier measurement occasions). There\nwere no differences in self-care between completers and\ndropouts.

At 1 year, HRQOL tended to be better than at 6\nmonths (p\n=\nsignificantly different from HRQOL at the 12-month fol-\nlow-up. Average differences were smaller than five points\n(between 1.6 and 3.0). Physical and emotional subscale\n<\n0.001, respectively), although the pattern of\ndifferences was different. Physical HRQOL had a wave\nform, with patients doing better at 1year of follow-up and\nmoving back towards baseline levels at 18months of fol-\nlow-up. Emotional HRQOL was worse at baseline com-\npared to at all three other follow-up occasions.\nMore patients in the above-median self-care group\n(42%) showed a clinically relevant improvement in\nHRQOL of five points or more over the first 6 months\ncompared to the below-median self-care group (32%),\nwhich included a larger number of patients who signifi-\nwere more deteriorating patients in the low self-care group\n(31% vs. 22%). The percentage of improving patients was\nequal for low and high self-care groups. At 18 months, the\ndifferences between low and high self-care groups altered,\nTable 1.

The\nresults showed a significant between-subjects effect of\n<\nmates of the individual parameters, representing\nnon-standardised regression coefficients of the dependent\nvariable when the independent variable increases by one\nunit. Better mean self-care was associated with better\nHRQOL over time, while within-person variation in self-\ncare across time was unrelated to the level of HRQOL\nacross time. After adjusting for established covariates\n(step 2), the relationship between self-care and HRQOL\nremained similar. Low education level was a significant\npredictor of worse HRQOL. In the third and final step, we\nincluded psychological distress in three different sub-\nmodels for depression, anxiety and Type D personality. All\nthree psychological distress variables were strongly related\nto total HRQOL. Examining the difference in self-care\nestimates between models 2 and 3 would give an indica-\ntion of how much of the effect of self-care on HRQOL\ncould be explained by psychological stress. Depression\nshared almost all variance with self-care, as the estimate\nfor the grand mean of self-care (between subjects) was\nreduced to nearly zero. Anxiety overlapped partly with\nself-care in explaining variance in HRQOL over time,\nindicating that self-care affected HRQOL independently of\nanxiety. Type D personality overlapped the least with self-\ncare in explaining variance in HRQOL over time, with the\nestimate of self-care largely remaining similar to the esti-\nmate in the prior step.\nThe physical and emotional subcomponents were less\nstrongly related to self-care than the total score (Table 2).\nIn unadjusted analyses, between-subject differences in\nself-care were significantly related to difference in physi-\ncal and emotional HRQOL over time. This effect disap-\npeared for emotional HRQOL in adjusted analyses. Low\neducation level and a larger comorbidity burden were both\nrelated to poorer physical but not emotional HRQOL. It\nwas shown that psychological distress was strongly related\nto poorer physical and emotional HRQOL. Higher self-\ncare remained a predictor for better physical HRQOL\nwhen anxiety and Type D personality were included. Self-\ncare no longer predicted emotional HRQOL when psycho-\nlogical distress variables were included.\nConsultation behaviour and HRQOL\nResults were similar for consultation behaviour. We found\na main effect of between-subject differences (F=16.74,\np\n<\n0.001), but no within-subject effects on consultation\n=\n0.26). These main effects were\np\n=\n=\nFigure 1.

When consider-\ning psychological distress, poorer consultation behaviour\nremained a predictor for poorer HRQOL when anxiety and\nType D personality were included. Depression reduced the\neffect of consultation behaviour to a non-significant level.\nWith respect to the physical and emotional subcompo-\nnents, similar patterns appeared as were observed for total\nself-care.\nDiscussion\nThe current study examined the longitudinal association\nof self-care and HRQOL over a follow-up period of 18\nmonths in a cohort of 459 patients with chronic HF. The\nresults led to two primary conclusions. First, between-\nsubject differences in self-care, but not within-subject\nchanges in self-care, were associated with HRQOL over\ntime. Lower self-care was associated with poorer overall\nHRQOL, as well as its physical and emotional subcompo-\nnents. Associations were robust since they were hardly\naffected by established covariates, and were similar for\ntotal self-care and the consulting for HF symptoms sub-\nscale. Against the background of the inconsistent results\npublished so far, the current study supports the notion that\nHF self-care is prospectively associated with HRQOL.11\u00ad14\nSelf-care was most relevant in terms of total HRQOL,\nwhich involved additional social, HF-specific and health-\ncare-related items in comparison to the physical and emo-\ntional HRQOL subcomponents. This study extends\nprevious work on the impact of psychological factors on\ncardiac disease30 by showing that psychological distress\naffected the relationship between HF self-care and\nHRQOL negatively; either a substantial part or the entire\nrelationship was explained by psychological distress lev-\nels. Depression fully explained the relationship between\nself-care and all HRQOL domains. While anxiety and\nType D personality were related to poor HRQOL, they\nonly explained the relationship between self-care and\nemotional HRQOL. In line with the majority of studies,\npatients who were low in self-care reported higher levels\nof psychological distress.31\nTable 2.

Estimates denote the change in the outcome value when the predictor changes by one unit/point.\nHRQOL: health-related quality of life.\nDepression, anxiety and Type D personality should be\nconsidered in future attempts to address self-care and\nHRQOL. Why depression was more relevant with respect\nto self-care and physical HRQOL may be explained by its\nsomatic\u00adaffective component greatly impacting physical\nfunction through direct and indirect effects. Research\nincreasingly shows that somatic rather than cognitive\ndepressive symptoms are related to poorer cardiovascular\nhealth (e.g. reduced heart rate variability32), as well as\nincreased mortality risk in HF.16 We hypothesise that\nsomatic\u00adaffective symptoms may be of indirect influence\non physical HRQOL, preventing patients from performing\ndaily self-care behaviours. Another reason may be nega-\ntive cognitive bias, which is often present in people with\ndepressive symptoms, leading to poor perceptions of both\nself-care and HRQOL.33\nHRQOL improved over time, but this was not clinically\nsignificant (<5 points). Clinically significant deteriorations\nin HRQOL were observed more often in patients who were\nlow in self-care, especially within the first year of follow-\nup. Against expectations,13 within-person variations in self-\ncare did not relate to changes in HRQOL. Changes in\nself-care within a person may perhaps be necessary in order\nto maintain stable physical and emotional homeostasis,\nwhich may therefore not be reflected in significant changes\nin HRQOL. Further studies are necessary in order to repli-\ncate these results and examine such a mechanism. Predictors\nof poor HRQOL other than self-care were low education\nlevel and increasing CCI, which reflects the burden of\ncomorbid conditions and ageing.\nFurther studies should examine which components of\npsychological distress serve as potential mediators of\nthe relationship between self-care and HRQOL.\nAccumulating studies suggest that specific psychologi-\ncal characteristics or dimensions (e.g. anhedonia or\nsomatic symptoms) of depression are more important\nwith respect to specific facets of self-care31 and\nHRQOL.34 Given the lack of effectiveness of self-care\ninterventions on quality of life,15 interventions that are\ndesigned to improve self-care may have to incorporate\nthe role of psychological distress in order to impact\nHRQOL. This is supported by a meta-analysis showing\nthat face-to-face psychosocial interventions are benefi-\ncial to improving quality of life in chronic HF patients.35\nThere are several limitations of this study. Self-care was\nassessed by means of self-report, which is subject to sys-\ntematic biases and may not reflect actual behaviour.36 It\nwould also have been preferable to use a more extensive\nanxiety measure or interview. The follow-up period of 18\nmonths might have been too short to detect relevant\nTable 3.

Our findings suggest\nthat psychological distress mediates associations between\nself-care and HRQOL. This was not addressed with statis-\ntical methods, as it diverted from the main aim of the study.\nWe had a small percentage of missing data. As mixed lin-\near effects modelling makes use of ML estimation, imputa-\ntion of the missing values was not necessary. Finally, given\nthe observational nature of the study design, no conclu-\nsions can be drawn regarding the causality of these rela-\ntionships. The strengths of this study were its large sample\nsize, its longitudinal design with self-care and HRQOL as\ntime-varying variables and its inclusion of psychological\ndistress. In addition, this is the first study to examine\nwhether changes in self-care within a person were associ-\nated with changes in HRQOL.\nAdvances in cardiovascular treatment have led to better\nsurvival rates. Consequently, the chronicity of HF contin-\nues to increase and the risk for hospitalisation remains\nhigh. Clinicians are challenged to minimise the devastat-\ning effects of HF on HRQOL, possibly through effective\nself-care. This study confirmed that self-care was associ-\nated with HRQOL, but this relationship was greatly\naffected by psychological distress, primarily depression.\nChanges in self-care within a person over time did not con-\ntribute to HRQOL. From a clinical perspective, our results\nemphasise the notion that psychological distress is essen-\ntial to and underlies the relationship between self-care and\nHRQOL. Further research will enable us to gain a better\nunderstanding of the potential psychological and behav-\nioural factors that contribute to overall HRQOL in patients\nwith chronic HF.\nImplications for practice\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Self-care, but not changes in self-care, is associ-\nated with heart failure-related quality of life over\ntime.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Depressive symptoms are most relevant in deter-\nmining worse heart failure-related quality of life.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Minimising psychological distress may benefit\nboth self-care and health-related quality of life.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nfrom the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)\nawarded to Prof Dr Johan Denollet.\nReferences\n1.
