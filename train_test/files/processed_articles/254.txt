This article examines the theoreticalbasisfor such models and the biological rationale oftheir\nparametric structure. Several examples are given.\nIN the past, the event ofhuman mortality and the physiologi-\ncal processes of aging have been viewed as fundamentally\nlinked-so intimately so that mortality and the age at which\ndeath occurs have been viewed as highly reliable and easily\nmeasured proxies for the operation of senescent processes in\nhuman populations (e.g\" reference 1, chapter 7). This linkage is\ncommonly termed \"the age dependence of mortality\" and has\noften been modeled as a Gompertz function (2,3). As the aver-\nage length of life, or life expectancy, increases in many devel-\noped countries, this linkage has weakened, and the biological\nrelevance of specific parameters of the linkage has become less\ncertain. This is not simply due to the increased chance of sur-\nviving to late ages, but also due to our rapidly increasing scien-\ntific knowledge of senescent processes, and the recognition of\ntheir greater than anticipated complexity and \"plasticity\" (4-8),\nPractical breaks in this linkage are also evident in the recog-\nnition by scientists, clinicians, and policy makers of the impor-\ntance of adopting as a primary goal for biomedical research,\nclinical medicine, and public health, increases in the overall\nquality, as well as the quantity, of life. This goal is now also\nrecognized by global health authorities, such as the World\nHealth Organization (WHO), which are placing increased im-\nportance on active-life expectancy as a primary popUlation\nhealth objective for developing and developed countries (9).\nThis view represents a recent and fundamental change in global\nhealth policy perspectives. The earlier WHO Health for All pro-\ngram targets for the year 2000 had, in contrast, emphasized life\nexpectancy, rather than active-life expectancy (10).\nIn recognition of these changes, it is no longer sufficient for\nmodels of population aging to describe only the age and gender\ndistribution of mortality and temporal changes in that distribu-\ntion. More complete models of aging that recognize our grow-\ning knowledge of aging processes, the heterogeneity of those\nprocesses across individuals, and the plasticity of the parame-\nters of those processes are needed. These requirements mean\ndeveloping mathematical representations of aging processes in\nhuman popUlations that are far more general than the mono-\ntonic hazard functions usually employed to describe the age de-\npendence of mortality and that can use direct measurements of\nlongitudinal changes in individuals.\nThe most commonly used model of the age dependence of\nmortality in adult humans was developed by Benjamin\nGompertz in 1825. The Gompertz hazard function has been\nuseful in describing the adult mortality ofhumans from ages 30\nto 85 years (11), and mortality at \"late\" ages for many animal\nspecies (2,3). The model's utility was due both to the frequency\nwith which it successfully described the empirical age depen-\ndency of adult mortality (2) and, more formally, its convenient\nstatistical and mathematical properties as one of three \"extreme\nvalue\" failure distributions, i.e., distributions of times to lethal\nevents which are mathematically consistent with the age-related\noperation ofchronic biological failure (disease) processes in in-\nHowever, as human life expectancy increases, the Gompertz\nhazard function becomes less useful as a population model of\nmortality and aging because it does not describe the age depen-\ndence ofhuman mortality above age 85, nor the extreme upper\ntail of the survival curve in many experimental insect and ani-\nmal populations (13). In humans, the per annum rate ofincrease\nof mortality with age for a given birth cohort slows significantly\nabove age 85 (14). From an extensive series (11 companies) of\ninsurance data, it appears that mortality rates reach a plateau, a\nmaximum constant level, past age 95 with no actuarially credi-\nble evidence of human mortality rates exceeding 50% per\nannum at any higher adult age (15).\nOne reason why the Gompertz function may fail to describe\nhuman mortality at late ages is genetic or environmentally in-\nduced persistent, individual differences in age-specific risks of\ndeath (16). These are strongly expressed when mortality rates\nreach levels that rapidly exhaust high-risk subgroups (17). Even\nif the Gompertz function described the biological dependence\nof mortality on age for individuals, the age trajectory of the av-\nerage mortality risk in a risk-heterogeneous population would\nnot be Gompertz in form if individuals are systematically se-\nlected out of the population by mortality related to risk factors.\nIn a risk-heterogeneous population, the simplest empirically\nsatisfactory model retaining the Gompertz (or related functions\nsuch as the Weibull) hazard function at the individual level has\ntwo components. One is a distribution of individual risk differ-\nences. The other describes the age rate of increase of mortality\nfor an individual (16). Though a hazard model with two fixed\ncomponents may be flexible enough to describe the age depen-\ndence of mortality at late ages (85+), it requires the biologically\nquestionable assumption that all individual risk differences are\nconstant over age (18).\nBoth components of such compound hazard functions repre-\nsent effects of unobserved factors. The hazard component rep-\nresents factors whose effects on mortality are distributed over\nage, but homogeneous over individuals. The distribution of in-\ndividual risk differences, in contrast, is assumed to be age in-\nvariant. These assumptions are sufficient to mathematically\nidentify the parameters of the two hazard components from\nmortality data (i.e., times to death and the age specific popula-\ntions at risk) if the components are independent. To mathemati-\ncally identify the parameters of a model where individual risk\ndifferences change with age, and to make precise statistical esti-\nmates of parameters, however, requires data on changes in the\nhealth state of individuals over time before death.\nSacher and Trucco (19) and Strehler and Mildvan (20) devel-\noped models where individual risks of death changed stochasti-\ncally as persons experienced environmental stresses. They,\nhowever, assumed individuals start in a physiologically homo-\ngeneous state, which is not consistent with significant, geneti-\ncally determined manifest variation in the age-at-death distribu-\ntion. Applications of these models, often to \"period\" (i.e.\ncross-sectional) population mortality rates, involve the empiri-\ncal fitting of the parameters of a Gompertz approximating form\n(21). However, under biologically plausible conditions, these\nmodels produce mortality trajectories quite different than the\nGompertz. For example, a constant hazard can be generated at\nWhen vitality has decreased to the point where it is simi-\nlar to the average energy fluctuation, the rate of mortality\nshould become constant. Such a course is approached by\nhuman mortality figures and is to be predicted on the basis\nof the integration of the Maxwell-Boltzman equation from\nlarge energies to zero.\nIn addition, expanded theories of the evolution of aging pre-\ndict late life mortality plateaus (22). Thus, there are several the-\noretical bases on which to expect constant mortality rates, as\nobserved at late ages in many species (13).\nEstimating the parameters of biologically realistic models of\nhuman mortality and aging requires longitudinal data on the\nphysiological state of individuals and the stochastic evolution\nof those states over time (23). The model must describe the ef-\nfects on mortality of internal mechanisms of physiological\nchange with age operating under genetic constraints. It must\nalso show how genetically constrained processes evolve with\nage as a result of the stochastic impact of environmental shocks,\nand how the operation of physiological mechanisms evolve to\nrespond to and modify the organism's internal environment be-\ncause of those shocks.\nSimms (24) experimentally examined such processes. He\ninferred the physiological state of rats at specific chronological\nages by observing the effects of a quantifiable physiological\nstress (i.e., the loss of a fixed amount of blood) on survival.\nThe capacity to survive a given level of stress can be referred to\nas the \"vitality\" of the organism. Vitality is generally repre-\nsented as a unidimensional trait scaled in terms of the thermal\nenergy equivalents required to maintain the organism's home-\nostasis. Rosenberg and colleagues (25) estimated the activation\nenergy for entropy (i.e., the threshold at which system\nfailure-death-occurred due to protein denaturation) as 190\nkcal/mol using a Weibull hazard (a second type of extreme\nvalue distribution) function. Strehler and Mildvan (20) esti-\nmated 34 kcal/mol using a Gompertz function. Thus, different\nhazard functions and their underlying failure mechanisms can\nproduce quite different assessments of basic biological parame-\nters and the operation ofmechanisms.\nAlthough vitality reflects the ability to restore physiological\nhomeostasis after a shock as a unidimensional trait, it does not\nexplicitly reflect the details of the effects of the structural com-\nplexity of the organism's physiological mechanisms on mortal-\nity. For example, organisms with greater structural (anatomical\nand biochemical) complexity might express a higher level of\nstability to a wider range of small shocks to the system (e.g.,\nman's adaptation to climatic variation). By contrast, they may\nshow greater instability and a more clearly defined lethal\nthreshold for large shocks that disturb homeostasis than do sim-\nple organisms (e.g., the ability of insects versus humans to tol-\nerate large doses of ionizing radiation). Thus, mathematically,\nthere could be a trade-off among biological complexity, the\nrange of successful adaptation, and robustness, because biologi-\ncal complexity implies a multicomponent system where failure\noccurs due to the disruption of the organ system(s) most sensi-\ntive to a given stress. The larger and the more functionally dif-\nferentiated the system ofinterdependent organs, the more ways\nfailure can be manifest; or, conversely, the more time for effec-\ntive feedback and coordinated responses between organ sys-\ntems, the more ways for failure to be averted.\nTherefore, the question in modeling population aging pro-\ncesses is one of how the structural and biological complexities\nof an organism affect the age-related ability to resist adverse\nchanges in the environment. This suggests that we should\nsearch for trajectories of mortality risk that are not monotonic\nwith age; that, within the life span of individuals, we should in-\nclude structural complexity to allow for adaptations that can,\nfor significantperiods of time, increase the fitness/vitality of or-\nOne population model that can do this is based on the theo-\nretical relation of mortality to basal metabolic rates (BMR).\nZuev and colleagues (27) argue that although BMR is generally\nmeasured by O2\nconsumption, changes in other physiological\nparameters (e.g., blood glucose, vital capacity), taken as ratios\nto the value of those parameters in persons with the optimal\nBMR at a reference age (say, 20 to 30 years of age), can be\nviewed as an index of vitality. They estimated parameters from\nthe Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) data\nwhere age, height, weight, vital capacity, and fasting glucose\nwere used to measure the relative metabolic rate. They obtained\nsatisfactory fits of the age rate of change in the relative\nmetabolic rate in the MRFIT data which were then applied to\nble to describe changes in the level of mortality over time as an\nage-specific function of the relative metabolic rate as calibrated\nfrom MRFIT data. This provides a way ofphysiologically pa-\nrameterizing population mortality functions using ancillary,\nthough indirect, data on biological variation.\nThe Theoretical Basis ofa Multidimensional Nonlinear\nStochastic Model ofAging\nA crucial factor in assessing a theory on how aging works is\nthe evaluation of the selective advantage offered by survival to\nlater ages, i.e., past reproductive ages. Two possible models are\n(i) antagonistic pleiotropy and (ii) disposable soma (28,29).\nAntagonistic pleiotropy (30) is based on principles of popula-\ntion genetics. Because natural selection shapes the biological\nadaptation of the organism to the environment, the decline in\nthe force of selection with age in adults suggests senescence\ncould be due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations oc-\ncurring late in life. Random mutation accumulation is a rela-\ntively neutral process. The stronger postulate of antagonistic\npleiotropy,however, suggests that deleterious late effects are se-\nlected because they have large positive consequences for sur-\nvival during reproductive ages.\nThe disposable soma theory, derived from principles of phys-\niological ecology, involves assessing how an organism best al-\nlocates its finite energy reserves to meet necessary metabolic\ntasks. Here it is the level of environmental risk that is central;\nLe.,if mortality risk is high, there is little advantage in investing\nheavily in somatic maintenance, but a great advantage to rapid\ngrowth and reproduction. In contrast, in a low-mortality envi-\nronment, even the fairly costly maintenance mechanisms, e.g.,\nthe 2% of total energy estimated as needed for DNA error\nsurveillance (28), become a higher priority.\nIt is not necessary that these two models operate indepen-\ndently. Often gene-environment interactions are important in\naging and chronic disease. For example, certain metabolic en-\nzymes are not generated to any significant degree until the\nchemical that they are designed to metabolize is present in the\nenvironment (and, hence, in the organism). This forms the basis\nof the science ofpharmacogenetics. The presence ofthese com-\npounds are triggers, or signals, to the genes encoding the me-\ntabolizing enzyme to begin manufacturing it in physiologically\nsignificantquantities (31).\nAn intriguing anomaly observed in both the U.S. and Britain\nis that the likelihood of surviving to ages 100+ increased rapidly\nfor the birth cohorts ofthe 1840s and beyond. Perutz (32) found\nthat the British centenarian population grew 1% per year up to\nthe late 1940s and then began to grow at over 6% per year.\nFogel (33) argued that similar temporal patterns of morbidity\ndeclines in the U.S. were related to improved nutrition and in-\ncreases in the body mass index (BMI). Perls (34) found that the\naverage health of survivors to ages 80+ is remarkably good,\noften better than for persons aged 70 to 79. Such changes in\nlate-age survival and vitality were generally viewed as too rapid\nto have occurred through evolutionary processes. Fogel and\nCosta (35), as a consequence, promulgated a theory of \"techno-\nphysio\" evolution to explain rapid (relative to evolutionary\ntime) changes in life expectancies in the last three centuries of\nhuman experience. In this model they argue that it is necessary\nthat the human (and human control of) environment has\n\"evolved\" to a more benign (favoring survival to later ages)\nstate, rather than the profile of genes determining human\nlongevity evolving to any significant degree.\nUnder classical models of evolutionary, longevity trait selec-\ntion changes in the genetic profile require a long time. There\nare, however, alternate models where genetic change (or the\nstimulation of the expression of latent gene profiles) may occur\nmore rapidly. Quite likely, gene-environment interactions, prob-\nably involving multiple genes, are involved. In these cases, it is\nthe long history of evolution that has produced wide genetic\nvariation in humans-a large proportion of which remains la-\ntent until the appropriate environmental challenge stimulates its\nphenotypic expression.\nAs Nebert (31) suggests about drug metabolizing enzymes\n(DME),\nVirtually all classes of DME's listed in Table 1 [not\nshown] are present in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. It\ntherefore seems very likely that many DME's originated\nduring early evolution, in order to provide the organism\nwith metabolism of important endogenous molecules as\nwell as the breakdown of environmental chemicals uti-\nlized for energy. Subsequently, the DME's in eukaryotes\nprobably diversified, in response to the adverse effects of\ndietary pressures and other environmental chemicals. (p.\nNebert proposes, as a very early chemical substrate, CS\nwhich is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes to car-\nbonyl sulfide and CO2, Once sufficient levels of intracellular O2\nwere generated, it is argued that a P450 enzyme appeared to use\nas an energy source. Purines, pyrimidines, and biogenic\namine-related compounds are likelyearlyendogenous substrates.\nThere have recently been identified cell regulatory mecha-\nnisms that may maintain the latency of certain genes until ap-\npropriate conditions allow their expression. For example, heat\nshock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been suggested as a \"capacitor\"\nfor evolution. This is because Hsp90 both (i) controls inherently\nunstable signal transducers, and (ii) handles cellular stress. In\nthe case of significant stress, the cell's Hsp90 content may\nswitch to deal with protein denaturation, thereby allowing an\nensemble of genetic traits previously held latent by Hsp90 to be\nphenotypically expressed. This was shown in Drosophilawhen\ntemperatures were below 18 or above 30\u00b0C. This was argued to\nbe the \"first evidence for an explicit molecular mechanism that\nassists the process of evolutionary change in response to the en-\nvironment\" (36). Additionally, mitochrondial mutations are so\nrapid, and repair mechanisms so inefficient (37), that their oc-\ncurence within individuals may cause chronic diseases and, in-\ndeed, may be the basis of a generalized senescence in the sense\nof a reduced capacity of cells to generate energy to meet envi-\nronmental challenges (38,39). Thus, a major research challenge\nis to develop a mathematical model parameterized to represent\nsuch effects (i.e., genetic expression accelerated by environ-\nmental interactions) within the limits of existing longitudinal\ndata. The limitations of existing data suggests it is necessary to\nmake extensive use of biological theory to identify the parame-\nters of such models. We describe biological principles below\nthat may be useful in this process.\nHormesis\nPrior stochastic models have tended to describe individuals\nas undifferentiated,homogenous units (20).An alternate formu-\nFigure 1.Productionof HSP72 in youngand old cellssubjectto stress.Based\non data from LiuAY-C, Lin Z, Choi HS, SorhageF,Li B. Attenuatedinduction\nof heatshockgeneexpressionin aging diploidfibroblasts. Journal ofBiological\nrepetoire of responses must be genetically programmed so they\nare available to beinduced by stress.\nTo relate this to the logic of the Hsp90 mechanism, a sharp\nchange in ambient temperature requires Hsp90 to reduce pro-\ntein denaturation. However, a major environmental shift, if per-\nsistent, will require a significant genetic response, possibly\nfrom a repetoire of latent genetic states, expressed when Hsp90\ncontrol is reduced, that may be adaptive for the new conditions.\nThus, changes in human longevity may be resident in the\nhuman genome and stimulated by changes in environment.\nHeatShockProteins\nExamples of biologically adaptive response systems in hu-\nmans are multifold and exist at the molecular as well as higher\nlevels of biological organization. For example, heat shock pro-\ntein production is a highly biologically conserved cell defense\nmechanism found in both higher and lower organisms that pro-\ntects many cell structures and functions (41). For example,\nHsp72 (72 refers to the weight of the protein in kilodaltons), or\nDNA K, is a \"molecular chaperone\" that preserves the topolog-\nical structure of proteins as they are produced by ribosomes.\nPreservation ofthe topological structure of the protein molecule\nis essential to its physiological function. Loss of structure im-\nplies loss of function-denaturation-of the protein. Hsp72\nhelps preserve the three-dimensional topology of the protein\n(and its function) in the face ofthennal, chemical, or other chal-\nlenges to the cell and is essential to the organism's ability to\nsurvive environmental stress.\nYounger organisms can produce a larger excess of Hsp72\nthan required to meet the typical stress than can older organ-\nisms (42). In Figure 1, the production of Hsp72 due to a heat-\nshock stimulus is illustrated for old (having experienced 51\nreplications) and young (having experienced 18 replications)\ncells.\nReduced production of Hsp72 in older cells (i.e., those hav-\ning undergone more cell divisions) is due to a transcriptional\nconstraint (43). This means that subsequent challenges to the\ncell that would have been lethal can be tolerated after a prior\nnonlethal exposure because of the excess Hsp72 existing in a\npreviously challenged cell (44). In older cells there is, however,\nless Hsp72 reserve, possibly due to the greater demand for it in\nolder cells, i.e., a wider range of proteins need protection from\nlation that explicitly acknowledges the structural complexity of\nan organism is the principle of \"hormesis\" (40). Honnesis sug-\ngests low-level stresses may increase the \"vitality\" of an organ-\nism, because, to respond to such stresses, internal communica-\ntion (as in \"feedback\" loops) is necessary among multiple-\norgan systems with such communication, inducing lags in\nresponse. This arrangement has the advantage of permitting\nresponses to a wider range of environmental conditions, be-\ncause it allows organs to have specialized functions. It has the\ndisadvantage that the organism has to resist the environmental\nstress until a physiological response can be made.\nHormetic mechanisms can be described as the continuous\nsensing of the state (y) of a system and the relating of informa-\ntion (fy) from the sensor (S) to a preferred (ideal) state (x),\ne=x-fy\nwhere the discrepancy (e) is reduced by an effector (E) ex-\npressed as a transfer function (see below). The oscillatory be-\nhavior observed after a fixed input, 0, depends on how efficient\nthe effector (E) is in reducing (e) as information propagates\nthrough the loop (40), i.e.,\nfy---+(l1.y)---+(x*-fy+)---+(E)---+y*-+S---+fy*. (i)\nt\n\u00b0\nIn this sequence, the perception (j.y) by the organism of the\ncurrent state y is perturbed by an environmental shock, 0, defin-\ning a new preferred state, x*, which is related to the change in\nthe actual system state (l1.y). This produces a new perceived\nstate discrepancy (x*-fy+), which induces a system response\n(E) to alter the actual system state, y*, that is then again sensed\n(S), providing an updated perceived state (j.y*).\nSuch physiological systems are \"under-damped\" so response\ntime does not increase with changes in load. Such overcorrect-\ning contributes to hormesis. Stebbing (40) argues that this\nserves adaptive evolutionary and gene-environmental response\npurposes:\nA control mechanism that responds maximally upon frrst\ndetecting a perturbation, or simply sustains a higher level\nof counteraction than is essential to neutralize some\nchange in load, is likely to confer an advantage over oth-\ners that do not if the load then increases because it acts as\nif the increase in load had been anticipated. On the other\nhand, if, following the initial increase in load there is no\nfurther increase in load, any tendency to overcorrect will\nnot put the organism at a disadvantage. One can easily see,\ntherefore, how such subtleties in the behavior of control\nmechanisms might be selected for. (p. 546)\nStructural complexity, therefore, induces a temporal lag be-\ntween the stress and the organism's response to stress. A system\nwith lagged responses requires that energy be expended in\nquanta, i.e., the response cannot be continuously varying be-\ncause it is not instantaneous; the energy is expended in fixed\namounts adequate to respond to the levels of lethal stress en-\ncountered in an environment with a significant probability.\nThus, the quantal response must be, on average, larger than the\namount of energy required to meet the environmentally \"typi-\ncal\" stress. In addition, to have the lag built into the system, a\nRelative\nProductionof\n~~i~\nT\n~] ~. =:\noJ , ,\nHours-e-\n-+- Young Cells\n....-OldCells\ndenaturation (42), as well as possibly a decreased capability for\nexpressing it. In our prior discussion of Hsp90 we showed how\nthe adaptive response may induce significant multiple genetic\nchanges, as opposed to the activation of one specific enzyme\nproducing gene.\nAnother general biological response system in humans (and\nmany other species) that can increase the individual's fitness\nafter a \"moderate\" stress is the cytochrome P450 enzyme sys-\ntem (45). P450 refers to hemeproteins (i.e., proteins containing\nan iron atom) with a near ultraviolet maximum response at a\nwave length of 450 nm (nanometers) for the Fell-CO complex\ndue to the \"presence of an axial cysteinal thiolate ligand to the\nheme iron,\" i.e., that the molecular signal based on response to\nlight energy is due to the response of a sulfur-containing amino\nacid related in a particular structure with the iron atom (46).\nThis system is interesting because certain ofits elements are bi-\nologically primitive, i.e., they were started by \"animal-plant\"\nwarfare 1.4 billion years ago when plants began to develop new\nstress metabolite phytoalexins to be less palatable to animals\n(45). The evolution ofthis superfamily of enzymes is also inter-\nesting in that it involves a second type of gene-environment in-\nteraction dynamic for accelerating genetic evolution where\nthere is an interaction between the genetic adaptations of differ-\nent species, i.e., animal-plant \"warfare\" may represent coevolv-\ning molecular dynamics with the coevolutionary parts repre-\nsenting members of different kingdoms (45).\nIn the history of the evolution of the P450 enzyme system, as\nmay have been true for Hsp, there was also likely the develop-\nment of system redundancy, i.e., enzymes whose production, or\nlevel of production, required an environmental cue for the in-\nduction or activation of the transcription of enzymes from spe-\ncific genes. Thus, there exists latent phenotypic variation in\nhuman, and other species, in the P450 genetic code that can\nhelp adaptation to novel environmental conditions. That adapta-\ntion, which is an induced (i.e., not evolved) genetic and struc-\ntural change, may increase the ''fitness'' or vitality of the organ-\nism within a specific environment after the stress is\nexperienced.\nExamples of inducible P450 genes are those responsible for\nenzymes involved in the stage I metabolic conversion of poly-\ncyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (e.g., two genes in the\nCYPI family). These enzymes also vary in inducibility by gen-\nder (47). Ifthe inducible enzymes influenced survival to very\nlate ages (e.g., increase expressions of antioxidants such as su-\nperoxide dimutase), this could be a nonevolutionary basis for a\nrapid increase in the expression of \"genetic\" potential for sur-\nvival to late ages. Indeed, because both Fogel (33) and Perutz\n(32) suggest that nutritional changes were significant in cohorts\nborn after 1840, producing a sixfold or greater chance of sur-\nviving to age 100 in Britain and reducing chronic disease preva-\nlence by about 6% per decade in the U.S., the gene-environ-\nment interaction of specific nutrients with inducible P450\nenzymes may be partly responsible for observed health and\nmortality changes.\nImmuneModulation\nWe have discussed two highly biologically conserved cellu-\nlar systems (i.e., Hsp and P450 enzymes). A third system, of\nmuch greater complexity, is currently a mainstay of many pub-\nlic health efforts, i.e., the intentional programming of the human\nimmune system. Such functionally specialized cells and pro-\nteins exist in complex multicellular organisms. In birds the sys-\ntem is much less complex than in humans, i.e., the number of\ncell types and chemical signals involved in human immune re-\nsponses is larger. However, these more complex human mecha-\nnisms still represent the principle of applying a small environ-\nmental shock to stimulate a systemic reaction so that more\nsevere challenges in the future can be defended against, thereby\nincreasingthe vitality of the organism.\nThis has been successfully used against a number of viral\nagents, some with chronic effects (e.g., poliomyelitis). Its use is\ncurrently being explored in cancer therapy where there is a need\nfor a more complete understanding of the complexities of the\nhuman immune system in order to invoke a successful immune\nresponse to tumor cells. Some progress has been made in im-\nmunotherapy for human melanoma. More recently, employing\ndendritic cells, progress against prevalent solid tumors has been\nmade. It is the structural complexity ofthe system that allows it\nto adapt to such a wide range ofmicrobiological insults. Aging\nhere is generally defined by a loss of immune efficiency with\nage. It is of interest, however, that supplementation with certain\nvitamins can improve certain types of immune response at even\nadvanced ages, e.g., vitamins A, C, and E (48); vitamin E (49).\nThe effects of these three factors may be magnified, in both\npositive and negative ways, by interactions between the various\nsystems. For example, Hsp60, a human protein, is similar to\nHsp65, a heat shock protein in bacteria. It is hypothesized that\ncertain destructive autoimmune responses might be triggered\nby the organism's immune system mistaking Hsp60 for the bac-\nA Multidimensional QuadraticMortalityModelwith Stochastic\nStateDynamics\nWhat do these three examples of potential increases in fit-\nness with age imply for models of human aging and mortality?\nThey suggest that an organism's fitness can be increased, for\nsome time, by appropriate external stimuli, even at late ages.\nThus, the hazard function for humans cannot be a strictly\nmonotonic function of age. To successfully exploit a more com-\nplex model, however, the mathematics requires that we have di-\nrect data on state changes of the system. We, however, do not\nneed to have all state variables measured to significantly in-\ncrease our understanding of human aging. What is needed is a\nsample of state variables, or their proxies, sufficiently rich to\ntrace the trajectory of the physiologically significant dimen-\nsions of the state space over time/age. The number of variables\nrequired to approximate these multidimensional state dynamics\nmay be small (e.g., 8 to 12) and some of the measures (e.g.,\nblood glucose, vital capacity index, hematocrit, cholesterol,\nbody mass index) may be relatively easy to make. Ifso, the pos-\nsibility of successfully modeling the stochastic age dynamics of\na multidimensional physiological system is greatly increased.\nHowever, even in the best case, current data limitations dictate a\nreliance on theoretical principles (e.g., hormesis).\nThe structure of a mortality model based on the principle of\nhormesis suggests the minimum level of mortality is found at\nthe smallest possible exposure, which induces the fitness mech-\nanism. A quadratic mortality function can approximate such\nstate variable-mortality relations (50). To determine the degree\nto which state variables remain unobserved, a theoretically rea-\nsonable age function is included with the quadratic function to\ncapture systemic unmeasured effects. Such a composite func-\nf.L(~1' AgeJ =(~\\~)e6Ageit (ii)\nwhere ~it are vectors of J state variables assessed at age t and J3\nis a JXJ matrix of coefficients that relate those variables to the\nindividual's level of risk, f.L.

Trajectories\nof ~ijt may be modeled as a multidimensional stochastic autore-\ngressive process, with coefficients vector 'Yjandconstant Cj;\nwhere stochasticity refers to the future uncertainty, eijt of the\nstate of the organism, i.e.,\n(iii)\nwhere superscript T denotes the transpose of the 'Yj vector.\nOne way to generalize (iii) is to define a new time \"metame-\nter\" to represent \"evolutionary\" changes in state variable dy-\nnamics or,\nxijt=C/r)+\"J~(T)Ji(t_l)+e*ijt (iv)\nThe J equations like (iv) describe both the vector dependence\nof future on past age states of the system as well as on evolu-\ntionary time. Evolutionary time is represented by the depen-\ndence of the autoregressive coefficients C, and 'Yj on 'T. The J X\nJ coefficient matrix, r('T) , can represent both positive and nega-\ntive feedback between state variables. In equation iv, the effect\nofstate variable values at a prior age (t - 1) on future values is\nassumed to bea function of evolutionary time ('T).\nA crucial factor for the model is determining the metric ofr,\n'T could be represented by calendar years, numbers of cohorts,\nby indicators for specific cohorts for which genetic variation is\nbeing examined, or possibly as a genetic \"distance\" parameter.\nThe functional dependence of the state dynamic coefficients on\nevolutionary time, 'T, depends on how fast genetic structures\nevolve under natural selection and how fast trends in the envi-\nronment operate to induce manifestations of latent genetic vari-\nation resident in the human genome that has been biologically\nconserved. Natural selection is often viewed as operating\nslowly, sometimes taking millions of years, or operating over\nthousands of cohorts. There are little data with sufficient time\nvariation to assess these effects. An exceptional case is the re-\nstudy, they believed they showed evidence of antagonastic\npleiotropy in that females with many children, or children born\nearly, had poorer late age survival (54).\nHowever, there are many genetic changes that have been in-\nduced more rapidly. The issue is how to separate more rapid\nevolutionary effects from gene-environment interactions. First,\none has to infer evolutionary effects from equation (iv). Given\navailable data, some cross-cohort variation can be examined.\nThese may suffice to identify gene-environment interactions\n(e.g., changes in the late age survival of birth cohorts from, say,\ntreating 'T as a Bayesian parameter where the existence of a ge-\nnetic response to a \"novel\" environmental agent presumes the\nexistence of a genetic repertoire.\nFor example, AIDS emerged from an African source in the\npersons with resistance to the AIDS virus, implying a prior ex-\nposure to a similar agent. The evidence from Northern\nEuropean populations (i.e., the high prevalence of a deletion\nmutation of the CCRS allele) suggests this agent operated from\nrecorded infectious disease pandemics such as the bubonic\nplagues (55). However, there are documented selection effects\nof the influenza pandemic of 1917 (and of more recent flu epi-\ndemics) for the ability to resist specific flu viruses. The 1917\nflu virus may have induced biological damage in survivors to\nbe manifest as chronic diseases at late ages at relatively recent\ndates. Thus, the effects of the 1917 pandemic (and of streptoc-\ncocal infections which may affect congestive heart disease rates\n(56\u00bb could represent selection for genetic traits and chronic\ndisease effects on aging, i.e., both 'Y and 'T could have been al-\ntered. There is evidence of other microbial-gene interactions\nthat produce chronic disease risks. For example, Lin and col-\nleagues (57) suggested that the APOE-4 allele, which is related\nto Alzheimer's disease risk, may operate by increasing suscepti-\nbility to herpes simplex virus type 1 in certain regions of the\nbrain. Technologies to establish the evolutionary time scale for\nsuch genetic effects by examining phenotypic dispersion across\nspecies exist. For humans, maternal mitochrondrial DNA is\nalso useful to trace such effects.\nThus, if such markers can be tracked, then evolution may be\nmade a known parametric function of time, so 'T can be replaced\nby a parametric function. With 'T constrained to specific values,\ngene-environment effects will be easier to identify. However,\nthat will not fully capture gene-environment interactions, i.e.,\nthe genetic determinants of evolutionary time dependency in-\nvolve environmental effects for gene expression (i.e., as illus-\ntrated for Hsp, P450, and the immune system). That is, many\nbasic cellular defenses are highly biologically conserved and\nexist in potential genetic form to increase the adaptive reper-\ntoire of individuals. This response latency can be reflected by\nextending the state dynamic equation to include appropriate in-\nteraction terms, or,\nx ijt = CJ'T)+ \"J~('T) X i(t-I) + tP~('T) gi(t-I)&) {'i(t-IJ+e**ijt (v)\nwhere \u00ae is the Kronecker product that defines the interactions\nofJ endogenous and K endogenous (environmental) risk fac-\ntors, and l\\J/'T) is the vector ofJ X K coefficients that apply to\nthe J X K interaction terms generated by the Kronecker prod-\nuct. It also can be referred to as {( tP~('T\u00bb.(Y(t-I)}or a vector of\nenvironmentally altered coefficients of state changes, -!i(t-l);\nwhich may change slowly due to evolutionary processes\n('T), but rapidly due to environmental system changes (i.e.,\n-------+------1\nx(t)\nFigure 2. Change of quadratic mortality function with explicit age depen-\ndence.\nYi(t-l))' This can also be viewed as three way interactions (i.e.,\n\\\u00a5j\u00b7'T Yi (t-I))\nwhere ~ is an unknown coefficient vector, 'T comes\nfrom biological data, and Yitis directly measured. Viewed as\nthree-way interactions, this suggests strategies by which evolu-\ntionary and gene-environment effects on survival might be\nidentified. By substituting equation v in the quadratic mortality\nfunction we make survival an explicit function of the interac-\ntion. If eis reduced by the introduction of the state dynamics\nwith the three way interaction, over the egenerated when equa-\ntion iv is used to represent state dynamics, then we have evi-\ndence of both evolutionary and gene-environment effects.\nWhat this means for the age trajectory of mortality is shown\nin Figure 2.\nIn Figure 2 the quadratic function is plotted, for each of four\nfunction becomes steeper, i.e., there is a risk factor-age interac-\ntion that increases mortality risk. At age 50, this interaction is\nweak so that known risk factor variation dominates individual\ndifferences in mortality. By age 95, currently unmeasured (pos-\nsibly genetic) factors are important. Ifwe could successfully\nmeasure all relevant state variables, and model their dynamics,\nthen ewould be reduced and the hazard at age 95 would be less\nsteep, i.e., more like the function at age 50. Ifall state variables\ncould be measured, then e= 0.0 and there would be no change\nin the shape of the function with age. In studies of the 1982,\nmeasures reduced e by 40% or more (52). However, the\nquadratic function still increased rapidly with age, indicating\nthe presence of important latent factors. A model not including\newould attribute that age change to observed risk factors,\nwhich forces them to unrealistic mean values in attempting to\ncompensate for age variation. This distorts the relation of risk\nfactors to mortality and quickly (by age 60) produces biologi-\ncally implausible behavior (58). The mortality of the population\nis also a function of the stochastic state dynamics, i.e., coeffi-\ncients in equation (ii) are functions of the state dynamic equa-\ntions (i.e., iii, iv, or v) depending on what is assumed about the\ndynamics and their genetic determinants.\nDISCUSSION\nWe examined existing models (e.g., the Gompertz and\nWeibull) of human mortality and aging and suggested the need\nfor models of human aging to be re-formulated in stochastic,\nmultidimensional, dynamic terms. We discussed plausible ex-\ntensions (51) of existing theoretical models (20,21) to imple-\nment these dynamics and review their biological relevance\nwhen such models were applied to both risk factors and to mul-\nLong Term Care Survey (NLTCS). For example, the effect of\nunobserved risk factors were reduced by almost half when a\ndynamic disability process was estimated and made part of the\nWe reviewed how some of those models might be further ex-\ntended to deal with evolutionary effects and time. The phe-\nnomenon of mortality, and its dependence on age, is far more\ncomplex biologically than is implied by standard hazard func-\ntions. Work on more complete stochastic models of aging is\nneeded to integrate the wide range of findings about the dy-\nnamics of aging now emerging from experimental and epidemi-\nological studies.\nACKNOWLEOOMENTS\nThis research was supported by funds from the National Institute on Aging.\nAddress correspondence to  , Center for Demographic\nREFERENCES\n1.
