Twenty-five years ago, it was odd to see a\ndevelopmental psychologist recruit dyslexic and autistic\nadults as participants in experiments. There were no\ndiagnostic instruments for adults at that time. Now that\nwe have these instruments, some deeper truths have\nemerged: First, diagnosis based on behavioral criteria will\nalways be problematic, as behavior is strongly influenced\nby comorbidity, motivation, age, and ability. Second,\ncompensatory learning can circumvent or cover up, but\nnot eliminate, some basic difficulties in cognitive pro-\ncessing. Third, comorbidity and low general ability tend\nto reduce opportunities for compensation.\nTwenty-five years ago, it became apparent that many\ndyslexic adults had learned to read accurately and could\nachieve an acceptable reading age. Later, it also became\napparent that, in Italy, dyslexic children read perfectly\naccurately. This success is due to the transparent and\nregular Italian writing system, which I have suggested\ncan act as a therapeutic environment for dyslexia\n(U. Frith, 1999). However, we were able to demonstrate\nthe presence of dyslexia in Italy and the persistence of\nreading problems in dyslexic adults using measures of\nreading speed and tests designed to tap phonological\nprocessing. These measures revealed underlying neuro-\ncognitive problems, indicating that they are universal,\nregardless of language, and persistent, regardless of com-\npensatory learning (Paulesu et al., 2001).\nIn the case of autism, the huge range of clinical mani-\nfestations is a major problem. This can be observed not\nonly by comparing different individuals, but also by trac-\ning changes during the lifetime of a single individual.\nThus, since the 1980s, it has been known that some indi-\nviduals start off being aloof and withdrawn and later\nbecome socially active but odd. Repetitive behaviors\noften lessen with age; special interests can vanish and\nsavant talents can change. It is still not clear what causes\nthese changes and wide variations, but comorbidity\nincreases severity whereas compensation makes it possi-\nble to disguise persisting problems (U. Frith, 2008).\nAdults with dyslexia and adults with autism who show\ngood compensation can sail through standard diagnostic\ntests. Have they ceased to be dyslexic or autistic? Of\ncourse not. They themselves tell us about their persisting\nproblems, and we can reveal these problems with more\nsubtle tests. We now know that dyslexics read well at a\ncost of time and effort. The same is true for autistic peo-\nple. They can use well-rehearsed social scripts that work\nCorresponding Author:\nUta Frith, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17 Queen Square,\nE-mail: u.frith@ucl.ac.uk\nAutism and Dyslexia: A Glance Over\n25 Years of Research\nUta Frith\nInstitute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, and Center of\nFunctionally Integrative Neuroscience, University of Aarhus\n Keywords\ndevelopmental disorders, Asperger syndrome, cognitive neuroscience\nin familiar situations. However, stress and unfamiliar situ-\nations can produce catastrophic collapse. To visualize the\ndifferences between surface behavior and underlying\ncognitive mechanisms, I have found it useful to apply a\nframework representing three levels of explanation:\nbehavior, cognition, and brain (U. Frith, 2001). These do\nnot map onto each other in one-to-one fashion. Rather, a\nlarge number of biological risk factors may lead to diffi-\nculties in a few specific cognitive processes. These few\ndifficulties in turn may give rise to a large number of\nbehavioral signs and symptoms (U. Frith, 2012).\nA Fundamental Change in Methods:\nLooking Inside the Brain/Mind\nIt is a little known fact that the development of diagnostic\ntests for adults gained impetus from the desire to make\nuse of the emerging neuroimaging techniques. This\nadvance occurred because it seemed wrong to scan chil-\ndren. In fact, when we scanned the first dyslexic adults in\nthe mid 1990s, we had known them from when they had\nbeen first diagnosed as children. The same was true for\nthe first autistic adults. The diagnostic tests now available\nhave been a great boon in many ways, but especially for\nthose people who had slipped through the net and were\nnot diagnosed as children. They had unjustly been\nlabeled slow, lazy, or unintelligent. Having a name for\nyour problems and learning that there are others like you\ncan be liberating.\nIt is remarkable how quickly research on disorders of\ncognitive development has transformed into cognitive\ndevelopmental neuroscience. This advance was due to\nthe generous collaboration of researchers who pioneered\nneuroimaging methods and volunteers who braved the\nstill novel scanners. In those heady days, we naively\nhoped that we would be able to immediately identify the\nmalfunctioning brain circuit that gave rise to critical dif-\nficulties in cognitive processing, such as difficulty in pho-\nnological processing in dyslexia or difficulty in social\nprocessing in autism. Things turned out to be far more\ncomplex, particularly as we are still largely ignorant of\nhow the brain works. Which brain circuits are necessary\nfor distinct cognitive processing mechanisms? How do\nthey function in neurotypical brains? We had, and still\nhave, a lot to learn.\nToday, when researchers have reassured themselves\nthat MRI methods are safe also for children, the field is\nchanging again. There are now several longitudinal stud-\nies in progress in which individuals are scanned repeat-\nedly over many years. This work is giving us information\nabout the developing brain and mind that we simply\nnever had before. For instance, there is a dramatic wax-\ning and waning restructuring of gray and white matter\nthroughout childhood and adolescence. This work should\nget us closer to understand which cognitive processes\nmight go wrong in neurodevelopmental disorders and\nwhen.\nThe Rise and Fall of Asperger\nSyndrome\nAutism has always been with us, but it has been recog-\nnized only since the mid 20th century, and then only very\nslowly. The prevalence is now thought to be around 1%,\nwhich is a staggering increase from the 0.1% estimate\nfrom 25 years ago. One major reason for the increase is\nthe widening of the diagnostic criteria (U. Frith, 2008)--\nthe spectrum of autism is now incredibly broad. At one\nextreme is the individual who does not use speech and\nhas severely repetitive and restricted behaviors; at the\nother extreme is the individual with Asperger syndrome\nwho is highly articulate and has superior analytic abilities\nand fascinating special interests. Despite these differ-\nences, there is a common denominator: a highly recog-\nnizable lack of reciprocal social interaction. Even the\nvery able individual on the milder part of the autism\nspectrum cannot compensate for a peculiar void in social\ninteraction: engaging in the ordinary to and fro of every-\nThe widespread public recognition of Asperger syn-\ndrome was impossible to foresee when I translated\nAsperger's landmark paper (U. Frith, 1991) at a time\nwhen most people had never heard of the name. But the\nrise over the last 20 years may now be followed by a\nfall--the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders has abandoned the label. It\nwas removed because it is widely agreed that the critical\nfeatures distinguishing Asperger syndrome from other\nneurodevelopmental disorders are the same as those\nseen in autism. In addition, there is a largely unrecog-\nnized downside to the rise of Asperger syndrome:\nResearchers have become less interested in studying\nthose who are intellectually disabled. These individuals\nare much more difficult to study. Yet they have so much\nto tell us, if we only knew the right questions to ask.\nMechanisms of Social Cognition\nAutism provided the inspiration for the idea that social\ninformation might be processed differently from other\ninformation and given priority in neurotypical minds\n(U. Frith & Frith, 1999). Of course, we still don't know\nwhat the processes are like and how the prioritizing\nworks. Autism throws the spotlight on social communica-\ntion, and furthermore, it reverses the tables: What is\nit that makes us insatiable in our craving for social\ncommunication?\nMany different mechanisms in our mind are dedicated\nto processing social stimuli (C. Frith & Frith, 2012). One\nof these, known as Theory of Mind, or mentalizing,\nentered psychologist's jargon as shorthand for the ten-\ndency to attribute mental states to each other. Amazingly,\nthis tendency has a circumscribed basis in the brain\n(U. Frith & Frith, 1999) and has been operationalized by\ntasks such as the Sally-Ann test. In this test, children\nabove the age of 4 can attribute a false belief to Sally, but\nautistic children cannot do so. However, it turned out that\nthis is not the whole story--able autistic adolescents and\nadults can pass the Sally-Ann test and similar tasks.\nThere is also a nonverbal type of intuitive mentalizing,\nwhich can be assessed via eye gaze patterns, and here\nwe get a different story: Even young infants engage in\nthis intuitive mentalizing, but able autistic adults do not\n(Senju, Southgate, White, & Frith, 2009). Perhaps this is\nwhy they struggle with everyday fast moving reciprocal\ncommunication even when they have learned to attribute\nmental states explicitly (U. Frith, 2012). Many questions\nare now being raised about mentalizing and its likely\npresence in other species, such as birds and dolphins.\nWhat is uniquely human in social communication? Why\nhave only humans invented governments and schools,\nand how do they manage their reputation in the age of\nthe World Wide Web (Tennie, Frith, & Frith, 2010)? So\nmuch remains to be explored in the next 25 years.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the\nauthorship or the publication of this article.\nReferences\nFrith, C., & Frith, U.
