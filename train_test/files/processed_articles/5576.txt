But recent real world\nCorresponding author:\nClaes H de Vreese, Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), University of Amsterdam,\nEmail: c.h.devreese@uva.nl\ndevelopments \u00ad both relating to immigration flows and to developments in the EU\nitself \u00ad has made revisiting this topic urgent, both socially and theoretically.\nThe Special Issue developed and edited by Kentmen-Cin and Erisen is very\ntimely and includes a fine selection of articles from good scholars with various\ndisciplinary backgrounds, university affiliations, and track records. In this invited\nForum piece, I first highlight the main findings from each contribution in order to\nask what we have collectively learned and what we might still need to know.\nSpecial Issue Review\nThe Issue is opened by the editors, Kentmen-Cin and Erisen (2017). They cut right\nto the core of the Special Issue with their overview and critical assessment of\nprevious scholarship of the relationship between anti-immigration attitudes and\nanti-EU attitudes. They make two important recommendations: first, that scholars\nemploy a broader variety of methods and designs when trying to disentangle these\nrelationships, and second, that scholars differentiate more between groups within\nlarger immigrant populations. While it is hard to disagree with the first recommen-\ndation which is likely to make the empirical base stronger and open for more\nnuance, the latter recommendation is important and noteworthy, because it sug-\ngests a shift away from a more logic pursued in previous studies where citizens'\ngeneral tendency to categorize others as out-groups, ceteris paribus, was leading\n(e.g. Sniderman et al., 2000). They reiterate the more general point that attitudes\ntoward immigrants are a key explanatory factor in analyses of support or oppos-\nition for European integration. But they suggest that `there is a need to redesign\nexisting survey questions to identify the specific cultural and economic threats\nposed by immigrants and the nature of public interaction with them'. Two obser-\nvations are in place here: It is hard not be to in favor of the unpacking and\ndisentangling threat perceptions. That said, this claim also puts the burden on\nthem and likeminded scholars to provide solid, systematic, empirical evidence to\nshow not only that differences matter but also that catch all measures perform sub-\noptimally. In the absence of such evidence, some might still be led to believe that\ngeneral threat perceptions and general out-group categorizations are most\ninformative.\nThe second article, by Azrout and Wojcieszak (2017), takes on one of the open-\ning article's recommendation in their specific example of how anti-immigrant sen-\ntiments influence attitudes toward the European Union. They show how EU\nattitudes are predicted by attitudes toward specific immigrant groups that are sali-\nent to specific EU policies. They look at attitudes toward two distinct immigrant\ngroups, Muslims and Poles, in relation to two different policy dimensions, the\nstrengthening of EU integration and potential Turkish EU membership. The\nauthors first corroborate extant research, showing that anti-immigrant attitudes\nindeed explain opposition toward both further integration and Turkey's member-\nship. This finding is consistent \u00ad see above \u00ad with arguments that people's general\ntendency to categorize others as out-groups increases one's opposition toward the\nEU (Sniderman et al., 2000). In their words, `disliking immigrants in general makes\npeople more likely to oppose both policies'. However, and very importantly, the\naddition of group-specific attitudes decreased the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes.\nConsequently, although partially, the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes may be\nexplained by the general tendency to categorize, a substantial part is explained\nby group-specific attitudes. Albeit based on a comparison of two very heteroge-\nneous groups (Poles vs Muslims) this `punch line' is the main contribution of the\narticle.\nThe third article, also by the Special Issue guest editors, Erisen and Kentmen-\nCin (2017), addresses how different types of tolerance and perceived threat affect\nopinions about the EU immigration policy in Germany and the Netherlands. They\ndistinguish social and political tolerance, and sociotropic and personal threats from\nMuslim immigrants and assess how these influence EU citizens' beliefs that immi-\ngration is one of the most important issues facing the EU. Using experiments, in\nwhich the religion of the immigrant, level of perceived threat and type of tolerance\nare manipulated, they examine how people's attitudes on immigration policies are\naffected. It is very good to augment the evidence in the Special Issue, mostly\nstemming from survey-based research, with experiments offering additional lever-\nage in the causal claims.\nThe fourth article is by Steenbergen and Siczek (2017). They focus on the sup-\nport for right-wing populist parties (in particular the United Kingdom\nIndependence Party (UKIP)) and vote intention in the Brexit referendum. Their\nstarting point is that \u00ad in the wake of globalization \u00ad individuals' risk propensity\nrelates to support for these parties. Using survey data from the UK, they show how\n`risk' as a personality trait relates to support for the UKIP and intentions to vote\nfor a Brexit. They conclude that there is evidence of this psychological impact, both\ndirectly and indirectly, on UKIP and Brexit voting. The proposition of `risk pro-\npensity' as a key concept is interesting and important, and, at the same time, begs\nthe question how this finding relates to other explanations for such political pref-\nerences, including the relationship with other personality traits which have been\nfound to relate to both EU attitudes (e.g. Bakker and de Vreese, 2016; Tillman,\nThe next article by Erisen (2017) goes beyond the impact of attitudes towards\nimmigration and national identity attachment on the one hand, on EU atti-\ntudes on the other. Instead, the focus is on how non-EU immigration heritage\naffects European identification. Using Eurobarometer (EB) data, it looks at the\ndegree of European identification of `those with a first generation non-EU\nimmigration heritage [compared] to that of EU country natives'. The punch\nline, that anti-discrimination policies are conducive for immigrants' identification\nwith nation states rather than the EU, is both theoretically interesting and great\nimportance in current debates and policy discussions on immigration and\nintegration.\nThe sixth and final article is written by Lubbers and Coenders (2017).\nThey unpack the role of nationalism as part of the voting for the radical right.\nUsing European Value surveys, they point out that especially those who `value\nancestry as relevant for nationhood' are more likely to vote for the radical right.\nTheir observation, although not cast directly in the light of scholarship on popu-\nlism, bears a great relevance for this work by putting central the notion of a\nhomeland based in-group.\nNew items on the research agenda\nCollectively, this Special Issue provides timely new insights in the intricate rela-\ntionship between immigration attitudes, EU attitudes, and (right wing) voting.\nThere is a strong degree of consistency of findings with extant research, but a\ncouple of articles offer evidence that takes this scholarship in a new and more\nnuanced direction. As a Special Issue, the value is primarily within the different\narticles and less so across the articles where more attention could have been paid to\narticulating a coherent and novel, overarching theoretical framework. As this\nimportant research agenda moves forward, at least the following points merit\nattention: (a) differentiation in EU attitudes, (b) the role of national political\nelites, (c) the changing communications environment, and (d) renewed attention\nfor the role of religion and religious attitudes.\nFirst of all, it is noteworthy that virtually all articles in the Special Issue rely,\nwhen addressing, on different measures of EU attitudes. This is not uncommon for\nsuch research which is inhibited by either relying on very limited, longitudinal\nsurvey data (like EB, ESS, EVS) or specific items used in specific studies. As\nargued at length elsewhere (Boomgaarden et al., 2011), it is imperative that we\ntreat EU attitudes as multi-dimensional. For some citizens, EU attitudes might\nconverge, but for many there are fundamental differences between evaluating,\nsay, the utilitarian aspects of EU membership, the performance of EU institutions\nor the degree of identification with the EU. Such nuances are important to capture\nalso to better understand the reluctance and ambivalence held by many citizens.\nThese nuances, also when it comes to the topic of Turkish membership (see Azrout\net al., 2012), are imperative for moving our understanding of EU attitudes forward\nin an era where the EU itself is very different from what is was a decade ago. In the\nsame vein, there is a need to re-consider both long-standing explanations for EU\nattitudes such as left-right preferences (van Elsas and van der Brug, 2015) and the\ninfluence of disruptive events such as the financial and debt crises (Serricchio et al.,\n2013). Finally, EU attitudes may indeed be increasingly important for understand-\ning citizens' voting behavior, not only in European Parliament elections (Hobolt\nand de Vries, 2016) and in referendums on EU issues (Schuck and de Vreese, 2008),\nbut even in national elections (de Vries and Hobolt, 2016).\nSecond, the Special Issue touches, at least indirectly, on the important role that\npolitical elites play. More studies are needed that disentangle how EU attitudes\nconverge with other (economic or immigration) attitudes (see e.g. Otjes and\nKatsanidou, 2016), both amongst citizens and elites. Equally importantly we also\nneed to assess how issues of European integration are addressed in conjunction\nwith other concerns like immigration and globalization by different political elites\nto better understand the changing dynamic of the political supply side. Has the\n`sleeping giant' (van der Eijk and Franklin, 2007) been woken up or has the EU\ndiscussion become interwoven and aligned with other salient topics?\nThird, in an age where the dynamics between immigration attitudes, EU atti-\ntudes, and voting behavior is changing, we need to pay more attention to the\ninformation environment. Media coverage has been widely demonstrated to\naffect public attitudes towards the EU (see e.g. de Vreese et al., 2016), but it is\nhigh time to also assess the role and interplay of new, online, and social media.\nEspecially, the latter is feared to create possible filter bubbles in which citizens are\neither shielded or actively shying away from information about such important\ntopics or being exposed mostly to like-minded information, potentially in a dispro-\nportionate fashion. Several of the articles in this Special Issue touch on topics (e.g.\nBrexit, Turkish membership) whether other scholarship has pointed to the media\nand the communication environment as important factors.\nFourth and finally, the Special Issue also calls attention to the role of religion.\nReligion plays out both in terms of actual religious attachments, degree of religious\nbehavior, and (in)tolerance towards other religions. Previously, Hobolt et al. (2011)\nshowed how religious intolerance affects EU attitudes and support for\nTurkish EU membership. This Issue is a reminder of including this factor in\nfuture research.\nIn sum, the Special Issue's renewed attention for anti-immigration attitudes and\nEU attitudes, and the several adjacent questions pertaining to, e.g. globalization,\npopulism, and religion and actors such as the political elites and the media, is most\nwelcomed. In this respect, the Special Issue is a scholarly home run in terms of\ntiming.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication\nof this article.\nReferences\nAzrout R and Wojcieszak ME (2017) Attitudes toward specific religious and national out-\ngroups, and support for EU policies.
