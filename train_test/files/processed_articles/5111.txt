    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople with traits that are attractive on the mating market are better able to pursue their preferred mating strategy. Men who are\nrelatively tall may be preferred by women because taller height is a cue to dominance, social status, access to resources, and\nheritable fitness, leading them to have more mating opportunities and sex partners. We examined height, education, age, ethnicity,\nand body mass index (BMI) as predictors of sexual history among heterosexual men and women (N \u00bc 60,058). The linear and\ncurvilinear associations between self-reported height and sex partner number were small for men when controlling for education,\nBMI, and ethnicity (linear b \u00bc .05; curvilinear b \u00bc \u00c0.03). The mean and median number of sex partners for men of different heights\nwere ``overweight'' reported a higher mean and median number of sex partners than men with other body masses. The results for\nmen suggested limited variation in reported sex partner number across most of the height continuum, but that very short men\nreport fewer partners than other men.\n",

Mate choice is a two-way process. Who a person enters\ninto a relationship with depends on (a) what traits that person\nprefers and (b) what traits potential partners prefer. If a person\npossesses preferred traits, then that person has a strong bargain-\ning hand when seeking a mate. If that person possesses\nnonpreferred traits, then that person has a weak bargaining\nhand. People with more attractive traits are in a better position\nto pursue their preferred mating strategy on the mating market.\nThis mating market perspective can explain how the mate pre-\nferences of one sex dictate the bargaining hands and mating\nstrategies of members of the other sex.\nBoth men and women pursue short-term and long-term mat-\ning strategies, but men are more open than women to sexual\nencounters across a wide variety of contexts (Buss & Schmitt,\nemerge, in part, due to the fact that men have higher reproduc-\ntive potential and lower obligatory biological costs associated\n1 Crean School of Health Sciences, Chapman University, Orange, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid A.

The preferred mating strat-\negy, therefore, may vary systematically by gender.\nFor many men, pursuing short-term strategies or a combi-\nnation of short-term and long-term strategies may be the pre-\nferred mating strategy. Not all men, however, can successfully\npursue short-term strategies. Strategic pluralism theory sug-\ngests that men who are in good condition and possess attractive\ntraits are better able to pursue short-term mating opportunities\nand will, therefore, have more sex partners (Gangestad &\nSimpson, 2000). For example, men who are more muscular\nthan average are rated more attractive and report more sex\npartners, brief sexual affairs, and affairs with mated women\nUsing evolutionary mating market perspectives, it is diffi-\ncult to make a priori predictions regarding the links between\nattractiveness and sexual behavior for women. Very attractive\nwomen are in the best position to be particularly choosy and to\nsecure an attractive long-term partner who possesses resources,\nkindness, and willingness to invest in her and her offspring,\nleading to attractive women having fewer sexual partners. On\nthe other hand, if attractive women receive the most solicita-\ntions for mating, this could lead to attractive women having\nmore partners. Past research has found that self-rated attrac-\ntiveness is weakly correlated with sexual experience for\nwomen, but ratings of women's attractiveness by independent\njudges do not generally correlate with sexual history (for a brief\nWhat traits are attractive to men and women that might\nimpact their desirability on the mating market and thus may\nultimately impact their sexual experiences and dating opportu-\nnities? Here we focus on height and body mass and provide\nexplanations for why people may attend to these aspects of the\nbody when selecting mates.\nTheoretical Perspectives on Preferences for Relatively Tall\nMen\nWomen may prefer relatively tall men because tall height is a\ncue to indirect (genetic) benefits or because of the direct ben-\nefits that taller men may provide. Alternatively, or in addition,\ntaller men may be more effective in intrasexual competition,\nwhich can result in more mating opportunities (for a review,\nsee Stulp & Barrett, 2014). Finally, there are also likely socio-\ncultural factors that increase women's preferences for rela-\ntively taller men.\nMate choice for indirect benefits. Indirect benefits are conferred to\noffspring of females through genetic inheritance. Some traits\ncan only be produced by men with certain heritable qualities,\nresistance to disease, and low genetic mutation loads (Kaplan\n& Gangestad, 2005; Kokko, Brooks, Jennions, & Morley,\nadvantage if tall stature is a cue that the male was in good\ncondition or if developing taller stature would enhance the\nattractiveness or reproductive success of offspring. Height\nitself is highly heritable, with estimates placing heritability\nMcEvoy & Visscher, 2009; Silventoinen, Kaprio, Lahelma,\nViken, & Rose, 2001; Silventoinen, Krueger, Bouchard,\nKaprio, & McGue, 2004). Women who chose taller men as\nmates could directly pass this propensity for taller height to\noffspring, and, therefore, women prefer taller men as mates.\nMate selection for direct benefits. In contrast to indirect benefits,\nselection for direct benefits refers to the idea that females\nchoose a mate because he possesses a trait that directly\nincreases her health, survival, or lifetime reproductive output.\nThis can include selection of males who provide superior\nresources, offer more parental care, or otherwise reduce female\nreproductive costs (Kokko et al., 2003). Height may be a par-\nticularly useful cue of access to resources and socioeconomic\nRanasinghe et al., 2011). Women who preferred tall men as\nmates could have experienced greater reproductive success\nbecause of the direct benefits that taller men may have been\nable to provide. These benefits could include resources and\nprotection in either a short-term or a long-term mating context,\nand, thus, women may prefer taller men as mates (or may\nhappen to choose taller men as mates when they exercise their\npreferences for access to resources or socioeconomic status).\nIntrasexual competition. Although much research in evolutionary\npsychology has focused on the importance of female choice\n(e.g., Frederick, Reynolds, & Fisher, 2013; Gallup & Frederick,\nimportant role in human mating (Puts, 2010). Taller men may\nbe better able to intimidate rivals and thus gain control of\nresources or access to mates. Taller men are viewed as more\ndominant, more masculine, and better fighters. They are also\nmore likely to be stronger, able to strike with greater force, hold\npositions of authority in the workplace, be less sensitive to cues\nof dominance in other men, be perceived as leaders, and exhibit\ngreater aggression and interpersonal dominance (for reviews,\nSocial norms. One explanation for women's preferences for tal-\nler men is that cultural transmission of certain ideals and beha-\nviors is internalized by men and women, in particular, cultures.\nMen are expected to display masculine traits, and tallness may\nbe perceived as a social cue of masculinity. If a man is shorter\nthan his partner, this may cause people to view the man as less\nmasculine and the woman as less feminine and lead to social\nstigma. Past research has only found weak correlations, how-\never, between women's preferences for taller men and endor-\nsement of male gender roles and norms (Salska et al., 2008;\nPreferences for Male Height\nConsistent with multiple evolutionary perspectives, height is\nconsidered an important feature of male attractiveness (for a\nreview, see Courtiol, Raymond, Godelle, & Ferdy, 2010). In\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\ntwo studies, women were more likely than men to indicate that\nheight matters when selecting a mate (Salska et al., 2008;\nYancey & Emerson, 2014), and taller men were more likely\nto be selected for dates at speed dating events (Kurzban &\nWeeden, 2005). In a study of personal advertisements, rela-\ntively short men were less likely to be contacted than other\nmen. Tall men, however, did not appear to have an advantage\nover medium height men (Pawlowski & Koziel, 2002). Past\nresearch has found that taller men were more likely than shorter\nmen to find a long-term partner and to have multiple long-term\npartners (Nettle, 2002a). Men who are shorter than average\nappear to be at a disadvantage on the mating market: Their\npartners are more likely to be less healthy, have lower incomes\nand education, and have higher body mass index (BMI; Stulp,\nPreferences for taller men, however, are not universal across\nall women within a culture or across cultures. One study found\nthat among the Himba of northern Namibia, 52% of women\npreferred a taller partner, 34% of women preferred a partner\nof the same height, and 14% preferred a shorter partner\n(Sorokowski, Sorokowska, Fink, & Mberira, 2012). Among the\nDatoga people of Tanzania, only half (52%) of women pre-\nferred a taller partner (Sorokowski & Butovskaya, 2012).\nOne key to many women's preferences is that they tend to\nprefer relatively taller men, not necessarily very tall men\nStulp, Buunk, & Pollet, 2013). The association between height\nand reproductive success across different cultures is frequently\ncurvilinear, with the very shortest men having the fewest chil-\ndren and men in the center of the distribution having the most\n(for a review, see Stulp, Pollet, Verhulst, & Buunk, 2012).\nExtremely tall men are more likely to be excluded from the\ndating pools of shorter women and may have fewer dating\noptions compared with men who are slightly taller than\naverage.\nPreferences for Male Body Mass\nCross-cultural research on preferences for male body mass is\nlimited. In a U.S. sample, very slender and very fat men were\npreferred less than other men (Frederick & Haselton, 2007). In\na study of 41 sites across 26 countries, however, preferences for\nbody fat in men were highly variable (Frederick, Swami, & The\n56 Members of the International Body Project, 2010). In West-\nern contexts, there is a strong curvilinear association between\nBMI (weight/height2) and body satisfaction. Men in the ``nor-\nmal/healthy'' and ``overweight'' categories typically feel most\nsatisfied with their bodies and evaluate their appearance more\npositively, presumably because they are perceived to have a\nhealthy or athletic body-build (Frederick, Forbes, Grigorian, &\n2009). It should be noted that the category overweight is a\nmedical classification and does not necessarily conform to\nperceptions of who is overweight in a social context (e.g.,\nGeorge W. Bush fell in the middle of the overweight range\nPreferences for muscularity are clearer. Men with toned and\nmuscular bodies are featured as prestigious and attractive in\npopular U.S. media (Frederick, Fessler, & Haselton, 2005), are\nrated more attractive than other men (Dixson, Dixson, Bishop,\nick, 2012), and report more sex partners (Frederick & Haselton,\nmuscularity to attract women and to be more successful in\nintrasexual competition (Frederick, Buchanan, et al., 2007).\nMen with very high or low muscularity, however, are rated\nas less attractive than men with moderate muscularity (Freder-\nBoth muscularity and body fat contribute to the overall body\nmass. In the general population, BMI is strongly correlated\nwith body fat percentage. For example, BMI is strongly corre-\nlated with abdominal visceral adipose tissue (range: r \u00bc .61\u00ad\n.69), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (range: r \u00bc .86\u00ad\nassociations of both body fat and muscularity with attractive-\nness are curvilinear (Frederick, Buchanan, et al., 2007; Freder-\nick & Haselton, 2007), and, therefore, we expected a\ncurvilinear association between BMI and number of sex\npartners.\nPreferences for Female Height\nUsing the logic of different evolutionary perspectives, it is less\nclear what height men would prefer in women. On the one\nhand, whereas it may be advantageous for males to allocate\nsignificant resources to developing tall body size in order to\ncompete with rivals and to signal their fitness or social status to\npotential mates, female reproductive success may be enhanced\nby allocating available energy toward other processes such as\nenhancing fertility, pregnancy, lactation, and somatic upkeep\nPollet, & Buunk, 2012). Shorter women also have a larger\npotential dating pool because women typically prefer men who\nare taller than themselves and men typically prefer women who\nare their height or shorter (Salska et al., 2008). Based on this\nlogic, one might expect that shorter women would have more\nmating opportunities.\nOn the other hand, tall female height may be valued to the\nextent that height in women is a cue of access to resources,\nhealthy development, dominance, and high status. Taller\nfemale height may be valuable because taller females may have\nrelatively taller sons who might increase both their and their\nmate's reproductive success. It is clear that in some contexts,\ntall women are viewed as attractive. Prestigious mass media\nmodels, playgirl models, and beauty pageant winners tend to be\ntaller than the average woman (Spitzer, Henderson, & Zivian,\n1999). Taller women may be perceived to be more dominant\nthan shorter women (Boyson, Pryor, & Butler, 1999), have\nhigher social esteem and higher incomes (Judge & Cable,\n2004), and be more satisfied with their height (Lever, Freder-\nick, Laird, & Sadeghi-Azar, 2007). In one speed dating study,\nalthough women preferred men who were 25 cm taller on\nFrederick and Jenkins 3\naverage, men preferred women who were only 7 cm shorter on\naverage (Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, & Verhulst, 2013). Based on\nthese findings, one might expect that taller women might have\nmore mating opportunities, but it is difficult to make any a\npriori predictions regarding the links between height and sexual\nhistory for women.\nPreferences for Female Body Mass\nThe existing research on body mass provides a clearer pic-\nture regarding which female body types are considered most\nattractive. Preferences for body fat level in women vary\nsubstantially across cultures, with relative thinness being\nconsidered most attractive in most industrialized countries\n(Frederick, Forbes, & Berezovskaya, 2008; Gray & Frederick,\n``normal'' range of BMI in industrialized countries are gen-\nerally rated most attractive, and BMI is a particularly strong\npredictor of attractiveness ratings (Swami & Tovee, 2005;\nTov\u00b4\nee, Reinhardt, Emery, & Cornelissen, 1998). In parallel,\nwomen who have higher body masses tend to be less satis-\nfied with their appearance than women with lower body\nmasses (Frederick, Forbes, et al., 2007; Frederick et al.,\n2006). Popular media and news media often promote the\nidea that higher BMI is linked to poorer health, which\ncauses people to have more negative attitudes toward\nwomen (and men) with higher body masses (Saguy, Freder-\nick, & Gruys, 2014). Thus, slender women likely have the\ngreatest bargaining hand in industrialized countries. It is\nunclear, however, whether having a stronger bargaining\nhand and greater attractiveness will lead to more or fewer\nsex partners for women.\nHypotheses and Research Questions\nHypothesis 1: Taller men will report a more extensive sex-\nual history than shorter men (although this association may\nbe curvilinear, given very tall men are not preferred by very\nshort women). If the link between height and sex history is\nstrongly linear across the entire height continuum, even at\nthe high end, this may indicate that other factors than female\nchoice for indirect benefits are leading to more sex partners\namong tall men (e.g., intrasexual competition; direct bene-\nfits such as ability to provide resources). If the association is\nstrongly curvilinear (e.g., inverted U-shaped), this is consis-\ntent with the proposal that women's preferences are dictat-\ning men's mating opportunities.\nHypothesis 2: Men in middle BMI ranges will report a more\nextensive sexual history than underweight or obese men.\nResearch Question: What are the associations between\nheight, BMI, and sexual history for women? We explored\nthese links but were unable to make clear a priori predic-\ntions with the exception that thinner women, who have the\nstrongest bargaining hand, would be less likely to be\nsingle.\nMaterial and Method\nParticipant Recruitment\nWe analyzed the results of an online survey of heterosexual\nThe present study is based on secondary analyses of anon-\nymous data collected via a survey posted on the official website\nof NBC News for 10 days along with other websites (e.g.,\nELLE.com). The study was advertised as the ``ELLE/\nMSNBC.com Sex and Love Survey designed for both men and\nwomen'' in order to attract a diverse group of participants. Only\nparticipants who completed the survey via the MSNBC.com\nportal were included in the analyses.\nMarket research on NBCNews.com (formerly MSNBC.\ncom) shows that at the time of the survey it routinely ranked\namong one of the most popular websites in the United States.\nIts 58-million unique monthly visitors include a broad diversity\nof people in terms of age, income, and political orientation\n(NBCNews.com Media Kit, 2012; note that msnbc.com, the\ngeneral news website, was a different entity than MSNBC\nTV and had substantially different demographics, including\napproximately equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans).\nData sets garnered through this site have been used to examine\nsexual jealousy (Frederick & Fales, 2014), sexual history\n(Fales, Frederick, Garcia, Gildersleeve, Haselton, & Fisher,\nin press), sexual regrets (Galperin et al., 2013), friendship (Gil-\nlespie, Frederick, Harari, & Grov, 2015; Gillespie, Lever, Fre-\nderick, & Royce, 2014), and aspects of body image (Frederick,\nParticipants\n\u00bc\n10). Sexual orientation was determined in response to a ques-\ntion asking participants to identify as heterosexual, bisexual, or\ngay/lesbian. The reported ethnicities were 86% White/Cauca-\nHispanic/Latino(a) (n \u00bc 2,313), 2% Asian/Pacific Islander\n2% preferred not to say (n \u00bc 883). The sample was diverse in\nterms of education, with participants reporting some high\nschool education or less (1%), high school degree (9%),\nsome college or associates degree (35%), college degree\n(36%), and postgraduate degree (19%). We did not collect\ninformation on what country they currently resided in. In\nanother data set collected via this website, however, over\n97% of participants indicated they were living in the United\nStates and 99% reported living in the United States or\nCanada (Frederick, Sandhu, Morse, & Swami, 2015).\nFinally, in one data set participants were asked to indicate\ntheir zip code, and over 95% of participants provided a U.S.\nzip code, with 5% declining to provide a zip code (Gillespie\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nPredictors\nHeight. Participants were asked ``how tall are you'' and were\ngiven a drop-down menu where they could record their height\ntinuous measure of height was used as the predictor variable.\nTo facilitate data presentation, we then conducted a series of\nanalyses where participants were split into six categories con-\nsisting of approximately 3-inch intervals, starting with the\n``average'' category encompassing the U.S. average population\nheight for men and for women +1 inch, and then moving up\nand down in 3-inch categories. Due to the way height was\ndistributed, some of the extreme categories (short women and\nextremely tall men) do not contain precisely 3-inch intervals.\nWe label these categories: very short, short, average, tall,\nvery tall, and extremely tall. For men, these were very short\nBMI.

This variable was dummy coded with Whites as the\nreference group.\nSex History Outcome Measures\nFor convenience, when referring to the collective set of out-\ncome variables, we use the phrase ``sex history variables''\nrather than ``sex history and current relationship variables.''\nNumber of sex partners.

Note that this item does not assess\ninfidelity per se, but rather any instance in which an individual\nhas sex with someone other than their partner (e.g., could\ninclude ``swinging'').\nRelationship status. Participants indicated their current relation-\nship status. The percentage of men and women indicating each\nstatus was not currently dating (9%), dating or seeing more than\none person (3%), dating or seeing one person (17%), living\ntogether but not married (12%), married (54%), or remarried\n(5%). To test whether or not height or BMI predicted the like-\nlihood of being single, people who were not currently dating\nwere coded as 1 and all other participants were coded as 0.\nOverview of Data Analysis Strategy\nRegressions, multicollinearity, and curvilinear relationships. Linear\nregressions were conducted for the continuous sex partner\nnumber variable, and logistic regressions were conducted on\nall of the other outcome measures. Tolerance was high (0.90\u00ad\n1.0) and VIF was low (<2.5) for all analyses, suggesting that\nmulticollinearity was not an issue. All continuous predictor\nvariables were z scored. In all regression analyses, BMI and\nheight were entered simultaneously to examine the linear asso-\nciations between these variables and sexual history, as is com-\nmonly recommended (e.g., Michels, Greenland, & Rosner,\n1998). BMI is one's body mass independent of their height\n(or more specifically, weight per unit of height2), and as a\nresult, height and BMI are essentially uncorrelated (in this\nFrederick and Jenkins 5\nsample, r \u00bc .05 for women and r \u00bc .01 for men). The BMI\nmeasure enables us to directly compare body masses of people\nwith differing heights. Entering BMI and height as predictors\nallows us to examine the effect of having a higher body mass\ngiven a certain height. The interaction term was entered to\ndetermine whether the association between BMI (i.e., weight\nper inch) and number of sex partners differs by height. The\nsquared BMI and height variables were entered as predictors\nto test the curvilinear associations with sexual history.\nOne concern with these data is that BMI might change\nacross the life span, and thus current BMI might differ from\nBMI at the time a person was accruing sex partners or having\nextra-pair sex. In this sample, there was a weak correlation\nbetween BMI and age for men (r \u00bc .13) and women\n(r \u00bc .14). We entered age as a predictor in the model.\nAdditionally, education level may be linked to height, BMI,\nand sexual behavior. We elected to treat education as a con-\ntinuous predictor in order to examine the linear relationship\nbetween increasing education level and sexual history (see\nPasta, 2009). There were weak but statistically significant cor-\nrelations of education to height (men, r \u00bc .04; women, r \u00bc .07)\nand to BMI (men, r \u00bc \u00c0.08; women, r \u00bc \u00c0.11). Finally, eth-\nnicity might covary with BMI, height, and sexual history, and,\nthus, ethnicity was included as a predictor. It is also possible\nthat the link between the predictor variables and the sex history\nvariables varies by ethnicity. Although we had no a priori\nhypotheses regarding ethnic differences, we analyzed the\nresults without any interactions with ethnicity and again with\nall interactions of each predictor with ethnicity (dummy coded\nwith White as the reference group). To conserve space and\nbecause few interactions were statistically significant, we\ndescribe any significant interactions in text rather than present-\ning all 24 interactions for each analysis in the table.\nSkew and kurtosis. Skew and kurtosis were within acceptable\nranges for all variables. The sex partner variable did, however,\nhave a subgroup of individuals scoring relatively high, leading\nthe mean to be higher than the median. We analyzed the results\nonce with the sex partner outcome variable and once with a log-\ntransformed version. The pattern of results did not change, and\nthus we report the results for the nonlog-transformed version.\nWe also report median number of partners and the percentage\nof participants who have more than 5 and more than 14 sex\npartners according to their BMI and height categories.\nBMI and height categorical variables. One-way analyses of var-\niance were conducted to examine the main effects of height\ngroup (six categories) and the two BMI group variables (five\nand nine categories) on number of sex partners for each gender.\nPost hoc least significant difference tests were then conducted\nto examine whether groups differed from the central categories\nfor the height groups, BMI CDC 5, and BMI CDC SPLIT 9\ncategory variables (Table 1).\nStatistical significance and effect size. Our large sample size\nenabled us to detect even miniscule effects. Further, we\nconducted numerous statistical tests, raising the possibility of\nType I errors. As a result, we set the level for determining\nstatistical significance at p < .001. Even with the more stringent\ncriteria for statistical significance, however, correlation (r) and\nb (i.e., standardized coefficient) values as small as .02 were\nstatistically significant when using the full samples of men or\nwomen. Therefore, in addition to reporting statistical signifi-\ncance, we also attend to effect size. There are established rough\nguidelines for interpreting Cohen's d effect sizes as small (.20),\nOverview of data presentation in tables. Table 1 shows the mean\nsex partner number for height and BMI categories in men and\nwomen. Table 2 shows the percentage of participants who had\nmore than 5 sex partners, had more than 14 partners, who\nengaged in extra-pair sex, and who are currently single. Table 3\npresents the linear regression analyses predicting the number of\nsex partners. Table 4 presents the results of logistic regression\nanalyses predicting the dichotomous outcome variables for the\nfull samples of men and women.\nOverview of data presentation in figures. Figure 1 shows the mean\nsex partner number for heterosexual men and women for each\ninch of height containing at least 25 participants. Figure 2\nshows the mean sex partner number for each BMI unit for\nwhich there are at least 25 participants.\nResults\nHypothesis 1: Taller men will report a more extensive sex-\nual history (although this association may be curvilinear).\nMean differences. Contrary to our expectations, as shown in\nTable 1, there was little variation in mean number of sex part-\nners across most of the height continuum. Looking at mean\ndifferences in the number of partners between the tall men and\nother categories, only the very short men differed from tall men\nby an effect size larger than d \u00bc .20, reporting fewer partners\n(d \u00bc \u00c0.22). The mean number of partners for every inch of\nheight can be seen in Figure 1.\nRegressions. Regression analyses examining height as a predic-\ntor found that height was a weak but statistically significant\npredictor of number of sex partners in the overall sample (linear\nb \u00bc .07; curvilinear b \u00bc \u00c0.04), with height being linked to\nhigher sex partner number more so at the lower end of the\nheight continuum than at the higher end (Table 3).

When restricting the\nto sex partners for Black men were similar to other ethnic\ngroups and there was no significant interaction of Black ethni-\ncity with height (p \u00bc .63).\nHeight did not predict history of engaging in extra-pair sex,\nbut there were weak linear and curvilinear associations of\nheight with most of the other categorical sex history variables\n(Table 4). There were no significant interactions with ethnicity.\nHypothesis 2: Men in middle BMI ranges will report a more\nextensive sexual history than underweight or obese men\nMean differences. Consistent with the hypothesis that men in the\nmiddle body mass ranges would have the most partners, over-\nweight men had the highest number of sex partners (median \u00bc\n8, mean \u00bc 12.8; see Table 1). Compared to the overweight\nmen, fewer partners were reported by underweight men (med-\nian \u00bc 4, mean \u00bc 8.2, d \u00bc \u00c0.40) and obese III men (median \u00bc 5,\nmean \u00bc 9.3, d \u00bc \u00c0.30).

Consistent with our expectations, there was a curvi-\nlinear association between BMI and number of sex partners in\nthe overall sample, and technically, the linear association was\nstatistically significant despite the small effect size (linear\nb \u00bc .03; curvilinear b \u00bc \u00c0.10; Table 3). In particular, men\nin the middle BMI ranges had reported having more partners\nthan men at the ends of the distribution. This pattern can be\nseen clearly in Figure 2, where mean number of sex partners is\nplotted for each unit of BMI. There were no significant inter-\nactions with ethnicity.\nThe linear and curvilinear associations of BMI and BMI2\nwere generally weak with the categorical sex history variables,\nwith the exception of likelihood of being single (linear OR \u00bc\nwere more likely to be single, with little variation among over-\nweight\u00admorbidly obese men. There were no significant inter-\nactions with ethnicity.\nResearch Question: What are the associations between\nheight, BMI, and sexual history for women?\nAll other comparisons between tall women and other\nwomen were smaller than d \u00bc .20 in size, except very short\nwomen had fewer partners than tall women (d \u00bc \u00c0.20; Table 1).\nUnderweight women reported the fewest partners (7.8), which\nwere fewer partners than both healthy weight (d \u00bc \u00c0.20) and\nTable 1.

Looking across all other BMI\nCDC and BMI CDC SPLIT categories, the mean number of sex\npartners ranged from 9.2 to 10.6. In regressions, however, all\nassociations were quite weak even when significant (Tables 3\nDiscussion\nKey Findings for Men\nHeight. The existing literature has generally found that rela-\ntively tall men (but not extremely tall men) are consistently\nconsidered more attractive to women (Courtiol et al., 2010;\nmen's reported sexual behavior only partially reinforced the\npreference data. Consistent with the idea that women prefer\nrelatively tall men, the shortest men in the sample reported\nfewer partners than other men. These findings confirm that\nheight is relevant on the mating market. Across most of the\nheight continuum, however, there was little variation in mean\nor median number of reported sex partners. Further, men\nthey had more than 5 partners, had more than 14 partners,\nengaged in extra-pair sex, or were currently single. Given that\nvery tall men may have a smaller dating pool, the lack of\ndownturn among taller men in number of sex partners may\nindicate that these males are successfully using intrasexual\ncompetition or direct benefits to obtain more mating opportu-\nnities, a point future research may clarify.\nThe relatively limited variation in sex partner number for\nmen across much of the height continuum is difficult to\nexplain. Research on other traits generally considered attractive\nto women has found that men with these traits have more sex\npartners (e.g., muscularity; Frederick & Haselton, 2007; Lassek\n& Gaulin, 2009). One possibility is that women may prefer\nrelatively tall height, but other factors more strongly dictate\nsexual behavior. Research on the relative importance women\nplace on height versus other traits would clarify this matter.\nThe existing research, however, suggests that height is an\nimportant component of women's mate preferences: One study\nTable 2.

It is possible that for most women there is a certain\nminimal threshold of height, after which they will consider a\nmale as a potential sex partner, and thus men above that height\nend up with similar numbers of sex partners (e.g., Salska et al.,\n2008). Finally, if relatively taller men are chosen more often as\nlong-term partners, this may reduce the total number of sex\npartners they have time or ability to pursue. Future research\ncan determine if the patterns found in this study are replicable.\nBody mass. Men in the normal and overweight categories\nreported the highest number of sex partners and engaged in\nextra-pair sex more often than men in the underweight or obese\ncategories. As previously mentioned, it may be the men in the\nnormal and overweight categories who are perceived to be the\nmost athletic, healthy, powerful, or muscular, and previous\nresearch has shown that men in these middle BMI ranges (nor-\nmal/healthy and overweight) feel most confident in their bodies\net al., 2009). Although it might be initially surprising that over-\nweight men reported the highest number of partners, it is\nimportant to note that the medical classification overweight\ndoes not necessarily map onto social perceptions of who is\noverweight. Our findings suggest that possessing this body\ntype, or associated traits (e.g., confidence), may translate to\nthese men having higher numbers of sex partners.\nKey Findings for Women\nHeight. Our examination of the relationships between height\nand sex partner number for women was exploratory. These\nanalyses generally revealed no associations or very weak\nassociations between height and sexual history. Very short\nwomen reported fewer partners compared to tall women\n(although this effect size was small).\nBody mass. Generally speaking, there was little variation in the\nnumber of sex partners for women of differing body masses.\nUnderweight women, however, reported fewer partners than\nother women. This parallels the finding that underweight men\nhad fewer partners as well. Very slender women may be highly\ndissatisfied with their weight and be suffering from anorexia\nand thus motivated to not expose their bodies. Additionally,\nhowever, being in the underweight category is associated with\nrelatively high mortality rate (Flegal, Graubard, Williamson, &\nGail, 2005). It is also possible that underweight individuals\nmay be more likely to be suffering from a variety of ailments\nand wasting diseases that cause weight loss and thus may have\nfewer sex partners because they are more likely to be dealing\nwith serious health issues. Alternatively, attractiveness may\nplay a role here: Very slender women may be highly attractive\n(Kos\n\u00b4cin\n\u00b4ski, 2013), but attractive women may also be very\nchoosy (Buss & Shackelford, 2008) and, therefore, have fewer\npartners.\nLimitations and Strengths\nThis study provided a unique look at the links between height,\nBMI, and sexual history. Although our sample was unusually\nlarge and diverse, it was not nationally representative. It is\npossible that the survey title ``Sex and Love'' appealed to peo-\nple with more liberal attitudes toward sex. For example, the\nmedian number of sex partners reported in one nationally rep-\nresentative survey of adults aged 30\u00ad44 was around seven\nfemale sexual partners for men and four male sexual partners\nfor women (Mosher, Chandra, & Jones, 2005). The median\nnumber of sex partners in our sample was slightly higher (eight\nfor men and eight for women ages 30\u00ad44). On the other hand,\nthe rates of extra-pair sex in our sample were similar to other\nlarge-scale studies (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). A further issue is\nwhat, precisely, number of sex partners indicates. It is not a\nmeasure of reproductive success and is not a direct measure of\nsexual strategy (e.g., a man with 10 partners may have had\nmultiple partners simultaneously or a series of monogamous\nrelationships). We took number of sex partners to be one rough\nindicator of men's appeal on the mating market, but multiple\nfactors influence number of sex partners (e.g., attractiveness,\nhow coercive a male is, and income).\nA related issue is that some people might purposely misre-\nport answers to key variables in socially desirable ways.\nFurthermore, when reporting number of sex partners, different\npeople might be using different criteria for who counts as a sex\npartner (Brown & Sinclair, 1999; Cecil, Bogart, Wagstaff, Pin-\nkerton, & Abramson, 2002). Men and women may not always\naccurately report their height and/or weight. In a review of 64\nstudies on self-reported versus directly measured height and\nweight, self-reported measures differ only slightly from peo-\nple's actual heights and weights (Gorber, Tremblay, Moher, &\nTable 3. Linear Regression Predicting Number of Sex Partners.\nMen\nMen with\ninteractions Women\nWomen with\ninteractions\nb b b b\nNote. BMI \u00bc body mass index. For the ethnicity variable, White men were used\nas the reference group. For the analyses where the interactions between\nethnicity and the other predictors were examined, none of 24 interactions\nterms were significant at the p < .001 level and thus are not shown.\nFrederick and Jenkins 9\nGorber, 2007). Consistent with these findings, a study of over\n4,000 British men and women found that self-reported and\nmeasured height, weight, and BMI were strongly correlated\n(rs > .90; Spencer, Appleby, Davey, & Key, 2002). Systematic\nbiases in responses across participants, however, could be pro-\nblematic. For example, if men who exaggerate their height by\nan inch or so are more likely to exaggerate their number of sex\npartners, then this study may overestimate the strength of the\nFigure 1.

The 24 interaction terms between ethnicity\nand the other variables were included in the analyses but are not shown due to the fact that few interactions were significant and adding the interactions did not\nnotably increase the percentage of variance explained.\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\nassociation between height and number of sex partners. Alter-\nnatively, if shorter men are more likely to overestimate their\nnumber of sex partners, this would cause association between\nheight and sex partner number to be underestimated. Replicat-\ning this research with measured height and weight is a key\nfuture direction. The research was also limited to a U.S. sam-\nple, and the distribution of BMIs in hunter-gatherer and hunter-\nhorticulturalist societies likely differs substantially from the\nUnited States, making it important to examine how body fat\ndistribution and height are related to sexual behavior in less\nindustrialized settings.\nA further limitation is that we only had reports of current\nweight from participants. Some people may experience sub-\nstantial fluctuations in weight, and, therefore, their current\nweight may not reflect the weight they had when they were\naccruing sex partners. When examining links to sexual history,\nit would be valuable to also ask participants how many partners\nthey have had recently or while at their current weight.\nThis survey suffered the same limitation that most survey\nresearch encounters: results were derived only from people\nwho chose to participate in the research study. Internet sam-\nples, including ours, tend to include participants who are rela-\ntively more educated and have higher income than the national\npopulation, but they also tend to be more diverse with respect to\ngender, age, socioeconomic status, and geographic region than\nnonprobability samples generated by many traditional data-\ngathering methods (Gosling, Vazire, Srivastava, & John,\n2004). Selection biases introduced by differential access to the\nInternet have been minimized, as Internet use has grown more\ncommonplace (Rainie & Horrigan, 2005; U.S. Census Bureau,\n2012). Given the broad-based appeal of the news website, we\nwere provided with a demographically diverse sample and an\nopportunity to compare men and women who differed substan-\ntially on this study's variables of interest. Surveys can be\ncompleted with ease from the privacy of respondents' homes\nor workplaces, thereby reaching individuals who would not\notherwise have the opportunity to participate in research stud-\nies. Our large sample enabled us to examine the data not only\nby broad categories but also in detail by individual height in\ninches and across the entire BMI continuum.\nConclusion\nHeight and body mass are traits that may be useful cues about\nhealth, social status, and heritable fitness. These qualities are\nvalued by women, suggesting that tall men would have more\nsex partners, whereas short men would have fewer. Surpris-\ningly, however, taller men did not report substantially more\nsex partners than men other than very short men. This was\nsurprising, given women's clear preferences for relatively taller\nmen in Western cultures. These findings raise interesting ques-\ntions regarding the mating strategies of men with average to\nsomewhat below average heights, and how well-stated prefer-\nences for height map on to actual sexual behavior.\n"
