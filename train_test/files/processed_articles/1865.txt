This study investigated whether this reflects a\ndifference in the prevalence of earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other mechanisms. CKD prevalence in\nNorway was estimated from the population-based Health Survey of Nord-Trondelag County (HUNT II), which included\nanalysis used gender-specific cutoffs in estimating persistent albuminuria for CKD stages 1 and 2. ESRD rates and other\nrelevant data were extracted from national registries. Total CKD prevalence in Norway was 10.2% (SE 0.5): CKD stage 1 (GFR\nrelative risk for progression from CKD stages 3 or 4 to ESRD in US white patients compared with Norwegian patients was 2.5.\nThis was only modestly modified by adjustment for age, gender, and diabetes. Age and GFR at start of dialysis were similar,\nhypertension and cardiovascular mortality in the populations were comparable, but US white patients were referred later to\na nephrologist and had higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes. In conclusion, CKD prevalence in Norway was similar to\nthat in the United States, suggesting that lower progression to ESRD rather than a smaller pool of individuals at risk accounts\nfor the lower incidence of ESRD in Norway.\nThere has been a dramatic rise in the number of patients\nwith ESRD in both Europe and North America during\nthe past decades. There is significant disparity, how-\never, in ESRD incidence rates between the two continents:\nIncidence rates are three times higher in the United States\ncompared with Norway and Great Britain (1,2). Data on the\nprevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Europe are\nlimited, making it unclear whether the higher ESRD incidence\nin the United States reflects a higher burden of all stages of\nThe relationship between the prevalence of earlier stages of\nCKD and the incidence of ESRD is complex (5\u00ad9): US CKD\nprevalence has been relatively stable in the past decade,\nwhereas ESRD incidence has increased significantly, and US\nblack patients have a three times higher incidence of ESRD\ndespite similar prevalences of CKD. This can be due to differ-\nences in other mechanisms, such as more rapid progression or\ngreater initiation of dialysis. Early stages of CKD also result in\na higher risk for complications, cardiovascular disease, and\nmortality, which pose a larger absolute risk than ESRD. Fur-\nthermore, identifying and treating individuals with early stages\nof CKD is increasingly proposed for prevention of ESRD and\ncardiovascular disease (9,10). This requires solid documenta-\ntion of a high prevalence of preclinical disease. Thus far, Euro-\npean studies on CKD prevalence have been hampered by se-\nlection bias or incomplete data for defining CKD stages (11\u00ad13).\nTherefore, there is a need for more information on the prev-\nalence of CKD in European populations as well as a better\nunderstanding of the relationship of CKD prevalence to ESRD\nincidence. The second Health Survey of Nord-Trondelag\nCounty (HUNT II) is a large, population-based, cross-sectional\nstudy that was conducted in central Norway with a high par-\nticipation rate (14). We used HUNT II data to assess the prev-\nalence of CKD using calibrated serum creatinine values and\nrepeated measurements of albuminuria. Combining these prev-\nalence estimates with available information on ESRD, health\nPublished online ahead of print.

The survey comprised an extensive questionnaire and a\nbrief clinical examination, including analysis of serum creatinine in all\nparticipants and urine albumin in a subgroup. The population in Nord-\nTrondelag is stable (net out migration of 0.3% per year) and ethnically\nhomogeneous (97% white). Nord-Trondelag County is located in cen-\ntral Norway, and it is representative regarding geography, economy,\nindustry, morbidity, and total and cardiovascular mortality (15). The\nage and gender distribution of Nord-Trondelag County is identical to\nNorway, but the participation rate in HUNT II was strongly age de-\npendent. Participation rate was highest in the age group 60 to 69 yr\n(86%) and declined toward 50% in the youngest as well as the oldest\nage groups (14). A more detailed description on objectives, contents,\nand methods (including reasons for nonparticipation) in HUNT II has\nbeen given elsewhere (14). All participants signed an informed consent,\nand additional permissions were obtained from the Regional Ethics\nReview Committee and the National Data Inspectorate.\nData Collected\nThe participants self-reported health status, family history, socioeco-\nnomic status, and medication use. The clinical examination included\nmeasurement of height, weight, and BP. Three consecutive standard-\nized BP measurements were recorded in the sitting position using an\nautomatic oscillometric method (Dinamap 845XT; Criticon, Tampa, FL).\nParticipants were classified as hypertensive when the mean of the two\nlast measurements was 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic or\nwhen they reported taking antihypertensive medication (16). Partici-\npants were classified as having diabetes when they reported having\ndiabetes (\"sugar disease\") or when they were found to have venous\nLaboratory Investigations\nBlood was drawn, often in the nonfasting state, from all participants,\nand fresh serum and urine samples were analyzed within 2 d at the\nCentral Laboratory of Levanger Hospital on a Hitachi 911 Autoanalyzer\n(Mito, Japan). Glucose was measured by means of an enzymatic hex-\nokinase method, cholesterol by an enzymatic calorimetric cholesteroles-\nterase method, and serum creatinine by a kinetic Jaffe method with\nwater blank using reagents from Roche (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,\nGermany). Day-to-day coefficients of variation were 1 to 2% for all\nanalyses. There was no drift in mean serum creatinine over time when\nthe entire population was examined (0.001 mg/dl per month [0.1\nmol/L]). Local serum creatinine cutoffs for abnormality (97.5th per-\nmol/L) for men.\nA 5% random sample of the total population was included for\nscreening of albuminuria. Participants delivered urine samples for\nanalysis on three consecutive mornings, and those who reported urine\ninfection during the previous week or menstruation at time of collec-\ntion were excluded. Urine albumin was measured by an immunotur-\nbidimetric method (anti-human serum albumin; Dako AS, Glostrup,\nDenmark), and urine creatinine was measured with the Jaffe\n\u00b4 method.\nThe albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was used as an expression for\nurine albumin excretion. We used similar cutoffs as in previous analysis\nof the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) study (18): Participants with two or three ACR determi-\nas having persistent microalbuminuria, and participants with one or\nmore samples above the microalbuminuric range were classified as\nhaving macroalbuminuria.\nGFR Estimation\nGFR was estimated with the new re-expressed four-variable Modifi-\ncation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula for isotope dilution\nmass spectrometry (IDMS) traceable serum creatinine values: GFR \nblack) (19).

Two hundred samples from the\nHUNT II study were thawed and reanalyzed to ensure stability of the\n 0.994), and a recalibration of the Jaffe assay in HUNT II to the\nenzymatic method was established: Serum creatinine (mg/dl, enzy-\nmatic)  0.31  1.11  serum creatinine (mg/dl, Jaffe). This enzy-\nmatic method was the same as used for recalibrating the original\nMDRD creatinine values to the IDMS level (19), and the method also\nwas found to be comparable to the IDMS level in the Nordic Reference\nInterval Project (20). The resulting GFR estimates also were found to be\nunbiased at all ages in the general population (21).\nTo unmask analytical bias in our comparisons of the HUNT II and\nNHANES III studies, we also compared estimated GFR (eGFR) in a\nsubgroup of healthy, low-risk participants in HUNT II with a corre-\nsponding group in NHANES III. Participants who were included ful-\nfilled the criteria that would make them eligible for kidney donation:\nNo hypertension, no diabetes, no macroalbuminuria, good or excellent\ngeneral health, and a normal serum creatinine. For all age groups (10\nyr), mean GFR differed by 0 to 3 ml/min per 1.73 m2, indicating\nminimal calibration bias between the two studies. Additional analyses\nwere performed with the original four-variable MDRD formula (22)\nwith an indirect recalibration of our creatinine values to the same level\nas used when developing the MDRD formula (23). This indicated a 3-\nto 7-ml/min per 1.73 m2 difference between the two studies; we there-\nfore used the new MDRD formula for analysis unless otherwise stated.\nStatistical Analyses\neither macroalbuminuria or persistent microalbuminuria.

Participants with stage 5 CKD\nwere excluded because of the small number of participants, and non-\nparticipation rates caused by related illness would be expected to be\nparticularly high, biasing downward these prevalence estimates. Mi-\ncroalbuminuria was defined using gender-specific cutoffs in the pri-\nmary analysis with additional results presented for non\u00adgender-spe-\ncific cutoffs.\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0.1 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize vari-\nables, to calculate prevalence estimates, and for stratification of the\nHUNT II data. When odds ratios (OR) in various strata were homoge-\nneous, the Mantel-Haenszel common OR estimate was used. A logistic\nregression model for prevalence of CKD stages 3 to 4 was fitted to the\ndata to predict prevalence in various subgroups. Linearity in age was\nchecked, and significant interactions were accounted for by using sep-\narate models.\nHUNT prevalence estimates were age and gender standardized by the\n(24). US prevalence estimates were obtained from the published literature\n(6,25), with the exception of some subgroup analyses that were obtained\ndirectly from the authors (J.C. and B.C.A., personal communication, Feb-\nruary 2005). An ecologic estimate for risk for progression from CKD stages\n3 or 4 to ESRD was calculated by dividing the annual ESRD incidence rate\namong individuals who were older than 20 yr by the number of patients\nwho had CKD and were at risk.\nResults\nParticipants in HUNT II had a mean age of 50.2 yr, and 10.0%\nwere 75 yr or older.

The incidence rate ratio for US white individuals to\ngives the risk for progression from CKD stages 3 or 4 to ESRD\nfor adult US white individuals and Norwegians stratified by\nage, gender, and diabetes status. The risk for progression in\ngeneral was higher for US white individuals than for Norwe-\ngians. Every year, there are 61 new ESRD patients in the United\nstages 3 to 4. Adjusting for age, gender, and diabetes only\nmodestly affected the increased risk in US white individuals.\nUS white patients without diabetes had 2.0 times higher risk for\nreaching ESRD, and the relative risk was 2.8, even higher,\namong patients with diabetes.\nTable 5 shows characteristics of incident patients who started\nESRD treatment in Norway and the United States. Incidence\nrates of ESRD that was caused by diabetes and hypertension\nwere much lower in Norway compared with US white patients,\nwhereas the incidence of ESRD that was not related to these\nfactors was similar. Mean eGFR at start of ESRD treatment was\nequal, and similar proportions of older patients and those with\ndisabilities were included. Norwegians were referred earlier to\na nephrologist, and more had an adequate number of predialy-\nsis visits. More Norwegian patients were treated with erythro-\npoietin, and they started dialysis with higher hemoglobin and\nalbumin levels. More Norwegian patients had a kidney trans-\nplant as their first treatment, and more patients had an arterio-\nvenous fistula as their first access. Data regarding economy and\ngeneral population characteristics of importance for the inci-\ndence of ESRD are given in Table 6. Income per capita were\nsimilar in the two countries, but significant differences in the\nproportion living in poverty and without health insurance or\nlacking functional literacy skills were present. Diabetes and\nobesity were much more prevalent in the United States,\nwhereas the proportion of people who were on antihyperten-\nsive treatment was similar. Mortality rates from ischemic heart\ndisease, one of the leading causes of death in the general\npopulation and among patients with CKD and ESRD, were\nsimilar.\nDiscussion\nThis large, population-based study found the overall CKD\nprevalence to be 10.2% in Norway, close to the prevalence in\nthe United States, with similar estimates even for severe CKD\ntimes lower incidence of ESRD in Norway than in US white\npatients. Stratification by race, gender, age, hypertension, and\ndiabetes indicates that within each of these factors, the preva-\nlence of CKD is similar between the two countries, whereas the\nrisk for ESRD among individuals with CKD is markedly higher\nin the United States than in Norway. The ESRD to CKD ratio\nwas nearly two-fold higher in the United States than in Norway\nat age 60 yr and three-fold higher at older ages. These eco-\nlogic data, although subject to bias, indicate that the higher risk\nfor ESRD in the United States compared with Norway is not\ndue to a markedly higher prevalence of CKD but a higher rate\nof progression from CKD to treated ESRD.\nThe risk for starting ESRD treatment is a combination of\nsurviving competing causes of death, reaching kidney failure,\nbeing offered renal replacement therapy, and accepting this\ntherapy. This study cannot dissect the relative contributions of\nthese factors, but national data are informative in considering\nthese aspects. Overall cardiovascular mortality, the leading\ncause of death in both countries, is similar, and life expectancy\nin Norway is higher than that in the United States, suggesting\nthat competing mortality may not be a large factor. Kidney\ndisease progression itself and the role of comorbidity and ac-\ncess to treatment are more difficult to assess. The lower prev-\nalence of diabetes in Norway can explain some of the lower\nprogression to ESRD. However, even among patients with\ndiabetes, US white patients had a much higher risk for progres-\nsion to ESRD. Hypertension, the second established risk factor\nfor progression, was equally prevalent in the two countries.\nAnother difference that could affect progression was the strik-\ning difference in obesity; 4.0% of white participants in the\ncompared with only 0.7% of HUNT II participants. Obesity is\nknown to lead to ESRD through diabetes and hypertension, but\nemerging experimental evidence also indicates that obesity can\ncontribute directly to kidney damage, through a cascade of\nadditional hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory mech-\nanisms as well as by mechanical compression (26\u00ad29). Obesity\nthereby can be an important exacerbating factor, at least in\npatients with preexisting nephropathy or reduced renal mass.\nRatios of ESRD to CKD in this article are based on ecologic\nrather than individual follow-up data, limiting inferences about\nrisk factors for progression.\nPre-ESRD care is increasingly recognized as important for\nreducing ESRD mortality and, at least equally important, in\nFigure 1. Annual incidence of ESRD (per million inhabitants) in\nNorway and the United States.\nslowing progression of CKD and development of ESRD (30,31).\nThe quality of pre-ESRD care has been reported to be subopti-\nmal in the United States (32,33), and several key markers of\npredialysis care in our study indicate differences between the\ntwo countries. Norwegian patients with CKD were referred\nearlier to a nephrologist and had more pre-ESRD visits. As a\nresult, more patients received erythropoietin treatment, and\nthey had a higher hemoglobin level when starting dialysis\ntreatment compared with US white patients. Such treatment is\nincreasingly recognized as potentially important for reducing\nthe progressive loss of remaining nephrons (34\u00ad37). Norwegian\npatients also had higher serum albumin levels, indicating better\nnutritional status (38).\nThe lower incidence rate of ESRD in Norway could be due to\ndifferent acceptance criteria and different indications for start-\ning dialysis and transplantation. Acceptance criteria have be-\ncome broad in Norway, as in most other Western countries. The\nmean age at start of renal replacement therapy was identical for\nNorwegians and US white patients and so was the proportion\nof patients with disabilities. The eGFR level at the start of\ntreatment was similar in the two countries, suggesting similar\ntiming of the start of dialysis. All health services, including\npredialysis treatment as well as ESRD treatment, are free in\nNorway. An active transplantation program has managed to\nkeep the pool of dialysis patients small; 73.1% of prevalent\nESRD patients receive a transplant, median time on the waiting\navailable data do not suggest large differences in treatment\navailability, but quantification of treatment access is difficult.\nFor example, we are not aware of data to allow for comparison\nof the proportion of patients who reach kidney failure but do\nnot start long-term dialysis.\nThe situation for US white versus Norwegians patients are\nsomewhat analogous to US black versus US white patients.\nBlack Americans experience a three times higher incidence of\nESRD compared with white Americans despite similar preva-\nlence of CKD stages 3 to 4. Hsu et al. (8) concluded that this\nprobably is due to different rates of progression. A higher\nprevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and other conventional\nrisk factors as well as lower socioeconomic status explain part\nbut not all of the difference (40). To eliminate the effect of true\nracial differences, we focused on comparing Norwegians with\nUS white patients.\nOur international comparison has a number of limitations.\nThe MDRD formula is known to perform well in patients with\nCKD and low GFR, but its use in populations with higher GFR\nTable 4. US white versus Norwegian patients' relative risk for progression from CKD stages 3 or 4 to ESRDa\nRatio, ESRD\nIncidence/CKD\nPrevalence\nIncreased\nRisk for US\nWhite Patients\nCKD\nper Year\naPrevalence (per 100,000 adults) of CKD stages 3 to 4 is from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nNorwegian Renal Registry (1995 to 1997). Data on patients with diabetes represent CKD or ESRD in patients with diabetes as\nhas shown varying results (41\u00ad43). Errors in eGFR are caused\npartly by calibration differences between the creatinine assay in\nthe study and in the laboratory where the GFR equation was\ndeveloped. This possible problem was addressed in both the\nHUNT and the NHANES analyses (23,25), and the new MDRD\nformula that was used in our analysis seems unbiased in the\nNorwegian population and at all ages (21). Imprecision in eGFR\n60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is not critical, because classification\ninto CKD stages 1 to 2 depends on the presence of proteinuria.\nFinally, methodologic limitations of the MDRD equation likely\nwould apply similarly to the US and Norwegian populations.\nAlthough albuminuria was not measured in all participants in\nHUNT II, ACR was measured in multiple urine samples in a\nlarge random subsample. Both HUNT II and NHANES en-\nrolled a large, representative sample of the general population,\nwith high rates of participation and completion rates, suggest-\ning that the similar prevalence rates of CKD represent true\nsimilarities.\nConclusion\nWe found a high prevalence of CKD (10.2%) in a European\ngeneral population, close to the US prevalence (11.5%). There-\nfore, the much lower incidence of ESRD in Norway compared\nwith US white patients is not explained by a lower prevalence\nof the earlier stages of the disease. National data from Norway\nand the United States show no large differences in competing\nmortality, treatment availability, or timing of the start of dial-\nysis. The difference in risk for ESRD remains large after ac-\ncounting for the lower prevalence of diabetes in Norway com-\npared with the United States. The effects of a lower prevalence\nof obesity as well as earlier referral to a nephrologist before the\nstart of dialysis and national health care system could not be\nquantified. In conclusion, the large difference in ESRD rates\nbetween Norway and the United States lies in the management\nand fate of patients with existing CKD in these two populations\nrather than the prevalence of CKD.\n"
