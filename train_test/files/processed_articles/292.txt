Implications: The association of\ncognitive abilities and literacy has important implica-\ntions for health literacy models and for interventions to\nreduce the impact of low health literacy on health\noutcomes. For example, medication instructions should\nbe designed to reduce comprehension demands on\ngeneral cognitive abilities as well as literacy skills.\nKey Words: Health literacy, Cognitive ability,\nHealth communication, Heart failure\nApproximately half of the adults in the United\nStates have inadequate or marginal functional\nhealth-related literacy, which challenges their ability\nto navigate the health care system. Lower health\nliteracy is associated with poorer health status, less\nhealth care knowledge, poorer self-care abilities\n(e.g., medication adherence), reduced use of pre-\nventive services, and increased hospitalization and\nhealth care costs (Ad Hoc Committee, 1999; DeWalt,\nBerkman, Sheridan, Lohr, & Pignone, 2004; Nielsen-\nBohlman, Panzer, & Kindig, 2004). Thus, it is\nimportant to identify people with less than adequate\nhealth literacy and determine the reasons why this is\nso. We investigated health literacy among middle-\naged and older adults with chronic heart failure\n(CHF), a common chronic illness that requires a\nhigh level of self-care (American Heart Association,\n1999). Effective self-management of CHF may\nimpose heavy demands on health-related literacy.\nMore specifically, we focused on relationships\nbetween health literacy and cognitive abilities to\nbetter understand which skills and abilities are im-\npaired in low-literacy patients. This knowledge, in\nturn, could lead to a more comprehensive model of\nthe antecedents of health literacy and consequences\nfor health care. Such a model would help explain\nassociations between health literacy and demograph-\nic variables such as age and race, which researchers\nhave investigated because of their interest in health\nliteracy as a mediator of differences in health care\nopinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this\npublication are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the\nviews of the National Institutes of Health.

It\norganizes what is already known about correlates\nof health literacy and frames the issues motivating\nour study. Ratzan and Parker (2000, pp. ix) has\ndefined health literacy as the `` . . . capacity to obtain,\nprocess, and understand basic health information\nand services needed to make appropriate health\ndecisions.'' This definition links health literacy, like\nthe broader concept of literacy, to a wide range of\nskills such as comprehension of linguistic, graphic,\nand numeric information (Nielsen-Bohlman et al.).\nAlthough comprehension is central to the concept of\nhealth literacy, investigators rarely use theories of\ncomprehension to analyze this critical concept.\nHealth literacy is related to more general forms of\nliteracy, which is composed of an array of processes\nsuch as recognizing words, accessing word meaning\nrepresentations from long-term memory, analyzing\nsentence structure to combine word meanings into\npropositions (representing the ``idea units'' conveyed\nby clauses), and identifying relationships between\ncurrent and previously read propositions to con-\nstruct a text-level representation (Kintsch, 1998).\nReaders interpret this latter representation in terms\nof knowledge about the world in order to create\na situation model, which represents the situations\ndescribed in the text (Kintsch). The situation model\nlinks language to behavior and determines whether\ncomprehension meets the demands of health care\ncontexts. For example, understanding instructions\nfor taking a diuretic requires relating the instructions\nto knowledge about the medication and illness in\norder to create a plan for taking the medication. It is\nimportant to note that these processes depend on\nspeed of mental processing, working memory, and\nother general cognitive abilities. If processes such as\naccessing word meanings and combining them into\npropositions take more time (e.g., due to age-related\nslowing), then these processes will likely increase\ndemands on working memory and thereby reduce\ncomprehension. We next consider how health\nliteracy relates to demographic, education, and\ncognitive and sensory variables (Figure 1).\nDemographic and Education Variables\nResearchers have found age-related decreases for\nhealth literacy as well as general literacy measures that\nare not fully explained by differences in health status\nWilliams, Davis, Parker, & Weiss, 2002). African\nFigure 1. Preliminary health-realted literacy framework. Construct names are in bold and measures are in italics.

These differences partly reflect\nhealth differences, because African American adults\nare more likely than non-Hispanic White adults to\nhave chronic conditions (Lafata, Pladevall, Divine,\nHeinen, & Philbin, 2004) that compromise cognition\nNumber of years of education often explains large\namounts of variance in health literacy as well as\ngeneral literacy measures (Baker, Gazmararian,\nSchillinger et al., 2002). Education may enhance\nliteracy by systematically imparting comprehension\nstrategies (e.g., drawing inferences) and accelerating\nreading experience by promoting successful engage-\nment with text, which automatizes word recognition\nprocesses and increases the knowledge that supports\nsituation models (Stanovich, West, & Harrison, 1995).\nHowever, number of years of education does not\nfully explain differences in general literacy (e.g.,\nBarnes, Tager, Satariano, & Yaffe, 2004; Manly,\nJacobs, Touradji, Small, & Stern, 2002) or health\nliteracy (Andrus & Roth, 2002). This may reflect the\nfact that the number of school years a person has is\na poor measure of educational attainment (Baker,\nParker, Williams, Clark, & Nurss, 1997; Manly et al.)\nor that the many years of post-education reading\nexperience is more important than formal education\nfor determining literacy (Stanovich, West, & Harri-\nson, 1995). Similarly, controlling for age differences\nin education often attenuates but does not eliminate\nage differences in literacy (Baker et al., 2000).\nCognitive Abilities and Health Literacy\nEducation, cognitive ability, and literacy are\nintertwined, although it is difficult to unravel the\ndirection of causality. Education often improves\ncognitive function as well as literacy, but the more\ncognitively adept are also likely to advance further\nin education and create opportunities for cognitive\nStill, there is evidence that cognition (e.g., working\nmemory capacity) relates more to literacy than to\nyears of education among older adults (Barnes et al.,\ncognitive differences help explain the effects of\neducation and demographic variables such as age on\nliteracy. Differences in sensory abilities may also\nmediate the effects of age on literacy because sensory\nand cognitive abilities are increasingly coupled in\nadvanced age (Lindenberger & Baltes, 1994). This\nconclusion is consistent with evidence that age-related\ndifferences in cognitive abilities partly mediates\nrelationships between age and self-care (Park &\nfound that a global measure of cognitive impairment\n(the Mini-Mental State Examination) was not asso-\nciated with age-related differences in health literacy,\nthey did not measure cognitive abilities more directly\nrelated to comprehension. For example, successful\ncomprehension requires integrating current with\npreviously read information, and integration is more\nsuccessful to the extent previous information is easy\nto access from working memory (Kintsch, 1998).\nThus,individual differencesin workingmemorycapa-\ncity, processing speed, or other cognitive abilities may\nexplain differences in health literacy.\nFigure 1 also suggests that education influences\nliteracy via paths other than cognition by serving as\na marker for broader cultural factors. Highly\neducated adults more likely than less educated adults\nto share cultural norms and beliefs with health care\nprofessionals, which enables them to more easily\naccess and understand health-related information or\npredisposes them to accept the information as\nrelevant (Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004). We did not\ninvestigate these factors in the present study.\nStudy Objectives\nPrevious studies have found that the association of\nhealth literacy with demographic variables is partly\nmediated by education. However, the association\nbetween literacy and cognitive abilities is less well\nestablished. In the current study, we examined\nwhether health literacy in a diverse sample of adults\nwith CHF was related to sensory and cognitive\nabilities (independent of education) and whether these\nrelationships mediated effects of demographic varia-\nbles on literacy.\nMethods\nWe recruited a volunteer sample of 314 community-\ndwelling middle-aged and older adults who had been\ndiagnosed with CHF and were taking at least one CHF\nmedication for participation in a pharmacy-based\npatient education intervention study for improving\nadherence to CHF medications. Recruitment was\nthrough a Midwestern, county-managed urban hos-\npital (for details, see Murray, Young, et al., 2004).\nParticipants completed all measures reported in this\narticle during baseline data collection and before\nrandom assignment to intervention or usual care\ncontrol groups in the adherence study.\nA self-report questionnaire administered at\nstudy recruitment measured demographic variables\n(age, gender, race) and education. Participants self-\nidentified their racial group by choosing from a set of\noptions. For the regression analyses, we coded racial\ngroup as African American or Other. We measured\nhealth status with the New York Health Association\nclassification of CHF functional status (Critical\nCommittee, 1964) and by the Charlson Comorbidity\nIndex (Charlson, Pompei, Alex, & MacKensie, 1987).\nWe measured health-related literacy with the\nreading component of the Short Test of Functional\nHealth Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA; Baker,\nWilliams, Parker, Gazmararian, & Nurss, 1999).\nThis test requires about 7 min to administer and mea-\nsures the ability to read and understand actual\nhealth-related passages with readability levels of 4.3\nand 10.4 grade level (Gunning\u00adFog Index). Scores on\ninadequate health literacy, 17\u00ad22 = marginal liter-\nacy, and 23\u00ad36 = adequate literacy) and tend to\nWe measured visual function with the Snellen\nChart, a standardized test of visual acuity consisting\nof a chart with a series of letters in gradually decreas-\ning sizes placed at a standard distance from the sub-\nject. We assessed auditory function with the Speech\nDiscrimination Screening Task, part of the Arizona\nBattery for Communication Disorders of Dementia\n(Bayles & Tomoeda, 1993), which tests the ability to\ndiscriminate word pairs that differ only in the first\nphoneme (e.g., ``bare'' and ``dare''). We assessed\nspeech comprehension with the Revised Token Test\n(McNeil & Prescott, 1978), which requires listeners to\nmanipulate objects of varying size, shape, and color\nin response to spoken instructions. This test has\ndiscriminated children with various neurological or\nlinguistic deficits from normally developing children,\nin part because of the working memory demands\nof comprehension (Aram & Ekelman, 1987). We\nmeasured verbal working memory, or the ability to\nsimultaneously store and manipulate verbal informa-\ntion, directly with the Listening Span task. In this task,\nparticipants answer questions about progressively\nlarger sets of simple spoken sentences (1\u00ad6 sentences)\nand then recall the final word of each sentence in the\nset (for details on materials and scoring, see Salthouse\n& Babcock, 1990). The workingmemory measure was\nthe size of the sentence set for which the participant\ncould reliably recall the sentences' final words. Age-\nrelated differences on this task account for part of the\nage-related variance in reasoning and memory tasks\n(Salthouse & Babcock). We measured processing\nspeed with the Letter Comparison and Pattern Com-\nparison tasks (Salthouse, 1991). In these timed paper-\nand-pencil tasks, participants decide as rapidly as\npossible whether pairs of letter sets or line patterns are\nthe same or different. Age differences on these tasks\naccount for age-related variance in verbal reasoning\n(Salthouse) and memory (Park et al., 1996) tasks.\nResults\nPlan of Analysis\nTo test whether health-related literacy in a diverse\nsample of adults with CHF was associated with\nsensory and cognitive abilities and whether these\nassociations mediated effects of demographic vari-\nables on literacy, we conducted the following re-\ngression analyses organized in terms of Figure 1. First,\nin a set of simple linear regressions, we regressed raw\nSTOFHLA scores on each predictor to examine the\nstrength of the relationships between the predictors\nand the health literacy measure. These analyses helped\ndevelop models for the multiple regression analyses.\nSecond, we assessed which of the variables that\nhad been significant in the simple linear analyses\npredicted health literacy when the influence of the\nother variables was controlled. Following Figure 1,\nwe first examined the association of the demographic\nand health variables (age, race, gender, and health as\nindexed by the comorbid measure entered together)\nwith the STOFHLA measure (Step 1). We then\nexamined whether the effects of these variables\nremained significant when we entered education into\nthe equation (Step 2). Rather than present all higher-\norder regression models (e.g., effects of demograph-\nics and education with cognitive but not sensory\nvariables controlled), we present here a parsimonious\nmodel that accounts for the most variability in health\nliteracy with the fewest predictor variables (Step 3).\nFor comparison, we also present the model with all\nvariables entered (Step 4).\nParticipants\nThe majority (67%) of participants (age range,\n47\u00ad89 years old) were female. With respect to race,\n48% of participants were African American, 49%\nwere non-Hispanic White, 2% were Asian, and 1%\nwere Native American. Forty percent of participants\nscored at the two most severe levels of the New York\nHeart Association measure for CHF function (Level\n35%, and Level 4 [most severe] = 5%). In addition,\nparticipants reported on average 3.2 co-morbid\nconditions and took a mean of 9.5 medications\n(SD= 3.6) at the time of the study. Almost one third\n(28%) of participants had marginal or inadequate\nhealth-related literacy (STOFHLA score , 16). This\nwas consistent with previous studies with older adult\nsamples (e.g., Gazmararian et al., 1999) and in-\ndicated an adequate range of scores to investigate\ncorrelates of health literacy.\nSimple Linear Regression Analyses of\nHealth Literacy\nWe examined associations between the STOFHLA\nmeasure and the demographic, health, and cognitive/\nsensory measures. Table 1 presents mean and\nstandard deviation values for the continuous de-\nmographic and individual difference variables. This\ntable also presents the demographic and individual\ndifference scores separately for the African American\nand Other groups. Typical of health literacy and\ncognitive aging studies, age was negatively associated\nwith the health literacy measure (r =\u00c0.11, p , .05)\nand with the cognitive and sensory ability measures\nthese regression analyses with STOFHLA scores\nseparately regressed on each predictor. The scores\nwere lower for participants who were male, African\nAmerican, older, less educated, had more comorbid-\nities, or scored lower on all cognitive ability measures\nas well as on the speech discrimination test. Literacy\nwas not significantly associated with the Snellen test\nor the New York Health Association measure. A\ncomparison of the R2 values directly obtained from\nthe regression model fitting procedure (which is\ninterpreted as the percentage of the variation in the\ncriterion variable explained by the regression model)\nshowed that education (R2 =21.83) and the cognitive\nmeasures (Comparison Test R2 = 29.4; Revised\namount of variability in health literacy.\nHierarchical Multivariate Regression\nAnalyses of Health Literacy\nWe next examined which patient variables pre-\ndicted health literacy while controlling for relation-\nships among these predictors (for example, Table 1\nshows that African American participants were\nslightly older--and scored lower on the cognitive\nmeasures--compared to other participants). Table 3\nshows that, for the multivariate regressions with only\ndemographic variables entered (Step 1), these vari-\nables had similar relationships with literacy com-\npared to the simple linear regressions. Adding years\nof formal education to the model (Step 2) accounted\nfor 18% more variance in health literacy and reduced\nby approximately one half the relationship of health\nliteracy with age, gender, and comorbidities.

Race and gender remained significant\npredictors with education and cognitive variables\ncontrolled but explained little variance in literacy.\nIn other studies, education was associated with the\nSTOFHLA measure but did not eliminate significant\nassociations of age and health literacy when con-\ntrolled (e.g., Baker et al., 2000). This may reflect\ndifferences in samples across studies. For example,\nbecause mean participant age was higher in Baker\n63 years, respectively), the association of age and\nliteracy may have been greater in the former study.\nHealth Literacy and Cognitive Function\nPerhaps the most interesting finding from our\nstudy was that cognitive ability explained so much\nvariance in health literacy with education controlled.\nThe finding that processing speed was more pre-\ndictive than the working memory measure of health\nliteracy (Step 3) may reflect limitations on the\nworking memory measure because performance on\nthe listening span task was generally low, with limited\nvariability. Indeed, in an earlier study we found that\ndifferences in patients' memory for CHF medication\ninstructions were related to health literacy, which\ncould be partly explained by differences on a working\nThe relationship between processing speed and\nhealth literacy is unlikely due (only) to the fact that\nthe STOFHLA is a timed test. Processing speed\nmeasures have also been found to predict perfor-\nmance on untimed cognitive tasks (involving com-\nprehension, memory, and reasoning; e.g., Salthouse,\n1991). Adults with reduced speed of processing are\nlikely to more slowly access word meanings and\nintegrate them into a coherent text representation,\nwhich may impair comprehension. Thus, individual\ndifferences in health literacy among middle-aged and\nolder adults partly reflect differences in mental\nprocessing speed and other fundamental cognitive\nmechanisms, as predicted by theories that identify\nsuch mechanisms as constraints on comprehension\nefficiency (Kintsch, 1998; Wingfield & Stine-Morrow,\nrelated declines in literacy were reduced but not\neliminated by a global measure of cognitive function\n(the Mini-Mental State Examination). As suggested\nby these authors, this may reflect the lack of direct\nmeasures of specific cognitive abilities in that study.\nSensory measures did not predict health literacy in\nthe present study (also see Baker et al., 2000). Studies\nwith more complex visual function measures (which\nlikely share variance with cognitive measures) have\nfound associations of health literacy and sensory\nRelationships of health literacy to race were not\nexplained by differences in education and cognition.\nOther studies have found that the impact of race on\ncognitive performance is attenuated when control-\nling for education or other socioeconomic variables\n(Aiken, Marsiske, & Whitfield, 2004).

It is also\npossible that the impact of race on health literacy\ncould have been mediated by unmeasured variables\nin our study. For example, differences in community\nresources such as level of civic engagement (social\ncapital) may have played a role.\nFinally, men had lower STOFHLA scores than did\nwomen in our study, whereas other studies have\ntended to find no gender differences in STOFHLA\nscores (Gazmararian et al., 1999) or have found\nlower scores for women (e.g., Schillinger et al.,\n2002). These different patterns likely reflect differ-\nences across samples related to socioeconomic status,\nhealth, or other variables.\nStudy Limitations\nIn the present study, we measured health literacy\nwith the STOFHLA, but health literacy is a multi-\nfaceted concept that encompasses abilities in addi-\ntion to comprehension skill--abilities such as\ndecision making and others needed to navigate the\nhealth care system (e.g., Nielsen-Bohlman et al.,\n2004). Therefore, any single measure may underes-\ntimate poor health literacy. For example, we likely\nunderestimated effects of cultural differences. This\nmay help explain why education was associated with\nhealth literacy even after we controlled for other\nfactors, because cultural factors were likely corre-\nlated with education (also see Beers et al., 2003). A\nrelated limitation is that we did not measure\nconstructs related to social and cultural context in\nour general model (Figure 1) in the present study.\nNonetheless, the association of the STOHFLA\nmeasure with general cognitive abilities has several\nimplications for the importance of cognitive function\nin daily health care. First, the comprehension abilities\ntapped by the STOFHLA are a core set of skills related\nto the broader concept of health literacy, as shown by\nevidencethat performanceontheSTOFHLA isrelated\nto health outcomes (for a review, see Nielsen-Bohlman\net al., 2004). Second, cognitive abilities are likely to\ninfluence more abilities and behaviors than just\ncomprehension. For example, working memory meas-\nures explain age-related variance in medication\nadherence (Park et al., 1999) and medical decision\nA second limitation of this study relates to our\nsample of chronically ill adults. Because chronic\nillness such as CHF compromises cognitive function\n(e.g., Elias, D'Agostino, Elias, & Wolf, 1995;\nIzquiero-Porrea & Waldstein, 2002), it is difficult to\ngeneralize our findings about the relationships\nbetween cognitive ability and health literacy. An\nimportant next step will be to investigate cognitive\nability and health literacy in samples of healthy elders.\nA final caution relates to the correlational design of\nour study. We identified associations between health\nliteracy and cognitive measures but did not establish\ncausal relationships. Although the model in Figure 1\nsuggests that cognitive deficits contribute to poor\nhealth literacy, it is also possible that poor literacy\nskills contribute to cognitive declines, perhaps by\nreducing health. Prospective longitudinal studies that\nalso include measures of the sociocultural context may\ndisentanglerelationshipsbetweentheseimportantskill\ndomains and determine how they change over time.\nImplications for Improving Health Literacy\nThe importance of cognitive abilities such as\nmental processing speed for health literacy suggests\nthe value of training in basic cognitive skills for\nimproving literacy. Such training improves older\nadults' performance on a variety of tasks (for a review,\nsee Kramer & Willis, 2002). The relationship between\ncognitive abilities and literacy (Barnes et al., 2004;\nManly et al., 2002) suggests this would also be the\ncase for literacy. However, it is unclear to what extent\ntraining in basic cognitive abilities ``scales up'' to\nperformance of complex everyday tasks (Kramer &\nWillis, 2002). Therefore, basic cognitive training may\nnot be the most effective strategy for improving the\nability of older adults with inadequate literacy skills\nto navigate the health care system.\nThe relationship between cognitive abilities and\nhealth literacy suggests another approach to miti-\ngating the impact of low health literacy on health\ncare. Simplifying tasks that tax health literacy skills\nwould reduce constraints on performance imposed\nby declining cognitive abilities and limited compre-\nhension skills. Researchers frequently suggest that\nlow-literacy participants will benefit from commu-\nnication with simple language, pictorials, and other\ncharacteristics that simplify comprehension (Ad Hoc\never, the relationship between general cognitive\nabilities and health literacy identified in the present\nstudy suggests that such strategies will only help low-\nliteracy patients if they reduce demands on general\nas well as health-specific cognitive abilities. For ex-\nample, a sequence of pictorials may not help low-\nliteracy patients if these pictures must be mentally\nintegrated in order to be understood. Effective health\ncommunication should reduce demands on cognitive\nabilities (e.g., working memory) as well as on\nlanguage-specific abilities (e.g., word knowledge).\nWe are developing multimedia (text with pictures)\ninstructions for CHF medications that may improve\nolder adults' comprehension by addressing both\ntypes of abilities (e.g., Morrow et al., 2005).\nWe plan to elaborate the model in Figure 1 to\nencompass relationships between health literacy,\nadherence, and health outcomes. A preliminary\nanalysis suggests that lower health literacy is as-\nsociated with lower adherence to CHF medications\nin our intervention study (Murray, Wu, et al., 2004).\nWe plan to investigate whether relationships be-\ntween health literacy and adherence are mediated by\ndifferences in cognitive abilities and whether these\nrelationships also mediate the impact of demo-\ngraphic variables on adherence and health outcomes.\nSuch findings would be consistent with functional\ndefinitions that view health literacy in terms of how\nindividuals' skills match the demands of specific\nhealth care tasks or contexts (DeWalt et al., 2004;\nReferences\nAd Hoc Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs,\nAmerican Medical Association.
