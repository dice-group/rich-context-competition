Adopting a healthful diet and increasing physical activity are\neffective in preventing type 2 diabetes and decreasing the severity of diabetes-related complications. Educating and\ninforming the public about health problems is a service provided by local health departments (LHDs). The objective of\nthis study was to examine how LHDs are using social media to educate and inform the public about diabetes.\nMethods\nIn June 2012 we used NVivo 10 to collect all tweets ever posted from every LHD with a Twitter account and identified\ntweets about diabetes. We used a 2010 National Association of County and City Health Officials survey to compare\ncharacteristics of LHDs that tweeted about diabetes with those that did not. Content analysis was used to classify each\ntweet topic.\nResults\nOf 217 LHDs with Twitter accounts, 126 had ever tweeted about diabetes, with 3 diabetes tweets being the median\nsince adopting Twitter. LHDs tweeting about diabetes were in jurisdictions with larger populations and had more staff\nand higher spending than LHDs not tweeting about diabetes. They were significantly more likely to employ a public\ninformation specialist and provide programs in diabetes-related areas. There was also a weak positive association\nbetween jurisdiction diabetes rate and the percentage of all tweets that were about diabetes (r = .16; P = .049).\nConclusion\nLHDs are beginning to use social media to educate and inform their constituents about diabetes. An understanding of\nthe reach and effectiveness of social media could enable public health practitioners to use them more effectively.\nIntroduction\nThe Essential Public Health Services framework, developed by the Core Public Health Functions Steering Committee\nin 1994 (1), charges local health departments (LHDs) with ensuring that their communities receive 10 essential\nservices including vaccination, screening, and surveillance (2). Among these services is essential service number 3\n(ES3): inform, educate, and empower people about health issues. Such communication with the public and other\nstakeholders about healthy behaviors and health risks has also been a focus of the standards for LHD accreditation by\nthe Public Health Accreditation Board (3). At least 3 of the standards (3.1, 3.2, and 10.2) include communication with\nthe public about urgent and nonurgent public health issues. A 2004 study found that only 61.3% of LHDs were meeting\nthe model standard performance of ES3 (2). Web-based social media sites (social media), such as Facebook and\nTwitter, have the potential to aid LHDs in improving the provision of ES3, meeting accreditation standards, and,\nultimately, improving public health.\nListen to our podcast interview\nwith author Jenine Harris, PhD.\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Local Health Department Use of Twitter to Disseminate Dia...\nSocial media have the potential to reach large audiences; worldwide more than 845 million people use Facebook and\n(5). Social media reach large audiences, including underserved segments of the population; social media use is\nassociated with age but is independent of educational attainment, race/ethnicity, and health care access (6,7).\nAs of 2011, 65% of adult Internet users reported using social media (8), and many of these users reported seeking\nOf the adults who use social media, 23% have followed their friends' personal health experiences or updates, 17% have\nused social media to remember or memorialize people with a specific health condition, and 15% have obtained health\ninformation from social media websites (13). Public health social media campaigns have been successful in promoting\ncondom use (14), educating low-income parents and farm families about child safety and health (15,16), and increasing\nthe likelihood that new mothers will stay smoke-free (17).\nDiabetes is a major public health problem projected to affect as much as one-third of US adults by 2050 (18). In 2007,\ndiabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (18). Behavior changes, including adopting a\nhealthful diet and increasing physical activity, can delay or decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes and decrease the\nseverity of diabetes-related complications (6,19\u00ad21). Many people with diabetes seek health information online (6),\nincluding through social media sources. Many diabetes-focused blogs (eg, Diabetes Mine, www.diabetesmine.com/)\nand diabetes-focused social network sites (eg, TuDiabetes, www.tudiabetes.org/) attract thousands of people managing\nThe widespread use of social media and the use of social media by people diagnosed with diabetes present an\nopportunity for LHDs. The objective of this study was to examine how LHDs are using social media to educate and\ninform the public about diabetes by determining 1) whether LHDs are tweeting about diabetes, 2) whether LHDs that\nconduct diabetes-related programming are more likely to tweet about diabetes than LHDs that do not conduct diabetes\nprograms, 3) whether LHDs tweeting about diabetes are more likely to be in jurisdictions with higher diabetes rates\ncompared with LHDs not tweeting about diabetes, and 4) what information the LHDs that are tweeting about diabetes\nare providing.\nMethods\nData collection\nWe used a mixed-methods approach to determine whether and how LHDs use social media to disseminate information\nabout diabetes. Between December 2011 and July 2012, we identified all Twitter accounts for LHDs in the United\nStates through Web searches for each of the 2,565 LHDs included in the National Association of County and City\nHealth Officials (NACCHO) directory. We added information about whether or not an LHD had a Twitter account and\nhow many Twitter followers each account had to the most recent data set of the NACCHO National Profile of Local\nHealth Departments study (Profile study) conducted in 2010 (23). The Profile study includes information about the\njurisdiction population of each LHD in the United States and LHD staffing, organization, financing, and services\nprovided. From the Profile study data, we used measures of 1) jurisdiction population, or the number of people living\nin the jurisdiction; 2) total number of full-time equivalent staff (FTE) working at the LHD; 3) total spending by the\nLHD in the last year; 4) the LHD leader's highest level of education; and 5) whether the LHD was conducting services\nrelated to diabetes, physical activity, nutrition, or chronic disease itself or contracting these services. To determine the\nstaffing and spending for each LHD, we divided the FTE and spending variables by the jurisdiction population for\nmeasures of FTE and spending per capita.\nWe identified 217 LHDs that used Twitter. We used the NCapture function of NVivo 10 software (QSR International,\nDoncaster, Victoria, Australia) to collect and import all tweets that the 217 LHDs had sent since adopting Twitter.\nmatching to identify all tweets about \"diabetes.\" Fuzzy matching is a process by which the exact word (diabetes) and\nother related words (eg, diabetic) are captured. We identified 126 LHD Twitter accounts as having tweeted 1 or more\ntweets containing \"diabetes\" or a related term, for a total of 1,024 total tweets. The use of the fuzzy matching strategy\nresulted in the inclusion of 48 tweets that were not about diabetes (eg, diapers or disputes); we obtained a final sample\nsize of 976 tweets from 126 LHDs that included the term diabetes or a diabetes-related term. We added the number of\ntotal tweets and diabetes tweets per LHD to the Profile study data. We obtained county-level diabetes rates from the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/) and added them to the data set for LHD\njurisdictions that comprised an entire single county.\nQualitative coding\nOur initial examination showed that LHDs tend to tweet information about risks associated with diabetes, benefits of\nprevention and management of diabetes associated with specific health behaviors (eg, eating healthfully), and\nmobilizing information or cues to action that provided specific information about actions to take to prevent or manage\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Local Health Department Use of Twitter to Disseminate Dia...\ndiabetes. These 3 emergent themes loosely follow the key components of risks, benefits, and cues to action from the\nHealth Belief Model (HBM) (24), which describes individual and external characteristics associated with the likelihood\nof a health behavior change. Broadly speaking, these 3 HBM components describe a person's likelihood of adopting a\nhealthy behavior as related to their perception that their health is at risk, the benefits they perceive to be associated\nwith a healthy behavior, and external cues promoting a healthy behavior. To examine whether health departments\nfocused on educating and informing about risks and benefits, or whether they primarily provide constituents with cues\nto action, we coded each tweet for risks, benefits, and cues to action. Operational definitions adapted from the HBM\nwere developed before coding:\nRisks tweets were information about the population at risk and risk levels, risk based on a person's\ncharacteristics or behaviors, or specific consequences or risks and conditions associated with the disease.\nBenefits tweets included information about the positive effects to be expected as a result of prevention,\nscreening, or maintenance behaviors.\nCues to action tweets were information promoting specific prevention, self-care, and management techniques\nor promotion of disease awareness.\nEach tweet could be assigned as many of the 3 codes as applicable. To ensure a reliable coding system, 2 of the authors\n(J.H. and N.M.) coded a random sample of 65 tweets (6.6%). Agreement between the 2 coders was 78% with a kappa\nof .89, which is regarded as nearly perfect by Landis and Koch (25). Once reliability was established, the 2 coders each\ncoded a portion of the tweets independently.\nData analysis\nFor LHDs with Twitter accounts, we compared health department characteristics of those tweeting about diabetes with\nthose not tweeting about diabetes by using descriptive statistics,  , and the Mann\u00adWhitney U test for independent\nsamples. We also used geographic information systems to examine the geographic distribution of health departments\ntweeting about diabetes. Finally, we examined the frequencies of each type of tweet (risks, benefits, cues to action) to\nidentify any patterns related to the content of LHD diabetes tweets.\nResults\nOf the 2,565 LHDs, 217 (8.4%) had a Twitter account. LHDs using Twitter accounts were in jurisdictions with the\nlargest populations and had the most staff and highest spending (26). Twitter adopters were also more likely to have a\ntop executive with a doctorate and to employ a public health information officer than LHDs not using Twitter. On\naverage, health departments with Twitter accounts had tweeted 392.7 times (standard deviation, 644.5).\nOf the 217 local health departments using Twitter, 126 (58.0%) were tweeting about diabetes. Figure 1 shows the\ndistribution of LHD jurisdictions that do and do not have Twitter accounts. The median number of diabetes tweets per\nhealth department tweeting about diabetes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 6.0). For those LHDs tweeting about\ndiabetes, a median of 1.1% (IQR, 1.5) of their total tweets since opening a Twitter account were about diabetes. Local\nhealth departments tweeting about diabetes had significantly more constituents and more resources (Table 1) than\nthose not tweeting about diabetes. Consistent with the larger number of constituents, the number of Twitter followers\ncompared with those not tweeting about diabetes (median, 59.5; IQR, 210). Top executives of LHDs tweeting about\ndiabetes were more likely to have graduate degrees than top executives of LHDs not tweeting about diabetes, although\nthis difference was not significant. Finally, LHDs tweeting about diabetes were significantly more likely to employ a\npublic information specialist (Table 2).\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Local Health Department Use of Twitter to Disseminate Dia...\nFigure 1. Geographic boundaries of local health departments with Twitter accounts that did and did not tweet about\ndiabetes as of June 2012. [A text description of this figure is also available.]\nA higher percentage of LHDs tweeting about diabetes either performed or contracted with others to perform diabetes\nscreening, chronic disease programs, nutrition programs, or physical activity programs compared with those not\ntweeting about diabetes (Table 2).\nWe found mixed support for the relationship between the diabetes rate in an LHD jurisdiction and tweeting about\ndiabetes. We found no significant difference in diabetes rates in jurisdictions where LHDs were tweeting about\ndiabetes compared with jurisdictions where they were not tweeting about diabetes (Table 1). However, the number of\npeople with diabetes was significantly higher in jurisdictions tweeting about diabetes than in those not tweeting about\ndiabetes.\nTo learn more about the relationship between tweeting about diabetes and the prevalence of diabetes, we examined\nwhether the amount of diabetes tweeting was associated with the amount of diabetes in the jurisdiction. We found no\nsignificant correlation between the diabetes rate in a jurisdiction and the number of LHD tweets about diabetes (Figure\n2). However, the percentage of tweets about diabetes was positively and significantly related to the jurisdiction\ndiabetes rate (r = .16; P = .049). So, in jurisdictions with higher diabetes rates, an LHD tweeting about diabetes was\nusing a larger proportion of its tweets to send out diabetes information; however, this relationship was weak.\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Local Health Department Use of Twitter to Disseminate Dia...\nFigure 2. Geographic distribution of diabetes rates in 2009 (27) and the number of tweets about diabetes tweeted as\nof June 2012, from local health departments using Twitter. [A text description of this figure is also available.]\nMost health departments tweeting about diabetes were tweeting about the risks associated with diabetes and specific\ncues to action for constituents; fewer health departments were tweeting about the benefits of healthy behaviors to\nprevent or mitigate diabetes. Specifically, of those LHDs tweeting about diabetes, information relating to diabetes risk\nwas tweeted 358 times total by 79 (63%) local health departments. Approximately one-third (n = 41) of LHDs tweeting\nabout diabetes tweeted about benefits of health behaviors for preventing and managing diabetes for a total of 82\nbenefit tweets. Finally, 112 (89%) of LHDs that were tweeting about diabetes, were tweeting cues to action, for a total of\n699 cues to action tweets. Table 3 has examples of tweets in each of these categories.\nDiscussion\nOur study identified few significant differences in characteristics of the jurisdictions of LHDs that used Twitter to\ndisseminate information about diabetes and those that did not. Although more than half of local health departments\nwith a Twitter account are tweeting about diabetes, jurisdictions with LHDs tweeting about diabetes did not have\nsignificantly higher diabetes rates than those with LHDs that did not. The number of people with diabetes was\nsignificantly higher in jurisdictions that tweeted about diabetes than in those that did not tweet about diabetes;\nhowever, this difference is likely due to the larger populations in these jurisdictions. LHDs providing (or contracting)\nprogramming around diabetes and related health areas were more likely to tweet about diabetes, indicating that LHDs\nmay be using social media in support of their active program areas. An examination of tweet content showed that most\nhealth departments are providing information about diabetes risks, and nearly all are providing specific cues to action;\nhowever only one-third of LHDs are providing information about the benefits of healthy behavior in preventing or\nmitigating diabetes.\nEvidence is limited and mixed on the value of media campaigns in prompting behavior changes to reduce diabetes risk\nand complications (eg, adopting a healthful diet, increasing physical activity). However, comprehensive health\ncommunication campaigns are among the recommended evidence-based strategies in the Guide to Community\nPreventive Services (www.thecommunityguide.org/healthcommunication/campaigns.html), and using social media is\nPreventing Chronic Disease | Local Health Department Use of Twitter to Disseminate Dia...\n1 of the channels recommended to supplement mass media in these campaigns. LHDs may consider using social media\nas 1 of their strategies to reach people at risk for, or living with, diabetes.\nPeople diagnosed with diabetes are actively seeking health information on the Web, specifically in interactive venues\nsuch as social media forums (6,28,29). Until the widespread availability of social media, diabetes health information\navailable online was static (eg, lists on websites) and lacked interactivity and engagement (30). The interactive nature\nof social media can provide ongoing support for people with diabetes faced with managing their disease on a daily basis\n(6). As 1 blogger explains, \"Because diabetes is every day. It's not a disease that you can manage by simply popping a\npill and seeing your doctor once or twice a year. This disease, as a whole, requires thought and care every day\" (22). It\nis, therefore, important to better understand how best to serve this population and mobilize LHDs to ensure the\nprovision of useful information and resources. Health departments have a unique opportunity to use social media to\nprovide this essential service, meeting several of the standards required for accreditation and, potentially, aiding in\nimproving public health in their jurisdiction and nationwide. Future research is needed to better understand how best\nto use social media as a tool for dissemination of health information to constituents and as a way to engage people\nliving with and managing chronic disease.\nThis study is limited by cross-sectional data; with 98,000 tweets being sent each minute, social media are constantly\nchanging, and these changes are not captured in our study. In addition, the strategies used in this study cannot\ndetermine the reach of Twitter accounts beyond the number of followers, so we do not know who the diabetes\ninformation is reaching and whether those receiving the information are benefitting from it or spreading it to others\nwho might benefit. Additionally, multiple comparisons were made without an adjusted  between LHDs tweeting and\nnot tweeting about diabetes, increasing the likelihood of a type I error. Despite these limitations, this study is the first\nof its kind to examine how LHDs are using social media to provide the essential service of educating and informing\nconstituents and to support their active program areas.\nJust over half of LHDs with Twitter accounts are tweeting about diabetes; diabetes tweets tend to come from LHDs\nserving larger populations and LHDs conducting or contracting diabetes-related programming. Most diabetes tweets\nfrom LHDs are providing information about diabetes risk and cues to action for their constituents. LHDs have the\nopportunity to provide constituents with locally relevant health information and with cues to action; as social media\nuse grows among LHDs and the public, more evidence is needed regarding effective uses of social media for public\nhealth practice.\n"
