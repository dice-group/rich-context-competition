However, few studies have addressed whether improving cognitive functions\nmight have short- or long-term effects on activities related to living independently.\nObjective To evaluate whether 3 cognitive training interventions improve mental\nabilities and daily functioning in older, independent-living adults.\nDesign Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial with recruitment conducted from\nrecruited from senior housing, community centers, and hospital/clinics in 6 metropoli-\ntan areas in the United States.\nInterventions Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: 10-session group\ntraining for memory (verbal episodic memory; n=711), or reasoning (ability to solve prob-\nlems that follow a serial pattern; n=705), or speed of processing (visual search and iden-\ntification; n=712); or a no-contact control group (n=704). For the 3 treatment groups,\n4-session booster training was offered to a 60% random sample 11 months later.\nMain Outcome Measures Cognitive function and cognitively demanding every-\nday functioning.\nResults Thirty participants were incorrectly randomized and were excluded from the\nanalysis. Each intervention improved the targeted cognitive ability compared with base-\nline, durable to 2 years (P.001 for all). Eighty-seven percent of speed-, 74% of rea-\nsoning-, and 26% of memory-trained participants demonstrated reliable cognitive im-\nprovement immediately after the intervention period. Booster training enhanced training\nno booster, 68%; reasoning booster, 72%; no booster, 49%), which were main-\ntained at 2-year follow-up (P.001 for both). No training effects on everyday func-\ntioning were detected at 2 years.\nConclusions Results support the effectiveness and durability of the cognitive train-\ning interventions in improving targeted cognitive abilities. Training effects were of a\nmagnitude equivalent to the amount of decline expected in elderly persons without\ndementia over 7- to 14-year intervals. Because of minimal functional decline across all\ngroups, longer follow-up is likely required to observe training effects on everyday function.\neven in old age. Moreover, sustained en-\ngagement in cognitively stimulating ac-\ntivities has been found to impact neural\nstructure in both older humans and ro-\ndents.4-6 Conversely, limited education\nhas been found to be a risk factor for de-\nmentia.7 There is also a sizeable body of\nliterature documenting that different\ntypesofcognitivetrainingprogramshave\nlarge and durable effects on the cogni-\ntive functioning of older adults, even in\nadvanced old age.8-15 At the same time,\nseveral important issues remain under-\nstudied. First, prior cognitive training\nstudies with older adults have often paid\nrelatively little attention to the use of ap-\npropriate control groups, the represen-\ntativeness or heterogeneity of partici-\npants, the generalizability of training\nfindings beyond particular laborato-\nries,oradherenceofparticipantstotrain-\ning protocols. For example, it has not\nbeen uncommon for such studies to\nanalyze only compliant participants.\nSecond, the broader implications of\ntraining on daily functioning in older\nadults, for the most part, have not been\nstudied.\nThe primary objective of the\nACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Train-\ning for Independent and Vital Elderly)\ntrial was to test the effectiveness and\ndurability of 3 distinct cognitive inter-\nventions in improving the performance\nof elderly persons on basic measures of\ncognition and on measures of cogni-\ntively demanding daily activities (eg,\nfood preparation, driving, medication\nuse, financial management). These\ninterventions previously had been\nfound successful in improving cogni-\ntive abilities under laboratory or small-\nscale field conditions.8-16 We hypoth-\nesized that the effects of cognitive\ntraining on primary outcomes will be\nlargely mediated through the basic\ncognitive abilities being trained. The\ndetailed hypotheses may be summa-\nrized by 2 points: each training group\nwill perform better than the other\ntraining and control groups on their\nrespective primary and proximal out-\ncomes, and those groups that received\nbooster training will perform better\nthan those that did not receive booster\ntraining on their primary and proximal\noutcomes.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThe recruitment goal for the ACTIVE\ntrial was to enroll a diverse sample of\nolder adults who, at enrollment, were\nliving independently in good func-\ntional and cognitive status.

Booster training was provided to\na random subsample in each interven-\ntion group. Measurement points con-\nsisted of baseline tests, an immediate\nposttest (following the intervention),\nand 1 and 2 annual posttests.\nInterventions\nThe interventions were conducted in\nminute sessions over 5- to 6-week\nperiods. These were behavioral inter-\nventions with no pharmacological com-\nponent.

Participants re-\nceived instruction in a strategy or mne-\nmonic rule, exercises, individual and\ngroup feedback on performance, and a\npractice test. For example, partici-\npants were instructed how to organize\nword lists into meaningful categories\nand to form visual images and mental\nassociations to recall words and texts.\nThe exercises involved laboratory-\nlike memory tasks (eg, recalling a list\nof nouns, recalling a paragraph), as well\nas memory tasks related to cognitive ac-\ntivities of everyday life (eg, recalling a\nshopping list, recalling the details of a\nprescription label).\nability to solve problems that follow a\nserial pattern. Such problems involve\nidentifying the pattern in a letter or\nnumber series or understanding the pat-\ntern in an everyday activity such as pre-\nscription drug dosing or travel sched-\nules. Participants were taught strategies\nto identify a pattern and were given an\nopportunity to practice the strategies in\nboth individual and group exercises.\nThe exercises involved abstract reason-\ning tasks (eg, letter series) as well as rea-\nsoning problems related to activities of\ndaily living.\nSpeed-of-processing training8,30 fo-\ncusedonvisualsearchskillsandtheabil-\nity to identify and locate visual infor-\nmation quickly in a divided-attention\nformat. Participants practiced increas-\ningly complex speed tasks on a com-\nputer.

Booster train-\ning was delivered in four 75-minute ses-\nsions over a 2- to 3-week period.\nMeasures\nThe ACTIVE trial had multiple out-\ncomes, both proximal (cognitive abili-\nties) and primary (daily function)\n(TABLE 1). Composites were created to\nrepresent each domain. Each compos-\nite was the average of 2 or 3 test scores,\nequally weighted, and was designed as\na measure of ability rather than perfor-\nmance on a specific test.\nProximal outcomes permitted a test\nof the impact of the 3 interventions on\nthe appropriate cognitive abilities.\nMemory assessment focused on epi-\nsodic verbal memory tasks. Reasoning\nassessment focused on tasks requiring\nidentification of patterns in letter or\nword series problems. Speed-of-\nprocessing assessment focused on iden-\ntifying the minimum stimulus dura-\ntion at which participants could identify\nand localize information, with 75% ac-\ncuracy, under varying levels of cogni-\ntive demand.\nPrimary outcomes were aspects of\nfunctional activities, both performance-\nbased and self-reported. Everyday prob-\nlem solving represented the ability to\nreason and correctly identify informa-\ntion in common everyday stimuli (eg,\nmedication labels, charts, forms). This\nwas measured via paper-and-pencil test-\ning and behavioral simulations of ev-\neryday tasks. Everyday speed empha-\nsized the speed with which participants\ninteracted with real-world stimuli. Par-\nticipants were asked to look up a spe-\ncific telephone number, find food items\non a crowded shelf of groceries, find in-\ngredients on food labels, count out\nspecified amounts of change, find speci-\nfied information on medicine bottles,\nand respond appropriately to different\ntraffic signs. Activities of daily living\n(ADL) and instrumental activities of daily\nliving included self-ratings drawn from\nthe Minimum Data Set--Home Care\n(MDS-HC).43 Driving habits included\nself-ratings of driving difficulty and\navoidance of specific driving situa-\ntions.\nTests were standardized by pooling\nscores at all time points and applying\na Blom transformation,44 producing\nmore normally distributed scores.\nScores for tests at each time point were\nstandardized to the baseline mean and\nSD. If 1 or more tests of a composite\nwere missing, the composite score was\ncalculated as the average of the non-\nmissing tests.\nAnalysis\nTo evaluate the effects of ACTIVE train-\ning over 2 years, a repeated-measures,\nmixed-effects model was used.45 The de-\npendent variables were the proximal\nand primary composites measured at 4\ntime points: baseline, immediate post-\ntest, first annual evaluation (A1), and\nsecond annual evaluation (A2). At\nposttest only the cognitive variables,\nthe Everyday Problems Test, and the\nprimary speed composite were mea-\nsured. The independent variables\nwere restricted to the basic design fea-\ntures: fixed effects for training group\n(memory, reasoning, speed, control);\ntime (3 or 4 points); booster training;\nfield site; and replicate within site.\nThree interaction terms were chosen for\ntheir importance and interpretability:\ntime  training, representing the net\neffect of the trial; time  booster, rep-\nresenting nonspecific effects of the ad-\nditional social contact of attending\nbooster training, regardless of con-\ntent; and time  booster  training,\nrepresenting the training-specific ef-\nfects of each booster intervention. For\nthis analysis, the repeated-measures\nmodel was fitted to the available data,\nignoring missing data. Then, to deter-\nmine if selective attrition influenced\nthe trial results, missing data were\nimputed using multiple imputation\nprocedures,46 and the analysis was\nrepeated.\nHypotheses were tested by compar-\ning outcome composite scores at later\ntimes (posttest, A1, and A2) to base-\nline scores and to control group scores,\nyielding net differences. The net effect\nof training at any time was defined as:\n(trained mean-control mean at later\ntime)-(trained mean-control mean at\nbaseline).Similarly,theneteffectofeach\nboostertrainingwasdefinedas:(booster\nmean-unboosted mean at later time)-\n(booster mean-unboosted mean at\nbaseline). Results are expressed as effect\nsizes (ie, difference in means divided by\nintrasubject SD) to allow direct com-\nparison of different outcomes. In addi-\ntion, covariate-adjusted training ef-\nfects were examined, with covariates of\nage, sex, cognitive status (MMSE score),\nyears of education, and visual acuity.\nGiven the substantial variation associ-\nated with field site and replicate, these\n2 factors were also included as covari-\nates in all analyses.\nSecondary analyses investigated the\npercentage of participants who showed\nreliable improvement in each training\ngroup. A participant was classified as\nhaving improved reliably on a particu-\nlar measure if his or her performance\nat a follow-up occasion exceeded base-\nline performance on that measure by 1\nSEM.47 The formula for reliable change\nwas computed as outlined by Dudek,47\nand analyses were conducted using SAS\nv8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).\nP.05 was considered significant.\nRESULTS\nFive thousand individuals were con-\ntacted for participation (FIGURE 1).

It did not, however,\ndemonstrate the generalization of\nsuch interventions to everyday perfor-\nmance,atleastintheinitial2years.The\neffect sizes for the cognitive abilities\nat immediate posttest are for the most\npart consistent with previous research.\nMoreover, these effect sizes are com-\nparablewithorgreaterthantheamount\nof longitudinal decline that has been\nreported in previous studies (TABLE 5),\nsuggestingthattheseinterventionshave\nthe potential to reverse age-related\ndecline.Specifically,age-relateddecline\nfor reasoning ability in samples of\nelderly persons without dementia has\nbeen found to be on the order of 0.22\nyears) and to increase to 0.42 SD over\nThus, immediate reasoning training\neffects (0.48 SD) were comparable with\ntheamountofdeclinereportedtooccur\nin elderly persons without dementia\novera14-yearinterval.Likewise,decline\nin memory ability has been reported to\n7-year interval.

This is an\nimportant finding, since prior inter-\nventions (especially memory) have not\nshown 2-year durability. Further-\nmore, a very high percentage of trained\nparticipants achieved reliable improve-\nment on the cognitive abilities, and ceil-\ning effects at baseline on the cognitive\nmeasures explain lack of reliable im-\nprovement for most others. Of further\nnote, the tests of training effects were\nconservative compared with those used\nin prior cognitive aging research. That\nis, prior cognitive training research has\nnot used intention-to-treat analyses, in-\nstead excluding participants who\ndropped out or were noncompliant. In\naddition, prior research has not used di-\nverse samples in terms of education and\nethnicity. Thus, relative to prior work,\ntraining effects on cognitive abilities in\nthis study are strong.\nInsufficient sample size was ruled out\nas an explanation for the small effect\nsizes to date on the functional out-\ncomes. The study was sufficiently pow-\ncalculationswerebasedon6Bonferroni-\ncorrected, 2-sided comparisons with an\noverall  level of .05, a correlation of 0.7\nbetween baseline and follow-up (based\non pilot data), and an 80% completion\nrate.17 Based on these same assump-\ntions, there was 90% power to detect\nbooster training effects. Given that we\nretained more than 80% of the initial\nsample over the 2-year follow-up pe-\nriodandfoundnodifferentiallossacross\ntreatment and control conditions, there\nshould have been sufficient power to de-\ntect a significant effect of the cognitive\ntraining on the functional outcomes.\nThe absence of transfer to real-\nworld outcomes is not particularly sur-\nprising. In addition to several decades\nof cognitive science research demon-\nstrating the difficulty of obtaining such\ntransfer, most of our subjects were not\nyet impaired in the domains of train-\ning. Indeed, there are several other po-\ntential explanations for the observed\nlack of transfer to daily function: the\nproportion of participants function-\ning at ceiling levels (ie, 43% had no\nroom for improvement, as indicated by\nbaseline performance within 1 SEM of\nthe \"best\" value) on the daily func-\ntional composite, the evidence of strong\npractice or retest effects in the control\ngroup, and the control group's lack of\nfunctional decline over the 2-year fol-\nlow-up period.\nFigure 2.

Thus,\nimproved cognitive function could not\nbe expected to improve intact every-\nday abilities over a 2-year period.\nConsistent with prior cognitive in-\ntervention research showing large re-\ntest or practice effects,57 the approxi-\nmately 5 hours of practice on cognitive\ntests at each assessment occasion re-\nsulted in retest effects for the control\ngroup. Approximately 25% of control\nparticipants showed reliable gain on\ncognitive and functional composites as\na result of practice effects, and these re-\ntest effects were evident across study in-\ntervals. Particularly notable were prac-\ntice effects on the daily function\ncomposites. These large retest effects\ncontributed to ceiling-level perfor-\nmance across groups that precluded\ndemonstration of additional gain as a\nresult of training.\nIn terms of the observed lack of func-\ntional decline in the control group, it\nis important to note that individuals\nwith extant functional or cognitive de-\ncline were carefully screened out, and\nthe study focused instead on intact in-\ndividuals whose future decline rates\nwere likely to mimic or be less than rates\nforthegeneralelderlypopulation.Itwas\ntherefore unclear whether partici-\npants would show evidence of decline\nsimilar to established population pa-\nservation periods, or whether individu-\nals in the sample would be more\nresilient and less subject to decline over\nsuch a short period of time. In speci-\nfying expected effect sizes for the func-\ntional outcome measures, the former\nposition was adopted (ie, decline rates\nwould follow established patterns).\nHowever, for the crucial everyday mea-\nsures of IADL and ADL performance,\nthe observed decline rates were signifi-\ncantly below established population\nticipants experienced a 2-point or\ngreater drop in the 36-point IADL scale,\nenced this small increase in depen-\ndency. For the 30-point ADL perfor-\nmance scale, 6% were more dependent\nPrior longitudinal research on cogni-\ntively demanding measures of every-\nday functioning indicates that age-\nrelated decline occurs later for these\ntasks than for the more basic abilities\nthat were the focus of training. Reli-\nable age-related decline on everyday\nproblem-solving tasks has been shown\nnot to occur until individuals are in\ntheir mid seventies, whereas declines\non basic abilities such as reasoning\nand memory typically occur in their mid\nIn summary, it is clear that proxi-\nmal training effects occurred, that\nthey continued (albeit at lower levels)\nthrough 24 months, and that a signifi-\ncant segment of trained individuals\nwent forward through 2 years of life\nwith better cognitive skills than did\nthe controls. Due to lack of functional\ndeclines thus far, it is not yet clear\nwhether differential functional decline\nacross treatment groups will be\nobserved in the future as this select\ncohort enters more fully into an age of\nfunctional loss.\nAuthor Affiliations: Department of Psychology, Uni-\nversity of Alabama at Birmingham (Dr Ball); National\nInstitute on Aging (Dr Berch), National Institute of Nurs-\ning Research (Drs Helmers and Leveck), and National\nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute (Dr Jobe), National In-\nstitutes of Health, Bethesda, Md; Institute on Aging and\nDepartments of Health Policy and Epidemiology and\nClinical and Health Psychology, University of Florida,\nGainesville (Dr Marsiske); Hebrew Rehabilitation Cen-\nter for the Aged, Roslindale, Mass (Dr Morris); Depart-\nment of Mental Hygiene, Johns Hopkins University, Bal-\ntimore, Md (Dr Rebok); Department of Medicine (Dr\nSmith) and Department of Psychiatry (Dr Unverzagt),\nIndiana University School of Medicine, Bloomington;\nNew England Research Institutes, Watertown, Mass (Dr\nTennstedt); and Department of Human Development\nand Family Studies, Pennsylvania State University, Uni-\nversity Park (Dr Willis).
