Few studies focus on ``preclinical'' warning signs associated with mortality. In this article, we investigate\nassociations between all-cause mortality and two clusters of biological risk factors: (i) standard clinical measures related to\ncardiovascular disease and metabolic function; and (ii) nonclinical measures pertaining to hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal\naxis activity, sympathetic nervous system activity, and inflammatory response.\nMethods. Data come from the 2000 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study, a national sample of\nTaiwanese persons aged 54 years or older; 1497 persons were interviewed in their homes, and 1023 participated in\na hospital examination. The analysis is based on 927 respondents with complete information. Logistic regression models\ndescribe the association between biomarkers and the 3-year probability of dying.\nResults. Although both groups of biomarkers are significantly associated with mortality, the model with\nneuroendocrine and immune biomarkers has better explanatory and discriminatory power than the one with clinical\nmeasures. The association between these nonclinical measures and mortality remains strong after adjustment for the\nclinical markers, suggesting that the physiological effects of the nonclinical biomarkers are broader than those captured by\nthe cardiovascular and metabolic system measures included here.\nConclusions. Nonclinical markers are likely to provide warning signs of deteriorating health and function beyond what\ncan be learned from conventional markers. Our findings are consistent with those of recent studies that (i) demonstrate the\nimportance of neuroendocrine and immune system markers for survival, and (ii) indicate that standard clinical variables\nare less predictive of mortality in older than in younger populations.\nVAST literatures investigate the associations between\nclinical risk factors and specific diseases, and again,\nbetween those diseases and subsequent mortality risk. Fewer\nstudies directly examine associations between clinical risk\nfactors and mortality (1,2), and even fewer focus on ``pre-\nclinical'' warning signs associated with mortality, although\nresearch in this area has been increasing (3\u00ad10).\nIn this article, we focus on the link between biological risk\nfactors and mortality for an older population. We examine\nall-cause mortality because, as a consequence of multiple\ncomorbidities, prediction of specific diseases is especially\nproblematic at these older ages (11). Rather than concentrat-\ning on individual biological risk factors, we focus on two\nclusters. The first comprises standard clinical risk factors\nrelated to cardiovascular and metabolic function: obesity,\nblood pressure, lipids, and glucose metabolism. The sec-\nond cluster--which we denote ``nonclinical'' measures--\ncomprisescortisol,dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate(DHEA-S),\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-\nlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and dopamine. Biomarkers in\nthis latter group are not usually measured in medical exam-\ninations; most do not have well-established clinical cutoffs.\nThe two clusters are motivated by a theoretical framework\n(12,13) that hypothesizes that chronic exposure to stressors\nresults in prolonged dysregulation of ``primary mediators''\n(represented by the nonclinical cluster), leading to abnormal\nvalues for ``secondary outcomes'' (represented by the\nstandard clinical cluster) and ultimately, disease and death.\nWe compare the performance of the two clusters in\npredicting mortality over a 3-year follow-up period.\nMETHODS\nData Collection\nThe data come from the 2000 Social Environment and\nBiomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), which is based on\na random subsample of respondents 54 years old or older\nwho were interviewed as part of the nationally representa-\ntive Survey of Health and Living Status in Taiwan (14).\nSEBAS included an in-home interview and a hospital visit.\nWritten informed consent was obtained for participation in\nboth components.\nOn a scheduled day several weeks after the in-home inter-\nview, participants collected a 12-hour overnight urine sample,\nfasted overnight, and visited a nearby hospital the following\nmorning where medical personnel drew a blood specimen\nand took blood pressure and anthropometric measurements.\nCompliance was extremely high (i.e., 95.7% fasted overnight\nand provided a urine specimen deemed suitable for analysis).\nJournal of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\npated in the physical examination (68% of those inter-\nviewed). Disproportionately high nonparticipation rates\nwere found among the healthiest and least healthy respon-\ndents. Overall, persons who received the medical examina-\ntion reported the same average health status (on a 5-point\nscale) as those who did not. Although respondents older\nthan 70 years were less likely than younger persons to par-\nticipate, sex and measures of socioeconomic status were not\nsignificantly related to participation. These results suggest\nthat, in the presence of controls for age, estimates based on\nthe biomarkers are unlikely to be seriously biased (14).\nSurvival status was ascertained in 2003 by linking to the\nHousehold Registration file of the Taiwanese Ministry of\nInterior. Among the 1023 examination participants, there\nunknown vital status in 2003. After excluding persons with\nmissing vital status (14), missing data on explanatory\nvariables (65), and proxy interviews (17), the analysis sample\nExplanatory Variables\nThe 13 biomarkers examined in this study were included\nin SEBAS because of their hypothesized association with\nstressful experiences and chronic disease. They comprise six\nstandard clinical indicators of cardiovascular risk and\nmetabolic activity and seven nonclinical biomarkers related\nto hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal (HPA) axis activity,\nsympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and inflamma-\ntory response.\nBlood and urine specimens were analyzed at Union\nClinical Laboratories (UCL) in Taipei. In addition to routine\nstandardization and calibration tests performed by the\nlaboratory staff, during the early stages of fieldwork nine\nindividuals outside of the sample contributed triplicate sets\nof specimens: Two sets were submitted to UCL, and a third\nset was sent to Quest Diagnostics in the United States for the\npurpose of checking laboratory reliability.\nSystolic and diastolic blood pressures (in mmHg) were\nmeasured as the average of two seated blood pressure\nreadings taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer at least\n20 minutes after the respondent arrived at the hospital. The\nbody mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by\nheight squared (kg/m2). Measures of IGF-1, IL-6, DHEA-S,\ntotal cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-\nterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were obtained\nfrom the fasting blood sample. Epinephrine, norepinephrine,\ncortisol, and dopamine measurements were based on the 12-\nhour overnight urine sample to provide integrated values of\nbasal operating levels during a time that most participants\nwere resting; they are measured in micrograms per gram\n(lg/g) creatinine to adjust for body size. The assays used to\nmeasure the biomarkers derived from the blood and urine\nsamples are described elsewhere (15).\n91), sex, and urban or rural residence as demographic control\nvariables (and to adjust for the sampling design). Because of\npotential reverse causality (i.e., the possibility that prior\nhealth may influence biomarkers), we incorporated extensive\ncontrols for health in 2000. These comprise (i) measures of\nchronic conditions, mobility limitations, global self-rated\nhealth, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function; (ii) a 5-\npoint measure of the respondent's typical level of pain; and\n(iii) a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent\nsmoked in the past 6 months.\nThe measure of current illness counts the number (0\u00ad12)\nof chronic conditions reported by the respondent including:\nhigh blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, cancer or\nmalignant tumor, lower respiratory tract disease, arthritis or\nrheumatism, gastric ulcer or stomach ailment, liver or gall\nbladder disease, cataracts, kidney disease, gout, and spinal\nor vertebral spurs. The measure of mobility limitations\ncounts the number (0\u00ad9) of physical tasks that the re-\nspondent reported difficulty performing without aid in-\ncluding: standing continuously for 15 minutes and for 2\nhours, squatting, raising both hands over the head, grasping\nor turning objects with the fingers, lifting or carrying an\nflights of stairs. Global self-rated health is described by\na three-category reformulation of the conventional 5-point\nordinal scale (excellent/good; average; not-so-good/poor).\nDepressive symptoms are measured by a 10-item short-form\nof the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale\n(CES-D), coded according to standard practice (potential\nrange 0\u00ad30). Previous studies have demonstrated that\na shortened form of the CES-D yields similar internal\nconsistency, factor structure, and accuracy in detecting\ndepressive symptoms as the full 20-item CES-D among\nelderly Chinese people (16). Cognitive function is a count of\ncognitive tasks completed correctly, including basic orien-\ntation questions, a series of four subtractions, and immediate\nmemory recall (potential range 0\u00ad24).\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe estimated a series of four logistic regression models\nto describe the associations between the biomarkers and\nBecause the clustered sampling design may lead to under-\nestimates of standard errors, we incorporated random effects\nfor the primary sampling units. A baseline model includes the\ndemographic and health control variables. The standard\nclinical markers are added in Model 1; the nonclinical\nbiomarkers replace the clinical measures in Model 2. Model 3\nincludes both sets of biomarkers. All biomarkers are specified\nas continuous variables. Because outliers can have a sub-\nstantial influence on the parameter estimates, we recoded 25\nbiomarker values in the study sample that were larger than\nfive standard deviations from the mean to equal this cut point.\nWe explored the inclusion of linear and quadratic terms in\nthe models, because both low and high values of some\nmeasures (e.g., BMI, cortisol, diastolic blood pressure, and\nepinephrine) have been shown to be associated with adverse\nhealth outcomes (17). We included a quadratic term if two\nconditions were satisfied: (i) the quadratic term was sig-\nnificant (p , .05) in a model that included only that\nbiomarker along with age and sex; and (ii) the quadratic term\nremained marginally significant (p , .10) in a model that\nincluded all control variables, all biomarkers, and the qua-\ndratic terms satisfying the first condition. We excluded the\nquadratic term for systolic blood pressure because of its high\ncorrelation (0.7) with diastolic blood pressure, and because\nthe literature suggests that the relationship between systolic\nblood pressure and mortality is monotonic (18). Because of\nthe limited sample size, we do not include interaction terms in\nthese models--for example, to capture potentially different\neffects of the biomarkers on mortality by sex or age.\nIn addition to identifying significant coefficients, we\nprovide statistical comparisons of Model 1 (the standard\nclinical model) and Model 2 (the nonclinical biomarker\nmodel). We use likelihood-ratio tests for nested models to\nascertain the joint significance of the set of standard or\nnonclinical markers. In addition, we calculate the receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the accu-\nracy of the models in discriminating between decedents and\nsurvivors (19). For a given model, the ROC curve compares\nthe probability that the regression equation correctly predicts\ndeath for persons who died (sensitivity) with the probability\nof an incorrect prediction among survivors (1 \u00c0 specificity)\nacross the entire range of possible cut points. We use the area\nunder the ROC curve (AUC) to summarize the performance\nof a model (higher values indicate better accuracy) and\ncompare AUC values between models based on a chi-square\ntest (20). All analyses were performed using Stata 8.2 (21).\nRESULTS\nAverage values and standard deviations of the demo-\ngraphic variables and biomarkers are shown in Table 1.\nEstimates from the logistic models are shown in Table 2.\nThe baseline model (incorporating only the demographic\nand health controls) is not shown, but statistics derived from\nthis model are presented in a footnote to the table.\nModels 1 and 2 reveal that, despite the small number of\ndeaths, numerous biomarkers are significantly (p , .05)\nrelated to survival: BMI, diastolic blood pressure, and\nHbA1c for the clinical factors; and epinephrine and IL-6 for\nthe neuroendocrine and immune markers. The association\nwith mortality is positive for HbA1c and IL-6, whereas for\nBMI, epinephrine, and diastolic blood pressure, both high\nand low values are associated with higher death rates than\nare intermediate values. The odds ratios change slightly\nwhen both sets of factors are included in Model 3; HbA1c is\nno longer significant at the .05 level.\nLikelihood ratio tests suggest that both sets of biomarkers\nare significantly related to survival. Comparisons of Models\n1 and 2 with the baseline model indicate that inclusion of\neither set of biomarkers significantly improves the model\n(p \u00bc .04 for the standard clinical markers and p , .001 for\nthe nonclinical markers). Similarly, in comparison with the\nfull model (Model 3), removal of either set of markers\nresults in a significantly poorer fit (p \u00bc .04 for the clinical\nmeasures and p , .001 for the nonclinical ones).\nTwo comparative assessments provide evidence that the\nnonclinical biomarker model is superior to the standard\nclinical one. First, the nonclinical biomarker model has\nhaving the same number of parameters, suggesting better\nexplanatory power (19). Second, the ROC curves depicted\nin Figure 1 illustrate the better discriminatory power of the\nnonclinical biomarker model. Chi-square tests indicate that\nthe nonclinical model has a significantly higher AUC than\ndifference between the standard clinical and baseline models\nin AUC between the clinical and nonclinical models is\nmarginally significant (p , .09). Although it is plausible\nthat the superior performance of the neuroendocrine and\nimmune measures results from correlation between the\nclinical markers and self-reported health measures, the re-\nsults remain essentially unchanged when we exclude\nDISCUSSION\nIn this population-based study of older Taiwanese in-\ndividuals, both standard clinical markers of cardiovascular\nand metabolic function and nonclinical biomarkers of HPA-\naxis, SNS, and immune activity are significantly associated\nwith all-cause mortality. An unanticipated finding is that the\nneuroendocrine and immune markers are better predictors of\nmortality than the conventional risk factors. The notion that\n``primary mediators'' affect disease largely through their\neffects on ``secondary outcomes'' is not supported by our\nresults: The associations between nonclinical biomarkers and\nmortality change little after adjustment for conventional bio-\nmarkers. These findings strongly suggest that neuroendocrine\nand immune dysregulation may represent more than a pre-\ncursor to clinical decline as captured by the cardiovascular\nand metabolic system measures included in this analysis.\nTable 1.

The Framingham Heart Study revealed that\nhigh levels of circulating IL-6 and low levels of IGF-1 were\nassociated with increased mortality after adjustment for\nimportant clinical conditions (9); similar results were ob-\ntained for a cohort of older women in the Women's Health\nand Aging Study (4). The Iowa 65\u00fe Rural Health Study\nindicated that higher IL-6 levels were associated with\nsubstantially greater risk of death (5).\nEstimates from Western populations also suggest that\nHPA-axis and SNS activity are related to survival. Although\nmost studies document linkages between cortisol levels and\nthe presence of chronic conditions and illnesses, cortisol\nlevels have been shown to be predictive of mortality among\nadults who suffered an acute myocardial infarction (22) or\na stroke (6,23). DHEA-S, which is believed to counterbalance\nthe effects of cortisol, is associated with mortality risks among\nmen (7,10). Older persons with high baseline urinary ex-\ncretion of epinephrine or norepinephrine in the MacArthur\nStudies of Successful Aging had higher risks of dying (8).\nThe greater importance of nonclinical as compared with\nstandard risk factors for older-age mortality is consistent\nwith findings that conventional clinical measures are less\npredictive of morbidity and mortality among elderly persons\nthan among younger persons. For example, higher levels of\ncholesterol and blood pressure are generally related to\nhigher adult mortality, but at older ages the relationship has\nbeen U-shaped or sometimes inverse (24\u00ad26). Research also\nsuggests that the relationship of BMI with mortality\nweakens at older ages (27).\nA limitation of the present study is the small number of\ndeaths. The low statistical power makes it impossible to rule\nout associations between specific biomarkers and survival\nor to assess the relative importance of different individual\nmarkers. A second limitation pertains to nonresponse: The\nselective exclusion of the healthiest and most disabled re-\nspondents from the medical examination portion of the\nstudy may lead to biased estimates. In addition, because of\nTable 2.

For example, previous studies have docu-\nmented that: (i) the distributions of the biomarkers included\nin this analysis, especially the clinical measures, differ\nbetween Taiwan and the United States (28), and (ii) the\neffects of clinical biomarkers on mortality are likely to vary\nacross populations (29).\nNonetheless, the findings of this study are sufficiently\nrobust to suggest that, taken as a group, the neuroendocrine\nand immune markers are important predictors of future\nsurvival. They are likely to provide additional warning signs\nof deteriorating health and function above and beyond what\ncan be learned from standard clinical measures. That is,\nthese markers may indicate risk even when the clinical\nmarkers do not, suggesting that they may represent a direct\npathway to mortality. At the same time, the results are not\nsufficient to warrant the inclusion of these nonclinical mea-\nsures in a standard diagnostic toolkit. We have little infor-\nmation regarding what constitutes normal or abnormal\nlevels of these markers, a limited understanding of the extent\nto which changes over time reflect normal processes of\naging or are causally linked to health and survival, and few\nnotions about how to modify levels of these markers (or,\nindeed, whether modification would ultimately enhance\nsurvival). With additional research, we are virtually certain\nto witness an expansion of the list of clinically assessed\nmeasures that are predictive of future survival.\n"
