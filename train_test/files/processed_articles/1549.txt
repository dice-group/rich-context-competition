Sepsis incidence and mortality have\nincreased over the course of several decades [2-4]. In addition\nto being common and often lethal, sepsis is costly, with an\nannual economic burden estimated at $16.7 billion [5].\nSince 1992, sepsis has been defined by consensus as a sys-\ntemic inflammatory response syndrome of infectious origin [6].\nThe failure of one or more organ systems or the occurrence of\nhypoperfusion in conjunction with sepsis is considered to be\nsevere sepsis. Severe sepsis accompanied by hypotension is\nseptic shock [7]. Death in septic patients has not been\nexplained by autopsy studies, but it has been suggested that\nthe cause of death is usually multiple organ failure [8,9].\nCI: confidence interval; ICD: International Classification of Disease; MCOD: multiple-cause-of-death; RR: rate ratio.\nCritical Care Vol 13 No 1 Melamed and Sorvillo\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nKnown risk factors for developing sepsis include advanced\nage, male gender and non-white race [5,10]. Comorbidities\ncommonly associated with the condition include HIV infection,\ncancer, cirrhosis, alcohol dependence and pressure ulcers\nA number of recent studies have used administrative datasets\nto assess the burden and epidemiological features of sepsis\nfrom a multi-state sample of non-federal hospitals to assess\nthe incidence, outcome and economic burden of severe sep-\nsis in the United States for the calendar year of 1995 [5]. Dom-\nbrovskiy and colleagues have employed discharge data from\nthe New Jersey State Inpatient Database and the Nationwide\nInpatient Sample to investigate trends and disparities in sepsis\nas well as severe sepsis on the state and national level\n[2,18,19]. Martin and colleagues [4] used the National Hospi-\ntal Discharge Survey to quantify sepsis over a 21-year period,\nwhile Esper and colleagues [17] used the same data to probe\nat the role of comorbidity in sepsis disparities.\nFew population-based sources of data can be used to investi-\ngate the burden of sepsis-associated mortality on a national\nlevel. To date, investigators have relied on samples of hospital\nare weighted to extrapolate to national-level estimates and are\ntherefore particularly vulnerable to sampling bias. Furthermore,\nmortality estimates from hospital data cannot be population\nbased because sepsis-associated deaths may occur in non-\nhospital settings.\nThis study assessed sepsis-associated mortality using United\nStates multiple-cause of-death (MCOD) data. Although\nMCOD data has been used to estimate national-level mortality\nrates for a variety of health conditions [16,21-25], we are not\naware of previous studies that used this source of data to\naddress sepsis. We have examined MCOD data from 1999 to\n2005 to determine population-based estimates, trends and\ndisparities in sepsis-related mortality.\nMaterials and methods\nWe obtained MCOD data for sepsis-associated deaths occur-\nbecause 2005 was the most recent year for which data were\navailable, and because MCOD coding practices changed\nyear that the data were coded according to the International\nClassification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [26]. MCOD\ndata are abstracted from death certificates by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics [27]. This study relied on publicly\nand de-identified data on deceased individuals, and conse-\nquently does not constitute research with human subjects\naccording to Title 45, part 45, of the Code of Federal Regula-\ntions [28]. The University of Southern California exempts such\nresearch from Institutional Review Board oversight [29].\nThe underlying cause of death is \"the disease or injury which\ninitiated the train of morbid events leading directly or indirectly\nto death or the circumstances of the accident or violence\nwhich produced the fatal injury\" [30]. National Center for\nHealth Statistics employs underlying cause of death to report\nnational mortality statistics. Sepsis is known to affect the eld-\nerly and other populations with high rates of chronic condi-\npatients with underlying pathologies, sepsis may be a neces-\nsary condition in the causal pathway leading to death, but may\nnot be listed as the underlying cause of death. Similarly, in\ncases where sepsis results from nosocomial infection, the\noriginal reason for hospitalisation, rather than sepsis, is often\nlisted as the underlying cause of death. Consequently, analy-\nses restricted only to decedents with sepsis listed as the\nunderlying cause of death will significantly underestimate the\ntrue burden of sepsis-associated mortality.\nSepsis-related death was defined as a death where any of the\nfollowing ICD-10 codes appears in any field of the death cer-\ntificate: A40.0 (septicaemia due to streptococcus, group A),\n(septicaemia due to streptococcus, group C), A40.3 (septi-\ncaemia due to streptococcal pneumonia), A40.8 (other strep-\ntococcal septicaemia), A40.9 (streptococcal septicaemia,\nunspecified), A41.0 (septicemia due to Staphylococcus\naureus), A41.1 (septicaemia due to other specified staphylo-\ncoccus), A41.2 (septicaemia due to other unspecified staphy-\nlococcus), A41.3 (septicaemia due to Haemophilus\n(septicaemia due to other Gram-negative organisms), A41.8\n(other specified septicaemia), A41.9 (septicaemia, unspeci-\nfied), A02.1 (salmonella septicaemia), A22.7 (anthrax septi-\ncaemia), A26.8 (erysipelothrix septicaemia), A32.7 (listerial\nsepticaemia), A42.7 (actinomycotic septicaemia), B00.7 (her-\npesviral septicaemia), and B37.7 (candidal septicaemia). Like\nother researchers who have investigated sepsis utilising\nadministrative datasets, we used ICD codes for septicaemia to\nFor sepsis-associated deaths we analysed age, sex, race, eth-\nnicity, year-of-death, place-of-death and any other medical\nconditions mentioned on the death certificate. A single five-\ncategory race/ethnicity variable was created by treating all\nthose with Hispanic ethnicity as Hispanic, and categorising all\nnon-Hispanics according to race group (black, Asian, Ameri-\ncan Indian/Alaska Native, white). Age categories employed in\nstandardisation and calculation of age-specific rates and\nMortality rates were calculated using bridged-race population\nestimates from the National Center for Health Statistics\n[31,32]. Age-adjusted rates were standardised to the popula-\ntion of the United States in 2000. Statistical comparison of\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/13/1/R28\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmedians was accomplished with Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney\ntests for independent samples. Differences in rate ratios were\ncompared using chi-squared tests for homogeneity. Unless\notherwise noted all reported rates and rate-ratios are age-\nadjusted. Rate ratios (RR) are the only measure of relative risk\nreported. Confidence intervals (CI) for rates and rate-ratios\nwere calculated based on variance estimates derived from the\nPoisson distribution. Time trends were assessed using Pois-\nson regression.

Of the sepsis-associated deaths\nidentified in this study, only 22.7% (1.4% of all deaths during\nthe study period) would be attributed to sepsis using the\nunderlying-cause-of-death classification. An underlying-cause-\nof-death approach to quantifying the burden of sepsis mortal-\nity, as used by the National Center for Health Statistics in its\nannual mortality report, may substantially underestimate the\ncontribution of the syndrome to deaths in the United States\nAverage annual race-, sex- and age-specific rates of sepsis-associated mortality in the United States, 1999 to 2005\nCategory Females Male Overall\nRace\nAge (years)\n*Rates standardised to the US Census 2000 populations.\nCI = confidence interval.\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/13/1/R28\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n[1]. The MCOD approach is particularly appropriate in the\nanalysis of sepsis mortality because the vast majority of sepsis\ncases occur in elderly individuals and others whose deaths are\nRates of sepsis-associated mortality were highest among\nblacks and lowest among Asians. Women were less likely to\nexperience sepsis-related death than men in all race/ethnicity\ngroups. The large majority of sepsis-related deaths occurred in\nhospitals, clinics and medical centres, but the proportion of\ndeath occurring in other settings was significant.\nThese data confirm previous findings of significant disparities\nin sepsis mortality between men and women, and among dif-\nferent races [2,18]. Comparable disparities have frequently\nbeen reported for incidence of sepsis and severe sepsis\nAlthough several studies have stratified their analysis of sepsis\naccording to race [4,18-20], there is a paucity of data on sep-\nsis-associated mortality rates in Hispanics, American Indians/\nAlaska Natives and Asians. Earlier studies found that, relative\nto whites, blacks and other non-whites have a higher incidence\nof sepsis [4,18-20]. Our data indicates that blacks experience\nthe highest rates of sepsis-related mortality. However, sepsis-\nrelated mortality for other non-white groups is heterogeneous.\nAsians have the lowest rates of all groups including whites.\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Natives and Hispanics, on the other\nhand, have intermediate rates of sepsis-related mortality.\nThese differences may reflect distinct rates of incidence and\ncase fatality in these populations and should be studied sepa-\nrately. Our findings may also reflect disparities in access to\nhealth care. Encouragingly, rates of sepsis-associated mortal-\nity exhibited downward trends in all high-risk groups with the\nsteepest decline for blacks (1.60% per year).\nCompared with whites, both American Indians/Alaska Natives\nand blacks experienced peak relative risk for sepsis-associ-\nated death in their thirties and forties. A previous study\nshowed an analogous trend for sepsis incidence among\nblacks in New Jersey [18]. Another recent study of multi-state\nhospital inpatient data also noted that the rate of sepsis inci-\ndence among blacks diverged from whites at a young age\n[20]. The comparable rate ratio curves of blacks and American\nIndians/Alaska Natives indicate a similar early onset of vulner-\nability for sepsis-related death. The occurrence of parallel pat-\nterns of vulnerability in two racially-disparate groups suggests\na possible social mechanism for the disparities. However, it is\nlikely that genetic as well as social factors underlie racial dis-\nparities in sepsis mortality, and further research will be useful\nto elucidate such mechanisms. Unfortunately, MCOD data do\nnot provide indicators of socioeconomic status (such as geo-\ngraphical or income data) that would allow an investigation of\nthe relation between such factors and racial disparities in sep-\nsis-associated mortality.\nOur study indicates that the age-adjusted rate of sepsis mor-\ntality exhibited a very slight downward trend, decreasing by\na study by Dombrovskiy and colleagues which used discharge\ndata from the Nationwide Inpatients Sample to show a rapid\nincrease in the incidence and mortality of severe sepsis\nnational age-adjusted rate of severe sepsis mortality increased\nannually by 5.6% during this period [2]. Although our study\nlooked at all sepsis-related deaths, while Dombrovskiy and col-\nleagues confined their analysis to severe sepsis, this differ-\nence in approaches should not produce conflicting mortality\ntrends. Most decedents included in our study would be\nexpected to have experienced severe sepsis even when organ\nfailure is not listed on the death certificate, because organ fail-\nure is the mechanism by which sepsis causes death. Further-\nmore, reanalysing the data only for those sepsis-associated\ndeaths that had a mention of organ failure on their death\nrecord did not alter our findings.\nWhen we restricted our analysis to individuals who were inpa-\ntients at the time of their death, and to the period of overlap\nbetween our study and that reported by Dombrovskiy and col-\nassociated mortality showed a slight annual increase of 0.16%\n(P = 0.01). Although this last result does represent a reversal\nof trend, our analyses of all sepsis-associated deaths and of\nsepsis-associated deaths occurring in inpatient facilities dem-\nAge-specific rate-ratios for sepsis-associated death by race/ethnicity\nAge-specific rate-ratios for sepsis-associated death by race/ethnicity\nwere used as the referent group.

The contradictory results may reflect increasing sensitiv-\nity in diagnosis and/or coding of severe sepsis in Nationwide\nInpatients Sample data or changes in the attribution and cod-\ning of sepsis on death certificates. In addition the practice of\nsampling and weighting may bias estimates based on Nation-\nwide Inpatients Sample data. The disagreement in trends war-\nrants further investigation and underscores the importance of\nconsulting multiple data sources for determining disease\nburden.\nAlthough our data showed that age-adjusted mortality\ndecreased very slightly over the study period, crude sepsis-\nrelated mortality exhibited the opposite trend. The slight\ndecrease in age-adjusted mortality suggests minor improve-\nments in prevention and/or treatment of sepsis. The increasing\ncrude mortality illustrates that population ageing is, and will\ncontinue to be, a significant driver of sepsis mortality.\nOur data confirms earlier findings that men are at increased\nrisk of sepsis death compared with women, and mirrors previ-\nously reported sex disparities in sepsis incidence\ntibility to sepsis-related death varied by racial group (P <\nsepsis-associated death. However, the excess risk for Asian\nmen was twice as large, while for American Indians/Alaska\nNatives being male increased the likelihood of sepsis-related\ndeath by only 7%. The reasons underlying these differences\ncannot be ascertained from MCOD data. Genetic and hormo-\nnal factors, as well as varying prevalence of comorbid condi-\ntions have been implicated in sex-linked disparities in sepsis,\nand may all contribute to the pattern of disease observed in\nWe found that many of the chronic conditions previously asso-\nciated with sepsis commonly appear on death records which\nlist sepsis as a cause of death. The frequency with which\ncomorbidities are seen on death records that cite sepsis as a\ncause of death often differs from the reported frequency of\nthese conditions in incident sepsis cases [4,5,17]. This finding\nis not surprising because data from death records do not\nreflect all prevalent conditions in decedents [35]. A condition\ndiagnosed in an individual whose death is sepsis-related\nwould not appear on the death record if the clinician complet-\ning the certificate were unaware of the diagnosis, or did not\nbelieve the condition to be an important contributor to the\ndeath. The frequency with which sepsis and a particular\ncomorbidity appear on the same death record does not reflect\nthe frequency of that comorbidity in sepsis decedents; rather\nit reflects the frequency with which that condition acts as a\ncause of death when sepsis is also a cause [35].\nMCOD data is truly population-based because of the compul-\nsory nature of death reporting in the United States. Our find-\nings indicate that 13.1% of sepsis-associated deaths occur in\nnon-hospital settings. These deaths would not be counted in\nstudies that rely on hospital discharge databases. In addition\nMCOD data is not vulnerable to sampling bias. However,\nMCOD data has many limitations characteristic of other\nadministrative datasets.\nWe cannot directly assess the accuracy of the data. Misclas-\nsification of sepsis-related death can result from errors in diag-\nnosis and in the completion of death certificates. Many\nphysicians do not receive formal training in completing death\ncertificates and may disagree on the cause of death [36].\nAdditionally, errors may occur in coding of death certificate\ndata. As there are no codes for sepsis in ICD-10, we have\nused codes for septicaemia as a proxy. Septicaemia codes\nhave been used to study sepsis in administrative datasets\napproach for ICD-9 codes, showing a positive predictive value\ncated by the relatively low negative predictive value, the use of\nsepticaemia codes underestimates the burden of sepsis,\nprobably due to the occurrence of sepsis in patients without\nrecognised blood-borne infections. As ICD-10 codes have not\nbeen validated for studies of sepsis, our case definition may\nproduce additional misclassification. In addition to error in the\nnumbers of sepsis-related death, rates calculated in our study\nmay also be biased by population estimates. Uncertainty in\ndenominator values results from error in the census count, and\nfrom the fact that the population structure for intercensal years\nis extrapolated [31,32]. An additional limitation in our study is\nthat causative organisms were recorded on death certificates\nof only 7% of decedents. This omission makes it impossible to\nreliably assess the relative contribution of various types of\nmicroorganisms to sepsis-associated mortality.\nConclusions\ndeaths in the United States. Our study shows that the rapid\nrise in sepsis mortality seen in previous decades has slowed,\nbut that ageing of the United States population continues to\ndrive growth in the overall burden of sepsis-associated mortal-\nity. Disparities in sepsis-associated mortality mirror those pre-\nviously reported for sepsis incidence. However, the age and\nsex distribution, as well as rates of sepsis-related death, are\ndistinct in Asians, Hispanics and American Indians/Alaska\nNatives. It is important to study the epidemiology of sepsis in\neach of these groups because aggregate measures may\nobscure important differences. The trends in sepsis-associ-\nated mortality found in this study contradict reports from pre-\nvious investigations and must be confirmed.\nAvailable online http://ccforum.com/content/13/1/R28\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAM designed the study, carried out statistical analysis and\ninterpretation of the data, and drafting of the manuscript.
