Actions-orientated behavior\nenables the leader to appropriately articulate relations and task orientation to meet the immediate contextual demands and\nto accommodate followership toward change and development. The leadership actions-orientated behavior of Finnish school\nprincipals were studied in three schools. In-depth interviews with school actors (principals, vice principals, teachers, special\neducators, and nonteaching staff) were conducted to triangulate the analyzed data. It was found that leadership actions-oriented\nbehavior enabled school leaders to articulate appropriate behavioral patterns to generate motivation and commitment. The\nresults suggest that actions orientations toward high-on relations enabled leaders to achieve leadership success, while actions\norientations toward high-on task enabled leadership effectiveness. Actions-oriented behavior toward high-on task enables\nleadership flexibility with greater leadership elasticity. The results suggest that school actors anticipated a relational approach,\nwhose actions orientations were high-on task. The results also suggest that relations-oriented behavior is rationally applied by\nschool leaders who have remained in the organization for a longer time to strengthen the systematic approach. It was found\nthat leaders' actions orientation with high-on task were more effective, while leadership actions orientation with high-on\nrelations generated social harmony. The results suggest that leadership actions-oriented behavioral flexibility and mobility can\nbe maintained by articulating high relations to low relations and high task to low task, not necessarily from task to relations or\nrelations to task alone. In doing so, a leader's personality is prevented from distortions and behavior dysfunction.\n",

If this is to be believed, how did Finland\nachieve such success, while having been oppressed by neigh-\nboring nations during political conflicts in the 1930s and late\n1940s? The quest to achieve this success lay solely in the\nhands of the educational leadership of the nation. Although\neducational leadership can have an immense impact on the\neducational system of the country, school leadership can\nsimultaneously make an equivalent contribution to growth\nfrom within the system. Effective school leadership leads to\nschool success, which, in turn, can help a nation's citizens to\nthrive. Accordingly, to improve the educational system, only\nqualified teachers should be allowed to teach. Similarly, in\nFinland, to be a qualified teacher, a master's degree is man-\ndatory, while schooling starts at the age of 7 for Grade 1\nThe Finnish education system is well known through the\nexcellent performance of its students in the Programme for\nInternational Student Assessment (PISA). However, the stan-\ndard of this performance has recently fallen (Organization for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development [OECD], 2016).\nIn Finland, free education offers equality to all and shows\nconcern for all students, including special students (disabled\nstudents) from primary education through to higher educa-\ntion. In line with this principle of equality, Finnish legislation\nhas initiated a series of special-education laws to protect the\nwell-being of the special student. This legislature provides for\nthree models. These are general support, intensive support,\nand special support (Pesonen et al., 2015). This enables\nschool leaders to support a quality education system in\nschools by offering adequate facilities with a focus on special\n1Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Del Per\u00fa, Lima, Peru\nCorresponding Author:\nMani Man Singh Rajbhandari, Professor/Researcher, CENTRUM Graduate\nBusiness School, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Del Per\u00fa, Lima, Peru.\nEmail: mannierajbhandari@hotmail.com\nLeadership Actions-Oriented Behavioral\nStyle to Accommodate Change and\nDevelopment in Schools\nMani Man Singh Rajbhandari1\n Keywords\nleadership behavior, actions-oriented behavior, relations-oriented behavior, task-oriented behavior, contextual variation,\nleader's case study, behavioral articulation, Finland, Skills, Ability, Competences and Intelligence (SACI)\n2 SAGE Open\nneeds and care (Rajbhandari, 2016a). Furthermore, this offers\nopportunities for special students to enroll in schools that are\nconveniently located. The model for special education differs\nfrom that of general education, and offers equality and justice\nfor all. Consequently, it became mandatory for the special-\nstudent law to be applied in all schools in Finland, which\nposed certain logistical and financial challenges. Emanating\nfrom these challenges were new problems with the manage-\nment in school and its leadership due to the emergence of new\ncontextual variations in the school environment.\nTo achieve progress toward change, the school leader is\nequally challenged to \"grow\" the periphery of qualified\nteachers, especially to direct and instruct the teachers\ntoward the betterment of students and school development.\nTherefore, school leaders as change agents face challeng-\ning moments in leadership, where contextual intelligence\nand contextual experience, which were initially explained\nas practical intelligence (Sternberg, 1985), can generate\nactions-oriented behavior according to the requirements of\nthe contextual variants. This requires of leadership to\nunderstand, adapt, and initiate behavior according to the\nrequirements of the situation among the followers, and\nwithin the followership domain. This actions-oriented\nbehavior is the leader's primary means of incorporating the\nappropriate blend of relations- and task-orientated behav-\nior guided by the leader's Skills, Abilities, Competences\nand Intelligence (SACI) to best suit the primary situational\ncontext. Moreover, within the school setting, classes are\nsteered by more than one teacher, thus necessitating team-\nwork, which has to be planned and organized by the school\nleader. As organizing and planning can consume most of\nthe leader's time and energy, the appropriate blend of rela-\ntions and task orientation, whether high or low on any of\nthese behavioral orientations, can be achieved by school\nleaders through their actions-oriented behavior. Actions-\noriented behavior provides a means of restoring leadership\nequilibrium by mediating the gaps between internal and\nexternal variables.\nDespite the fact that variations within and between con-\ntexts is inevitable, school leaders have to respond appropri-\nately to prevent situational catastrophe. In responding,\nschool leaders are able to apply various patterns of behav-\nioral styles to coordinate school actors (such as teachers,\nadministrative staff, and students) by instituting collabora-\ntion for organizational change. This further enables school\nleaders to implement suitable behavioral leadership pat-\nterns to motivate school actors to adopt immediate organi-\nzational changes. Consequently, this study explored the\nleadership readiness behavioral pattern in three schools that\nhad different environmental cultures, climates, school\nsizes, and capacities in Finland.\nIn this study, leadership behavior was explored as a case\nstudy to identify the appropriate leadership behavior of each\nschool leader. This study was conducted by constructing a\ntheoretical framework incorporating behavioral leadership\ntheory which originated at Ohio State University and the\nUniversity of Michigan. The leadership philosophical para-\ndigm is vague. Moreover, leadership success and effective-\nness is appraised by the leader's ability in time management,\ntask accomplishment with individuals and groups within sit-\nuational context. This is in connection with philosophy of\nbased on the concepts of building, bonding, and banking.\nWith regard to the philosophical paradigm of leadership\nbehavioral patterns, school leadership readiness--to attain\ncompetence, prudency, and pragmatic endurance--can be\nattained by team building with task orientation, team bond-\ning with relational orientation, and banking both the behav-\nioral actions orientations with intelligence. To endure the\ninternal affairs of the academic realm, school leadership has\nto attempt to curtail pitfalls by communicating effectively,\nand becoming confident in attaining the common goal by\nwinning trust for employee productivity.\nLeadership effectiveness and success depends largely on\nthe leader's behavioral patterns. Using behavioral leadership\ntheory, studies conducted at Ohio State University in the year\nbehavior as either \"initiation\" or \"consideration,\" \"people-\noriented\" or \"task-oriented,\" and \"employee-centered\" or\n\"job-centered.\" Later, these behaviors were named as rela-\ntions-oriented and task-oriented behaviors (Northouse,\n2010). Leadership behavioral patterns of collaboration, task,\nand relations are, however, implemented within the contex-\ntual setting, which enables the leader to use their practical\nintelligence (Sternberg, 2003) to illustrate actions behavioral\norientations according to situational variations. This initiates\nthe leadership to illustrate effective behavior of relations and\ntask for building team and work achievement.\nAccording to Yulk (2008), effective leadership behaviors\nand programs are mutually compatible for creating synergies\neffects rather than the side effects. School leadership success\nand effectiveness significantly enhances teacher's efficiency,\nand student accolade. According to the Appalachia\nEducational Laboratory (2005), leaders' behavioral pattern\nneed to support the student performance through the com-\nmunication with teachers for their effectiveness. The labora-\ntory modeled leadership behavioral patterns in terms of a\nreciprocal-effects model. They claimed that the reciprocal\neffect generates leadership behavior that connects to leader's\nability of interaction, skills to intervening variables, and stu-\ndent achievement. In addition to this, Yulk (2008) suggests\nthat the competence of leadership enables leader's ability to\ncomprehend the situation and adapting to a flexible leader-\nship style for organizational effectiveness.\nTherefore, in exploring leadership actions-oriented\nbehavior within the relations- and task-orientated behavioral\napproaches used to accommodate change and development\nin schools, two research questions were constructed:\nRajbhandari 3\nResearch Question 1: What leadership behavioral style\nwas implemented by school leaders to adopt changes and\ndevelopment in schools?\nResearch Question 2: How did the actions-oriented lead-\nership behavioral style initiate school success and follow-\nership maintenance?\nMethod\nThis study made use of qualitative analysis. The study on lead-\nership actions-oriented behavior of principals in Finnish schools\nwas guided by behavioral leadership theory. The construction\nof the theoretical framework included relations- and task-ori-\nented behavior, which are blended and articulated into the\nactions-orientated behavioral style of principals in Finnish\nschools. Behavioral leadership theory superseded the traits the-\nory of leadership and introduced sophisticated measures to\nunderstand the leadership behavior of relations and task orienta-\ntions. Leadership behavioral orientation was further analyzed to\nexplain the principals'leadership style by illustrating their lead-\nership actions-oriented behavior. This was achieved by studying\nthe appropriate combination of relations and task orientations.\nAs mentioned, behavioral leadership theory was first\nexplored by the Ohio State University in 1945, and later by the\nUniversity of Michigan in 1947, using a quantitative tool\ndeveloped to explain leader behavior--the Leaders Behavioral\nDescription Questionnaire (LBDQ; Stogdill, 1963). This anal-\nysis and the LBDQ were highly acclaimed and accepted within\nleadership study. Although the LBDQ is quantitatively formu-\nlated, this study used key aspects from the LBDQ to understand\nthe qualitative paradigm of leadership actions-oriented behav-\nior by incorporating leadership relations and task orientation.\nThis explorative study offered the opportunity to under-\nstand leadership's actions orientation (blending relations and\ntask) on a deeper level, which the quantitative tool could not\nachieve. Although relations and task orientation are viewed\nas separate behaviors, these two leadership behaviors are not\nmutually exclusive, but together strengthen the bond for\nleaders to execute an actions orientation that utilizes these\nbehavioral patterns simultaneously.\nMoreover, this study is viewed as a different case, with\neach context constituting a different case. Nevertheless, the\ncases are linked by certain commonalities, with school lead-\ners acting as \"gap fillers\" and adapting their behavioral ori-\nentation according to the situations of need within the\ndifferent contexts. Furthermore, within its area of responsi-\nbility and accountability, leadership competence needs to\ncombine relations- and task-oriented behavior to initiate\nactions-orientated behavior that enables school principals to\nfill the gap between internal and external variations.\nResearch Tools and Techniques\nFor the purpose of qualitatively exploring the leadership\nbehavioral patterns of Finnish school principals, one-on-one\nin-depth interviews were conducted with school actors. All\nthe interviews were tape-recorded for reliability and validity\nchecking. Two different sets of interviews were designed.\nOne set of interviews was designed to analyze the interviews\nwith school principals, while the other set of interviews was\ndesigned to analyze and explore the followership domain.\nThese two sets of interview schedules captured the voices of\nschool actors involved within the school setting. Furthermore,\nthese two sets of interview schedules enabled me to verify\nand triangulate the data collected from different data sources,\nwhich included a descriptive analysis of leader initiatives\nand behavioral patterns.\nData Collection and Analysis\nProcedures\nThe method of data collection was conducted by tape-record-\ning. Every detail was recorded to analyze qualitative mean-\nings, which further enabled me to understand the feelings of\nthe respondent on a deeper level. The respondents in this\nstudy were school principals, teachers, administrative staff,\nand special-student teachers. Each interview lasted for at least\n1 hr, and a few interviews were longer than an hour. Interviews\nwere conducted in English and Finnish. For reliability and\nvalidity checking, the tape-recorded interviews were tran-\nscribed, and Finnish interviews were translated and further\ninterpreted to give meaning to the data. The transcribing was\ncompleted by me, which offered me the additional benefit of\nunderstanding each interviewee and capturing their feelings.\nAlthough the interviewee's views were never shared with the\nrespondent, they were used to cross-verify the findings from\nthe leadership behavior descriptive analysis.\nThe respondent data were triangulated further to verify\nthe analysis of the leadership behavior descriptions of rela-\ntions and task orientation toward initiating the actions orien-\ntation. This technique of analysis offered validation and\nreliability for additional cross verification. Data triangula-\ntion analysis (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2002; Lauri,\n2011) contributed significantly to validating the actions-ori-\nented behavioral style of school principals through the lens\nof both relations- and task-orientated behavior. The triangu-\nlation analysis also captured related views from respondents\nin determining the leaders' initiating behavioral pattern\ntoward actions orientation. All respondent identities were\nkept anonymous for ethical reasons. However, to identify the\nrespondents, pseudonyms were used, that is, Teachers 1, 2,\nand 3; special-student teacher; vice principal; and principal.\nSimilarly, schools were identified as Schools A, B, and C.\nResults\nThis section reports on the cases of three schools, and\nendeavors to highlight the leadership actions-oriented behav-\nioral style by articulating both relations-oriented and task-\noriented behavior. The results are based on the analysis of the\n4 SAGE Open\nreflective critical views of the school actors. These collective\nviews were cross-verified by triangulation analysis. However,\nthe three cases are presented independently to address the\nresearch questions.\nLeadership Actions-Oriented Behavior: The Case\nof School A\nLeadership behaviors and skills are essential to use in con-\njunction with trusted staff (Goff, 2003). Identifying trusted\nstaff requires leadership to show consideration of behavioral\npatterns to motivate staff toward task accomplishment. In tak-\ning such a necessary step, appropriate articulation of relations\nand task is needed to enhance leader actions orientation by\nblending the two behaviors. A possible way of knowing and\nunderstanding the staff within the school organization is to\nget involved with them and build good relational behavior.\nThis actions orientation, which is high-on relations, empha-\nsizes the need for school leaders to bring about motivation\nwithin the followership domain. In the case of School A's\nprincipal, her compassionate and generous characters resulted\nin her becoming successful and trusted through initiating rela-\ntions-orientations to accommodate the entire body of school\nactors during times of change. Supporting her actions-ori-\nented behavior of using relational approaches, she stated,\nAs being the head of school, my prime concern is to think about\nthe school, and its staff. I believe in team work, working together\nas a group has helped us so far. I am lenient towards my staff.\nFurthermore, she added,\nWe work in an open environment. We share our issues and\nmatters together with each other for the betterment of our school.\nIt helps us to figure out our problem as well, where we are\nlacking in our teaching method and how much we have achieved\nin our goal so far.\nActions-orientated behavior toward building relations with\nschool actors inspires the working professional staff to col-\nlaborate with the principal when dramatic change takes place\nin the school. Moreover, the principal's actions-oriented\nbehavior of closely collaborating with the vice principal to\nundertake the change process, and bring about an open-door\npolicy of information sharing, helped to motivate the profes-\nsional community. In support of this approach, the vice prin-\ncipal mentions,\nShe believes in sharing information with her staff, even though\nthe decision is made by me or any other staff, she takes the\nresponsibility of that decision on her shoulder. The bond of trust\nbetween principal and her staff is very strong. In one word I\nwould like to say, we rely and trust on each other.\nThis style of actions-oriented behavior describes the princi-\npal's behavioral approach toward school effectiveness. The\nprincipal's actions-orientated strategy, used to influence her\nstaff, was through information sharing. This articulated behav-\nioral orientations by the school leader strengthened the build-\ning of a strong foundation of relations among and between the\nleaders and followership, thus winning the trust of the follow-\nership domain. The vice principal described this by saying,\nThe most important thing in this school about head teacher and\nother staff is, she trust all her staff. She shares all her information\nwith us, which makes the school environment effective and cozy\nto work in. She always wants to have everything, this way she\ncan mention that this is the way I work, she always takes\nresponsibilities for the decision she makes and even though if\nthey comes from the staff or from me.\nThis actions orientation, which is high-on relations and low-\non task, empowered in-group members with crucial informa-\ntion. Information sharing is a way toward building trust\namong and between the school professional communities.\nInformation is shared within the trusted and who have the\nin-group status. In school settings, trust is one of the contrib-\nuting factors shaping for instrumental and forming value-\nbased attitude. To be trusted and trusting people are both\ncomplicated task for school leader. Leadership confidence\nand communicative power to illustrate the vision and show\ndirection is necessary and essential at the time of accommo-\ndating change, which is accomplished together with the\ntrusted individuals of the in-group. To support this view of\nthe principal's open policy trustfulness, an administrative\nstaff member added,\nThe major thing about our principal is that she equips us with\nsufficient information that we need, and I think she trust on her\nstaff.\nAlthough leadership behavior is concerned with relations-\nand task-orientated behavior, it is equally essential for the\nschool leader to apply these two behaviors reciprocally to\nbring about effectiveness. The articulation of these two\nbehavioral styles generates an actions-orientated leadership\nstyle that is either high or low on task and relations, depend-\ning on the situational need of the context and the followers.\nConsequently, trusting and being trusted produce effective-\nness. This behavioral style led to an open socio-environs,\nwhich reflected a good organizational climate. The rela-\ntional-behavioral orientation of the school leader in this\nschool enabled the staff to openly share the problems they\nfaced. Teacher 1 stated,\nShe is very honest and frank, whatever is there in her mind, she\nalways tells us openly, whenever we discuss about any problems,\nand she speaks her words openly. This is why we go to her\nwhenever we have our problem.\nWhether articulating and to orient task and relational behav-\nior are mutually exclusive or not, articulating these behaviors\nRajbhandari 5\naccording to feelings, emotions, and level of trust can vary,\nwhich can be maintained by taking the necessary actions\ntoward relations building. Nevertheless, nature of leadership\nbehavior is flexible and is determined by the contextual set-\ntings and the leader's SACI. According to Yulk (2008), a\nflexible leadership behavioral orientation initiates the leader\nto adapt leadership style-mix based on autocratic, demo-\nThe mixture of leadership style enables a leader to adapt\ntheir behavioral orientation--either high or low, on either\ntask- or relations-oriented behavior--to achieve high pro-\nductivity. The vice principal illustrates the school principal's\nactions-orientated behavioral style of articulating task and\nrelations by stating,\nShe is very helpful and she helps everyone in need, whether its\nteacher or students or even a parent, she is always by our side at\ntimes of need and this is why we rely in her. This is her strongest\npoint.\nArticulation of the actions-oriented behavior of a leader heav-\nily relies and depends upon the contextual variations. The con-\ntextual variation of School A was to bring about changes in the\nschool to align it with international standards by improving the\nschool's structure, leadership capabilities, and followership\ncapacities. This was a radical change initiated by the national\neducational department and municipality. In bringing about\nthis change and development, the leader's role was mainly con-\ncerned with motivation and commitment of the school actors.\nIn directing them toward adopting the changes, the leader was\nrequired to articulate an actions orientation that included both\nrelations- and task-oriented behavior. Nevertheless, many\nschool actors resisted the change. To harmonize the organiza-\ntional climate, the school principal focused on collaboration\namong the school actors by adopting an actions orientation\nhigh-on relations-oriented behavior. This approach encouraged\nthe staff to develop the motivation to work. In other words, by\nexhibiting an actions-oriented behavior toward relations, the\nschool leader was able to participate with, and support, the\nschool's professional community. In connection to Teacher 3,\nthe school principal demonstrated her supportive behavior and\nconcern for people and this actions orientation further contrib-\nuted values to their work\u00adlife values:\nIf I have to name it then that would be our principal, she is very\nencouraging and supportive.\nMoreover, articulating an actions orientation toward relations-\noriented behavior has become a successful phenomenological\napproach for many leaders. However, leadership readiness is\nessential for leadership behavioral flexibility and mobility\n(Rajbhandari, 2014). However, both task- and relations-orien-\ntations are intertwined and inseparable. Moreover, behavioral\narticulation within the followership domain also contributes a\npivotal role in shaping and articulating leadership behavior.\nThe leadership behavior depends largely on, and changes sig-\nnificantly, according to, the actions-oriented behavioral pat-\ntern of the followers and followership domain. Leadership\nbehavior, therefore, is closely interlinked with the follower-\nship domain and the followers' actions orientation.\nThe principal played an essential role in establishing a rela-\ntions orientation in School A through team building and bond-\ning for collaboration, which generated the driving stimulus for\nchange and development. The principal's strategy of actions-\noriented behavior high-on relations was required to enrich\nteam building to facilitate change and remove constraints.\nTeacher 3 in her statement (above) indicates the importance of\nthe principal's role in articulating an actions orientation toward\nhigh-on relations and low-on task, and how this generated col-\nlaborations within the followership domain.\nAlthough the principal articulated high-on relations,\ndevelopment, with the building renovations and curriculum\nchanges, was initiated by task-oriented behavior. This articu-\nlation of actions-oriented behavior enables leaders to blend\nboth the behavioral orientation of relations and task simulta-\nneously and, where necessary, to achieve school effective-\nness. However, too much concern for followership can\nsometime divert from actual task and can generate weak-\nnesses rather than strength.\nThe school principal's versatility in articulating a behav-\nioral orientation, that attained the vision of the higher level\nnational educational authority, was achieved by empowering\nthe school actors through relational bonding between indi-\nviduals and within the team. Her leadership actions-oriented\nbehavior, of distributing some of her works to the in-group,\nalso leaped the school toward success.\nMoreover, the vice principal supported the actions-ori-\nented behavior of the principal regarding distribution of\nauthority to trusted in-group, which afforded time for the\nprincipal to concentrate on the developmental aspects of\nschool, rather than being completely absorbed by daily rou-\ntine activities. The actions orientation toward high-on rela-\ntions of the leader also articulated her SACI in generating the\ndriving forces vigorous by showing appreciation for the\nschool actors. This appreciation motivated the school teach-\ners performance, and to keep pace with the radically chang-\ning environments. Team building played a significant role in\naccomplishing the mission of internationalizing the school.\nActions-oriented behavior for participation and supportive-\nness toward the school actors substantially improved staff\nperformance as a result of improved motivation due to the\nappreciation they received for their efforts.\nIn Finland, complementing and giving praise are not the\ncultural norm. However, articulating actions-oriented behav-\nior toward a high-on relations orientation encouraged and\nmotivated the school actors through the "
