    "reduced_content": "Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC), including the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS), provide the second annual report\nto the nation on progress in cancer prevention and control,\nwith a special section on lung cancer and tobacco smoking.\nMethods: Age-adjusted rates (using the 1970 U.S. standard\npopulation) were based on cancer incidence data from NCI\nand underlying cause of death data compiled by NCHS. The\nprevalence of tobacco use was derived from CDC surveys.\nReported P values are two-sided. Results: From 1990\nand cancer death (-0.6% per year; P = .001) rates for all\nsites combined decreased. Among the 10 leading cancer in-\ncidence sites, statistically significant decreases in incidence\nrates were seen in males for leukemia and cancers of the\nlung, colon/rectum, urinary bladder, and oral cavity and\npharynx. Except for lung cancer, incidence rates for these\ncancers also declined in females. Among the 10 leading can-\ncer mortality sites, statistically significant decreases in can-\ncer death rates were seen for cancers of the male lung, fe-\nmale breast, the prostate, male pancreas, and male brain\nand, for both sexes, cancers of the colon/rectum and stom-\nach. Age-specific analyses of lung cancer revealed that rates\nin males first declined at younger ages and then for each\nolder age group successively over time; rates in females ap-\npeared to be in the early stages of following the same pattern,\nwith rates decreasing for women aged 40\u00ad59 years. Conclu-\nsions: The declines in cancer incidence and death rates, par-\nticularly for lung cancer, are encouraging. However, unless\nrecent upward trends in smoking among adolescents can be\nreversed, the lung cancer rates that are currently declining\nin the United States may rise again. [J Natl Cancer Inst\nthe American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC), which includes the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS), and the National Cancer\nInstitute (NCI) reported the first sustained decline in cancer\nmortality since national record-keeping was instituted in the\n1930s (1\u00ad5). These organizations continue to collaborate, moni-\ntor cancer statistics, and produce an annual report to the nation\non progress related to cancer prevention and control in the\nUnited States.\nThis second report updates and confirms the continuing de-\nclines in cancer incidence and death rates in the United States\nand presents detailed information on the occurrence of lung\ncancer, the leading cause of cancer death, and on tobacco smok-\ning in adults and youth. This report also includes cancer inci-\ndence and death rates in five populations: whites, blacks, Asian\nand Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and\nHispanics.\nAll statistics presented in this report are available at the following internet\naddress:\nwww-seer.ims.nci.nih.gov\nAdditional data, such as annual and age-specific rates and trends, are also avail-\nable at this address or may be accessed on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and\nEnd Results1 (SEER) CD-ROM that may be obtained through the internet ad-\ndress.\nCancer Cases\nInformation on newly diagnosed cancer cases occurring in the United States\nis based on data collected by the NCI's SEER Program (5). Briefly, the SEER\nProgram collects cancer incidence data from 11 population-based registries,\nincluding five states (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah) and\nsix standard metropolitan statistical areas (Atlanta, Detroit, Los Angeles, San\nFrancisco\u00adOakland, San Jose\u00adMonterey, and Seattle\u00adPuget Sound), representing\napproximately 14% of the U.S. population. Cancer incidence data for Alaska\nNatives from Alaska are also included. Estimates of cancer incidence rates and\ntrends for the total United States are frequently based on SEER data; for this\nThe second edition of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology\n(ICDO-2) groupings for the specific cancer sites included in this report have\nbeen published previously (5,6).\nCancer Deaths\nInformation on cancer deaths in the United States is based on causes of death\nreported by the certifying physicians on death certificates filed in state vital\nstatistics offices.

For the period from\nlong-term trends in lung cancer death rates during the period from 1950 through\n1996, deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus also include deaths from\ncancer of the trachea and pleura. To ensure comparability between the ICDA-8\nand ICD-9 codes, ICDA-8 codes on individual records are converted to ICD-9\ncodes by applying a conversion algorithm used by the NCI, and the ICD-9 codes\nare categorized according to SEER site groupings (5).\nCancer Incidence and Death Rates\nWe use resident population estimates for each year from the U.S. Bureau of\nthe Census (12) to compute age-adjusted cancer incidence and death rates;\npopulation data for whites are adjusted slightly for an overcount of whites in\nHawaii (Hawaii Department of Public Health: unpublished data). Because in-\nformation about Hispanic origin is collected separately from race, persons cat-\negorized as Hispanic are not mutually exclusive from whites, blacks, American\nIndians/Alaska Natives, and Asian and Pacific Islanders.\nRates are expressed as per 100 000 population and are age adjusted by the\ndirect method to the 1970 U.S. standard million population. All rates in this\nreport are based on at least 25 cases or deaths. For cancer sites that pertain only\nto males or females, rates are based on sex-specific data. The term \"all sites\"\nrefers to all cancer sites combined, not just to the aggregate of sites included in\neach figure. Specific abbreviations include not otherwise specified (NOS) and\nintrahepatic bile duct (IBD).\nFor cancer incidence rates, the denominators are county-level population data\nfor the geographic areas that participate in the SEER Program. Cancer incidence\nrates for American Indians/Alaska Natives are based on data from Alaska plus\nall SEER registries.\nFor cancer death rates, the denominators are population data for the total\nUnited States, except for Hispanic data. Cancer death rates for Hispanics include\ncancer deaths that occurred in all states except Connecticut, Louisiana, New\nHampshire, and Oklahoma, which are omitted because of the absence of com-\nparable data on Hispanic origin. Cancer death rates for American Indians/Alaska\nNatives include data from all states.\nAnnual Percent Change\nThe annual percent change (APC) is estimated by fitting a regression line to\nthe natural logarithm of the rates by use of calendar year as a regressor variable;\ni.e., y  mx + b, where y  ln (rate) and x  calendar year. Then, the estimated\nAPC  100 \u00d7 (em - 1). Testing the hypothesis that the APC is equal to zero is\nequivalent to testing the hypothesis that the slope of the line in the above\nequation is equal to zero, i.e., that the rate is not increasing or decreasing. The\nhypothesis test statistic uses the t distribution of m/SEm\n, where SE is the standard\nerror of m and the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of\ncalendar years minus 2 (13). The calculation assumes that rates increase or\ndecrease at a constant rate over time, although the validity of this assumption has\nnot been assessed. Statistical significance is assessed by use of two-sided\nPrevalence of  \nThe prevalence of tobacco smoking is based on data collected by the CDC and\nstate departments of health and education in three surveys: the National Health\nInterview Survey (NHIS), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System\n(BRFSS), and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) (14\u00ad18).\nNHIS is a continuous nationwide sample survey of the civilian, noninstitution-\nalized population that is conducted by NCHS (14). Questions on Hispanic origin\ncurrent cigarette smoking prevalence included persons who reported having\nsmoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who reported now smoking\nevery day or on some days. Before 1992, current smokers included persons who\nhad smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who reported smoking\nnow.\nBRFSS is an ongoing system of surveys conducted by state health departments\nin cooperation with the CDC to collect risk factor information and monitor the\neffects of interventions over time (15). Every month, each state uses random-\ndigit-dialing telephone methods to select a probability sample of its civilian,\nstates and the District of Columbia randomly selected a sample of adults aged 18\nyears and older who had telephones. BRFSS estimates for the total United States\nare based on data from 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Of note, BRFSS\nestimates presented in this report for the total United States do not agree exactly\nwith NHIS estimates for the total United States for two reasons: 1) different\nsurvey designs (telephone versus household) and 2) different survey years. Cur-\nrent cigarette smoking prevalence includes adults 18 years old and older who had\never smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who reported now\nsmoking every day or on some days.\nYRBSS consists of biennial, national, state, and local school-based surveys of\nrepresentative samples of high school students (17,18). The national survey uses\na three-stage cluster design, and estimates are weighted to represent students in\ngrades 9\u00ad12 in public and private schools in the 50 states and the District of\nColumbia. The state and local surveys involve a two-stage cluster design and are\nconducted by state and local education agencies and health departments using\nuniform sampling methods but with variable data quality; caution, therefore,\nshould be used when making direct comparisons of estimates across states and\nlocalities. With an overall response rate of at least 60% and appropriate docu-\nmentation for each state and locality, survey data are weighted. In 1997,\nweighted estimates from 24 states and 15 cities can be generalized to all public\nschool students in grades 9\u00ad12 in their respective jurisdictions. Data from nine\nstates and two cities are not weighted and, therefore, apply only to the students\nparticipating in those surveys. Current smoking prevalence includes students in\ngrades 9\u00ad12 who smoked cigarettes on at least one of 30 days preceding the\nsurvey.\nRESULTS\nUpdate\nSEER cancer incidence.

Examination of\nincidence rates for these four sites by\nrace and ethnicity revealed that, except\nfor female breast cancer, blacks had\nhigher incidence rates than the other\nracial and ethnic populations. Al-\nthough cancer of the uterine corpus\nand uterus NOS was common to all\nfive racial and ethnic groups among\nthe top 10 incidence sites, some sites\ntended to be unique to a specific popu-\nlation. For example, melanoma and\nleukemia were among the top 10 inci-\ndence sites only in whites, cancers of\nthe pancreas and oral cavity and phar-\nynx were among the top 10 sites only\nin blacks, liver cancer was among the\ntop 10 sites only in Asian and Pacific\nIslanders and American Indians/\nAlaska Natives, cancer of the kidney\nand renal pelvis was among the top 10\nsites only in American Indians/Alaska\nNatives, and bladder cancer was\namong the top 10 sites only in whites\nand Hispanics.\nthrough 1996, cancer death rates for all\nsites combined decreased (-0.6% per\ndecreased statistically significantly on\nMale cancer death rates peaked in\nfrom the peak years were on average\nCancer death rates were decreasing for\nall 10 leading cancer mortality sites,\nexcept for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\nFig. 3.

The only exceptions were females aged 25\u00ad34 years at\ndeath, whose cancer death rate was declining--but the decline\ndid not achieve statistical significance--and females aged 65\nyears and older, whose cancer death rates were increasing.\nMore than half of all cancer deaths involved cancers of the\nlung, female breast, prostate, or colon and rectum (19). The top\nfour causes of cancer death in the United States from 1990\nthrough 1996 for the racial and ethnic groups included in this\nreport, except Asian and Pacific Islanders, involved the same\nsites as for incidence (Fig. 3). Among Asian and Pacific Island-\ners, cancer of the liver and IBD, instead of female breast cancer,\nranked among the four leading causes of cancer death. Exami-\nnation of cancer death rates for each of these sites by race\nand ethnicity revealed that blacks had higher cancer death rates\nthan whites, Asian and Pacific Islanders, American Indians/\nAlaska Natives, or Hispanics. Among the leading cancer mor-\ntality sites, deaths due to leukemia and to cancers of the stomach\nand ovary were common to all five racial and ethnic groups (data\nnot shown). Otherwise, the leading cancer mortality sites varied\nby racial and ethnic groups. For example, brain and other ner-\nvous system cancers were among the leading cancer mortality\nsites only in whites (data not shown), esophageal cancer and\nFig. 6.

The lung is the num-\nber 1 cancer mortality site overall and is one of the top four\nincidence sites for each racial and ethnic group (Fig. 3).

The earliest\ndeclines in male lung cancer incidence rates occurred among\nLung cancer incidence rates peaked in the period from 1979\nmales 80 years old and older. Age-specific death rates for male\nlung cancer followed temporal patterns similar to those for in-\ncidence, but peak years generally occurred later than for inci-\ndence (Fig. 7).\nDeclines by histologic type in males were also remarkable\n(Fig. 8). Large declines occurred among men who had squamous\ncell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma, the histologic types\nmost strongly associated with cigarette smoking (20,21). The\nrates for these histologic types have been decreasing since the\nearly to mid-1980s for both black and white males (Fig. 8).\nSimilarly, large-cell lung carcinoma has been decreasing among\nwhite males since the mid-1980s and among black males more\nrecently (Fig. 8). Finally, rates of adenocarcinoma of the lung,\nwhich may be associated with using so-called \"low tar\" ciga-\n8).

The decreases in inci-\ndence rates were greatest among males and occurred in most of\nthe top 10 incidence sites; exceptions were cancer of the female\nbreast, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, and cancer of the\ncorpus and uterus NOS. Rates for most of the leading cancer\nmortality sites were declining; exceptions were cancer of the\nfemale lung and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Decreases in cancer\ndeath rates were statistically significant among males for all age\ngroups under the age of 85 years. Among females, cancer death\nrates were significantly decreasing for women younger than age\n65 years but were significantly increasing for women aged 75\nyears and older. The possible reasons for these decreases have\nbeen described previously (4), although some concerns about the\ncompleteness of case ascertainment persist, particularly for\nmelanoma and prostate cancer, which are frequently diagnosed\nin out-of-hospital settings, and for cancers diagnosed through\npathology reviews that are conducted out of state instead of\nwithin the hospital.\nOur study reports cancer incidence and mortality statistics\nseparately for white, black, Asian and Pacific Islander, Ameri-\ncan Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic populations. However,\nwe did not address the occurrence of cancer in rural populations,\nin populations of low socioeconomic status or low education, or\nin populations with limited access to health care. Our inclusion\nof cancer incidence statistics for American Indian/Alaska Native\npopulations is based primarily on residents of New Mexico and\nAlaska. Cancer rates vary considerably among American Indian\n(26) and Alaska Native (27) populations. Alaska Natives, for\nexample, have the highest cancer death rates of all populations\nserved by the Indian Health Service. Lung cancer incidence rates\nin Alaska Natives have increased substantially since the 1960s\nand show no evidence of slowing, particularly when smoking\nbehaviors are taken into consideration (28). Between 42% and\n46% of Alaska Native men were smoking compared with 26%\u00ad\n27% of non-Alaska Native men; the comparable smoking per-\ncentages for Alaska Native and non-Alaska Native women were\nContinued higher incidence and death rates among some ra-\ncial and ethnic groups may be an indication that some popula-\ntions have not benefited equally from cancer prevention and\ncontrol efforts. Such disparities may be due to multiple factors,\nsuch as late stage of disease at diagnosis, barriers to health care\naccess, a history of other diseases, biologic and genetic differ-\nFig. 10.

A commitment to reducing morbidity and mortality from\ncancer in the United States will require concomitant dedication\nto bridging racial and ethnic disparities related to cancer inci-\ndence and mortality. In the future, expanded study of special\npopulations should be possible through analyses of data aggre-\ngated for the North American Association of Central Cancer\nRegistries (30). As the number of state cancer registries that\ncontribute data to the North American Association of Central\nCancer Registries increases and the quality of registry data im-\nproves, more representative data (e.g., Native American and\nother racial and ethnic populations and populations in the South-\neastern United States, Appalachia, and other geographic loca-\ntions) should become available.\nLimitations of Cancer Incidence and Mortality Data\nFor the primary analyses, we estimated APC statistics for the\n1990s. Because these statistics were computed over the time\ncreased or decreased at a constant rate over time did not apply to\nboth sexes, all sites, or all populations analyzed. There are two\nissues here: the peak year and whether or not the data are linear\nState\nDeath rates* APC Death rates* APC Death rates* APC\nAPC  annual percent change. Based on sex-specific data.\nAPC is significantly different from zero (two-sided P<.05).\nTable 2. Prevalence of current cigarette use in adults and youth, by state, 1997\nState\nCurrent cigarette use in adults, %, 1997, BRFSS* Current cigarette use in youth, %, 1997, YRBSS\nMales Females Total Males Females Total\n(Table continues)\nthroughout the time interval. First, we were unable to choose a\nsingle year as the downturn year for the different groups in-\ncluded in the analyses because the peak year differed across\ngroups. For example, female incidence and mortality rates for all\nsites combined peaked in 1991. By comparison, mortality rates\nthe concerns about the linear increase or decrease over time, we\nalso provided trend analyses based on the peak years for the\nmajor cancers. Although this approach may have satisfied the\nrequired statistical assumptions for these sites, direct compari-\nsons of trends involving different peak years are inappropriate.\nSecond, because the estimated APC statistics based on the time\ngroups, the statistical significance of the t test for the beta co-\nefficient may be overstated or understated. There is also some\nrandom variation in rates across years. However, trends based on\ncancer sites, sexes, racial and ethnic populations, and other\ngroups as necessary.\nAssessments of the absolute and comparative levels of cancer\nincidence and death rates by race and ethnicity need to be tem-\npered by the recognition of potential year-to-year random varia-\ntion in the rates and biases in the basic data. First, the listing of\nthe top 10 sites (Fig. 3) may vary from year to year because of\nsmall random differences in rates across sites for a specific racial\nor ethnic population, particularly for Native Americans. For ex-\nample, the rate and SE of the incidence rate for all sites com-\nbined for American Indians/Alaska Natives are 194.9 per\n0.4) for whites. Second, biases result from misreporting race and\nethnicity and, to a lesser extent, age on the basic records used to\ncollect information on cancer incidence, mortality, and the popu-\nlation at risk (31\u00ad34). Rates may be biased because of misre-\nporting on death certificates (31) and hospital medical records,\nwhich comprise the numerators of the cancer death and inci-\ndence rates, respectively, and on censuses and surveys, which\ncomprise the denominators of the rates. Evaluation studies\n(32,34) suggest that the reporting of race for the white and black\npopulation is generally reliable. However, biases are serious for\nthe smaller populations, particularly for American Indians\n(32,34). While these biases affect comparisons among groups at\na specified point in time, the trend data for both morbidity and\nmortality are considered to be relatively reliable.\nLung Cancer and  \nAs much as 90% of all lung cancer is caused by tobacco\nsmoking, including active cigarette smoking, pipe and cigar\nsmoking, and exposure to second-hand smoke (35,36). Other\nfactors, such as exposure to radon and asbestos, also increase\nrisk (37). The epidemic of lung cancer in this century largely\nreflects birth cohort patterns of active cigarette smoking (38,39).\nAt the turn of the century, lung cancer was a rare disease (40,41).\nTo understand the evolution of the epidemic of lung cancer in\nthis country, one must understand the time during which manu-\nfactured cigarettes were introduced, the successive increases in\ncigarette smoking by generations of first men and then women,\nand the 20- to 50-year delay between the uptake of regular\nsmoking and the occurrence of lung cancer (39).\nThe large increase in the consumption of manufactured ciga-\nrettes during the first half of the 20th century is best reflected in\npopulation consumption data. Per capita consumption increased\nwere an uncommon form of tobacco use early in the century. Of\nthe nearly 7.5 pounds of tobacco consumed per adult in 1900,\nonly 0.16 pound (about 2%) was consumed in the form of mass-\nproduced cigarettes. Factors that contributed to increased con-\nsumption of manufactured cigarettes included the introduction\nof cigarettes blended from flue-cured tobaccos (which facilitated\ninhalation into the lungs and more efficient absorption of nico-\ntine) (45), such as Camel in 1913, advertising, and a more effi-\ncient marketing and distribution network, including the free dis-\ntribution of cigarettes in World War I and World War II (44,45).\nThe uptake in cigarette smoking occurred first among men\nand later among women and then for several decades followed a\ngenerational pattern in which successive birth cohorts began\nsmoking at progressively younger ages with a larger proportion\nthrough World War II, between 70% and 80% were cigarette\nsmokers some time during their lifetime, and many smoked\nheavily. In contrast, few women born before 1900 became heavy\ncigarette smokers, and only about 10%\u00ad20% reported ever\nsmoking. The prevalence of smoking in women lagged behind\nmen and reached the peak of 55% in the cohort of women born\nmen and women differed substantially by the age at which they\nTable 2 (continued).

For example, among women born prior to\nAlmost all birth cohorts of males and younger birth cohorts of\nfemales began smoking before age 20 years, although the ma-\njority of females who started smoking as teenagers began smok-\ning after World War II.\nBecause experimentation with cigarette smoking and nicotine\naddiction usually occurs in adolescence or during early adult-\nhood, patterns of smoking behaviors tend to persist as a birth\ncohort ages. This accounts for the clear birth cohort progression\nin smoking prevalence and the progression in age-specific lung\ncancer incidence and death rates 20\u00ad50 years later. The patterns\nof declining lung cancer in males and the leveling off and pos-\nsible future decline in females as reported in this analysis reflect\nhistorical patterns of cigarette smoking, as did the age- and\nsex-specific increases in lung cancer observed earlier in this\nSeveral current trends in tobacco smoking, if unchecked, will\nworsen the future occurrence of lung cancer. First, the number of\nadults currently smoking cigarettes in the United States (47 mil-\nlion) remains high (14), and adult prevalence has changed little\nsmoking among adolescents during the 1990s can only be con-\nsuggest that prevalence may be declining slightly (48). Finally,\ncigar consumption (mainly large cigars) increased by about 50%\nCigar use has regained acceptance among better-educated, up-\nper-income men and women, especially among those 18\u00ad34\nyears old who previously had eschewed cigarettes (24,50); in\n1997, about one in five high school students smoked cigars (18).\nCigar smoking can cause lung cancer, as well as oral, esopha-\nLimitations of Data on  \nPrevalence estimates of tobacco smoking in adults may have\nsome limitations. Because interviews are conducted by tele-\nphone in BRFSS, the estimates of adult tobacco smoking can be\ngeneralized only to the population of persons with telephones.\nHowever, a recent analysis of NHIS data (53) compared re-\nsponses regarding health risk behaviors from households with\ntelephones with responses from all households in the survey. In\n1992, the difference in the prevalence of current cigarette smok-\ners for respondents from all households compared with respon-\ndents from telephone households was small (25.4% versus\n24.4%, respectively). Another study compared estimates of adult\nsmoking prevalence from BRFSS with personal interviews from\nthe Bureau of the Census Current Population Survey (54) that\nhas collected data on smoking prevalence for all 50 states and\n(55,56). In general, findings from the two surveys were similar,\nalthough differences were more pronounced in findings for\nmales and blacks and also for Southern states where telephone\ncoverage was lower (54). In 1990, according to the U.S. Bureau\nof the Census (57), telephones were present in the homes of 96%\nof whites, 87% of blacks, 98% of Asians and Pacific Islanders,\n77% of American Indians, Eskimos, or Aleuts, and 88% of His-\npanics. Differences in telephone coverage are relevant, since\ncigarette smoking prevalence may be higher in persons from\nhomes without telephones than in persons from homes with\nPrevalence estimates for tobacco smoking in youth from\nYRBSS also have limitations. Because state surveys are con-\nducted among public high school students, the estimates can be\ngeneralized only to youth attending public school in the respec-\ntive jurisdictions (17). Compared with those enrolled in school,\nyouth who are not in school have higher rates of tobacco use\nwere not enrolled in a high school program and had not com-\npleted high school (60).\nTobacco Advertising\nThe tobacco industry has a long history of targeting market-\ning campaigns to selected groups in the U.S population and\nabroad. The earliest cigarette-marketing practices were directed\nat men; however, by 1928, advertising campaigns targeted\nwomen, often with themes linking cigarette smoking to weight\nadvertising and promoting its products to virtually all segments\nof society (61). Special target populations include women\ncollar workers (62). Adolescents are especially susceptible to\namong adolescents are more likely than adult brands to be ad-\nvertised in magazines with high youth readership (70).\nCigarette companies have also appealed to health-conscious\nsmokers with so-called \"low tar\" brand cigarettes (71). Tar,\nnicotine, and carbon monoxide levels in U.S. cigarettes have\nbeen determined by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\nsince the mid-1960s and are derived from a fixed, machine-\nbased testing protocol. The FTC testing method, however, does\nnot take into account how smokers adjust their smoking patterns\nto obtain nicotine from cigarettes. To get their required level of\nnicotine, smokers of low tar and low nicotine cigarettes tend to\ntake more and longer puffs per cigarette, inhale more deeply, and\nblock ventilation holes on the filters, which thereby negates the\nreason for their switching to low tar brands (71). The increased\npromotion of cigarettes yielding 15 mg tar or less (as measured\nby the FTC method) was followed by an increased U.S. market\nshare of these products (61,62) from 3.6% of all cigarettes sold\nstudies suggest that smokers' perceptions of tar yields may be\ninfluenced by misleading advertising terms such as \"light\" and\n\"ultra-light\" (72) and that mistaken beliefs about low tar brands\nmay reduce intentions to quit (71,73). Following the shift to\nlower tar cigarettes, there was a parallel increase in adenocarci-\nnoma of the lung, which has now become the most common lung\ncancer type in the United States (22,23). The U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services, in collaboration with the FTC, is\ncurrently conducting a review of the FTC's testing methods.\nStrategies for the Future\nTrends of decreasing incidence and death rates for the leading\ncancer sites are encouraging. However, to meet national goals\nfor reducing the morbidity and mortality due to cancer (74,75),\nincreased efforts are needed to identify additional cancer pre-\nvention and control strategies, to implement more completely\nthe interventions that have worked well in the past, and to reach\nall segments of society.\nBecause lung cancer accounts for approximately 14% of new\ncancer cases and 28% of cancer deaths each year (19), the largest\nimpact can be made through programs and policies that deter\nsmoking initiation, promote cessation, and protect nonsmokers\nfrom environmental tobacco smoke (36,76\u00ad80). Efforts to pre-\nvent initiation include 1) reducing minors' access to and the\nappeal of tobacco products, 2) widely disseminating effective\nschool-based tobacco use prevention curricula, which would op-\ntimally be combined with community- and media-based strate-\ngies, and 3) increasing the support and involvement of parents\n(49,59,81). Raising the cost of tobacco products can also reduce\ninitiation and promote quitting (36,59,82). In addition, using\nexcise taxes to finance community interventions and mass-\nmedia strategies can be especially effective in reducing con-\nsumption, as demonstrated in California and Massachusetts\nstrategies, including reimbursement for safe and effective thera-\npies on the part of health care insurers and managed care orga-\nnizations, can also facilitate quitting (79,80,86). Smoke-free\nlaws and policies protect people from the toxic and carcinogenic\nchemicals in environmental tobacco smoke and also establish\nsmoke-free air as the norm (87\u00ad89). Health professionals need to\ncontinue to monitor the patterns, determinants, and conse-\nquences of tobacco use. Increased awareness of the activities of\ntobacco product manufacturers (e.g., product innovations and\nmarketing practices) and related environmental influences (e.g.,\neconomics, policy and legislation, and social norms) are needed\nto facilitate appropriate public health actions. Finally, new ad-\nvances in genetics may lead to a better understanding of tobacco\naddiction and ultimately to more effective cessation strategies.\nThe rapid increase in cigarette smoking that occurred during\nthe first half of this century was responsible for the epidemic of\nlung and other tobacco-related cancer deaths in the last half of\nthe century, first among men and a generation later among\nwomen. Male lung cancer deaths and death rates are now de-\nclining, and recent data for women show a slowing in the rate of\nincrease, suggesting an eventual decline in their lung cancer rate\nas well. While these data are extremely encouraging, several\nnotes of caution are in order. Lung cancer is almost exclusively\na smoker's disease, and both incidence and mortality are directly\nrelated to the degree of cigarette use that occurs in a population.\nHowever, the leveling off of tobacco smoking in the 1990s\namong adults, the alarming trends among teens, and the in-\ncreased popularity of cigar use may contribute to higher preva-\nlence of long-term smoking among adults in the future. Specifi-\ncally, unless steps are taken now to lower adolescent initiation\nrates dramatically, the current positive trends in lung cancer\ncould reverse, and future cohorts could again experience a rise in\nlung cancer.\nREFERENCES\n(1) Rosenberg HM, Ventura SJ, Heuser RL, Freedman MF.
