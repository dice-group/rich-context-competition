Few\nstudies, however, have examined this association in blacks.\nMethods--Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n4534), a nationally representative\nsample of US adults, were used to examine the relationship between H(e) and a physician diagnosis of stroke (n185)\nin both black and white adults. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses were used to examine this relationship.\nResults--Serum vitamin B12\nand folate concentrations were significantly lower among participants in the highest H(e)\nquartile (12.1 mol/L) than among participants in the lowest quartile (7.4 mol/L). Those in the highest quartile\nwere older, had higher mean cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and were more likely to smoke and to have completed\n12 years of education. After adjustment for age, the odds ratio (OR) for stroke was 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI],\n1.4 to 5.7; highest versus lowest quartile). Adjustment for gender, race/ethnicity, education, systolic blood pressure,\ncholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and smoking reduced the magnitude of the association (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.6). The\nassociation between H(e) and stroke did not differ by race [P0.265 for race-H(e) interaction term]. The multivariate\nblacks.\nConclusions--In this nationally representative sample of US adults, H(e) concentration was independently associated with\nan increased likelihood of nonfatal stroke. This association was present in both black and white adults.

In a meta-analysis\nexamining the association between H(e) and coronary heart\ndisease, Boushey and colleagues12 reported that a 5-mol/L\nincrease in H(e) was associated with an OR of 1.6 in men and\n1.8 in women. Because of the paucity of studies, however,\nBoushey and colleagues were unable to comment on any\npossible racial differences in the association between H(e)\nand risk for cardiovascular disease.\nH(e) concentrations can be affected by several nutritional\nand genetic factors. Folate consumption is a major determi-\nnant of H(e) concentration, and blacks tend to have substan-\ntially lower folate consumption rates than their white coun-\nterparts.13 We previously reported that the association\nbetween low serum folate concentration and risk of stroke\nwas stronger among blacks than among their white counter-\nparts.14 We hypothesized that this finding reflected a stronger\nassociation between H(e) and stroke among blacks.\nTo date, most of the studies examining the association\nbetween H(e) and stroke have been conducted in selected\npopulations that may not reflect the age, gender, and racial or\nethnic distribution of the general US population.1\u00ad12 In addi-\ntion, few studies have included blacks or Mexican Ameri-\ncans.

Serum H(e) concentrations were\nBlood that was drawn during the medical examination was processed\nwith use of a standard protocol,16 and sera were stored at 70\u00b0C for\n8 months to 3 years before analysis. The high-performance liquid\nchromatography method of Araki and Sako17 was used to obtain H(e)\nmeasurements at the US Department of Agriculture's Human Nutri-\ntion Research Center on Aging. H(e) concentrations ranged from 3.1\nto 132.0 mol/L and were grouped into the following quartiles:\nDuring the household interview, 185 participants (4.1%) answered\nin the affirmative to the question, \"Has a doctor ever told you that\nyou had a stroke?\" Potential confounders in the association between\nH(e) and nonfatal stroke included age, gender, race/ethnicity (white,\nblack, and Mexican American), education, systolic blood pressure,\ncholesterol, and cigarette smoking. Systolic blood pressure was the\nmean of the second and third blood pressure determinations taken\nduring the physical examination. Although serum folate and vitamin\nconcentrations were not considered potential confounders in the\nassociation between H(e) and stroke, we examined whether serum\nfolate and vitamin B12\nconcentrations differed by H(e) quartile and\nstroke status. Because folate, vitamin B12\n, and H(e) concentrations\nwere positively skewed, we log transformed the values and present\nboth arithmetic and geometric means for groups defined by H(e)\nquartile and stroke status.\nWe used t tests and 2 tests to compare groups defined by H(e)\nquartile and stroke status. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were\nused to determine whether the likelihood for stroke differed by H(e)\nquartile. The logistic regression model was adjusted for the following\ncardiovascular disease risk factors: age, gender, race/ethnicity, educa-\ntion, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol concentration, and smoking\nstatus. An ordinal variable, with values ranging from 1 to 4 to denote the\n4 H(e) quartiles, was included in the multivariate logistic regression\nmodel to test for linear trend. The analysis was also stratified by race to\ndetermine whether the association between H(e) and stroke differed by\nrace. The number of Mexican Americans who experienced a stroke\n(n38) was too small to allow analysis of the association between H(e)\nand stroke in this population. The NHANES III data were weighted to\nmake the results representative of the entire US population. To take into\naccount the complex sampling design in the NHANES III survey,\nSUDAAN18 was used to obtain standard errors for the prevalence\nestimates and ORs.\nResults\nPersons in the highest H(e) quartile were older and had higher\nmean systolic blood pressure and cholesterol values than\nthose in the lowest quartile (Table 1). The percentage of\npersons in the highest quartile who were men (56.0%) was\nalmost twice the percentage in the lowest quartile (29.2%).\nThe percentage of blacks in each quartile did not differ; in\ncontrast, the percentage of Mexican Americans in the highest\nquartile (3.3%) was approximately half that in the lowest\nquartile (5.9%). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, low\neducational attainment (12 years of education), and current\nsmoking increased with H(e) concentration. Finally, as ex-\npected, an inverse relationship was observed between serum\nfolate concentration and H(e) quartile (P0.001) and be-\nconcentration and H(e) quartile (P0.001).\nTABLE 1.

The results from this cross-\nsectional study indicate that the association between H(e) and\nprevalent stroke was similar among black and white adults.\nAlthough the association between H(e) and stroke did not\nachieve statistical significance among blacks, the results do\nsuggest a modest association between H(e) and stroke in this\npopulation. The lack of statistical significance was largely\ndue to the limited number of prevalent stroke events among\nblacks (n48). There were 20 strokes in each of the 4\nquartiles and 10 strokes in the lowest 2 H(e) quartiles.\nRepeating the race-stratified analysis by tertile increased the\nstability of the ORs, as noted by the narrower CIs.\nIn the present study we found that several cardiovascular\ndisease risk factors were strongly associated with H(e)\nconcentrations, including age, systolic blood pressure, and\ntotal cholesterol concentrations. These findings are consistent\nwith those of the Hordaland Homocyst(e)ine Study,19 another\ncross-sectional study from Norway that examined the corre-\nIn addition, we found that completing 12 years of\neducation was associated with higher H(e) concentrations.\nSuch an association may be mediated through the consump-\ntion of the B vitamins B12\n, and folate. Results from\nNHANES II20 indicate that the percentage of persons with\nlow red blood cell folate values was higher for both men and\nwomen with incomes below the poverty level; however, this\ndifference did not achieve statistical significance.\nBoth the present study and the Hordaland Homocyst(e)ine\nStudy19 found that cigarette smoking was positively associ-\nated with H(e) concentrations. Similarly, data from the Stroke\nPrevention in Young Women Study21 found that as the\nnumber of cigarettes smoked per day increased, so did H(e)\nconcentrations. Additional studies should examine whether\nsmoking cessation can reduce H(e) concentrations.\nThese results from NHANES III suggest that the percent-\nage of blacks do not differ according to H(e) quartile, a\nfinding consistent with data from the Stroke Prevention in\nYoung Women Study,21 which reported similar H(e) distri-\nbutions in black and white women. These results may seem\nsurprising, given that blacks have substantially lower folate\nintakes than their white counterparts.13 However, an impor-\ntant genetic determinant of H(e), a polymorphism associated\nwith the thermolabile variant to the enzyme 5,10-methylene-\ntetrahydrofolate reductase, appears to be substantially less\nprevalent among blacks than among whites.22,23 This poly-\nmorphism has been associated with elevated H(e) concentra-\ntions, particularly when folate concentrations are low.23\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\nreport any information on H(e) concentrations among Mexi-\ncan Americans. Reasons for the low percentage of Mexican\nAmericans among those in the highest H(e) quartile are\nunclear. Data from NHANES III13 indicate that Mexican\nAmericans have folate intakes similar to or lower than those\nof their white counterparts. In contrast, vitamin B12\nintakes\nwere slightly higher among Mexican Americans in NHANES\nIII compared with their white counterparts. This finding was\nparticularly true among Mexican American women over age\n60.13 Whether a lower prevalence of genetic polymorphisms\nassociated with H(e) concentration, such as the thermolabile\nvariant to the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase,\nmay also explain the lower H(e) concentrations among\nMexican Americans needs further exploration. In addition,\nwhether lower H(e) levels can partially explain the lower\nstroke mortality rates among Hispanic adults should also be\nexamined in future studies.24 Unfortunately, the number of\nstroke events among Mexican Americans was insufficient to\nexamine the association between H(e) and stroke in\nElevated H(e) concentration appears to be an independent\nrisk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the increased\nconsumption of folate, vitamin B12\n, and vitamin B6\nmay\nreduce H(e) values. Whether increased consumption of these\nB vitamins can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has\nnot been determined. Currently, several primary and second-\nary cardiovascular disease prevention trials are attempting to\nanswer this question.\nAssociation between total homocyst(e)ine con-\ncentration and the likelihood of nonfatal stroke,\nfrom the results of the Third National Health\nORs are adjusted for age, gender, education,\nsystolic blood pressure, cholesterol concentra-\ntion, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, and\ntotal homocyst(e)ine quartile.\n2476 Total Homocyst(e)ine and Nonfatal Stroke in NHANES III\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nThe present study has several potential limitations. First,\nbecause the data were derived from a cross-sectional study,\none cannot infer the direction of the associations. However,\nprospective studies3,25 have reported an association between\nH(e) and stroke, and the magnitude of the association appears\nto be similar to that presented in this report. Second, H(e)\nconcentrations were not obtained from fasting adults in all\ncases. However, limiting the sample to those adults who were\nfasting did not appreciably change the risk estimates. Finally,\nwe were able to evaluate only nonfatal stroke events. Data\nfrom patients with coronary heart disease suggest that the\nassociation between H(e) and coronary heart disease may be\nstronger for fatal than for nonfatal events.26 If this finding is\nalso true for stroke, it is likely that the magnitude of the\nassociation would have been even stronger if fatal stroke\nevents had been included.\nIn conclusion, data from this nationally representative\nsample of US adults indicate that persons in the highest H(e)\nquartile have approximately twice the likelihood of nonfatal\nstroke as those in the lowest H(e) quartile. This increased\nlikelihood was noted in both blacks and whites. There is a\npaucity of data on the relationship between H(e) and stroke\namong Mexican Americans, and there is a clear need for\nadditional studies. Future studies, including primary and\nsecondary prevention trials, should include an adequate\nnumber of persons from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds to\nfurther examine the complex relationships between race/\nethnicity, folate, vitamin B6\n, H(e) and the risk for\ncardiovascular disease.\nReferences\n1.
