In this study, we assessed the following ques-\ntions: Do children and adults living in households with\nsmokers have a greater likelihood of experiencing food\ninsecurity compared with children living in households\nwithout smokers? If yes, is adult smoking also associ-\nated with severe food insecurity in the children and adults\nin their households?\nMETHODS\nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nis a nationally representative survey that uses a multistage, clus-\ntered, stratified sampling design, is conducted annually by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, and is reported every 2 years. Before\n1999, NHANES assessed food insecurity for the respondent's\nhousehold as a whole, not allowing for the separate assess-\nment of food insecurity in the children and adults residing to-\ngether in particular households. Since 1999, NHANES has in-\ncluded the US Department of Agriculture Food Security Survey\nModule as part of its household questionnaire (see the \"Food\nSecurity Survey Module\" subsection).\nSAMPLE\nChildren were defined by the legal definition of a minor, that\nis, age 17 years or younger, and all such individuals with rel-\nevant data were included. All variables used were obtained from\neither the sample person files (the individual files for the per-\nson aged 17 years) or the family demographic data, which\nwere linked to the specific sample person. All aspects of NHANES\nwere approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics, and informed consent was\nobtained from all participants.\nVARIABLES\nCovariates included were limited to child and household vari-\nables. In the NHANES data set, once the child was selected, only\nhousehold data could be linked to the child. Parental demo-\ngraphic data were not linkable to the sample child in the data\nset and were not included in the analysis. Therefore, indepen-\ndent variables included child age, sex, and race/ethnicity; house-\nhold poverty index ratio (PIR); and reported residence in a home\nwith at least 1 adult smoker. Each of these variables was ana-\nlyzed for comparisons between households in which children\nreside with and without smokers and for their associations with\nchild and adult food security status in these households.\nThe PIR is the total household income divided by the fed-\neral poverty threshold for that particular household of speci-\nfied size.23 A PIR of 1 indicates a household income at the pov-\nerty level; a PIR of 2 indicates a household income at twice the\npoverty level; and so on. Children living in households with a\nPIR less than 1.85 were categorized as living in low-income\nhouseholds because this is the general income level below which\na household is eligible for 2 of the 3 largest US Department of\nAgriculture food and nutrition services from the federal food\nassistance programs: the Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro-\ngram for Women, Infants, and Children and the National School\nLunch Program.24 The third program is the Food Stamp Pro-\ngram, which has a lower income threshold (PIR of 1.3), and\nso was included in the households with a PIR less than 1.85.25\nResearchers have determined that families living in house-\nholds with a PIR of 2 or less are considered low-income fami-\nlies.26 Therefore, a PIR of 1.85 encompasses low-income fami-\nlies who are eligible for federal food assistance programs.\nHouseholds were characterized as smoking households if\nthe survey respondent answered affirmatively to the question,\n\"Does anyone who lives here smoke cigarettes anywhere in-\nside this home?\" and as nonsmoking households if this ques-\ntion was answered negatively.\nFood security, insecurity, and severe insecurity were assessed\nusing the US Department of Agriculture Food Security Survey\nModule. This module was developed to assess the presence and\nseverity of food deprivation resulting from inadequate house-\nhold resources during the preceding 12 months14 and has been\nused by the federal government and researchers in numerous\nprevious studies and reports.* Food security status was as-\nsessed separately for children and adults in the home on the\nbasis of scores on the adult and child modules of the Food Se-\ncurity Survey Module, as recommended.\nScoring of the Food Security Survey Module uses an 18-\npoint scale (Table 1) based on 18 questions, 10 of which per-\ntain to adults in the home and the remaining 8 to those aged\n17 years or younger who live in the home with the adults. The\nsurvey is scored on a continuous scale but typically is re-\nported in terms of specific categories on the basis of ranges of\nscores.14 For an adult to be considered food insecure, an affir-\nmative answer to at least 3 questions is needed. On the child\nfood security scale, an affirmative answer to any 2 questions\nindicates food insecurity.14\nTable 1.

The appropriate statistical weights were ap-\nplied to produce national estimates.\nBivariate analyses were conducted to assess the associations\nof adult and child food insecurity with household and indi-\nvidual factors. All comparisons were made using the 2 test to de-\ntermine statistical significance set at P.05. The association of\nadult smoking in the household with adult and child food inse-\ncurity was determined for the entire sample and stratified by child\nage, sex, and race/ethnicity; household smoking; and PIR.\nMultiple logistic regression analyses were performed to in-\nvestigate possible independent associations of adult house-\nhold smokers and increased prevalence and severity of food in-\nsecurity in children and adults in these homes. Separate\nregression analyses were performed for adults and children, both\nto explore food insecurity overall and to explore whether se-\nvere food insecurity, which includes severe disruptions and de-\ncrease in food intake, is independently associated with the pres-\nence of adult household smokers. The regression models\nincluded all 8817 households who answered the Food Secu-\nrity Survey Module. The first model included all households\nwith outcomes dichotomized into food-secure and food-\ninsecure groups. The second model also included all house-\nholds with outcomes dichotomized into severe food insecu-\nrity and all other food security groups. All multivariable models\nincluded as covariates child age, sex, and race/ethnicity, and\nhousehold PIR.\nRESULTS\nA total of 8817 households with children and adoles-\ncents were included in the analyses. Table 2 gives the\ncharacteristics of these children and their households. Al-\nmost one-fourth of the households had an annual in-\ncome below the poverty level, and almost half were clas-\nsified as low-income families (185% of the poverty level).\nApproximately 23% of households with children in-\ncluded at least 1 adult smoker, and 32% of children in\nlow-income households lived with a smoker compared\nwith 15% of those in more affluent households (P.001).\nOverall, 15% of adults and 11% of children experienced\nsome degree of food insecurity during the previous 12\nmonths, with 6% of adults and 1% of children experi-\nencing severe food insecurity (very low food security)\nTable 3 gives the rates of child food insecurity over-\nall and severe child food insecurity (very low security)\nby child and household characteristics. Rates of child-\nhood food insecurity in those living in households with\nsmokers were approximately double (17% vs 9%;\nP.001), and rates of children experiencing severe food\ninsecurity were more than triple (3% vs 0.9%; P=.04) com-\npared with those in nonsmoking households.\nBlack and Hispanic families had higher rates of child\nfood insecurity in both smoking and nonsmoking house-\nholds compared with white and other families. The high-\nest rates of food insecurity were in children living in low-\nincome households with smokers (25% vs 17% for those\nin low-income homes with and without smokers, respec-\ntively; P=.01). While not statistically significant for house-\nholds with a PIR at or above 1.85, the trend was for chil-\ndren in household with smokers to have higher rates of\nfood insecurity compared with those in similar eco-\nnomic circumstances in households without smokers.\nTable 2.

In low-income house-\nholds, 1 in 3 children live with a smoker, and in such\nhouseholds, 1 of 4 children and 1 of 3 adults experience\nsome degree of food insecurity. One of 20 children and\n1 of 6 adults in low-income homes with smokers have\nseverely compromised diets.\nwas spent to purchase cigarettes, with the average price\nof a pack of cigarettes being more than $4.38 Families with\nlow income, in general, are more likely to experience food\npercentage of available money on tobacco compared with\nmore affluent families.13,30 In developing countries such\nas Bangladesh, China, and Bulgaria, tobacco expendi-\ntures crowd out expenditures for food, health care, and\nus to examine whether this is the mechanism behind the\nfindings presented herein, it seems plausible.\nAlthough the effect of poverty on food insecurity can-\nnot be overstated, inasmuch as it was the greatest inde-\npendent predictor, it does not explain all food insecu-\nrity. Smoking was a significant independent predictor of\nfood insecurity even after controlling for household in-\ncome level. Possible mechanisms beyond the economic\neffect of tobacco may include behavioral or psychoso-\ncial differences in smoking households compared with\nnonsmoking households in terms of dietary behavior and\nfood acquisition. Smokers have different dietary atti-\ntudes and behaviors than those of nonsmokers, and this\nmay extend to feeding practices of their children as\nwell.40,41 This relationship cannot be tested with the cur-\nrent data set, and further research is needed to assess these\ncharacteristics.\nRace/ethnicity also has a strong role in food insecu-\nrity; black and Hispanic families experience higher rates\nof food insecurity compared with white families.42-45 This\nwas reinforced in this analysis with only nonsmoking\nwhite and other households approaching the Healthy\nracial/ethnic families had rates of food insecurity exceed-\ning this goal, regardless of smoking status. The ethnic\ngroup referred to as other seems to be protective against\nfood insecurity in the adjusted analysis. This group con-\nsists of people who declare themselves to be multieth-\nnic or any other single ethnic group that is not white,\nblack, or Hispanic. Owing to the heterogeneity of this\nother group, it is difficult to speculate on the reason it\nwould be protected from food insecurity.\nTable 5.

These data are cross-\nsectional,limitingourabilitytodrawcausalinferences.The\npotential of unmeasured confounders introducing unrec-\nognizedbiasesisapossibilityinanobservationalstudysuch\nas this. Findings related to severe food insecurity were not\nrobust across all subgroups in the analysis. For example,\nacross racial/ethnic groups, smoking was significantly as-\nsociated with severe food insecurity only for white fami-\nlies; this may be because of the low number of subjects in-\ncluded in these subgroups. Additional covariates likely\nrelatedtofoodinsecurityincludeparentaldemographicdata,\nfor example, immigration status, and nonincome finan-\ncial support, such as participation in the Special Supple-\nmental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Chil-\ndren, which would have strengthened our findings.\nHowever, these additional covariates were either unre-\nportedinthedataorwerenotlinkabletothesampledcases.\nOther limitations are that measures used were based\non adult report, and it is possible that the wording of the\nquestion about the presence of adult smokers in the house-\nhold may have led some respondents to answer no if there\nwere adult smokers living in the home who smoked only\noutside the home. If this were the case, however, it would\nfalsely diminish rather than falsely inflate the indepen-\ndent risk of food insecurity associated with adult house-\nhold smokers. An additional limitation is that we could\nnot ascertain whether more household smokers was as-\nsociated with higher rates and severity of food insecurity.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to show a rela-\ntionship between adult smoking and child and adult food\ninsecurity in the United States. These data also demon-\nstrate how pervasive this combination of child health risks\nis in low-income families. The burden of food insecurity\nis a previously unrecognized danger of adult tobacco use\nto be added to the ever growing list of negative effects of\nadult tobacco use on children in the United States.\nCorrespondence: Cynthia Cutler-Triggs, MD, Depart-\nment of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medi-\n(cutlec01@med.nyu.edu).\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Cutler-Triggs had full access\nto all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analy-\nsis.
