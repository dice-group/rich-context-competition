The\nviews expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily coincide with the views of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank or the Eurosystem.\n1. Introduction\nSanctions are a popular instrument in international diplomacy. The European Union,\nfor instance, currently imposes restrictive measures on 38 countries and terrorist groups2,\narguing that sanctions help to promote their foreign policy objectives of \"peace, democracy\nand the respect for the rule of law, human rights and international law\". 3 Hufbauer, Schott,\nElliott, and Oegg (2007) compile an extensive and repeatedly updated database of sanctions\nepisodes, which, in its most recent version, covers 204 case studies over the period from 1914\nStill, despite their frequent use, sanctions are under dispute, for at least two reasons.\nFirst, sanctions are typically found to be ineffective in changing the policies of the target\ncountry. While both the definition of success as well as the contribution to success made by\nsanctions depends to a significant degree on subjective evaluation, sanctions often seem to fail\nto achieve their objectives.4 Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg (2007), for instance, using an\nindex ranging from 1 to 16 to assess individual sanctions episodes, classify about one in three\ncases as successful.5 Biersteker, Eckert, Tourinho, and Hud\u00e1kov\u00e1 (2013, p. 21) are even more\npessimistic; they argue that UN targeted sanctions achieve their purposes only 22 percent of\nthe time. More importantly, attempts to identify factors that determine whether or not\nsanctions are effective often yield inconclusive results; see Kaempfer and Lowenberg (2007)\nfor a review.\nSecond, sanctions also imply costs for the sender country. The reduction of bilateral\nrelations not only restricts sanctioned entities and their ability to interact, but also limits the\nbusiness opportunities of the sanctioning country. Consequently, business groups in the\nsanctions-imposing country typically oppose such measures. When the U.S. government, for\ninstance, considered a tightening of sanctions against Russia in June 2014, the U.S. Chamber\nof Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers issued a newspaper\nadvertisement stating that \"[w]e are concerned about actions that would harm American\n2 See the list of restrictive measures in force, available at\nhttps://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/restrictive_measures-2016-10-11-clean.pdf.\n3 Masters (2015) even notes that \"because the EU lacks a joint military force, many European\nleaders consider sanctions the bloc's most powerful foreign policy tool\".\n4 Levy (1999) convincingly illustrates this point by discussing different views about the role\nof trade sanctions in ending the apartheid regime in South Africa.\n5 For the 204 sanctions episodes listed at\nhttp://www.piie.com/research/topics/sanctions/sanctions-timeline.cfm, the average success\nmanufacturers and cost American jobs. [...] The only effect of such sanctions is to bar U.S.\ncompanies from foreign markets and cede business opportunities to firms from other\ncountries.\" 6 German corporate executives are reported to have warned, in similar fashion,\nagainst escalating the measures (\"German Businesses Urge Halt on Sanctions Against\nIn practice, sanctions affect the sender's economy in many ways, making\nquantification of their overall domestic burden difficult. Apart from the immediate reduction\nin foreign market access, possible costs include the general increase in uncertainty associated\nwith conflict escalation, the risk of countermeasures by the sanctioned country and a long-\nterm loss of the foreign market due to greater competition from non-sanctioning countries. At\nthe other extreme, sender countries may also benefit from the imposition of restrictive\nmeasures. Cutting aid or official credits, for instance, implies an immediate reduction in\nbudgetary expenditures, as noted by Hufbauer, Schott, Elliott, and Oegg (2007, p. 108).\nIn view of these difficulties in identifying the domestic costs of sanctions, empirical\nstudies typically follow, to the extent they address this issue at all, a two-step approach to\nexamine the impact of sanctions on the sender's economy. In a first step, the effect of\nsanctions on the targeted economic activity is analyzed. Specifically, since sanctions aim to\nrestrict cross-border interactions, the decline in business with the sanctioned country is\nquantified, often with a strong focus on bilateral trade. In a second step, based on this\nestimate, the economic loss to the sanctioning country is calculated. Hufbauer, Elliott, Cyrus,\nand Winston (1997), for example, examine the costs of unilateral economic sanctions by the\nUnited States and estimate that the sanctions may have reduced the country's exports to 26\ntarget countries by about 15-19 billion US dollars in 1995. Assuming, then, that 1 billion US\ndollars of exports supported about 13,800 jobs and that there was no offsetting increase in\nexports to other markets, they argue that this drop translated into a reduction of about\nthey estimate that workers probably lost about 0.8-1.0 billion US dollars in export sector wage\npremiums.\nIn this paper, we assess the costs of financial sanctions on the imposing country in\nmore detail. In particular, we examine the effects of financial sanctions on German non-\nfinancial entities over the period from 1999 through 2014. During this time, Germany newly\n6 A copy of the ad is available on the association's website at\nhttp://www.nam.org/Issues/Trade/NAM-Chamber-Ad.pdf.\nimposed restrictive financial measures on 23 countries, most of which are still in place. More\nnotably, using highly disaggregated, monthly data from the German balance of payments\nstatistics, we are able to identify business units that declared financial transactions with\nsanctioned countries and, therefore, can be assumed to have been directly affected by the\nmeasures. As we are interested in identifying the costs of sanctions beyond the reduction in\nbilateral financial flows, we focus our analysis on German non-financial declarants. To the\nextent that financial restrictions have any measurable effect on the economic performance of\nindividual declarants, these effects should be particularly observable for non-financial\nbusiness entities. For German banks and insurance companies, in contrast, with their large-\nscale financial operations in major national and international markets, the reduction in\nbusiness opportunities due to sanctions policies is expected to have generally limited\nconsequences on their overall activities.7\nWe examine the impact of financial sanctions on domestic businesses along various\nlines. We begin with an analysis of the direct costs of sanctions in terms of cross-border\nbusiness that is lost. More specifically, we apply a differences-in-differences approach to\nstudy changes in German bilateral capital flows with the sanctioned country after the\nimposition of sanctions. Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch (2017) find a strong and immediate\ndecline in cross-border activities with the target country at both the extensive and intensive\nmargins; they estimate, for instance, that after the imposition of financial sanctions German\ncapital flows with the sanctioned country decrease by about 50 percent. When we decompose\nthe effect by the type of declarant, however, we find that the decline in financial flows is\ndominated by a reduction in foreign activities by German financial institutions. For non-\nfinancials, in contrast, the reduction in cross-border business with sanctioned countries is\nmainly driven by a decline in the scope of activities (i.e., the extensive margin) while the\nresults for total financial flows (i.e., the intensive margin) turn out to be less robust.\nNext, we characterize non-financial firms affected by sanctions in more detail. With\nonly few exceptions (e.g., Russia), restrictive financial measures have been primarily imposed\non countries of small, even tiny, importance for Germany as counterparts in financial\n7 Buch and Lipponer (2004) provide a detailed empirical assessment of the international\nactivities of German banks. According to their findings, German banks operating abroad\ntypically expand their business either to realize economies of scale, with particularly strong\nengagements in OECD countries and major international financial centers, or to reap\ndiversification benefits, reporting payments to (or from) a large portfolio of countries. In\neither case, business with sanctioned countries is of minor importance for a bank's overall\nperformance.\ntransactions. Consequently, it is perhaps not surprising that German firms that declared\nfinancial transactions with sanctioned countries turn out to be disproportionately large and\ngenerally very active in (many) international markets \u00ad a finding that is in line with the\nliterature on firm-level exports.8 As a result, firms affected by sanctions are expected to have\nvarious outside options in response to newly-imposed restrictions.\nOur micro data also enable us to explore the response of sanctions-affected declarants\ndirectly. In particular, we aim to identify possible sanctions evasion behavior by non-financial\nreporting units. We find that German firms which declared activities with sanctioned\ncountries in the 12 months before restrictive measures were imposed sizably expand their\nactivities with other countries, some of which display close trade ties to the sanctioned\ncountry, potentially indicating sanctions evasion behavior.\nFinally, we examine the impact of sanctions on firm-level variables such as total sales\nand the number of employees. If financial sanctions have any severe consequences for the\nsanctioning country's economy, as argued, for instance, by national business associations, the\ncosts of sanctions should be observable in these measures. However, the business\nperformance of firms affected by sanctions is not measurably different from that of firms\ndoing business only with non-sanctioned countries. Overall, we find consistent evidence that\nthe costs of financial sanctions on the German economy are, if anything, moderate.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some relevant\naspects of sanctions and sanction policies, followed by a description of our data. In Section 4,\nwe follow standard practices and examine the effect of financial sanctions on cross-border\nactivities. We then make explicit use of the firm-level dimension of our data set and\ncharacterize German non-financial declarants that report business with sanctioned countries in\nSection 5. In Section 6, we explore firm-level responses to the imposition of sanctions, while\nSection 7 focuses on the effects of sanctions on aggregate measures of firm performance.\nFinally, Section 8 provides some concluding comments.\n8 See, for instance, Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2017), Table 5.\n2. Financial Sanctions in the European Union\nIn the European Union (EU), where member states have committed themselves to a\nCommon Foreign and Security Policy, foreign policy instruments are (typically) imposed by\nthe Council of the EU. Among the instruments for external action, financial sanctions became\navailable to EU authorities in 1994. At this time, the Treaty of Maastricht entered into force,\nwhich introduced the free movement of capital as a Treaty freedom. Today, Article 63 of the\nTreaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) prohibits all restrictions on\npayments and the movement of capital between member states and between member states\nand third countries, while Article 215 TFEU allows for the interruption or reduction, in part or\ncompletely, of economic and financial relations with one or more third countries.\nFor our purposes, two features of sanction policies in the European Union are\nparticularly noteworthy. First, while the Council acts by qualified majority, making it\ndifficult, if not impossible, for a single country to veto proposed legislation, regulations are\ndirectly applicable in all EU member states and binding in their entirety. As a result, there is\nonly limited scope for potential concerns of endogeneity, where the decision to impose\nrestrictive measures is affected by their expected domestic costs. Still, as the EU implements\nsanctions either autonomously, at the EU level, or as a result of resolutions of the Security\nCouncil of the United Nations (UN), we check for robustness by examining UN sanctions\nonly.\nSecond, the EU adopts, in practice, a wide range of restrictive measures. These\nmeasures often target specific activities; they also include, for instance, restrictions on non-\nfinancial activities such as trade embargoes and travel bans. The overwhelming majority of\nsuch measures, however, directly and/or indirectly affects cross-border financial relations and\nis, therefore, also officially recorded as a financial sanction (which is the policy instrument of\nour interest). Embargoes on exports of specific types of goods, for instance, typically involve\nrestrictions on technical assistance, training and financing; travel bans on named individuals\nare often accompanied by other restrictive measures, such as the freezing of funds and\nfinancial assets. The measures are also regularly reviewed and frequently adjusted. Besedes,\nGoldbach and Nitsch (2017), for instance, use this information to also examine the effects of\nthe strength, and changes in the strength (i.e., tightening and loosening), of sanctions on cross-\nborder capital flows. In this paper, to save space, we generally limit our attention to the\ndistinction whether a country is sanctioned or not.\nOur analysis is based on two confidential micro data sets from the Deutsche\nBundesbank. Given the sensitivity of the business information involved, the data are only\naccessible, often in anonymized form, at the headquarters of the Bundesbank in Frankfurt,\nGermany.\nWe use the Deutsche Bundesbank's balance of payments statistics as our main source\nof data. This register contains detailed information on financial transactions between\nGermany and the rest of the world and has, for our purposes, at least two notable advantages.\nFirst, the data set is complete; all individuals, firms and financial institutions located in\nGermany are required to report cross-border payments in excess of 12,500 euros to the\nDeutsche Bundesbank, allowing the central bank to compile the monthly balance of payments\nstatistics.9 Second, the register collects information on various transaction features, including\nthe name and the address of the reporting unit, thereby allowing us to identify cross-border\nfinancial activities of non-financial declarants.10 In addition, for each single declaration, the\nvalue and the partner country of the transaction are provided as well as information on the\ntype of asset that is transferred (bonds, commercial paper, stocks, investment certificate,\nequity capital, credit and other capital).11 Hence, although the frequency of the data is\nmonthly, with information provided at the end of the month, the data is effectively close to the\nlevel of the individual transaction.\nIn contrast to Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch (2017), however, we do not use the full\nsample of balance of payments entries available to us, but, aiming to assess the domestic\n(economic) costs of sanctions, focus our attention exclusively on transactions of non-financial\ndeclarants. Consequently, we exclude cross-border financial flows reported by financial\ninstitutions, many of them of considerable magnitude, which implies a loss of 4,364\ndeclarants out of a total of 47,674 reporting units. We also deviate from Besedes, Goldbach\n9 See Section 67 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance\n(Au\u00dfenwirtschaftsverordnung), available at\nhttp://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/A/awv-englisch.html.\n10 Cross-border transactions by households and individuals are typically declared by the\nfinancial institution that handles the transfer.\n11 For a few types of transactions, exemptions exist such that there is no declaration\nnecessary; these exemptions are: payments below the threshold of 12,500 euro, payments\nrelated to the export and import of goods, (re-)payments related to short-term (duration of less\nthan 12 months) loans, paid short-term deposits to foreign monetary institutions and payments\nwhich are forwarded to other foreigners.\nand Nitsch (2017) in analyzing more years of data. Our sample covers the period from\nThe second source of information that we use is the corporate balance sheets database\nof the Bundesbank, Ustan. The Bundesbank has collected, for various purposes, extensive\ndata on individual firms. The data are often taken from financial statements, but may also\nhave been obtained from a mandatory questionnaire that covers the firms' balance sheet and\nprofit and loss accounts data. Most notably for our purposes, the database contains\ninformation on firm characteristics that are not included in the balance of payments data (such\nas firm employment or sales).12\nThe corporate balance sheets data are available on an annual basis. We merge the data\nwith our information from the balance of payments data by the corresponding year (such that\nannual firm data is matched with the monthly transactions data in each of the twelve months\nin a given year). As the firm identifiers are not identical for the two data sets, we apply a\npropensity score string matching algorithm, based on the name of the firm, its address and its\nlegal form, to link the two data sets. Schild, Schultz, and Wieser (2017) provide a detailed\ndiscussion of the matching methodology and the quality of the match; see also Appendix 1.\nInformation on financial sanctions is mainly obtained from the service center\n`Financial Sanctions' of the Deutsche Bundesbank.13 This unit, which is responsible for the\nimplementation of European Union Regulations on financial sanctions in Germany, provides\na compilation of executive orders and disseminates relevant information to interested parties\nand the wider public. We augment this data with additional information from official\nEuropean Union sources.14\nDuring our sample period, financial sanctions have been newly imposed on\n23 countries. Table 1 provides a list of countries along with a brief description of the\nmeasures taken.15 As shown, almost all target countries are economically small and/or poorly\ndeveloped. More importantly, they are often of tiny importance for the international financial\n12 For a more detailed description, see\nhttps://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Standardartikel/Bundesbank/Research_Centre/rese\narch_data_micro_data_ustan.html.\nhttp://www.bundesbank.de/Navigation/EN/Service/Financial_sanctions/financial_sanctions.html.\n14 Common Foreign and Security Policy Decisions and European Union Regulations are\npublished in the Official Journal of the EU; see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html.\n15 The table has been updated and extended from Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch (2017).\nbusiness relationships of German non-financial companies. As shown in Figure 1, to the\nextent any (direct) financial activities are reported, the target countries typically account, with\nfew exceptions, for less than 0.01 percent of cross-border capital flows by German non-\nfinancials.\nSanctions are applied instantaneously, such that there is no time lag between the date\nof announcement of a sanction and its enforcement. In our empirical analysis, with balance of\npayments data at monthly frequency, we code sanctions imposed after the middle of the\nmonth as being effective from the beginning of the following month. For two target countries,\nUzbekistan and the Comoros, the sanctions have also been lifted again completely during our\nsample period. However, as German non-financial entities do not declare any financial\nbusiness with the Comoros, these episodes of a (reverse) switch in sanction status are\nIn Table 2, we describe our financial data in more detail. As noted above, the raw data\nare highly disaggregated, with separate statistical entries in a given month for each feature of\na transaction. Therefore, in order to partly reduce the complexity of the data, the table reviews\ndata at the country-month level, our main unit of analysis. Descriptive statistics are presented\nfor both the full sample of available observations, and for transactions under sanction, along\nwith a p-value for a t-test of equality of means.\nTable 2 illustrates the various features and dimensions of our (raw) balance of\npayments data. For each country-month pair in our sample, there are, on average, about 33\nseparate entries of cross-border financial activities; each entry refers to a capital flow activity\n(inflow or outflow) in one of nine asset categories by a single German non-financial reporting\nunit (or declarant). Overall, there is broad trading activity which is particularly concentrated\nin credit, equity capital and direct investment credit.17\nMore interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, given the irrelevance of many\nsanction targets as a financial partner noted above, bilateral financial interactions with\nsanctioned countries are rare; sanction episodes account for only 4 percent of our sample (of\ncountry-month pairs). Also, capital flows under sanctions are, on average, of smaller,\n16 Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch (2017) use these episodes to replicate their analysis for the\nremoval (instead of the imposition) of sanctions, without new insights.\n17 Once the sample is expanded to also include financial institutions and insurance companies,\nfinancial flows are dominated by trading activities in bonds and stocks; see Besedes,\nalthough still sizable, magnitude.18 There are fewer balance of payments `transactions',\nreported by a smaller number of declarants and involving fewer asset classes, potentially\nalready reflecting greater administrative hurdles due to the imposition of financial sanctions.\n4. Business with Sanctioned Countries\nWe begin our empirical analysis of the domestic costs of sanctions by examining the\neffect of sanctions on the targeted economic activity. Since financial sanctions typically put\nrestrictions on cross-border financial interactions, we apply a differences-in-differences\napproach to analyze how financial flows declared by German non-financial entities to/from\nsanctioned countries have changed after the imposition of sanctions. More specifically, we\nestimate variants of the following model:\n(1) Log(Flowct\n) =  +  Sanctionsct\n{+ Xct\n} + c\n+ t\n+ ct\nwhere Flowct\nis a measure of German financial activity with country c at time t, Sanctionsct\nis\nan indicator variable that takes the value of one when financial sanctions are imposed (and is\nzero otherwise), Xct\nis a vector of auxiliary control variables, and we include a full set of\ncountry-specific (c\n) and time-specific (t\n) fixed effects. The coefficient of interest to us is ,\nwhich measures the effect of sanctions on cross-border financial activities; a negative and\nsignificant coefficient indicates that the adoption of sanctions is associated with fewer\nfinancial interactions between German non-financial declarants and their foreign counterparts,\nceteris paribus. Throughout the analysis, we estimate regressions with OLS and apply cluster-\nrobust Huber-White standard errors. Also, we analyze the data at the country-month level to\nreduce the amount of noise, and especially the number of zero observations (i.e., observations\nof no flows), in the raw data.19\n18 As noted above, restrictive measures are typically tailored in order to promote the desired\noutcome; they do not prohibit automatically all business dealings with a sanctioned country.\nFor the EU's description of best practices for the effective implementation of restrictive\nmeasures, see http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/cfsp/sanctions/docs/index_en.pdf.\n19 As we examine a balanced sample, the analysis of more disaggregated data inflates the size\nof the panel dramatically.\nWe use four different variables to measure the intensity of bilateral financial\ninteractions between Germany and countries (or, more precisely, territories) in the rest of the\nworld: (1) the total value of bilateral capital flows (defined as the sum of inflows and\noutflows), (2) the value of gross capital inflows, (3) the value of gross capital outflows, and\n(4) the net value of bilateral capital flows (defined as outflows minus inflows). For us, none of\nthe measures is obviously superior to any other, although we put perhaps somewhat less\nemphasis on the estimation results for net financial flows. We also experiment with adding\nfurther control variables to the baseline fixed effects differences-in-differences specification,\nat the costs of a (much) smaller sample size.\nTable 3 reports the results. Columns (1) to (4) of the table present the estimates from\nthe parsimonious specification of equation (1) which only includes, in addition to our variable\nof interest, the sanctions dummy, two sets of fixed effects. In this specification, all time-\ninvariant influences on German financial flows with a country (such as, for instance, the\npartner's geographic distance from Germany) are accounted for by country fixed effects,\nwhile a comprehensive set of time fixed effects captures monthly variations in capital flows\ncommon to all partners. As shown, the point estimates of  are consistently negative and, with\na value of about -0.8, of about the same magnitude as found in Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch\n(2017) who analyze a shorter but more comprehensive sample of German cross-border\nfinancial flows (covering, in addition, declarations by German financial institutions and\ninsurance companies). Taken at face value, the point estimates of  imply that capital flows\nby German non-financial businesses with target countries of sanctions decrease, on average,\nby about 55 percent (exp(-0.8)-1) after the imposition of financial sanctions which seems\neconomically plausible. In comparison to Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch (2017), however, the\nstatistical precision of the estimated effects is considerably lower. Only one of the four\ncoefficients is estimated at the 5 percent level of statistical significance, while the remaining\nthree coefficients are marginally significant at the 10 percent level. As a result, the activities\nof German non-financial entities seem to be less clearly affected by financial sanctions than\nthe business activities of financial declarants.\nThis finding is confirmed when we additionally control for standard determinants of\nbilateral financial flows (such as the partner country's stock market capitalization).20 Columns\n(5) to (8) of Table 3 tabulate the results from the augmented model of equation (1). In fact,\nwith this extension, our estimates of  decrease in magnitude by about one-half and become\nstatistically indifferent from zero at any conventional level of confidence. Part of the decline\nin the estimated sanctions effect is explained by time-varying country-specific features. A\ncountry's overall financial openness, for instance, turns out to be, as expected, positively\nassociated with German capital flows and is likely to decline under sanctions. The results are\nalso affected, however, by the considerably reduced sample size. As some control variables\nare only available for a limited number of countries, our sample is effectively reduced to\ncover only seven (of 23) sanctions episodes. For these episodes, then, which contain the\neconomically more relevant markets from the list of sanctioned countries, there is hardly any\nmeasurable effect of sanctions on the cross-border capital flows of German non-financial\ndeclarants identifiable. When we reestimate, for the restricted sample, the parsimonious\nspecification of equation (1), the estimated  coefficient is of (borderline) statistical\nsignificance for only two measures of cross-border financial activity (total flows and net\nIn Table 4, we expand our analysis to cover not only the value of financial flows but\nalso other quantitative features of Germany's bilateral financial relationship with a country. In\nparticular, we decompose aggregate financial flows with a partner into various (contributing)\nfactors (such as the number of German reporting units that actually declare financial\ntransactions with the country) and estimate the sanctions effect for these factors separately.\nThe results of these decomposition exercises are reported in Table 4. As before, we\nexperiment with various specifications of equation (1). However, to save space, we only\nreport estimates for the coefficient of interest, ; that is, each cell in the table contains the\nresults of a separate regression. The regressand is tabulated in the first column on the left of\nthe table; the remaining eight columns correspond to the specifications of equation (1) in\nTable 3 (including additional country controls for columns (5)-(8)). For comparison, the first\nrow of Table 4 replicates the results for the value of financial flows shown in the first row of\nReviewing the results, the sanctions effect varies sizably by type of margin.\nSpecifically, for measures of the extensive margin of a bilateral financial relationship (such\n21 Results are available on request.\n22 Instead of controlling for determinants of cross-border financial flows, it may also be\nreasonable to restrict the analysis to a homogeneous group of countries. When we analyze a\nsample that only includes countries with a per capita income below that of the sanctioned\ncountry with the highest per capita income (Russia), our baseline results remain qualitatively\nunchanged.\nas, for instance, the number of German reporting units that declare financial activities with a\ncountry in a given month), the estimated  coefficients take consistently negative and\nstatistically significant values. In particular, our point estimates imply a decline in the number\nof declarants, depending on specification, by between 26 and 32 percent, while somewhat\nlarger effects are observed for the number of statistical entries in the balance of payments.\nMore notably, this finding is largely unaffected when we extend our specification to include\nadditional control variables. As shown in columns (5) to (8), the coefficients even tend to\nincrease in magnitude with this extension. In contrast to our findings for the intensive margin,\nthese results indicate a measurable decline in financial activities with sanctioned countries\nafter the imposition of sanctions.\nA reasonable explanation for the discrepancy in our findings for the effects of\nsanctions along the intensive and the extensive margin is that `smart' sanctions are, indeed,\nsmart. To be more precise, financial restrictions may induce a reduction, or maybe even a\ncomplete elimination, of targeted economic activities, while hardly affecting Germany's\noverall financial relationship with a sanctioned country. Consequently, they do not cause\ncollateral damage.\nTable 5 explores this hypothesis in more detail. In this table, we return to our analysis\nof the value of aggregate financial flows but now split the sanctions dummy by the size of the\npartner country's market as proxied by the number of German entities declaring financial\nactivities with a country; that is, instead of a single indicator variable for the application of\nfinancial sanctions, we now use two variables to identify sanctions episodes.23 In particular,\nwe hypothesize that financial restrictions have a larger effect on aggregate financial flows if\nthey are imposed on countries in which only few German declarants report activities, while a\nwithdrawal of some declarants may have basically no effect in markets with many German\nparticipants. As shown, the results indeed differ notably by market size. For small markets,\nfor which the number of German declarants is below the median, the value of capital flows\nconsistently declines after the imposition of sanctions, while the effect is statistically\nindifferent from zero for large markets. In sum, financial sanctions measurably restrict the\n23 For each sanctions episode, we count the number of German declarants that report financial\nactivities with the target country in the twelve months before the imposition of the sanction\nand, then, split the sample in half to identify, according to this measure, large and small target\ncountries. We also experiment, in unreported results, with other measures of market size, such\nas a country's GDP, obtaining qualitatively similar findings. In line with our approach, Eaton,\nKortum, and Kramarz (2011) document, for French firms, that the number of firms selling to\na market increases with the size of the market.\nfinancial activities of German non-financial declarants with the target country. However,\nexcept for target countries of (very) limited economic importance for German non-financials,\nthere is no significant decline in overall business activity with the target country identifiable.\n5. Firms Facing Sanctions\nAn implicit assumption in reduced-form assessments of the domestic costs of\nsanctions is that financial restrictions affect all internationally active firms in similar fashion.\nFirms reporting business with sanctioned countries, however, may be systematically different\nfrom other declarants, potentially affecting their ability to cope with restrictions. Therefore,\nwe next describe German non-financial entities that report cross-border capital flows with a\nsanctioned country in more detail. To do so, we construct, from the balance of payments,\nmeasures of the extent of a firm's monthly cross-border financial activities and estimate\nregressions of the form:\n(2) log(FirmActivity)it\n=  +  SanctionedFirmit\n{+ Zit\n} + t\n+ it\nwhere FirmActivityit\nis a measure of declarant i's aggregate cross-border financial activity at\ntime t, SanctionedFirmit\nis an indicator variable that takes the value of one when declarant i\nfaces sanctions on (part of) its business at time t (and is zero otherwise), Z is a vector of\nauxiliary control variables, and we include a full set of time-specific (t\n) fixed effects. Our\nunit of observation for this exercise is a firm-month pair; that is, we compute, for each firm in\nour sample, a measure of the firm's business activities at a given point in time, and compare\nfirms that declare activities with at least one country under sanctions with firms only reporting\ntransactions with non-sanctioned countries, holding constant for other factors. To the extent\nthere is any systematic difference between the firms identifiable, this difference will be\ncaptured by , the estimated coefficient on our variable of interest.\nAs before, we proceed sequentially. We begin our analysis with a measure of how\nactive a non-financial entity is in cross-border financial business as proxied by the log number\nof entries in the balance of payments statistics by a declarant in a given month (i.e., the firm-\nasset-country triplet). The results are reported in the first column in Table 6. The estimated\ncoefficient on the sanctions dummy is positive and statistically significant, indicating that\nnon-financial declarants hit by sanctions tend to report a disproportionately large number of\nactivities with countries worldwide. The point estimate of 1.3 indicates that firms affected by\nsanctions report, on average, 130 percent more cross-border financial transactions, measured\nby the number of country-asset pair entries in the balance of payments, than other declarants.\nMoreover, columns (2) to (4) show that this result remains qualitatively unchanged when we\ninclude additional control variables. In particular, we successively add (1) a comprehensive\nset of sector fixed effects to control for any industry-specific factors that may affect a firm's\ncross-border financial activity, (2) the total value of a firm's capital flows to control for firm\nsize, and (3) the number of the firm's international markets that are under sanctions. While\nsector fixed effects and a firm's total cross-border flows explain part of the difference\nbetween entities operating under sanctions and other declarants, sanction-affected entities are\nstill disproportionately more active in international markets, with the effect getting stronger\nthe larger the number of sanctioned markets for which an entity reports business activities.\nSimilarly, the results also hold for a balanced sample, which also includes (previously\ndropped) observations of zero cross-border activity, as shown in columns (5) to (8).24\nIn Table 7, we experiment with other measures of firm activity, including firm\ncharacteristics taken from the corporate balance sheets database (such as employment and\nsales), without much effect on our main findings. Non-financial entities with activities in\nsanctioned countries are significantly larger than other declarants, by approximately 40\npercent for both employment and sales. Firms which are active in sanctioned markets also\nhave more total assets, and they are more productive.\nIn sum, we conclude that financial sanctions predominantly affect non-financial\ndeclarants with a wide range of domestic and international business activities and, therefore,\nconsiderable outside options. For a proper assessment of the domestic costs of sanctions, this\nempirical finding, which is unobservable from the analysis of aggregate data, may be of\nparticular relevance.\n6. Responses to Sanctions\nIn view of the outside business opportunities, we next examine how German non-\nfinancial declarants respond to the imposition of sanctions. To analyze this issue, we make\n24 Following standard practice, we add the value of 1 to our measure of firm activity, the\nnumber of firm-asset-partner triplets, to allow for log-linearization of this variable.\nexplicit use of our granular data that allow us to observe cross-border financial activities by\nindividual declarant. In particular, we perform a two-step procedure. In a first step, we\nidentify German reporting units which declared financial activities with sanctioned countries\nin the period of 12 months before restrictive measures were imposed. These declarants are\nclassified as firms affected by sanctions.25 Then, based on this information, we analyze\ndifferences in the activities between declarants affected (or `treated') by sanctions and\ndeclarants without any business operations with target countries, examining firm activities\nwith non-sanctioned countries only. We hypothesize that any systematic variation over time in\nthe size and scope of financial activities with non-sanctioned countries between the two\ngroups of declarants can be interpreted as evidence of business responses related to the\nimposition of sanctions. Specifically, we estimate equations of the form:\n(3) Log(Flowi\nct\n) =  +  AffectedFirmi\nct\n{+ Xct\n} + i\nc\n+ t\n+ ct\nwhere Flowi\nct\nis a measure of German financial activity of declarant i with country c at time t,\nAffectedFirmi\nct\nis an indicator variable that takes the value of one when a declarant reported\nbusiness operations with a target country of sanctions in the 12 months before sanctions were\nimposed (and is zero otherwise), X is a vector of auxiliary control variables, and we include\nfull sets of declarant-country-specific (i\nc\n) and time-specific (t\n) fixed effects. In our\nempirical setting in which we focus exclusively on a sample of non-sanctioned countries and,\ntherefore, ignore the direct effects of sanctions, the estimate of  indicates the extent to which\nfinancial activities of treated reporting units with a given country deviate from the activities of\nother declarants after the treated units have been exposed to the treatment (i.e, they suffer\nfrom the imposition of sanctions on a third country).\nTable 8 presents the results. The table is constructed analogously to our benchmark\nanalysis of cross-border financial flows (Table 3); that is, we report estimates for our four\nmeasures of bilateral capital flows, using both a highly parsimonious specification of equation\n(3), with results being tabulated in columns (1)-(4) of the table, as well as a more demanding\nspecification with additional control variables, for which the results are tabulated in columns\n25 A time window of 12 months before the imposition of sanctions allows us to ignore\npossible seasonal variation in financial activities. However, when we experiment with other\ntime windows to identify sanctions-affected firms, we obtain very similar results.\n(5)-(8). As before, the number of observations declines as the number of regressors increases\nbecause of missing country data. However, the drop in sample size turns out to be somewhat\nless pronounced for the analysis of firm-level data. Moreover, to the extent the control\nvariables take significant coefficients, the results are reasonable and intuitive. Most notably,\nthe effect of this modification on the main results is negligible, in contrast to our baseline\nfindings above.\nTurning to the variable of interest, the estimates of  are consistently positive and\neconomically and statistically significant. Often, the t-statistic is close to ten. This finding\nsuggests that German declarants affected by sanctions policies indeed turn out to be highly\nflexible in adjusting their business patterns, successfully exploring alternative business\nopportunities. According to our point estimates, treated declarants expand their activities with\nother (non-sanctioned) countries relative to German declarants unaffected by financial\nsanctions by 35 to 55 percent, depending on specification.\nAnother possible interpretation that is consistent with our empirical findings, however,\nis that declarants, instead of opening up new markets, simply continue business operations\nwith target countries, via extended transactions with third countries. Consequently, sanctions\nwould be largely ineffective because affected declarants circumvent the restrictions by using\nthird countries as intermediaries.\nUnfortunately, our data does not allow us to directly distinguish between these two\ndifferent interpretations of the observed increase in third-country capital flows by sanctions-\naffected German declarants.26 However, we are able to identify possible circumvention\nbehavior. In particular, it is argued that circumvention of sanctions becomes more difficult the\nmore countries impose them. As sanctions in our sample are imposed either by the European\nUnion or by the entire United Nations, we expect to find evidence of circumvention, if\nanything, for sanctions imposed by the European Union alone. Further, it is assumed that\ncountries which are economically close to the target countries of sanctions are the countries\nwhich may be more likely to serve as an intermediary.27 Therefore, we identify a target\n26 The main restriction is our limited access to data, covering detailed balance of payments\ninformation from only a single source country, Germany.\n27 Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch (2017) also examine other potential intermediaries for the\ncircumvention of financial sanctions, such as offshore financial centers. However, for this\ngroup of countries and territories, the results are much less conclusive.\ncountry's five largest trading partners in the 12 months before the imposition of sanctions.28\nSpecifically, we argue that a relative increase in the financial relationships of sanction-\n`treated' units with countries which are major trading partners of sanctioned countries can be\ninterpreted as evidence of circumvention.29\nEstimation results are contained in Table 9. In contrast to our previous analysis, in\nwhich we use a single variable to describe the cross-border financial activities of German\nnon-financial declarants affected by the imposition of sanctions relative to reporting units\nunaffected by sanctions, we now use six measures; these measures differentiate between the\nscope of sanctions (EU, UN) and the destination of third-country capital flows (top 5 trading\npartners of the target country, rest of the world), respectively. In combination, the results are\nindicative of circumvention behavior. Two findings are particularly noteworthy. First, for\nsanctions which have been imposed by the European Union alone, the estimated coefficients\non the interaction terms (EU sanctions \u00d7 destination) consistently take positive and significant\nvalues. As a result, third-country capital flows of German declarants affected by EU sanctions\nhave, on average, sizably increased in relative terms. More importantly, the coefficients are\nlarger, in both a statistical and an economic sense, for financial transactions with countries\nwith close economic ties with sanctioned countries. Depending on the flow and regression\nspecification, the point estimates imply that business with the largest trading partners of\nsanctioned countries increased by about 80 to 120 percent whereas business with all other\ncountries expanded by only about 30 to 60 percent. This notable difference in the geographic\ndiversification of financial activities, holding constant for other factors, is suggestive of the\npossibility of circumvention behavior by sanctions-affected German declarants. Second, for\nUN sanctions, we obtain very different results. For these sanctions, which are (by definition)\nbroader in geographic scope, transactions of affected firms increase, if anything, only for\ncountries other than the major trading partners of target countries. As there is a priori no\nreason to expect a difference in patterns of geographic readjustment of financial activities by\ntype of sanction, we argue, in line with Besedes, Goldbach and Nitsch (2017), that this finding\nprovides further evidence of efforts by affected declarants to circumvent financial sanctions.\n28 Monthly data on bilateral values of trade between countries are obtained from the\nInternational Monetary Fund's Direction of Trade Statistics. We compute a country's trade\nshares based on the sum of exports and imports.\n29 Circumvention does not necessarily imply that a sanctions regime is violated. Due to the\nadministrative burden associated with sanctions, for instance, declarants also have a\nreasonable incentive to reroute legal activities.\nIn sum, we conclude that, in response to sanctions, affected firms expand their\nbusiness with non-sanctioned countries. Especially for sanctions imposed by the EU alone,\nthere is indirect evidence that firms manage to continue their business operations with the\ntarget countries via non-sanctioned countries which display close trade ties to the sanctioned\ncountry and, therefore, serve as intermediaries.\n7. Sanctions and Firm Performance\nIn a final exercise, we examine the overall costs of sanctions on domestic businesses.\nIn view of the frequent and widespread opposition of industry groups and business leaders to\nsanction policies, emphasizing the loss in foreign business opportunities associated with such\npolicy measures, the restrictions are expected to (also) have measurable negative\nconsequences for the domestic economy, at least at the firm level. Therefore, we ask: Do\nGerman non-financial declarants affected by sanctions experience an identifiable decline in\nfirm performance?\nWe analyze this issue by estimating regressions of the form:\n(4) log(FirmPerformance)it\n=  +  AffectedSanctionedFirmit\n+ i\n+ t\n+ it\nwhere FirmPerformanceit\nis a measure of declarant i's overall economic performance at time t,\nAffectedSanctionedFirmit\nis an indicator variable that takes the value of one when declarant i\nreports business with a sanctioned country within 12 months before the imposition of\nsanctions or after the imposition of sanctions (and is zero otherwise), and we include a full set\nof firm-specific (i\n) and time-specific (t\n) fixed effects. In this differences-in-differences\nsetting, to the extent that sanctions have any measurable effect on German non-financial\nentities, we expect the estimate of  to be negative and significant, indicating that firm\nperformance worsens after the imposition of sanctions, holding constant for other\n(unobserved) firm features. As our data on firm characteristics are of annual frequency, we\nfocus, in our baseline specification, on the contemporaneous association between sanctions\nand firm performance. Also, we jointly analyze the effects of sanctions on declarants that are\naffected by sanctions (because they reported business operations with a sanctioned country in\nthe 12 months before sanctions were imposed) and declarants that (continue to) operate under\nsanctions since a firm's activities may have been reduced or eliminated completely due to the\nimposition of restrictions.\nTable 10 presents the results. As before, we experiment with a wide range of firm\ncharacteristics. Each column of the table reports the results of a separate regression, with the\nregressand tabulated in the first line. We begin, in column (1), with a model specification in\nwhich firm performance is proxied by the number of employees. In particular, we argue that\nthe size of the workforce is probably the most comprehensive measure of a firm's economic\nadjustment costs to a sanctions environment. For firm employment as dependent variable,\nhowever, the point estimate of , although negative, is economically small and statistically\nindistinguishable from zero. Taken at face value, this finding indicates that there is no\nmeasurable association between sanctions and firm performance. According to our estimation\nresult, sanctions-affected firms do not change their labor force in response to sanctions. Still,\nadjustments in employment may be generally difficult, especially in the short term, due to\nGerman labor market regulations. Therefore, we next analyze a potentially more sensitive\nperformance measure, a firm's total sales. As shown in column (2), for this regressand, the\npoint estimate of  slightly increases in magnitude, but we obtain qualitatively similar\nestimation results. In line with our (weak) findings for the effects of sanctions on cross-border\nfinancial activities along the intensive margin, there is no evidence of a sizable drop in overall\neconomic activity after the imposition of sanctions. Reassuringly, we note that this conclusion\nalso holds for all our other measures of firm performance. The estimation results for assets,\nwages, capital intensity and productivity are tabulated in the remaining four columns of\nWe perform extensive robustness checks to confirm that the results are insensitive to\nthe exact regression specification.30 For instance, we lag the regressor of interest one year to\nreduce possible simultaneity problems. We also estimate separate effects for firms affected by\nsanctions (and discontinuing business with the sanctioned country) and firms that still declare\nactivities under sanctions. In none of these changes, however, the estimate of  takes a value\nthat is statistically different from zero. As there is no observable difference in the business\nperformance of German firms that either currently declare or previously have declared or\nnever have declared transactions with a sanctioned country, we conclude that the domestic\ncosts of financial sanctions at the firm level are negligible.\n30 In order to save space, we do not report the results.\n8. Conclusions\nSanctions are meant to hurt! By restricting a country's access to international markets,\nthey impose costs on the foreign government, with the ultimate aim of inducing a fundamental\nchange in the government's policies. At the same time, however, a reduction in cross-border\nbusiness also implies costs for the domestic economy. In fact, given the sanctioning country's\ndemonstrated willingness to bear the economic burden associated with such measures,\nsanctions are widely considered to be a particularly powerful tool of diplomacy.\nIn this paper, we complement the sizable literature on the effects of sanctions on the\ntarget country by examining the economic costs of sanctions for the sanctioning country. In\nparticular, we use detailed data from the German balance of payments statistics to analyze the\neffects of financial sanctions on German non-financial entities over the period from 1999\nthrough 2014. During this time, Germany imposed, due to its international obligations as a\nmember state of the United Nations and the European Union, restrictive financial measures on\nWe find a measurable decline in Germany's financial activities with the sanctioned\ncountry after the imposition of sanctions. For non-financial entities, however, the reduction in\ncross-border business is mainly along the extensive margin, while the (negative) effect on\nfinancial flows, the intensive margin, is less precisely estimated, as one would expect for\ndiplomatic attempts to `target' sanctions on specific individuals, groups, entities and\nactivities. More notably, our data set allows us to identify entities that declared business with\nthe sanctioned country and, therefore, can be assumed to be directly affected by the restrictive\nmeasures. These entities are not only found to be more active in international markets,\nproviding them with numerous outside options to deal with the decline in business with the\nsanctioned country, there is also consistent evidence that they make use of such options,\nsignificantly expanding their business operations with non-sanctioned countries. As a result, it\nis unsurprising that we find no sanctions effect on aggregate indicators of firm-level activity,\nsuch as employment or sales. Overall, we conclude that sanctions have, at most, limited\neconomic consequences for the sanctioning country.\nReferences:\nBernard, Andrew B., J. Bradford Jensen, Stephen J. Redding and Peter K.

However, for some analyses, we also link the\ninformation from the BoP statistics to firm-level information taken from the Deutsche\nBundesbank's corporate balance sheets database (Ustan).\nCollected for different purposes and by different departments within Deutsche Bundesbank,\nthe data lack a unique firm identifier. Therefore, following common internal practice, we\napply a string matching procedure, where the algorithm takes into account the name of a unit,\nits address and its legal form, to identify the same real-world entity in the two data sets.\nSchild, Schultz, and Wieser (2017) provide an extensive documentation of this procedure and\na detailed evaluation of the match result.\nTable A1 presents a brief overview of the various data samples. As shown, 12.1 percent of the\nnon-financial reporting units in the BoP are matched to data in Ustan, covering about 12.7\npercent of the BoP entries. More notably, the matched data set does not differ significantly\nfrom the BoP data. While matched units are expected to be relatively large, their cross-border\nfinancial flows only marginally exceed the averages in the BoP sample.\nBoP Ustan BoP-Ustan\nFrequency Monthly Yearly Monthly\nShare of Sanctioned\nObservations (%)\nNotes: All data have been obtained from the Deutsche Bundesbank. BoP is the balance of\npayments; Ustan is the corporate balance sheet statistics."
