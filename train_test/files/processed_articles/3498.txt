    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe conducted open-ended interviews with 15 women with disability who had reported violence in a preceding survey.\nEmergent themes included a lack of acceptance by families, the systematic formation of a dependent self-image, and an\nexpectation of limited achievement. Emotional violence was particularly emphasized, as was perceived structural violence\nstemming from social norms, which led to exclusion and vulnerability. Violence in the natal home was an issue that had been\nrelatively uninvestigated.\n",

Normal as in, if someone is physically fit or\nis married . . . whatever their thinking may be, they will be\nconsidered normal and they will be given importance. But, if\nthere is disability . . . then this is considered wrong and there is\nno acceptance from society . . . (D01, 30 years, visual\nimpairment)\nSocial norms in India are influenced by values such as pro-\nductivity, the right to private property, and patriarchy\n(Ahmed-Ghosh, 2004). Much is made of the rule of law, the\ninstitution of marriage (Goel, 2005), the family as a social\nunit, and the importance of religion. The family--able-bodied,\nheterosexual, and engaged in socially acceptable liveli-\nhoods--is the fundamental social unit. The history of the\nIndian women's movement has been one of focus on poverty,\ncaste, and employment, issues such as dowry and sati, popu-\nlation control and female feticide, sexuality, and domestic\nviolence. Its agenda has not, generally, included disability.\nCritical feminist analysis of disability in India was initiated\ninist scholars challenged the disability movement and the\nwomen's movement.\nAn idea common in India is that disability represents a\npersonal flaw. Able-bodied people are the \"corporeal stan-\ndard\" (Kumari, 2009), and--from a moral perspective--\ndisability arises as a consequence of karmic misdeeds:\nImpairments are deserved and intrinsically punitive. Two\nother perspectives on disability are also common. From a\ncharity or welfare perspective, disability speaks to an idea of\nvictimhood with which campaigners against violence against\nwomen are familiar. The individual with disability deserves\nsympathy and is dependent on the assistance of others. From\na biomedical or rehabilitative perspective, disability encom-\npasses defects that require clinical intervention. Pervasive as\nthey are, these models are outmoded in disability discourse.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons\nWith Disabilities (UN CRPD) recognizes that disability can\nbe seen as a collection of hindrances to participation in soci-\nety, a product of the interaction between people with impair-\nments, attitudinal, and environmental barriers. This model\nlocates disability in relation to structures rather than with\nthe individual. A rights-based model broadens this position\nby promoting acceptance of diversity through nondiscrimi-\nnating environments and inclusive social processes, to level\nthe playing field by tackling the visible privileges of the\nable-bodied. Finally, in a cultural model, disability repre-\nsents a pervasive system that, through stigmatization of\nimpairment, informs our notions of self, family, society, and\nsexuality. Garland-Thomson argues that the system defines\n1Society for Nutrition, Education, and Health Action, Mumbai, India\n2UCL, London, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid Osrin, UCL Institute for Global Health, Institute of Child Health, 30\nGuilford Street, London WC1N 1EH, UK.\nEmail: d.osrin@ucl.ac.uk\nViolence Against Women With Disability\nin Mumbai, India: A Qualitative Study\nNayreen Daruwalla1, Shruti Chakravarty1, Sangeeta Chatterji1,\nNeena Shah More1, Glyn Alcock2, Sarah Hawkes2,\nand David Osrin2\n Keywords\nviolence against women, India, Mumbai, disability\n2 SAGE Open\nthe relationship between bodies and their environments and\nprescribes a set of practices that produce both the able-\nbodied and the disabled (Reproductive and Sexual Health\nIf women with disability do not physically measure up to\nable-bodied standards, neither does society expect them to\ndo so. In many cases, they are not expected to adopt the roles\nof wife and mother. Women with disability do not, however,\nquietly acquiesce to this. They may struggle against negative\nstereotyping in an attempt to develop a positive sense of self\nwithin bodily and societal limitations, a struggle that does\nnot often leave space for celebration of difference and pride\nin one's individuality (Addlakha, 2006). In a series of narra-\ntive interviews with young people with disability, gender\nwas a defining element of the disability experience, but\nmeshed with elements such as class and caste, family com-\npositionanddynamics,andgeographicallocation.Experience\nof segregation and inclusion influenced informants'opinions\non marriage and family life and their social behavior, and,\nalthough the charity model of disability was slowly giving\nway to a human rights model, the transition was far from\ncomplete (Addlakha, 2007). This study presents the findings\nof a series of follow-up interviews with women with visual\nor locomotor impairment.\nMethod\nSetting\nThe study was carried out in Mumbai by the Society for\nNutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), a non-\ngovernmental organization. It was one of the three--in India,\nBangladesh, and Nepal--that formed a project on under-\nstanding violence against marginalized women in south Asia\n(Dutta, Weston, Bhattacharji, Mukherji, & Joseph, 2012).\nDesign and Procedures\nDuring an initial survey interview, we asked women who\nreported an experience of violence if they would be interested\nin participating in a later in-depth interview. We were able to\ngenerate a subsample within the strata used for the survey.\nTwo pilot interviews were carried out to develop a better\nunderstanding of the process, and subsequent interviews were\nconducted by four senior researchers. Beginning with a topic\nguide to key areas of interest, respondents were asked to\nrecount instances of violence and locate them within their\nwider experience. The guide included open-ended questions\nabout the respondent's self-perception (e.g., her body image\nand personality), family environment and social networks,\nsources of psychological and social support, perspectives on\nlife as a woman in India, the idea of violence, experiences of\nviolence, and responses and coping strategies. Interviewers\nused spontaneous probes to clarify information and to explore\nin more detail other aspects of respondents' narratives.\nData Management and Analysis\nEach woman was interviewed once, at a location of her\nchoice, typically in her home or accommodation, an office,\nor--less frequently--a public space. We took written con-\nsent. Interviews lasted an average 70 min, were digitally\nrecorded and transferred to secure files on a password-pro-\ntected computer. Original audio recordings were deleted\nafter transfer and access was restricted to the study coordina-\ntor and data analysts. Interviews were transcribed verbatim\nand translated into English (Easton, Fry, & Greenberg, 2000;\nMcLellan, MacQueen, & Neidig, 2003), following a pre-\ndefined protocol to ensure consistency of transcription.\nTranscripts also included the researcher's observations of the\ninterview setting, the reactions and behavior of the respon-\ndent, reflections on the interview process, and additional\ninformation not captured digitally. Respondents' names and\nother identifying information were removed or replaced with\npseudonyms. Transcribed, anonymized interviews were\nimported into NVivo version 7 qualitative data analysis soft-\nware (QSR International), on a secure computer. The master\nlist was prepared with anonymous codes and was stored in a\nlocked cupboard.\nThe analysis was carried out through a series of meetings\nand online discussions that emphasized the extraction of\nthemes from the data. We followed an iterative process, using\nfindings from initial interviews to inform subsequent lines of\ninquiry. We examined the qualitative data using a framework\napproach, incorporating some principles of grounded theory\nfor initial coding (Green & Thorogood, 2004; Lacey & Luff,\n2007). From the outset, members of the research team read\nand reviewed the transcripts of all the interviews to familiar-\nize themselves with the data. We kept analytical notes on our\nreflections on them, to include in the analysis and to inform\nfurther data collection. We developed an initial thematic\nframework from both a priori and emerging issues and used\nopen coding to identify, examine, compare, and categorize\nindividual pieces of data. We followed this with axial coding,\nwhereby the codes and categories were rearranged to look for\nconnections and associations between them (Strauss &\nCorbin, 1990). The involvement of multiple researchers\nhelped us question our coding framework, propose new\ncodes, and offer alternative interpretations (Barbour, 2001).\nAs a result, we were able to refine our framework as further\ndata were collected, discussed, and analyzed. These data, in\nthe form of summaries and interview extracts, were copied\ninto a table to compare and contrast themes and categories\nacross cases. We then used this information to write a series\nof more detailed descriptions, interpretations, and explana-\ntions of our main findings. We used an ecological framework\nto conceptualize women's experiences of violence (Heise,\nunderstand the origins of gender-based violence, the frame-\nwork emphasizes the reciprocity between people and their\nenvironment, recognizing the complex interplay between\nDaruwalla et al. 3\npersonal, situational, and sociocultural factors. It considers\nindividual development and personality, interactions between\nindividuals and the subjective meanings they assign to them,\nthe formal and informal social structures that influence an\nindividual's environment, and the broader cultural values and\nbeliefs that permeate and inform the other levels.\nResearch Governance and Ethical Issues\nThe study was overseen by a steering group and approved by\nthe joint Institutional Ethics Committee of the Anusandhan\nTrust and the University College London Research Ethics\nCommittee. We prespecified in the study protocol that partici-\npants should freely choose to be involved, at a time and place\noftheirselection,andcouldwithdrawatanytime.Interviewers\nwere trained in discussing sensitive issues and mechanisms\nput in place for referral for support. The research team identi-\nfied organizations that would be accessible to participants and\ncould provide timely and appropriate services. Investigators\nwere equipped with the contact details of organizations across\nMumbai who had consented in writing to accept referrals. All\nsuch referrals were documented and followed up to meet the\nrequests made by respondents. A protocol was followed for\naction in cases of violence, abuse, or distress. Clarity on the\nresponsibility of the researcher for inadvertently provoking\nany action by respondents was also established.\nResults\nWe interviewed 15 women with disability. Twelve had visual\nimpairment, 2, locomotor impairment, and 1 had both. Eight\nwere between the ages of 18 and 30, four were in their thir-\nties and three were older. Five were married. Ten women\nwere Hindu, 4 Muslim, and 1 was Christian. Five came from\npoorer socioeconomic strata, 4 lived in hostels, and others\nlived with their natal or marital families. Two had not had\nany formal schooling, 3 had attended up to the 10th standard,\nand 10 beyond. Nine did not have a job, although 1 of them\nran a small home-based business, and 2 others were learning\nvocational skills.\nChildhood and the Self\nMany of the respondents had grown up around able-bodied\nsiblings and friends and described their childhoods as \"sta-\nble.\" Some reported not being particularly aware of their\nimpairment in childhood, and interacting with their siblings\non an equal footing. As they grew older and were influenced\nby other people, however, they began to feel different.\nWe [brother and I] used to play with friends' children around us.\nI never thought I was blind. But only when my father used to say\nwhen I passed from one room to the other, when his friends used\nto come he used to say, \"She can't see.\" I did not know English\nmuch, but there was some association. Because whenever I\npassed my father used to say this. But what is that \"she can't\nsee\" I could not understand, but there was some association with\nthat. But I didn't know what it was. (D03, 50 years, visual\nimpairment)\nMost of the women with visual impairment had attended\n\"sighted\" schools with teachers who were supportive of their\nneeds. In contrast, women with locomotor impairment\nreported feeling more isolated and had their schooling dis-\nrupted because of the need for medical treatment and time in\nhospital. Institutional discrimination in the form of unequal\naccess to education was reported by a few respondents who\nstruggled to gain admission to regular schools or to take\nexams. This was usually due to an inability to accommodate\nthe girl's needs, a fear that she might have an accident, or\nconcerns that \"she won't be able to keep up with the normal\nstudents.\" In the family environment, women described early\nexperiences of feeling \"not accepted,\" first, because of gen-\nder, and then because of disability: \"When I was born there\nwas no acceptance. First of all she is a girl, and then she is\nblind.\" They described how their parents' disappointment at\nhaving a daughter was compounded by the discovery that she\nalso had a physical impairment:\nI was born normal but [even] from then only I was not accepted.\nBefore me [were] three daughters, so there was no happiness, no\nenthusiasm when I was born. Then, when I was two or one-and-\na-half years, I got polio. After getting polio I was completely\nunacceptable. Completely unacceptable. They did not accept me\nand then they sent me away to my maternal grandmother's\nhouse. (D08, 43 years, locomotor impairment)\nFew of the respondents reported severe physical violence\nduring childhood.Although being hit on the legs by a teacher,\nsmacked by a mother for disobedience, or being yelled at by\na father were events that \"put a lot of fear into us,\" they were\nconsidered \"very, very minor incidents of violence.\" More\ncommon were neglect and verbal abuse, at home and at\nschool, largely driven by attitudes to disability.\nMy mother and father did not pay me much attention. Sometimes\nmy aunt would look after me. When I fell ill, she admitted me to\nthe hospital but no one from my family came to look after me.\n(D14, 20 years, locomotor and visual impairment)\nThe impact of such events on women's self-perception\nmeant that some \"began to believe it.\" While some parents\ntook measures to protect their daughters from accidents, oth-\ners denied them the opportunities enjoyed by other siblings\nbecause they \"did not see the need for me to go out or have\nthings.\" Derogatory comments from peers and family\nreflected a belief that disabled children were incapable and\nunemployable:\nIn my childhood, there were comments I faced from my family.\nIt was verbal. I remember [my father's sister] used to call me\n4 SAGE Open\n\"phutki\" [damaged] . . . In school also we had to listen to\ncomments like, \"Blind people are going to become beggars\nonly--that is your future.\" So that used to make us feel like,\nreally we are not capable of anything . . . \" (D01, 30 years, visual\nimpairment)\nParents who felt that a daughter with locomotor impair-\nment was of little use seldom offered encouragement or con-\nsidered ways in which they could help her overcome the\nchallenges of living with her impairment. In extreme cases,\nparents thought that disabled daughters were better off dead:\n[My father] felt what should he do with me, she is very nice,\nbut what to do with her? They never thought about me in a way\nthat I could do anything on my own and that we can help her to\ndo that. They could not understand that responsibility. They\nnever wondered what I want to do; they did not think that I\nwould be able to do anything. He used to feel that dying was\nthe best possible option for me. (D08, 43 years, locomotor\nimpairment)\nLess extreme measures for dealing with the stigmatizing\neffect of having a disabled child in the family included keep-\ning her out of sight:\nI remember my father's sister . . . she was very bad. When guests\nwould come she would not let me come out, I could not meet\nthem. She would make me sit in one corner. She would not let\nme go in front of the guests so that they would not come to know\nthat there is a blind child in the house. (D01, 30 years, visual\nimpairment)\nSexual \"misbehavior,\" usually by members of the\nextended family, was not unknown and ranged from \"gaz-\ning\" to inappropriate touching. Episodes of sexual violence\noften went unreported, either because parents disregarded\nthem or because they held their daughters responsible. In\nsituations where the abuse was likely to continue, some\nwomen had felt that their only option was to leave home:\nI don't go home now. My Mama's [maternal uncle's] gaze was\nnot good. I tried to inform my mother but she just wouldn't listen\nto me. I also told my grandparents in Bombay about my Mama.\nThey told me to stay away [from him]. I haven't gone home now\nsince eighth standard. (D12, 24 years, visual impairment)\nImportantly, in the context of childhood, sexual violence\nwas constructed not only as the act itself, but also in terms of\nthe unwillingness of parents to acknowledge it:\nBy seventh or eighth standard . . . there were instances of\n[sexual] misbehavior with me [at home] around that time, but I\ncould never share. When it first happened I told my mother\nabout it, but she said that it must be my fault that it happened. So\nafter that I never told her anything . . . when someone misbehaves\nwith you and you tell your family and they don't believe you,\nthat is also violence. Both are violence: the misbehavior and the\nnot believing. (D10, 20 years, visual impairment)\nMany of the experiences in childhood continued into\nadulthood. Accounts of physical abuse and mistreatment in\nadulthood were less common, though, than other forms of\nviolence. In light of a widespread popular belief about physi-\ncal violence that \"such things happen in all families,\" the\nfocus on articulating other forms of abuse suggested that\nwomen found them equally distressing. The anticipation of\npossible physical violence, especially within the marital\nhome, the temporal nature of injuries caused by it, and the\nincomprehensibility of inflicting psychological, emotional,\nand economic violence on a wife might explain why respon-\ndents emphasized them in their narrative accounts. When\nphysical violence did occur, it was usually in a milieu of\nemotional, psychological, and economic violence.\nRespondents' constructions of their identities were influ-\nenced by social constructions of disability, their own experi-\nences of living with a physical impairment, and the attitudes\nand behavior of those they interacted with. Emotional, psy-\nchological, and physical self-violence could not be under-\nstood as isolated acts; they were as much impacts as they\nwere behaviors. Self-defeating beliefs and negative con-\nstructions of the self were common, particularly among\nwomen who had endured persistent physical or psychologi-\ncal violence. Being constantly spoken down to or treated as\ndisabled tended to lead to an internalized stigmatization of\none's own disability. Feelings about the impact of their phys-\nical impairment on their family, and being made to feel a\nburden, led some women to self-blame and a sense that \"I am\nthe problem.\" Within marriage, strategies to deal with the\npressure of bearing children, together with fears about them\ninheriting an impairment, included anticipating separation\nfrom the husband to bring up a child alone.\nAt least three respondents reported contemplating or\nattempting suicide. One was motivated by the fact that her\nfamily had considered her disability so undesirable (beside\nher gender) that her father had wanted her to die, and another\nexplained that\n. . . if I was a burden on everyone, if I was causing all my loved\nones so many problems I should just go away from the scene.\nThen I attempted to kill myself but it was my misfortune that I\nsurvived. (D08, 43 years, locomotor impairment)\nIntimate partner violence\nWomen's experiences of domestic violence included emo-\ntional and verbal insults, withholding money, threats of aban-\ndonment or physical violence, and actual physical violence.\nThey were rarely one-off occurrences and typically involved\na combination of several types of violence over a period.\nSpousal alcohol use, forced marriage, disputes with in-laws\nand the tendency for husbands to take their mothers' side,\nand suspicions of infidelity were described as key factors.\nAlthough the respondents themselves did not perceive their\ndisability as a causal factor, it was an additional dimension to\ntheir experiences of violence:\nDaruwalla et al. 5\nMy husband drinks. He never paid the rent of the house we were\nliving in. For 1 year he did not give rent and all the things in my\nhouse were taken away. I lost everything I had brought from my\nmaternal home. Is this the way to manage a married life? . . .You tell\nme, does he have no responsibility? I have been married to him for 9\nyears. I was 17 years of age. I was blind and my parents were in a\nhurry to get me married off. He is a sighted man. When he married\nme he knew I was blind. Then why did he marry me if he can't\nbehave properly towards me? (D11, 28 years, visual impairment)\nThe most vulnerable women seemed to be those who\nwere married off at an early age by parents who no longer\nwanted to take responsibility for them or were concerned\nabout their ineligibility as wives: the families of able-bodied\nmen often had strong reservations, such as a belief that the\nmarriage would fail, \"a fear of the unknown,\" or the percep-\ntion that a disabled person's home is a \"sad house.\" These\nstigmatized attitudes sometimes continued after marriage:\nRight from the beginning, she [my mother-in-law] and her\nfamily were against their son marrying a blind girl. There was no\nacceptance . . . My mother-in-law told them [her family], \"She is\nnot married to my son.\" (D11, 28 years, visual impairment)\nThe husband's authoritative role in the household was a\ncommonly described feature of marital relations, and even a\nsupportive husband \"keeps control of everything.\"\nMy husband keeps control of everything. Sometimes he will ask\nme to spend. My daughter got married. I wanted to give\nsomething to her. She wanted a pair of bangles. I said we will\ngive her. When there is a need and there is a happy occasion we\nshould give her. If we can't give at this time then what is the\npoint of having that money? I felt very bad. At that time I\ncouldn't give her anything. She spent her money. Having my\nown income I couldn't give. I felt very bad. It's a feeling of\ncomplete helplessness . . . (D03, 50 years, visual impairment)\nMinor marital conflicts, quarrels, and attempts to hurt each\nother emotionally were not usually considered violent, although\nphysical violence was more likely if a wife's behavior trans-\ngressed acceptable gender norms or caused suspicion:\n. . . He beat me up till I was bruised. He had never beaten me\nlike that before. We used to have verbal quarrels but this was\nvery bad . . . When he got suspicious of my friend he beat me up\nvery badly . . . He had never beaten me like this before. He\ndragged me out of the house and beat me. I was in a state of\npanic and shock. (D11, 28 years, visual impairment)\nViolence in the natal family\nRespondents were vulnerable to violence from natal families\nin a variety of ways. Women who had defied their family's\nwishes--for example, by marrying across religions--\ndescribed suffering psychological and physical violence,\ntypically from a father or brother. Although it was difficult to\nknow the degree to which disability might have been related\nto the violence, it was evident that gender and physical\nimpairment were used to make violent threats:\nThey started hitting me. At that time I was sitting on this slab\nwith wheels and I fell down. When I got up, they hit it again and\nit went towards the steps, but I stopped it. I would have got hurt\n. . . My youngest brother said that they could harm me more than\nthis, they would harm my child also, and told me not to complain\nto the police, they also told me that they had more strength than\nme. (D08, 43 years, locomotor impairment)\nOther forms of family violence included abandonment\nand exclusion. Women perceived the stigma associated with\ntheir impairments and the resulting social exclusion as acts\nand impacts of violence, as they caused them to be and feel\nexcluded. Similarly, women who were deprived of agency\nexperienced a reinforced sense of \"being\" disabled and feel-\nings of isolation and helplessness:\nWhen [my brother and his wife] go out they don't take me. They\nleave me back, alone [starts crying]. They just leave me and go\naway. When I tell them they say, \"We will not take you. What\nwill you do?\" There is nothing I can do. They do go away\nleaving me here . . . [They say], \"I don't like to take you out with\nme. I won't take you.\" I am alone. I don't have a choice. If I had\na choice I wouldn't live in this house. But I don't have a choice.\nAnd they make sure that I realize that. [They say] \"Aye, you are\nhandicapped. Do as I tell you. Eat what we tell you to. Live like\nwe tell you to.\" Kabool [I accept]. There is nothing I can do,\nright? When my father was alive, all of us brothers and sisters\ndid everything together. I never felt I was handicapped [crying].\nI never felt like that. But now every moment they make me feel\nthat I am handicapped. Now I have begun to feel that, yes I am\nhandicapped. (D07, 57 years, locomotor impairment)\nStigma was typically related to being ashamed of having\na disabled person in the family or being \"worried about what\npeople will say.\" Discrimination often originated from the\ncommon belief that disabled people \"don't have the capac-\nity\" to do things, or the view that, \"she is blind so she is use-\nless.\" The notion that disabled people are more prone to\naccidents led some parents--albeit with genuine concern\nto protect their daughters--to deny them the opportunity to\nlearn mobility techniques or travel by train, even if they\nexpressed a desire for independence. Exclusion from family\naffairs often continued into adulthood. Besides a feeling of\nneglect, this was interpreted as ostracism:\n[My younger brother and his family] never say, \"She is a\nmember of our family. And this is a family function so she must\nbe taken along.\" The fact that you [younger brother and his\nfamily] don't take me along means that you don't consider me\na part of your family. You neglect me . . . My brother's son came\nfrom the US. Everyone went to the hotel to eat. They did not\ntake me. Why? Because his wife told them, \"I feel ashamed of\nher.\" So everyone left me and went to the hotel.And I understood\nthat they do not consider me family. (D06, 57 years, locomotor\nimpairment)\n6 SAGE Open\nExperiences of violence from family members did not\ndepend on physical acts or overtly abusive behavior, and\nwere often more subtle:\n[My family] would never say a word, an abusive word, but they\nmade you feel like that . . . You can make out in the way someone\nwelcomes you and even if someone does not welcome you but\njust negates you. Negating you is just terrible. And then on my\nbirthday, to come and wish me happy birthday when they\nnegated me at every other time. When no one has even spoken to\nme before my birthday for 4 days, especially when my heart is\ndying to talk to you, to be loved by you, then how would I feel?\nViolence in public spaces\nPhysical challenges and perceptions of women with disability\nas defenseless made them easy targets. Verbal and physical\nsexual harassment by strangers occurred in public spaces,\ntrains, and buses. Women were vulnerable to exploitation\nbecause of their dependence on others for support and, possi-\nbly, as a result of men perceiving them as sexually available:\nHarassment happens in public. People have behaved badly [with\nme] while traveling in public transport. Or under the excuse of\nhelping me people have done weird things. Even in private\ntransport there is harassment. Recently an incident happened\nand so I remember. I took an auto to reach college and just at the\ngate of the college he [rickshaw driver] touched me here [points\nto her breasts]. (D10, 20 years, visual impairment)\nBehavior that would usually be unacceptable in public\nmight be spuriously legitimized by the need to \"help\":\n. . . In most cases, the men, they hold our hand, they run their\nfingers over us. When we tell them to hold the stick, they say\ndirectly, \"Why don't you let us hold your hand?\" . . . Then\nsometimes they touch us, put their hands around our shoulders\nwhile passing us or crossing us. They sometimes make dirty\ncomments. (D01, 30 years, visual impairment)\nViolence from society\nDiscrimination targeted specifically at disability was inherent\nin many of the respondents' narratives. Structural forms of\nviolence included inequalities in access to work opportunities\nin private or public institutions, and some respondents had\nbeen denied jobs and social support. General discriminatory\nattitudes of potential employers toward women with impair-\nments were often explained as concerns that they would not\nbe able to \"keep up\" with colleagues, would be less produc-\ntive, or would be incapable of completing the work.\nThe government departments that I have had to work with\ninitially were resistant and didn't want to take me on . . . I would\nalways be confronted with questions, \"What can you do? Why\nare you here?\" (D05, 35 years, visual impairment)\nIn the absence of accommodating environments and facil-\nities for people with disability, women were usually expected\nto manage on their own. They often felt that requests and\ncomplaints were met with indifference or were not taken as\nseriously as they would have been if they had not had an\nimpairment.\nI was searching for a job as well as pursuing some courses I\nthought would be useful. However, the response I heard from\npeople made me feel that there is no use to all my education. I\nbegan to feel that blind people have no option but to keep\nstudying all their life. Despite having education nobody wants to\ngive a job to blind people. (D01, 30 years, visual impairment)\nSome women perceived that institutional discrimination\nwas directed at their disability more than their gender:\nUsually the police are very rude and indifferent to the blind\nperson. Suppose something happens, then the police will say to\nthe blind person, \"How will you recognize a person? How can\nwe catch the person?\" (D03, 50 years, visual impairment)\nDisability was an additional layer of violence on top of\nwidespreadgenderbias,adouble-discrimination.Respondents\nfelt that people often assumed them to be incapable of doing\neveryday activities, fulfilling expected gender roles and par-\nticipating in education or work life. This perception included\nthe belief that they were \"dumb\" and not to be taken seriously.\nSome people also considered women with disability to be a\nburden, or as individuals deserving pity or sympathy:\nI think people feel that if you are a girl and you are blind, you\nhave no brains and you cannot understand anything. I mean, I\ndon't know, how do they think like this? There is no respect.\nAnd the opinion about girls is also not great to start with. Then\nthey wonder how will a girl accomplish anything? So in the\ncontext of a blind girl this factor of what will she achieve in life\nis very high. Then they say, \"Arre arre, bichari [oh, poor thing]\n. . . She looks beautiful but she is blind.\" And I feel, what is the\nconnection between looking beautiful and being blind? (D10, 20\nyears, visual impairment)\nThe impact of violence\nNaturally, physical violence led to a fear of further beatings\nand a sense of vulnerability. Social exclusion and isolation\nfrom the family, neglect, and being made to feel a \"burden\"--\n\"I am the problem\"--led to psychological and physical dis-\ntress, and more than one respondent had attempted suicide:\nI become hysterical. The thought stays in my head--it doesn't\ngo away. I keep thinking, they are neglecting me, they are\nneglecting me. My blood pressure rises. I try very hard but the\nthought doesn't leave my head. My nature is like this. I cannot\nchange it. I feel really very bad. I cannot control myself. Life is\nmiserable. Nobody is fighting for me. (D07, 57 years, locomotor\nimpairment)\nDaruwalla et al. 7\nNotions of disability that reduced women to deficiencies\nrelated to their physical impairment ran the risk that, \"one\nthen doesn't want to try, and becomes quiet and loses inter-\nest.\" These attitudes played an important role in influencing\nhow respondents viewed themselves and what they felt they\nwere and were not able to do. Although many felt that they\nwere capable of cooking and traveling alone, any negative\nself-perceptions they held were likely to be further reinforced\nby a lack of encouragement and autonomy:\nI can do everything. I can even cook. I clean. I manage myself.\nSo how can I be handicapped? Let me give you an example:\nbreakfast and tea is made in the house for everyone. The same\nbreakfast and tea is made for me. So food is made for everyone.\nThey are not handicapped but food is made for them right? Then\nwhy do they say to me that food and tea is being made for me\nbecause I am handicapped? Then it takes on a different\nimplication: that we have to do it for you because you cannot do\nit for yourself. (D07, 57 years, locomotor impairment)\nAnother effect was a reinforcement of beliefs such as \"I\nmust be disabled.\" The cumulative impact of attitudes and\nbehaviors was experienced in at least two dimensions. It was\ndetrimental to the woman's self-confidence and was likely to\nresult in a deprivation of opportunities:\n. . . Even a handicapped person has ability, and people treat\nthem in this way then a handicapped person will not want to\neven use that much ability that she has. (D08, 43 years, locomotor\nimpairment)\nResponses and Coping\nWhile some women strove to prove themselves capable, or\nto \"be like normal women,\" others restricted their mobility\nand life choices.\nIt's definitely restricting, it's limiting. There are also certain\nrestrictions and limitations that I have also imposed on myself.\nFor instance, I have not . . . even though I have gone through\nmobility training, I have not chosen to travel on my own, and so\nI still have somebody who travels with me. So it is sometimes a\nlot . . . anxiety-provoking, since I am dependent on somebody\nfor help. (D05, 35 years, visual impairment)\nThe pressure of proving oneself to be accepted and treated\nwith some degree of normality fell on the women themselves:\nIn experiences with education I decided that I have to prove\nmyself and my capabilities. Since I have a disability, I am left\nwith no option but to prove myself and I did that. So all the hard\nwork that I could do, I did, without complaining. So I coped\nfairly well with my studies. (D01, 30 years, visual impairment)\nSome women used problem-focused coping strategies to\ncarry out tasks that would usually be done by sighted people,\npartly to prove themselves. Others worked to limit their\ndistress by accepting, for example, family requests to restrict\ntheir mobility.\nMy sister-in-law says you are not supposed to take any unwanted\nrisks. That is the reason I don't go out of the house. She also says\nto avoid the risk. Till the moment it is possible to avoid the risk.\nDiscussion\nIn qualitative interviews with women with disability, the\ncommon motifs were an idea of not being accepted by their\nfamilies, childhood formation of a dependent self-image, and\nan expectation of limited achievement. Respondents' con-\nstructions of their identities were influenced by social con-\nstructions of disability, their own experiences of living with\nimpairment, and the attitudes and behavior of those they\ninteracted with. Violence was rarely one-off, and usually a\ncombination of emotional and physical abuse over time.\nStructural violence was a pervasive concern. Women's narra-\ntives were characterized by difficulties in resolving their\nidentities against concerted disapproval and internalized\nguilt.\nOne of the central findings was the complexity of the idea\nof violence. First, women who did not report physical vio-\nlence nevertheless articulated many of their experiences as\nviolence, the most obvious examples being their descriptions\nof the structural violence inherent in social norms. There is a\ntaxonomic challenge here: Is the concern of a woman with\nvisual impairment that she will not be able to complete a\nPhD--because of logistic and social challenges--a violent\nexperience? At what point does the lived experience of ineq-\nuity become violence, and is there a danger of the debate\nbecoming a competition for what counts? Second, we formed\nthe--somewhat provocative--impression that for some\nwomen, the psychological effects of nonphysical violence\nwere more pervasive. Perhaps this reflects the general tolera-\ntion for domestic violence in Indian homes (Special Cell for\nWomen and Children, 1997, n.d.). Women with disability\nwho had been physically abused nevertheless dwelt more on\nthe cognitive and emotional effects of marginalization and\non the ambiguities in their loved-ones' attitudes: physical\nassault is a nonambiguous form of communication.\nBy extension, the interconnectedness of forms of violence\ncauses problems in framing our idea of it. The ecological\nmodel had the benefit of being simple to understand, but we\nstruggled to fit women's accounts neatly within it. For exam-\nple, a suicide attempt is a clear example of self-directed vio-\nlence, but it arises from negative ideation linked with low\nself-worth, emotional violence and marginalization, and\nbroader social mores. To fail to acknowledge each of these\nlevels of violence would be to miss important contributors to\na woman's well-being. It also has implications for recom-\nmendations. Clearly, social change is necessary if we are to\nvalidate the experiences of marginalized women and prevent\n8 SAGE Open\nviolence against them: change at the level of policy, culture,\ncommunity, and familial behavior. What is more challenging\nis to decide where to put the emphasis.\nWomen with disability often felt excluded from main-\nstream activities. Growing up with impairment, many had\nbeen left out of family functions, religious festivals, sports,\nand extracurricular school activities. They had also been\nteased and had limited numbers of friends. One of the out-\ncomes of a marginalized existence was invisibility, silence\nbeing an epistemic form of violence. Women with disability\ndescribed experiences in which family members had negated\ntheir identity or existence. This negation extends to all levels,\nup to the Government, which responded only after nation-\nwide protests from disability groups that they should be\nincluded in a census and counted as citizens of India (Ghai,\nMost of the campaigns against violence have focused on\nits occurrence in the marital home. Our findings suggest that\nthe supposedly protected environment of the natal home has\noften been a site of violence. While women in general may\nbe prone to higher incidence of violence in natal homes than\ntheir male siblings, women who are seen by their families as\ndifferent from the norm have faced particular violence in an\neffort to minimize their perceived deviance. Our study shows\nthat women with disability faced violence in the form of\nneglect, control, restricted mobility, forced marriages, and\nlack of autonomy.\nConclusion\nWomen faced pressure from their natal families to conform,\nand described experiences of having to \"prove themselves\ncapable.\" Gender roles frame women's stay in their natal\nhomes as a precursor to their being given away to marital\nhomes. For women in general, and particularly for women\nfrom marginalized communities, sustained efforts to pro-\nmote independent living would go a long way in resisting\nfamily violence. Campaigns around violence and laws pro-\ntecting women from it, education and career guidance, sexu-\nality education, and housing schemes all need to be geared\ntoward equipping women to make life choices that protect\nthem from violence, live without fear of exclusion and dis-\ncrimination, and resist oppressive norms.\n"
