In humans, urate is\nexcreted as an end product while in other species it is\nfurther metabolized to allantoin. Recent studies have\nindicated that high serum uric acid concentration may\nbe an etiological factor for diabetes, hypertension, meta-\nbolic syndrome, and heart disease [1-8]. In addition to\nintake of purine-rich foods, such as certain kinds of\nmeat or seafood, fructose or fructose-containing foods\nhave been linked to increases in serum uric acid con-\ncentration as a result of excessive fructose phosphoryla-\ntion and rapid expenditure of adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP) over-yielding purines. A controversial hypothesis\nhas been recently suggested by Johnson et al [9], pur-\nporting that high fructose intake may increase serum\nuric acid concentration, leading to the development of\ndiabetes. Early intervention studies conducted by Mac-\nfructose given experimentally by ingestion or infusion\ncould induce acute increases of serum uric acid concen-\ntrations. However, other studies reported by Crapo [13],\nobserve that fructose influenced serum uric acid concen-\ntrations. Narins [22] et al. reported a mixed effect of\nfructose on serum uric acid concentration.\nThe generalization of an outcome from an experimen-\ntal nutrition trial to an individual's ordinary food con-\nsumption is complicated.

Very recently, a review\nby Livesey [23] indicated that: \"Intervention studies in\nhumans often use fructose at doses that are excessive\ncompared with amounts generally eaten by adults; such\nare not interpretable for purposes of public health policy\nin adult population.\"\nIn view of limitations and inconsistent outcomes of\nfructose-urate connection from intervention studies, we\nexamined the relationship between dietary fructose\nintakes and risk of hyperuricemia occurrence in the U.S.\nadult population with the added assessments of alcohol\nand fiber intakes. Alcohol is a known factor to raise uric\nacid levels, and fruits and vegetables (which contain sig-\nnificant levels of fiber) are associated with decreasing\nuric acid levels [24]. Therefore, alcohol and fiber intakes\nwere examined as indicators of model appropriateness.\nIt is expected that this work, utilizing a large popula-\ntion-based approach and data obtained under real-life\nsetting, can provide more understanding of the potential\nassociation between dietary fructose and uric acid con-\ncentration under typical living conditions.\nMethods\nData and subjects\nData of dietary intakes, demographics, health status, and\nblood chemistries were extracted from databases of the\nU.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-\ncally available from http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.\nhtm). NHANES is a program of studies designed to\nassess the health and nutritional status of adults and\nchildren in the United States. The study protocol of\nNHANES was approved by Research Ethics Review\nBoard of CDC National Center for Health Statistics, and\ndocumented consent was obtained from participants.\ncer, and/or heart disease were included in this analysis.\nYoung people were excluded because they are not per-\nmitted by law to consume alcohol in the U.S. Among\nthe dietary intake variables assessed (energy, protein,\ntotal fat, fructose, alcohol, fiber, vitamin C, and caffeine),\nthe intakes of fructose, alcohol, and fiber were specifi-\ncally emphasized in this work. For the dietary intake\ndata, values that did not meet the criteria of reliable\nrecall status were not used. Demographic factors used in\nthe analysis included gender, age, race, body weight sta-\ntus, and education level.\nTerm definition and subject categorization\nThe key outcome variable assessed in this work was the\nrisk of hyperuricemia. Based on CDC's definition in\ndefined a man as hyperuricemic if his uric acid concen-\ntration is > 8.4 mg/dL, and a woman as hyperuricemic if\nher uric acid concentration is > 7.5 mg/dL. Some pre-\nvious studies have defined hyperuricemia as serum uric\nacid concentration > 7 mg/dL for men and > 6 mg/dL\nfor women. However, we chose to utilize the relevant\nCDC's reference in this work because it is a nationally\nrecognized source. Dietary intake variables, which may\npotentially influence the study outcome, included energy\n(kcal, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ), protein, total fat (% of daily\nenergy), fiber (grams/1000 kcal), vitamin C, caffeine,\nadded unbound fructose (mono-saccharide fructose), all\nadded fructose (unbound + bound), and total fructose\n(added and naturally-occurring unbound fructose).\nThese variables were assigned as quartile intakes (1 to\nBecause about 3/4 of the population studied were not\nalcohol users on survey days, alcohol consumption levels\ndemographic variables, age groups were assigned as 20-\nweight status was categorized from 1 to 3 as normal\nOther (275) assigned as race 1 to 4; and education levels\nwere classified as lower than high school, high school\ndiploma, or higher than high school (level 1 to 3).\nEstimation of dietary fructose intake\nBecause of the wide distribution of fructose in foods and\nlimitations in the available data describing its content in\nthe majority of food items, it has been difficult to accu-\nrately calculate fructose intake for an individual. The\nfructose content in food items was not reported in the\nmann and colleagues [26] created a specific sugar intake\nestimation system in which fructose was included. In\nthis system, conversion factors were assigned for food\ngroups based on data of added sugar disappearance and\nnaturally-occurring sugar contents in the defined food\ngroups. Therefore, fructose intakes could be estimated\nusing these conversion factors and other relevant data.\nThis method was reliable for estimating typical fructose\nintake in a given population (intake mean); however,\nthis method would be less reliable to obtain data for an\nindividual's fructose intake because of the enormous\nvariation in fructose contents within a defined food\ngroup, such as fruits or fruit products. Thus, using this\nmethod to quantify the dietary fructose intake and its\nhttp://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16\nlink to a health or biological outcome has limitations.\nFor the current work, we developed a method to calcu-\nlate individual fructose intakes relatively accurately\n(briefly summarized in the Figure 1).\nIn our method, the Food Commodity Intake Databases\n(FCID), released by the U.S. Environmental Protection\nNutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR20), pub-\nlished on the website of USDA Agricultural Research\nService (ARS) [28] were used to document the fructose\ncontents for fructose-containing food commodities. In\ncommodities were obtained. If the nutrient database\nSR20 did not have a fructose value for a fructose-con-\ntaining commodity but had the data of its family mem-\nber, a ratio of the fructose to carbohydrates was used to\ncalculate the fructose content of the commodity. For\nexample, SR20 has the fructose content value for\noranges, but not for orange juice, thus, the ratio of fruc-\ntose to total carbohydrates of orange was used to indir-\nectly calculate the fructose content value of orange\njuice. Accordingly, naturally-occurring unbound fructose\nintake of each individual can be calculated using the\nNHANES food intake databases, Food Commodity\nFigure 1 Flow Chart for Individual Fructose Intake Calculation.\nhttp://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16\nComposition Database, and the obtained commodity\nfructose content data.\nWith the developed method, an estimation of fructose\nintake from added sugars was performed using the fol-\nlowing steps. First, added sugars were defined as dietary\nsugar/molasses from beet or cane, corn sweeteners\n(including high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-55, HFCS-\n42, and corn syrup), honey, maple sugar/syrup, and sor-\nghum syrup. These added sugars can be identified in\nfood items using the EPA food commodity composition\ndatabase. Because there are only two commodity names\ngiven to corn sweeteners (corn syrup and corn syrup for\nbaby food), the portion of free fructose in corn sweet-\neners was calculated based on the ratio of HFCS-55/\nener disappearance data [29]. The other unbound fruc-\ntose contents in molasses/syrup/honey can be obtained\nfrom the nutrient database SR20. The bound fructose\nwas defined as 50% of the sucrose from added sugars.\nAdditionally, the intakes of added fructose and total\nfructose for individuals were calculated using the data\nsets as mentioned above. The reliability of this calcula-\ntion method was validated by comparing the calculated\nfructose intake data with existing fructose intake data\n(detailed in discussion).\nStatistical analysis\nSAS software (version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) was\nutilized as the statistical evaluation tool. P value < 0.05\nwas considered as significant for statistical comparison.\ndietary data. In order to maintain consistency of data,\nmerging the three databases, descriptive statistics were\nperformed with adjustment for population weight of\nsample size. Serum uric acid concentrations, by fructose\nand fiber intake quartiles, and alcohol intake levels were\ncompared using a general linear model (GLM, with or\nwithout adjustment) with the data of the lowest intake\ngroup as reference (Dunnett control).\nA logistic regression (logit) procedure was used in the\nrisk analysis to examine potential associations of dietary\nfructose (added and total), alcohol, and fiber on hyper-\nuricemia. Hyperuricemia status (yes or no) was assigned\nas the dependent (explained/predicted) variable of the\nlogit models. Independent (explanatory) variables in the\nadjusted model included gender, age group, race, educa-\ntion levels, body weight status (normal, overweight or\nobese), dietary intake quartiles of fructose (by gram or\npercent of calories), energy (kcal/kJ), protein, total fat,\nvitamin C, fiber (grams/1000 kcal), caffeine, and alcohol\nintake level. The lower or lowest intake quartile, level,\nor category was used as reference group to obtain odds\nratios for the risk of hyperuricemia. The outcomes of\nrisk analysis (odds ratios) of fructose and fiber intake\nquartiles and alcohol intake level were reported because\nthey are the focus of this work, rather than the adjusting\nfactors. Goodness-of-fit tests were performed to recog-\nnize if the dependent variable could be satisfactorily\nexplained by the independent variables in the models.\nHigh alcohol intake is a known factor of elevating\nserum uric acid concentration; beyond using it as an\nadjustment factor, it can also be considered as an indi-\ncator of model validation. The statistical power for test-\ning the influence of total fructose and fiber intake on\nhyperuricemia risk is 87% using 2.5% as reference of\nhyperuricemia prevalence (actual rate was 2.57%), odds\nratio changing 1/2 between intake groups, and signifi-\ncant threshold (a) at 0.05; the power for alcohol intake\nis 82% using the same baseline and odds ratio increasing\nResults\nSubject characteristics and dietary intakes\n20-80 years, without diabetes, cancer, and/or heart dis-\neases, were included in this analysis.

Different mean values were\nobserved between hyperuricemic and non-hyperuricemic\nindividuals in regard to age, BMI, and intakes of energy,\nnatural and total fructose, total sugars, carbohydrates,\nfiber, fruits, and alcohol. Approximately, 42% of all\nadded sugars are fructose (bound + unbound) and\nadded fructose can be over 80% of total fructose intake.\nUric acid concentrations and hyperuricemia occurrence\nrates\nThe mean values of serum uric acid concentrations by\nfructose, alcohol, and fiber intakes are presented in\nTable 2. The data indicate no clear relationship between\nfructose intake and uric acid concentration. The higher\nfructose intake groups (by grams or percent of calories)\nhad either slightly higher or slightly lower uric acid con-\ncentration means in a random manner compared to the\ngroup in the lowest intake quartile. The higher alcohol\nintake groups (level 3 and 4) always had significantly\nhigher uric acid concentrations compared to the lowest\nintake group, with or without adjustment; while the\nhigher fiber intake groups (quartile 2, 3 and 4) had sig-\nnificantly somewhat lower uric acid concentrations com-\npared to the lowest intake group with or without\nadjustment adjusted. The associations of alcohol and\nhttp://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16\nfiber intakes with uric acid concentration also displayed\na dose-dependent tendency.\nFigure 2 indicates hyperuricemia rates by quartiles of\ndietary fructose intake. No clear trend of hyperuricemia\nrates could be noted between quartile intake groups of\nfructose that came from different forms or sources,\nbeyond subjects in quartile 1 who constantly had the\nhighest rates. In Figure 3, subjects in higher alcohol\nintakes levels (3 and 4) exhibited higher hyperuricemia\nrates; and subjects in higher fiber intake quartiles (2, 3\nand 4) had lower rates. Figure 4 depicts a clear impact\nof gender and body weight status, and a moderate influ-\nence of age, race, and education on hyperuricemia\noccurrence. Men, obese subjects, and individuals over\n50 y had significantly higher rates of hyperuricemia.\nThe risk of hyperuricemia\nUp to 13 explanatory variables were used in the logistic\nregression models to explore if fructose intake was asso-\nciated with the risk of hyperuricemia in the adult\npopulation. The outcomes of logistic regression on the 3\nforms of fructose (added unbound, all added, and total\nfructose), as well as alcohol and fiber, are reported in\nTable 3. Odds ratios (OR (95% confidence limits)), cor-\nresponding P values, and results of goodness-of-fit tests\nare included in this table. For fructose intake, subjects\nin higher intake quartiles tended to have lower risk of\nhyperuricemia compared to the lowest intake group (all\nORs < 1). Especially for total fructose intakes, a signifi-\ncantly lowered risk appeared in the unadjusted model in\nsubjects with higher total fructose intakes (OR = 0.515-\nkcal. However, the noted significances did not persist in\nthe adjusted models. Similar to previous reports, sub-\njects in the highest level of alcohol intake were over\n65% more likely to be hyperuricemic compared to those\n3). Furthermore, the highest fiber intake group was over\nTable 1 Subject Characteristics and Dietary Intakes by Hyperuricemic Status\nMeans Median SD Means Median SD\n* Zero intakes are not included; serum uric acid 1 mg/dL = 59.48 mol/L.\nhttp://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16\nP < 0.001) compared to the lowest intake group, with or\nwithout adjustment. Both of these dietary factors\ndemonstrate a dose-dependent influence on the risk of\nhyperuricemia. The effects of all other dietary variables\nexamined, including total fat, protein, vitamin C, and\ncaffeine, did not reach statistical significance, except\nthat the higher energy intakes (quartile 3 and 4) lowered\nthe risk mildly in the adjusted model.\nAmong the demographic variables, gender, age, race,\nbody weight status, and education level all had a signif-\nicant influence on hyperuricemia risk (Figure 4).\nWomen were about 58% less likely to be hyperurice-\nAdults over 50 y were more than 100% more likely to\nbe hyperuricemic compared to people  30 y, OR =\nBlack adults had about 50% higher chance of being\nedly, obese adults were at least 3-fold, and over-weight\nadults were at least 1-fold, more likely to be hyperuri-\ncemic than adults with BMI values below 25, OR =\nAdditionally, adults with the highest education level\n(above high school diploma) seemed to be at lower\nrisk than adults with the lowest education level (under\ntion, the detailed outcomes of logistic regression of\nthese variables are not reported.\nTo confirm the validity of the statistical model used,\ngoodness-of-fit tests were performed. The large P values\nindicated that the dependent variable (hyperuricemia yes\nor no) could be satisfactorily explained by the indepen-\ndent variables.\nTable 2 Serum Uric Acid Concentrations by Dietary Fructose, Alcohol, and Fiber Intakes [mean (SD), mg/dL], in Adult\nN = 9,384 By alcohol intake levels (g/day)\n*Serum uric acid 1 mg/dL = 59.48 mol/L.

Intakes of\nprotein, fat, vitamin C, and caffeine had no significant\ninfluence on the risk. Unexpectedly, subjects in the\nhighest total fructose intake group (by gram or % kcal)\nFigure 2 Hyperuricemia Rates by Fructose Intakes.

Differences in the\nserum uric acid concentrations between the fructose\nintake quartiles were very small (all under 5%). Some\nconcentration means in the groups of quartile 2, 3, or 4\nappeared to be significantly lower or higher in a random\nmanner compared to the lowest intake group (Table 2),\nand the observed concentration changes were not con-\nsistent with the outcomes from risk analysis. This result\nsuggests that clinical significance of the observed\nchanges in serum uric acid concentration is not of\nimportance.\nPreviously, Gao and colleagues [30] reported the influ-\nence of added sugar and sugar-sweetened drink intakes\n(containing both glucose and fructose) on the concen-\ntrations of serum uric acid in the adult population from\nexamine relationships specific to fructose intake. Based\non the different model conditions, subjects in the high-\nest sugar intake quartile had 3.8-6.6% elevated serum\nuric acid concentration compared to the data of subjects\nin the lowest sugar intake quartile. Those increases of\nuric acid concentration reached statistical significance.\nThis outcome appeared to be comparable to our data.\nHowever, our results from a larger sample size did not\nproduce an appreciable statistical significance for added\nfructose, either with or without adjustments. Gao et al.\ndid not report whether the slight increase of serum uric\nacid was linked with any clinical outcomes. Additionally,\nas noted by both Gao's work and ours, the means of\nuric acid concentrations in different intake quartiles of\ntotal sugar or fructose were all near the middle value of\nthe normal range. Hence, these observations indicate\nthat concentration alone might not be enough to explain\na potential influence of dietary sugars on serum uric\nacid. Gao et al also reported that higher vitamin C\nintake was associated with lower serum uric acid con-\nwork, it was noted as well that hyperuricemic subjects\nhad an obviously lower vitamin C intake mean than that\n1). However, it was not seen that higher vitamin C\nintake was associated with lower hyperuricemia risk.\nThe influence of fructose intake on risk of hyperurice-\nmia was reported by Choi et al. [32] using older\na cohort age over 50 y; grouped them by fructose\nreported a significant trend between odds ratios and\ncorresponding fructose consumption levels without\nreporting comparisons between groups and 95% confi-\ndence limits of odds ratios. Because of the differences in\nstudy subjects, categorization of fructose intake groups,\nand criteria of defining hyperuricemia, it is less mean-\ningful to compare our fructose intake outcomes with\nChoi's report.\nPreviously, the cut-off values >7 and >6 mg/dl of uric\nacid concentration were used for defining hyperuricemia\nFigure 4 Hyperuricemia Rates by Demographics. For Sex, M = males (n = 4,385), F = females (n = 4,999); for Body weight, Nor = normal (n =\nadjustment as indicated in statistical analysis.\nhttp://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16\nin certain studies. To check whether the different defini-\ntion altered our results, we ran the statistical analysis\nusing the lower cut-off reference values to define hyper-\nuricemia for men and women, respectively. The results\nobtained are very similar between the two sets of cut-off\nvalues used to define hyperuricemia, except that preva-\nlence rate was increased to 15.14% for the lower cut-off\ncompared to 2.57% for the cut-off used in the current\nwork. Table 4 shows descriptive statistics of hyperurice-\nmia prevalence by levels of fructose, alcohol and fiber\nintakes using the >7 and >6 mg/dl cut-offs. This out-\ncome is not unexpected. Logistic regression analysis also\nindicated: 1) no hyperuricemia risk increase in the\nhigher fructose intake groups, 2) significant risk increase\nin the highest alcohol intake group, and 3) significant\nrisk decrease in the highest fiber intake group,\ncompared to the other intake ends. Consequently, our\nconclusions are not changed by using either of the two\nsets of cut-off points to define hyperuricemia.\nHuman experimental or interventional studies explor-\ning the relationship between fructose administration and\nserum uric acid concentration produced inconsistent\nresults. MacDonald and colleagues noted that serum\nuric acid concentration increased about 10% within 90\nminutes after a pure fructose drink (1 g/kg BW) in nine\nhealthy young men [10], while Emmerson indicated that\nacid concentration 8-41% compared to glucose in three\nhealthy men [11]. Two fructose infusion studies (0.5 g/kg\nBW, in 8 healthy young men and 4 gout patients) also\nobserved an increase of serum uric acid levels [12,22].\nHowever, other studies did not observe increases in\nTable 3 Influence of Fructose, Alcohol, and Fiber Intakes on the Risk of Hyperuricemia in Adult Population Aged 20-80\n*Compared to the values of intake quartile1 or level 1, superscripted letter a represents P < 0.05, b represents P < 0.01, and c represents P < 0.001.\nAdjusted model = adjusted for sex, age, BMI, race, education, quartile intakes of kcal, protein, total fat, total fructose (in modeling alcohol/fiber intakes), fiber/\n1000 kcal, and vitamin C, and alcohol intake level.\nThe range of P values for tests of model Goodness of Fit was between 0.17-0.87, which indicates that dependent variable could be satisfactorily explained by\nindependent variables.\nhttp://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16\nserum uric acid concentration from fructose administra-\ntion. In the Finland Turku sugar studies, 35 healthy sub-\njects continuously ingested added fructose at a level of\nhad no appreciable increase in serum uric acid concen-\ntration or uric acid excretion [14]. Crapo et al [13]\nobserved that 2-week fructose administration at 24% of\ndaily calorie did not raise serum uric acid concentration\nand urinary excretion in 11 normal subjects. Narins and\ncolleagues reported that 5-d added fructose intake at 100\ng/d did not cause an increase of serum uric acid concen-\ntration in healthy subjects [22]. Also, Turner and collea-\ngues reported that serum uric acid was not elevated after\nhypertriglyceridemic men [15]. Likewise, the study by\nCurreri showed that infusion of 100 g fructose did not\ninduce serum uric acid increases in 20 young men [16].\nGrigoresco [21] all reported that long-term (1 to 6\nmonths) intake of added fructose at 11-18% of daily cal-\nories did not influenced serum uric acid concentrations\nin diabetic subjects. A possible explanation for the\nobserved inconsistencies in these intervention trials may\nbe differences in subjects and study protocols. Another\nimportant point is that fructose administered alone may\nproduce very different absorption, metabolism and phy-\nsiological effects compared to its co-ingestion with other\ncarbohydrates, such as glucose. A glucose co-effect was\ndocumented by Riby et al concerning fructose mal-\nabsorption [33]. In ordinary diets, fructose is rarely con-\nsumed alone. We also noted in this work that dietary\nfructose intake was allied with other sugars as indicated\nby Pearson and Spearman correlations (both r = 0.94, P\n< 0.0001, between intakes of fructose and total sugars).\nIn agreement with previous reports, high alcohol con-\nsumption (especially more than 30 g/d alcohol or 2\ndrinks/d) increased the risk of hyperuricemia by more\nthan 65% compared to adults who did not consume\nalcohol (Table 3). There are a number of publications\nthat have investigated the links between alcohol\nconsumption and serum uric acid concentration. A pro-\nposed mechanism for dietary alcohol inducing serum\nuric acid increase is related to high purine contents in\nalcoholic beverages (beer) and to alcohol metabolism\nwhich unusually causes adenosine triphosphate break\ndown to purines, as reviewed by Yamamoto [34]. The\nagreement of our work and previous studies on alcohol\nconsumption and uric acid lends credence to the validity\nof the logit model used herein.\nIn contrast, we did not find previously published lit-\nerature examining the relationship specifically between\ndietary fiber intake and hyperuricemia risk in the gen-\neral adult population. A possible mechanism of higher\nfiber intake associated with lower serum uric acid con-\ncentration and reduced hyperuricemia risk could be that\ndietary fiber inhibits purine or adenine absorption in the\ndigestive system [35]. Also, higher fiber intakes are\nusually associated with healthier diets (higher fruit and\nvegetable intake) and lifestyle.\nBeyond dietary and demographic factors, other aspects\nmay be more important in controlling serum uric acid\nconcentration. In a review by Luk and Simkin [36], it\nwas noted that inefficient excretion of uric acid, which\naccounts for >90% of hyperuricemic cases, can be the\nresult of renal insufficiency of any cause that impairs\nrenal urate clearance. It was also reported that the kid-\nney plays a dominant role in maintaining plasma urate\nlevels through the excretion process, and the normal\nfunctioning of several urate efflux transporters in kidney\nis critical for facilitating the excretion process [37,38].\nThus, normal kidney urate clearance performs a more\ndeciding role than dietary factors in hyperuricemia\ndevelopment.\nA novelty and possible weakness of this work is the\ncalculation method used to determine total fructose\nintake. Due to the lack of fructose content data for\nmany food items in the databases, this work established\na method to estimate fructose contents in added sugars\nand a method to estimate naturally-occurring fructose\ncontents in foods. Because of a lack of data for\nTable 4 Hyperuricemia rates (%) by fructose, alcohol, and fiber intakes*\nFructose intakes Intake quartiles Intake quartiles, Weighted data\nAlcohol and fiber intakes Intake level or quartile Intake level or quartile, Weighted data\n* Using uric acid concentration cut-off values, >7 and >6 mg/dl, as definitions of hyperuricemia for men and women, respectively\nhttp://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/16\nnaturally-occurring sucrose contents for most foods, the\nnaturally-occurring bound fructose from sucrose was\nnot available for analyzing individual intake. However,\nafter careful evaluation, we realized that the amount of\nunderestimated bound fructose from natural sucrose\nwas small and would be evenly distributed in the sub-\njects of each fructose intake quartiles. In the aggregate\npopulation studied, the mean intakes of total sugars,\ng/d per person, respectively. After subtracting the added\nand dairy sugars from total sugar intakes, the remainder\nwould be natural sugars in foods. Most of them, if not\nall, would be from fruits or vegetables. Thus, based on\nthe intake data of natural sucrose and total natural\nsugars from fruits and vegetables reported by USDA\nERS [39], a ratio of sucrose to total sugars was calcu-\nunderestimated naturally-occurring bound fructose was\n= 2.86 grams, at the maximum, which is about 5.6% of\ntotal fructose intake of the current study. Recently, Mar-\nriott and colleagues [40] reported estimates of typical\nfructose intake data in U.S. population using food\ngroup-specific fructose conversion factors and the same\nintake mean in the adults (age  19 y) is 44.5 g/day\n(recalculated based on the reported data by age group)\nusing an unweighted sample size. By using an\nunweighted sample size, our estimate of the total fruc-\ny). The values from the two different methods are in\nclose agreement. Moreover, Vos et al. [41] reported that\nmean of total fructose intake was 51.8 g/d (recalculated\nbased on reported data) in adults with age  19 y from\nan analysis of the NHANES-3 database (weighted sam-\nple size used). This estimate was also similar with the\nresult of our study (50.53 g/d, using weighted sample\nsize). However, the NHANES-3 data were collected\nused in our work. Based on the assessments mentioned\nabove, this newly developed method for estimating indi-\nvidual fructose intake should be reliable.\nIn conclusion, higher dietary fructose intake was not\nassociated with increased risk of hyperuricemia among\ndietary alcohol intake was associated with increased risk;\nhigher dietary fiber intake was associated with decreased\nrisk; and older individuals, males, or the obese all had\ngreater risk. Fructose administration under experimental\nconditions (by acute high-dose ingestion or intravenous\ninfusion) may produce outcomes that are variable and\nincomparable with those from fructose in ordinary diets\ncontaining other sugars when relating serum uric acid\nstatus. Beyond dietary factors, the impact of\ndemographic factors on serum uric acid concentration\nand hyperuricemia occurrence continues to merit\nattention.\nAuthors' contributions\nAll authors contributed equally to the study design and manuscript writing.\nDr. Sam Z. Sun conducted the data extraction and statistical analysis. All\nauthors read and approved the final manuscript.\nCompeting interests\nThis research was conducted by Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM).\nThe authors are employed full time by ADM. ADM is a major oilseed and\ngrain commodity processor and produces, among other products, fructose-\ncontaining sweeteners, alcohol and fiber.\nReferences\n1.
