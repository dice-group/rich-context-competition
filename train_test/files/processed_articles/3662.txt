One of the\nachievements in this field that is inextricably linked to Richards concerns stereoblindness.\nRichards experimentally discovered that about 30% of subjects, with apparently normal\nvision, lack the ability to process binocular disparities specifically in either far or near\ndepth relative to the fixation depth (Richards, 1971).\nStereoblindness has caused quite some discussion even a long time after its discovery.\nAlthough nowadays stereoblindness is replicated for a wide range of stereoscopic stimuli,\nthe experimental importance of stereoblindness is still frequently undervalued by scholars in\nstereopsis. Here it is key to appreciate that for proper studies on disparity processing, and the\nrole of stereoblindness in data interpretation, one is bound to use brief presentation\ndurations--in the order of 100 ms--to prevent fixational eye movements in depth to\ncompensate for a lack of far or near disparity sensitivity. We pronounce this brief\npresentation issue at the outset of this review because later we discuss that this is where\nresearchers can be incautious.\nNext to the issue of the role of fixational eye movements, there has been quite some\ndiscussion on the neurophysiological underpinning of stereoblindness. Richards (1970)\nsuggested that depth perception was processed by three distinct disparity detection pools: a\npool for large disparities in front of the fixation plane (i.e., near depth), for behind the\nfixation plane (far depth), and for small disparities at the fixation plane (zero depth). The\nthree-pool hypothesis was inspired by findings in colourblindness. In analogy with\ncolourblindness, Richards (1970) proposed that a genetic deficit could cause the lack of\none of the three disparity detection pools. While early neurophysiological work seemed to\nbe consistent with the three-pool hypothesis, later work, both in psychophysics and in\nneurophysiology, demonstrated that disparity processing involves a continuum of many\noverlapping disparity detectors (reviewed in Landers & Cormack, 1997). This leaves us\nwith the conundrum that, on the one hand, there is a continuum of many overlapping\ndisparity detectors, and on the other hand, many observers are blind for a complete class\nof near or far disparities.\nIn the next sections, we will review stereoblindness studies in psychophysics and\nelectrophysiology, respectively. Finally, we discuss how studies in binocular correlation\nduring a critical period for the development of stereopsis early in life can be used to\nexplain how a continuum of disparity detectors in normal stereopsis could be reconciled\nwith the finding that many observers are blind for a whole class of binocular disparity.\nPsychophysics\nRichards studied stereoblindness using a briefly flashed (80 ms) bar stimulus, ranging from\n\u00c04 to \u00fe4 disparity relative to fixation. A distribution of the subjects' (n \u00bc 75) three-\nalternative forced-choice discriminations (near, far, or on fixation) indicated that a\nconsiderable portion of the subjects perceived bars that were veridically either closer or\nbehind the fixation point, as being on fixation (Richards, 1970). Individual data are\nrepresented in Figure 1(a). Normal subjects (e.g., CR) responded correctly in almost all\ntrials for small disparities and performed above chance for larger disparities (Richards,\n1971). In contrast, about 30% of subjects were not able to perceive depth for bars either\ncloser or behind fixation (e.g., AE and MW).\n2 i-Perception\nFigure 1. Psychophysical data showing that a subset of subjects is not able to correctly perceive certain\ndisparities. (a) A three-alternative depth discrimination task shows normal subjects (CR) performing above\nchance level, and two stereoblind subjects unable to detect far (AE) and near (MW) disparity. From Richards\n(1971), with permission. (b) In a contemporary setup, van Ee and Richards (2002) showed similar results in a\ndepth estimation task. Normal subjects (E2, F1, and R2), show differing perceived magnitudes of depth and\ncorrectly interpret its sign. Stereoblind subjects fail to correctly perceive depth: not perceiving far disparity\n(R1), perceiving small disparities (\u00c01 to 1) only as in front (S2), or frequently reversing the sign of depth\n(T2). From van Ee and Richards (2002), with permission.\nDorman and van Ee 3\nTo replicate the traditional stereoblindness test using modern stimulus generation\ntechniques, van Ee and Richards (2002) developed a planar and a volumetric\nstereoblindness test. Figure 1(b) shows depth matching results from the planar test. The\ntop row displays three normal subjects, and the bottom row shows stereoblind subjects.\nSubject F1 shows good depth perception, correctly perceiving differences between small\nmagnitudes of disparity (F1, gray area). Subject R1 perceives near depth but not far\ndepth. Subject S2 does not perceive far depth, and the magnitude of perceived depth is\nsmall for near depth. Subject T2 sporadically perceives reversed depth perception.\nWe have mentioned earlier that stimulus duration is of cardinal importance. When the\nstimulus is not briefly flashed, subjects can employ fixation-in-depth strategies to mask\nstereoblindness for targets that are either in front or behind the fixation depth. A subject\nlacking near depth perception, but not far depth perception, could put their fixation closer\nthan the target, in which case a near disparity would become a far disparity and the depth of\nthe target relative to the fixation point would become visible. Data of van Ee and Richards\n(2002) show how stereoblind subjects greatly improve in performance once the stimulus is\npresented longer and eye movements were encouraged (Figure 2). However, when fixation\nwas to be kept strictly on the fixation point for the longer duration, stereoblind subjects again\nperformed poorly, as they did on the briefly presented stimulus. It can be concluded that eye\nmovements, not stimulus duration, is the critical factor in revealing stereoblindness.\nTo generalize the conventional planar bar stereoblindness test to volumetric stimuli, van\nEe and Richard (2002) exposed subjects to a flashed random array of multiple bars\nFigure 2. Correct fixation is crucial to study stereoblindness. In a depth estimation task, two stereoblind\nsubjects (different rows, E3 and N1) show incorrect depth (left panels), improving drastically with a 2000 ms\nstimulus and free eye movements (middle panels). When eye movements were restricted during the longer\nstimulus duration (right panels), performance was again poor. From van Ee and Richards (2002), with\npermission.\n4 i-Perception\nsubtending a static volume in depth. They found that stereoblind subjects were unable to\nperceive depth in this volumetric stimulus. Moreover, the planar and volumetric tests\npredicted each other's outcome. The conventional planar stereoblindness test has also been\nconducted in a more sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) stimulation set up (Kooi, Dekker,\nvan Ee, & Brouwer, 2010). In this study, a second moving monitor, reflected by a half-silvered\nmirror, was used to display the depth stimulus, while the fixation point was on a static\nmonitor. This minimized conflicting monocular depth cues, like lenticular accommodation\nor pixel size. Although the 3D display enhanced perceived depth and was reported to be more\ncomfortable, the stereoblind subjects still lacked normal depth perception, as in the previous\nstudies.\nMultiple psychophysical studies (Birch, Gwiazda, & Held, 1982; Breitmeyer, Julesz, &\nManning, Finlay, Neill, & Frost, 1987; Patterson et al., 1995; Regan, Erkelens &\nCollewijn, 1986; Schor & Wood, 1983) have reported on asymmetries in sensitivity for far\nand near disparities (see also reviews in Landers & Cormack, 1997; Mustillo, 1985; Regan,\nFrisby, Poggio, Schor, & Tyler, 1990). For example, developmental work showed that infants\ndevelop near stereopsis prior to far stereopsis (Birch et al., 1982). In the adult, it has been\nreported that there are different spatiotemporal response functions for far and near\nIn their thorough psychophysical experimental studies, Cormack, Stevenson, and Schor\n(1973) also found asymmetric sensitivity for far and near disparities. They convincingly\ndemonstrated that their experimental psychophysical results could be explained by\ndisparity processing consisting of a continuum of disparity detectors, as opposed to the\nthree-pool disparity processing (reviewed in Landers & Cormack, 1997). This work brings\nus to the neurophysiological underpinnings of stereoblindness.\nElectrophysiology\nOne reason why stereoblindness caused discussion even a long time after its discovery is the\nneurophysiological basis. The population distribution results from Richards' first experiment\nwere consistent with three-pool disparity processing. This became influential quickly but\nbecame debated in the nineties.\nAn early electrophysiological study by Poggio and Fischer (1977) adopted Richards' three-\npool theory to explain the observed selective near and far types of disparity neurons.\nAlthough at the time it was naturally to pronounce that these asymmetric responses in\ndepth coincide with Richards' theory on distinct mechanisms for far and near depth\nperception, Poggio and Fischer's results were not sufficient to convincingly validate the\npresence of only two separate mechanisms for far and near disparity. Indeed, later more\nprecise disparity processing categories were reported (Poggio, Gonzalez, & Krause, 1988).\nSince then neurophysiological results favoured a continuum of disparity sensitivity in cat\n(DeAngelis, Ohzawa, & Freeman, 1991; Freeman & Ohzawa, 1990; Ohzawa, DeAngelis, &\nrecorded hundreds of disparity selective neurons from the lower visual cortex of the awake\nmacaque. They used long duration (2000 ms) trials but were careful to explicitly verify that\nfixation was kept within the required fixation window. Their data demonstrated that disparity\nsensitive neurons subtended a continuum (Figure 3). DeAngelis and Uka (2003) used\ncomparable stimulation as Prince et al. (2002) and also found a continuum of disparity\nresponse properties in higher tier visual areas (Figure 4). These results can explain the\nDorman and van Ee 5\nproposed far- and near disparity tuned cells found by Poggio et al. as cells broadly tuned to\nlarge disparities. In a more recent awake macaque study, Anzai, Chowdhury, and DeAngelis\n(2011) found similar disparity receptive fields in motion-disparity processing areas, using\nconstant fixation, supporting a continuum.\nResults from monkey functional magnetic resonance imaging (Chen, Lu, & Roe, 2008), as\nwell as from two-photon-calcium imaging in cat (Kara & Boyd, 2009), add to the evidence\nthat disparity sensitive clusters are organized in a continuum from far to near. Chen et al.\n(2008) tested anesthetized monkey with the eyes stabilized with eye rings; in Kara and Boyd\n(2009), eye movements were assumed to be absent based upon stability of the cortical map.\nThese neurophysiology findings complement the psychophysical work reviewed in the\nprevious section. We already mentioned that psychophysical studies, while experimentally\nfinding asymmetric sensitivity for far and near disparities, demonstrated that disparity\nprocessing is reflected as a continuum (Landers & Cormack, 1997). Indeed, there is a\nconsiderable body of psychophysical modelling work that is consistent with a continuum\nin disparity tuning (Cormack et al., 1993; Landers & Cormack, 1997; Lehky & Sejnowski,\nLanders and Cormack (1997) suggested depth per se was the first component in disparity\nFigure 3. Neurons in V2 showing a continuum of responses to disparity, modelled by Gabor functions (see\nAnzai, Ohzawa, & Freeman, 1999, for details). The mean position (x axis) indicates preferred disparity, and the\nphase (y axis) determines the symmetry of the response curve. A wide range of responses can be identified,\namong which the several classes of Poggio et al. (insets). From Prince et al.

The magnitude of depth would be the second, and the third would be a\ncomputation of the sign of depth. Errors in the sign computation, then, could lead to\nstereoblindness. In a similar vein, Poggio (1995) has suggested that the three pools can\ncoexist with a continuum of disparity tuned neurons. Thus, the pools as defined by\nRichards can be responsible for a sign-error in coarse qualitative estimates of depth early\nin disparity processing. A later finding concerning phase- and position-shift disparity\ndetectors suggests, however, that disparity sensitivity is immediately sign selective and\ncontinuous (Anzai, Ohzawa, & Freeman, 1999).\nUnderlying Mechanism of Stereoblindness\nRichards' seminal psychophysical findings on stereoblindness were well in line with a study\non binocular development in kittens with artificially induced squint (Hubel & Wiesel, 1965).\nFigure 4. Neurons in MT show a continuum of responses to disparities, much as in V2. From DeAngelis and\nDorman and van Ee 7\nHubel and Wiesel reported that these kittens lacked binocular neurons, attributed to a lack of\nbinocular correlation during the critical period for the development of stereopsis. In support,\nMovshon, Chambers, and Blakemore (1972) and Mitchell and Ware (1974) have reported\nthat stereoblind subjects show a dramatic reduction in the extent of interocular transfer,\nattributed to the lack of binocular neurons. Jones (1977) studied oculomotor responses in\n30 individuals and reported that the presence of vergence anomaly was always associated\nwith the occurrence of stereoblindness. We interpret Jones' findings as that stereoblindness\ncould be caused by a disability in making correct fixational eye movements in depth early in\nlife, in turn, causing a lack of exposure to binocular correlation during the critical period for\nthe development of stereopsis.\nIt has been suggested that stereoblindness can also have a different origin. For example, it\nmay be possible that the lack of binocular neurons may be genetically endowed. Congenital\nanomalies of visual cortical physiology are in fact known to occur in some animals of which the\nSiamese cat provides the best-known example (Cool & Crawford, 1972; Hubel & Wiesel, 1971).\nFinally, we speculate about a mechanism based on misrouting in the optic chiasm. In the\noptic chiasm, axons from the temporal hemiretinae traverse to the ipsilateral cortex, and axons\nfrom the nasal hemiretinae decussate, to end in the contralateral visual cortex. For a central\nstimulus, a near stimulus lands on both temporal hemiretinae, and a far stimulus lands on both\nnasal retinae (Figure 5(a)). Chiasmatic misrouting has been identified in several conditions. In\nhuman albinism and Siamese cats, the temporal hemiretinae erroneously decussates to end in\nthe contralateral hemisphere (Hoffmann, Tolhurst, Moore, & Morland, 2003; Kalil, Jhaveri,\n& Richards, 1971; Figure 5(b)). Likewise, in achiasmatic syndrome, there is no decussation of\nthe nasal hemiretinae (Apkarian, Bour, Barth, Wenniger-Prick, & Verbeeten, 1995; Figure\n5(c)). These conditions would leave one side of the hemiretinae to be processed normally, while\nthe affected hemiretinae ends in the wrong hemisphere. In such cases, one depth sign could be\nprocessed normally, while the other is misrouted, and thus impaired. Indeed, chiasmatic\nmisrouting shows defective stereopsis (Prieur & Rebsam, 2016), but, unfortunately a\ndifferentiation between far or near sensitivity in albinism or achiasmatic syndrome has not\nFigure 5.

Note how the different depth stimuli fall on the hemiretinae and the\ncorresponding hemisphere. (a) Illustration of the normal situation.

It is interesting to consider to what extent it may cause an asymmetry\nbetween near and far disparity sensitivity.\nDiscussion\nScholars performing stereopsis experiments know from experience that there is a considerable\nnumber of subjects who is unable to perceive depth from a whole class of disparities either in\nfront or behind fixation. Indeed, a significant portion (estimated by Richards [1970] at 30%)\nof the population exhibits anomalous behaviour in stereoblindness tests.\nJust as the use of colourblind subjects in colour-vision studies has advanced our\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanisms of colour processing, it was Richards' hope that\nthe wider use of stereoblindness tests would give us fundamental insights into the underlying\nmechanisms of disparity processing. Inspired by this line of thought, van Ee (2003) investigated\nto what extent binocular matching is facilitated by motion in both stereoblind and normal\nsubjects when they are required to estimate the perceived depth of a 3D stimulus that contains\nexcessive binocular matching candidates (van Ee & Anderson, 2001). The volumetric\nstereoblindness test (van Ee & Richards, 2002) was developed to bridge Richards' traditional\nplanar stereoblindness test to 3D scenes. The main learning from the experimental study of van\nEe (2003) is that interindividual subject differences in the 3D stereoscopic matching task (the\nextent to which binocular matching is facilitated by motion) can be explained by the subjects'\nperformance in the volumetric stereoblindness test. Without the results of the stereoblindness\ntest, the results reported in van Ee (2003) would not have made sense.\nConsidering that a host of perceptual properties are found to be correlated with an\nasymmetry in near and far disparity processing (reviewed in Mustillo, 1985; Regan et al.,\n1990), it is surprising that tests for depth perception with stimuli of varying disparity have not\nroutinely been used as a basis for correlating individual differences in stereoscopic\ninformation processing. A possible reason is that stereoblindness has been regarded as a\ntransient phenomenon that shows up only when targets are presented for a short duration\n(Newhouse & Uttal, 1982). However, in Newhouse and Uttal's experiment, the observation\nperiod was 2 minutes, and eye movements were unrestricted, which enabled the subject to put\na near stimulus in the far region (and vice versa) to mask stereoblindness. This means that\ntheir experiment did not test stereoblindness. The results in Figure 2 indicate that eye\nmovement, not stimulus duration, is the critical factor in revealing stereoblindness.\nConcerning contemporary research, McIntire et al. (2014) investigated the effect of varying\ndisparity on task performance for a virtual object precision placement task while viewing a\nstereoscopic display. The authors concluded that ``clinically normal stereopsis does not\nensure a performance benefit from stereoscopic 3D depth cues.'' However, what they call\nclinically normal stereopsis was validated by the ``Titmus stereovision test,'' assessment of\nphoria, and vergence, which cannot confirm that their subjects were not stereoblind, affecting\ntheir conclusion. Indeed, some subjects, who passed the stereovision test, showed atypical\nresponses. Bosten et al. (2015) set out to conduct a population study of binocular function in\n1,060 participants, in which they, among many other visual functions, assessed near and far\ndisparity sensitivity. However, to assess stereovision they used the TNO stereo test in which\nsubjects are not restricted in making eye movements meaning that, again, a subset of their\nsubjects may have been stereoblind, again most probably affecting their conclusion.\nOther recent work addressed human functional magnetic resonance imaging in human\n(Goncalves et al., 2015). They used a presentation duration of 1 second, and eye\nmovements were not recorded; it is unclear how they objectively assessed the stereo\nabilities of their subjects. Similarly, another recent functional magnetic resonance imaging\nDorman and van Ee 9\nstudy (Nasr, Polimeni, & Tootell, 2016) examined activity in V2 and V3 to a mixture of far\nand near disparities. Without the results of the stereoblindness test, the results reported in\nthese articles must be qualified. If the authors would have mapped performance in a proper\nstereoblindness test, interpretations would have been more convincing.\nAfter 50 years of stereoblindness, there is still an open conundrum: How can the established\nfinding that disparity is processed by a continuum of detectors be reconciled with the disability\nof many observers to process a whole class of far or near disparities? We propose, based upon\nintegration of literature, that an asymmetry between far and near disparity detection at\nbirth--possibly being present for a variety of reasons--can suppress the typical formation of\nbinocular correlation during the critical period for the development of stereopsis early in life,\nthereby disabling a whole class of far or near disparities. This proposal is in line with the above\nreviewed findings: Hubel and Wiesel (1965) reported that kittens with artificially induced squint\nlacked binocular neurons, attributed to a lack of binocular correlation during the critical period\nfor the development of stereopsis. In addition, Jones' (1977) findings can be interpreted that\nstereoblindness could be caused by a disability to make correct fixational eye movements in\ndepth early in life, in turn, causing a lack of exposure to binocular correlation during the critical\nperiod for the development of stereopsis. Moreover, a twin study has found that strabismus has\na genetic aetiology (Wilmer & Backus, 2009). People with inherited strabismus have an\nasymmetric and unbalanced use of near and far disparities. This asymmetry may lead to a\npredominance of eye postures that enable the processing of far disparities more than the\nprocessing of near disparities, or vice versa. Thus, an asymmetry between far and near\ndisparity detection at birth can naturally lead to suboptimal routine oculomotor behaviour\nthat suppresses the typical formation of binocular correlation during the critical period in the\ndevelopment of stereopsis for a whole class of far or near disparities. Next to strabismus (that\ncan still lead to the formation of binocular neurons if properly dealt with), there may be more\nsevere genetic deficits: Retinal axon guidance involves a complex genetic pathway (Prieur &\nRebsam, 2016), and retinal axon guidance defects have been frequently displayed in zebrafish\n(Hutson & Chien, 2002). Genetic defects influencing development of the human optic tract are,\nthus, not unlikely. Such genetic predisposition may lead to a failure to develop binocular\nneurons and may cause stereoblindness. In conclusion, an asymmetry between far and near\ndisparity detection during the critical period in the development of stereopsis can cause\nsuppression of a whole class of far or near disparities.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: RvE was supported by the EU HealthPac grant (awarded to J. van Opstal),\nby the Methusalem program of the Flemish Government (METH/14/02), awarded to J.

This research is focussed\non the neural correlates of multisensory percepts. His background\nincludes a BSc Biology and a MSc Medical biology with a\nNeuroscience specialization, both at the Radboud University\nNijmegen. During his studies he performed work at the\nDonders Institute.\nRaymond van Ee has a BA and a MSc in Physics and Astronomy,\nand a PhD in in Neuro- and Psycho-Physics, working with Casper\nErkelens at Utrecht University. He then worked with Marty\nBanks and Cliff Schor at UC Berkeley for about 4 years.\nAfterwards he worked with Bart Anderson at MIT and he got\nthe privilege to work with Whitman Richards to whom this paper\nis devoted after Whitman died within a year ago. Current research\ninterests combine his previous work on Rhythmically Congruent\nMultisensory Stimulation, Stereopsis, Brain Imaging, and\nAttentional Control in order to create novel neuronal pathways\nfor patients after Stroke, Cerebral Paresis and Traumatic Brain Injury. To do so he is an\ninventor at Philips Research, and a part-time full professor at Leuven University and the\nDonders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour in Nijmegen.\nDorman and van Ee 13"
