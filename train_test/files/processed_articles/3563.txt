    "abstract": "Abstract\nDropout from substance use disorder treatment is usually investigated and understood\nfrom a perspective of quantitative patient-related factors. Patients' own perspectives\n(user perspective) are rarely reported. This study, therefore, aimed to explore patients'\nown understanding of their dropout from residential substance use disorder treatment.\nThe participants were 15 males and females, aged 19\u00ad29 years, who had dropped out of\nresidential substance use disorder treatment at the Department of Addiction\nTreatment, Oslo University Hospital, Norway. Qualitative methodology with semistruc-\ntured interviews was used to explore how the participants described their dropout and\ntheir reasons for doing so. Thematic analysis was used as the framework for analyzing\nthe data derived from the interviews. Dropout had different meanings for different\nparticipants. It was understood as a break from treatment, as an end to treatment, or\nas a means of reduced treatment intensity. Against that background, four main themes for\ndropout were found: drug craving, negative emotions, personal contact, and activity. Patient\nand treatment factors seem to interact when participants explore reasons for their\ndropout. A complex pattern of variables is involved. As remedies, participants suggested\nthat substance use disorder treatment should provide more focus on drug craving and\ntraining to understand and tolerate emotional discomfort.

Best treatment results are obtained by patients who remain\nin treatment longer and patients who complete the treatment (Beynon et al., 2008;\nleading to treatment dropout and identifying possible causal mechanisms can\nenhance the treatment effect (Lambert et al., 2004).\nStark's (1992) literature review examined how factors such as age, sex, drug\nuse, and socioeconomic status influenced treatment dropout. None was con-\nsistently associated with dropout. However, he did find that patients who perceived\ntheir addiction as serious, patients with higher expectations of improvement,\nand patients with greater confidence that they would attain the treatment\ndemands remained in treatment longer. Brorson et al. (2013) found that the last\ntwo decades of research on dropout from SUD treatment have primarily been\nconcerned with patient factors. Few studies have looked at factors associated\nwith the treatment program such as treatment length, treatment ideology,\npatient/employee ratio, or interacting treatment factors. In addition, few studies\nhave assessed the therapeutic relationship in SUD treatment (Kothari et al., 2010).\nThis is in contrast to research indicating that the quality of the therapeutic rela-\ntionship is among the strongest of predictors of both treatment outcome (Lambert\nIn sum, the research on patient factors does not provide consistent answers\nabout how potential treatment dropout can be identified and rates reduced.\nFurther, the user perspective has rarely been explored in the SUD field (Ball\nto investigate the reasons young adults give for dropping out of residential SUD\ntreatment.\nMethods\nThe study was part of the Youth Addiction Treatment Evaluation Project (YATEP).\nYATEP was approved by the Norwegian Data Protection Official for Research, the\nNorwegian Regional Committees for Medical Research Ethics (REK), and the Oslo\nUniversity Hospital Human Subjects Subcommittee. This study was reviewed and\ntheir guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration (1975). Signed informed consent, both\nfor YATEP and for this specific study, was obtained from all the participants.\nTreatment site\nThe Department of Addiction Treatment--Youth at Oslo University Hospital (OUS)\nis part of the specialist health care under Norway's public health system. SUD patients\nhave equal rights to treatment. This is the case for all patient groups under Norwegian\nhealth care. It offers different levels of treatment and assessment to young adults with\nproblems related to substance misuse. Patients are referred by the municipal social\nservices, general practitioners, specialists, or by another hospital department. These\npatients have a primary diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorders due to psycho-\nactive substance use (ICD 10) and additional comorbidity is common.\nTreatment is a person-centered program that comprises individual and group\ntherapy based on a biopsychosocial model with emphasis on mentalization-based\ntheory and practice (Ska\n\u00b0 rderud and Sommerfeldt, 2013). Psychological treatment is\nprovided according to the individual's specific problems and treatment goals.\nMedical treatment is offered, plus assistance/counseling on accommodation, edu-\ncation, employment and posttreatment living, adjustment, and support. Patients in\nresidence spend their time, according to their treatment plan, in individual or group\nwork, therapy, designated tasks (such as caring for horses), and structured or\nunstructured recreational activities. Every patient is given a primary contact\nwhen starting treatment, usually a social worker or a nurse who is required to\nspend most of their time in the milieu with the patients. The likely duration of\ntreatment (3\u00ad12 months) is decided with the patient as part of the treatment plan.\nThe treatment site is located 15 min from the center of Oslo, in a rural-like\nsetting. At the on-site stables, professional staff with relevant qualifications offers\nhorse-assisted therapy as an integral part of the SUD treatment program (Kern-\nAt the time of the study (January and February 2012), the Department of\nAddiction Treatment--Youth was in the early stages of an organizational\nchange involving harmonizing treatment methods in two different units, downsiz-\ning, reduction in treatment duration, and consequent staff changes.\nParticipants\nThe participants were selected from a pool of patients who had dropped out\nof SUD treatment at the Department of Addiction Treatment at OUS.\nThe background information was collected from the electronic hospital records.\n(mean 23.5 years). All participants had mental and behavioral disorders due to\n11 of the 15 participants had one or more additional comorbid psychiatric diag-\nnoses (four with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, three with posttraumatic\nstress disorder, three with mood disorders (depression and/or anxiety), and one\npersonality disorder). At the time of admission to the treatment site, seven of the 15\nparticipants had been diagnosed with three or more different SUDs (ICD-10;\nF10.2\u00adF19.2). Limiting the maximum to three diagnoses for the seven multidrug\nindividuals, the 15 participants had 30 SUD diagnoses in total (three multiple drug\nuse (F19.2), eight cannabinoids, seven stimulants (including cocaine), six sedatives,\nfour opioids, and two alcohol).\nFive participants had not previously received residential SUD treatment and 10\nhad one or more previous SUD treatment experience(s). The average time at the\ntreatment site before dropout was close to 10 weeks (range 2\u00ad40 weeks). The par-\nticipants had dropped out of voluntary SUD treatment; none were under manda-\ntory court or legislative sanction during the study.\nData collection\nThe inclusion criterion for study enrollment was dropout from residential treat-\nment for a minimum of one week to a maximum of six months. Patients who left\ntreatment on their own initiative before planned treatment completion and failed to\nreturn within one week were eligible for study participation.\nWithin the time period of the data collection (January and February 2012), a\ntotal of 26 participants were eligible according to the inclusion criteria. We were\nunable to contact 10 of the potential participants, and one declined to participate.\nThe remaining 15 agreed to participate and were included in this study.\nThe study site was chosen because four of the authors worked at the site, were\nfamiliar with the treatment method and processes, had access to the information\nsystems and shared a concern about the patient dropout rate of about 60% of\nSix of the participants had dropped out of treatment for more than a week and\nthen returned to the treatment site. Nine dropped out of treatment and did not\nreturn. They were contacted by telephone and given information about the purpose\nof the study. They were told that participation was voluntary, that all the infor-\nmation collected would be treated confidentially and published anonymously, and\nthat they would be compensated for the interview with a NOK 500 (USD 80)\nelectronic gift card. Participants were interviewed at home or at a neutral site\nnearby. The six who had returned to residential treatment following dropout\nwere given the same written and verbal information about the study by their\nappointed clinical contact person. Prior to the interview, all participants signed\nan additional consent form giving the researchers permission to audio record the\ninterviews. The participants were reminded that participation was voluntary and\nthat they could terminate the interview at any time.\nThe interview\nWe chose qualitative as the preferred methodology at this stage to explore a largely\nuncharted and challenging aspect of SUD treatment (Patton, 2015). We used a\nsemistructured interview with open-ended questions focused around four main\ntopics: ``Current life situation,'' ``Reasons for seeking treatment,'' ``Dropout\nfrom treatment,'' and ``What could have been done differently in treatment to\nprevent dropout.'' The six participants who were back in treatment were in add-\nition asked about what made them come back to treatment, and what they now\nneeded to complete the treatment program. The questions were compiled based on\nprevious SUD treatment research, especially those studies calling for a better\nunderstanding of dropout in terms of program-related factors (Brorson et al.,\n2013), more knowledge about the therapeutic relationship (Kothari et al., 2010),\nand focus on the user perspective (Laudet et al., 2009). The authors met regularly\nduring development of the questions and the interview guide. KN and SA divided\nthe interviews between them, each of which lasted between 17 and 68 min (average\n28 min). At the end of the interview, all participants were given their interviewer's\ncontact information. The two interviewers each transcribed their own interviews\nduring the data collection, which enabled them to check the quality of the data\n(Hennink et al., 2011). KN then reviewed all the recordings and transcriptions to\nfamiliarize himself with all participants, to ensure transcription accuracy and to\nData analyses\nThe transcribed data were investigated using Braun and Clarke's (2006) six-step\nthematic analysis, a flexible and a useful tool to examine rich and detailed data. All\nsentences with relevant meaning were reviewed and coded by KN. During the\nanalytical phase, the authors met to discuss the different codes and thematic\nlabels in the data to prevent subjective bias (Elliott et al., 1999). A combination\nof inductive and deductive codes was developed throughout the analysis (Hennink\net al., 2011). This approach was divided into three phases. The first phase used a\ndeductive approach to generate codes from the research literature. The second\nphase used an inductive approach to recode with a focus on issues raised by the\nparticipants themselves. The last phase used a theme labeling approach to compare\nand merge the two sets of codes into a single set of codes. For example: in phase 1,\nduring the first search for codes, we identified ``negative affect'' as a code, closely\nrelated to the research literature. In phase 2, we found that the participants talked\nabout their struggle concerning difficult emotions, but none used the word ``affect''\nto describe their inner state. In phase 3, as the intention of the study was to explore\nthe users' perspectives, we named this theme ``negative emotions.''\nNorwegian was used in the interviews, transcriptions, coding, and selection of\nquotations. All quotations were subsequently translated to English by KN and\nEW, and pseudonyms were used for all participants. An oral presentation of the\nfindings of the identified themes was made to the staff at the treatment site in order\nResults\nDropout was found to have different meanings for different participants. For some\nit was understood as a break from treatment, with Live (19 years) describing her\ndropout as a self-initiated break:\nSometimes one just has to get out to think. Not necessarily to use drugs but kind of\njust get a little distance from the whole place. Because you live so close to others, so\nfinally it's too much . . . if you are not able to get out, at least in the period of\nquarantine.\nOther participants understood their dropout as an end to treatment, not having\nreceived what they needed from treatment, like Erik (28 years): ``I wanted to get\ncloser to my family, to find a job, I wanted to start school, everything that\nlife contains, that I couldn't do while being there.'' Finally, it could also be\nunderstood as a means of reduced treatment intensity. Despite not returning to\nresidential treatment, three participants maintained contact with the treatment\nsite through meetings with their psychologist or former primary contact. In\nthe words of Jeanne (21 years): ``I got to retain my psychologist. I told them\nthat it is very important to me that I have a psychologist I have a good rela-\ntionship with, so it's been arranged for me to continue the psychotherapy.''\nAnalysis of the reasons for dropping out of treatment identified four main\nthemes from the interviews: drug craving, negative emotions, personal contact,\nand activity. These are presented below. A subtheme, treatment remedies,\naddresses the changes that participants felt could have induced them to remain\nin treatment longer.\nDrug craving\nMany participants reported situations related to drugs or drug craving as a trig-\ngering factor to treatment dropout, like Afzal (19 years): ``It was not intentional to\ndrop out. What should I say . . . I wanted to get wasted, but not here at (the treat-\nment site) or take drugs into (the treatment site), so I left instead.'' Aslak (23 years)\nterminated SUD treatment because he wanted to get home to his family but also to\nhis hashish pipe. For some, the desire to take drugs came and went in waves.\nMagnus (26 years) explained that following a month or two of daily drug use,\nhe felt disappointed and like a failure. Bad conscience would emerge together\nwith an increased motivation to quit drug use. The opposite was equally true,\nfollowing a period of abstinence the drug craving would return. This periodic\ncraving for drugs was the reason he gave for leaving the SUD treatment.\nHedda (27 years) described how she awoke every morning and reached for the\n``ready-made fix'' on the nightstand. She continued to reach for the nightstand\nwhile in SUD treatment. She described a drug craving that depleted her energy\nand concentration. It took a lot of effort to get rid of these thoughts and when the\ncraving emerged, she said she felt it as a physical activation.\nNegative emotions\nThe interviews revealed that many of the participants struggled with difficult emo-\ntions that they found hard to control. Participants related treatment dropout to\nfeelings or emotional states. For some, this could be specific present events while\nfor others it was triggered by past events. For example, like Trym (21 years)\ndescribed:\nI'm a man, right? One should not show feelings, not be alone, not cry or any of\nthat--right? And when I have the opportunity to hide and not show it to anyone,\nI do that. (. . .). It was not like I was going out to get high; it was just--now I leave.\nI don't know why. It was an impulsive act (. . .). I was unable to deal with the feelings\nafter the breakup.\nBy quitting drugs, Lars (28 years) became more aware of all the other problems he\nhad. Getting high had previously been a coping strategy but with abstinence, he\nexperienced grief:\n. . . had a heartbreak that has lasted almost to this day. I was with her for four years\nand it ended because I couldn't stop getting high. I recognize that I didn't grieve\nbecause of my relapses; still it (the pain) doesn't quite go away. So there is pain,\nbut I'm not going to give up (trying to recover).\nIn contrast to looking at drugs as a way to escape painful feelings, Live (19 years)\ndescribed an empty and emotionally stunted feeling from drugs. She thought it was\nstrange not to have any feelings associated with everything that had happened to\nher during the time she was ``wasted.'' Several participants described drugs as a\nway to regulate themselves, as a way to self-medicate, as illustrated in the words of\nJakob (23 years): ``You just realize that you are an addict in a bad and dark way\nand it is not particularly attractive. To deal with it I had to go on heavy drugs to\navoid thinking about that.''\nPersonal contact\nSome participants reported situations where lack of contact with the staff was a\ncontributing factor to treatment dropout. Erik (28 years) experienced that the staff\nwere absent from the ``day-to-day milieu,'' so they hardly ever saw what was going\non. He found 2 h with his primary contact per week to be insufficient. Also Hedda\n(27 years) pointed out that she had too much time to herself:\nI started to get really depressed. I felt I got angry, a lot of anger came up, and\nI felt I couldn't deal with having people around, so I was put in the (semi-\nisolation) unit. Consequently, there was little contact with the staff, which gave\nme too much time on my own . . . then I met this other guy from another unit,\nwho sold me heroin (. . .). I was forgotten, like out of sight, out of mind. That's\nhow it was.\nBrage (24 years) had expectations that were not fulfilled by the staff:\nHe (the primary contact) told me that I should take a break from the treatment\nand come back in a month; meanwhile I would receive counseling from a psycholo-\ngist (at the treatment site). I was not contacted once by the psychologist. I feel cheated\nout of an opportunity; I feel they didn't try as hard with me as they did with the\nothers.\nThe treatment site was going through a period of reorganization and this became a\ntheme among the participants, as Sigve (23 years) described:\nThe relationship with the patients has changed a lot since the new system was intro-\nduced. It's become very different, for better and for worse. You have to stand up more\nfor yourself, but for me, I needed it to be like it was when I first got here. I felt more\nsupport from the community/fellowship back then.\nJeanne (21 years) experienced the reorganization as reducing the treatment quality:\n``The reorganization with lots of cutbacks made things very much reduced.\nThe treatment was reduced, the food worse, with less dedicated (staff) time\nwith the individual patient.''\nActivity\nThe absence of activity and the importance of having something to do during\nresidential SUD treatment were raised by many participants, in Erik's (28 years)\nwords: ``There were so many things I wanted to do on the outside (away from the\ntreatment site) that I could not do. I mean positive things I wanted to continue\n(hobbies), and to do recreational activities.'' Jakob (23 years) felt that he became\nlazy and had nothing to do during the day:\nIn the beginning I did very well, I worked as a volunteer in a company nearby, but\nthen I started to not give a damn about anything, sleep late into the day, which started\na really bad pattern. That became the beginning of things slipping.\nSome participants, like Aslak (23 years), mentioned the lack of opportunities for\nphysical exercise: ``I really liked the work in the stables. Having something to do,\nusing the body. For instance, we could have had some duties, also physical activity,\nso that we could move around a bit, getting exhausted.''\nTreatment remedies: What could have induced participants to\nstay longer in treatment?\nTrym (21 years) wished that the staff would take on a kind of ``parental'' role in\norder to teach him what emotions were. He pointed out that having ``drugged\naway'' much of his life, he had not learned this when he was young:\nI believe there should be a system that makes it impossible to dodge (emotional\nfeeling). It must be caring and loving and it must be set up to educate about how\nmany pleasures there are in life, or how many nice things are around you that you\ndon't see because either you have it too good or you have it too bad. In between best\nand worst there's a massive range of different emotions that you get from different\nthings. And that's what we lose when we get high, right? So simply learn how to feel\nemotions. And like it, of course.\nMany of the participants said closer contact with the staff combined with more\ntrust and understanding would make them stay in treatment longer. They also\nstressed the need for more activities, like Jeanne (21 years): ``They have to get\npeople out, must somehow get people to do something that gives them pleasure,\nsomething you can do without using drugs.'' Thomas (29 years) said the only thing\nhe looked forward to during the week was the one day they went to the stables and\nto be with the horses.\nJakob (23 years) was clear about the need to do something healthy following the\nresidential treatment. So he had an agreement with the day treatment unit and the\npolyclinic (to attend the stables) for follow-up, while living independently. He was\nconfident this would give him the starting point he needed to make it on his own.\nLars (28 years) also stressed the importance of postcare and follow-up. He experi-\nenced ``being completely free'' after ending residential treatment. This meant that\nhe was all alone, and loneliness was something he had never been able to deal with.\nTo avoid this, he asked the treatment site if he could be readmitted as a backup\nplan. This safeguarded him and made it less difficult to deal with the life challenges\nhe faced.\nDiscussion\nThe study findings fall into two related categories: the meaning of dropout and\nreasons for dropping out. As seen from the participants' perspective, both appear\nto have important implications for SUD treatment. Neither has been adequately\nstudied or reported to date.\nParticipants understood dropout as a break from treatment, an end to treat-\nment, or reduced treatment intensity. In this study, dropout did not mean that\npatients would not return to residential treatment. Nine of the 15 participants were\neither back in residence at the Department of Addiction Treatment--Youth or\nwere engaged in nonresidential, reduced intensity treatment. Behavior we initially\nperceived as dropout from treatment is now understood, among more than half of\nour study population, as a patient-initiated break from treatment.\nThe consequences of dropout are not always negative (Stark, 1992) and should\nbe framed when possible as a learning experience instead of as defeat (Saarnio and\nKnuuttila, 2003). Most of the participants reported having gained something\nduring treatment, irrespective of whether they reentered treatment following drop-\nout. They reported a greater tolerance for difficult feelings and an increased ability\nto share difficult feelings with others. They also acknowledged that SUD treatment\nwas better than the alternative. It is possible that participants' increased awareness\nof their emotional state prompted their requests for more personal support both\nduring and following residential treatment.\nFour themes emerged as to why the 15 participants we interviewed took a break\nor dropped out of residential SUD treatment. It is difficult to see these themes\n(drug craving, negative emotions, personal contact, and activity) as completely\nseparate from each other. Similarly, external factors such as family issues are\noften important and influential patient variables. Drug craving is described as a\nperiodic craving, a yearning for what also constituted a way to regulate oneself.\nDrugs were used to regulate difficult emotions, and participants mentioned an\nincrease in drug use and the use of harder drugs following SUD treatment to\ndull the awareness of their earlier wrongdoings and misfortunes in life. Being\nabstinent over time during SUD treatment provided insight into issues that had\nled many participants to take drugs in order to avoid thinking about them. This is\nrelevant to studies reporting that risk of substance abuse relapse (Brownell et al.,\nhighest in the first months after SUD treatment. Substance abuse and emotional\ndifficulties were interconnected for these participants. Drug abuse was reported as a\ncommon way to avoid having to deal with their negative emotions. This was sup-\nported by the request to ``be educated on what emotions are'' as a part of SUD\ntreatment. It is consistent with research findings which indicate that deficits in\ncoping with negative affect are an important factor in SUD treatment (Berking\nThe participants called for closer monitoring by, and personal contact with, the\ntreatment site staff. They wanted more time with their psychologist and primary\ncontact. They also needed more time to build trust. Positive treatment outcomes\nhave been associated with continuity in the alliance with the therapist while strug-\ngling with difficult emotions of discontinuity (Binder et al., 2009). Positive treat-\nment outcomes have also been associated with continuity and follow-up in the form\nof a positive relationship with the therapist and regular appointments (Alverson\net al., 2000). Continuity of care is important for providing a sense of security\nand hope. It is consistent with findings that patients with a low degree of attach-\nment and identification with the treatment program, co-tenants, and staff, are more\nlikely to drop out of treatment (Ravndal and Vaglum, 1994). In Norway, patients\nexiting residential treatment are referred to their local health and social welfare\nservice for follow-up and, if necessary, community-based treatment. This process\nbreaks continuity of care at precisely the time when many recovering SUD patients\nare most vulnerable and may struggle to establish good therapeutic contact with a\nnew therapist or team.\nWorking with SUD patients requires patience on the part of staff because it is\ntime consuming and most patients will relapse (Sellman, 2010). A follow-up study\nof adolescents with SUD found a relapse rate higher than 90% (Spear et al., 1999).\nDennis et al. (2005) found that the median time from first SUD treatment to\npatients' achieving one year of abstinence was nine years. Relapse can be viewed\nas a part of the SUD treatment process, rather than a termination of treatment\n(Rahill et al., 2009; White et al., 2005). This form of testing boundaries, with a\nbreak from therapy (with or without substance abuse), may be considered a small\nstep towards behavioral change. The fragile attachment must be built up over time\nwith continuity, safety, and predictability. A Norwegian study found that incon-\nsistent responses from the staff following dropout was reported by the patients to\nbe the most negative aspect of the SUD treatment (Nordfjaern et al., 2010).\nOur study was conducted during the early stages of a treatment site reorganiza-\ntion and downsizing, which was generally perceived by participants to have had a\nnegative effect on their treatment. They expressed concern about the continual\nchange in rules and procedures resulting from the reorganization. They said their\ntreatment and the site became less safe, less predictable, and that these changes had\na negative impact on their relationships with the staff and fellow patients.\nContinuity is important for successful therapy (Alverson et al., 2000; Binder\net al., 2009). We are unaware of other reported studies of the impact of organiza-\ntional change on SUD staff or patients. Norway's labor laws provide staff employ-\nment security. They have mandatory staff reallocation procedures that can lead to\nprotracted processing and negotiations. The reorganization at the study site took\napproximately nine months before units were finally merged/created and all staff\nwere in position. The treatment implications of the associated uncertainty, discon-\ntinuity, and other adverse conditions that prevailed during this period may have\nbeen more apparent to the patients than to management.\nThe participants called for more activity, such as hobbies or exercise, citing their\nwork with the horses and the stables as a positive example. Work in the stables is\nreported to be significantly associated with longer time in treatment and completion\nof agreed treatment regimens (Kern-Godal et al., 2015). Being passive and lacking\nmeaningful activity or scheduled tasks could trigger drug craving and negative emo-\ntions. Inclusion of hobbies in therapy has been associated with improved treatment\ncompletion (Decker et al., 2014). Physical activity can improve abstinence, comorbid\nSeveral participants experienced little or no support in the transition from SUD\ntreatment into ``real life.'' To meet the acknowledged needs among most SUD\npatients for continued care, treatment approaches focusing on comprehensive\ncare, including postdischarge care and hospital-initiated follow-up should be devel-\noped and evaluated.\nReflexivity\nOne's own background and situation can influence what one chooses to study and\nalso applies to our investigator team. All of its members worked in SUD treatment\nand/or research, and were aware that reducing SUD treatment dropout was a\npriority for the Department. This exploratory study was characterized by a nai\u00a8ve\nclinical interest, where the main goal was to gain a better understanding of dropout\nfrom a user perspective. The participants were essentially given the research ques-\ntion in a semistructured interview situation with standard prompts if they fell silent.\nKN was a student in his last year of a professional degree in psychology at the time\nof the interviews. SA had earned a Master of Science in nursing, in addition to\nmany years of clinical SUD therapy experience. KN had little experience with or\nknowledge of the Department of Addiction Treatment--Youth, while SA had an\ninsider's knowledge and knew some of the participants. Both interviewers thus had\npossible strengths and weaknesses in terms of how participants were likely to\nrespond to their questions. Some participants may have felt safer talking with\nsomeone they already knew, whereas others may have found it easier to talk\nwith a ``neutral'' person, who was not attached to the Department. KN and SA\ncomplemented one another across the study procedures.\nLimitations\nThis study was designed to specifically investigate dropout from the patient users'\nperspectives. As such, it presents the views and experience of only one group which\nwas targeted precisely because they had recently dropped out of the treatment. The\nparticipants' responses, both positive and critical, raise fundamental and rarely\nreported programmatic and therapeutic relationship issues. Their insight provides\nnew and valuable information which requires further investigation. However, the\nperspectives of patients who remain in treatment, and the perspectives of clinicians,\nprogram managers, and the policy makers are also required in order to fully under-\nstand how SUD treatment can be made more responsive to the needs of patients\nand enhance retention.\nThe nature and size of the sample have implications for the generalizability of\nthe findings. We worked with a sample of 15 participants and have no means of\nknowing whether the views expressed are representative of all SUD treatments in\nNorway or elsewhere. With one exception, nonparticipation was due to inability\nto make contact, so the underlying reason for nonparticipation is unknown.\nThe telephone could have been lost or the telephone number changed. It could\nalso have been due to relapse or a desire to put treatment behind and get on with a\nnew life. However, our findings are consistent with both quantitative SUD treat-\nRavndal and Amundsen, 2010) and the few qualitative studies of SUD treatment\ndropout (Kothari et al., 2010; Laudet et al., 2009). We consider the findings to have\nimplications for clinical and social work practice, management, and research.\nImplications\nClinical and social work practice\nThe study findings point to a need for greater focus on emotions and on the\nimportance of staff working more closely with patients and being more available\nin the ``day-to-day milieu.'' Furthermore, the staff should strive for equal, fair and\npredictable conduct and patient treatment. Rules and procedures should be trans-\nparent and well known. To ensure continuity, all patients should be offered treat-\nment follow-up whether they drop out or complete their planned treatment.\nFollow-up should be initiated by the treatment site and utilize existing\npatient\u00adstaff alliances to the extent possible. Post-treatment telephone follow-up\nwas established in 2015 at the Department of Addiction Treatment--Youth\nin response to these findings. The patients have overwhelmingly opted in to\nthis voluntary treatment service. The patient must have an active part in his or\nher own treatment, and staff should facilitate this. The treatment site should also\nprovide a range of activities including hobbies, physical exercise, and job-relevant\ntraining.\nManagement\nThe participants' definitions of dropout, reasons for dropping out, and suggested\nchanges to SUD treatment regimens indicate a need to rethink SUD treatment\nmanagement. The findings call for resourcing more integrated SUD treatment\nservices to provide easily accessible meaningful activities and continuity of care\n(from initial residential care, through transitional phase care, to end-stage commu-\nnity-based services). Provisions to enable continuity of contact with key staff\nshould be part of this transition process.\nReorganization and change are inevitable, and indeed necessary, in the rapidly\nevolving, high-cost health sector. However, in the planning for and implementation\nof change, adverse effects such as uncertainty need to be minimized. Care and\nadequate resourcing are required to ensure that patient needs are met and prevent-\nable treatment failure is avoided during the transition from old to new organiza-\ntional arrangements.\nResearch\nOur findings suggest a need for additional dropout studies using more nuanced\ndefinitions of the term and greater exploration of the patients' reasons for dropout\nfrom the user perspective. As this study shows, active patient participation can\nindicate new directions and treatment aspects which are rarely addressed in the\nlargely service provider-oriented SUD discourse. The participants in this study\nemphasized factors involving the organization of the treatment, personal contact\nwith the staff, the importance of activity and of follow-up, plus the impact of\norganizational change on treatment quality. All of these factors, together with\nthe programmatic, therapeutic alliance and staff perspective factors referred to\nabove merit further investigation. The findings presented here are empirical and\nreport the results from a thematic analysis of the transcripts from interviews of\nSUD treatment dropout participants. The user perspective is generally underre-\nported, and we hope the findings are useful contributions to multidisciplinary\ntheoretical debates.\nConclusions\nThis study was based on the user perspective and experiences in dropping out of\nSUD treatment. The results indicate that dropout is a more diverse and complex\nphenomenon than previously described in the literature.\nThe participants called for more treatment focus on drug craving, interaction\nbetween drug abuse and difficult emotions, knowledge about those emotions, and\ntraining in tolerating emotional discomfort. They wanted closer contact with the\ntreatment staff and closer posttreatment follow-up. They wanted more activity\nduring treatment and assistance during the transition phase from treatment to their\nnew life. These findings show a complex pattern of variables involved in SUD treat-\nment dropout, in which both patient factors and treatment factors seem to interact.\n"
