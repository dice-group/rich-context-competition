By the end of 2008, the\nfederal funds rate was at the zero-lower bound, thereby rendering further conventional\nmonetary policy unavailable. To mitigate continuing funding pressure, Figure 1 shows\nthat the U.S. Federal Reserve distributed up to 1.2 trillion USD by means of various\nemergency lending facilities and the Discount Window to financial institutions with a\nU.S. banking charter. Notably, the cost of liquidity from these facilities was well below\nthe refinancing cost of the European Central Bank (ECB), as illustrated in Figure 2,\nand more than half of the distributed volume was used by affiliates1 of foreign banks\n(Benmelech, 2012; Acharya, Drechsler, and Schnabl, 2014). We test if U.S. emergency\nliquidity was re-allocated via the internal capital markets of international (non-U.S.) bank\nholding companies (IBHC), thereby affecting banks' funding and lending terms outside\nthe U.S. economy.\nFigure 1: Total size of funding facilities\nBars show the total balance outstanding of all six Federal Reserve funding facilities (TAF, PDCF, TSLF, AMLF, CPFF,\nSTOMO) and the Discount Window in billion USD (left scale) from December 2007 to April 2010.

The empirical evi-\ndence for the U.S. emergency liquidity provision suggests that it mitigated banks funding\npressure fairly well (Wu, 2011; Syrstad, 2014),2 effectively substituting for conventional\nmonetary policy in terms of employment and output responses (Gambacorta, Hofmann,\nand Peersman, 2014). Whereas short-term funding pressure mounted, lending volumes\ncontracted, and lending rates increased in the U.S. due to the crisis (Santos, 2010; Ivashina\nand Scharfstein, 2010), emergency liquidity lines mitigated domestic lending contraction\nespecially through large banks (Berger, Black, Bouwman, and Dlugosz, 2014). However,\nthe consequences of unconventional U.S. monetary policy for credit and funding outside\nthe U.S. remain uncharted, which is what we shed light on with this paper. In contrast\nto the aforementioned contributions surrounding the U.S. emergency lending facilities,\nwe therefore examine the cross-border impact and furthermore include all established\nfacilities.\nSo far, most analyses of cross-border responses to the financial crisis pertain to lending\nand funding volumes rather then pricing, which is our focus. Crisis-ridden banks reduced\nforeign lending significantly (De Haas and Van Lelyveld, 2010; Giannetti and Laeven,\nthe seminal evidence by Peek and Rosengren (1997, 2000), who find a significant flight\nhome effect of Japanese banks contracting their lending to U.S. firms in response to\nthe stock market crash at home. The withdrawal from both foreign credit and funding\nmarkets is, however, not homogeneous across foreign markets, indicating the importance\nof actively managed internal capital markets of IBHCs in re-allocating financial funds\nglobally (see Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012a,b; Galema, Koetter, and Liesegang, 2015).\nWe complement these studies by investigating the role of such internal capital markets\nfor the cross-border transmission of monetary policy in terms of pricing, thereby testing\nmore directly the implications for banks' cost of funding and corporates' cost of bank\ndebt.\nContrary to prior studies on the pass-through of policy and shocks via internal capital\nmarkets of nationally active banks,4 we use a unique setting with three main advantages\nto cast more light on the international transmission of monetary policy. Our setting\nhinges on the release of micro data regarding the use of U.S. liquidity on a bank-by-bank\nbasis, manually collected internal capital market connections of IBHCs and supervisory\ninformation on interest rate setting for new credit and funding by banks outside the\nU.S. with and without access to emergency liquidity provided by the Fed. As such, we\ncontribute to the few studies of the international transmission of monetary policy through\n2Both the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) mitigated liquidity shortages\nof banks (Fleming, Hrung, and Keane, 2010), but did not reduce their borrowing costs relative to LIBOR (Kuo, Skeie,\nand Vickery, 2012). Duygan-Bump, Parkinson, Rosengren, Suarez, and Willen (2013) find that the ABCP Money Market\nMutual Funds Liquidity Facility (AMLF) significantly reduced ABCP yields and prevented fund outflows. Puddu and\nW\u00a8\nalchli (2012) show that TAF funds were successful in reducing the liquidity risk of U.S. banks.\n3Lending contraction effects are particularly pronounced when banks are highly leveraged (Devereux and Yetman, 2010),\nthereby adding to the dissemination of the financial crisis to both emerging (Popov and Udell, 2012) and developed economies\n4Such as Campello (2002) for the U.S., Cremers, Huang, and Sautner (2011) for the Netherlands, or Frey and Kerl\n(2015) who consider domestic lending conditional on internal capital market activity.\nFigure 2: Funding cost of emergency liquidity\nThe figure plots the refinancing rate of ECB liquidity provision to the average interest rate charged under several Federal\nReserve emergency lending facilities.\n%\ndate\nECB policy rate Fed Discount Window rate\nDaily liquidity provision\n%\ndate\nECB refinancing rate (15-45 days) TAF refinancing rate (28 days)\nTSLF refinancing rate (28 days)\n1-month liquidity provision\n%\ndate\nECB refinancing rate (>60 days) TAF refinancing rate (84 days)\nCPFF refinancing rate (90 days)\n3-months liquidity provision\nComparison of Refinancing Rates\ninternationally active banks, such as Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012a,b) who observe capital\nflows in the networks of internationally active U.S. banks or Buch, Koch, and Koetter\n(2011b) who analyze balance sheet composition of German banks with access to the Term\nAuction Facility (TAF).\nA first important challenge to these studies that we overcome is that emergency liquid-\nity usage is conventionally unobservable to avoid stigmatization and self-fulfilling prophe-\ncies of bank distress due to a deterioration of banks' market values (Cyree, Griffiths, and\nWinters, 2013). We take advantage of the public release of detailed data on the identity\nof all banks that used any of the six different U.S. emergency facilities or the Discount\nWindow, which had to be released in 2011 under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nafter a lawsuit filed by Bloomberg L.P. against the Federal Reserve System in 2008 (New\nYork Southern District Court, 2008). The published data on emergency facilities and\nthe Discount Window lists daily funds outstanding for all individual entities between\nSecond, the identification of an exogenous monetary policy shock is crucial, yet noto-\nrious due to the simultaneity between banking system health and the policy stance. The\nBloomberg data provides the names, the timing, and the volume of Fed liquidity used\nby non-U.S. banks. We identify the exogenous effect of this unconventional monetary\npolicy by comparing banks on German soil that have access to U.S. liquidity facilities\nvia their affiliates to those banks on German soil that have no such access. To this end,\nwe manually identify the IBHC with which the \"Bloomberg banks\" are associated and\nwhether these IBHCs operate in Germany. Figure 3 vividly illustrates the intensive use\nof U.S. emergency liquidity by German banks. They tapped up to 100 billion EUR in\nSeptember 2008, which amounts to around 10% of the entire volume of the U.S. facilities\nat the time and is in size comparable to the contribution of Germany's financial system\nto German GDP.\nThird, if liquidity shocks are transmitted to banking markets outside the U.S. through\nan internal capital markets channel by IBHCs, we expect to see systematically different\nloan and deposit rates charged on markets outside the U.S. for any additional credit or\nfunding business generated. Such detailed lending and funding rates for new rather than\noutstanding stocks of loans and deposits are rare. We use detailed interest rate data on\nnew business reported monthly by a representative sample of both German and foreign\nbanks to the German central bank, the Bundesbank. We collect data from annual re-\nports of all IBHCs and match these with all 217 German banks that report detailed loan\nand funding prices on a monthly basis. In contrast to studies confined to large syndicated\nloans (e.g. Giannetti and Laeven, 2012a) or wholesale corporate funding auction platforms\n(e.g. Acharya, Imbierowicz, Steffen, and Teichmann, 2015) to identify transmission effects\nof monetary policy, we thus investigate marginal interest rates charged by a representa-\ntive sample of banks on commercial and industrial lending to a wide range of corporate\ncustomers.\nOur results clearly show that short-term funding costs of German banks vis-`\na-vis\ncorporate depositors declined significantly in response to U.S. liquidity assistance. Short-\nterm deposit rates offered to corporates in Germany by banks with access via the internal\ncapital market of their IBHC were lower compared to short-term deposit rates offered\nby banks without access to the U.S. emergency facilities. For each percent of emergency\nfunding per total IBHC assets, short-term deposit rates decline by 2.3 basis points. An\nFigure 3: Total funds distributed to German banks\nBars show the balance outstanding of all six Federal Reserve funding facilities (TAF, PDCF, TSLF, AMLF, CPFF, STOMO)\nand the Discount Window in billion EUR (left scale) from December 2007 to April 2010. Lines indicate the balance in %\nof annual total German GDP and German financial sector GDP, respectively (right scale). GDP data source: OECD.\nincrease in using the emergency lending facilities by one standard deviation in this case\ncorresponds to a lowering in short-term funding costs by 1.1%. As such, the objective of\nU.S. monetary policy to reduce short-term funding pressure of banks even extended be-\nyond the boundaries of its own market, albeit at a small magnitude. Short-term corporate\nloan rates declined after a lag of two to four months. In contrast, neither long-run lending\nnor funding interest rates exhibit significant differential effects. Likewise, both lending\nand deposit volumes do not respond significantly. These results confirm that liquidity\nemergency policies might have eased pressure on the short end of the yield curve, but\ncould not reduce longer term risk premia.\nWe also find that banks with less pre-crisis exposure to Asset Backed Commercial\nPaper (ABCP) exhibit a decline in short-term funding rates. The magnitude of this effect\ndeclined for growing ABCP exposures, but remains significantly negative. Consistent with\nthis result we also find that the reduction in funding cost are larger for banks that held\nmore liquidity prior to 2007. This result suggests that banks facing no or weak funding\nconstraints substituted other conventional liabilities with cheaper U.S. liquidity as sug-\ngested by studies advocating the existence of global, actively managed internal capital\nmarkets. We also find that the weakest banks in terms of capitalization reduced funding\ncost the most. Thus, access to additional emergency funds through internal capital mar-\nkets did succeed in easing short-term financing conditions for banks substantially exposed\nto funding constraints.\nOur results are robust toward a plethora of alternative definitions of access to U.S.\nfacilities via internal capital markets, the inclusion of explicit liquidity measures, and\nsemi-annual \u00d7 bank fixed effects to gauge possibly confounding (unconventional) Eu-\nropean monetary policy measures, matched sampling of banks in Germany to address\npotential concerns of self-selection of large banks into international activities, placebo\ntests regarding the timing of liquidity support facilities, and alternative lag structures\nregarding the transmission speed of U.S. monetary policy to interest rates in the German\nbanking market via internal capital markets.\n2 Identification and Methodology\n2.1 Facilities and IBHC networks\nAs a response to the interbank market breakdown resulting from the subprime mortgage\ncrisis in 2007, the Federal Reserve established six different funding facilities in addition to\nthe Discount Window. Although the discount rate was already substantially lowered by\nDecember 2007, institutions hardly made use of the Discount Window, possibly to avoid\nstigmatization. The Term Auction Facility (TAF) and the five other facilities installed\nsubsequently, were thus created as new monetary policy instruments to alleviate liquidity\nshortages in the financial market in general, rather than supporting individual institutions\nin need.\nLiquidity provision through these facilities took various forms:5 TAF, established in\nDecember 2007, provided short-term credit (for a maximum of 84 days) through bi-weekly\nauctions to deposit-taking financial institutions against a wide range of collateral until\nMarch 2010. In March 2008, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and Term Secu-\nrities Lending Facility (TSLF) were established to provide overnight loans and exchange\nvarious types of collateral (including ABCP) against Treasury collateral. The ABCP\nMoney Market Mutual Funds Liquidity Facility (AMLF) helped institutions to finance\npurchases of high-quality ABCP from mutual funds from September 2008 onward, with\nfurther liquidity provision through the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), es-\ntablished only one month later, supporting the market for commercial paper in general.\nAdditionally, primary dealers were provided with liquidity through single-tranche open\nmarket operations (STOMO) between March and December 2008. All facilities, with the\nFigure 1 illustrates the development of total funds outstanding in relation to the U.S.\neconomy and the U.S. financial sector. By the end of 2008, the size of the facilities\ncorresponded to up to around 8% of total annual U.S. GDP, and 135% of annual U.S.\nfinancial sector output. The Federal Reserve System's emergency facilities were thus\nsignificantly larger in size than the U.S. government's assistance provided through the\nTroubled Assets Relief Program (TARP, around 430 billion USD). For an institution\nto directly participate in the auctions or have access to the facilities, it had to be an\nentity with a U.S. banking charter, which includes affiliates of non-U.S. IBHCs, thereby\nproviding these banks also with access to U.S. emergency liquidity.\nFigure 4 illustrates the three possibilities how we identify banks, that report interest\nrates to the German central bank, and faced a positive funding shock. The first channel\n5See the Online Appendix for a more detailed description of the facilities' working mechanisms and terms.\n6The Term Auction facility formally remained active, but ceased to conduct auctions in February 2010.\ncontains German banks that are a member of an IBHC with a U.S. affiliate. Second,\nGerman branches and subsidiaries of U.S. IBHCs had access via their internal capital\nmarkets. And third, German affiliates of non-U.S., non-German IBHCs, that also operated\naffiliates in the U.S.\nFigure 4: Illustration of observed cases of treated banks\nThe figure below illustrates the three different possible cases, in which a bank in Germany can have access to U.S. emergency\nlending facilities through its network. We observe interest rates for 217 different banks in Germany, which are considered\nto be treated, whenever one bank in its IBHC is a registered bank in the U.S. and can thus have access to U.S. facilities.\n\n\n\nHeadquarters\nSubsidiaries / Branches\nTypes of IBHCs with access to U.S. emergency facilities\n German IBHC with an affiliated bank in the U.S.\n U.S. IBHC with an affiliated bank in Germany\n Non-German, non-U.S. IBHC with affiliated banks in both Germany and the U.S.\nUSA\nGermany\nBanks are considered members of a certain IBHC whenever the latter has an equity\ninterest or voting rights of more than 50% in the bank. Therefore, we manually gather\nownership data from the annual reports of IBHCs associated with banks revealed on the\nBloomberg list. In case there was a mid-year change of ownership during the time the\nfacilities were in operation, the date of ownership change stated in the annual reports is\nused. Where no annual reports were available, the IBHC-association was confirmed by\ninformation from official company websites.\nOne exception are German savings banks, which exhibit a two-tiered network struc-\nture that consists of multiple regional savings banks being associated with one so-called\nLandesbank. The latter acts as a head institution for the local savings banks in a certain\nregion conducting, for example, capital market operations or payment services on their\nbehalf. Landesbanken conduct their business only in certain states (Bundesl\u00a8\nander) and\nare typically jointly owned by the regional savings banks and the states where they are\nlocated. Following the approach of Puri, Rocholl, and Steffen (2011), we thus consider\na regional savings bank to have access to U.S. emergency liquidity if they are tied to a\nLandesbank with a U.S. branch or subsidiary.7\nFigure 5 shows that this identification scheme results in 139 out of the 217 banks in\nour sample that are members of an IBHC with access to Federal Reserve funding facilities.\nThese 139 banks on German soil with access to the U.S. liquidity facilities belong to 22\nnon-U.S. IBHCs, of which all operated their branches or subsidiaries already in 2004, the\ncommencement year of the formal interest rate statistics, up and until today with one\nexception.8 This persistent internationalization pattern in terms of foreign affiliates is\nconsistent with the results reported by Buch, Koch, and Koetter (2011a) and suggests a\nsystematic self-selection of (large) banks in to the U.S. market in anticipation of future\nemergency liquidity provision to be unlikely. Nonetheless, we also consider various alter-\nnative access definitions, which are indicated in the bottom portion of Figure 5, and for\nwhich we report results in the Online Appendix.\n2.2 Specification of emergency facility effects\nBased on this identification of internal capital market access of IBHCs to Federal Reserve\nliquidity facilities, we estimate the effects of U.S. liquidity support on interest rates set in\nGermany in two ways.\nFirst, we specify a canonical difference-in-difference model that compares interest rate\ndifferentials between banks with and without access to U.S. emergency liquidity due to\nthe presence of an AFFILIATE prior to the inception of facilities in December 2007\nto interest-rate differentials between banks of these two groups after the facilities were\nabandoned in May 2010. In this baseline estimation we examine a possible change in\nthe funding conditions of banks with access to U.S. funding. We estimate the following\nregression:\nri,m\n=m\n+ it\n+ i,m\nThe dependent variables ri,m\nare different lending and funding interest rates of bank i\nin month m, AFFILIATEi\nis a dummy variable equal to one if a bank has access to\nemergency funding through a U.S. affiliate in its IBHC network.

The analyzed\ndata sample is constructed of German banks included in the interest rate report of Deutsche Bundesbank (Zinsstatistik).\nBanks with access includes all banks which are part of an IBHC network that includes a registered bank in the U.S. Among\nthe banks with access, some also belong to non-German IBHCs. These are either German affiliates of U.S.-IBHCs (subgroup\nc)), or affiliates of foreign, non-U.S. IBHCs (subgroup d)). The latter are banks of non-German BHCs, which accessed the\nfacilities through their U.S. affiliates. The subgroup of German banks with access can further be separated into heads of\nIBHCs, and subsidiaries of IBHCs (e) and f)). The form of access to the facilities is different for these subgroups, as heads\nhave direct control over the U.S. subsidiaries (which accessed the facilities), while facility funds reach German subsidiaries\nonly through the head companies, thus indirectly. The actual number of banks included in the regressions may vary as the\npanel is unbalanced and not all banks offer all types of products for which interest rates are observed.\nLiquidity, and Central Bank Liabilities. All variables are defined in Table 1 and we discuss\nand describe them below.\nTable 1: Description of variables\nDependent variables are monthly interest rates reported by individual banks to Deutsche Bundesbank's Zinsstatistik\n(interest rate report).

This specification is crucial to minimize possible concerns\nabout confounding policy measures, such as unobserved liquidity facilities provided by\nthe European Central Bank (ECB) (see, for example, Acharya et al., 2015). Controlling\nfor such unobservables per bank-term in addition to observed monthly liquidity indica-\ntors from prudential data, namely liquidity ratios and central bank liabilities, aids the\nidentification of the effect of U.S. facilities on interest rates in Germany.\nThis specification implies that the direct effect of having an AFFILIATEi\nis sub-\nsumed by the bank\u00d7semi-annual fixed effect since IBHCs did not retreat or entered the\nU.S. market during the sample period. Likewise, the direct term for POSTm\nis subsumed\nby the monthly fixed effects. Whereas such a difference-in-difference approach therefore\nTable 2: Funds received from individual facilities\nOverview of the average monthly balance outstanding to the different Federal Reserve funding facilities and the Discount\nWindow between December 2007 and April 2010 (29 months) in million EUR. USAGE is measured as Federal Reserve\nfunds outstanding in percent of group total assets. The sample includes only IBHCs with headquarters and/or affiliates in\nGermany, i.e. funds having a link to banks in Germany.\npermits the exact identification of the presence of affiliates, it does suffer from two lim-\nitations. First, it neglects the intensity with which IBHCs have tapped the facilities,\nthereby camouflaging cross-sectional heterogeneity across banks' actual usage of favor-\nable U.S. funding conditions.9 Indeed, the data show significant changes in the amount\nof borrowed funds, both across IBHCs and time. Second, although the establishment of\nliquidity facilities signals a possible change in the policy stance \u00ad and may therefore be a\npermanent shock to banks with access \u00ad some liquidity effects will be short-lived rather\nthan yielding a long-term and sustained reduction of banks' funding costs, which may or\nmay not be passed on to corporate credit customers in the form of lower loan rates.\nAs a second approach, we therefore take a closer look at the dynamics during the\n`treatment period', i.e. we estimate a reduced form to explain observed interest rates\nduring the lifetime of the facilities with observed bank-specific usage of these facilities per\nIBHC. Contrary to the first approach, we thus focus on the months between December\n2007 and May 2010 when the facilities were in place to gauge any possible short-term\nrate-setting effects. Table 2 reports the average monthly balance of all IBHCs that are\nassociated with banks on German soil in our data sample. These volumes are derived from\nthe individual facility usage reported in the Bloomberg data between December 2007 and\nMay 2010. All banks with access in our data sample used the various Fed lines at some\npoint in time during the lifetime of the emergency facilities. Furthermore, there is no\nbank which gained or lost access to the funding due to a change in the IBHC structure.\nWe therefore examine the effect of emergency funding based on the different amounts\nin facility usage, rather than changes in the access structure. On a monthly basis, we\nestimate the impact on offered interest rates by a bank in Germany in a fixed-effect\nregression framework, according to the following equation:\nri,m\n= m\n+ it\n+ USAGEi,m\n+ i,m\nwhere USAGEi,m\nis the IBHC's outstanding balance across all emergency facilities\nand the Discount Window as a share of total assets. We compute monthly balances\n9Figure 1 in the Online Appendix gives an overview over the different average facility usage of IBHCs included in our\ndata sample.\noutstanding as the average daily balance across all facilities and the Discount Window.\nThe USD balances are converted to EUR using the respective average monthly ECB\nreference rate. The variable USAGE is the average monthly balance divided by the total\nassets of the IBHC, multiplied by 100. Total assets of the IBHC are the consolidated\nbalance sheet totals of the highest ranking bank of the network in the sample, i.e. the\nhighest available consolidation level in our dataset. For German IBHCs, this equals the\ntotal assets of the IBHC head company, which is always included in the sample. For non-\nGerman IBHCs, this equals the total assets of the largest affiliate bank in the sample.10\nUSAGE thus represents the funds obtained in percentages of the respective IBHC's size,\nthereby accounting for size differences of IBHCs with access to funding. Descriptive\nstatistics are available in Table 2.\n3 Data sources and treatment validity\n3.1 Emergency facilities\nDetailed information on the amounts received from the Federal Reserve System by indi-\nvidual IBHCs was made public by Bloomberg in 2011. The dataset provides a complete\naccount of all funds granted for each of the facilities and the Discount Window, as well as\naggregated data. Balances vis-`\na-vis the Federal Reserve are stated on a daily basis during\nthe entire lifetime of the facilities and are available at the IBHC level.\nThe dataset was released after Bloomberg L.P. had successfully filed a lawsuit against\nthe Board of the Federal Reserve on grounds of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in\nNovember 2008. The FOIA gives U.S. citizens the right to access documents and related\ninformation on the actions of the government. The Federal Reserve System had refused\nto provide these information on grounds of the confidentiality of financial information,\nwhich is generally excluded from the FOIA. In August 2009, the court ruled in favor of\nBloomberg. Despite several appeals by the Federal Reserve System, the data were even-\ntually released in 2011 after the Supreme Court rejected the final appeal. Bloomberg\nsubsequently made the information available through its information network. Further-\nmore, complete data on the emergency funding facilities is also available through the\nFederal Reserve's website.\nWe obtain monthly interest rates and new business volumes from the interest rate report\n(Zinsstatistik) of Deutsche Bundesbank from January 2004 to December 2014. The re-\nport is a mandatory survey of interest rates and business volumes of banks in Germany,\nconducted on a monthly basis. The reporting banks are a representative sample of around\n200 banks of the banking sector in Germany, with large banks regularly included and a\nvarying pool of smaller banks. The sample corresponds to approximately 10% of all banks\nin Germany and covers more than 75% of aggregate banking assets in Germany.11\n10For further robustness we exclude these banks from treatment in one of our alternative treatment definitions.\n11The Zinsstatistik is reported for a stratified sample and includes representative proportions of all three main pillars of\nthe German banking system: Commercial, savings, and cooperative banks.\nThe complete report differentiates more than 50 categories of deposit and credit prod-\nucts. To represent an important share of overall banking activity, we focus on the most\nfrequently reported products for non-financial corporate clients, for short-term (< 1 year)\nand long-term (> 2 or 5 years) maturities.12 From the perspective of the bank, this corre-\nsponds to one asset side and one liability side product for each maturity category. Table 1\npresents detailed descriptions of the variables. Clients are incorporated non-financial busi-\nnesses, such as publicly listed or limited companies. Interest rates are reported as averages\nfor newly generated business during the reported month, and all rates are reported in per-\ncentages.\n3.3 Control variables\nWe construct control variables from the monthly liquidity and balance sheet report of\nDeutsche Bundesbank (Bilanzstatistik). For an overview of the control variables and\ntheir exact definitions see Table 1. Bank Size is defined as ln(total assets) and captures\nthe differences in institution size, Leverage Ratio (share of total equity) accounts for the\ndifferences in capitalization. Accounting for the differences in funding, Wholesale Funding\nrepresents the share of securitized debt on the balance sheet, while Latent Liabilities\ncaptures exposure to latent liabilities as a share of total assets.\nMost importantly, we also control for monthly variation in available liquidity of each\nbank. Liquidity is the share of net liquidity balances relative to total assets. The former\nis obtained from prudential accounts in which banks indicate details about their assets\nand liabilities with a maturity of up to 30 days. In addition, we specify Central Bank\nLiabilities as net assets with the central bank of up to one year in maturity. Hence,\nany cross-sectional differences among banks in the use of unobserved liquidity provision\nother than the U.S. facilities investigated here should be gauged by these covariates. The\nfact that the interest rates charged on U.S. liquidity facilities were lower compared to\nthe marginal lending facility of the ECB for the entire sample period (see Figure 2 in the\nOnline Appendix) further suggests that confounding monetary policy by, for example, the\nECB is adequately controlled for by these control variables in conjunction with the rich\nset of fixed effects.\n3.4 Descriptive statistics and treatment validity\nTable 3 presents in the first two panels summary statistics for the dependent and control\nvariables in the treatment and the control group of the difference-in-difference sample\nwithout the treatment period (December 2007 and April 2010) as well as the full sample\nused in the reduced form estimation represented by Equation (2). Overall, the sample\ncomprises monthly data for 217 individual banks in Germany between January 2004 and\nDecember 2014 (132 months). Banks in the treatment group were at some time between\nDecember 2007 and April 2010 part of an IBHC with access to the emergency facilities.\nThe remaining banks form the control group (see Figure 5).\nThe financial products, for which we analyze loan pricing, are the most frequently\nreported products in the interest report for corporate clients. Variations in the number\n12We find no impact on medium-term interest rates or new business volumes and therefore focus on short-term and\nlong-term interest rates in the following.\nof observations arise because not all banks regularly report values for all categories, ei-\nther because no new business was generated during a respective month or the respective\nproduct is not part of the bank's business model. The minimum number of observations\nThe t-test for the equality of means confirms significant differences between the re-\nported rates and the control variables of the treatment and the control group. Banks in\nthe treatment group on average offer higher deposit rates, while simultaneously charging\nhigher credit rates in both samples, with and without the treatment period itself. We\nlater on confirm our results on a matched sample to further address a potential sampling\nbias.\nThe bottom panel in Table 3, however, illustrates that prior to the inception of U.S.\nemergency facility lines, neither interest rates on funding and lending nor bank traits\ndeveloped significantly differently. This parallel development of observable bank traits\nbodes well for our objective to identify the effect of the policy rather than confounding it\nwith observable systematic differences already in place before the policy.\n4.1 Baseline results\nTable 4 reports the baseline estimation results according to Equation (1) in columns (I)-\n(IV) and Equation (2) in columns (V)-(VIII). Consider first short-term rate effects, the\nprimary target of unconventional monetary policy in the form of providing additional\nliquidity lines, according to the difference-in-difference approach. Column (I) exhibits a\nsignificantly negative effect of emergency facility usage on short-term deposit rates. The\ndifferential impact on the short-term funding cost of banks in Germany with access to U.S.\nliquidity via the internal capital market of the IBHC amounts to 12.5 basis points, which\nis substantial given the sample's average short-term interest rate of 1.6% as it corresponds\nto a decrease in short-term funding costs of around 7.8%.\nThis effect is confirmed for the sample that considers responses gauging the intensity\nof USAGE during the disbursement period in column (V). The reduction of short-term\nfunding cost of banks in Germany with access to U.S. liquidity via the internal capital\nmarket of their IBHC amounts to 2.3 basis points for each percent of emergency funding\nper total IBHC assets. Given average short-term interest rates of 2.5%, this corresponds\nto a reduction in short-term funding costs by around 1.1%.\nTherefore, German banks with access to Fed liquidity facilities benefited, but the eco-\nnomic magnitude of these benefits was relatively small. Yet, these statistically significant\neffects are remarkable since they provide clear evidence for the international transmission\nof unorthodox monetary policy on the cost of borrowing. Thereby, our micro evidence\ncomplements macroeconomic studies concerning the domestic transmission of monetary\npolicy on the cost of borrowing (see, e.g., Gilchrist, L\u00b4\nopez-Salido, and Zakraj\u00b4\nTable 3: Summary statistics\nThe table presents summary statistics of dependent variables and control variables for banks with access to Federal Reserve\nfunding facilities (`treatment group') and without access (`control group'), as well as the respective differences in means.\nindividual banks.

Columns (II) and (VI) show insignificant\neffects for those banks with access to U.S. liquidity facilities. This result is in line with\nCycon and Koetter (2015), who find that the reduction of internal funding cost of a large\ncommercial bank in response to the ECB's Security Purchase Program (SMP) was passed\non to customer rates only in part. Instead, they show that interest margins earned by the\nbank increase.\nThe remaining columns (III), (IV), (VII), and (VIII) in Table 4 show that banks with\naccess to U.S. facilities through the IBHC network do neither exhibit significantly different\nlong-term loan nor deposit rates. This result suggests that the emergency facilities in the\nU.S. were able to relieve short-term pressure in credit and funding markets as intended.\nBut they had no differential effect on the long end of the yield curve faced by banks\noperating in Germany. As such, internal capital markets of IBHCs appear to be of rele-\nvance to transmit monetary policy internationally, but possibly unintended consequences\nabroad for long term financing decisions appear to be limited, at least in other developed\neconomies such as the German one.\nSince especially the short-run responses to emergency liquidity provisions appear to\nbe robust toward either identification scheme, we focus henceforth on the specification\nrepresented by Equation (2) to investigate the responses of interest rate setting also during\n4.2 Lagged pass-through\nThe effect of access to U.S. liquidity facilities on funding and lending rates discussed above\nassumes that any potential pass-through via internal capital markets of IBHCs occurs\ninstantaneously since we specify the usage by bank i contemporaneously. However, recent\nstudies investigating the effects of other unorthodox monetary policy on interest rates in\nvariants of a Vector Autoregression setting, such as Boeckx, Dossche, and Peersman (2015)\nfor the Eurozone, document lagged effects on interest rates in response to quantitative\neasing of up to four quarters.\nTherefore, Figure 6 shows estimated coefficients for USAGE according to Equation (2)\nwhen we specify the scaled amount of used liquidity of each bank's IBHC with up to 12\nlags, i.e. one year. These lags illustrate the response of banks' interest rates up to\n12 months after facility usage. The negative effect on banks' funding cost in terms of\ncontracted corporate deposit rates by banks in Germany with access to U.S. liquidity\nloses significance after two to three months. Importantly, we also find that short-term\ncustomer credit rates exhibit a economically significant reduction due to access to U.S.\nliquidity that is significantly different from zero for lags between two and four months.\nThis result highlights that unorthodox liquidity provision in the U.S. not only repre-\nsented a funding advantage to internationally active banks, but also eased credit terms to\nGerman corporates. The magnitudes of these effects are not statistically different from\neach other. Any refunding advantages enjoyed by banks that are a member of an IBHC\nwith internal capital market access to the U.S. did not result in a competitive advantage\nFigure 6: Lagged effects of access to funding facilities on corporate products\nGraphs illustrate the regression coefficient and the 95% confidence interval for different time lags of USAGE.

As such, our results contradict indications in, for\nexample, Berger and Roman (2015) who find that U.S. banks subject to unconventional\nsupport schemes, in this case TARP, provided recipient banks with more market market\npower. One important explanation why we find little indication of why differential liq-\nuidity assistance induces competitive distortions is that we consider only one portion of\na banks business, namely short-term corporate lending. Another reason might be that\nboth quantitative easing considered in Cycon and Koetter (2015) and Boeckx et al. (2015)\nand outright equity support of banks as in Berger and Roman (2015) affect banks pricing\npolicies differently compared to liquidity assistance, which we investigate here.\nThe two graphs in the bottom panel of Figure 6 confirm, in turn, the absence of\nany significant responses in long-run deposit and credit rates contracted with corporate\ncustomers in Germany. Any impetus from liquidity assistance on the funding constraints\nof banks and credit terms to the real sector therefore remains absent in our sample.\n4.3 Treatment validity\nAn important requirement for valid inference in our empirical set-up is to ensure that the\ncomparison of rates on new deposits and loans by banks in Germany with and without\naccess to U.S. liquidity is not subject to confounding factors, such as the size of the bank\ndetermining whether it operates a branch in the U.S. or not. Studies for the German\nbanking sector have shown that foreign markets are not entered randomly, but that only\nfew, fairly larger, productive, and profitable banks set up subsidiaries and branches abroad\n(Buch et al., 2011a,b; Buch, Koch, and Koetter, 2014). A further possible concern may\nbe that it is exactly these banks that also experience additional inflows of deposits due to\nimplicit bail-out guarantees during crisis times (as e.g. described by Gatev, Schuermann,\nAnd indeed, the descriptive statistics for the present sample of banks that report\ninterest rates to Bundesbank (Table 3) indicate significant differences with respect to\ndependent and control variables between the treatment and control group.\nTo address resulting concerns about sample selection bias, we create a matched sample\nbased on propensity score matching following Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008). We match\neach bank in the treatment group with its nearest neighbor in the control group and\nsubsequently drop all banks in the sample which cannot be matched or do not fulfill the\ncommon support assumption. Subsequently, we re-estimate Equation (2) for the matched\nsample and accordingly report results in Table 5.\nTo conserve on space, we only depict the coefficient of interest, namely the coefficient\nfor the aggregate usage of these facilities. The main result of a decrease in short-term\ndeposit rates remains significant at the 1% level and even increases in magnitude. The\nresult suggests a 13.5 basis point decrease per one percent in facility usage, corresponding\nto an economically significant change of 4.4% in short-term deposit funding cost for the\naverage bank.\n13Note that we do not find any changes in the volumes of deposits to corroborate this concern.\nTable 5: Matched control group\nRegression results for deposits and credits to non-financial corporations on a sample matched by propensity score matching.\nThe sample is composed of monthly data ranging from December 2007 to April 2010 (29 months). Banks in the treatment\ngroup are matched with their nearest neighbor in the control group. Banks without a match or common support are\ndropped from the original sample.

Since it also\nexhibits considerably variation across banks at any given moment in time, we assign\nas a second placebo test the observed volumes of used facilities randomly across banks\nduring the time of treatment. The according results are shown in Panel B of Table 6 and\nconfirm as well the absence of differential effects on both short- and long-term interest rates\nbetween banks in Germany with versus banks without access to U.S. liquidity facilities.\nIn sum, these results strongly support the validity of our approach to use a reduced\nform estimation.\n4.4 Facility support and pre-crisis ABCP exposure\nThe previous results indicate that the Federal Reserve emergency facilities were successful\nin lowering short-term funding costs, and thus alleviated funding constraints in times of\nfinancial turmoil. But did the significant amount of emergency funds reduce funding\nconstraints for those banks which were particularly affected by the crisis? Or was access\nto the facilities used similarly by all banks, irrespective of crisis exposure?\nTo analyze if liquidity assistance access was larger for those banks with large pre-crisis\nABCP exposure, we specify an interaction model and show according results in Table 7.\nShedding light on the role of large pre-crisis ABCP exposures is particularly relevant in\nour sample, because several banks based in Germany held very large amounts of ABCP.\nSince this market was one of the first and most severely affected during the crisis, pre-crisis\nABCP approximate well how affected an IBHC was by the financial crisis.\nThe dataset contains both the ABCP balance in billion USD, as well as the bank's corre-\nsponding end-of-2006 total equity in billion USD. For the variable ABCP, the total ABCP\nbalance is divided by total equity. We divide this ratio by 1000 for better scaling as the\nABCP balance is relatively large compared to total equity. The resulting variable thus\nmeasures the group's exposure in 1000 USD of ABCP per 1 USD of group equity. In case\nof banks that later on belong to one IBHC, but are listed separately in the dataset, the\nsum of outstanding ABCP is scaled with the sum of total equity.\nThe results for short-term rates confirm and corroborate our earlier findings that\nfunding cost of banks in Germany, which were able to use U.S. liquidity facilities exhibit\nTable 6: Placebo test results\nRegression results for deposits and credits to non-financial corporations, with facility usage moved to three years prior to the\nactual usage (Panel A) and randomly assigned facility usage (Panel B).

Contrary to the baseline reports above, we now also find\na contemporaneous negative effect on short-term loans of corporates. The finding that\nlong-term rates charged to German corporations are not responding significantly to U.S.\nliquidity provision is also confirmed.\nBut both the direct pre-crisis exposure to the ABCP market as well as the interaction\nterms are mostly insignificant, the exception being a small positive coefficient estimated\nfor the effect on short-term deposit rates. To assess the effect of economic magnitude, we\nshow the total marginal effect. Figure 7 shows accordingly conditional marginal effects of\nUSAGE with respect to the four interest rates conditional on the distribution of ABCP\nexposures across banks in Germany prior to the crisis.\nNote, that the distribution of the ABCP variable is very skewed. The vast majority\nof IBHC members in Germany had less than 1000 USD of ABCP exposure as a group\nper 1 USD of group equity. Only a handful of banks were engaged more heavily in this\nmarket, which highlights the importance to draw inference not only based on coefficients\nestimated at the mean of the data.\nThe upper two panels of Figure 7 confirm that short-term deposit and loan rates\nare significantly reduced. This effect is different from zero for the funding cost across\nthe entire ABCP distribution, but declines for those banks with the largest pre-crisis\nexposures. Similarly, the reduction in short-term credit rates are significantly negative\nup to around 1,500 USD of ABCP exposure per USD of group equity, but not for those\nIBHC members with very large exposures. As such, the U.S. facilities certainly helped\nto reduce short term loan rates, but customers of the most crisis-affected banks did not\nbenefit from this policy.\nThe bottom panels corroborate as well that long-term rates did not respond to liquidity\nassistance across any degree of ABCP exposure.\nSince the main purposes of the facilities was to ease the funding pressure for banks with\neminent shortage of liquidity, we also specify interactions models with observed liquidity\n(Table 8) and leverage (Table 9). Figures 8 and 9 depict the associated total marginal\neffects corresponding to these estimation results.\nEmergency facilities exert their negative effect on short-term deposit rates across the\nentire range of liquidity positions of German banks. In fact, those with the least binding\nliquidity constraints reduced deposit rates the most, indicating a substitution of funding\nfrom corporate customers with cheaper funds from U.S. emergency facilities. Indeed, a\ncomparison of ECB liquidity facilities with similar maturities compared to those U.S.\nfacilities investigated here shows that the cost of the former were lower throughout the\nentire sample period (see Figure 1 in the Online Appendix).\nShort-term credit rates are only significantly reduced though for those banks with\nthe lowest liquidity positions prior to the inception of the facilities. The transmission of\nunconventional liquidity lines to corporate customers relied thus primarily on banks that\nexhibited the worst financial conditions.\nFigure 9 corroborates this qualification to the extent that only the least capitalized\nbanks exhibit the significantly negative effect of U.S. liquidity access on short term rates.\nConsistent with the results in Jim\u00b4\nenez, Ongena, Peydr\u00b4\nliquidity appears to be routed to the corporate sector in particular by the weakest banks\nin the system.\n4.6 Alternative treatment definitions\nWe consider four alternative differential effects, for which we represent results in the\nAppendix in Tables 10 through 13.

Here, we employ an alternative treatment definition to determine in how far the\nnetwork between savings banks and Landesbanken accounts for our previously reported\nresults. In deviation from our baseline identification, we therefore treat all savings banks\nin our sample as independent from their Landesbank's IBHC and assume that regional\nsavings banks have no longer access to U.S. funding facilities and are thus part of the\ncontrol group.\nThe results in Panel A of Table 10 clearly illustrate that our results are not driven by\nthe relatively large number of regional savings banks that we consider as supported by\nU.S. liquidity facilities via their Landesbank. We continue to estimate a contemporaneous\nreduction of deposit rates in response to the usage of U.S. facilities by 2.2 basis points,\nwhich is very close to the estimated baseline effect.\nIn Panel B we tackle concerns that similarly to regional savings banks, local cooper-\native banks might also be subject to implicit or even explicit liquidity backstops by the\ncentral head institutions (DZ and WGZ Bank), which in turn might have routed tapped\nU.S. liquidity. The result clearly shows that all effects remain intact even when treating\nall cooperative banks as supported.\n4.6.2 The impact of large banks\nSeveral banks in our sample are especially large commercial banks or serve as central\ninstitutions with special tasks for savings and cooperative banks. As such, they play\na prominent role in the market and may strongly affect our results. Therefore, we ex-\nclude these large banks in Table 11 to report the effects of emergency facility support\nindependent of these institutions. The interaction term remains significantly negative for\nshort-term deposits whereas the absence of significant effects for short-term credit rates as\nwell as any long-term rates is also confirmed. This result therefore strongly suggests that\ninternal capital markets are an important channel through which in particular smaller\nbanks might benefit from additional liquidity tapped by U.S. members of the IBHC.\n4.6.3 Effect on German IBHC banks\nFigure 5 highlights the numerous possible alternatives how to define IBHC and thus access\nto U.S. liquidity via internal capital markets. Our previous results were obtained under\nthe assumption that both affiliates of German IBHCs and affiliates of non-German IBHCs\nwere equally affected by transfers of supporting funds through internal capital markets.\nBut De Haas and Van Horen (2012) provide evidence that internal capital markets during\ncrisis may favor home country banks. Therefore foreign banks with access to funding\nmay not be affected in the same way and distort our results. In the following analysis\nwe exclude these banks (all banks in subsamples c) and d)) in Figure 5) from our data\nsample. The results in Panel A of Table 12 confirm the baseline reduction of short-term\ndeposit rates.\nWe further show the difference in impact between German and non-German IBHC\nbanks among the subsample of all banks with access to the U.S. emergency funding\nsupport (subsamples b), c) and d) in Figure 5) in Table 12, Panel B. Using the original\nbaseline regression approach, we redefine our treatment variable USAGE to represent\nthe scale of funding received for German IBHC banks only, and zero for all other banks.\nWhereas the estimated coefficients indicate qualitatively identical results compared to\nthe baseline, the exclusion of two affiliates of U.S. IBHCs and six affiliates of other than\nGerman or U.S. IBHCs prohibit the precise estimation of these effects.\n4.6.4 Effect on German IBHC heads\nU.S. funding support possibly had an even stronger effect on head companies of German\nIBHCs with an affiliate in the U.S. Unlike the other banks in the IBHC, they have direct\ncontrol over the U.S. affiliate, and therefore a more direct access to the provided liquidity.\nWe therefore restrict our banks with access to the heads of German IBHCs (subsample\ne) in Figure 5) and analyze the effect compared to the original control group in Table\n13, Panel A. Results support our baseline findings, with both increased significance and\nmagnitude for short-term rates. This suggests that German IBHC heads lowered their\nshort-term deposit rates and short-term rates by more than their respective subsidiaries,\nindicating that they exert more control over the received liquidity.\nIn analogy, we restrict our sample in Panel B to all banks of German IBHCs with\naffiliates in the U.S. to analyze the difference in impact between direct funding access\n(heads) and indirect access (subsidiaries). The new sample consists of subsamples e) and\nf) in Figure 5. The variable USAGE in this context remains the share of funds obtained for\nhead companies, and is zero for subsidiaries. The coefficient of interest is then significantly\nnegative, indicating that direct access to U.S. facilities relative to indirect access yields\nstatistically significant responses in terms of corporate deposit rates. Possibly, internal\ncapital markets are less efficient in re-allocating liquidity compared to the possibility of\nmore direct transfers.\n4.7 Further robustness of results\nNext to the arguably critical definition of which banks had access to U.S. emergency\nfacilities, we conducted a number of further robustness tests that are available in the\nOnline Appendix. We briefly summarize the main upshots here.\nAn important confounding factor in explaining interest rate setting, next to liquid-\nity provisions, might be unobserved differences in credit and deposit demand that banks\nface in regional markets. We therefore also specified regional unemployment as well as\nstate\u00d7quarter fixed effects to gauge such unobservable factors. Results remain qualita-\ntively identical.\nNext, we exclude one-by-one large banks from the commercial, the savings bank,\nand the cooperative bank sector, respectively, because these IBHCs themselves might be\ndriving the results. We also exclude all pairs of two from these large banking groups. In\nboth tests, the results remain qualitatively identical.\n5 Conclusions\nWe test if the usage of U.S. emergency facilities that were available to affiliates of for-\neign banks between December 2007 until April 2010 were transmitted via internal capital\nmarkets of international bank holding companies (IBHC), thereby affecting interest rate\nsetting outside the U.S. banking market. To test for this international interest rate trans-\nmission, we combine detailed data about which banks used which type of U.S. liquidity\nassistance to what extent for how long that was released by the Federal Reserve System\nin 2011, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) ruling in favour of the press\nnetwork Bloomberg L.P. We hand-collect for banks that used the Fed liquidity support\nlines their connection to IBHCs that also operated banks in Germany. For this market,\ndetailed information on the monthly pricing of new lending and deposit taking is reported\nby a representative sample of banks to the German central bank since January 2004.\nWe use a difference-in-difference set-up to compare whether banks with access to\nU.S. liquidity through the internal capital markets of their IBHC passed more favorable\nfunding conditions at the group level on to their German operations. We find that short-\nterm deposit rates exhibit a significant, contemporaneous decline in response to the usage\nof U.S. liquidity facilities compared to German banks without access to these funding\nsources. Short-term credit rates do not decline contemporaneously, but decline with a lag\nof two to four months. Thus, unorthodox U.S. monetary policy did not only succeed in\nreducing funding pressure in the U.S., but also helped to alleviate such constraints abroad\nin a large, developed banking system like Germany.\nWe do not find any evidence of a response in long-term rates, neither on deposits from\nnor loans demanded by German corporate customers. This result indicates that U.S.\nliquidity assistance did not reduce long-term risk premia outside the home market.\nThese results are also confirmed when considering banks with particularly large U.S.\nfunding pressure due to large pre-crisis ABCP market exposures, matched samples of\nbanks without access to U.S. liquidity assistance via internal capital markets, alternative\nrandom treatment allocation schemes, as well as four variants of how to define membership\nin an IBHC.\nIn sum, our results support the view that unorthodox monetary policy in the form of\nemergency liquidity assistance in the U.S. also transmitted via internal capital markets of\nIBHCs to other developed markets, and helped to alleviate short-term funding pressure.\nReferences\nAcharya, V., I.
