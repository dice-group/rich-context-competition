Newly developed quantile regression methods are used in analysing data from the March\nCurrent Population Survey. The results show that while the most signi\u00aecant changes for the less skilled\nwomen took place at the bottom of the wage distribution, for the more skilled groups changes occurred at\nboth ends of the distribution. Consequently, wage inequality decreased for the high-school graduates and\nincreased for the younger college graduates. Furthermore, the more highly skilled women experienced the\nsteepest gain in wages regardless of their position in the distribution. # 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nThe US economy and its position in the world witnessed rapid changes in the past two decades,\nespecially during the 1980s. Much recent research in labour economics is devoted to the invest-\nigation of the eects of these changes on the US wage structure.1 While researchers have not\nignored the female labour force, most studies have concentrated on the male labour force.2\nThe growing importance of the female labour force goes far beyond greater participation, to\ntheir \u00aelling positions requiring more responsibilities and skills. Traditional family and household\nduties still place more constraints on women than on men, but more married women are pursuing\nindependent careers. These developments in the commitment of women to participation in the\nlabour force have led to signi\u00aecant changes in the wage distribution, especially relative to men.\nFor example, O'Neill and Polachek (1993) and Blau and Kahn (1992a) \u00aend that: (1) the decline in\nthe women\u00b1men wage gap is due in part to the increases in the return to experience for women;\nand (2) approximately one quarter of the convergence is due to an increase in education and\nexperience.\n* Correspondence to: M. Buchinsky,  .\nE-mail: buchins@econ.pstc.brown.edu.\nContract grant sponsor: NSF\n2 Goldin (1990) gives a detailed investigation of many aspects of the female labour force over the last few decades.\nUsing a percentile ranking method, Blau and Kahn (1992b) compare the women\u00b1men wage\ngap in the USA to other industrialized countries. They \u00aend that the rank method places the USA\nat the very top, while the traditional mean ratio places it towards the bottom. They attribute this\n\u00aending to the fact that the widening wage inequality for men is due mainly to a longer tail at the\nbottom of the distribution.\nThis paper examines the female wage structure by refocusing the attention to changes at\ndierent points in the wage distribution. I analyse changes in the conditional log wage quantiles\nand within-group wage inequality for women in nine age groups, between 20 and 64 years, and\n\u00aeve cohorts (that can be followed throughout the sample period). The data come from the March\nselection bias is corrected in a non-parametric fashion using a two-step procedure similar to that\nThe results portray several important \u00aendings. The \u00aerst-stage estimation indicates that\ntraditional family and household duties played a less signi\u00aecant role in the late 1980s than at the\nbeginning of the sample period. It is also found that the traditional probit estimates dier\nconsiderably from the semiparametric least-squares estimates.\nThe results for the wage oer equation indicate that over time there are signi\u00aecant dierential\nchanges in the conditional quantiles, and consequently wage inequality, across the various skill\ngroups. Most of the action for the lower skill groups and cohorts took place at the bottom of the\nwage distribution. For the more skilled groups, signi\u00aecant changes occurred at the top of the\ndistribution as well. Consequently, the younger and less educated groups experienced a greater\nreduction in wage inequality. The results indicate that there are signi\u00aecant sample selection biases\nfor all age groups, mostly at the low quantiles of the wage distribution in the early sample years.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the\nmethods for making the data consistent over time. The economic model underlying the estima-\ntion and related methodological issues are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the empirical\nresults, while Section 5 summarizes and concludes. An Appendix gives a brief heuristic justi\u00aeca-\ntion for the econometric methods used in the paper.\nThe empirical analysis in this study is based on an extract from the March CPS for 1968, 1973,\nde\u00aened here as working if: (1) she worked for at least two weeks; and (2) her total earned income\nwas positive. All nominal data are de\u00afated by the implicit price de\u00afator of personal consumption\nexpenditure for gross national income.4 The total number of observations and the percentage of\nworking women are reported in Table I.\nMassive changes in the sampling frame, coverage, and imputation methods make the CPS data\ndicult to use prior to 1975. Furthermore, prior to 1975 some of the variables were only\nbracketed. For example, the number of weeks worked \u00d0 a vital variable to this analysis \u00d0 is\nreported in only seven categories. To deal with this problem I adopt the same imputation method\nsuggested in Buchinsky (1994), whereby the variable `weeks worked last year' is imputed using\n3 Since most of the relevant questions in the March CPS refer to the year preceding the sample year, the dates in this\nstudy are the actual years to which the questions referred (i.e. the CPS year 1968 is referred to in this study as 1967, etc.).\neducation.5\nAs shown in Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993), the changes made in the sampling, coverage and\nimputation techniques mainly aect the top and bottom 10% of the wage distribution. Since this\nalso holds true after controlling for education and experience, these changes need not introduce\nany bias as they do for mean regressions.\nAnother problem is that the CPS does not provide data for actual work experience. It is well\nknown (e.g. O'Neill and Polachek, 1993) that potential experience (computed as age\u00c0years of\nschooling\u00c06) is not a good proxy for women's actual experience. Hence, as is explained in detail\nin Section 4, some additional adjustments are required.\nOther data sources, such as the PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) and the NLS\n(National Longitudinal Survey), provide more detailed information about labour market\nattributes of women, but suer from other problems (such as attrition). For the non-parametric\nmethods employed here the CPS data are more useful as they provide large samples which are\nnecessary in obtaining parameter estimates with reasonable precision.\nThe model estimated here can be traced back to the seminal paper by Gronau (1974) on the\nselectivity bias induced by the job search process. In the context of quantile regression (for the\nwidely used linear form for wage oer) the conditional quantile of observed wages depends,\namong other things, on a bias term of an unknown form which cannot be corrected using the\ntraditional parametric correction for sample selection. Therefore I resort to a non-parametric\nTable I.

Women reported as `working without pay' are not included.\n5 As indicated in Buchinsky (1994, 1995b) this imputation has proven to be very reliable. The estimated coecients from\nquantile (and mean) regressions that use the imputed values of `weeks worked last year' dier by less than one standard\nerror from those obtained from the actual data for the years after 1977. A detailed description of the imputation method\nis provided in an appendix in Buchinsky (1994). This appendix, as well as the actual MATLAB programs which do the\nimputation, are available from the author upon request.\nFirst, consider the reservation wage equation. Each individual has a reservation wage which is a\nfunction of her characteristics in addition to an idiosyncratic term:\nyR\ni\n g\nR\nx\nY a\n  v\ni\nwhere (omitting the i subscript) x\nis an l \u00c2 1 vector of characteristics. It is assumed that\nE(v j x\n)  Med(v j x\n)  0. I further simplify the g\nR\nfunction to be g\nR\n(x\n; a\n  xH\na\n. The wage\noer is assumed to depend linearly on a set of labour market characteristics:\ny*\ni\n xH\nb\n u\ni\nwhere the wage oer y* is observed only if the individual accepted it, i.e. y*\ni\ni\n. It is assumed\nthat: (a) Med(u\ni\nj x\n)  0; (b) x\nis a subset of x\n; and (c) x\nincludes at least one continuous\nvariable that is not included in x\n. Rewriting equation (2) in the quantile regression form\nconsidered by Koenker and Bassett (1978) gives\ny*  xH\nb\ny\n u\ny\nwhere u\ny\n xH\nb\n\u00c0 b\ny\n  u. It is assumed that the conditional quantile of y*, conditional on x\n,\nsatis\u00aees Quant\ny\n y j x\n  xH\nb\ny\n, so that Quant\ny\n(u\ny\nj x\n)  0. This implies that Z\ny\n Quant\ny\nu j x\n\n \u00c0xH\nb\n\u00c0 b\ny\n.\nSince the wage oer is observed only if it exceeds the reservation wage, we have\ny  d . y*  dxH\nb\ny\n u\ny\n, where d  I( y* 4 yR) and I ( . ) is the usual indicator function. In the\npresence of this selection mechanism the conditional quantile of the observed wage is given by\nQuant\ny\n y j x\n  Quant\ny\n y* j x\nY d  1  xHb\ny\n Quant\ny\nu\ny\nj x\nand, in general, Quant\ny\n(u\ny\nj x\n, d  1) T 0. Nevertheless, if the quantity Quant\ny\n(u\ny\nj x\n, d  1) is\nonly a function of a known index g, then the observed wage equation can be written as\ny  xH\nb\ny\n h\ny\ng  e\ny\nwhere h\ny\n(g)  Quant\ny\n(u\ny\nj x\n, y* 4 yR), and, by construction, Quant(e\nyi\nj x\ni\n, d\ni\nNote that the probability of working can be written as\nPD  Pr y* 5 yR j x\n  Pre 4 gx\nY a\nY b\n j x\nwhere e  v 7 u and g(x\n; a\n, b\n)  \u00c0xH\na\n xH\nb\n xH\ng\n, g\n\u00c0 a\nequals b\nwith\nentries of zeros added in places where the variables in x\ndo not appear in x\n. The following two\nassumptions ensure that PD is only a function of g and that the representation in equation (4)\nholds.\nAssumption C continuity X w  vY uH has a continuous densityX\nAssumption E dependence of w and x\n X f\nw\n \u00c1 j x\n  f\nw\n \u00c1 j gx\nY g\nX\nAssumption E implies that PD, in equation (5), and F\nu\ny\n(s j x\n)  Pr(u\ny\n), depend only on g,\nand therefore equation (4) holds.7 Assumption C implies that h( . ) is also a continuous and\nincreasing function in g.\n7 Note that v and u are allowed to depend on a common error, e.g. v  (x  v*)f\n(g) and u  (x  u*)f\n(g).\nSince the function h\ny\n(g) in equation (4) is unknown, it is approximated by a series expansion,\nfollowing a two-step procedure similar to that introduced by Heckman (1980) and Newey (1991).\nIn the \u00aerst step the selection parameter g\nis estimated. In the second step a quantile regression\nis run on x\nand on an estimate of h\ny\n(g), h\u00c3(g)  h(g\u00c3).\nFirst-step estimation \u00d0 the SLS estimator\nThe semiparametric least-squares (SLS) estimator suggested by Ichimura (1993) is given by\n\ng  arg min\ngP`l\nn\n\nn\nd\ni\n\u00c0 \nEd\ni\nj x\nwhere E\n\u00c3 (d\ni\nj x\n, g) is the (non-parametric) kernel estimate for E(d\ni\nj x\n, g):\n\nEd\ni\nj x\nY g \n\njTi\ny\nj\nkxH\ni\ng \u00c0 xH\nj\ngah\nn\n\n\njTi\nkxH\ni\ng \u00c0 xH\nj\ngah\nn\n\nk(.) is the kernel function and h\nn\nis the bandwidth.8\nThis estimator is\n\nn\np\n-consistent and asymptotic normal with an asymptotic covariance\nL\ng\n O71SO71, where O  E[DDH], S  E[s2(x)DDH], s2(x)  Var( y j x), and\nD \ndFgx\nY g\n\ndg\ndgx\nY g\n\ndg\ndgx\nY g\n\ndg\nj gx\nY g\n\n !\nThe coecient vector \ng is obtained in two rounds using the Nelder\u00b1Mead algorithm.

The results presented here are based on a power series, that is, P\nSj\ng  l\nm  \nwhere l(.)  f(.)/F(.) is the usual inverse Mill's ratio.13\nAs in Heckman and Honore\nconstant term in the wage regression is identi\u00aeed here from the sub-population for which the\nprobability of participation is close to one. I adopt here the idea suggested by Andrews and\nSchafgans for the estimation of the constant term in mean regression. The procedure was carried\nout as follows.\nPartition b\ny\ninto bH\ny\n b\nY b*\ny\nH, where b\nis the constant coecient and bH\ny\nincludes all the\nslope coecients. Similarly, partition x\ninto x\n x\nY x*\nH. Let e\ni\n y\ni\n\u00c0 x*\nH \nb*\ny\n, where \nb*\ny\nis\nthe estimate of b*\ny\nfrom equation (7) above.

The estimate for f(g) is obtained from a smoothed version of F\u00c3(.), in which monotonicity\nin the index g is imposed, using Ramsay's (1988) spline regression technique.\n13 The normalization of g\ni\nby \nm  \nsg\ni\nis done to make it location and scale equivariant, since the semiparametric\nidenti\u00aecation of g\nrequires scale and location normalization. Natural choices for \nm and \ns are the constant and\nslope coecients from the probit regression of d\ni\non the index g(x\n, \ng). Other power series that were considered\ninclude: (i) P\nSj\nm  \nsgj\u00c01; (ii) P\nSj\n(g)  gj71; and (iii) P\nSj\n(g)  ( f\u00c3(g)/F\u00c3(g))j71, where f\u00c3(.) and F\u00c3(.) are the non-\nparametric estimates of the density and c.d.f. of e\ni\n, respectively. See also Abramowitz and Stegum (1972).\nwhere r\ny\n(l)  (y 7 I(l 5 0))l is the familiar check function, I(.) is the usual indicator function,\nn\ncan be viewed as the bandwidth parameter.

As is clearly seen from Table I, the participation rate of\nwomen in the labour force has increased markedly across all age groups, from about 58% in 1967\nto over 73% by 1989, with the larger increases in the younger age groups. Many more women\nwere engaged in professional, technical, and managerial occupations in 1989 (31.8%) than in\n1967 (only 17.9%), while the percentage of working women in the `traditional' female occupa-\ntions declined signi\u00aecantly. Changes in the commitment of women towards active participation\nin the labour force and in the attitude of American society towards working women have led to\nvast changes in the women's wage structure, exceeding those in the economy. These changes are\nre\u00afected in the results presented in the next two sub-sections.16\n4.1. First-step Estimation \u00d0 The Participation Equation\nThe selection equation, i.e. the probability that a woman participates in the labour force, is\nestimated using the common approach described in Mroz (1987).

However, they seem to be\nmore important for the younger age groups and more signi\u00aecantly so in the early years than at the\nend of the sample period. But even for these age groups it is signi\u00aecant only in the early sample\nyears. Having young children (under the age of 6) has a more signi\u00aecant impact on women's\nprobability of working. Nevertheless, this eect, as well, was found to be more signi\u00aecant in the\n18 The de\u00aenition of a family unit is according to the 1981 CPS. An appropriate adjustment is made for the years prior to\n1981. Non-earned income includes all sources of income other than work-related transfers or direct income from wages\nand salaries. The variable `number of children in the family' includes only one's own children. The dummy variable for\nrace takes the value 1 if the individual is white, and 0 otherwise. The dummy variable for the metropolitan area takes the\nvalue 1 if an individual lives in the CPS standard statistical metropolitan area (SMSA), and 0 otherwise.

The probit estimate for this coecient was highly signi\u00aecant in all years and\nchanged very little, in absolute terms, over the sample years. This makes the comparison of the normalized coecients\nmore meaningful.

The availability of more adequate daycare is one possible explanation for this\napparent change in the importance of having young children on the probability of working. In\naddition, the signi\u00aecant rise in women's real wages also makes it more likely that a woman be\noered a wage exceeding her reservation wage. The estimates for the older age groups are not very\nprecise and give weaker evidence as to the eect of having children on the participation decision.\nIn general, the family income variables, other family income, and personal non-earned income\nhave signi\u00aecant negative impacts on the participation probability. As can be seen from the table,\nthe point estimates for other income become larger, in absolute terms, for the younger groups\nover time, while other family income becomes less signi\u00aecant. This indicates that the probability\nof participation is not aected purely by the availability of more resources in the family. This\napparent result might re\u00afect a few known facts about the younger age groups at the same point\nin their life cycle as their older counterparts: (1) they have dierent expectations for their career\npath; and (2) pursuing a career is a goal by itself, therefore substantially reducing their\nreservation wages.\nThere are noticeable dierences in the participation behaviour for whites and non-whites. For\nthe youngest age group represented in Table II (25\u00b129) a white woman in 1967 was much more\nlikely to work than a non-white woman. The completely opposite phenomenon is apparent at the\nend of the sample period. This apparent change is less clear for the older age groups as the point\nestimates toward the end of the sample year are statistically indistinguishable from 0. Marital\nstatus and geographical location (not reported here) have only a marginal eect on the\nprobability of working with no particular pattern of changes either across the various age groups\nor across the sample years.\nAs can be seen from Table II, the signi\u00aecant changes in some of the coecients imply\nsigni\u00aecant changes in the corresponding elasticities. The elasticities with respect to family size\nand the number of children under age 6 dropped signi\u00aecantly over the sample years. In contrast,\nthe elasticity of other sources of income (personal and family) \u00afuctuated over the years with no\nclear pattern of change. Note that the educational attainments have a larger impact on the\nparticipation probability for all age groups, and especially for the younger age groups. This might\nre\u00afect the fact that as women have a longer participation horizon in the labour market over their\nlife time, they have a greater incentive to invest more in their own human capital.\nTesting for equality of the non-parametric and probit estimates\nSince the non-parametric and/or semiparametric methods are highly computer intensive, one\nmust ask the simple question: `Is it worth it?'21 A visual comparison of the SLS estimates with\nthose obtained for the probit model shows that they are of the same order of magnitude and have\nthe same signs. Yet dierences of 10\u00b130% are apparent for most age groups in most years. Test\nstatistics for Hausman's test reported in Table III clearly indicate that for most age groups in\nmost years the null hypothesis of normal errors is clearly rejected at the 5% signi\u00aecance level.\nIn order to verify that the general rejection of the null hypothesis is not simply an artifact of the\nsubjective choices (bandwidth, etc.) made, I computed an alternative test statistic, in which V\u00c01\nSLS\nreplaces (V\nSLS\nP\nSLS\nd. This test statistic severely penalizes the alternative\nhypothesis when true, and may have no power at all. However, even this test overwhelmingly\nrejected the null hypothesis for almost all age groups and years. While a rejection of the null\n21 For comparison, the estimation using the SLS procedure takes between 3 to 5 hours for each age group, while the\nestimation of the probit model, with similar speci\u00aecations, takes a few seconds.\nhypothesis may be indicative (but not conclusive evidence) of non-normal errors, it might not\naect the predicted participation probabilities and/or the quantile regression estimates.\nTo examine these aspects I performed two additional sensitivity tests. In the \u00aerst test I examine\nwhether or not the two sets of predicted probabilities (from the two alternative estimation\nprocedures) are statistically dierent from each other. The well-known Pearson test led to general\nrejection of the null hypothesis in about half the age group\u00b1years compositions (23 out of the\ntotal 45 cases) at the 5% signi\u00aecance level. In the second test I computed two sets of quantile\nregressions only for these 23 groups. In the \u00aerst set I used the probit predicted probability to form\nthe series expansion, while in the second set I used the SLS probability estimates. I then\nconstructed con\u00aedence regions for the true parameter vectors based on the second set of quantile\nregression estimates. In 21 out of the 23 cases these con\u00aedence regions did not cover the quantile\nregression estimates associated with the probit estimates. For these reasons I report only the set of\nquantile regression estimates based on series expansions using the SLS estimates.\nTo assess and verify the applicability of the model estimated here I performed two additional\nsensitivity analyses. First, I tested the applicability of a simple multiplicative heteroscedasticity\nmodel, similar to the one suggested by Koenker and Bassett (1982). I assume that the error\nstructure takes the form: v  (v*  x)(1  l\ng) and u  (u*  x)(1  l\ng). The estimation of this\nmodel was carried out using the minimum distance framework as outlined in Buchinsky (1995c).\nThe heteroscedasticity model was generally rejected, particularly for the younger age groups.22\nThis indicates that the error distribution depends on the single index g in a more complicated way\nthan is permitted by the above heteroscedasticity model.\nIn the second sensitivity analysis I examined the key issue of the dependence of the error term\non x\nonly through the single index. To do that I estimated the model for each of the age groups,\nadding (in addition to the series expansion terms) polynomial functions of individual variables\nfrom the selection equation. The estimated parameter vectors from this experiment remained\nvirtually unchanged relative to those with only polynomials of the single index g. These results\nseem to indicate that, in general, the error term does depend only on the single index g(x\n; a\n, b\n),\nor, in other words, that Assumption E is satis\u00aeed.\nTable III. Hausman's test for equality of the semiparametric least-squares (SLS) and the probit estimates\nAge group\nNote: Ichimura's (1993) SLS estimator is used.

Second-step Estimation \u00d0 The Wage Oer Equation\nThe second-step estimation of the wage equation includes only the working women.23 The model\nestimated is a version of Mincer's (1974) model, similar to that considered in numerous other\nstudies in the literature. In contrast to previous studies, the focus here is on the characterization of\nchanges at various points of the conditional log wage distribution.\nThe dependent variable in the analysis is the log of weekly wages.24 The independent variables\ncontrol for personal characteristics (education and experience) and geographical location, and\nare a subset of the independent variables from the selection equation.25\nO'Neill and Polachek (1993, Tables 3 and 4) report that for the PSID data, the proportion of\nactual to potential experience is between 0.65 and 0.80. The implied ratios estimated using the\nadjustment factor discussed above are well within this range, with larger ratios for the younger\nwomen than for the older groups. Furthermore, the returns to experience are closer to those\nreported by O'Neill and Polachek for the PSID data using actual experience than to the estimates\nusing the CPS data without the adjustments to potential experience. This suggests that the\nreported estimates are not systematically biased in any particular fashion.\nSeveral mean and quantile regressions, with and without correction for sample selection, were\nconsidered. The quantile regressions were estimated at \u00aeve representative quantiles, namely the\nvalidation technique, suggests that for the data at hand, two terms of orthogonal polynomials\nshould be included in the series expansion.26\nIn addition to analysing changes at dierent quantiles of the wage oer distribution, I also\nexamine changes in two measures of within-group wage inequality formed as the dierence\nbetween conditional quantiles. The 90-10 measure (and similarly the 75-25 measure) is de\u00aened\nas the dierence between the 0.90 and the 0.10 conditional quantiles. These measures are\nfurther decomposed into two half-spreads relative to the conditional median of the distribution.\nAnalysing these measures allows one to directly identify which part of the distribution contri-\nbutes more to the overall inequality.\nChanges in the conditional quantiles\nThe estimated conditional quantiles and means of log weekly wage are provided in Table IV for\nhigh school and college graduates for several representative age groups. Note that the results are\n23 To make the data selection comparable with other studies I excluded self-employed from the analysis. Nevertheless, the\nproportion of self-employed was quite small in all years and excluding them from the analysis has virtually no eect on\nthe results.\n24 More precisely, this variable is de\u00aened as the log of the ratio between total earnings from wages and salaries and the\nnumber of weeks a person worked.\n25 The variables include: education, experience, experience squared, experience interacted with education and the number\nof children in the family, experienced squared interacted with the number of children in the family, a dummy variable for\nwhite women, a set of geographical division dummy variables, a metropolitan area dummy variable, and a set of marital\nstatus dummy variables. Omitted from the regression are the family characteristic variables, including the other sources\nof income variables and those related to the number of children at various age groups. These exclusion restrictions,\ntogether with the assumption made in the previous section, allow one to identify all the coecients from the wage oer\nequation.\n26 This is consistent with Newey, Powell, and Walker (1990), who reported that the same cross-validation technique led\nthem to include two terms in their analysis of Mroz's (1987) data. Addition of more terms to the series expansion\nresulted, in some cases, in severe multicollinearity problems.\nTable IV.

MM and the corrected quantile estimates are based on the\ninverse Mill's series approximation with two terms.\nfor the inverse Mill's ratio series expansion.27 The conditional quantiles are evaluated at the\nmedian values of the variables, except for the dummy variables. The latter variables are evaluated\nat the mean values over the entire period.28 Figures 1 and 2 depict the results for the two\neducation groups for a few representative age groups.\nAs can be clearly seen from Table IV and the accompanying \u00aegures, the conditional quantiles\nchanged quite dierently both across the various age groups, at any education level, and for the\ntwo education levels, for any given age group. A common result for all age-education groups is\nthe general upward bias of the estimated conditional quantiles; a phenomenon most pronounced\nfor the lower quantiles at the early sample years, when the participation rate was relatively low.\nThis is consistent with the economic model outlined above; we are more likely to observe those\nwomen with wage oers at the upper end of the distribution as their participation probabilities\nare higher. The results suggest that as wages increased considerably at all quantiles, more women\nwho obtain wage oers even at the lower end of the distribution will choose to work.\nNote that the bias tends to be larger for the middle-range age groups (25\u00b144) than for the very\nyoung (20\u00b124) or older groups (45). For the younger group, some of the individuals are still in\ncollege and will not join the labour force, giving up potentially higher earnings in the future,\nunless they were oered a relatively high wage. Women in the older groups, who are out of the\nlabour force, are also likely to be with a short work history, and are therefore likely to be oered a\nrelatively low wage which, in turn, induces them to stay out of the active labour force.\nFigures 1 and 2 seem to indicate that there is a more systematic upward trend, most pro-\nnounced at the upper quantiles, for the most highly educated individuals. Furthermore, there is a\nsigni\u00aecant upward shift of the level of the conditional quantiles, which increased over time in\nfavour of the groups with higher educational attainments. Note also that the conditional mean\nfor all educational groups, and more so for the more highly educated groups, is consistently\nbelow the conditional median. Nevertheless, they do exhibit the same general pattern of change\nas the conditional medians.\nWithin-group wage inequality \u00d0 age group analysis\nTable V reports the 90-10 and 75-25 inequality measures for the two education groups as before,\nwhile Figure 3 depicts these measures for a few selected age groups. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) for the\nhigh school graduates show that there are signi\u00aecant dierences in the level of these measures\namong the various age groups. Both measures of inequality tend to be larger for the middle age\ngroups than for the other groups, with a clearer pattern of downward trend. Nevertheless, a\nsigni\u00aecant decline is observed for all groups over the entire sample period.

Note that the general downward trends in the inequality measures for all\n27 For the conditional means I also provide estimates based on the traditional inverse Mill's ratio, which uses the probit\nestimates. The inverse Mill's ratio approximation series uses the SLS estimates of the participation probability. The \u00aerst is\nvalid only if the underlying error terms are normally distributed. The results for the other approximation series are\nomitted for brevity.\n28 Evaluating the dummy variables at their mean values gives one representative number, for each conditional quantile,\naveraged over all geographical divisions, marital statuses, and race.\nFigure 1.

Note that lower levels of inequality are observed for the younger\nand older groups. Again, changes at the lower end of the distribution dominated the pattern of\nchange in the inequality measures.

It turns out that the\ngeneral trends are quite similar for the two education groups, with a clearer pattern for the college\ngraduates.

In particular, the more highly skilled women, who also have a\ngreater commitment to participating in the labour force, gained more than their older counter-\nparts. Signi\u00aecant dierences between the corresponding conditional quantiles of college gradu-\nates and high school graduates, for all cohorts, indicate that after a drop during the early part of\nFigure 4. Within-group inequality measures for college graduate cohorts\nthe sample, there were signi\u00aecant increases in all conditional quantiles for the college graduates\nrelative to the high school graduates. That is, the wage distribution of college graduates\ndominates that of high school graduates for all cohorts, most signi\u00aecantly toward the end of the\nsample period.\nMost recent research on changes in the US wage structure, and particularly on changes in the\nreturn to skills, have concentrated on the male labour force and were restricted, generally, to\nmean type analyses. Studies which investigate changes aecting the entire distribution need to\nincorporate techniques which allow examination of changes at distinct points of the distribution.\nI use quantile regression techniques with non-parametric correction for sample selection to\nanalyse changes in the conditional wage distribution for women using the March Current\nallows me to compute measures of wage inequality at dierent ranges of the distribution.\nThe estimation is carried out in two steps. First, a single linear index model is estimated using a\nsemiparametric least-squares estimator proposed by Ichimura (1993). Key results from the \u00aerst-\nstage estimation are: (1) traditional family and household duties play a lesser role as time\nprogresses; (2) these duties seem to be more important for the younger age groups than they are\nfor the older age groups; and (3) there are signi\u00aecant dierences between the SLS and the probit\nestimates for almost all age groups and years.\nIn the second step, the estimated single index is used to form a series approximation for the\nunknown selection bias term. In the estimation of the wage oer, a version of the traditional\nMincer's (1974) model is adopted. The estimation is carried out for nine age groups, at \u00aeve-year\nwell as for a mean regression. The results indicate that there is less variation, and more consistent\nincreases in the higher conditional quantiles for the more educated groups. Signi\u00aecant increases\nat the lower quantiles are observed for all age groups. The result of this phenomenon is a decrease\nin wage inequality for all women, especially for the less skilled. For the college graduate group in\nparticular, there were more pronounced increases in the top quantiles but they were accompanied\nby the same sharp increases in the lower conditional quantiles. A common result for all age\ngroups is the severe upward sample selection bias, especially at the lower quantiles. Nevertheless,\nthis bias became much smaller over time as more women entered the labour market.\nThe results for the \u00aeve cohorts that can be followed throughout the sample show that there are\nsigni\u00aecant dierences in the way the inequality measures have changed and particulary the way\nthe two half-spreads composing each measure have changed. The most pronounced decreases in\nwage inequality are observed for the high school graduate group, while for the younger college\ngraduates there were signi\u00aecant increases in wage inequality through most of the sample period.\nThe results also indicate that highly quali\u00aeed women have gained a lot in terms of wages,\nconditional on their characteristics, regardless of their position in the distribution.\nb\ny\nThe method employed here can be intuitively explained as follows. If the selection term h\ny\n(g) was\nknown, then one could simply include it in the quantile regression (in addition to x\n) to obtain\na consistent estimate for b\ny\n. Since h\ny\n(g) is unknown, it is approximated by a polynomial\nseries: P(g)  d\n d\nf(g)  . . .  d\nyS\nf S(g). As the sample size increases one needs to increase\nthe number of terms in this series. Asymptotically, P(g) approximates h(g) arbitrarily closely.\nFor the purpose of inference, one needs to compute, L\nb\ny\n, the covariance matrix of \nb\ny\n. This can\nbe accomplished by taking S as \u00aexed and forming a covariance matrix for \nbH\ny\nY \ndH\ny\n as if they were\nsimple coecient estimates in the yth quantile regression of y on x\nand ( f(g), . . . , f S(g)).\nOne complication is that without further assumptions the constant b\nin b\ny\ncannot be\nseparately identi\u00aeed from d\n. However, as is explained in the text, b\ncan be identi\u00aeed if there is\na subset of observations for which the participation probability was arbitrarily close to 1. In the\n\u00aerst part of this Appendix I describe how to obtain the asymptotic distribution for the slope\ncoecients of the estimated vector \nb\ny\n. Then I describe how to obtain the asymptotic distribution\nfor the estimated coecient \nb\n, corresponding to the constant term in the wage oer equation.\nPartition b\ny\ninto bH\ny\n b\nY b*\ny\nH, where b*\ny\nH  (b\n, . . . , b\nyk\n), and similarly partition x\ninto\nxH\n x\nY x*\nH, where x*\nH  (x\n, . . . , x\n).

Then, by the mean value theorem applied to the \u00aerst-order conditions for \nZ\ny\nwe have\nn\n\nn\nc\naY Z\ny\n \ndc\namY Zm\n\nZ\ny\ny\n \ndc\namY Zm\ndaH\n\na \u00c0 a\n\n!\nwhere am is on the line segment connecting a\nand \na, Zm is on the line segment connecting \nZ\ny\nand\nZ\ny\n, and where c\n(a, Z) is short-hand notation for c\n(z\ni\n, a, Z).\nFrom equation (A2) it follows that\n\nn\np\n\nZ\ny\ny\n can be expressed as\n\nn\np\n\nZ\ny\ny\n  \u00c0\nn\n\nn\ndc\namY Zm\n\nn\np\n\nn\nc\na\n \u00c0\nn\n\nn\ndc\namY Zm\ndaH\n\nn\np\n\na \u00c0 a\n\nBy the law of large numbers, and the fact that\n\np\na\nand \nZ\ny\np\nZ\ny\nit follows that\nn\n\nn\ndc\namY Zm\np\nE\ndc\na\ny\n\n!\n D\nn\n\nn\ndc\namY Zm\ndaH\np\nE\ndc\na\ny\n\ndaH\n!\n D\nand, by the central limit theorem, that\n\nn\np\n\nn\nc\na\ny\nv\n where D\n Ec\na\ny\ncH\na\ny\nSince\n\nn\np\n\na \u00c0 a\nv\na\n\nand\n\nn\np\n\n\nn\nc\na\ny\n\nand\n\nn\np\n\na \u00c0 a\n are asymptotically uncorrelated, we have from equations (A2)\u00b1(A6) and\nSlutsky's theorem that\n\nn\np\n\nZ\ny\ny\nv\nZy\n\nwhere L\nZy\nD\n D\nL\na\nDH\n.\nHere, c\n(.) is not dierentiable everywhere w.r.t. a and Z.

Substitution of the\nderivatives of E[c\n(a\n, Z\ny\n)] w.r.t. a and Z, for c\n(.) given in equation (A1) into (A7) gives\nL\nZ\ny\nfr\nrr\n D\nfrx\nL\na\nDH\nfrx\nfr\nwhere\nD\nfr\n Edf\ne\ny\n0 j rrrHY D\nfrx\n Edf\ne\ny\ny\nrxH\nrr\n EdrrH\nand H(g)  dh(g)/dg.
