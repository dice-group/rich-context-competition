Participants were asked to explore a virtual park while learning 15 new Czech verbs (action verbs that\ndescribe movements performed with either the hand or the foot, and abstract verbs). This learning condition was compared\nwith a baseline condition, where movements (either virtual or real) were not allowed. The goal was to investigate whether\nthe virtual action (performed with the feet) would promote or interfere with the learning of verbs describing actions that\nwere performed with the same or a different effector. The number of verbs correctly remembered in a free recall task was\ncomputed, along with reaction times and number of errors during a recognition task. Results show that the simulation per\nse has no effect in verbal learning, but the features of the virtual experience mediate it.\n",

During the last\ndecade, several articles have been published reporting the\ninvolvement of the motor (Buccino et al., 2005; Gerfo et al.,\nmotor cortices (Boulenger, Hauk, & Pulvermuller, 2009;\nHauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermuller, 2004; Kemmerer, Castillo,\nWillems, Labruna, D'Esposito, Ivry, & Casasanto, 2011)\nduring language processing. Language learning is a cogni-\ntive ability that entangles language and memory, and is suit-\nable for investigation within this theoretical frame. In fact, it\nhas been highlighted that foreign language learning is\nenhanced by linking verbal and action information (see\nMacedonia & von Kriegstein, 2012, for an extensive review).\nHow to investigate this link poses an interesting method-\nological question. We know that verbal information is usu-\nally communicated by words or sentences, whereas action\ninformation is derived from gestures. After a review of the\nkey points of traditional studies on action information and\nlanguage learning, the present study will focus on the feasi-\nbility of using simulation as an alternative, innovative\nmethod to explore these same processes.\nThe impact of gestures on verbal memory has been stud-\nied for decades as gestures are fundamental in second\nlanguage acquisition. Engelkamp and Zimmer (1985), for\nexample, reported that the recall of action words or sentences\nis improved if, during the learning phase, the subjects panto-\nmime the corresponding action. These results emerged by\ncomparing the language acquisition rate to a control condi-\ntion in which subjects could only hear/read the action items.\nThis \"enactment effect\" not only increased the number of\nitems correctly remembered but also improved the accessi-\nbility of the memorized items, as proven using recognition\ntasks (Kronke, Mueller, Friederici, & Obrig, 2013; Masumoto\ncal studies provide further evidence. A recent functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Miyahara,\nKitada, Sasaki, Okamoto, Tanabe, & Sadato, 2013) investi-\ngated the neural substrates involved in the effect of spontane-\nous verbal labeling when memorizing increasingly complex\nsequences of hand movements. Results showed that the use\n1Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Milan, Italy\n2Division of Education and Human Studies, Champlain College, Burlington,\n3Applied Technology for NeuroPsychology Lab, Istituto Auxologico\nItaliano, Milan, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nClaudia Repetto, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, L.go Gemelli 1,\nEmail: claudia.repetto@unicatt.it\nIs Motor Simulation Involved During\nForeign Language Learning?

As fur-\nther confirmation of these findings, Straube and colleagues\n(2014), relying on behavioral and fMRI data, reported the\nactivation of different neural substrates (left temporal pole\nand middle cingulate cortex vs. posterior thalamic structures\nand anterior and posterior cingulate cortices) for processing\nrelated and unrelated coverbal gestures, leading to enhanced\nmemory performance.\nEnriching the study phase with action information, to pro-\nmote verbal learning, has been used effectively in foreign\nlanguage learning, a field where verbal memory has a crucial\nrole (Taleghani-Nikazm, 2008). Several researchers have\npointed out how gestures increase recall and prevent decay\nwhen used to accompany foreign language words (Kelly,\nInterestingly, abstract words also profit from the use of enact-\nment, as demonstrated by Macedonia and Kn\u00f6sche (2011).\nThe reason why enacted items are better remembered and\nretained is still under debate. Different explanations have\nbeen proposed for the enactment effect. As they are not\nmutually exclusive, we can say they mirror different per-\nspectives. Some authors (see Allen, 1995) refer to classical\ncognitive theories, such as the depth of processing principle\n(Craik & Tulving, 1975). According to this principle, the\ndeeper the item is processed (i.e., in terms of semantic fea-\ntures), the more likely it will be recalled in the future; more-\nover, the memory trace will also last longer. Hence, item\nrecall should benefit from enactment in the encoding phase\nas it deepens the level of processing. The dual code theory by\nPaivio (Paivio, 1971) is also referred to as a mechanism\nunderlining this effect (Tellier, 2008): Those items that com-\nprise not only verbal but also visual information are more\nefficiently remembered. Gestures, in this case, provide the\nsecond \"code,\" the motor trace that plays the same role as the\nvisual code.\nThe hypothesis of the motor trace is also taken into account\nby Macedonia et al. (Macedonia, Muller, & Friederici, 2011)\nto explain learning of both concrete and abstract words during\nforeign language acquisition. According to the authors,\nperforming a gesture when learning a word . . . strengthens the\nconnections to embodied features of the word that are contained\nin its semantic core representation. . . . in the case of abstract\nwords such as adverbs, gesture constructs an arbitrary motor\nimage from scratch that grounds abstract meaning in the\nAll of these positions are based on the idea that an enrich-\nment of the semantic representation facilitates the advantage\nof enactment.\nHowever, other researchers explored the effect of action\non language processing, while assuming the concept of sim-\nulation as a theoretical background. According to Barsalou\n(Barsalou, 2008), \"simulation is the re-enactment of percep-\ntual, motor, and introspective states acquired during\nexperience with the world, body, and mind\" (p. 618). The\neffects of motor simulation have been widely investigated in\nseveral behavioral experiments, addressing different issues\nabout the interplay between language and action in different\nlinguistic processes (Bergen & Wheeler, 2010; Ditman,\nBrunye, Mahoney, & Taylor, 2010; Frak, Nazir, Goyette,\nCohen, & Jeannerod, 2010; Papeo, Corradi-Dell'Acqua, &\nRumiati, 2011; Rueschemeyer, Lindemann, van Rooij, van\n2006). Yet, the direction of the effect of simulation is still\nunclear: Does it help or interfere with the linguistic process?\nThe literature reports opposing results related to comprehen-\nsion and lexical decision tasks. Some authors (Myung,\nfound a facilitation effect (faster reaction times [RTs]) due to\na match between the action performed and the one described\nby the verb. Other authors (Buccino et al., 2005) observed an\ninterference when the effector used to provide the answer\nand the one involved in the action word were the same.\nIt is quite interesting that, to our knowledge, few articles\naimed at applying the concept of simulation to the learning\nprocesses, investigating the role of overt action execution\nduringlearning.Paulusandcollaborators(Paulus,Lindemann,\n& Bekkering, 2009), for example, predicted that if the acqui-\nsition of functional information about an object requires a\nmental simulation of its use, then an overt motor interference\nduring the encoding phase should affect the acquisition of the\nfunctional object knowledge by blocking motor simulation.\nTo test this hypothesis, Paulus and collaborators (Paulus\net al., 2009) constructed two sets of novel objects: Half of\nthese objects related to the action of hearing, and the other\nhalf related to the action of smelling (both actions being per-\nformedbymanipulatingtheobjectwithonehand).Participants\nwere shown pictures of the objects and instructed to learn ver-\nbally their functional properties by repeating them aloud. The\nlearning settings were systematically varied according to four\ndifferent interference conditions during the encoding phase:\nno interference, hand interference (participants had to squeeze\na soft ball while performing the verbal learning task), foot\ninterference (participants had to press a soft ball with their\nfeet while performing the verbal learning task), and attention\ninterference (the task concomitant to the learning one was an\nauditory oddball target detection task). As predicted, the per-\nformance--assessed in a subsequent test phase--decreased\nsignificantly in the hand interference condition. In this condi-\ntion, the actual movement performed during the learning\nphase interfered with spontaneous and covert motor simula-\ntion of the functional object knowledge. The fact that action\ninformation contributes to conceptual processing was already\nidentified by Kiefer et al. (Kiefer, Sim, Liebich, Hauk, &\nTanaka, 2007), who found that, during a categorization task\nof previously learned novel objects, an early activation of the\nfrontal motor regions and later activation of occipitoparietal\nvisuomotor regions occurred only when a pantomime of the\nRepetto et al. 3\nfeatures of the objects was performed during learning phase.\nHowever, these experiments deal with the learning processes\nlinked to conceptual (i.e., functional) information and not\nwith language learning per se, as addressed in the research\npreviously described, which used gestures enrichment.\nStarting from this theoretical background, the aim of the\npresent work is to investigate the role of motor simulation\n(related to the match-mismatch between the effector that\nexecutes the action and that described by the action verb)\nduring the acquisition of a foreign language. To reach this\ngoal, an experimental setting was implemented in which par-\nticipants had to learn foreign verbs--action (hand or foot\nactions) and abstract--with or without concomitant real and\nvirtual motor tasks. The tasks had to be performed using vir-\ntual reality technology.\nVirtual reality is a combination of technological devices\nthat allows users to create, explore, and interact with 3-D\nenvironments. Typically, individuals entering a virtual envi-\nronment feel part of this world, and they have the opportu-\nnity to interact with it almost as they would in the real world.\nThe similarity of the virtual experience to the real world\nrelies mostly on three features: sight, hearing, and interac-\ntion. In most cases, the visual input is provided by means of\na computer monitor or a head-mounted display (HMD). The\nHMD is a visualization helmet that conveys computer-\ngenerated images to both eyes, giving the illusion of the third\ndimension in the surrounding space. Aural devices may be\nhead-based, such as headphones, or stand-alone, such as\nspeakers. The degree of interaction relies on multiple factors.\nProbably the most influential of these is the software that\nmanages this virtual interaction: The more users see their\nactions affecting the virtual world, the more they will feel\nimmersed and engaged. These features of the virtual experi-\nence have an impact on the sense of presence perceived by\nthe user. Presence is usually defined as the \"sense of being\nthere\" in a scene depicted by a medium (Barfield, Zelter,\nSheridan, & Slater, 1995). In other words, the more a virtual\nenvironment is able to elicit a \"perceptual illusion of non-\nmediation\" in the user (Lombard & Ditton, 1997), the more\nthe user will feel present in the environment. The determi-\nnants of presence are multiple, and refer, on one side, to the\nfeatures of the environment and to the level of interaction it\nallows (IJsselsteijn, de Ridder, Freeman,Avons, & Bouwhuis,\nuser's characteristics (i.e., the tendency to use visual repre-\nIn our experiment, the evaluation of the sense of presence\nwas a critical issue: It has been proven that some key aspects\nlinked to presence, such as the sense of spatial presence, cor-\nrelate with the activation of different cortical regions, includ-\ning motor and premotor areas (Baumgartner, Valko, Esslen,\n& Jancke, 2006). Hence, understanding the role of these\nareas during semantic comprehension of action words\n(Repetto et al., 2013) is also a fundamental prerequisite to\nunderstanding how presence modulates linguistic processes.\nOur main hypothesis is that if the simulation of the action\ndescribed by the verb is important for learning a verb's\nmeaning, then a concomitant action that involves the same\neffector of the verb should modulate its recall.\nMore specifically, we hypothesized three scenarios:\nHypothesis 1: Motor simulation is not involved: If so, the\nacquisition of action verbs will be equal, regardless of the\neffector described.\nHypothesis 2: Motor simulation is involved and triggered\nby actual motion: If so, as participants use their hands to\nexplore the virtual environment, the memorization of\nhand-action verbs should be modulated.\nHypothesis 3: Motor simulation is involved and triggered\nby virtual motion: If so, as participants virtually walk/run\nin the environment, the memorization of the foot-action\nverbs should be modulated.\nMethod\nParticipants\nForty-two volunteers (16 males and 26 females, age: range =\nment by public advertisement. Participants were all native\nItalian speakers and had normal or corrected-to-normal\nvision. Exclusion criteria included history of traumatic brain\ninjury or neurological diseases. No participant was aware of\nthe specific purpose of the study. They were informed that\none of the participants, chosen based on the best performance,\nwould receive a coupon worth 50 euros. All participants\nsigned an informed consent (previously approved by the eth-\nics committee of the university) to join the experiment.\nStimuli\nFifteen verbs in the Czech language were selected: Five of\nthem described actions performed with the hand (e.g., to\ndraw), five verbs described actions performed with the foot/\nleg (e.g., to jump), and five of the verbs were intellectual or\nsymbolic activities (e.g., to forget). The complete set of items\nis listed in Table 1.\nWe choose the Czech language because, on one hand, it is\nalmost unknown in Italy (thus optimum to avoid familiarity\neffects), and, on the other hand, its phonology is quite com-\nprehensible for Italian speakers. The three categories of\nverbs included items matched for length and frequency,\naccording to the available database for spoken Italian (De\nMauro, Mancini, Vedovelli, & Voghera, 1993). All the Czech\nverbs were audiotaped with an online voice synthesizer, and\nthe correspondent Italian translations were recorded by a\nfemale human voice.\nEach trial was composed of a Czech verb, followed by its\nItalian translation, and by the repetition of the same Czech\n4 SAGE Open\nverb, with 1 s of delay in between. The intertrial delay was\nset up at 3 s. Figure 1 summarizes the trial composition and\ntiming.\nFive blocks were constructed and randomly presented. A\nparticular trial was presented only once in each block, and\nthe order of presentation of the trials was randomized. Thus,\nin total, the task included 75 trials.\nVirtual Environment\nThe virtual environment employed the freeware software\nNeuroVr2 (www.neurovr2.org). It was designed to represent\na park on a sunny day. When entering the virtual park, the\nparticipant started his or her exploration from a paved track,\nand the \"first-person point of view\" was set up as for an adult\nwho was standing and ready to explore the park. On the sides\nof the track, green grass completely covered the ground, and\ntrees and shrubs enriched the area. In addition to natural fea-\ntures, many artifacts were shown that typically would be\nseen in a park: for example, benches, streetlamps, and bins.\nA picnic area and a playground were displayed. No human\nbeings were present in the scene. The interaction with the\nenvironment (when required, depending on the experimental\ncondition) was regulated by manipulating the left knob of a\njoypad (Xbox 360) with the left thumb. The virtual environ-\nment was projected through an HMD, shaped as sunglasses\n(covering the eyes and resting on the ears).\nQuestionnaires\nTo measure the sense of presence, the ITC-Sense of Presence\nInventory (ITC-SOPI) was employed (Lessiter, Freeman,\nKeogh, & Davidoff, 2001). This questionnaire was devel-\noped taking into account the key factors that predict the sense\nof presence; it focuses on the user's experience of the media,\nboth during and after the experience. It is based on four fac-\ntors: Sense of Physical Space (Cronbach's alpha = .94),\nEngagement (Cronbach's alpha = .89), Ecological Validity\n(Cronbach's alpha = .76), and Negative Effects (Cronbach's\nParticipants also completed the UsoImm77 questionnaire\n(Antonietti & Colombo, 1997). This questionnaire aims at\ninvestigating the spontaneous occurrence of visualization\nand mental images in everyday life activities. The question-\nnaire comprises 77 items: Each item typifies a situation in\nwhich people may experience mental images. Subjects are\nrequested to rate, on a 5-point scale, how frequently the visu-\nalization process described in the item occurs for them. The\nitems concern different mental functions (memorizing,\nrecalling, problem solving, daydreaming), involve different\nkinds of mental images (static and dynamic, single and inter-\nactive, personal and impersonal, spontaneously elicited by\nexternal stimuli and intentionally constructed and processed\nTable 1.

This had to be\nfinished at least 1 day before the experimental session to pre-\nvent a priming effect on spontaneous imagery.\nOn the day of the experimental session, participants were\nwelcomed into a quiet room by an experienced researcher.\nThe materials used in the lab included a personal computer\nand the tools used to experience virtual reality (VR; joypad\nand HMD). These materials were arranged in front of the\nparticipant at a distance of approximately 50 cm.\nAs a first step, the participants wore the HMD and held\nthe joypad, while the researcher launched the practice ses-\nsion. This first phase aimed at familiarizing participants with\nthe environment and the commands needed to interact with\nit. Afterwards, the experimental session started. The main\ntask was the verbal learning of the verbs, which were pre-\nsented in an auditory manner. Participants were instructed to\nlisten to the Czech verbs, trying to remember as many items\nas possible. In addition, participants had to follow different\ninstructions according to the experimental condition to which\nthey belonged (as explained below).\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of two experi-\nmental conditions: the Run condition or the Baseline condi-\ntion. In the Run condition, participants performed the main\ntask while exploring the park as if they were walking or run-\nning through it. The instructions stressed that they had to\nkeep walking, in whatever direction they were going, with-\nout stopping until the verbs presentation stopped. The walk-\nlike action inside the park was achieved by moving the\njoypad knob on the left with the left hand. This experimental\ncondition required people to stand in front of the computer to\nassume a body position coherent with the virtual walk. No\nreal walking movements were allowed during the session.\nIn the Baseline condition, the participants sat in front of\nthe computer and started the virtual experience as if they were\nseated on a bench. In front of them, the playground of the\npark was displayed. Participants were instructed to pay atten-\ntion to the Czech verbs: No action within the environment\nwas allowed, with the only exception being the visual explo-\nration of the scene (by turning the head around). This condi-\ntion served as a baseline measure of the verbal learning.\nAfter completing the study phase (which lasted about 12\nmin), participants were asked to perform a cued recall task:\nThe experimenter presented the Czech verbs, in an auditory\nmanner and one at a time, and the participants had to provide\norally the corresponding Italian translation. The number of\nverbs correctly remembered was recorded. Immediately after\nthe cued recall task, a recognition task was performed.\nParticipants were instructed to listen to the Czech verbs and to\nselect, as quickly as possible, one of the two possible transla-\ntions written on the left and right side of the screen by press-\ning the corresponding left or right button on a button box. The\ncorrect responses were presented equally on the left or on the\nright side of the screen. The correct translation was always\ncoupled with an incorrect, but plausible, translation (i.e., the\ntranslation of another presented verb). The RTs were recorded.\nAt the end of the memory tasks, the participants completed\nthe ITC-SOPI questionnaire (Lessiter et al., 2001).\nResults\nStatistical analyses were conducted on 40 participants. Two\nof them presented either ceiling or floor effects in the cued\nrecall tasks and, hence, were excluded as outliers.\nFirst of all, we were interested in testing the impact of the\ndifferent virtual experiences on the dependent variables\n(number of verbs correctly remembered in the cued recall\ntask, RTs of verbs correctly recognized, and number of errors\nin the recognition task--see descriptive statistics in Table 2).\nWe performed Repeated Measures ANOVAS. We used\nthe variable \"Verb\" (three levels: hand\u00adfoot\u00adabstract), as a\nwithin subjects variable and the \"Condition\" as a between\nsubjects variable with two levels (baseline\u00adrun). Results\nhighlighted that for the number of items recalled, there was\ncomputed on the variable Verb demonstrated that there were\nfewer abstract verbs correctly remembered than hand- or\n2 = 0.631, but hand-action verbs and foot-action verbs did\nFurthermore, the effect of the type of Verb did not change\ndepending on the Condition, Verb \u00d7 Condition: F(2, 78) =\nWith respect to the recognition task, the number of errors\nfor the free recall measure, RTs were influenced by the Verb,\nnor by the interaction Verb \u00d7 Condition, F(2, 78) = 0.17, MSE\nverbs were lower than for the other type of verbs, F(1, 39) =\nAfterward, the scores of the questionnaires were taken into\naccount. First, we computed a MANCOVAusing the responses\n(numbers of errors, response time, and free recall performance)\nas dependent variables, the Condition (baseline vs. run) as a\nfixed factor, and the subscales of ITC-SOPI questionnaire as\n6 SAGE Open\ncovariates. We used the subscales as covariates as we were\ninterested in examining if and how the levels of perceived pres-\nence could mediate participants'overall responses.\nThe general model was significant for number of errors in\nrecognizing the correct translation of hand-related verbs,\nParticipants in the Baseline condition committed fewer\nerrors (M = 2.10, SD = 1.59) than those in the Run condition\n2 = 0.33, appear to have contributed to this difference. Data\nhighlighted how the Engagement subscale had a negative\nrelationship with this dependent variable (B = -1.68, t =\n-2.52,p<.05),andhence,thehigherthelevelofEngagement,\nthe lower the mistake rate. The opposite was true for the\nNegative Effects subscale: Higher scores in this subscale\nwere positively related to higher number of errors (B = 1.46,\nWhen examining the influence of specific covariates on\nour independent variable, it was possible to highlight another\ninteresting effect.

Interestingly, mean estimates pre-\ndicted by the effect of this subscale (Baseline = 2.091, Run =\n1.866) are in the opposite direction with respect to the\nobserved sample means (Baseline = 1.8, Run = 2.14; see\nFigure 2).\nAs a second step, the same analysis was applied to the\nUsoImm 77 questionnaire, but results revealed no significant\neffects for any variable, thus indicating that the individual\ntendency to use imagery did not influence the task.\nDiscussion\nThe present study aimed at investigating the role of motor\nsimulation during foreign language learning. To achieve this\ngoal, we used a virtual environment where participants, while\nlearning Czech verbs, had to move as if they were running.\nTable 2. Descriptives Statistics for All the Considered Variables.\nVariable Experimental condition M SD SE N\nNote. rt_hand/foot/abstract = reaction times during recognition task for each type of verb; err_hand/foot/abstract = number of errors during recognition task\nfor each type of verb; free_hand/foot/abstract = number of items correctly remembered during free recall task for each type of verb; Rt = right; Err = error.\nRepetto et al. 7\nThey achieved this virtual run experience by manipulating a\nknob with their left hand. This procedure allowed participants\nto obtain two kinds of action: one real (the movement of the\nhand on the knob) and one virtual (the virtual movement of\nthe feet, which is necessary to run). When comparing the lin-\nguistic performance (in terms of learning) in this condition\nwith that in the baseline condition (i.e., without any real or\nvirtual action), we were able to understand if simulation is\ninvolved in this process and which movement triggers it.\nWhen looking at the experiment's results, it appears that,\noverall, the simulation of an action performed with the same/\ndifferent effector does not play a role during second language\nlearning. In fact, the number of items correctly recalled did\nnot vary across conditions but depended only upon the type\nof verb: Abstract verbs were more difficult to remember than\nconcrete ones. This finding is not surprising as the cognitive\nadvantage of concrete words over abstract words has been\nrecognized in several memory and language tasks (Nelson &\nYet the fact that hand-action verbs and foot-action verbs\ndid not differ from each other and, moreover, that the effect\nof the verb type was not different (depending on the condi-\ntions) seem to indicate that neither of the actions (real or\nvirtual) affected the learning of verbs that described actions\nperformed with the same or different effector. Coherently,\nduring the recognition task, the same pattern of effects was\nevident: The words that were previously better retained\n(hand- and foot-action verbs) were more quickly recog-\nnized, and the opposite was true for the words that were less\nremembered (abstract verbs). On the contrary, the number of\nerrors in the recognition task did not appear to be influenced\nby any considered variable: One possible explanation is that\nthe error rate did not rely on the learning process but on dif-\nferent variables, possibly linked to the specific setting or\nenvironment.\nThe fact that simulation is apparently not involved in ver-\nbal learning is a new and relevant finding. Data in the litera-\nture report an advantage in terms of language learning due to\nlinking words or sentences with gestures (Kelly et al., 2009;\nthe enrichment of the action achieved by using gestures and\nby using the typical paradigm employed to test simulation\ndiffer substantially. In one case, the learner pairs a lexical\nitem with a univocal pattern of movements, and the couple\naction + word is repeated over and over during the study\nphase. In the second case, a specific movement (virtual or\nreal--in this study, respectively, the run and the manipula-\ntion of the knob) is performed for the duration of the study\nphase with one specific effector that either matches or does\nnot match the one corresponding to the verb. Thus, there is\nnot a specific combination between motion and semantics,\nbut only a generic sharing versus not sharing of the effector\nMoreover, in the present study, volunteers underwent a sin-\ngle session of learning with a relatively small number of verb\nrepetitions: This could account for the lack of differential\nrecall performances regardless of different learning condi-\ntions and types of verbs (notice that Macedonia [Macedonia\net al., 2011] found that training does not always have an\nimpact on retention). However, it is easy to see that while the\ngesture paradigm promotes the grounding of the meaning in\nthe learner's body experience, the use of the same versus dif-\nferent effector is not enough to establish a link between the\nlexical item and the action.\nYet, when learning focuses on conceptual knowledge, the\ninvolvement of simulation is reported in verbal learning\ntasks (Paulus et al., 2009). In this study, the learners were\ntold explicitly to pay attention to the functional use of the\nobjects, and thus, it is possible that these specific instructions\nallowed them to imagine the possible use of that object. In\nthis case, the imagery is likely activated rather than simula-\ntion, and this process relies on different cerebral networks\n(Willems, Toni, Hagoort, & Casasanto, 2010).\nThe fact that no effect of simulation in the foreign-\nlanguage-learning paradigm emerged from our data, com-\npared with its well-established involvement in other linguistic\ntasks such as comprehension (Ditman et al., 2010; Frak et al.,\nto posit that simulation is a relatively \"automatic\" mecha-\nnism, activated during online processes, sometimes guided by\nthe context or by attentional focus (Bergen & Wheeler, 2010;\nTaylor & Zwaan, 2008), but never pervaded by an awareness\nof the usage of strategies. Relying on this perspective, foreign\nlanguage learning can be seen as a typical process in which\nindividual strategies have a strong impact. To support this\ninterpretation, we can mention the fact that, after the experi-\nmental session, participants spontaneously told the experi-\nmenter the tricks they used to recall as many verbs as possible\nin the final test (Lawson & Hogben, 1996). For this reason,\nthe absence of a simulation effect in a language-learning task\nFigure 2. The effect of the scale Ecological Validity.\nNote. The impact of the Ecological Validity (evaluated in the model at the\nfollowing value: 3.2683) for the number of recognition errors related to\nfoot-action verbs. The group means estimated by the model go in the\nopposite direction with respect to those observed in the sample.\n8 SAGE Open\ndoes not rule out the involvement of the motor system in this\nlinguistic process.\nThe second (and somehow surprising) result is the effect\nof simulation in the recognition task. As discussed previ-\nously, the recognition measures do not seem to be influenced\nby the condition of learning (with or without virtual/real\nmovement), but, more interestingly, some effect arises from\nthe contribution of the presence components, as assessed by\nthe ITC-Sopi questionnaire. Specifically, the number of\nhand-action verb errors in the recognition task seems to be\npredicted globally by the set of subscales of the question-\nnaire, with Engagement and Negative effects being the most\nimportant predictors. The hand-action verbs are more easily\nrecognized if acquired without interference movement\n(Baseline condition), when the learner experienced a high\nlevel of Engagement and a low level of Negative Effects.\nEven more interesting is the effect on the number of errors\nfor foot-action verbs: This measure appeared to be influ-\nenced specifically by Ecological Validity, that is, the ten-\ndency to recognize the environment as real. When this index\nwas higher, the errors decreased; moreover, the impact of\nEcological Validity, when controlling for the other subscales,\nwas predicted to foster fewer errors in the Run condition than\nin the Baseline condition. This effect is compatible with the\nfollowing simulation: In the Run condition, learners per-\nformed a virtual motion with their feet, and this action was\nsimulated exactly at the same time as the lexical access.\nThus, the more the learner perceived the environment as real,\nthe more the virtual action was effective on the cognitive rep-\nresentation of the verb, and the more he or she simulated the\naction during the recognition. The foot-action simulation, in\nturn, facilitated the lexical access to the verbs that shared the\nsame effector.\nConclusion\nThe aim of the experiment was to extend the knowledge\nabout the mechanism of simulation and its cognitive effects.\nIn particular, we were interested in testing the occurrence of\nthis process during linguistic tasks in which, to our knowl-\nedge, simulation has never been applied to second language\nlearning. The first important finding is that the simulation per\nse is not sufficient to establish a relationship between words\nand action during learning, resulting in null effect with\nrespect to the number of items recalled (at least with low\nnumber of items and repetitions).\nNevertheless, and maybe more interestingly, our para-\ndigm allowed us to identify a new and relevant finding: The\nsimulation can be mediated by other perceptual and cogni-\ntive processes induced by the context, especially the sense of\npresence. In this perspective, the use of virtual reality gave\nus the opportunity to point out the role of some factors linked\nto the specific experience. These factors appear to be related\nto the concept of presence (which is linked to the specific\ncharacteristic of a VR experience) and can promote or\ninterfere with the simulation process that occurs, even after\nthe virtual experience, as evidenced during the recognition\ntask. In fact, it is known that the sense of presence is medi-\nated by the egocentric perspective in the environment (Bae\net al., 2012), typical of the virtual experience.\nThis result can suggest two reflections: On one hand, it\nmakes clear that simulation can happen when the lexical item\nmust be accessed after being learned. On the other hand, it\npinpoints that the occurrence of simulation during this pro-\ncess is mediated in different ways by the different compo-\nnents of presence involved in the simulation. The latter\nobservation raises interesting questions to be addressed by\nfuture research: Is it possible to modify the virtual environ-\nment to fit the parameters that promote simulation (accord-\ning to the present findings: the reduction of the Negative\nEffects, the enhancement of Ecological Validity and\nEngagement)? What happens when the environment is \"opti-\nmized\" in terms of presence? Could the simulation speed up\nthe time to access the word as well (in the present study, RTs\ndo not appear to be influenced)?\nIn the present study, the virtual environment had a very\nbasic structure, and the virtual experience allowed a low\nlevel of interaction. We can hypothesize that implementing a\nvirtual world that induces higher levels of presence could be\na first step toward this goal.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAllen, L.
