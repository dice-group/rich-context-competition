The study focused on the issue of transfer across disciplines, tasks, and two languages\n(English and Persian). The data were collected through interviews and writing samples from the participants' own EGAP\nclass and their other courses in the university (non-EGAP). The interviews were transcribed and coded for the self-reports\nof learning transfer, and the writing samples were analyzed for the 10 learning outcomes already instructed in the class.\nThe results demonstrated that transfer of learning was variably achieved within interview-based transcriptions and writing\nsamples, though to a varying degree. Showing high degree of conformity and a roughly similar general regularity, both series\nof data indicate that learning transfer does occur, though inconsistently, across disciplines, tasks, and the two languages.\n",

In the academic writing\ncontexts of L1 and English as L2, students usually rely on\ntheir intuitions developed throughout years of reading differ-\nent materials to achieve the purpose. To reconcile the dis-\ncrepancy that usually emerges in the students' L2 writing\nperformances, the English for academic purposes (EAP)\nwriting courses can offer a quick and promising solution\n(James, 2010). That is, students who are offered EAP writing\nare very likely to benefit from their learning in such a writing\nclass to perform equally well in other disciplines and also\nlanguages (Marini & Genereux, 1995). This idea helps gather\nthat learning in one particular context is tantamount to devel-\noping skills for similar contexts. That is, it is likely that men-\ntal structure or thought that is developed in one context is to\na large extent the determinant of writers' oral or written per-\nformance. However, it must be borne in mind that the issue\nof learning transfer can be a very intricate one which requires\nin-depth investigation to be exhaustively mapped. In other\nwords, learning transfer can variably depend on context, stu-\ndents, disciplines, languages, language components and even\nthe emotions of the instructor and students. Prompted by the\nthorny issue of whether such a writing class can be helpful,\nthe present research thus aims to dig a bit deeper into learn-\ning transfer from an English for General Academic Purposes\n(EGAP) writing course into tasks, disciplines, and two\nlanguages.\nPrevious Studies on Learning Transfer in Writing\nWriting courses can be aimed at either specific goals or gen-\neral purposes. In other words, writing can be viewed on a con-\ntinuum ranging from specificity of learning outcomes\n(English for Specific Academic Purposes or ESAP) to the\ngeneral features of the disciplines (English for General\nAcademic Purposes or EGAP), where learning outcomes are\ntransferred across disciplines (Jordan, 1997). In ESAP, learn-\ning is expected, due to its specificity, to transfer to tasks and\ncontexts which are almost similar to those already learned. In\ncontrast, EGAP is thought to permit transfer of learning out-\ncomes on a global level across similar and dissimilar tasks,\ncontexts, and disciplines. Having said that, the challenge that\narose is that while in ESAP transfer indisputably occurs due\nto the specificity of features, in EGAP general features are\nreportedly claimed to be elusive and not capable of transfer-\nring (Haskell, 2001). Moreover, despite the calls for disci-\npline specificity in university English for specific purposes\ninstruction across the globe has turned to EGAP for the trans-\nfer of learning to be achieved. Given the conditions around,\n1English Language Center, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran\n2University of Bangkok, Thailand\nCorresponding Author:\nAli Rahimi, Associate Professor of Applied Linguistics at Bangkok\nUniversity, Bangkok, Thailand.\nEmail: rahimi_cda@yahoo.com\nLearning Transfer in English for General\nAcademic Purposes Writing\nGholam Reza Zarei1 and Ali Rahimi2\n Keywords\nlearning transfer, learning outcomes, EGAP, discipline, task\n2 SAGE Open\nthough EGAP seems to be commonly practiced worldwide,\nthe effective role of EGAP writing instruction from a stand-\npoint of transfer is quite unclear theoretically and practically.\nTheoretically, the position on the impossibility of transfer\nis supported by a few researchers who have cast doubt over\nthe transfer from an EGAP course. For example, Johns\n(1988) challenged the applicability of such an instruction for\npreparing English as a second language (ESL) students to\nstart academic activities as he believed that general features\nof the course are not conducive to enhancing the communi-\ncation from one course to another. Likewise, Hyland (2002)\nand Spack (1997) questioned the transfer of discipline-based\ngeneral skills and strategies across new situations. They\nassumed that situational differences usually require students\nto attend to a number of extraneous issues which are not nec-\nessarily identical. Apart from the above L2-based explana-\ntions, L1 writing researchers present no different comments\non the possibility of writing general skills transfer either. As\na case in point, Russell (1995) rejected the idea of the writing\nskills transfer across all genres and activities as he believed\nthere is no generalizable set of strategies to be transferred.\nTurning to the practical investigations, the results are far\nfrom conclusive and seem quite mixed. The following expla-\nnations review further the two important contexts of L1 and\nL2 writing research and their ensuing conclusions on the\nissue of transfer of writing skills.\nAs regard L1 writing instruction context, James (2010)\nclaimed that some general writing instruction projects in L1\nhave provided evidence of transfer, though they have involved\nonly the participants' self-reports. As two examples, Nelms\nwith participants showing transfer of general writing skills\nacross different courses and improving their grades. This nar-\nrow view of transfer is also evidenced by Ahrenhoerster\n(2006) who compared the scores of students after one-semes-\nter and two-semester long general writing instruction, with\nthe latter outperforming the former and hence concluding the\neffect being that of transfer. In the same vein, Fallon, Lahar,\nand Susman (2009) demonstrated the participants' self-\nreports of transfer in a task and across one field of study, that\nis, psychology. Contrary to the above pieces of research work\ndocumenting transfer, some investigations have reported no\ntransfer through L1 general writing instruction. Wardle (2007)\ncarried out a study on transfer of learning and discovered that\nstudents made no use of their instructions in general writing\ncourses.Also, in another study by Wardle (2009), the students\ncould not find any relationship between their general writing\ncourse and some similar tasks in different courses. The fact\nthat students were not able to establish any link between their\ninstruction and writing does not necessarily rule out the pos-\nUnlike contradictory results of L1 settings reviewed\nabove, the research on L2 writing instruction has revealed\nthe transfer of learning from EAP writing courses. As an\nexample, Snow and Brinton (1988) produced evidence of\ntransfer across the two disciplines of geography and psychol-\nogy. Also, James (2006) showed that a content-based EAP\ncourse led to the transfer for engineering undergraduates.\nTwo more studies on L2 writing courses have documented\noccurrence of transfer to some degree (Leki, 1995; Leki &\nCarson, 1994). In both of these studies, students were\nrequired to identify the aspects or strategies of their previous\nor current ESL which were helpful in their academic studies.\nHowever, these students were concerned with EAP rather\nthan EGAP writing instruction. Spack (1997) investigated\nacademic literacy development in an EGAP writing course.\nThough not particularly focused on transfer, the study\nshowed that the participant transferred from EGAP writing\ncourse the strategies of what to do as for the gist and details\nin the subsequent readings.\nAs seen above, all the above-mentioned studies in L2 con-\ntext have treated transfer indirectly and globally. But, James\n(2008) focused on a variety of learning objectives deter-\nmined in advance and concluded that learning can transfer\nfrom EGAP writing course to other similar conditions. In\nanother study, James (2010) put transfer into a new perspec-\ntive as it occurred in genuine tasks and across disciplines. He\nalso showed that transfer is likely where multiple tasks and\ndisciplines are considered.\nAs the above-reviewed studies in contexts of L1 and L2\ngive a very conflicting and unclear picture of transfer and\nalso due to the fact that EGAP writing instruction may help\nstudents do their composing jobs in other academic programs\nmuch better, and also prompted by the fact that inter-lingual\ntransfer of learning, especially from L2 to L1 can be a new\narena of exploration, the present study is intended to cast fur-\nther light on the issue. Moreover, the present study intends to\nspecify a number of learning objectives (targeted learning\noutcomes) in one part of the study and decide on their trans-\nferability in addition to the global self-reported transfers of\nthe elements by students (general learning elements). Note\nthat learning elements refer to those general elements that the\nparticipants reported in their interviews to have learned and\ncarried over to their writing tasks. And targeted outcomes are\nthose specific learning elements which have already been\ndetermined, focused, and practiced in the writing class and\nthen studied for their transfer in other writing tasks. The\ninterview-based, participant-reported learning elements and\ntargeted outcomes as distinct categories of descriptions were\nborrowed from the study already carried out by James (2010)\nand applied as the model of analysis in this study.\nResearch Question\nResearch Question 1: Are learning elements in general\nand targeted outcomes in particular likely to transfer from\nEGAP to different writing conditions?\nResearch Question 2: Which learning elements or tar-\ngeted outcomes are most prone to transfer across disci-\nplines, tasks, and two languages of English and Persian?\nZarei and Rahimi 3\nMethod\nDesign and Participants\nThe study used a qualitative design as it is considered appro-\npriate for portraying a detailed picture of phenomenon occur-\nring in natural contexts. Transfer of learning as the main goal\nof the study was thus investigated qualitatively in a real con-\nEducation Center affiliated to Isfahan University of\nTechnology, involved 13 students of different fields, who\nvolunteered to attend an optional EGAP writing course. This\ncourse was an optional one titled \"English Writing,\" offered\nas extracurricular and to be taken only by voluntary students.\nThese students were rather good at English language profi-\nciency as assessed through English language performance on\ntheir university entrance exam (all had achieved 60% up to\n76% on the nationwide exam) and wished to improve their\nlanguage command for pursuing their education at graduate\nlevel. Of these participants, 8 were female, 5 male, all junior,\nwith the age range of 21 to 25, and all spoke Persian as their\nmother tongue. The study continued for one 16-week-long\nsemester as it is believed that transfer requires some time to\noccur and it cannot happen instantaneously (Haskell, 2001).\nThe study aimed at developing students' writing skills that\ncould be transferred to different university courses. With this\ngoal in mind, it was expected that the treatment would pave\nthe way for the transfer to occur across different disciplines,\ntasks, and languages. It must be noted that the design of the\nstudy was partly a replication of the James's (2010) study on\nthe same topic. Though the textbook and learning goals as\ncategories of description were taken from that study, the con-\ntext, subjects, and tasks used were not quite identical.\nFurthermore, this study incorporated some different fields of\nthe study as the students attending the class came from a\nvariety of different disciplines. In respect of disciplines, this\nstudy can hardly be considered an exact repetition of James's.\nMost importantly, James's study did not take into account the\nreverse direction of transfer which may be likely from L2 to\nL1. Thus, the present study is distinct from that of James in\nthe analysis of inter-lingual transfer of writing skills.\nMaterials\nFollowing the study by James (2010), the study used the\nbook named The St. Martin's Guide to Writing (Axelrod &\nCooper, 2004). The book incorporates some general writing\nexercises such as arguing a position, proposing a solution to\na problem and also some writing strategies such as compar-\ning/contrasting, defining, and classifying. An interesting\npoint is that the book lists a number of different learning out-\ncomes for different disciplines (see Appendix A). These\nlearning outcomes were to be clearly studied as transfer ele-\nments and herein, modeled on James's study (2010), they\nwere identified as \"targeted outcomes.\" The targeted out-\ncomes are thus distinguished from the self-reported learning\nelements which are elicited from interviews. The rationale\nfor this distinction is not only to discover how participants\ndeal with and transfer the issues which bear resemblance or\notherwise across contexts and languages, but also to see if\nthe analyses through the two modes remain complementary\nto and supportive of each other, in fact, a cross-verification\ntechnique (triangulation).\nTreatment\nThe class was taught by the first researcher who already had\na long record of teaching writing courses at undergraduate\nand graduate levels. On reviewing and enhancing the book\ncontents in each session, the students were required to indi-\nvidually compose, collaboratively revise, and proofread their\nown drafts on different topics. The sessions were mainly held\nin the English language with infrequent switches to Persian\nwherever better communication was needed. The teacher\nwas also involved actively in reviewing and revising the stu-\ndents' drafts to improve and finalize them. The topics stu-\ndents worked on varied from remembering an event,\nexplaining a concept, to arguing for or against an idea. These\nwere supposed to represent three types of writing, namely,\nnarrative, explanatory, and argumentative, respectively; the\ntypes of writing are not considered in the present study.\nData Collection\nThe first step to collect the data was taken through interviews\n(Appendix B) in which the participants were asked about the\npossible transfer of general learning elements into their writ-\ning samples (certain descriptive categories based on James's\nstudy were considered as listed in Table 2). The possibility of\ntransfer was examined across tasks, disciplines, and languages.\nOne session of interview was done for each writing sample.\nThe interviews were audio-recorded and then transcribed for\nthe analysis of learning outcomes. The 39 interviews lasted for\nThe second step in collecting the data was related to the\nparticipants' samples of writing in the EGAP class and their\nown university disciplinary courses. They handed in their\nwriting samples written in Persian and in English to the\nresearchers for the analysis (see Table 1). Participants sub-\nmitted a total of 39 samples from their writing class, each\nparticipant with three samples. The EGAP samples were all\nwritten at the end of the semester as we expected the partici-\npants to make use of or transfer what they had already\nlearned. They also handed in 29 samples of writing from\ntheir own fields of studies (non-EGAP), 12 of which were in\nPersian and 17 of them in English. It must be noted that with\nthe agreement and encouragement of the professors of differ-\nent courses, theses participants had written their course\nassignments in English. The writing samples varied in con-\ntent, length, organization, and format, with some being one\npage, others more, and also of different kinds of tasks, for\nexample, reports, research projects, summaries of reading,\ncase studies (see Appendix C).\n4 SAGE Open\nData Analysis\nFirst, the data obtained in the interview transcripts were\nchecked for the general learning elements participants\nreported to have transferred in their samples. Then the writ-\ning samples were examined for the targeted learning out-\ncomes transfer from EGAP (see Table 3). For the analysis of\ninterview data, this study drew on the techniques used by\ntranscripts were divided into particular parts which focused\non different disciplines and tasks, and then later they were\norganized into two categories of languages (English and\nPersian). The tasks were categorized using Horowitz's\n(1986) framework under four tasks, namely (a) Report (R),\n(b) Research project (RP), (c) Summary of reading (SR), and\n(d) Case study (CS) (see Appendix C).\nThe interview transcripts were carefully read for the\ntransfer of learning elements from EGAP. Learning elements\nwere determined based on the list originally developed by\nChapelle, Grabe, and Berns (1997), and used by James\n(2010). The list of learning elements is presented in Table 2.\nMoreover, the targeted outcomes for the writing samples\nwere identified using the list already prepared by James\n(2010). This list consisted of 10 outcomes extracted from the\nfirst chapter of the textbook (see Appendix A). The learning\noutcomes were all selected from the first chapter of the\nselected writing book as it is believed that participants must\nhave enough opportunity in at least one semester to transfer\nthe learning elements (James, 2010). To analyze the learning\nelements in the writing samples, first all different tasks were\nexamined and the elements specified, and then they were\nchecked across languages and disciplines and tasks for their\npossible transfer. The similarity between the discovered\npoints within the tasks and the learning elements guided the\nresearchers further to investigate the transfers and the exact\nnature of them. The researchers argued away the differences\nwith one of the colleagues familiar with the procedure and\ntried to settle the issues convincingly.\nTo ensure the consistency of the results, the researchers\nrepeated the procedure for data analysis after 3 months indi-\nvidually and coded about 40% of the data again. The intra\ncoder reliability value turned out to be about 95%.\nResults and Discussion\nThe study aimed to investigate the transfer of learning from\nan EGAP writing class. Furthermore, it set out to see if trans-\nfer can occur across tasks, disciplines, and the two languages\nof English and Persian. The results of the analysis confirmed\nTable 2.

In the following analyses, the term case\nactually indicates the exact instance of, for example, \"vocab-\nulary\" (then equal to the number of times), participants\nreported each of the learning elements they transferred from\ntheir writing course to the new writing tasks.\nInterview-based learning elements\n1. Vocabulary (45 cases across all four tasks, disciplines\nand two languages). In regard to this particular case,\nthe students talked about some vocabulary items which\nthey had transferred to the new writing contexts form\nthe EGAP course. Most of these vocabulary items\nwere used in the English writings (n = 33) and also\nsome Persian equivalents in the Persian writings (n =\n12). As regard the tasks, R, RP, SR, and CS received\nAlso, English writings had the most use of such trans-\nferred items (n = 19) followed by Psychology (n = 13),\nChemistry (n = 7), and Electrical engineering (n = 6).\nThe following is an excerpt from the interview, which\nshows the student relied on EGAP for composing in\nother contexts (all the following excerpts are rough\ntranslations from Persian):\nResearcher: Remember anything, for example, vocabu-\nlary, . . . you used from your EGAP?\nStudent: Well, I think so. Anyway I usually depend on my\nlearning, sometimes things learned recently or in the past.\nResearcher: Which vocabulary is here the one already\nused in your class? Show me, please!\nStudent: Ok, let me see, . . . please see this example: \"indi-\ncate,\" \"believe,\" . . .\n2. Syntactic rules (27 cases across all tasks, disciplines,\nand only English language). The second category\nwhich was transferred most from the EGAP class was\nsyntactic patterns and rules learned in that course. The\nsubjects made direct or indirect reference to grammar\nor structure of the language learned in the class which\nwas transferred to other writing contexts. From highest\nto lowest frequency, the tasks of RP, R, SR, and CS and\ndisciplines of English language, Chemistry,\nPsychology, and Electrical Engineering experienced\nthe transfer of learning. No mention of the transfer was\nmade concerning structural patterns in Persian writ-\nings. In the following excerpt, a participant discussing\nhis task explains that he corrected his sentence struc-\ntures by resorting back to the EGAP class:\n[In response to the inquiries of the researcher,] the student\nsaid: \"This is [pointing to a sentence before him] the\nmistake I made in my class, but in this writing I avoided\nit. I think the class helped me not to make that mistake\nagain.\"\nResearcher: What is it? Can you explain the rule again?\nStudent: Oh, yes, after the subjunctive clause \"require\nthat\" I used \"is\" in the class, but in this \"Report,\" I\nknow the correct form is \"be.\"\n3. Resource use (21 cases across all tasks, disciplines, and\nlanguages). In this category, students discussed their\nskills in gathering information, summarizing, using\nquotes, and writing references correctly, taken collec-\ntively as resource use. Of the tasks, R, SR, RP, and CS\ninvolved 11, 6, 3, and 1 cases, respectively. Also,\nChemistry, Psychology, English language, and Electrical\nEngineering were reported to have used cases of trans-\nfer. It is interesting that the two languages used almost\nequal transfer cases (English 10 and Persian 11). The\nfollowing is an excerpt from the interview with a stu-\ndent who talked about his attention to the references:\nTable 3. Transfer Across Disciplines.\nDisc. Spl. (F)\nTargeted outcomes\nVis Sig Na Si Fra Tra Se Co Fus Pas Total MF\nNote. 2 = 17.1; df = 3; significance: .002; p = .05. Disc. = Discipline; Spl = Sample; F = Frequency; Vis = Describing visually; Sig = Stating personal\nsignificance; Na = Narrating; Si = Using similes/metaphors; Fra = Framing; Tra = Using temporal transitions; Se = Using short sentences to draw reader's\nattention; Co = Avoiding missing commas after introductory time elements; Fus = Avoiding fused sentences; Pas = Using past perfect tense accurately;\nMF = Mean Frequency; Ch. = Chemistry; El = Electrical Engineering; Psy = Psychology; En = English Language.\n6 SAGE Open\nResearcher: In your case study, did you also use your\nlearning from EGAP class?\nStudent: Yes, that course helped a lot. For example, I tried\nto follow the referencing according to the instructions\nfrom that book.\nResearcher: Which of the references, in particular?\nStudent: All of them, both in the texts and the last list of\nreferences, here look! The way this is italicized; the\npagination, and commas . . . etcetera.\n4. Coherence (17 cases across all tasks, disciplines, and\nEnglish language only). This category involved stu-\ndents' use of devices to achieve coherence such as\n\"transitions,\" \"conjunctions,\" and the words \"whereas,\nhence, and nevertheless.\" Of the 17 cases of transfer\nreported, SR, R, RP, and CS had 6, 4, 4, and 3 cases,\nrespectively. As for the disciplines, Psychology came\nfirst and then English, followed by Chemistry and\nElectrical Engineering. Persian writings were not\nreported as enjoying the transfers of this category. This\ndoes not mean that the Persian language does not enjoy\nthe property of coherence, but that the participants did\nnot mention their uses of coherence-related devices\nemanating from their writing course, hence not consid-\nered transfer. The excerpt below is an example of the\nuse of what a student learned from her class:\nResearcher: You have used \"whereas\" to show the con-\ntrast, did you know this before your class?\nStudent: No, this is also the word I learned from EGAP\nclass. Before that I did not know it.\nResearcher: What is the meaning of the word?\nStudent: I know that this links two distinct and different\nclauses; I mean in terms of meaning they must be\ndifferent.\n5. Organization (16 cases across all tasks and three disci-\nplines and the two languages). The students in this cat-\negory showed how they organized their writings\nincluding the \"introduction, body, and conclusion,\"\nsequencing of the ideas (problems first followed by\nsolutions) and the unity (thesis statement and para-\ngraph main and supporting sentences). The tasks which\nwere reported to have used this transfer case included\nCS, R, RP, and SR, listed from highest to lowest.\nDisciplines of English, Psychology, Electrical\nEngineering, and Chemistry were the ones in which\ntransfer of this category occurred. Of the two lan-\nguages, all the transfers were mentioned for the English\nwritings. The following is a piece of evidence from an\nElectrical Engineering student who was asked about\nthe assignment (Report) he had handed in to his\nteacher:\nResearcher: It seems that you have divided your assign-\nment into a neat sections of \"Introduction, body, . . .,\"\nDid you do this consciously or is it the way you usually\ndo?\nStudent: Well, this is certainly based on what I received\nfrom my writing class.\nResearcher: Did you actually find this method of arrang-\ning your assignments suitable and desirable?\nStudent: Yes, sure. I think this gives your writing a better\nquality and on the whole can attract the attention of the\nreader. Also, the reader can track down the steps very\nclearly.\n6. Process use (12 cases across all tasks, disciplines and\nthe two languages). This refers to the fact that students\ncarry out their jobs in a series of steps to get completed,\nform the first drafts to the final one. The four tasks\nwere reported to have used this piece of learning each\n3 times. From high to low frequency, the disciplines of\nChemistry, Psychology, English, and Electrical\nEngineering showed transfer. Regarding the two lan-\nguages, English writings used 8 and Persian writings\njust 4 cases of transfer. The following example shows\nthat the student of psychology redrafted her writing\ntask before submission:\nResearcher: . . . Ok, . . . the next point is, \"did you have to\nrevise your writing again and again?\"\nStudent: Yes, of course, one important strategy to com-\nplete and finalize the work is to see the drafts again and\nchange them in order to improve the quality.\nResearcher: Was this point learned in your writing class or\n. . .?\nStudent: I knew something before but the EAGAP course\nhelped me think of this more and more and now I\nremembered to do it because of the emphasis in the\nclass.\n7. Topic development (10 cases across all the tasks and\nthe two languages). Students focused on the way they\ndeveloped their topics through using \"examples, defi-\nnitions, comparisons, and details.\" The tasks from high\nto low frequency which relied on such transfer included\nRP, R, SR, and CS. The disciplines were English,\nPsychology, Chemistry, and Electrical Engineering. In\nregard to the languages, English language used 9 cases\nand Persian 1 of this transfer. For example, the follow-\ning student from English Major says that he always\nstops to think of the direction of the discussions and\nsupporting examples, or any piece of document impor-\ntant to the writing.\nResearcher: What more did you learn from your class?\nZarei and Rahimi 7\nStudent: I came to understand that writing an argumenta-\ntive essay needs some advance organization; so I\nthought about the body and proper contents for my\nwriting.\nResearcher: Any particular example for your proper con-\ntent in this writing sample?\nStudent: Yes, after completing the introduction, I stopped\nto think about the main body. There I found, for exam-\nple, the supporting sentence concerning the reasons for\nthe expansion of delinquencies as the topic of the essay.\nMy EGAP class helped me increase my reliance on the\nexplanations, reasons, and why of things very well.\n8. Efficient writing (seven cases across three tasks, four\ndisciplines, and the two languages). This category\ninvolved easy, fast, smooth writing of the tasks as a\nresult of the learning in EGAP. R, RP, and SR made use\nof this transfer category. Chemistry, Psychology,\nEnglish, and then Electrical Engineering also relied on\nthe transfer of \"efficient writing.\" English writings\nenjoyed six cases of this transfer as reported by the\nstudents, and Persian writings had just one case. The\nfollowing is an example from a student of Chemistry\nwho asserts his writing ability improved a lot due to\nthe instructions received in the class:\nResearcher: Overall, do you think your EGAP class\naffected your approaches to writing?\nStudent: Yes, of course. Before this class I usually\ndigressed from one point to another and had a hard\ntime finding the track to the end. Now, I first think\nabout the topic and very easily put my thoughts\ntogether.\nResearcher: Do you mean you can write more comfort-\nably now?\nStudent: Oh, yes. I think I can finish the job more quickly\nand at the same time much better in terms of quality.\nAll in all, of these eight general learning elements, a total\nof 155 cases of transfer were reported to occur. As for the\ntasks, Reports (R) registered a record of 53 ranking first and\nCase Studies (CS) hit the frequency of 26 standing in the last\nposition. In disciplines, it was English language (E) which\ngained 58, being first in rank, and Electrical engineering\n(EL) 19, standing last. Of the two languages, English wit-\nnessed more transfer of learning (126 cases) and Persian just\nOn the whole, all the participants reported that they had\ntransferred their learning from EGAP. Also, transfer was\nalmost common across all the tasks, disciplines, and the two\nlanguages. Nevertheless, variations can easily be observed in\nthe disciplines, tasks, and the two languages. For example,\nthe discipline \"English Language\" enjoyed more of transfer\ncompared with others. In the same way, the task of \"Report\"\nwas more prone to transfer. Also, English writings made\nmore use of transfer in comparison with Persian, probably\nbecause of the natural linguistic proximity between the\ninstruction and instructional textbook and those tasks.\nTargeted outcomes.Apart from the results obtained from\ninterview transcripts above, the writing samples of the stu-\ndents were also analyzed for certain categories of targeted\nlearning outcomes taught and practiced in the EGAP class.\nThe same issues of discipline, task, and language were inves-\ntigated in the light of the 10 targeted learning outcomes from\nthe textbook (AppendixA).As stated before, students handed\nin 68 samples of writing both from EGAP class and their\nown courses where they were given the chance to write their\nassignments in English in addition to Persian. A total of 387\ncases from the 10 learning outcomes were identified to have\nbeen transferred (Tables 3, 4, and 5). This total number\nincludes all the three variables of task, discipline, and lan-\nguage, in each of which some variation was visible. To round\nup the overall findings, we can gather that the students have\nhad the potential opportunity to use the learning outcomes\neach at least once in their samples, amounting to 10 for each\nsample and totaling 680 for the 68 samples analyzed. The\noverall obtained frequency (387) compared with the poten-\ntial opportunity of 680 generates 57% and a mean frequency\n(MF) of 0.57 for all the 3 variables collectively considered.\nTable 3 reveals the proportion of transfer used within the\nselected disciplines. The 10 targeted outcomes are variably\nand inconsistently scattered across the four investigated dis-\nciplines, with the \"English Language\" ranking first (MF =\n7.1) and \"Electrical Engineering\" last (MF = 4.15) and the\nother two standing in between. As regard individual learning\noutcomes, the column highlighted under \"Si,\" signifying use\nof similes/metaphors, unfolds the most marked variation,\nacross the disciplines and also across the tasks and languages.\nThe two disciplines of \"Chemistry\" and \"Electrical\nEngineering\" permit 0 and 1 case of transfer, respectively,\nwhile the other two, namely, \"Psychology\" and \"English\nLanguage,\" show a multi-fold increase. This discovery prob-\nably originates in the differences between the disciplinary\nrequirements for such an issue as simile or metaphor (Si),\nindicating that hard sciences unlike soft sciences may tend to\nconcretize the events rather than metaphorizing them.\nConcerning the maximum observed transfer, the category\n\"Tra\" or \"using temporal transitions\" shows the highest rate\n(75), again with the first two hard sciences' representatives\nregistering a rather lower number, and similarly \"English\nLanguage\" discipline highest. This finding may be accounted\nfor through the fact that the English major classes are doubly\ndirected and instructed to abide by the principles of writing.\nThe English discipline also shows the highest use of the 10\ntargeted learning outcomes with the MF of 7.1. The differ-\nences of the learning outcomes are however found to be\nmeaningfully distinct across the four studied disciplines.\nTable 4 shows that the 10 targeted learning outcomes\nspread irregularly across the 4 categories of the tasks. \"SR\"\n8 SAGE Open\nor summary of reading registers the lowest and highest fre-\nquency in regard to the least common and most common\ntransfer categories of learning outcomes, namely, \"Si\" and\n\"Co,\" respectively. Whether by accident or design, a possible\nexplanation to this finding is that SR is very much bound by\nthe confines of the text that is read and has to be re-delivered\ntextually. It can be hypothesized that this particular task\n(SR), because heavily dependent on the already polished\ncontent, is thus removed from the imaginative nature of free\nwriting and composing process (in using \"Si\"), the result\nbeing least metaphorical yet at the same time most observant\nof a mechanical feature (in using \"Co\"). This may have also\narisen from the stylistic or rhetorical nature of special task\ntypes, which of course could hardly be verified here due to\nthe holistic design of the study. Whatever the cause, this\nissue opens up a new rewarding area for further inquiry.\nRegarding the overall variations, it can be seen that \"R\"\n(Report) shows the highest MF (6.3) and the other 3 almost\nvery close and around 5. The inferential analysis does not\ndemonstrate a meaningful difference among the tasks.\nThe last point was whether the two languages of Persian\nand English differed in the transfer of the targeted learning\noutcomes. As can be seen, most of the learning outcomes\nhave been transferred in the English language, nearly twice\nthose in Persian (MF = 6.23). Also, of the two categories of\n\"Si\" and \"Tra\", representing least and most transferred out-\ncomes, respectively, English language, compared with\nPersian, shows the highest rate of transfer. One reason for\nthis may be the greater portion of writing samples written in\nEnglish, though the MF also proves the same trend. Another\nmore plausible explanation could be the textbook which was\nin English and also the instruction which was predominantly\ngiven in English. The English dominated medium of instruc-\ntion may sensitize and thus bias the learners toward the\nEnglish language as a purported carrier of such learning out-\ncomes taught. It may be claimed that writing performances\nare strongly pinned down to some predetermined attributes\nand outcomes which have been attained in the classroom.\nFurthermore, it must be noted that learners' performances\nusually tend to find most congruity with the instructional\nmaterials especially in the case of language learning, where\nunlike content courses, negligible latitude is expected on the\npart of learners. The difference between the two languages,\nas can be clearly seen, proves meaningful.\nAnd finally, comparison of the two broad sets of data from\ninterview transcripts and writing samples show a high degree\nof conformity. Interestingly, the cases of transfer are identi-\ncally represented in the two languages and also disciplines\nacross interview transcripts and samples of writing. In both\nsets of data, English and Persian as two languages show dis-\ntinct transfer trends with English accommodating 2 times\nmore. Also, disciplines of English and electrical engineering\nportray the same image of transfer, the former maximum and\nlatter minimum across the two sets of data. As for the tasks,\nthe maximum transfer reveals a similar disposition, with \"R\"\n(Reports) coming first in both sets of data. The only\nTable 4.

Thus, the combined\nresults from the two sets of data show a high agreement and\nilluminate the ubiquity of transfer across the disciplines,\ntasks, and languages, though variation is inevitable.\nThe above-reviewed results of this study reconfirm the sig-\nnificance of transfer to be addressed in EGAP or similarly in\nEAP classes as students always have to implement their learn-\ning beyond their immediate needs to some more practical\nareas of concern. As this study was partly related to the previ-\nous rather identical one by James (2010), a few comparative\nwords are thus in order. In regard to the results obtained from\ninterview-based transcriptions, the present study reveals a dif-\nferent general trend from that of James. The first and foremost\npoint is that the participants in this study dwelled on the\n\"vocabulary\" as their first choice of transfer, while this is quite\nreversed and receives the least attention, thus appearing at the\nend in James's study. Similarly, and as a radical digression\nfrom James's study, the transfer of \"syntactic rules\" occurs as\nthe second most important component in our study.Apart from\nthe differences, the two studies, however, bear some resem-\nblance. For example, the two transfer cases of \"coherence\"\nand \"process\" stand in the same positions, or also \"efficiency\"\nappears to be close to each other in the standing in the two\nstudies, which may show that the participants in the two stud-\nies have found these two issues required in the same way. With\nrespect to the transfer across tasks, the two studies seem to\ndiverge widely, as our study reveals a comparatively more\nconsistent tendency with the transfer components occurring\nacross all the four tasks, excluding \"efficiency\" which has\nbeen transferred across three out of four. The across-task trans-\nfer for the James's study proves more varied, with \"organiz-\ning\" and \"vocabulary\" transferred across seven and one task\nout of seven, respectively. \"Disciplines\" in the two studies,\nthough different and distinct, also enjoy the varied occurrences\nof transfer.\nThe two studies compared on the basis of the second set\nof data, that is, the samples of writing and targeted outcomes,\nbear general similarities, though the tertium comparationis is\nnot absolutely identical because different tasks and disci-\nplines have been used in the two studies. However, as for the\ndisciplines, the two studies converge on the fact that the dis-\nciplines associated with humanities in general, as compared\nwith natural or technical courses, seem to unfold in the same\nway. But, within the disciplines, the types of targeted out-\ncomes are not similarly transferred. In the present study, the\nmaximum number belongs to \"transitions\" and minimum to\n\"similes, while this is quite different (min: \"vis; sig; nar;\nsim\" and max: \"Fus\"). As for the transfer across tasks, the\ntwo studies show almost the same trend, with all the tasks\nreceiving such transfers though they are not exactly similar.\nThe differences of the two studies point to the differences in\nthe conditions, tasks, and disciplines and also participants\nand very likely their proficiency levels.\nThe findings here are in line with James's (2010), indicat-\ning that EGAP writing classes can result in the learning\ntransfer, though the transfer of learning may not be uniform\nacross different tasks and disciplines. Hyland (2002) also\nstated that such writing instruction confirms the view of lit-\neracy that maintains technical skills and rules are usable\nacross any situation.\nAnother important result of this study is that the specific\nlearning outcomes related to the language use and mechanics\nhave been transferred most, especially as shown in the inter-\nview-based data above, which is a verification of the results\nobtained by James (2009) and a near contrast to the study of\nThe results of the study further shed light on the fact that\nthe observed consistency of transfer across tasks, as far as\nstudied here, would not be an indication that the tasks can\nprovide radically different conditions leading to sharp dis-\ntinctions and demands for transfer variation. Thus, there may\nbe some other factors at work to modify the conditions under\nwhich transfer may occur (Perkins & Salomon, 1994).\nAs an additional dimension of the present study, two lan-\nguages of English and Persian revealed differences in the\ntransfer from the EGAP course. English language tasks of\nwriting showed twice more instances of transfer than the\nPersian tasks. Yet, the interesting point is that both languages\nmade most use of \"tran\" as the targeted learning outcome.\nThe results of inter-lingual analysis of transfer somewhat\ncontradicts the idea that whatever thought developed by the\nwriters can be expressed and regenerated elsewhere not nec-\nessarily tied to any special language (Berman, 1994). In other\nwords, this study demonstrates that the participants are rela-\ntively less subject to transfer writing skills from L2 into L1\ncontexts than from L2 into L2 contexts. This finding may be\naccounted for by the students' unbalanced linguistic reper-\ntoires in the two languages, including vocabulary or grammar\n(Cummins, 1991), which requires further future inquiries.\nAlso the differences of transfer in the two languages show\nthat the second language learning contexts (e.g., James's\nstudy) differ from the conditions in a foreign language learn-\ning setting (this study) where students may look up to the for-\neign language instruction for their performance in the same\nlanguage (L2) and thus distinguish their L1 skills from L2 in\na more polarized manner. Of course, this new dimension of\nthe L2-to-L1 transfer interface needs more substantiation\nbefore the results could be generalized or practically used.\nConclusion\nAs a fundamental topic in education in general and L2 con-\ntexts in particular, transfer of learning has been empirically\nunder-investigated in the academic writing instruction\n(Wardle, 2007). This study is thus a response to the call for\ntransfer-focused investigations directed toward the learning-\nspecific components such as exact skills, strategies, languages,\ntasks, disciplines, or goals which are likely to affect transfer\n(Nelms & Dively, 2007). In regard to EGAP writing instruc-\ntion, the results of the present study contribute to the literature\nof and discussions around the issue, and in line with Wardle\nreiterated the transferability of learning outcomes across dif-\nferent tasks, disciplines, L1 and L2. The findings further sup-\nport Widdowson's (1984) suggestion that broad-based\neducation such as the general ESL instruction can lead to\ntransfer of learning while narrow training such as ESP instruc-\ntion may fail to produce the same results. The same idea of\nlocal knowledge versus global knowledge and the transferabil-\nity of the latter recommended by Perkins and Salomon (1988)\nis also corroborated by the findings of the study here. However,\nit must be noted that the variations observed across learning\noutcomes and also typologies of tasks, languages, and disci-\nplines suggest that EGAP classes are not to be taken as a tran-\nscendental purveyor of skills, tackling the problems of any\nkind arising in any academic program. In the same vein, James\n(2010) asserted such investigations cannot meet all the global\nneeds of writing for all the students.\nAs commonly accepted, the transfer of learning occurs as\na function of different variables such as type of knowledge to\nbe transferred, conditions under which to transfer, individu-\nals' preferences for transfer, tasks, and so on, occurring at\ndifferent rates and in different ways (Smit, 2004). To sub-\nstantiate the idea and as a piece of evidence, James (2009)\ndiscovered that learning outcomes of \"language use\" are\nmore likely to transfer than those related to \"content or orga-\nnization.\" Similarly, the findings of this research partly vali-\ndate James's discovery, as it was also found in the present\nstudy that the most frequent category of transfer in interview\ndata, namely, \"vocabulary\" was an example of language use.\nNevertheless, the analysis of writing samples goes contrary,\nrevealing \"use of temporal transitions,\" an instance of \"orga-\nnization,\" as the most occurring transfer, which obviously\nstands in stark contrast with James's finding. This last point\nof contradiction brings up the important issue of conditions\nunder which learning transfers. While L2 settings may call\nfor students' special perception of task for the transfer to be\nachieved (James, 2010), L1 settings may demand students'\nmotivation (Bergmann & Zepernick, 2007) or also their\nemphasis on amount of writing practiced (Nelms & Dively,\nfound that an English-medium EGAP tends to develop biased\nconditions for the direction of learning transfer as the results\nindicated the students' inclination toward carrying over their\nlearning from EGAP to the writings in English rather than in\nPersian. In contrast to the above point, Berman (1994)\nbelieved that thoughts that are generated by writers can be\nexpressed in different ways and that thoughts are not depen-\ndent on any particular language. He thus tries to associate the\ntransfer of thoughts not to the language of instruction but to\nthe proficiency that students develop in a particular language\nas well. Thus, he claims that transferability of writing skills\nrequires a threshold of grammatical competence. The role of\nproficiency brings up an important point and can encourage\nfurther studies on the inter-lingual transferability of writing\nskills. Still, one point worth attention is that in such a study a\ndistinction must be made between the language-based ele-\nments of transfer and other conceptually driven skills in writ-\ning such as organization or planning, and so on. This is\nbecause not all different learning elements can be transferred\nuniversally. Moreover, we need to pay close attention to the\ndirection of transfer as well, to see whether it is L1 which\ngives way to the transfer of learning more effectively or L2.\nTheoretically, it seems that Cummins's (1991) interdepen-\ndence theory of L1\u00adL2 in the context of writing can account\nfor the variations of this direction. However, the differences\nof conditions and contexts such as a foreign language versus\nsecond language context and also limiting role of proficiency\nand writers' depth and breadth of world knowledge can be\nvery important issues to consider.\nOverall, the results suggest that EGAP classes be reori-\nented toward particular instructional goals focusing on the\ntransfer of certain learning outcomes which are useful to the\nsuccess of the prospective writers. The instructional goals may\nbe geared toward those outcomes that are more likely to trans-\nfer under certain conditions. In this line of thinking, a number\ntional approaches used in EGAP with premium given to teach-\ning-for-transfer techniques. The implementation of such\ntechniques can most probably save students lots of time and\nenergy in achieving the far-reaching and lifelong goals of edu-\ncation. It must be noted that the variability observed suggest\nthat learners' cognitive capacity function flexibly and non-\nmathematically in response to different types of input.\nConsequently, we need to transform our classes into some\nmilieus that accommodate learners' individual differences. To\nachieve this goal and actually that of moving away from\nteacher-controlled instruction to learner-directed learning,\nMahdavi, Fazlollahtabar, Heidarzade, Mahdavi-Amiri, and\nRooshan (2008) recommended \"relinquishing much of control\nover planning and selection to learners\" (p. 4604).\nLimitations\nSimilar to any other study of descriptive nature, this study\nsuffers from a number of shortcomings, which may confound\nthe external validity of the results. As one important point,\nthis study considered all the participants on a holistic basis\nwhile an intra-individual design could analyze individuals'\nbehaviors separately and come up with some clearer picture\nof the differences and preferences. Also, the study focused\non the transfer within a pre-established range of learning out-\ncomes, whereas it could have taken into account peripheral\nlearning transfer not already defined. The present study can-\nnot categorically verify that all the transfers of learning pos-\nsibly resulted from the writing course. To do this, a different\ndesign examining the pre-instruction status of students seems\nnecessary. For example, it is very likely that students' episte-\nmological beliefs affect their learning and it would be quite\nilluminating to consider their beliefs a priori. Taking stu-\ndents' feedbacks on their performances, as it occurred in\ninterviews here, can offer an alternative. Furthermore, this\nstudy stressed the frequency and amount of transfer while an\nanalysis of transfer effect on the performance of students\ncould make a very good choice of research. Another short-\ncoming stems from the short period of time, which seems not\nto fit the longitudinal nature of transfer. This study did not\ntake into account the critical role of the learners' age or\nsocio-cultural backgrounds, which could make a big differ-\nence if learners are in their growing years.\nAlso, the claims made here in relation to EGAP could\nhave been more reliable if ESAP had also been investigated\nfor the transferability of local versus global knowledge.\nAppendix A\nEnglish for General Academic Purposes (EGAP)\u00adbased\nlearning outcomes (James, 2010) analyzed in part two of\ndata analysis (Writing Samples)\nTargeted Outcomes: Definitions\n 1.
