    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nPURPOSE Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of invasive infections, yet most\nassessments of prevalence are based on health care\u00adbased samples. We computed\npopulation-based estimates of nasal carriage of S aureus and risk factors for car-\nriage, as well as population-based estimates of nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant\nS aureus (MRSA).\nMETHODS We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\ninstitutionalized US population including children and adults.\nRESULTS An estimated 86.9 million persons (32.40% of the population) were colo-\nnized with S aureus. The prevalence of MRSA among S aureus isolates was 2.58%,\nfor an estimated population carriage of MRSA of 0.84% or 2.2 million persons.\nAmong individuals with S aureus isolates, individuals aged 65 years or older had\nthe highest MRSA prevalence (8.28%). Among all the racial/ethnic groups studied,\nHispanics had the highest prevalence of colonization with S aureus but, when colo-\nnized, were less likely to have MRSA.\nCONCLUSIONS This first nationally representative assessment of carriage of\nS aureus indicates that nearly one third of the population is currently colonized by\nthis organism. Although the prevalence of MRSA remains low, more than 2.2 mil-\nlion people carry this resistant organism; thus, vigilance in promoting appropriate\nmicrobial transmission protocols should remain a priority.\nINTRODUCTION\nStaphylococcus aureus is one of the most common human pathogens and\nis capable of causing a wide range of infections. Although primary\nS aureus infections are not common, a great deal of the virulence from\nthis organism occurs through cross-infection by spread from patient to pa-\ntient in hospitals and other institutional settings. In contrast, healthy indi-\nviduals have a small risk of contracting an invasive infection caused by\nS aureus, but they can be carriers of the organism.1 Because its primary habi-\ntat is moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares,2 most invasive\nS aureus infections are assumed to arise from nasal carriage.3\nThe incidence of community-acquired and hospital-acquired S aureus infec-\ntions has been rising with increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains called\nmethicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA).4-8 MRSA is an established pathogen in\nmost health care facilities. Previously limited to hospitals, MRSA infections\nhave been increasingly reported in the community.8,9-14 A recent meta-analysis\nof 27 studies of the prevalence of community-acquired-MRSA among hospital\npatients that used clinical specimens, as opposed to surveillance cultures con-\nducted at the time of admission, yielded a prevalence of MRSA of 30.2%.15\nThe strains of MRSA associated with recent community outbreaks have\nArch G.

These are issues that\nmay be very useful to clinicians when trying to decide\nthe likelihood that a given patient has a staphylococcal\ninfection and, if so, whether antibiotic coverage should\nbe provided for resistant strains. We undertook this\npopulation-based study to produce population-based\nestimates of nasal carriage of S aureus and to identify\nrisk factors for carriage and to determine population-\nbased estimates of nasal carriage of MRSA.\nMETHODS\nThe data used for the present study come from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nnationally representative sample of the noninstitution-\nalized US population. The NHANES design includes\nan oversampling of minorities and allows determina-\ntion of population estimates. More information on the\nassessment can be found elsewhere.25\nAssessment of S aureus was conducted for the entire\nsample; thus, all participants aged 1 year or older were\ntested and were included in this study. The number of\nindividuals used in the unweighted sample was 9,622,\nProcedure\nAssessment of S aureus\nThe procedure for processing the nasal cultures in the\nnasal swabs for proper labeling and integrity. Nasal\nswabs were refrigerated and shipped weekly to a con-\ntract laboratory. Specimens collected from the nares\nwere plated on mannitol salt agar (MSA), a selective\nmedium for the isolation of S aureus. MSA plates were\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. Mannitol-ferment-\ning colonies (ie, those that were yellow or gold) were\nselected from the MSA plates and subcultured to plates\nwith trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep blood (ie,\nblood agar plates [BAPs]) and incubated at 37\u00b0C over-\nnight. MSA plates with little or no growth were reincu-\nbated at 37\u00b0C overnight, and plates with non\u00admanni-\ntol-fermenting growth were held at room temperature.\nThese plates were reexamined the next day, and any\nyellow or gold colonies were subcultured to BAPs.\nOvernight cultures on BAPs were first screened\nusing Staphaurex, a rapid latex kit for the identification\nof S aureus (Remel, Lenexa, Kan). A tube coagulase test\nusing rabbit plasma with EDTA was then performed on\nStaphaurex-negative isolates from BAPs with morphol-\nogy consistent with S aureus and on Staphaurex-positive\nisolates with morphology inconsistent with S aureus\n(ie, nonhemolytic). Staphaurex-positive isolates and\nStaphaurex-negative, tube coagulase\u00adpositive isolates\nwere identified as S aureus and saved for further testing.\nStaphaurex-positive, tube coagulase\u00adnegative isolates\nwere discarded.\nAssessment of MRSA\nS aureus isolates were screened for methicillin resistance\nby the disk diffusion method of the National Clinical\nand Laboratory Standards Institute. Overnight cultures\nfrom BAPs were plated on Mueller-Hinton agar, and a\n1-\u00b5g oxacillin disk was placed on the inoculated plate.\nZone diameters were measured and recorded after a\n24-hour incubation at 37\u00b0C; the results were classified\nPotential Risk Factors\nSeveral variables were investigated as potential charac-\nteristics indicative of carriage of S aureus. These factors\nincluded the common demographic variables of age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, and place of birth. We also examined car-\nriage of S aureus according to self-reported health status,\npoverty-income ratio, outpatient health care use in the\npast 12 months, hospitalization in the past, long-term\ncare admission in the past 12 months, use of antibiotics\nin the past 30 days, self-report of physician diagnosis of\ndiabetes, self-report of physician diagnosis of asthma,\nself-reported oral health, and current exposure to ciga-\nrette smoke (operationalized as either being a current\nsmoker or living in a house with a current smoker).\nGiven the limited population carriage of MRSA, we\ninvestigated a limited number of characteristics based on\nwhether the unweighted sample size was large enough\nto make a reliable population estimate (ie, the standard\nerror was less than one third of the parameter estimate).\nAnalysis\nThe selection of variables was based on the ability\nto use the entire population for our estimates. The\nNHANES limits some questions to certain age-groups\n(eg, adults) or other population subsets (eg, Hispanics).\nConsequently, we investigated variables that were avail-\nable for the entire sample.\nWe used SUDAAN software (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for\nthe complex sample design used in the NHANES in\nthe analysis. Our analysis incorporated both the strati-\nfication and clustering aspects of the sampling design.\nThe proper weighting procedures include adjustments\nfor the basic probability of selection and adjustments\nfor nonresponse. Because minorities were oversampled\nand the sampling design was complex, we used sam-\npling weights provided by the NHANES to compute\npopulation estimates based on weighted parameter\nestimates and standard errors. Chi-square analyses were\nused for bivariate comparisons. We also conducted a\nlogistic regression analysis of all variables with a bivari-\nate P value of <.10 and then removed variables that\nwere not significant at this level.\nWe initially attempted to compute the relationship of\nseveral potential risk factors for carriage of S aureus and\nMRSA but found that for some variables, there were too\nfew unweighted individuals in a cell to make a reliable\npopulation estimate. Admission to a long-term care facil-\nity was one such variable and is therefore not presented.\nRESULTS\nCarriage of S aureus\nWe found that the prevalence of nasal carriage of\npersons. Among adults aged 20 and older, nasal car-\nriage of S aureus was present in 30.67%. Table 1 pro-\nvides an indication of the population prevalence of\nnasal carriage of S aureus based on demographic charac-\nteristics; age, sex, race/ethnicity, and country of birth\nwere associated with carriage in this community sur-\nveillance. In particular, it was noteworthy that non-His-\npanic blacks were less likely than non-Hispanic whites\nor Hispanics to be colonized by S aureus.\nIn addition to looking at demographic characteris-\ntics, we also explored the relationship between clinical\ncharacteristics and nasal carriage of S aureus (Table 2).\nAmong these characteristics, having asthma was posi-\ntively related to carriage, whereas exposure to cigarette\nsmoke and recent use of antibiotics were negatively\nassociated with carriage.\nTo account for potential confounding\namong the demographic and clinical char-\nacteristics, we further analyzed the relation-\nship between the potential predictors with\na logistic regression model (Table 3). This\nmodel shows that even when controlling\nfor the effect of the other characteristics\n(eg, age, sex, race/ethnicity), the relation-\nships found in the bivariate analyses remain\nsignificant.\nCarriage of MRSA\nWe also looked at carriage of MRSA in the\nsame population. The prevalence of MRSA\namong S aureus isolates was 2.58%. This\nvalue corresponds to a total population car-\nsons and a carriage of methicillin-susceptible\npersons. Among adults aged 20 years or\nolder, the prevalence of carriage of MRSA\nwas 0.95%. Total population carriage of\nMRSA was 0.67% for individuals aged 1 to\nyears or older.\nThe prevalence of MRSA among S aureus\nTable 1.

Among\nindividuals with S aureus isolates, 2.03% of those aged\n1 to 64 years were carriers of MRSA, compared with\namong individuals with S aureus isolates, 2.70% of\nnon-Hispanic whites carried MRSA, compared with\n(P = .01). In addition, 4.14% of women with S aureus\nisolates carried MRSA, compared with only 1.33% of\nDISCUSSION\nThis study provides the first nationally representative\nassessment of carriage of S aureus in the total US popu-\nlation. The results suggest that nearly one third of the\npopulation is currently colonized by S aureus. Although\nthe community carriage of MRSA is relatively low at\nless than 1%, this figure translates to more than 2.2\nmillion people in the United States carrying this resis-\ntant organism.\nOur prevalence results are similar to those of several\nprevious regional studies focusing on different sub-\ngroups of the population in the United States.21,24 In\nregional estimates that were based on patients, however,\neven though the patients did not have invasive infec-\ntions, their MRSA prevalence tended to be substantially\nhigher than that in the more generally representative\nOur study extends the previous knowledge in this\narea by identifying several predictors of nasal S aureus\ncarriage. These predictors may help inform clinical\ndecision making when treating community-acquired\ninfections. First, teenagers and male individuals are more\nlikely to be carriers of S aureus. When clinicians encoun-\nter infections in these 2 groups, especially in body areas\nwhere staphylococcal infections are common, such as\nthe skin, treatment should include an antibiotic that\nis effective against S aureus. But while carriage is more\ncommon in these groups, the prevalence of MRSA\nremains low; therefore, clinicians should not be highly\nsuspicious of methicillin resistance in these populations\nunless the infection is atypical, such as one occurring in\na body area that is uncommon for staphylococcal infec-\ntion (eg, the lungs) or one that is rapidly advancing.\nOur study also may be useful in that our findings\npoint out that relative to younger individuals, older\nadults are less likely to be colonized with S aureus but,\nwhen colonized, are more likely to have\nMRSA strains. This finding suggests that\nolder adults with suspected staphylococ-\ncal infections may need antibiotic coverage\nagainst resistant strains. Because of the higher\nrates of carriage of resistant organisms in this\nmedically vulnerable population, clinicians\nmay want to initiate vancomycin therapy ear-\nlier in the course of a suspected S aureus infec-\ntion in patients older than 65 years.\nWhereas studies looking at the risk of\ncarriage of resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae\nindicate that recent beta-lactam use increases\nthe rate of carriage of this organism, our\ndata indicate that recent use of antibiotics\nis associated with a reduced risk of S aureus\nnasal carriage.26 Unfortunately, because\nthe prevalence of MRSA was low and the\nnumber of individuals using antibiotics was\nsmall, we were not able to explore whether\nantibiotic use is related to antibiotic resis-\ntance in those who do carry S aureus. Among\nindividuals with an S aureus isolate who had\nrecently used antibiotics, 4.83% were colo-\nnized by MRSA, while only 2.45% of those\nwho had not used antibiotics were colonized\nby MRSA. This estimate, however, does not\nmeet criteria for reliability in this popula-\ntion-based study because only 6 people had\nused antibiotics recently and carried MRSA.\nTable 2.

Local\nrates of carriage and resistance may vary consider-\nably. Additionally, data for this study were collected in\nresistance are possible. One recent study of children\nin Nashville, Tenn, for example, showed an MRSA\ncolonization rate similar to that in our study (0.8%) in\n2001, but a considerably higher rate when children of\nthe same age-group were sampled just 3 years later.27\nConsequently, when clinicians are making therapeutic\ndecisions, they should monitor bacterial carriage rates\nand resistance patterns for their own hospital and city,\nas well as take into account the risk patterns found in\nour study.\nThis study has several strengths. It provides the\nfirst nationally representative community surveillance\nestimates of S aureus and MRSA carriage for the United\nStates. By focusing on nasal carriage within an undif-\nferentiated sample ranging from small children to the\nelderly, the study provides an estimate of the reservoir\nof S aureus and MRSA that has not been available in\nstudies focusing on individuals in the health care sys-\ntem or small regional samples.\nEven with the aforementioned strengths, our study\nhas some limitations. Because of the small number of\nindividuals colonized with MRSA and the correspond-\ning inability to make reliable population estimates,\nwe were limited in our ability to identify risk factors\nfor community carriage of MRSA; thus, although it is\nencouraging that the community prevalence of MRSA\nis less than 1%, our ability to identify characteristics\nof this group beyond age, race/ethnicity, and sex was\nlimited. A second limitation of the study was that it\nwas restricted to the noninstitutionalized population.\nAlthough this population provides for the broadest\nassessment of the entire population, carriage of S aureus\nand MRSA may differ in other settings.\nIn conclusion, our study confirms the high preva-\nlence of S aureus nasal colonization in the United States;\nhowever, it also shows that the rate of MRSA carriage\nremains low. Few demographic or clinical characteris-\ntics are related to either S aureus carriage or, more spe-\ncifically, MRSA carriage. Consequently, clinicians and\nhospital infection control personnel cannot target spe-\ncific populations who are at highest risk of transmitting\nS aureus and should remain vigilant in using appropriate\nprotocols for minimizing microbial transmission.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/4/2/132.\n",
