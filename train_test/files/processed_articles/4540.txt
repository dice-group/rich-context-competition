    "abstract": "Abstract\nCulture has been viewed as the biggest obstacle to change in the legacy media newsroom.\nOlder as well as recent literature points out that professional culture typically hinders\nnewsroom innovation processes, and newsrooms in transformation often seem to find\nculture clashes on their path. These transformational problems, however, appear to be\nviewed predominantly from a management point of view. By looking at journalism culture\nfrom the broader perspective of a learning culture which fosters innovation, including\nboth management and newsroom workers, a more nuanced picture can be presented.\nIn this article, the concept of innovative learning culture is introduced to provide a\ndifferent lens through which drivers and obstacles of innovation in the newsroom can\nbe observed. Furthermore, innovative learning culture can be used in empirical research\nto gain insights in the learning and innovation processes of professional journalists, a\nstrikingly under-researched area. As such, innovative learning culture as a concept fills\ngaps in the empirical as well as in the more theoretical literature, which may enhance\nfuture newsroom research.\n",

The reasons for exploring the concept of ILC are 3-fold.\nFirst, research on learning and innovation processes in the legacy media newsroom is\nscarce. Studies on learning processes are limited to student experiences in journalism\nMarch, 1991). However, apart from the scholarly attention to newsroom (multi)skilling,\nwhich refers to acquiring the skills necessary to deal with new technologies (Cottle and\nlearn in the newsroom, and how they learn to innovate in it, is still an under-researched\narea. By addressing these issues using ILC as a perspective, new insights in learning and\ninnovation processes can be gained when studying newsrooms in transformation.\nSecond, newsroom studies tend to lack insights into the cultural prerequisites of inno-\nvation. This is remarkable, as at the same time culture is perceived to be the biggest\nobstacle to change in journalism (Ekdale et al., 2015; Ryfe, 2012). Yet the bulk of the\nstudies on the transformation of a traditional newsroom to one offering `a truly continu-\nous product' with multi-media and online platforms (Dickinson et al., 2013: 4) mainly\nfocus on the diffusion of technological innovation and the management of this diffusion\n(Rogers, 2003). However, technology is never a driver for action all by itself, as it is\ninextricably linked to the social and cultural context (Boczkowski, 2004; Cottle and\nexample, need to have a welcoming mind-set to new technologies, if they want to profit\nfrom possible online options (Borger, 2016). As the cultural side of innovation has yet to\nbe thoroughly understood, ILC can help identify cultural drivers and obstacles of innova-\ntion processes in the newsroom.\nThird, newsroom studies that do deal with the cultural side of innovation view culture\npredominantly as problematic, and they typically view it from a management perspec-\ntive. Culture tends to be viewed in terms of culture clashes as a result of transformational\nprocesses (Lee-Wright, 2010; Lewis, 2012). Professional culture specifically is seen as a\nhindrance to innovation in the newsroom, and this culture is said to be very hard to\nNotwithstanding the interesting and detailed analyses in these studies, at least five pre-\nsuppositions seem to underlie their conclusions: (1) change is positive, (2) newsroom\nmanagement initiates change, (3) journalists do not appear to comply enough, (4) this\nimpacts the planned change negatively and (5) for this \u00ad predominantly \u00ad journalists are\nto blame. Seen from a management point of view, journalists do not seem to act as they\nare told by their superiors, hence they get the finger pointed at them. Using ILC as a\nconcept, encompassing both management and journalists, a more nuanced picture of\nnewsroom innovation processes can be achieved.\nLooking at the latter reason for introducing ILC, studying change from a management\nperspective is not limited to the study of journalism, as it characterizes a large part of the\norganizational change literature (Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2008). Generally speaking,\nthese situations are viewed from only one side of the story, that of the change agents, the\nones that, as often occurs, initiate change. Whereas the change recipients, the people\nwho are supposed to undergo or execute change, are systematically portrayed in a nega-\nand King, 1996). This management perspective, then, may blur thorough understandings\nof what actually goes on in the newsroom, informing the common held belief that jour-\nnalists are just too conservative to innovate (Smit, 2013). Following Ekdale et al. (2015),\nwho have countered this view as `to miss the point' (p. 955), this article assumes that a\nmore integrated view is needed to understand, for instance, the findings of these authors.\nThey show that journalists actually are open to innovation, provided their professional\nideology is not tampered with and their management demonstrates a clear vision, while\nit communicates unambiguously to newsroom workers what is expected of them.\nIn the larger context, media scholars stress the need for radical change and urge legacy\nmedia organizations to hurry, to escape `the valley of death' they are in (K\u00fcng, 2015:\nWestlund and Lewis, 2014). However, change just for the sake of it, even radical change,\nmay not be enough to ensure future survival of news organizations. Innovation is differ-\nent from change in that the former contains elements of novelty. Innovation thus may be\nviewed as part of organizational change, but not all organizational change relates to\ninnovation (Evans, 2016). Instead of viewing change, innovation and long-term survival\nas processes having to do with an adaptation to technology, a more productive and inclu-\nsive view may come from the perspective of resilient organizations (Seville, 2017).\nResilient organizations do more than merely adapt and survive the next external threat.\nInstead, they `are future-ready, with an inbuilt capacity not only to weather the storms of\nchange, but to be able to thrive in such environments'(Seville, 2017: 3). Resilient organi-\nzations, the author states, have an intrinsic drive to thrive and create their own new\nopportunities, while riding and exploring the waves of crises and changes. According to\nSeville, resilience emerges from an organizational culture that evolves around people\nfirst, not technology. The author sums up five major ingredients resilient organizations\ncannot do without: leadership, staff engagement, effective partnerships, situation aware-\nness and innovation and creativity. This article is mainly concerned with the last, and not\nthe least, two ingredients on the list.\nIn this article, a theoretical framework on ILC is introduced, where ILC is understood\nas a learning culture that drives and fosters innovation in the newsroom. It seeks to\naddress the overarching questions of what the cultural parameters for learning and inno-\nvation in the newsroom are and how professional journalists learn and innovate in it. In\nother words, does the newsroom culture allow for new ideas, and what are the drivers\nand obstacles for those new ideas to blossom and, ultimately, to lead to innovation in the\nnewsroom? Looking at the key reasons for exploring ILC, we can use ILC as a concep-\ntual perspective, a `looking glass', as well as an analytical tool to discover possible driv-\ners for, and obstacles of, innovation processes. This article is mainly concerned with\nintroducing ILC as a conceptual perspective.\nThe following pages are written with newspaper organizations in mind. Not only\nbecause the digital disruption seems to impact the newspaper industry more dramatically\nthan other legacy media (Evans, 2016). Print organizations also find it more difficult to\nchange than other news media do (Tameling, 2015). This may be due, at least in part, to\nthe largely unchanged print production processes until today. ILC takes an\ninterdisciplinary approach by building on empirical and theoretical insights not only\nfrom journalism studies but also from educational sciences, innovation studies and\norganizational sciences. This relevant body of literature is used to enrich the study of\ninnovation processes in journalism. The following paragraphs explain how a definition\nof ILC is derived, what this concept consists of, and how it fills gaps in the existing\nliterature.\nTheoretical context\nThe ultimate goal of using ILC as a concept is to discover to what extent the cultural\nprerequisites for innovation are actually present in the transforming newsroom, and how\nsuch a culture can be triggered and fostered to enhance innovation processes. By analys-\ning drivers and obstacles for ILC in the newsroom, newspapers can be helped to reinvent\nthemselves. The following definition of ILC is used:\ninnovative learning culture is a social climate that stimulates people to work and learn\ntogether, to grow as an individual and as a group (team, organization), and that provides\npeople with the autonomy needed to be flexible, to experiment, to be creative, and to investigate\nradical possibilities in order for the organization to have better chances for survival in the long\nrun. This is facilitated by serving leadership, open communication, mutual trust, a supporting\nculture, shared goals, appreciation of individual achievement, and training and development.\nILC as a concept builds upon prior insights regarding professional learning culture\n(PLC), a term coined by Oberon et al. (2014), and processes concerning explorative\nO'Reilly and Tushman, 2013). Expanding upon these authors, PLC and explorative inno-\nvation culture (EIC) have been conceptualized and are explicated in detail below. ILC is\nargued to be the conceptual sum of PLC and EIC (see Figure 1).\nPLC\nTo understand what PLC stands for, it is important to first look at its related concepts:\nculture, organizational culture, learning culture and PLC.\nCulture and organizational culture.How to view culture and organizational culture that\nstems from it? Smircich (1983) divides the research approaches to culture and organiza-\ntional culture into two strands: culture seen as a variable, something the organization has\n(and can be changed for managerial purposes), and culture regarded as a root metaphor,\nviewed as something an organization is. According to Smircich, organizations are cul-\ntures. Schein (1990) combines the two strands but predominantly sees culture as some-\nthing that is changeable. He views organizational culture as having three interrelated\nlevels of culture: external observable artefacts, internal values and even deeper underly-\ning basic assumptions. In reaction to Smircich's (1983) distinction, Grey (2009) sees two\nsorts of organizational cultures. One is a `real', spontaneous and informal one. That is, it\nis a culture `but it doesn't necessarily conform to what managers want'. The other is a\nformally `imposed' culture, `based on the idea that cultural values are hierarchically\ndefined, that is by senior managers or by head office' (Grey, 2009: 73).\nThese considerations give rise to the question to what extent organizational culture\nactually can be changed at all? Alvesson and Sveningsson (2008) see cultural change as\n`wishful thinking and fantasies' (p. 35) and are sceptical of the high expectations a large\npart of the organizational literature seems to foster. The authors do, however, build upon\nSchein's mental model approach, adding the `construction of meaning and sense making'\n(Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2008: 37) and how these are expressed in language, stories\nand rituals: `culture refers to what stands behind and guides behaviour rather than the\nbehaviour as such' (p. 36). Not only can an organizational culture be expressed in terms\nof language, stories and rituals but also its meanings are shaped by organizational mem-\nbers, as culture is produced in social interaction and the processes that derive from these\ninteractions (Pantjes, 2013). Based on these authors, for the purpose of this article, the\nfollowing definition of organizational culture will be considered:\norganizational culture is the whole of conscious and unconscious assumptions, norms and\nvalues of members of an organization (or group), processed by spontaneous construction and\ndynamic sense making among members, resulting in concrete expressions or artefacts.\nThis definition is the basic understanding of how a learning culture that fosters inno-\nvation is viewed in this article. It is assumed that all cultural aspects of an organization\nare part of organizational culture. Hence, learning culture, PLC and ILC are part of\norganizational culture.\nLearning culture and PLC.For an organization to innovate at all, it has to be open to\nchange and cannot do without a strong learning culture that improves innovative capa-\nbilities (Heijboer et al., 2013). A learning culture is about allowing creativity and flexi-\nbility into the organization, according to Van Der Merwe and Quinlan (2010). In the\neducational sciences literature, learning culture is not an unknown term when dealing\nwith pupils or students. Where the learning culture of teachers is concerned, the term\nprofessional learning culture is used (Oberon et al., 2014). Only those organizations that\nencourage a true culture of learning among their members have the best chances to inno-\nvate (Cameron and Quinn, 2011; Heijboer et al., 2013), to obtain advantages over the\ntransform themselves by creating new knowledge (Schenke, 2015) and to\nFigure 1. ILC displayed as the conceptual sum of PLC and EIC.\nsurvive disruptions in the long run (March, 1991; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2013). Exact\ndefinitions of learning culture, however, are scarce. The term is generally used in an\ninformal way to indicate a social context or climate that is favourable to learning (Baars-\nVan Moorsel, 2003). Heijboer et al. (2013) describe learning culture as `a collective,\ndynamic system of basic assumptions, values and norms, that guides how people learn in\nan organization' (p. 6), based on Schein (1990). Learning culture then is an observable\nartefact, steered by experienced norms as well as more deeper underlying basic assump-\ntions, the latter being unobservable. Both Heijboer et al. (2013) and Pantjes (2013),\nbased on Watkins and Marsick (1996), consider a learning culture to be a collective\nlearning culture, and not an individual learning culture. Only a collective learning culture\ncan make sure continuous learning in the organization takes place. Pantjes (2013) distin-\nguishes three key characteristics (leadership, collaboration and communication) that dif-\nfer in individual and collective learning cultures. In an individual learning culture, the\nfocus is on formal education, predominantly in official courses, the leadership style is\ndirective, there is little collaboration between the organizational members and communi-\ncation is said to be one-sided or closed. In a collective learning culture, on the other hand,\nthere is formal and informal learning, the leadership style is participative, among the\nmembers there is considerable collaboration and there is an open and transparent dia-\nlogue in the organization.\nIn trying to get a grip on collective learning culture, strikingly, neither Heijboer et al.\n(2013) nor Pantjes (2013) mention trust as an element. While it is trust that seems to be\na key condition to be able to learn collectively. Wenger et al. (2002) state, when speaking\nabout communities of practices:\nLearning requires an atmosphere of openness. Each community develops a unique atmosphere\n[...] the key is to build a foundation for collective inquiry. An effective community of practice\noffers a place of exploration where it is safe to speak the truth and ask hard questions. Trust is\nkey to this process. (p. 37)\nAnother argument to include trust as a key element is that trust is needed to be able to\nfirmly discuss and to debate matters, and not avoid conflicts. As Wenger et al. (2002)\nstate, strong communities cannot do without conflict as `members can even use conflict\nas a way to deepen their relationships and their learning' (p. 37). The aspect of trust\ncomes back in the educational research literature (Oberon et al., 2014). In the literature\non resilient organizations, this theme returns as `high trust', which resilient organizations\ncannot do without (Seville, 2017: 18). Based on these authors, it seems logical to view\ntrust as an important element for a strong learning culture in an organization. Oberon\net al. (2014) define their PLC in schools as `a climate in which all members in a school\nwork together to reflect, to research and to professionalize' (p. 6). This definition can be\nseen as an integration of the earlier mentioned aspects of learning culture from other\nauthors. Oberon et al. (2014) also make an explicit distinction between characteristics of\nPLC (collaboration, learning from each other, inquiring attitude) and conditions for a\nPLC (leadership, communication, support, mutual trust). Based on Oberon et al. (2014),\nPLC's definition is the following:\nprofessional learning culture is a social climate in which all members of a newsroom learn by\nworking together to reflect, to research and to professionalize. This is facilitated by serving\nleadership, clear communication, support among the members, and mutual trust in each other\nand in the organization.\nHaving dealt with PLC, we continue with EIC, which constitutes the other conceptual\npart of ILC.\nEIC\nInnovation is the implementation of an idea into a market or a social setting (Fagerberg,\n2005). For organizations to survive in the long run, the execution of both exploitative and\nMarch (1991) defines exploitative innovation in terms of exploiting old certainties, char-\nacterized by refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation and\nexecution. He describes explorative innovation as exploring new possibilities, character-\nized by search, variation, risk-taking, experimenting, play, flexibility, discovery and\ninnovation. In the newsroom, explorative innovation may translate into discovering and\nexperimenting with new ways of reaching audiences, other ways of working, novel ways\nof thinking and using tools that may lead to new business opportunities.\nThe orientation of people within print newsrooms, however, is predominantly still\na predominance of a culture of exploitative innovation. Storsul and Krumsvik (2013)\nfind that in media organizations, as elsewhere, most innovations are incremental and\ninvolve small changes in products or processes that do not challenge the logic of the\nmarket. For the newspaper industry, this means that by doing what it always has done,\nit will find itself challenged or disrupted by outsiders who are more engaged in\nexplorative innovation. By doing so, the newspaper business risks obsoleteness\nAccording to March (1991), the efficiency and short term rationality of organizations\ntend to lead automatically to exploitative innovation with its typical lack of experiments,\nand its precise and predictable outcomes. The author sees this tendency as `potentially\nself-destructive' (March, 1991: 73) for an organization. March's statements date from\nlong before the Internet, Google and Facebook disrupted the news industry. Since explo-\nration is vital to newspapers' long-term survival as it informs the ability to reinvent\nthemselves, the question is whether and how explorative innovation is actually triggered\nand fostered in print newsrooms. Newspapers with an online presence may just be copy-\ning their competitors, rather than harvest the fruits of their own explorative innovation.\nFurthermore, research has shown that online journalism seems to be less innovative than\nmany scholars had foreseen (Steensen, 2009), leaving questions open to why this is pos-\nsible. One explanation for this may lie in the somewhat adventurous side of explorative\ninnovation. Experimenting without knowing the outcome beforehand can be quite\nexpensive (March, 1991). Another explanation may lie in the observation that new tech-\nnology alone is no guarantee innovation takes place (Borger, 2016).\nBased on the apparent poor explorative innovational capabilities of newsrooms\nsity to explore for legacy media in trying to survive (K\u00fcng, 2015; O'Reilly and Tushman,\n2013), ILC encompasses an inherent focus on EIC. As mentioned before, it is this type\nof innovation culture that is specifically called for in legacy print newsrooms to avoid\nextinction (March, 1991; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2013). To come to a definition of EIC,\ndifferent authors are taken into account. Following Oberon et al. (2014) with PLC, we\nlook for characteristics of, as well as conditions for, EIC. The following eight charac-\nteristics are found, based on March (1991) and O'Reilly and Tushman (2013): insecu-\nrity (of the outcome of innovation), (re)search/investigation, discovery, autonomous,\ncreative, experimental, flexible and radical. The conditions for EIC are based on Bartlett\nand Goshal (1989) and Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004): trust, support, supporting cul-\nture, shared goals, collective identity, appreciation of individual achievement, training\nand development and culture of excellence. Based on these, we adopt the following\ndefinition:\nexplorative innovation culture is a social climate in which people are supported to (relatively)\nautonomously investigate, experiment, be flexible and learn to develop creative new and/or\nradical ideas, products, services or ways of working that ultimately will improve the news\norganization's market position and increase its chances of survival in the long run. This is\nfacilitated by trust, supporting culture, shared goals, collective identity, appreciation of\nindividual achievement, training and development, and a culture of excellence.\nWith both critical ingredients present, we can now look at what they mean for ILC. As\nmentioned earlier, ILC is the conceptual sum of PLC and EIC. When looking at the char-\nacteristics and conditions for both, we see both overlap and differences between the two\nconcepts. To start with the differences, PLC is aimed, literally, at learning while working\ntogether. It is about togetherness: working together \u00ad while reflecting, investigating and\nprofessionalizing \u00ad to grow with each other. EIC's focus is on searching and experiment-\ning, stressing the relative autonomy needed for the individual or a small group to do so,\ninstead of doing this collectively. The individual and his or her achievement count.\nTogetherness is an option, not a necessity. EIC, however, does support the individual(s)\nengaged in explorative innovation. The overlap between the two concerns the room the\norganization provides its members to develop. After the elimination of synonyms, seven\ncharacteristics and seven conditions for ILC remain.\nTo arrive at these ILC characteristics and conditions, the following process has been\nadopted. `Learning from each other' has been favoured over `collaboration', as the for-\nmer is the fruit of collaboration that is considered relevant here, and `inquiring attitude'\nhas been eliminated in favour of `(re)search/investigation', as the latter term is consid-\nered more specific. Both `insecurity' and `discovery' have been discarded; the former is\nan intrinsic aspect of all things `experimental' and as such has been viewed as overlap.\nThe second may or may not be an outcome of `experimental'or `(re)search/investigation'\nand, with respect to ILC, is regarded less crucial than the process that could lead towards\nit. For conditions, `support' has been eliminated in favour of the more richer term `sup-\nportive culture'which refers to a larger culture perceived as being supportive, rather than\nthe incidental support given in a certain situation. Furthermore, `mutual trust' has been\nfavoured over `trust' as the former expresses better its reciprocate core, and `culture of\nexcellence' has been discarded for reasons of irrelevancy. `Excellence' is inclined to be\ndefined as what is `known' to be excellent, whereas the future outcomes of explorative\ninnovation are insecure by their very nature. `Collective identity', finally, has been elimi-\nnated because it would, at most, only refer to the PLC part of ILC. To sum up, the seven\ncharacteristics of ILC, and their brief definitions, are as follows:\n1. Learning from each other learning from others in the workplace community\n2. (Re)search/investigation investigation aimed at improving (one's) work\n3. Experimental trying out new possibilities with insecure outcomes\n4. Autonomous agency to make decisions about (one's own) work\n5. Creative inspiring the development of new ideas\n6. Radical stimulating all that is very different from the usual\n7. Flexible capacity of people to easily adjust, switch or change\nThe seven conditions for ILC, and their brief definitions, are as follows:\n1. Leadership \nmanagement focussing on enabling people to change\n2. Communication open dialogue between members in the organization\n3. Mutual trust people trusting each other in the organization\n4. Supporting culture\nclimate wherein receiving support is self-evident\n5. Shared goals\nworkers and management pursuing the same targets\n6. Appreciation \nexplicit appreciation of individual success\n7. Training & development systematic attention for the development of people\nRelevance\nIn the following sections, it is shown how ILC can be relevant to the empirical study of\nnewsroom transformation and how it may add to the literature on media innovation\ntheory.\nEmpirical relevance\nFrom the new millennium and onwards, scholars of journalism studies and media inno-\nvation have been focussing mainly on how newsrooms adapt to the new technological\nreality, rather than on newsrooms' capacity to reinvent themselves. The latter entails a\nlarger scope than just reacting to external incentives, as it taps into the intrinsic resilience\nof a newsroom, hardly researched in journalism studies. This inherently leaves a poten-\ntial area of research waiting to be addressed. ILC can be an instrument to access this\nunder-researched area.\nIn the larger part of newsroom studies, the focus on management, which sees culture\nas a problem, appears to be dominant. A closer look of these aspects illustrates to what\nextent they relate to ILC.\nManagement. The fact that technological change in the newsroom is most often a man-\nagement decision has not gone unnoticed in the literature (MacGregor, 1997; Singer,\n2004a). It is a so-called authority innovation decision (Rogers, 2003) as opposed to a\ncollectively or an individually made one. This may have consequences for the adoption\nand, hence, the diffusion of innovation (Rogers, 2003). Change processes in the news-\nroom are therefore to be regarded as socially constructed, whereby technology is an\ninstrument for other goals to be achieved, for example, to enhance the quality of journal-\nism or the quality of production processes. Goals may also encompass efficiency, such as\ngetting more production out of multi-skilled and flexible resources (Saltzis and Dickin-\nson, 2008), or cost-cutting through lay-offs as a result of reorganizations (Cottle and\nAshton, 1999; Saltzis and Dickinson, 2008). Hence, some newsroom studies are specifi-\ncally concerned with management issues on how to manage transformation processes\nand if these goals are achieved or not (Gade, 2004; Gade and Perry, 2003; Gade and\nILC, however, focusses on what happens in the newsroom with respect to what pre-\ncedes an actual innovation, as it is concerned with the available room for new ideas to\nblossom (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986). The focal interest thus is to discover to what\nextent people in the newsroom experience an ILC that triggers and fosters explorative\ninnovation, as mentioned earlier. As ILC refers to a specific culture in the newsroom,\nthe concept can be operationalized in quantitative as well as qualitative research instru-\nments, which allows for measuring the perceptions of ILC of both journalists and their\nmanagers. This is briefly explored at the end of this paragraph. By avoiding a manage-\nment-centred view on change, this enhances a more nuanced picture of newsroom\ntransformation.\nCulture clashes. Empirical newsroom studies typically have focussed on the impact of\ntechnological innovation on journalistic work practices, the quality of journalistic prod-\nucts and the management of these processes. Interestingly, a good part of the findings of\nthese studies appears to be more about culture clashes in the newsroom as a result of\ntransformation, than about the diffusion of technology, which was the primary aspect\nsome of these studies were set out to measure.\nTransformational processes have been reported on, in some studies, with moderate\noptimism. The quality of journalistic products has not been altered by these processes, at\nstate. Technological innovation processes have also triggered American journalists to see\nclear advantages for themselves as a result of the transformation, despite consistent cul-\ntural issues that need to be overcome (Singer, 2004a).\nDespite this optimism, the outcome of the bulk of newsroom studies is that making\nthe transition from a traditional print newsroom to a more online oriented one is quite\nhard to achieve. This may not come as a surprise, as newsrooms find themselves in a\nparadigm shift, being forced economically to trade a 20th-century offer-focussed produc-\ntion model for a 21st-century demand-focussed one (Domingo et al., 2007). This can\nresult in fear and anxiety, and hence in clashes in the newsroom (Killebrew, 2003).\nDifferent newsroom studies show culture clashes as a result of transformation. Gade\n(2004) finds a clash of cultures between `the core values of two cultures \u00ad marketing and\njournalism' (p. 45). Van den Bulck and Tambuyzer (2013) even distinguish several cul-\nture clashes: `between organizational versus professional [...] culture [...], between the\nimpact of technological versus human factors [...] and between news managers and\nnews workers' (p. 54).\nThe biggest culture clashes, however, seem to occur between management and news-\nroom workers. Perceptions of transformation and their effects typically seem to differ\n2013). Different authors give different words to this phenomenon. Gade (2004) described\nit as a `gulf' (p. 45) between marketing and journalism, Quinn (2005) states it to be `the\nfundamental dichotomy'between a business ideal and a journalistic ideal (p. 29) and Van\nDen Bulck and Tambuyzer (2013) speak about multiple `collisions of convergence' all\nclosely related to a clash between `organizational and professional [...] culture' (p. 54).\nThese different perceptions of transformation between journalists and management seem\nIn these studies, management is, at least in part, held accountable for their outdated\nmanagement structures, their poor communication and coaching skills and their vague-\nness in general of how to translate transformation processes into everyday practices for\nTameling, 2015; Tameling and Broersma, 2013). But at the same time in these studies\njournalists are seen as being reluctant to change because of their professional culture\nThis culture, however, most often has not been defined in a way that it can be operation-\nalized. Using ILC, focussing on learning and innovation processes of both management\nand news workers, professional culture in the innovating newsroom can be made more\ntangible and, hence, more accessible to eventual transformation.\nProfessional identity. In earlier as well as present newsroom studies, it is suggested that the\napparent reluctance of journalists to change lies in what journalists perceive transforma-\ntion to mean for their professional role as a journalist, as it may endanger their ability to\nproduce quality journalism (Beam, 2006; Cottle and Ashton, 1999; Daniels and Holli-\n2015). In short, when transformation is perceived as incompatible with, or entrenching\nupon, journalistic norms and professional identity, transformation is regarded as rather\nnegative. If it is true, as Ekdale et al. (2015) point out, that journalists are not opposed to\nchange or innovation per se, this poses questions currently not addressed, such as how do\njournalists actually take in new things? How do they, the newsroom workers, actually\nlearn in the newsroom? To what extent do journalists perceive a learning culture in the\nnewsroom that fosters change and innovation? And how do they keep up with techno-\nlogical developments while proper training is often been denied to journalists, even when\nThe concept of ILC can be operationalized into different research instruments to\naddress these kinds of questions. The focus of this article is a conceptual one, but to\ntouch briefly upon the operationalization of the ILC concept, a mixed-methods research\napproach seems suitable. One can think of measuring perceptions of the characteristics\nand conditions of ILC in a survey, distributed among newsroom management and work-\ners. This can be followed up with interviews with management and workers, not only to\nvalidate the survey results but also to ask them whether they can explain the outcomes of\nthe survey. Together with a separate ethnographic study, focussing on the characteristics\nand conditions of ILC in the newsroom with respect to new ideas, this could round up a\nnewsroom study that seeks to answer to what extent, and how, ILC is being perceived,\nand what happens with new ideas in the newsroom.\nTheoretical relevance\nThe media landscape is innovating and scholars increasingly refer to the innovation con-\ncept, but at the same time notice an academic gap, as it misses more theoretical and\n(2016), the innovation speak in both journalism and journalism studies has been so `ram-\npant' (p. 1) that it is turning into a problem, `because many institutions may strive for\ninnovation without enough reflection on what that term actually means to them' (pp.\n1\u00ad2). For an overview of the literature on innovation theory, see Crossan and Apaydin\nDogruel (2014, 2015) sees a limitation in the current literature on media innova-\ntion with its narrow focus on diffusion, adoption and acceptance of the final techno-\nlogical innovation product that enters a market or is implemented in a media\norganization. This largely ignores the design and development stages of innovation.\nInnovation theory, however, stresses that innovation encompasses an entire cycle\nfrom its invention \u00ad an idea \u00ad to its diffusion or implementation (Kline and Rosenberg,\n1986). Dogruel calls for an integrated approach that fits the innovation cycle in all its\nphases. ILC as a concept answers Dogruel's call. It focusses on learning processes in\nthe newsroom and takes an inherent interest in the initial phases of innovation devel-\nopment (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986), which starts with a new idea, and the room for\ndevelopment of that new idea. Learning processes may also entail the whole innova-\ntion cycle, from idea to diffusion, therefore answering Dogruel's call for an integrated\napproach.\nThe biggest gap in the media innovation literature, however, seems to be the scarcity\nin scholarly attention to learning and innovation processes of professional journalists in\ninnovating newsrooms. This is striking, because innovation, as mentioned earlier, is\ninextricably linked to learning processes: without learning there is no innovation.\nHowever, for people to be able to learn at all, a social climate with a certain level of trust\nis needed to allow for people to learn, experiment, dare to make mistakes and dare to\ndisagree (Seville, 2017; Wenger et al., 2002). In the context of resilient news organiza-\ntions, this asks for a perspective that inherently looks at the development of people first\nand then technology, not the other way around (Seville, 2017). This is when ILC as a new\nperspective can step in when operationalized. When doing so, and following Tavakoli\n(2010), it may be the case that current culture clashes in transforming newsrooms will be\nseen in a more productive light and hence, not as a `clash' any more.\nConclusion\nIn this article, it is argued that the concept of ILC can constitute a new lens to look at\nnewsroom learning and innovation processes, an under-researched area. With the defini-\ntion of ILC and its underlying characteristics and conditions, the concept can be opera-\ntionalized in further research. With an ILC perspective, including both management and\njournalists, culture in the newsroom can be made more tangible than is found in the lit-\nerature thus far. This may result in insights in how professionals in the newsroom actu-\nally learn and innovate, and to what extent a learning culture allows them to do so in the\nfirst place. ILC can detect the drivers and obstacles for newsroom learning and innova-\ntion processes that have not been identified earlier, as newsrooms have not been consid-\nered from a learning culture perspective before. Furthermore, with ILC a closer look can\nbe taken at the newsroom's own capabilities for innovation, as ILC taps into the intrinsic\nresilience and creativity of the newsroom.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAlvesson M and Sveningsson S (2008) Organizational culture and change.
