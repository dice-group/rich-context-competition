    "abstract": "Abstract\nA man whose romantic partner is sexually unfaithful is at risk of sperm competition and cuckoldry--unwitting investment in\noffspring to whom he is genetically unrelated. Men, therefore, may have evolved mechanisms to solve the adaptive problems of\nsperm competition and cuckoldry. The current research investigates another potential anti-cuckoldry tactic: reducing in-pair\ncopulation (IPC) duration, thereby more quickly placing his sperm into competition. We hypothesize that IPC duration will be\nnegatively correlated with female infidelity (Hypothesis 1). We further hypothesize that IPC duration will be negatively correlated\nwith sexual coercion (Hypothesis 2). Results of Study 1 (men's reports, n \u00bc 410) indicate that both men's perceptions of female\ninfidelity and men's sexual coercion predict shorter IPC duration. Results of Study 2 (women's reports, n \u00bc 455) did not provide\nstatistical support for the study hypotheses. The current research provides an initial investigation of men's adjustment of\ncopulatory duration and suggests that men reduce IPC duration and ejaculate more quickly at the couple's most recent copu-\nlation, in response to greater risk of sperm competition and in the context of sexual coercion.\n",

Shackelford1\n Keywords\nsperm competition, sexual coercion, infidelity, in-pair copulation, cuckoldry\nSperm competition occurs when the sperm of two or more\nmales simultaneously occupy a female's reproductive tract and\ncompete to fertilize the ova (Parker, 1970). Sperm competition\nhas been demonstrated or inferred to exist in many species,\n& Moller, 1992). A recurrent context for sperm competition\nin humans is female infidelity or extra-pair copulation (Baker\nSmith, 1984). A man whose long-term partner pursues extra-\npair copulations is at risk of sperm competition and subsequent\ncuckoldry--unwitting investment in offspring to whom he is\ngenetically unrelated. Cuckoldry has likely been a recurrent\nadaptive problem for humans (Baker & Bellis, 1995; Buss &\nBecause human males often invest in their putative offspring\nof cuckoldry can be substantial (Leivers & Simmons, 2014).\nMen, therefore, may have evolved anti-cuckoldry tactics to\nprevent or to participate in sperm competition to guard their\npaternity (Platek & Shackelford, 2006; Shackelford et al.,\nin-pair copulations (IPCs; Pham, Shackelford, Holden, Zeigler-\nHill, Hummel, & Memering, 2014; Shackelford, Goetz, Guta,\n& Schmitt, 2006), sexually coercing IPCs (Goetz & Shackel-\nford, 2006; reviewed in Goetz, Shackelford, & Camilleri,\n2008), semen-displacing copulatory behaviors (Gallup et al.,\nGallup, 2004), and adjustments in parental investment (Platek,\nBurch, Panyavin, Wesserman, & Gallup, 2002).\nThe current research investigates another potential anti-\ncuckoldry tactic: reducing IPC duration. Men who perceive\ngreater sperm competition risk report increased urgency to\ncopulate with their in-pair partner, which, in part, reflects an\nurgency to submit sperm into competition (Shackelford et al.,\n1 Department of Psychology, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nNicole Barbaro, 108 Pryale Hall, Department of Psychology, Oakland\nEmail: nmbarbar@oakland.edu\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nSpiess, Geer, & O'Donohue, 1984). Because sexual behavior is\ncaused proximately by sexual arousal, reducing ejaculatory\nlatency and, therefore, copulatory duration, affords quicker\nentry into sperm competition. We hypothesize that, in humans,\nIPC duration will be negatively correlated with female infide-\nlity (Hypothesis 1).\nWomen attempt to delay IPC following copulation with\nanother man (Gallup, Burch, & Mitchell, 2006), suggesting that\nwomen may manipulate sperm competition in favor of an extra-\npair partner. In contrast, men report greater sexual interest in\ntheir partner and greater urgency to copulate with their partner\nfollowing suspicions of her infidelity (Pham & Shackelford,\nconflict, men may attempt to counter women's resistance to IPC\nby deploying tactics of sexual coercion to gain sexual access to\ntheir partner and quickly enter into sperm competition.\nMen at greater risk of sperm competition report more fre-\nquent use of sexual coercion (McKibbin, Starratt, Shackelford,\n& Goetz, 2011), and women who self-report infidelity also\nreport that their partner is more sexually coercive (Goetz &\nrisk, including men who perceive greater risk of partner infi-\ndelity, report greater upset in response to a partner's resistance\n2007), and this upset is positively associated with men's self-\nreports and women's partner reports of sexual coercion (Shack-\nelford & Goetz, 2004). Research in other animals corroborates\nthe hypothesis that sexual coercion may function as an anti-\ncuckoldry tactic (Barash, 1997; McKinney, Cheng, & Brug-\ngers, 1984). In many socially monogamous birds, for example,\nforced IPC reliably occurs immediately following female\nextra-pair copulation (Bailey, Seymour, & Stewart, 1978;\nResearch with other animals also indicates that forced copu-\nlations are shorter in duration than nonforced copulations. For\nexample, males of several species of waterfowl (family Anati-\ndae) often perform precopulatory displays prior to nonforced\nIPCs (McKinney, Derrickson, & Mineau, 1983). During forced\nIPCs, however, males do not perform precopulatory displays\n(McKinney et al., 1983). This suggests that males may be\nattempting to inseminate the female quickly by eliminating\nprecopulatory displays, affording males the opportunity to\nmore quickly enter their sperm into competition. Similarly,\nsneak copulations in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are shorter\nin duration than courtship copulations (Pilastro, Mandelli,\nGasparini, Dadda, & Bisazza, 2007), and males who specialize\nin sneak copulations experience greater sperm competition--as\nindexed by their larger relative testes size (Taborsky, 1998). In\nother species, reduced copulatory duration may also function to\nminimize detection by another male. However, men in intimate\nrelationships already have regular access to their partner and\nreduced copulatory duration is less likely to be an attempt to\nreduce detection from a rival male and more likely to be\nimplemented as an anti-cuckoldry tactic.\nOn the basis of this comparative research, we anticipate that\nsexually coercive men may also reduce IPC duration.\nTherefore, we hypothesize that IPC duration will be negatively\ncorrelated with sexual coercion (Hypothesis 2). However, sex-\nual coercion in human intimate relationships can take more\nsubtle forms than physically forced copulation (Goetz &\nphysical force to obtain sexual access to their partner risk\nincurring severe costs, including their partner's defection from\nthe relationship (Goetz & Shackelford, 2006). Men, therefore,\nuse more subtle forms of sexual coercion before resorting to\nphysical force. Shackelford and Goetz (2004) identified three\ncomponents of sexual coercion that men use in intimate rela-\ntionships: (1) Commitment Manipulation (e.g., ``I told my\npartner that if she loved me she would have sex with me''),\n(2) Defection Threat (e.g., ``I threatened to have sex with\nanother woman if my partner did not have sex with me''), and\n(3) Resource Manipulation/Violence (e.g., ``I withheld bene-\nfits that my partner depends on to get her to have sex with\nme''; ``I threatened to physically force my partner to have sex\nwith me'').\nIn summary, we propose that, in response to suspicions of\nfemale infidelity, men deploy anti-cuckoldry tactics to enter\ntheir sperm into competition to guard their paternity. Specifi-\ncally, following perceptions of female infidelity, men may use\nsexual coercion to counter women's resistance to IPC and\nquickly inseminate their partner to increase their chances of\nsuccess in sperm competition. We conducted two independent\nstudies to test two hypotheses derived from sperm competition\ntheory. In Study 1, we secured men's reports on the target\nvariables, and in Study 2, we secured women's reports on these\nsame variables.\nStudy 1: Men's Reports\nStudy 1 secured men's reports to test the hypothesized relation-\nships between perceptions of female infidelity, sexual coer-\ncion, and IPC duration. Following Goetz and Shackelford\n(2006), we operationalized sperm competition risk as men's\nperceptions of their partner's past infidelity and likelihood of\nfuture infidelity.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 410 men in a committed, heterosexual, sexual\nrelationship for at least 1 month. The mean age of participants\nwas 24.6 years (SD \u00bc 8.0), the mean age of the men's partners\nwas 23.3 years (SD \u00bc 7.4), and the mean relationship length was\n39.0 months (SD \u00bc 61.3). Approximately half of the participants\nwere university students, and the other half of participants\nwere from communities surrounding the university where the\nresearch was conducted.\nMaterials\nParticipants completed an anonymous survey that requested\ndemographic information, including the participant's age, their\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\npartner's age, and the length of their relationship. Participants\nthen answered questions about their partner's infidelities, their\nown use of sexually coercive tactics, and their most recent IPC.\nPartner's infidelity. Men were asked four questions about their\npartner's infidelity: ``As far as you know, has your current\npartner had sexual intercourse [fallen in love] with someone\nother than you since you have been involved in a relationship\ntogether?''; How likely do you think it is that your current\npartner will in the future have sexual intercourse [fall in love]\nwith someone other than you, while in a relationship with\nyou?'' Men responded to each question on a 10-point Likert-\ntype scale ranging from 0 (definitely no/not at all likely) to 9\n(definitely yes/extremely likely). We calculated the mean of the\nresponses to the four questions to create a composite variable\nfemale infidelity (a \u00bc .71) for each participant as an indicator of\nsperm competition risk.\nIPC duration. Men reported on the relative duration of their last\ncopulation with their partner in which the man ejaculated as a\nresult of penetrative, penile-vaginal sex, by responding to the\nquestion ``In comparison to what is typical, how long did sex-\nual intercourse with your partner last?'' on a 10-point Likert-\ntype scale ranging from 0 (much less time than is typical) to 9\n(much more time than is typical). We asked participants to\nindicate the relative length of time that copulation lasted, rather\nthan absolute length of time (e.g., in minutes) that copulation\nlasted. On average, IPC duration in humans is approximately\nfive to six minutes; however, IPC duration can, in rare\ninstances, last upward of 45 minutes (Waldinger et al., 2005).\nBy assessing relative copulation duration, we are able to con-\ntrol for individual differences in participant's average length of\nIPC that, for example, may be influenced by motivations to\nsexually please a romantic partner.\nSexual coercion. The Sexual Coercion in Intimate Relationships\nScale (SCIRS; Shackelford & Goetz, 2004) was used to assess\nmen's use of sexually coercive acts in their current relationship.\nThe SCIRS asks how often men performed 34 sexually coer-\ncive acts in the past one month. Participants respond to each\nitem on a 6-point scale (0 \u00bc act never occurred; 1 \u00bc act\noccurred 1 time; 2 \u00bc act occurred 2 times; 3 \u00bc act occurred\nmore times). Responses to each statement were recoded as the\nmidpoint of the response category the participant reported. For\nexample, if the participant reported an act occurring ``3\u00ad5 times\nin the past month,'' the response was recoded as occurring\n4 times in the past month. Responses indicating ``act occurred\n11 or more times'' were recoded as occurring 15 times in the past\nmonth. The SCIRS assesses three components: Commitment\nManipulation, Defection Threat, and Resource Manipulation/\nViolence (see above for sample items). Following Shackelford\nand Goetz (2004), composite scores were calculated by sum-\nming the recoded response category midpoints for the appropri-\nate items, yielding a composite score for each participant for\noverall sexual coercion and each sexual coercion component.\nProcedure\nThe current research was approved by the institutional review\nboard at the university at which the research was conducted.\nParticipants who met the following criteria were eligible for the\ncurrent study: (1) male, (2) at least 18 years old, and (3) cur-\nrently in a committed, heterosexual, sexual relationship for at\nleast 1 month. Prospective participants arrived at a specified\nlocation and read a consent form. Participants who met the\ncriteria and agreed to participate completed a survey and\nreturned the completed survey to the researcher in an\nunmarked, sealed envelope.\nResults\nZero-order correlations and descriptive statistics for the target\nvariables are reported in Table 1. Relationship length was not\ncorrelated with the predictor variables (i.e., female infidelity\nand sexual coercion) and is therefore not included as a con-\nfounding variable in subsequent analyses. We calculated a\nzero-order correlation between perceived female infidelity and\nIPC duration to test whether female infidelity--as a measure of\nsperm competition risk--is associated with shorter IPC dura-\ntion. The result supports Hypothesis 1 in that greater perceived\nsperm competition risk is correlated with shorter IPC duration\n(see Table 1).\nTable 1. Study 1: Men's Reports.

The result\nprovides support for Hypothesis 2 in that that men who report\nmore frequent use of sexually coercive Commitment Manipu-\nlation acts also report shorter IPC duration (see Table 1). A\nmultiple linear regression was conducted as a more stringent\ntest of Hypothesis 2. The three sexual coercion components\n(Commitment Manipulation, Defection Threat, and Resource\nManipulation/Violence) were simultaneously entered into the\nregression analysis, with IPC duration as the dependent vari-\nable (see Table 2). Men's use of sexually coercive Commit-\nment Manipulation acts remained the best predictor of IPC\nduration, approaching statistical significance (p \u00bc .07).\nStudy 2: Women's Reports\nMen's reports of their partner's infidelities and their use of\nsexual coercion may be inaccurate (Dobash, Dobash, Cava-\nsecured reports from an independent sample of women to\nexamine the hypothesized relationships between female infide-\nlity, men's use of sexual coercion, and IPC duration.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 455 women in a committed, heterosexual,\nsexual relationship for at least 1 month. Women in this study\nwere not necessarily partnered to the men in Study 1. The mean\nage of the participant was 22.1 years (SD \u00bc 5.7), the mean age\nof the women's partner was 24.4 years (SD \u00bc 6.9), and the\nmean relationship length was 31.4 months (SD \u00bc 41.8 months).\nApproximately half of the participants were university stu-\ndents, and the other half of participants were from communities\nsurrounding the university where the research was conducted.\nMaterials\nThe survey used in Study 2 was parallel to the survey used in\nStudy 1, with appropriate replacement of gender-relevant\nterms.\nSelf-reported infidelity. Women were asked four questions to\nassess their past infidelities and the likelihood of committing\nfuture infidelities. Women responded ``yes'' or ``no'' to the\nquestion: ``Have you had sexual intercourse with someone\nother than your current partner since you have been involved\nin a relationship with your current partner?'' Dichotomous\nresponses to the past sexual infidelity question were recoded\nsuch that a ``no'' response was recoded ``0,'' and a ``yes''\nresponse was recoded ``9.'' Women also responded to the ques-\ntions: ``Have you fallen in love with someone other than your\ncurrent partner since you have been involved in a relationship\nwith your current partner?'' and ``How likely do you think it is\nthat you will in the future have sexual intercourse [fall in love]\nwith someone other than your current partner, while in a rela-\ntionship with your current partner?'' Women responded to\nthese questions on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from\n0 (definitely no/not at all likely) to 9 (definitely yes/extremely\nlikely). We then averaged responses to the four questions to\ncreate a composite variable female infidelity (a \u00bc .60) for each\nparticipant as an indicator of sperm competition risk.\nIPC duration. In parallel with Study 1, women reported on the\nrelative duration of their last copulation with their partner in\nwhich their partner ejaculated as a result of penetrative, penile-\nvaginal sex, by responding to the question ``In comparison to\nwhat is typical, how long did sexual intercourse with your\npartner last?'' on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0\n(much less time than is typical) to 9 (much more time than is\ntypical).\nPartner's use of sexual coercion. In parallel with Study 1, women\ncompleted the SCIRS (Shackelford & Goetz, 2004) to report\ntheir partner's use of sexual coercion. Following Shackelford\nand Goetz (2004), we calculated participant's composite scores\nfor overall sexual coercion and each sexual coercion compo-\nnent (i.e., Commitment Manipulation, Defection Threat, and\nResource Manipulation/Violence).\nProcedure\nThe current research was approved by the institutional review\nboard at the university at which the research was conducted.\nParticipants who met the following criteria were eligible for the\ncurrent study: (1) female, (2), at least 18 years old, and (3)\ncurrently in a committed, heterosexual, sexual relationship for\nat least 1 month.

The correlations between\nthe three sexual coercion components and IPC duration were\nnot statistically significant (see Table 3). A multiple linear\nregression was conducted as a more stringent test of Hypothesis\n2. The three sexual coercion components (Commitment Manip-\nulation, Defection Threat, and Resource Manipulation/Vio-\nlence) were simultaneously entered into the regression\nanalysis, with IPC duration as the dependent variable (see\nTable 4). Women's reports of their partner's use of sexually\ncoercive Defection Threat acts were the best predictor of IPC\nduration, approaching statistical significance (p \u00bc .07).\nGeneral Discussion\nThe results of Study 1 (men's reports) support Hypothesis 1 in\nthat perceptions of female infidelity are correlated with shorter\nrelative IPC duration. The results of Study 1 also support\nHypothesis 2 in that men's use of sexually coercive Commit-\nment Manipulation is correlated with shorter relative IPC dura-\ntion. The results of Study 2 (women's reports), however, do not\nprovide statistical support for Hypotheses 1 and 2: The correla-\ntion between women's self-reported infidelities and IPC dura-\ntion, and between women's reports of their partner's use of\nsexually coercive acts and IPC duration, is not statistically\nsignificant.\nTests of Hypothesis 1 investigated whether IPC duration is\nshorter in response to sperm competition risk--operationalized\nas female infidelity. Men's reports indicate that as perception\nof sperm competition risk increases, the duration of IPC\ndecreases. We suggest that circumstances indicative of sperm\ncompetition--specifically, a man's partner's extra-pair copula-\ntion--motivate men to enter their sperm into competition as\nquickly as possible, resulting in relatively shorter IPC duration.\nWomen's reports do not replicate this relationship, although\nwomen's reports of their partner's use of sexually coercive\nDefection Threat acts approached statistical significance.\nMen may face a trade-off in copulatory strategies following\nfemale infidelity: Quickly enter sperm into competition or per-\nform semen-displacement behaviors to extract rival sperm\nfrom the vagina. Consequently, IPC duration may be relatively\nshorter or longer, respectively, depending on the copulatory\nstrategy a man pursues. Men's copulatory strategy might be\ndetermined by whether they are attempting to prevent or cor-\nrect female infidelity (Shackelford, 2003). We operationalized\nsperm competition risk in Study 1 as men's perception of\nfemale infidelity. The results indicate that men engage in\nshorter IPC when they perceive greater risk or likelihood of\nfemale infidelity, which we suggest is a corrective sperm com-\npetition strategy. Goetz and colleagues (2005) suggested that\nmen might pursue longer duration of IPC as a corrective strat-\negy in response to sperm competition risk--operationalized in\ntheir research as female partner attractiveness. However, a\npartner's attractiveness can also motivate men to prevent infi-\ndelity because her attractiveness portends that she is more\nlikely to have extra-pair suitors. Thus, the relationship between\nfemale attractiveness and longer IPC duration might also be\nindicative of men's attempts to prevent partner infidelity (see\nThe IPC duration and, consequently, the copulatory strategy\nmen deploy, might be affected by a variable not measured in\nthe current research or in Goetz et al.'s (2005) research: the\ntime since a woman's suspected or known extra-pair copula-\ntion. The time since a women's extra-pair copulation might\naffect men's copulatory strategy at the next IPC. For example,\nlonger copulation duration--which includes more semen-\ndisplacing behaviors--might be a more effective sperm com-\npetition strategy in circumstances in which the time between a\nwoman's copulation with an extra-pair partner and an in-pair\nTable 3.

Under these circumstances, a rival man's sperm\nand spermicidal substances have not yet been ejected from the\nand reduced ejaculatory latency may adversely affect semen\ndisplacement (Gallup & Burch, 2004). Shorter copulation dura-\ntion--quickly entering sperm into competition--might be\nmore likely in circumstances in which the time between a\nwoman's extra-pair copulation and IPC is longer (e.g., more\nthan 1 hour; Baker & Bellis, 1993b), and it is unlikely that rival\nsperm are still present in the vagina. After sperm are ejected\nfrom the vagina, adjusting IPC duration to be shorter--ejacu-\nlating quickly--may be a more successful sperm competition\nstrategy (but see, Gallup & Burch, 2004). This hypothesis is\ncontingent on two factors: (1) the duration of how long sperm\nremain in the vagina (i.e., the ``corrective window''; Baker &\n1984), and (2) a woman's behavior after sexual intercourse\nunderstanding of men's strategies to correct or prevent female\ninfidelity (Shackelford, 2003), such as extending IPC duration\nto facilitate semen displacement, would be informed by asses-\nsing the time between a woman's perceived or actual extra-pair\ncopulation and the next IPC.\nMen's reports indicate a relationship between sexually coer-\ncive Commitment Manipulation and shorter IPC, supporting\nHypothesis 2. This suggests that the duration of coercive sex\nis shorter than consensual sex, consistent with the results of\nresearch on nonhumans (e.g., waterfowl; McKinney et al.,\n1983). The current research is the first to investigate copulatory\nbehavior--in particular, copulation duration--associated with\nreports of sexual coercion in humans. Men who employ sexual\ncoercion to secure IPCs may be pursuing a copulatory strategy\nthat affords quick entry into sperm competition, rather than a\nstrategy to displace rival sperm that may be present.\nThe nonsignificant relationship between women's reports of\ntheir infidelity and shorter IPC duration may be a result of a\nperceptual bias unique to the context of sexually coercive copu-\nlations. Because sexual coercion is often psychologically trau-\nmatizing for women (Campbell, 1989; Thornhill & Thornhill,\nfrequency of sexual coercion may differ from men's reports.\nRecent research (B\u00b4\nelanger, Mathieu, Dugal, & Courchesne,\n2015) conducted with romantic couples indicates that, com-\npared to their male partner, women significantly underreport\ninstances of sexually coercive behavior (measured by the\nConflict Tactics Scale; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &\nSugarman, 1996). Discrepancies between male and female\nreports may account for the sex differences observed in the\ncurrent research. Nevertheless, men's reports suggest that\nfuture research might profitably investigate sexually coercive\ncopulatory behaviors and strategies. Future research could\nsecure data from both romantic partners to obtain more accu-\nrate corroborating reports of sexual behavior in intimate\nrelationships.\nThe results of the current research are not conclusive regard-\ning the relationships between sperm competition risk, sexual\ncoercion, and copulation duration. Men's reports (Study 1)\nprovide support for the study hypotheses, but women's reports\n(Study 2) do not corroborate these findings. The current\nresearch offers an initial investigation into adjustments of\ncopulatory duration in humans--a domain that has not yet been\nexplored. Future research that addresses the limitations of the\ncurrent studies (see below) could continue to profitably inves-\ntigate copulation duration in humans.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThe current research secured data from independent samples of\nmen and women. Although securing men's reports and\nwomen's reports of the same behaviors might afford triangu-\nlating on reliable assessments of the relevant phenomena, the\ncurrent data are limited in that we secured data from men and\nwomen who were not partnered to one another. Future research\nmight secure daily reports from both members of couples to\nafford more reliable assessments of sexual coercion and related\ncopulatory behaviors in intimate relationships.\nAnother limitation is that we assessed the duration of the\nmost recent IPC. In contrast, we assessed the frequency with\nwhich men performed sexually coercive acts during the previ-\nous one month. Because of the difference in assessment time\nframe for the two variables, we cannot be certain that sexual\ncoercion was used to secure the copulation about which parti-\ncipants reported. Future research addressing sexual coercion in\nintimate relationships and copulatory behaviors could secure\nreports about sexually coercive acts used to achieve a specific\nIPC. Additionally, research could investigate the average time\nof IPCs or average time in the previous one month (e.g., in\nminutes) to afford congruence between measures of sexual\ncoercion and copulatory duration. This would afford stronger\nclaims about whether and how the use of sexual coercion is\nrelated to copulation duration in response to female infidelity.\nMoreover, we secured a relative measure of copulatory\nduration (how long copulation lasted compared to ``what is\nnormal for you''), rather than an absolute measure of copula-\ntion duration (how long copulation lasted, in minutes).\nAlthough our measure of copulation duration afforded control\nof individual differences in copulation duration, we suggest\nthat future research investigates absolute length of copulation\nduration. Because the upper limits of copulation duration in\nan increased motivation to sexually please one's partner, the\nabsolute duration of copulation could provide useful informa-\ntion regarding whether--under circumstances of increased\nsperm competition risk--men are less inclined to sexually\nplease their partner for the benefit of entering their sperm into\ncompetition more quickly.\nFinally, the results of the current research are correlational,\nand thus strong statements of causality are not defensible.\nBased on the available literature, however, we argue that men's\ncopulatory behaviors and use of sexual coercion are motivated\nby increased sperm competition risk--in particular, by per-\nceived or actual female infidelity. It is possible, however, that\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nmen's sexual coercion motivates women to pursue extra-pair\ncopulations or eventually to terminate the relationship.\nConclusion\nFemale infidelity is a primary context in which sperm compe-\ntition might have occurred over human evolutionary history\nand may have occasionally resulted in cuckoldry. Because\ncuckoldry can inflict substantial costs on paternally investing\nmales, men may have evolved strategies to solve this class of\nadaptive problems. We tested the hypotheses that female infi-\ndelity and men's use of sexual coercion are associated with\nshorter IPC duration. Men's reports indicate that perceptions\nof their partner's infidelity are correlated with shorter IPC\nduration, which we argue reflects a copulatory strategy to\nquickly enter sperm into competition. Men's reports also indi-\ncate that sexually coercive men reduce IPC duration. These\nfindings contribute to our understanding of men's use of sexual\ncoercion in intimate relationships and, more generally, to our\nunderstanding of human male adaptations to sperm\ncompetition.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nBailey, R.
