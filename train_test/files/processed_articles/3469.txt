These were then cultured with autologous healthy CD4\u00fe T-cells. Immunoglobulin-like\ntranscript 4 (ILT4) and CD86 were evaluated on stimulated monocytes and CD4\u00fe T-cells via\nfluorescence activated cell sorting.\nResults: Monocytes incubated with synovial fluid from patients with RA (SF-RA; n \u00bc 12) had\nsignificantly lower ILT4 and higher CD86 levels than those incubated with synovial fluid from\npatients with OA (SF-OA; n \u00bc 12) or medium alone. In patients with RA, there was a significant\nnegative correlation between ILT4 and disease activity score (DAS; r \u00bc \u00c00.699), and a positive\ncorrelation between CD86 and DAS (r \u00bc 0.626). T-cells costimulated with monocytes cultured\nwith SF-RA produced significantly more interferon-g and tumour necrosis factor-a than those\ncostimulated with monocytes cultured with SF-OA or controls.\nConclusions: Soluble mediators in SF-RA could contribute to modulating inflammation and local\neffectiveness of the immune response.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Rheumatology, Allergology and Clinical Immunology,\nDepartment of Systemic Medicine, University of Rome\n``Tor Vergata'', Rome, Italy\n2Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Molecular Imaging,\nInterventional Radiology and Radiation Therapy, University\nof Rome ``Tor Vergata'', Rome, Italy\nCorresponding author:\nMaria Sole Chimenti, Rheumatology, Allergology and\nClinical Immunology, Department of Systemic Medicine,\nUniversity of Rome ``Tor Vergata'', viale Oxford 81, Rome\nEmail: maria.sole.chimenti@uniroma2.it\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\n",

Hallmarks of local path-\nology are infiltration of neutrophils,\nlymphocytes and macrophages, as well as\nthe expansion of resident fibroblasts in the\nsynovium. The majority of immune cells\nwithin synovial tissues are macrophages;\nthese are recruited profusely in RA and\ncontribute to joint destruction.1,2 Several\nproteins involved in inflammatory pathways\nand the immune response have been identi-\nfied in the synovial fluid of patients with RA\nThe aim of the present study was to\ninvestigate the ability of SF-RA to modulate\ncell-surface phenotype, function and viabil-\nity of monocytes in RA. We evaluated the\npresence of immunoglobulin-like transcript\n4 (ILT4; a receptor crucial to monocyte\ntolerogenic function) and CD86 (a regulator\nof T-cell activation).\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited patients aged !18 years\nwith active knee RA, and age- and sex-\nmatched patients with knee osteoarthritis\n(OA), attending the Rheumatology Unit of\nthe University of Rome ``Tor Vergata'',\npatients with RA were local intra-articular\ncorticosteroid injection within 5 weeks\nbefore synovial fluid: aspiration and treat-\nment with biological agents. Clinical data\nwere collected retrospectively from patient\ncharts and included disease duration,\nC-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid\nfactor (RF) and anticyclic citrullinated\npeptide antibody (ACPA) levels, disease\nactivity score (DAS) 44,4 and treatment.\nThe study was carried out in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki and\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation\nGood Clinical Practice Guidelines. The ethics\ncommittee of the University of Rome ``Tor\nVergata'' approved the study, and all patients\nprovided written informed consent prior to\nenrolment.\nSynovial fluid collection\nSynovial fluid was collected via joint aspir-\nation in association with therapeutic arthro-\ncentesis. Approximately 2\u00ad4 ml of synovial\nfluid was collected in sodium heparin-coated\nVacutainerTM tubes (Becton, Dickinson and\nCo., East Rutherford, NJ, USA); samples\ncontaminated with blood were discarded.\nImmediately after collection, samples were\nthe resulting supernatants were aliquotted\nMonocyte culture\nWhole venous blood samples from the\nantecubital vein were collected from healthy\nvolunteers using standard methods; periph-\neral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were\nisolated using Histopaque\u00d51077 (Sigma, St.\nLouis, MO, USA) according to the manu-\nfacturer's instructions. PBMCs were washed\ntwice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH\n4C to remove platelets. Cells were\n16 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1S)\nThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA) containing 10% heat-inactivated\nfetal calf serum (FCS), and further enriched\nfor monocytes via elutriation, as described\npreviously.5\nElutriated monocytes were plated at\nbottom plates (Corning Incorporated,\nmedium supplemented with 20% FCS,\n2 mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin,\n50 mg/ml streptomycin (complete medium)\nand cultured at 37C in a humidified atmos-\nphere of 5% carbon dioxide in air for 72 h, in\nthe presence or absence of 20 ml synovial\nfluid (from each study subject) and/or\n10 mg/ml adalimumab (Humira\u00d5, AbbVie,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nFACS\nMonocytes were washed once with washing\nbuffer (3% (v/v) FCS and 0.1% (w/v)\nsodium azide in PBS (pH 7.4), then incu-\nbated with R-phycoerythrin-cyanine (PC5)-\nconjugated anti-CD14 (Immunotech,\nMarseille, France), phycoerythrin-conju-\ngated anti-ILT4 (Immunotech), or fluores-\ncein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated\nanti-CD86 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,\n4C in the dark. The negative range and\nstaining specificity for each cell-surface\nmarker was established using a correspond-\ning isotype-matched control antibody,\nconjugated with the same fluorescent dye.\nFlow cytometry was performed using a\nFACScanTM flow cytometer and analysed\nwith CellQuestTM software (both from\nBeckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,\nUSA). For each analysis, 104 events were\ngated on CD14 expression and a light-\nscatter gate, designed to either include only\nviable cells (surface markers determination)\nor exclude cellular debris (determination of\nintracellular cytokine production).\nThe ability of synovial fluid to modulate\nthe costimulatory effect of monocytes was\nevaluated as follows. PBMC from a single\ndonor were used to generate (i) purified\nmonocytes via elutriation, and (ii) purified\nCD4\u00fe T cells using a T cell-negative isola-\ntion kit (Dynal\u00d5; ThermoFisher Scientific).\nMonocytes were used just after elutriation\nand CD4\u00fe T cells were frozen just after\npurification. Monocytes were incubated for\n72 h in the presence or absence of synovial\nfluid from each participant, harvested,\nbottom 96-well plate coated with anti-CD3\nantibody (10 mg/ml; Beckton Dickinson),\nthen mixed 1 : 1 with thawed autologous\nCD4\u00fe T cells in the presence of 1 mg/ml\nbrefeldin A (Sigma) and incubated for 18 h\nat 37C in the dark. At the end of the\nincubation period, cells were washed with\nwashing buffer (formulated as a neutral\nPC5-conjugated anti-CD3 (Immunotech)\nfor 30 min at 4C in the dark. Cells were\npermeabilized in BD Cytofix/CytopermTM\n(Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA), stained\nwith 1 : 10 FITC-conjugated anti-interferon\n(IFN)-g (R&D Systems, San Diego, CA,\nUSA) for 30 min at room temperature. The\nnegative range and staining specificity for\neach cell-surface marker and cytokine was\nestablished using a corresponding isotype-\nmatched control antibody, conjugated with\nthe same fluorescent dye.\nCell viability and apoptosis\nElutriated monocytes were cultured in the\npresence or absence of synovial fluid or\nserum from each patient with RA. At the\nend of the incubation period, cells were\nwashed twice in PBS (pH 7.4), detached by\ngentle scraping, and collected by low-speed\ncentrifuged cell pellet was gently resus-\npended in 1.5 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome\nsolution containing propidium iodide, as\ndescribed previously.6 Propidium iodide\nfluorescence of individual nuclei was mea-\nsured by FACS as described previously.7\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD, median\n(interquartile range) or n (%). Normality of\ndistribution was assessed using\nKolmogorov\u00adSmirnov goodness-of-fit test.\nBetween-variable comparisons were made\nusing Student's t-test or Mann\u00adWhitney\nU-test. Correlations were evaluated via\nPearson's parametric test for univariate\nanalysis. P-values < 0.05 were considered\nstatistically significant. All statistical ana-\nlyses were performed using SPSS\u00d5 version\n10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5.\nResults\nThe study included 12 patients with RA\n(four male/eight female; mean age\nand 12 patients with OA (five male/seven\nrange 48\u00ad77 years). Demographic and clin-\nical data from the two patient groups are\nshown in Table 1. There were no statistically\nsignificant between-group differences in age,\nsex or disease duration.

As shown in\nFigure 1f, SF-RA significantly reduced the\npercentage of hypodiploid DNA compared\nwith SF-OA or FCS. The addition of\nadalimumab significantly increased the\namount of hypodiploid DNA formation\ncompared with monocytes incubated with\nDiscussion\nWe have demonstrated that monocytes\nincubated with SF-RA acquire a nontolero-\ngenic/activated surface phenotype, charac-\nterized by reduced levels of ILT4 and\nincreased levels of CD86.8 These changes\nin monocyte surface phenotype induced by\nSF-RA were associated with an increased\nability to costimulate autologous CD4\u00fe T\ncells, and increased proinflammatory cyto-\nkine production. Finally, we provided evi-\ndence that SF-RA reduces the rate of\nspontaneous apoptosis of monocytes that\nis reversed by the addition of adalimumab.\nILT4 has been shown to exert a negative\ninfluence on the stimulatory capacity of\nantigen presenting cells,9 exerting either a\ndirect influence on innate effectors or an\nindirect effect on the adaptive response and\npossibly playing a pathogenic role in RA.10\nIndeed, changes in the relative balance of\nactivating and inhibitory ILTs in the syno-\nvium could lead to inappropriate activity of\ninnate immune agents that may then drive\nT-cell activation.11 Our findings suggest that\nsoluble mediators in SF-RA could be con-\ntributing factors in modulating the local\neffectiveness of the immune response and\ninflammation.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nEditorial assistance was provided by Gayle\nRobins on behalf of HPS\u00adHealth Publishing\nand Services Srl and funded by Pfizer Italia.\nReferences\n1.
