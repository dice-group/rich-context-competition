Delegation of participation\nin the withdrawal of private land plots for public\u00adprivate needs by the authorities and reassignment to certain commercial\nlegal entities partially owned by the state often leads to social tensions because the society perceives many such cases of\nwithdrawal of land plots from civil owners as injustice. At the same time, considering the U.S. experience, the authors state\nthe interstate nature of this problem. This situation requires not only the development of legislation or changes in judicial\npractice but also a change in the conceptual approach regarding the withdrawal of land plots for public and public\u00adprivate\nneeds, and an enhancement of the axiological (value-conscious) approach, which should be considered by all branches of\ngovernment.\n",

This procedure is a kind of fee\nfor progress; the emergence of railroads, water supply mains,\nsewerage systems, and other facilities ensuring the comfort\nand well-being of citizens have led to \"the reverse side of the\ncoin.\" Everything has its price, including the price of termi-\nnating ownership rights.\nThe very problem of the withdrawal of land plots for pub-\nlic (state and municipal) needs is multifaceted and may be\nconsidered from philosophic, economic, sociological, and\nother perspectives. Considering the many great works of cul-\nture and art (e.g., \"Roadwork\" by American writer Stephen\nKing, 1981; \"Leviathan\" by Russian film director Andrey\nZvyagintsev, 2014; and other works), it is possible to con-\nduct research on the creative and artistic approaches of\nauthors to this problem.\nFurthermore, the procedure of involuntary termination of\nownership rights is governed by legal rules that allow con-\nsideration of both the interests of the affected party (the\nowner of the plot) and the interests of the state and society.\nThe search for civilized means to solve this issue has been\nconducted for many centuries. It is believed that the search\nbegan in biblical times, when King Ahab in Samaria offered\nNaboth compensation for the latter's vineyard (\"Eminent\nDomain,\" 2008). However, in its modern version, the con-\ncept of the balance of private and public interests developed\nafter the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man\n(1789) in France, which declared that ownership \"is an invi-\nolable and sacred right\" and \"no one may be deprived thereof\nexcept in cases of an explicit social need established by law\nand subject to fair and advanced compensation.\" In the\nUnited States, a similar procedure appeared after the adop-\ntion of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (1791),\n1Volgograd Institute of Business, Russian Federation\n2Volgograd State University, Russian Federation\nCorresponding Author:\nAleksey Pavlovich Anisimov, Professor of the Chair of Civil Law,\nVolgograd Institute of Business, Russian Federation.

The 20th century history\nshows that states that attempted to focus on the protection of\npublic interests rather than on private interests ceased to\nexist. It is necessary to extract lessons from history to avoid\nrepeating it. However, where is the line that separates the\nselfishness of an individual citizen from social interests? In\naddition, what are the criteria for allowing, in one case, a\nsacrifice of one's interests in favor of everyone's interests\nand, in another case, to forbid doing it?\nScientists from Russia (O. L. Altengova, A. I. Dikhtyar,\nA. A. Zaviyalov, V. P. Kamyshansky, O. I. Krassov) and the-\norists from other countries (W. Baude, Robert L. Mills, C.\nWalsh, J. Hathaway) have both been seeking an answer to\nthis question.\nIn this work, the authors suggest an axiological (value-\nconscious) approach to the issue of withdrawal of land\nplots for public needs, which focuses not only on the tech-\nnical calculation of compensation or procedural actions of\nstate officials (with all the absolute importance of the lat-\nter) but also on the value-related aspects, rights, and legiti-\nmate interests of ordinary citizens. The approach also\nfocuses on the means to reduce the pressure of the state on\ncitizens' lives and property, the search for a means to\nincrease the guarantees of their rights to land plots and real\nestate, and the development of new approaches to the cal-\nculation of compensation mechanism for their withdrawn\nimmovable property.\nPrivate and Public Interests and Needs:\nAvailable and Suggested Criteria for\nDistinguishing One From the Other\nCorrelation of Private and Public Interests\nRegarding the Issues of Termination of Rights to\nOwnership to Land Plots\nThe issue of the differentiation of public and private inter-\nests extends outside the framework of legal research alone\nand is closely connected with the essential philosophical,\nethical, social, and legal issue of the interrelation of the\nindividual and the state; this is basically insoluble beyond\nthe axiological method and beyond the research on the\nsystem of values and hierarchical relations of social and\nindividual values (Aksenova, 2007). Identification of the\nmost clear boundaries of private and public interests can\nresolve the essential issue; this will affect all aspects of\nhuman relationships, including the correlation of freedom\nand nonfreedom, initiative, the autonomy of will and stat-\nutory regulations, and the limits of state intervention\nOne of the most successful definitions of \"interest\" was\nsuggested by R. Ihering, who believed that interest is the\nmaterial basis of law, and its main purpose is the adjustment\nof interests in society and finding balance between them\n(Ihering, 1991). Indeed, interest has a conceptual and defin-\ning role because a right that is not connected to or reflective\nof vital interests is not of real value for people. Interests not\nprotected by rights are legally defenseless (Pershin, 2004).\nIt is beyond any doubt that the line between private and\npublic interests is conditional. The 19th century classics of\ncivil law noted that\nin fact, the area of individual private interest is not sharply\nseparated from social public one; however, if ever such a\nseparation could occur, it would not bear that fruit which is\nexpected; conversely, it would make privacy and private legal\nrelations intolerable and impossible. (Kavelin, 2003)\nWe should agree with this approach of the impossibility of a\nsharp demarcation between private and public interests\nbecause any public interest in land is the aggregate of the\nprivate interests (interests of citizens and their associations)\nof those residing in a certain area. Furthermore, various citi-\nzen associations may have different public (the aggregate of\nprivate) interests that develop on a territorial (street, district\nin a city) or subject basis (construction of schools, stadiums,\nand shopping malls).\nThis approach makes it possible to distinguish public\ninterest, the implementation of which is objectively impor-\ntant for all people residing in this area (e.g., construction of a\nhospital complex and highway); in addition, public interests\n(interest of certain social groups) and the interests of these\ngroups may contradict each other, private interests (interests\nof individual citizens) or state (municipal) interests. For\nexample, one group of citizens may prefer to construct a\ncasino in an urban quarter, whereas the other group may pre-\nfer to construct a mosque, and a third may prefer a shopping\nmall with a parking lot. Then, a question arises regarding\nwhether termination of land rights of certain persons with the\nobjective to transfer it to others is just.\nA typical example of a conflict of private and public inter-\nests was the reconstruction of the central part of Krasnodar;\nthis decision was adopted in 2006. Consideration of this\nissue made many Russian scientists ask, \"What are the\nmunicipal needs and interests in this case?\" The scientists\nnoted that\nAnisimov and Ryzhenkov 3\none should have a great imagination to suggest that on February\nneeds . . . to withdraw the land plots and to demolish 58 thousand\nsingle-storey houses located in the total area of approximately\ntwo thousand hectares in the central part of Krasnodar.\nAt the same time, the land plots were to be purchased by\nthe municipal entities not by private investors defined as a\nresult of being selected to participate in the reconstruction of\nthe central part of Krasnodar (Kamyshansky, 2006). A similar\nconflict occurred in 2006 on the outskirts of Moscow in\nYuzhnoye Butovo district, where Moscow authorities decided\nto withdraw 54 ha of land, to demolish single-story houses\nand to use that area to construct elite apartment buildings. A\nportion of the residents agreed to voluntary removal; the other\nresidents organized a number of civil disobedience acts.\nCitizens losing their property in favor of the enrichment\nof private individuals will always be considered an injustice.\nIn Butovo, injustice was the reason for a protest by owners of\nindividual houses subject to demolition against the city\nadministration's decision to transfer their land plots to a mul-\ntistory commercial construction project. The plot owners\nassessed the situation as a dispute between two private own-\ners (the buyer and the seller) primarily regarding the value of\nthe immovable property for which the buyer used adminis-\ntrative pressure to conserve funds (Volovich, 2008).\nRegarding the attribution of reconstruction of Krasnodar\ncenter to municipal needs, we should note that, at the moment\nof reconstruction, this was not the case. According to the cur-\nrent legislation (Art. 56.3 Land Code), public needs include\nthe demolition of blocks of flats, followed by construction of\nmodern residential buildings in the same location; however,\nthe mass demolition of individual residential buildings is no\nlonger stipulated by the current legislation. Construction of\nnew residential buildings instead of dilapidated and hazardous\nblocks of flats is a typical case of public\u00adprivate interests.\nThe private or public nature of the Sochi 2014 Olympic\nGames is equally ambiguous. Of 4,212 ha of land, which was\nbelonged to the state, and the remaining 679 ha belonged to\nplotsand259flatslocatedinthisarea(\"StatisticsonWithdrawal\nand Provision,\" 2014). It is not surprising that in Sochi in May\nwithdrawal of land and demolition of their homes to construct\nOlympic venues. As a result of the clashes with the police,\npeople who defended their properties were hurt. The governor\nof Krasnodar Territory said that the actions were necessary \"to\nabruptly stop all illegal actions of these pseudoprotesters who\nare trying to put their personal benefit above the public one\nSuch a citizen response can be understood through the\ntraditional understanding of law by the Russian popula-\ntion; this is not as officially prescribed \"totality of manda-\ntory rules of law,\" but rather as law as social order based\non social agreement and compromise as a means to imple-\nment freedom, justice, and equality (Livshits, 2001).\nThis raises the question of whether Olympics are public\nneeds and how to incorporate citizens' opinions, which no\none had inquired of before deciding on issues that directly\naffected them. It appears that this situation is another typical\nexample of \"public-private\" needs; for these, the compulsory\ntermination of private land ownership rights should be con-\nducted solely in compliance with procedures that consider\nresidents' opinions by means of public hearings.\nThe situation in which the termination of citizens'rights to\nland is necessary to implement a \"foreign\" state or municipal\ninterest appears to be more complicated. For example, it is\noccasionally necessary for an urban district (municipal entity)\nto build an aeration station for processing sewage. The sta-\ntion's construction within city boundaries is prohibited by\nsanitary rules. Therefore, such construction occurs in the\ncountryside surrounding the city and can lead to the with-\ndrawal of land plots from individuals for municipal needs.\nThere is no doubt that the residents of this rural area are against\nsuch construction. Therefore, in this case, a conflict of munici-\npal but not private interests is observed. There are no clear\nlegal means to resolve such conflicts between the interests of\nresidents of different municipalities in Russia, although it is\nobvious that the dispute's settlement should involve participa-\ntion of a state-authorized constituent entity of the Russian\nFederation. Special focus regarding this problem should be on\nthe lack of clearly defined procedures for the withdrawal of\nland plots belonging to one public (municipal) owner in favor\nof another (e.g., for construction of the said aeration station).\nThus, one should distinguish private (individual and\nsocial groups) and public interests (state and municipal). In\nour view, private interests can be met by establishing a pri-\nvate easement but not through withdrawal of a land plot.\nPublic (state and municipal) interests can be realized both by\nestablishing a public easement and through withdrawal of\nland plots for public needs. Public\u00adprivate interests, which,\nin Russia, involve certain commercial legal entities partially\nowned by the state, have an intermediate position. These\nlegal entities perform a certain public function. Therefore,\nsome of them are entitled to participate in procedures for\nwithdrawal of land plots by redemption for public needs.\nConsequently, these entities acquire a right to ownership of\nthe withdrawn land plots and the facilities constructed there.\nLack of clear regulation of this procedure often leads to\nabuses, violates public notions of freedom and justice, and\noften appears immoral in the eyes of the population.\nConcept of Public Needs Existence of Which is\na Ground for Withdrawal of a Land Plot From a\nPrivate Owner\nIn the scientific doctrine, legislation, and juridical practice, the\nquestion regarding appropriate interpretation of the legal\n4 SAGE Open\ncategory of state and municipal needs remains unresolved.\nLand legislation does not contain such a definition. The \"state\nneeds\" referred to in the legislation on the bidding procedure\nfor goods and services'procurement for state needs have exces-\nsively specific land relations, and therefore cannot be applied.\nAt the same time, Article 49 Land Code includes a list of\ncases that delineate when land plots may be withdrawn from\nprivate owners for state or municipal needs. This list includes\nthe following: the implementation of international treaties of\nthe Russian Federation; construction or reconstruction of\nstate (or local) facilities (subject to the lack of other possible\nmodes of construction and reconstruction of these objects),\nsuch as federal power system and regional power system\nfacilities; nuclear power facilities; defense and state security\nfacilities; and federal transport and communication facilities.\nThe list of objects is not exhaustive because \"other grounds\"\nare also noted in that article.\nPublic needs are usually understood as the needs of the\nRussian Federation, its constituent entities and municipalities.\nThese needs are based on the property of citizens and legal\nentities that express a common interest, and are related to the\nprotection of the fundamentals of constitutional order, morality,\nhealth, rights, legitimate interests of other persons, defense and\nsecurity. The satisfaction of these needs, which are generally\nlisted in the federal law, is impossible except by means of an\ninvoluntary termination of the right of private ownership while\nbalancing private and public interests (Altengova, 2012).\nIt appears that this understanding is excessively narrow\nbecause the list of state and municipal needs is much wider,\nwhich follows from Article 49 LC RF (particularly given that\nthis list can be extended by federal laws). However, the\nunderstanding of \"exclusiveness\" of public needs enshrined\nin the law and confirmed in juridical practice makes it impos-\nsible to redistribute land plots for the purpose of a simple\nincrease in the tax collection from a certain area.\nThis is the position that Russian courts usually hold. Thus,\nin one case, the arbitration court invalidated the resolution of\nthe local government on the withdrawal of land for municipal\nneeds because no documents proving the exceptional need to\nplace facilities exactly on the disputed plot of land were sub-\nmitted. From the case materials, it is clear that the goal was a\nwithdrawal of the agricultural land plot from a closed joint-\nstock company to place facilities for development of the raw\nmineral material base of local industrial enterprises and to\nimplement the \"Ceramics Factory\" and \"ISUZU and FIAT\nTruck Centre\" investment projects. As was noted in the court\ndecision, the Land Code of Russia does not stipulate with-\ndrawal of land plots for state or municipal needs with the\nobjective to attract investors to raise money for the municipal\nbudget and to create new jobs. Therefore, in this case, the\nlocal authorities had no legitimate grounds for withdrawal of\nthe land plot (Resolution of the Federal Arbitration Court of\nIn consideration of the repeated attempts to withdraw land\nplots from private individuals to transfer to other private\nindividuals, it is necessary to prove the legality of this behav-\nior. Many Russian scientists believe that the lack of a clear\ndefinition of state and municipal needs in the legislation\nmakes it possible to interpret the definitions to the prejudice\nof private owners. The definitions may often include not only\nstate needs but also the private economic interests of public\nauthorities as ordinary owners. Therefore, it is necessary to\nestablish more precise criteria regarding the concept of com-\nmonwealth interests (Tuzhilova-Ordanskaya, 2007).\nOther authors suggest using the term public needs because\nthe concept \"state and municipal needs\" does not always\ncoincide with the actual needs of society. These authors\nbelieve that the construction of roads, mining, and similar\nactivities are often conducted not by the state but by com-\nmercial organizations; therefore, these cases are unlikely to\nbe legitimately referred to as \"state needs\" (Syrodoev, 2004).\nIndeed, the proposed term is now widespread in the legis-\nlation of many countries. In Spain, withdrawal of a land plot\nis possible solely if it is required due to \"social expediency or\nsocial interests\"; in Sweden, it is \"important public inter-\nests.\" In Italy, \"common interests\" are required; in Portugal,\n\"public interests\" are necessary. In Germany, the purposes of\n\"commonwealth\" are referenced, and in the United States,\nthe term used is \"socially useful purposes\" (Dikhtyar &\nIn general, we should agree with this proposal. With regard\nto Russian conditions, it should be noted that, in addition to\nprivate and public needs, there is an objective possibility,\nindirectly noted in the Russian legislation (but not named\ndirectly), of withdrawal of land plots based on the initiative of\na number of legal entities to construct facilities that perform\npublic functions that we propose to call \"public-private facili-\nties.\" These facilities include sports stadiums, hotels, and elite\nresidential complexes. The possibility of withdrawal of land\nplots for such construction is currently limited.\nLack of understanding of a clear distinction between pub-\nlic and private needs leads to the common position of the\ncomplete impossibility of withdrawal of land plots for public\nneeds when there is a subsequent transfer to ownership\n(lease) by private individuals who fulfill certain public\n(social) objectives regarding their activities.\nFor example, in one court decision, it was stated that with-\ndrawal of land plots, with reference to state and municipal\nneeds, to provide these to other persons for construction is\nnot allowed according toArticle 49 Land Code of the Russian\nFederation (Resolution of the Federal Arbitration Court of\nthat a land plot may not be withdrawn for private needs;\ntherefore, private land property may be withdrawn for use\nonly by state or municipal entities. Private property may be\ntransformed solely into state or municipal property.\nAccordingly, only state or municipal institutions may use it\nIn contrast, other scientists believe that local authorities\nwho reserve land or facilities for municipal needs are entitled\nAnisimov and Ryzhenkov 5\nto provide for the construction of not only municipal proper-\nties or facilities for its use in accordance with local authority\nfunctions but also certain other facilities for private needs\n(Zavialov, 2007). Ugo Mattei notes that, currently, the com-\nmonwealth involves not only the interests of the entire state\nbut also its certain agencies and private companies that oper-\nate in society's interest. Consequently, the legislator may\nadmit withdrawal of property from one private owner with\nits subsequent transfer into another person's private property\nfor its use in society's interest (Mattei & Sukhanov, 1999).\nWe share a similar position, considering that, in the mod-\nern world, redistribution of spatially limited land resources is\ninevitable. Therefore, the problem of law is not to trail the\nobjective modernization process of urban area development\nbut to set goals and incentives for the development of this\nprocess while guaranteeing owners' rights.\nHowever, supporting the possibility of involuntary with-\ndrawal of land plots from private individuals with their further\nuse by commercial legal entities in society's interest, we con-\nsider it necessary to comply with the criteria of balancing pri-\nvate and public interests based on the understanding of law as a\ntool for the provision of justice. Thus, a suitable criterion was\nsuggested by the European Court of Human Rights. In the judg-\nment in the \"Gladysheva v. Russia\" case (application no.\nence with property not only must be legal and have a legitimate\nobjective but also satisfy the requirement of proportionality.\nThe Court states that there must be an equitable balance between\nthe needs arising from the common interests of society and the\nneed to protect basic human rights; the tendency to such an\nequitable balance is typical of the whole Convention. The\nrequired balance will not be achieved if the interested person\nbears the individual and excessive burden (Case \"Gladysheva v.\nsearch for clear criteria on \"proportional interference\" with pri-\nvate affairs requires the development of new warranties of the\nrights of the property owners as well.\nThus, what is meant by public (state and municipal)\nneeds, considering the evaluative nature of this category?\nPublic needs are the needs of the population of Russia\n(region, municipality) stipulated by the federal laws, the sat-\nisfaction of which is impossible without withdrawal of land\nplots with just compensation to private individuals for trans-\nfer into ownership by the Russian Federation, its constituent\nentities and municipalities. Their further use must be for\ninfrastructure, defense and security, power industry, spe-\ncially protected natural areas, and international treaties'\nimplementation facilities.\nPublic\u00adprivate needs are the needs of a number of social\ngroups that are stipulated by federal laws and related to subsur-\nface management, construction of facilities for health care, edu-\ncation, sports, residential buildings and other similar facilities.\nThese are fulfilled by commercial legal entities partially owned\nby the state by means of the involuntary withdrawal of land\nplots from private individuals with a guarantee of their rights.\nSubjects and Procedure of Withdrawal\nof Land Plots for Public Needs:\nPros and Cons of the Current Legal\nRegulation\nInitially, after the entry of the Land Code (2001) into force,\nthe level of guarantees of the rights of private land owners in\nRussia was sufficiently high and did not cause any particular\ncomments. Guarantees of the rights of land owners during\nwithdrawal of the land plots for state or municipal needs were\ndefined in the Land Code (Article 55 enshrined the prior and\nfair compensation of the cost of land plots; Article 63 pointed\nto the necessity for a prior notice of owners 1 year before the\nand the Urban Development Code. The latter, in particular, to\nensure a reasonable balance of private and public interests,\nstipulated the necessity to link the withdrawal of land plots\nfor state and municipal needs to the content of territorial plan-\nning documents of the Russian Federation, its constituent\nentities and municipalities (such a necessity is now stipulated\nby Part 4 Article 9 Urban Development Code).\nThe guarantee is based on the fact that state authorities\nand local authorities may not adopt decisions on land reser-\nvation, on withdrawal, including by redemption, of land plots\nfor state or municipal needs, on transfer of land from one\ncategory into another if territorial planning documents are\nnot available, except in cases stipulated by federal laws. This\nrule means that the general layout and other urban planning\ndocumentation should include the planned future state or\nmunicipal facilities, the construction of which requires with-\ndrawal of land plots from private individuals. Accordingly,\nthe population will be able to familiarize themselves with\nthese layouts during public hearings.\nThe statutory system for land withdrawal relation subjects\nwas logical as well; they were represented by bodies of state\nor local authorities as one component, and citizens and legal\nentities as the other component. No exceptions to the general\nrules were available; no legal entities had privileges; how-\never, exceptions to this general procedure gradually began to\nemerge.\nFor the first time, a special legal procedure of with-\ndrawal of land plots for state or municipal needs was intro-\nduced by a special federal law for the construction of the\nOlympic venues in Sochi (Federal Law No. 310-FZ of\nGames . . .\"), then for the construction of the facilities nec-\nessary to organize the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation\nsummit in Vladivostok. Later, the procedure was supple-\nmented by two other federal laws governing the withdrawal\nof land plots for public needs in territories annexed to\nMoscow (as a result of its expansion; Federal Law No.\nCertain Legal Relations Associated . . .\"), and related to the\nareas required for the construction of the 2018 Football\n6 SAGE Open\n\"On Organization in the Russian Federation of the 2018\nFIFA . . .\"). These laws provide conditions for shorter with-\ndrawal of land plots (area planning designs are accepted\nwithout public hearings; withdrawal is allowed if there are\nno approved area planning documentation; in the \"new\nof land plots or other immovable property, the owner shall\nbe notified of the forthcoming withdrawal at least 5 months\nbefore the forthcoming withdrawal).\nAfter the analysis of all four of the abovementioned fed-\neral laws, O. A. Zolotova notes that they indicate unification\nof a special procedure of land withdrawal for state need. The\nlaws include the establishment of reduced terms for the\nadoption of administrative and judicial decisions; simplified\nformation of land plots and issue of corresponding cadastral\ncertificates; extrajudicial withdrawal of land plots from state\nand municipal institutions and unitary enterprises; and a spe-\ncial procedure for compensation of the cost of withdrawn\nAll these exceptions to the rules could be explained by poli-\nticians' desire to hasten the organization of Olympic events\nthat were important for them or the summit in Vladivostok.\nHowever, recent amendments to the Land Code of the Russian\nFederation follow this trend, which leads to a further overall\ndecline in the guarantees of private property rights; this is\ngrounds for discussions regarding the fairness and appropri-\nateness of these procedures. How does this manifest?\nThe latest amendments to the Land Code of the Russian\nFederation (Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 499-\nCode . . .\") introduced a new right of commercial companies\nspecifically referred to in the law to participate in the proce-\ndures of involuntary withdrawal of land plots by redemption\nfor public needs. Three types of such organizations are noted\nin the Land Code of the Russian Federation: subjects of natu-\nral monopolies; legal entities that are licensed to perform\nwork provision of which the means of withdrawal of land\nplots is stipulated by Article 49 Land Code of the Russian\nFederation; mining companies (It.1 Art. 56.4 Land Code).\nWhat is their authority?\n1. They are entitled to apply for withdrawal of land\nplots for state needs at competent state agencies.\n2. They are entitled to apply to the court for involuntary\nwithdrawal of a land plot and the immovable prop-\nerty on it if, within 90 days after the rightholder's\nreceipt of a draft agreement on withdrawal of immov-\nable property, the owner fails to submit the signed\nagreement on withdrawal of immovable property.\n3. If the decision on withdrawal is made based on an\napplication of the Russian Highways State Company,\nthe agreement on withdrawal of immovable property is\nconcluded on behalf of the Russian Federation by the\nsaid State Company, and the signing of the agreement\non the part of the federal executive body is not required.\n4. Compensation for withdrawn land plots and (or)\nimmovable property located on them is performed at\nthe expense of the corresponding budget of the bud-\ngetary system of the Russian Federation and, if the\ndecision on withdrawal is made based on an applica-\ntion for withdrawal filed by the abovementioned\norganizations at the expense of these organizations.\n5. After termination of the right of private ownership of\nthe withdrawn plots and immovable property located\nonthem,theybecomeownedbytheRussianFederation,\na constituent entity of the Russian Federation, munici-\npality, or a company that filed an application for with-\ndrawal on the basis of which the decision on withdrawal\nof the land plot and the immovable property located on\nThe above brief review shows a sharp decline in guaran-\ntees of the rights of private ownership of land and the emer-\ngence of the possibility for commercial legal entities\n(partially owned by the state) to actively participate in the\nwithdrawal of land plots from private owners with the land\nplots' transfer into private ownership by such commercial\norganizations.\nIn our view, there is a need to develop a doctrinal concept\nof balance of private and public interests that meets the crite-\nria of fairness, appropriateness, and reasonableness, and con-\ntains the required mechanism of guarantees of land rights of\nthe citizens and their associations.\n1. Interference with the rights of owners with the objec-\ntive to limit or terminate the rights shall be propor-\ntionate in nature. For this purpose, it is necessary to\ndistinguish public and public\u00adprivate interests:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To set an exhaustive list of grounds for withdrawal of\nland plots for public needs. This list shall include\ndefense and security facilities, infrastructure needs\n(linear facilities: electric and other networks, commu-\nnication facilities, roads, railways, pipelines), space\nfacilities, power industry facilities, implementation of\ninternational treaties, and the creation of specially\nprotected natural areas (reserves and national parks).\nExpansion of this list may be allowed solely by means\nof amendments to the law (Art. 49 Land Code Russian\nFederation).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In turn, the list of public\u00adprivate needs cannot be\nexhaustive; however, it is necessary to clearly define\nthe approximate parameters. The list should include\ndemolition of dilapidated and hazardous housing\n(slums) and construction of modern buildings in their\nplace (under the agreement on development of built-\nup areas, Art. 46.2 Urban Development Code); con-\nstruction of sports facilities; subsurface management;\nand construction of private roads and hospitals. The\nmain criterion for the distinction of public and\nAnisimov and Ryzhenkov 7\npublic\u00adprivate facilities is the extent of their common\nusefulness (for the benefit of all citizens, if they are\nroads or electric networks, for the benefit of a portion\nof the citizens, if they are stadiums); the purpose of\nuse (indirect profit [electric networks] or the absence\nof such a purpose at all [military facilities] for public\nneeds; the direct profit [for public\u00adprivate needs]);\nthe type of ownership into which the plot is trans-\nferred, state or municipal (for public needs); or pri-\nvate property (for public\u00adprivate needs). In other\nwords, the criteria consist of terms of withdrawal of a\nland plot for public needs; the land plot is transferred\ninto state (municipal) ownership and used by legal\nentities on the basis of the right of permanent (per-\npetual) use (e.g., institutions or federal state-owned\nenterprises). For public\u00adprivate purposes, a plot is\ntransferred into ownership of a commercial legal\nentity partially owned by the state (e.g., according to\nNonprofit Organizations,\" property transferred to a\nstate-owned corporation of the Russian Federation\nshall be ownership of the state-owned corporation).\nHowever, this criterion is optional because, in both\ncases, the withdrawn plot may be leased.\nAt the same time, the relational subject for the withdrawal\nof land plots for public\u00adprivate needs may not be any com-\nmercial legal entity but solely a legal entity partially owned\nby the state (typical example of which is Russian Railways\nOpen Joint-Stock Company; the percentage of shares owned\nby the Russian Federation is 100).\n2. The issue of the equitable calculation of the compen-\nsation paid to owners of withdrawn property plays an\nimportant role in the procedure of withdrawal of land\nplots for public and public\u00adprivate needs.\nUnfortunately, currently, with the lack of calculation\nmethods for fair compensation, courts nearly always\nside with the plaintiff (authority) and totally ignore\nexpert calculations on behalf of the defendant (citi-\nzen). Analysis of extensive judicial practice shows\nthat, in \"political\" cases associated with the mass\nwithdrawal of land plots from citizens and their asso-\nciations (e.g., in connection with the Olympic Games\nin Sochi in 2014), the judicial authorities do not con-\nsider the arguments of citizens that the estimated\nvalue of their property is understated. Thus, in one\nsuch case, the court referred to Item 26 Article 15\nFederal Law \"On Organization of the XXII Olympic\nWinter Games and the XI Paralympic Winter Games\nin 2014 in Sochi, Development of Sochi as a\nMountain Resort and Inclusion in Certain Legislative\nActs of the Russian Federation\" of December 1,\n2007, and stated that the redemption price of the land\nplots and (or) other immovable property located on\nthem, as well as the amount of losses to be recovered\nin connection with the withdrawal may not exceed\nthe amounts specified in the evaluation report\n\"On Refusal to Submit the Case to the Presidium of\nthe Supreme Arbitration Court . . . \"), which was\ndrafted by a state unitary enterprise. Cases of ignor-\ning all losses of citizens in connection with the land\nplot withdrawal during the compensation calculation\nare as common.\nRegarding the method of losses' calculation, it should be\nnoted that the value of a land plot and its buildings for a citi-\nzen is determined not by its market value but by the possibil-\nity to maintain the usual habitat. According to our view, this\nconcept includes proximity to the native places and graves of\nrelatives, maintenance of the circle of communication, the\nexisting modes of life and much more. At the same time, the\nolder the owners of the property are, the more important the\nlisted factors are for them. These factors are often noted in\napplications filed with the executive authorities and the\ncourts by citizens who have been evicted from their homes\nand land; they provide the authorities' focus on the fact that\nthese are the houses where their ancestors lived and died,\nwhere their children and grandchildren were born. There\nhave been cases of suicides by citizens who did not want to\nmove from their homes into the suggested panel building\nIt can be said without prejudice that the equal value com-\npensation will always be incomplete because, during the\ndetermination of such compensation, the listed circumstances\nare not considered. Therefore, we can draw the obvious con-\nclusion that the compensation paid to a citizen upon with-\ndrawal of a land plot and other immovable property should\nalways be greater than the value of its market value by the\namount necessary to compensate for, conditionally, nonpecu-\nniary damage. The determination of the amount of compensa-\ntion, which does not allow a citizen to acquire any property\nwith similar consumer properties, is extremely unacceptable.\nIn a state focused on the satisfaction of the interests of its citi-\nzens, the social factor should be decisive in the legal regula-\ntion on withdrawal of land plots for state and municipal needs.\nIn consideration of withdrawal, inevitably, the mechanisms\nestablished by the legislation should provide for the possibil-\nity of overcoming the negative effects of withdrawal, at least\nto an extent. In this regard, not only financial but also natural\ncompensation for citizens (at their option) by means of provi-\nsion of a similar land plot in the area where they had previ-\nously lived should be provided. The provision of land plots\nthat are as close as possible to the location of the previous\nland plot will maintain the previous owner's habitat and circle\nof communication, and thus minimize the negative conse-\nquences of the withdrawal procedure (Zaviyalov, 2010).\nA similar rule is already included in Item 2 Article 351\nCivil Code of Ukraine, according to which a person whose\n8 SAGE Open\nownership right is subject to termination shall be entitled to\nrequest provision of another land plot, the value of which is\nconsidered during the determination of the redemption price;\nthis plot shall be located within the area that is subject to the\npowers of the relevant local government body or executive\nauthority (e.g., within the city or another municipal entity).\nThe positive experiences of other countries should be noted\nas well. Thus, the amendments to the Michigan Constitution\n(United States) stipulated that, in case of withdrawal of private\nproperty, the authorities shall prove that the purpose of with-\ndrawal is not a transfer of the property to private individuals\nwith the objective of economic development or increasing tax\nrevenues. At the same time, 125% of the market value of the\nwithdrawn land plots and other immovable property must be\npaid to their owners (Rukhtin, 2007). In fact, the excess of the\nmarket value is the nonpecuniary damage.\nWe propose a calculation of additional compensation for\nsuch owners based on the extent of the nonpecuniary damage\n(from 1% to 50% above the market value) associated with the\nspecific situation of a citizen or a legal entity, whose land plots\nare subject to withdrawal for public or public\u00adprivate needs\n(e.g., in accordance with the period of use of the land plot by\nthe family; the amount must be different if this period is com-\nposed of 1 year or 50 years). A similar scheme should be\napplied to companies that are subject to withdrawal (in accor-\ndance with the number of jobs or the value of products).\nIt appears that the courts must be provided strict instruc-\ntions to consider the estimated value of land plots and\nimmovable property; this can be provided by independent\nappraisers and submitted by the owners of the withdrawn\nland plots and immovable property. These appraisers, in our\nopinion, should be certified and integrated into professional\nself-regulatory organizations. It is reasonable to make greater\nuse of mediation to reduce the tension of conflicts.\nThis issue needs further discussion. In addition, because\nthe state does not provide owners whose land was withdrawn\nwith equivalent compensation, it promotes the destruction of\nthe fundamental rules of cooperation and trust in society.\nPeople begin to believe that the state treats them unfairly,\nremembering the informal rule denoting that the benefits and\ncosts of government actions should be distributed propor-\ntionally among the members of the society. This belief leads\nto a kind of loss that is reflected in the fact that, for example,\npeople no longer invest in their land due to well-founded\nconcern that the latter will be involuntarily purchased with-\nout sufficient compensation. In the long run, this belief inevi-\ntably affects the overall economic well-being of the society\n3. Mandatory availability of territorial planning docu-\nments (general layout), land use and development\nregulations, planning designs in a municipal entity. In\naddition, mandatory availability of regional and local\nstandards of urban design must be a binding condi-\ntion. The essence, for example, of local regulations is\nthat they establish a set of estimate indicators of the\nminimum permissible provision level of the local\npopulation with electricity, heat, gas, water supply\nand sewerage facilities; roads of local significance;\nand physical culture and mass sports, education,\nhealth care, disposal of solid household waste facili-\nties as well as land improvement facilities. In addi-\ntion, the regulations contain estimate indicators of the\nmaximum permissible level of territorial availability\nof such facilities for the municipal entities' popula-\ntion (villages, urban districts).\nThis document should not only be published and posted\non the Internet but also endure public hearing procedures,\nwhich is currently not stipulated by Article 29.4 Urban\nDevelopment Code.\nRegarding facilities of municipal significance that have a\nfuture construction plan, the emergence and discussion with\nthe municipal entity's population will increase the awareness\nof citizens regarding the authorities' plans and mitigate the\npotential social conflicts between the government and soci-\nety. The results of the public hearings must be mandatory.\n4. In terms of withdrawal of land plots for both public\nand public\u00adprivate needs, not only the whole package\nof approved urban planning documentation (as noted\nabove) but also evidence that the facility may not be\nlocated elsewhere, as well as evidence that the exclu-\nsive necessity of the very facility on the withdrawn plot\nis in the interests of the local population, is required.\nThe possibility of available special (simplified) proce-\ndures for withdrawal of land plots for public or public\u00ad\nprivate needs must be completely excluded.\nThis conclusion can also be justified by the fact that, in\ncontrast to densely populated Europe, Russia is a minimally\ndeveloped country; its huge spaces remain uninhabited with-\nout infrastructure facilities. Therefore, if it is necessary to\nhold various summits and Olympics, instead of the demoli-\ntion of homes and eviction of residents, it is much more rea-\nsonable to develop the steppes and wastelands.\n5. It is necessary to govern the procedure of return of a\nwithdrawn plot to its owner if there is no longer a\npublic need for it. This problem occurs constantly,\nnot only in Russian judicial practice but also in the\npractice of European states. For example, the\nConstitutional Court of Austria considered an inter-\nesting case for the return of a land plot withdrawn for\nstate needs. Financial compensation was paid to the\nowner; however, 3 years later, the owner discovered\nthat the withdrawn land plot was not used for public\npurposes. Consequently, his recourse to the general\njurisdiction court was to request a return of the land\nplot (after returning the compensation); the request\nwas denied with reference to the civil legislation. The\ncourt held that the subjective civil right ceased to\nAnisimov and Ryzhenkov 9\nexist due to the withdrawal of the plot; consequently,\nthe plaintiff's claims had no substantive basis. When\nthe owner appealed to the Constitutional Court, he\nwon. This case is connected to \"termination of the\nsubjective constitutional private ownership rights is\nto be associated not with the moment of the actual\nwithdrawal of the land plot but with implementation\nof the purpose for which the land plot was with-\nAs is noted by the European Court of Human Rights, if\nthere is no withdrawal of land for a longtime after the decision\non compulsory expropriation, such withdrawal is a violation\nof Art. 1 Protocol No. 1 to the Convention \"On Protection of\nThis withdrawal disturbs the \"fair balance\" that must exist\nbetween the protection of ownership rights and the require-\nments of common interest (Sporrong and Lnnroth v. Sweden.\nJudgment of the European Court of Human Rights, 1982).\nFulfillment of this requirement often encounters various\nobstacles in Russia. For example, a resident of Tyumen Region\nA (owner of a land plot and immovable property) appealed to\nthe district court via a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the orders\nof the head of the administration of Nizhnetavdinsky district\nMunicipal Needs,\" the owner alleged this order did not include\na list of facilities that were to be located on these land plots,\nand it did not note whether they belonged to facilities of\nmunicipal significance or whether they complied with the gen-\neral layout of the corresponding municipal entity. As a result\nof judicial review, this order was canceled. Similar court deci-\nsions on similar cases are not rare (Krylova, 2013).\nThus, a clear legislative framework provision for binding\nfulfillment of the withdrawal purpose may limit the public\nauthorities' appetite and reduce the frequency of private\nproperty withdrawal cases.\nLegal Structure of \"Eminent Domain\"\nin the U.S. Law: Comparative Legal\nAnalysis of its Attractiveness for Russia\nPursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. constitution, a\ngovernment can acquire real and personal belongings of a\ncitizen for public purpose, and the person must be provided\njust compensation. The Fifth Amendment's public use clause\nis applicable to state governments through the Fourteenth\nAmendment Clause. Therefore, the taking of property for\nprivate purpose is unconstitutional. Legislatures can also del-\negate the power of eminent domain to agencies for public\npurposes. The government's advantage in exercising the\npower of eminent domain need not benefit a large number of\npeople. The use can be solely for a community of people or\nresidents of an area. However, the benefit should not be for\nsolely one person (\"Eminent Domain,\" 2015).\nInitially, Congress did not provide for the right of federal\nauthorities to eminent domain if the land was needed to\nimplement federal projects. More than 50 years after the\nfounding of the United States, the Supreme Court confirmed\nthe absence of the federal government's right to eminent\ndomain. From the founding until the Civil War, the federal\ngovernment was believed to have eminent domain power\nsolely within the District of Columbia and the territories but\nnot within states. The federal government acquired the right\nto take land through eminent domain after the Supreme Court\nestablished the existence of this power in the 1875 case of\nKohl v. United States; this power is now taken for granted\nTo exercise the power of eminent domain to ensure the\npublic good, the government must prove that four elements\nare present: (a) private property, (b) must be taken, (c) for\npublic use, (d) and with just compensation. It is very impor-\ntant for the last element that the price is the market price.\nCrops, grass, trees, minerals, and all other items located on\nthe land plot withdrawn for public use are considered.\nCondemnation proceedings are conducted as quickly as\npossible, and consist of two phases: proceedings that relate\nto the right of the condemner to take the property and pro-\nceedings to set the amount of compensation to be paid for the\nproperty taken (\"Eminent Domain,\" 2008).\nThe abovementioned 14th Amendment requires that a\ntaking must be for \"public use\" to be allowable. In the 1954\ncase of Berman v. Parker, the Supreme Court of the United\nStates decided that \"public use\" could be interpreted as for a\n\"public purpose\" (\"Eminent Domain Takings for Private\nDevelopment,\" 2015). The Court upheld the use of eminent\ndomain to develop slum areas for possible sale to private\ninterests. The purpose of the act in question was to improve\nareas that were injurious to the public health, safety, morals,\nand welfare of the community (Mills, 2015). However, this\nunderstanding of \"slum areas\" is controversial.\nIn the case of City of Las Vegas Downtown Redevelopment\nAgency v. Pappas, the Supreme Court of Nevada agreed that the\ncity of Las Vegas was in a state of \"blight,\" and thus gave offi-\ncial permission for the alienation of property to construct a park-\ning garage that served several casinos. The Court concluded that\nthe center of the city suffered from the economic downturn,\nwhich involved downward trends in the business community,\nrelocation of existing business outside of the community, busi-\nness failures, and loss of sales or visitor volumes. However, it is\nclear that virtually any area of any city may occasionally experi-\nence some crisis economic phenomena, including loss of visi-\ntors as a source of income (Afanasieva, 2013).\nIn the judgment on the case of Poletown Neighbourhood\nCouncil v. City of Detroit, the Michigan Supreme Court sup-\nported the planned purchase of a large plot of land to con-\nstruct a General Motors assembly plant, meaning, in this case,\nthe need for Detroit's economic development as the public\npurpose. In the judgment on the Hawaii Housing Authority v.\nMidklif case, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the constitu-\ntionality of the Hawaii Land Reform Act of 1967 providing\nfor the possibility of the withdrawal of land plots to reduce\nthe concentration of land belonging to a number of large land-\nowners. Subsequently, after the purchase, the land was sup-\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court issued a largely unpopular\ndecision in the case of Kelo v. City of New London, expand-\ning the interpretation of \"public purpose\" further. In the deci-\nsion, the court held that the government could take private\nproperty to transfer it to another private owner for an eco-\nnomic development purpose, claiming that the economic\ngrowth enjoyed by the community from new private devel-\nopments could constitute a valid public purpose. This opened\nthe door for developers planning shopping centers and other\nsimilar construction projects to look to the government to\ntake any private property that may prevent their plans\n(\"Eminent Domain Takings for Private Development,\"\n2015). However, the problem included the fact that the U.S.\nlegislation has no official definition of \"economic develop-\nment,\" and state acts contain vague references to this term.\nConsequently, the main conclusion of the Kelo case was that\nthereafter, government authorities could perform compul-\nsory withdrawal of property from a private owner to develop\nprivate companies, when this property had no public purpose\nexcept for the development of the local economy. In addi-\ntion, following this judgment by the Supreme Court, 43\nstates have now reformed their laws to better protect prop-\nerty owners and have limited the government's eminent-\ndomain-related authority. Seven states' high courts have\nstepped in post-Kelo to protect the rights of homeowners\nagainst eminent domain abuse. The high courts of Hawaii,\nOhio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Missouri, New Jersey, and\nRhode Island have all ruled in favor of property owners and\nagainst eminent domain for private gain (Walsh, 2009).\nHowever, C. Kerekes and D. Stansel found \"virtually no\nevidence\" of eminent domain's economic benefit. The\nresearchers found no statistically significant relation between\neminent domain activity and the level of government reve-\nnue. In this regard, we should support the conclusion that\nprivate property is a fundamental tenet of the free market\nsystem. When individuals are allowed to use their property in\nthe manner they deem fit, the most efficient use of property\nbecomes a rational behavior. In turn, tax revenues are maxi-\nmized as individuals benefit from the value of their property\nThe list of types of \"public purpose\" is not exhaustive in\nthe United States, and may include involuntary withdrawal of\nprivate property for the construction of schools, streets, high-\nways, parks, airports, dams, water reservoirs, construction of\npublic housing, hospitals and public buildings (including\nthose resulting from the elimination of slums), and the con-\nstruction of oil pipelines. In the latter case, the legislation and\nthe judicial practice require the establishment, where possi-\nble, of easements instead of the full withdrawal of land plots.\nThis trend is caused by the increased withdrawal of land plots\nfrom owners for public needs (e.g., in the state of Texas) due\nto hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for oilfield activity. In these\ncases, landowners are encountering increased pressure from\npipeline companies to take land for easements (\"Eminent\nDomain Texas,\" 2015). In this regard, the Russian legislation\nshould include that land may be withdrawn solely if there is\nno other location of public or public\u00adprivate facilities or\nestablishment of easements is impossible.\nAnother trend, which is equally important and worthy of\nsupport, is the availability of large powers by constituent\nentities of the federation (states) in the United States for ter-\nmination of rights of private ownership of land plots\n(\"Eminent Domain Update,\" 2006). Much of this power\nbelongs to municipalities, which may adopt regulations on\nthis matter. For example, in Queen Creek (state of Arizona),\nthe Town Council unanimously approved a resolution pro-\nhibiting the condemnation of private property for economic\ndevelopment purposes (Local Legislation on Eminent\nDomain, 2015). Russia as well as the United States is a fed-\neration; however, the possibility of legal regulation of land\nownership relations (in terms of their withdrawal) by con-\nstituent entities representative of state power from the\nRussian Federation (territories, regions) is very limited. It\nappears that the U.S. experience should be further studied\nand introduced. For example, at the constituent entity level\nof the Russian Federation, such endowment of power would\nincrease the volume of guarantees of citizens'rights to reflect\nthe regional specifics. Therefore, we cannot agree with the\ntheorists believing that to protect the rights and legitimate\ninterests of owners and other right holders of land, it is nec-\nessary to specify the rule of Item \"c\" Paragraph 1 Article 72\nConstitution of the Russian Federation, which states that\n\"issues of emergence, limitation and termination of the right\nof ownership of land plots shall fall within the sole compe-\ntence of the Russian Federation\" (Balin, 2011, p. 8).\nIn our view, the task is exactly the opposite; it is necessary\nto develop and expand the joint competence area of the\nRussian Federation and its constituent entities to increase the\nlatter's land relations rights.\nProviding a positive assessment of many aspects of the\nlegal regulation of the withdrawal of land plots in the United\nStates, we should note that the existing practice of protection\nof citizens' rights when taking land plots for public needs\n(Kelo case) leads to a number of critical comments (particu-\nlarly because the land plots taken after review of the case of\nKelo v. City of New London were not developed by the com-\npany that initiated these proceedings).\nIn this regard, the Russian ban on withdrawal of land plots\nfor public needs associated with the economic development of\nmunicipalities appears to be a progressive phenomenon.\nConclusion\nRecognition of private ownership rights as \"sacred and inviola-\nble\" has played a positive role in history; however, the current\nmodel of guaranteed rights of private property owners does not\nexclude involuntary withdrawal of such property for the needs\nof the state and society.After the analysis of the current Russian\nlegislation, the scientific doctrine, and the juridical practice of\nwithdrawal of land from the owners by redemption, we\nAnisimov and Ryzhenkov 11\nconclude that in addition to public (state and municipal) needs,\nobjectively, there are public\u00adprivate needs aimed at the pursuit\nof interests not of the whole society but of a certain portion (e.g.,\nsports fans, for construction of an Olympic stadium). At the\nsame time, at the scientific doctrine and juridical practice levels\nas well as in the mass public consciousness, many government\nacts regarding withdrawal of land plots from owners are per-\nceived as unjust, which leads to negative social consequences.\nThere are a number of modes to solve the problems that\nexist in this field, which are far beyond law itself. In their\neconomic component, it is necessary to enhance the purchase\nprice calculation formula; in the legal component, both to\nchange federal legislation and to expand the rights and\nauthorities of the federation's constituent entities to settle the\nissues of acquisition and termination of ownership rights\nconsidering local conditions and traditions. In a philosophi-\ncal regard, it is necessary to continue studying the world out-\nlook of the population and its responses to decisions of the\ngovernment that affect the rights of the land plot owners.\nOur main conclusion regards the necessity of developing\na value-conscious approach to the legal aspects of the termi-\nnation of owners' rights in regarding the withdrawal of their\nland plots for public or public\u00adprivate needs.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAfanasieva, S.
