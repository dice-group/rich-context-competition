    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nWhether the creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) thresholds used to define chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD) identify metabolic abnormalities similarly in minority and nonminority populations is\nunknown. We addressed this question among adult participants in the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (n  15,837). GFR was estimated from serum creatinine\nvalues and metabolic abnormalities were defined by 5th or 95th percentile values. After adjustment for\nage, demographic characteristics, and GFR, black participants were significantly more likely than white\nparticipants to have abnormal levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, phosphorus,\nand uric acid. Hispanic subjects were significantly more likely to have abnormal levels of systolic blood\npressure, hemoglobin, bicarbonate, and phosphorus. Among participants with GFR  60 mL/min per\n1.73 m2, black participants were significantly more likely to have abnormal levels of systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure, hemoglobin, and uric acid; Hispanic subjects were significantly more likely to have\nabnormal systolic blood pressure levels. Metabolic abnormalities were more common in minority\npopulations, and low GFR appeared to have a multiplicative effect. Defining CKD using a single GFR\nthreshold may be disadvantageous for minority populations because metabolic abnormalities are\npresent at higher levels of GFR.\nEstimates indicate that approximately 19 million\nadults in the United States have chronic kidney dis-\nease (CKD),1 and recent public health initiatives\nhave focused on harmonizing case definitions and\nearly identification in the general population.2\u00ad4\nSeveral community-based studies have shown a\ngraded association between GFR and the risk for\ncardiovascular disease and death, providing further\nsupport for the hypothesis that earlier detection of\nCKD leads to public health improvement.1,5\u00ad9 Risk\nfactors for CKD include older age, hypertension,\ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease, and family history\nof CKD.\nSeveral national guidelines have recommended\nthe use of serum creatinine levels to measure GFR,\nvalue, in part because treatable renal abnormalities\nbecome increasingly prevalent as GFR falls below\nthis level.2,10\u00ad12 At the level of public health policy,\ndemonstrating a GFR value below this threshold\nbefore embarking on an exhaustive search for renal\ncomplications would seem to be a rational use of\nthese guidelines. Surprisingly, it is unknown\nwhether such a two-stage strategy performs simi-\nlarly in minority and nonminority populations. In\nparticular, if GFR thresholds are to become the\ngatekeeper to more intensive investigation and in-\ntervention, then it would seem important to know\nwhether renal abnormalities develop at similar GFR\nvalues among individuals of different races and eth-\nnicities. Hence, the objectives of this national study\nPublished online ahead of print. Publication date available at\nwww.jasn.org.\nCorrespondence: Dr. Robert N.

As\nexpected, the presence of CKD seemed to multiply prevalence\nestimates, irrespective of race. In aggregate, these observations\nseem to suggest that CKD management strategies based on\nsingle GFR thresholds may be disadvantageous to populations\nin which these complications are more prevalent, namely eth-\nnic and racial minorities. In particular, the findings suggest\npriate for detecting several metabolic abnormalities in minor-\nity populations.\nIt was been known for several years that the burden of ESRD\n(requiring renal replacement therapy) differs substantially in\ndifferent racial and ethnic groups in the United States, with\nmuch higher event rates among black individuals.13\u00ad17\nProgress has been made in the arena of CKD, especially with\nregard to interventions that slow the progression of important\ncauses, such as diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive ne-\nWe found that black individuals have a lower prevalence of\nReasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (RE-\nGARDS) study.20 People of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity now\nform the largest single minority population in the United\nStates,21 and there is little reason to suspect that they should\nhave intrinsically lower risk for kidney disease; unfortunately,\nvery few studies have attempted to quantify the burden of CKD\nin this population.\nWe found that, unlike several other variables, mean potas-\nsium levels were lower in black individuals, when adjustment\nwas made for GFR. A substantial body of evidence suggests that\nblack individuals may be relatively potassium deficient com-\npared with white individuals. For example, urinary potassium\nexcretion seems to be lower on random diets22\u00ad25 and on diets\nTable 3.

Therefore, it was not possible to\ndetermine whether associations between serum creatinine and\ntrue GFR values differ in community-dwelling adults of differ-\nent races and ethnicities and similar age and gender distribu-\ntion. Similarly, it was not possible to determine whether com-\nplications associated with declining GFR develop at different\nGFR levels or whether the higher prevalence of GFR-associated\ncomplications in minority groups with GFR 60 ml/min per\n1.73 m2 reflects a greater prevalence of these complications in\ngeneral, irrespective of GFR level. The data presented here tend\nto support the latter hypothesis. For example, in this study,\ncompared with white participants, black participants had\nhigher adjusted OR for high BP and low hemoglobin levels,\nregardless of whether GFR levels were 60 ml/min per 1.73\nm2. For Hispanic participants, similar between-GFR category\nparallels were seen for high BP, low hemoglobin, and high\nphosphorus.\nThe limitations of our study should be pointed out. It was\ncross-sectional, and longitudinal measures were not available.\nMirroring clinical reality, gold-standard measures of GFR,\nsuch as those based on inulin or isotope clearance methods,\nwere not used. Limitations notwithstanding, we believe that\nthis study has useful features. The study design facilitates quan-\ntification of the burden and the complications of CKD in a\nnationally representative sample. Overall, this study suggests\nTable 4.
