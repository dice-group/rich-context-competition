This finding is important for\nboth future attempts at modeling the determinants of ado-\nlescent television viewing and suggestions for future policy\ninterventions. The presence of social interactions im-\nplies that interventions that affect the social norms of tele-\nvision viewing within schools could also change indi-\nvidual television viewing. In reducing the number of hours\nof television watched, these interventions could also posi-\ntively affect adolescent obesity, emotional problems, and\nacademic achievement.\npart of adolescents' lives,\nand its effects are contro-\nversial. Many studies have\nreported several negative\nconsequences of television viewing, in-\ncluding increases in obesity, attentional\nproblems and aggression, and decreases in\nseveral measures of academic achieve-\nment.1-4 In contrast, other studies have\nshown that some types of programming are\nassociated with positive developmental\noutcomes.5 There have also been several\nrandomized interventions aimed at reduc-\ning television as a means of decreasing\nnegative outcomes.3,6 This article exam-\nines the importance of social interactions\nin adolescent television choices. Social in-\nteractions follow the conceptual idea of the\nestablishment of a social norm of televi-\nsion viewing within peer groups. The idea\nof interdependent choices, or social inter-\nactions, across individuals, where indi-\nvidual choices are affected by the choices\nof peers, is becoming established in the\nsocial sciences as an important aspect of\nindividual decision making. Current re-\nsearch examines potential social interac-\ntions in crime, school attendance, and un-\nemployment.7-9 For example, a student\nmight choose to attend school on a par-\nticular day based on whether his or her\nfriends will attend school. The intuitive\nreason for this interdependence in choices\nis that friends want to be involved in ac-\ntivities together whether the activities are\npleasant (eg, skipping school to go to the\nmall) or unpleasant (eg, attending school).\nThis study tested whether social norms\ncreated by schoolmates influence indi-\nvidual choices in television viewing.

Evidence of social in-\nteractions suggests several new directions for potential\ninterventions. If social norms are an important determi-\nnant of individual television viewing, interventions that\nseek to shape these norms within schools could be a valu-\nable future direction for research. Some forms of social\ninteractions also imply that interventions on a subset of\nindividuals within a school will have a spillover effect on\nstudents who did not receive the intervention. Both im-\nplications of finding social interactions in television view-\ning choices represent new and interesting directions for\nfuture policy suggestions.\nMETHODS\nDATA\nData for this study were drawn from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a na-\ntionally representative study of adolescents in grades 7 through\nunder a grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Hu-\nman Development, with co-funding from 17 other federal agen-\ncies. Data at the individual, family, school, and community lev-\ninformation about the Add Health data are provided else-\nwhere.10,11 The sample used in this study consists of all adoles-\ncents in grades 7 through 12 in the wave II public-use data col-\nadolescents have valid school identification codes, which are nec-\nessary to calculate school-level variables and place individuals in\ntheir school environments. The sample of students with valid\nschool identification codes is similar to those students with miss-\ning codes across many of the covariates examined in this study,\nbut they are slightly more likely to be white (0.72 vs 0.68) and\nhours data and 3141 had complete covariate data after family in-\ncome was imputed using single imputation techniques for 600\nindividuals. The use of this data set was preapproved by the Uni-\nversity of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board, Madison.\nMEASURES\nOutcome Variables\nThe primary outcome measure was self-reported hours of tele-\nvision viewing per week at the individual level.\nIndependent Variables\nThe primary predictor of interest was the mean reported hours\nof television viewing of an individual's school. For each indi-\nvidual, this measure was the sample average of all individuals\nin the same school (except the individual). Several important\ncovariates were also included in the analysis. The individual's\nsex was included because it is well documented that male stu-\ndents watch more television than female students do.12 Like-\nwise, race (white, black, or Hispanic) was included to capture\nknown differences in television viewing across these groups.13\nOverweight status was included because it has consistently been\nshown to be highly correlated with television viewing.1,13 An\nindividual's grade in school and grade point average were in-\ncluded because television viewing decreases as students age and\nacademic achievement is likely to be negatively correlated with\ntelevision viewing. Family income, rural status, and employ-\nment were included to control for availability of activities for\nadolescents that are substitutes for television. Finally, school-\nlevel characteristics (eg, racial composition and income) were\nincluded to capture differences in the school environment across\nindividuals. Since geographic identifiers are unavailable in the\ndata set, no variables that directly measure community access\nto television programming can be used in the analysis.\nThe analytical approaches included multivariate linear regres-\nsion and 2-stage least squares regression using the Huber-White\nestimator of variance to account for the fact that more than 1 child\nwas assessed in each school.14 Wave II sample weights were also\nused to adjust for the complex sampling design in the data. The\nestimated regression model was of the following form:\nYis\n= X\n\u00e6\nis\n+ X\n\u00e6\n-is\n+ Y\n\u00e6\nis\n+ \nis\nwhere individual i in school s chooses television viewing level Yis\nand has individual characteristics X. School-level variables are in-\ncluded in X\nfl (with individual i omitted), and school-level televi-\nsion choices are included in Y\nfl (with individual i omitted). The\nmain parameter of interest is , which is the estimate of the im-\nportanceofsocialinteractioninindividualtelevisionchoices.Two-\nstage least squares regression is necessary in the empirical analy-\nsis because group behavior affects individual behavior and vice\nversa. This simultaneity in choices leads to the reflection prob-\nlem first discussed by Manski15,16 in the economics literature. The\nreflection problem occurs in most empirical research that at-\ntemptstodemonstrateanassociationbetweenindividual-leveland\ngroup-level behavior. Manski proved that most estimates of  are\nnotidentifiedwithoutusinginstrumentalvariablesorothermeth-\nods.16 The instrumental variables approach solves the reflection\nproblem by finding a variable that is related to the individual out-\ncome at the individual level but not at the group level.17,18 For\nthis analysis, employment status was used to identify the rela-\ntionship between group television viewing and individual tele-\nvision viewing. Intuitively, the assumption is that an individu-\nal's employment status is related (negatively) to the individual's\ntelevision viewing, because individuals who are employed have\nless available time to watch television, but the proportion of em-\nployed students in an individual's school is not associated with\nthe individual's choice of how much television to watch. The pro-\nportion of employed students is assumed to affect the individu-\nal's television viewing only through its affect on the school-level\ntelevision viewing measure.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 gives descriptive statistics of the variables used\nin the study. The mean number of hours per week of tele-\nvision viewing was almost 15. The average number of chil-\ndren in the 131 schools in the sample was nearly 40. Stu-\ndents are exposed to a wide variety of school-level\nemployment;theschool-levelproportionofstudentswork-\ning varies from 0% to 95% of the sampled student body.\nFinally, the school-level average number of hours of tele-\nvision viewing varies between 2 and 32 hours per week.\nTable 2 gives the results of the regressions of the de-\nterminants of individual hours of television viewing.

Robust standard errors that allow for cor-\nrelated errors at the school level are shown under the co-\nefficients, and wave II sample weights are used. Male stu-\ndents report watching 2 hours of television per week more\nthan female students. While black students report 5 more\nhours of television viewing than do white students, there\nwas little difference between white and Hispanic stu-\ndents in television viewing time. As students age, they\nreport watching less television. Employed students re-\nport watching television almost 2 hours less than unem-\nployed students do. Students with higher grade point av-\nerages also report watching fewer hours of television.\nFinally, while family income had a small and statisti-\ncally insignificant relationship with television viewing,\nstudents who attended schools with wealthier class-\nmates report less television viewing.\nColumn 2 lists results for 2-stage least squares analy-\nsis. To estimate this empirical model, an instrumental vari-\nable must be chosen. Without an instrumental variable,\nthe coefficient of interest ( in the equation) is not iden-\ntified. The instrumental variable must meet 2 criteria for\nthe estimation results to be valid. First, the variable must\nbe strongly related to the school-level average of televi-\nsion hours. This criterion was met because the (unre-\nported) first-stage relationship between school-level em-\nployment and school-level television hours had a t statistic\nof almost 17. Second, the variable must be uncorrelated\nwith the unobserved error term. Because it was impos-\nsible to document that this criterion is satisfied, in prac-\ntice it must be assumed. Suggestive evidence that school-\nlevel employment was uncorrelated with the unobserved\nerror can be found in the result from column 1 that school-\nlevel employment was uncorrelated with the individual\nchoice of television hours.\nThe results in column 2 for individual and family vari-\nables change little from the results in column 1. The main\nresult was that the level of school television viewing was\npositively related to individual hours. The results sug-\ngest that a 1-hour increase in school-level hours in-\ncreases the individual's television viewing by almost half\nCOMMENT\nThisanalysishasproducedevidencethatindividualchoices\nof how many hours to watch television are determined, in\npart, by choices by schoolmates.

However, since this\nframework can only show the existence of social influ-\nences on individual decisions and not the mechanism un-\nderlying the process, why and how the social influences\naffect individual decisions are unclear. It could be that in-\ndividuals in the same school watch similar amounts of tele-\nvisionsothattheycandiscusstelevisionduringschool.The\ndata set contained information only on hours of television\nwatched and not specific content, which does not allow the\nhypothesized mechanism to be tested explicitly.19 Further\nexaminations of the mechanism through which social in-\nteractions shape individuals' television choices are an im-\nportant area for future research.\nSeveral important limitations of this research require\nelaboration. It is possible that the ability of parents to\nchoose schools for their children account for some por-\ntion of the relationship. If parents who do not actively\nmonitor their children's television viewing send their chil-\ndren to similar schools, a portion of the results could be\nspurious. This unobserved parental trait would have to\nbe inadequately controlled for in the covariates for this\nto be a substantive concern. Including a variable that mea-\nsures the frequency of parental participation in parent-\nteacher association events was not significant when in-\ncluded in the regression analyses. While this variable was\nnot available for all students, it does allow some confi-\ndence that the results are likely not significantly af-\nfected by unobserved parental characteristics.\nAn additional potential weakness of this research has\nbeen the reliance on measures of self-reported television\nviewing rather than actual viewing.20-23 This problem is not\nunique to this research but might be particularly concern-\ning if self-reported measures of television viewing are af-\nfected by social norms within schools. Examination of this\nissue would require additional data that are unavailable.\nWith these caveats in mind, overall the results suggest\nthe presence of social interactions in adolescents' televi-\nsionchoices.Theimportanceofthisfindingforpolicymak-\ners is that social interactions imply that policies that shape\nsocial norms in schools could be an effective direction for\ninterventions to reduce television viewing.
