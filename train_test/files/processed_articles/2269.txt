School closure is known to reduce\ndisease transmission, as demonstrated by Chao, Halloran and Longini (2010),\nboth an individual and societal level. Mathematical models show that vaccinating\nschool-aged children is an effective strategy when vaccine supplies are limited;\nsee, for example, Loeb et al. (2010) and Basta et al. (2009). When a new strain of\ninfluenza virus or other pathogen has emerged, large-scale agent-based epidemic\nsimulation models have been used to predict epidemic spread and compare in-\ntervention strategies. The methodology underlying these models is described in\net al. (2006). These models simulate human contact behavior, and disease may be\ntransmitted when an infectious person contacts a susceptible person. In most such\nmodels, social contact behavior is approximated by random mixing within class-\nrooms and schools, as well as homes, workplaces and other mixing groups. That\nis, people contact other mixing group members with equal probability during each\ntime step. This process is a simplification of the true underlying social structure.\nSimulation studies have shown that network structure can influence epidemic\ndynamics. Several papers have demonstrated the varying influence of clustering\nand repetition in contacts on disease spread for a range of parameter values.\n(2007) simulate idealized, simplified networks that are not informed by data on\ncontact behavior. For example, the number of contacts in their models is equal\nfor all individuals. Miller (2009) explores these network structures using Episims,\na realistic agent-based network simulation model built from transportation, loca-\ntion, activity and demographic data, but not directly informed by contact surveys\n(2008) explored the influence of degree distribution on disease spread, where the\ndegree of a person is the number of contacts he/she makes. The former of these\nuses a contact survey of 49 respondents, while the latter performs simulations\nbased on idealized networks. The development of statistical techniques to infer\ndetailed and realistically complex network models for face-to-face contacts based\non available survey data is a relatively new area. Recent work with the multicoun-\ntry European POLYMOD study, a diary-based survey of contact behavior, has in-\nferred within-household contact networks [Potter et al. (2011a)] and age-based\nhave a clear picture of the entire contact network, nor a complete understanding of\nthe relevant network structures for epidemic transmission.\nSome papers have focused on characterizing within-school contact behavior in\nthe context of understanding disease transmission. Glass and Glass (2008) admin-\nistered contact surveys in an American elementary, middle and high school, and\ncharacterized contact duration and intensity by grade and location. Conlan et al.\n(2011) developed a new method to collect contact network data and analyzed mix-\ning patterns, clustering and other network properties in 11 British primary schools.\nAlthough these studies provide important information regarding contact behavior\nwithin schools, neither develops a method for inference of the entire within-school\ncontact network. Cauchemez et al. (2009) analyzed network and symptom sta-\ntus data in a fourth grade class during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. They found\nthat selective mixing by gender influences the disease dynamics, but found no ev-\nidence for a playmate network or classroom neighbor effect on the transmission\nprobability. However, because the sample size was small and asymptomatic and\nunobserved cases were not accounted for in the analysis, their findings are not\ndefinitive. Stehl\u00e9 et al. (2011a) describe a face-toface contact network in a primary\nschool using proximity sensor data. Salath\u00e9 et al. (2010) analyze wireless sensor\ndata to describe the contact network in an American high school and demonstrate\nthrough simulation studies that using network data to inform interventions can\nreduce the disease burden. Xia et al. (2010) demonstrate that modeling network\nstructure within schools in a large-scale simulation model can impact global epi-\ndemic dynamics.\nIn this paper we develop a statistical model of a within-school contact network\nin order to understand how social network structures within schools influence dis-\nease transmission. In Section 2 we describe our two data sources: friendship net-\nwork data from a high school and a survey on contact behavior in high schools.\nSection 3 describes our methodology to model the contact network and compare\nepidemics based on this contact network to those under random mixing. In Sec-\ntion 3.1 we outline our method to model the contact network conditional on the\nfriendship network. In Section 3.2 we describe how we estimate the contact de-\ngree distribution from the contact survey, and in Section 3.3 we describe how we\nmodel the contact network conditional on the degree distribution. In Section 3.4\nwe describe how we simulate contact networks from our model, and we describe\nour influenza simulation procedure in Section 3.5. We then compare performance\nof different variations of the contact network model in Section 3.6. In Section 3.7\nwe present our model for the friendship network itself. In Section 3.8 we describe\nour procedure to compare epidemics based on our network model to random mix-\ning under three different scenarios: no intervention, a targeted antiviral prophylaxis\nintervention, and a grade closure strategy. Results from these comparisons are pre-\nsented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5.\n2. Data. We use two data sources to inform our contact network model. The\nfirst is friendship network data from the Add Health study, a survey of health, de-\nmographic and relational data administered in 80 American high schools spanning\ngrades 7\u00ad12, or high school plus feeder school combinations for high schools not\nspanning those grades [Harris (2009)]. The second was A Survey on Epidemics\nin High Schools, administered in two Virginia high schools by the Network Dy-\nnamics and Simulation Science Laboratory at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and\nState University during the spring of 2009 [Xia et al. (2010)]. The goal of the Add\nHealth study was to survey all students in each school [Harris et al. (2009)]. Prior\nFIG. 1. Distribution of number of friends in the epidemic survey (left) and in school 18 in the Add\nHealth data set (right). The different definitions of \"close friendship\" in the two data sources produce\nsimilar distributions of number of close friends.\nto the survey, each school created a school roster listing all students with identifi-\ncation numbers. Students were given a copy of the roster and identified their five\nbest male friends and five best female friends. Students could nominate friends not\non the roster, and could nominate fewer than five friends of each sex. In this paper,\nwe analyze one school configuration with 1,314 students. We selected this school\nbecause it is fairly large and has less missing data than other schools. We model\ncontact behavior among the 1,074 students who responded to the survey, were on\nthe school roster on the survey date, and have nonmissing grade values. We as-\nsume that two students are friends if a reciprocated or unreciprocated nomination\noccurred. By defining friendship in this way, the friend degree distribution in this\ndata set is similar to that found in the contact survey. The two degree distributions\nare compared in Figure 1.\nOur contact data source, A Survey on Epidemics in High Schools, was adminis-\ntered in two Virginia high schools. In one, classes were randomly sampled and the\nsurvey given to all consenting students in the sampled classes, resulting in a sample\nonly 246 students returned the survey because interviewers did not explicitly state\nthat students were supposed to return the form. We'll refer to this from here on\nas the \"epidemic survey.\" The survey defines a \"contact\" to mean \"being in close\nproximity for more than roughly five minutes.\" Respondents reported the average\nnumber of contacts they make during class breaks and the lunch break, the number\nof close friends they have in their school, and whether students sitting near them\nin class are mostly close friends, classmates but not close friends or a mix of the\ntwo. They also estimated the percentage of contacts they made to friends.\nFigure 2 shows the relationship between friendship network, contact network\nand transmission network. The top panel depicts a subset of the Add Health friend-\nship network. The middle panel shows a simulated contact network among this\nsame set of students for one day. Here, an edge between two nodes means they\nmade one or more contacts, and the shade of the edge represents the total dura-\ntion of contact throughout the day for that pair. The contact network is denser than\nFIG. 2. The top figure shows a subset of the Add Health friendship network. The middle figure\nshows a simulated contact network based on this friendship network; here an edge represents one or\nmore contacts during one day, and the shade of gray represents the total duration of contact between\neach pair. The bottom figure shows a simulated transmission network based on this contact network.\nThe seed of the epidemic is black; the color of other nodes indicates whether they became infected\nduring the epidemic or not. The friendship network was plotted with a standard layout algorithm\nwhich places connected vertices closer and disconnected vertices farther away in order to reduce\nnumbers of edge crossings and reflect inherent symmetry [Fruchterman and Reingold (1991)]. The\nother two plots use the same vertex layout as the friendship network.\nthe friendship network, as students tend to contact their close friends as well as\nmany other students during a typical school day. Of key scientific interest is the\ntransmission network, an example of which is shown in the bottom panel. The\ndependency in the networks is shown by the higher numbers of contacts between\nfriends and higher numbers of transmission events between friends. In this paper\nwe focus on inference of the contact network and explore how contact network\nstructure impacts the transmission process.\n3. Methodology. Our friendship network data forms the basis for our contact\nnetwork model. One approach to model the contact network for these students\nwould be to let friendships represent contacts, assuming that students contact all\nof their close friends, and no other schoolmates, on a given day. Such a model\nwould be overly simplistic. We believe that students are more likely to contact their\nfriends and make longer durations of contacts to friends, but also contact other\nstudents in their classes and in the school. We build a complex model capturing\nthese tendencies. We model contact behavior among the students in the Add Health\nfriendship network, using the epidemic survey to estimate numbers of contacts\nand preference of contacts to friends. Finally, we estimate the friendship network\nitself from individual-level attributes so that our model can be used for an arbitrary\nschool.\n3.1. Modeling the contact network conditional on the friendship network. We\nfirst describe our methodology to estimate the contact network conditional on the\nempirical friendship network. We chose to model the friendship network itself as a\nfinal step. Comparison of epidemics based on the empirical friendship network to\nthose based on a friendship network simulated from our model assists with model\nvalidation for the friendship network model. Through this comparison, we assess\nwhether the friendship network model captures the network structures relevant to\nthe transmission process.\nWe can represent the contact network graphically by letting each student be\na node and each contact be an edge between two nodes. The degree of a node\nis the number of contacts made by that student during one day. We denote the\ncontact network by an n by n sociomatrix Y, where n is the number of students in\nthe school. Yij denotes the number of 10-minute contacts between student i and\nstudent j. Each pair of nodes in the network is referred to as a dyad.\nWe assume that students have seven classes of 40 minutes each, a 50-minute\nlunch break and five 10-minute nonlunch breaks. We define a \"contact\" to be a\n10-minute face-to-face social contact. If two students spend an hour together, that\nis considered six \"contacts.\" We allow a maximum of 38 contacts (6 hours and\ntwenty minutes) between any two students on a given day.\n3.2. Modeling the contact degree distribution. We model the degree distribu-\ntion of the network using data from the epidemic survey. We assume that students\nreported numbers of schoolmates contacted rather than numbers of 10-minute\nchunks of time spent in contact. We model break contacts and lunch contacts with\nnegative binomial distributions because the observed sample mean and variance\nindicate over-dispersion. We used number of friends as a predictor, expecting stu-\ndents with higher numbers of friends to make more contacts at school. We fit a gen-\neralized linear model with the glm.nb function in the MASS library in R [Venables\nsome outliers: we recoded 11 reports of break contacts greater than 20 to 20, and\nwe removed 11 reports of numbers of close friends that were over 40, assuming\nthat these students defined \"close friend\" differently than the others. Our model\nestimates a mean of 4.5 break contacts for a student with zero friends and an in-\ncrease in expected number of break contacts by a factor of 1.03 for each additional\nbetween lunch contacts and number of close friends; the model estimated an in-\ncrease in expected number of lunch contacts by a factor of 1.00 for each additional\ntact distribution with a negative binomial distribution with no predictor. To reduce\nthe influence of outliers, we used a fitting procedure which assumes that reports\nabove a specified cutoff contain no other information apart from being above the\ncutoff. We chose a cutoff of 30 for average lunch contacts, so reported lunch con-\ntacts over 30 were treated as if these students had reported \">30\" lunch contacts.\nprobability, so we multiplied each simulated contact by a randomly chosen number\nbetween one and five. The fitting procedure is implemented with the anbmle()\nfunction available in the degreenet package in R [R Development Core Team\nClassroom contacts were not reported, so we create a model for the within-\nclassroom contact degree distribution as follows. We assumed students take classes\nonly with others in the same grade. Each student is randomly assigned to have 2, 3\nor 4 class neighbors with probabilities 1/9, 4/9 and 4/9 in each class. We assumed\nthat students make 40 minutes of continuous contact with each of their neighbors\nduring each class period, that they have the same class neighbors each day, and\nthat they only contact class neighbors during class time.\nThe distribution of total contacts is obtained by summing the classroom, lunch\nand break contacts together for each student. This distribution has a mean of 148,\nor 25 person-hours of contact per student per day. We validated our fitted degree\ndistribution by comparing it to contact reports from an alternate data source, the\nPOLYMOD study [Mossong et al. (2008)]. This validation is described in the sup-\nplementary material [Potter et al. (2011b)].\n3.3. Modeling the contact network conditional on the degrees. We depict the\ndegrees as a set of nodes representing students, each of whom has a number of\nstubs representing their contacts. In this section we describe how these stubs will\nbe linked, forming the entire network of contacts between students. We denote the\ndegrees as a vector D of length n, where Di is the number of contacts student i\nmakes in one day.\nLet Ybl be the sociomatrix of contacts occurring during any of the class breaks or\nduring lunch and Yc denote the within-class contact sociomatrix, so Y = Ybl\n+ Yc.\nWe model Ybl conditional on the break and lunch contact degrees, and we model Yc\nconditional on the class contact degrees. Let Dbl denote the vector of break/lunch\ndegrees. Then the probability distribution for Ybl can be expressed:\nP(Ybl\n= ybl) =\ndbl\nP(Ybl\n= ybl\n|Dbl\n= dbl)P(Dbl\n= dbl).\nBecause respondents in the epidemic survey report an average of 68% of con-\ntacts occurring to friends, our model distributes 68% of contacts to friends and\n32% to nonfriends, with a maximum of 10 contacts per dyad allowed (since there\nare 100 minutes in the 5 breaks plus lunch period combined). Apart from these\nconstraints, contacts occur randomly conditional on the degree distribution, which\nmeans that all networks satisfying these constraints have equal probability:\nP(Ybl\n= y|Dbl\n= dbl) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc(dbl)\n, if {i,j : i,j are friends} yij\ni,j\nyij\nand yij\nand\nj\nyij\n= dbl,i\n0, otherwise,\nwhere c(dbl) is a normalizing constant.\nWe develop a method to simulate networks from a specified degree vector, with\nrandom mixing conditional on degree and permitting multiple edges (up to a speci-\nfied maximum) between two nodes. Our method is an extension of the reedmol-\nloy() function in the degreenet package in R [R Development Core Team\nget percentage of edges to friends p, and let di denote the degree of node i. We\nfirst compute the target number of contacts between friends, denoted by T :\nT = p\nn\ndi\n.\nWe randomly sample a stub, and let i denote the node possessing this stub. We\nconsider the set of friends of i which have fewer than m edges to i. We randomly\nsample one friend from this set, with probability proportional to the remaining\n(unassigned) degree of each friend. Then the two stubs are connected. This pro-\ncedure is repeated until we have T contacts between friends. Next, we repeat the\nprocess for nonfriend contacts. The procedure requires the sum of the degrees to be\neven and enough friendships so that m times the number of friendships is greater\nthan or equal to T . Since self-self edges are not permitted, the procedure also re-\nquires max(d)  {i : dimax(d)} min{m,di\n}.\nTo simulate break/lunch contact networks, we first sample lunch and break con-\ntacts from the fitted degree distributions for each student. Then we distribute 68%\nof contacts to friends, with a maximum of 10 contacts occurring between any pair\nof friends.\nNext we describe the probability distribution for our class contact network. We\nassume that students take classes only with others in the same grade. We model the\nmatrix of class neighbors, Yneighbors, where Yneighbors,ij is the number of classes in\nwhich i and j are neighbors. We then assume that each pair of class neighbors\nmakes 40 minutes of continuous contact during each shared class, so the contact\nmatrix is Yc\n= 4Yneighbors.\nTo model Yneighbors, let Yk denote the n by n matrix showing classroom neigh-\nbors within grade k. That is, if i and j are in grade k, then the ijth element of\nYk is the number of classes in which i and j are class neighbors, and if i or j is\nnot in grade k, then Yk,ij\n= 0. Then Yneighbors\n+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + Y12. We model\ndegrees of class neighbors within grade k as described previously. Because 74% of\nrespondents in the epidemic survey reported sitting next to \"A mix of friends and\nnonfriends\" in class, we assume that 50% of class neighbors are friends. Using the\nprocedure described above, we distribute 50% of class neighbors to be friends and\nallow students to be neighbors in more than one class, with a maximum of 7 shared\nclasses. Thus,\nP(Yk\n= y|D = d) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc(d)\n, if {i,j : i,j are friends} yij\ni,j\nyij\nand\nj\nyij\n= di,\n0, otherwise,\nwhere c(d) is a normalizing constant.\nTo simulate a class contact network for one day, we first sample class neighbor\ndegrees for each grade from the fitted degree distributions. Then we use our modi-\nfied reedmolloy() function to distribute 50% of neighbors to friends, allowing two\nstudents to be neighbors in a maximum of 7 classes, for each of the grades. We\nmultiply these class neighbor matrices by four to obtain class contact matrices for\neach grade, and sum the seven grade-specific class contact matrices to obtain the\nclass contact matrix for the entire day.\n3.4. Contact network simulation procedure. In this section we describe our\nalgorithm to simulate contact networks from our model. The uncertainty in esti-\nmation of the input parameters to our model will propagate to create uncertainty\nin epidemic predictions. We use a nonparametric bootstrap to estimate this uncer-\nWe simulate a contact network as follows:\n(1) Resample with replacement from the epidemic survey.\n(2) Using the resampled data, estimate degree distribution parameters (as de-\nscribed in Section 3.2), and compute the average percentage of contacts to friends.\nDenote this percentage by X, where E[X] = 68%.\n(3) Simulate break and lunch contact degrees from the fitted distributions.\n(4) Link stubs (as described in Section 3.3) so that X% of break and lunch\ncontacts are between friends.\n(5) Simulate class neighbor degrees from the assumed degree distribution, de-\nscribed in Section 3.2.\n(6) Link stubs (as described in Section 3.3) so that 50% of class neighbors are\nfriends.\n(7) Multiply by 4, assuming that class neighbors make 40 minutes of continu-\nous contact in each shared class.\n(8) Sum the break/lunch contact network and class contact network matrices to\nobtain the contact network matrix for one day.\nTo produce a dynamic contact network model, we sample a new break/lunch\ncontact network each day of the influenza season, but keep the same class con-\ntact network throughout the influenza season. In the supplementary material, we\npresent descriptive analyses of contact networks simulated from our model and\nfind their properties to be consistent with our observed data [Potter et al. (2011b)].\n3.5. Influenza simulation procedure. We simulated influenza outbreaks in\nschools using the natural history of influenza as was done by Chao, Halloran and\nLongini (2010). We assume that each student has an incubation period (time be-\ntween exposure and appearance of symptoms) of 1, 2 or 3 days with probabilities\n6 days, after which he/she is moved to the immune category. Transmission can oc-\ncur only when contact is made between an infected person and a susceptible per-\nson. For each infected person, we sample a curve of viral load over time from those\nof six patients in the human challenge study described in Murphy et al. (1980) and\nBaccam et al. (2006), and we assume that the infectiousness of each person on\na given day is proportional to their viral load. We assume that 67% of students\nbecome symptomatic during their infectious period, and symptomatic people are\ntwice as infectious as asymptomatic people, so their infectiousness is proportional\nto twice their viral load. Let pt,i denote the per-10-minute transmission proba-\nbility of person i on day t. The events that i transmits to j during two different\n10-minute contacts are dependent, since transmission during the earlier contact\nprecludes transmission during the latter. Thus, if j is susceptible,\nP(j escapes infection by person i on day t) = (1 - pt,i)Yij ,\nso\nP(j infected on day t) = 1 -\nn\n(1 - pt,i)Yij .\nWe assume 75% of sick students withdraw to the home: 20.3% on the first day\nthey have symptoms, 39.7% on the second, and 15% on the third [Chao, Halloran\nWe used mean per-10-minute transmission probabilities ranging from 0.001 to\n0.007. We track the epidemic until no infected people remain. We estimated the\nprobability of epidemic (defined as more than 200 students becoming infected),\nthe peak date of the disease season and the final epidemic size. In performing sim-\nulations for model comparison (described in the following section), we simulated\n500 outbreaks for each model; this number was sufficient to distinguish between\nthem. In performing simulations validating the friendship network model fit, we\nsimulated 2,000 outbreaks, which was sufficient to validate model fit. For simula-\ntions using our final model and random mixing, with and without interventions, we\nsimulated 10,000 outbreaks for each scenario to minimize uncertainty in epidemic\noutcome estimates.\n3.6. Model comparison. We compared three different versions of the contact\nnetwork model. In the dynamic contact network model, students keep the same\nclass contacts for the duration of the influenza season, but we sample a new\nbreak/lunch contact network each day. There is, to our knowledge, no previous\nwork on modeling dynamic within-school contact networks, and we consider this\nto be our most realistic model. To assess whether these dynamics influenced epi-\ndemic predictions, we compared this to a static contact network model, in which\nstudents contact the same people each day for the duration of the influenza sea-\nson. The static network approach is commonly used to model influenza epidemics\n[Miller (2009)]. Finally, we investigated whether the transmission process is driven\npurely by the friendship structure by implementing a friendship-only model, in\nwhich students only contact their friends. We calibrated the friendship-only model\nso that the expected total number of contacts in all models is the same. Compar-\nison to this model will reveal whether the additional network structure we added,\nincluding a proportion of contacts to nonfriends, variation in contact degree and\nclassroom structure, has an impact on epidemic predictions.\nWe simulated 500 epidemics over each of these three models using the natural\nhistory of influenza described above. Epidemic outcomes, displayed in Figure 3,\nare essentially identical in the static and dynamic contact network models. A sim-\nilar result was found in a different setting by Stehl\u00e9 et al. (2011b). This is because\nour dynamic model creates a sequence of highly correlated contact networks. Al-\nthough break/lunch contact networks are sampled independently from one day to\nthe next, these networks are dependent because they rely on the same underly-\ning friendship network, which stays the same for the whole influenza season. We\nfound that most contacts which change status from on to off or vice versa are\nonly 10 minutes in duration. These dynamics do little, if anything, to shift the\ncourse of the epidemic. The friendship-only model behaves quite differently. The\nfriendship-only model is oversimplified, and the additional network structure of\nFIG. 3. Comparison of epidemic outcomes for three different contact network models, based on\n500 simulated epidemics for each contact network model.\nclassroom contacts and distribution of nonfriend contacts creates a more realistic\nmodel. Therefore, we selected the static network model for our final model.\n3.7. Modeling the friendship network. Our contact network model described\nabove is conditional on the empirical friendship network. To generalize our model,\nwe need to model the friendship network itself; we do so using an exponential\nfamily random graph model (ERGM). We represent the friendship network by a\nsociomatrix Y. An ERGM models the sociomatrix for a network of fixed size as\nfollows:\nP(Y = y|) =\ne k\nT g(y)\n(Y)\n.\nHere, Y denotes the space of all possible networks of this size, and (Y) is a nor-\nmalizing constant which ensures that the probability distribution sums to 1.  is a\nvector of parameters, and g(y) is a vector of network statistics, such as the num-\nber of edges between actors of the same race, the number of triangles or others.\nThese statistics capture social principles such as the tendency to befriend others\nwith like attributes or transitivity. A dyad-independent ERGM is a model in which\nthe probability of observing an edge on one dyad is independent of the probability\nof observing an edge on other dyads (although it may depend on individual-level\nand dyadic attributes). The parameter estimates are obtained by their maximum\nlikelihood estimates (MLE). In many cases there is no analytic form for the nor-\nmalizing constant (Y), which is difficult to approximate because of the large\nnumber of possible networks for an undirected network. Instead the MLE is ap-\nproximated through a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure described by Geyer\nand Thompson (1992). However, a dyad-independent ERGM may be estimated\nwith logistic regression rather than the MCMC procedure.\n3.7.1. Model selection. Our model is based on the work of Goodreau, Kitts\nand Morris (2009), who use exponential random graph models to describe friend-\nship patterns in all 80 schools in the Add Health data set. The authors model the\nnetwork of mutual friendship nominations for each school. Their model includes\nsociality terms for each grade, race and gender, selective mixing by race, grade and\ngender, and a transitivity term which captures the tendency of friends of friends to\nalso be friends, conditional on other terms in the model. Our ERGM includes these\neffects minus the transitivity term, so is slightly simpler, although we also included\na school mixing effect.\nTable 1 shows coefficient estimates for our model. The sociality terms capture\nwhether 8th graders form larger numbers of friendships, on average, than seventh\ngraders (the reference category for grade), etc. These terms are interpreted as fol-\nlows: a friendship is exp(0.54) = 1.71 times more likely to occur from a randomly\nchosen person to an eighth grader than to a seventh grader, assuming that the eighth\ngrader and seventh grader are identical on other attributes included in the model.\nOther sociality terms are interpreted similarly. We see, for example, that eighth\ngraders are significantly more social than seventh graders, but twelfth graders are\nnot. Mixing coefficients represent the tendency to form friendships with others\nwho have the same attributes as oneself; these are interpreted as follows: a friend-\nship between two seventh graders is exp(2.3) = 9.9 times more likely to occur\nthan a friendship between two students in different grades, all other attributes be-\ning equal. The coefficient is - for the race missing category because there are\nno friendships among this very small (n = 11) group of students.\nWe assessed whether our model captures the relevant network structures by sim-\nulating friendship networks from our estimated model parameters, simulating con-\ntact networks based on the simulated friendship data (as described in Sections\nworks (as described in Section 3.5). If our friendship model is adequate, epidemic\noutcomes from these simulations should resemble those estimated in simulations\nCoefficient estimates for Exponential Family Random Graph Model (ERGM) fitted to the Add\nHealth friendship network.

We performed this procedure for three\ndifferent simulated networks from our ERGM.\n3.8. Methodology to compare contact network model to random mixing. We\nsimulated influenza epidemics over the static contact network model and compared\nthem to simulations over a random mixing scenario. We calibrated the random\nmixing model so that the expected number of people contacted per student per day\nis the same as in the friendship-based model (36), and the duration of contact is\nequal to the average duration of contacts in the friendship-based model (41 min-\nutes).\nWe first simulated epidemics with no intervention. Then we simulated a reac-\ntive grade closure intervention, in which the entire grade of a student manifesting\ninfluenza symptoms is closed one day after detection of symptoms. Next, we in-\nvestigated the impact of network structure on the estimated effect of a targeted\nantiviral prophylaxis (TAP) strategy. Under this strategy, all symptomatic people\nare given five days of antiviral treatment, and their contacts are given ten days\nof antiviral prophylaxis, starting the day after symptoms appear. Based on esti-\nmates by Halloran et al. (2007), we assume an antiviral efficacy against suscepti-\nbility (AVES) of 63%, antiviral efficacy against infectiousness (AVEI ) of 15%, and\nantiviral efficacy against pathogenicity (AVEP ) of 56%. Thus, the probability of\ngetting infected during one contact is reduced by a factor of 1 - AVES\nthe susceptible person is receiving prophylaxis, and further reduced by a factor of\n= 0.85 if the infectious person is receiving antiviral treatment. Treated\npeople are 1 - AVEP\n= 0.44 times less likely to become symptomatic than un-\ntreated people.\n4. Results. Figure 4 compares epidemic outcomes for simulations based on\nthe empirical friendship network to those based on the simulated friendship net-\nwork. The results are nearly identical, indicating that our estimated friendship net-\nwork model captures the network structures relevant for disease transmission. We\ndisplay epidemic outcomes for transmission probabilities in range displaying a\nbroad spectrum of epidemic possibilities: 0.001 to 0.007. Transmission probabil-\nities smaller than 0.002 were too small to produce epidemics, so the probability\nof epidemic is zero for that range, while estimated final size and peak date are\nnegligible compared to estimates for larger transmission probabilities. The error\nbars in all plots in this section depict uncertainty arising both from estimation of\nparameter inputs to our model, as well as from the simulations. In most cases, the\nwidth of the error bar is smaller than the plotting symbol.\nFigure 5 compares epidemic outcomes for simulations over the static contact\nnetwork model to those from simulations performed over a random mixing sce-\nnario. The estimated probability of epidemic and final size are smaller in the con-\ntact network model than in a random mixing model. The repetition in contacts in\nour network model reduces the pool of susceptibles accessible to an infected per-\nson, who continues to contact people he/she has already infected. The transitivity\npresent in friendship patterns further limits the potential for disease spread. Friends\nare likely to have mutual friends, so the set of susceptible friends of an infected\nperson is reduced by transmission from other mutual friends. Figure 5 also shows\nthe estimated peak date of the disease season: the day with the largest number\nof infected students. For probabilities of transmission under 0.0035, the epidemic\npeaks sooner under the network model; for higher probabilities of transmission, the\nepidemic peaks later. The threshold value occurs because the relationship between\npeak date and transmission probability is confounded by final size. The plot of\npeak date by final size shows that the network model peaks later for all final sizes\nFIG. 4.

The spread of the virus is slowed by the clustering\nand repetition in contacts in the network model.\nThe top row of Figure 6 shows the estimated probability of an epidemic with tar-\ngeted antiviral prophylaxis intervention under the network model and the random\nmixing model and the change in estimated probability of epidemic under both sce-\nnarios.These plots describe the estimated effectiveness of this intervention for con-\ntaining the epidemic. Under both scenarios, the probability of epidemic is reduced\nto zero for transmission probabilities under 0.0035. If we were using either model\nfor prediction, the right-hand plot would be the relevant one, and for this range\nof transmission probabilities, random mixing estimates a larger improvement than\nthe network model. For example, when the transmission probability is 0.003, ran-\ndom mixing estimates a reduction of 0.30 in probability of epidemic, while the\nnetwork model estimates this reduction to be 0.13. At transmission probabilities\nabove 0.0035, the estimated probability of epidemic is higher under the random\nmixing model than the network model. This strategy is more effective under the\nFIG. 5. Comparison of epidemic outcomes from simulations over the static contact network model\nto those assuming random mixing.\nnetwork model because the people prioritized for prophylaxis are those who are\nrepeatedly exposed through daily contact to infectious individuals. In the random\nmixing model, the contacts of an infectious person on one day are unrelated to his\ncontacts on the following day, so the prioritization of antiviral to contacts has no\neffect.\nThe second row of Figure 6 shows a similar pattern with final size, but with a\nthreshold value of 0.005 instead of 0.004. The third row shows substantial differ-\nences in peak date predictions between the two models. A delay in peak date helps\nthe public health department develop a response to the epidemic. However, the\nepidemic peaks earlier with the intervention under both scenarios. This is because\nthe relationship between peak date and transmission probability is confounded by\nfinal size; both interventions reduce the final size drastically, so the (much smaller)\npeak occurs sooner.\nFIG. 6. Estimated effect of targeted antiviral prophylaxis (TAP) intervention on probability of epi-\ndemic, final size and epidemic peak date under the static contact network model compared to random\nmixing.\nIn simulating the TAP intervention, we distributed antiviral prophylaxis to all\n(100%) contacts of symptomatic students, thus assuming that symptomatic stu-\ndents would accurately recall and report 100% of the students they contacted on\ntheir first day of symptom onset. In reality, students may recall only a subset of the\npeople they contacted on their first symptomatic day. To assess the impact of this\nassumption, we repeated the analyses assuming that students reported only 90%\nof contacts, and again assuming that they reported only 75% of contacts. These\nresults are included in the supplementary material [Potter et al. (2011c)]. These\ndifferent scenarios only slightly shifted the results, maintaining our qualitative and\nquantitative findings.\nThe first row of Figure 7 shows that under both models the grade closure strat-\negy reduces the probability of epidemic to zero for all transmission probabilities.\nSince grade closure is expensive on a societal level, our model could be used to\nperform cost-effectiveness strategies, where the cost of grade closure is weighed\nagainst the severity of the influenza strain and its societal impact. The right-hand\nplot in the second row of Figure 7 shows that if we were willing to use grade\nclosure once the reduction in probability of epidemic exceeded a threshold value\n(e.g., 0.20), the cutoff transmission probability would be different under the two\nmodels. The third row shows differences in peak date predictions under the grade\nclosure strategy.\n5. Discussion. Our work in this paper yields three broad findings. First, our\nrealistic, data-driven contact network model produces substantially different esti-\nmates of epidemic outcomes and intervention effectiveness than a random mixing\nscenario, and the differences vary by transmission probability. Second, we found\nevidence that in a high school setting, a static contact model is sufficient to char-\nacterize epidemic progress. However, our dynamics in contact behavior occurred\nonly during class breaks, so relied on the assumptions that within-classroom seat-\ning configurations are constant over time and that interaction occurs only with\none's immediate class neighbors within each class. We recommend collecting dy-\nnamic contact data and further investigating the hypothesis that dynamic networks\nand static networks produce similar epidemic predictions. Once dynamic, within-\nclass contact reports are obtained, we can integrate this information into our model\nand test our hypothesis that a static contact network adequately represents the con-\ntact behavior relevant for epidemic predictions. Third, a dyad-independent ERGM\nadequately captures the friendship network structure relevant to the disease trans-\nmission process. The dyad-independent model is advantageous, as its parameters\ncan be estimated with logistic regression instead of relying on MCMC. Another\nadvantage of this model is that the probability of friendship depends only on\nindividual-level attributes, so survey data on attributes of respondents and their\nfriends is sufficient to characterize the network.\nOur model stands out from other epidemic simulation models for three reasons.\nFirst, we infer the contact network using contact survey reports, while others are\nFIG. 7. Estimated effect of reactive grade closure intervention on probability of epidemic, final size\nand epidemic peak date under the static contact network model compared to random mixing.\nnot informed by contact surveys. Second, we quantify uncertainty in predictions\narising from uncertainty in estimates of inputs to our model; this is not standard\nin the field. Third, we validated our model by comparing the fitted degree distri-\nbution to reports in an alternate data source and by comparing joint and marginal\ndistributions of variables of contact networks simulated from our model to those\nin one of our data sources, the epidemic survey.\nOur work has several limitations. First, we have modeled contact and transmis-\nsion patterns in a single high school. The friendship patterns in this high school\nmay be different from those in other high schools, especially schools of different\nsizes and racial compositions. We hypothesize that in schools with different friend-\nship structure, our key findings that a dyad-independent ERGM is sufficient and\nthat a static contact model is adequate will still hold.\nAnother limitation of our work is that we have treated the Add Health friend-\nship data as complete rather than attempting to model the unobserved friendship\nties. Demographic information is unavailable for nonrespondent students, and dif-\nferences in demographics between respondents and nonrespondents have not been\nstudied. Gile and Handcock (2006) compared network characteristics of respon-\ndents to nonrespondents in a different Add Health school, and found slight differ-\nences, for example, that respondents received more friendship nominations than\nnonrespondents. We found this pattern to hold in our school as well: respon-\ndents received an average of 4.9 nominations while the mean for nonrespondents\nwas 3.5. However, if nonrespondents are more likely to nominate other nonrespon-\ndents than respondents as best friends, then the true means are closer together. Our\nwork could be extended by imputing demographics for nonrespondent students\nand maximizing the likelihood obtained by summing over all possible values for\nthe missing edges [Handcock and Gile (2010)]. We consider our partially observed\nfriendship network to be a realistic representation of a possible friendship network\nand believe that correcting for missing edges and attributes would only slightly im-\npact our friendship network estimates and would not substantively impact our epi-\ndemic outcome estimates. Our main finding that a friendship-based contact model\ngives rise to different estimates of epidemic outcomes than a random mixing sce-\nnario is likely to hold with the complete friendship network.\nBecause Add Health respondents were limited to nomination of 5 friends of\neach sex, there is truncation bias in the numbers of friends in the friendship net-\nwork. In this school, 86% of respondents reported fewer than 5 best male friends,\n79% reported fewer than 5 best female friends and 95% reported fewer than 10\nbest friends, so truncation bias is relatively small. Students were instructed to list\ntheir friends in order of closeness, so friendships that were truncated are less close\nthan the included ones. Moreover, by including nominators of each respondent as\nfriends even if they were not themselves nominated by the respondent, we may\nhave reduced the truncation bias. Because this definition of friendship creates a\ndegree distribution similar to that collected in the epidemic survey, which had no\ntruncation mechanism (see Figure 1), we expect any bias arising from the trun-\ncation in Add Health friendship reports to have minimal, if any, impact on our\nresults.\nReports in the epidemic survey are subject to a potentially high degree of\nmeasurement error because students were asked to estimate their average con-\ntact behavior. We contrast this survey design to the POLYMOD study, in which\nrespondents were mailed paper diaries and instructed to carry them throughout\na 24-hour period and record characteristics of each contact they made [Mossong\net al. (2008)]. We recommend a within-school POLYMOD type survey in which\nthe students identify their contacts from a school roster. We could directly model\nthe contact network from such a data set without inclusion of the friendship net-\nwork information. We believe that our model is the most realistic possible with\nthe available data, and the extent of measurement error is impossible to determine\nwithout further studies. Proximity sensor data would also be less prone to mea-\nsurement error and can be used to characterize networks as in Stehl\u00e9 et al. (2011a).\nAnother limitation of our model is that we did not incorporate data on classroom\ncontacts but rather created a model based on assumptions about within-classroom\ncontact behavior. A better understanding of classroom contacts could be obtained\nby the POLYMOD-type within-school survey described above, in which respon-\ndents include the time of day and whether the contact occurs within a class. Further\nlimitations include our assumptions of perfect observation of symptoms and per-\nfect reporting of contact behavior during the targeted antiviral prophylaxis strategy,\nbut sensitivity analysis demonstrated the latter assumption to have little effect.\nWe have modeled within-school contacts only. In reality, friends and classmates\nalso contact each other outside the school. We intend to expand our school model to\ninclude all contacts between students in the school occurring in all locations. The\nmodel we presented here is a natural first step in building the expanded model.\nWe have developed a detailed, data-driven model of within-school social contact\nbehavior. We demonstrated that our network model predicts different epidemic\nprogress and intervention effectiveness than random mixing, and we identified key\nnetwork structures influencing the transmission process. We recommend further\nexploration into how network structures influence the disease transmission process\nwith the aim of integrating network structure into epidemic models and simulators.\n"
