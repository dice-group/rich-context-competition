Linder, MD, MPH, FACP\nDivision of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.\nJ Gen Intern Med\n\u00a9 Society of General Internal Medicine 2015\nR etail clinics, which are usually located inside retail phar-\nmacies, provide walk-in care mainly for low-acuity prob-\nlems. Retail clinics have transparent pricing and are staffed by\nnurse practitioners or physician assistants. Since first opening\nin the United States in 2000, retail clinic use has grown rapidly\nbut remains small: the proportion of families that reported\nusing a retail clinic in the prior year increased from 1 % in\nlow-cost, accessible sites of care.\nMuch has been written about the potential promises and\nperils of retail clinics.2\u00ad4 For privately insured, healthy,\nwealthy, young patients, retail clinics likely provide similar\nquality and lower cost compared to primary care offices for\notitis media, pharyngitis, and urinary tract infections without\ndetracting from short-term preventive care.5 Antibiotic pre-\nscribing is more guideline-concordant at retail clinics than in\nprimary care offices or emergency departments.6,7 Retail\nclinics may be associated with reduced costs.8 On the other\nhand, retail clinics have been found to impair continuity and to\nreduce seeking care with a primary care practice when a new\nproblem arises.9 Little is known regarding retail clinic perfor-\nmance for underserved, older, sicker patient populations.\nRetail clinics strive to provide fast access for patients, and\nare themselves experimenting with new models of care to\nimprove their service. In this issue of the Journal of General\nInternal Medicine, Polinski and colleagues from CVS\nMinuteClinic describe a cross-sectional quality improvement\nassessment of retail clinic-based telehealth.10 Patients with\nspecific symptoms, mostly acute respiratory infections, who\nmight have to wait for an in-person practitioner for more than\n20 minutes, were given the option to have their care provided\nby a remote practitioner assisted by an onsite nurse.\nThe authors estimated that 40 to 54 % of telehealth patients\ncompleted a post-visit survey (n=1734). Respondents were\nmostly insured (80 %), female (70 %), and had a primary care\nprovider (59 %). For half, it was their first visit to a\nMinuteClinic. Thirty-two percent of respondents expressed a\npreference for receiving care via telehealth versus a\n\"traditional in-person visit.\" The vast majority of users were\nhighly satisfied with nearly all attributes of their experience.\nRespondents who lacked health insurance were significantly\nmore likely to prefer telehealth visits. Women, those who\nbelieved they had a good understanding of telehealth, and\nthose who were satisfied with the convenience of telehealth\nall had higher odds of liking telehealth. Over 70 % of respon-\ndents would use telehealth again and would recommend\ntelehealth to someone else.\nPolinski and colleagues should be congratulated for study-\ning an innovative approach to improving low-acuity care\ndelivery. A virtual network of clinicians who need only the\nassistance of a nurse assistant and specialized internet-\nconnected tools could represent an improvement on an\nexpanding model of care.\nYet this study highlights a concern about retail clinics: they\ncreate demand for unnecessary services. Telehealth facilitated\nvisits for sinusitis, upper respiratory infections, bronchitis,\nallergic rhinitis, influenza, and conjunctivitis. These visits\nmay be unnecessary and have the potential to stimulate un-\nnecessary follow-up care.3 Retail clinics currently have no\nincentive to discourage unnecessary care. In fact, retail clinics\nmay view these visits as easy, quick, and desirable and might\nfear that patients would leave if kept waiting for too long.\nGood continuity of care and effective pre-visit triage could\nhave prevented many of these visits.\nIn a perfect world, all patients would have a usual source of\ncare; be able to easily connect with their own primary care\npractice; receive triage advice; and practices would provide\nprompt, efficient advice and service. Comprehensive primary\ncare is associated with lower cost, improved health outcomes,\ngreater efficiency, and reduced disparities. All else being\nequal, patients would choose to get care from a primary care\npractice that knows them, is easily accessed, and will follow\nthem over time.\nClearly, we do not live in that world. Primary care is not\noptimally structured or incentivized to provide accessible care.\nAccording to the Commonwealth Fund, 73 % of Americans\nresponded that it was difficult to make timely doctors' ap-\npointments, get phone advice, or receive after-hours care\nwithout having to visit the emergency room. Retail clinics,\nurgent care centers, and commercial online care are all under-\nstandable responses to primary care that is inefficient, costly,\nand inaccessible. These new models of care reflect the failure\nof primary care to provide access.\nThose of us in primary care should take note. CVS\nMinuteClinic feels that 20 minutes is too long to wait. They\nare innovating to increase access. Can primary care practices\nstand the harsh light shone by this delivery innovation? Can\nprimary care practices learn, innovate, and radically improve\naccess?\nRadical improvement in access must be accompanied by\nradically improved efficiency. If a transaction presently takes\nplace on paper or over the phone, we need to automate it when\npossible, switch it to the web, and optimize it for mobile. We\nneed to move most communication to secure, usable web\nportals that are aggressively promoted and monitored. We\nneed to provide chronic disease management through a com-\nbination of registry analytics, group visits, community health\nworkers, synchronous and asynchronous e-visits, and tradi-\ntional in-person visits. For our high-utilizer and homebound\npatients, we need to make house calls, a practice we gave up\nonly due to now-archaic financial and technological con-\nstraints. A single urgent care episode should be able to seam-\nlessly and promptly be transformed, as needed, from an asyn-\nchronous e-visit to a synchronous e-visit to an in-person visit\nwith the primary care practice or involvement of an emergency\ndepartment. Illness does not end for patients when they hang\nup the phone or walk out of the office; care should not stop\nwhen clinicians sign their notes. Practices should provide\nextended and weekend hours. Improved access and efficiency\nshould improve the patient experience. Visits in which either\nthe patient thought it was a \"waste of time\" or clinicians felt\n\"the patient didn't really need to come in for that\" should be\nviewed as triage failures.\nPrimary care physicians' days should look radically differ-\nent. Although there is simplicity and comfort in seeing patients\nin-person, one-after-another, it is inefficient for the physician,\nthe practice, and the patient. We can connect with many more\nof our patients if we are spending more of our time not seeing\nour patients in person. There will be more structured e-visits to\nreview, video calls to make, teams to facilitate, and panels to\nmanage with proactive outreach and follow-up.\nThere has been progress and new resources are available.\nMany health systems schedule phone visits and \"desktop\ntime.\" The American Medical Association's stepsforward.org\nand UCSF's Center for Excellence in Primary Care both have\nturn-key approaches to optimizing the busy primary care\npractice. They describe pre-visit laboratory testing, synchro-\nnized prescription renewal, team documentation, and panel\nmanagement techniques. Despite these and others, additional\ninnovation is sorely needed.\nHow will we pay for these changes? Health systems' in-\ncentives to support these innovations are becoming aligned\nwith the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion\nof Accountable Care Organizations. Medicare has already\nmoved this direction with the Chronic Care Management\nProgram. Many private insurers, recognizing value and patient\ndemand, are moving to cover innovative care.\nThere will be plenty of practice innovations to implement,\nresearch to be done, and questions to ask. Can we deliver care\nthat is equally effective over the internet as in-person? What is\nthe optimal telehealth configuration? What is the ideal level of\ncontinuity that balances efficiency with outcomes and patient\nexperience? Are there subgroups of patients who benefit most\nfrom telehealth treatment? Are there subgroups of patients\nwho might potentially be left behind such as the underserved,\nelderly, and sickest? We need to demonstrate that new, proac-\ntive methods of delivering care can benefit our most vulnera-\nble patients.\nPrimary care practices and clinicians should view visits to\nemergency departments, retail clinics, or urgent care centers as\nsentinel events. What was it about our own practice that made\nseeking care away from primary care necessary? Viewed from\na more global, financial perspective--and to paraphrase\nRushika Fernandopulle of Iora Health--primary care accounts\nfor 4 % of healthcare spending in the United States; how much\nof the remaining 96 % represents a failure of primary care?\nWhat would primary care look like if it received 10 % of\nspending?\nUltimately, we look forward to the implementation of\nmodels with radically improved efficiency and access that\ncould realize the benefits of comprehensive primary care. We\ndo not begrudge the existence of retail clinics, urgent care\nclinics, or online care companies. They shine a harsh light\non primary care's failings. We should look where that light\nshines brightest and innovate toward doing better for patients.\nCorresponding Author: Jeffrey A.
