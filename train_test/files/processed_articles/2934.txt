Introduction\nOriginally, households have been seen as acting economically as a single unit. This unitary\nmodel, implying a single decision making process among the individual household members,\nwas applied for the analysis of household decisions ranging from labor supply to overall\nhousehold savings. However, in the last years this simplifying approach has been questioned\nand disproved by many researchers (for example Vermeulen (2005), Attanasio and Lechene\n(2002) and Browning (1995), just to name some of them), because it neglects individual\npreferences almost completely. Alternative approaches have been proposed, recognizing\nhousehold behavior as a result of a decision-making process reflecting different preferences\namong the household members. These collective approaches can be further divided into\ncooperative and non-cooperative models. In the first, spouses negotiate decisions taking each\nother's preferences into account. In the second, each household member takes the other\nmembers` behavior as given and maximizes his/her own utility.1 While the collective model\nhas been confirmed in a number of studies with respect to the labor supply decision at the\nextensive as well as the intensive margin,2 evidence for the household decision-making process\nwith respect to savings is scarce.3 This may result from the fact that information on household\nsavings largely originates from panel surveys, only measuring overall household savings. With\ndata on individual retirement savings at hand, we will analyze the intra-household allocation of\nretirement savings from a cross-sectional perspective, modelling each spouses decision\nseparately but allowing for mutual endogeneity at the same time. The question to be answered\nin this article is not a theoretical one but a somewhat more empirical one. How does the intra-\n1 For a more detailed overview on the different household models see e.g. Garcia et al. (2010) and for an\noverview on different collective models see Vermeulen (2002).\n3 Browning (1995) found that with a higher share of the wife in household income the total household saving rate\ndeclines. By contrast, Lee and Pocock (2007) conclude for South Korea that an increasing share of the wife's\nrelative earnings leads to increasing total household savings. Lee and Pocock (2007) are to our knowledge the\nfirst to explicitly model and analyze the allocation of financial resources between spouses. Grabka et al. (2015)\nexamined the distribution of wealth between couples in Germany, concluding that the intra-household wealth\ngap declines with the female taking financial decisions.\nhousehold allocation of retirement savings look like? And how are the spouse's savings related\nto each other? Does one spouse decrease savings if the other one saves more if controlled for\ncommon household statistics? Or does the other spouse also increase savings due to some\nrecognition or peer effect? Given that some retirement savings are saved by the aggregate\nhousehold by definition (e.g. real estate), we focus on saving accounts usually used to save for\nold-age reasons which can ultimately be attributed to a specific household member. In order to\nstudy the interaction between household members with regard to retirement savings in\nGermany, we use the Panel on Household Finances (PHF) provided by the Bundesbank. This\ndata set allows us to analyze individual savings and simultaneously to consider the overall\nhousehold situation as well as the partner's or spouse's retirement savings. The remainder of\nthis article is structured as follows. First, the dataset is described in section 2.1. followed by the\noutlining of the empirical strategy in section 2.2.. After showing some descriptive statistics, the\nmultivariate analysis with respect to the saving decision (section 3.2.) and saving amount\n(section 3.3.) is presented, followed by some robustness analysis in section 3.4.. The article\nfinishes summarizing the results and presenting implications for further research.\n2. Data and empirical strategy\n2.1. The PHF dataset\nThe following analysis is based on the newly introduced \"Panel on Household finances\" (PHF)\nin Germany.4 The PHF, conducted by the Bundesbank, is part of the Eurosystem's \"Household\nFinance and Consumption Survey\" (HFCS). In addition to the common European-wide\nquestionnaire covering questions on household finance, wealth and consumption, the PHF puts\nspecial emphasis on two further topics, namely savings and old-age provision. Therefore,\n4 For more detailed information about the PHF see\nhttp://www.bundesbank.de/Navigation/EN/Bundesbank/Research_centre/Panel_on_household_finances/panel_o\nn_household_finances.html\ndetailed information on an individual level is collected through different types of saving\nvehicles, as well as financial assets. This information is of special interest as it enables the\nanalysis of savings specially linked to old-age pension provision. Besides information about\nindividual retirement savings, the PHF also includes detailed household characteristics e.g.\nhousehold net income, children, etc. This rare combination allows us to analyze the interaction\nbetween the retirement savings of spouses within the household context. The survey is designed\nto be a full panel with a survey frequency of three years. So far, two waves have been conducted\nThe problem of missing data caused by item non-response, generally present with surveys about\nfinancial data, was coped with by using multiple imputation (m=5) to fill these missing values\nand simultaneously considering the uncertainty of these imputations. Leading to five imputed\ndatasets this has to be considered while analyzing the data.5 However, for the purpose of\nanalyzing the interaction between spouses, we refrain from using the imputed observations and\nstick to the original values, as the imputation procedure could eventually impose own\nassumptions about the correlation between the spouses' savings in retirement accounts.\n2.2. Empirical Strategy\nIn general, all saving vehicles can be used to transfer present income to the own retirement\nperiod as e.g. saving accounts, private pension insurance, cash value life insurance, stocks, real\nestate etc. However, the saving reason cannot always be clearly distinguished. As this article\nputs special emphasis on retirement savings, only vehicles, which are directly linked to\nretirement, are analyzed in the following sections. These vehicles consist of state-subsidized\nprivate pension contracts (Riester or R\u00fcrup pensions),6 all kinds of voluntary occupational\n5 For further information about the multiple imputation procedure in the PHF dataset and the appropriate analysis\n6 To facilitate the following sections, the term Riester pension will refer to both Riester as well as R\u00fcrup pension\nplans, because they are not further distinguished in the dataset. R\u00fcrup pension or `Basis-Rente' refers to pension\nplans designed for self-employed individuals with tax-deductible contributions up to 22,172 Euros in 2015.\npension schemes, private non-subsidized pension insurances and cash value life insurance.7\nOccupational pensions of different types are summarized with the exception of direct pension\ninsurances financed by the employer. As the decision for this type of occupational pension, as\nwell as the contributions are made by the employer and not the employee, it can be regarded\nrather as employer saving than as individual rational decision.\nThe research question raised in this article is whether households act as a unit when it comes to\nretirement savings or whether these decisions are made independently on an individual level. If\nboth partners jointly determine their retirement savings, as proposed by the unitary model, one\ncould expect that due to transaction costs retirement savings would not be split up between the\nspouses. More precisely, one spouse makes a saving contract for the total household, what could\nbe the case for example for cash value life insurances. However, due to subsidies or tax\nexemptions for some contracts (Riester or occupational pension contracts), it could also be\nrationale to split the savings between both spouses in order to maximize overall public subsidies\nif the maximum subsidy or tax exemption is already reached by one spouse. In these cases both\nspouses' savings would act as close substitutes and hence one would expect the savings of one\nspouse to crowd out the savings of the other spouse holding all other factors constant.\nOn the contrary, one could also think of a \"crowding-in\" of retirement savings among both\nspouses due to the so called \"recognition effect\" introduced by Cagan (1965). The reasoning\nbehind is an increasing awareness of the need for additional savings as one spouse starts to save\nfor retirement.8 This effect could further be enhanced by the fact that if one spouse decides to\n7 This approach has the disadvantage of neglecting other saving instruments for retirement, especially\ninvestments in real estate, which constitutes a relevant part of private household wealth (see e.g. Grabka and\nWestermeier (2014), p. 159). However, with regard to the question of the interaction of individual retirement\nsavings within a household, savings in real estate become irrelevant as these savings are usually determined only\non the household level.\n8 For example B\u00f6rsch-Supan et al. (2012) found a positive correlation between the possession of an occupational\npension plan and a subsidized Riester or unsubsidized private pension plan for German households.\nmake a saving contract, the other spouse might get in touch with a financial advisor as well.9\nThus, this \"recognition effect\" could also be labelled as a peer effect. As mentioned earlier, the\npossession of retirement saving contracts of both spouses does however not necessarily mean a\n\"crowding-in\" of retirement savings, but could also be owed to tax reasons. For a \"crowding-\nin\" to exist, we would additionally have to observe a positive correlation between each spouse's\nsavings.\nHence, we apply a two-stage estimation procedure in order to analyze the intra-household\ncomposition of voluntary retirement savings for both the extensive margin (decision to save)\nand the intensive margin (amount being saved) of retirement savings. In the first stage we\nanalyze the saving decision measured by a dummy variable equaling one if the individual is\nsaving for retirement. Considering the possibility of mutual dependence between each spouse's\ndecisions (correlated error terms), either positive in the case of a \"crowding-in\" of saving\naccounts or negative for a \"crowding-out\" as implied by the basic unitary model, we estimate\nboth decisions simultaneously using a bivariate probit model. Both spouses share a common set\nof household variables (e.g. household income, children, real estate property) while they differ\nwith respect to their individual educational and labor market characteristics. Thus, we estimate\na seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model based on each spouses' individual Xind\ni as well as\ncommon household socio-economic characteristics XHH as shown in Equation 1.10 The mutual\ndependence of the error terms is reflected by the coefficient of  (rho).\n Xind\n+ A \n\n Xind\n+ B \n(A, B) = \n9 Pfarr and Schneider (2011) show for Germany that being in contact with a financial advisor increases the\nprobability to possess a Riester pension contract as a sort of supplier-induced demand.\n10 For an overview on the detailed methodology of bivariate probit models see Greene (2003), section 21.6.\nThe set of individual socio-demographic variables comprise of age, age squared, a dummy for\nEastern Germany, a dummy for an immigrant background11,whether the individual is married\nor not and dummy variables covering various degrees of education. The set of labor market\ncharacteristics covers variables for gross income (gross income, gross income squared), type of\nemployment (e.g. unemployed, civil servant, self-employed with or without employees),\nemployment situation (full-time, part-time, marginally or fixed-term employed etc.) and a set\nof dummies covering the sector of employment12.\nLabor market characteristics first determine the need for additional retirement savings. For\nexample civil-servants are members of a generous defined benefit system and thus do not need\nto save using retirement saving accounts but can also use other more flexible saving vehicles.\nOn the contrary, for self-employed persons insurance in the statutory pension scheme is non-\nmandatory, hence they have an additional demand for retirement saving accounts.\nHaving analyzed whether the decision to save at all is influenced by the partner's decision, we\nturn our attention in the second stage to the question whether also the amount being saved is\ninfluenced by the spouse's savings or not. This question is equal to asking whether the unitary\nmodel is appropriate with regard to retirement savings or not. An observed \"crowding-out\"\nbetween the spouse's saving amounts could be interpreted in favor of income pooling or the\nunitary model or at least the collective model, whereas an observed \"crowding-in\" or no\nobserved endogeneity would present weak evidence for a more or less individual decision-\nmaking process. Hence, we estimate the following set of equations (Eq. 2), where log \ndenotes the logarithm of the yearly retirement savings of individual A, X\n is representing a\nvector of socio-economic variables of the same individual as e.g. demographics, labor market\n11 Individuals are defined as having an immigrant background if they either do not have a German citizenship or\nreceived it sometime after birth.\n12 The sector of employment probably plays a crucial role for the possession of an occupational pension plan as\nthese pension plans are more commonly offered in some sectors than in others although every person has a legal\nentitlement at least for an occupational pension plan financed through deferred compensation.\ncharacteristics etc. and X is representing the common set of household characteristics. The\nrespective error terms are denoted by  and  which are not restricted to be independent of\neach other.\n+ Xind\n log sB + A\nlog sB = 0\n+ Xind\n log sA + B\nThese equations can be regarded as being determined simultaneously and hence the partner's\nsavings must be treated as endogenous variables. Considering this mutual endogeneity, we\nestimate the coefficients of this set of equations using three-stage least squares.13\nThree-stage least squares (3SLS) presents an extension of two-stage least squares and allows\nfor mutual dependence of the error terms between both equations. It combines two-stage least\nsquares estimates with a correction for the mutual dependence. The first two steps consist of\ntwo-stage least squares estimations of each single equation and the estimation of the covariance\nmatrix of the error terms in the system of equations. In the last stage these estimates are used\nto compute the Generalized least squares (GLS) estimator of the system.\nWhy to use the logarithm of savings and not nominal savings? Using the log of retirement\nsavings has two relevant properties. Given the lognormal distribution of individual savings,\ncoefficients are biased if we use the nominal values. Additionally, it restricts the analysis to\nhouseholds with both spouses saving. Analyzing the existence of either a \"crowding-in\" or a\n\"crowding-out\" of retirement savings between spouses, using observations with only one\nperson saving would be unrewarding.\n13 For the exact properties of the three-stage least squares method see Wooldridge (2010), Chapter 8.\n3. Results\nIn this section, the empirical estimates are presented first for the intra-household allocation of\nvoluntary retirement saving accounts as well as for the corresponding saving amounts. With the\nfocus lying on saving for retirement, the further analysis is restricted to households consisting\nof individuals not receiving a pension yet, leaving us with 2251 households.14 In order to\nanalyze the allocation of saving amounts and whether a \"crowding-in\" of retirement savings, a\n\"crowding-out\" or none of both exists, we restrict the sample in the second step to 781\nhouseholds with both partners saving privately for retirement. In the multivariate analysis\nsections, all equations are estimated separately for male and female spouses, where the first\nequation or column always refers to the male spouse.\n3.1. Descriptive Statistics\nFirst, we present some descriptive statistics for the intra-household allocation of retirement\nsaving contracts and saving amounts.\nTable 1: Intra household distribution of saving accounts (in %)\nFemale saving\nNo Yes Total\nMale saving\nTable 1 shows, that 57.6 percent of all men possess a retirement saving contract whereas this\nfraction amounts to only 45.4 percent for their female partners. In 31.9 percent of all\nhouseholds, neither the head of household nor his/her partner is saving for retirement at all. In\n14 This set of households includes married couples (about 88 percent) as well as unmarried partners. The results\nof the following multivariate analyses have been carried out for the subsample of married couples and have\nproven robust.\nabout a third of all households, at least one partner has a retirement saving account, whereof\nabout 70 percent consist of households where only the male possesses a saving account. Finally,\nin 35 percent of households both partners have individual retirement saving contracts.\nLooking at the annual household retirement savings, it becomes obvious that households, where\nonly the male partner saves, are on average saving more than households where only the female\npartner possesses a saving account. This can probably be explained by the fact that males earn\na higher gross income than their female partners, on average (see Table 5 in the Appendix for\nsummary statistics of all other variables).\nTable 2: Average annual household retirement savings (in Euro)\nFemale saving\nNo Yes Total\nMale saving\nHouseholds with both partners saving, save on average more than just the average sum of both\ncases where only one partner is saving. One might be tempted to conclude that this provides\nevidence for a \"crowding-in\" of retirement savings among spouses, however, it could be the\ncase that households with both partners saving are earning a higher income and thus have higher\nsaving amounts.\nThe distribution of total household savings between spouses is shown in Figure 1 with respect\nto the man's share of aggregate household gross income. An increasing share of gross\nhousehold income earned by the man does not necessarily imply a one by one increase in the\nman's share of aggregate household retirement savings. Instead, only a significantly weaker\ncorrelation between gross income share and savings share is observable.\nFigure 1: Household saving and gross income distributions\nFrom Figure 2 in the Appendix it becomes obvious that patterns are different for unsubsidized\nand tax exempted saving vehicles. While for tax exempted and subsidized saving vehicles\n(Riester and occupational pension plans) the saving share clearly correlates to the share of gross\nincome, the saving share for unsubsidized contracts is nearly independent of the gross income\nshare.\nAfter these purely descriptive results, we will now turn our attention to the multivariate analysis\nfirst of the extensive and subsequently of the intensive margin of retirement savings, controlling\nfor all other possible influences.\n3.2. Intra-household distribution of saving accounts\nEstimating the intra-household allocation of retirement saving accounts as a first hint for the\nintra-household allocation of retirement savings, one has to consider the possibility of one\nspouse's decision to save privately for retirement not being independent of the other spouse's\ndecision. Therefore we estimate a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model for a dummy\nindicating the possession of retirement saving accounts, using individual socio-demographic\nand labor market variables as well as common household variables as explanatory variables.\nWith focus on the intra-household allocation of retirement savings, we are primarily interested\nin the estimated correlation of the error terms15, represented by  (rho) in Equation 1.16\nTable 3: Seemingly unrelated bivariate probit estimation for possession of a retirement\nsaving account\nSeemingly unrelated bivariate probit\nDependent variable: Possession of saving\naccount Male Female\n-\n15 One has to consider the possibility that correlated error terms might rather represent an ommitted variable bias\nthan correlated decisions. However, with our extensive set of explanatory variables we are confident that omitted\nvariable bias is hopefully negelectable here.\n16 For a detailed discussion on factors influencing the possession of a retirement savings contract, see Metzger\n-\n*\nSectoral dummies Yes Yes\nStandard errors in parentheses\nInterestingly, household equivalence net income17 is only a significant factor for the probability\nof the male spouse of possessing a saving account. Likewise, individual gross income is only\n17 The disposable household equivalence income is constructed from the disposable household income using the\nnew OECD scale of equivalence weights.\nweakly significant for the male partner. Surprisingly, for the female spouse neither individual\ngross income nor household equivalence income is significant. The positive and highly\nsignificant coefficient of rho provides evidence for the individual possession of a retirement\nsaving account being strongly correlated among partners even if controlled for both household\nand individual labor market characteristics. This \"crowding-in\" of saving contracts among\nhousehold members, also found by B\u00f6rsch-Supan et al. (2012) for German households\ngenerally, is probably due to some recognition effect or peer effect as discussed in section 2.2.\nHowever, this positive correlation might only be due to tax reasons and does not necessarily\nhave to increase household savings at all. For example Riester pension plans are subsidized via\na basic allowance of 154 Euro which is counted against the tax subsidy arising from the\nexemption of contributions to the Riester pension account. For a non-working spouse it might\nbe rationale to open up an own account in order to get the basic allowance by just paying the\nminimum annual contribution of 60 Euro. Additionally, for occupational as well as Riester\npension schemes there exists an upper ceiling of tax-deductible contributions. These ceilings\nmight provide incentives to split the household retirement savings between two contracts, if the\ntotal saving amount exceeds this ceiling, and thus may lead to a \"crowding-out\" of the other\nspouse's savings. Hence, in the next section we will turn our attention to the amount of\nretirement savings and whether there exists a \"crowding-in\" or \"crowding-out\" of retirement\nsavings among spouses.\n3.3. Crowding-in or crowding-out of spouse's retirement savings?\nIf saving amounts of the spouses and thus household retirement savings are simultaneously\ndetermined, both equations outlined in section 3.2. have to be estimated controlling for\nendogeneity. Thus we estimate the coefficients using the method of three-stage least squares.\nBeing interested in the effect of the spouse's savings on own savings only, we need to control\nfor all other possible influences carefully. Therefore, we include the same set of explanatory\nvariables used in the previous estimation of the intra-household allocation of retirement saving\ncontracts, as control variables. These control variables comprise of individual socio-\ndemographic and labor market characteristics including sectoral dummies as well as household\ncharacteristics, who all might have an influence on the savings amount. With the focus on\nstudying the interaction between the spouses' savings, we use the logarithm of retirement\nsavings, reducing the sample to 781 households with both spouses voluntarily saving for\nTable 4: Three-stage estimates for log savings\nThree-stage least squares\nDependent variable: log savings Male Female\n18 With not all couples being married, one could argue that saving behavior in non-married households differ\nfrom married households. Thus, we additionally estimated the model only with married households (about 89\npercent of the sample), which did not change the results.\nSectoral dummies Yes Yes\nStandard errors in parentheses\nMale spouses living in the Eastern part of Germany save significantly less than a comparable\nperson in the Western part. While for male spouses household net income plays a significant\nrole in determining retirement savings, for their female partners individual gross income seems\nto be more important. Self-employed persons seem to save more whereas unemployed persons\nand civil servants save less for retirement as one would have expected. Interestingly, education\nor especially schooling only seems to increase savings of the male spouse, whereas only the\ndummy for university entrance qualification is significant on a five percent significance level\nfor the female partner.\nControlling for all other variables potentially influencing the amount being saved, the\ncoefficient of our variable of interest, the logarithm of the other spouse's savings, is significant\nfor both spouses at the one percent significance level. The coefficient for the other spouse's\nsaving is fairly high for both spouses, with 0.431 for male and 0.356 for female spouses. With\nrespect to the dependent variable, the logarithm of savings, this coefficient can be interpreted\nas the elasticity of retirement savings with respect to the savings of the partner. An additional\nincrease of one percent in retirement savings of one spouse leads to an increase in savings of\nthe other spouse of 0.431 or 0.356 percent respectively. This result shows that neither are both\nsavings decisions independent of each other, nor does the spouse's retirement savings substitute\neach other. By contrast, there seems to exist a recognition or peer effect in savings also with\nrespect to the chosen saving amount.19\n3.4. Robustness analysis\nThe following section conducts several robustness checks for the previous results regarding the\ninteraction between the partners' saving amounts. First, as we have seen from the previous\nanalysis, saving patterns are different for self-employed and civil servants. Therefore, we\nestimate our simultaneous equations model excluding self-employed and civil servants, thus\nonly considering households consisting of employees and non-employed individuals. Using this\nsubsample, both spouses' savings still show positive and highly significant coefficients, as\nshown in Table 6 in the Appendix. However, the estimated coefficients are smaller if self-\nemployed and civil servants are excluded.\nSecond, one might argue that non-working partners might either be restricted to adjust their\nindividual savings or might simply not have the opportunity for example for an occupational\npension plan. Thus we estimate our model using only the subsample of households with both\npartners working at least part or fulltime (results are shown in Table 6). Using this subsample\nconfirms our results of the full sample analysis. Male savings are now even more heavily\ninfluenced by female spouse's savings with an elasticity of 0.517 on a one percent significance\n19 For example peer effects have been also shown to exist with repect to the take up of paternity leave by Dahle\nlevel. The coefficient for the male spouse's savings also increases to 0.464 and is still significant\non a one percent level.\nAnother reason for concern might be the existence of differences in intra-household behavior\nwith respect to the type of saving contract. Subsidized contracts, either by direct subsidy\n(Riester pension) or by tax exemption for contributions (Riester and occupational pension\nplans) possess a ceiling for tax exemption and Riester pension plan additionally require a\nminimum saving rate in order to qualify for the full subsidy. Thus, there may exist incentives\nto shift savings from one partner to the other if the individual tax exemption ceiling for\ncontributions is reached. In order to analyze, whether there exist differences with respect to the\nsaving vehicles we estimate our model separately for somehow subsidized contracts (Riester\nand occupational pension plans) and unsubsidized contracts (cash-value life insurance and\nprivate unsubsidized pension plans). The results are presented in Table 7 in the Appendix and\nreveal slightly different patterns for both types of contract. The female spouse's saving amount\nto unsubsidized contracts significantly depends on male spouse's savings. By contrast, the\ncoefficient for female spouse's savings is only half as large but still significant on a five percent\nlevel. Turning to tax-subsidized savings things reverse. Male spouse's savings are now\nsignificantly influenced by the female spouse's savings. The coefficient for the male spouse's\nsavings is not significant for the female's savings amount anymore. The results for subsidized\ncontracts must however be handled with caution, as the number of observations shrinks to 278.\nOne restriction of the presented results of the simultaneous equation model might be that they\nare based on pooled cross-sectional data so far. Maybe the dynamics of the reaction of\nindividual savings to some common household optimization process takes place with a lag and\nis therefore not observable in cross-sectional data. Exploiting the panel structure of the two\nwaves of the PHF, we estimate a random-effects estimation for both spouses.20 The results are\nshown in table 8 and confirm a \"crowding in\" of private retirement savings on a one percent\nsignificance level. However, the coefficient for the other spouse's savings are smaller than in\nthe simultaneous equation model with pooled cross-sectional data.\n20 Applying the hausman test the zero hypothesis could not be rejected, recommending the use of a random-\neffects estimation.\n4. Concluding remarks\nWe examined the intra-household allocation of retirement savings in Germany. First, we looked\nat the allocation of retirement saving accounts within the household and found that, controlled\nfor other factors, possession of a saving account is positively correlated between spouses, giving\nsome evidence for a \"crowding-in\" of accounts. This might be due to some peer or recognition\neffect, where the need to save for retirement becomes obvious if one spouse starts saving or as\na sort of supplier-induced demand because of the contact to an insurance agent. Furthermore,\nthere might exist tax reasons inducing a splitting up of household retirement savings among\nspouses. Thus, a \"crowding-in\" of saving accounts does not necessarily provide evidence for a\n\"crowding-in\" of savings at all and does not reject the unitary or collective household model.\nAnalyzing the interaction of saving amounts in households with both spouses saving and\nallowing for endogeneity, revealed also the existence of a \"crowding-in\" of saving amounts.\nThese results show some evidence for a possible multiplier effect of fiscal incentives within\nhouseholds, what has to be considered analyzing public policy with respect to retirement\nsavings.\nOur findings give no evidence in support of the unitary household model with respect to\nretirement savings. Instead, retirement saving decisions seem to take place on an individual\nlevel, with a \"crowding-in\" by the partner's savings, induced probably by updated information\nor preferences. However, the same could be true for the collective household model, where due\nto new information the optimal household saving amount may be altered leading to both spouses\nincreasing their savings simultaneously. Or both spouses agree on a savings sharing rule, which\nalso imply mutually increasing savings in order to maintain a certain savings share. How these\nempirical estimates fit into existing theoretical models and whether they favor a special\ndecision-making process among spouses must be left to further research at this point.\nReferences\nAronsson, T., S.-V.
