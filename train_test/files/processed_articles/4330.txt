    "abstract": "Abstract: Smiling has been reported to be a signal of submission/lower status, or a sign of\ncooperation. In the present study, use of smiling and flirtation to \"make people receptive to\nmy ideas\" was conceptualized as mild aggression, since it is mildly manipulative of the\nperception of others as to one's internal emotional status. For 91 participants (55 female,\n36 male), use of smiling and flirtation to make others receptive to one's ideas were\nassociated with relational aggression and a more male-typical (smaller) right 2D:4D finger\nlength ratio. The only significant relationship in the male sample alone was the relationship\nbetween smiling and relational aggression. In the female sample alone, use of smiling and\nflirtation to \"make people receptive to my ideas\" was associated with a more male-typical\n2D:4D finger length ratio pattern, and there was a trend for flirtation to be associated with\ngreater physical aggression. Both 2D:4D and physical aggression have been associated with\nhigher prenatal androgen level. It is concluded that deliberate smiling and flirtation are mild\nforms of relational aggression, and are related to prenatal androgenic activity in a manner\nsimilar to physical aggression. These findings are discussed in terms of the different\nevolutionary strategies of men and women to control their social environments.\n",

In the present study, use of smiling and flirtation to\nmanipulate others was conceptualized as mild aggression. The purpose of the present study\nwas to evaluate sex differences in the use of smiling and flirtation to influence the behavior\nof others, and to evaluate relationships of smiling and flirtation to other variables that have\nshown sex differences, such as aggression and a measure of prenatal androgenic influence,\nfinger length ratios.\nSmiling and flirtation\nThere is a great deal of human and non-human primate literature indicating that\nsmiling is a submissive signal. The non-human primate analogue to a human smile is\nthought to be the silent bared teeth display and is seen in contexts of appeasement and\nreconciliation (de Waal and Luttrell, 1985; Kummer, 1957; Thierry, Demaria, Preuschott,\ncooperation. For example, Mehu et al. (2007) reported that spontaneous (Duchenne) smiles\nwere displayed at higher rates in a sharing situation compared to a control condition, and\nnon-Duchenne smiles did not vary between control and sharing situations. The authors\nconcluded that a spontaneous, honest (Duchenne) smile would reliably indicate altruistic\nintention, and thus be important in forming cooperative relationships. In another study,\nsmiling faces elicited trust and cooperation responses among strangers in a one-shot\ninteraction (Scharleman, Eckel, Kacelnik, and Wilson, 2001).\nLafrance, Hecht and Paluck, 2003), raising questions of biological/hormonal mechanisms.\nDabbs (1997) reported smaller smiles and less use of eye muscles (orbicularis oculi) while\nsmiling in high testosterone men compared to low testosterone men, with only weak\nrelationships in the female participants. The lack of use of eye muscles is significant,\nbecause that is a component of spontaneous (Duchenne) smiles. Thus, the lower use of eye\nmuscles in high testosterone men suggests greater use of non-spontaneous smiles, which\ncould be a means of interpersonal control.\nOther studies have reported lower frequency of smiling in high (vs low) testosterone\nmen (Dabbs, Hargrove and Heusel, 1996) and less frequent smiling in high (vs. low)\ntestosterone women (Cashdan, 1995). Ellis (2006) has suggested that less frequent male\nthan female smiling overall may be due to the idea that smiling would interfere with the\nability to intimidate a rival in mate-competition. It is important to note that smiling may\nhave a different function in men and women for navigating their specific within-sex and\nbetween-sex contexts.\nIn some contexts, smiling may be a form of flirtation. Kray and Locke (2008)\nevaluated the use of flirtation by women to gain power in professional contexts. They\nfound that female negotiators that used flirtation were judged to be less authentic but more\nlikeable than the female negotiators that did not. Using attraction to gain power is a useful\nstrategy, as physical attractiveness has been shown to increase perceptions of intelligence\nSmiling, flirtation and aggression\nand success (see Zebrowitz, 1997), and smiling has significant effects on attractiveness\nFinger length ratios\nThe present study used finger length ratios as an index of prenatal androgenic\nactivity, given the well-known relationships between androgens and aggression, and the\ncurrent focus on smiling as an aggressive behavior. Finger length ratios have been shown\nto differ for male and female subjects from age two and older, such that a smaller ratio of\nthe second to fourth finger (relatively larger fourth than second finger) is found in men\nPhelps, 1952; see Manning, 2002 for a review). Consistent sex differences in digit length\nratios have also been found in mice, baboons, gorillas, and chimps (Brown, Finn, and\nSex differences in finger length ratios are thought to reflect prenatal organizational\neffects (Manning, 2002), because hand patterns are set prenatally (see Manning, 2002;\nGarn, Burdi, Babler, and Stinson, 1975) and the ratio difference has been reported at such a\nyoung age. McIntyre, Ellison, Lieberman, Demerath, and Towne (2005) have reported\nlongitudinal data using radiographs indicating that sex differences arise before puberty and\nfinger lengths in infancy and childhood are highly correlated with adult lengths.\nHomosexual men and women show finger ratio patterns in between that of heterosexual\nmen and women (McFadden and Shubel, 2002). Further, female subjects with congenital\nadrenal hyperplasia (CAH) show a finger length pattern in the direction of the male pattern\n(Brown, Hines, Fane, and Breedlove, 2002).\nA study by Burton, Henninger, Hafetz, and Cofer (2009) evaluated an independent\nsample of 134 participants with the Aggression Questionnaire of Buss and Perry (1992) and\na Gender-Typical Play Behavior Questionnaire constructed for that study. Sex differences\nin physical aggression and in the finger length ratios were found, in the directions reported\nin the literature, and for the male participants, a more male-typical finger length ratio was\nassociated with a higher physical aggression score. Correlations between greater current\nreport of physical aggression and play style more typical of boys during childhood were\nfound in both the male and female samples, supporting the idea that physical aggression,\nchildhood play style, and finger length ratios may reflect prenatal androgenic influence.\nThe present study\nIn the present study, using smiling and flirtation to make others receptive to one's\nideas was evaluated. The relationships of these variables to measures of relational\naggression, physical aggression, and finger length ratios as a measure of prenatal\nandrogenic activity were also evaluated.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThere were 91 participants (55 female and 36 male) from the university community\nin the present study (male average age of 19.5 years, SD of 1.0; female average of 19.8, SD\nSmiling, flirtation and aggression\nof 3.1); these participants have been described in Burton et al. (2010). Participants came\nfrom the population of students taking Introduction to Psychology classes, who participated\nin partial fulfillment of a research requirement. Thus, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of\nbeing able to read sufficiently well to take a college course was fulfilled. Although\nstudents were able to stop participation at any time or not participate at all, none chose\nthese options.\nMeasures\nSmiling and flirtation questions. Participants were asked to rate themselves on a\nscale of 1 (Never) to 5 (Always) in response to two questions:\n1. I'm good at using a smile to make people receptive to my ideas.\n2. I'm successful at using flirtation to make people receptive to my ideas.\nThese two simple and straight-forward questions have good face validity, since both\nflirtation and smiling are well-understood terms in the vernacular.\nPhysical aggression questionnaire. The Physical Aggression Questionnaire of Buss\nand Perry (1992) was used with slight modifications, including changing the Likert scale\nwording (never = 1, sometimes = 2, frequently = 3, very frequently = 4, always = 5), and\nchanging the direction of rating to be consistently the same. The nine physical aggression\nitems queried being unable to control the urge to strike someone, hitting with provocation,\nhitting back, getting into fights more than average, resorting to violence to protect rights,\ncoming to blows if pushed too far, having good reasons for hitting, threatening others, and\nbreaking things in anger. A physical aggression total score was calculated by adding the\nitem values. Scores could range from nine to 45, with high scores indicating high\naggression. The Physical Aggression scale and other scales were constructed by Buss and\nPerry from replicated factor analyses on items assessing physical aggression, verbal\naggression, anger and hostility in a sample of 1,253 college students. Evaluation of the\ninternal consistency for the Physical Aggression scale yielded an alpha coefficient of .85,\nand the test-retest reliability correlation was .80.\nRelational aggression questionnaire. The Relational Aggression items consisted of\nthe seven items suggested by Werner and Crick (1999) with slight modification, such as\nchanging the Likert scale categories (never = 1, sometimes = 2, frequently = 3, very\nfrequently = 4, always = 5), and altering the wording to allow self vs. peer rating.\nBehaviors evaluated included use of the \"silent treatment\", damaging reputation with\ngossip, excluding and ignoring others, threatening to share private information, and\nattempting to steal a dating partner. Each item involved a self-rating on the 5 point Likert\nscale, with the direction such that a higher number was associated with higher aggression.\nTotal scores can range from seven to 35. Werner and Crick evaluated 225 college students,\nand reported good reliability, with a Cronbach's alpha of .87.\n2D:4D finger length ratios. Photocopies of both hands with fingers together and\nrings removed were obtained. The length in millimeters was measured from the proximal\ncrease at the base of the digit to the tip of the finger. The ratios of the length of the second\nto fourth finger (2D:4D) of the right and left hands were calculated. As discussed, smaller\nratios are found in men compared to women.\nSmiling, flirtation and aggression\nResults\nSex differences in 2D:4D and physical aggression were found, consistent with other\nreports (Table 1). The male participants reported higher physical aggression and both right\nand left 2D:4D were lower in the male than the female participants, as in the literature\nreviewed. There was a trend for greater use of flirtation by the female than male\nparticipants.\nTable 1. Means (SD) for male and female participants\nMale Female t p\nNote: significant differences, and those approaching significance, are in bold.\nSeparate regressions were done with smiling and flirtation as the criterion variables,\nand sex, relational aggression, physical aggression and right and left 2D:4D as the predictor\nvariables. Significant models emerged for both smiling (F(5,85) = 3.79; p = .004, adjusted\n2). Greater smiling was associated with greater relational aggression and a more male-\ntypical right 2D:4D ratio; a trend was seen for greater smiling in the female than male\nparticipants. Greater flirtation was similarly associated with greater relational aggression\nand with a more male-typical right 2D:4D ratio, with a trend for an opposite pattern in the\nleft 2D:4D ratio. There was also a trend for greater use of flirtation in the female than male\nparticipants.\nGiven the current focus on sex differences, separate regressions were done for the\nmale and female participants with smiling and flirtation as criterion variables and relational\naggression, physical aggression and right and left 2D:4D as the predictor variables. For\nadjusted R-square = .192), and emerged at a trend level for the female participants (F(4,50)\nrelational aggression in both the male and female participants, and greater smiling was\nassociated with a more male-typical pattern in the right 2D:4D ratio for the female\nparticipants.\nFor flirtation, the model was significant for the female participants (F(4,50) = 3.96,\np = .007; adjusted R-square = .180), and insignificant for the male participants (F(4,31) =\n1.12, p = .366; adjusted R-square = .012). For the female participants, greater flirtation was\nassociated with a more male-typical pattern in the right 2D:4D ratio, and there was a trend\nfor greater flirtation to be associated with greater physical aggression.\nSmiling, flirtation and aggression\nTable 2.

In the female sample alone, use of smiling and\nflirtation to \"make people receptive to my ideas\" was associated with a more male-typical\n2D:4D finger length ratio pattern, and there was a trend for flirtation to be associated with\ngreater physical aggression. As discussed, both 2D:4D and physical aggression have been\nassociated with higher prenatal androgen level.\nThe use of smiling and flirtation to \"make others receptive to my ideas\" implies a\nless than sincere display of facial expression and behavior as a means to an end. An attempt\nto influence others with less than honest behavior is manipulative, and can possibly be seen\nas a form of mild aggression. Certainly the strong relationships in the current dataset found\nbetween smiling and flirtation and relational aggression suggest this.\nThus, these data suggest that use of smiling and flirtation can be more than a signal\nof submission/lower status or cooperation. Deceptively signaling cooperation or\nSmiling, flirtation and aggression\nsubmission may at times be an effective means of controlling a situation. Smiling has been\nshown to greatly influence outcomes. For example, Lafrance and Hecht (1995) showed that\nsmiling resulted in lesser sentences for court convictions, and Mullen et al. (1986) reported\nthat newscasters' smiles influenced candidate choice.\nWhen behavior occurs with opposite-sexed pairs, smiling may at times be part of\nflirtation. Grammer, Kruck, Juette, and Fink (2000) presented data indicating that women\ninitiate and control outcomes of interactions with male strangers by using flirtation\n(\"solicitation\" or courtship-like behavior) that is not strongly related to professed interest in\nthe man in the initial stages. Tidd and Lochard (1978) reported that men gave bigger tips\nthan women to a smiling waitress. Thus, smiling in general, and flirtation may be very\neffective means to very significant ends.\nMehu and Dunbar (2008) evaluated the Power Asymmetry Hypothesis of\nPreuschoft and van Hooff (1995), which suggests that the type of social organization\ndetermines the meaning of displays, and thus predicts that appeasement and affiliation\nsignals sent and received depend on status differentiation. Mehu and Dunbar (2008)\nevaluated smiling in people, and found that younger and presumably lower status men\nshowed more deliberate (vs. spontaneous) smiles when interacting with older and\npresumably higher status men. The authors interpreted this as reflecting that \"deliberate\nsmiles could play a role in the regulation of hierarchical relationships.\" This interpretation\nis very similar to the interpretation of the present dataset that less than sincere smiles can be\nat least mildly manipulative.\nSincere smiling may certainly indicate submission or affiliation, as the numerous\nstudies reviewed earlier have demonstrated, but insincere or deceptive use of smiling and\nflirtation to \"make others receptive to my ideas\" may be very different. Manipulative\nsmiling and flirtation were both related to a more male-typical 2D:4D pattern, suggesting\nprenatal androgen activity as an underlying correlate. The trend for a relationship in the\nfemale participants between a more male-typical 2D:4D pattern and physical aggression is\nalso suggestive of an underlying prenatal androgenic correlate, as the relationship between\nphysical aggression and androgens has been well-documented.\nIt should be noted that although the questions assessing use of smiling and flirtation\nwere quite literal and appeared to have good face validity, some participants may have just\nresponded to the \"smiling\" or \"flirtation\" or \"make people receptive\" parts of the questions.\nThus, it is possible that a participant focused on the smiling concept and responded that he\nor she smiles a lot, or similarly, focused more on the manipulation or flirtation concepts.\nThe fact that similar relationships were found between both smiling and flirtation and the\nother variables lends support to the idea that they did interpret the question as intended,\nsince the commonality between the two questions was the concept of making others\nreceptive to one's ideas.\nIn sum, it is concluded that deliberate smiling and flirtation to make others receptive\nto one's ideas are forms of mild relational aggression, and are related to prenatal\nandrogenic activity in a manner similar to physical aggression. The present data suggest\nthat women use deliberate smiling and flirtation more than men, and this may reflect the\ndifferent resources that men and women have available. An obvious resource men have\nmore available to them than women is larger physical size; perhaps evolutionary pressures\nSmiling, flirtation and aggression\nresulted in an elaboration of this variable into the greater physical aggression seen in men\ncompared to women. Analogously, a resource women have more available to them than\nmen is better understanding of facial emotion and social/emotional interpersonal\nunderstanding in general (Bar-On, 1997; Burton, Hafetz, and Henninger, 2007; Burton,\nRabin, Wyatt, Frohlich, Vardy, and Dimitri, 2005), and perhaps selection pressures resulted\nin an elaboration of these variables into the generally higher level of relational aggression\n(Crick and Grotpeter, 1995) and use of deliberate smiling seen women compared to men.\nThe present study suggests that deliberate smiling and flirtation can be considered effective\nmildly aggressive behaviors for controlling and influencing social situations.\nReferences\nBar-On, R.
