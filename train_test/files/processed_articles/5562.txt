When a claim is made that a certain language has N colour terms, the focal\ntask examines the behaviours of a representative sample of native speakers in identifying the\nregions in which each of the colour terms are clustered. The results may clarify central and\nunusual properties of colour-term denotations. On one hand, the focal task can (dis)prove the\nhypothesis claiming that colour expressions are universally based on `favoured precepts\nselected from restricted regions of the colour space' (Regier, Kay, & Cook, 2005). In such\nstudies, the most common colour array is the Munsell colour system (Munsell, 1912). On the\nother hand, from a lexico-semantic perspective, experiments testing focal colour distribution\ncan assist studies on expressions that have a diffuse set of colour denotations and provide\nevidence for purported `colour' terms that have almost no central concentrations in a colour\narray, allowing for reflective assessments of the structuring of sensory meanings and the\ncultural component through which objects obtain their symbolic meanings (Barthes, 1967).\nThis study builds on the previously published dataset by Brindle (2016), which is presented\nin more detail in the section titled `Colour categorisation in Chakali'. This original study left\none important question open: Do all purported `colour' terms have a central concentration in\na colour array? We aim to address this question by developing a mapping methodology while\nkeeping in mind two distinct challenges in colour studies: the first being a practical and\nmethodological one related to consistency in mapping different colour systems and the\nother being an ontological one regarding the status of ideophones as colour terms.\nThe main objectives of this study are to develop a method that brings together all the\ncolour notations and to use the Commission internationale de l'e\n\u00b4 clairage (CIE) numerical\nvalues for the tiles in the Color-aid Corporation Chart to systematically (dis)qualify\nideophonic expressions as colour terms.\nColour Mapping Between Colour Systems\nWhile the Munsell colour system has been widely used across disciplines such as\nanthropology, psychology and linguistics, various studies used the Ostwald colour system\ninstead (Ostwald, Ostwald, & Streller, 1939); the most representative of these are a series of\ndescriptive studies regarding the linguistic influences on colour and categorical perceptions\ncarried out at the University of Surrey (i.e., Hippisley, Davies, & Corbett, 2008; I. Davies &\nDavies, Jover, Vega, & Ponte, 2001; I. R. L. Davies et al., 1992). The languages studied by\nSurrey groups are Russian, English, Sorbian, Tsakhur, Setswana, Catalan, and Damara. The\nOstwald colour system was implemented by the Color-aid Corporation in the ordered set of\n2 i-Perception\ncolour tiles in which the main features of colour are defined as hue, tint, and shade (Color-\nAid-Corporation, Revised 2006). In addition, the series of studies at the University of Surrey\nidentified the loci of the colour terms (from several languages throughout the world) within\nthe CIE chromaticity diagram and converted some of the Color-aid codes (i.e., the tile ID\nnumbers) into the CIE coordinates; however, the data were limited to 65 preselected tiles.1\nUntil now, no CIE conversion has ever been offered for the complete range of 314 colours\nin the Color-aid Corporation Chart. In addition, colour measurements presented in previous\nstudies are not complete or, at least, were not presented as such. Photometrical data collected\nfrom all 314 Color-aid tiles under stable laboratory condition and made accessible to the\nresearch community would be a valuable contribution to the literature and to researchers of\nvarious scientific disciplines. In addition to the CIE (u0, v0) chromaticity graph, a graphical\npresentation of the Natural Colour System (NCS) was used to represent the results in a way\nthat would be easier to interpret.\nOntological Challenge\nWhile the primary goal of a focal task is to identify the region in which a colour term is most\nappropriately located, another of its more rarely mentioned goals is to shed light on `secondary'\nterms (i.e., those that are relatively less frequent and lack agreement among consultants as to\nwhat they denote). In this regard, the result of focal task may clarify the unusual properties of\ncolour-term denotations, thereby providing an explanation for how a purported `colour' term\nhas almost no central concentrations in a colour array. For example, could this issue be a\nconsequence of the a priori categorisation in the colour array presented to the consultants?\nTo delve deeper into this line of research, this article reports and analyses data from a field\nexperiment conducted among native speakers of Chakali, a South-western Grusi language\nspoken in northern Ghana. The primary objective is to attempt to devise how to study\nexpressions that, at first, appear to describe colours but are not yet assigned to any\nspecific region in a colour array; in other words, this article explores how to draw a line\nbetween a visual-perception term and a colour term. To address this objective, we used a\nstatistical analysis method to identify the dissimilarities between the terms assigned by the\nconsultants to each colour category, the results of which are shown in the section titled\n`Statistical analysis'.\nColour Categorisation in Chakali\nThis article makes use of data from Brindle (2016), who analysed colour categorisation in\nChakali in an attempt to identify its colour terms and other expressions of visual perception.\nBrindle used a tile-naming task, a focal task and a folk-definition task, describing how native\nspeakers (language) make use of colour terms in a folk categorization. These experiments\nwere carried out in March 2008 and April 2013. The findings suggest that the language has at\nleast three terms corresponding largely to white, black and red, as well as a few other terms in\na `statistical transitional' stage (Brindle, 2016).\nResults from the tile-naming task included a series of expressions from which basic\ngrouping, based on dominance and specificity, was determined.2 The triad of `white',\n`black' and `red' achieved the highest consensus among the consultants, followed by terms\ncorresponding to `yellow' and `blue-green' (grue). The ideophonic expression hwlahwla (and\nits variant: hwhwla) had a relatively high frequency, similar to the latter two colour terms, yet\nno significant consensus could be detected as to which colour region this term denotes.\nAfter analysing the results of the tile-naming task, many questions were raised; one was\nArbab et al. 3\nrelated to the need to account for hwlahwla, that is: What status is to be given to a relatively\nfrequent term lacking dominance? Another question encompassed the larger domain of\ninquiry, one related to the meanings of various ideophonic terms that are infrequent and\nlacking dominance for the most part, yet employed by most of the consultants.\nTo answer these questions, we must first decipher the nature of these ideophonic\nexpressions. Due to the extensive research conducted within the last decade,3 ideophones\nare better known and are more reliably defined. According to Dingemanse (2012),\nideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery and are connected to\nextralinguistic concepts: they can evoke sounds, taste, visual effects, texture, smell and so\non; they often have a reduplicative structure; they are often form a separate grammatical\ncategory; and they are mainly found in Asian, African and Amerindian languages.\nIdeophones subsumes onomatopoeic expressions since the latter phonetically imitate the\nsource of the sounds they describe. More generally, ideophones evoke a vivid impression\nof an idea.4 It comes as no surprise, therefore, that ideophones emerged in an experiment on\nexpressions describing the visual appearance domain; however, it appears that ideophones\nhave a different meaning than the one ascribed by Dingemanse, at least regarding the\nassociation between a colour region and a term.\nSince the measure of dominance within the tile-naming task is intimately related to the\nconsultants' general concord on a colour term and its corresponding region, the focal task\nwas considered an appropriate follow-up experiment. This experiment is designed to\nreveal the exemplary colour space for a set of expressions; that is, the focal task\ndetermines how the consultants treat expressions denoted by a diffuse set of tiles in the\ntile-naming task, thus determining whether all purported `colour' terms have a central\nconcentration in a colour array.\nThrough the focal task, Brindle (2016) aimed at gathering the best examples in an\narray of colours. Data were collected using a relatively simple, inexpensive and\nreplicable method consisting of laying out the Color-aid Charts on a one-meter-high table.\nTwenty-three adult consultants (10 men and 13 women, with the age ranging from 30 to\n70 years with an average age of 45 years) stood by the table and viewed the array, displayed in\nThe experiment took place outside, under the shade of thatched roofs, between 10:00 and\n14:00 over two successive, sunny days. A typical session lasted 15 minutes and all sessions\nwere recorded and transcribed onsite. The consultants were asked, one-by-one, the question\nin the following diagram (Q), which was uttered by a field assistant who is a native speaker of\nChakali. In each session, the colour word in the question was replaced by every stimulus\nexpression listed in Table 2 in either alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order, which was\nchosen at random.\nQ: k\u00b4\nIna\n` ha\n\u00b4  n`I, a\n\u00b4 we\n` \n k\na ja\n` a\n` a\n\u00b4 s`Ia\n` ma\n\u00b4 t`Int`I?\n`Of all these things, which one is really asIama?'\nUsing a short baton, the consultants were instructed to point at a single colour tile that they\nbelieved best fit the given term. The experiment did not check the range of each term, only the\nbest example for all colour terms presented. While no tests for colour vision were carried out,\ntypical results of red\u00adgreen colour blindness do not take part in the match.\nThe 314 colour tiles measured 0.5 \u00c2 0.8 inches each and were distributed over four charts\nChart 1 was deliberately covered as it contained 10 tiles (i.e., R, Y, B, G, YO, Yc, Gw,\nBG, Rc and RO) at their highest point of saturation, which may have affected the\nconsultants' point of gaze and attracted too much of their attention; thus, the four charts\n4 i-Perception\ncontained a total of 304 colour tiles. The goal was to encourage the consultants to visually\nsearch through all four charts until they identified the best example.\nBased on the results from the tile-naming task, the following groups were isolated for the\nfocal task: (a) dominant, (b) name-an-object (i.e., the name of an object that is characteristically\nof the corresponding colour; see Berlin & Kay, 1969; e.g., s\nGsa\n\u00b4\nG refers to the flour of the\ndawadawa fruit and s\nG \nws\n\"n\nI \nI refers to the broth made from boiled bean leaves), (c)\nborrowed and (d) ideophones. Table 1 displays the colour terms belonging to each group.\nColour-Mapping Method and Representation\nA new method was introduced to determine the CIE values for the full set of 314 Color-aid\ntiles using photometrical measurements. One of the goals of colour science is to specify the\nquality of colour using certain colour spaces. Some colour spaces separate the three\ndimensions of colour into one luminance dimension and two chromaticity dimensions\nwhile also maintaining perceptual uniformity (e.g., the CIELAB model).

However, this\ndiagram does not have a direct perceptual correlation; hence, many different chromaticity\ndiagrams have been proposed by squeezing or stretching the CIE (x, y) chromaticity diagram\nso that it better represents the correlations between perceived colour differences and the\ncorresponding distances in the diagram. The x and y variables were transformed into a\nnew set of values (u, v) through a set of mathematical formulas (DeCusatis, 1997).\nIn 1976, the CIE standardised the (u0, v0) diagram as an approximately uniform\nchromaticity diagram. This was achieved by multiplying the values for v by 1.5; thus, in\nThe values of u0 and v0, as well as other photometrical values, in the whole Color-aid set\nwere measured under an artificial sky, which simulates overcast (i.e., creates even and diffused\nillumination; see B. Matusiak & Arnesen, 2005; B. S. Matusiak & Braczkowski, 2014;\nFigure 2), at the Daylight Laboratory of the Department of Architecture and Technology,\nLight & Colour Centre, NTNU. The ceiling of the artificial sky room is covered in RGBW\nLED-chips, which can generate light with different correlated-colour-temperature (CCT)\nvalues.\nIn this study, a CCT of 6,500K was used. To provide stable and comfortable illumination,\nthe illuminance level under the artificial sky was adjusted to 50% of the maximum power,\nimparting an illuminance of around 8,610 lux onto the Color-aid tiles. The tiles were\nsuccessively placed on a table located in the middle of the artificial sky room. The\nphotometrical measurements were taken using the SpectraScan PR-655 tool\n(PhotoResearch) to determine the CIE coordinates for all 314 colour tiles. Each tile had a\nmatte finish and measured 2 \u00c2 3 inches.\nAs indicated earlier, the CIE system is not easily interpreted. Since the NCS provides a\ngraphical representation of colours that is more easily understood, both by professionals and\nlaypeople, we decided to use the NCS to represent the results of this study, in addition to the\nCIE (u0, v0) diagram. The NCS uses a numeric code that describes both the hue and nuance of\neach colour (Ha\nyellow with 90% perceived red in hue, with a nuance of 10% blackness and 50% chromaticness\n(Figure 3). We used the NCS Colour Scan tool to find the NCS code corresponding to each\nFigure 2.

The NCS codes are presented in Table 2.\nResults\nThe result of the focal task in Brindle (2016) indicates that a wide range of colour tiles were\nassigned to each ideophonic expression, which suggests that the selected ideophonic\nexpressions cannot be reliably ascribed to a recognisable colour region. Converting the 314\nColor-aid tiles into the CIE numerical values allowed us the opportunity to diagnose\nBrindle's data and answer the questions raised. This section proposes how one can\napproach situations in which ideophones cannot be said to denote `colours', as categorised\nby the Color-aid Corporation.\nIn Table 2, the Chakali expressions, the Color-aid tile code, the number of consultants\nwho pointed at each tile, the NCS code, the x-value, the y-value, the u0-value, the v0-value\nand the luminance (cd/m2) are aligned from left to right. It can be observed that the terms\np\nGmma\u00b4, bu\u00b4mmo` and s`\nIa`ma\u00b4 are, respectively, clustered around the whitish-light, blackish-\ndark, and reddish tiles. The name-an-object terms are predominantly associated with\nspecific regions: s\nGsa\u00b4\nG `dawadawa flour' with the yellowish and orangish tiles, and\ns\nG \nws\n\"n\nI\nI `bean-leaf water/broth' with the greenish tiles. The English loanword, bu`lu\u00b4u`,\nclearly indicates a `grue' category, as the consultants mainly identified bluish and\ngreenish tiles as best fits for the term. Only two unusual responses produced results in\nthe yellow-brownish (YO-S1) and soft red-beige (RO-T2) areas. For the ideophones, the\nconsultants identified tiles that are distributed across the charts and, therefore, cannot be\nreliably ascribed to a familiar colour space or category.\nThe lists of tile codes in Table 2 show that all ideophones can be represented with warm\nand cool hues. Some could be delineated with negative statements; for example, RileRile was\nassigned to 22 tiles without redness (R). Regardless, we argue that there are no defining\nproperties among the ideophones; thus, the only generalisation that can be made is that no\ncolour categorisation emerged in this category. There were almost as many tiles identified for\neach ideophone as there were consultants, leading us to believe that these ideophones may\nnot have foci in the Ostwald or other colour systems, with perhaps one exception: h\nwla`h\nwla`.\nFigure 3.

We\nreturn to this problem in the `Statistical analysis' and `Discussion and conclusion' sections.\nResults from the focal task provide evidence that bu\u00b4mmo`, p\nGmma\u00b4 and s`\nIa`ma\u00b4 are defined\nby the most centrally concentrated colour terms, followed by s\nGsa\u00b4\nG, s\nG \nws\n\"n\nI \nI and bu\n` lu\n\u00b4 u\n` ,\nwhile the ideophones are not denoted by the `colours' categorised by the Color-aid\nCorporation; however, but could possibly be of the `desaturated colour-type'\nFigure 4.

Example diagrams for Category 1: bu\n\u00b4mmo\n`.\nThe results will be presented graphically via the NCS Colour Circle (hue), the NCS Colour\nTriangle (nuance) and the 1976 CIE (u0, v0) chromaticity diagram. To simplify the\npresentation, the graphics in Figure 4 were used. One example from each category was\npresented via the NCS circle and triangle diagrams, as shown in Figures 5 to 8. The CIE\n(u0, v0) chromaticity and spectral power distributions were measured for all colour terms and\nare available from the authors upon request.\nBased on results presented in Table 2 and Figures 5 to 8, we can conclude the following:\n(1) The term bu\u00b4mmo`, as presented in Figure 5, may be an appropriate expression for `dark-\ngrey' or `near-black' since most of the consultants (20 out of 23) selected a grey tile with\n(2) The term s\nGsa\u00b4\nG, as presented in Figure 6, may be an appropriate expression for a\nyellowish colour, but with a wide range of yellow hues with different nuances. Most of\nthe nuances have the same level of blackness, which is 5%.\n(3) The term bu\n`lu\u00b4u`, as presented in Figure 7, may describe a bluish colour but one that is\nunclear in hue and nuances.\n(4) The term h\nwla`h\nwla\n`, as presented in Figure 8, does not refer to any specific colour as the\nassigned tiles are distributed across the NCS Colour Circle. The nuances are also very\ndifferent and do not have a clear pattern. We can propose that the selected colours are\nmore pale (have more whitish).\nV'\nU'\nFigure 6. Example diagrams for Category 2: s\nGsa\n\u00b4\nG.\nStatistical Analysis\nA statistical analysis was also carried out. To calculate the similarities between tiles selected\nby the consultants based on their perceptions of the colour terms, the data were split into two\ncategories: hue and degree of blackness.\nFigure 9 displays the mean degree of blackness among the selected colour tiles for\nthe studied colour terms with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The 95% CI represents\nthe degree of certainty for the mean degree of blackness, which, in turn, depends on the\nstandard deviation. The 95% CI also represents the degree of agreement among the\nconsultants: the smaller the CI, the greater the degree of agreement. The strongest\nagreement on the degree of blackness can be found in the colours selected for s`\nIa`ma\u00b4 and\np\nGmma\u00b4, while the strongest disagreement can be found in the colours selected for Ri`le`Ri`le` and\ndNu`mo\n`dNu`mo\n`.\nFor the hues, figuring out the degree of similarity is not as straightforward. We selected the\nNCS Colour System to achieve this, since the hues are arranged in a circle and distances\nbetween the different hues can be calculated using the degrees of the circle. We thus translated\nevery hue of the colour circle into a degree, with 9 marking the distance between two\nneighbouring hues. Then, for each pair of colour tiles selected (i.e., answers given by two\nconsultants) for the same colour term, the shortest distance in the circle was calculated in\ndegrees. The distances were then averaged across all possible pairs to indicate the average\nV'\nU'\nV-S2 (2) Bc-Hue BV-Hue\nFigure 7. Example diagrams for Category 3: bu\n`lu\n\u00b4u\n`.\ndisagreement. For bu\u00b4mmo` and p\nGmma\u00b4, no mean distance in hue could be calculated because\nmost consultants chose a tile that did not include hue, only different degrees of blackness.\nTo test if these calculations are significantly different from those resulting from a random\ndraw of the colour tiles, we ran 50 simulations in which 23 colour tiles were randomly drawn\nfrom the total array of 304 tiles with replacement. We then calculated the average degree of\nthe mean blackness among the 50 samples (represented by the dotted line in Figure 9) as well\nas the mean of the 95% CIs (represented by the grey box in Figure 9). The four leftmost\ncolour terms in Figure 9 were assigned colour tiles with a significantly lower degree of\nblackness than those randomly drawn from the full array (i.e., the CI for these four terms\ndo not overlap with the randomly drawn 95% CIs), and only bu\u00b4mmo` has a significantly\nhigher degree of blackness.\nFigure 10 displays the mean distance in degrees on the NCS Colour Circle between the\nselected colour tiles for each term, along with their 95% CIs. To test if these calculations are\nsignificantly different from those resulting from a random draw of the colour tiles, we ran 50\nsimulations in which 23 colour tiles were randomly drawn from the total array of 304 tiles\nwith replacement. We then calculated the average distances between the colour tiles in all 50\nsamples (represented by the dotted line in Figure 10) as well as the mean 95% CIs\n(represented by the grey box in Figure 10). The colour tiles selected for the three leftmost\ncolour terms have significantly lower distance than those randomly drawn from the colour\nsamples (i.e., the CIs for these three terms do not overlap with the randomly drawn 95%\nCIs), which means that there is a significantly greater degree of agreement among the\nV'\nU'\nY-S1 (2) Yc-Hue YO-LT Y-LT\nFigure 8.

The developed method\noffers value beyond this study and every researcher is permitted to use the dataset, which\nis provided in Online Appendix. The article began by presenting the original measurements of\nall the tiles in the Color-aid Corporation Chart, then narrowing down the discussion to the\nfocal task experiment.\nIn the focal task, the goal was to understand the meaning of Chakali colour terms in terms\nof established colour systems. The results were obtained with the help of the Color-aid\nsystem, the NCS Colour Circle, the NCS Colour Triangle and the 1976 CIE (u0, v0)\nchromaticity diagram. The CIE coordinates and the NCS codes were calculated using\nthe SpectraScan and NCS colour scanner tools, respectively. The range of tiles selected for\neach colour term was analysed in terms of their u0 and v0 values (CIE) and their hues and\nnuances (NCS).\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that speakers of different languages may segment the\ncolour spectrum differently and that some nonchromatic properties may serve as variables to\nConklin's (1955) study on Hanunoo colour terms showed that the variable of wetness or\ndryness could override hue when establishing the appropriate colour term.\nBased on the visual inspections, the data of this study suggest that the best example could\nnot be found for some terms, as the degree of variation is too significant to identify a\nparticular region of the colour space. On the face of it, there is no consensus and an\nintermediate range is not easily conceived.\nBefore eliminating the chromatic properties and testing for various determinants, the\nmeasurements of the tiles were converted into CIE coordinates to expose emerging clusters\nthat could be deduced from their chromatic properties, such as light/pale versus dark, or\nwarm versus cool.\nIf it turns out to be impossible to map the colour terms onto the Color-aid Chart, the\nremaining questions are: What may account for that impossibility and how could we test it?\nThis article concludes with some remarks on the potential applications for the\nmeasurements and the colour perception vocabulary of Chakali. We found that most of\nthe Chakali terms were not clear enough for the consultants to select or label them with\nthe related colour tiles, which suggests that naming and linguistic categorisations may affect\nrecognition. However, the findings were particularly interesting for the ideophone h\nwla`h\nwla`,\nwhich might have some characteristics of colour. This term is highly frequent, but the\nconsultants could not agree on where the colour should be mapped. Regarding hue, the\nconsultants' answers spread across the NCS Colour Circle, while their answers on the\nNCS Colour Triangle are found rather close to pure white and can therefore be\ninterpreted as having whitish nuances.\nThe statistical analysis revealed that among the colours selected for h\nwla\n`h\nwla` or h\nwh\nwla`,\nsimilar to other ideophones included in this study, the mean distance between any two hues\n(dissimilarity) was about 90 (i.e., 90 on the NCS Colour Circle), which is also the distance\nbetween two consecutive primary colours (e.g., pure yellow and pure red, pure red and pure\nblue, etc.). In addition, contrary to other ideophones, h\nwla\n`h\nwla` or h\nwh\nwla\n` refers to a colour\nwith a very low degree of blackness (i.e., between 5% and 20%, with a mean degree of\nblackness of about 12%). For the rest of the ideophones, it was not easy to predict which\ncolour they referred to.\nThe primary meaning of the remaining ideophones must be further investigated. In this\nstudy, we tried to categorise them but did not achieve with any convincing results. Therefore,\nwe posit that these ideophones do not represent colours, but they may be connected to visual\nperception in some manner.\nWe propose that the developed method, consisting of the CIE and NCS systems and\nsupplemented by a novel approach to statistical analysis, could be a very useful tool for\ngaining a better understanding of how precise different languages are in terms of colour\nnaming, even when there are no equivocal colour terms in English. This method enables a\nprecise, numerical estimate of the dissimilarity between the colours selected, both in terms of\nblackness and hue.\n"
