It is widely\nrecognized that endothelial dysfunction that is caused by diabetes in various vascular beds\ncontributes to a wide range of complications and exerts unfavorable effects on microcirculatory\nregulation. The coronary microcirculation is precisely regulated through a number of intercon-\nnected physiological processes with the purpose of matching local blood flow to myocardial\nmetabolic demands.

Endothelial dysfunction, with its\nunfavorable consequences in various vascu-\nlar beds, has been widely recognized to be a\nresult of pathophysiological processes in\ndiabetes,4\u00ad6 with less information available\nin the context of the coronary microvascu-\nlature. Functional changes precede morpho-\nlogical changes,3 and therefore timely\nrecognition of this problem and identifica-\ntion of appropriate action strategies will be\ncrucial in successful future care of patients.\nThe purpose of this review is to discuss the\nmost important findings regarding coronary\nmicrovascular dysfunction in diabetes, from\npre-clinical and clinical perspectives,\nbecause this topic has become of greater\ninterest to researchers and clinicians in\nrecent years. This field of research is espe-\ncially relevant when considering the increas-\ning morbidity, as well as the relatively high\nmortality, as discussed later. Additional\nknowledge and a greater awareness of the\nissue among professionals in a wide range of\nfields are needed to facilitate earlier diagno-\nsis and development of effective treatment\nstrategies. Thus, a review of the most essen-\ntial information is useful.\nEndothelial dysfunction\nin diabetes mellitus\nDiabetes mellitus and cardiovascular\ndisease\nIn individuals with type 2 diabetes, there is\naccelerated development and an increased\nincidence of atherosclerotic vascular lesions.\nFurthermore, cardiovascular disease, such\nas myocardial infarction and stroke, is 2 to 4\ntimes more prevalent in patients with type 2\ndiabetes than in non-diabetic individuals.\nEven with impaired glucose tolerance only,\nthere is an increased risk of\nDiabetic complications affect many\norgans and are responsible for most\nillnesses and deaths associated with diabetes.\nThey can be categorized as vascular or\nnon-vascular complications. Vascular com-\nplications can be microvascular (microangio-\npathy), such as retinopathy or nephropathy,\nor macrovascular (macroangiopathy),\nincluding cerebrovascular disease, coronary\nartery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular\ndisease. Non-vascular complications include\nforms of chronic neuropathy. In addition to\nhyperglycaemia, other factors, including\nhypertension, dyslipidemia, genetic factors,\nglucose oscillations, hypoglycaemia, obesity,\ncoagulopathy and smoking, contribute to the\nThe leading cause of death in people with\ndiabetes is heart and blood vessel disease\n(70\u00ad80%). The risk of heart and blood vessel\ndisease is 8 times higher in people with\ndiabetes. Patients with diabetes without\nprevious heart attacks are at higher risk of\na heart attack as compared with non-\ndiabetic patients who have previously had\na heart attack. Diabetes is the most common\nrisk factor for stroke, especially in women\n(5.4 times higher risk). Diabetic retinopathy\nis a significant cause of blindness, nephro-\npathy is the most important cause of kidney\nfailure, and diabetic foot is the primary\ncause of lower extremity amputations and\nthe most important cause of disability in\nEndothelial dysfunction\nNormal cells can adapt to changes in the\nenvironment in multiple ways, such as\nthrough changes in the amount and effect-\niveness of enzymes, receptors and other\nproteins, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, atrophy\nand metaplasia. However, when the capacity\nof cells to adapt is exceeded and homeostasis\nis disturbed, there is damage that can ini-\ntially manifest as dysfunction and later as\nmorphological changes. Cell dysfunction\ncan become evident as an increase, a reduc-\ntion or an interruption of normal function in\na tissue. Irreversible disorders can cause cell\nThe endothelium is the monolayer of cells\nthat covers the inner vascular wall. It serves\nmultiple functions that are indispensable for\nthe maintenance of vascular homeostasis,\nincluding regulation of vessel integrity, vas-\ncular tone and blood flow, vascular growth\nand remodeling, cell adhesion, angiogenesis,\ntissue growth and metabolism, immune\nresponses, hemostasis and vascular perme-\nability.17 Damage to endothelial cell func-\ntion, or ``endothelial dysfunction,'' leads to\nleukocyte adhesion and migration and loss\nof endothelial antiaggregation properties,\nresulting in platelet aggregation and prevail-\ning of vasoconstrictive substances.\nInflammatory mediators, including tumor\nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-1\n(IL-1) and endotoxin, modify and activate\nendothelial cell functions. This leads to\nadhesion molecule expression on the surface\nof endothelial cells (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-\nselectin and P-selectin), cytokine and che-\nmokine secretion and reactive oxygen spe-\ncies production, which causes LDL-\ncholesterol oxidation in the subendothelial\nlayer. Inflammatory stimuli reinforce the\notherwise minimal connection between\nleukocytes and endothelial cells, and this\nprocess is regulated by membrane expres-\nsion of adhesion molecules. Thus, the endo-\nthelium actively participates in various\nstages of the inflammatory response.18\u00ad24\nDamaged endothelium produces less\nnitric oxide (NO) with a consequently\nreduced or paradoxical effect of vasodila-\ntors, enhanced activity of vasoconstrictors\nand increased platelet aggregation.\nEndothelial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus\nleads to reduced NO production through\ndecreased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)\nexpression, eNOS uncoupling (a process\nwhere eNOS is converted from an NO-\nproducing enzyme to one generating super-\noxide anions) as a result of oxidative stress\nand accelerated NO breakdown (mostly\ncaused by reactive oxygen species).17 In\naddition to the reduced NO bioavailability,\nendothelial dysfunction in diabetes also\nmanifests through a number of other mech-\nanisms, including decreased endothelial\nprostacyclin secretion, altered endothelium-\ndependent hyperpolarizing factor-mediated\nresponses, impaired fibrinolytic ability,\nincreased procoagulant activity, overpro-\nduction of growth factors and extracellular\nmatrix proteins, increased endothelial per-\nmeability and increased oxidative stress.17,25\nThe described mechanisms are also involved\nin the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic car-\nizes the primary endothelial dysfunction\ntraits.\nThe effect of hyperglycaemia\nAn important consequence of hypergly-\ncaemia is increased non-enzymatic protein\nglycation. Through a series of reactions,\nstable glycated proteins form within the cell,\non the cell surface, in the extracellular\nmatrix and in the blood stream. The conse-\nquences are changes in enzyme activity,\nregulatory molecule binding, protein cross\nlinking, proteolysis susceptibility, macro-\nmolecular recognition, endocytosis and\nimmunogenicity, resulting in alterations in\ndifferent physiological processes and the\ndevelopment of chronic diabetic complica-\ntions. Haemoglobin glycation is the earliest\nand best-studied example of protein glyca-\ntion. Determination of haemoglobin glyca-\ntion has practical applications, because it\nindicates the degree of chronic hypergly-\nformation of advanced glycation end prod-\nucts, hyperglycaemia leads to vascular\ndamage in various cells of the vessel wall.\nThis is mediated through mechanisms,\nincluding increased flux of glucose and\nother sugars through the polyol pathway,\nelevated expression of the receptor for\nadvanced glycation end products and its\nactivating ligands, protein kinase C isoform\nactivation, hexosamine pathway overactiva-\ntion and increased reactive oxygen species\nInsulin and vascular dysfunction\nInsulin resistance, the defining mechanism\nunderlying type 2 diabetes, exists when insu-\nlin levels are higher than expected relative to\nglucose levels. Thus, in vivo insulin resistance\nis tethered to hyperinsulinaemia.31 Insulin\nleads to increased eNOS activation (and NO\nproduction) through the phosphatidylinosi-\ntol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Insulin\nresistance in diabetes attenuates this physio-\nlogical process and suppresses normal NO\nsecretion.5 Insulin infusion in healthy human\nsubjects stimulates vasodilation and increases\nperipheral tissue blood flow, whereas this\neffect is blunted in patients with diabetes and\ninsulin resistance.4 Furthermore, insulin acti-\nvates the mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated\nkinase pathway and promotes endothelin-1\nexpression and cellular proliferation.32\nUnder physiological conditions, the PI3K/\nAkt pathway prevails in vasomotor regula-\ntion. Under insulin resistant conditions, there\nis a selective deficiency in this pathway\n(leading to endothelial dysfunction), while\nNormal endothelial function Endothelial dysfunction Mechanisms\nNormal NO bioavailability and\nvasodilation\n#NO bioavailability and\nvasodilation\n#eNOS, eNOS uncoupling,\n\"NO breakdown (ROS)\n\"Prostacyclin #Prostacyclin #Prostacyclin synthase\n\"EDHF-mediated responses #EDHF-mediated responses\nNormal vasoconstrictor levels \"Vasoconstriction \"ET-1, PGH2\nand other endothe-\nlium-derived factors\nAnti-inflammatory properties Pro-inflammatory properties \"Adhesion molecules,\n\"cytokines\n#Endothelial permeability \"Endothelial permeability\nAnti-thrombotic properties Pro-thrombotic properties \"PAI-1, vWF, P-selectin,\n\"platelet activity\nNormal fibrinolytic activity #Fibrinolytic activity\n#Oxidative stress \"Oxidative stress \"NADPH oxidase, eNOS uncou-\npling, other enzymes,\n#antioxidant defense\nAnti-atherogenic properties Pro-atherogenic properties \"FFA, \"LDL oxidation,\n\"AGE \u00fe above described\nmechanisms\nNormal quantity and quality of\nEPC\n#Quantity and quality of EPC Weak bone marrow mobilization,\n#proliferation, #survival, \"ROS\nNormal vascular structure and\nangiogenesis\nRemodelling Changes in growth factors, inflam-\nmation, matrix proteins, etc.\nEDHF: endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1;\nvWF: von Willebrand factor; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; PGH2\n: prostaglandin H2\n; EPC: endothelial progenitor\ncells; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; AGE: advanced glycation end products; LDL: low-density\nlipoprotein; FFA: free fatty acids.\nMAPK pathway signaling is unaffected,\nleading to unfavorable effects, including fur-\nther promotion of hyperinsulinaemia and\natherogenesis.17,32 The hyperinsulinaemic\nstate is associated with a number of import-\nant pathophysiological processes, such as\nelevated free fatty acid and pro-inflammatory\nmediator levels.31 The link between endothe-\nlial dysfunction and insulin resistance is also\nevident in intervention studies that demon-\nstrate improved endothelial function follow-\ning treatments that improve insulin\nsensitivity.

The improvement in gly-\ncaemic control also slowed the deterioration\nof existing complications. The study results\nindicated no significant changes in macro-\nvascular complications. Similar to the\nDiabetes Control and Complications Trial\nstudy, the United Kingdom Prospective\nDiabetes Study, which was conducted in\nbetes and lasted more than 10 years, sug-\ngested an interrelation between glycaemic\ncontrol and the development of diabetic\ncomplications. Although no statistically sig-\nnificant effect of blood glucose levels on\ncardiovascular complications was demon-\nstrated, there was a 16% reduction in myo-\ncardial infarctions. Improved blood glucose\ncontrol did not consequently reduce nor\nincrease mortality from macrovascular com-\nplications. Similar results regarding reduced\nmicrovascular complication risk were also\ndetermined in a small study on thin Japanese\npatients with type 2 diabetes (Kumamoto\nstudy).33\u00ad35 Firm evidence that improved\nglycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus\ncan reverse or prevent cardiovascular dis-\nease remains incomplete and requires large,\nlong-term clinical trials in patients with\ndiabetes at low risk utilizing modern treat-\nPhysiology of coronary\nmicrocirculation\nCoronary microvascular networks are cru-\ncial for matching local blood flow to tissue\nmetabolic demands by precise regulation of\nsmooth muscle tone, vessel diameter and\nsubstance transport.37,38 Although coronary\nmicrovessels can broadly be divided into\n``arterial microvessels'' (through which\nblood flows towards capillaries) and\n``venous microvessels'' or ``venules'' (those\nthat drain blood from capillaries), there are\nno uniform term definitions for the designa-\ntion of microvascular segments, such as\nsmall arteries, arterioles and venules.39\nClassification of microvessels based on\nstructural characteristics is somewhat arbi-\ntrary, with no abrupt demarcation in the\ntransition between small artery and arteri-\nole. Some studies define ``microvessels'' as\nFigure 1 illustrates the different microvessel\ncategories.\nOxygen extraction is almost maximal in\nthe coronary circulation, and therefore\nblood flow must increase proportionally to\nincreased oxygen demand. Myocardial\noxygen consumption increases by up to\nfour times during severe exercise compared\nwith consumption at rest.40 When oxygen\nconsumption is kept constant, coronary\nblood flow is constant and independent of\ncoronary artery pressure variations. In con-\ntrast, when pressure is kept constant, vari-\nations in oxygen consumption lead to linear\nflow variations.40 However, when tissue\nregions smaller than 1 g are considered,\nflow distribution is heterogenous.40 Precise\nregulation of functionally distinct micro-\nvascular categories (for example, capillaries\nand venules where water and solute are\nprimarily exchanged, or arterioles where\nvascular resistance is predominantly\nadjusted) is achieved with specialized mech-\nanisms.41 Neurogenic, hormonal, metabolic,\nmyogenic and flow (shear stress-induced)\nendothelial mechanisms control coronary\nvascular resistance at specific microvascular\nsites.40\u00ad42 Segments most sensitive to flow\nare coronary arterioles with diameters of\nsiveness was observed in small arterioles\n<30 mm appear to be most sensitive to\nmetabolic stimuli. Flow-induced dilatation\nis also a regulating mechanism in isolated\ncoronary venules and could be important\nduring arteriolar dilatation, when it would\nlimit the rise in capillary pressure that occurs\nwith decreased arteriolar resistance.41\nIntegration of multiple mechanisms could\nhypothetically form a system matching cor-\nonary blood flow to myocardial metabolic\ndemands. However, there are many\nunknown or incompletely understood fac-\ntors involved, including unclear precise\nmediators of the metabolic mechanisms\nthat have traditionally been attributed as\nFigure 1. Overview of different microvessel categories in the heart.\nArterial microvessels consist of a thin tunica intima, a thick tunica media composed of one to several layers of\nsmooth muscle cells (``arterioles'' possess 1\u00ad4 layers and are typically defined as <100\u00ad150 mm in diameter,\nwhereas ``large arterial microvessels'' possess 4\u00ad6 layers, can be >100\u00ad150 mm in diameter and can also be\ncalled ``small arteries'') and a tunica adventitia.39 Venous microvessels have thinner vascular walls compared\nwith those of arterial microvessels, with venules <50 mm in diameter and not possessing smooth muscle cell\nlayers. Smaller venules possess only endothelial cells and pericytes.39 From epicardial conduit arteries,\nnumerous arterial branches arise that contribute to perfusion of the outer two-thirds of the myocardium.\nPenetrating arteries pass through the outer myocardial layers without branching. Ultimately, in the inner one-\nthird of the myocardium, small branches arise from penetrating arteries to form the arterial plexus that\nperfuses the subendocardium.39\noxygen species, which are metabolites pro-\nduced in proportion to oxidative metabol-\nism, may also control coronary blood\nflow,42 a phenomenon that is incompletely\nunderstood.\nIn addition to adaptation to acute\nphysiological stresses, such as increased\nmyocardial metabolism, the coronary\nmicrocirculation can also adapt to chronic\nstresses. For example, exercise training\ninduces numerous adaptive changes that\nmay be responsible for a reduction in cor-\nonary heart disease.41 Exercise leads to\nincreased blood flow capacity and transvas-\ncular exchange capacity, possibly because of\nremodeling of the coronary vascular bed and\nalterations in vascular control. Exercise can\nalter microvascular responses to mechanical\nstimuli, such as stretch and flow, increase\nNO synthase levels in the coronary micro-\nvasculature and possibly alter coronary\nvascular permeability regulation.41\nStructural remodeling and angiogenesis are\nimportant vascular regulatory mechanisms\nin the coronary microcirculation,42 with\nstructural changes ultimately affecting\nfunction.\nIt should be noted that the coronary\nvascular system is also impacted by cardiac\ncontraction forces. The average coronary\nper beat blood volume is not only dependent\non perfusion conditions, such as the level of\nvasodilation and perfusion pressure, but it\nalso depends on changes due to cardiac\ncontraction and is lower in systole compared\nwith diastole. Because coronary inflow\noccurs primarily in diastole, time-averaged\nintramural blood volume lessens with\nincreasing heart rate (which causes shorten-\ning of diastole).40 The contraction process\ndynamics include consequent variations in\ncompressive forces, coronary artery pressure\nand intramural blood volume. Furthermore,\nvessels are stretched and shortened during\nthe heart cycle, and the diameter of the\nelastic vessels changes as a function of the\ntransmural pressure difference across the\nvascular wall. This makes the coronary\nvascular system very complex40 and analyses\nof functional regulation of the microcircu-\nlation more challenging.\nPathophysiologic mechanisms (schemat-\nically illustrated in Figure 2) possibly impli-\ncated in coronary microvascular function\ndisorders include: 1. endothelial dysfunction\n(reduced bioavailability of NO, increased\noxidative stress and increased endothelial\nrelease of endothelin, thromboxane A2\nand\nprostaglandin H2\n), 2. smooth muscle cell\ndysfunction (primary impairment of smooth\nmuscle cell relaxation), 3. microvascular\nspasm/sympathetic dysfunction (augmented\nresponses to a-adrenoceptor activation) and\n4. altered microvascular remodelling.\nAdditional pathophysiological hypotheses\ninclude vascular rarefaction, extramural\ncompression, vascular wall infiltration,\nluminal obstruction, degraded endothelial\nsurface layer (for instance through damage\ncaused by reactive oxygen species, ischemia,\ninflammation or altered plasma compos-\nition), compromised conduction of signals\nalong the vessel wall and impaired metabolic\nBasic aspects of diabetic coronary\nmicrovascular dysfunction\nNO and arachidonic acid metabolites in\ndiabetic coronary microvascular\ndysfunction\nImpaired endothelium-dependent vasodila-\ntation has been demonstrated in various\nmicrovascular beds in animal models43 and\nin the microcirculation of humans with\ndiabetes.44 Diabetes mellitus is associated\nwith coronary microvascular dysfunction,\nattenuated vasodilation to various agonists\nand reduced coronary venous pO2\nIn humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus,\nreduced NO production, increased reactive\noxygen species generation and enhanced\nvasoconstrictor tone were related to\nimpaired endothelium-dependent vasodila-\ntion.46 Although baseline myogenic tone\nand resting membrane potential of coronary\narterioles were not affected by diabetes\nmellitus, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nmellitus impair human coronary arteriolar\ndilation to KATP\nopening, leading to\nreduced dilation to hypoxia.47 Several\nmodels of genetically altered mice have\nbeen utilized to elucidate the mechanisms\nunderlying altered endothelium-dependent\nvasodilation of coronary microcirculation.\nThe majority of the studies pointed to a role\nfor reactive oxygen species and their inter-\naction with vascular cell dilatory pathways.\nFor example, recovered acetylcholine-\nstimulated coronary artery vasodilation,\nincreased manganese-dependent superoxide\ndismutase expression and decreased nitro-\ntyrosine levels in hearts have been observed\nin diabetic db/db mice that were moderately\nexercised. These observations suggest that\nincreased reactive oxygen species produc-\ntion and nitrotyrosine levels in the heart are\nassociated with impaired endothelium-\ndependent coronary artery vasodilation.48\nAttenuated dilation to acetylcholine in type\n2 diabetic Lepr(db) mice appears to occur\nbecause of the interaction between Nuclear\nfactor-kappa B (NF-kB) and TNF-a signal-\ning, which induces inhibitor of nuclear\nfactor kappa-B kinase subunit beta\n(IKK-b) activation and increases oxidative\nstress.43 Similarly, in coronary microvessels\nfrom diabetic dogs, bradykinin and acetyl-\ncholine caused lesser increases in NO pro-\nduction than that in non-diabetic dogs.49\nFunctional studies of small coronary\narteries in a preatherosclerotic porcine\nmodel with type 2 diabetes characteristics\nFigure 2.

This may present an adaptive\nmechanism for reduction of the debilitating\neffects of diabetes on coronary blood flow,\nas demonstrated in human coronary arteri-\noles.45 However, impaired endothelium-\ndependent dilation in diabetes might also\nbe related to the release of vasoconstrictor\nmediators, such as increased 20-hydroxyei-\ncosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) production.\nThis may lead to the activation of reactive\noxygen species through an NADPH-depen-\ndent pathway,51 increased oxidative stress\nand overexpression of both COX-1 and\n-mediated contraction in\ndiabetic arteries53 and low-grade inflamma-\ntion.45 Hyperglycaemia increases COX-2\nexpression,54 arachidonic acid release and\nprostanoid production, all of which may\nmodify vasomotor tone.55\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated recep-\ntor-g, a regulator of lipid and glucose\nmetabolism, may play a role in diabetic\ncoronary microvascular dysfunction.3 It was\ndemonstrated that treatment of type 2 dia-\nbetic mice with rosiglitazone (peroxisome\nproliferator-activated receptor-g activator)\nincreased NO-mediated flow-dependent\ndilations of coronary arterioles by reducing\nvascular superoxide production. These\nchanges were associated with a favorable\nalteration of oxidant/antioxidant enzyme\nactivities.3\nDiabetes upregulates cytochrome P450\n(CYP) 4A isoforms and leads to elevated\ninhibitor HET0016 attenuates the develop-\nment of vascular dysfunction induced by\ndiabetes.57 In addition, recent findings sug-\ngest that insulin-stimulated vasodilator\neffects that are mediated by the insulin\nreceptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/PI3K/Akt/\neNOS pathway are impaired by 20-\nlevels in patients with diabetes and cardiac\nischemia are associated with dysfunction of\ncirculating endothelial progenitor cells and\nangiogenic capacity.58 In a glucose intoler-\nance model, elevated soluble epoxide hydro-\nlase expression might contribute to\nendothelial dysfunction through increased\ndegradation of epoxeicosatrienoic acids.59\nData from a diabetic model reveal a differ-\nent mechanism, specifically a shift in the\nbalance between 20-HETE and epoxeicosa-\ntrienoic acid production caused by changes\nReactive oxygen species and transient\nreceptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1)\nreceptor\u00admediated responses\nThe toxic effect of a chronic hyperglycaemic\nstate, as in diabetes mellitus, is a well-known\ngenerator of oxidative stress in all vascular\nbeds. A number of animal studies have\ndemonstrated deleterious effects of diabetes\nmellitus related to a hyperoxidative status\non cardiac endothelial function.62\u00ad64 While\nthe role of different potassium channels in\nvascular tone regulation in the coronary\nother pathways, including the TRPV1 recep-\ntor-activated pathway, are under investiga-\ntion. The TRPV1 protein is highly expressed\nin canine coronary arteries.67\nTo elucidate whether TRPV1 expression\nand/or function is altered by metabolic\nsyndrome, Bratz et al. used coronary arteries\nfrom lean and obese Ossabaw miniature\nswine. Capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, caused\ndose-dependent relaxation, which was\ninhibited by capsazepine (a TRPV1 antag-\nonist), endothelial denudation, potassium\nchannel inhibitors and NOS inhibition.\nThe capsaicin effect was blunted in pigs\nwith metabolic syndrome. TRPV1 expres-\nsion and capsaicin-mediated divalent cation\ninflux was significantly higher in the lean\nswine group. This observation suggests that\nTRPV1 channels are functionally expressed\nin the coronary circulation and mediate\nendothelium-dependent vasodilation with\nmechanisms that include NO and potassium\nIn db/db diabetic mice, capsaicin-\nmediated increased coronary blood flow\nwas attenuated, while control C57BKS/J\nmice displayed an increased vasodilator\nresponse in a capsaicin dose-dependent\nmanner. Mice lacking TRPV1 [TRPV1(-/-)]\ndid not display changes in coronary flow.\nCapsazepine and the NOS inhibitor L-\nNAME blocked the response in control\nmice. In addition, pH changes (from pH\n7.6 to pH 6.0) caused relaxation of previ-\nously contracted coronary arteries with a\nthromboxane mimetic, but this effect was\nsignificantly less in the TRPV1(-/-) and db/\nl-NAME and the large conductance cal-\ncium-sensitive potassium channel inhibitor\niberiotoxin inhibited capsaicin-dependent\nrelaxation in pressurized coronary vascula-\nture. This observation indicates that TRPV1\ncouples metabolic needs of the myocardium\nwith coronary blood flow via large conduct-\nance calcium-sensitive potassium channels\nand the NO pathway.69\nDelloStritto et al.70 analyzed the role of\nTRPV1 in coronary vascular reactivity in an\n-regulated environment in a mouse\nmodel of diabetes. The wild type C57BKS/\nJ (WT) mice responded with coronary blood\nflow vasodilatation in an H2\ndose-depen-\ndent manner, while this response was\nblocked by the TRPV1 antagonist\nbetic mice, H2\nvasodilative responses\nwere significantly inhibited. WT, but not\ndb/db or TRPV1(-/-), mice displayed\nin the presence of H2\n. Acute H2\nexpos-\nure potentiated capsaicin-mediated vasodi-\nlative responses in WT mice, while extended\nexposure attenuated this effect.\nElectrophysiological experiments that\nincluded bovine aortic cells and isolated\nmouse coronary endothelial cells con-\nfirmed the role of TRPV1 in coronary\nmicrocirculation. Considering the results of\nthis study, it appears that prolonged H2\nexposure impairs TRPV1-dependent coron-\nary vascular signaling and can be related\nto coronary endothelial dysfunction in\ndiabetes.\nBased on these studies, it is apparent that\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes,\nwhich occur combined in metabolic syn-\ndrome, can underlie pathologic changes in\nthe coronary circulation.\nClinical aspects of coronary\nmicrovascular changes in patients\nwith diabetes\nDiabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease with\nrapidly increasing prevalence. Sedentary\nlifestyle, ageing, overfeeding and obesity\nlead to diabetes mellitus and result in over\n80% of cardiovascular deaths among these\npatients.71 Clinical and experimental studies\nhave demonstrated compromised cardiac\nfunction as a result of altered myocardial\nmetabolism caused by diabetes, with a mis-\nmatch of myocardial supply and demand.72\nCardiovascular consequences of diabetes are\natherosclerotic epicardial CAD and cardio-\nmyocyte and myocardium changes.\nDiabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardio-\nvascular disease, independent of age, hyper-\ntension, obesity and hyperlipidemia.73 The\nterm diabetes-associated cardiovascular dys-\nfunction includes a number of myocardial\nchanges, including functional, metabolic\nSubclinical level of disease\nThe subclinical level of diabetes-induced\nmyocardial changes can be categorized as\natherosclerotic changes of epicardial coron-\nary arteries or microvascular coronary\nendothelial dysfunction with cardiomyocyte\nchanges (schematically illustrated in\nFigure 3).

A better understanding of\nthese processes may help in the development\nof novel approaches for early detection of\nresulting cardiovascular complications and\neventual diabetic cardiomyopathy\nCoronary microvascular disease diagno-\nsis requires the exclusion of abnormalities\nand significant stenosis of major epicardial\nvessels by coronary angiography. In patients\nwith suspected coronary microvascular dis-\nease, attempts should not be made to rely\non this exclusion, but rather to obtain\nobjective evidence of coronary microvascu-\nlar disease.\nNon-invasive diagnostic methods\nMicrovascular disease should be suspected\nwhen chest pain persists after physical effort\nand shows slow or no response to short-\nacting nitrates.85,86 Transthoracic Doppler\nechocardiography (TTDE) is an initial\nscreening method to detect significant\nmicrocirculation impairment. It allows the\nmeasurement of coronary blood flow (CBF)\nvelocity in the left anterior descending\nartery. With this method, coronary micro-\nvascular dilatator function is calculated as\nthe ratio of diastolic CBF velocity at peak\nvasodilatation to CBF velocity at rest.87 A\nratio < 2.0 in response to adenosine or\ndipyridamole strongly suggests coronary\nmicrovascular dysfunction. Mild coronary\nmicrovascular dysfunction may not be iden-\ntified by TTDE, and microvascular dysfunc-\ntion can be assessed only in the left anterior\ndescending artery perfusion area, because\nother coronary arteries are not well\nContrast stress echocardiography is pro-\nmising for coronary microvascular disease\ndetection and may be used when TTDE\nresults are inconclusive or unreliable.87\nYag\n mur et al.88 demonstrated impaired lon-\ngitudinal systolic strain on speckle tracking\nechocardiography despite normal systolic\nparameters. 2-D-speckle tracking echocardi-\nography is a feasible technique that allows\nthe evaluation of left ventricular regional\nsystolic function in patients with micro-\nvascular dysfunction. This study contributed\nto our understanding of the relationship\nbetween fiber architecture, myocardial func-\ntion and coronary microvascular disease.\nLeung et al.89 demonstrated that left ven-\ntricle contractile reserve with low dose\ndobutamine echocardiography can be used\nto non-invasively estimate the index of\nmicrocirculatory resistance. Impaired con-\ntractile reserve in this study indicated coron-\nary microvascular dysfunction.\nRegional left ventricle myocardial perfu-\nsion reserve (ratio between maximal hyper-\nemic and basal myocardial blood flow) can\nbe estimated in patients with diabetes with\nsingle photon technology, which is broadly\navailable.

Currently, this is still a complex,\nexpensive and time-consuming technique for\nwidespread utilization.91,92 Positron emis-\nsion tomography (PET) allows measure-\nment of CBF per gram of myocardial\ntissue and can be used to identify coronary\nmicrovascular dysfunction.93 However, cor-\nonary flow reserve (ratio of maximal hyper-\nemic to basal CBF) may be preserved in mild\nforms of coronary microvascular disease.\nPET can also detect coronary vasomotor\nabnormalities caused by microvascular dis-\nPET/CT is emerging as an important as well\nas rapid non-invasive assessment method of\nmicrovascular function and structure in\nasymptomatic patients with type 2 dia-\nbetes.96 Some authors consider PET as the\ngold standard for myocardial flow reserve\nmeasurements and myocardial viability\nThe objective documentation of myocar-\ndial ischemia in patients with microvascular\ndysfunction can be obtained with the use of\nspecific tests. For example, the assessment of\nlipid peroxidation products in the coronary\nsinus after stress tests represents a sensitive\nmethod to detect myocardial ischemia in\npatients with microvascular dysfunction.87\nUnfortunately, this method is invasive and\ncannot be proposed for routine application.\nCoronary magnetic resonance spectroscopy\nmay detect phosphorus metabolism\nabnormalities after a stress test,98 but this\nmethod is very expensive and can only detect\nanterior heart wall defects.\nInvasive diagnostic methods\nIn patients with unstable microvascular\nangina, a standard ECG record can detect\nnewly developing abnormalities, including\nST depression, T-wave inversion and\nelevation of cardio-sensitive markers, espe-\ncially troponin. Unstable microvascular\nangina diagnosis requires exclusion of cor-\nonary spasm and coronary thrombosis.\nPatients with coronary spasm typically\nhave chest pain after physical effort and\ndisplay ST elevation in an ECG.\nThrombosis is unlikely when there is no\nevidence of atherosclerosis or coronary\nabnormalities, but some conditions can be\nassociated with thrombus formation in ves-\nsels without atherosclerosis.99 Coronary\nmicrovascular disease diagnosis can be con-\nfirmed with vasoconstrictor agents, such as\nergonovine and acetylcholine, and should be\nperformed during coronary angiography.\nAn induction of angina and ST changes\nwithout epicardial vasoconstriction would\nbe diagnostic for coronary microvascular\ndisease.\nCoronary angiography allows us to assess\nand analyze coronary microvascular function\nwith several different methods. Some of these\nmethods include thermodilution, the gas\nwashout method and intracoronary Doppler\nwire flow. All of these methods allow CBF\nand coronary flow reserve quantification.\nIntravascular Doppler ultrasonography\n(IVUS) allows us to visualize the state of\narterial walls and to detect atherosclerotic\nplaques that cannot be adequately observed\non angiograms. IVUS is a method that is\nprimarily applied in the intracoronary rec-\nording of CBF using Doppler and pressure\nwires and allows exact measurement of CBF\nvelocity. Using intracoronary Doppler and\npressure sensors we can determine the index\nof microvascular resistance. This is defined as\nthe distal coronary pressure multiplied by the\nexact transit time of reactive hyperemia.100\nIt should not be forgotten that a\n``normal'' coronary angiogram does not\nnecessarily rule out an atherosclerotic\nplaque. With IVUS we can detect non-\nobstructive atherosclerotic plaques in cor-\nonary arteries. Often in diffuse CAD, the\nwall thickens outward without forming\nnotches in the lumen. In patients who have\ndiffuse epicardial artery disease but without\nsignificant proximal stenosis, fractional flow\nreserve analysis can be performed.\nFractional flow reserve is the ratio between\nthe distal coronary pressure and the aortic\npressure during maximal coronary vasodila-\ntation. A value <0.8 is suggestive of hemo-\ndynamically significant plaques that are\nperhaps not yet obstructive. Thus, we can\navoid erroneously attributing patients'\nsymptoms to microvascular dysfunction.101\nCoronary angiography allows indirect\nevaluation of microvascular function by\nmeasurement of angiographic indexes.\nMyocardial blush is the myocardial opacifi-\ncation that results from injection of dye into\nthe coronary circulation. We can determine\nthe myocardial blush grade by counting the\nnumber of heart cycles required for the dye\nto fade out, which depends on the microcir-\nculatory resistance to contrast passage and\nmyocardial blush score is the sum of the\nmyocardial blush grade of each coronary\nterritory and defines the overall microvascu-\nThe TIMI frame count (TFC) can be\ncalculated according to the number of\nframes that are required for contrast to\nreach the standardized distal coronary\nartery landmark and using a correction\nfactor that depends on vessel length.

Reduced coronary\nflow reserve was significantly more common\nin patients with diabetes, particularly those\nwith concomitant albuminuria, than in con-\ntrol subjects, suggesting that a common\nmicrovascular impairment is occurring in\nmultiple microvascular beds. Di Carli and\ncoworkers measured myocardial blood flow\n(using PET with N-13 ammonia as the flow\ntracer) at rest during adenosine-induced\nhyperaemia and in response to a cold pres-\nsor test in healthy control subjects and\npatients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes\nwho were free of overt cardiovascular com-\nplications. They confirmed markedly\nreduced endothelium-dependent (adeno-\nsine-induced hyperaemia) and -independent\n(cold pressor test) coronary vasodilator\nfunction in subjects with diabetes, which\nwere similarly reduced in both type 1 and\ntype 2 diabetes. The differences compared\nwith control subjects persisted after adjust-\ning for diabetes mellitus duration, insulin\ntreatment, metabolic abnormalities and\nautonomic neuropathy. The data suggest\nan important pathogenetic role of chronic\nhyperglycaemia in diabetic vascular dys-\nfunction.105 An impaired vasodilator\nresponse of coronary resistance vessels to\nincreased sympathetic stimulation was asso-\nciated with diabetic autonomic neuropathy\nand related to the degree of sympathetic\nnerve dysfunction.106 Separate studies in\nyoung patients with type 1 diabetes without\ncoronary heart disease suggested impair-\nment of coronary vascular reactivity, as\ndetermined by PET and H2\nO measurements\nof myocardial blood flow at rest and after\ndipyridamole administration.107 In patients\nwith type 2 diabetes, similar measurements\n(but using PET and N-13 ammonia)\nrevealed reduced myocardial flow reserve.108\nMyocardial blood flow at rest was\ncomparable between healthy controls and\npatients with type 2 diabetes, whereas myo-\ncardial blood flow after dipyridamole\nadministration was significantly lower in\npatients with diabetes.108 Moreover, myo-\ncardial flow reserve was inversely correlated\nwith average haemoglobin A1C for 5 years\nand fasting plasma glucose levels, implying\nthat glycaemic control is related to coronary\nmicrovascular function.108 In patients with\ntype 2 diabetes, application of the SPECT\nmethod also documented the presence of\nmicrovascular dysfunction, which was\nhomogeneously distributed throughout the\nwalls of the left ventricle and most fre-\nquently not associated with reversible per-\nfusion defects.90 Invasive studies in patients\nwith diabetes with angiographically normal\ncoronary arteries and normal left ventricular\nsystolic function demonstrated impaired\ncoronary vascular reserve (measured by\nintracoronary Doppler with an intracoron-\nary maximally vasodilating dose of papa-\nverine) and acetylcholine-induced coronary\nvasodilation.109 These coronary microcircu-\nlatory alterations in diabetes may contribute\nto progressive myocardial deterioration and\nDMCMP\nDMCMP is a multifactorial disease and a\nresult of complex pathophysiologic pro-\ncesses.74 The impact of diabetes on athero-\nsclerotic vascular disease has been well\nestablished, but non-ischemic heart failure\nin patients with diabetes has received less\nattention.81 DMCMP is defined as struc-\ntural and functional abnormalities of the\nmyocardium in patients with diabetes who\nhave no coronary disease or\nFrom a histological perspective,\nDMCMP is characterised by the loss of\nnormal microvessels, extracellular matrix\nremodelling, capillary basement membrane\nthickening, interstitial and perivascular\nfibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy inde-\npendent of hypertension and cardiomyocyte\nreported that both men and women with\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus have increased left\nventricle mass and wall thickness,112 because\nhyperinsulinaemia as a result of insulin\nresistance can act as a growth factor.75\nObesity is an additional risk factor in type\n2 diabetes mellitus, where increased intra-\nmyocardial lipid levels act as lipotoxic\ndeposits that can contribute to cell death\nvia as of yet unexplained mechanisms and,\nfrom a clinical point of view, lead to dia-\nAfter myocardial infarction, the diabetic\nmyocardium possesses reduced compensa-\ntory mechanisms to restore cardiac function\nbecause of a complex set of intra- and extra-\nmyocardial factors.115 From a clinical per-\nspective, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus\ndiffer in aetiology, clinical presentation and\nmetabolic profiles with adverse clinical pres-\nentation. However, the two types share\nmany features of cardiomyopathy.81\nSystolic dysfunction is usually predominant\nin type 1 diabetes, where autoimmunity\npredisposes to a dilative phenotype and\nheart failure with reduced ejection fraction,\nor is related to atherosclerotic coronary and\nchronic ischemic heart diseases.116 Coronary\nmicrovascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes\nis predominantly the result of hypergly-\ncaemia, lipotoxicity and hyperinsulinaemia.\nThis occurs independently or in combin-\nation with other risk factors and leads\nprimarily to diastolic dysfunction, concen-\ntric left ventricle remodelling and clinical\npresentation of heart failure with preserved\nejection fraction. Furthermore, there is a\nprogressive problem manifesting in myocar-\ndial stiffness (impaired relaxation and pas-\nsive filling) and restrictive pattern\ndevelopment, with or without subclinical\nlevels of depressed left ventricle systolic\nhave the same myocardial results, including\ncoronary microvascular rarefaction and\nadvanced glycation end-product\nDMCMP is highly prevalent in asymp-\ntomatic patients with type 2 diabetes.\nScreening and early detection of myocardial\nchanges may be crucial for slowing heart\nfailure development and progression. Thus,\nearly determination of myocardial manifest-\nations can have major implications for\nprognosis in patients with diabetes. The\nmost sensitive test for cardiac systolic and\ndiastolic function is transthoracic echocar-\ndiography.119 Schwanell and coworkers\ndemonstrated that diastolic left ventricular\ndysfunction is a first sign of myocardial\nchanges even in younger patients with\nnormal systolic function detected by trans-\nthoracic echocardiography.120 Poirer and\ncoworkers confirmed this finding in male\npatients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.\nThe authors used the Valsava manoeuvre\nand pulmonary venous recordings, together\nwith a standard echocardiographic transmi-\ntral left ventricular filling pattern of abnor-\nmal relaxation and/or pseudonormal filling,\nto unmask pseudonormal patterns of ven-\ntricular filling.121 Tissue Doppler imaging,\nwhich can measure myocardial tissue velo-\ncities in the longitudinal direction, is more\nsensitive for the detection of left ventricular\ndysfunction. The peak early diastolic myo-\ncardial velocity reflects global left ventricu-\nlar diastolic dysfunction.81 Additional\nechocardiographic tools include strain echo-\ncardiography, in which measurement of\nglobal longitudinal strain can detect myo-\ncardial abnormalities before left ventricular\nejection fraction declines.122\nPrognosis\nA clear strategy for prevention or treatment\nof diabetes-induced/related cardiomyopathy\nand, consequently, a prognosis have not yet\nbeen established.81 The increasing number\nof both basic research and clinical studies,\nparticularly those that develop novel ima-\nging techniques, are promising for detection\nof early microvascular functional changes\nand early changes in the myocardium in\ndiabetes. Interestingly, there is evidence that\npatients with diabetes with a preserved\ncoronary flow reserve have cardiac event\nrates similar to those of non-diabetic\npatients.\\123 Additionally, among diabetic\npatients without evident CAD, individuals\nwith impaired coronary flow reserve (below\nthe median) have mortality rates compar-\nable to non-diabetic patients with prior\nCAD (cardiac death rate 2.8 vs. 2.0% per\nyear).123 This strongly implies that it is\ncrucial to focus on the development and\nutilization of therapeutic strategies that will\npreserve normal coronary microvascular\nfunction in patients with diabetes.\nCortigani et al.124 demonstrated that coron-\nary microvascular dysfunction before the\noccurrence of coronary artery involvement\nis an independent and strong predictor of\nadverse outcomes in patients with type 2\ndiabetes. They investigated Doppler-derived\ncoronary flow velocity reserve of the left\nanterior descending coronary artery in 144\npatients with type 2 diabetes who had chest\npain or angina-like symptoms, with pre-\nserved left ventricular systolic function and\nwithout flow-limiting stenoses on angiog-\nraphy. During 29 months of follow-up, 17\nhard events (five deaths and twelve nonfatal\nmyocardial infarctions) occurred, with a\n13.9% annual hard-event rate in patients\nwith a reduced coronary flow velocity\nreserve and 2.0% in patients with a higher\ncoronary flow velocity reserve. This finding\nillustrated the adverse effect of microvascu-\nlar dysfunction on prognosis, while nonob-\nstructive CAD was not an independent\npredictor.124 Impaired coronary micro-\nvascular function was also implicated in a\npoor prognosis in the setting of acute myo-\ncardial infarction, where patients with dia-\nbetes have higher mortality rates.125 The\nlack of microvascular reperfusion following\nrevascularization in patients with diabetes\nwith myocardial infarction appears to be\none mechanism underlying a poor clinical\noutcome with major adverse cardiac events\n(death, reinfarction and congestive heart\nfailure) that occurs more frequently in\npatients with a lack of microvascular reper-\nEarly detection of diastolic dysfunction in\nyoung patients with diabetes is also useful\nfor detecting increased arrhythmia risk.120\nSubclinical levels of left ventricular dysfunc-\ntion, detected by strain echo and global\nlongitudinal strain, is another important\nparameter in asymptomatic patients with\ndiabetes, because it is associated with\nadverse outcomes122 and correlated with cor-\nonary microvascular dysfunction.127 A\nDMCMP diagnosis requires impaired glu-\ncose metabolism as well as the exclusion of\ncoronary, congenital, familial, infiltrative,\nviral, valvular and hypertensive heart dis-\nease.116 It should be clarified that heart\nfailure in patients with diabetes is not\nsimply an advanced stage of DMCMP but\nresults from a constellation of pathophysio-\nlogic processes.128 Many unanswered ques-\ntions need to be resolved, such as the issue of\npathophysiologic and clinical differences\nbetween type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus\nand the lack of any pathognomonic histo-\nlogic changes or imaging characteristics\nassociated with the diagnosis.128\nAdditionally, explanations of clinical mani-\nfestations of diabetes with respect to ath-\nerosclerotic coronary disease development\nor diabetic coronary microangiopathy/car-\ndiomyopathy development are required.\nThe big challenge in DMCMP diagnosis is\nhow to exclude hypertension/hypertensive\nheart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes\nand metabolic syndrome.\nPatients with comorbid heart failure and\ndiabetes mellitus represent a growing patient\npopulation. Future clinical studies in both\nheart failure and diabetes are encouraged to\nrefocus and differentially investigate the\nefficacy, safety and outcomes in patients\nwith heart failure and concomitant diabetes\nTreatment options\nThere is a little research evaluating treat-\nment options in patients with microvascular\ndysfunction. All patients should achieve\noptimal coronary risk factor control.\nTreatment options are empirical and arise\nfrom the experiences obtained from treat-\nment of ``classical'' CAD.\nAngiotensin is a potent vasoconstrictor.\nInhibition of its action, by angiotensin-con-\nverting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or angio-\ntensin receptor 1 (AT1\n) receptor blockade,\ncounteracts its influence and promotes vessel\ndilation. Pauly et al.129, in their study\ninvestigating quinapril in women with chest\npain without obstructive coronary disease\nand reduced coronary flow reserve <2.5,\nidentified significant changes in coronary\nflow reserve measured by intra IC Doppler.\nOther authors found similar results in their\nstudies, demonstrating improved stress test\nCombination of eplerenone with angiotensin\nII inhibition did not improve endothelial\ndysfunction in a study by Bavry on women\nwith signs and symptoms of ischemia in the\nsetting of nonobstructive CAD.132 However,\ninvestigation of microvascular dysfunction in\npatients with diabetes revealed that mineralo-\ncorticoid receptors might indeed be an\nappealing target to treat microvascular cor-\nonary dysfunction in diabetes.133 It was\ndemonstrated that interruption of the renin-\nangiotensin-aldosterone system with the use\nof ACE inhibitors improved coronary flow\nreserve (measured by quantitative PET) in\npatients with diabetes without ischemic heart\ndisease. This effect was further enhanced by\nCalcium channel blockade decreases\nmicrovascular spasm and tone, potentially\nimproving coronary flow reserve in patients\nwith coronary microvascular dysfunc-\ntion.135 Verapamil, nifedipine and lidofla-\nzine have been demonstrated to improve\n\u00a8 tsch and\ncolleagues did not determine that diltiazem\nimproves coronary flow reserve.138\nStatins have anti-inflammatory and anti-\natherogenic effects. Zhang et al.139 demon-\nstrated an improvement in coronary flow\nreserve and symptoms following fluvastatin\ntreatment. Eshtehardi et al.140 revealed\nimproved coronary flow reserve in patients\ntreated with atorvastatin. Additionally,\nsome studies have indicated that an inability\nto reach target cholesterol values with statin\ntherapy is associated with impaired coron-\nary flow reserve and a worse prognosis.141\nNO is a crucial player in endothelium-\ndependent mediation of coronary microvas-\nculature tone.142 In one study, the authors\nevaluated the role of sildenafil in symptom-\natic patients with coronary flow reserve <2.5\ncompared with patients with coronary flow\nreserve >2.5. Patients with reduced coron-\nary flow reserve displayed a significant\nincrease in coronary flow reserve.143\nConsidering the fact that L-arginine is a\nprecursor of NO, Bottcher et al.101 analysed\na one-time infusion of L-arginine in 25\npatients with chest pain without obstructive\nCAD or coronary microvascular dysfunc-\ntion by PET.

Dysfunction of this important\nsystem occurs in the context of diabetes\nmellitus, as a result of complex metabolic\ndisorders and pathophysiological mechan-\nisms, as determined in animal models and\nin human diabetic patients using non-inva-\nsive and invasive diagnostic and research\nprocedures. A reduced coronary flow\nreserve, consequent to a number of dam-\nages to normal endothelium-dependent and\nendothelium-independent vasomotion, in\nresponse to metabolic, hemodynamic,\nneural, hormonal and other stimuli, is a\nhallmark of diabetes-induced microvascular\ndysfunction. Failure of a normally func-\ntioning microvasculature, which precedes\nmorphological changes, significantly\nincreases mortality. It ultimately culminates\nin the development of DMCMP and asso-\nciated consequences.
