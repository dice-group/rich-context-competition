At the same time, the research and policy-based attempts to build resilience are increasingly under attack\nfor responsibilizing individuals and maintaining, rather than challenging, the inequitable structure of society. When adversities\nfaced by children and young people result from embedded inequality and social disadvantage, resilience-based knowledge has\nthe potential to influence the wider adversity context. Therefore, it is vital that conceptualizations of resilience encompass\nthis potential for marginalized people to challenge and transform aspects of their adversity, without holding them responsible\nfor the barriers they face. This article outlines and provides examples from an approach that we are taking in our research\nand practice, which we have called Boingboing resilience. We argue that it is possible to bring resilience research and practice\ntogether with a social justice approach, giving equal and simultaneous attention to individuals and to the wider system. To\nachieve this goal, we suggest future research should have a co-produced and inclusive research design that overcomes the\ndilemma of agency and responsibility, contains a socially transformative element, and has the potential to empower children,\nyoung people, and families.\n",

We then introduce our own\napproach and describe how Boingboing, our community of\npractice and social enterprise, supports the development of\nresilience research and practice that includes a strong inequal-\nities dimension (www.boingboing.org.uk). This includes con-\nducting academic research that advocates for people facing\nembedded societal inequalities, and is more focused on chal-\nlenging inequitable policy agendas; engaging in co-produced\nresearch containing socially transformative rather than solely\npersonally transformative elements; facilitating supported\nagency, and co-identifying and co-delivering responses to\nadversities (these may be addressing societal inequalities but\nmay more realistically include tackling prejudice, discrimina-\ntion, stigma, and stereotyping); and encouraging the research\ncommunity to be open to and prepared to undertake co-pro-\nduced research with groups that are perceived to be more\nchallenging to work with, and so are underrepresented in the\nliterature, but whose voices are equally or more important as\na result. We outline some examples and steps that we are tak-\ning toward our goal of consolidating resilience research and\npractice with a social justice approach in the support of chil-\ndren, young people, and families.\nResilience Research\nInitially spurred by observation of children who performed\nunexpectedly well in unfavorable circumstances, the first\nwave of resilience research sought to identify correlates of\nresilience with a focus on the unique qualities possessed by\nthe person or child (Masten, 2007). With resilience perceived\nas purely internal it is the individual who becomes tasked\n1University of Brighton, UK\n2Boingboing Community Interest Company, Brighton, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nAngie Hart, School of Health Sciences, University of Brighton, 264\nMayfield House, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9PH, UK.\nEmail: a.hart@brighton.ac.uk\nUniting Resilience Research and\nPractice With an Inequalities Approach\nAngie Hart1,2, Emily Gagnon2, Suna Eryigit-Madzwamuse1,2,\n Keywords\nresilience research, resilience practice, adversity, inequalities, social justice, Boingboing resilience\n2 SAGE Open\nwith compensating for their disadvantaged circumstances.\nThe second wave of research was interested in associations\nbetween correlates of resilience. Identification of risk and\nprotective factors as moderators and mediators of desirable\noutcomes expanded from the micro level of the individual to\nincorporate meso-level structures such as the family, school,\nand local community. The disadvantaged child is, from this\nperspective, no longer left wholly responsible for their out-\ncomes. In addition to their own attributes, caregivers,\nschools, neighborhoods, and other community organizations\nare all seen to play a part in influencing children's resilience.\nPutting the findings of the first two waves into practice, the\nthird wave of research focused on developing and testing\ninterventions. By endeavoring to improve outcomes for peo-\nple facing adversity, valuable learning around effectiveness\nand the role of context brought to attention both the dynamic\nnature of resilience processes, and the importance of culture\nin defining meaningful outcomes (Ungar, 2004). Applying\nwhat is defined as a positive outcome within mainstream\ncontexts to disadvantaged and marginalized groups may be\ninappropriate, and may lead to further exclusion. A focus on\nwider context and culture encourages a more systemic under-\nstanding of resilience in which the individual and his or her\nenvironment interact to produce, and construct, outcomes.\nPresently, the fourth wave is said to be in ascendance, as the\ndiscoveries of the first three waves become assimilated with\nmore sophisticated methods of investigation to develop a\nricher understanding of the multilevel, contextualized, and\ndynamic nature of resilience (e.g., Kassis, Artz, Moldenhauer,\nhuman ecology theory, an ecological understanding of resil-\nience places both the individual and the adversity within a\ndynamic multilevel context, where the impact of higher level\nfactors (e.g., social, economic, cultural) on factors proximal to\nchildren is emphasized (Cassen, Feinstein, & Graham, 2009).\nResilience itself is not a unified concept, and a long history\nof controversy means that there is little consensus on its pre-\ncise meaning. The only feature common to most definitions\nused by academic authors (see Table 1) is that resilience\nassumes adversity and is relative to it (Noltemeyer & Bush,\n2013). Exactly how resilience relates to adversity is conceptu-\nalized in a variety of ways, including helping people and com-\nmunities adapt to adversity, interact with it, or transform\naspects of it. A further complication is that the understanding\nof resilience and how it relates to adversity also depend upon\nthe nature of adversity (whether defined explicitly or implic-\nitly), which may or may not be related to social disadvantage.\nAs shown in Table 1, there are 17 subtly distinct concep-\ntualizations of resilience that we have counted in use by aca-\ndemic authors. Only three of these definitions include any\npotential to alter aspects of the wider adversity context,\nwhich are those of Hart, Gagnon, Aumann, and Heaver\nnotions of \"navigating\" and \"negotiating\" hold the potential\nto have some influence over the availability of resources for\nrocally influential relations between a person\" and his or her\npotential for the environmental context itself to be altered.\nHowever, presenting such exchanges as mutually beneficial\nfails to acknowledge the extent to which structural power\nimbalances consistently undermine the efforts of those fac-\ning the most profound disadvantage.\nFor the majority of definitions, resilience is anchored\nwithin an individual perspective, as it is the outcome which is\nmost often of interest. However, mechanisms that enhance\nresilience can be portrayed as residing both internally and\nexternally across the different levels of the system. This\nbreadth has important implications for assumptions about the\nrange of resources available when making resilient moves--\nsmall changes that can be made quickly and which acknowl-\nedgewheretheyoungpersonisstartingfrom.Whiledefinitions\nwhich conceive of resilience as internal draw largely upon a\nperson's psychological resources, more ecological approaches\nwhich encompass wider social factors also place responsibility\nupon institutions and society. The different understandings of\nresilience can be viewed within the context of how resilience\nresearch has developed in the \"four waves\" said to have shaped\nHealth Inequality and Resilience\nFollowing international recognition of the impacts of myriad\nsocial inequalities on health (e.g., Black, Morris, Smith, &\ntackle health inequalities has been steadily gaining influence\nas a political issue (Crombie, Irvine, Elliott, & Wallace,\nas \"disparities in health (and in its key determinants) that are\nsystematically associated with social advantage/disadvan-\nto talk meaningfully about health inequalities without talking\nabout ethics and social change.

Reacting to the tendency for neoliberal practices\nand policies to emphasize personal responsibility, while\nreducing levels of state services, cultural theorists, and social\ncritics consistently warn against an emphasis on promoting\nresilience as a vehicle for the responsibilization of individuals\nin place of social structures and governing institutions (e.g.,\nSchmidt, 2015; see Table 2). Little attempt has been made\nwithin the resilience literature to offer a response to this\nTable 1.

Criticisms of Resilience.\nAuthors Criticisms of resilience\nBottrell (2013) As the individualised \"can do\" notion of resilience, twinned with the privatisation of responsibilities, circulates\nin and flows from policy texts, it obscures historical and more recent structural inequalities that are\nfundamental barriers to the wellbeing of the poor and blames and penalises them for what are intertextually\ndeemed to be their failings, deficits and unhealthy dependencies.\nFriedli (2012, p. 1) . . . cannot adequately explain inequalities in mental health and wellbeing and may serve to disguise or distract\nfrom analysis of social structures that result in and maintain inequalities in power, wealth and privilege and\nthe impact of these inequalities on population mental health.\n. . . problematic operational consequences of \"resilience\"-driven policy for children's services; \"resilience\"\ndiscourse is permeated with frequently unacknowledged, value judgements and unquestioned assumptions;\nexcessive emphasis placed on individuals at the expense of social structure and social forces; apparent\naffinity between \"resilience\" and key neo-liberal tenets.\nA focus on resilience lends itself to overemphasis on the ability of those at the sharp end of economic\ndownturn to \"bounce back\": such a focus may be at the cost of understanding the nature of structural\nfactors that mean that \"bouncing back\" erodes resilient capability in the long term. . . . it depoliticizes and\nshifts responsibility for dealing with crisis away from those in power.\nIn focusing on apparent resilience, the costs of this resilience maybe rendered invisible and compounded over\ntime.\n. . . often focuses on psychological dispositions and personality traits as \"protective factors\" to the exclusion\nof analysis of the ways in which these are influenced by wider structural considerations.\n. . . tends to characterise as individual that which should be understood to be the result of collective effort.\n. . . urges us to turn from a concern with the outside world to a concern with our own subjectivity, our\nadaptability, our reflexive understanding, our own risk assessments, our knowledge acquisition and, above\nall else, our responsible decision making. . . . the way resilience works, certainly in Anglo-Saxon approaches,\nis to move fairly swiftly from thinking about the dynamics of systems to emphasising individual responsibility,\nadaptability and preparedness.\n. . . fits with a neoliberal mode of governmentality . . . the term lacks any proper philosophical meaning .\n. .

Structural\ndeterminants are no longer seen as \"the causes of the causes\"\n(Marmot, 2005) when they are being given equal status. This\npaves the way for internalized explanations to proliferate\nwhen lifestyle factors of behavioral origin appear to exert the\ngreatest influence over health and well-being outcomes\n(Department of Health, 2010b) and a focus on the level of the\nindividual and on higher level structural factors is presented\nas mutually exclusive. Responsibilization of individuals then\noccurs when structural accountability is denied and health\ninequalities come to be understood wholly as the result of\nthese individual choices and internal capacities.\nTo critics, a focus on resilience is seen as synonymous\nwith accepting this internalized explanatory model for health\ninequalities. Many resilience practitioners' and researchers'\nown understandings and experiences of processes of inequal-\nity and disadvantage are not congruent with this model.\nParticularly for those who identify as members of, or who are\nworking alongside, marginalized and disadvantaged groups,\nthe power of conditions of injustice to constantly undermine\ncaring work does not go unnoticed (Prilleltensky &\nPrilleltensky, 2005). And in our own projects the impact of\nHart et al. 5\nstructural challenges such as poor housing, transport, and\nincome is often highlighted in the \"basics\" category of our\nresilience framework (Hart, Blincow, & Thomas, 2007).\nBy contrast, abstracted from context, resilience takes on\nthe appearance of an independent variable separable from\nhigher level political and economic factors, and structural\naccountability becomes deniable, or at least ignorable. It is\nimportant to note that decontextualization of resilience also\nfundamentally ignores findings in resilience research, where\ncontext is cardinal for adaptive development (Ungar, 2012).\nAs the internalized resilience presented in policy bears little\nresemblance to the contextualized ecological models com-\nmon today, many resilience researchers and practitioners\nmay feel such critique is simply not relevant to their work,\neven though they may also not feel empowered to influence\nor challenge policy. Nevertheless, the problem of conflating\nexplanatory levels continues to be an issue.\nTo overcome these difficulties, Harrison (2012) argues that\nresilience might be best replaced with the concept of vulnera-\nbility. She suggests that while references to resilience empha-\nsize individual responsibility, the term vulnerability suggests\nmoral obligation for those in positions of power toward those\nwho are less powerful. Despite noting that vulnerability can\nimply people lack agency or are \"helpless victims\" (p. 99), she\nproposes that nevertheless the term is preferable, as, in contrast\nto resilience, vulnerability can be reduced by intervening in the\npolitical and economic allocation of resources. To resilience\nresearchers and practitioners working with disadvantaged and\nmarginalized individuals and communities, a focus on vulner-\nability in place of resilience is neither constructive nor ethical.\nFor marginalized populations, left abandoned to their own fate,\nthe only persons available to act upon their interests may well\nbe themselves and those in close proximity. Relying solely\nupon appeals to those in power to take on moral responsibility\nfor outcomes antithetical to their own interests remains an\ninsufficient course of action. Furthermore, such an approach\nrisks further marginalizing the most excluded groups in society\nwho are already poorly represented in research. And finally, by\nreplacing the concept of resilience with vulnerability, we risk\nmissing the ways in which some people can display vulnerabil-\nity, and at the same time strengths and capability (Zautra, Hall,\n& Murray, 2010). To illustrate the point from one of our own\nresilience-building research projects, a young woman who\nconsistently displayed considerable signs of distress and vul-\nnerability, often needing to leave meetings, also revealed that\nshe was a prominent and successful campaigner for mental\nhealth justice with a leading young people's mental health\ncharity, simultaneously showing strength and capability.\nWe propose that approaches should address both individ-\nual and structural elements that could make a difference,\nwhile acknowledging that the range of individual strategies\navailable may be largely determined by higher level political\nand economic factors (e.g., healthy eating may not be possi-\nble for someone on a low income due to the often higher\nprice of \"healthy\" foods than \"junk\" foods, and is not\nnecessarily about their individual conscious unwillingness to\nadopt a diet that the government tells them will be better for\ntheir health).\nResilience and Social Justice\nThe need for resilience research and practice development to\nengage with inequalities issues, and consequently the accom-\npanying critique, is becoming increasingly urgent (Ungar,\nGhazinour, & Richter, 2013). We propose that it is time for\nresilience to go beyond understanding how individuals cope\nwith adversity, to challenge the structures that create disad-\nvantages in the first place, and contribute to the development\nof a new wave of research that unites resilience research and\npractice development with social justice and activism. This\nprocess should invite the relocation of community members,\nresearchers, and policy makers in dynamic, multilevel pro-\ncesses. They can then seek to challenge the contributory\npractices that conflate higher level causes with proximal\ndeterminants.\nRecognizing that an unjust system unavoidably demands\nresilience because it relates to adversity, we suggest, as does\nBottrell (2009), that we begin by asking, (a) to what extent\nadversity will be tolerated, on the assumption that resilient\nindividuals can and do cope; and (b) how much adversity\nresilient individuals should endure before social arrange-\nments, rather than individuals, are targeted for intervention.\nHowever, we propose it is then necessary to consider broader\nshifts that might emerge from resilient moves at the individ-\nual/micro level, where there is potential for knowledge and\npractice to travel and spread and in the process target social\ndeterminants (Aranda & Hart, 2014). For instance, in our\nmental health\u00adrelated projects we identify stigma and dis-\ncrimination as key adversities faced by people with mental\nhealth problems, including people in our research team. Our\nwork involves considering ways to challenge that adversity\nin our daily lives, in our local communities, and at a national\nlevel by media campaigns and lobbying.\nIn addition, we notice that while a social justice\u00adoriented\nunderstanding of resilience has been emphasized in adult\npopulations (Brown, Payne, Dressner, & Green, 2010;\nremarkably few resilience authors or researchers explicitly\nattempt to incorporate inequalities perspective when work-\ning with children and young people (Hart, Blincow, &\n2015), and therefore there is a clear literature gap in\naddressing this in younger populations, for whom adults\nmay assume they know best.\nAt Boingboing, we use a strategic resilience-focused\nmethodology to support disadvantaged children, young peo-\nple (up to age 25 years), and their families in overcoming\nthe adversity they face in their lives (Hart, Blincow, &\nThomas, 2007), attempting to address this literature gap in\npractice. Our work has always been informed by an\n6 SAGE Open\ninequalities awareness and we have developed and applied\nthe concept of an \"inequalities imagination\" (Hart, Blincow,\n2003). We define adversity in relation to social disadvan-\ntage, and building on more recent and socio-ecologically\nwe construct resilience as, \"overcoming adversity, whilst\nalso potentially subtly changing, or even dramatically trans-\nforming, (aspects of) that adversity\" (Hart, Gagnon, et al.,\n2013). This creates the possibility for resilience-based inter-\nventions to have an emancipatory function (i.e., potential to\novercome adversity and oppression) and contribute toward\nsystemic change, for example by changing school policy to\ncultivate a more supportive and positive school culture that\ndiscourages discrimination, alongside targeted work to build\nresilience strategies in pupils to deal with stigma and bully-\ning. Current resilience interventions based on an ecological\nunderstanding (e.g., Daniel & Wassell, 2002; Kourkoutas &\nXavier, 2010) have the potential to target a number of\ndynamic processes at a range of levels and to overcome\ninequalities. Within the systemic approach, resilience\nresearchers should introduce specific directions for inter-\nventions and social policies, through identifying processes\nthat significantly mitigate the effects of adverse life condi-\ntions (Luthar & Brown, 2007). In most instances, however,\npracticalities of implementation result in interventions pre-\ndominantly targeting factors proximal to the individual,\nwhile "
