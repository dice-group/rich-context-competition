Completed follow-up data were\navailable for a proportion of these patients.\nAll patients met the following inclusion\ncriteria: (i) they suffered from simple hip\ndislocation that was not associated with\nother congenital malformations; (ii) they\ntreatment was started; (iii) they did not\nreceive treatment before hospitalization.\nInfants with dislocation of the hip caused\nby inflammation, spasticity, spinal bifida,\narthroereisis and Down's syndrome, and a\ndislocation of the hip associated with other\nmalformations, were excluded.\nEthic approval was provided by the\nEthics Committee of Shengjing Hospital of\nand written informed consent was provided\nby the legally authorized representatives of\nthe paediatric patients. Patients were divided\ninto three groups according to the\nacetabular index (AI) before treatment: a\ngroup. The acetabular index is the angle\nformed by a horizontal line connecting both\ntriradiate cartilages (Hilgenreiner's line) and\na second line connecting the acetabular roof\nand the acetabular centre. According to the\nTonnis classification of the radiological\ngrades of dislocation (Table 1),5 the patients\nwere divided into Tonnis types 1 to 4.\nStudy treatment\nIn all patients, traction was implemented\nbefore reduction. For patients suffering\nfrom Tonnis types 1 and 2 dislocations,\nthis included double lower limb suspension\nskin traction. For patients classified as\nTonnis types 3 and 4, femoral condyle\npinning horizontal bone traction was imple-\nmented with lower leg level skin traction\nwith a weight of 0.5 kg/6 months of age. The\ntraction duration was 2 weeks. For Tonnis\ntypes 3 and 4, an X-ray examination was\nperformed post-traction to ensure that the\nfemoral head centre was pulled below the\nupper margin of the acetabulum.\nAll patients in this study had a general\nanaesthetic, adductor tenotomy and closed\nreduction. General anaesthesia was admin-\nistered to achieve full muscle relaxation,\nand the supine position was adopted to\nabduct the hip joint on the affected side to\nsee that the adductor was tensioned.\nA scalpel was used, approaching the regio\npubica, to percutaneously cut off a large part\nof the adductor tendon to relieve the\ntension, and a gauze compression haemo-\nstasis and pressure dressing without suture\nwas applied. An assistant held the pelvis of\nthe infant patient in place. The surgeon\nflexed the hip and knee joints to 90 and\nslowly and gently implemented traction to\nmake the femoral head slide towards the\nfront inner side from the upper back of the\nacetabulum. The hip abduction and external\nrotation was then gradually completed. The\ngreater trochanter of the femur was pressed\nby the thumb of the other hand, so that the\nfemoral head could pass through the glenoid\nlabrum to produce a snap to enter the\nacetabulum, and in this way, the reduction\nwas accomplished. An intraoperative X-ray\nmachine was used to confirm the success of\nthe reduction. With both hips at 90 abduc-\ntion and external rotation and 110 of flex-\nion, through which the femoral head can\nreturn to the centre of acetabulum, dynamic\nlong leg casting fixation was used to fix the\nlimbs above the ankle joint and below the hip\njoint (with the ankle joint and hip joint\nexposed) and between the two lower legs,\nusing stick casting for the connection. Please\nnote that the casting at the thighs should be\nslightly loose to ensure that the hip joint can\nmovement during the fixing period. This only\nlimited the straightening and adduction\nmotion, which could easily cause hip joint\nTable 1.

Other motions of the hip joint\nwere not limited (Figure 1a).\nAfter discharge, patients were allowed to\nmake sitting, lying, standing, flexing, and\nextension motions. After 3 months of fix-\nation, they returned to the hospital for cast\nremoval. An adjustable abductions orthosis\nwas fitted that only fixes the thighs and\nallows the knee and ankle joints to move\nfreely and allows the hip joints to have a\ncertain amount of movement (Figures 1b\nand 1c). The orthosis was removed after a\nfurther 3 months, and then the infants were\nable to walk freely. At 6-month intervals, a\npelvic X-ray examination was taken to\nobserve the development of the acetabulum\nFigure 1. (a) Dynamic frog casting fixation. Abduction-adduction motion of hips is limited.

The clinical criteria for the\nassessment of the results at the final\nfollow-up visit were based on (i) McKay's\nfunction of the hip criteria;6 and (ii) an X-\nray imaging evaluation that was carried out\naccording to Severin's classification\n(Table 1).7 An evaluation of the presence\nof avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral\nhead was performed according to Salter's\ncriteria (Table 1).8 The patients were divided\ninto groups based on their AI and the\nTonnis type of radiological dislocation to\nform paired data. Data are presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD or n of patients. Two independ-\nent samples t-test was used for continuous\nvariables and 2-test was used for\ncategorical variables. A P-value < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nwere enrolled in the study. Of these, 246\npatients (339 hips) had complete follow-up\ndata available.

Patients were divided\ninto three groups according to their AI\nthe Tonnis classification, the patients were\ndivided into four groups: 51 hips with type 1,\northosis fixation, the result was satisfactory\nand no further treatment was received.\nSubluxation occurred or the joint space\nwas increased in 75 hips after the orthosis\nremoval. Ideal reduction was achieved for 42\nof 75 hips by prolonging the orthosis fix-\nation time (mean 9 months), but 33 hips\nrequired an operation, which included a\nSalter pelvic osteotomy (20 hips) or a\nPemberton acetabular arthroplasty (13\nhips). Prior to the final follow-up examin-\nation, the clinical results according to\nMcKay's hip function criteria were as fol-\nhips, `fair' in 37 hips and `poor' in 30 hips.\nThe `excellent' and `good' rate was 80.24%\nunderwent an operation.\nThe final radiological examination was\nperformed at the final follow-up visit. The\nX-rays were assessed according to the\nSeverin's classification and the findings\nhips at type II, 43 hips at type III, and 30\nhips at type IV. Favourable radiological\nresults (types I and II) were observed in 266\nwith Tonnis type 4 before reduction, were\ncomplicated by AVN.\nWhen the function of the hip (using\nMcKay's criteria) was analysed in patients\nwho were stratified according to their base-\nline Tonnis type before the reduction was\nundertaken, the `excellent' and `good' rate\nand the four groups were not significantly\ndifferent (Table 2). All 16 hips complicated\nby AVN had a Tonnis type 4 dislocation\nbefore reduction and the dislocation height\nwas > 2 cm higher than the acetabular rim.\nAccording to McKay's hip function criteria,\nseven of 16 hips with AVN were rated as\n`good', four hips were rated as `fair' and five\nhips were rated as `poor'. For the nine hips\nrated as `fair' or `poor', a Salter pelvic\nosteotomy was later performed.\nBefore treatment, the AI values in all hips\nwere > 30. There was no significant differ-\nence between the rates of `excellent' and\ngroups, but when compared with the > 40\ngroup, both groups demonstrated a signifi-\ncant difference (P < 0.05 for both compari-\nsons) (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nAfter many years of clinical research, it is\nnow recognized that the starting treatment\nage is one of the most important factors that\naffects the long-term outcome of conserva-\ntive treatment of DDH.9,10 As age and\ndislocation time increases, a series of patho-\nlogical changes occur to the anatomical\nstructure of the hip joint in patients with\nDDH, especially after the patients start to\nwalk.11 The grade of dislocation and the hip\njoint surrounding the soft tissue contracture\noften become more obvious.12,13 It has been\nreported that it is difficult to achieve satis-\nfactory development of the acetabulum in\nreductions undertaken after 18 months of\nage.14 The developmental potential of an\nTable 2.

The results of this present study\nshowed that for most 12- to 18-month-old\npatients, after the orthosis had been fixed for\n3 months, the femoral head and acetabulum\nhad achieved good development and were in\na satisfactory position. The mean follow-up\nof hips achieved McKay's hip functional\ncriteria of `excellent' and `good'. These\ncurrent findings suggest that the dynamic\nlong leg casting method is a good technique\nfor treating patients with DDH who are\nolder than 12 months. The position fixation\nused by us was the `frog' position with 90\nabduction and 110 of flexion, through\nwhich the femoral head can return to the\ncentre of the acetabulum. Meanwhile, due to\nthe existence of the femoral anteversion\nangle, the femoral head contacts the upper\nwall of the acetabulum, and after we imple-\nmented external rotations for hip joints, the\nfemoral head contacts the upper and pos-\nterior walls of the acetabulum. Therefore,\nmechanical stimulation is conducive to the\ndevelopment and growth of the upper and\nposterior walls of the acetabulum.\nIt is generally recognized that the grade of\ndislocation has an impact on the patho-\nlogical changes of the hip.18 However, there\nare different opinions about the relationship\nbetween the dislocation grade and the result\nof conservative treatment. For example, a\nstudy that analysed 100 patients with DDH\naged from 6 to 36 months who were treated\nwith a closed reduction method, reported\nthat the dislocation grade before reduction\nimpacted on the effect of treatment.19 This is\nin direct contrast to the current findings,\nwhich found no significant differences\nbetween the rates of `excellent' and `good'\nhip function based on McKay's criteria\nbetween the four groups stratified according\nto their baseline Tonnis type before the\nreduction was undertaken (Table 2). These\ncurrent findings suggest that the radio-\ngraphic dislocation grade does not have a\ndirect relationship with the long-term thera-\npeutic outcomes.\nThe AI is a common imaging index used\nto evaluate the condition of a hip joint.\nDDH is mainly manifested as AI increases.20\nTo date, there have been various inconsist-\nent reports regarding the influence of AI\nbefore treatment on acetabulum develop-\nment post-reduction.21,22 During the follow-\nup period in the present study, the AI before\nthe reduction was demonstrated to have an\nimpact on the outcomes. The higher the\nbaseline AI, the lower the rates of `excellent'\nand `good' hip function based on McKay's\ncriteria. Therefore, patients with an AI > 40\nshould be treated by closed reduction with\ncaution. In this current group of 339 hips,\nsubluxation or joint space increases\noccurred in 75 hips post-orthosis removal.\nEven after prolonging the orthosis fixation\nrequired an operation. Therefore, the closed\nreduction method cannot be adopted for all\npatients with DDH younger than 18 months\nbecause it does not appear to be applicable\nfor those with an AI > 40.\nIn this present study, the dynamic long\nleg casting method achieved good results.\nAccording to Salter's criteria, the incidence\nrate of AVN was 4.72%. In our opinion, this\nrelates to the following factors: (i) the use of\npreoperative traction and adductor tenot-\nomy in the current study was based on\nprevious research that found that compared\nwith patients receiving preoperative trac-\ntion, the patients with Tonnis type 1 and 2\ndislocations who did not receive traction\ntreatment had a more tensioned joint during\nreduction and had a higher pressure between\nthe femoral head and acetabulum after\nreduction.23 We speculate this is related to\ncontracture of the peripheral tissue and\ncapsular ligament of the hip joint.\nTherefore, the present study implemented a\n2-week traction treatment for all patients\nbefore reduction. We routinely cut the\nadductor and implemented skin traction or\nbone traction of the lower limbs for 2 weeks.\nWith this method, the deformed muscle\ngroups can be effectively relaxed to improve\nthe blood circulation in blood vessels on the\ninside of the circumflex femoral between the\niliopsoas muscle and the adductor muscle\nand to reduce the pressure in the joint after\nreduction; (ii) the implementation of closed\nreduction under general anaesthesia to place\nthe contracted muscles into a relaxed state,\nwhich was conducive to the repair and to\ntemporarilyeliminatethemechanicalpressure\nbetween the femoral head and the acetabu-\nlum; (iii) and based on the premise that the hip\nextension movement, we changed the static\npoint contact between the femoral head and\nthe acetabulum into a dynamic surface con-\ntact, to make the stress between the acetabu-\nlum and the femoral head closer to the\nphysiological state. At the same time, we\nmade the forces of the muscle groups around\nthe hip joint point to different directions along\nthe axial direction of the femoral shaft to\nrelieve the pressure between the acetabulum\nand the femoral head to some extent.\nIn conclusion, the adductor tenotomy,\nclosed reduction, dynamic long leg casting\nmethod is an effective method for treating\nThe AI prior to reduction had an impact on\ntreatment outcome and could be used to\nselect patients most likely to benefit from the\nclosed reduction method because patients\nwith an AI < 40 had higher rates of treat-\nment success compared with patients with\nan AI > 40. The extent of radiographic\ndislocation before reduction had little effect\non the success rate of this closed reduction\ntreatment method.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the National\nNature Science Foundation of China (no.\nProgramme of Liaoning Province (no.\nReferences\n1.
