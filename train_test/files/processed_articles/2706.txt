The 2012 General So-\ncial Survey asked respondents who attend religious services to name their religious congregation, producing a\nnationally representative cross-section of congregations from across the religious spectrum. Data about these\ncongregations were collected via a 50-minute interview with one key informant from 1,331 congregations. In-\nformation was gathered about multiple aspects of congregations' social composition, structure, activities, and\nNCS waves. Each congregation was geocoded, and selected data from the 2010 U.S. Census or American Com-\nmunity Survey have been appended. We describe NCS-III methodology and use the cumulative NCS dataset\n(containing 4,071 cases) to describe five trends: more ethnic diversity, greater acceptance of gays and lesbians,\nincreasingly informal worship styles, declining size (but not from the perspective of the average attendee), and\ndeclining denominational affiliation.\nKeywords: congregations, ethnic diversity, gay rights, congregation size, worship style, National Congregations\nStudy.\nINTRODUCTION\nCongregations remain the most significant collective expression of American religion. They\nrightly have been subject to an enormous amount of social scientific attention at least since H.\nPaul Douglass's landmark studies in the early 20th century (e.g., Douglass 1926). A comprehen-\nsive literature review is neither necessary nor desirable here, but even a cursory look at recent\nliterature makes clear that congregations continue to be studied from many perspectives to learn\nabout many subjects. Looking just at work published since 2010, research on congregations has\nfocused on race and ethnicity (Edwards, Christerson, and Emerson 2013; Marti 2010), small\ngroups (Dougherty and Whitehead 2011), civic and political participation (Schwadel 2012),\nzational networks (Smith, Schietle, and Bader 2012), worship styles (Baker 2010), principal-agent\n"
