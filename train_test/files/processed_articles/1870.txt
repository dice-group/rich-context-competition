Conclusions: Non-Hispanic black adults have the\nhighest percentage of low cardiovascular fitness among major race groups in the United States. On a population basis, over one third\nof non-Hispanic black women have low cardiovascular fitness, suggesting this group in particular may be at increased health risk due\nPhysical inactivity is an important etiologic factor in\nmany chronic conditions, including obesity, type 2\ndiabetes, and several manifestations of cardiovascu-\nlar disease (2,5,8,13). Although the benefits of exercise are\nwell known, the majority of the U.S. population does not\nengage in activities that are consistent with the levels\nrecommended for health (6).\nAn important outcome of physical activity is cardiovas-\ncular fitness, measured as maximal oxygen uptake\n(V\n), a health-related component of overall physical\nfitness that relates to the ability of the circulatory and\nrespiratory systems to supply oxygen to the body during\nsustained physical activity (11). Though genetic factors\nexplain approximately 40\u00ad60% of the variation in V\n(3,4), cardiovascular fitness can also be improved in most\nindividuals who participate in appropriate physical activi-\nties (1,11). There is compelling evidence to support the\nconcept that increased cardiovascular fitness can decrease\nmany chronic health risks (9,13,14). To this end, increasing\nthe number of U.S. adults who participate in physical\nactivity, particularly vigorous activity, that promotes the\ndevelopment and maintenance of cardiovascular fitness is a\nnational health objective (12).\nOur group recently provided national estimates of\nV\n(estimated from submaximal exercise testing) and\nsex- and age-specific cardiovascular fitness levels among\nU.S. adults, based on data from the National Health and\nin NHANES were established using V\ncut-points\nderived from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study\n(ACLS) (2).

The purpose\nof the present study was to determine the distribution of\ncardiovascular fitness levels among U.S. adults based on\nestimated V\ncut-points derived from NHANES, a\nlarge, nationally representative sample of the U.S. popula-\ntion. In turn, the new cut-points established in this study\nmight be useful reference standards to categorize cardio-\nvascular fitness levels of U.S. adults for health risk\nassessment purposes.\nMETHODS\nThe NHANES survey design is a stratified, multistage\nprobability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S.\npopulation (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). The\ncurrent NHANES includes oversampling of Mexican-\nAmerican and non-Hispanic black persons to improve\nestimates for these groups. Approximately 9965 persons\nNHANES protocol was reviewed and approved by the\nNational Center for Health Statistic_s institutional review\nboard. Written informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants prior to any testing.\nTesting procedures and details of the NHANES protocol\nare available elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/\nmajor/nhanes/). All individuals aged 12\u00ad49 yr were\neligible to participate in the cardiovascular fitness\u00adtesting\ncomponent of NHANES. Participants were screened prior\nto testing using questionnaires and a physical examination.\nCertain medical conditions (e.g., angina and self-reported\nlung or breathing problems) excluded individuals from\ntesting, as well as medication usage (e.g., antiarrhythmias\nand beta-blockers), and physical limitations (e.g., bone or\njoint problems that could be made worse by walking) that\nwould interfere with cardiovascular responses to exercise.\nHealth technicians, all trained using a common protocol,\nperformed the fitness examination. Participants were\nassigned to one of eight submaximal treadmill test\nprotocols, based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI,\nkgImj2), and self-reported level of physical activity. The\ngoal of each protocol was to elicit a HR that was\napproximately 75% of the age-predicted maximum\n(220 j age) by the end of the test. Each protocol included\na 2-min warm-up, two 3-min exercise stages, and a 2-min\ncool-down period.\nThe primary outcome for the fitness component was\nestimated V\n(mLIminj1Ikgj1), calculated from the\nHR response to known levels of submaximal work. Based\non sex- and age-specific criteria, the estimated V\nwas\nalso categorized and reported as a low, moderate, or high\nlevel of cardiovascular fitness. These cut-points were\nestablished from data for adults ages 20\u00ad49 yr from the\nACLS (2,10). Low cardiovascular fitness was defined as an\nestimated V\nbelow the 20th percentile of the same\nsex and age group; a moderate fitness level was a value\nbetween the 20th and 59th percentiles, and high fitness was\nat or above the 60th percentile (Table 1).\nData from each survey were linked using the unique survey\nparticipant identifier (SEQN). The initial sample consisted of\nV\nvalue recorded. Participants who were categorized\nas ``other Hispanics'' and ``other races, including multira-\ncial'' were excluded from the analyses because of inade-\nquate sample sizes for these groups. Of the 2214 participants\nin the initial sample, six participants who had extreme\nestimated V\nabove the 99th percentile of the sample distribution), and all\nparticipants with missing or negative sampling weights (N =\nwho had complete data available for the analyses. Based on\ndata from this sample and the corresponding population-\nbased sample weights, identical sex- and age-specific\ncriteria was used to establish new cut-points to categorize\nestimated V\nas a low, moderate, or high level of\ncardiovascular fitness (Table 2). We then reanalyzed the\ndistribution of low, moderate, and high cardiovascular\nfitness using these new cut-points.\nData were analyzed using SAS (Version 9.1, SAS\u00d2\nInstitute, Cary, NC) survey procedures. The full sample\nwas analyzed using the 4-yr full sample medical examina-\ntion weights (WTMEC4YR) to estimate means and 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI), and the masked variance units\n(pseudo-primary sampling units (SDMVPSU) and pseudo-\nstratum (SDMVSTRA)) to estimate the SEM. Continuous\nvariables are presented as a mean (T SE), including age,\nBMI, and estimated V\n. Categorical variables are\npresented as a frequency (N), weighted frequency (based\non sampling weights), and percentage (with corresponding\n95% CI), including sex, race, and cardiovascular fitness\nlevel. Percentages are based on the weighted frequencies.\nThe association between row (race or race\u00adsex groups) and\ncolumn variables (cardiovascular fitness level) was ana-\nlyzed using the Rao\u00adScott W2 test for proportions. Statistical\nsignificance was established at ! = 0.05 a priori.\nTABLE 1.

The sex distribution of the sample\nwas similar to that of the population (Table 3A), whereas\nthe race distribution was approximately 29% Mexican-\nAmerican, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 51% non-Hispan-\nic white. As shown in Table 3B, non-Hispanic white\nsubjects were significantly older (P G 0.017) than the other\nrace groups. Similarly, non-Hispanic white males and\nfemales were significantly older than their Mexican-\nAmerican counterparts (P G 0.008). Estimated V\nwas significantly lower (P G 0.017) among non-Hispanic\nblack than Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white adults.\nEstimated V\nwas also significantly lower (P G 0.008)\namong non-Hispanic black females than Mexican-American\nand non-Hispanic white females, but there were no differ-\nences among males. Finally, BMI was significantly lower\n(P G 0.017) among non-Hispanic white than non-Hispanic\nblack and Mexican-American adults, and BMI was lower\n(P G 0.008) in non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American\nfemales than non-Hispanic black females.\nFor each sex and age category, the revised cut-points\nbased on NHANES data shown in Table 2 were slightly\nhigher than those based on the cut-points derived from\nACLS data (Table 1). Figure 1A shows the distribution of\ncardiovascular fitness levels by race, as reported by us\npreviously (7), and Figure 1B shows the distribution of\ncardiovascular fitness levels by race based on the revised\ncut-points. There was a significant association between\nrace and cardiovascular fitness level (P G 0.0001),\nregardless of the cut-points used.

One purpose in doing so was to\nestablish prevalence estimates for specific groups that may\nbe at increased health risk due to poor cardiovascular\nfitness. We recently reported that non-Hispanic black\nadults, and non-Hispanic black women in particular, had\nlower cardiovascular fitness than other groups in the\nUnited States (7). We found no evidence to support our\nearlier suggestion that differences in the distribution of\nlow, moderate, and high cardiovascular fitness among the\nFIGURE 2--Distribution of age- and sex-specific cardiovascular fitness levels among U.S. adults 20\u00ad49 yr by race and sex with cut-points derived\nfrom the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (A) and from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999\u00ad2002) (B).

Despite using revised cut-\npoints to establish cardiovascular fitness levels that were\nderived from NHANES, which is composed of a more\nrepresentative sample of the U.S. population, we still found\nthat non-Hispanic black adults, and non-Hispanic black\nwomen in particular, had the highest percentage of low\ncardiovascular fitness, compared with their Mexican-\nAmerican and non-Hispanic white counterparts. In fact,\nthe percentage of non-Hispanic black adults and non-\nHispanic black women who had a low cardiovascular\nfitness level was actually higher in the present study\ncompared with our earlier report (7).\nAs depicted in the figures, the distribution of low,\nmoderate, and high cardiovascular fitness differed substan-\ntially among the various race and race\u00adsex groups. This\ndifference was most apparent among females, with roughly\n35% of non-Hispanic black women categorized has having\na low cardiovascular fitness level, compared with 22% of\nMexican-American and 18% of non-Hispanic white wom-\nen. Thus, on a population basis, over one third of all non-\nHispanic black women likely have a low cardiovascular\nfitness level. The present report supports our earlier\nfindings and provides further evidence that non-Hispanic\nblack women in particular may be at increased health risk\ndue to poor cardiovascular fitness. This suggests a need for\nhealth promotion specialists to target efforts toward\nincreasing cardiovascular fitness among non-Hispanic\nblack women to help decrease the prevalence of low\nfitness in this group. This suggestion is supported by recent\nefforts of public health professionals in Richmond, VA, to\nengage relatively high-risk residents (who were dispropor-\ntionately African American and female, had higher BMI\nlevels, and were more likely to report a family history of\nchronic disease compared with the general community)\ninto a multipronged intervention focused on dietary change\nand increased physical activity levels (15).\nThere are a number of important limitations in the\npresent study. First, the estimates for the distribution of\ncardiovascular fitness levels in the population were derived\nfrom estimated V\nvalues based on submaximal\nexercise testing. There is error involved with estimated\nV\nfrom this type of testing because the results are\nbased on extrapolation to HRmax\nestablished from a\ntheoretical formula. In addition, errors in this estimate\nmay be compounded by any factor that influences the HR\nresponse to exercise (e.g., temperature and stress) or the\nmeasurement of HR itself (e.g., equipment used to measure\nHR). Second, the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES\nsurvey does not allow us to make causal inferences as to\nthe underlying reason(s) for the higher percentage of non-\nHispanic black adults who have a low cardiovascular\nfitness level compared with other major race groups in\nthe United States. Potential explanatory factors might\ninclude differences in BMI, income, physical activity level,\nand body composition, all of which will be explored in our\nfuture studies. Third, it should be noted that these findings\nmight not be generalizable to all U.S. adults because of the\nselect age and physical status of the sample examined.\nFinally, by excluding participants categorized as ``other\nHispanics'' and ``other races, including multiracial,'' we\nare unable to provide a precise estimate of estimated\nV\n(and fitness level distribution) for ``all races''\ncombined.\nThe goal of this article was to present the distribution of\ncardiovascular fitness levels among various race groups in\nthe United States using appropriate cut-points that were\nderived from national estimates of V\n(estimated from\nsubmaximal exercise). In turn, the established cut-points\nmight be used to categorize and report cardiovascular fitness\nlevels of adults in the U.S. population for health risk\nassessment purposes. Despite the limitations noted, the\nreference standards presented in this article should provide\na more representative estimate of cardiovascular fitness\nlevels among U.S. adults, which in turn might be useful as\nan evaluation tool for health care providers and other\nprofessionals.\ngrant were used to defray publication costs.\nREFERENCES\nrecommended quantity and quality of exercise for developing and\nmaintaining cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and flexibil-\nCLARK, K.
