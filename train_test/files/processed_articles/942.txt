The relationship of ethnicity,\nsocioeconomic factors, and overweight in U.S. Adolescents\nObjective: To examine the extent to which race/ethnic dif-\nferences in income and education account for sex-specific\ndisparities in overweight prevalence in white, African\nAmerican, Hispanic, and Asian U.S. teens.\nResearch Methods and Procedures: We used nationally\nrepresentative data collected from 13,113 U.S. adoles-\ncents enrolled in the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health. Logistic regression models were used\nto examine the relationship of family income and parental\neducation to overweight prevalence (body mass index \n85th percentile of age and sex-specific cutoff points from\nthe 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/\nNational Center for Health Statistics growth charts). In\naddition, we used coefficients from our logistic regres-\nsion models to project the effects on overweight preva-\nlence of equalizing the socioeconomic status (SES) dif-\nferences between race/ethnic groups.\nResults: Keeping adolescents in their same environments\nand changing only family income and parental education\nhad a limited effect on the disparities in overweight preva-\nlence. Ethnicity\u00adSES\u00adoverweight differences were greater\namong females than males. Given that overweight preva-\nlence decreased with increasing SES among white females\nand remained elevated and even increased among higher\nSES African-American females, African-American/white\ndisparity in overweight prevalence increased at the highest\nSES. Conversely, disparity was lessened at the highest SES\nfor white, Hispanic, and Asian females. Among males,\ndisparity was lowest at the average SES level.\nDiscussion: One cannot automatically assume that the ben-\nefits of increased SES found among white adults will trans-\nfer to other gender\u00adage\u00adethnic groups. Our findings suggest\nthat efforts to reduce overweight disparities between ethnic\ngroups must look beyond income and education and focus\non other factors, such as environmental, contextual, biolog-\nical, and sociocultural factors.\n",

Popkin\n Key words: health disparities, income, education, mi-\nnority population, SES\nIntroduction\nObesity is a major public health issue contributing sub-\nstantially to U.S. total mortality rates. National health ob-\njectives call for reducing ethnic disparities in health (1),\nwith an emphasis on the fact that economic and racial\ninequality seems to have increased in recent decades (2\u00ad4).\nResearch on chronic illness found increasing socioeconomic\nstatus (SES)1\u00adhealth differentials with age (5). Type II\ndiabetes, dyslipidemia, and other measures of chronic dis-\neases are found among U.S. adolescents (6). SES-related\ndifferences in obesity emerge during adolescence (7\u00ad10).\nThe literature on race/ethnicity and obesity shows higher\noverweight prevalence among African Americans than\nwhites of the same age and sex (11\u00ad14), with an inverse\nrelationship between obesity and SES among white, but not\nAfrican-American or Mexican-American youth (15\u00ad17).\nWhereas there has been considerable research on SES and\noverweight prevalence among adults, little is known about\nthe impact of SES on lifestyle behaviors among youth (18).\nThere are no national studies of ethnic differences in over-\nweight prevalence, among large ethnically diverse samples,\nthat take sociodemographic factors into account in a de-\ntailed manner. Indeed, a recent review of 20 years of U.S.\ncardiovascular disease studies concluded that only a small\npercentage included both SES and ethnicity in analysis (19).\nCarolina Population Center, University of North Carolina, Department of Nutrition, School\nof Public Health University of North Carolina.\nAddress correspondence to Penny Gordon-Larsen, Ph.D., University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill, Carolina Population Center, University Square, 123 West Franklin Street,\nE-mail: gordon_larsen@unc.edu\nCopyright \u00a9 2003 NAASO 1 Nonstandard abbreviations: SES, socioeconomic status; BMI, body mass index.\nOur study examined the relationship of family income\nand parental education to overweight prevalence in the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth). We further investigated the extent to which race/\nethnic differences in income and education account for\ndisparities in overweight prevalence among white, African-\nAmerican, Hispanic, and Asian teens; we also projected the\neffects on overweight prevalence of equalizing these SES\ndifferences between the groups.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nSurvey Design\nThe study population consisted of 20,000 adolescents\nenrolled in Add Health, a longitudinal, nationally represen-\ntative, school-based study of U.S. adolescents in grades 7 to\n12, supplemented with minority special samples and col-\nlected under protocols approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. For\nAdd Health, a stratified (e.g., urbanicity, school size, school\ntype), random sample of all high schools in the U.S. was\nselected, and 90,000 adolescents were surveyed. From\nthis sample, adolescents were selected for a core, nationally\nrepresentative sample, after which special samples were\nadded for greater representation of selected groups (such as\nethnic minorities). The survey design and sampling frame\nhave been described elsewhere (20).\nmeasured between April and August, 1996). Exclusions\ninclude Native Americans (N  178), because of small\nsample size, and adolescents without complete height,\nweight, and SES data. Our final analysis sample included\nyears; 46.5% female) from four major ethnic groups: non-\nStudy Variables\nHeight and weight were measured in Wave 2 during in-\nhome surveys and overweight status defined as a body mass\nindex (BMI)  85th percentile of age and sex-specific\ncutoff points from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention/National Center for Health Statistics growth\ncharts (21). Whereas the 95th percentile may be associated\nwith greater health risks, we used the 85th percentile to\ndefine overweight for three reasons: 1) to understand the\nfull range of overweight during adolescence [see Must et al.\n(22)]; 2) to allow an analysis using the Asian sample,\nbecause there were very small numbers of Asian females\nwith a BMI  95th percentile; and 3) because the pattern\nand direction of results were very similar using the 85th and\nA combination of in-home surveys of parents and ado-\nlescents provided race/ethnicity, household income, and ed-\nucation data. Race/ethnicity was categorized as Hispanic,\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African American, or\nAsian American. For simplicity, we refer to these groups as\nHispanic, white, African American, or Asian.\nWe examined income and education separately because\nthey represent distinct dimensions of SES. Each is used\ndifferently in program and policy implementation (e.g.,\nincome qualification for many food welfare programs), and\neach represents different constraints or advantages that may\naffect behavior quite uniquely. Parental education was de-\nfined as the highest level of education achieved for either\nparent; our data showed that paternal education was higher\nthan maternal education in 1229 cases. Although differ-\nences were minimal, we used parental, rather than maternal,\neducation as a better indicator of household level SES. We\ninitially tested continuous forms of income and education.\nIn final models, we grouped the highest level of education\nachieved for either parent into the following categories: less\nthan high school, high school/GED (reference), some col-\nlege, and college degree and/or graduate or professional\ndegrees. Income was reported in $1000 increments. Where\nputed using data on parental occupation, family structure,\nand school community. This method is similar to that used\nin other national surveys, such as the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey. Income was used as a\ncontinuous variable or grouped into the following cate-\ngreater. Three interaction terms were used in specific\nmodels: income*less than high school, income*some col-\nlege, income*college and/or professional degree, with\nincome*high school/GED as the reference category. Con-\ntrol variables included age, whether income was pre-\ndicted, and pregnancy status (for females).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe intent of this paper was to examine the net effects of\nincome and education on overweight by sex and ethnicity.\nThus, we used race- and sex-stratified models that included\nonly income, education, and key controls (e.g., age and\npregnancy), and excluded more proximate determinants of\noverweight through which SES may operate. We reasoned\nthat the net effects of income and education would be the\nsame irrespective of pathway. Given the age range of our\nstudy sample and the understood relationship between mat-\nuration and overweight (23), we tested whether maturation\nwas important for this analysis. Although the maturation\ncoefficient was itself significant, inclusion of maturation did\nnot change the relationship of SES to overweight. We\ntherefore excluded maturation from the final models.\nStatistical analyses were carried out using STATA Ver-\nsion 6.0 (24). We used the widely accepted series of\nSTATA survey (SVY) procedures to correct for multiple\nEthnicity, SES, and Overweight, Gordon-Larsen, Adair, and Popkin\nstages of cluster sample design and unequal probability of\nselection to ensure that our results were nationally repre-\nsentative with unbiased estimates and standard errors. We\nused logistic regression models to investigate the associa-\ntion between overweight prevalence and ethnicity, income,\nand education. Initial logistic regression models confirmed\nthat the factors associated with overweight prevalence are\ndifferent for males and females and by ethnic group. Thus,\nmodels were stratified by ethnicity and sex.\nFurther analysis demonstrated that the shape of the rela-\ntionship between income, education, and overweight prev-\nalence differed by ethnicity and sex. Thus, different speci-\nfications were required to capture effects of income,\neducation, and overweight prevalence by ethnicity. Essen-\ntially, we started with a basic model including continuous or\ncategorical income (depending on shape of the relationship)\nand categorical education and education with income inter-\naction terms. We then removed all nonsignificant interac-\ntion terms. The final models consisted of the following: 1)\ncontinuous income and categorical education (Hispanic\nmales, Asian males and females, and African-American\nmales and females); 2) continuous income, categorical ed-\nucation, and the income and education interaction terms\n(white males); and 3) categorical income and categorical\neducation (white and Hispanic females). We present coef-\nficients from the models because it is a general principle\nthat odds ratios from models including interaction terms are\nnot easily interpretable.\nResults\nWhat Are the Disparities between the Racial/Ethnic\nGroups?\nOverweight was high among all U.S. adolescents (Figure 1).\nHowever, overweight prevalence was highest for African-\nAmerican females, followed by Hispanics of both sexes and\nwhite males.\nTable 1 shows the distribution of respondents by catego-\nries of family income and maternal education. More than\nhalf of whites, African Americans, and Asians had mothers\nwith at least some college education, whereas parental ed-\nucation was substantially lower among Hispanic adoles-\ncents. Mean family income was lowest in African Ameri-\ncans and Hispanics, with a higher proportion of African\nAmericans and Hispanics in the lowest income category.\nThe relationship between overweight prevalence and\nfamily income differed by ethnicity (Figure 2), with more\npronounced differences among females. Overweight preva-\nlence decreased linearly with increasing income among\nwhite males. Hispanic males had significantly higher over-\nweight prevalence than whites at mid-to-high family in-\ncomes. Asian males had significantly lower overweight\nprevalence than whites at both low (less than $20,000) and\nThere was greater ethnic variation among females than\nmales. Overweight prevalence declined with increasing in-\ncome among whites. Overweight prevalence was lowest for\nAfrican Americans in mid-income levels, but highest for\nthose with lowest and highest family incomes, with statis-\ntically significant African-American/white differences at all\nincome levels. Asians had significantly lower overweight\nResults were similar for the relationship between parental\neducation and overweight (Figure 3). Females showed\ngreater variability in overweight by parental education than\nmales. African-American females had significantly higher\noverweight than white females across all levels of parental\neducation except the lowest level. There were no statisti-\ncally significant differences in overweight by parental edu-\ncation for males.\nWe next used multivariate models, stratified by sex and\nethnicity, to assess the relationship of family income and\nFigure 1: Overweight prevalence by ethnicity and sex.

The results\nshow net effects of income and education, without consid-\neration of more proximate determinants of overweight prev-\nalence (such as diet and activity).\nCoefficients from these models are shown in Appendix\n1. We used the continuous income variable for African-\nAmerican adolescents of both sexes and Hispanic males.\nThe identical model using categorical income for His-\npanic females yielded comparable results.\nFor white males, the main effects of income and education\nwere not significant, although higher income was associated\nwith increased overweight prevalence in households with low-\nest parental education. Among African-American and His-\npanic males, neither income nor education was statistically\nsignificant. In Asian males, higher income and parental edu-\ncation were associated with lower overweight prevalence.\nAmong white females, incomes above $40,000 were signif-\nicantly associated with lower overweight prevalence.

We\nused coefficients from our logistic regression models (Ap-\npendix 1) to predict overweight prevalence at specified\nincome and education levels. For example, we estimated\noverweight prevalence in each group, assuming that all\nadolescents were from low-income households with parents\nof less-than-high school education. We repeated this exer-\ncise for other combinations of education and income. Re-\nsults, in the form of predicted overweight prevalence, are\nshown in figures below.\nPredicted overweight prevalence results for males are\nshown in Figure 4. While maintaining low parental educa-\ntion, raising the income from the lowest to the middle level\n(Figure 4, panels 1 and 2) increased overweight prevalence\nFigure 3: Overweight prevalence by category of parental education. *White vs. given ethnic group, p  0.05. **White vs. given ethnic\ngroup, p  0.01.

Moving\nfrom this average level to the highest levels of income and\neducation (Figure 4, panels 3 and 5), overweight prevalence\ndecreased by 8.7 percentage points in whites, 0.6 percentage\npoints for Hispanics, and 15.3 percentage points for Asians,\nbut increased 1.2 percentage points in African Americans.\nAfrican-American/white disparity in overweight preva-\nlence among males would be the smallest at the lowest SES\nand greatest at the middle income/no high school level\n(whites were 17.8 percentage points higher than African\nAmericans). The direction of African-American/white dis-\nparity reversed as SES increased. At the highest level,\nAfrican Americans had a higher predicted overweight preva-\nlence than whites. Hispanic/white disparity was lowest at the\naverage SES (3.6 percentage points) and highest at the highest\nSES category (11.7 percentage points). Asian/white disparity\nwas lowest at middle income/highest-education levels (2.0\npercentage points) and highest at the middle income/no high\nschool level (13.6 percentage points) (Figure 4).\nAmong females from low parental-education households,\nraising the income level from the lowest to middle level\n(Figure 5, panels 1 and 2) decreased overweight prevalence\namong white females (10.7 percentage points) and in-\ncreased it among African-American (0.2 percentage points)\nand Hispanic (2.1 percentage points) females, whereas\nAsians remained the same.\nMoving from middle income/no high school education\nto middle income/high school education (Figure 5, panels\n2 and 3) among females--which is the pattern for the\nmajority of whites--overweight prevalence would again\ndecrease for whites (3.7 percentage points), African\nAmericans (2.8 percentage points), and Hispanics (2.1\npercentage points), but increase for Asians (13.5 percent-\nage points). Moving from middle income/high education\nto high income/high education (Figure 5, panels 4 and 5),\noverweight decreased for whites (2.6 percentage points)\nand Hispanics (7.9 percentage points), but changed little\nfor African Americans (0.2 percentage points) and\nAsians (0.1 percentage points). The decline in over-\nweight prevalence with increasing SES was of greatest\nmagnitude among whites, moderate among Hispanics,\nand minimal in African Americans, who maintained\nhigh levels of overweight prevalence at all SES levels\n(Figure 5).\nAfrican-American/white disparity, which was small at\nlow SES, increased with higher SES, and peaked at the\nhighest SES (15.6 percentage points). Hispanic/white dis-\nparity was highest at the average SES (9) and lowest at the\nhighest SES (0.1 percentage points). Asian-white dispar-\nity was greatest at lowest SES (29.6 percentage points)\nand smallest at average (1.7 percentage points) and high-\nest SES levels (2.9 percentage points).\nDiscussion\nThere was considerable ethnic disparity in adolescent over-\nweight prevalence by SES, with a clear inverse relationship\nFigure 5: Predicted overweight prevalence among females by ethnicity and categories of family income and parental education. Low income\nschool; HS, high school (or GED) diploma; Prof, college or professional degree; Af Am, African American.\nEthnicity, SES, and Overweight, Gordon-Larsen, Adair, and Popkin\nonly among white females. This is, to our knowledge, one of\nthe first studies to document the variation in association\nbetween SES and overweight prevalence among large sam-\nples of adolescents from four major U.S. ethnic groups.\nWill equalizing income and/or education reduce or elim-\ninate disparities in overweight prevalence? To answer this\nquestion, we used coefficients from stratified logistic re-\ngression models and calculated, in each group, the predicted\nprevalence of overweight at selected income and education\nlevels. This allowed us to see more clearly (given the\nrelationships found in the Add Health sample) whether\neliminating income and education disparities would also\neliminate disparities in overweight prevalence. Because the\ncoefficients from stratified models were used to estimate the\neffects, we accounted for some of the differences in the\nrace-/ethnicity-specific effects of income.\nWe found that even if we were to equalize income and\neducation, we would not eliminate health disparities. Based\non our simulations, we determined that even at identical\nSES levels, there were large differences in overweight prev-\nalence by ethnicity. For example, because overweight prev-\nalence decreased with higher SES among whites, but in-\ncreased with higher SES among African Americans at the\nhighest level of parental education and income, African-\nAmerican/white disparity in overweight prevalence among\nfemales actually increased. This suggests that factors other\nthan SES are very important.\nOur analysis strategy of examining only the net effects of\nincome and education on overweight was designed to test\nthe net effects of income and education on overweight,\nrather than undertake causal modeling of these relation-\nships. Clearly, several other biological, sociocultural, and\nenvironmental factors associated with income and education\nare likely to affect overweight prevalence. For example,\nenvironmental factors such as community crime rates and\nprovision of recreation facilities affect physical activity and\nWe did not consider the more proximate determinants\nof overweight prevalence (such as diet, activity, and\nmaturation) that may vary with socioeconomic variables\nand may, in turn, affect risk of overweight. Failure to\naccount for maturation status may result in misclassifi-\ncation of overweight among younger adolescents (28);\nearly maturing females are more likely to be classified as\noverweight, whereas overweight is underestimated in late\nmaturing females. However, the effect on estimates of\noverweight prevalence in the U.S. is small (28). Further-\nmore, the net effects of SES on overweight will be the\nsame irrespective of the pathway. There is limited re-\nsearch on the relationship of SES to physical inactivity\n(25) and nutritional outcomes (29). Because there is\nlimited empirical research on the associations between\nSES and these proximate determinants, further research\nis needed to clarify these relationships.\nThe strong inverse relationship of SES to overweight\nprevalence among white female adolescents in this study is\nsimilar to that found by other researchers (30\u00ad32).\nWinkleby et al. (33,34) found higher cardiovascular disease\nrisk factors among African- and Mexican-American high\nSES females. More research has been done with adults;\nresults in children and adolescents show weaker, less con-\nsistent findings. Although Must et al. (31), in a study of\nyoung adults (ages 16 to 28 years), found that poverty and\nparental education were not related to obesity in white,\nAfrican-American, and Hispanic men or African-American\nwomen, the inverse relation was seen for white and His-\npanic women. Importantly, there are different meanings to\nsimilar levels of SES based on ethnicity, in that ethnic\nminority youth do not receive the same economic and social\nbenefits at identical SES levels as white youth (35\u00ad37).\nGeneralizability of our results may be affected by non-\nparticipation bias related to overweight, ethnicity, and SES\ndistribution. For example, research with Danish men shows\nthat the response rate on a health survey was associated with\nlower BMI and higher intelligence test score, educational\nlevel, and social class (38). However, nonparticipation is\nunlikely to bias our effect estimates significantly because it\nis unlikely that the relationship of SES to overweight differs\nin included and excluded adolescents. Attrition by SES,\nethnicity, and overweight has not yet been examined in the\nAdd Health dataset.\nThese results suggest that we cannot assume that the\nbenefits of increased SES found among white adults will\ntransfer to other age\u00adgender\u00adethnic groups. Attention must\nbe paid to national efforts to reduce and prevent overweight\nprevalence, particularly in light of national health objectives\nfor reducing the substantial health disparities between eth-\nnic groups in the U.S. Our analysis suggests that reducing\ndisparities in income and education will not reduce dispar-\nities in overweight prevalence.\n"
