Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 enrolled couples and single individuals as\nparticipants, respectively. The results of the two experiments indicated that the participants evaluated\ntheir own face as significantly more attractive than did others of the same sex. More importantly, the\nromantic relationship enhanced the positive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness, that is,\ncouple participants showed a stronger positive bias than did single individuals. It was also found\nthat a person in a romantic relationship was prone to overestimating the attractiveness of his or\nher lover's face, from the perspective of both probability evaluation and rating score. However, the\nabovementioned overestimation did not surpass the evaluations of the exaggeratedly attractive\nface. The present results supported the observer hypothesis, demonstrating the romantic\nrelationship to be an important influential factor of facial attractiveness. Our findings have\nimportant implications for the research of self-face evaluation.\n",

Facial attractiveness embodies a great deal of social affective\ninformation, such as age, gender, social status and emotion, and it plays an important role in\nsocial interaction.\nFrom the 1970s to the present, numerous studies have investigated what renders a face\nattractive. Research primarily focused on the averageness, symmetry and sexual dimorphism\nof faces. Converging evidence suggested that faces with high averageness, symmetrical faces\nand faces with sexual dimorphism (i.e. masculinity in male faces and femininity in female faces,\nwhich signal sexual maturity and reproductive potential) were more attractive (see Rhodes,\n2006, for a review). In addition, some other characteristics of faces were also addressed, such as\nthe feature size of eyes, mouth, nose, chin, cheekbones, facial skin health and skin colour.\nThe aforementioned study investigated facial attractiveness from the perspective of other\npeople. Some studies also addressed the self-evaluations of facial attractiveness. The first such\nstudy came from Cash, Cash, and Butters (1983). In their study, female participants were\nrequested to rate their own attractiveness following exposure to same-sex persons who were\neither physically attractive or unattractive. The results indicated that subjects gave lower self-\nratings following the attractive compared with the less attractive stimulus contrast. The findings\nsupported the contrast effect and were consistent with social comparison theory. Some other\nstudies obtained similar results and supported the theory (e.g. Little & Mannion, 2006; Thornton\n& Maurice, 1999). However, these investigations primarily explored the influence of context (e.g.\nsocial comparison stimulus) on self-evaluations of facial attractiveness.\nSeveral recent studies investigated the self-evaluations of facial attractiveness compared\nwith evaluations of their facial attractiveness by others. In a study conducted by Springer\net al. (2012), subjects were required to evaluate four photos of themselves using a variety of\ndescriptive sentences, such as the statement `I look very young'. The results indicated that\ncompared with others' evaluation, people evaluated their own faces as more attractive. In our\nrecent study (Cai, Zheng, Ge, & Liu, 2018), we observed similar results using a more objective\nmethod of paired comparison. A study by Stillman and Fristina (2010) also determined that\nfemale patients in a dermatology office rated themselves as more attractive than did other\npersons who viewed photographs of those patients. Such studies consistently conclude that\nindividuals maintain a positive bias in evaluating self-face attractiveness.\nExisting findings suggest that a relationship, particularly romantic love, may affect the self-\nevaluation of facial attractiveness. For example, numerous studies have indicated a positive\nillusion called the `love-is-blind bias', which refers to one's evaluation of a lover's physical\nattractiveness as being higher than one's evaluation of one's own attractiveness (Barelds-\nHaubner, Voracek, & Furnham, 2009), even in homosexual relationships (Swami et al.,\n2009). These studies emphasize the influence of the romantic relationship on the evaluation\nof the lover's facial attractiveness. Because romantic love is an interactive relationship, both\nparties not only change their assessment of the lover's attractiveness but may also change\ntheir assessment of self-face attractiveness. In addition, the romantic relationship is highly\nassociated with self-esteem (Bylsma, Cozzarelli, & Sumer, 1997), and self-esteem was\nobserved to relate to self-evaluation of facial attractiveness (Bale, 2010). Thus, the\nromantic relationship may affect the self-evaluation of facial attractiveness. However, to\nour knowledge, no study to date has explored this issue directly.\nThe present study seeks to examine the influence of a romantic relationship on the\nevaluation of self-face attractiveness. We predicted that romantic love enhances the\npositive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness, that is, individuals in love will\nevaluate their facial attractiveness to be higher than individuals in a single state. For this\npurpose, two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 recruited individuals who were\nfalling in love as subjects to investigate the characteristics of the self-evaluation of facial\nattractiveness compared with others' and the lover's evaluation. Experiment 2 examined\nsingle subjects as a contrast group to the couple participants in Experiment 1.\nFurthermore, exaggeratedly attractive faces that represented a so-called perfect face with\nextremely high attractiveness (Perrett, May, & Yoshikawa, 1994; Rhodes & Tremewan,\noverestimation of self-face attractiveness. In the current study, two evaluation methods\nwere adopted, that is, a subjective rating measurement and a relatively objective method of\npaired comparison in which two faces were paired and the evaluators were asked to judge\nwhich one was more attractive.\nExperiment 1: The Evaluation of Self-Face Attractiveness\nin Individuals in Romantic Relationships\nExperiment 1 recruited couples as participants to investigate the characteristics of the\nevaluation of self-face attractiveness. In addition, the experiment explored whether one's\nlover would overestimate the attractiveness of the partner's face.\nMethods\nParticipants. A total of 30 heterosexual couples (i.e. 60 participants; mean age 20.7 \u00c6 1.5 years\nwith a range of 18\u00ad24 years) participated in this experiment for monetary compensation. All\nwere right-handed native Mandarin Chinese speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal\nvision. All of the participants were required to complete the Chinese adaptation of the ECR\n(Experiences in Close Relationships) Inventory (Li & Kato, 2006) to ensure that all of the\ncouples were in stable public relationships with lovers. By asking each participant whether\nthey knew the other participants, we verified that none of the couples knew one another\nbefore the experiment. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant\nfollowing a research protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Zhejiang Sci-\nTech University. All experimental methods were conducted in accordance with the approved\nguidelines regarding all relevant aspects, including the recruitment, experimental process\ninformation, compensation and debriefing of participants.\nMaterials\nSelf-face images\nOne standardized image was obtained for each participant before the formal experiment\nfollowing several steps. First, a full-face photograph was taken at a specified distance (1.5 m)\nusing a digital camera (model: FinePix S9600). The participants were required to tie back\ntheir hair to expose their entire face. In addition, they were asked to gaze directly at the\ncamera with a neutral expression by referring to a standard neutral face. Two bright lights\nwere focused on the left and right sides of the participant's face to ensure sufficient and\nconsistent light. Second, the original images were modified with the Adobe Photoshop\nsoftware (http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html): (a) to remove evident spots\non the photos while keeping the face intact, (b) to adjust the image's direction based on\nthe horizon linking the two eyes, (c) to convert the colour photos to black-and-white photos\nCai et al. 3\nand (d) to resize the images to 400 \u00c2 400 pixels. The final images consisted of an oval-shaped\nface on a black background.\nExaggeratedly attractive images. To find exaggeratedly attractive images, we first searched\nattractive faces on the Internet using keywords related to high attractiveness, such as\n`beauty' and `handsome'. In this manner, we collected 125 photos (70 females) with a front\nneutral face on a white background. Then, the photos were processed to standardized images\nusing the same steps used for the self-face images. Third, these faces were rated on a 7-point\nLikert scale (1 \u00bc not at all attractive to 7 \u00bc most attractive) by 61 college students (30 females,\nmean age 20.8 \u00c6 1.8 years) who were not the formal subjects of the two experiments. Finally,\nwe selected the female and male faces with the highest attractiveness scores (5.89 and 5.57,\nrespectively) as the exaggeratedly attractive female and male faces.\nProcedure. The formal experiment was conducted on two successive days. On the first day,\nfemale and male subjects completed the experiment separately, with each participant\nparticipating only in the evaluation of same-sex faces. The experiment was conducted in two\nstages. In the first stage, the paired comparison method was used. Two of the 31 same-sex facial\nimages (30 same-sex subjects' faces and the same-sex exaggerated attractiveness face) were\npaired and presented twice (one on the left side and one on the right side), resulting in a total of\n\u00de. For each trial, a `\u00fe' was presented for 500 ms as a focal point, followed by one\nimage pair. The participants were instructed to judge which of the two paired faces was more\nattractive. If they thought the left face was more attractive, then they pressed the `left' button\n(the `F' key on the keyboard). If they thought the right face was more attractive, they pressed\nthe `right' button (the `J' key on the keyboard). The image pair did not disappear until a\nresponse was entered. After the response, the next trial began. The participants were\nexposed to a short practice session before the three formal sessions, and there was a short\nbreak of no less than 2 min during two successive sessions. After the first stage, there was a rest\nfor approximately 2 min. In the second stage, the subjective rating method was used. For each\ntrial, a `\u00fe' was presented for 500 ms, followed by one facial image randomly selected from the\n31 same-sex images (30 images of the same-sex subjects and the same-sex exaggeratedly\nattractive face). The participants were instructed to evaluate the attractiveness of the faces\nin the images based on a 7-point Likert scale (1 \u00bc not at all attractive; 7 \u00bc most attractive) by\npressing one of the `1\u00ad7' keys on the keyboard. After the response, the next trial began\nimmediately. Participants also completed a short practice session before the formal session.\nOn the second day, the experimental procedure was the same as on the first day, except\nthat the participants were asked to judge and evaluate the attractiveness of opposite-sex faces,\nincluding their lover's face, faces of other opposite-sex subjects, and the opposite-sex\nexaggeratedly attractive face.\nData analysis. Two types of data were obtained in the experiment: the probability data (which\nindicates the probability of one's own face being selected as more attractive when paired with\nother same-sex faces) and the rating scores data (which indicate the attractiveness rating\nscores of one's own face). Thus, the following two sections introduced how the data were\ndefined and calculated in different conditions.\n(1) Probability analysis\nIn the present study, the probability (%) was defined as the ratio of selection, that is, the\nactual number of selection/the total number of presentations.\nThere were two types of pairing: one's own face paired with the face of another same-sex\nsubject (i.e. Self vs. Other) and one's own face paired with the same-sex exaggeratedly\nattractive face (i.e. Self vs. Exaggerated). Thus, the probability data comprised the\ncorresponding two types.\n(i) Probability of one's own face being selected as more attractive when paired with other same-\nsex faces\nThere were 30 faces of same-sex subjects in Experiment 1. A particular face could be\npaired with 29 other faces, thus resulting in 58 pairs (since each face could be placed either\nin the left or in the right position). Each pair could be evaluated by 30 same-sex subjects and\n30 opposite-sex subjects.\nFirst, we introduced a method to calculate the probability when the evaluator was the\nsame sex. For a given image, if the evaluator was the subject of the image, then the\nprobability of this image being selected as more attractive was referred to as `probability\nof one's own face being selected as more attractive by oneself' (the Self condition in Table 1);\notherwise, the probability was referred to as `probability of one's own face being selected as\nmore attractive by other same-sex evaluators' (the ssOthers condition in Table 1). For each\nimage, there was one data point for the `Self' condition and 29 data points for the `ssOthers'\ncondition. The final probability of the `ssOthers' condition for each image was defined as the\naverage of these 29 data points. The overestimation probability that one's own image would\nbe selected as more attractive was calculated by subtracting the probability of the `ssOthers'\ncondition from the probability of the `Self' condition.\nNext, we introduced a method to calculate the same probability when the evaluator was\nthe opposite sex. For a given image, if the evaluator was the lover of the person in the\nimage, then the probability of this image being selected as more attractive was referred to\nas `the probability of one's own face being selected as more attractive by one's lover' (the\nLover condition in Table 1); otherwise, the probability was referred to as `the probability of\none's own face being selected as more attractive by other opposite-sex evaluators' (the\nosOthers condition in Table 1). For each image, there was one data point for the\n`Lover' condition and 29 data points for the `osOthers' condition. The final probability\nTable 1. Mean Probability (SD) of One's Own Face Being Selected as More Attractive by Different\nEvaluators.\nExperiment 1 Experiment 2\nSelf vs. other Self vs. exaggerated Self vs. other\nSelf vs.\nexaggerated\nSelf ssOthers Lover osOthers Self Lover Self ssOthers Self\nNote. ssOthers \u00bc same-sex other evaluators; osOthers \u00bc opposite-sex other evaluators. `Self vs. Other' is the probability\nof one's own face being selected as more attractive when paired with other faces of the same-sex. `Self vs. Exaggerated' is\nthe probability of the self-face being selected as more attractive when paired with an exaggeratedly attractive face.\nCai et al. 5\nof the `osOthers' condition was defined as the average of these 29 data points. The\noverestimation probability that each image would be selected as more attractive by one's\nlover was calculated by subtracting the probability of the `osOthers' condition from the\nprobability of the `Lover' condition.\n(ii) Probability of one's own face being selected as more attractive when paired with the same-\nsex exaggeratedly attractive face\nA particular face could be paired with one same-sex exaggeratedly attractive face, thus\nresulting in two pairs. For a given image, if the evaluator was the subject of the image, then\nthe probability of this image's being selected as more attractive was referred to as `probability\nof selecting one's own face as more attractive than the exaggerated image' (the Self condition\nin Table 1). If the evaluator was the lover of the person in the image, then the probability of\nthis image being selected as more attractive was referred to as `probability of one's own face\nbeing selected as more attractive than the exaggerated image by one's lover' (the Lover\ncondition in Table 1).\n(2) Rating scores analysis\n(i) Attractiveness scores of self-face evaluation by different types of raters\nThe subjective attractiveness evaluation for each image was measured by the rating scores\nbased on a 7-point Likert scale. Each image could be evaluated by 30 same-sex subjects and\n30 opposite-sex subjects.\nFirst, we introduced the situation in which the rater was the same sex. For a given image, if\nthe rater was the subject of the image, then the rating score for the image was referred to as\n`rating score by oneself' (the Self condition in Table 2); otherwise, the rating score for the\nimage was referred to as `rating score by other same-sex raters' (the ssOthers condition in\nTable 2). For each image, there was one data point for the `Self' condition and 29 data points\nfor the `ssOthers' condition. The final score of the `ssOthers' condition for each image was\ndefined as the average of these 29 data points. The overestimation score that each image\nwould be selected as more attractive by oneself was calculated by subtracting the score of the\n`ssOthers' condition from the score of the `Self' condition.\nNext, we introduced the situation in which the rater was the opposite sex. For a given\nimage, if the rater was the lover of the person in the image, then the rating score for the image\nwas referred to as `rating score by one's lover' (the Lover condition in Table 2); otherwise,\nthe rating score for the image was referred to as `rating score by other opposite-sex raters'\nTable 2. Mean Score (SD) of Attractiveness Rating of One's Own Face and the Exaggerated Face by\nDifferent Raters.\nExperiment 1 Experiment 2\nSelf Exaggerated Self Exaggerated\nSelf ssOthers Lover osOthers Self Lover Self ssOthers Self\nNote. ssOthers \u00bc same-sex other raters; osOthers \u00bc opposite-sex other raters.\n(the osOthers condition in Table 2). For each image, there was one data point for the `Lover'\ncondition and 29 data points for the `osOthers' condition. The final score of the `osOthers'\ncondition for each image was defined as the average of these 29 data points. The\noverestimation score that each image would be selected as more attractive by one's lover\nwas calculated by subtracting the score of the `osOthers' condition from the score of the\n`Lover' condition.\n(ii) Attractiveness scores of the exaggeratedly attractive face by different types of raters\nThe rating score for the exaggerated image rated by the owner of the self-face image was\nreferred to as `the rating score for exaggerated face by oneself' (the Self condition in Table 2).\nThe rating score for the exaggerated image rated by the lover of the person in the self-face\nimage was referred to as the `rating score for exaggerated face by one's lover' (the Lover\ncondition in Table 2).\nResults\nThe results of the experiments were presented in Tables 1 and 2.\nResults of the probability evaluation\n(1) Results of the probability evaluation of one's own face being selected as more attractive\nwhen paired with other same-sex faces (Self vs. Other)\n(i) Results evaluated by same-sex subjects\nA Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated that for both female (Z \u00bc \u00c04.76, p < .001) and male\n(Z \u00bc \u00c04.78, p < .001) faces, the probability of one's own face being selected as more attractive\nby oneself (i.e. the Self condition in Table 1) was significantly higher than the probability that\nothers of the same-sex would select that face (i.e. the ssOthers condition in Table 1). This\nresult verified the positive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness in couple\nparticipants from the perspective of probability evaluation.\n(ii) Results evaluated by opposite-sex subjects\nA Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated that for both female (Z \u00bc \u00c04.78, p < .001) and male\n(Z \u00bc \u00c04.76, p < .001) faces, the probability of one's own face being selected as more attractive\nby one's lover (i.e. the Lover condition in Table 1) was significantly higher than the\nprobability that one's face would be selected by other opposite-sex participants (i.e. the\nosOthers condition in Table 1). This result revealed that the participants in love (compared\nwith the others) were prone to overestimating the attractiveness of their lovers' faces from the\nperspective of probability evaluation.\n(iii) Overestimation of the probability by oneself and the lover\nAs described in the `Data analysis' section, the overestimation probability of selecting\none's own face as more attractive was defined by the probability of `Self \u00ad ssOthers', and\nthe overestimation probability of being selected by one's lover was defined by the probability\nof `Lover \u00ad osOthers'. The results of paired-samples t tests indicated that for both female\nCai et al. 7\nprobabilities by oneself and by one's lover were not significantly different.\n(2) Results of probability evaluation of self-face selection as more attractive when paired with\nthe same-sex exaggeratedly attractive face (Self vs. Exaggerated)\n(i) Results evaluated by oneself\nA Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted to compare the mean probability of self-face\nselection as more attractive when paired with other same-sex faces (`Self vs. Other') with that\nwhen paired with the same-sex exaggerated face (Self vs. Exaggerated). The results indicated\nprobability of selecting one's own face as more attractive in the `Self vs. Other' condition\nwas significantly higher than in the `Self vs. Exaggerated' condition (see Table 1).\nTo determine whether a participant would think that his or her own face was more\nattractive than the exaggerated face, a one-sample t test was conducted with a random\nand male, t(29) \u00bc \u00c03.24, p < .01, faces, the probability of evaluating self-face attractiveness as\nhigher than the exaggerated face was significantly lower than 50%. These results indicated\nthat the positive bias in self-face attractiveness evaluation did not surpass the exaggerated\nfaces in couples from the perspective of probability evaluation.\n(ii) Results evaluated by one's lover\nA Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted to compare the mean probability of the lover\nselecting the partner's face as more attractive when paired with other same-sex faces than\nwhen paired with the same-sex exaggerated face. The results indicated that for both female\nselecting the partner's face as more attractive in the `Self vs. Other' condition was\nsignificantly higher than in the `Self vs. Exaggerated' condition (see Table 1).\nTo determine whether the participants' lover would select the partner's face as more\nattractive than the exaggerated face, a one-sample t test was conducted with a random\nprobability of 50%. The results indicated that for the female faces, the probability of\nevaluating the attractiveness of partner's face as higher than the exaggerated face was\nsignificantly lower than 50%, t(29) \u00bc \u00c02.52, p < .05. By contrast, for male faces, there was\nno significant difference between the probability of evaluating the attractiveness of partner's\nResults of rating scores\n(1) Results of rating scores of self-face attractiveness\n(i) Results rated by same-sex subjects\nPaired-samples t tests indicated that for both female face, t(29) \u00bc 3.69, p < .01, and male\nface, t(29) \u00bc 6.29, p < .001, the subjective rating score of attractiveness by oneself (i.e. the Self\ncondition in Table 2) was significantly higher than the score by others of the same sex (i.e. the\nssOthers condition in Table 2). This result also verified the positive bias in the evaluation of\nself-face attractiveness in couple participants from the perspective of rating score.\nTo investigate whether there was a gender difference in the attractiveness overestimation of\none's own face, we calculated the rating score differences between oneself and others of the\nsame sex (i.e. `Self \u00ad ssOthers') for both female (M \u00bc 1.2, SD \u00bc 1.8) and male (M \u00bc 2.3,\nSD \u00bc 2.0) faces. An independent-sample t test indicated that among those in close\nrelationships, the degree of overestimation of males was much higher than that of the\n(ii) Results rated by opposite-sex subjects\nPaired-samples t tests indicated that for both female face, t(29) \u00bc 10.66, p < .001, and male\nface, t(29) \u00bc 8.44, p < .001, the attractiveness rating score of one's face by one's lover (i.e. the\nLover condition in Table 2) was significantly higher than the score by the opposite-sex others\n(i.e. the osOthers condition in Table 2). This result revealed that the participants in love were\nmore prone to overestimating the attractiveness of their partners' faces from the perspective\nof rating score.\nTo investigate whether there was a gender difference in the attractiveness overestimation of\nthe lover's face, we calculated the rating score differences between the lover and others of the\nopposite sex (i.e. `Lover \u00ad osOthers') for both female (M \u00bc 2.8, SD \u00bc 1.4) and male (M \u00bc 3.2,\nSD \u00bc 2.1) faces.

The results indicated that for female faces, the overestimation by\nthe lover was significantly higher than her own overestimation, t(29) \u00bc 3.93, p < .001; for male\nfaces, however, there was no significant difference between him and his lover, t(29) \u00bc 1.91,\n(2) Results of rating scores of the exaggeratedly attractive face\n(i) Results rated by oneself\nPaired-samples t tests were conducted to compare the attractiveness scores of one's own\nface with the scores of the exaggerated face.

To investigate the consistency of the\ntwo indexes of attractiveness evaluation, that is, probability evaluation and rating scores, a\ncorrelation analysis was conducted. The results indicated that the correlation between the\noverestimation probability and the overestimation score, that each image was selected as\nmore attractive by oneself than by others of the same sex (i.e. `Self \u00ad ssOthers'), reached\nsignificance (r \u00bc .36, p < .01).

The results of Experiment 2 were compared with\nthose of Experiment 1 to reveal the special features of self-face evaluation among individuals\nin romantic relationships.\nMethods\nParticipants. A total of 60 single college students (30 females, mean age 20.5 \u00c6 2.0 years with a\nrange of 18\u00ad26 years) participated in this experiment for monetary compensation. All\nparticipants were required to complete the Chinese adaptation of the ECR (Li & Kato,\n2006) to ensure that they were single and not in a romantic relationship. The other\nrecruitment criteria and procedures were identical to those for Experiment 1.\nMaterials. The images of the faces of single subjects were created as described in Experiment 1.\nThe exaggerated faces used in Experiment 2 were the same as those of Experiment 1.\nProcedure. The formal experimental procedure was identical to the procedure of the first day\nof Experiment 1. In this experiment, female and male subjects only participated in the\nevaluation of same-sex faces. Because the subjects were single and had no lovers, it was\nnot necessary to ask them to evaluate the opposite-sex faces, which were adopted to\ncompare with the lovers' faces in Experiment 1.\nData analysis. The data analysis of Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment 1, except\nthat there was no `Lover' condition or related `osOthers' (others of the opposite sex)\ncondition in Experiment 2.\nResults\nResults of probability evaluation\n(1) Results of probability evaluation of one's own face being selected as more attractive when\npaired with other same-sex faces (Self vs. Other)\nA Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated that for both female (Z \u00bc \u00c04.39, p < .001) and male\n(Z \u00bc \u00c04.78, p < .001) faces, the probability of self-face selection as more attractive (i.e. the\nSelf condition in Table 1) was significantly higher than the probability of selection by others\nof the same sex (i.e. the ssOthers condition in Table 1).

These results indicated\nthat the positive bias in self-face attractiveness evaluation did not surpass the exaggerated\nfaces in single participants from the perspective of probability evaluation.\nResults of rating scores\n(1) Results of rating scores of self-face attractiveness\nPaired-samples t tests indicated that for both female face, t(29) \u00bc 3.69, p < .01, and male\nface, t(29) \u00bc 3.78, p < .01, one's own attractiveness score (i.e. the Self condition in Table 2)\nwas significantly higher than the score by others of the same sex (i.e. the ssOthers condition in\nTable 2). This result also verified the positive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness\nin single participants from the perspective of rating score.\nTo investigate whether there was a gender difference in the overestimation of the\nattractiveness of one's own face, we calculated the rating score differences between oneself\nand others of the same sex (i.e. `Self \u00ad ssOthers') for both female (M \u00bc 0.7, SD \u00bc 1.1) and\nmale (M \u00bc 1.3, SD \u00bc 1.9) faces. An independent-samples t test indicated no significant gender\n(2) Results of rating scores of the exaggeratedly attractive face\nPaired-samples t tests were conducted to compare the attractiveness scores of one's own\nface and the exaggerated face.

These results indicated that the positive bias in\nself-face attractiveness evaluation did not surpass the exaggerated faces in single participants\nfrom the perspective of rating score.\nCorrelation results of probability evaluation and rating scores. To investigate the consistency of the\ntwo indexes of evaluating attractiveness in Experiment 2, that is, probability evaluation and\nrating scores, a correlation analysis was conducted. The results indicated that the correlation\nbetween the overestimation probability and the overestimation score, that each image was\nselected as more attractive by oneself than by others of the same sex (i.e. `Self \u00ad ssOthers'),\nreached significance (r \u00bc .41, p < .01).\nComparison of self-face evaluation between couples and single participants. A 2 (Subject type: couple,\nsingle) \u00c2 2 (Evaluator: self, ssOther) two-factor mixed analysis of variance was also\nconducted on the rating scores of self-face attractiveness, with `subject type' as a between-\nsubjects factor and `evaluator' as a within-subjects factor. The results indicated a significant\nbetween subject type and evaluator, F(1, 118) \u00bc 4.74, p < .05. However, the main effect of\nindicated that the score overestimation of one's own face (i.e. subtracting the rating score\nby others of the same sex from one's own score: `self \u00ad ssOthers') was significantly higher in\ncouple subjects than that in single subjects, t(118) \u00bc \u00c02.18, p < .05 (see Figure 1). These\nfindings indicated that couple subjects appeared to have a stronger overestimation\ntendency for self-face attractiveness than single subjects.\nTo investigate whether there was a similar tendency between the difference of probability\noverestimation and rating score overestimation between couple subjects (in Experiment 1)\nand single subjects (in Experiment 2), a correlation analysis was conducted. The results\nindicated that the correlation between the difference in probability overestimation in\ncouple and single subjects (probability: [Self \u00ad ssOthers] in Experiment 1 \u00ad [Self \u00ad ssOthers]\nin Experiment 2) and the difference in score overestimation in couple and single subjects\nFigure 1.

The current study investigated the influence of a romantic relationship on\nthe self-face attractiveness evaluation in two experiments, using couples (Experiment 1) and\nsingle individuals (Experiment 2) as participants. As predicted, the results of the two\nexperiments indicated that the romantic relationship enhanced the positive bias in the\nevaluation of self-face attractiveness, that is, couple participants indicated a stronger\npositive bias than did single individuals. In addition, we observed that a person in a\nromantic relationship was prone to overestimating the attractiveness of his or her lover's\nface. However, the two types of overestimation did not surpass the evaluations of the\nexaggeratedly attractive face.\nExperiment 1 found that the probability of the couple participants evaluating one's own\nface as more attractive was significantly higher than that by the same-sex others, and they\nrated their own attractiveness as significantly higher than did others of the same sex. In\naddition, the probability overestimation and score overestimation exhibited a significant\ncorrelation. Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1. These results consistently\nverified the positive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness in couples and single\nparticipants, utilizing the probability evaluation and the relatively subjective rating method.\nOur results further demonstrated a positive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness in\nextended the effect to individuals who were part of a couple.\nMost importantly, the present study found that individuals in couple status more strongly\noverestimated self-face attractiveness than did single people. Such findings were directly\ndemonstrated by the rating score comparison between the two experiments. Moreover, the\nprobability overestimation and the rating score overestimation shared a similar tendency,\nwhich was supported by the significant correlation between the difference in probability\noverestimation and score overestimation in couples and single subjects. The stronger\npositive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness in couples may be because of the\nhigher self-esteem resulting from couple status (Bylsma et al., 1997), which may increase the\nevaluation of the attractiveness of one's own face (Bale, 2010). People in couple status have a\ntendency to imagine an ideal romantic relationship, turning their lovers into more ideal\nmates, which is similar to the positive illusion of lovers (Murray, Holmes, Bellavia, Griffin,\nturn push them to become better and thus overestimate their attractiveness to a greater\nextent. This assumption was indirectly supported by the fact that those with a higher self-\nevaluation were more likely to succeed in an intimate relationship (Landolt, Lalumie\n` re, &\nQuinsey, 1995). Moreover, the awareness of self-evaluation affects individual satisfaction\nwith and the development of the relationship (Franzoi, Davis, & Young, 1985; Solano,\nBatten, & Parish, 1982; Swami & Fyrnham, 2008); some insecure individuals are unable to\nposition themselves and the relationship correctly (Derrick & Murray, 2007; Downey &\nNevertheless, the reasons why people in couples (compared with single people) have a\nstronger positive bias when evaluating self-face attractiveness require further exploration.\nAnother interesting finding in our study was that people in romantic relationships\n(compared with others) were prone to overestimating the attractiveness of their lovers'\nfaces, which was demonstrated by both the probability evaluation and the subjective rating\nmethod. When heterosexual interactions become a stable romantic relationship, people's\nevaluations of their lovers' facial attractiveness also change. Price and Dabbs (1974)\nobserved that a girl considered a boy more attractive when she fell in love with him,\naccording to the adage, `Beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Conversely, the\nattractiveness of other opposite-sex people decreases in their eyes (Johnson & Rusbult,\ndefined to describe the positive bias favouring the evaluation of the lover's face over other\npeople's faces. Our study did not compare the target faces being evaluated but compared the\nevaluators and identified a similar effect: Someone's lover (contrary with others)\noverestimated the partner's facial attractiveness. Thus, the present study extended the\n`Beauty is in the eye of the beholder' effect to the comparison between the lover and\nothers as evaluators.\nThe two results of the present study, that individuals in couples have a stronger\noverestimation of self-face attractiveness than single people and that people in romantic\nrelationships (compared with others) were prone to overestimating the attractiveness of their\nlovers' faces, both argued against the owner hypothesis, which emphasizes the influence of the\ncharacteristics of the owner of a face (such as averageness, symmetry and sexual dimorphism)\non facial attractiveness (Little & Perrett, 2002). According to the owner hypothesis, the\nattractiveness evaluation of the same face by different people would exhibit no difference,\nwhich did not occur in our study. Instead, our results supported the observer hypothesis,\nwhich regards the biological factors, psychological factors and social/cultural factors of\nobservers to be influential factors of facial attractiveness evaluation (Kou et al., 2013).\nOur study also found a gender difference in the attractiveness overestimation of one's own\nface. Although the male and female subjects both rated their own faces with higher scores\nthan others of the same sex, the overestimation was more significant in males than in females.\nIt is worth mentioning that such a gender difference only occurred in subjects who were in\ncouples, not in single subjects. This difference may have arisen because males have a greater\nneed for esteem for their social role orientation (Kling, Hyde, Showers, & Buswell, 1999),\nwhich indicates that males have a stronger self-approval tendency to improve self-face\nattractiveness evaluation.\nIn summary, the present study examined the influence of the romantic relationship on the\nevaluation of self-face attractiveness and found that individuals in couples demonstrated a\nstronger positive bias in the evaluation of self-face attractiveness than did single people. The\nfindings indicated that the influence of the close relationship is mutual: It affects the\nevaluation of not only the lover's facial attractiveness but also the self-face attractiveness.\nOur results have important implications for the research of self-face evaluation: A close\nrelationship should be considered from the perspective of the evaluator.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: Support for this work was provided by the Natural Science Foundation of\nReferences\nBale, C.
