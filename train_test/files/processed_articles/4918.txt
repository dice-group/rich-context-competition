The ACA, which is otherwise popu-\nlarly known as ObamaCare, extends coverage for preventive\nhealth services without need for a co-payment, co-insurance,\nor deductible for persons who purchased a new health insur-\nof Health and Human Services, 2010). The law specifies a\nrange of 15 covered preventive services for adults; 22 for\nwomen, including pregnant women; and 26 for children.\nPreventive health services include screening and counsel-\ning services such as blood pressure, depression, cholesterol,\ncolorectal cancer screenings, and diet counseling. The spe-\ncific covered services for women include screenings for uri-\nnary tract or other infections, gestational diabetes for\npregnant women as well as breast cancer mammography and\ncervical cancer screenings, and so on (Loosier et al., 2014).\nThe covered services for children include behavioral assess-\nments, developmental screening, immunizations for children\nfrom birth to age 18, lead screening for children at risk of\nexposure, obesity screening, counseling, and oral health risk\nThe starting point for accessing preventive health services\nunder the law is a visit to one's primary care physician. The\nuse of preventive services have been proven to be beneficial\nin enhancing both individual and population health. Ayanian,\nWeissman, Chasan-Taber, and Epstein (1999) have sug-\ngested that utilization of preventive health services can\nincrease the quality of life for people and decrease health\n1Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University, Tallahassee, USA\n2University of South Carolina, Greenville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nVictor Eno, Assistant Professor of Political Science, Department of\nHistory & Political Science, Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University,\nEmail: victor.eno@famu.edu\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act and Utilization of Preventive\nHealth Care Services\nVictor Eno1, Senthilkumar Mehalingam1,\nand Thomas I.

As well, Partnership for Prevention (2007) has\ndetermined that use of preventive services can minimize hos-\npitalization and reduce costs on the health care system.\nBut without health insurance, a patient cannot visit a doc-\ntor's office to obtain preventive health services. The policy\nintent of the law was to expand health insurance coverage\nwhich would provide increased access to preventive health\nservices for eligible Americans. This intent was expressed in\nthe standards related to essential health benefits. The ACA\nlisted preventive services as essential health benefits\nDespite the ACA provision of free access to preventive\nhealth services, there is a huge gap in the use of those ser-\nvices by ethnic minorities including African Americans. It is\nnot clear whether that gap is due to lack of health insurance\nor lack of knowledge about the ACA provision. Our sense,\nconsistent with existing literature, is that African Americans\nappear to have been left behind in terms of access and utiliza-\ntion of health care, including preventive health services,\ncompared with the majority population group (Benjamin &\nracial and ethnic groups continued to have poorer access to\nquality health care services and different patterns of utilization\nrelative to white Americans, including a lower use of preventive\nservices, a greater likelihood of not having a usual source of\ncare, a greater likelihood of being uninsured. (p. 109)\nSeveral studies (Chou, Tulolo, Raver, Hsu, & Young, 2013;\nFiscella, Franks, Doescher, & Saver, 2002; Gaskin &\nMochari-Greenberger, Liao, & Mosca, 2014; Tarver &\nMenachemi, 2014) have investigated racial and ethnic dis-\nparities in access to and use of health care services. Findings\nfrom some of these studies indicate that the inability to\naccess preventive health services is due to lack of health\ninsurance coverage. In particular, the study by Fiscella et al.\n(2002) examined disparities in health care use by race, eth-\nnicity, and language among insured Hispanic, non-Hispanic\nWhite, and African American patients. They analyzed differ-\nences in the use of preventive health care services, such as\nphysician visit, mental health visit, mammography, and\ninfluenza vaccination, and found that African Americans, for\ninstance, were less likely than non-Hispanic White patients\nto receive an influenza vaccination due to lack of health\ninsurance coverage. This finding is supported by other stud-\nies (Brown, Ojeda, Wyn, & Levan, 2000; Doubeni et al.,\nlack of health insurance restricted access to health services,\nincluding preventive screening and diagnostic services, and\ntreatment and management of health conditions.\nIn a study on racial and ethnic differences in preventable\nhospitalization, Gaskin and Hoffman (2000) found that\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be\nhospitalized for preventable health conditions. The resort to\nhospitalization is due to limited access to a primary care phy-\nsician. Patients without health insurance are unable to see\nprimary care physicians to obtain preventive help before\ntheir conditions worsen. In another study, Gaskin, Dinwiddie,\nChan, and McCleary (2012) found that disparities in health\ncare utilization are related to both individuals'racial and eth-\nnic identity as well as the racial and ethnic composition of\ntheir communities. For this reason, efforts to improve access\nto health care services and eliminate health care disparities\nfor African Americans and other minority groups should not\nonly focus on individual-level factors but also on commu-\nnity-level factors such as residence (i.e., zip codes). This is\nbecause the conditions that persist in certain residential areas\nmight limit health insurance coverage and access to health\nservices.\nThe relative impacts of insurance status and race/ethnicity\non disparities in health service utilization have been investi-\ngated extensively (Boss, Smith, & Ishman, 2011; Shelley,\nMost of these studies indicate that although insurance status\nand race/ethnicity are each independently associated with\nhealth care service utilization, race/ethnicity had the stronger\nassociation. This finding is corroborated in Chou et al. (2013)\nwhich showed that race is more significant than insurance\nstatus in accounting for disparities in access to health ser-\nvices. This indicates that disparities in utilization of health\nservices persisted in the presence of health insurance cover-\nage. As initiatives to reduce such disparities have often\nfocused on expanding health insurance coverage for vulner-\nable populations, it is not clear whether theACAalone would\nhave significant impact on reducing racial and ethnic dispari-\nties in utilization of preventive health services.\nDifferent aspects of health disparities have persisted for a\nlong time. Robinson and Finegold (2012) indicate thatAfrican\nAmericans are less likely to receive preventive care and are\nmore likely to have chronic diseases such as diabetes and cer-\ntain cancers. In general, heart disease and stroke account for\nthe largest proportion of disparities in life expectancy between\nAfrican Americans and non-Latino Whites, despite the exis-\ntence of prevention strategies (Freeman, Zonszein, Islam,\nAfrican American women are more likely to be diagnosed\nwith breast cancer (Rugo et al., 2013; Sturtz, Melley, Mamula,\nthis is due to an increase in the number of individuals without\ninsurance, unequal access to improvements in cancer treat-\nments, and barriers to early detection and screening among\nAfrican American women. Given the promise and opportuni-\nties that the ACA holds to address these gaps, it is important\nto review the extent to which African Americans have taken\nadvantage of the provisions of the Act to access and use pre-\nventive health services.\nThe present study is focused on the problems related to\naccess and use of preventive health services among African\nEno et al. 3\nAmericans in the Tallahassee-Leon County area of northwest\nFlorida. It contributes to the existing literature by examining\nthe effects of health insurance coverage, and knowledge\nabout free access to preventive health services under\nObamaCare, on the use of preventive health services. The\nsurvey instrument measured, among others, two indicators of\nuse of preventive health services. It asked (a) whether a\nrespondent had health insurance coverage and (b) whether a\nrespondent had knowledge or was familiar with ObamaCare's\nprovision that insured people can obtain preventive health\nservices without co-pay or deductibles. Data were analyzed\nto determine the extent of insurance coverage among the tar-\nget population as well as the differences in use and non-use\nof preventive services among the insured.\nMethod\nStudy Area and Population\nTallahassee serves the dual role of state capital of Florida and\nthe jurisdiction of Leon County. It has three colleges and a\nwell-educated population made up of professionals in aca-\ndemia, science, technology, business, arts, and so on. For this\nreason, the expectation is that most of the residents would\nhave employer-based, or some other forms of, health insur-\nance. Official county-level data (Holland, Emerick, &\nHoward, 2012) of the distribution of health insurance cover-\nage by race/ethnicity and other categories (see Table 1) indi-\ncate that majority of residents have health insurance.\nAlthough majority of residents are covered, there is a cov-\nerage gap of almost 16% between African Americans and\nWhites: the non-Hispanic White population has 93.4%\ncoverage while the non-Hispanic Black (or African\nAmerican) population has 77.6% coverage. This warrants\nexamination of the extent of lack of insurance amongAfrican\nAmericans and how that limits their use of preventive health\nservices.\nBased on the 2010 Census, Leon County's total popula-\nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives, Hispanics, and Others\nbelonging to more than one racial/ethnic group made up the\nremaining 7% of the population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).\n(The 2013 estimate of Leon County population was\nethnicity, Leon County's population includes 64.4% White,\nCounty residents are of Hispanic origin; Tallahassee-Leon\nCounty Planning Department, 2014). African Americans\nconstitute the largest minority population of the county.\nSampling Method and Data Collection\nThe survey area included the subdivisions of Southside,\nFrenchtown, and other areas in the city that have large con-\ncentrations of African Americans. Simple random sampling\nwas the sampling method used in selecting respondents to\nwhom the survey instruments were administered. Eight hun-\ndred ten printed surveys were administered in the designated\nareas during March to April 2012. The survey was devel-\noped from insights gained from the literature related to\nproblems of health insurance coverage and the low level of\naccess to and use of preventive health care among minority\npopulations.\nThe instrument contained questions that were specifically\nworded to find out whether a respondent had health insur-\nance. At least two questions in the second section of the\nquestionnaire gauged the extent to which respondents used\npreventive health care, and whether a respondent's knowl-\nedge or familiarity with ObamaCare's provision of free\naccess to preventive services had affected their decision to\nuse the services. For example, the third question in Section 2,\n\"I can't obtain preventive services because I'm unaware of\nACA free access to services,\" was based on the assumption\nthat respondents do not typically use preventive health ser-\nvices. The question gauged the extent to which use or non-\nuse of preventive services might be related to the respondent's\ndegree of knowledge or awareness of the benefit offered by\nthe health care reform law, namely, removal of the impedi-\nment of co-pay.\nIn the survey, use of preventive health services is denoted\nby doctor's office visit. The underlying logic is that a patient\n(or respondent) must first have health insurance coverage\nbefore she or he can visit a physician's office. Some questions\nin Section 1 including whether a respondent had health insur-\nance, whether they had a doctor, and how often they visited\nTable 1. Health Insurance Coverage in Leon County, 2011, by\nRace/Ethnicity and Other Categories.\nCategory Percentage\nRace/ethnicity\nAge group\nEducational level\nIncome level\nNote. GED = General Education Diploma.\nSource. Florida County-Level BRFSS Survey, Florida Department of Health,\nBureau of Epidemiology, cited in Holland, Emerick, and Howard (2012).\n4 SAGE Open\ndoctors' offices validly measured the indicator of use of pre-\nventive services. Furthermore, the rationale for considering\nphysician office visit as an active measure or indicator of use\nof preventive services is that physician visit provides oppor-\ntunity not only to obtain general health and wellness checkup\nbut also a chance to ask questions regarding one's health.\nDuring a patient's visit, the doctor has opportunity to\norder tests and referrals, prescribe medications, and even rec-\nommend hospitalization, if needed. Whether it is to obtain\nscreening for blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, depres-\nsion, and for early detection of cancers, or to obtain flu shots\nand information on treatment and management of chronic\nconditions, a visit to the primary care physician is the starting\npoint for obtaining preventive health care. Without health\ninsurance, a patient cannot visit a doctor's office to take\nadvantage of preventive health services. However, even with\nhealth insurance, the need to provide co-pay is often an\nimpediment that discourages some people from visiting doc-\ntor's offices. Therefore, familiarity with ObamaCare's provi-\nsion of cost-free access to preventive health care is expected\nto increase the rate of use of preventive care among this tar-\nget population.\nIn terms of characteristics, it was a low-cost survey which\nhad a high degree of sample-population congruence, mean-\ning the sample subjects represented the population from\nwhich the sample was drawn. In other words, as explained\nbelow, majority of the respondents were self-identified adult\nAfrican Americans who resided in the designated survey\narea. The instrument was in a written form and was adminis-\ntered face-to-face to individuals who were able to read and\nwrite their own responses on the survey. It was explained to\nrespondents that ACA referred to the new health care legisla-\ntion signed into law by President Obama, and that it also\nmeant the same thing as ObamaCare.\nAs indicated above, simple random sampling was the\nsampling process adopted for selecting respondents. In sim-\nple random sampling, each element and combination of ele-\nments (of the population) has an equal chance of being\nselected into the sample frame. For this to be possible, a list\nof all the elements in the population must be available and a\nmethod is used that ensures that each element has an equal\nchance of being selected (Johnson & Reynolds, 2012).\nBecause there is no existing list of all the elements in the\ntarget population (African Americans in Leon County in the\n18-64 age bracket), an estimate was made by disaggregating\nthe African American population in the county into age\ngroups based on the 2013 estimate of race and ethnicity cat-\negorization of the county population. From this disaggrega-\nto 64 age bracket, thus amounting to a potential sampling\na sample size was selected at a significant level of 95%. The\nformula offered by Miller and Brewer (2003) was used to\ndetermine the sample size:\nn\nN\nN\n=\n+ ( )\n\n,\nwhere n is the sample size (i.e., number of respondents sur-\nveyed), N is the sampling frame (the total target population,\nthat is, African Americans in the 18-64 age bracket), and  is\nthe error margin (0.05). The calculation for the sample size\nbased on this formula is shown below:\nn =\n+ ( )\n= =\n,\n, .\n,\n.\nrespondents\nBased on this formula, only 397 persons can be sampled\nfrom a target population of 60,493 people. To mitigate a low\nsample size, it was decided to increase the sample size to\nmore than double the number of people that could be sam-\npled using the Miller and Brewer formula. In this regard, it\nwas decided to administer 810 surveys. It should be noted\nthat this was an arbitrary number which met the expressed\nneed of having a reasonable sample size. Survey administra-\ntion entailed traveling in the defined area and politely can-\nvasing individuals who, through oral questioning,\nself-identified themselves as African Americans in the 18 to\nThe survey contained open-ended as well as close-ended\nquestions. The open-ended questions required respondents to\nselect from a 5-point Likert-type scale response menu of\noptions: strongly agree, agree, undecided/do not know, dis-\nagree, and strongly disagree (seeAppendixA).The Statistical\nPackage for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 22 was used\nfor running the frequency analysis on the data set as well as\nmultivariable regression modeling.\nResults\nlyzed. The distribution of respondents in terms of race\nshowed that 524 were African Americans, representing 66%\nof the respondents. The other 274 respondents were Whites,\nHispanics, and so on, representing 24% of the sample. Of the\ninsurance while 142 (27%) had no health insurance. A major-\nity of the uninsured respondents, 87 (61%), indicated that\nthey use emergency rooms whenever they become ill. Of the\nthat they used preventive health services, meaning they\nchecked \"disagree\" and \"strongly disagree\" to the question:\n\"I'm for the most part unable to visit doctor's office for regu-\nlar checkup because I don't have health insurance.\" Use of\npreventive health services is measured by ability to visit doc-\ntor's office; in other words, physician visit is the proxy for\n\"use of preventive health services.\"\nBecause it was explained to respondents that, in the con-\ntext of this study, doctor's office visits were specifically for\nthe purpose of asking for and receiving health and wellness\nscreenings and counseling services, the responses they\nEno et al. 5\noffered represented indication of actual use of preventive\nservices and not just ability to access those services. Of the\n50 insured respondents who do not use preventive health\nservices, 30 (60%) claim they did not use preventive ser-\nvices because they were unaware that they could obtain\nthose services without cost as mandated by the ACA. This\nresult suggests that a person might have health insurance\nand yet not use preventive health services because they are\nunaware of the free access to those services under the ACA.\nAlthough this is a small fraction of the insured, it is impor-\ntant to target them with outreaches and educational cam-\npaigns so that they can take full advantage of the benefits of\npreventive health care.\nIn addition to the percentage distribution of the responses,\nthere is also graphical representation of the results in the\nform of bar charts. The charts display the relationship\nbetween age, education, and income, and the use of preven-\ntive health care. As well, regression analysis is deployed as\nadditional tool for analyzing these relationships. It should be\nnoted that although other variables such as the social deter-\nminants of health, historical, and cultural issues are signifi-\ncant for explaining access to and use of preventive health\ncare among minority population, this study is focused on the\nrole of health insurance coverage and knowledge about the\npolicy innovation of ObamaCare in explaining the potential\nuse of preventive services among this population.\nDiscussion\nWith regard to how demographic characteristics of age, edu-\ncation, and income determine the use of preventive health\nservices among African Americans, Figure 1 presents the age\ndistribution of the insured respondents who do not use pre-\nventive health services.\nIt shows that 75% of insured respondents who do not use\npreventive care are in the 18 to 24 years age group. Most of\nthe respondents were neither aware of the availability of pre-\nventive services nor the ACA mandate that they could obtain\nthe services without a co-pay. The implication of non-use of\npreventive health services by a large percentage of insured\nyoung people is that they would add to the pressure experi-\nenced by hospital emergency rooms. This is because they\nwould seek urgent treatment when they become ill from an\navoidable health condition, which would have been detected\nand prevented had they visited their doctor's office. Informing\nyoung African Americans about availability of cost-free pre-\nventive health services and the benefits of those services can\navoid illnesses which can be costly in the long term. For\ninstance, if 19-year-old young adults get the flu vaccine in\ntime, they are reducing the risk of getting infected with the\nflu virus. They could also avoid treatment which is more\nexpensive than getting a flu shot.\nWith regard to the relationship between educational\nattainment and use of preventive health services, Figure 2\npresents the educational level of insured respondents who do\nnot use preventive services.\nThe bar chart shows that about 55% of insured respon-\ndents who do not use preventive services indicate their edu-\ncational attainment as \"some college.\" It indicates that less\neducated respondents tend not to use preventive care as much\nas the more educated respondents. It suggests that there\nmight be a link between a respondent's level of education\nand their willingness and ability to seek and utilize informa-\ntion about preventive care. This is a subject examined in\nRichardson, Allen, and Xiao (2012). Disseminating informa-\ntion about ObamaCare preventive (or essential) health bene-\nfits to the less educated members of the African American\ncommunity in the Tallahassee-Leon county area can\nFigure 1. Age distribution of insured respondents who do not use preventive care.\nSource. Survey data, March to April, 2012.\n6 SAGE Open\npotentially result in increased rate of utilization of preventive\nservices.\nAs shown in Figure 3, about 49% of insured respondents\nwho do not use preventive services are in the US$0 to\nThe bar chart indicates that low-income respondents do\nnot use preventive health services as frequently as higher\nincome respondents, even though they are insured. This\ncould possibly be attributed to their inability, or unwilling-\nness, to access information and use preventive health ser-\nvices. There is an urgent need to inform low-income people\nof the availability and benefits of free access to preventive\nhealth services under the ACA.\nWhile the survey data show that a large number ofAfrican\nAmerican respondents have health insurance, a small frac-\ntion of those respondents did not use preventive health ser-\nvices. This indicates that lack of health insurance was not the\nonly reason for non-use of preventive health services. An\nimportant limiting factor was lack of knowledge or aware-\nness that preventive health services are free for the insured\nunder the ACA. Other limiting factors were the age, educa-\ntion, and income of insured people. Regression analysis was\ndeployed to further amplify the evidence in the bar charts\nand the accompanying discussion. For the purpose of regres-\nsion analysis, \"age,\" \"education,\" and \"income\" are regarded\nas independent variables while the dependent variable is \"use\nof preventive health services.\"\nRegression models are useful for understanding the rela-\ntionship between a dependent variable, Y, and one or more\nindependent variables, X\n, X\n, to X\nn\n. Specifically, binary\nlogistic regression is used here because the dependent vari-\nable \"use of preventive health services\" is a dichotomous\nvariable (those with health insurance who use preventive ser-\nvices, and those with health insurance who do not use pre-\nventive care services). The model as shown in Appendix B\npredicts the effect of age, education, and income on use of\npreventive services. The regression analysis showed that the\np value is .9104, where p is the probability of using preven-\ntive care services for the values of age, income, and educa-\ntion. This suggests a high probability (91.04%) that age,\nincome, and education are determinants of the use of preven-\ntive health services among the insured: the younger, less edu-\ncated insured respondents tend not to use preventive services\ncompared with the older, more educated, and higher income\nrespondents.\nHowever, it is clear that there is a significant overlap\namong the age, education, and income variables regarding\nthe use of preventive services. As the figures show, a large\nproportion of the young people in the 18 to 24 age bracket,\nwho do not use preventive services, are also college\nFigure 2. Educational level of insured respondents who do not use preventive services.\nSource. Survey data, March to April, 2012.\nEno et al. 7\neducated, meaning that getting higher education may not\ntranslate into awareness about ObamaCare's cost-free access\nto preventive services and actual use of the services. It is pos-\nsible that the rate of use of preventive services among these\nage and education categories has not improved because\nyoung college students typically feel that they are healthy\nand do not care much about health insurance and preventive\nhealth care. Even with health insurance and familiarity with\nthe ObamaCare provision, they do not care about visiting\ndoctors' offices to obtain preventive services because they\nconsider such a waste of their time.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nTaken together, lack of health insurance is the main reason\nthat a significant number of uninsured respondents could not\nvisit doctors' offices and, therefore, could not obtain preven-\ntive health services. Although a majority of insured respon-\ndents used preventive health services, a small number did not\nbecause they were not aware of the ACA mandate that the\nservices can be obtained without cost. Survey data also\nshowed that the majority of uninsured respondents resorted\nto hospital emergency rooms to obtain both emergency and\nnon-emergency care: 61% of respondents without health\ninsurance used hospital emergency rooms whenever they are\nill. This finding suggests that hospitals bear the burden of\nproviding uncompensated care that not only poses financial\ndifficulties for them but also increases health care costs for\nthe insured. This is possible because the insured subsidize\nthe cost of providing care for the uninsured by paying higher\nhealth insurance premiums (Pagan & Pauly, 2006).\nTo address the problem of uncompensated care, the ACA\nintended for large numbers of uninsured people to be cov-\nered so that they can visit their primary care doctors to\nreceive preventive care instead of depending on hospital\nemergency rooms. The law sought to achieve expanded\nhealth insurance coverage by mandating U.S. states to\nexpand Medicaid eligibility, which would potentially cut in\nhalf the uninsurance rates (Garfield, Damico, Stephens, &\nRouhani, 2014). However, the mandate was struck down by\nthe Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decision in National\nFederation of Independent Business, et al., v. Sebelius, 2012\nthan required, meaning that states can choose whether to\nexpand their Medicaid programs.\nThe fact that states have adopted different strategies in\ntheir effort to extend health insurance coverage to the unin-\nsured indicates that uninsurance remains an urgent public\npolicy concern. It is in this context that a consensus of schol-\nthat governmental jurisdictions need to be more proactive in\nfinding ways to provide some form of coverage for vulnera-\nble individuals regardless of their ability to pay. But it is\ncommon knowledge that states are confronted with multiple\nbudgetary and political constraints, which limit their capac-\nity to provide health insurance coverage for all needy\nindividuals.\nIn sum, the continuing controversies and constraints\nrelated to expanding health insurance coverage to uninsured\nAmericans, including vulnerable minority populations, do\nnot offer any easy or conclusive answers. However, this\nstudy shows that the ACA is a veritable policy tool that can\nFigure 3. Income distribution of insured respondents who do not use preventive care.\nSource. Survey data, March to April, 2012.\n8 SAGE Open\nincrease health insurance coverage. With expanded health\ninsurance coverage, a large number of uninsured people can\nvisit primary care physicians' offices to receive preventive\nhealth services. There is also a need for outreach to enlighten\ncitizens on the law's provision of free access to preventive\nhealth services so that they can utilize the services and\nimprove their health outcomes.\nPolicy Implications and Recommendations\nOur results have some implications for policy and future\nresearch. To address the problems associated with uninsur-\nance, it is necessary to implement the ACA or ObamaCare in\nall its essence to ensure that no eligible American is denied\ncoverage. One outcome of uninsurance is the burden of\nuncompensated care on hospitals which results from having\nto treat and care for people who otherwise would have\navoided illness if they had access to and used preventive\nhealth services. In addition to expansion of Medicaid rolls in\nstates, the ACA also provided for the establishment of state\nand federal insurance exchanges (or insurance marketplaces).\nEstablishing exchanges and expanding Medicaid in more\nstates have already resulted in increased coverage in some\nstates as indicated in a recent study (Witters, 2014).\nHowever, Florida has refused to expand Medicaid, and a\nsignificant number of residents remain uninsured. It is esti-\nmated that if Florida expands Medicaid eligibility, upward of\n80,000 uninsured people, majority of whom are African\nAmericans would become insured (Mitchell, 2014). The\nissue of Medicaid expansion is so divisive in Florida along\nparty lines. However, there is somewhat of an acknowledg-\nment on both sides of the aisle in the Florida Legislature that\nthe state needs to address the problem of uninsurance as\nFlorida is one of the states with the highest uninsurance rates.\nThe problem is lack of agreement on the modalities to\nachieve the goal of expanded health insurance coverage of\nthe poor and some in the middle class who are caught up in\nthe coverage gap (Clemans-Cope, Kenney, Buettgens,\nthat Florida political leaders at the Cabinet and Legislature\nlevels would resolve their political and policy differences\nand agree on implementation of Medicaid expansion.\nOther interventions such as health promotion and educa-\ntional campaigns can increase awareness within under-\nserved communities about the availability and benefits of\npreventive health services. Health promotion and educa-\ntional outreaches can be implemented at the community\nlevel. State and local health authorities such as the Leon\nCounty Health Department and the Florida Department of\nHealth can consider using social media strategies. These\nstrategies can be deployed to enlighten theAfricanAmerican\ncommunity in the Tallahassee-Leon County area about the\nACA's provision of free access to preventive health ser-\nvices. Similar communities in other parts of the state can\nbenefit from such outreaches.\nAgenda for Future Research\nThe present study was limited to a small part of the state of\nFlorida, and the survey data were drawn from a sample made\nup mostly of African American residents in the Tallahassee-\nLeon County area. However, the analysis can be extrapolated\nto explain how other African American communities in other\nareas that have characteristics similar to Tallahassee-Leon\nCounty might fare regarding health insurance and use of pre-\nventive health services.\nFuture research can target an expanded area such as a\nnumber of counties in the Big Bend or other regions in\nFlorida. Some inter-county or inter-regional comparisons\ncan also be done to gain a broader perspective on how the\ntypical minority population in a given region might perform\nin terms of health insurance coverage and use of preventive\ncare. This can yield different insights on the issues of lack of\ninsurance and use of preventive health services.\nAppendix A\nPreventive Health Service Utilization Survey\nSection 1: Background information questions\n1.

Lack of insurance is a risk to my health. \nAppendix B\nRegression Model of Relationship Between Demographic Characteristics and Use of Preventive Health\nServices\nUse of preventive health services is estimated as follows:\nlog(p/[1 - p]) = constant + coefficient(X)\nor\np/(1 - p) = econstant + coefficient \u00d7 X\nwhere\n\"log\" is the natural logarithm;\n\"p/(1 - p)\" is the odds\nwhere\np is the probability (expressed as odds in binary logistic regression) of using preventive care services by those with health\ninsurance at the given values of the independent variables. The given values are derived from the SPSS data set which was used\nto run the binary regression.\nThis odds is transformed into natural log of the odds as follows:\nlog(p/1 - p).\nCoefficient(X) is the coefficient for independent variable X. As there are multiple independent variables, age, income, and\neducation, the equation is\nlog(p/[1- p]) = constant + Coefficient 1 \u00d7 Age + Coefficient 2 \u00d7 Income + Coefficient 3 \u00d7 Education.\nThe result of the equation predicts the influence of independent variables age, income, and education on the dichotomous\ndependent variable (use of preventive care services or non-use of preventive care services).\nThe test results (derived from \"Variables in the Equation\" in SPSS data output) showed the value of constant as 2.064:\nThe coefficient derived for age is 0.391, the coefficient for income is 0.149, and the coefficient for education is -0.285.\nSubstituting these values in above equation we get:\nIf age, income, and education each has a value of 1, the equation becomes:\nTo remove the natural logarithm, both sides of the equation are raised by the Euler's constant e whose value is 2.71828,\nTable Showing Variables in the Equation.\nB SE Wald df Significance Exp(B)\naVariable(s) entered on Step 1: age, income, education.\nor\nSimplifying by multiplying both sides of the equation by (1 - p), the equation becomes,\nTaking the 10.17p from the right-hand side to left-hand side, the equation becomes\nSolving for the value of p\nwhere p is the probability of using preventive care services for the values of age, income, and education.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAyanian, J.
