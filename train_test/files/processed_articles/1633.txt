HIV-infected patients .\nTetanus antibody protection\nIntroduction\nTetanus is characterized by generalized rigidity and spasm\nof skeletal muscles that often progresses to respiratory\nfailure and death. The clinical manifestations of tetanus are\ncaused by the exotoxins made by Clostridium tetani, a\ngram-positive, anaerobic rod, which is found in soil, animal\nintestines and faeces [1]. The causative agent enters the\nhuman body through a wound where the toxins are\nproduced and spreads via blood and lymphatics in order\nto wreak havoc on neurotransmitter release in the central\nnervous system.\nNewly reported cases of tetanus-related deaths have\ndropped steadily since the introduction of tetanus toxoid\ninto routine childhood immunization in the late 1940s [1, 2].\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\n(ACIP) recommends that the first four doses of diphthe-\nria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine in childhood be\ndose is given at age 4\u00ad6 years with a subsequent tetanus\nand diphtheria toxoid (Td) booster given at age 11\u00ad12 years\nadult tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine has been\navailable for adult patients under the age of 65 [4].\ncases was reported annually in the USA [2].

Other patient populations, such as\nimmigrants to the USA (foreign born), are also less likely to\nhave protection against tetanus. In one study, 84% of adult\nimmigrants over the age of 50 years did not have protective\ntitres to tetanus compared to 21% of US-born individuals in\nthe same age group [8]. In another study, 18% of im-\nmigrants lacked seroprotection despite a history of adequate\nimmunization [9].\nAnother population that may be vulnerable to tetanus are\nindividuals infected with the human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) [10, 11]. Previous serosurveys have suggested\nthat HIV-infected patients are less likely to have adequate\nanti-tetanus antibodies (ATA). The progressive decline of\nCD4 levels in HIV-infected individuals could potentially\nlead to lost immunity to tetanus [10\u00ad12]. We speculate that\nimmigrant status within the HIV patient population may\nconfer an additional negative impact on tetanus immunity.\nTo determine whether the loss of immunity among HIV\npatients residing in the USA is a function of country of\nbirth, this study quantifies ATA levels among HIV-infected\npersons born in the USA compared to those born in foreign\ncountries and immigrated to the USA.\nMethods\nA convenience sample of HIV adult patients was recruited\nfrom an HIVoutpatient centre based at a university teaching\neligible, individuals needed to be infected with HIV, be\n18 years of age or older and agree to participate. A\nstructured interview was conducted requesting age, gender,\ncountry of birth, military service, history of intravenous\ndrug use, HIV infection and previous tetanus immunization.\nSerum samples were obtained and stored at -30\u00b0C for batch\ntesting. Levels of ATA were measured using an antigen-\nspecific IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\nkit (Bindazyme, The Binding Site, Inc., San Diego, CA,\nUSA). A nonprotective level of ATA was defined as below\n0.15 IU/ml, as per the manufacturer's recommendations.\nData were analysed using descriptive statistics, Student's t-\ntest and chi-squared analysis, and a p value <0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant. The study was approved\nby the Human Subjects Review Committee at the North\nShore-Long Island Jewish Health System and written\ninformed consent was obtained from each patient.\nResults\nThere were 158 HIV-infected subjects enrolled in the study.\nATA. In a univariate analysis, neither age nor gender\npredicted ATA protection. However, the country of birth\nwas associated with ATA protective levels. A total of 6.1%\n(7/114) of those born in the USA lacked protection,\nSince lower tetanus immunity has been reported with\nage differences in relation to country of birth accounted for\nthe observed differences in protection. The mean age of\nthose born in the USA was similar to those born outside the\nnumber of individuals over 50 years born in the USA (40/\nTable 1 shows a detailed breakdown of age by decade,\ncountry of birth and immunity to tetanus. Overall, the\nfrequency of ATA protection appeared lower in those born\noutside of the USA for the age groups shown when compared\nto those born in the USA. Of note, regardless of where the\nindividual was born, there was a general trend for levels of\nprotection to be lower in the youngest and the oldest groups.\nWithin the US-born group the differences by age were sta-\nTable 1 Lack of tetanus protection by place of birth and age\nn (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) n (%)\nTable 2 Immune status by region of birth\nPlace of birth n (%) Non-immune\nto tetanus, n (%)\nCentral America, South\nAmerica, Mexico\ntistically significant (p=0.001); within those born outside the\nUSA the difference trends were also significant (p=0.033).\nThe frequency of protection of individuals born outside\nthe USA somewhat varied when the general place of birth\nwas evaluated (see Table 2). With regards to military\nservice 2/44 (4.5%) of the foreign born served in the\nserved in the US military. Only two of these persons, both\nof whom served in the US military, had non-immune titres.\nsubjects admitted to past or current usage, while only one\nof those born outside the USA indicated IV drug usage\n(IVDU). All of the IVDU patients had immune titres. Data\nregarding past immunizations were not analysed as most\npatients (59%) were unsure of their history.\nDiscussion\nUpon arrival to the USA, immigrants are required to show\nproof of tetanus immunization or receive the appropriate\nvaccinations to confer immunity. Despite this mandate, this\nstudy shows that the foreign-born individuals infected with\nHIV often do not have protective titres to tetanus compared\nto US/Puerto Rican-born HIV-infected individuals. The\nresults illustrate that the country of birth is an important\npredictor of ATA protection, even among HIV-infected\npatients. These results are consistent with seroprevalence\nstudies of immigrant groups in the general USA population,\nwhere 67% of Mexican Americans born outside the USA\nlack protection [14], and 86% of Korean Americans born\noutside the USA lack protection [9].\nMuch has been written in the literature regarding declining\ntetanus immunity in older patients with one study using an age\nrecommended that all patients 50 years and older be\nevaluated for completeness to tetanus and other immuniza-\ntion recommendations [15]. In our study, there were no\ndifferences in age between the USA and non-US-born\nsubjects, so age did not explain these patterns of immunity.\nWe speculate that either inadequate immunization practices\nin the countries of origin or poor individual compliance with\ndecennial tetanus boosters may contribute to these differ-\nences. If so, vaccination history for immigrants at the time of\nUS entry would require more rigorous scrutiny.\nAmong our study limitations are the over-sampling of\nmen and testing a population from one region in New York,\nUSA. While 66% of HIV-infected individuals enrolled in\nthe study were men, it reflects the current epidemiology of\nthe HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\nepidemic where the majority of cases occur among males\n[16]. Other limitations include patients not being asked\nabout their primary medical care, when they immigrated to\nthe USA or the amount of years spent living in this country.\nIn summary, for US-born individuals followed at an HIV\nclinic, having HIV does not appear to influence tetanus\nimmune status. In our population of HIV-infected adults,\n97% of US-born individuals had protective antibodies to\ntetanus (mean age 45), which is broadly similar to a 90%\nseroprevalence found in the general USA population (mean\nage 37) [7]. It is still unclear from this study whether a low\nlevel of ATA among foreign-born patients infected with\nHIV is due to being non-immunized, inadequately immu-\nnized or having lost immunity and further study is needed\nto address this. It is possible that those born in the USA\nmay receive better primary and secondary immunization,\nbetter care for their HIV or both. Pending further study,\nclinicians who care for HIV patients born outside the USA\nshould be aware they are less likely to have tetanus\nprotection. For the outpatient provider this means taking a\ncareful history for previous primary or secondary immuni-\nzation, or checking ATA titres. For the emergency physi-\ncian this means ensuring adequate immunization when\ntreating routine wounds or considering providing tetanus\nimmunoglobulin (TIG) for high-risk populations with\nsubstantial wounds.\nDisclaimer The views expressed in this paper are those of the author(s)\nand not those of the editors, editorial board or publisher.\nReferences\n1.
