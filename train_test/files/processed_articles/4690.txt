    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground. Chinese herbal medicines reportedly increase efficacy and minimize toxicity of chemotherapy; however, little\nattention has been paid to how poor study quality can bias outcomes. Methods. We systematically searched MEDLINE,\nTCMLARS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials of Chinese herbal medicines combined with\nfluorouracil-based chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone. We screened for eligibility, extracted\ndata, and pooled data with random-effects meta-analysis. Outcome measures were survival, toxicity, tumor response,\nperformance status, quality of life, and Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) criteria to critically evaluate the quality of reporting\nin the randomized trials included in the meta-analysis. Results. We found 36 potentially eligible studies, with only 3 (those\nwith low ROB) qualifying for meta-analysis. Two reported chemotherapy-related diarrhea reduced by 57% (relative risk\nto heterogeneity = 0.0%), with statistically significant results. Stratifying analysis by studies with high versus low ROB, we\nfound substantial overestimation of benefit: Studies with high ROB overestimated by nearly 2-fold reduction of platelet\nexaggerated evidence of benefit and failed to detect nonsignificance of results. Conclusions. In the present analysis, involving\nwere from studies at high ROB. Given the poor quality of the data in studies identified, it cannot be concluded whether\ncombining Chinese herbs with chemotherapy reduces toxicity of chemotherapy.\n",

Important improvements in the efficacy of 5-FU\nwere the Mayo Clinic and Roswell Park protocols,6,7 which\nimproved median survival in patients with metastatic dis-\nease to 11 months, compared with 5 months with supportive\ntherapy.8 Efficacy of 5-FU/leucovorin has been signifi-\ncantly improved by combination with irinotecan and oxali-\nplatin for metastatic patients.9-12 Another significant new\ntreatment development was the advent of FOLFOX\nregimens, which by adding oxaliplatin to 5-FU/leucovorin\nimproved response rates and survival.13 Among metastatic\npatients, alternating FOLFOX and FOLFIRI protocols has\nhelped achieve even greater survival outcomes when com-\npatients receiving FOLFOX suffer from thrombocytopenia,\nand approximately 15% of patients receiving oxaliplatin\nexhibit a hypersensitivity reaction with 2% of patients hav-\ning severe reactions. Serious complications of immune-\nmediated thrombocytopenia may occur if blood count and\nbleeding symptoms are not monitored after the appearance\nof oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity.16\nAnother important addition to treatment options has\nbeen the oral 5-FU pro-drug, capecitabine, which is fre-\nquently combined with irinotecan and oxaliplatin.17 Newly\ndiscovered genetic variations have helped to better under-\nstand variations in treatment success with irinotecan and\n5-FU. Among patients treated with irinotecan and 5-FU,\ncarriers of the ABCB1 haplotype not only responded to\ntreatment less frequently, but also had a shorter survival\ntime.18 Additionally, patients in whom there were genetic\nvariations of the ABCB1 haplotype experienced earlier\nonset of toxicity and reduced effectiveness of irinotecan and\nImproved clinical outcomes have been found with the\ncombined treatment of cetuximab, 5-FU/leucovorin and\noxaliplatin (FOLFOX6) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) for\npatients with the KRAS wild-type gene compared with\nKRAS mutated mCRC.19 Newly developed monoclonal\nantibodies include both bevacizumab, which specifically\ntargets circulating vascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF) and cetuximab, which has an affinity for the epi-\nthelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)20,21. Adding the\nmonoclonal antibody bevacizumab to chemotherapy has\nsignificantly increased progression-free survival by 17.1%,\nand overall survival by 8.6%.22 However, a limiting factor\nto this protocol is hypertension. Significant increase was\nshown in progression-free survival of 3.7 and 4.4 months,\nrespectively, in a meta-analysis of bevacizumab in combi-\nnation with 5-FU/FA, and bevacizumab in combination\nwith irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (IFL), as first-\nline treatments of CRC.23\nHerbal Therapies\nPreliminary data have been published in cell culture, ani-\nmal, and human trial studies suggesting Chinese herbal\nmedicine may have an adjunctive role in colorectal cancer\ntherapy. Mechanistic data have been published supporting\nthe plausibility of Chinese herbal medicine having clinical\nbenefit through either improving host defense or directly\ninhibiting tumor growth.\nInhibition of tumor cell growth and upregulation of\napoptosis have been observed in colon cancer cell culture\nmodels using crude extracts from Chinese herbal medi-\ncines such as Radix Eleutherococcus senticosus,24 and\nGanoderma lucidum.25 Inhibition of tumor cell growth has\nalso been observed using well-characterized purified\nextracts, including curcumin (from turmeric root, Rhizoma\nCurcuma longa),26 allicin (from garlic, Bulbus Allium sati-\nvum),27,28 epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, from green tea,\nFolium Thea sinensis),29,30 genistein (from the soybean,\nSemen Glycine max),31 and tanshinones (from Radix Salvia\nmiltiorrhiza).32 Tumor inhibition has also been demon-\nstrated in animal models: honokiol (from Cortex Magnolia\nofficinalis),33 and triptolide (from Radix Trypterygium\nSuppression of colon cancer metastasis has been demon-\nstrated with the herbal extract fucoidan (from the seaweeds\nKun Bu and Hai Zao, Sargassum),35 and the herbal combi-\nnation Pien Tze Huang.36\nAnti-tumor effects of Chinese herbal medicines have\nalso been identified as acting through multiple molecular\npathways: inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases with Sargassum,35\nFas receptor upregulation, and caspase activation, and\nreduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP,\nPsim) with Bax protein activation and cytochrome c release\nwith Cortex Morus alba.37\nImprovements in host defense mechanisms have also\nbeen observed, which may contribute to improved survival\nand quality of life. These data include reversal of muscle\ncell atrophy in cachexia induced by Rhizoma Anemarrhena\nasphodeloides and Cortex Phellodendron amurense,38\nreduction of gastrointestinal dysfunction following colon\nsurgery achieved by the Chinese herbal combination Da\nJian Zhong Tang,39 reduction of FOLFOX6-related periph-\neral neuropathy with herbal combination Niu Che Sen Qi\nWan,40 and reduction of post\u00adcolorectal surgical time to tol-\nerance of regular diet with the combinations Da Jian Zhong\nTang and Gui Zhi Fu Ling Tang.41 Chinese herbal medi-\ncines may derive their reported benefit for colon cancer\npatients because they are typically used in multi-ingredient\ncombination formulas, thus taking advantage of multiple\npathways of therapeutic action.\nPrior meta-analysis of randomized trials of Chinese\nherbal medicine in colorectal cancer has shown a modest\nate study quality. In the current article, we sought to criti-\ncally examine the evidence for effectiveness of Chinese\nherbal medicines in colon cancer patients, with particular\nemphasis on study quality. We decided to identify for our\nsystematic search and meta-analysis those published ran-\ndomized trials using fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in\nboth treatment and control groups because this therapy is a\nkey component of most standard front-line treatment proto-\ncols for colorectal cancer.\nMaterials and Methods\nSystematic Search\nWe conducted systematic searches of TCMLARS (1984 to\nrandomized trials in any language, to reduce the risk of lan-\nguage bias seen in previous systematic reviews of Chinese\nherbal medicine.43 We sought studies reporting on the use of\nChinese herbal medicine combined with fluorouracil-based\nchemotherapy for colorectal cancer patients compared to\nchemotherapy alone, and synonyms for each term. We also\nexplored references from bibliographies of identified stud-\nies. We first screened titles and abstracts, ordered poten-\ntially relevant full-text articles, and subsequently screened\nthose articles prior to data extraction (Figure 1).\nStudy Eligibility\nEligible studies were randomized controlled trials recruiting\npatients with colon cancer, with allocation to either Chinese\nherbal medicines combined with fluorouracil-based combi-\nnation chemotherapy or the same chemotherapy alone,\nreporting at least one outcome of interest (survival, toxicity,\ntumor response, performance status and quality of life), with\nenough detail to allow calculation of risk ratios. We followed\na predefined protocol for our systematic review (protocol\nnot registered), which included the PRISMA Statement\nguidelines (Supplemental Materials available at http://ict.\nsagepub.com/content/by/supplemental-data).44\nData Extraction\nThree researchers fluent in both Chinese and English\n(M.M., H.L., and C.S.) extracted data on treatment details,\npatient characteristics, study quality and clinical outcomes.\nWe grouped studies by outcome of interest for analysis.\nOnly outcomes with 2 or more studies found were included\nin quantitative meta-analyses.\nStudy Quality\nWe used the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias\n(ROB) criteria to critically evaluate the quality of report-\ning in the randomized trials included in the meta-analysis,\nfor adequate random sequence allocation, group alloca-\ntion concealment, participant blinding, completeness of\noutcome reporting, freedom from selective outcome\nreporting, and other potential sources of bias.45 Each of\nthese 7 items on the ROB assessment tool was given a\npossible score by the assessor of 0 for low, 1 for medium\nand 2 for high ROB. The total is then combined to give an\noverall ROB score. Low ROB was assigned to studies\nwith total score 0 to 4, medium ROB with total score 5 to\n8, and high ROB with total score of 9 and higher, an\napproach similar to that used by previous researchers in\napplying the Cochrane ROB tool.46 The total possible\nscore was 12, consisting of a range of 0, 1, or 2 for each\nscored quality item (Table 1).\nAnalysis of Outcomes\nSurvival was defined as the number of patients who died\nat intervals of 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years following com-\npletion of chemotherapy. Probability of failure (death)\nwas calculated by the number of patients in the Chinese\nherbal medicine plus chemotherapy group, divided by that\nsame number in the chemotherapy-only group. Intention-\nto-treat analysis was used, treating in the analysis any non-\nreported patients at follow-up times as having failed. A\nrelative risk of less than one would indicate the Chinese\nherbal medicine plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy\nconferred a survival advantage, compared to the same che-\nmotherapy alone.\nReduction of ChemotherapyToxicity. Most studies identified in\nour search used the 5-point World Health Organization\n(WHO) scale to report severity of chemotherapy-related tox-\nicity. We calculated toxicity reduction in each study as the\nnumber of patients reporting severe toxicity (WHO grades 2\nor higher), divided by the total number in each group of\ntreatment (WHO grades 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4). The risk reduc-\ntion was then calculated as toxicity reduction in the herbal\nmedicine plus chemotherapy group, divided by that in the\nchemotherapy alone group. A relative risk of less than 1\nwould favor the herbal/chemotherapy combination therapy.\nObjective Tumor Response. We calculated tumor response as\nthe total number of patients experiencing complete as well\nas partial response divided by the total number in each treat-\nment group (complete response, partial response, no change,\nand progressive disease). The relative risk of tumor response\nwas calculated as the probability of tumor response in the\nChinese medicine plus chemotherapy group, divided by the\ntotal in the chemotherapy-only group. A relative risk of\nmore than 1 would favor the combination treatment\nregimen.\nPerformance Status.All studies reporting performance\nstatus used the Karnofsky Performance Scale; most used\na 10-point change as a cutoff for worsening or improve-\nment of performance status, a few used a 20-point change\nas a cutoff. We chose to calculate performance status as a\nproportion of improved or stable status: (greater than 10\npoint increase and no change) divided by a total status (no\nchange plus greater than 10-point increase or greater than\n10-point decrease). The relative risk of improved or sta-\nble status for this meta-analysis included the Chinese\nmedicine plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in the\nnumerator, divided by this proportion in the fluorouracil-\nbased chemotherapy treatment group. A relative risk of\ngreater than 1 would support the combination treatment\nregimen.\nFigure 1. Flow diagram. RCT, randomized controlled trial.\nNote: In the RCTs Excluded box, 1 study had more than 1 reason for being excluded, therefore while the individual reasons total 22, the number of\nstudies excluded is 21.\nMeta-Analysis, Between-study Heterogeneity, and Publication\nBias. We performed random-effects meta-analysis using the\n-metan- command in the Stata software package (Stata\nCorp, College Station, TX), and the I2 measure to evaluate\nbetween-study heterogeneity.47 The Harbord test was used\nto evaluate publication bias,48 and the I2 measure to evaluate\nbetween-study heterogeneity.47\nResults\nStudies Retrieved\nOf the 133 potentially relevant abstracts found, we identi-\nfied 57 full-text articles for further assessment. These were\nscreened and 21 excluded because the study in question was\nTable 1.

Reduction in diarrhea toxicity.\nNote: Vertical dashed line indicates the effect size in this analysis.\nWe found no difference in results of meta-analysis com-\nparing studies with high ROB versus low ROB for reduc-\ntion of WBC toxicity (Figure 6).\nDiscussion\nOur meta-analysis found very limited published evidence\nsupporting the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines when\nused in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy\nfor patients with colon cancer. We found qualified report-\nable results (those published in articles with low ROB) for\nonly 20% (n = 4) of the 20 outcomes identified: diarrhea,\nneurological, platelet, vomiting, and WBC toxicity (all on\nWHO Scale), and objective tumor response. In only 5%\n(n = 1) of all outcomes analyzed were the results of the\nanalysis both at low ROB and also statistically significant:\nWBC toxicity.\nStudy Quality in Articles Assessed\nOver the past decade, our team has conducted meta-anal-\nyses of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with chronic\nhepatitis B,73 advanced non\u00adsmall cell lung cancer,74 and\nhepatocellular carcinoma,75 initially using the Jadad\nRisk of Bias tool has provided meta-analysts with a\nclearly-defined set of metrics with which to efficiently\nevaluate the quality of underlying studies.45 This tool\nasks analysts to assign to each study being assessed a 0 to\n2 score, that in their judgment the study's reporting indi-\ncates a low ROB, unclear, or high risk. This is assigned\nin 6 domains: adequate random sequence allocation,\ngroup allocation concealment, participant blinding, com-\npleteness of outcome reporting, freedom from selective\noutcome reporting, and other potential sources of bias.\nThis score when totaled is used to assign a low risk (score\ndesign or outcomes are subject to bias. In effect, it is an\nindicator of apparent trustworthiness of the reported\ndata.\nfound has virtually no clinical usefulness, because the arti-\ncles in which they were published were at high ROB using\nthe Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.45 Most studies used the out-\ndated clinical outcome for chemotherapy toxicity--the\nthan the 12-year-old CTCAE scale.87 All studies reporting\npatient survival and time to recurrence reported these out-\nprone to substantial analytic bias compared to the more\nFigure 4.

Because strati-\nfying our analysis by the articles' level of risk of bias\nshowed no statistically significant difference in effect size,\nwe suggest that virtually all of these studies to some extent\nsuffer from such risk of bias. Additionally, no studies\nreported any adverse effects monitoring associated with\nthe use of Chinese herbal medicines, a shortcoming com-\nIn short, the high frequency of low-quality and/or biased\nstudies of Chinese herbal medicine undermines confidence\nin the results of published meta-analyses of these trials.\nThis is unfortunate given the wealth of information on\ncombination therapies available from the tradition of\nChinese medicine. The solutions to these problems may be\nFigure 5.
