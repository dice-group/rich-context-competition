Data were collected using semi-structured interviews from\n21 supervisors specializing in the fields of natural and educational sciences and then analyzed using thematic analysis. The\nresults indicated that supervisors communicated understanding about the stalling of studies. The supervisors noted that it\nis important that students have the knowledge and skills suitable to maintain progress toward their degree. However, the\nsupervisors indicated that successful progress depends on a student's initiative to ask for help, believing that because the\nstudent is an adult learner, they should be intrinsically motivated. Consequently, supervisors often adopt a wait-and-see\nattitude in terms of their intervention strategy.\n",

Higher education reforms and the recent economic\ncrises have put pressure on institutions to increase graduate\nrates and shorten the time it takes to be awarded a degree.\nThe arguments supporting this are connected to limited\nfinancial resources, and that long, intense, or complicated\nstudy periods can be emotionally draining for both doctoral\nstudents and their families (Bair & Haworth, 2004).\nDespite an increasing number of studies, student attrition\nrates remain high in several countries (Clarke & Lunt, 2014),\nincluding Estonia (Vassil & Solvak, 2012), the latter being\nthe context of the current study. The problem is especially\nserious in Estonia, because despite the set target of 300 new\ndoctoral graduates per academic year (Eesti teadus- ja aren-\ndustegevuse . . . , 2014) and an overall upward trend in the\nnumber of students completing their doctoral studies, the\nannual increase of PhD degree holders is still one third\nsmaller than planned (approximately, 200 defenses of doc-\ntoral theses a year; Haridussilm, 2015).\nGiven an increasing societal need for PhD degree holders\nto help alter Estonia's economic structure and meet societal\nrequirements, the lack of doctoral students reaching gradua-\ntion is a cause for concern. It is, therefore, essential to deter-\nmine what is causing low on-time graduation rates and high\nattrition rates and what could be done to ensure a sufficient\noutput of PhD degree holders.\nStudies that examined doctoral student attrition high-\nlight two main groups of associating factors: (a) personal\nand (b) environmental (Bair & Haworth, 2004; Latona &\nstudy, we focused on the latter group of factors. More spe-\ncifically, we investigated the perspectives of doctoral\nsupervisors and supervisory arrangements in connection to\ndoctoral students' study stalls and graduation efficiency. It\nis important to note that supervisors cannot be observed in\nisolation from their doctoral students or environmental\nfactors.\nWe first present the results of a literature review and\nreflect on the factors that influence the course of doctoral\nstudents' studies, with the focus on the reasons for doctoral\nstudents' study stalls and dropouts. In addition, we provide\na brief overview of studies that focused on the reasons for\nand types of intervention strategies applied by doctoral\nsupervisors.\n1University of Tartu, Estonia\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: liina.lepp@ut.ee\nDoctoral Students' Research Stall:\nSupervisors' Perceptions and\nIntervention Strategies\nLiina Lepp1, Marvi Remmik1, \u00c4li Leijen1,\nand Djuddah A. J. Leijen1\n Keywords\ndoctoral education, doctoral supervision, stall of studies, supervision strategies, qualitative research\n2 SAGE Open\nLiterature Review\nUniversities have sharpened their focus on the quality of\ndoctoral studies to enhance their understanding of the factors\nthat influence the timely completion of a degree. The under-\nlying factors are complex and intertwined (Lovitts, 2001;\nManathunga, 2002; Pole, Sprokkereef Burgess, & Lakin,\n1997), and no \"single recipe\" leads to successful completion\nfor all doctoral students. Previous studies (see Bair &\nHaworth, 2004) have distinguished two mutually influencing\nfactors affecting doctoral students' study progression: (a)\nstudent-related factors (student cohorts and characteristics;\nthat is, personal context) and (b) environmental factors (insti-\ntutional and structural contexts, including those related to\nsupervision).\nStudent-Related Factors\nAccording to Bair and Haworth's (2004) meta-analysis of\n118 research studies regarding doctoral students' attrition,\nthere are several important student-related personal factors\nthat seem to correlate with PhD students' persistence with\ntheir studies: intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, goal direct-\nedness, positive self-concept, and well-being. In addition, it\nhas been indicated (e.g., by Lovitts, 2001) that personal char-\nacteristics such as intelligence, knowledge (both formal and\ninformal), and thinking style are also key factors influencing\ndegree completion. For instance, Lovitts (2001) found that\nsupervisors consider it important to find \"the right doctoral\nstudents who are well suited for the doctoral studies\" (p. 21).\n\"The right doctoral student\" is, in addition to the already\nmentioned factors, also characterized by academic capabil-\nity. When a student stalls or discontinues their study, a super-\nvisor considers critical thinking skills and/or academic\nDoctoral students'study progress has been associated with\nself-sabotaging behaviors that lead to activities hindering aca-\ndemic progress (Kearns, Gardiner, & Marshall, 2008). For\ninstance, Kearns et al. (2008) found several self-sabotaging\nbehaviors of doctoral students during their studies: (a) over-\ncommitting--where a doctoral student takes on too many\nresponsibilities and high-priority goals such as writing their\ndoctoral thesis suffer; (b) business--a doctoral student deals\nwith minor duties and leaves the impression that they cannot\ndeal with their doctoral thesis; (c) disorganization--a doc-\ntoral student lacks a system and routine that would contribute\nto an optimal use of their time; (d) effort--a doctoral student\ndoes not make sufficient effort; and (e) performance-debili-\ntating circumstances--a doctoral student tries to work in an\nunsuitable (e.g., noisy) place. Self-sabotaging behaviors can\nalso include: (f) excessive perfectionism--a doctoral student\nsets unrealistic and unnaturally high expectations for them-\nselves and their work and (g) procrastination--a situation that\nRothblum, Solomon, and Murakami (1986) define as the\n\"tendency to always or nearly always put off academic tasks,\nand always or nearly always experience problematic anxiety\nassociated with this procrastination\" (p. 387). Procrastination\nhas been considered as one of the most common self-sabotag-\nAhern and Manathunga (2004) have described blocks (the\nreasons for study stall) in three domains: (a) cognitive--for\nexample, a doctoral student lacks the necessary knowledge\nand skills for writing a doctoral thesis, but does not have the\ncourage to admit it to their supervisor; (b) affective--a doc-\ntoral student's self-esteem is poor; performance anxiety is a\nwidespread problem; and (c) social--a doctoral student has a\nweak connection with the department's research culture. It is\nimportant to note that many student procrastination factors\nare interrelated.\nSeveral studies (e.g., Lovitts, 2001; Nelson, Dell'Oliver,\nKoch, & Buckler, 2001; Smith, Maroney, Nelson, Abel, &\nAbel, 2006) have also described student-related interper-\nsonal factors such as (a) support systems, for example, loved\nones who provide important environments of acceptance and\nunderstanding during the study period; (b) family responsi-\nbilities and relationships with significant others, and the time\nspent away from family can create feelings of guilt and anxi-\nety, which in turn can create stress that leads to discontinua-\ntion (Smith et al., 2006); and (c) employment responsibilities\nand financial strain, which have been associated with time\nconstraints and work overload. According to Tinto (1993),\nthe amount of financial aid shapes a PhD student's participa-\ntion in the program to a great degree, as time spent by stu-\ndents on supporting themselves financially equals less time\nspent on the demands of their candidature. In general, how-\never, the authors of this article tend to agree that the advance-\nment of PhD students and the success or discontinuation of\ndoctoral studies are influenced by many interrelated factors.\nEnvironmental Factors Affecting Progress\nIn addition to students' personal factors, PhD studies are\nalso affected by the study environment, with all its regula-\ntions and requirements; the domain-specific traditions in\nuse; and the people who create the environment and affect\nthe functioning in it (Pyh\u00e4lt\u00f6, Stubb, & Lonka, 2009). In\nspite of the harmonizing impact of the Bologna reform\nmovement in Europe, higher education and doctoral stud-\nies are nevertheless characterized by considerable diver-\nsity in organizational policies and procedures across\ndifferent countries within Europe, universities within the\nsame country, faculties/institutes within the same univer-\nsity, and disciplines. Universities set the minimum criteria\nand requirements for graduate students and programs,\nwhile departments control admission, the curricula, degree\nrequirements, and student training, which in turn enables\ndepartments to organize graduate education to fit the cul-\nture of their discipline (Crosier, Purser, & Smidt, 2007).\nHence, doctoral studies, doctoral students, and doctoral\nLepp et al. 3\nsupervisors are all influenced by and affect the research\nclimate; the social practices of the scholarly community\nSupervisors and Supervision\nSupervisors significantly influence the time needed to attain\na degree and doctoral graduation rates (Lee, 2008; Zhao,\nGolde, & McCormick, 2007). Few empirical studies\nsors or their explanations for these activities when dealing\nwith stalled PhD studies. The current study fills this gap by\nexamining PhD supervisors' experiences.\nAccording to Kam (1997), the \"quality of research super-\nvision is a subjective construct--the perceived satisfaction\nof the student with the supervisory process and practice\"\n(p. 82). Advice must be tailored to the needs of the particular\nstudent (Barnes & Austin, 2009). In spite of this personalized\nnature and while there can be no single recipe for successful\nsupervision, numerous sources have suggested several gen-\neral principles of good supervision. Latona and Browne\n(2001), for example, outlined a number of supervisor activi-\nties and responsibilities related to good supervisory practice\nas follows: open and dynamic negotiation of mutual expecta-\ntions and responsibilities, supportive and collegial relation-\nships with students, encouraging students to start early on\ntheir topics, encouraging students not to change topics, con-\ntinuity in supervision; frequent meetings with PhD students,\nand targeted and timely feedback.\nAlthough supervision has been thoroughly examined\nfrom different aspects, there is little research on how super-\nvisors identify factors that hinder doctoral students' studies\nand what they, as supervisors, do on such occasions.\nManathunga (2005) investigated the cues that highly effec-\ntive supervisors use to stay alert to their students' research\nprogress. These supervisors identified warning signs cen-\ntered on four key types of doctoral student behavior: (a)\nconstantly changing the topic or planned work, (b) avoiding\nall forms of communication with the supervisor, (c) isolat-\ning themselves from the school and other students, and (d)\navoiding submitting work for review. Manathunga's study\nalso offers several strategies to recognize these warning\nsigns and develop effective interventions. First, it is impor-\ntant to establish and build a supportive relationship between\nPhD student and supervisor, thereby facilitating the sharing\nof concerns and hesitations by the students. Second, fre-\nquent and individual supervision through regular meetings\nwhere the supervisor systematically monitors the student's\nprogress and where necessary intervenes. Third, provide\npedagogical focus and scaffolding through direct teaching if\nand when the doctoral student needs it.\nManathunga (2005) also notes the importance of supervi-\nsors to model the research process by encouraging students to\nask questions and build their research confidence in the pro-\ncess. This supports Lee's (2008) suggestion that a significant\nsupervision success factor is \"functional supervision\" (p. 271)\ncharacterized by goal orientation and efficient process and\ntime management. Lee also stipulates that a doctoral student's\nemancipation, where the supervisor pays attention to the stu-\ndent's personal development and growth, is also necessary.\nHence, the supervisor is seen as a \"clutch starter\" for their\nrequires that supervisors are able to recognize when their stu-\ndents stall, can determine the causes of the stall, and provide\nencouragement and support so the student can move forward\nagain. It has, however, been noted that not all supervisors are\nable or willing to watch for warning signs and to help students\nthroughdifficulties(Ahern&Manathunga,2004;Manathunga,\nThe aim of this study was to describe doctoral supervi-\nsors' explanations for the stall of doctoral students' studies\nand the activities that supervisors say they take on such occa-\nsions. The following research questions were formulated for\nthe empirical study:\nResearch Question 1: Which factors are perceived by\nsupervisors as contributing to the stall of the doctoral\nstudy process?\nResearch Question 2: Which strategies do supervisors\nclaim to use to assist PhD students through difficulties,\nand which explanation do they give to these?\nIn this article, we view stall of studies to be situations\nwhere there is lack of progress, that is, a doctoral student\ndoes not progress with their studies at a pace considered suf-\nficient by the supervisor (Ahern & Manathunga, 2004).\nContext of Doctoral Studies in Estonia\nAt Estonian universities, the standard period for a doctoral\nstudy is 4 years, during which 240 European Credit Transfer\nand Accumulation System (ECTS) credits must be earned by\nthe doctoral student. To be more exact, during a doctoral\nstudy, 60 ECTS are earned for specialty, elective, and\noptional subjects, and 180 ECTS for the dissertation writing\nprocess. One credit in Estonia corresponds to 26 hr of study.\nThere are two options for meeting the requirement of\ncompleting a doctoral dissertation: A student can write a\nmonograph or a dissertation based on a collection of pub-\nlished articles. In the case of the monograph, the student\nmust have published at least one article in an international\npeer-reviewed journal or a publication by an international\nacademic publisher. The dissertation is generally written and\ndefended in English (which for most PhD students is their\nfirst or second foreign language besides their mother tongue,\nEstonian). A dissertation based on a collection of articles\nrequires three articles that are published in international\npeer-reviewed journals and an overview article that com-\nbines the published articles into a complete dissertation (see\nmore in the summary, by Eamets et al., 2014).\n4 SAGE Open\nIn Estonia, doctoral education is financed by the state,\nmeaning students have no fees (Universities Act, 2015). In\nlished for full-time PhD students during the nominal study\nperiod. In comparison, the average monthly salary in Estonia\nEamets et al. (2014), in their study of Estonian doctoral\nstudents, stated that about one third of Estonian doctoral stu-\ndents work part-time, 35% work full-time, and 14% maintain\nthat they work overtime. Supervising a doctoral student is a\nfaculty obligation; however, supervisors have not been\nrequired to pass any compulsory course on supervision.\nMethod\nParticipants and Data Collection\nTo identify the factors that influence the advancement of\nPhD students, the actions supervisors take when students'\nstudies stall and the discontinuation of students' studies, 21\nPhD supervisors (six in the natural sciences and 15 in the\neducational sciences) from two research-intensive universi-\nusing a semi-structured format.\nThe motive for including supervisors from both the natu-\nral sciences as well as the educational sciences was related to\nvariations in (a) graduation rates and (b) the progress of PhD\nstudents. Namely, doctoral students in the natural sciences\ntend to advance quicker in their studies than students from\nthe educational sciences (see Eesti K\u00f5rghariduse\nKvaliteediagentuur, 2011; Lepp, Remmik, Karm, & Leijen,\nence a discipline can have on the overall study experience of\na PhD student, it is relevant to conduct studies on doctoral\neducation from the perspectives of varied disciplines.\nThe majority of the supervisors participating in the study\nwere either senior lecturers or professors. At the time the cur-\nrent study was carried out, 77 PhD students had defended\ntheir dissertations (29 in educational science and 48 in natu-\nral science), and 16 students had discontinued their studies\nunder the supervision of the participants in the study.\nData Collection\nSemi-structured interviews with doctoral supervisors were\nconducted. The aim and research questions of the current\nstudy, as well as some earlier studies (e.g., Lee, 2008;\nSinclair, 2004), were used as a basis for formulating the\ninterview questions. To first identify the influences supervi-\nsors find as being conducive to study stall, and second the\nactions supervisors themselves commonly take in such cases,\nthe following main themes were included in the interview\nquestions: supervisors' descriptions of their regular supervi-\nsory practices, supervisors' conceptions of the factors that\nlead to doctoral students'study stall and discontinuation, and\nthe actions supervisors take in the case of study stall. For\ninstance, the participants were asked to describe their com-\nmon supervisory actions, to give their opinion about the\ncauses of doctoral students' study stall and discontinuation,\nto talk about their experience and actions (as well as giving\nreasons for these) related to PhD students who either drop\nout of sight for a while or entirely, to describe some of the\nmost serious cases, and to explain when, how, and why they\nas supervisors intervene. The abovementioned questions\nserved as a starting point from which additional detailed\nquestions--concerning the instances mentioned by the\nsupervisors--followed. A pilot interview with one supervi-\nsor was conducted, after which the main interviews followed\nwith a slightly modified interview guide. See Lepp (2015),\nfor the complete guide to the interview.\nAn interview lasted for approximately 90 min, with the\nlength of interviews ranging from 70 to 115 min. All the\ninterviews were audio-recorded. Participation of the supervi-\nsors was voluntary.\nData Analysis\nAll interviews were transcribed unabridged. Pseudonyms were\nassigned to the participants and people mentioned during the\ninterviews. Braun and Clarke's (2006) six phase thematic anal-\nysis model was used to analyze the interviews after the tran-\nscripts had been entered into the computer program QCAmap.\nApreliminary analysis was conducted by two researchers, who\nthen exchanged their materials and debated the results at differ-\nent stages of the analysis (Mayring, 2014).\nFirst, all the transcripts were read and commented on to\nbecome familiarized with the data set. Based on the research\nquestions, preliminary lists of notions about the data content\nin the two focal areas were created by the researchers: (a) the\ncauses for doctoral students' study stall and discontinuation\nand (b) the activities of doctoral supervisors in supporting\nstudents in bridging their study stall or the idea to discon-\ntinue their studies. Then what could be described as intrigu-\ning aspects in the data were identified and systematically\ncoded throughout. Next, after a discussion between the\nresearchers and an arrival at a consensus, these codes were\narranged under four central themes and sub-themes. To gain\na more visual overview, the researchers used the analysis as\na basis for drawing up a thematic map of the themes and sub-\nthemes, after which two other researchers assisted in estab-\nlishing whether the coded excerpts from the interviews and\nthe entire data set were in agreement with the themes.\nIn cases where domain-specific differences in supervi-\nsors' answers were noted, these differences were given spe-\ncial attention by the research group--within the specific\ntheme or sub-theme--in the form of additional analysis and\ndiscussion. For the purpose of increasing the reliability of the\ndata analysis, the researchers held reflective debates with the\naim of realizing a consensus in cases of disagreement (see\nLepp et al. 5\nThe research group determined four main and eight sub-\nthemes relevant from the perspective of the research ques-\ntions. These four main themes were defined as follows: (a)\nthe possibility and necessity of completing the studies within\nthe nominal study period, (b) supervisor's activities to pre-\nvent study stall, (c) supervisor's activities in cases of doctoral\nstudent's study stall, and (d) supervisor's coping with the pro-\ncess of doctoral student's study stall. These main themes and\ntheir sub-themes were followed by results, which were sup-\nported by interview excerpts. The abbreviations ED and NA\nstand for \"supervisors from the educational sciences\" and\n\"supervisors from the natural sciences,\" respectively.\nResults\nThe Possibility and Necessity of Completing the\nStudies Within the Nominal Study Period\nSupervisors, in this study, saw the completion of a student's\nstudies within the nominal study period as not an end in\nitself. They brought out the specificity of the domain, which\ndoes not always enable fast results (e.g., researching people,\nnatural objects, or longitudinal studies). As Anne (ED)\nexplained,\nWhen working with people, to develop something that would\nalso have let's say a scientific and practical relevance, then it is\npractically impossible to complete this within four years.\nAlso, the long review process and time spent trying to\npublish were brought out as a hindrance. In the field of edu-\ncational science, the supervisors also mentioned lack of\nfunding as hindering the nominal process. Many doctoral\nstudents work during their studies in positions not related to\ntheir doctoral research and cannot proceed at the required\npace. According to most interviewees, completing a doctoral\nstudy within 4 years is not necessarily the best option from\nthe perspective of the doctoral student's learning and devel-\nopment. A longer study period and time spent in the aca-\ndemic community can help a doctoral student see the bigger\npicture regarding their particular domain, as well as in\nresearch in general. The supervisors found that where the\nresources stretched further, the study period could be longer\nthan the nominal 4 years, as illustrated by Kristjan (NA):\nIt is not possible to plan science. Research advances as it\nadvances. In my head the plan is that they complete it in six\nyears, they could in four years as well, but each year longer\nthey're here the more they learn. So there's no rush, they have\nanother 30 years to work afterwards.\nSupervisor's Activities to Prevent Study Stall\nThe supervisor's earlier collaboration with the future doctoral\nstudent. Supervisors considered previous positive experiences\nwith supervisee(s), as well as any previous activity in the same\nresearch field, as significant in influencing their cooperation\nprocess. Previous experiences facilitated subsequent interac-\ntions, resulting in a clear and more detailed overview of the\nknowledge, skills, and personality traits and motivation of the\ndoctoral student. Several supervisors (mostly from the natural\nsciences) expressed preparing possible doctoral students already\nat previous study levels, as Kalle (NA) pointed out:\nIt's actually necessary to start grooming a good doctoral student\nalready in the first year of studies. In the first study years you\nhave to look and find the bright students, and then you actually\nstart grooming them.\nIn such cases, most supervisors expressed satisfaction\nwith their doctoral students in the subsequent process, as\nMaria (ED) explains:\nI know them, as they've been as my children from the baby\nstages then well . . . I have no problems in supervising them\nbecause I know how to supervise them.\nSeveral ED admitted having accepted students with whom\nthey had no previous experience to a PhD study. In some\ncases, the supervisors collected background information\nabout the candidate and were therefore better prepared for\nfurther cooperation.\nFinding sources for funding and thereby securing a doctoral\nstudent's employment.The supervisors brought out that\nresources provided by the university are essential in enabling\na PhD student to commit to their doctoral research and not\nto work elsewhere. One of the activities of supervisees from\nthe natural sciences was to find sources of funding to create\na job in their research team for a doctoral student during the\nstudy period. The availability of funding was also men-\ntioned as a condition set by the faculty for enabling a super-\nvisor to take on a PhD student. Therefore, supervisors write\ngrant applications for projects and if given funding, can\nemploy a PhD student to their research team, as illustrated\nby Heldur (NA):\nThe faculty sees if a supervisor has enough resources . . . which\ngrants and finances does he/she have and the infrastructure, the\nexistence of funding. It is the supervisor's responsibility. . . . If a\nsupervisor doesn't have the funds, they won't take on doctoral\nstudents.\nOnly a few interviewees from the educational sciences\ndescribed finding sources of funding and including doctoral\nstudents in research groups. It was often brought up that it is\ndifficult to get funding for research projects in the educa-\ntional domain, and as a result, supervisors lack the financial\nresources for employing doctoral students, as exemplified by\nSandra (ED):\n6 SAGE Open\nYou proceed along as fast as you can and well, there's not much\nfinancing and project funds anyway and so we practically\noperate with our nonexistent finances solely on our brain\npotential.\nThe supervisors in education sciences mainly expressed\nthe expectation that \"funds should come from somewhere,\"\nbut at the same time, they distanced themselves from finding\nthe sources for funding, as highlighted in the following\nexample:\nWell I think that it is the lack of resources that makes them take\non a full-time job, that these kind of resources are not possible\nand I don't see that kind of resource. (Karoliina; ED)\nThese results demonstrate the necessity for the supervisor\nto find funding. Based on our interviews, the participants\nfrom the natural sciences considered research to be a doc-\ntoral student's main job during their study period. The ED\nmainly accepted the idea that the primary source of employ-\nment of a doctoral student lies elsewhere during their study\nperiod, resulting in a prolonged study.\nThe responsibility of the admissions committee to select suitable\ndoctoral students. Several interviewees from the educational\nsciences considered the role of the admissions committee to\nbe important in preventing stalling. The committee should\nascertain the knowledge and skills, personality traits, and\nmotivation of the potential doctoral student. Although most\nof the interviewees were or had previously been members of\nan admissions committee, it was brought out that the selec-\ntion process had not always been sufficient. As a result, some\ndoctoral students among their previous and current supervis-\nees, and also in general, should not have been allowed onto a\ndoctoral study program. Some supervisors (from the educa-\ntional sciences) expressed their dissatisfaction as follows:\n\"the level is low, not enough capable students; doctoral stu-\ndents lack sufficient preparation\" (Sander, ED); \"most candi-\ndates were weak and if we admit a lot of them then also the\nresearch won't progress as it should; I'd like people with\nmore brain potential to come to this domain\" (Vambola, ED).\nA tighter selection procedure during the admission phase\ncould ensure better progress of doctoral students and also\nfacilitate the job of the supervisors during the subsequent\nsupervisory process, as is highlighted in the following\nexcerpts:\nImplementation of the requirements should be stricter. The\nrequirements themselves are OK, but sometimes we're too soft.\n. . . Our usual practice at the admissions committee: we do our\nevaluation and then it turns out that most of the candidates fail,\nand then we add 23 points to everyone and then we can admit the\nrequired number of doctoral students. (Karla; ED)\nOn the contrary, the interviewees from the natural sci-\nences described the admissions committee's role in\npreventing subsequent problems during the study period as\nonly a formality. Preparatory work with the doctoral stu-\ndent was already organized, and the supervisor had ensured\nfunding to employ the doctoral student to their own\nresearch group. As Heldur (NA) explains it,\nThere's a pre-selection taking place so that at the time of\nadmissions we don't have a line at the door. . . . We know which\nproject we have where we can admit a doctoral student, which\nqualities are required for that and which qualities we need from\nthe student.\nSupervisor's Activities in Cases of a Doctoral\nStudent's Study Stall\nThe data analysis revealed four broader sub-themes in the\ndescriptions of the supervisors, which according to them\nexplain why doctoral students stall their study: (a) shortcom-\nings in the doctoral student's academic preparation, (b) the\ndoctoral student's motivation and diligence, (c) personal\nevents in the doctoral student's life, and (d) the material\nresources and time available to spend on doctoral research.\nIn the following section, we first describe in which situations\n(if at all) the supervisors considered it necessary to contact\ntheir students.\nNoticing a stall and communicating with the doctoral student\nduring a break in their studies.Supervisors' descriptions of\nsituations where a doctoral student had been \"out of sight for\na longer period,\" how the supervisor approached the student\nto ascertain what the student was currently doing with regard\nto their doctoral research, and what help they might need,\ndemonstrated that contact time between supervisor and stu-\ndent differed among the supervisors. Busyness was frequently\nnamed as a reason for not contacting a doctoral student (\"Well\nI have other work to do\" [Karla, ED]). Another position taken\nby some supervisors is that an adult pursuing a doctoral study\nmust be intrinsically motivated, be able to direct their studies,\nand take responsibility for the process. Working indepen-\ndently for long periods is how a doctoral student becomes an\nindependent researcher. It was found that asking doctoral stu-\ndents about their research might be unpleasant, and therefore,\nseveral of the supervisors thought it was better to wait until a\ndoctoral student is ready to consult with their supervisor, as\nhighlighted in the following excerpts:\nI think that it's unpleasant to the person when I keep asking all\nthe time . . . I think that it makes them feel bad and so I just wait\nuntil the person comes and shows their work. (Anna; ED)\nED believed that doctoral students get into contact when\nthey have questions or when they have time aside from their\nother work commitments and personal life.\nNA described that it is not possible in their domain that\npeople get out of sight for long periods of time as everyone is\nLepp et al. 7\nconsistently working in a team. There is a work-related\nemployer\u00ademployee relationship with the supervisee, thus, a\ndoctoral student needs to earn their living by doing their stud-\nies. If the doctoral student is not prepared, then the collabora-\ntion is ended, as the following example clearly illustrates:\nIf a person wants help, I help them, but I'm not going to pull\nsomeone who's lazy, stupid and careless through all this. . . . So\nin that sense the aim of my activity is definitely not that someone\nmust receive a doctoral degree. . . . My way is either you lead,\nyou follow or you get lost. (Uku; NA)\nShortcomings in a doctoral student's academic preparation.The\nsupervisors considered the lack of methodological knowl-\nedge, an insufficient level of English, and poor academic\nwriting skills to be the main shortcomings of doctoral stu-\ndents associated with stalling.\nMethodology.Supervisors mostly expected that a doc-\ntoral student received sufficient preparation in the relevant\nmethodology during previous study levels. Increasing their\nknowledge of methodology continues during the doctoral\nstudy in relation to the research topic by consulting with spe-\ncialists and or via courses and training.\nA domain-specific difference appeared with the inter-\nviewees from the natural sciences, who deemed it common\npractice that a doctoral student includes specialists in the\ndata analysis process and that a doctoral student does not\nlearn to perform all the details of data analysis themselves, as\nhighlighted by Kristjan (NA):\nWe have very complicated data analyses and well then we have\nto do it together with statisticians who are separate people for\nthat.\nIt was highlighted that methodological questions and dif-\nficulties are also discussed in research groups and that doc-\ntoral students in research groups also teach their peers.\nIn the educational sciences data, supervisees are advised\nto attend methodology courses and learn how to analyze\ndata. It was, however, mentioned that doctoral students do\nnot always use this knowledge in their research work, as\nillustrated by Vambola (ED):\nThey take some statistics course and learn everything there,\nsolve some exercises and then when they need to use it at work\nthey can't do it . . . and we're back at the beginning.\nAcademic writing. The majority of the supervisors consid-\nered the writing skills of PhD students to be problematic.\nIt was mentioned that doctoral students have problems with\nsynthesizing sources in their dissertation. In addition, doc-\ntoral students often struggle writing the discussion part of\narticles. According to the supervisors, weak academic writ-\ning skills increase the workload of supervisors, as poorly\nwritten manuscripts need thorough and repeated feedback.\nMainly the NA added that doctoral students are included\nto write joint articles with members of the research group\nalready at the beginning of their studies. According to some,\nacademic writing needs to be directly taught to doctoral stu-\ndents, as Maria (ED) explained:\nI tried to explain to them that the overview of the literature needs\nto be a kind of synthesis, but they had still just copied and pasted\nsegments from the sources. . . . I tried to create a sort of a\nstructure for them.\nEnglish language skills. Insufficient knowledge of English\nwas also brought out as a hindrance to the study progress.\nThe English language skills of younger doctoral students\nwere, however, considered to be much better--as they have\nhad a better language preparation at school--than those\nschooled during the Soviet era. In the occurrence of language\nproblems, doctoral students were generally advised to attend\ncourses. In cases where insufficient language skills hindered\nstudy progress, the supervisors helped their students to find\ntranslators and language editors and ways to finance the\ninvolved costs.\nDoctoral student's motivation and diligence.Motivation, dili-\ngence, and persistence were also considered important fac-\ntors for the progression of studies. Motivated doctoral\nstudents were described as persons who are interested in\ntheir research topic and who have the ability to purposefully\nand intently work on it. The interviewees emphasized that a\nperson studying at doctoral level must be consistent and very\npatient. A doctoral student has to know how to commit to\nlong-term goals even when experiencing setbacks and hesi-\ntations along the way, as Uku (NA) vividly explained:\nMental abilities are not enough for doing science, you must have\nan ability to work, you need to have patience. . . . It's like with\npregnancy, you can do whatever you want during these nine\nmonths, but you cannot make the normal pregnancy move along\nany faster, you have to wait the nine months, can't make it any\nfaster.\nWhen the supervisors noticed that a doctoral student has\nmotivation issues and or has informed the supervisor that\nthey wish to discontinue their studies, they talk to the student\nand try to help the student see the longer term goals, as the\nfollowing example clearly illustrates:\nI try to convince them by telling them to hang on in there for\nanother few years, and then they have a doctoral degree that feeds\nthem for life. No one can take it from them, and then they realize\nthat they need to think about their life over the next 30 years and\nperhaps it's useful to get the degree, after all. (Kristjan; NA)\nThe interviewees noted that a doctoral student is only\nconvinced to continue with their studies in cases where the\nsupervisor still has faith in their abilities and the possibility\n8 SAGE Open\nof them completing their studies. The supervisors added that\nin cases they doubt whether a student's academic skills and\ndiligence are sufficient to complete their study, they stop\nmotivating the student. In addition, the supervisors were\nmostly of the opinion that doctoral students are adult learners\nwho themselves decide to continue or discontinue, as Uno\n(ED) pointed out during his interview:\nI'm not a babysitter. A PhD student is an adult after all, and I'm\njust a helper. I've never gone looking for anyone at their home\nor something and if they don't do [their research] then so be it.\nPersonal events in a doctoral student's life.The supervisors\nfrom both domains also highlighted personal events occur-\nring in a doctoral student's life, such as the birth of a child,\nrelationship problems, and illnesses, as a hindrance to study\nprogress. These events were often described in conjunction\nwith the theme of motivation.\nChildren and study breaks during child care leave.Supervi-\nsors generally understood that at the time of doctoral study,\nthe persons are often at an age of creating a family and that\nraising children is an understandable part of everyday life.\nThey also expressed that absences during child care leave\ncan hinder the progress.\nMostly it was mentioned that when away from research\nfor a longer period, a student loses the habit of doing research\nwork, which is why several doctoral students had decided to\ngive up on their studies. There were supervisors who also\nopenly expressed their dissatisfaction with doctoral students\nputting their families before their commitments to doctoral\nresearch. The supervisors claimed that in cases where doc-\ntoral students return from academic leave, it is often difficult\nfor them to get adjusted to research and the work routine, as\nhighlighted by Kristjan (NA):\nThey start the doctoral studies, then find someone, and then\ncan't bear to wait; they have a baby, and then another one and\nthen several years pass . . . it is very hard to return because\nthey've lost the habit to work already--here you have to work\nevery single day! . . . and then they say that they can't do it\nanymore and they'd rather discontinue their studies.\nOther events in a personal life.The supervisors also\nexpressed their understanding toward the influence of other\npersonal events in a doctoral student's life, for example,\nrelationship difficulties with a partner and a doctoral stu-\ndent's own or a parent's illness. If the student shares this\ninformation with the supervisor, the supervisors say they\noffer support and are generally understanding and patient\nabout any drop in the pace of research, as the following\nexample illustrates:\nThey are like your own child to you. . . . You also know how\ntheir family matters are going, why they cannot do research, or\nhow things are with babysitting or some other things and then\nyou try to solve the problems as much as you can, so that they\ncan commit to their doctoral research. (Heldur; NA)\nMaterial resources and the time available to spend on doctoral\nresearch.Alongside a weak academic level, lack of motiva-\ntion and diligence, and personal life events hindering a stu-\ndent's studies, the interviewed supervisors from the\neducational field also mentioned insufficient material\nresources and thereby the need for doctoral students to work\nelsewhere during their doctoral studies. We have previously\nindicated that the NA apply for funding to employ doctoral\nstudents into their research groups. Even in cases where stu-\ndents need a higher income (for instance, the interviewees\nnamed having children, taking up a mortgage), they never-\ntheless tried to avoid that a doctoral student would take up\nemployment outside the university. Additional work at the\nuniversity was offered to the doctoral student; for instance,\ngetting a doctoral student involved in supervising a master's\nthesis.\nIn the educational sciences, however, it was mostly\nalready clear at the admission phase that a doctoral student\nwill be employed elsewhere during their doctoral studies,\nand thus, their doctoral research was not going to be their\nprimary job. The interviewed ED saw working alongside\none's studies as a necessity, because neither the supervisor\nnor the university has sufficient resources to provide the stu-\ndent. Therefore, longer breaks in a student's studies caused\nby other commitments were also considered natural, as Karla\n(ED) pointed out during his interview:\nDoctoral study is a pain. A pain in a sense that there's no money,\na person has to work at their main job and then do their doctoral\nstudies and so they have two primary loads, they have family,\nchildren . . . cannot do research like this . . . in a good case a\ndoctoral student is paid the allowance. How much? 384 Euros.\nWhich is considerably lower than the average salary and now I\n[as a supervisor] have to poke them and ask why are you not\ndoing your doctoral research?\nSupervisor's Coping With the Process of a\nDoctoral Student's Study Stall\nWhen analyzing the text excerpts where the supervisors\ndescribed students' study stalls, then with only a few excep-\ntions was a doctoral student's progress directly linked to their\nsupervisor's activity (i.e., problems were observed in the\nactions of both parties), as Riina (ED) explains it,\nTo be honest I do think that it was a two-way process that they\ndidn't complete their studies. Maybe I didn't support them\nenough, maybe they needed more help.\nSeveral supervisors brought out how students' study stall\naffected their motivation to supervise a doctoral student.\nLepp et al. 9\nWhen the supervisor sensed it unlikely for a student to com-\nplete their studies (i.e., according to the supervisor, the doc-\ntoral student is not capable, motivated, nor diligent enough;\nhas too much other work or family commitments), they also\ncease to contribute to the supervision. It was found that a\none-sided effort (i.e., supervisor's) is not enough, as illus-\ntrated below by Anna (ED):\nNow another year has passed. . . . Last time I bothered them was\na long time ago, and I don't know how can I make them to write\nthe dissertation? I can't make an adult person to write. . . . In the\nend the supervisor also loses motivation.\nHow the supervisors get past difficult supervision situa-\ntions was discussed in a few interviews. For example, it was\nmentioned that they discuss problems with other supervisors\nfrom the research group or with a co-supervisor. It was also\nemphasized that colleagues' advice and suggestions had not\nalways solved the problems, and it was said that because the\nproblems mostly came from the PhD student, it is hard to\nsolve the situations. Several participating supervisors also\nbelieved that supervisors need to manage everything by\nthemselves and there is no need to support the supervisor\nspecifically or to train them in management, as highlighted\nby Uno (ED):\nI think that supervisors are independent enough, and I guess it\nhas to be like that. Who else would know how to supervise a\nsupervisor?\nOverall, supervisors use different strategies in cases of\nstudy stall and are mostly understanding when the study time\nstretches longer than the nominal period of study. However,\nthey also think that the responsibility for the studies lies with\nthe doctoral student, as was concluded by the words of Uku\n(NA):\nYou can't make anyone become a researcher! You have to want\nto do this, and if you do, then my job [as a supervisor] is to help\nyou. If a person doesn't wish to become a researcher, then they\ncan do something better then.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe aim of this study was to explore doctoral supervisors'\nexplanations for the stall of doctoral students' studies and to\ndescribe the activities that they said they take on such occa-\nsions. We discuss some of the main results and conclude with\nrecommendations for making changes in doctoral study\narrangements.\nOverall, the results of this study align with results of other\nthe importance of getting the \"right applicants\" from a super-\nvisor's perspective. Therefore, one of the possible solutions\nfor preventing slowing of the study progress is to find the\nright doctoral student, that is, someone whose abilities and\nmotivation are well suited.\nThe results of the current research showed that the inter-\nviewed supervisors considered previous positive experiences\nwith the supervisee(s), as well as previous activity in the\nsame research field, as a significant and positive influence on\nthe cooperation process. However, such an approach consid-\nerably narrows down the available selection of \"able\" doc-\ntoralstudents,especiallyinthecontextofinternationalization.\nTherefore, it would be important to discuss the issue openly\nwith supervisors to find solutions on how to guarantee the\nquality of doctoral students as well as the feeling of security\nexpected by supervisors while starting cooperation with an\nunknown doctoral student.\nIn relation to this, what is novel about the results is that\nonly a few of the educational sciences supervisors claimed\nto systematically and purposefully prepare potential doc-\ntoral students for doctoral study, while this was considered\nto be a natural part of the process among the NA. Thus, both\nsupervisors from the educational and natural sciences\nexpected doctoral students to have a prior thorough prepara-\ntion when entering doctoral study and the ability to be as\nindependent as possible during their studies. However, the\nsupervisors also did preliminary work to a different extent\nso that the doctoral student could be successful in their stud-\nies. Knowing that the graduating efficiency is higher in the\nnatural sciences (see, for example, Gardner, 2009; Ots,\nLeijen, & Pedaste, 2012), we suggest that this theme should\ntherefore be analyzed more when developing a doctoral\nstudy program. In our opinion, the organization of doctoral\nstudies should move more toward the aim of a systematic,\npurposeful, and substantive preparation of a doctoral stu-\ndent, and the functional cooperation between a doctoral\napplicant and a potential supervisor should already begin\nduring previous study levels or that previous cooperation\nshould be at least sufficiently long so that the supervisor and\nsupervisee have the opportunity to understand each other's\nexpectations and working style before the potential student\napplies for a doctoral study. Closer communication with a\nsupervisor would also be necessary to enable a doctoral can-\ndidate to get an overview of the nature of doctoral studies,\nincluding the knowledge and personality traits expected\nfrom a doctoral student and the demands set by doctoral\nstudies to a doctoral student's daily life. This would prevent\nand lessen situations where the cooperation falters due to a\nlack of clarity regarding communication and competencies.\nOne practical recommendation for preparing suitable candi-\ndates for doctoral study is the idea of a pre-PhD programs\noffered by Sonneveld (2015), the aim of which is to test stu-\ndent candidates' motivation (i.e., doctoral students' ambi-\ntions), while also helping the students to develop their\nresearch plan and allowing them to communicate and build\na relationship with their supervisor.\nAnother interesting theme we discovered, which is also\nlinked to the previous sub-themes, is the dissatisfaction sev-\neral supervisors (from educational sciences) expressed with\nthe knowledge and skills of their doctoral students and the\nstrategies they claimed to use to develop these. If the knowl-\nedge and skills of a doctoral student were considered insuf-\nficient for them to progress in their studies, then the ED\nexpressed that these doctoral students should attend relevant\ncourses to address these shortcomings. In the case of doc-\ntoral students' study stalls, Ahern and Manathunga (2004)\nhave also recommended that supervisors should first seek to\nfind out the origin of the block. If the cause of a block is in\nthe cognitive domain (e.g., a doctoral student has insufficient\nacademic writing skills), it will be efficient to advise the stu-\ndent to attend suitable courses. In the present study, teaching\nby supervisors (e.g., teaching academic writing) was only\nmentioned in a few cases. However, previous studies (e.g.,\nManathunga, 2005) have demonstrated that a pedagogical\nfocus--direct teaching--is essential during doctoral study to\navoid study stall.\nThe results of this study demonstrated that doctoral stu-\ndents in the natural sciences have daily contact with their\nsupervisors and often have an employer\u00ademployee relation-\nship. However, doctoral students from the educational sci-\nences mostly have day jobs unrelated to their doctoral\nresearch. The investigated supervisors noted that work com-\nmitments are often the reason for longer breaks in a doctoral\nstudent's studies, and the supervisors often do not have an\noverview of the doctoral student's progress and activities.\nThis formed the basis of the supervisors'strategy in the cases\nof study stall. In situations where the supervisor had no\nemployment relationship with the supervisee, the supervi-\nsors created a kind of \"defense explanation\" for themselves.\nIn other words, as they do not provide the doctoral student\nwith any funding, they also do not have the right to demand\nfaster progress with their studies. Therefore, specific dead-\nlines for finishing different stages of doctoral research are\nnot set, and regular contact with the doctoral student is not\nmaintained. Previous studies (e.g., Brew & Peseta, 2004;\nLee, 2008) have, however, demonstrated that regular meet-\nings are crucial for the study to progress.\nFollowing Manathunga's (2005) advice, contact between\na supervisor and a supervisee should be regular, as this allows\nfor systematic monitoring of the doctoral student's progress.\nIn addition, it also gives the supervisor the opportunity to\nmodel the research process. This can also lead to situations\nwhere independent work periods (especially after complet-\ning the mandatory classes) leave a doctoral student alone in\nthe process. Previous studies (e.g., Stubb, Pyh\u00e4lt\u00f6, & Lonka,\n2011) have demonstrated that being left alone, as a doctoral\nstudent, is a substantial factor behind study stall and discon-\ntinuation. Interaction between doctoral students and their\nresearch environments leads to a greater acquisition of\nknowledge and student development, and is therefore central\nfor succeeding in one's studies (e.g., Lovitts, 2001; Pyh\u00e4lt\u00f6\nthat the reasons for a doctoral student's slow progress and\nstudy stall can be related to aspects of their social domain,\nthat is, a doctoral student's weak connection with the depart-\nment's research culture is often a factor that hinders the stu-\ndent's study progress. Our suggestion for supervisors is,\ntherefore, to incorporate the student into the research com-\nmunity. Therefore, it is important to teach and train supervi-\nsors institutionally, including aspects of how to support\ndifferent students.\nBecause the results demonstrate that the employee\u00ad\nemployer relationship gives the supervisor more opportunity\nto support a doctoral student's progress, the universities\ncould also discuss to what extent working as a supervisor is\neven justified in cases where there are no research projects\nand hence, no financial support. In the case of working in a\nresearch group, it is important to observe that a doctoral stu-\ndent maintains the possibility to develop into an independent\nresearcher and to prevent a situation where the doctoral stu-\ndent just remains the supervisor's underling. However, a par-\nallel analysis is needed if solely large (financed) research\nprojects and research groups would also cover themes in\nsociety that are related to developing smaller and narrower\nresearch areas. In the context of a small country such as\nEstonia, it is especially important as big research groups\nhave high research capability (and thus, the possibility to\nobtain financial support for their research projects), but there\nis a danger of developing a limited number of research top-\nics, and many important practical problems may not reach\nhigh-quality studies.\nWe also consider relevant the result where the participat-\ning supervisors considered completing a doctoral study\nwithin the nominal 4 years not that important for them, as a\nlonger study period enables the doctoral student to spend\nmore time in the research environment and facilitate more\ncomprehensive learning. Thus, it is possible that several\nsupervisors also select a supervising strategy which, provok-\ningly, can be named as a \"patiently waiting\" or \"wait-and-\nsee\" attitude. However, this view can also be a \"defense\nexplanation,\" that is, since the supervisor has not been able\nto help their supervisee to reach the dissertation defense\nwithin the nominal period, the supervisor justifies this as a\nnon-priority goal. Therefore, we think that a debate in the\neducation field is needed to discuss the shared understanding\nof the nominal period for a doctorial study and the necessity\nto graduate within the nominal period of study, and whether\nand to what extent it is even necessary that the doctorial\nstudy period is so rigidly laid out in the first place. It is pos-\nsible that if a supervisor does not put value to a student com-\npleting their studies within the nominal study, values lifelong\nlearning and personal development, and prefers a longer\nstudy period to a fast completion, and hence, a longer period\nof staying in the research world, then it is hard to make the\nsupervisory cooperation more efficient. Hence, we suggest\nthat it is first necessary to ascertain supervisors', doctoral\nstudents', and institutions' expectations about doctoral study\nand accordingly design strategies.\nThe last sub-theme in the results that particularly attracted\nour attention was how the supervisors described their activi-\nties in cases where a doctoral student stalls or wishes to dis-\ncontinue their studies. With only a few exceptions, the\nreasons were described as also supervisor related. It is well\nknown that the supervisor is one of the central success fac-\ntors in the doctoral study process (see, for example, Golde,\nparticipating supervisors emphasized their role to such a\nsmall extent. A discussion is also needed about the role of a\nsupervisor and their tasks during the study process of a doc-\ntoral student and whether supervisors should be offered\nopportunities for self-analysis and reflection.\nAlthough this article reports on a small-scale study in\nwhich the narrow focus poses certain limitations, we find\nthat the above-described implications could benefit doctoral\nprograms in Estonia and other countries facing similar chal-\nlenges. It is important that supervisors are aware of the pos-\nsible hindrances students can experience during their doctoral\nstudy, can notice them, and know efficient and useful support\nstrategies. Debates to ascertain the different parties' expecta-\ntions are also important. Further research could, in our opin-\nion, concentrate on doctoral students' views on their\nsupervisors' activity or the lack of in cases of study stall.\nAdditional value to increase the credibility of the findings of\nthis study could be brought about by researching supervisors'\nactual activities and practices.\n"
