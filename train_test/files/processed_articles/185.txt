The study evaluated children 2 months\nthrough 5 years of age participating in the Third National\nThe group was a representative sample of the US popu-\nlation (N  7680). A parental report of household smok-\ning or maternal smoking during pregnancy ascertained\nETS exposure. Respiratory outcomes were based on pa-\nrental report of wheezing, cough, upper respiratory in-\nfection, or pneumonia in the last 12 months and chronic\nbronchitis or physician-diagnosed asthma at any time.\nLogistic regression was used to adjust for age, sex, race/\nethnicity, birth weight, day care, family history of al-\nlergy, breastfeeding, education level of head of house-\nhold, and household size.\nResults. Approximately 38% of children were pres-\nently exposed to ETS in the home, whereas 23.8% were\nexposed by maternal smoking during pregnancy. ETS\nexposure increased chronic bronchitis and three or more\nepisodes of wheezing among children 2 months to 2\nyears old and asthma among children 2 months to 5 years\nold. For household exposure, a consistent effect was seen\nonly at >20 cigarettes smoked per day. Adjusted odds\nratios for increased risk (95% confidence interval) for\nhousehold exposures (>20 cigarettes smoked per day vs\nnone smoked) and maternal prenatal exposure (prenatal\nsmoking vs no smoking), respectively, for children 2\nmonths to 2 years old were chronic bronchitis, 2.5 (1.6,\nwithin the past month of prescription medications for\nasthma (-agonists or inhaled steroids) was not different\nbetween those with asthma reporting ETS exposure and\nthose reporting no exposure; percent of patients with\nasthma reporting use of medication by household expo-\nof patients with asthma reporting use of medication by\nmaternal smoking during pregnancy was no, 28.9%; yes,\n22.7%. Among children 2 months to 2 years of age ex-\nposed to ETS, 40% to 60% of the cases of asthma, chronic\nbronchitis, and three or more episodes of wheezing were\nattributable to ETS exposure.

The reported prevalence of\nasthma, wheezing, and chronic bronchitis was increased\nwith ETS exposures. No statistically significant increase\nin the prevalence of upper respiratory infection, pneu-\nmonia, or cough was associated with ETS exposure. ETS\nexposure has little effect on the respiratory health of\nchildren between 3 and 5 years of age, with the exception\nof asthma. ETS appears to increase the prevalence of\nasthma rather than the severity as measured by medica-\ntion use. These findings reinforce the need to reduce the\nexposure of young children to ETS.

ETS, environmental tobacco smoke; NHANES\nIII, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey;\nCHS, Child Health Supplement; NHIS, National Health Interview\nSurvey; URI, upper respiratory infection.\nEnvironmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a highly\nprevalent respiratory irritant. A recent meta-\nanalyses concluded that ETS plays an impor-\ntant role in the health of children.1 However, in re-\ngard to respiratory health, the report noted there\nwere gaps in the literature. Many of the samples\nstudied were small and may not have been suitable\nto generalization. Few studies have data on the many\nfactors that contribute to respiratory health in the\nfirst 5 years of life (eg, birth weight, socioeconomic\nstatus, family history of atopy, day care attendance,\nand so forth), thus making it impossible to identify\nthe independent contribution of ETS. The effect of\nETS appears to change depending on the age stud-\nFrom the *Center for Primary Care, Agency for Health Care Policy and\nResearch, Rockville, Maryland; Klemm Analysis Group, Inc, Hyattsville,\nMaryland; \u00a7National Center for Health Care Statistics, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland; and National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health,\nBethesda, Maryland.\nThis article does not represent the policy of the Agency for Health Care\nPolicy and Research (AHCPR).

Much of the work in young children has focused\non the first year of life, when a strong effect has been\nreported consistently.2\u00ad4 The few studies that have\nattempted to evaluate the change in the effect of ETS\nover the first 5 or so years of life have found the effect\nof ETS is limited primarily to the first several years of\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnations Survey (NHANES III), a representative sam-\nple of the US population, offered a unique dataset in\nwhich information on ETS exposure, respiratory\nhealth, and cofactors was collected. The objectives of\nthese analyses are to evaluate the effect of ETS expo-\nsure on the reported respiratory health of children 2\nmonths through 5 years of age in the United States\nwhile taking into account the relevant cofactors and\nto calculate the excessive number of cases of the\nvarious respiratory conditions attributable to ETS\nexposure.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population and Sample Design\nCenter for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, GA.7 A stratified multistage clustered prob-\nability design was used to select a sample of the civilian noninsti-\ntutionalized US population 2 months of age. A total of 81 loca-\ntions were selected for inclusion in the final sample. The protocol\nincluded a home interview followed by a physical examination in\na mobile examination center. The study was approved by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics' Institutional Review Board.\nDemographic Characteristics\nAge at the time of interview is reported as age in years at the\nlast birthday, except for children 1 year of age, for whom age in\nmonths is reported. Self-reported race/ethnicity was categorized\nas non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, or\nother. The education level of the head of the household was the\nhighest grade completed. Household size was based on the num-\nber of persons living in the house regardless of relationships.\nVariable Definition\nParents were asked whether the child was ever breastfed or fed\nbreast milk and the age when the child stopped breastfeeding\ncompletely. Children who were breastfed until at least 1 month of\nage were classified as ever breastfed. A family history of allergies\nwas the self-report of asthma or hay fever at any age in either\nbiologic parent. Day care was defined as attendance at a day care\ncenter or nursery school where there were six or more children for\nat least 10 hours per week for 1 or more months. Birth weight was\nderived from birth certificates (87.2%) and maternal report at the\ntime of the household interview (12.8%), when the birth certificate\nwas not available. Birth weight was used as a categoric variable in\nself-reported use of -agonists or inhaled steroids within the\nmonth before the household interview. Asthma and chronic bron-\nchitis required the self-report of a physician's diagnosis at any\ntime in the past. The number of self-reported episodes of wheez-\ning or whistling in the chest, cough, and upper respiratory infec-\ntion (URI) during the past 12 months were categorized into two\ngroups: none to two, and three or more. Self-reported pneumonia\nduring the past 12 months was categorized as none, one or more,\nbecause of its infrequent occurrence.\nETS Exposure\nReported ETS exposure was classified in two different ways:\ncurrent household exposure and maternal smoking at any time\nduring the pregnancy. Current household exposure was defined\nas the total number of cigarettes smoked by household members\nin the house per day. Smoking by visitors or guests was not asked.\nThree categories were defined: none, 1 to 19 cigarettes smoked per\nday, and 20 cigarettes smoked per day. Previous analyses from\nNHANES III reported that household exposure was significantly\nassociated with serum cotinine levels and accounted for most of\nthe explained variance in the regression models among partici-\npants 4 years of age.8\nIt was not possible to identify the mother among the reported\nsmokers in the household. However, information was collected on\nthe biologic mother's smoking during pregnancy. Maternal smok-\ning during pregnancy was used as a surrogate for current mater-\nnal smoking, because a high percent of women who smoking\nduring pregnancy continue smoking through at least the first 5\nyears of the child's life.9,10\nStatistical Methods\nAll estimates were calculated using the sampling weights to\nrepresent children 2 months through 5 years of age in the United\nStates. The sampling weights were created to adjust for unequal\nprobabilities of selection and adjusted to account for nonresponse\nand poststratified to the US population as estimated by the Bureau\nof the Census. Statistical analyses were performed using\nSUDAAN,11 a program that adjusted for the complex sample\ndesign when calculating variance estimates. All confidence inter-\nvals shown are at the 95% level.\nModeling and Attributable Risk\nThe association between exposure and outcome was evaluated\nby analyzing stratified two-way contingency tables, testing the\nhypothesis of independence versus general association. Linear\ncontrasts were used to evaluate differences in outcome propor-\ntions between groups exposed to ETS and those not exposed.\nLogistic regression models were then developed to account for\nother factors that might affect the association between ETS expo-\nsure and each respiratory outcome. Separate models were devel-\noped for the age groups 2 months through 2 years, 3 years through\n5 years, and 2 months through 5 years, which included main\neffects other than exposure only when they or interactions be-\ntween them were significant at P  .05.\nFinally, the proportion of the prevalence of each outcome\namong exposed groups that can be attributed to ETS was calcu-\nlated from the logistic model parameters.12 The resulting propor-\ntions were multiplied by the estimates of the exposed population\nto obtain the number of excess cases attributable to ETS. Totals for\nobservations with missing values were distributed among the\ncategories in proportion to the distributions of outcome by expo-\nsure for the sample of observations with complete information.\nResponse Rate of the Interview Sample\nAmong white, black, and Mexican-American children 2 months\nthrough 5 years of age (N  8238) selected for the NHANES III\ninformation on ETS exposure. The nonresponse for all other vari-\nables used in the analyses within the group with complete data on\nETS exposure was 2.1%.\nRESULTS\nExposure to ETS varied by the measure evaluated.\nBased on current household exposure, 61.6% of the\nchildren lived in homes with no smoke exposure,\nrettes were smoked per day and 14.5% in homes\nwhere 20 cigarettes were smoked per day. Smoking\nduring pregnancy was reported by 23.8% of the bi-\nologic mothers. Mexican-American children were ex-\nposed to the lowest levels of ETS, whereas non-\nHispanic white children were exposed to the highest\nlevels. Little difference was seen by age or sex.\nAmong all children, diagnosed asthma, chronic\nbronchitis, and three or more episodes of wheezing\nincreased with increased ETS exposure, regardless of\nwhich measure of exposure was used (Table 1). For\nhousehold exposure, the effect was seen most con-\nsistently when ETS exposure was 20 cigarettes per\nday. Exposure to 20 cigarettes appeared to be pro-\ntective for URI, whereas smoking during pregnancy\nhad no effect. The negative association of ETS with\nURI disappeared after adjusting for breastfeeding,\nday care, and race (data not shown). Pneumonia and\nthree or more episodes of cough showed no signifi-\ncant association to ETS and were excluded from ad-\nditional analyses.\nThe effect of ETS varied by age (Table 2). When the\nsample was divided into two age groups (children 2\nmonths to 2 years of age and children 3 years to 5\nyears of age), ETS was associated with diagnosed\nasthma, chronic bronchitis, and three or more epi-\nsodes of wheezing in the younger age group. In the\nolder age group, only the association between ETS\nand diagnosed asthma remained statistically signifi-\ncant.\nLogistic regression analyses were performed to\nevaluate the role of potential confounders on the\nrelationship observed between ETS and respiratory\noutcomes (Table 3). Models were created for the\nall-ages group of children, for children 2 months to 2\nyears of age, and for children 3 years to 5 years age\ngroups separately, using both definitions of ETS ex-\nposure. When ETS was defined as household expo-\nsure, the strongest effect was seen consistently in the\n2 months to 2 years age group among children living\nin households where 20 cigarettes were smoked\nper day, with the exception of diagnosed asthma, for\nwhich the adjusted odds ratios were similar in the\nyounger and older age groups. Similar results were\nseen when ETS was defined as smoking during preg-\nnancy.\nAdditional analyses investigated whether expo-\nsure to ETS increased the use of asthma medication\namong children with asthma. Reported use within\nthe past month of prescription medications for\nasthma (-agonists or inhaled steroids) was not dif-\nferent between those with asthma reporting ETS ex-\nposure and those reporting none; percent of those\nwith asthma reporting use of medication by house-\nper day, 23.1% (P  .4); percent of those with asthma\nreporting use of medication by maternal smoking\nAttributable Risk\nThe excess number of cases attributable to ETS\nexposure after adjustment for the relevant confound-\ners was calculated. The findings were similar regard-\nless of the measure of ETS. The attributable risks\nranged from 0.4 to 0.6 among children exposed to\nETS at age 2 months to 2 years (Fig 1); that is, among\nchildren exposed, 40% to 60% of the cases of asthma,\nchronic bronchitis, and three or more episodes of\nwheezing were attributable to ETS exposure. For\ndiagnosed asthma among children 2 months through\ncases, whereas among children 2 months through 2\nTABLE 1.

The levels of exposure\nreported here are lower than those from the 1988\nChild Health Supplement (CHS) of the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS), in which 42% of\nchildren 5 years of age were currently living in a\nhousehold with a smoker.13 Part of the difference\nmay be attributable to the 1.2% decrease in smok-\nThere is no ideal method to quantify a child's\nexposure to ETS.

Previous\nshowed that among children 4 to 11 years of age,\nserum cotinine levels were higher in children with\nreported household exposure versus those with none\nreported.8\nReported smoking during pregnancy has been\nshown to be an excellent surrogate measure for cur-\nrent maternal smoking during at least the first 5\nyears of life. A telephone follow-up study performed\non participants from the 1985 NHIS reported that\n70% of women who quit smoking during any part of\ntheir pregnancy resumed smoking within 1 year of\ndelivery, with 93% of those resuming in the first 6\nucation Study in the United Kingdom, a birth cohort\nthat 90% of the women who smoked during preg-\nnancy were still smoking when their child reached 5\nyears of age.9\nThe number of smokers in the house is highly\ncorrelated with cotinine levels among children.20,21\nHowever, maternal smoking has been shown to be\nthe chief source of ETS exposure for children in the\nhome.17,21 Maternal smoking behavior influences the\nsmoking behavior of others. In a study of 433 infants\nat age 18 days, 75% of smoking mothers smoked near\ntheir infant and the amount smoked near the infant\nby the mother was correlated with the amount\nsmoked by others near the infant.22\nTABLE 3.

Among English school children 5 to\n7 years of age, only 8.7% of the children received\nchild care from a smoker, and in 66% of the cases, the\nparent was also a smoker.21 Among children with\nasthma 8 months through 13 years of age studied in\nan allergy clinic, reported ETS exposure in day care\nwas not an important determinant of the child's co-\ntinine level once household exposure was accounted\nfor.16 However in a nationwide study, day care has\nbeen shown to be an important factor contributing to\nthe number of respiratory infections experienced by\nIn addition to the potential misclassification with\nrespect to ETS exposure, a number of other issues\nmay influence the findings of this study. Self-report\nwas used to classify individuals in regards to their\nrespiratory problems. Misunderstanding of the ques-\ntions or use of unfamiliar terms may have resulted in\nnondifferential misclassification, which would tend\nto obscure any underlying association. Conversely,\nthe effect of smoking on ETS may be attributable to\nan overreporting of symptoms by parents who\nsmoke. Lebowitz and Burrows24 reported that the\nassociation between ETS and smoking exposure was\nno longer significant after controlling for the respi-\nratory symptoms of the parents. Other studies have\nreported that the association of ETS on respiratory\nsymptoms is not eliminated when taking into ac-\ncount parental respiratory symptoms.5,25 Finally, ei-\nther the low prevalence of some of the respiratory\neffects or a small true effect of ETS on a particular\nrespiratory outcome would reduced the power of\nthis study to detect any true difference between the\nexposed and unexposed groups.\nThe NHANES III data add to the growing litera-\nture that with the exception of asthma, the respira-\ntory effects of ETS are limited to the first few years of\nlife among children 5 years of age. The reported\nincidence of pneumonia and bronchitis was influ-\nenced by ETS only during the first year of life in a\nbirth cohort of 2200 children in England followed\nto age 5 years.5 Maternal smoking was associated\nwith an increased rate of medical consultations for\nbronchitispneumonia and maternal report of lower\nrespiratory symptoms only in the first 2 years of life\nafter adjustment for confounders in a birth cohort of\nyears of age in the Christchurch, New Zealand Child\nDevelopment Study.6 Although pneumonia was not\nstatistically significantly related to ETS in the\nNHANES III, even in the 0 to 2 years age group,\nthere appeared to be a tendency for pneumonia to\nincrease with increasing ETS exposure.\nSimilar results are seen from analyses of studies\nfocusing on active wheezing or wheezy bronchitis. In\na case\u00adcontrol study of children 2 months to 16 years\nof age presenting to an emergency room with wheez-\ning, ETS exposure (salivary cotinine 10 ng/mL)\nwas found to be associated only with wheezing in\nchildren 2 years of age.26 A case\u00adcontrol study of\nchildren 4 months to 4 years of age hospitalized for\nthe first time for wheezy bronchitis reported that\nparental smoking, especially maternal, was an im-\nportant factor in children 18 months of age.18 Data\nfrom the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey\nshowed that maternal smoking was significantly as-\nsociated with asthma and wheezing combined only\nin the 0 to 2 years age group but not in the 3 to 18\nOnly diagnosed asthma is associated with ETS\nexposure during the first 5 years of life. Interestingly,\nwheezing, the major symptom of asthma, was not\nassociated with ETS in the older group. Other studies\nhave reported previously that ETS exposure approx-\nimately doubles the prevalence of asthma in chil-\ndren.28,29 However, studies linking ETS to the inci-\ndence of asthma have found conflicting results. In\nArizona, ETS exposure was associated only with the\ndevelopment of asthma if the mother had 12 years\nof education, but not among the children of more\nhighly educated women.30 In Canada, only children\nwith atopic dermatitis exposed to ETS developed\nasthma, whereas others exposed to ETS did not de-\nvelop asthma31 and in New Zealand, ETS was not\nassociated with the development of asthma.32\nThe role of ETS exposure on asthma severity is\nunclear. A previous report from the 1981 CHS of the\nNHIS reported that ETS was associated with the\ngreater use of physician-prescribed asthma medica-\ntion in the last 2 weeks,29 whereas no association was\nseen in the NHANES III. The variation in defining\nmedication use may explain the differences. In the\n1981 CHS, a parent had to report the use of any\nmedication prescribed by a physician for asthma.\nThis form of the question does not eliminate the\nreporting of over-the-counter medications such as\ndecongestants or cough suppressants. The NHANES\nIII asked specifically about the name of the medica-\ntion; the parent could either show the bottle or report\nthe name verbally. In our analyses, we looked spe-\ncifically at -agonists and inhaled steroids, which are\nspecific therapies for asthma. It is also possible that a\nsufficient number of sample persons whose asthma\nwas aggravated by ETS avoided exposure to ETS and\nthus remove any association between ETS and sever-\nity in this cross-sectional study.\nStudies using other measures of severity have re-\nported conflicting results. Lower pulmonary func-\ntions and more reported acute exacerbations were\nfound with ETS exposure among patients with\nasthma attending an allergy clinic.16 Among low-\nincome urban children with asthma in New York\nCity (average age, 9 years), passive smoking was\nassociated with emergency room visits for asthma,\nbut not with hospitalizations or abnormalities in pul-\nmonary function.33 The effects of ETS on severity of\nasthma varied with age among patients evaluated at\na Canadian allergy clinic. In the youngest group (1 to\n6 years of age), no significant effect was found with\nexposure to smoke; in the middle age group (7 to 11\nyears of age), the children of smokers had an increase\nin their asthma score; and in the oldest group (12 to\n17 years of age), the asthma symptom score was\nincreased and the pulmonary functions were de-\ncreased in the children exposed to smoke.34 In a\nrecent report on 22 children (mean age, 5 years)\nfollowed for 1 month after being hospitalized for\nasthma, children living with a smoker reported 1.9\nfewer days of daytime symptoms than those not\nliving with a smoker (P  .05); however, no statisti-\ncally significant difference was found in the mean\nnumber of nighttime symptoms.35 Other studies re-\nporting changes in ETS exposure did not find an\nassociation with acute attacks of asthma.36,37\nA previous study used a national dataset to esti-\nmate the number of excess cases of disease from ETS.\nwheezing in children 18 years of age were reported\nfrom the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Sur-\nvey.27 This probably is an overestimate because ETS\nwas statistically significantly associated with ETS ex-\nposure only in children 0 to 2 years of age. However,\nthe nonsignificant association in the older age group\nwas included in their calculation.27 Our findings in-\namong children 2 months through 5 years old.\nAmong children 2 months through 2 years old, there\nepisodes of wheezing.\nSUMMARY\nETS exposure is common among children in the\nUnited States. The reported prevalence of asthma,\nwheezing, and chronic bronchitis was increased with\nETS exposures. No statistically significant increase in\nthe prevalence of URI, pneumonia, or cough was\nassociated with ETS exposure. The exposure has little\neffect on the respiratory health of children 3 years\nthrough 5 years of age with the exception of asthma.\nETS appears to increase the prevalence of asthma\nrather than the severity, as measured by medication\nuse. These findings reinforce the need to reduce the\nexposure of young children to ETS.\nREFERENCES\n1. DiFranza JR, Lew RA.
