    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe existing literature on the relationship between regulators and street vendors remain fragmented and limited to specific\ncountries and contexts. This article presents a narrative review of the existing literature on the relationship between regulators\nand street vendors, and through that creates a unified picture of an otherwise fragmented literature and knowledge base.\nThe concepts of negotiation, power, social network, and perception are used to analyze the various strategies street vendors\nhave used in gaining access to urban public spaces in different parts of the developing world. It is revealed that even though\ncity regulators have access to formal power, street vendors possess a variety of negotiating strategies that gives them access\nto both formal and informal power.\nKeywords\nstreet vendors, urban regulators, negotiation, social network, power\n2 SAGE Open\nCriteria for Inclusion and Exclusion of\nRelevant Documents\nFirst, articles on the World Wide Web, without a clearly spec-\nified author or organization responsible, were excluded\nbecause information from such documents could not be veri-\nfied and relied on.\nSecond, it was required that articles must primarily be a\njournal or newspaper article, a research report, or a confer-\nence proceeding reporting on primary data or primary\nresearch. Journal articles were included because journal arti-\ncles often use primary research data and were, as a result, a\ngood source of primary research on the tension between ven-\ndors and regulators in different parts of the developing world.\nThe other sources indicated, commonly known as gray litera-\nture, were included because Jones (2004) argues that as a\nresult of publication bias, a lot of information do not get pub-\nlished in journals. Consequently, including gray literature in\nthis review helped to eliminate the potential for such publica-\ntion bias.\nThird, it was required that the document should focus on\na developing country context, and must have as, either its\nprimary focus or part of its focus, a discussion of the rela-\ntionship between regulators and street vendors. The empha-\nsis on a developing country context was to ensure a good\nsynthesisofinformationondevelopingcountries.Developing\ncountries are urbanizing at a faster rate and street vending is\none of the most common phenomena associated with urban-\nization in developing countries. Thus, the similarity of con-\ntext (in terms of the vending activity, the use of public space\nand public space regulation) allows for literature from these\ncontexts to be analyzed in generating a more synthesized\nknowledge base for street vending, to be used by stakehold-\ners involved in street vending.\nThis review focused on literature between the year 2000\nprovides the best option of gaining a better insight into the\nrelationship between city authorities and vendors. An insight\nthat is more in tune with the present state of the relationship\nbetween city authorities and vendors in developing coun-\ntries. Thus, focusing on literature from the 21st century pro-\nvides an opportunity for using relevant, up to date information\non the negotiated relationship between vendors and city\nauthorities. Finally, this study's focus is not to present a his-\ntorical review of how this relationship has changed over time\nper se but rather to provide a narrative review of the nature\nand dynamics of this relationship as it exists presently. Hence\nthe emphasis on literature from the 21st century.\nTypes of Documents Included in\nReview\nOn the whole, three main categories of documents were used\nas part of this review. The first category was scientific peer\nreviewed journal articles. The second category included\nreports, working papers, and conference proceedings down-\nloaded from the database of relevant international organiza-\ntions such as Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing\nand Organizing (WIEGO) and the International Labor\nOrganization (ILO). The third and final category of docu-\nments included newspaper articles and media reports from\ndifferent parts of the world. The first two categories may be\nconsidered as scientific sources of information, while the last\nmay be classified simply as media.\nSearching for Documents: Search\nEngines, Keywords, Journals, and\nDatabases\nAs emphasized by Green, Johnson, and Adams (2006), it is\nimportant for authors of narrative review articles to clearly\nindicate the databases and keywords used in searching for\narticles. For this review, the document repositories of inter-\nnational organizations like WIEGO and ILO were searched\nto identify articles, working papers, conference proceedings,\nand technical reports. In addition, the first author subscribed\nto WIEGO's online news roundup, receiving as a result, a\ncompilation of global news coverage, reflecting print and\nelectronic media coverage on the informal economy, includ-\ning street vending. This proved to be an important source of\ninformation on the discourse about street vendors in different\nparts of the world.\nResearch articles included in the review were also identi-\nfied from journals such as Environment and Urbanization,\nGeoforum, Urban Studies, Journal of Development Studies,\nJournal of Modern African Studies, Qualitative Sociology,\nand Economic and Political Weekly. Some keywords and\nphrases that were used for the article search were as follows:\nstreet vending; trading on the streets; street traders; regulat-\ning street vending; street vendors and urban regulators; pri-\nvate and public space; and ownership of public space.\nAnalysis of Documents\nEach article was read twice. The first reading was to famil-\niarize researchers with the content of the article or publica-\ntion. A second more detailed reading was conducted to\nidentify and tag the strategies that vendors use to negotiate\nfor space. Once identified, the individual strategies were\nsummarized by a descriptive word or phrase, with the word\nor phrase serving as codes for further analysis. For instance,\nphrases like \"court action,\" \"bargaining with votes,\" \"pay-\nment of tokens,\" and \"carrying few goods\" were some of the\ncodes used to summarize the strategies used by vendors to\nnegotiate for space. Subsequently, the codes were examined,\nand similar codes put together to form a theme. Thus, within\none theme could be found strategies from different studies.\nFor instance, \"court action\" and \"bargaining\" with votes\nwere put together under the theme \"macrolevel negotiating\nstrategies,\" while \"carrying few goods\" and \"payment of\nForkuor et al. 3\ntokens\" came under the theme \"microlevel negotiating strat-\negies.\" The main findings were subsequently organized and\nexplored around the main identified themes.\nSummary of Data Set\nIn sum, this review identified 31 relevant articles and reports\nfrom three different regions of the world: Africa, Asia, and\nSouth America. Eighteen of these were journal articles, six\nwere newspaper and media reports, and seven were policy\nbriefs, working papers or research reports. Refer to Table 1\nfor brief descriptions of articles and reports used for this\nreview.\nResults\nIn presenting the findings, a review of how street vendors\nhave been portrayed and perceived, and the implications of\nthese perceptions for the livelihoods of street vendors are\nfirst presented. This is followed by a review of the key strate-\ngies street vendors have used in negotiating for space in\nurban areas. The various ways in which power, both formal\nand informal, manifests itself in this negotiated setting will\nbe explored.\nPerceptions About Street Vendors\nDifferent stakeholders in different parts of the developing\nworld have perceived street vendors in different ways.\nPredominantly, however, these perceptions have been posi-\ntive or negative, focusing mostly on vendors' occupation of\npublic space and the effects such occupation has on urban\nresidents and urban life (Donovan, 2008). This section dis-\ncusses how street vendors have been perceived mostly not\nonly by urban authorities but also by urban residents and\nother urban actors in relation to their use of urban space. It is\nrevealed that even though negative perception of vendors\nexists, this perception is not limited to the activity of vending\nitself but mostly on the location of vending. In line with this,\nthis section reveals how perception can be fluid, changing\nfrom favorable to nonfavorable during different times of the\nday and different seasons.\nNegative Perception of Vending\nFirst, city authorities and regulators have often perceived and\nportrayed street vending as negatively affecting the attrac-\ntiveness and beauty of their cities. In African cities like\nKumasi in Ghana, for instance, street vendors are perceived\nby city authorities as sources of congestion and poor envi-\nronmental sanitation, and their structures are seen as destroy-\ning \"the aesthetic quality of the urban settlements\"\nSimilarly, in SouthernAmerican andAsian cities like Mexico\ncity in Mexico, Santiago in Chile, and Mumbai in India,\nstreet vendors are often portrayed as offensive and illegiti-\nmate invaders, who inhibit the ability of cities to modernize\ndors are perceived as a sign of chaos and disorder; and a\nfailure of metropolitan authorities to instill order within the\nexplains that in Mumbai India, \"street vendors are seen as\noffensive, inconvenient, and illegitimate . . . a symbol of\nmetropolitan space gone out of control\" (p. 94). The media\nplays a crucial role in shaping the negative perceptions of the\npublic regarding street vendors (Rajagopal, 2001).\nPublications and news items sometimes portray a negative\nimage of street vendors. A search of the print media in Ghana\non articles about street vendors reveals how the phenomenon\nof street vending is discussed in the public arena, and the\nimage of street vendors that emerges out of this discourse.\nJournalists use terms such as swarm, take over, invade,\nflooded to describe vendors' occupation of public spaces,\nsuggesting the undesirability of their occupation of public\nspaces: those \"daredevil hawkers\" as one journalist simply\nputs it in the Ghanaian Times newspaper (Anyimah-Ackah,\non street vendors in Belo Horizonte in Brazil, Carrieri and\nMurta (2011) also cite instances where newspapers argue in\nfavor of city authorities and present a negative image of\nstreet vendors to readers and the public. The authors indicate\nhow words such as riots, fear, criminality, violence, and\norganized crime have been used to represent vendors. As a\nresult of these negative perceptions, street vending in general\nhas become a phenomenon associated with poor level of city\nor urban development and modernization (Anjaria, 2006).\nThus, \"by working on the streets, they are engaged in an\nactivity that contradicts the supposed universal ideals of the\nstreet vendors are perceived as elements who do not belong\nas part of the urban and modern landscape, they are consid-\nered as \"out of place\" urban elements (Yatmo, 2009).\nIn addition to its negative effects on the image of cities,\nstreet vendors have often been perceived as creating a safe\nhaven, through their congestion of streets, for crime to flour-\nish. They are considered as untrustworthy people who, in\ncollaboration with thieves and drug dealers deceive unsus-\npecting members of the public and pedestrians (Austin,\n1994). Thus, for some shop owners in Bogota Colombia,\nstreet traders bring only disorder, filth, and the risk of crime\nand theft (Donovan, 2008). By their congestion of city\nstreets, they are perceived as making it possible for thieves to\nhide and move among them unnoticed, a situation that\nadversely affects the activities of more established and for-\nmal shop owners (Donovan, 2008). Finally, street vendors\nare also perceived as creating unfair competition for more\nestablished shop owners, subsequently reducing the profits\nof shop owners by offering pirated and counterfeit goods and\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

(continued)\nForkuor et al. 7\ncommodities for sale at very low prices (Mitullah, 2003).\nOwners of shops in Mumbai, India, and in Bogota, Colombia,\nhave been vocal in this regard. These shop owners have\nexpressed concerns that street traders provide unhealthy\ncompetition and drain the income of more established, regis-\ntered and taxpaying shop owners (Donovan, 2008; Rajagopal,\nshop owners in Cusco, Peru, who complain about their loss\nof autonomy over the sale of products and the competition\nthat vendors bring with them, with its associated declines in\nsales and earnings.\nPositive and Fluid Perceptions\nThese negative perceptions notwithstanding, Yatmo (2009)\nexplains, based on a research in Jakarta, Indonesia, that the\nnegative perception of street vendors as out of place ele-\nments in the urban landscape is not absolute but rather, a\nfluid phenomenon, changing with time of day. Yatmo (2009)\nargues by emphasizing that\nthe evaluation of street vendors as out of place elements change\nfrom day-time to night-time . . . suggesting that the generalisation\nof judgement that the street vendors are out of place in any\nlocations at any time may not be entirely correct. (p. 473)\nYatmo (2009) explains that at night-time, respondents per-\nceived street vendors as more organized with cleaner envi-\nronments, in contrast with their perceptions of vendors\nduring the days. This fluidity in the perception of vendors\ndescribes the attitude of some city authorities toward the\nphenomenon of street vending. There is evidence to suggest\nthat in some countries, urban authorities' perceptions of ven-\ndors and their attitude to street vending in general change\nduring different economic periods (Donovan, 2008). In\nBangkok and Thailand, for instance, the financial and eco-\nnomic recession of 1997 compelled people into the Street\nFood (SF) trade as a source of income and employment\n(Chung, Ritoper, & Takemoto, 2010). The central and munic-\nipal governments of Thailand and Bangkok, respectively,\nwent to the extent of encouraging citizens to take up SF\nvending as an alternate source of income during this finan-\nDonovan, 2008) also reports that during economic difficul-\nties in the 1990s, the Mayor of Kuala Lumpur reduced regu-\nlations on vendor licenses and set aside more areas for street\nvending to take place. This fluidity in perceptions empha-\nsizes the fact that vending is only problematic during specific\nperiods and in particular locations.\nFurthermore, the argument has been made, for instance, that\nby their mere presence, street vendors serve and act as deterrent\nof various forms of crimes on city streets (Anjaria, 2006). In\nMumbai, street vendors have on occasion protected women\nagainst sexual harassment (Anjaria, 2006). Consequently, ven-\ndors and street traders are perceived as providing important\nsecurity for more established shop owners and the general pub-\nlic as a whole, maintaining a watchful eye over events, and\nshowing up to assist in case of accidents and emergencies on\nthe streets (Anjaria, 2006). Where shop owners hold such per-\nceptions of street vendors, there evolves a special kind of rela-\ntionship built on trust between the vendors and the shop owners\n(Anjaria, 2006). This perception of street vendors as capable of\npreventing crime has also been evident in Durban, South\nAfrica, where street vendors have worked hand-in-hand with\nthe police in preventing crime on the streets (Skinner, 2008).\nHere, street vendors have been trained by the police to monitor\ntheir streets and to inform the police when they feel something\nis not right (Skinner, 2008). Through such collaborative efforts,\nSkinner (2008b) reports that there has been a significant reduc-\ntion in the incidence of crime in the inner city areas of Durban.\nWhat is evident is that, despite the fact that street vendors are\nsometimes accused of promoting crime, there are instances\nwhere street vendors have worked to eliminate the same forms\nof crime they are accused of. There are other instances where\nmore established shop owners perceive street vendors not as\noffering unfair competition but rather as an avenue for business\ndevelopment. In Mexico City in Mexico, for instance, Crossa\n(2009) reports that a special alliance exists between street ven-\ndors and shop owners, where street vendors sometimes \"sell\nproducts on the street on behalf of shop owners\" (p. 55).\nHowever, like the above, the emphasis have been predomi-\nnantly on the negative effects that street vending have for for-\nmal businesses, with very little attention paid to the benefits\nand opportunities that street vending present for formal\nbusinesses.\nEvidently, wherever city authorities and other members of\nthe public perceive street vendors positively, the larger urban\ncommunity benefit through the collaborative efforts and the\npositive effects that result. Interestingly, these positive effects\nseem to receive very little attention from city and urban\nauthorities in general. On the contrary, the argument has over-\nwhelmingly been on the negative effects street vendors have\non cities and the \"illegality\" of the street vending activity. It\ncould be argued, however, that the problem is often not with\nthe activity of vending itself but mostly the location that\nvending takes place. Thus, the negative perception often\nrelate to the space/site for vending and that vending in itself is\nalso perceived positively as an important economic activity\nproviding important benefits for urban residents.\nCity Authorities and Their Response to\nStreet Vending\nIn line with the perceptions of a modern and global city, evic-\ntion and relocation campaigns are undertaken by city author-\nities to \"clean up\" the city and make it more \"attractive\"\nvendors are perceived as a nuisance, a symbol of chaos and\ndisorder, eviction is often intense, involving the use of\n8 SAGE Open\nbulldozers, and justified as necessary to restore \"order\" and\n\"sanity\" back to city life (Rajagopal, 2001). Examples of\nsuch evictions and relocations have been undertaken in India,\nVietnam, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, and in other\ndeveloping countries in Africa (Anjaria, 2006; Donovan,\nThese evictions and relocations can be conceived as a\ndemonstration of the power of cities and urban areas over\nresidents and street vendors (Skinner, 2008a). This is\nbecause, within a social negotiated setting, those who are in\nneed of something are usually constrained by the actions of\nthose who can satisfy their needs (Fine, 1984). Similarly,\nstreet vendors, working with limited or no infrastructural\nfacilities and limited access to competitive space for busi-\nness are often constrained by the conditions laid down by\ncity authorities and regulators who control vital public space.\nThus, city regulators have often used the prevailing negative\nperception about street vendors as a negotiating tool to gain\nmore power, which enhances their claim over crucial public\nspace. Similar to the above, Mitullah (2006) has reasoned\nthat the eviction of street vendors from busy city centers\nhave power implications because the vacation of the streets\nby street vendors makes these profitable streets and city cen-\nters available to large scale and powerful formal businesses\nat the expense of small scale vendors. The eviction of ven-\ndors by force, the destruction of perceived illegal vending\nstands, and the confiscation and sometimes destruction of\ngoods demonstrate the extent, nature, and effects of the\npower held by city regulators (Rajagopal, 2001).\nNegotiating for Space: Street Vendors\nand City Authorities\nStreet vendors, despite the above information, are not \"power-\nless\" in the face of eviction and relocation. As participants\nactively reinterpreting and renegotiating their realities, street\nvendors have a variety of strategies available to them, a sign of\ntheir own power, in the face of eviction and relocation. This\nsection discusses some of the strategies that street vendors, as\nindividuals and as organized groups, have used in securing\naccess to important locations for vending in urban areas of\ndeveloping countries. Using examples from different places,\nthe section demonstrates how the use of these strategies gives\nsome form of power to street vendors in their relationship with\ncity authorities. These negotiating strategies can be classified\nunder two main categories: negotiations that take place at the\nmacrolevel (between organized groups of vendors and state\nauthorities), and negotiations that take place at the microlevel\n(between individual street vendors and city regulators).\nNegotiating at the Macrolevel\nFor some street traders and vendors, the use of public space\nis closely linked with the right to survive and to earn a liveli-\nhood, a right that must be fought for and protected. Rajagopal\n(2001) reports that in negotiating for a space for business,\nsome street vendors in Mumbai, India have gone as far as\nfight for this right in the law courts, taking on city authorities\nand subsequently gaining the right to vend within specific\ncity spaces (Rajagopal, 2001). This strategy is also common\namong street vendors in other Indian cities like Delhi\nHawkers have also learned to use the courts instrumentally.\nSome hawkers were thus appealing for injunctions against\ndemolitions or eviction in different courts under different names.\nWhen a hawker lost a case in the city civil court, he or she would\nmove to the high court without revealing the details of the earlier\ncase. Sometimes, a wife or a brother would move to another\ncourtoverthesamehawkingspot.Thehearingsandadjournments\ntranslated into valuable business time for the hawker. (p. 107)\nThis strategy of negotiating for space has also been\nreported among street vendors in Bogota city in Colombia,\nwhere vendors have often responded to threats of eviction\nwith a legal action arguing that eviction will go contrary to\ntheir right to work and earn a living (Donovan, 2008). What\nhappens then is that vendors begin to make use of the same\ninstitutions that legitimizes the power of regulators, they\nhave learnt to use the same tools that the state uses against\nthem to fight back and to gain power (Rajagopal, 2001).\nIn addition to using the courts as a negotiating tool and\nsource of power, other vendors as a group, have used their\nvotes as a bargaining power in negotiating with city authori-\nties. This is especially significant where the vendor popula-\ntion is large, as it is in Mexico city (Donovan, 2008). In this\ninstance, street vendors vote into power their own nominated\nindividuals who in turn allow them to vend on city streets\n(Donovan, 2008). In other instances, vendors \" . . . secured\nlicenses in exchange for political support during city elec-\ntions . . .\" (Donovan, 2008, p. 35). Voting for people into city\ncouncils and other positions has also been revealed as a com-\nmon strategy by street traders in the northern city of Baguio\nin the Philippines (Milgram, 2011). The votes of street ven-\ndors are important as a negotiating tool, to the extent that it\ncan change policies, albeit temporarily. Thus, Milgram\n(2011) writes regarding vendors in the Philippines that \"since\nmunicipal elections were scheduled for May 2010, the then\ncurrent city counsellors hesitated to introduce new bye laws\nthat might arouse the displeasure of their constituents,\nincluding vendors, and thus threaten their chances of re-elec-\ntions\" (p. 284). In Malawi in Africa, by voting for \"council-\nlors\" of local assemblies, street vendors were assured of a\nprotective voice within local authorities as these councilors\nacknowledged the support of the vendors in bringing them\ninto office (Kayuni & Tambulasi, 2009). Kayuni and\nTambulasi (2009) write the following of the councilors in\nMalawi: \"most councillors knew that they were brought into\noffice through mostly the support of the vendors themselves.\nIn this regard, the vendors had, to some extent, an authorita-\ntive voice through the councillors\" (p. 88). Not only do these\nForkuor et al. 9\nplaced officials lobby city authorities on behalf of street trad-\ners in securing access to public spaces for business, they also\nserve as crucial sources of information about the actions and\ninactions of city authorities regarding impending evictions\nand raids through the city center (Milgram, 2011). Because\nknowing when to run or leave a place of business is a crucial\npart of the negotiation for and use of space among street trad-\ners and vendors, well-placed sources in positions of authority\nwithin urban areas help street traders to effectively negotiate\nfor and use space to enhance their livelihoods (Milgram,\n\"We actively sought friends in City Hall who agreed to tell us\nwhen a raid is scheduled if they hear about it in advance\" (p.\n282). In effect, one major strategy that street vendors have\nused in getting access to and using city spaces is to either use\ntheir votes as a bargaining power or to vote for their own into\npublic offices who in turn will lobby for the street vendors.\nOnce again, vendors are demonstrated as using what they\nhave, their vote, to negotiate and gain power (Crossa, 2009).\nOne other macro strategy that street vendors have used to\nnegotiate for space in urban areas is through public demon-\nstrations. These demonstrations may take the form of public\nrallies, where vendors sometimes march on city authorities\nand hand over demands and grievances, an approach which\nhas been used effectively by vendors in Durban, South\nAfrica, in preventing eviction (Skinner, 2008b) as well as in\nCaloocan in Manila, the Philippines (Recio & Gomez, 2013).\nSometimes these public demonstrations take violent forms,\nas has been reported in Mexico City in Mexico (Crossa,\nwhere hundreds of street vendors came together in Mexico\nCity, sprayed the police with tear gas, and hit them with\nsticks when the police attempted to evict them from operat-\ning in the city center. Here, street vendors gain power through\nnumbers and use some of the same strategies that city author-\nities have used against them in resisting eviction and main-\ntaining the use of city spaces.\nAnother form of public demonstration, as revealed by\nof letter writing campaigns organized by members of street\nvendor associations aimed at city authorities, demonstrating\nagainst an impending eviction and proving, through their let-\nters, why they should be allowed to operate under certain\noccasions. Recio and Gomez (2013) report how street ven-\ndors in Caloocan, Metro Manila, in the Philippines engage\ncity regulators and authorities in discussions with an aim of\nbringing their grievances before such authority figures.\nAlternatively, street vendors in Dakar, Senegal, have used\nopen forums, where vendor associations meet with govern-\nment officials to discuss their concerns (Bass, 2000).\nInternational organizations and nongovernmental organi-\nzations (NGOs) also play an important role in macro negotia-\ntion activities of informal sector workers in general and street\nvendors specifically. Organizations such as the Street Net\nInternational, International Domestic Workers Network,\nInternational Transport Worker's Federation, WIEGO, Latin\nAmerican Waste Picker Network (Red Lacre), Global\nAlliance of Waste Pickers, and Home Net South Asia assist\ninformal sector workers by building a global network and\ninvolving in transnational advocacy to promote the rights\nand well-being of informal sector workers including street\nCurrently, The Street Net International and WIEGO are\namong some of the globally recognized organizations con-\ncerned about the rights of informal workers in general and\nstreet vendors specifically (Bonner, 2009; Bonner & Carr\u00e9,\nship-based organization (such as trade unions, cooperatives,\nor associations), directly organizes street vendors, market\nvendors, and/or hawkers to negotiate with city authorities\nand to improve the work conditions of informal sector street\nThey organize bargaining forums with city officials, helping\nto promote the exchange of information and ideas on critical\nissues facing street vendors, market vendors, and hawkers. In\naddition, they help enlighten street workers and other infor-\nmal sector workers on how to exercise their rights against\n2014). In attempt to fight for their rights, informal workers\nform association and then liaise with these international\norganizations/NGOs to help them negotiate with government\nofficials to effect changes in policies.\nThrough these macro strategies, street vendors in differ-\nent parts of the developing world have sought to stake a\nclaim for their use of public space and to negotiate against\neviction and relocation campaigns. It is important to note\nthough that even though the macro strategies discussed\nabove have been demonstrated to be generally effective for\nall street vendors and to represent their power, there remain\nconsiderable within-group differences in terms of its benefits\nfor different categories (age, sex, and class) of vendors.\nThus, individual vendors may benefit differently from these\nstrategies depending on their sex, age, and social class. Bass\n(2000) in a research of the negotiating strategies of street\nvendors in Senegal draws attention to how the above sociode-\nmographic characteristics define the benefits that particular\ngroups of vendors gain. Using evidence from her research,\nBass (2000) makes a strong argument for how gender, age,\nand class determines the negotiating power of different\ngroups. Bass (2000) finds, for instance, that because female\nstreet vendors had less social authority to assert themselves,\nthey were less able to negotiate for their interests, and often\nmade their interests secondary to that of their male counter-\nparts in negotiating with city officials. The concerns specific\nto female vendors who often sell different products from the\nmales and thus often have some challenges specific to their\nsituation are often left unaddressed during macrolevel nego-\ntiations with state officials (Bass, 2000). In addition to sex,\nBass (2000) finds further differentiation based on age and\nclass where the needs of older and more established vendors,\nfor instance, get more attention and promoted in the negotia-\ntion process than younger and less established vendors. By\nso doing, Bass (2000) not only emphasizes the negotiating\npower of vendors as a group but further draws attention to\nthe power differentials and differences in the ability to nego-\ntiate that may emerge among vendors.\nNegotiating at the Microlevel\nAt a more microlevel, street vendors have used a variety of\napproaches to negotiate for and have access to vend within\ncity spaces and to avoid eviction.\nNetworking and communication among colleague vendors\nis one of the negotiating strategies that street vendors have\nused. This is where vendors communicate with each other and\nwarn each other of impending threats from city authorities.\nFor instance, Crossa (2009), in writing about the resistance\nstrategies of street vendors in Mexico city's city center indi-\ncates that some street vendors are: \"paid to monitor the streets,\nwatch for the police, and to warn other vendors of police activ-\nities through the use of walkie talkies\" (p. 56). Alternatively,\nCrossa (2009) reports that on a day to day basis, vendors warn\neach other by \"whistling to each other to sound the alert about\npolice activities or other impending threats\" (p. 56). Another\nform of networking among vendors in using city spaces is\nwhere vendors send messages alerting each other of the pres-\nence or otherwise of city authorities. Recio and Gomez (2013)\nreport of what they term as \"Quick Response Teams\" (QRTs)\nin Caloocan, Metro Manila, where these QRTs act as a form of\nearly warning system, using text messages to warn colleague\nvendors of imminent or ongoing eviction operations (Recio &\nvendors in Peru has indicated that street vendors, running from\neviction and a raid from one place may warn other vendors at\nother places of the impending threats. This is a more crude\nform of the early warning system using mobile phones and\nwalkie talkies. Similar strategies have been reported among\nstreet vendors in Brazil as well (Carrieri & Murta, 2011). What\nhas been demonstrated is that street vendors make use of the\nnetwork of relations among each other as a form of security\nfor each other. This form of security has been termed by Steel\n(2012) as a \"social security network.\" This security network of\nrelations among vendors is important to the well-being of\nstreet vendors and to their continued survival on the streets.\nCrossa (2009) demonstrates the importance of a social secu-\nrity network through the following statement from one street\nvendor:\n. . . here I feel at home, like with my family. I mean that among\nus we really help each other. There is more communication here\namong us than in my own house where I just eat and sleep. This\nis like one big family . . . (p. 52)\nThe statement above is a powerful indication of the impor-\ntance of the network of relations and ties that exist among\nstreet vendors. On the streets, therefore, social networks\nbecome key to the survival and continued use of space for\nstreet vendors. In relation to this, Milgram (2011) reasons that\nby relying on social networks to survive and use city spaces,\nstreet vendors turn absolute space into relational space.\nInterestingly, these networks of relations go beyond fel-\nlow street vendors to include more formal shop owners who,\nin different areas, have protected street vendors from city\nfor instance, Crossa (2009) writes, \"Shop owners offered ref-\nuge to their street vending allies when the police or authori-\nties arrived. In return, street vendors agreed to sell products\non the streets on behalf of shop owners\" (p. 55). Social net-\nworks, thus, become important sources of power for street\nvendors in negotiations.\nUnder continuous hostile regulatory circumstances\nthough, street vendors in different parts of the world have\nalso had to modify their mode of operation to sustain their\neconomic ventures. One of the most common of these strat-\negies is for otherwise stationary vendors to become more\nmobile and to carry few goods with them to sell at any point\nin time, a strategy that enhances an easy get away in case\ncity authorities approach, and ensures minimal losses in\ncase of confiscation of goods. In places like Baguio City in\nthe Philippines, Milgram (2011) explains that vendors\nspread a few of their goods on blankets by the streets or on\npavements. This way, vendors argue that \"if we are pursued\nby the police, we can easily gather the four corners of our\nblankets and run to prevent our produce from being confis-\nMurta (2011) writes of street vendors in Brazil that, as a\nresult of frequent inspections, vendors carried with them \"a\nminimal number of supplies to allow for a fast escape as\nsoon as inspectors were spotted to diminish possible losses\"\n(p. 221). This strategy has also been reported among street\nvendors in Ghana, Mexico, and Peru (Anyimah-Ackah,\nGhana, for instance, because there are usually high pedes-\ntrian traffic at the city center in Accra, vendors try to blend\nin by carrying a few wares in their hands, just as if they were\npedestrians, but then announce to potential customers in a\nbid to sell their items (Anyimah-Ackah, 2007). In Peru,\nSteel (2012) also reports that female street vendors hide\ntheir wares in their shopping bags and blend in with the\nshoppers, creating the impression that they themselves were\nshopping: \"women selling painted gourds hid them in their\nshopping bags to give the impression that they were shop-\nping rather than vending\" (p. 1017). By being increasingly\nmobile and constantly moving, vendors avoid drawing too\nmuch attention to themselves and minimize the potential\nlosses in case city authorities arrest them. Elsewhere, some\nvendors have completely changed trades and vended low-\nvalue items, which offers less losses in case of confiscation\nThese strategies demonstrate vendors'innovativeness and\ntheir abilities to adapt to the changing demands of their job.\nSimilar to more formal corporate entities who are continu-\nously finding innovative ways to become competitive, ven-\ndors also modify their modes of operation in response to the\nchallenges posed by city authorities to have continuous\naccess to important urban spaces for business. What has been\nmade evident from the preceding is how street vendors rely\non individual agency as a way of sustaining their use of\nurban public spaces. In a way, this is also a manifestation of\ntheir personal form of power. Steel (2012) terms these indi-\nvidual agency strategies as \"strategies of resilience\" mani-\nfested by vendors in negotiating and using urban spaces.\nAnother important strategy that street vendors have used\nin negotiating for and maintaining a space for business is to\nanticipate the actions and inactions of regulators. Street ven-\ndors in Baguio city in the northern Philippines, for instance,\nmay sell from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. in the morning, 12 p.m. to 1\np.m. in the afternoon, and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the evening\nreflecting the times before the start of day, during lunch\nbreak, and close of day when regulators are likely not to be\nstreet vendors in Brazil, Belo Horizonte, have learnt to oper-\nate very early in the morning when regulators have not begun\nwork. Carrieri and Murta (2011) reveal that, \"One of the\ninterviewees said that he works informally close to the bus\nstation in the morning; according to him, the inspectors are\nnot yet on the streets at that time\" (p. 223). Street vendors in\nPeru also adopt this strategy. By vending during the lunch-\ntime of regulators or during the evenings where control from\nthe state is minimal because regulators have closed from\nwork, \"Other vendors told me that they try to sell their goods\nwhile the municipal agents are eating lunch or dinner, or only\nin the evenings when there is less control\" (Steel, 2012, p.\nstrategies among street vendors in Vietnam.\nWhat this means is that the knowledge of vendors regard-\ning the working culture of the context within which they\nwork serves as an important negotiating tool in negotiating\nformal regulatory requirements.\nSometimes, space for business is negotiated for sustained\nuse through the payment of daily tokens, in money or in kind,\nto city authorities and their field officials (Anjaria, 2006;\nmost common negotiating strategies for street vendors in dif-\nferent parts of the world. In Mumbai, India, for instance,\nstreet vendors sometimes have had to pay these tokens more\nthan once a day to operate in busy public spaces: \"in busy\ncity areas, hawkers may be threatened 3 to 4 times a day by\ncity workers, paying up to 4500 rupees a month to keep them\nthough that regulators and city authorities do not always\ndemand tokens. On the contrary, as vendors in Baguio city in\nthe northern Philippines have demonstrated, it is quite com-\nmon for these tokens to be offered voluntarily in the form of\nfood products like fruits and cakes for city officials and\ninspectors to enhance a vendor's stake or claim to a particu-\nlar space of business. In Malawi, Kayuni and Tambulasi\nSeveral vendors explained that the police, who are supposed to\nensure that no one is plying their trade along the streets, are\nsometimes very corrupt. The police are given K500.00 or more\nand they allow these illegal street vendors to continue selling\ntheir items discreetly. (p. 92)\nMilgram (2011) also cites one vendor in the Philippines\nas saying, \"some officers even overlook our minor selling\ninfractions when we offer them sweet cooked rice cakes or\nfruit to take home to their families\" (p. 279). This practice\nis also common among vendors in other African countries\n(Mitullah, 2006), including Rwanda (Nzohabonimana,\nThrough the offering of these gifts and the payment of\ntokens/bribes, relationships are negotiated and estab-\nlished, and infringement of rules and regulations, includ-\ning the use of public spaces, is subsequently punished or\noverlooked depending also on the quality of the relation-\nship (Milgram, 2011). Thus, vendors use the gifts they\ngive to regulators as a negotiating tool, a source of power\nthat allows them to influence the decision making of city\nregulators.\nSimilar to Bass's revelation regarding the differences in\nbenefits that macro negotiating strategies have for different\ngroups based on sociodemographic characteristics, Steel\n(2012) notices important differences among vendors in their\nabilities to negotiate with urban officials and rework the sys-\ntem. Steel (2012) finds that more established vendors had\nmore resources and abilities to negotiate, compared with new\nvendors:\nEstablished vendors have an extra repertoire of strategies with\nwhich to confront insecurity and vulnerability. They have a\ncertain authority and status in the streets because they have\nlearned the secrets of street vending. They are entitled to the best\nvending locations (i.e., those that are under a relatively low level\nof surveillance by the municipality) and they have social\ncontacts in and off the street to escape from the hands of the\npose important questions about the benefits of these negoti-\nating strategies for different groups of street vendors. To\nwhat extent do factors such as gender, age, geographical\nlocation, time of vending, and time of year affect the negoti-\nating strategies of vendors? These important questions need\nto be further explored through primary research studies, in\nthe continuous attempt to enhance the street vending sector\nas a viable and legitimate source of employment and income\nfor urban residents in developing countries.\nConclusion\nThis article contributes by providing a coherent narrative and\na holistic picture of an otherwise fragmented literature base\non the dynamic relationship between street vendors and city\nregulators. Perception has been demonstrated as a much more\nfluid concept, changing with time and situation. Furthermore,\npower emerges and exists in interaction, through informal\nnegotiations and strategies, through network of relations, and\nthrough individual agency and innovative strategies. Power is\ndemonstrated here not only as a tool of oppression and\ndestruction but, with regard to vendors, as a tool for resistance\nand resilience. Unlike other research studies, street vendors\nhave been demonstrated as an organized political force who,\nthrough various strategies and approaches, resist or avoid the\npower of city authorities and continue to use public spaces.\nThese strategies have been demonstrated as reflecting the\npolitical power of street vendors in developing countries.\nBecause street vendors and regulators possess and use power\ndifferently, this research emphasizes the need for these two\nkey stakeholders to collaborate and work together in enhanc-\ning the well-being of vendors and cities in general. We recom-\nmend that future researchers further investigate in detail how\nnegotiations and strategies vary among different groups of\nvendors vending in different public spaces. To what extent do\nfactors such as geographical location, time of vending (day-\ntime or night-time), time of year, gender, and age affect and\nmodify the negotiating strategies of vendors? These questions\nmust be explored through research to further deepen our\nunderstanding of the negotiated setting of the street in devel-\noping countries.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: from\nthe Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), through\nthe Ghana Street Foods Project, Knust, Kumasi.\nReferences\nAnjaria, S.

By their presence and activities, however,\nstreet vendors in different parts of the developing world have\nbeen in confrontation with city authorities or regulators over\nspace for business, conditions of work, sanitation, and licens-\ngroups (street vendors and regulators) have interests that\noften contradict or compete (Austin, 1994).\nAs a result of the competing interests between street ven-\ndors and regulators, street vending has come to depend largely\non a constant negotiation among vendors, buyers, and regula-\nNegotiations may be for public space, for economic opportu-\nnity, and for power, and may involve the general public, shop\nowners, and urban regulators (Asiedu & Agyei-Mensah,\n2008). Among street vendors, regulators, pedestrians, and the\ngeneral public, negotiations may occur regarding what can be\nconsidered an acceptable and unacceptable use of space, as\nwell as what can be considered rights of the vendor to operate\nand earn a living from public spaces against the rights of the\nstate to maintain public spaces (Drummond, 2000). These\nnegotiations for public space and their outcome have impor-\ntant implications for the well-being of street vendors, because\nhaving a good space for vending is one of a variety of signifi-\ncant factors that affect the well-being of street vendors (Cohen,\nEven though different authors have documented the nego-\ntiation strategies of vendors in specific countries, this review\npresents a synthesized, holistic, and coherent insight by\nbringing together the various strategies that vendors have\nused in urban areas of developing countries and analyzing\nthem through the lens of relevant theoretical concepts of\npower, social networks, and social perception.\nLiterature Search and Analysis\nThis section provides a description of the criteria used in\nselecting relevant articles included in this review.
