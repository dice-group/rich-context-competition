For example, high neuroticism and low\nconscientiousness are each associated with earlier mortal-\nity (Friedman et al., 1993; Wilson, Mendes de Leon, Bienas,\nEvans, & Bennett, 2004). However, a small number of re-\ncent studies demonstrated that not only does personality\nlevel predict key health outcomes but so does personality\nchange (Roberts & Mroczek, 2008). Prior studies high-\nlight the importance of considering both trait level and\nchange to predict outcomes as diverse as substance abuse\n(Hampson, Tildesley, Andrews, Luckyx, & Mroczek,\n& Spiro, 2007). No study, however, has used a large na-\ntional sample with a wide age range to examine whether\nboth personality level and change predict health outcomes.\nIn the present study, we extend the findings of these prior\ninvestigations using the Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) sur-\nvey, a large national longitudinal sample of adult Ameri-\ncans to determine whether personality trait level and\nchange independently predict three distinct self-reported\nhealth outcomes.\nBackground\nPersonality Trait Level and Physical Health\nA burgeoning literature documents a link between per-\nsonality trait level and health (Hampson & Friedman, 2008;\nSmith, 2006), and this association is strongest for conscien-\ntiousness and neuroticism. For instance, there is evidence\nthat low conscientiousness (e.g., persons who tend to be dis-\norganized, irresponsible, and undisciplined) is related to\nnegative health behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking, poor\ndiet, and lack of exercise; Friedman et al., 1993; Hampson,\nGoldberg, Vogt, & Dubanoski, 2007; Roberts, Kuncel,\nShiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007) and negative health out-\ncomes (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, urinary problems,\nstroke, a variety of mental illnesses, and earlier mortality;\nBogg & Roberts, 2004). Neuroticism, or negative emotion-\nality, also has clear associations with both health behaviors\nand health outcomes. Neuroticism is related to the exposure\npeople have to stressors but also in their reaction (or over-\nreaction) to stress (Bolger & Schilling, 1991; Kling, Ryff,\nsuch reaction is smoking, which accounts for about 25% of\nPersonality Trait Level and Change as Predictors of\nHealth Outcomes: Findings From a National Study of\nAmericans (MIDUS)\nNicholas A.

Personality traits predict numerous health outcomes, but previous studies have rarely used personality\nchange to predict health.\nMethods. The current investigation utilized a large national sample of 3,990 participants from the Midlife in the U.S.\nstudy (MIDUS) to examine if both personality trait level and personality change longitudinally predict 3 different health\noutcomes (i.e., self-rated physical health, self-reported blood pressure, and number of days limited at work or home due\nto physical health reasons) over a 10-year span.\nResults. Each of the Big Five traits, except openness, predicted self-rated health. Change in agreeableness, conscien-\ntiousness, and extraversion also predicted self-rated health. Trait levels of conscientiousness and neuroticism level pre-\ndicted self-reported blood pressure. All trait levels except agreeableness predicted number of work days limited. Only\nchange in conscientiousness predicted the number of work days limited.\nDiscussion. Findings demonstrate that a full understanding of the link between personality and health requires\nconsideration of trait change as well as trait level.\nKey Words: Health--Longitudinal change--Personality.\nthe association between neuroticism and mortality, at least\namong older adults (Mroczek, Spiro, & Turiano, 2009).\nPeople high in neuroticism also have a higher risk of develop-\ning hypertension (Spiro, Aldwin, Ward, & Mroczek, 1995)\nas well as obesity and metabolic syndrome (Hampson &\nThe personality\u00adhealth link is less established for the\nother Big Five traits, but the body of evidence is growing.\nEarlier investigations of the Type A behavior pattern and\nhostility facet of agreeableness clearly demonstrated an as-\nsociation with risk of coronary heart disease (Myrtek, 2001;\nRosenman et al., 1964) as well as poor health behaviors\n(Brummett et al., 2006). More recent investigations of gen-\neral trait agreeableness also suggest that lower levels are\nassociated with increased mortality risk (Weiss & Costa,\n2005). A small number of studies found that low levels of\nextraversion predicted earlier mortality (e.g., Wilson et al.,\n2004). Additionally, people high in extraversion tend to ex-\nperience greater amounts of positive affect and optimism,\nboth of which are also associated with health and longevity\n(Danner, Snowdon, & Friesen, 2001). Openness has the\nfewest documented links to health. Yet, recent studies have\nfound higher levels of openness to be protective against earlier\nThe Effect of Trait Change on Physical Health\nMost models of personality and health exclusively con-\nceptualize traits as static fixed predictors in the explanatory\nchain that proceeds from traits to disease and ultimately\nmortality. However, there are now studies documenting\nthat personality traits do change in adulthood (Jones &\nViechtbauer, 2006; Small, Hertzog, Hultsch, & Dixon,\n2003), although they tend to change slowly over a number\nof years and they do not change for everyone; some indi-\nviduals do remain stable. Furthermore, it is quite rare that\npredictors of health, whether psychosocial or biomedical,\ndo not possess some dynamic element that changes over\ntime. Thus, our theoretical model goes further by hypothe-\nsizing that personality trait change is likely to be, along with\ninitial trait level, important in predicting health outcomes.\nThe theoretical position that trait change, along with trait\nlevel, is both important for health outcomes is supported by\na small number of recent studies. Mroczek and Spiro (2007)\ndocumented both level and rate of change in neuroticism\npredicted mortality over 18 years. Hampson and colleagues\n(2010) demonstrated that change in agreeableness and so-\nciability predicts substance use. Siegler and colleagues\n(2003) found that decreases in agreeableness predicted a\nwide range of physical health risk factors, including obesity,\navoidance of exercise, a high-fat diet, and self-reports that\none's physical health had changed for the worse. Although\npersonality traits are often assumed static risk factors for ill-\nness or health, akin to the way that sex or race is conceived\nas unchanging predictors, these more recent findings con-\nfirm that personality change has implications for the asso-\nciation between personality and health. That is, if someone\nis at a given trait level (e.g., the 5th percentile on conscien-\ntiousness), their risk of developing a health problem is ele-\nvated. However, their risk may be reduced if the person\nchanges in the positive direction (e.g., rises to the 50th per-\ncentile on conscientiousness).\nPresent Study\nIn the current study, we examined the predictive effect of\nboth level and change among the Big Five personality traits\non three very different health outcomes assessed over a de-\ncade after initial personality trait measurements: (a) self-\nrated physical health, (b) self-reported blood pressure, and\n(c) number of days limited at work or home due to physical\nhealth reasons.\nHypotheses\nWith respect to trait level, we expected that higher levels\nof agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and\nopenness would predict better health profiles, whereas\nhigher levels of neuroticism would be associated with worse\noverall physical health. Moreover, we expected that people\ndecreasing on agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraver-\nsion, and openness (from MIDUS 1 to MIDUS 2) would\npredict worse health, whereas increases should be associ-\nated with better physical health. For neuroticism, we ex-\npected a decrease to be associated with better physical\nhealth, whereas increases predicting worse health. Finally,\nfor all the above, we tested whether level and change can\ncombine in multiplicative ways to predict health outcomes.\nAlthough exploratory, previous work by Mroczek and\nSpiro (2007) demonstrates the utility in uncovering level by\nchange effects.\nMethod\nSample and Longitudinal Design\nThe first wave of the MIDUS study (MIDUS 1) collected\nsurvey data from 7,108 noninstitutionalized English-speak-\ning adults in the coterminous United States, aged 25\u00ad74\nfollow-up of the original MIDUS study was conducted in\nall the original respondents and invite them to participate in\na second wave of data collection. The average longitudinal\nfollow-up interval was approximately nine years (7.8\u00ad10.4\nresponse rated, adjusted for mortality) were successfully\ncontacted to participate in another phone interview of ap-\nproximately 30 min in length. Those who completed both\nthe self-administered questionnaires (SAQ) and the phone\nApproximately 70% of participants were retained from\nable to interview, and 9% no working phone number). Anal-\nysis of attrition revealed that respondents lost to follow-up\ndiffered from those who participated in the longitudinal panel\non certain variables. The longitudinal sample was signifi-\nlongitudinal sample also had significantly higher self-rated\nselective attrition among the MIDUS longitudinal sample is\navailable elsewhere (Radler & Ryff, 2010).\nMeasures\nControl variables.--All models were adjusted for age, sex,\n2, and the sex distribution of participants was 47% male\n(coded as 0) and 53% female (coded as 1). Participants re-\nported the highest level of education completed, which ranged\nfrom 1 (some grade school/high school) to 4 (college gradu-\nate to professional degree). Approximately 39% had a high-\nschool degree or graduate equivalence degree, whereas 30%\nhad graduated college or obtained a professional degree.\nHealth outcomes.--The health outcomes considered\nwere assessed via the phone interview portion of the MIDUS\n2. First, self-rated physical health was assessed by the fol-\nlowing question: \"In general, would you say your physical\nhealth is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?\" Scores\nranged from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). This straightforward\nevaluation of health is a valuable outcome because there is\nstrong empirical support that subjective evaluations of\nhealth predict mortality above and beyond objective health\nstatus measures and other known risk factors (DeSalvo,\nBioser, Reynolds, He, & Muntner, 2005; Idler & Benyamini,\nSelf-reported blood pressure evaluated if personality\nlevel and change predicted a more direct physiological mea-\nsure of health. Participants responded if their blood pressure\nat their last physician visit was low, about normal, slightly\nraised, or high. Scores ranged from 1 (low) to 4 (high). Self-\nreported blood pressure is a quick and an effective means of\nassessing the physiologic aspect of general health. In fact,\nestimates show that a sizable proportion of global prema-\nture deaths and disability each year is attributed to high\nblood pressure (Lawes, Vander Hoorn, & Rodgers, 2008).\nThe third outcome, work limitations, was assessed by\nasking how many of the past thirty days respondents were\nlimited in their work or normal household work activities\nbecause of physical health. Respondents were required to\ngive the actual number of days out of 30, with 0 meaning\nthat no work limitations occurred. This outcome provides a\nmore functional day-to-day evaluation of how health limits\nindividuals from working or completing normative daily\ntasks (Keyes & Grzywacz, 2005). In essence, it measures\nthe degree of impairment experienced on a daily level\nspecifically because of physical functioning.\nUtilizing these distinct yet related outcomes allows for a\nmore comprehensive understanding of how personality and\npersonality change influences various proxies of health.\nThey provide a broad array of general, physiologic, and\nfunctional indices of health. As displayed in Supplementary\nTable 1, the correlations between the outcomes demonstrate\nthe interconnectedness of such physical health proxies. Spe-\ncifically, the correlations between self-rated health and both\nblood pressure and work days limited were negative, and\nthose reporting better overall physical health also report\nlower blood pressure and fewer days limited in work.\nPersonality traits.--The key predictor variables (person-\nality trait level and trait change) were assessed via the self-\nadministered adjectival measures of the Big Five assessed\nspondents were asked how much each of 25 adjectives de-\nscribed themselves on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to\n4 (a lot). The adjectives were moody, worrying, nervous,\nand calm (neuroticism); outgoing, friendly, lively, active,\nand talkative (extraversion); creative, imaginative, intelli-\ngent, curious, broad minded, sophisticated, and adventurous\n(openness); organized, responsible, hardworking, and care-\nless, (conscientiousness); and helpful, warm, caring, soft-\nhearted, and sympathetic (agreeableness). The mean was\ncalculated from the adjectives for each trait after reverse\nscoring the appropriate items.\nThe MIDUS Big Five scale was developed from a combi-\nnation of existing personality trait lists and inventories\n(Lachman & Weaver, 1997). From these lists, the most con-\nsistently used adjectives were selected and used in a pilot\ntify the adjectives with the highest item to total correlations\nand factor loadings. This scale has good construct validity\n(Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998) and significantly correlates with\nthe NEO trait scales (Prenda & Lachman, 2001). Examina-\ntion of the correlation matrix also provides evidence of con-\nstruct validity for this scale (Supplementary Table 1). There\nwas a significant and positive correlation between agree-\nableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness,\nwhereas there was a significant and negative correlation be-\ntween neuroticism and the other four personality traits. Fur-\nthermore, the longitudinal trait correlations from MIDUS 1\nto MIDUS 2 were .64 for agreeableness, .62 for conscien-\ntiousness, .69 for extraversion, .64 for neuroticism, and .70\nfor openness. Reliability alphas for the personality traits are\nas follows: agreeableness = .80, conscientiousness = .58,\nTable 1. Mean Big Five Scores for MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 With Paired t Tests\nTrait MIDUS 1 MIDUS 2 Mean change score (SD) Change score range t (df)\nPaired t tests using a Bonferroni adjustment documented\nif each of the Big Five mean trait scores was significantly\ndifferent from MIDUS 1 to MIDUS 2 (Table 1). These anal-\nyses indicated that each of the Big Five trait mean scores\ndecreased over the 9- to 10-year interval, and all the five\nmean differences were statistically significant, thus indicating\nmean-level personality change (Table 1).\nPersonality change scores.--Ideally, a study of change\ncontains at least three occasions of measurement along with\nmodeling that is specialized for estimating change (e.g.,\nmultilevel modeling). However, many long-term longitudi-\nnal studies, such as the MIDUS, do not yet have three waves\nof data. The use of change scores in such studies have re-\nemerged in recent years as an acceptable and a transparent\nway of assessing change if one is limited by two measure-\nment occasions (Mroczek & Spiro, 2007; Mroczek, Almeida,\n2000). In the current study, trait scores from the MIDUS 1\nwere subtracted from MIDUS 2 scores for each of the Big\nFive. This yielded a difference score, or change score, for\neach of the five traits for each person. Persons with positive\nchange scores were those for whom an MIDUS 2 trait score\nwas higher than their MIDUS 1 score. These were individu-\nals who increased on a given trait. Conversely, persons with\nnegative change scores were those for whom a MIDUS 2\ntrait score was lower than their MIDUS 1 trait score.A change\nscore of zero implied stability over the 9- to 10-year inter-\nval between the two measurement occasions. The range\nand standard deviations for all trait change scores are\ndisplayed in Table 1.\nNote, the negative means for trait change reflect the find-\nings from the t tests analyses showing that scores on each of\nthe Big Five went down over the decade-long longitudinal\ninterval (Table 1). Note also that neuroticism has the largest\nmean change score in terms of magnitude (-.17) and also\nthe highest standard deviation of the five, indicating greater\nindividual differences in amount of change compared with\nthe other four traits. Note that change scores were as large\nas 2 in some individuals (Table 1).\nOne limitation of change scores is that they may repre-\nsent regression to the mean and not represent real change.\nExamination of the variance in change scores explained by\nbaseline (MIDUS 1) score suggested that the changes repre-\nsented more than just regression to the mean: R-squared\nvalues were .16 (agreeableness), .14 (conscientiousness),\nStatistical Analysis\nEach of the three health outcomes from MIDUS 2 were\nregressed on the estimates of trait level and trait change for\neach of the Big Five, controlling for age, sex, education, and\nsample. Because all Big Five traits (trait level and change)\nwere included in one parsimonious model, the effects con-\ntrol for one another. The mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2\npersonality scores represented trait level and the difference\nscores represented trait change. The former indicated\nwhether absolute amount of a given trait predicted health.\nWe chose to use the mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 per-\nsonality scores instead of the MIDUS 1 score by itself to\nrepresent trait level because adjustment for baseline scores\nwhen analyzing change is known to lead to spurious results\nin the presence of measurement error (Cain, Kronmal, &\nKosinski, 1992; Glymour, Weave, Berkman, Kawachi, &\nRobins, 2005). The underlying problem is that when ad-\njusted for a noisy baseline measurement, the change score\ncarries information about both level and change. Use of the\nmean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 measurements as trait\nlevel avoids this issue but in the process underestimates the\ntrue effect of change (Cain et al., 1992). Lastly, a small\nnumber of participants gave responses of don't know or did\nnot give answers to some questions. This reduced the num-\nber of respondents in the current study depending on the\noutcome variable (see Table 2).\nResults\nAge and education were significant covariates for all three\nhealth outcomes. Increasing age and lower levels of educa-\ntion were associated with poorer evaluations of health, higher\nblood pressure ratings, and more reported days limited in\nwork. Sex was a significant predictor for self-rated health and\nblood pressure but not for days limited in work. Women\nreported better physical health and lower blood pressure.\nTable 2 displays the regression models for all three out-\ncomes investigated. For self-rated physical health, higher\nlevels of conscientiousness and extraversion predicted bet-\nter self-rated physical health at MIDUS 2. Higher levels of\nneuroticism and agreeableness were associated with worse\nself-rated physical health in the MIDUS 2. With respect to\ntrait change, increases in conscientiousness and extraver-\nsion predicted better self-rated physical health at MIDUS 2.\nConversely, increases in agreeableness predicted worse\nself-rated physical health in MIDUS 2.\nPersonality levels of conscientiousness and neuroticism\nwere significant predictors of self-reported blood pressure.\nHigher levels of conscientiousness predicted lower reported\nblood pressure, whereas higher levels of neuroticism pre-\ndicted higher blood pressure at MIDUS 2. None of the five\ntrait change variables predicted blood pressure at MIDUS 2.\nPersonality level was a significant predictor of the number\nof days limited at work for all traits except agreeableness.\nHigher levels of conscientiousness and extraversion pre-\ndicted fewer limited days in MIDUS 2. Conversely, higher\nlevels of neuroticism and openness were associated with\nmore limited workdays. Only conscientiousness change pre-\ndicted work limitations. Increases in conscientiousness pre-\ndicted fewer work limitations in MIDUS 2. Lastly, none of\nthe interactions between trait level and change were signifi-\ncant predictors of the three health outcomes.\nBecause the MIDUS study includes a subsample of twins\n(30%) and siblings (15%), we conducted a post hoc sensi-\ntivity analysis to ensure independence of observations. Spe-\ncifically, one twin/sibling from each pair was randomly\ndropped, and all analyses were conducted with this reduced\nsample. The statistical significance of each main effect was\nnot affected, even in a substantially reduced sample size.\nDiscussion\nThis study builds on previous investigations document-\ning that the level of personality traits predicts health out-\ncomes (Bogg & Roberts, 2004; Hampson & Friedman,\nMendes de Leon, Evans, & Bennett, 2003) and extends\nthose findings to a national sample of Americans. Across all\nthree health variables, higher levels of conscientiousness\npredicted better health outcomes, whereas higher levels of\nneuroticism reflected poorer outcomes. Higher levels of\nextraversion predicted better self-rated health and fewer\nhealth-related work reductions, whereas higher levels of\nopenness predicted fewer work reductions. Lastly, higher\nlevels of agreeableness predicted poorer health outcomes.\nAs noted in the \"Introduction,\" considerable prior work has\ndocumented the impact of neuroticism and conscientious-\nness on health, but few studies prior to this investigation\nhave shown evidence that higher levels of agreeableness,\nextraversion, and openness are also significant predictors of\nhealth.\nMost importantly, this study provides evidence that long-\nterm change in the Big Five is related to various indices of\nphysical health, thereby extending similar findings from\nsmaller and less representative samples (Hampson et al.,\nfindings were strongest for self-rated physical health, where\nas predicted, increments on the more positive traits (consci-\nentiousness and extraversion) predicted better health, whereas\ndecrements predicted poorer health. Counter to hypotheses\nand previous literature, being more agreeable and increases\nin this trait predicted poorer self-rated health. For blood\npressure, none of the change scores were significant predic-\ntors. However, increases in conscientiousness significantly\npredicted fewer health-related work reductions.\nTable 2.

All variables expressed in standard deviation units. Males are the referent group.\naPersonality level = mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 personality.\nOverall, such results underscore the importance of cross-\ntime dynamics in personality traits as independent influ-\nences on health. The fact that both trait level and change\npredicted self-rated health, an outcome that clearly predicts\nmortality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997), constitutes an impor-\ntant extension of prior literature that personality traits are\nnot static risk factors but dynamic predictors of health\n(Mroczek & Spiro, 2007). In fact, the percentages of\nexplained variance specifically by personality (trait and\nchange net of controls) were highest for self-rated health\nand work reductions (R2 = .01). Future work is clearly\nneeded to document the scope of effects of personality and\nchange on multiple indices of physical health.\nFuture Directions\nMechanisms linking personality and health.--As evi-\ndence accumulates linking personality (level and change)\nand health outcomes, research will necessarily need to shift\nin the direction of accounting for these effects, that is, expli-\ncating the pathways through which core individual differ-\nence variables are consequential for multiple aspects of\nhealth, including disability, morbidity, and mortality. From\nan epidemiological framework, personality traits are distal\npredictors of health, meaning personality operates through\na series of interconnected mechanisms. Thus, future inqui-\nries would benefit from simultaneously attending to behav-\nioral and psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., Friedman, 2000;\nas related physiological processes (neuroendocrine, cardio-\nvascular, and inflammatory; e.g., B. Singer & Ryff, 2001;\nPutting all the above together to understand how person-\nality traits set in motion a panoply of influences (behavioral,\npsychosocial, and situational), many of which invoke multi-\nfaceted biological substrates, is a tall agenda. In managing\nthe attendant complexities, there is merit in invoking the\nidea of a pathway through which these multiple influences\nconverge, albeit via different combinations of factors for\ndifferent subgroups of individuals. Previous work illustrates\nhow to implement this kind of integrative approach with\nnovel (at least for psychologists) analytic tools, such as re-\ncursive partitioning (Gruenewald, Mroczek, Ryff, & Singer,\n2008), which allow for multiway interactions as well as\nnonlinear relations among variables on the way to particular\nhealth outcomes.\nFinally, to the extent that such integrative analyses inter-\nest investigators toiling in the above fields, such inquiries\nshould not be disproportionately focused on negative path-\nways (i.e., how high neuroticism or low conscientiousness\nactivate an array of dysfunctional processes that culminate\nin early morbidity or mortality). Extensive attention is also\nneeded to understand the positive/preventive pathways (i.e.,\nhow high extraversion, agreeableness, and openness con-\ntribute to a multitude of salutogenic processes that help\nkeep people healthy as they move across the decades of\nadulthood and later life), which illuminate how positive\nhealth is achieved and sustained (Ryff & Singer, 1998).\nPrevention and intervention.--In light of the inherent\ncomplexities connecting personality to health, the fact\nremains that personality is a set of malleable traits. A more\nrecent framework for personality development is the idea of\ninterindividual differences in personality change through-\nout adulthood (Mroczek & Spiro, 2007; Roberts & Mroczek,\nviduals remain stable on personality traits, whereas some\nincrease and others decrease. Moreover, Mroczek and Spiro\n(2007) show that this change has important consequences\non healthnamely mortality.\nThe main issue that remains is how to facilitate personal-\nity change that benefits health over the life course. First,\nepidemiologic research would stress targeting upstream\nfactors or preventative measures earlier in life to impede\ntrajectories of damaging health behavior and physiological\nfunctioning (Moffitt et al., 2011). Second, it is not entirely\nclear to what extent personality would need to change to\naffect deleterious downstream processes. Current research\nshows that personality change occurs over long time spans\n(i.e., decades; Roberts et al., 2006), and the effect sizes are\nmodest, so any brief personality intervention will likely\nfalter. However, when examining personality during longer\ndurations such as from young adulthood to old age, traits\nsuch as conscientiousness have shown increases up to a full\nstandard deviation (Roberts et al. 2006). Third, it is un-\nlikely that one size would fit all because some individuals\nas well as certain traits are more amenable to personality\nchange than others (Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005) in cer-\ntain environments (Caspi & Moffitt, 1993), and there is\nevidence for individual differences in who remains stable,\nwho changes, and the rate of change (Mroczek & Spiro,\nPotential interventions aimed at single or multiple as-\npects of personality could include changing the underly-\ning cognitive or psychological processes associated with\nparticular traits (i.e., creativity, responsibility), the physi-\nological responses to stress (i.e., dampening stress reac-\ntivity of the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal axis), or the\nhealth behaviors associated with particular traits (i.e.,\nsubstance use behaviors). For example, targeting specific\naspects of personality for individuals scoring higher in\nneuroticism that are predisposed to experience negative\naffect and adverse physiologic arousal would involve im-\nplementing more effective ways to deal with stress (e.g.,\nrelaxation techniques, refraining from smoking) or in-\ncreasing self-control (Moffitt et al., 2011). These techniques\nare not necessarily changing a person's level of neuroti-\ncism but the negative health behaviors and physiological\nreactions underlying this trait. At this point, it may be pre-\nsumptuous to suggest specific personality-related interven-\ntions, but some have laid out a framework for doing so\n(Moffitt et al., 2011), and preliminary intervention research\nprovides promise (Baumeister, Gailliot, DeWall, & Oaten,\nson, Hill, Payne, Roberts, & Stine-Morrow, Under review).\nLimitations\nThe main limitation of the current study is the availability\nof only two measurement occasions of personality. With\nonly two measurement occasions, advanced statistical tech-\nniques such as \"MLM\" are not appropriate (J. D. Singer &\nWillett, 2003). Utilizing change scores is often criticized\nwith respect to regression to the mean. However, after using\nthe mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 personality scores to\nrepresent level, we are confident that the analysis estimated\ntrue trait change and not simply a statistical artifact caused\nby regression to the mean. In fact, this technique actually\nleads to an underestimate of the change score effect (Cain\ngued, the concerns regarding change scores are more per-\nceived than real. A second limitation of having only two\nmeasurements of personality is the inability to estimate rate\nof change or any parameter that informs us about the pro-\nJ. D. Singer & Willett, 2003). Using statistical techniques\nsuch as \"MLM\" when at least three time points are available\nwill permit the best estimation growth curves that are charac-\nterized by relatively accurate intercepts and slopes in any psy-\nchosocial variable (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; J. D. Singer &\nAddressing a final issue of change, trait change itself is\npredicted by such variables as role change (Roberts, 1997;\nRoberts & Chapman, 2001), major life events (divorce and\ndeath of spouse; Mroczek & Spiro, 2003), and health itself\n(Mroczek & Spiro, 2007). Moreover, the two points of mea-\nsurement in the MIDUS does not establish cause\u00adeffect re-\nlationships among personality, change, and health, which\nmust be considered when interpreting the findings of the\ncurrent study. It would be interesting to examine the com-\nplex pathways and feedback loops between role change,\nhealth, or life events with personality and trait change.\nA second caveat of the current study is the interconnect-\nedness of personality and self-reported health outcomes.\nFor example, individuals scoring higher in neuroticism tend\nto report more negative health symptoms and perceive\nthemselves in poorer health (Chapman, Duberstein,\n& Pennebaker, 1989). Thus, self-reported health outcomes\nby neurotics may not reflect poorer health but their perception\nof their health. There are apparent difficulties in disentangling\nperceived versus actual health, but as stated earlier, it is this\nperception of one's own health that is a better predictor of\nmortality than more objective measures. Likewise, it is not a\ncoincidence that the higher levels of the other Big Five traits\nare associated with better self-reported health (Goodwin, &\nEngstrom, 2002). Individuals high in these traits are likely\nto report better health simply because they are the ones in\nbetter health, which can be supported empirically (Hamp-\nson & Friedman, 2008). Moreover, the selective attrition\nfrom MIDUS 1 to MIDUS 2 leaves unanswered questions\nabout the role of personality change among those already in\npoor health. Drop out among those lower in conscientious-\nness and higher in neuroticism could bias the findings but\nare also likely to underestimate the effect of personality and\nchange on the health outcomes investigated. The significant\nmain effects for both personality level and change in the\ncurrent study exist despite range restrictions due to selective\ndrop out based on personality as well as those already rating\ntheir health as poor.\nLastly, future investigations would benefit from more de-\nscriptive (i.e., both systolic and diastolic) and objective\nmeasures of blood pressure from trained personnel. Al-\nthough physicians actually measured blood pressure at a\nprevious medical visit, participants were still required to\nretrospectively report whether their doctor told them that\nthey had low, normal, or high blood pressure. Obviously,\nthis may influence the validity of this outcome. It would be\nmore useful to have exact readings of systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure that provide an opportunity to examine pulse\npressure (systolic minus diastolic), which may be the best\npredictor of subsequent cardiovascular function (Haider,\nConclusions\nDespite the noted limitations, the current study adds to\nthe burgeoning literature that personality traits predict im-\nportant health outcomes. Moreover, this study is among the\nfirst documenting that both personality trait level and trait\nchange predict various health outcomes. The findings are\nalso strengthened by longitudinal period (approximately 10\nyears) and the national representativeness of this sample.\nUncovering personality level and change combinations that\nlead to poor or positive health outcomes over time should\nbecome a priority for personality\u00adhealth research. Indeed,\ntrait change may occur slowly and for many people may not\noccur at all. Yet for others, trait change becomes a salient\nfactor influencing physical health outcomes across the life\ncourse.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by grants from the National Institute on\nto conduct a longitudinal follow-up of the MIDUS (Midlife in the United\nStates) investigation.
