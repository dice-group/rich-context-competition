    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: The number of international medical graduates (IMGs) entering family medicine in the\nUnited States of America has steadily increased since 1997. Previous research has examined practice\nlocations of these IMGs and their role in providing care to underserved populations. To our knowledge,\nresearch does not exist comparing professional profiles, credentials and attitudes among IMG and United\nStates medical graduate (USMG) family physicians in the United States. The objective of this study is to\ndetermine, at the time when a large influx of IMGs into family medicine began, whether differences existed\nbetween USMG and IMG family physicians in regard to personal and professional characteristics and\nattitudes that may have implications for the health care system resulting from the increasing numbers of\nIMGs in family medicine in the United States.\nMethods: This is a secondary data analysis of the 1996\u00ad1997 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician\nSurvey comparing 2360 United States medical graduates and 366 international medical graduates who\nwere nonfederal allopathic or osteopathic family physicians providing direct patient care for at least 20\nhours per week.\nResults: Compared to USMGs, IMGs were older (p < 0.001) and practised in smaller (p = 0.0072) and\nyounger practices (p < 0.001). Significantly more IMGs practised in metropolitan areas versus rural areas\npatients, and a greater percentage of their revenue was derived from these patients (p = 0.0020 and p =\n0.0310). Fewer IMGs were board-certified (p < 0.001). More IMGs were dissatisfied with their overall\ncareers (p = 0.0190). IMGs and USMGs did not differ in terms of self-rated ability to deliver high-quality\ncare to their patients (p = 0.4626). For several of the clinical vignettes, IMGs were more likely to order\ntests, refer patients to specialists or require office visits than USMGs.\nConclusion: There are significant differences between IMG and USMG family physicians' professional\nprofiles and attitudes. These differences from 1997 merit further exploration and possible follow-up, given\nthe increased proportion of family physicians who are IMGs in the United States.\nThis article is available from: http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/4/1/17\n\u00a9 2006 Morris et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nInternational Medical Graduates (IMGs) comprised\ncontinue to rise, given the large increase of IMGs entering\nfamily medicine residency programmes [1].\nHistorically, family medicine has a smaller proportion of\nIMGs entering residency training than other primary-care\nspecialties. This relationship is changing as IMGs increas-\ningly filled family medicine residency positions not\nselected by United States Medical Graduates (USMGs),\nparticularly those vacant after the annual Match [2].\nfamily medicine residencies were filled by IMGs, an\nincrease of 97 positions from the previous year [3]. On 1\nrise is unique to family medicine, as the number of IMGs\nentering other primary-care fields has remained relatively\nstable over the past eight years [4].\nEarlier research documented that certain residency pro-\ngrammes have become \"dependent\" on IMGs, who\noccupy most or all of their positions [2,5]. It is possible\nthat differences in training backgrounds may translate to\nimportant differences in the practice of medicine relating\nto issues such as health care costs and access to care. As the\nUnited States relies heavily on family physicians to serve a\nlarge portion of its population [6], it is important to con-\nsider what, if anything, this influx of IMGs might portend\nfor the future of the specialty and health care in the\nnation.\nIMG's geographical and specialty distributions, their con-\ntribution to meeting the needs of the medically unders-\nerved, and the value of Conrad-20 and other visa-waiver\nprogrammes that integrate them into the United States\nphysician workforce have been examined in past studies\n[7-10]. A few studies have focused on IMGs performance\nat the residency training level and their post-training med-\nical practices [11-13]. Although several of these studies\nevaluate IMGs in primary-care specialties, none of them\nfocus solely on the field of family medicine. Previous\nresearch has neither described the attributes and influ-\nences of IMG medical practices nor characterized IMGs'\nprofessional credentials and attitudes beyond the resi-\ndency level in family medicine.\nIn this paper we examine personal, professional and prac-\ntice characteristics and attitudes of IMG and USMG family\nphysicians in order to provide insight into practice differ-\nences that may affect the health care system. We use data\nfrom a nationally representative survey collected in 1996\u00ad\n1997, a time when major increases in the proportion of\nIMGs in family medicine residency training began, to\nanswer the question: \"Do significant differences exist\nbetween IMG and USMG family physicians that warrant\nfurther investigation?\"\nWe compare physician-reported personal, professional\nand practice characteristics, attitudes regarding clinical\ncare, assessments of various influences on the delivery of\nmedical care, referral patterns and responses to clinical\nvignettes between the two groups. Beyond forming a base-\nline comparison and characterization for future analyses,\nthis analysis highlights findings that may have implica-\ntions for the health care system as a whole resulting from\nthe increasing numbers of IMGs in family medicine in the\nUnited States.\nMethods\nData sources\nData used in this study were collected through the Com-\nmunity Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, a project\nof the Center for Studying Health System Change, in\nWashington, DC, and obtained from the Inter-University\nConsortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), in\nAnn Arbor, Michigan [14]. The CTS is a biannual survey\nsponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to\nstudy changes in the health care system and their impact\non individuals. The sample frame consisted of nonfederal\nMDs and DOs who provided direct patient care for at least\nally representative sample containing special provisions\nto examine practice characteristics and tendencies in addi-\ntion to the responses to 12 clinical vignettes. Primary-care\nphysicians were oversampled, and of the 2726 family phy-\nIMGs. Residents and fellows were not surveyed. The over-\nall response rate was 65% and the response number to\neach individual item is listed in each table. The CTS does\nnot identify the specific response rates between IMG and\nUSMG participants.\nStudy variables\nWe compared responses to survey items between IMG and\nUSMG family physicians. The CTS defined International\nMedical Graduates as graduates of medical schools out-\nside the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The CTS\nalso included the responses from general practitioners in\nthe family physician group.\nWe examined several survey items relating to personal and\nprofessional characteristics including age, years in prac-\ntice, net income and board-certification status. We\nassessed various practice characteristics including practice\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nlocation (large metro, small metro, non-metro as defined\nby the 1995 United States Census), practice type (solo or\ntwo physicians, group practice, health maintenance\norganization (HMO), hospital-based, medical school,\nother), net income and percentages of income from vari-\nous sources (Medicare, Medicaid, HMO, bonuses). We\nalso compared the number of new Medicare and Medicaid\npatients each physician was accepting into his or her prac-\ntice.\nThe survey items queried physicians' agreement with\nstatements regarding clinical care using a five-point Likert\nscale (\"disagree strongly\", \"disagree somewhat\", \"neither\nagree nor disagree\",\" agree somewhat\", or \"agree\nstrongly\"). There were few \"neither agree nor disagree\"\nresponses. In order to compare each group, we eliminated\nthe category and collapsed the remaining groups into two\nresponse groups: \"agree\" or \"disagree\", as has been done\nwith analysis of these data in other research [15].\nThe physicians were similarly asked about career satisfac-\ntion (\"Thinking very generally about your overall career in\nmedicine, would you say that you are currently very satis-\nfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dis-\nsatisfied, or neither satisfied or dissatisfied?\"). These\nresponses were collapsed to \"dissatisfied\" or \"satisfied\"\nfor our analysis.\nWe compared survey items that assessed various influ-\nences on the physicians' practice of medicine. These items\ninclude the effects of using computers to obtain patient\ndata and treatment guidelines, using preventive treatment\nreminders and formal written guidelines, and the effects\nof practice profile results and patient satisfaction surveys.\nIn order to compare referral patterns among physicians,\nwe analysed responses to survey items regarding the\nnumber of patients the physicians referred to specialists,\nthe complexity of the medical conditions of those patients\nthey did not refer to specialists, and the complexity of\nmedical conditions the physicians felt specialists expected\nthem to care for without referral. These survey items asked\neach physician to state whether each item had \"decreased\na lot\", \"decreased a little\", \"stayed the same\", \"increased a\nlittle\", or \"increased a lot\" over the previous two years.\nqueried physicians about medications, tests and referrals\nthey would order for various clinical scenarios.\nAnalytic strategy\nUSMG and IMG practice characteristics, professional atti-\ntudes and satisfaction were contrasted by means of chi-\nsquare and t-tests. SUDAAN software, version 8.0\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNorth Carolina, United States of America) was used for\nstatistical comparisons and making national estimates.\nSUDAAN adjusted variance due to non-response and CTS\nsurvey design complexities. Statistical significance was set\nResults\nUSMGs and 366 were IMGs. We found that IMGs were\nolder than USMGs, but significantly more likely to have\nbeen in practice for fewer years (Table 1). IMGs were more\nlikely to practise in metropolitan areas than in non-met-\nropolitan areas, with 82% of IMGs in metropolitan areas\ncentage of IMGs were full owners of their practices and\nmore often in solo or two-physician groups. Only 67% of\nIMGs were board-certified, compared to 87% of USMGs\n(p < 0.001). More IMGs were accepting all new Medicare\na greater percentage of their revenue from Medicare and\nMedicaid than their USMG counterparts. IMGs served as\n\"gatekeepers\" and were required to provide permission to\nsee specialists for a greater percentage of their patients\nthan USMGs. Differences between IMGs and USMGs\nregarding net income, hours in direct patient care, per-\ncentage of revenue from managed care, and percentage of\nincome from bonuses were not significant (data not\nshown).\nIMGs were more likely to report having adequate time to\nbeing able to develop continuing patient relationships\nIMGs were dissatisfied with their overall medical careers\nThere were no significant differences between IMGs and\nUSMGs regarding perceived ability or freedom to provide\nhigh-quality care, to communicate with specialists and to\nmake clinical decisions without reducing income. IMGs\nreported that preventive treatment reminders, formal\nwritten guidelines and patient satisfaction surveys had\nmore influences on their practice of medicine than\nUSMGs (data not shown).\nThere were no significant differences between IMGs and\nUSMGs on the effects of using computers on obtaining\npatient data and treatment guidelines and the effects of\npractice profile results (data not shown). Small but signif-\nicant differences existed between IMGs and USMGs with\nregard to referral patterns, but no meaningful trends were\nidentified (data not shown).\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 1: Personal, professional and practice characteristics of IMG and USMG family physicians\nAccepting new Medicare patients (n = 2726)\nAccepting new Medicaid patients (n = 2726)\nPercentage of revenue from\nPercentage of revenue from\nPercentage of patients for\nwhom physician serves as\n*Unweighted number of survey respondents and weighted percentage of family physicians.

For many clinical scenarios, IMGs were more\nlikely to order tests, refer patients to specialists or require\noffice visits than USMGs.\nDiscussion\nThis study suggests that IMGs and USMGs who practise\nfamily medicine differ in important ways. Professionally,\nfewer IMGs are board-certified, compared to USMGs.\nTheir practices differ from those of USMGs in terms of\npractice location and service of the Medicare and Medic-\naid populations. Significantly fewer IMGs report being\nsatisfied overall with their medical careers than USMGs.\nFurthermore, subtle differences exist between the groups\nin regards to patient referral patterns and in their\nresponses to several clinical vignettes. These differences, if\nthey continue to exist, may affect important aspects of the\nhealth care system, particularly access to care and health\ncare use and costs.\nFewer IMGs are board-certified than USMGs\nThe CTS survey data do not allow us to ascertain the etiol-\nogy of this profound difference. Prerequisites for becom-\ning board-certified in family medicine include unlimited\nlicensure to practise medicine, completion of a three-year\nresidency programme in family medicine, with the last\ntwo years being at the same location, and a passing score\non the American Board of Family Practice Board Certifica-\ntion Exam.\nPhysicians surveyed in this study were practising medicine\nprior to the implementation of the Clinical Skills Assess-\nment (CSA) requirement for IMGs to enter United States\nresidency programmes. This requirement was imple-\nmented by the Educational Commission for Foreign Med-\nical Graduates (ECFMG) in July 1998 to evaluate IMGs'\nclinical and communication skills [16]. Since the imple-\nmentation of the CSA, the United States Medical Licensing\nExam (USMLE) Step 1 and 2 passage rates of IMGs receiv-\ning ECFMG certification have increased. We may also see\nincreases in the percentage of board-certified IMG family\nphysicians in the future with this new requirement.\nIt is uncertain how board certification and exam-passing\nrates correlate to quality outcomes in clinical practice. An\nextensive literature review performed in 1997 revealed\nthat insufficient evidence existed to support or refute the\nuse of board certification as a proxy for physician quality\n[12]. More recent studies suggest that board certification\nand maintenance of certification may be linked to\nimproved clinical outcomes [17]. Furthermore, the public\nplaces a high value on board certification and would\npotentially change behaviour to ensure their physician is\nboard-certified[17]. The difference between IMGs' and\nTable 2: Attitudes regarding clinical care of IMG and USMG family physicians\n\"I have adequate time to spend with my patients during typical office/patient visits.\" (n = 2664)\n\"It is possible to maintain the kind of continuing relationships with patients over time that promote the delivery of high quality\n\"It is possible to provide high-quality care to all my patients.\" (n = 2679)\n\"I have the freedom to make clinical decisions that meet my patients' needs.\" (n = 2685)\n\"The level of communication I have with specialists about the patients I refer to them is sufficient to ensure the delivery of a high\n\"I can make clinical decisions in the best interests of my patients without the possibility of reducing my income.\" (n = 2601)\n*Unweighted number of survey respondents and weighted percentage of family physicians.

It is also\nimportant to address the proposed link between board-\ncertification status and physician quality in future studies.\nSignificantly more IMG family physicians are practising in\nmore urban areas as opposed to rural areas\nPrevious studies found that IMGs comprise a larger por-\ntion of the primary-care physician workforce in rural areas\nwith physician shortages than USMGs, but these studies\nlumped primary care as a single workforce [9,10]. Our\nstudy and another national study both reveal that IMGs in\nfamily medicine, the primary-care specialty most likely to\ndistribute like the United States population, are less likely\nto practise in rural areas than USMGs [8].\nAlthough a greater percentage of new physicians entering\nHealth Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are IMGs, the\nmajority of these physicians are temporary visa holders\n[18]. It is uncertain if this commitment to the underserved\nis long-term. Furthermore, previous research has revealed\nthat IMGs are more likely to practise in markets with\nhigher concentrations of established IMG physicians [19].\nIf this trend continues, one may expect IMGs to continue\nto locate in urban versus rural practices.\nThe CTS physician survey did not identify HPSAs or visa\nstatus, so we were unable to assess the relative placement\nof IMGs and USMG family physicians in regard to treating\nthe underserved, or their long-term commitment to serv-\ning these areas. Additionally, the CTS data do not allow us\nto perform a more refined analysis of exactly where in\nurban areas these physicians are located, as other studies\nlooking at IMGs of all specialties have done [7,20].\nMore IMG practices are open to all new Medicaid and\nMedicare patients, and a greater percentage of their\nrevenue is derived from these patients\nThis trend has also been established in comparing IMGs\nand USMGs in psychiatry [21]. The greater service of\nMedicare and Medicaid populations by IMG family physi-\ncians suggests they have a greater dependence on publicly\nfinanced programmes and that they plan an important\nrole in providing access to care for Americans covered by\nthese federal programmes.\nMore IMGs are dissatisfied with their overall medical\ncareers\nPrevious studies have linked career dissatisfaction with a\nperceived inability to provide high-quality care [15].\nAlthough more IMGs in this study are dissatisfied than\nUSMGs, they report no less ability to deliver high-quality\ncare to their patients. Furthermore, more IMGs report hav-\nTable 3: Responses to clinical vignettes of IMG and USMG family physicians\nClinical vignette USMGs N =\nMean (SE)\np value*\nafter 6 months of diet therapy and no other cardiac risk factors (n = 2726)\n% 60 y/o males referred to urology for moderate BPH symptoms without signs of renal\n% 50 y/o males with 1 month history of exertional chest pain referred to Cardiology after an\n% Asymptomatic, male, Caucasian patients > 60 y/o without family history of prostate cancer\nand normal digital rectal exams who are ordered PSA test (n = 2726)\n% 40 y/o monogamous, female patients with 2 days of vaginal itching and thick white\ndischarge without abdominal pain or fever who are required an office visit (n = 2726)\n% 10 y/o males with primary enuresis with negative work-up and failure of water restriction\nand environmental measures who are prescribed DDAVP (n = 2726)\n% 10 y/o males with 2 day history of sore throat and fever who required an office visit (n =\n% 10 y/o females with fever, tachypnea and right-basilar rales who are ordered chest X-rays\n% 24-month-old females with history of 6 resolved episodes of supporative otitis media in\npast year with normal hearing and failure of prophylactic antibiotics who are referred to ENT\n% Full-term, 6-week-old children given sepsis work-up (CBC, sterile urine and blood\n% 4 y/o children with eczema and asthma that is worsening despite inhaled corticosteroids\nwho are referred to an allergist (n = 2726)\n* T-Test\nUSMG = United States Medical Graduate, IMG = International Medical Graduate, SE = Standard Error\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ning adequate time and ability to develop continuing rela-\ntionships with their patients than their USMG colleagues.\nGiven the link between career satisfaction and quality of\ncare, it is important to consider what potentially increas-\ning the percentage of dissatisfied physicians means for the\nfuture of family medicine and the patients they serve.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this study, it is important\nto further examine this difference in order to discern\npotential etiologies and solutions to improve physician\nsatisfaction.\nIn reviewing the clinical vignettes, we noted several situa-\ntions in which IMGs order more tests, refer more patients\nor require more office visits than USMGs. These differ-\nences were statistically significant for half of the vignettes,\nbut it is uncertain whether this reflects appropriate care or\nif the differences were clinically significant. To our knowl-\nedge, no research has been published examining the refer-\nral patterns and service use practices of IMGs and USMG\nphysicians in the United States. This area deserves further\nexamination, as there may be important health care cost\nand utilization effects to consider if differences between\nthe groups do exist.\nAs previously stated, it is important to note that there are\nno significant differences between IMGs and USMGs\nregarding their self-rated ability to deliver high quality\ncare to their patients. A greater percentage of IMGs feel\nthat they have adequate time to spend with their patients\nand that they are able to develop continuing relationships\nwith them.\nThere are several limitations to our study. The cross-sec-\ntional nature of this study precludes our ability to demon-\nstrate causal relationships between variables in addition\nto the potential for selection effects and the inability to\nassess possible maturation effects. Reporting error and\nrecall bias are always potentials when examining survey\ndata. Furthermore, the data in this study are subjective\nreports given by physicians themselves, as opposed to\nobjective practice analyses and clinical outcomes.\nWe are also unable to differentiate between IMGs who\nwere born in the United States and those who were for-\neign-born. Since United States-born IMGs and \"Fifth Path-\nway\" students account for increasing numbers of PGY-1\nfamily practice residents [3], it would be important to\ndetermine whether differences exist between this group\nand their foreign-born counterparts.\nThe linkage of general practitioners with family physicians\nby the CTS may affect some of the results of this paper.\nAlthough we know the participants were self-reported\nfamily physicians or general practitioners, we do not\nknow the primary focus of their practices (traditional\npractice, emergency physician, occupational medicine,\netc.).\nIn addition, the clinical vignettes were designed by the\nCTS and their validity is untested. We include them\nbecause they offer a unique viewpoint into clinical deci-\nsion-making that is often not available in data sources.\nmost recent nationally representative data source that\noversampled primary-care physicians and examined the\nspecific clinical information we needed, including the\nclinical vignettes. Although the CTS has collected physi-\n2001), neither of these data sets include the pertinent clin-\nical information provided in the vignettes of the 1996\u00ad\n1997 data set. In addition, this time frame allows us to\nobtain a snapshot of family practice physicians at the time\nwhen USMG interest in family medicine was peaking and\nthe number of IMGs entering the field was poised to\nincrease, thereby providing a baseline with which to com-\npare more recent studies on this issue.\nIMGs were just 13.4% of the CTS sample \u00ad less than their\npercentage in the overall family medicine workforce. We\ncannot know whether there was a disproportionately\nlower response rate from IMGs or if IMGs were a smaller\nproportion of the workforce within the sampled areas.\nWhile this may affect external validity, we don't anticipate\nthat non-respondent IMGs would be more satisfied, or\nless likely to serve Medicare and Medicaid patients. The\ncharacteristics reported in this study may have changed\nover the past nine years.\nConclusion\nAt a time when family medicine began a new trend of\nbecoming more populated with IMGs, we found impor-\ntant differences between the professional and clinical\nattributes and attitudes of IMG and USMG family physi-\ncians that may affect the health care system. Unlike previ-\nous studies, the practice locations of the IMG family\nphysicians in this study were more urban than those of\ntheir USMG peers. IMG family physicians tend to own\ntheir practices more often, practise in smaller groups and\nbe more open to serving Medicare and Medicaid patients\nthan their United States-trained colleagues. The lower rate\nof board certification among IMG physicians is important\nto consider as more emphasis is being placed on this cre-\ndential. There were small but significant differences in\ncareer satisfaction and referral patterns that are worth\nexploring both to understand whether they continue to be\ntrue, and to understand if they may change the scope and\npractice of family medicine. Given that the United States\nrelies on family physicians to serve a large portion of its\npopulation and the persistent lack of interest in family\nPublish with BioMed Central and every\nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for\ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and publishedimmediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central\nyours -- you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/info/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmedicine by United States medical students, we need to\nfurther understand these differences and how they relate\nto the health care system as a whole.\nCompeting interests\nThis study was funded by the Robert Graham Center.
