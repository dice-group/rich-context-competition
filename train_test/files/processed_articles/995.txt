Higher levels of social capital protected against multiple drinking related harms (adjusted OR 0.51,\np = 0.0003). Significant cross level interactions exist between fraternity/sorority membership and social\ncapital for measures of risky drinking. Harm reduction primarily reflects consumption modification.\nConclusions: Social capital exerts strong protective effects on alcohol abuse and harm in college including\namong high risk students.\nResearchers have identified a host of risk factors for\nproblem drinking among youth1 and are increasingly\nattending to the influence on consumption and harms of\nenvironmental factors related to alcohol's accessibility,\navailability, price, and promotion.2\u00ad4 The emphasis across\nstudies has been on risk rather than protective factors. The\npast decade has been a period of concentrated research\nactivity for studies of drinking in college.5 This may be\nbecause college youth consume more than their non-college\nattending peers,6 experience high levels of alcohol related\nharm,7 and create problems for other students and for\nneighbours.8 9 As with community studies, there is increasing\nevidence that environmental factors influence alcohol con-\nsumption and harms in college,10\u00ad13 with limited attention\npaid to exploring protective factors.\nOne contextual factor that may provide protection from\nhigh risk drinking in college is social capital, which describes\npatterns of engagement, trust, and mutual obligation among\npersons within social structures.14 Variously measured as\npatterns of voluntary activity and associational life within a\ncommunity, levels of generalised social trust, reciprocity and\nhelp among neighbours, and degree of civic engagement (for\nexample, voting behaviours), social capital is hypothesised to\nfacilitate governance and collective action to control\ndeviance, harms and threats, and/or to promote the public\ngood.14 Social capital has been described as operating within\nthe context of social networks and supports at individual\nand even small group levels where the density and\ninterconnectedness of social ties may help individuals\nprocure tangible and intangible resources.15 While powerful,\nthis conceptualisation is predominantly individually based.16\nAlternative models locate social capital at a more macro\ncommunity level, describing its essential qualities as those\nrelated to cohesion, reciprocity, civic engagement, and levels\nconceptualisation of social capital recognises that while there\nmay be links and interrelationships between social networks/\nsupports and these larger social patterns of engagement,\ncohesion, trust, and reciprocity, the former are nested within\nthe latter in an ecological fashion.19\u00ad21 In the case of high risk\ndrinking and harms among youth, it is this larger community\nconception that is hypothesised to promote attachment\namong youth for the larger community and norms counter\nto heavy and harmful alcohol consumption.\nSocial capital may be an important contextual determinant\nof health.22 With regard to alcohol abuse in college, social\ncapital's protective effect on heavy episodic or ``binge''\ndrinking was shown by Weitzman and Kawachi who\nreported that exposure to higher than average levels of social\ncapital at the campus community level (measured as the\nmean aggregate level of individual time spent volunteering\nper day), significantly reduced individual risks of binge\ndrinking in a national study of over 14 000 respondents\nsurveyed across 140 colleges.23 That study is consistent with\nothers' findings that larger aspects of the social environment\nanalogous to social capital are linked to youth mental\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the protective\neffects of social capital on a broader set of alcohol\nconsumption measures including diagnosable levels of\nwww.jech.com\nalcohol abuse, reports of primary and secondhand harms\nrelated to alcohol consumption. A broad protective effect\nwould be consistent with our conceptualisation of social\ncapital that draws on collective socialisation and social\ndevelopment models28 29 to predict that communities rich in\nsocial capital will promote greater attachment among youth\nfor the larger community, norms that heavy drinking and\ndrunkenness are not acceptable, and compliance with laws\nand policies restricting drinking among youth. The net effect\nof these forces is expected to be lower individual risks for\nheavy and abusive drinking and related harms. This study\nalso sought to identify whether any observed reduction in\nharms (primary or secondhand) associated with social capital\nwould be realised as a consequence of reductions in\nconsumption or other individual or contextual factors not\ncaptured in the relation between social capital and consump-\ntion. Finally, this study sought to identify variations in\neffect for students affiliated with campus fraternity and\nsorority (or Greek) organisations at high and low social\ncapital campuses. These organisations were originally\nformed to promote social support and advancement among\nstudents and can include a service component. Nevertheless,\nGreek membership confers considerable risk for heavy\ndrinking and harms and Greek organisations are often at\nthe centre of alcohol abuse problems on campus.30 Exploring\nwhether excess drinking risks among fraternity/sorority\nmembers can be offset by exposure to social capital may\nhelp clarify the magnitude and homogeneity of any protective\neffect.\nMETHODS\nSources of data\nSchool of Public Health College alcohol study (CAS), an\nanonymous self report mailed survey that has been adminis-\ntered four times to a nationally representative sample of\nAmerican college students. It was originally administered in\n1993 to random samples of full time undergraduate students\nat a sample of 140 four year colleges and universities.31\nAfter excluding schools with response rates lower than 50%,\nschools. Detailed survey methodology has been published\nelsewhere.31 32 Protocols for both national surveys on which\nthis research is based were reviewed and approved by the\nHSPH Office of Human Subjects Research.\nOutcome measures\nFour categories of alcohol related outcomes are reported: (1)\nalcohol abuse; (2) alcohol consumption patterns; (3) alcohol\nrelated harms; (4) secondhand effect of others' drinking. To\nmeasure alcohol abuse, we adapted the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u00adfourth edition (DSM-IV)33\nalcohol abuse criteria to the college setting following\npreviously published methods34 in which each of four alcohol\nabuse criteria was matched to self reports of specific drinking\nharms over the past academic year as they affected\nrespondents' primary social role as student (table 1). Next\nwe assessed six measures of alcohol consumption. Among\nstudents who had at least one drink in the past month we\nexamined: drinking on 10 or more occasions during the past\nmonth, usual number of drinks consumed on a drinking\noccasion (five or more compared with fewer than five),\nexperiencing drunkenness three or more times in the past\nmonth, and drinking in order to get drunk. For all students\nwe evaluated binge drinking status, defined as the consump-\ntion of five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past\ntwo weeks for men and four or more drinks in a row for\nwomen.35 We also assessed taking up binge drinking in\ncollege among freshman who reported they were not binge\ndrinkers in high school.12\nExperience of drinking related harms was evaluated since\nthe beginning of the school year, including reports students:\nhad a hangover; missed a class; fell behind in schoolwork;\ndid something they later regretted; forgot where they were\nor what they did; argued with friends; engaged in\nunplanned sexual activity; did not use protection when\nhaving sex; damaged property; got into trouble with campus\nor local police; got hurt or injured; required medical\ntreatment for an alcohol overdose. A composite variable\nwas also created describing experience of five or more of the\nabove mentioned harms as an indication of the intensity of\nharms from drinking in this population consistent with other\nAmong non-binge drinkers we assessed experience since\nthe beginning of the school year of eight adverse effects\nattributable to others' drinking including reports students:\nwere insulted or humiliated; had a serious argument or\nquarrel; had been pushed, hit, or assaulted; had their\nproperty damaged; had to ``babysit'' or take care of another\nstudent who drank too much; had their studying or sleep\ninterrupted; experienced an unwanted sexual advance; or,\nhad been a victim of sexual assault or date rape. A composite\nvariable describing experiencing of three or more of the above\nmentioned secondhand effects of others' drinking was also\nexamined. Use of a three or more secondhand effects\nmeasure provides an indication of the intensity of community\nharms from others' drinking in this population consistent\nwith other studies.37\nIndependent variables\nSocial capital was operationalised as a continuous variable\nassessing particapants' average daily time committed to\nvolunteering in the past 30 days aggregated to the campus\nlevel. The time spent in volunteerism at the school level\nreflects a core feature of the social capital construct--its\n``public good'' element, and shows the students' dedication to\nthe group or collective.16 23 Within the college population in\nwhich time may be tight and youth may exhibit both their\nidealism and norms about reciprocity and engagement\nthrough volunteerism, the mean aggregate levels of voluntary\nbehaviour at the community level may be a meaningful\nindicator of social capital on a campus. We used a\nparsimonious contextual measure created from this single\nvariable to describe social capital. Other related variables\ndescribing participation in student groups and political\norganisations did not improve the reliability of the estimate\nof social capital when composited with the variable on\nvoluntary behaviour and measured contextually. Individual\nvolunteerism (h/day) was included as a control variable. Also\nincluded in the models were individual level covariates that\nTable 1 DSM-IV alcohol abuse criteria from 1997 and\nDSM-IV criteria CAS measure of harm\nFailure to fulfill important social role Missed class and\nFell behind in school work\nUse alcohol despite physically\nhazardous context\nAlcohol related injury or\nAlcohol related overdose or\nDrive and heavy episodic drink\nLegal problems associated with\nalcohol use\nDamaged property or\nTrouble with police\nContinued use despite persistent\nsocial or interpersonal problems\nArgued with friends or\nDid something later regretted\nwww.jech.com\nmay affect volunteerism or alcohol use such as age, sex, race\n(white compared with non-white), socioeconomic status\n(SES) (operationalised as parental educational attain-\nment--high: both parents had college education, middle:\neither father or mother had college education, low: neither\nparents went to college), and fraternity or sorority member-\nship.

All the analyses\nwere fitted using MLwin multilevel software (version\nestimation procedures being applied. We first present the\nbasic demographic characteristics. Then, a two level random\nintercept model with individual students at level 1, nested\nwithin colleges at level 2 was fit to assess the effect of school\nsocial capital on dichotomised alcohol related outcomes\ncontrolling for individual and school level covariates.\nEffects of social capital on drinking related harms and\nsecondhand effects were estimated before and after control-\nling for patterns of consumption at individual and college\nlevels respectively to assess the degree to which any\nprotective effects of social capital on harms operated\nindependently of consumption.\nTo test whether social capital modified the risk of alcohol\nabuse among Greek affiliated students, we tested the cross\nlevel interaction between Greek membership and campus\nsocial capital on study outcomes, controlling for all relevant\nindividual and college covariates and for the main effects of\nindividual volunteering and Greek membership.

Considerable variation at the college level was\nevident across measures of drinking style. Across the 119\nsurveyed colleges, we observed the average prevalence, range,\nand standard deviation of alcohol abuse, frequent drinking,\nfrequent drunkenness, and binge drinking to be respectively:\nOverall, women, non-white students, older aged (.23\nyears), or students from lower socioeconomic status back-\ngrounds were less likely to use/abuse alcohol, report drinking\nrelated harms, or experience secondhand effects; while\nfraternity/sorority or Greek membership were associated with\nhigher odds of drinking problems, alcohol related harms, or\nsecondhand effects (table 2). Students who spent more time\non volunteer work were less likely to use or abuse alcohol, or\nreport drinking related harms. However, they were more\nlikely to experience secondhand effects of other students'\ndrinking. Students attending schools with high levels of\nsocial capital were less likely to report heavy and abusive\ndrinking, drinking related harms, and secondhand effects.\nProtective effects of social capital on alcohol abuse, acquisi-\ntion, or uptake of binge drinking, frequent and intentional\ndrunkenness persisted after controlling for a range of\nindividual and contextual characteristics and for individual\ntime volunteering (table 3). For example, each one hour\nincrease in aggregated levels of campus volunteerism\ncorresponded to a 45% decrease in the probability of having\nan alcohol abuse disorder among college students (adjusted\nafter adjustment for age, sex, race, SES, students' member-\nship, and school characteristics. Based on this, a one quarter\nhour increase in aggregated levels of campus volunteerism\nwould decrease college students' alcohol abuse by more than\nSignificant cross levels interactions exist between social\ncapital and Greek membership for four alcohol related\noutcomes--binge drinking, frequent binge drinking, inten-\ntional, and frequent drunkenness. Increased risk for these\noutcomes among Greek affiliated students was reduced to\nthat of their non-Greek peers when levels of school social\ncapital were high (fig 1). There were no interactions between\nGreek membership and individual volunteering for these or\nother drinking outcomes.\nHigher levels of school social capital were associated with\ndecreased probabilities of several drinking related harms\n(table 4). For each one hour increase in aggregate school level\nvolunteerism we would expect a 49% decrease in reporting\nharms associated with alcohol use (OR = 0.51, 95% con-\nquarter hour increase in aggregated levels of campus\nvolunteerism would decrease college students' alcohol related\nharm more than 12%. Protective effects on drinking related\nharms were attenuated by controlling for measures of\ndrinking style (second set of data columns, table 4) showing\nthat social capital's protective effect on harms operates\nmainly through modifying consumption.\nAfter controlling for individual and school characteristics,\nstudents attending colleges with higher levels of social capital\nwere also less likely to suffer from the consequences of other\nstudents' drinking problems (table 4). Each one hour\nincrease in campus social capital was associated with a 70%\nreduced probability of suffering from secondary harms of\nother students drinking (OR = 0.30, 95% confidence inter-\nmore than a 17% decrease in alcohol related secondhand\neffects among non-bingers if campus levels volunteerism\nincreased by one quarter hour. Diminution of secondhand\neffects after controlling for drinking style (second set of data\ncolumns, table 4) suggests that social capital's protective\neffect operates mainly through consumption.\nDISCUSSION\nStudents from colleges with higher levels of social capital\nreported reduced risks for binge drinking, frequent and\nintentional drunkenness, the acquisition or uptake of binge\ndrinking in college, and patterns of alcohol abuse indicative\nof a more serious psychiatric problem in multilevel analyses\nthat take into consideration the effects of demographic, social\nnetwork, affiliative, and institutional characteristics, and that\nsimultaneously control for individual patterns of voluntary\nactivity, the measure on which social capital was based.\nFindings are consistent with earlier reports23 and with our\nhypothesis about the role of social capital in protecting\nagainst deviance and threat, as shown by more problematic\ndrinking styles. Exposure to higher levels of social capital was\nalso associated with lower odds of experiencing a range of\ndrinking related harms, multiple harms, secondhand effects\nfrom others' drinking, and multiple secondhand effects. The\nprotective effects of social capital on outcomes operated\nmainly through moderating consumption as evidenced by\nattenuated effects of social capital on harms after controlling\nfor consumption (table 4).\nIncreased risks for heavy and frequent drinking, inten-\ntional and frequent drunkenness among Greek affiliated\nstudents was almost fully offset by exposure to high levels of\nsocial capital at the campus community level (fig 1). This\neffect was evident after controlling for individual voluntary\nactivity, for which there was no parallel interaction with\nGreek affiliation.\nFindings answer questions about the consistency of social\ncapital's risk modifying effect on consumption by examining\nits effects across a range of drinking measures. They also\nshow social capital's protective effect on harms. Questions\nabout underlying mechanisms remain. We do not yet\nunderstand why social capital depresses drinking and we\nknow nothing about whether it can be generated, supported,\nor harnessed to intentionally aid prevention. Future work\nKey points\nN Among a nationally representative sample of young\nadults in college in the United States, exposure to high\ncontextual levels of social capital was associated with\nsignificantly lower individual risk for measures of abuse\nand DSM-IV abuse of alcohol, drinking related harms,\nand secondhand effects from others' drinking.\nN Additionally, increased odds for alcohol abuse among\nhigh risk fraternity/sorority affiliated students was\nsignificantly offset by exposure to social capital rich\ncommunities.\nN The protective effect of social capital on drinking harms\nand secondhand effects was attributable almost entirely\nto its moderating effects on consumption. Social capital\nrich communities in which many youth volunteer\nprotect against alcohol abuse and harms, among the\nmost common and serious health issues facing young\npopulations.\nRisk modifying effects of social capital on alcohol consumption and harms 307\nwww.jech.com\nmight well address the interrelation of social capital with\nother factors including alcohol policies and prevention\nprogrammes and with academic and social requirements for\nvolunteering and community service, and explore protective\neffects for other subgroups of youth.30 Additional work might\nalso use operational definitions of social capital that tap\ndifferent components of the construct.\nFindings that risk associated with fraternity/sorority\nassociation can be offset by exposure to high levels of social\ncapital emphasise the power of this construct and importance\nof considering individual and environmental interactions.\nThese findings and the ongoing debate about social capital's\npotential to exclude, ``bond'', or ``bridge'' groups15 40 suggest\nexamining effects among lesser status groups, including\nracial and ethnic minority students. We think that higher\nlevels of social capital in college communities signal more\negalitarian and therefore healthier places where psychologi-\ncal needs for drinking are fewer, as findings about social\ncapital's protective effects on intentional drunkenness\nsuggest. Findings about the protective effects of campus\ndemographic diversity on drinking and harms among both\nmajority and minority students in college support the\npotential for this more positive interpretation.41\nConfidence in this study's findings is increased given our\nlarge representative survey sample, multiple measures of\nalcohol consumption and harm, and use of an established if\nsingle indicator of social capital. Nevertheless, we cannot\ngeneralise results beyond four year US colleges. Potential bias\nmay have been introduced through non-response and\nattrition. A short form of the questionnaire sent to non-\nresponders indicated no difference in past year alcohol use\nbetween responders to the short form and those responding\nto the entire survey.32 Moreover, we minimised threats from\nselection bias through use of a direct standardisation\nprocedure for all study measures that reflected adjustment\nalong eight strata (gender by two age groups (,22 compared\nwith others) by two ethnic groups (white compared with\nothers)), using each school's true demographic characteristic\nin a referent year. Furthermore, we controlled for response\nrate in the analyses and restricted analyses to colleges with\nresponse rates of 50% or greater. The response rate for\nindividual schools was not associated with rates of heavy\nepisodic drinking.32 Rates of heavy episodic drinking and\nother substance use were almost identical to rates obtained\nby other US surveys.6 42 Results were based on self report\nmailed questionnaires, which are subject to response\nbias. However, self report surveys are commonly used in\nexamining alcohol use and are generally considered valid.43\nFinally, the cross sectional design limits conclusions regard-\ning directionality of associations.\n"
