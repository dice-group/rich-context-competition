Kefir culture from other parts of the world\nexhibits numerous beneficial qualities such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, and anticancer effects. Nevertheless,\nkefir cultures from different parts of the world exert different effects because of variation in culture conditions and media.\nBreast cancer is the leading cancer in women, and metastasis is the major cause of death associated with breast cancer.\nThe antimetastatic and antiangiogenic effects of kefir water made from kefir grains cultured in Malaysia were studied in 4T1\nbreast cancer cells. Methods. 4T1 cancer cells were treated with kefir water in vitro to assess its antimigration and anti-\ninvasion effects. BALB/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and treated orally with kefir water for 28 days. Results.\nKefir water was cytotoxic toward 4T1 cells at IC\nand 72 hours, respectively. A significant reduction in tumor size and weight (0.9132 \u00b1 0.219 g) and a substantial increase\nin helper T cells (5-fold) and cytotoxic T cells (7-fold) were observed in the kefir water\u00adtreated group. Proinflammatory\nand proangiogenic markers were significantly reduced in the kefir water\u00adtreated group. Conclusions. Kefir water inhibited\ntumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo mainly through cancer cell apoptosis, immunomodulation by stimulating T helper\ncells and cytotoxic T cells, and anti-inflammatory, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenesis effects.

In the United States, breast cancer is the most com-\nmon type of cancer for women.1 In addition, the majority of\nbreast cancer deaths are mainly because of cancer metasta-\nsis to other parts of the body.2 For years, research into a cure\nfor cancer has been ongoing, and inhibition of the meta-\nstatic cascade is one of the goals. The association of func-\ntional foods, such as probiotics, with cancer therapy has\nbecome an emerging field of study. Although the use of pro-\nbiotics as a therapeutic agent is most common in colon-\nrelated diseases3,4 because the bacteria can interact directly\nwith the colon after consumption, probiotics also demon-\nstrate antitumor properties in breast cancer cells.5\nKefir was introduced more than a thousand years ago in\nthe Caucasus Mountains in Central Asia. It is a traditional\nbeverage made from the fermentation of kefir grains with\nmilk or water.6 Kefir grains contain various kinds of micro-\nbial flora, including the most commonly studied species\nwith probiotic potential such as Lactobacillus acidophilus,\nLactobacillus casei, and Lactococcus lactis subsp Lactis.7,8\nBecause these species have numerous different strains, not\n1Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nNoorjahan Banu Alitheen, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology,\nFaculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science, Universiti Putra\nEmail: noorjahan@upm.edu.my\nThe Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenesis\nEffects of Kefir Water on Murine Breast\nCancer Cells\nNur Rizi Zamberi, Bsc1, Nadiah Abu, PhD1, Nurul Elyani Mohamed, Bsc1,\nNoraini Nordin, Bsc1, Yeap Swee Keong, PhD1, Boon Kee Beh, Bsc1,\nZuki Abu Bakar Zakaria, PhD1, Nik Mohd Afizan Nik Abdul Rahman, PhD1,\nand Noorjahan Banu Alitheen, PhD1\n Keywords\nkefir, kefir water, breast cancer, 4T1 cell, antimetastasis, antiangiogenesis, immunomodulatory\nevery single strain has the potential to be probiotic. This\nimportant characteristic makes kefir suitable as a probiotic\nbeverage. Probiotics refer to live microorganisms, which\nwhen administered in adequate amounts, confer a health ben-\nefit on the host.9 Kefir has been consumed extensively for\nyears because it is believed to promote good health. This\nclaim was verified by recent studies, which showed that kefir\ncan aid in alleviating lactose intolerance,10 inflammation,11,12\nand high total cholesterol13,14 as well as exhibiting immuno-\nmodulation properties.15 It has also been reported that kefir\nhas the ability to induce cytotoxicity and reduce cancer\nFurthermore, studies by de Moreno de LeBlanc etal5,17\non the administration of commercial milk kefir from Canada\nin a breast cancer murine model determined that it can slow\ndown cancer by elevating local immune response and\nselected cytokines. Nevertheless, an in-depth study is\nneeded on the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of kefir\nin a murine breast cancer model. Thus, this study focused\non the antimetastatic effects of kefir water made from kefir\ngrains grown in Malaysia on 4T1 cells in in vitro and in\nvivo murine models.\nMaterial and Methods\nSample Preparation\nKefir grain was obtained from a local store in Kuala Lumpur\n(http://mykefirworld.com/); 200 mg of kefir grain was\nadded into a glass vessel containing brown sugar (200 g)\ndissolved in 1.5 L of mineral water. The fermentation was\nperformed for 24 hours at room temperature. After that, the\ngrain was filtered out from the fermented medium, and the\nkefir water was freeze dried. Dried kefir water was diluted\nin phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 500 mg/mL) and stored\nat 4\u00b0C until used.\nAnimal and Experimental Groups\nwere obtained from the Animal House of Univesiti Putra\nMalaysia, Serdang (UPM, Malaysia). The mice were sepa-\nrated into 3 groups (n = 7 for each group): (1) normal group;\n(2) untreated tumor group, in which mice were fed orally\nwith distilled water; and (3) kefir water\u00adtreated group, in\nwhich mice with tumor were fed orally with kefir water (150\nmg/kg body weight per day). Kefir dosage was determined\nbased on previous studies.16,18,19 All mice in the tumor group\ntreatment was administered orally with samples on the same\nday of tumor inoculation for 28 days. The mice were main-\ntained under standard animal house conditions, with a regu-\nlar 12-hour dark-light cycle at 25\u00b0C. Water and standard diet\npellet were provided ad libitum. All the experiments using\nanimals were performed under the ethical guidelines set by\nUniversiti Putra Malaysia for the care of lab animals (UPM/\nThe terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferased UTP nick end-\nlabeling (TUNEL) DNA fragmentation assay was carried\nout according to the user's guidelines in DeadEnd colori-\nmetric TUNEL assay protocol (Promega, USA). Briefly,\ntumor tissue sections from untreated and kefir water\u00adtreated\ngroups on microscope slides were deparaffinized in xylene\nfor 5 minutes. Then, the slides were immersed in sequential\nwere immersed in PBS (pH 7.0) before they were fixed in\n4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. The slides were\nwashed with PBS, and the tissues were permeabilized with\nthe provided proteinase K. The fixing steps were repeated\nbefore the tissues were equilibrated using an equilibrium\nbuffer. Then, the tissue sections were labeled with terminal\ndeoxynucleotidyl transferase and blocked in hydrogen per-\noxide. The slides were incubated in streptavidin-horserad-\nish peroxidase (HRP) and developed using 3,\n3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. Finally, the slides\nwere mounted and viewed under bright field microscopy\n(Motic, Hong Kong), and the apoptotic cells were counted\nfrom 5 different fields in every tumor slide (n = 7 per group).\nHematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining\nThe tumor tissues from untreated and kefir water\u00adtreated\ngroups were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in\nparaffin, and sectioned. The sections were stained with\nhematoxylin and eosin and viewed under bright field\nmicroscopy (Motic, Hong Kong) for mitotic cell identifica-\ntions. The mitotic cells were counted from 5 different fields\nin every tumor slide (n = 7 per group).\nNitric Oxide Assay\nNO in tumor samples from untreated and kefir water\u00ad\ntreated groups was measured according to the user's guide-\nlines in the Griess reagent kit (Sigma, USA). Tumors were\nmeshed using a plunger and a 70-\u00b5m cell strainer in PBS.\nThe supernatants were collected and mixed with the pro-\nvided Griess Reagent and deionized water. After the sample\nmixtures were incubated for 30 minutes, the absorbance\nwas measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek\nInstruments, Winooska, VT) at 548 nm.\nMalondialdehyde (MDA) Assay\nThe level of lipid peroxidation in tumor samples from\nuntreated and kefir water\u00adtreated groups was measured\nusing the MDA assay by thiobarbituric acid reaction,\naccording to Ohkawa etal.20 Tumors were meshed using a\n70-\u00b5m cell strainer in PBS. The supernatants were collected\nand mixed with butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma, USA)\nand 2,4,6-trichloroanisole before they were vortexed and\nkept on ice for 2 hours. Afterward, the mixtures were centri-\nfuged, and the supernatants were mixed with thiobarbituric\nacid and boiled for 15 minutes. The absorbance of the mix-\ntures was measured at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer\n(Beckman Coulter, USA). Tetramethoxypropan (Sigma,\nUSA) was used as standard.\nSerum Cytokine Detection of Interleukin 2 (IL-\nBlood serum was collected from normal, untreated, and\nkefir water\u00adtreated groups and subjected to cytokine detec-\ntion using a Duoset ELISA assay kit (R&D Systems, USA;\nguidelines. The assay plate was coated with capture anti-\nbody overnight. The plate was washed with PBS 0.5%\nTween 20 and incubated with block buffer followed by\nserum samples for 2 hours. Next, the plate was washed\nagain and incubated with detection antibody for 2 hours.\nStreptavidin-HRP was added to the plate for 20 minutes\nafter the plate was washed. Then, the plate was incubated\nwith substrate solution for 20 minutes and the reaction was\nended with the addition of stop solution. The absorbance\nwas measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek\nInstruments, Winooska, VT) at 450 nm.\nImmunophenotyping\nImmunophenotyping of spleen CD3, CD4, and CD8 were\ndone based on Yeap etal.21 Briefly, the harvested spleens\nfrom normal, untreated, and kefir water\u00adtreated groups\nwere meshed, and red blood cells were lysed using lysis\nbuffer (8 g NH\nCl, 1 g Na\nPO\nThe cells were washed with PBS and stained with the CD3,\nCD4, and CD8 antibodies (Abcam, USA; Catalog No:\nthen washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for a week, and\nrun through a FACS-Calibur flow cytometry system (BD,\nLung Clonogenic Assay\nClonogenic assay was performed to determine the number\nof metastatic 4T1 cells in the lung.22 The harvested lungs\nfrom untreated and kefir water\u00adtreated groups were washed\nwith PBS, minced into small pieces, and subjected to diges-\ntion in 2 mg/mL collagenase type IV for 1 hour in a 37\u00b0C\nwater bath. The digested lungs were meshed and filtered\nthrough 70-\u00b5m strainers using syringe plungers. Then, the\ndigested lungs were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes\nand washed twice with PBS. The cell pellets were resus-\npended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI)\ncontaining 60-\u00b5m 6-thioguanine for clonogenic growth.\nThe suspensions were serially diluted in 6-well plates. After\n10 days, the clonogenic cells were fixed in methanol and\nstained with 0.5% crystal violet. Clonogenic cells were\ncounted for each group.\nBone Marrow Smearing\nFemurs from untreated and kefir water\u00adtreated mice were\nharvested; the bone marrows were located and washed out\nwith PBS. The bone marrow solution was dropped onto\nclean glass slides and smeared across the slide. After the\nslides dried, they were fixed in methanol for 30 minutes and\nstained with Giemsa for 2 hours. The slides were viewed\nunder an inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan).\nQuantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain\nReaction (qPCR)\nTumors from untreated and kefir water\u00adtreated groups were\nsnap frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground using a mortar\nand pestle. Total RNA was extracted from the ground sam-\nples using the Qiagen RNEasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany).\nThe RNA (1 \u00b5g) obtained was converted into cDNA using\nMaxima First Strand cDNAsynthesis kit (Thermo Scientific,\nUSA) and loaded into a thermal cycler (Labnet, USA). The\ncDNAwas subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction\nusing SYBR Select Master Mix (Life Technologies, USA)\nin Eco Illumina (Illumina, USA) to quantify gene expres-\nsion of the selected genes described in Table 1. The primers\nwere obtained from Primer-Blast NCBI (http://www.ncbi.\nnlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) and Primer Bank (http://\npga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/). GAPDH and ACTB\nwere used as housekeeping genes. The expressions were\nanalyzed using Eco Study (Illumina, USA).\nProteome Profiler Angiogenesis Antibody Array\nThe detection of multiple cytokines in protein samples was\ndone using the Mouse Angiogenesis Antibody Array kit\n(Ray Biotech, USA). The proteins from tumors harvested\nfrom untreated and kefir water\u00adtreated groups were\nextracted from ground samples using QIAShredder (Qiagen,\nGermany) and RIPA-Protease Inhibitor buffer (50 mM Tris-\nsodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, Protease inhibitor [Roche,\nUSA]). Then, the protein samples were subjected to the pro-\ntein array per the user's guidelines. In brief, the provided\nglass chip was blocked using blocking buffer for 30 min-\nutes, and samples were incubated in the chip overnight at\n4\u00b0C. After 24 hours, the chip was washed 3 times with\nselected wash buffer. The chip was then incubated with\nbiotin-conjugated anticytokine reagent for 2 hours and with\nstreptavidin-fluor for 2 more hours. The chip was washed\ntwice with selected wash buffer and distilled water. The\nchip was allowed to dry and scanned using the Axon Gene\nPix 4000B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and the\nvalues were extracted using the Axon Gene Pix Pro 6.1\n(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale) software. The data were\nthen analyzed based on calculations provided in the user's\nguidelines.\nStatistical Analysis\nUnless stated otherwise, the results were expressed as the\nmeans and SDs of all mice for each group (n = 7 for each\ngroup). Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined\nusing Student's t-tests and performed using GraphPad\nPrism (version 6.0) against the untreated group.\nResults\nKefir Water Induced Cell Cytotoxicity and\nPositively Suppressed Cell Migration and\nInvasion In Vitro\nMTT assay was performed on 4T1 cells to evaluate the cyto-\ntoxicity of the kefir water at the highest dosage of 50 mg/mL.\nThe half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC\n) values were\ndetermined and selected for further bioassays. The IC\nvalues\nrespectively. The migration and invasion ability of 4T1 cells\nwere challenged with the exposure to 3 concentrations of kefir\nmembrane. The number of migrating cells was significantly\ndecreased in the treatment groups as compared with the\nuntreated group (supplementary data, available at http://ict.\nsagepub.com/supplemental). The percentage of migrating\nmg/mL kefir water. The same pattern can be observed in the\ninvasion assay, where the invaded cells were reduced in num-\nber when exposed to higher concentration of kefir water, with\nmL. Hence, it can be concluded that the rate of 4T1 cell migra-\ntion and invasion was dose dependent, whereby as the con-\ncentration of kefir water increased, the rate decreased. In the\nwound healing assay, a significant reduction in wound healing\nin comparison to untreated cells was observed at 3 concentra-\nhours (supplementary data, available at http://ict.sagepub.\ncom/supplemental). The wound closures between the 3 con-\ncentrations were distinguishable only at 24 hours, where the\nascending concentrations.\nKefir Water Obstructed Ex Vivo Angiogenesis in\nMouse Aortic Ring\nSections of mouse aortic rings were embedded in Matrigel and\nexposed to 12.5 mg/mLof kefir water for 10 days to allow ves-\nsels to grow. The formation of microvessels sprouting from the\naortas was observed and counted in every well. As compared\nTable 1.

Tumor size in kefir water\u00ad\ntreated mice was smaller than that in untreated mice. The\ntumor weight and volume were also reduced significantly\nmice as compared with the untreated mice (Figure 1).\nKefir Water Inhibited Cell Mitosis and Enhanced\nTumor Apoptosis in Mice\nTumor sections were paraffin embedded on glass slides and\nsubjected to H&E staining and TUNEL assay. The histology\nanalysis of untreated tumor sections displayed a greater\nnumber of differentiated cancer cells (Figure 2A). Black\ncircles in Figure 2Aindicate mitotic cells that underwent cell\ndivision. Apoptosis of cancer cells in tumor was observed in\nthe TUNEL assay. A higher number of apoptotic cancer cells\nwere observed in the kefir water\u00adtreated tumor section as\ncompared with the untreated section (Figure 2B).\nKefir Water Decreased Metastasis to Lung and\nBone Marrow\nThe antimetastatic effects of kefir water on tumor were fur-\nther analyzed in a clonogenic assay and bone marrow\u00ad\nsmearing assay. In the clonogenic assay, 6-thioguanine is a\nselective medium to grow 4T1 cells. The metastatic poten-\ntial of 4T1 cells to the lung was observed after 10 days. The\nnumber of 4T1 cells metastasized in the lung of kefir water\u00ad\ntreated mice was significantly lower than in untreated mice,\nas shown in Figure 3A. In the bone marrow\u00adsmearing assay,\nmetastatic cells were identified by the presence of large and\nabnormal cells. Based on Figure 3B, metastatic 4T1 cells\nwere only observed in the untreated group.\nKefir Water\u00adControlled Cytokine Expressions in\nSerum\nThe expression levels of cytokines involved in angiogenesis\nand inflammation were measured using blood serum. The lev-\nels of tumor pro-growth-related cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1)\nFigure 1. Tumor size, weight (g) and volume (cm3), obtained from 4T1 cell-challenged mice.

Significant difference (*P < .05)\nfrom the untreated group was calculated using the t-test.\nKefir Water Enhanced Immune Response in Spleen\nThe population of selected immune markers (T-helper CD4+/\nCD3+) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+/CD3+) was calculated\nbased on immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. As shown\nin Figure 5, the population of T-helper CD4 cells in the kefir\nwater\u00adtreated group as compared with the untreated group\nwas significantly higher, by 5-fold. The same pattern was\nobserved in the population of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, where it\nwas increased by 7-fold. In addition, the population of the\nimmune cells between the normal group and the kefir water\u00ad\ntreated group showed no statistical difference.\nKefir Water Decreased Lipid Peroxidation and\nNO Levels in Tumor\nThe levels of lipid peroxidation of MDA and NO in tumor\nsupernatant were determined, and reductions were seen in both\nassays (Figure 6). Kefir water had decreased the levels of both\ninflammation-related chemicals in the tumors by about 3-fold.\nKefir Water Reduced the Expression of\nInflammation and Metastatic-Related Genes and\nProteins In Vivo\nThe mRNA expressions of ICAM, iNOS, MMP-9, IL-1,\nNF-B, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF- genes were\ndownregulated in the kefir water\u00adtreated group as com-\npared with the untreated group (Figure 7A). A significant\ndownregulation of iNOS and IL-1 by 3-fold were observed\nin the kefir water\u00adtreated group. In the angiogenesis pro-\nteome profiler assay, the levels of selected proangiogenesis\nproteins were downregulated and that of antiangiogenesis\nproteins were upregulated in the kefir water\u00adtreated group\n(Figure 7B).\nDiscussion\nExtensive research has been done to tackle breast cancer pro-\ngression, but complete understanding is still a long way off.\nDiet is one of the factors that leads to cancer development,\nFigure 3.

(B) Bone marrow smear for untreated and kefir water\u00adtreated group at 200\u00d7 and 400\u00d7\nmagnification.\nand the association between diet and cancer is currently being\ninvestigated. Scientists have found that the occurrence of\ntumors in animals can be manipulated by their diet intake.23\nA study on milk kefir provides an insight into its antiprolif-\nerative effects on breast cancer cells in vitro.24 Although kefir\nhas been commercialized in some places in the world, the\nmechanism of action behind the anticancer claim of kefir,\nespecially kefir water, is still underresearched. Therefore, this\nstudy was carried out to further investigate the anti-metasta-\nsis and antiangiogenesis potential of kefir from Malaysia in\ntriple negative 4T1 murine breast cancer cells. Triple nega-\ntive breast cancer (TNBC) is known to have poor prognosis\nand highly metastasis compared to other breast cancer types.\nWomen with TNBC developed a significantly higher visceral\nmetastasis as the first site of distant recurrence than women\nwith other breast cancer types.25 Other than that, the develop-\nment of brain metastases is higher in the triple-negative phe-\nnotype compared with other types of breast cancer.26\nKefir water showed cytotoxicity toward 4T1 cells in the\nMTT assay, and the IC\nobtained was used in subsequent in\nvitro migration assays. The significant reduction in cell\nmigration and invasion in kefir water\u00adtreated cells in vitro\ndemonstrated the potency of kefir water as an antimetasta-\nsis agent. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood ves-\nsels from existing vessels, and it has an important role in\nwound healing and development of tumors.27 This feature is\nstimulated by proangiogenic factors, which are essential for\ntumor metastasis.28 The ability of kefir water to inhibit\nangiogenesis was shown in the ex vivo mouse aortic ring\nassay, where lower microvessel growth was significantly\nobserved in treated aortas (supplementary data, available at\nhttp://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental).\nThe effectiveness of kefir water in the inhibition of\nbreast cancer metastasis was further tested in an in vivo\nmodel using BALB/c mice. After 28 days of treatment, the\nsize and weight of tumors in the kefir water\u00adtreated mice\nwere reduced significantly. Normal cell growth and prolif-\neration are regulated within the cell cycle. Cancer cells\ndivide rapidly because they deregulate the cell cycle signal\nand, thus, proliferate at their own pace.28 Dividing cells in\ntumor sections were analyzed using H&E staining, and as\ncan be seen in Figure 2A, the number of dividing cells was\nreduced in the kefir water\u00adtreated tumor section. TUNEL\nassay was performed on tumor tissue sections to detect\nDNA damage. An increase in DNA fragmentation was\nobserved in kefir water\u00adtreated tumor sections in the\nTUNEL assay. DNA fragmentation is one of the indicators\nfor cell apoptosis.29 Therefore, the increase in DNA frag-\nmentation indicated that the tumor cells were undergoing\napoptosis.\nThe correlation between inflammation and cancer pro-\ngression has been discussed for centuries. The chronic\ninflammatory conditions that correlate with infection and\nirritation may prompt genomic lesions and tumor initiation.30\nReports have found that breast cancer patients exhibit ele-\nvated lipid peroxidation marker, MDA,31 and inflammatory\nmediator, NO.32 In this study, kefir water successfully\nreduced the levels of MDA and NO in kefir water\u00adtreated\nFigure 4. The results from cytokine (IL-10, IFN-, IL-1, IL-2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay on blood serum\nfrom the untreated cancer group and kefir water\u00adtreated cancer group.

Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD. Significant\ndifference (*P < .05) from the untreated group was determined using the t-test.\nmice. The decrease in NO was associated with significant\ndownregulation of iNOS in the kefir water\u00adtreated group\n(Figure 7A). The overexpression of iNOS is highly corre-\nlated with tumor progression and angiogenesis ability.33\nThe activation of NF-, which follows infectious agents or\ncytokines such as TNF-, regulates the inflammatory\nresponse of iNOS and also ICAM-1, an adhesion molecule\nclosely related to metastasis.34,35 Therefore, the reduction of\nthese proinflammatory genes will help in providing a micro-\nenvironment that disfavors tumor growth.\nThe suppression of IL-2 and IFN-, which were gener-\nated by T-helper 1, are common in the case of chronic infec-\ntious diseases.35 The effects of kefir water in the regulation\nof IL-2 and IFN- cytokines were also analyzed, and the\nkefir water\u00adtreated group showed increments in both cyto-\nkines. IL-2 is a product of activated CD4+ T cells and CD8+\nT cells.36 Furthermore, IFN- is known to increase the pro-\nduction of major histocompatibility complex and obstructs\ntumor angiogenesis.35 This antitumor immunity stimulation\nwas validated by the in immunophenotyping assay, where\nnotably increased numbers of immune markers (CD4+/\nCD3+, CD8+/CD3+) were observed in the kefir water\u00ad\ntreated group (Figure 5). In fact, kefir has also been reported\nto exert immunomodulating effects, when IgA+ and IgG+\nwere increased in the healthy treatment group.37 Both CD4\nhelper T cells and CD8 cytotoxic T cells are highly impor-\ntant in immune response and producing antitumor response.38\nThe inability of the immune system to eradicate tumors was\nmainly a result of the immunosuppressive environment pro-\nduced by the developing tumor. The tumor suppressed both\nT cell populations in the untreated group as compared with\nthe normal group and kefir water\u00adtreated group (Figure 5).\nHowever, this observation was dissimilar to that in a previ-\nkines that are formed in a COX-2 expressing environment,\nand these cytokines are able to obstruct the production of\nTh-1 cytokines by CD4+ T helper lymphocytes.35 Astudy by\nSharma etal39 on the Lewis lung tumors in mice suggested\nthat the overexpression of IL-10 decreased the cytolytic\nactivity of CD8+. A similar outcome was observed in a\nstudy by Jarnicki etal40 in which a corresponding increase\nin IL-10 diminished cytotoxic T cell responses and IFN-\nsecreting T cells during tumor growth. An increase of IL-10\nexpression and reduction in the CD8+ population were\nobserved in the untreated group when compared with the\nkefir water\u00adtreated group.\nThe role of kefir water as an antiangiogenic agent in\nbreast cancer was further investigated through the expres-\nsion of several angiogenesis-related cytokines, genes, and\nproteins. For tumor growth to obtain the capability to acti-\nvate angiogenesis, it requires an angiogenic switch.41 The\nangiogenic factors of IL-1 that encourage tumor invasive-\nness were observed in various experimental models.42,43 In\nthe cytokine and gene expression assay, kefir water signifi-\ncantly reduced the level of IL-1 in the tumor environment.\nFurthermore, kefir water also inhibited the level of IL-10\ncytokine, which is associated with poor prognosis.44\nGrowth factors cause tumors to develop and migrate.\nSome important hematopoietic growth factors studied in\nthis experiment included vascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),\nand granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor\n(GM-CSF). The expression of VEGF is an essential media-\ntor for angiogenesis, and it is abundant in many types of\ncancer malignancies, especially in breast cancer.45,46 In\naddition, the activation of VEGF promotes the growth of\nendothelial cells and migration.47 G-CSF was identified as a\nmacrophage regulator to promote proliferation, differentia-\ntion, and survival.48 However, G-CSF along with GM-CSF\ncan also act as proto-oncogenes, in which they are highly\nexpressed in various tumors49-51 and also frequently found\nin invasive breast cancer cells.52 They were also found in\nabundance in the cytokine profile of metastatic 4T1\nFigure 6.

Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD. Significant difference\n(*P < .05) from the untreated group was determined using the\nt-test.\ntumors.53 The levels of VEGF, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were\nsignificantly downregulated in the kefir water\u00adtreated\ngroup proteome profiler as compared with the untreated\ngroup. In addition, kefir water reduced the expression level\nof eotaxin, which is a member of the CC chemokine family.\nChemokines are involved in the angiogenesis process by\nstimulating proangiogenic immune cells or by activating G\nprotein\u00adcoupled chemokine receptors, which affect the tis-\nsue microenvironments.54\nThe disruption and deregulation of the extracellular\nmatrix (ECM) often leads to cancer progression. In chronic\ndiseases, the disruption and remodeling of ECM by matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMPs) will affect several attributes of\nthe cancer cells, such as the invasiveness, and metastatic\nand angiogenesis potentials.55 MMP-9 is one of the impor-\ntant players in the MMP family, promoting vascular events\nin tumors as well as stimulating VEGF.56 Tissue inhibitor of\nmetalloproteinases (TIMPs) is an endogenous inhibitor that\nregulates the activities of MMP-9 in cancer cells.55 Keeping\nthe level of MMP-9 and TIMPs in check is important in\nreducing angiogenesis in cancer cells. MMP-9 expression is\ncommonly abundant in metastatic breast cancer cells.57 On\nthe other hand, the increase in TIMPs such as TIMP-1 and\nTIMP-2 in the tumor microenvironment can kill cancer\ncells and reduce cancer proliferation.58 The balance between\nthe downregulation of MMP-9 and upregulation of TIMP-1\nFigure 7.

Significant difference (*P < .05) from the untreated group was determined using the t-test. The experiment\nwas done in triplicate.

Significant difference (*P < .05) from the untreated group was determined using the\nt-test.\nand TIMP-2 were demonstrated in the kefir water\u00adtreated\ngroup, and this equilibrium was important in reducing can-\ncer. This antiangiogenic potential of kefir water was vali-\ndated with lung clonogenic and bone marrow smearing\nassays, where significantly fewer 4T1 cells were observed\nin the lung of the kefir water\u00adtreated mice, and no abnormal\ncells were found in the bone marrow of the kefir water\u00ad\ntreated mice. The immunomodulation potential of kefir\nwater, which aids in inhibiting tumor cell growth has also\nbeen observed in other studies using murine models of\nbreast cancers and sarcomas, whereby tumor growth was\ninhibited by enhancing the local immune system response\nand by increasing the total IgA level.5,59\nThe constituents of kefir that could have antitumor prop-\nerties are mostly the polysaccharide and exopolysaccha-\nrides isolated from kefir grains as well as components\nreleased during fermentation, as suggested by previous\nstudies.11,16,60 Interestingly, we have detected gallic acid as\nthe major phenolic acid in the kefir water (result not shown).\nThe antitumor effects and cytotoxicity of gallic acid extracts\non many cell lines have been extensively observed over the\nyears.61 Thus, further studies on kefir water should include\nthe effects of antitumor and immunomodulation activity of\nthe gallic acid detected in kefir water.\nConclusion\nIn this study, kefir water was able to reduce 4T1 cell prolif-\neration, migration, and invasion in vitro. An ex vivo angio-\ngenesis assay was also performed, and kefir water showed\npositive results in inhibiting angiogenesis. In addition,\nkefir water exhibited antimetastatic and antiangiogenesis\neffects in 4T1 cell\u00adchallenged mice in vivo through reduc-\ning 4T1 cell mitosis, promoting apoptosis, modulating\nimmune systems, inhibiting inflammation in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, and regulating angiogenesis-related\nproteins and genes. Thus, these findings are crucial in pro-\nmoting kefir water as part of the diet intake for cancer\npatients.\n"
