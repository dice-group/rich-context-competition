They were also excluded if they had\nbeen hospitalized in the past 5 y or were currently taking medi-\ncations for psychiatric conditions. In order to maximize the\nrate of infection by the virus, specific levels of serum antibody\nto the challenge virus were obtained at screening and partici-\npants were excluded with titers higher than 4. Each participant\nwas paid $1,000 for their participation at the conclusion of the\nstudy. This study received institutional review board approval,\nand written, informed consent was obtained for each study\nparticipant.\nProcedures\nVolunteers presenting for possible enrollment underwent\nmedical screening, including a blood draw to assess specific\nserum neutralizing antibody titer for rhinovirus 39 (RV39).\nQualifying participants were enrolled and during the approxi-\nmately 2 mo that preceded viral challenge they completed\nquestionnaire batteries, 2 w of daily interviews to assess posi-\ntive emotions, and a subsequent 1 w of wrist actigraphy and\nconcurrent sleep diary to objectively and subjectively measure\nsleep behavior. Another sample of blood was collected to as-\nsess antibody level just before (3\u00ad5 days) viral exposure, which\nprovided an estimate of prechallenge antibody titers.\nParticipants were then isolated in a local hotel for a 6-day\nperiod. During the first 24 h of the quarantine, prior to viral ex-\nposure, participants underwent a nasal examination and nasal\nlavage; baseline nasal mucociliary and nasal mucus production\nwere assessed at this time. Those showing signs or symptoms\nof a cold on this day were dismissed. Then, participants re-\nceived nasal drops containing approximately 150 tissue cul-\nture infectious dose (TCID50\n)/mL of RV39. Volunteers were\nsubsequently quarantined for 5 days. On each day, nasal la-\nvage samples were collected to assess infection (virus culture).\nAdditionally, daily nasal mucociliary clearance function and\nnasal mucus production were assessed as objective markers of\nillness. Approximately 28 days after viral exposure, blood was\ncollected for serological testing.\nSleep Measures\nParticipants wore an Actiwatch-(64) (Philips Respironics\nInc, McMurray, PA) on their nondominant wrists for 7 con-\nsecutive nights. Data were stored in 1-min epochs and vali-\ndated software algorithms (Philips Respironics Inc) were\nused to estimate sleep parameters. The two actigraphy vari-\nables included in these analyses were total sleep time and\nfragmentation index. Total sleep time, which was used to\nestimate sleep duration, was defined as the total amount of\nminutes scored as sleep by the software algorithm in a given\ndefined sleep interval. Fragmentation index is a measure of\nrestlessness during sleep as measured by sleep epochs as-\nsociated with movement (range 0 to 150, with higher values\nindicating poorer sleep continuity). As expected, actigraphy-\nassessed sleep efficiency, defined as the percentage of the\nsleep interval scored as sleep, was inversely correlated with\nchose fragmentation index instead of sleep efficiency given\nthe documented poor specificity associated with actigraphy-\nassessed sleep efficiency.29\nSelf-report sleep diaries were obtained concurrently with\nactigraphy collection. Each morning, participants reported in\ntheir sleep diary what time they went to sleep, what time they\nwoke up, and the min it took to fall asleep. Sleep time was\ncalculated as the time a participant reported waking up minus\nthe time the participant went to sleep. Self-reported sleep dura-\ntion was computed by sleep time minus the minutes required\nto fall asleep. Sleep efficiency was calculated as sleep duration\ndivided by sleep time multiplied by 100. Actigraphy and diary\nestimates for sleep (actigraphy: sleep duration and fragmen-\ntation; sleep diary: sleep duration and sleep efficiency) were\nobtained by averaging over the collection period for all partici-\npants with data for at least 5 of the 7 days.\nControl Variables\nWe controlled for a number of covariates previously asso-\nciated with susceptibility to the common cold, including pre-\nchallenge viral-specific antibody levels to RV; age; sex; race;\nbody mass index (BMI); the season in which the trial occurred;\nyears of education; household income, health habits including\ncurrent smoking status, physical activity, and alcohol con-\nsumption; and psychological variables including perceived\nsocioeconomic status, perceived stress, extraversion, agree-\nableness, and positive emotional style. These covariates were\nassessed either during eligibility screening or in the interval\nbetween screening and the viral challenge.\nParticipants self-reported their age, sex, and race. They de-\nscribed their primary racial and ethnic group by choosing from\nsix categories (white, Caucasian; black, African American;\nNative American, Eskimo, Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander;\nHispanic, Latino; Other). For the analyses, the racial or ethnic\ngroups were dummy coded, with all but whites and blacks col-\nlapsed into a single \"other\" category. BMI (weight in kg/height\nin m2) was computed based on measurements of participants'\nweight and height.\nIncome was assessed by having participants endorse one of\n13 household income categories (before taxes) that best repre-\nsented them. These categories ranged from less than $5,000 to\nfor the identified category and treated as a continuous vari-\nable. Participants' education was assessed by asking them to\nreport on their highest educational attainment. Nine response\nitems were provided, ranging from \"didn't finish high school\"\nto \"doctoral degree.\" Answers were converted into number of\nyears of education based on their responses (e.g., high school,\n12 y; PhD, 20 y). Perceived socioeconomic rank was assessed\nby participants placing themselves on a nine-rung of a ladder\nin terms of where they stand in their country based on income,\neducation, and occupation.26\nHealth habits were obtained through self-report question-\nnaires. Participants were deemed current smokers if they an-\nswered \"yes\" to being asked whether they currently smoked\ncigarettes, cigars, or pipes on a daily basis. Physical activity\nwas assessed by asking participants whether they engaged in\nregular activity at least once per week (1, yes; 0, no). Alcohol\nconsumption was obtained by asking participants the average\nnumber of drinks they consumed per day (one drink = one\nglass of wine, 12 oz of beer, or one shot of hard liquor).\nPsychological variables that were assessed by questionnaire\nincluded a 10-item perception of stress over the past month30;\nextraversion and agreeableness were assessed using the 10-\nitem versions from the International Personality Item Pool\n(IPIP) Big Five Factor Markers.31 Finally, positive emotional\nstyle was measured as part of an evening interview assessment\nthat was conducted over 14 consecutive days. During each\nof the 14 daily interviews participants reported the extent to\nwhich they felt happy, calm, lively, full of pep, and cheerful\nthroughout the preceding day; ratings for each item were av-\neraged to create a daily total positive affect score across the\nVirus Culture and Antibody Response\nVirus-specific neutralizing antibody titers were measured\nin serum samples obtained before and approximately 28 days\nafter viral exposure. The results were expressed as reciprocals\nof the final dilution of serum.32 Daily nasal lavage samples\nwere frozen at -80\u00b0C and later cultured for RV using standard\nSigns of Illness\nDaily mucus production was obtained by collecting used tis-\nsues in sealed plastic bags.33 The bags were weighed and the\nweights of the tissues and bags were subtracted. Nasal muco-\nciliary clearance function was measured by administering a\ndye into the anterior area of the nose and calculating the time\ntaken for the dye to reach the nasopharynx.33\nClinical Cold Criteria\nStudy participants were considered to have a clinical cold\nif they were both infected and met illness criteria. Infection\nwas defined as the recovery of the challenge virus on any of\nthe postchallenge days or a fourfold or greater increase in the\nvirus-specific serum neutralizing antibody titer measured pre-\nexposure to 28 days post-exposure.33 Illness criterion for an\nobjective cold required a total adjusted mucus weight of  10 g\nor a total adjusted nasal clearance time of  35 min.7\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were carried out using SPSS version 22 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, IL). Data were drawn from 212 volunteers who\nparticipated in this study. Of those, actigraphy measures were\ncollected from 165 participants. One participant was identi-\nfied as a clear outlier (> 9 standard deviations above the mean\non sleep duration) and excluded, yielding 164 participants for\nthese analyses. Self-report sleep measures obtained by sleep\ndiary were available on 159 participants. Income, BMI, and al-\ncohol consumption were log (base-10) transformed to better ap-\nproximate a normal distribution. Logistic regression was used\nto predict colds (1, yes; 0, no). Sleep measures were treated as\ncontinuous variables with the exception of self-reported sleep\nefficiency, which was negatively skewed, and was modeled as\na categorical (quartile) predictor. We reported regression coef-\nficients with standard errors and probability values.\nAge and prechallenge viral-specific antibody titers were\nincluded as covariates in all analyses. Next, we conducted a\nseries of regressions entering one of the 14 separate covari-\nates, along with age and prechallenge antibody titers. The\napproach reduces the risks of \"overfitting\" the regression\nmodels34,35; however, we also computed single models that\nincluded all study covariates simultaneously. In addition, to\nbetter elucidate the independent and interactive contributions\nof duration and continuity measures on cold susceptibility,\nwe fit models that included both actigraphy assessed sleep\nduration and fragmentation simultaneously as predictors as\nwell as tested the interaction between them (sleep duration \u00d7\nfragmentation).\nFinally, to better clarify associations between actigraphy as-\nsessed sleep duration and cold incidence and to provide an esti-\nmate effect size, sleep duration was categorized based on hours\nn = 22). We fitted a logistic regression using this categorical\nsleep variable and reported odds ratios (OR) with 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CIs).\nTable 1--Sample characteristics (n = 164).\nVariable Mean (SD) or % (n)\nSociodemographics\nRace (%)\nSeason (%)\nHealth practices\nPhysical activity (% engage in regular\nactivity/w)\nAlcohol consumption (# of drinks/w) 2.5 (4.8)\nPsychological measures\nSleep measures\nSleep diary\nActigraphy\nSD, standard deviation; SES, socioeconomic status.\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics and Sleep Scores\nTable 1 presents descriptive data for all variables involved\nfected and 48 (29.3%) developed a biologically verified cold,\nwhich was defined as infection and objective cold criterion.\nAs expected, sleep measures were intercorrelated (actig-\nactigraphy sleep duration and self-reported sleep duration,\nSleep and Susceptibility to the Common Cold\nAdjusting for age and prechallenge antibody titers, shorter\nsleep duration, assessed using actigraphy, was associated with\nincreased risk for the development of the cold (b = -0.44, stan-\ntation and self-reported sleep duration were not significant\npredictors of cold susceptibility (fragmentation: b = -0.01,\nficiency in the bottom quartile were no more likely to develop\nthe cold than individuals in the top quartile (b = 0.57, SE = 0.51,\nTo follow up on the significant association between actig-\nraphy-assessed sleep duration and the likelihood of developing\na biologically verified cold, additional models were computed\nadjusting for study covariates.

To this end, we fit a regression model with both\nmeasures entered together. Analyses revealed that sleep dura-\ntion continued to predict cold incidence adjusting for age and\nas well as in the fully adjusted (16 covariates and fragmenta-\nevidence that sleep duration and fragmentation interacted to\npredict cold incidence (P = 0.92).\nDISCUSSION\nShorter sleep duration, measured by wrist actigraphy over\na 7-day period, was prospectively associated with increased\nincidence of the common cold following experimental viral\nchallenge. This association was independent of a cadre of co-\nvariates, including age, prechallenge antibody levels, sex, body\nmass index, race, season of trial, income, education, perceived\nsocioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity, alcohol con-\nsumption, perceived stress, agreeableness, extraversion, and\npositive emotional style. This study provides the first prospec-\ntive evidence that behaviorally assessed sleep duration serves\nas a predictor of cold susceptibility.\nAnalyses revealed a linear association between sleep dura-\ntion and cold susceptibility; however, when categorized based\non hours of sleep, a threshold effect was observed such that in-\ndividuals sleeping fewer than 6 h of sleep per night were at ele-\nvated risk whereas those sleeping more than 6 h were not. This\nis consistent with some epidemiologic evidence that find strong\neffects on morbidity and mortality in short sleepers compared\nto normal sleepers.1,11,36 For instance, Patel and colleagues\nfound that in a sample of nearly 57,000 women, those who re-\nported sleeping  6 h per night were at significantly greater\nrisk of developing pneumonia compared to those sleeping 8 h\nper night.5 Those sleeping 7 h were at no greater risk than 8-h\nsleepers. Emerging evidence also suggests that long sleepers\nderlying mechanisms linking negative health and long sleep\nare poorly understood38\u00ad40; however, depression and medical\ncomorbidities have been implicated.38 Very few participants in\nthis study reported sleeping more than 9 h per night (11.3% by\nsleep diary, 0.6% by actigraphy), making it difficult to deter-\nmine whether long sleep was a risk factor of cold incidence.\nThe small sample of long sleepers in this study may be due to\nthe fact that the study sample was carefully screened to meet\ngood health standards, including being free from psychiatric\nillness.\nSelf-reported diary measures of duration and sleep ef-\nficiency were unrelated to cold incidence. This is in contrast\nto our prior work that found that poorer sleep efficiency and\nshorter sleep duration, measured via a 14-day daily interview,\npredicted cold susceptibility.6 There are several possible ex-\nplanations for differences across studies. First, fewer partici-\npants became infected in this sample, which may have limited\nour power to detect effects using self-report measures. Second,\nthis study relied on a shorter 7-day sleep diary rather than a\n14-day daily interview, which may have produced less stable\naverages as well as less accurate estimates of sleep. In regard\nto sleep estimates, employment of a daily interview in the prior\nstudy helped ensure timely assessments of self-reported sleep,\nwhich potentially decreased recall bias. Third, given that ac-\ntigraphy has been well correlated with polysomnography,41\nthe gold standard of measurement in sleep research, it is also\npossible that had our prior study included actigraphy assess-\nment concurrently with the daily interview sleep data, those\nfindings would have been even more robust. Future studies\nincorporating both actigraphy and sleep diaries are needed to\nunderstand when and why certain sleep measures significantly\npredict immune function.\nWhat are the mechanisms that might link sleep and suscep-\ntibility to acute infectious illness? Sleep, along with circadian\nrhythms, exerts substantial regulatory effects on the immune\nsystem.42,43 Circulating immune cells, including T and B cells,\npeak early in the night and then decline throughout the noc-\nturnal hours moving out of circulation into lymphoid organs\nwhere exposure to virally infected cells occur.43\u00ad45 Studies\nemploying experimental sleep loss also support functional\nchanges relevant to host resistance. Sleep deprivation results\nin down regulation in T cell production of interleukin-219,44 and\na shift away from T-helper 1 responses, marked by a reduc-\ntion in the ratio of interferon-/IL-4 production.16 Sleep loss\nis associated with diminished proliferative capacity of T cells\nin vitro15 as well as modulation of the function of antigen pre-\nsenting cells critical to virus uptake.46\nIllness expression in colds is generally attributed to blunted\ndownregulation of local inflammatory responses.47,48 Emerging\nevidence demonstrates bidirectional links between sleep and\ninflammation.14,42,49 Proinflammatory activity has a role in the\nhomeostatic regulation of sleep.50,51 Likewise, some but not\nall studies that employ partial and total sleep restriction find\nsubstantial increases in systemic levels of proinflammatory\ncytokines52 as well as enhanced inflammatory gene expres-\nsion and transcriptional pathways that support inflammatory\nprocesses.20,21 In addition, recent evidence suggests that el-\nevated systemic inflammation mediates prospective associa-\ntions between short sleep duration and premature mortality.53\nFuture studies characterizing the immunologic mediators of\ncold incidence in the context of sleep duration and our viral\nchallenge paradigm are needed to clarify when in the infection\nprocess sleep has the most potent effects.\nLike prior work, we find that infectious risk is strongest in\nthe shortest of sleepers, suggesting that \"normal\" sleepers (e.g.,\n7 to 9 h per night for adults) would be protected in this context.\nWhether sleep interventions aimed at increasing sleep dura-\ntion would protect individuals from cold incidence remains\nan open question. In this regard, recent findings that cognitive\nbehavioral therapy for older adults with insomnia resulted in\ndecreased levels of systemic inflammation54 raises the possi-\nbility that a similar enhancement in cell-mediated immunity\ncould also be observed. Given that infectious illness (i.e., influ-\nenza and pneumonia) remains one of the top 10 leading causes\nof death in the United States,55 the current data suggest that a\ngreater focus on sleep duration, as well as sleep health more\nbroadly,56 is indicated.\nIn summary, these novel findings provide the first evidence\nthat sleep duration assessed behaviorally through actigraphy\npredicts incidence of infectious illness using an experimental\nviral challenge. Although this study does not provide direct\nevidence of causality, the prospective nature of the viral chal-\nlenge design does eliminate concerns of reverse causation. It\nis recognized that actigraphy is a behavioral measure of rest/\nactivity patterns and is not an objective measure of sleep per\nse. Although actigraphy has been shown to correlate well with\npolysomnography in healthy samples,41 actigraphy-assessed\nindices of sleep duration cannot identify specific dimensions of\nsleep (e.g., decreased slow wave sleep) that may be contributing\nto infectious risk. In addition, future studies investigating the\nimmunologic mechanisms underlying these effects as well as\ngeneralizability of these findings to other samples (i.e., older\nadults; sleep disordered patients) are warranted.\nThis was not an industry supported study.
