This\nhas traditionally been managed by passive strategies such as portfolio selection and\nloan sales. The increasing availability of new instruments such as credit derivatives\nand synthetic structures in the recent past, however, has allowed a more active\nmanagement of credit risk, ie credit risk transfer.\nWhile practitioners as well as researchers increasingly take new instruments into\naccount, effects with respect to banks' behaviour and the stability of financial sys-\ntems are not that clear. In particular, (theoretical) analyses are unable to derive\nunambiguous results regarding the way credit risk transfer affects exposure to credit\nrisk either on the bank-level or the level of the financial system as a whole. The\nmain reason for this is that theoretical models usually consider the structure of\ncredit derivatives and synthetic instruments given exogenously. However, because\nof the OTC character of these new instruments, one might expect interdependencies\nto appear between contract design and banks' behavior.\nThe model used in the present paper considers two banks which do not compete\nfor depositors or lenders. Banks have the opportunity to transfer credit risk applying\na credit derivative in the form of a credit default swap (CDS). In this regard it is\nassumed that bank 1 only sells credit risk and bank 2 only buys credit risk. In order\nto take into account the OTC character the process of negotiating credit derivatives\nis modelled as a cooperative game. In this way, one is able to show that there\nappear portfolio effects in addition to the ones familiar in the context of banking\nactivities. In particular, we find the probability distributions of banks' returns from\nloan business to improve in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This, in\nturn, reduces banks' costs when funding loans by deposits. The reason for this is\nthat risk-averse depositors demand a lower risk premium when a bank's outcome\nfrom loan business becomes less risky. Furthermore, this allows banks to grant more\nloans, which reinforces portfolio effects. Moreover, by taking a closer look at the\nfinancial system one finds, first, that aggregate credit risk is reduced and, second,\nthat credit risk transfer allocates total credit risk among banks efficiently.\nIn this regard, the optimal credit derivative just covers parts of the protection\nbuyer's total exposure to credit risk. In particular, the banks agree just to transfer\ncredit risk to the amount which affects the protection buyer's ability to meet his\nown depositors' claims. In return, the protection seller gets payed a fixed premium\nwhich ensures that total profits from credit risk transfer are shared optimally among\nthe banks.\nRecent descriptive data regarding CDS transactions basically seem to support\nthe main results of the theoretical model in the present paper. The nominal amount\nof CDS contracts outstanding steadily increased during the last few years which is\nparticularly true with portfolio CDS contracts. Moreover, it could be observed that\nbanks which participate in credit risk transfer expanded loan granting activities.\nUnfortunately, currently there is no sufficient data available which allows for a more\ndetailed empirical analysis \u00ad especially with respect to banks' effective total exposure\nto credit risk.\nNicht technische Zusammenfassung\nAufgrund ihrer Gesch\u00a8\naftst\u00a8\natigkeit sind Banken in besonderem Ma\u00dfe dem Kredit-\nrisiko ausgesetzt, bei dessen Management sie sich traditionell auf eher passive Strate-\ngien wie Portfolioselektion oder Kreditverk\u00a8\naufe beschr\u00a8\nanken mussten. Die zuneh-\nmende Verbreitung von Instrumenten wie Kreditderivaten und synthetischen Ver-\nbriefungen erleichtern den Banken jedoch den Handel von Kreditrisiken und erm\u00a8\nog-\nlichen so ein aktives Risikomanagment.\nObwohl Praxis wie auch Wissenschaft diesen Entwicklungen zunehmend Beach-\ntung schenken, sind die Auswirkungen der Nutzung von Kreditderivaten und syn-\nthetischen Verbriefungen auf Banken und Finanzsystem erst wenig erforscht. Ins-\nbesondere gelingt es der einschl\u00a8\nagigen theoretischen Literatur bislang nicht, ein-\ndeutige Aussagen hinsichtlich der Beeinflussung des Kreditrisikos insgesamt auf\nBank- und Finanzsystemebene herauszuarbeiten. Zur\u00a8\nuckzuf\u00a8\nuhren ist dies in er-\nster Linie darauf, dass \u00a8\nublicherweise in den Analysen von exogen gegebenen Instru-\nmenten f\u00a8\nur den Kreditrisikohandel ausgegangen wird. In der Praxis werden diese\njedoch in der Regel durch die beteiligten Vertragspartner bilateral ausgehandelt, so\ndass Abh\u00a8\nangigkeiten zwischen dem Verhalten von Banken und der Ausgestaltung\nvon Kreditderivaten und synthetischen Verbriefungen zu erwarten sind.\nDas Modell der vorliegenden Arbeit bezieht diese Abh\u00a8\nangigkeiten explizit in die\nAnalyse ein. Ausgangspunkt der Modellierung sind zwei Banken, die in unter-\nschiedlichen M\u00a8\narkten im Kredit- und Einlagenbereich t\u00a8\natig sind und somit keinem\nWettbewerb unterliegen. Durch ein Kreditderivat in Form eines Credit Default\nSwap (CDS) erhalten die Banken die M\u00a8\noglichkeit zum Kreditrisikohandel, wobei\nBank 1 lediglich als Verk\u00a8\naufer und Bank 2 lediglich als K\u00a8\naufer von Kreditrisiko\nauftritt. Die Modellierung der optimalen Gestaltung des Kreditderivats erfolgt hier-\nbei als kooperatives Verhandlungsspiel unter symmetrischer Information zwischen\nden Vertragspartnern. In diesem Rahmen gelingt es zu zeigen, dass mit Hilfe des\noptimalen Kreditrisikohandels Diversifikationseffekte erzeugt und ausgenutzt werden\nk\u00a8\nonnen, die zus\u00a8\natzlich zu den ohnehin im Bankgesch\u00a8\naft existierenden Diversifikation-\nseffekten auftreten.

In der\nFolge sind die Banken in der Lage, ihre Kreditvergabe zu geringeren Kosten durch\nKundeneinlagen zu refinanzieren, da das gesunkene Ertragsrisiko ein Absenken der\nan die risikoaversen Einleger zu zahlenden Risikopr\u00a8\namie erlaubt. Als Resultat wer-\nden mehr Kredite vergeben und die auftretenden Portfolioeffekte weiter verst\u00a8\narkt.\nBei Betrachtung des gesamten Finanzsystems wird zudem deutlich, dass durch den\nRisikohandel das insgesamt auftretende Kreditrisiko reduziert und dieses geringere\nRisiko anschlie\u00dfend effizient auf die beteiligten Banken aufgeteilt werden kann.\nDar\u00a8\nuber hinaus zeigt sich, dass das im Modell bestimmte optimale Kreditderivat\nnicht das gesamte Kreditrisiko des Risikoverk\u00a8\naufers an den Risikok\u00a8\naufer \u00a8\nubertr\u00a8\nagt.\nVielmehr wird Kreditrisiko nur in dem Umfang an den Sicherungsgeber transferiert,\nsoweit es die Anspr\u00a8\nuche der Einleger des Risikoverk\u00a8\naufers tangiert.

Whether this is beneficial to participating banks or even the financial\nsystem at all is still an unresolved question. That is, recent academic analysis is\nnot able to determine unambiguous conclusions regarding the effects arising from\nbanks' use of credit derivatives.\nThe reason for this is that in the literature credit derivatives do not emerge\nendogenously from rational behavior of involved institutions. Rather, structures of\nthe instruments and pricing techniques are considered exogenous. Banks' decisions\nare, hence, only passive in the sense that behavior is simply adjusted to actual market\nconditions. The possible impact of banks' decisions on the market environment is\nusually not considered. As a result, it is found that credit derivatives allow one to\nexploit effects of portfolio diversification on the one hand, and on the other hand,\nbanks may adjust their decisions with respect to granting loans. When they decide\nto issue more risky loans it is unclear whether this offsets the portfolio effect.\nIn order to determine the net effect of this tradeoff one needs to consider that\ncredit derivatives are in general over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. That is, buyers\nand sellers of credit risk exposures bilaterally negotiate the terms of credit deriva-\ntives contracts. If one assumes rational behavior of both parties one might expect\ninterdependencies between details of credit derivatives and banks' loan granting and\ndeposit taking activities.\nThe present paper starts from this consideration and explicitly models the market\nfor credit derivatives.1 One is able to analyze the optimal structure of the credit\nderivatives contracts as well as its interactions with banks' decisions in the deposit\nand loan business, and the model picks up a number of real-world facts recently\nobserved in markets for credit derivatives.\nIn particular, a Nash-bargaining situation between two monopolistic banks is con-\nsidered in which the terms of Credit Default Swap (CDS) contracts are negotiated.\nThat is, the assumption of Nash-bargaining captures the OTC character of credit\nderivatives. Furthermore, when focusing on CDS contracts one acknowledges that\nthis is the most common type of present credit derivatives. Moreover, since banks\nmake up the largest group of sellers as well as buyers of credit risk the effects of\n1The model is based on chapter 5 of my dissertation completed at the University of Augsburg.\ncredit risk transfer within the banking system are considered. The assumption of\nmonopolistic banks permits one to focus on the pure effects of credit risk transfer\nand prevents distorting effects which may arise from competition among banks. The\nresults, which are derived within this setup, undoubtedly help to better understand\nthe effects of credit risk transfer ongoing at present.\nThe main results may be summarized as follows. The application of a CDS\ncontract positively affects participating banks in the sense that they are less exposed\nto credit risk than before entering into a CDS contract. In fact, the CDS contract\nsynthetically merges the loan portfolios of both banks and in this way reinforces\nthe effect of portfolio diversification. In this regard, the optimal structure of the\nCDS contract allows a bank to exploit corresponding benefits which are then shared\namong banks. For this purpose, the optimal CDS contract exhibits a number of\ninteresting features.\nIn particular, it is found that credit risk is only transferred to the extent that\nthe risk seller is not able to meet their own depositors' claims. Credit risk exposure\nwhich only affects the risk seller's positive profits above this threshold is not handed\nover to the risk buyer. The risk buyer, in turn, agrees to cover losses of the protection\nbuyer only if the claims of the risk buyer's depositors are not put at risk. A CDS\ncontract, thus, shifts credit risk to the bank which is better off and hence better able\nto absorb risk. In other words, CDS contracts ensure that credit risk is allocated\nefficiently among banks.\nA more efficient allocation of credit risk, then, allows banks to expand granting\nloans and taking deposits. This enhances portfolio diversification even more and\nreinforces risk reducing effects of credit risk transfer. As a result, one observes a\ncomplementary interrelationship between credit risk transfer on the one hand and\nbanks' loan and deposit decisions on the other hand.\nIn this way the present paper contributes to the relevant literature in a number\nof aspects. First, explicitly modelling the market for credit derivatives considerably\nextends the usual view of the literature. For example Broll and Welzel (2002), Broll\net al. (2002) and Broll et al. (2003) analyze a bank's decisions on loans, deposits and\nrisk management applying an industrial organization approach. That is, the bank's\ntechnology of producing loans and deposits is given exogenously. In addition, credit\nrisk may be traded with some standardized derivatives instruments at fixed price.\nIn this context a bank has an incentive to only sell credit risk. The extend of risk\nsold, then depends on the correlation between the risk exposure and the risk of the\nunderlying of the derivative. In contrast, the present paper argues that endogenous\ncredit risk transfer and OTC markets for credit derivatives is beneficial for banks\nregardless if they are sellers or buyers of credit risk. Moreover, credit derivatives will\nbe designed such that the risk of the underlying perfectly matches the risk seller's\nexposure to credit risk. Hence, there will always be a perfect hedge.\nAnother important aspect addressed in the present paper considers the inter-\naction between diversification effects and bank's decision making process. Recent\n(2007) start from exogenously given credit derivatives. With this assumption credit\nderivatives might be used to utilize diversification effects, but the consequences re-\ngarding total exposures to credit risk cannot be derived. In contrast, in the present\npaper it is argued that credit risk transfer allows banks to exploit diversification ef-\nfects without increasing the overall risk in the market. Hence, credit risk transfer is\nnot only a matter of allocating risk in the financial markets efficiently, but may also\nhelp to reduce the market's exposure to risk. In this way, the present paper is able\nto show that a large number of arguments are parallel to findings in the literature on\n(1962) and Blazenko (1986) derive similar results in the case of insurers reinsuring\nsome of their risk. An important difference, however, is that in these papers the\nstructure of reinsurance agreements is not derived endogenously. Rather, a number\nof plausible exogenous reinsurance designs are considered. Therefore, the results of\nthe present paper are more general.\nThe analysis to follow is also related to papers of Hart (1975), Santomero and\nTrester (1998) and Duffee and Zhou (2001) which examine the effects of innovations\nin financial markets in general. A common argument in these papers is that there\nmay occur situations when financial innovations might reduce welfare. However,\nthis result is largely driven by exogenous creation of instruments and asymmetric\ninformation. While informational problems in financial markets are not explicitly\naddressed in the present paper the endogenous character of credit derivatives helps to\ntradeoff a number of effects figured out in these seminal papers and find unambiguous\nnet effects.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 sets up the model.\nSection 3 considers portfolio aspects in detail which are used to derive the main\nresults of the paper in section 4. Section 5 concludes. Mathematical proofs can be\nfound in the appendix.\n2 The Model\nAssumptions\nFor the analysis of endogenous credit risk transfer consider the following situation.\nTwo monopolistic banks, B1 and B2, may bilaterally negotiate a CDS contract and\nin this way set up a market for credit risk. In this regard, it is assumed that B1 just\nsells credit risk (buys protection) and B2 just buys credit risk (sells protection).2\nThe purpose of the CDS contract is to enable trading credit risk without affecting\nthe banks' balance sheets. Therefore, the contract needs to define the (part of) B1's\nexposure to credit risk to be transferred to B2 and the price being payed in exchange\nby the protection seller (B1).\nIn particular, the CDS contract transfers credit risk by defining a payment from\nthe protection seller to compensate the protection buyer for a loss of at least a\nsingle loan. This implies that B1 first needs to specify a number s of loans out of\nB1's loan portfolio for which credit risk is transferred. Below, s will be referred\nto as the underlying of the CDS contract. Furthermore, denote R the payment of\nB2 to B1 which depends, first, on the underlying's return Ys\nand, second, on B2's\noutcome from the loan business Xl\n. Besides endogenously determining the levels of\nYs\nwhich trigger a payment from B2 to B1 (default events) the functional definition\nof R(Ys\n, Xl\n) allows for considering counterparty risk. That is, for a given Ys\nmight be allowed to reduce the payment R depending on B2's disposable funds. In\nthis regard it needs to be mentioned that from B2's point of view R is subordinated\nto its depositors' claims. In addition, let  denote the fixed premium B1 has to pay\nto B2 in exchange for credit risk transfer. Finally, it is assumed that there does not\nappear any asymmetric information between the banks. In this way, one is able to\nfocus on effects of credit risk transfer without being distorted by incentive aspects.\nThis opportunity for credit risk transfer needs to be incorporated into a finan-\ncial system in order to analyze interdependencies between credit risk transfer and\nbanks' behavior. For this purpose, consider two (geographically) separated financial\nmarkets. Each of the aforementioned banks is a monopolist in one of these markets.\nMoreover, in B1's (B2's) region there is a finite number n1\n) of borrowers. Each\nborrower has an investment project with positive net present value available which\ngenerates an ex ante random outcome and requires one unit of external funds. De-\nnote yi\n [0, y] and xi\n [0, x] the outcome of borrower i's investment project and\nf(yi\n) and a(xi\n) the corresponding probability distribution functions (pdf) in B1's\nand B2's region, respectively. Investment projects in a certain region are assumed\nidentical and stochastically independent. Since banks as well as borrowers are as-\nsumed to lack any own funds, one needs to add lenders to the setup.\nThe assumptions regarding lending below truly extend the standard models in\nthe literature.3 In particular, there is a finite number m1\n) of risk-averse lenders\nin B1's (B2's) region. Let U(\u00b7) and V (\u00b7) denote lenders' strictly increasing von-\n2While this assumption seems to be quite restrictive at first glance, one might argue that it is\nthe bank's net position in credit risk transfer which is captured by the assumption. Hence, there\nappears no loss of generality in this way.\n3Note that so far assumptions simply represented an application of the standard models of\nmarkets.\nNeumann-Morgenstern utility function in the region of B1 and B2, respectively.4\nEach lender is endowed with one unit of funds which they wish to profitably invest.\nMoreover, the number of lenders \u00ad and hence the amount of funds \u00ad in each region\nare assumed to be sufficient in order to run all investment projects. Furthermore,\nlenders have different levels of reservation utilities which they can realize by choosing\nsome opportunities outside the model. However, while each lender exactly knows his\nlevel of reservation utility, banks as well as borrowers only know the range of possible\nutility levels and some kind of probability distribution thereof. In this regard, let\n [UR\n, UR\n] (VRj\n [VR\n, VR\n]) with UR\n> 0) denote the domain and g(URj\n)\n(b(VRj\n)) the corresponding pdf of lender j's reservation utility in B1's (B2's) region.\nIn this way it becomes possible to consider some kind of supply function for financial\nfunds in the model. Note, if a bank, for example, wants to take more deposits, the\nprice of deposits will increase, too. While this relationship is standard in economics,\nthe standard literature on financial intermediation so far did not account for this\nfact. Rather, the focus of this strand of literature was on asymmetric information\nwithin financial contracting situations.\nIn the context of the present model, there is also asymmetric information between\nbanks and borrowers, on the one hand, and lenders and banks, on the other hand.\nIn particular, assume that banks (lenders) need to incur some fixed cost c in order\nto observe the actual outcome of a borrower's investment project (a bank's loan\nbusiness). That is, the costly state verification problem which is well known from\nthe literature may also appear in the present model. In this context, it is noteworthy\nto mention that the verification cost c is the same regardless of the region or the\nrelationship considered. In this way, one prevents that results of the decision making\nprocess are driven by such differences.\nOwing to the assumptions above the decision making process can be represented\nas a three-stage game. It starts (stage 1) with banks' decisions on optimal con-\ntracts, ie loan, deposit, and CDS contracts are determined. In particular, there is a\n(natural) sequence of decisions at this stage which starts with determining optimal\nvolumes of loan and deposit contracts by both banks. In addition, B1 optimizes the\nunderlying s of the CDS contract. If one refers to this set of decisions as stage 1a, at\nstage 1b payment R(Ys\n, Xl\n) and premium  of the CDS contract are negotiated. At\nstage 1c both banks decide on the optimal structure of loan and deposit contracts.\nAt stage 2 banks offer loan and deposit contracts to lenders and borrowers who then\n4Note, the assumption that lenders behave risk-averse while banks and borrowers are risk-\nneutral captures the consequences of limited liability of the latter. While Froot et al. (1993) and\nFroot and Stein (1998) present arguments for risk averse behavior of borrowers and banks, Jensen\nand Meckling (1976) explain that because of limited liability their level of risk aversion is less than\nthe one of lenders. This is particularly true if one considers lenders to be private households which\nare not able to well diversify their claims. Hence, the assumptions with respect to preferences\ntowards risk of the present model are the most simple way to consider these arguments.\ndecide on accepting or not. If deposit and loan contracts have been accepted by\nlenders and borrowers, investment projects will be carried out and outcomes from\ninvestment projects and the banks' loan business will be realized. Since outcomes\nare observed only by borrowers and banks, they would be apt to exploit their infor-\nmational advantage opportunistically and renege on contracts (stage 3). Therefore,\nrational behavior by participating actors will take this into account when designing\ncontracts.\nFundamentals\nFor the analysis of the three-stage-game presented above, the concept of subgame-\nperfect Nash equilibrium will be applied. For this purpose one considers stage 3 first.\nThat is, provided that contracts had already been written and accepted, incentive\ncompatibility of deposit and loan contracts is examined in a first step. The analysis,\nthen, continues with stage 2. In this regard, conditions will be figured out which\nensure that lenders and borrowers are willing to accept deposit and loan contracts.\nWhen so doing results derived for stage 3 are taken into account. At the end, stage\n1 is examined. For this purpose analysis starts with determining optimal structures\nof deposit and loan contracts (stage 1c), and then proceeds with analyzing optimal\nCDS contracts and the optimal volumes of deposit and loan contracts. In either\ncase results derived for subsequent stages are taken into account. Moreover, there\nare some aspects to be noted which might simplify the analysis.\nIn particular, because of the assumption of separate financial markets interde-\npendencies between both banks' decisions may arise only from credit risk transfer.\nThis makes it possible to examine optimal deposit and loan contracts of a bank\nindependently from the decisions of the other bank as long as CDS contracts are\ntaken as given. Furthermore, let k (l) and d (e) denote the volume of loan and de-\nposit contracts of B1 (B2). Then B1 is able to grant k loans only if it takes enough\ndeposits to cover the premium of the CDS contract in addition: d = k + . B2,\nhowever, can reduce the volume of deposits taken in order to grant l loans due to\n: e = l - . This argument also considers the fact that deposit taking is costly to\nthe banks. Therefore, there is no reason for any bank to take more deposits than\nnecessary to run loan business and credit risk transfer. In the following analysis this\nis considered as given.\nAs explained above, stage 3 of the earlier outlined game is examined first. In\nthis regard, it should be noted that there are two sources of incentive problems.\nFirst, in the context of the loan contract a borrower might misreport the project\noutcome to the bank if he will be able to reduce payment in this way. Second, a\nbank might claim that proceeds from the loan business do not suffice to meet pre-\nspecified payments to depositors. Hence, loan and deposit contracts need to specify\npayments and situations in which the better informed party is monitored in order\nto ensure incentive compatibility.\nAs can be easily verified, optimal loan and deposit contracts which solve this\nproblem show the structure of standard debt contracts. Denote tK\n(yi\n) (pK\n(xi\n)) a\nborrower's payment to B1 (B2) and TD\n(Yk\n) (PD\n(Xl\n)) B1's (B2's) average payment\nper unit of loans to depositors. The structure of optimal incentive compatible loan\nand deposit contracts, then, is\nTD\n(Yk\n) =\n\n\n\n; Yk\nYk\n- d\nk\nc ; Yk\nand PD\n(Xl\n) =\n\n\n\n; Xl\nXl\n- e\nl\nc ; Xl\ntK\n(yi\n) =\n\n\n\n; yi\nyi\n- c ; yi\nand pK\n(xi\n) =\n\n\n\n; xi\nxi\n- c ; xi\nThat is, the solution of the costly state verification problem in the literature still\napplies in the context of the present model.5 Of course, the interpretation of the\noptimal contracts is also straightforward. The contracting parties of either contract\nagree on a fixed payment which is denoted TD0\nin the respective\ncases. As long as this fixed payment is made, there is no verification. If, however, the\npayment falls short of this fixed amount, there will be verification and the payment\nwill be as large as possible. In the latter situation, verification costs need to be\npayed in addition. Compared to the literature, there is, however, one point in which\nthe present model is different.\nTaking a closer look at optimal deposit contracts, a banks' payment depends on\nthe total outcome from its loan business. In this regard, Yk\nand Xl\ndenote B1's and\nB2's total average outcome per unit of loans from the loan business. Furthermore,\ndefine\nYk\n=\nk\n(Y + R(Ys\n, Xl\n)) with Y =\nk\ntK\n(yi\n) and Xl\n=\nl\nX with X =\nl\npK\n(xi\n).\nFrom these definitions it is obvious that B1's outcome from the loan business in-\ncludes repayments from loan contracts as well as CDS payments. In addition, B2's\npayments to depositors are not affected from credit risk transfer since CDS pay-\nments are subordinated to depositors' claims. The question is, however, whether\nthese optimal deposit and loan contracts are accepted by lenders and borrowers.\nThis latter question is exactly the focus of stage 2 of the present three-stage\ngame which will be analyzed next. Note, borrowers and lenders are willing to accept\noffered loan and deposit contracts only if it is beneficial to them. And this means\nthat a certain borrower's/lender's expected utility when a loan or deposit contract\n5For a detailed proof of this result see Pausch (2006, p. 128ff) and the arguments of Gale and\nis accepted needs to be at least as large as the expected utility from loan/deposit\ncontracts without credit risk transfer.6 In formal terms this may be written from\nthe borrowers' point of view as\nk\nyi\n- tK\n(yi\n) - c dF(yi\n) +\ny\n(yi\n) dF(yi\n)  E (1-nCDS\nl\nxi\n- pK\n(xi\n) - c dA(xi\n) +\nx\n(xi\n) dA(xi\n)  E (2-nCDS\nwhere (3) represents the participation constraint of a borrower in B1's region and (4)\nis the participation constraint of a borrower in B2's region. Lenders' participation\nconstraint can be written in a similar way:\nG\nU\nk\nd\nTD\n(Yk\n) dH(Yk\n) +\nYk\nU\nk\nd\ndH(Yk\n) =\nd\n G (EU1-nCDS\nB\nV\nl\ne\nPD\n(Xl\n) dW(Xl\n) +\nV\nl\ne\ndW(Xl\n) =\ne\n B (EV2-nCDS\nwhere (5) denotes the participation constraint of a lender in B1's region and (6)\nrepresents the participation constraint of a lender in B2's region. In the lenders'\ncase H(Yk\n) and W(Xl\n) denote the cumulative probability distribution functions of\nYk\nand Xl\n, respectively. Furthermore, due to the definitions of both variables it\nmust be true that\nYk\n] and Xl\n]\nwhere Yk\nrepresents some upper bound of Yk\ndepending on R(Ys\n, Xl\n).\nWith respect to lenders' participation constraint it should be noted that neither\nbank can observe a certain lenders reservation utility. Therefore, deposit contracts\ndo not differ among lenders. As a result, a bank which wishes to take a certain\namount of deposits needs to write the uniform deposit contract such that the prob-\nability that a lender's reservation utility is less than the expected utility from a\ndeposit contract equals the desired share of lenders who accept deposit contracts.\nIt should be noted that results sketched so far represent optimal decisions at\nstages 3 through 1c of the three-stage game. The volumes of deposit and loan\ncontracts as well as terms of CDS are taken as given in this context. Therefore,\nthese results need to be considered when examining stages 1b and 1a of the game\nin the following section.\n6In this regard see Pausch (2006) for a basic version of the present model without credit risk\ntransfer. There it is argued that banks which grant loans and take deposits provide strictly pos-\nitive profits to borrowers and lenders. Moreover, they earn a strictly positive expected profit for\nthemselves.(p. 88ff)\n3 Portfolio effects and optimal deposit and loan\ncontracts\nFrom taking a closer look at borrowers' and lenders' participation constraints (3),\n(4) and (5), (6) it is obvious that a bank's volume of loans is very important for the\nlevel of expected profit and expected utility in the respective cases. A more detailed\nexamination of this matter, therefore, seems to be necessary.7\nConsidering borrowers' participation constraints first, one observes that a bor-\nrower's repayment tK0\n) increases when a bank decides to grant more loans.\nMore formally, applying the implicit function theorem to B1's and B2's borrowers'\nparticipation constraints \u00ad which are binding in the optimum \u00ad yields\ndk\ndl\nAt a first glance this result seems to be counterintuitive. However, if one considers\nthat with increasing its volume of loans a bank rises a borrower's probability of\nsuccessfully entering into a loan contract. It should be clear that in this way the\nexpected profit of a borrower grows \u00ad all other things being equal. The monopolistic\nbank is then able to skim the borrower's additional expected profit by increasing\nthe repayment written down in the loan contract. At the end, a borrower's ex-\npected profit remains unchanged and corresponding participation constraints are\nstill binding.\nAt the deposit side of banks' business things are more complicated. As can be\neasily seen from lenders' participation constraints (5) and (6), there are two ways in\nwhich banks' decisions on the volume of loans affects lenders' expected utility. First,\na direkt effect appears, ie k and l enter (5) and (6) directly. Second, there is also an\nindirect effect which affects a lender's expected utility via probability distribution\nfunctions.\nThis latter indirect effect is worth to be examined in more detail. In this regard,\nit proves useful to consider the cumulative distribution function of Xl\nfirst. Note,\nearlier it was argued in this context that by the assumption of CDS payment being\nsubordinated B2's depositors' claims are not affected by the CDS contract. There-\nfore, one can apply the convolution theorem8 to determine the value of the cdf W\nof Xl\nat an arbitrary realization l\nand given volume of loans l as\nW(l\n|l) =\n{(pK1,...,pKl): l\npKill}\n) . . . a(pKl\n)dpKl\n. . . dpK1\n.\n7The arguments in the present section are more intuitive in order to economize on space. For\na strictly formal treatment of the aspects see Pausch (2006, p. 132ff ).\nIn this latter equation we have, moreover, used the facts that pKi\n= pK\n(xi\n)  i\nand xi\nbeing independently identically distributed with density function a(\u00b7). Now,\nadding a further loan to B2's portfolio yields\nW(l\n{(pK1,...,pKl): l\npKi(l+1)l}\n) . . . a(pKl\n) \u00b7\n\u00b7\npKi}\ndpKl\n. . . dpK1\n.\nObviously, both equations only differ in the term\nlpKi}\n-\nl\npKi\nthat is the value of the cdf of pK\n) at (l + 1)l\n- l\npKi\n.\nSince the same line of arguments may be applied to the cdf H(\u00b7) of Yk\nat any\nrealization k\none can conclude\nH(k\n)\nk\nW(l\n)\nl\n, l\ngiven that k and l are sufficiently large to be considered continuous. In words, what\nhas been figured out is that there appears a portfolio effect in the sense of first-\norder stochastic dominance as a bank increases the number of issued loans. That\nmeans that the probability of low realizations of outcome from the loan business\ndecreases when the loan portfolio of a bank grows. This may also be interpreted as\na reduction of a bank's total exposure to credit risk due to pooling of a large number\nof independent risky loans.\nIt is worth noting at this point that the portfolio effects which appear in the\npresent paper differ from similar effects in the standard literature. In particular, the\nand Krasa and Villamil (1992b) apply portfolio effects based on the law of large\nnumbers or the large deviation principle, respectively, to figure out the value of\nbanks. For this reasoning, however, banks need to be very large since portfolio\neffects in these papers only arise in the limit. This is not the case in the context of\nthe present paper. A portfolio effect in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance\noccurs even when a bank is small. Hence, the value of a bank depends on the cost\nof taking deposits. Therefore, the optimal size of a bank in the present model may\nbe determined by explicitly trading off benefits and costs of banking which was not\npossible in the literature so far.\nIn order to determine the cost of deposit taking the relationship between the size\nof the loan portfolios k and l and the optimal payments TD0\nin the banks'\ndeposit contracts, respectively, need to be examined. Unfortunately, by applying\nthe implicit function theorem to lenders' participation constraints (5) and (6) one\nis not able to find an unambiguous relationship. Rather, there appears a tradeoff of\ntwo effects. In this regard the portfolio effect, in general, reduces banks' credit risk\nexposure which is also beneficial from lenders' point of view. Since the probabilities\nof low outcomes from the banks' loan business decrease due to the portfolio effect,\nlenders' risk of low repayments when entering into deposit contracts also decreases.\nHence, banks are able to reduce risk premia \u00ad note that lenders behave risk-averse \u00ad\nand therefore TD0\nmight decrease when k and l are increased, respectively.\nHowever, because of k = d -  and l = e + , for given  k and l can increase only\nif the banks take more deposits d and e. For this purpose, lenders' expected utility\nfrom entering into deposit contracts needs to increase which means that banks need\nto raise TD0\n. Hence, the net effect depends on the relative strength of both\neffects just explained.\nHowever, since the present paper aims at an examination of an interior optimum\nfor k and l it is obvious that the total effect of increasing the volume of loans cannot\nbe negative. If this would be the case, increasing k and l would allow to reduce TD0\n, respectively, which reduces banks' costs of deposit taking. At the same\ntime, due to (7) expected profits of both banks would increase. In this situation\nfurther increasing the volumes of loans is beneficial. Therefore, an optimum is\narrived only if\nk\nl\nThe cost of deposit taking of both banks are, in addition, affected by the CDS\ncontract. In particular, the premium  might shift TD0\nwhereas the pay-\nments R(Ys\n, Xl\n)  (Ys\n, Xl\n) might furthermore shift the optimal level TD0\n.9 In this\nregard, applying the implicit function theorem to lenders' participation constraints\n\n\nThe reason for this is that a higher  means to increase (decrease) the volume of\ndeposits (loans) of B1 in order to hold constant the volume of loans (deposits). How-\never, taking more deposits forces the B1 to increase lenders' expected utility from\naccepting deposit contracts. In contrast, reducing the volume of loans and leaving\nconstant the amount of deposit contracts hurts the portfolio effect and increases\nB1's exposure to risk. Risk averse lenders will demand a higher risk premium in\nthis latter situation. Hence, in either case TD0\nneeds to increase when  increases.\nWith respect to B2 the converse argument is true: for B2  represents an addi-\ntional source of income. As a result, B2 may reduce deposit taking in order to issue\nof B2 is independent from R(\u00b7) due to the subordinated character of the CDS\ncontract.\na certain volume of loans. Hence, PD0\nmay decrease and deposit taking becomes\nless expensive to B2 when  increases.\nTo figure out the relationship between TD0\nand R(\u00b7) it should, first, be noted\nthat R(\u00b7) does not enter constraint (5) directly. Rather, R(\u00b7) may be interpreted\nas an additional source of income of B1. Hence, it affects TD0\nvia the probability\ndistribution function H(\u00b7) of Yk\nk\n(Y + R(Ys\n, Xl\n)). It is, therefore, necessary to\nexamine H(\u00b7) in more detail. Basically, for this purpose the well known convolution\ntheorem will be applied. However, the approach needs to be modified because Y\nand R(Ys\n, Xl\n) are stochastically dependent due to Ys\n. One, therefore, derives\nH(k\n) =\n{tK (y1),...,tK (yk-s): k-s\ntK (yi)kk}\nf(tK\n)) . . . f(tK\n(yk-s\n)) \u00b7\n\u00b7\n{tK (yk-s+1),...,tK (yk):Yskk- k-s\ntK (yi)}\nf(tK\n)) . . . f(tK\n(yk\n)) \u00b7\n\u00b7FR|Ys\nkk\n-\nk\ntK\n(yi\n) dtK\n(yk\n) . . . dK\nIn equation (11) loans i  {s-k+1; . . . ; k} form the underlying of the CDS contract\nwith corresponding total outcome of Ys\n= k\ntK\n(yi\n). Moreover, FR|Ys\ndenotes\nthe conditional cumulative distribution function of R(\u00b7) given a certain realization of\nYs\n. If one, now, considers some realization (ys\n, xl\n) of (Ys\n, Xl\n) from (11) it is obvious\nthat\nH(k\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\n; (Ys\n, Xl\nIn this regard, increasing R(\u00b7) for any given realization of (Ys\n, Xl\n) apparently reduces\nthe probability that Yk\nfalls below some arbitrary threshold k\n. That is, the payment\nof the CDS contract reinforces the portfolio effect in B1's loan business. As a result,\nB1's loan business becomes less risky which is beneficial to lenders and allows to\nreduce the risk premium implied in B1's deposit contracts. Hence, it must be true\nthat\nH(k\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\n; (Ys\n, Xl\nWith these findings in mind, one can proceed with the determination of the op-\ntimal CDS contract and optimal decisions on volumes of deposit and loan contracts\nin the next section.\n4 The optimum\nThe fundamental results outlined in the previous sections allow for an examination\nof optimal endogenous CDS contracts and optimal volumes of deposits and loans\nin the following. More formally, analysis of the three-stage game proceeds with an\nexamination of stage 1b and, thereafter, stage 1a. That is, one continues to apply\nthe technique of backward induction to stages 1b and 1a taking into account results\nat stages 3 through 1c.\n4.1 The optimal CDS contract\nIn order to consider the OTC character of a CDS contract banks' negotiation process\nis modelled as a cooperative game. The idea is that banks' objective to maximize\nexpected profit also implies maximizing benefits from credit risk transfer. However,\nbanks are free to enter into a CDS contract or not. Hence, the negotiation process\nwill be successful only if either bank is better off with credit risk transfer. There-\nfore, rational behavior of banks makes for maximizing joint profit from credit risk\ntransfer and sharing proceeds between banks. Given the assumptions of the present\nmodel this cooperative game can be solved applying the bargaining solution of Nash\nFor this purpose banks determine the premium  and payments R(Ys\n, Xl\n)  (Ys\n, Xl\n)\nof the CDS contract such that the increase of joint profit due to credit risk transfer\nis maximized. This, however, ist constrained by the fact that any payment R(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nis bounded above by B2's remaining funds after having payed depositors. Further-\nmore, payments R(Ys\n, Xl\n) are assumed to be non-negative and premium  is strictly\npositive in an effective CDS contract. Formally this maximization problem can be\nwritten as\nmax\n,{R(Ys,Xl)}(Ys,Xl)\ns.t. R(Ys\n, Xl\n)  l(Xl\n())  Xl\nR(Ys\n, Xl\nIn order to solve the optimization problem optimal volumes of deposit and loans\ncontracts of both banks as well as the optimal underlying of the CDS are considered\nas given. As a result, one can state and prove\n10See Pausch (2006, S. 176ff) for a more detailed discussion regarding the application of the Nash\nbargaining solution.\nProposition 1 For any given k, l, and s the optimal CDS contract is characterized\nby the following payment function:\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmin min{stK0\n} - Ys\n; l(Xl\n) - (Ys\n(Xl\n), Xl\n) if()\nwith () = {Xl\n; Ys\n< min{stK0\n}} and (Ys\n(Xl\n), Xl\n)  0. The optimal\npremium  ensures an optimal allocation of credit risk to both banks.\nProof: See the appendix.\nAt first glance, the structure of the optimal CDS contract looks quite complex\nand, hence, some comments seem to be appropriate. In this regard, note first that\nboth banks agree on a kind of default event which triggers a payment of B2 to B1.\nThis is the interpretation of the term min{stk0\n} - Ys\n. In particular, the total\noutcome from the underlying of the CDS contract is compared to a threshold which\nis the minimum of the highest realization of Ys\nand B1's depositors' total claims. If\nYs\nfalls short of this threshold, B2 will have to cover exactly the difference. This, of\ncourse, requires that B2's funds are enough after paying depositors' claims. Other-\nwise, B2 will pay a lower amount to B1 in case of default. In this latter situation,\nnote that B2 will never pay all remaining funds to B1. Else, it is obvious from\nconstraint (15) that B2 would end up without any own funds and expected profit\n). That is, whenever B2 has to pay some strictly positive\nR(\u00b7) to B1 an arbitrary low amount (\u00b7) will be retained. Therefore, constraint (15)\nwill never bind for any Xl\n. At the end, there will be, of course, no strictly\npositive payment R(\u00b7) as long as there is no default at B1 and/or B2's earnings\nfrom granting loans do not exceed depositors' claims. As a result, with determining\noptimal payments R(\u00b7) the banks optimize the allocation of credit risk in the present\nmodel of a financial system.\nBut this is only part of the story. The arguments above made clear that the CDS\ncontract allows B1 to get rid of some part of credit risk which is, instead, borne\nby B2. Bearing this in mind, it is obvious that B1 gains from credit risk transfer\nwhereas B2 might suffer a loss. Therefore, there needs to be a compensation to B2\nwhich optimally allocates benefits from credit risk transfer. This is what determines\nthe optimal premium . Unfortunately, the optimal allocation of benefits from\nwriting a CDS contract depends on a number of parameters just like the probability\ndistributions of investment projects' outcomes and lenders' utility functions. One\nis, thus, not able to derive more detailed results regarding the optimal level of .\nMoreover, results have been derived for given underlying and volumes of deposit\nand loan contracts of both banks. Therefore, changing one of these parameters might\naffect R(\u00b7) and  which makes it necessary to do some comparative statics. However,\nin order to economize on space results in this regard will be derived intuitively.11 In\nthis way, it is found out that\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\ns\n\ns\n, Xl\nThat is, as long as s < k holds increasing s means that there are more loans of\nB1 included in the underlying of the CDS contract. This causes a portfolio effect\nin the sense of first order stochastic dominance: the probability of low realizations\nand, hence, the probability of high payments of B2 decreases. In other words, B2's\nrisk of covering losses from B1's credit risk decreases. This makes the CDS contract\nmore beneficial for B2 but less valuable for B1. As a result, B1 is less willing to\nenter into a CDS contract and adjustments need to occur to ensure both banks to\nenter into the contract. For this purpose R(\u00b7) needs to increase and / or  has to\ndecrease. Furthermore, when s  k then there is no change in the underlying and\nno portfolio effect appears. Therefore, in this situation both banks' benefits remain\nunchanged when s increases and no adjustments of R(\u00b7) and  will occur.\nTaking a look at the effect of changing B1's volume of loans k on the details of\nthe CDS contract R(\u00b7) and , in general, one is not able to derive unambiguous\nresults. The reason for this is that there appears a tradeoff. On the one hand,\nincreasing k reinforces B1's portfolio effect in the sense that low realizations of B1's\noutcome from granting loans become less likely. On the other hand, in order to\nincrease k B1 needs to take more deposits. For this purpose payments to depositors\nhave to increase which makes B1's costs of deposit taking to increase, too. The\nnet effect, however, depends on the relative strength of both partial effects and\ngeneral unambiguous conclusions are not available. But if one considers a situation\nof optimal decisions it is obvious that reducing R(\u00b7) and / or rising  when k is\nincreased makes the CDS contract less beneficial for B1. That is, when R(\u00b7) decreases\nand / or  increases low realizations in B1's earnings become more likely and / or\ncredit risk transfer becomes more expensive. As a result, B1's depositors demand\neven higher repayment due to higher risk premia which leaves B1 worse off and less\nwilling to enter into a CDS contract. Therefore, in the optimum it must be true\nthat\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n\nk\n, Xl\n4.2 Optimizing banking activities and hedging\nAs explained earlier, the final step in the analysis of banks' behavior when credit\nderivatives are endogenous regards the examination of stage 1a of the three-stage\ngame. That is, in the following optimal amounts of deposit and loan contracts as\nwell as the optimal underlying of the CDS contract will be determined. For this\npurpose the previous results need to be considered.\nNote first that there is a well-defined relationship between a bank's volumes of\ndeposit and loan contracts. In section 2 above, it was explained that d = k + \nand e = l -  holds for B1 and B2, respectively. As a result, given the optimal\npremium  it is sufficient to examine optimal volumes of loans explicitly. The\noptimal numbers of deposit contracts can, then, be calculated as a residual. Second,\nfrom the optimal structure of the CDS contract of Proposition 1 one can conclude\nYk\n.\nIn words: B1's maximum average outcome per unit of loans is exactly the repayment\nobligation of a loan contract which does not default. It will prove useful to keep in\nmind these observations when, in the following, optimal volumes of loan and deposit\ncontracts and the optimal underlying of the CDS contract is determined.\nFor this purpose, both banks decide on the optimal number of loan contracts in\norder to maximize expected profits. In addition, B1 determines the optimal level\nof s which defines the underlying of the CDS contract. Moreover, in either case\nlenders' participation constraints (5) and (6) need to be considered. Formally, B1's\noptimization problem may be written as\nmax\nk,s\n)\ns.t.\nk + (k, s)\nFrom the examination of the optimization problems of both banks one can conclude\nProposition 2 The optimal volume of loans of the protection buyer (B1) does not\ndecrease due to credit risk transfer. B1's optimal volume of deposits strictly increases\ndue to credit risk transfer.\nProof: see the appendix.\nProposition 1 states that there is an interrelationship between B1's loan granting\nand deposit taking activities and credit risk transfer. As can be observed from the\nproof of Proposition 2 B1's optimal volumes of deposits and loans are driven by\na tradeoff. On the one hand, offering more loans allows B1 to increase payment\nwhich, in turn increases expected profit \u00ad see arguments in section 3. On the\nother hand, in order to grant more loans B1 needs to take more deposits. Since\nlenders, however, are willing to buy additional deposits only if their expected utility\nincreases, B1 has to pay more TD0\n\u00ad see arguments of section 3. Optimality, then,\nappears when marginal profit from extending loan business just outweighs marginal\ncosts from taking more deposits.\nThis tradeoff is affected by the portfolio effect which occurs because of credit risk\ntransfer. In section 3 it has been shown that due to the payment R(\u00b7) of the CDS\nthe pdf of B1's earnings improves in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance.\nFrom the lenders' point of view this means that B1's loan business becomes less\nrisky. With risk aversion of lenders this portfolio effect reduces B1's cost of deposit\ntaking since less risk in granting loans allows to reduce risk premium for lenders. In\nother words, credit risk transfer reduces marginal cost of deposit taking. Hence, the\ntradeoff explained above results in more deposits and loans with credit risk transfer.\nThis, however, raises the question of the optimal level of credit risk transfer, ie the\noptimal underlying of the CDS contract needs to be determined. The examination\nof B1's optimization problem yields\nProposition 3 The optimal underlying of the CDS contract is the complete loan\nportfolio of B1.\nProof: See the appendix.\nThe reasons for this result are obvious if one considers the arguments presented\nin section 4.1 when the optimal CDS contract was examined. In particular, it has\nbeen argued that as long as s < k increasing s allows to increase R(\u00b7) and reduce\n. Both effects are beneficial to B1: increasing R(\u00b7) reinforces the risk reducing\neffect of credit risk transfer and reducing  makes using the CDS contract less\ncostly. Therefore, it is optimal to choose the largest underlying possible which is\nthe complete loan portfolio of B1.\nAt the end, we take a closer look at B2's optimal volumes of deposits and loans.\nIn this regard it is easy to see that due to lenders' participation constraint (6) B2\ncannot reduce the volume of deposits. If it did, lenders would suffer a loss of expected\nutility and would, hence, not longer be willing to accept deposit contracts. Due to\nl = e +  it is obvious that the premium from the CDS contract will be used to\nincrease loan granting. Therefore, with respect to B2 one can summarize:\nProposition 4 The protection seller's (B2) optimal volumes of deposits and loans\nincrease due to credit risk transfer.\n4.3 Results and Interpretations\nThe results presented in the previous sections allow for a number of very interesting\nconclusions and interpretations. In this regard it should, first, be noted that with\nProposition 3 one is able to refine the optimal CDS contract.\nProposition 5 In the optimum the payment function of the CDS contract is\nR(Yk\n, Xl\n) =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Yk\n); l(Xl\n) - (Yk\n, Xl\n)} if ()\nwith () = {Yk\n; Xl\n} and (Yk\n, Xl\nThat is, result 5 generalises and extends the main findings known from the lit-\nerature. In particular, the industrial organisation approach to banking states that\na full hedge is optimal only in a situation when there is no basis risk included in\na CDS contract. However, owing to the OTC-character of credit risk transfer the\npresent analysis could show that banks' rational behaviour prevents the appearance\nof basis risk. The optimal CDS contract always exhibits a perfect correlation with\nB1's exposure to credit risk. Therefore, a full hedge of B1's credit risk is optimal.\nFurthermore, from the inspection of Proposition 5 one observes that the default\nevent in the optimum is kTD0\n. That is, there is a CDS payment only in the event\nof B1 not being able to meet its depositors' claims. All variations in B1's profit\nexceeding this threshold are not covered by the CDS contract. Moreover, the CDS\npayment just covers the claims of B1's depositors. The effects of this kind of contract\ndesign are twofold. On the one hand it insures B1's depositors against losses, which\nallows a reduction of risk premia due to risk aversion, which, in turn, generates\nadditional profits for B1. On the other hand, the CDS contract generates no adverse\nincentives to B1. This is true since any positive level of profit still exposes B1\nto credit risk. Hence \u00ad while not explicitly modelled \u00ad B1 will not conduct any\nhazardous action such as reducing monitoring borrowers.\nKeeping in mind the arguments lined out in the previous sections, one is now able\nto derive a number of conclusions about the role and the effects of credit derivatives.\nThe optimal CDS contract implies the following relationship between both banks'\naverage outcomes from granting loans:\nXl\n= Xl\n+\nk\nl\nYk\n-\nk\nl\nYk\nor X = (X + Y ) - Y.\nThat is, the CDS contract in fact merges loan portfolios of both banks synthetically\nand defines how to share total outcome (X + Y ) among both banks. Thus, B1 (B2)\nactually receives Y (X). Moreover, realizations of X + Y increase compared with\nthe situation without credit risk transfer. The reason is that both banks increase\ntheir optimal volume of loans, which causes tK0\nto increase. However, this\ndoes not mean that, at the same time, banks are more exposed to credit risk than\nbefore they started to use CDS contracts. This can be seen from the cumulative\nprobability distribution function of actual outcomes from both banks' loan business.\nThe cumulative probability distribution function of B1's actual outcomes was\nshown to be\nH(Yk\n) =\nYk\nhYk\n(Yk\n)FR|Yk\n(k(Yk\n- Yk\n))dYk\nabove.12 Moreover, the conditional cumulative distribution function FR|Yk\n(\u00b7) may\nbe rewritten using the previous results as\n(k(Yk\n- Yk\n)) = W PD0\n+\nk\nl\n(Yk\n- Yk\n) =\nl\n(Yk-Yk)\nw(Xl\n)dXl\n.\nIn other words, the probability of R falling short of k(Yk\n- Yk\n) for given Yk\ncor-\nresponds to the probability of B2's outcome from loan business being less than\n+ k\nl\n(Yk\n- Yk\n). Hence, the probability distribution of B1's actual outcome Yk\nis\nderived from a convolution of random variables Yk\nand Xl\n, which causes a portfolio\neffect in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. That means the aggregate\nlevel of credit risk decreases due to credit risk transfer. Moreover, since the CDS\ncontract then allocates this reduced credit risk among banks, each bank faces a lower\nlevel of risk from granting loans. As a result, granting more loans does not increase\ncredit risk at all. This argument is further supported if one considers B2's earnings'\ncumulative probability distribution function:\nW(Xl\n) = 1 - H Yk\n-\nk\nl\n(Xl\n- Xl\n) .\nAs is obvious from this latter equation, the cumulative probability distribution func-\ntion of B2's outcome from granting loans is derived by calculating the convolution\nof probability distributions of Yk\nand Xl\n.\nA notable aspect in this regard is that, with the optimal CDS contract, credit\nrisk transfer becomes effective only in a well-defined set of situations. In particular,\na CDS payment R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > 0 appears if, and only if, Yk\nand, at the same\ntime, Xl\nholds. That is, at first a positive CDS payment requires B1 to be in\nfinancial difficulty and, second, B2 simultaneously has excess funds. Therefore, one\nmight conclude that credit risk transfer from B1 to B2 only appears in a situation\nwhen B2 is better able to absorb risk than B1, which undoubtedly enhances financial\nstability.\n5 Conclusion\nThe present paper analyzed the role of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) in banking\nin a model in which these instruments arise endogenously from optimizing behav-\nior of banks. For this purpose a cooperative Nash bargaining situation between\n12Note that we have used the result 3 when formulating this equation.\ntwo monopolistic banks was considered in order to account for the over-the-counter\ncharacter of CDS contracts. Both banks were, moreover, active in loan granting and\ndeposit taking in a market environment with a costly state verification problem.\nWith these assumptions the model also captures interdependencies between writing\na CDS contract on the one hand and decision making in banks' deposit and loan\nbusiness on the other.\nThe examination of the resulting three-stage game determined a very interesting\noptimal structure of the CDS contract. It has been shown that the risk buyer\nonly pays a pre-specified amount to the risk seller, when the latter's funds are\ninsufficient to meet own depositors' claims. Moreover, the payment of the risk buyer\nexactly covers the difference between the risk seller's funds and his depositors' claims.\nHowever, counterparty risk \u00ad that is, the risk that the risk buyer is not able to make\nthis payment \u00ad prevents that this optimal payment is made at any time. Therefore,\nthe optimal up-front premium of the CDS contract needs to be adjusted adequately.\nFurthermore, in the model it has been derived that by using CDS contracts both\nbanks' loan granting and deposit taking activities are extended. The reason for\nthis is, that with an optimal CDS contract both banks synthetically merge their\nloan portfolios. This creates a portfolio effect which reduces a bank's probability to\nrealize low outcomes from the loan business. As a result, the probability of both\nbanks' depositors claims being met increases. This reduces funding costs of both\nbanks and allows them to expand loan granting and deposit taking activities. Hence,\ncredit risk transfer with credit derivatives is valuable.\nHowever, while these results are quite encouraging it should be noted that the\nmodel of the present paper abstracts from important aspects of the real market en-\nvironment. The two banks in the model, for example, are local monopolists. Hence,\nthere are no forces of competition which might affect banks' behavior in both loan\nand deposit business and credit risk transfer. But Pausch and Schweimayer (2004)\nargue in their industrial organization approach with exogenous credit derivatives\nthat banks might use derivatives as strategic device in competition for borrowers\nand lenders. Nevertheless, against the background of the results in the present pa-\nper a more realistic model with endogenous markets for credit risk transfer might\nhelp better understand issues in this regard.\nAnother useful extension of the present model would be to consider asymmetric\ninformation between participants in credit risk transfer. The recent literature sug-\ngests that this might be a very important issue. For example Morrison (2005) and\nParlour and Plantin (2005) examine questions in this regard. However, in their pa-\npers credit derivatives are, again, exogenous which captures just part of the relevant\neffects.\nNevertheless, from an empirical point of view recent descriptive data from CDS\nmarkets seem to support the main results of the present paper. That is, besides the\nsteadily increasing nominal amount of CDS contracts outstanding one can observe,\nin particular, growing relevance of portfolio credit default swaps. In addition, banks\nwhich participate in credit risk transfer expanded their loan granting activities.\nUnfortunately, due to reasons of data availability one is not able at present to\nperform a more detailed empirical analysis. This is particularly true with respect\nto an examination of banks' total exposure to credit risk after participating in CDS\nmarkets.\nTo sum up, the considerations of the present paper provide a number of important\ninsights into the nature and the role of credit derivatives. The conclusions are\nunambiguous since by endogenizing the formation of credit derivatives one is able\nto trade off diversification effects on the one hand and banks' risk taking behavior\non the other. In this way, the present paper makes a first attempt to close a gap\nin the recent literature on credit risk transfer and credit derivatives. However, as\nis obvious from the discussion above, there is still a number of important aspects\nwhich are not analyzed in sufficient detail. Hence, further research on these issues\nis necessary.\nAppendix\nProof of Proposition 1\nIn order to derive the optimal CDS contract, at first, expected profits of both banks\nneed to be formulated appropriately:\n) = Yk\n(, R(\u00b7)) - TD0\n(, R(\u00b7)) -\nYk(,R(\u00b7))\nTD0(,R(\u00b7))\nH(Yk\n)dYk\n() -\nW(Xl\n)dXl\nwhere Xl\nl\n(X - R(Ys\n, Xl\n)) with corresponding cdf\nW(l\n) =\nYs\nhs\n(Ys\n) 1 - FR|Ys\n(l(Xl\n- l\n)) dYs\n.\nMoreover, hs\n(\u00b7) denotes the pdf of the realizations of the outcome of the CDS's\nunderlying. In addition, in the following Hs\n(\u00b7) represents the cdf of the returns from\nthe part of B1's loan portfolio which is not included in the underlying of the CDS.\nThe following arguments consider the fact that constraint (15) of the maximiza-\ntion problem for the optimal CDS is not binding. It is easily verified that otherwise\nB2 were not able to earn any positive profit and were, hence, worse off compared to\nnon-participating in CDS. Using this observation, first-order necessary conditions\nfor an optimal CDS are\n\n))\n\n))\n=\n)]\n)]\nR(Ys,Xl)\n))\nhs\n(Ys\n) \nR(Ys,Xl)\n(R(Ys\n, Xl\n))\n+\n+\nYk\nHs\n(kYk\n- (Ys\n+ R(Ys\n, Xl\n)))dYk\n\n)]\n)]\n R(Ys\n, Xl\nThe first step of the proof shows Ys\n+ R(Ys\n, Xl\n R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > 0. For\nthis purpose consider realizations (Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n) and (Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n) with R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n) = arg max Ys\n+ R(Ys\n, Xl\n)  R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > 0. If in this situation\n< Y b\ns\n+ R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n) < Y m\ns\n+ R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n)\nwould hold, it is obvious from condition (24) that\nYk\nHs\n(kYk\n- (Y m\ns\n+ R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n)))dYk\n=\nYk\nHs\n(kYk\n- (Y b\ns\n+ R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n)))dYk\nneeds to be true. This, however, is impossible since\nkYk\n- (k - s)tK0\n- (Y b\ns\n+ R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\nimplies\nYk\nHs\n(kYk\n- (Y m\ns\n+ R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n)))dYk\n<\nYk\nHs\n(kYk\n- (Y b\ns\n+ R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n)))dYk\n\u00ad a contradiction. Therefore, in the optimum it must be true that Ys\n+ R(Ys\n, Xl\n) \n R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > 0 holds.\nThis result may be extended to Ys\n+R(Ys\n, Xl\n R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > 0 since there\nmay be a difference between k and s. And, indeed, for the situation stK0\nthis\nfollows immediately from arguments above. In the situation stK0\n, however,\narguments need to be modified. If one defines (Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n) and (Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n) just like in\nthe previous case it might be asked whether a situation\n< Y b\ns\n+ R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n) < Y m\ns\n+ R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\nwith R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n) > 0 and R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n) > 0 may occur. If this was the case, one finds\nfor the second-line terms of (24)\nYk\nHs\n(kYk\n- (Y m\ns\n+ R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n)))dYk\n<\nYk\nHs\n(kYk\n- (Y b\ns\n+ R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n)))dYk\nwhich is the same as in the previous situation. Furthermore, with replacing TD0\nR(\u00b7)\nin\nfirst-line terms of (24) by expressions derived from applying the implicit function\ntheorem to lenders' participation constraints (5), one finds\nR(Y m\ns\n,Xm\nl\n)\n))\nhs\n(Y m\ns\n) \nR(Y m\ns\n,Xm\nl\n)\n(R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n))\n\nR(Y b\ns\n,Xb\nl\n)\n))\nhs\n(Y b\ns\n) \nR(Y b\ns\n,Xb\nl\n)\n(R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n))\n.\nSince it is obvious from above relationships that in the present situation R(Y m\ns\n, Xm\nl\n)\nand R(Y b\ns\n, Xb\nl\n) cannot satisfy first-order necessary conditions (24) simultaneously, it\nmust be true that \u00ad considering the earlier result \u00ad in an optimal CDS\nYs\n+ R(Ys\n, Xl\n)  min{stK0\n}  R(Ys\n, Xl\nMoreover, from the arguments presented above it becomes immediately clear that\nYs\n+ R(Ys\n, Xl\n) = min{stK0\n}  R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > 0 and (Ys\n, Xl\n)\nmust hold. Otherwise, first order necessary conditions (24) were not satisfied by\nall optimal payments R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > 0 simultaneously. However, in the case that\ncounterparty risk is striking, ie R(Ys\n, Xl\n) > l(Xl\n), B2 is not able to pay the\noptimal payment. But from above arguments it is obvious that B2 will pay as much\nas possible in this situation. That is, B2's retained funds approach zero in this case:\n(Ys\n(Xl\n), Xl\nProof of Proposition 2\nTo prove Proposition 2 maximization problem (20) is solved using the definition of\n) in the proof of Proposition 1.\nThe first-order necessary condition for optimal k, then, is\n-\n\n\nk\n+\n\n\nk\n+\n(Ys,Xl)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n\n))-\n-\n\n\nH(Yk\n)\nk\n+\n(Ys,Xl)\nH(Yk\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n\n dYk\n+\n\nk\nNow, let k denote the optimal volume of loans when B1 enters the CDS contract\nand k the optimal volume of loans when there is no credit risk transfer. Suppose\nk < k , then for the first-order necessary condition one yields\n-\n\n\nk\n|k\n+\n\n\nk\n|k\n+\n(Ys,Xl)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n|k\n\n))-\n-\n\n\nH(Yk\n)\nk\n|k\n+\n(Ys,Xl)\nH(Yk\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n|k\n\n dYk\n+\n\nk\n|k\nIn this latter equation replace TD0\nk\n\nby the terms which can be derived\nfrom applying the implicit function theorem to lenders' participation constraint (5).\nRearranging terms, then, yields\n(Yk\n)])\nk\n|k\n+\n(Yk\n)])\n\n\nk\n|k\n-\n-\n(Ys,Xl)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n|k\n))-\n-\n\n\nH(Yk\n)\nk\n|k\n+\n(Ys,Xl)\nH(Yk\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n|k\n\n dYk\n+\n+\n\nk\n|k\nIn this latter inequation the last line diminishes since KG1\nare al-\nways the same. Moreover, from the arguments presented in section 3 above it is\nwell known that in the optimum R(Ys,Xl)\nk\n|k\n, Xl\n), \nk\n|k\n\nk\n(Yk\n\n(Yk\nR(Ys,Xl)\n, Xl\n), \nR(Ys,Xl)\nH(Yk\n) \nk\nH(Yk\n)|k\n 0. Therefore, one derives\n(Yk\n)])\nk\n|k\n+\n(Yk\n)])\n\n\nk\n|k\n-\n-\n(Ys,Xl)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n|k\n-\n-\n\n\nH(Yk\n)\nk\n|k\n+\n(Ys,Xl)\nH(Yk\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nk\n|k\n\nwhich contradicts first-order necessary condition above. Hence in the optimum\nk  k must be true. Furthermore, from this result and d = k +  it is obvious that\n > 0 implies a strictly increasing optimal volume of deposits due to credit risk\ntransfer.\nProof of Proposition 3\nFrom optimization problem (20) one can derive the first-order necessary condition\nfor the optimal s\n-\n\n\n\n\ns\n+\n(Ys,Xl)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\ns\n\n -\n-\nTD0 (Ys,Xl)\nH(Yk\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\nR(Ys\n, Xl\n)\ns\ndYk\nwhere we have used the fact that Proposition 2 implies that the participation con-\nstraint is not binding.\nFrom this latter equation, it can be easily shown that s < k cannot be an optimal\nsolution. The reason is that, owing to TD0\n\nR(Ys,Xl)\nR(Ys,Xl)\n) > 0 both terms on the left hand side of the equation are positive with\ns < k. Moreover, since any s > k does not create a further effect of first-order\nstochastic dominance, any CDS contract with s > k needs to include the same\npayments R(\u00b7) and premium  as does a contract with s = k. Therefore, the\noptimal underlying covers the complete loan portfolio of B1.\nReferences\nBlazenko, G. (1986), The Economics of Reinsurance, Journal of Risk and Insurance\nBorch, K.
