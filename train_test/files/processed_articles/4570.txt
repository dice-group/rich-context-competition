Will the child be a doctor, a football player, or\nperhaps the next president of the United States? Then suddenly, parents are bombarded\nwith a thought that may send a shiver down their spine: the realization that their child will\none day want to date someone they don't like. Indeed, meeting children's potential partners\ncan be a tumultuous time for parents and children as parents may not agree with their\nchildren's choice of partner. This type of conflict has permeated our popular culture\nthrough the medium of literature (Romeo and Juliet), film (Meet the Parents and Shrek II),\nand reality television (MTV's Parental Control). The conflict has also engaged the minds\nof researchers, in particular those in the behavioral and social sciences, and most recently,\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nit has caught the attention of evolutionary psychologists who wish to explain the ultimate\norigins of this behavior and to expand our knowledge of human mating strategies.\nThe potential of parent-offspring conflict over mate choice was demonstrated in a\nseries of studies by Buunk, Park, and Dubbs (2008), who showed that parents and children\nare not in complete agreement over what type of person would be an ideal partner.\nAlthough there is considerable overlap between parents and children in preferences, for\nexample, both parents and children may ideally prefer a partner for their child who is\nintelligent and kind, the key is that the preferences are not identical. The research\nconducted by Buunk et al. (2008) was aimed at exposing these potential conflicts and found\nthat children perceive that their parents would prefer themselves (the child) to have a mate\nwith traits indicating high parental investment and cooperation with the ingroup, whereas\nchildren tend to prefer mates with traits indicating heritable (genetic) quality. For example,\nparticipants (children) indicated that traits connoting a lack of genetic quality, such as being\nphysically unattractive, lacking a sense of humor, and lacking creativity, were significantly\nmore unacceptable to themselves compared to their parents. Conversely, traits connoting a\nlack of parental investment or cooperation with the ingroup, such as different ethnicity,\nbeing divorced, and coming from a lower social class than self, were indicated by\nparticipants as being significantly more unacceptable to their parents. These results have\nbeen replicated in culturally diverse samples from the United States, Kurdistan, Iraq, the\nNetherlands, and a sample of international students studying in the Netherlands. Since then,\nsamples from Uruguay (Park, Dubbs, and Buunk, 2009) and Argentina (Buunk and Castro\nSolano, 2010) have also confirmed these results. In accordance with the above research,\nApostolou (2007b, 2008a,b) found that people have differing preferences for mates and in-\nlaws. Physical attractiveness was a more highly desired quality in a mate than it was for an\nin-law and having a good family background was highly desired for an in-law than it was\nfor a mate.\nThe limitation of the previous studies conducted by Buunk et al. (2008), Park et al.\n(2009), and Buunk and Castro Solano (2010) was that the samples were composed of\nyoung adults who indicated whether given negative characteristics would be more\nunacceptable to themselves or to their parents. In order to establish that parents also\nperceive a potential conflict with their children over the mate choice of the latter, it is\nnecessary to replicate the previous findings with a sample of parents who have children of\nmating age. Confirmation of the previous results will further support the existence of a\nparent-offspring conflict over mate choice. It was predicted that parents will find\ncharacteristics connoting a lack of genetic quality as being more unacceptable to their child.\nConversely, parents will find characteristics connoting a lack of parental investment and\ncooperation with the ingroup as being more unacceptable to themselves.\nThe reason for why parents and children have differential mate preferences can be\nexplained with the help of two theories: parent-offspring conflict (Trivers, 1974) and\nevolutionary trade-offs (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000). While parents and children share\napproximately half of their genes, they do not always share the same genetic interests.\nUnder the right conditions, it pays individuals to follow a selfish strategy, even if this is to\nthe detriment of their parents and siblings. Hence, parents and children should develop\ndifferent behavioral strategies that maximize benefits and minimize costs to their own\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nadvantage. A common example of parent-offspring conflict in mammals occurs during\nweaning. Since lactation is costly, and because a mother might have other offspring to care\nfor or because she cannot reproduce again until their existing offspring are weaned, a\nmother ideally would prefer to wean her offspring relatively early. Even though this\nstrategy may benefit the mother, it represents a cost to the offspring since it will no longer\nbe able to take advantage of an easily obtained source of nutrients. Ideally, the offspring\nwould prefer to prolong nursing even though it is a cost to the mother and other siblings.\nAs noted by Trivers (1974), this phenomenon of parent-offspring conflict may be extended\nfurther to include the mate choice of children. In humans, one type of mate, with a\nparticular set of characteristics, might benefit the offspring more than the parents, whereas\nanother type of mate, with a different set of characteristics, might benefit the parents more\nthan the offspring.\nThe key to which type of a mate choice would benefit a parent or a child more rests\nin the theory of evolutionary trade-offs (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000). Effectively, a\nchild who mates with an individual high in genetic quality benefits by delivering genetic\nquality to their offspring. However, because genetic quality and parental effort tend to\ntrade-off with each other (e.g. individuals higher in genetic quality tend to invest less in\nparental effort), the child runs the risk of having a low investing partner (Buss and Schmitt,\n1993; Gangestad and Thornhill, 1997). This can lead to the child needing extra support\nfrom its parents in order to sustain themselves and the child's offspring. Relying on the\nparents for support is, of course, much more costly to the parents than it is for the child.\nParents, who would ideally like to distribute their resources evenly to all offspring, would\nsee this as detrimental to their other children and grandchildren. If the child would instead\nhave opted for a partner with traits indicating high parental investment (lower genetic\nquality), then the parents would not need to invest extra resources into their child and\ngrandchildren. This strategy is more beneficial to the parents, but can be costly to the child.\nIt is also important to note that the difference between the mate preferences (for the\nchild's mate) of parents and children is not simply due to a generational effect or an effect\nof mate preferences changing as one grows older. Buunk and Castro Solano (2010) found\nthat the degree of parent-offspring conflict was larger for older children. This is the\nopposite pattern one would expect if parent-offspring conflict was due to a shift in mate\npreferences. Further more, research from Apostolou (2008a) showed that a sample of\nparents preferred different traits for an ideal mate compared to an ideal in-law. Participants\nrated beauty as being significantly more important for a spouse. Thus, differences found\nbetween children and parents when indicating their preferences for a child's mate likely\nreflect the differential costs and benefits for children and parents.\nSex differences between mothers and fathers will also be explored. Previous\nresearch on parent-offspring conflict over mate choice has failed to find sex differences in\nthe preferences that parents have for their in-laws (Apostolou, 2007b). That is, fathers and\nmothers rank which characteristics they preferred for an in-law similarly. However, due to\nthe different life history strategies of men and women, it is worth re-examining. For\ninstance, mothers are more highly invested (Trivers, 1972) in as well as more certain of\ntheir genetic relatedness to their children than are fathers (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; DeKay,\n1995; Euler and Weitzal, 1996). Unlike men, women also under go menopause and lose\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\ntheir ability to reproduce directly (Timiras and Valcana, 1972). Because of these\ndifferences, mothers tend to play a larger role in the lives of their children, including their\nchildren's romantic lives (Bates, 1942; Faulkner and Schaller, 2007) as well grandparenting\n(Laham, Gonsalkorale, and von Hippel, 2005; Michalski and Shackelford, 2005). Fathers\non the other hand, appear to use more direct methods of control their children's mate choice\n(Bates, 1942) and there are several examples in which fathers simply marry off their\ndaughters to the wealthiest men in order to build alliances or gain social status (Chagnon,\n1992; Shadle, 2003). Based on these sex differences, it is possible that sex differences may\nexist between mothers and fathers in the unacceptability of the negative traits however, no\nprediction is made in either direction.\nThe sex of the child may also dictate how unacceptable parents find undesirable\ncharacteristics and the potential for parent-offspring conflict. It is well established that\nparents are more concerned about their daughter's mating decisions. For example, parents\ntend to set more restrictions concerning dating and give daughters less freedom of choice to\nchoose their own partner than sons (Faulkner and Schaller, 2007; Perilloux, Fleischman and\nBuss, 2008; Wight and Henderson, 2006). The reason is that making a poor quality mate\nchoice is more detrimental for women, and because parents can be certain that\ngrandchildren from a daughter are actually genetically related. Thus, it is predicted that if\ndifferences based on the sex of the parent's child exist, then parents will find undesirable\ncharacteristics in a child's mate choice as being more unacceptable if they have a daughter\nrather than a son. Additionally, since the trade-off between parental quality and genetic\nquality is more pronounced for women than men, it is predicted that our measure, potential\nfor parent-offspring conflict score, will be greater for parents of daughters.\nLastly, we will examine if there are differences between people who are affiliated\nwith a religious group (i.e., Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, etc.) and those to who are not\n(i.e., atheist, agnostic, spiritual, etc.). Since religion is a marker of group identity, it is\npossible that people who identify with a religious group might be more concerned about\ntraits which indicate cooperation with the ingroup, for example such parents may find\nhaving different religious beliefs or a different ethnic background, as more unacceptable\ncompared to those who do not.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nreligious background of the participants was 42% Catholic, 34.8% atheist/agnostic/non-\nreligious, 17.3% Protestant, .6% Muslim, .2 % Jewish, and other 5.1%. The questionnaire\nwas conducted in Dutch and was administered by Flycatcher, an independent research\nagency that conducts online survey collection in samples representative of the Dutch\npopulation. Participants are rewarded for completing a questionnaire, including our own, by\nreceiving a credit for an online store. Flycatcher has a data-base of potential participants\nand we were able to specify the exact type of participant that we wanted to include in our\nstudy. We requested an equal ratio of men and women, none of the participants to be\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nmarried to each other, and for each participant to have an eldest child between the ages of\n15 to 25. We chose this age range, 15 to 25, for a couple reasons. The average age of\nmarriage in the Netherlands is 31.7 and 29.2 for men and women respectively (Eurosat,\n2008), however, the frequency of cohabitation is high and a high percentage of women,\nbegin to think about or have already begun to date. Thus, 15 to 25 seemed liked a\nreasonable age range to use for the study.\nProcedure\nA shortened version of the parent-offspring conflict over mate choice questionnaire\nused in this study was based upon that used in previous studies (Buunk et al., 2008; Buunk\nand Castro Solano, 2010; Park et al., 2009). From the original studies, six traits that were\nconsistently shown to be unacceptable to the child (physically unattractive, physically unfit,\noverweight, bad smell, lacks creativity, and lacks a sense of humor) and the six traits that\nwere consistently shown to be unacceptable the parents (bad family background, lower\nsocial class than self, different ethnic background, different religious beliefs, divorced, and\npoor) across the five samples were retained. Thus, the questionnaire contained 12-items,\nsix traits indicating poor genetic quality and six traits indicating a lack of parental\ninvestment and cooperation with the ingroup. All traits were formulated to represent the\nundesirable variant of trait variables (i.e., physically unattractive, different religious\nbeliefs). Each question was posed in the following manner: If my child's potential partner\nwas [physically unattractive], this would be... followed by a 7-point scale on which the\npossible answers ranged from (1) Much more unacceptable to Myself [parent] through\n(4) Equally unacceptable to both Myself and my Child to (7) Much more unacceptable\nto my Child. Participants were instructed to answer the following questions keeping in\nmind their eldest child. The children of the participants included 239 sons (mean age =\nAnalysis\nAll 12 traits were compared to the total mean using a non-directional one-sample t-\ntest to see if they differed significantly from the mean in the direction of the child or parent.\nNext, mean scores for the six traits indicating poor genetic quality and for the six traits\nindicating a lack of parental investment/cooperation were calculated. A paired t-test was\nconducted to see if the two means differed significantly from each other in the predicted\ndirection of the child or parent respectively. A non-directional one-sample t-test was also\nconducted on these two means to see if they significantly differed from the total mean of all\n12 characteristics in the predicted direction.\nSex differences between mothers and father as well as sons and daughters were\nexamined next. A MANOVA was conducted on the 12 individual traits to see if there was a\nmain effect of the participant's sex, the sex of their child, and if their were any interactions.\nA new measure was also calculated--the potential for parent-offspring conflict score--\nbased on the measurement in Buunk and Castro Solano (2010). The potential for parent-\noffspring conflict score was calculated by subtracting the score of each individual trait from\nthe scale midpoint of 4 and then taking the absolute value. By doing this, we could look at\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nhow each individual trait varied from the scale midpoint. A higher value indicates that a\ngiven trait deviates more from the middle of the scale, and thus, the trait may represent a\ngreater source of conflict between parents and offspring. A mean score was calculated for\nall 12 traits combined. The potential for parent-offspring conflict score was also included in\nthe MANOVA to see if there was a main effect of the participant's sex, the sex of their\nchild, and if there were any interactions.\nLastly, a one-way ANOVA between people who belong to an organized religion\n(Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, etc.) versus people who do not (non-religious, agonistic,\natheist, spiritual, etc.) was conducted on the mean of the six traits indicating poor genetic\nquality and the mean of the six traits indicating a lack of parental investment/cooperation.\nResults\nParent vs. child\nThe mean score for the 12 items was 3.94, which we used as the comparison point.\nThis allowed our results to be comparable with previous studies (see Buunk et al., 2008).\nWe conducted a non-directional one sample t-test on all 12 of the traits to see if they varied\nfrom the total mean in the predicted direction, either towards the parent or the child. Table\n1 lists the results of the t-tests. Values higher than 3.94 indicate that a trait has a relatively\nhigher degree of unacceptability to the child, and values lower than 3.94 indicate that it has\na relatively higher degree of unacceptability to the parents. As displayed in Table 1, four\nout of the six traits indicating poor genetic quality were found to be significantly different\nfrom the mean in the direction of the child. For the traits indicating a lack of parental\ninvestment/cooperation, five out of the six of the items were found to be significantly\ndifferent from the mean in the direction of the parent. When examining all 12 traits, the two\nthat were found to be the most unacceptable to the child were physically unattractive and\noverweight. The traits that parents found to be most unacceptable were different ethnic\nbackground and divorced.\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nTable 1. Mean Levels of Unacceptability of Characteristics to Self versus Child\nCharacteristics\nhypothesized to be\nmore unacceptable to\nthe child Mean (SD)\nCharacteristics\nhypothesized to be\nmore unacceptable to\nthe parent Mean (SD)\nPhysically\nunattractive\nLacks a good family\nbackground\nDifferent ethnic\nbackground\nLower social class\nthan self\nDifferent religious\nbeliefs\nLacks a sense of\nhumor\nNote: Lower values indicate greater unacceptability to the parents and higher values\nindicate greater unacceptability the child; asterisks indicate significant differences from the\nmean score for all 12 items (3.94) in the predicted direction: * p  .05, ** p  .01, *** p \nNext, a mean score was computed for traits indicating poor genetic quality (M =\n4.07, Cronbach's alpha = .73) and for traits indicating a lack of parental\ninvestment/cooperation (M = 3.82, Cronbach's alpha = .82). These two means differed\nsignificantly from each other in the predicted direction, t(473) = 6.38, p < .001, and they\nalso differed significantly from the sample mean of 3.94. That is, the mean of the traits\nindicating poor genetic quality varied significantly from the sample mean, t(473)= 3.28, p =\n.001, in the direction of the child; the mean of the six traits indicating a lack of parental\ninvestment/cooperation significantly varied from the sample mean, t(473) = -3.27, p = .001,\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nin the direction of the parent. Thus, overall, the hypothesis received strong support; parents\nregarded the six traits indicating poor genetic quality as being more unacceptable to their\nchild and six traits indicating a lack of parental investment/cooperation as being more\nunacceptable to themselves.\nSex differences\nThe MANOVA on each of the 12 individual traits and the potential for parent-\noffspring conflict score using the participant's sex and sex of the child as fixed factors,\nfound minor sex differences. To correct for multiple testing, the Bonferroni correction for\nalpha inflation reduced the level of significance to .004. Overall the sex of the parent had\nlittle to no effect on the unacceptability of the negative traits and the potential for parent-\noffspring conflict score. The only exception was for fathers who significantly rated the trait\nlacks a sense of humor as being more unacceptable to themselves than did mothers, F(1,\nthe child did have an effect on the unacceptability of a few traits; however the p-values\nwere higher than the Bonferroni correction of .004. The traits that were found by parents to\nbe more unacceptable for a daughter were different religious beliefs F(1,470) = 6.70, p\n=1.31). The sex of the child also produced a significant difference in the potential for\nconflict score (M =.70, SD =.57), with parents of females having a higher potential parent-\n= .53; female M = .78, SD = .61). There were no interactions between the sex of the parent\nand the sex of the child.\nReligious affiliation\nThe one-way ANOVA conducted on parents who identify themselves as belonging\nto an organized religion (Catholic, Christian, Muslim, etc.) versus those who do not (non-\nreligious, agonistic, atheist, spiritual, etc.) produced a significant main effect. People who\nidentify themselves as belonging to an organized religion, compared to those who do not,\nhave a significantly lower mean for the six traits indicating parental investment/\nThis indicates that parents who belong to an organized religion view negative traits\nreflecting a lack of parental investment and cooperation with the ingroup as being more\nunacceptable in a child's romantic partner than parents who do not belong to an organized\nreligion.\nDiscussion\nKin, in particular the parents, play a large role in mating decisions of humans. In\norder to gain a more complete understanding of how human mating decisions are made, it\nis important to explore the preferences of the individuals who influence our choices,\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nnamely the parents. Using the same methodology as past studies, which was specifically\ndesigned to uncover the potential sources of conflict between parents and children (Buunk\nhypothesis that children may especially prefer partners with traits connoting genetic quality\nwhereas parents may especially prefer a child's partner to have traits connoting parental\ninvestment and cooperation with the ingroup. Overall, the results from this study, which\nused a sample of parents, confirmed those from our previous studies. This was a\nparticularly important finding as our previous studies only contained samples of children\nwho were of mating age. Taken together, the existence of a parent-offspring conflict over\nmate choice is more strongly supported.\nThe mean of the six traits indicating a lack of genetic quality (physically\nunattractive, overweight, physically unfit, lacks creativity, bad smell, and lacks a sense of\nhumor) and the mean of the six traits connoting a lack of parental investment and\ncooperation with the ingroup (lacks a good family background, different ethnic\nbackground, divorced, lower social class than self, different religious beliefs, and poor),\ndiffered significantly from each other and also from the mean of all 12 items in the\npredicted directions. That is, when combined, the traits indicating a lack of genetic quality\nwere found to be significantly more unacceptable to the child, while the traits indicating a\nlack of parental investment and cooperation with the ingroup were found to be more\nunacceptable to the parent (the participant). Individually, four traits out of the six indicating\na lack of genetic quality were significantly different from the mean in the direction of the\nchild. These traits include physically unattractive, overweight, physically unfit, and lacks\ncreativity. Lacks a sense of humor and bad smell did not differ from the mean in either\ndirection. The reason might be that fathers tend to value a sense of humor. Indeed, when\nexamining the individual traits, fathers in this study significantly rated lacks a sense of\nhumor as being more unacceptable to themselves while mothers rated it as being more\nunacceptable to their child. In past studies, lacks a sense of humor was rated as being one\nof the most unacceptable traits across nearly all of the samples (Buunk et al., 2008; Buunk\nand Castro Solano, 2010; Park et al., 2009). Thus having a sense of humor might not only\nindicate a trait that has been sexually selected for, but also one that men in particular use to\nbond with kin and perhaps in-laws.\nOf the six traits indicating a lack of parental investment and cooperation with the\ningroup, four produced a statistically significant difference from the mean in the direction\nof the parents. These traits included lacks a good family background, different ethnic\nbackground, divorced, and lower social class than self. Having different religious beliefs\nwas marginally significant in the direction of the parents. In the child samples, this trait was\nfound to be significantly more unacceptable to the parents. One reason for why it was only\nmarginally significant in this study may be due to the high degree of secularism in the\nDutch population. In our sample 34.8% of the participants reported being agnostic, atheist,\nor non-religious. Additionally, the mean religiosity of the sample was 2.82 (SD = 1.72) on a\nscale ranging from 1 (not at all religious) to 7 (very religious). Other studies reveal that\nhaving same religious beliefs is often an important basis for marriage (Dugsin, 2001;\nRobinson, 1980; Talbani and Hasanali, 2000). However, in spite of the fact that the\nNetherlands is a highly secular country, we were able to still find an effect in the predicted\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\ndirection. The trait poor, on the other hand, did not produce a significant result in either\ndirection.\nOn a related note, parents that reported belonging to an organized religion\n(Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, etc.) found the six traits indicating a lack of parental\ninvestment and cooperation with the ingroup as being more unacceptable in a child's\npotential romantic partner than did parents who do not belong to an organized religion.\nThis makes sense, as people who identify with a group are probably more likely to want\ntheir child to choose partners who are from the ingroup. Research, in particular on South\nAsians, is consistent with these results in that parents want their children to marry someone\nwho is of the same religion, language, ethnicity, and caste (Das Gupta, 1997; Netting,\nIn addition to complimenting the results from the child samples, the data was also\nused to explore sex differences between mothers and fathers as well as sons and daughters.\nThe potential for parent-offspring conflict score, which measures the degree to which the\nindividual traits deviate from the mid-point, was also included in the examination of sex\ndifferences. There was almost no effect of the sex of the parent on the unacceptability of\ntraits in a child's potential mate choice, which is accordance with results from Apostolou\n(2007b). However, the sex of the parent's child did have a small effect. Parents tended to\nrate the traits different ethnic background, different religious beliefs, and divorced in a\nchild's potential partner as more unacceptable to themselves when their child was female\nrather than male. Additionally, the potential for parent-offspring conflict score was higher\nfor parents of females than for parents of males. It should be noted that caution needs to be\ntaken in interpreting the potential for parent-offspring conflict score, as deviation from the\nmid-point may or may not indicate that a trait is a source of conflict between parents and\nchildren. However, we feel in this case that it may represent a potential for more conflict,\nas there was a greater tendency for parents to rate certain traits as being more unacceptable\nfor females than males. Overall, these results fit the idea that parents more highly guard\ndaughters and set more restricts concerning dating compared to sons (Dugsin, 2001;\nAlthough the results largely support those from previous studies, there are some\nimportant limitations of our study. To begin with, parents in our study were instructed to\nthink of their first born child, therefore the results might not be generalizable to later born\nchildren. Secondly, the study is self-report and measures parent's perceptions of how their\npreferences for their child's mate choice may differ from those of their children. Given this,\nthe results found in our study may not actually reflect the differences in the preferences that\nparents have for their in-laws and children have for their mate choice. However, since the\nresults are consistent with those from the previous child samples (Buunk and Castro Solano\nin-laws and mate choice (Apostolou, 2007b, 2008a,b), we feel that our study does tap into\nthe differential preferences parents and children have for the mate choice of the latter.\nThirdly, perhaps due to the design of our study, we failed to find sex differences between\nfathers and mothers. We feel that there are theoretical reasons for differences to exist, and\nalthough differences between fathers and mothers may be subtle, we encourage researchers\nto continue to investigate this issue.\nParent-offspring conflict over mate choice\nOverall these findings are consistent with our previous research, other research\nconcerning parental influence, and also with the observed sex differences in the treatment\nof sons and daughters. Although, this study adds to the growing knowledge on parental\ninfluence of mate choice, it also generates more questions. How do parents influence their\nchildren's mate choice and do children have ways to either counter or manipulate their\nparents to their own means? Even though our study, as well as previous studies (Apostolou\n2007b) failed to find sex differences between mothers and fathers in their preferences for\nthe mate choice of their child, there might be differences in the way that each attempts to\ninfluence there child's mate choice. This should be explored. Is there another type of\nparent-offspring conflict between sons and their parents concerning the right time to settle\ndown? Results from Apostolou (2009) using parent-child dyads reveal that there is a\nparent-offspring conflict over whether a child should engage in a short-term or long-term\nmating strategy. As one can see, parental influence over mate choice is in a nascent state\nand more research will help draw a more complete picture of human mating behavior.\nReferences\nApostolou, M. (2007a).
