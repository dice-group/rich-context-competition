Despite substantial growth\nin the elderly population (from 26.9 mil-\nnumber of chronically disabled Ameri-\ncans 65 years or older has decreased from\n7.1 million to 7.0 million, leading to a rela-\ntive reduction of nearly 25%. Although\nthese important findings have been widely\ntrumpeted in the medical literature4-6 and\nthe lay press,7 relatively little attention has\nbeen given to how chronic disability was\nactually assessed. Previous research has\nshown that estimates of disability differ\nconsiderably across national surveys for a\nvariety of reasons, including differences in\nthe way that disability is assessed.8-10\nIn the National Long-Term Care Sur-\nvey, a chronic disability has been defined\nas a disability lasting or expected to last\nat least 90 days.1-3 For a series of essential\nand instrumental activities of daily liv-\ning, persons indicating that they need help\n(from another person or special equip-\nment) are subsequently asked whether\nthey have needed help for 3 months or\nlonger, expect to need help for the next 3\nmonths or longer, or will have needed help\nfor 3 months or longer from beginning to\nend. Because it is uncertain whether el-\nderly persons can accurately recall the ex-\nact onset of their disability, especially over\nan extended period of time, or can esti-\nmate the future duration of their disabil-\nity, we decided to formally evaluate the va-\nlidity of this protocol for ascertaining\nchronic disability.\nTo accomplish this objective, we used\ndata from a unique longitudinal study that\nincludes monthly assessments of disability\nin activities of daily living from a large co-\nhort of elderly persons.11,12 We postulated\nthat the protocol established by the Na-\ntional Long-Term Care Survey, which was\nimplementedforthefirsttimeduringacom-\nprehensiveassessmentat54months,would\nlead to estimates of chronic disability that\nare inaccurate when compared with esti-\nAuthor Affiliations:\nDepartment of Internal\nMedicine, Yale University\nSchool of Medicine,\nNew Haven, Conn.\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

Participants completed comprehen-\nsive assessments at 18-month intervals and monthly tele-\nphone interviews for the ascertainment of disability. The study\nprotocol was approved by the Yale Human Investigation Com-\nmittee, and all participants provided verbal informed consent.\nThe analytic sample for the current study included partici-\npants who completed the comprehensive assessment at 54\nthe study after a median follow-up period of 22 months. Of the\nremaining 561 participants, 3 (0.5%) refused to complete the\nassessment, and 6 (1.1%) had incomplete information on their\ndisability status, leaving 552 participants in the analytic sample.\nCompared with these participants, the 202 cohort members who\nwere not included in the analytic sample were (at baseline) older\nThere were no significant baseline differences according to race\nor ethnicity, living situation, education, or cognitive status.\nThe research nurses who completed the 54-month assessments\nwere kept blinded to the results of the monthly assessments. As\ndescribed in 2 earlier reports,11,13 the comprehensive assess-\nments and monthly telephone interviews were completed with a\ndesignated proxy for participants with significant cognitive im-\nsessments were completed by a designated proxy.\nDuring the 54-month assessment, data were collected on liv-\ning situation; self-reported, physician-diagnosed chronic con-\nditions13; cognitive status as assessed by the Folstein Mini-\nMental State Examination14; and physical frailty, defined on the\nbasis of slow gait speed as previously described.15-17\nChronic disability, defined as disability lasting at least 90\ndays (ie, 3 months), was ascertained for the first time during\nthe 54-month assessment using the protocol established by the\nNational Long-Term Care Survey,2,3,18 hereafter referred to sim-\nply as the established protocol. To our knowledge, alternative\nprotocols for assessing chronic disability have not been re-\nported. For each of the 4 essential activities of daily living, par-\nticipants were asked, \"At the present time, do you need help\nfrom another person to (complete the task)?\" Participants who\nanswered \"No\" were considered to be nondisabled for that task.\nParticipants who answered \"Yes\" were subsequently asked up\nto 3 questions, shown in the following tabulation, to deter-\nmine whether the disability was chronic.\nSubtype Question\nPrevious 3 months Have you needed help (to complete the\ntask) for 3 months or longer?\nNext 3 months Do you expect to need help (with the\ntask) for the next 3 months or\nlonger?\nCombination All together, from beginning to end, will\nyou have needed help (with the task)\nfor 3 months or longer?\nThe criterion for chronic disability was met if participants\nanswered \"Yes\" to any of the 3 questions for 1 or more of the 4\nactivities of daily living. Among a subgroup of 28 participants\nwith chronic disability at 54 months, we found that only 1 (3.6%)\ndid not meet the criterion based on a subsequent telephone in-\nterview that was completed independently within 5 days (mean,\n1.8 days) by a second interviewer.\nComplete details regarding the monthly assessments of dis-\nability, including formal tests of reliability and accuracy, are\nprovided elsewhere.11 During the monthly telephone inter-\nviews, participants were assessed for disability using standard\nquestions that were identical to those used during the com-\nprehensive assessments. For each of the 4 essential activities\nof daily living, we asked, \"At the present time, do you need help\nfrom another person to (complete the task)?\" Participants who\nneeded help with any of the tasks were considered to be dis-\nabled. Participants were not asked about eating, toileting, or\ngrooming. Disability in these activities of daily living is un-\ncommon in the absence of disability in bathing, dressing, walk-\ning, or transferring from a chair15,16,19; hence, these omissions\nwill have little appreciable effect on our estimates of chronic\ndisability. The reliability of our disability assessment was sub-\nstantial (=0.75) for reassessments completed within 48 hours\nand excellent (=1.00) for reassessments performed the same\nday.20 The accuracy of proxy reports, compared with reports\nfrom cognitively intact participants, was also found to be ex-\nThe prevalence of chronic disability was determined on the ba-\nsis of the 54-month assessment, and the number of chroni-\ncally disabled activities of daily living was tabulated. Partici-\npants with chronic disability were subsequently classified\naccording to the specific subtypes (shown in the tabulation in\nthe \"54-Month Assessment\" subsection).\nThe overall objective of our analysis was to determine the va-\nlidity of the established protocol for ascertaining chronic disabil-\nity as implemented during the 54-month assessment. Data from\nthe monthly telephone interviews were used to define the gold\nstandard. Participants were classified as having chronic disabil-\nitybasedonthepresenceofdisabilityduringconsecutivemonthly\ntelephone interviews immediately before or after the 54-month\nassessment.12,21,22 To bolster the validity of the gold standard, we\nevaluated a subgroup of 186 participants who had no disability\n\"at the present time\" and found that only 2 (1.1%) reported dis-\nability \"at any time during the last month.\" To be conservative,\nwe did not require that the subtype designation for the estab-\nlished protocol match that for the gold standard. Because the tele-\nphone interviews and 54-month assessments were completed in-\ndependently of one another, the corresponding time intervals for\nascertaining chronic disability usually did not coincide per-\nfectly, as illustrated in Table 1 (discussed in the next 2 subsec-\ntions). Hence, we performed 2 sets of analyses, under assump-\ntions that were initially favorable to the established protocol and,\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

For\nthe stringent strategy, the gold standard required disability dur-\ning consecutive telephone interviews for intervals of at least 90\ndays.

For the second subtype of \"next 3 months,\"\nthe gold standard required disability during months 55 to 57\nfor each of the 2 strategies. For the third subtype of \"combi-\nnation,\" the gold standard required disability in consecutive\nmonths during any interval within 90 days of the 54-month\nIn contrast, for this scenario the gold standard for chronic dis-\nability required disability during consecutive telephone inter-\nviews for intervals of at least 90 days relative to the time of the\n54-month assessment for the favorable strategy and for inter-\nvals that could have potentially spanned 90 days or longer for\nthe stringent strategy. To illustrate, in the last 2 columns of\nTable 1, the gold standard was achieved if disability was pres-\nto 58 for the favorable strategy and during months 52 to 54,\nboth strategies, participants needed to report disability in 1 or\nmore of the 4 essential activities of daily living during the 54-\nmonth assessment because this served as the reference point\nfor the gold standard. Of the 432 participants who were non-\ndisabled at 54 months, only 1 (0.2%) reported disability in the\nmonth immediately before and the month immediately follow-\ning the 54-month assessment.\nThe validity of the established protocol for chronic disability\nwas determined relative to the gold standard definitions for the\nfavorable and stringent strategies, respectively. The 2 metrics\nof validity were sensitivity and specificity, which were de-\nfined, per convention, as the ability of the established proto-\ncol to correctly identify the presence (ie, true positive) and ab-\nsence (ie, true negative) of chronic disability, respectively.23\nThese values, together with the prevalence of chronic disabil-\nity from the 54-month assessment, were used to estimate the\nnumber of chronically disabled elderly Americans in 1999 ac-\ncording to the gold standard definitions, through a series of cal-\nculations (available on request) that required the use of posi-\ntive and negative predictive values.

Unlike sensitivity\nand specificity, positive and negative predictive values are highly\ndependent on the prevalence of the specific disorder.23\nAll analyses were performed using the statistical software\nSAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\nThe characteristics of the analytic sample, at the time of\nthe 54-month assessment, are shown in Table 3.

The mean (SD) number of chronically disabled\nactivities of daily living was 2.1 (1.2); the most com-\nmonly disabled tasks were bathing (n=95; 79.2%) and\ndesignation (per the tabulation in the \"54-Month\nAssessment\" subsection in the \"Methods\" section),\nactivities of daily living, was \"previous 3 months.\" The\nsubtype designation was \"next 3 months\" for 11 tasks\n(3.3%) and 2 (1.7%) of the participants with chronic\ndisability, respectively, met criteria based exclusively\non the latter 2 subtype designations.\nOf the 120 participants who met criteria for chronic\ndisabilityaccordingtotheestablishedprotocol,30(25.0%)\nand 39 (32.5%) did not meet criteria according to the gold\nstandard definitions for the favorable and stringent strat-\negies, respectively (Table 4). Conversely, of the 95 par-\nticipants who met criteria for chronic disability accord-\ning to the favorable strategy and the 89 participants who\nmet criteria according to the stringent strategy, 5 (5.3%)\nand 8 (9.0%), respectively, did not meet criteria for chronic\ndisability according to the established protocol.

Based on these values, the number of chroni-\ncally disabled elderly Americans in 1999 was reduced from\n7.0 million according to the established protocol to 5.3\nmillion for the favorable strategy and 4.8 million for the\nstringent strategy (Table 4).\nCOMMENT\nUsing data from a unique longitudinal study, we found\nthat up to a third of elderly persons deemed to have\nchronic disability and 1 of 11 deemed not to have chronic\ndisability were misclassified by the protocol established\nfor use in the National Long-Term Care Survey.1 Rela-\ntive to the published estimate of 7.0 million,3 our pro-\njections yielded about 2.0 million fewer chronically dis-\nabled elderly Americans in 1999. These results threaten\nthe validity of the currently established protocol for as-\ncertaining chronic disability and suggest that the bur-\nden of chronic disability among elderly Americans has\nbeen substantially overestimated.\nAccurate estimates of chronic disability are impor-\ntant for several reasons. From a policy perspective, these\nestimates are often used to inform decisions regarding\nthe current and future health care needs of elderly per-\nsons and to forecast the likely demand for long-term\ncare.24-26 From an epidemiological perspective, the eti-\nology of chronic disability, including predisposing risk\nfactors and subsequent precipitants, may differ from that\nof short-term disability.27 Finally, from a personal per-\nspective, the likelihood of recovery is considerably lower\nfor a person with a chronic disability than for a person\nwith a short-term disability,12 and chronic disability likely\nconfers a higher risk of subsequent morbidity and mor-\ntality.\nAlthough our results suggest that prevalence esti-\nmates of chronic disability have been spuriously in-\nflated, they do not refute the relative reductions in chronic\ndisability that have been documented over the past 2 de-\ncades.

Comparable rates enhance the\nlikelihood that our projections are accurate.23 Over-\nsampling persons who were physically frail undoubtedly\nled to a higher rate of chronic disability, whereas our more\nnarrowly focused definition of disability, which required\npersonal assistance in at least 1 of 4 essential activities of\ndaily living, likely led to a lower rate. Had we used a more\nexpansive definition of disability that included instrumen-\ntal activities of daily living or the need for special equip-\nment,thevalidityoftheestablishedprotocolmayhavebeen\nTo address the modest asynchrony in time periods be-\ntween the established protocol and monthly telephone\ninterviews, we considered 2 gold standard definitions for\nchronic disability. Hence, our results provide upper and\nlower bounds for the number of chronically disabled el-\nderly Americans. Because we could not account for the\ncomplex sample design of the National Long-Term Care\nSurvey, these estimates should be interpreted cau-\ntiously. Our primary intent was to rigorously evaluate the\nvalidity of the currently established protocol for ascer-\ntaining chronic disability rather than to generate pre-\ncise population-based estimates of chronic disability.\nEven though it is difficult, if not impossible, to ex-\nclude the possibility of measurement error, we believe\nthat it is an unlikely explanation for our findings be-\ncause our disability assessments were highly reliable, our\nrate of proxy reports was lower than that reported in the\nNational Long-Term Care Survey,30 and the accuracy of\nour proxy reports was high. Although our participants\nare older than those in the National Long-Term Care Sur-\nvey, there is no evidence that the accuracy of self-\nreported disability differs by age in the absence of cog-\nnitive impairment. Further reducing the possibility of bias,\nour 2 strategies for ascertaining chronic disability were\ncompleted independently of one another in the context\nof an ongoing longitudinal study. Our results cannot be\nattributed to underreporting of disability during the\nmonthly telephone interviews because individuals who\nreport no disability at the present time are unlikely to\nhave had any disability during the past month.\nIn summary, the results of our study suggest that preva-\nlence estimates of chronic disability have been spuri-\nously inflated. Given the dynamic nature of disability, new\nstrategies are needed to adequately capture the true bur-\nden of chronic disability among elderly persons.\nCorrespondence: Thomas M.
