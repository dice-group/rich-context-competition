In this\ncross-sectional study, we use the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to\ndetermine whether a history of kidney stones (n  793) is associated with lower femoral neck BMD and\nwhether the association is similar for men and women. We further ask whether dietary calcium modifies the\nassociation between kidney stone history and BMD and whether there is an association between kidney stone\nhistory and prevalent spine or wrist fracture. We find that men with kidney stone history have lower femoral\nneck BMD than men without kidney stone history after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), race/\nethnicity, and other potential confounders. The effect of kidney stone history on BMD is weaker for women.\nMen with kidney stone history also are more likely to report prevalent wrist and spine fractures. Dietary\ncalcium, represented by usual milk consumption, is associated positively with BMD for both men and women\nand modifies the effect of kidney stone history on BMD for men. For men who form kidney stones, milk\nconsumption is associated more strongly with femoral neck BMD than for men without such a history. The\neffect modification is such that the difference in BMD between men with and without kidney stone history is\n",

Results, though, are not\ncompletely consistent with respect, for example, to which\nskeletal sites are affected, whether the effect is seen in\nwomen, or whether only patients with hypercalciuria (and\nwhich type) are affected. Inconsistent findings may be\ncaused by random variability associated with generally\nsmall sample sizes or the potential difficulty of assembling\na comparison series that is representative of the target\npopulation. In one study, Jaeger et al. compared bone min-\neral density (BMD) of 110 men who form calcium stones\nwith and without hypercalciuria to that of healthy controls at\nseveral skeletal sites (lumbar spine, femur, distal tibial\ndiaphysis, and distal tibial epiphysis).(6) Although they\nfound a tendency for lower BMD for people who form\n1Department of Health Studies, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.\n2Statistics Department, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.\n3Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.\n\u00a9 2001 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\nstones at all sites regardless of hypercalciuria status, BMD\nwas significantly lower only at the two tibial sites. However,\nnone of their 235 male controls had ever experienced a\nfracture, which raises concern that the controls may have\nhad unusually high BMD. In contrast, Heilberg et al. did\nfind significantly lower lumbar spine BMD in 13 male\nkidney stone patients with fasting hypercalciuria (but not in\n13 with absorptive hypercalciuria) compared with matched\ncontrols.(7) There was no evidence of an effect in 29 female\npatients.\nA different potential source of heterogeneity among stud-\nies could be an unmeasured confounder or effect modifier,\none more common in some populations than others. Cal-\ncium consumption could be such a factor. There is evidence\nthat dietary calcium is associated with BMD in patients with\nkidney stones. Fuss and others found that 60 male patients\nwith kidney stones who maintained a low-calcium diet had\nlower bone mineral content at the distal radius than 63 male\npatients with an unrestricted diet.(8) Trinchieri and others\ncollected 3-day dietary diaries from 48 male patients with a\nhistory of calcium kidney stones.(9) Almost one-half of\npatients were classified as having low BMD at the femur or\nspine, and these were more likely to report a low-calcium\ndiet. Thus, if calcium consumption of patients with kidney\nstones varies between studies, one might find that BMD is\nlower in those case series in which the patients maintained\nrelatively low-calcium diets but not significantly decreased\nin other case series.\nLow BMD is a concern primarily because it is such a\nstrong risk factor for osteoporotic fracture.(10\u00ad12) Because\nboth kidney stones and fractures are relatively rare out-\ncomes in a general population, large studies are necessary to\ninvestigate whether there is an association between them.\nMelton et al., using the Rochester Epidemiology Project,\ndetermined rates of fracture among 624 persons diagnosed\nMN.(13) The risk of vertebral fracture was greatly increased\namong men who form kidney stones, with a standardized\nmorbidity ratio (SMR) of 7.0 and an elevated, although\nlower, SMR of 2.4 among women. There was no evidence\nof increased fracture risk at the proximal humerus, distal\nforearm, pelvis, or proximal femur. In a second population-\nbased study, Sowers et al. investigated whether there was an\nassociation between either BMD or fracture and kidney\nof kidney stones.(14) They did not find lower BMD or\nincreased fracture among those who form kidney stones.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we use a national sample,\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES III), to determine whether a history of kid-\nney stones is associated with lower BMD at the femoral\nneck and whether the association is similar for men and\nwomen. One advantage of using NHANES III is that the\ncomparison group is representative of the U.S. adult popu-\nlation and is accepted as the standard for BMD evaluation.\nBecause we include the entire sample in the study, we are\nable to adjust for potential confounders such as body mass\nindex (BMI) among both those with and those without a\nkidney stone history. We further ask whether dietary cal-\ncium modifies the association between kidney stone history\nand BMD. Finally, we examine whether there is an associ-\nation between kidney stone history and prevalent spine or\nwrist fracture.\nData source\nThe NHANES III was conducted from 1988 through\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics, of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The NHANESs\nare national probability surveys designed to obtain nation-\nally representative estimates of the health and nutritional\nstatus of the population. The study design for NHANES III,\na multistage probability sample, has been described previ-\nclusion. Of these, 14% did not participate in the household\ninterview and then an additional 8% did not participate in\nthe examination at the mobile examination units. Persons\nwith examination data also have household interview data.\nBone density measurements\nA distinctive feature of the NHANES III was the inclu-\nsion of bone densitometry in the examination, specifically\nmeasurement of the proximal femur using dual-energy\nX-ray absorptiometry. The procedures used have been de-\nyears and older were eligible for BMD measurement if they\nhad not previously broken both hips or had hip pins or\nartificial hips. Measurements were taken of the left hip\nunless it had been fractured or had surgery, in which case\nthe right hip was measured. The sample included 7114 men\nand 7532 women. BMD is reported for five regions of the\nfemur. In this study, we focus on one site, the femoral neck.\nThree Hologic QDR 1000 densitometers in mobile exami-\nnation units were used. Rigorous quality control ensured\nconsistent data.(18)\nOther data\nHeight and weight were measured using a standardized\nprocedure.(19) We use height and weight to calculate BMI,\nusing the formula of kilograms per square meter.\nRace (black, white, or other) and ethnicity (Mexican\nAmerican, other Hispanic, or not Hispanic) are combined\ninto a single-response format, which includes categories for\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican Ameri-\ncan, and other. The study oversampled blacks and Mexican\nAmericans. Persons who are neither white, black, nor Mex-\nican American are identified as \"other,\" a heterogenous\ngroup of non-Mexican Hispanics, Asian Americans, and\nNative Americans for whom population estimates have no\nclear interpretation.\nHistory of kidney stones was ascertained from the ques-\ntion, \"Have you ever had kidney stones?\" Fracture history\nwas ascertained from the question, \"Has a doctor ever told\nyou that you had broken or fractured your [hip, wrist,\nspine]?\" Current medication use was recorded based on\nhousehold inspection of containers for prescription medica-\ntions taken during the previous month. Each medication was\ndescribed by up to three drug class codes. Medications that\ncould potentially confound the association between kidney\nstone history and BMD were identified from the broad drug\ncodes: diuretics, adrenal corticosteroids, androgens/anabolic\nsteroids, estrogens/progestins, and thyroid/antithyroid.\nDietary data were collected in both the household inter-\nview and in the examination. In the household interview,\nthere was a series of questions about lifetime milk consump-\ntion, which asked respondents to remember how often they\ndrank any kind of milk, including milk on cereal (but not\nmilk added to tea or coffee), during as many as five periods\nof their life, depending on current age: child (5\u00ad12 years),\nused milk consumption during the current age category to\nindicate level of habitual milk consumption, assuming this\nwould be correlated with calcium consumption over an\nextended time horizon. We categorized responses into\nnever, less than once per day, once per day, and more than\nonce per day, which created approximately equal quartiles.\nA second measure of calcium consumption was available\nfrom the examination at which interviewers collected 24-h\ndietary recall. Twenty-four-hour calcium consumption was\nestimated from this. Because it would be difficult to inter-\npret models that included two correlated indicators of di-\netary calcium, we examined which one was associated more\nstrongly with BMD, as indicated by statistical significance,\nand used that one in further modeling.\nAge and census region of the country (northeast, south,\nmidwest, and west) were also used in the analysis.\nAnalysis\nThe analysis addressed four questions: (1) Do those who\nform kidney stones have lower BMD? (2) Does the associ-\nation vary by sex? (3) Does calcium consumption modify\nthe association between kidney stone history and BMD? (4)\nAre those who form kidney stones more likely to have\nexperienced fractures of the spine or wrist?\nBecause of the complex study design, all regression anal-\nyses and estimates of population prevalence take into ac-\ncount sample weights (which account for oversampling and\nnonresponse) and design effects.\nBecause BMD is strongly associated with age and the\nnature of the association varies by sex, we determined\nage-adjusted residuals for femoral neck BMD. Using sepa-\nrate models for men and women, we flexibly modeled the\nassociation with age by predicting BMD as a function of a\nseries of six age variables: age since 20, age since 30, . . .\nage since 70. This approach allows there to be a different\nslope for the age effect during each decade of adult life and\nfor the slopes to be different for men and women. For each\nobservation, we determined the residual, that is, the differ-\nence between BMD expected based on age and sex and\nBMD observed. There was no race/ethnicity adjustment in\nthese prediction models; thus, for example, blacks have on\naverage higher age-adjusted BMD residuals. For the entire\nmale or female population, residuals will have a mean of\nzero. These age-adjusted BMD residuals are the outcomes\nfor all analyses of BMD determinants. Consequently, re-\ngression models for BMD do not further adjust for age.\nFirst, we estimated population prevalence for history of\nkidney stone. Then, we examined whether a history of\nkidney stones was associated with lower BMD using mul-\ntivariate regression, adjusting for BMI and race/ethnicity,\nand modeling data for males and females separately. We\nentered the following additional variables into the model:\nmilk consumption, current medication use (diuretic, steroid,\nandrogens, estrogens, and thyroid), and region of the coun-\ntry. Then we added an interaction term for calcium con-\nsumption and history of kidney stones.\nTo examine whether those who form kidney stones were\nmore likely to have experienced osteoporotic fracture, we\nused logistic regression models predicting history of spine\nfracture and wrist fracture. We entered kidney stone history,\nage, and race/ethnicity into the models separately for males\nand females. We did not model hip fracture because unlike\nspine and wrist fracture, osteoporotic hip fracture strongly\npredicts both mortality and institutionalization. Because the\nfracture information is all collected retrospectively and from\nthe noninstitutionalized population, selection bias would be\nlikely to influence the findings for hip fracture. Specifically,\nrather than modeling an association for persons who had\nexperienced hip fracture, we would have modeled an asso-\nciation for persons who survived hip fracture and avoided\ndisability.\nSTATA 6 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was\nused for analyses.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the NHANES III adult sample with\nbone densitometry data are presented in Table 1. A history\nand the lifetime prevalence estimate of kidney stones is\nlence of wrist and spine fracture and current medication use.\nTable 2 presents the coefficients and significance tests\nfrom regression models for men and women in which age-\nadjusted BMD is the outcome. Of the two indicators of\ndietary calcium that we considered, habitual milk consump-\ntion and 24-h calcium estimate, the former is associated\nmore strongly with BMD (data not shown) and is included\nin these models. Adjusting for the other variables in the\nmodels, a history of kidney stones is significantly associated\nwith lower BMD for men but not women. The effects of\nBMI and habitual milk consumption are similar for men and\nwomen. For both men and women, blacks and Mexican\nAmericans have higher age-adjusted BMD than whites after\nadjusting for the other factors, notably BMI. Although the\ndirections of effects are as expected for the current medi-\ncation use (e.g., diuretic use is associated with higher BMD\nand corticosteroid use with lower BMD) only estrogen use\nfor women has a statistically significant effect, increased\nBMD. There is evidence of geographic variation in BMD\nfor women but not men. Adjusting for BMI, race/ethnicity,\nand the other factors in the model, women in the south and\nnortheast have lower age-adjusted BMD than women in the\nMidwest (the referent region in the model).\nTable 3 presents coefficients from models that test\nwhether there is a statistically significant interaction be-\ntween kidney stone history and level of habitual milk con-\nsumption in predicting BMD after adjusting for race/\nethnicity and BMI. The interaction term for kidney stone\nhistory and milk consumption is positive for both men and\nwomen but only statistically significant for men. The direc-\ntion of the interaction term is such that increased milk\nconsumption has a greater positive effect on BMD for\npersons with a history of kidney stones than for persons\nwithout such a history. Figure 1 graphically presents how\nthe interaction term affects the association between level of\nmilk consumption and age-adjusted BMD for men for each\nlevel of milk consumption.

At low levels of milk consump-\ntion, men with a history of kidney stones have a much lower\nage-adjusted BMD, while BMD is similar for those who\nform kidney stones and others at the highest level of milk\nconsumption.\nTable 4 presents the odds ratios (ORs) for persons with a\nkidney stone history, relative to those without, in reporting\nwrist or spine fracture. For men, those who form kidney\nstones are significantly more likely to report both fracture\ntypes. The point estimates of the ORs for women who form\nkidney stones are lower than those for men, and they are not\nstatistically significant.\nDISCUSSION\nWith a representative sample of the U.S. adult population,\nwe have found that men with a kidney stone history have\nlower femoral neck BMD than men who do not report such\na history after adjusting for age, BMI, race/ethnicity, and\nother potential confounders. The effect of kidney stone\nhistory on BMD is weaker for women. Men with a history\nof kidney stones also are more likely than others to report\nprevalent wrist and spine fracture. Although dietary cal-\ncium, represented by usual milk consumption, is positively\nassociated with BMD for both men and women, it modifies\nthe effect of kidney stone history on BMD for men. For men\nwho form kidney stones, milk consumption is associated\nmore strongly with femoral neck BMD than for men with-\nout a kidney stone history. The magnitude of the effect\nmodification is such that the difference in BMD between\nmen with and without a kidney stone history is observed\nonly at the lower levels of milk consumption.\nThe weaker association for women could be related either\nto sex differences in kidney stones or to sex differences in\nBMD. A lower proportion of kidney stones among women\nare calcium stones and a higher proportion of infection-\nrelated struvite stones.(20) Because the effect on BMD is\nassumed to be confined to calcium stones, the effect on\nBMD observed for all kidney stones, undifferentiated by\ntype, consequently, would be weaker for women. Determi-\nnants of BMD also differ for men and women. In these\nmodels, more factors are predictive of age-adjusted BMD\nfor women than men, specifically, current estrogen use and\ngeographic region. Geographic region likely stands in for\nseveral environmental factors that are correlated weakly\nwith geography, perhaps factors such as adolescent weight\nor lifetime physical activity. We included geographic region\nas a potential confounder because geographic variation has\nbeen observed for both kidney stones and hip fractures.\nKidney stones are most prevalent in the southeastern and\nsouth central states and least prevalent in the northwest.(21)\nThe geographic pattern of hip fractures is somewhat similar,\nwith high rates in the south central states for both men and\nwomen and in the southeastern states for women.(22,23)\nThere are important limitations to the use of NHANES III\ndata for this study. First, lumbar spine BMD is not available.\nKidney stone history is based on self-report and does not\ninclude year of onset, type of kidney stone, or presence of\nhypercalciuria. Because age is not available for the first\nkidney stone, some wrist and spine fractures may predate\nkidney stone occurrence. However, to the extent that kidney\nstones reflect an underlying metabolic condition and hyper-\ncalciuria may begin in childhood,(24) observed temporality\nmay not be as crucial as for most clinical outcomes. Because\npotential confounders such as medication use are assessed at\nthe time of the interview, after both kidney stones and\nVariable\nMen Women\nCoefficient p Value Coefficient p Value\nHistory of kidney\nstone\nHabitual milk\nconsumptiona\nModels are also adjusted for BMI and race/ethnicity.\na Habitual milk consumption is a four-level variable.\nb Interaction term is product of habitual milk consumption and\nhistory of kidney stone.\nFIG. 1.

Age-adjusted BMD\nvalues are relative to men with no kidney stone history and no habitual\nmilk consumption.\nFracture site Men Women\nfractures have occurred, the fracture models do not adjust\nfor potential confounders beyond current age and race/\nethnicity. Wrist and spine fracture are also self-reported,\nand spine fractures, which may be asymptomatic in as many\nas one-half of patients,(25) therefore are likely to be under-\nreported. Only current medication use is available, and\nidentification is limited by the coding categories. For exam-\nple, thiazide diuretics cannot be distinguished from other\nkinds of diuretics.\nDespite these limitations, NHANES III offers the advan-\ntage that it is a nationally representative sample of over\n14,000 men and women, with racial, ethnic, and geographic\ndistribution similar to the country as a whole (after the\nsample design is taken into account), and with kidney stone\nprevalence that also is nationally representative. We are able\nto use femoral neck BMD data, which are accepted as the\nreference standard, and at the same time adjust for key\nconfounders such as BMI, which previously has been pos-\nsible only with much smaller clinic-based series of cases\nand controls. These data confirm an association for men\nbetween kidney stone history and both lower BMD and\nhigher fracture prevalence. Consistent with previous stud-\nies, we have found that these associations are weaker for\nwomen. These data underscore the importance of dietary\ncalcium in preventing osteoporosis among male patients\nwith kidney stones.\nREFERENCES\n1.
