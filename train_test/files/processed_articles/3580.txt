It is\nexpedient at this stage to explain what research means and its\ntypes because that provides a context for the ensuing dis-\ncourse. Research is a careful, systematic, and patient investi-\ngation in some field of knowledge, undertaken to establish\nfacts or principles; it is a structured inquiry that utilizes an\nacceptable scientific methodology to collect, analyze, and\ninterpret information to solve problems or answer questions\nand to create new knowledge that is generally applicable\naccording to Research Assessment Exercise (2005), research\nis an original and systematic inquiry or investigation into a\nsubject to gain knowledge and understanding of a phenome-\nnon. Research can, therefore, simply be described as a jour-\nney embarked upon that leads to the discovery of new\nknowledge or revision of facts, theories, and applications.\nThus, any research conducted must make an original contri-\nbution to the existing body of knowledge in the relevant\ndiscipline.\nThere are two main types of research, which are scien-\ntific/academic research and research that is more or less car-\nried out by people in their daily lives, known as common\nsense research. In distinguishing between these two types of\nresearch, Lundberg (1942) explains that nearly all people in\nthe course of their daily lives may systematically observe,\nclassify, and interpret data, which is a form of research. For\ninstance, a potential purchaser of a particular model of a car\nmay systematically investigate about the performance of the\ncar before finally making a decision to purchase it and this\nconstitutes research. Lundberg, however, observes that this\n1Liverpool John Moores University, UK\n2Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, Accra, Ghana\nCorresponding Author:\nRaymond Talinbe Abdulai, School of Built Environment, Liverpool John\nMoores University, Byrom Street, Liverpool L3 3AF, UK.\nEmail: R.Abdulai@ljmu.ac.uk\nEssential Ingredients of a Good Research\nProposal for Undergraduate and\nPostgraduate Students in the Social\nSciences\nRaymond Talinbe Abdulai1 and Anthony Owusu-Ansah2\n Keywords\nessential ingredients, research, social sciences, writing a good proposal\n2 SAGE Open\ntype of research is different from scientific research because\nof the degree of formality, rigorousness, verifiability, and\ngeneral validity of the latter. The essential features of aca-\ndemic research are that it should, as far as possible, be con-\ntrolled, rigorous, valid and verifiable, empirical, critical\n(Kumar, 2011), reliable, systematic, arguable, and\nchallengeable.\nRegarding the concept of control, in real life, many fac-\ntors can affect an outcome and, therefore, in exploring the\ncausality in relation to, for example, two variables, it is\nimportant that the study is set up in a manner that minimizes\nthe effects of other factors affecting the relationship (Kumar,\n2011). This, Kumar notes, can be achieved to a large extent\nin the physical sciences because most of the research is con-\nducted in a laboratory setting. He, however, opines that in the\nsocial sciences, it can be extremely difficult to control exter-\nnal factors as the research is carried out on issues relating to\nhuman beings living in a society where such controls are\nimpossible and it will, thus, be necessary to quantify their\nimpact. It appears, Kumar assumes, that such impacts can\nalways be quantified. However, it might not be possible in all\ncases and even where they can be quantified, an issue that\nmay arise will relate to the appropriate technique to be used\nand these constitute some of the challenges in the research\nprocess.\nIn terms of the rigorousness of academic research, scru-\npulousness on the part of the research is required to ensure\nthe procedures followed to address problems or find answers\nto questions are relevant, appropriate, and justified (Kumar,\ndegree of rigor will vary markedly between the physical and\nsocial sciences. The concept of validity and verifiability\nimplies that the conclusions, which are made based on the\nresearch findings, should be correct and can be verified by\nthe researcher and others (Kumar, 2011). Validity is about the\nstudy's success at measuring or investigating what the\nresearcher sets out to measure or investigate (internal valid-\nity) and the extent to which the research findings can be\napplied to new settings (external validity) (Bell & Bryman,\nSzafram, 2012). Albeit other types of validity exist, it suf-\nfices that only internal and external validity is mentioned\nbecause the object is to briefly define the concept.\nReliability refers to the extent to which a test or any mea-\nsuring procedure yields the same results on repeated trials\ntherefore, about consistency. It is when research procedures\nor tools used by different researchers yield consistent mea-\nsurements that researchers are able to satisfactorily draw\nconclusions, formulate theories, or make claims about the\ngeneralizability of their research findings (Creswell, 2003,\n2009). Thus, the importance of reliability in academic\nresearch cannot be over-emphasized as it determines the\nvalidity of research findings. In terms of empirical issues,\nany conclusions drawn should be based on hard evidence\ncollected from real-life experiences or observations (Kumar,\n2011). It, however, needs to be noted that in conducting aca-\ndemic research, not all data will be based on real-life experi-\nences or observations as there can be desktop research, which\nis considered later. Regarding critical issues, critical scrutiny\nof the procedures or methods used is crucial to a research\ninquiry; that is, the process and procedures adopted must be\nable to withstand critical scrutiny (Kumar, 2011).\nAcademic research is also systematic, arguable, and chal-\nlengeable. This is because what is to be addressed or investi-\ngated [that is, the research problem or question(s)] must, first\nof all, be established based on the research gap(s) identified\nin the relevant literature. Second, how the research problem\nor question(s) are to be addressed has to be determined.\nThird, data will be collected, presented, and analyzed using\nappropriate data analysis tools and the research findings dis-\ncussed. Finally, conclusions and appropriate recommenda-\ntions will be made. Thus, conducting research is a systematic\nprocess that involves the realization of milestones and deliv-\nerables. As aptly observed by Kumar (2011), the procedures\nadopted to undertake an investigation follow a certain logical\nsequence and, therefore, the different steps cannot be taken\nin a haphazard manner--some procedures must follow oth-\ners. Timescales and resources for research are normally tight.\nAny research to be conducted will be time-bound and, thus,\nthe researcher has no infinite time, neither has he got limit-\nless resources for the research; these constitute challenges\nthat are normally referred to as research limitations or con-\nstraints. Other research challenges that might be encountered\nin the research process include issues relating to the particu-\nlar research methodology used and accessibility to data. It is,\nthus, very important to comprehend these research chal-\nlenges and to acknowledge them in the research process.\nThere are two main forms of academic research based on\nthe sources of data. The first one is desktop research, which\nis any research conducted where the source of data is solely\npublished and unpublished materials; that is, the research\nrelies heavily on secondary data. Examples will include\ninformation from books, journal articles, published and\nunpublished dissertations and theses, reports, databases,\nnewspapers, and magazines. The second one is empirical\nresearch where data are gathered via direct experience,\nobservation, experimentation, interviews, and question-\nnaires--this type of research, therefore, uses mainly primary\ndata. It is possible to conduct academic research, which is an\namalgam of the two and, therefore, they are not watertight\nclosed boxes.\nThe preoccupation of this article is academic research\nsince it is that type of research that students in universities\nare normally required to conduct and report in a dissertation\nor thesis form. The research journey normally commences\nwith the selection of a research topic from a subject or an\nAbdulai and Owusu-Ansah 3\narea of interest and the preparation of a research proposal on\nthe selected topic. A research proposal clarifies the thoughts\nof the researcher. Furthermore, it aids him to organize his\nideas into a coherent statement of research intent regarding\nwhat is to be investigated, how it will be investigated, and the\nsignificance/importance of what is to be investigated. It also\noffers him an opportunity to convince an assessor or any\nother reader that the proposed research can be conducted\nwithin a given time frame and resources.\nThe purpose of this article is to discuss the essential ingre-\ndients of a good research proposal. The experience of the\nauthors in teaching research methodology and supervising\nstudents at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels\nshows that students tend to find it difficult understanding the\nessential ingredients of a research proposal and for that mat-\nter, find it difficult to write good research proposals. Thus,\nthere is the need to explain such ingredients in more detail\nand to provide relevant examples where necessary for ease of\ncomprehension. The article is, therefore, not a didactic\npiece--rather, the purpose is to guide students in research\nproposal writing. These ingredients are research topic,\nresearch background and gap(s), research aim and objec-\ntives, research methodology, research significance/impor-\ntance, research program, and references, which are treated in\nthat order. Elements of the research proposal that are sup-\nposed to feature in the final written dissertation or thesis are\nalso considered before the article is concluded.\nResearch Topic\nAs indicated above, the research proposal is prepared on a\nselected research topic but the topic will emanate from an\narea of interest.An area of interest could, for instance, be real\nestate management or construction management. Such broad\nsubject areas will form the basis of a preliminary exploration\nto be carried out about the subject by reading the relevant\nliterature. The preliminary reading enables the potential\nresearcher to familiarize himself with the subject area and to\nhelp him gain a sense of its scope and complexity. Once\nsome background knowledge is gained, the next stage is to\nnarrow the subject area by formulating a topic that can be\nthoroughly investigated within a given period of time. At the\ntopic formulation stage, the potential researcher should be\nable to articulate at least a tentative topic for the research to\nbe conducted. Selecting a topic via this route can serve as a\nmotivator and driver for the research. Topics that seem inter-\nesting and perhaps meet the career aspirations of the student\ncan be identified and pursued. In using this route, it may be\nhelpful to confer with colleagues and lecturers in terms of\nwhat one intends to pursue for their input.Admittedly, select-\ning a topic through this route takes a lot of time.\nRegarding, particularly, undergraduate and master's dis-\nsertations there is another route for selecting a research topic.\nThis is where students fashion their topics based on the\nresearch interests of particular lecturers; indeed, a list of\ntopics from lecturers based on their research interests may be\navailable for the students to choose from. One advantage\nwith this route is that the student is able to settle on a topic\nwithin a shorter period of time in comparison with the first\none above. The other advantage is that in the supervision\nprocess, the lecturer will be in a much better position to offer\nexpert advice providing the student who has chosen one of\nthe topics of a particular lecturer is allocated to that lecturer\nto supervise. This significantly enhances the quality of super-\nvision and ultimately contributes in enhancing student satis-\nfaction and experience. However, the latter advantage cannot\nbe achieved if the student is not finally allocated to the lec-\nturer whose topic has been chosen by the student and this\nhappens in some cases in universities. The experience of the\nauthors in coordinating dissertations also shows that this\nroute to selecting research topics can be problematic in some\ncases, especially, when the student is facing difficulties in the\ncourse of conducting the research; they tend to use the fact\nthat the topics were given to them by their lecturers as an\nalibi for their problems.\nWhichever route is used to select a topic, it is very impor-\ntant to seriously consider the availability of relevant data and\nits accessibility for the research in the decision making pro-\ncess. Table 1 provides examples of good and bad research\ntopics.\nResearch Background\nVarious terms are used to describe the research background\nor background to research section, for example, \"broad dis-\nResearch is conducted to address an existing problem or\nquestion(s), which has not been addressed before and, there-\nfore, irrespective of the terminology that is used to describe\nthe section, it provides a context for the research, by identify-\ning the research problem or research question(s), which\nrequires a kind of mini literature review. Thus, the terminol-\nogy used to describe the section does not actually matter. A\nliterature review is a \"systematic, explicit, and reproducible\nmethod of identifying, evaluating, and synthesising the exist-\ning body of completed and recorded work produced by\nresearchers, scholars, and practitioners\" (Fink, 2005, cited in\nwords, it is a process of searching and describing or critically\nanalyzing any secondary data that relate to a particular sub-\nject, field, discipline, or topic. Thus, a literature review is\nsimply about making references to the works of other people\neither in a descriptive or critical and analytical manner. It is a\nprocess and there are two types: descriptive literature review\nand critical and analytical literature review.\nBased on what literature review means, it is inappropriate\nto use \"literature review\" as a title or heading of a section in\na research proposal or a chapter in a dissertation or thesis\nalbeit it is commonly used that way. For instance, Naoum\n4 SAGE Open\n(2013) has used it as a section heading in a sample research\nproposal. In writing a research proposal, dissertation, or the-\nsis, elements of literature review can be found in any section\nor chapter once references are cited in that section or chapter\neven if it is a single reference that is cited. Under the research\nbackground section of a research proposal, for example, a\nmini literature review will be conducted, but the section is\ntitled \"research background\" and not \"literature review.\"\nSimilarly, in the research methodology chapter of a research\nproposal, dissertation, or thesis, references will be cited but\nthe chapter will not be titled \"literature review.\" It will be\nappropriately titled, \"research methodology.\" Also in MPhil\nand PhD theses, a chapter on a theoretical framework for the\nstudy is an imperative but the chapter will be titled \"theoreti-\ncal framework\" although it will be a literature review. Indeed,\nin the empirical data presentation, analysis, and discussion\nchapter(s) of a dissertation or thesis, there can be elements of\nliterature review; for example, a researcher may establish a\nfinding and compare it with previous findings and in this\ninstance, the reference(s) for the previous findings will be\ncited. Therefore, it does not make any sense to title a particu-\nlar section or chapter \"literature review\"; rather, an appropri-\nate title or heading that captures the contents of the section or\nchapter should be used.\nA literature review serves various purposes, which have\nfollows: It (a) provides a theoretical background for the\nresearch, (b) broadens the researcher's knowledge base and\nbrings clarity and focus to the research problem, (c) helps to\nestablish the nexus between what is proposed to be researched\nand what has already been studied, (d) improves research\nmethodology, and (e) enables the researcher to show how his\nfindings contribute to the existing body of knowledge and,\ntherefore, helps to contextualize the research findings.\nPurposes (b) and (c) are of more relevance here--the ratio-\nnale for a literature review under the research background\nsection is to establish the links between what has already\nbeen researched and what is proposed to be researched,\nthereby, broadening the researcher's knowledge base as well\nas to bring more clarity and focus to the research problem or\nresearch question(s).\nThe term mini literature review is used in the present con-\ntext to differentiate it from the main analytical and critical\nliterature review that will be presented in the final disserta-\ntion or thesis. The mini literature review provides an over-\nview of the key literature sources from which the ultimate\nmain research will draw. Thus, it is the mini literature review\nthat will finally be expanded when the dissertation or thesis\nis being written. Research background is the heartbeat of a\nresearch proposal and the researcher needs to demonstrate\nhis knowledge of the relevant literature both past and present\nby clearly articulating what other researchers have done in\nrelation to the topic to be investigated, what they have found,\nand what aspects have not been researched, known as\nresearch gap(s).\nThus, a clear line between previous studies that have been\ncarried out and the research to be undertaken must be shown.\nIn short, the proposed research should be the point\nTable 1. Examples of Good and Bad Research Topics.\nResearch topic Remarks\n1 To examine the performance of REITs Badly phrased research topic--it is phrased\nlike a research aim or objective. It is also too\nbroad.

REIT = real estate investment trust.\nAbdulai and Owusu-Ansah 5\nof departure from the existing knowledge; that is, what the\nproposed research will do that is different from what has\nbeen done before must be demonstrated. The overarching\naim of the research background section is, therefore, to\nestablish research gap(s), which will then form the basis of\nthe research problem or question(s) to be addressed. Research\ngap(s) may take two main forms as follows.\nA Situation Where No Research Has Been\nConducted in Relation to the Topic Under\nConsideration\nWhere this situation is established via the mini literature\nreview, it will form the basis of the research problem or\nquestion(s). This may easily apply to the physical sciences.\nHowever, in the social sciences, it may be difficult (although\nnot impossible) for it to apply as invariably; a form of\nresearch would have been conducted in relation to a topic.\nHowever, where it is possible to establish that research has\nnever been conducted in relation to a particular topic under\nconsideration, it will form the research gap.\nA Situation Where Research Has Been\nConducted Into a Topic Under Consideration\nbut to a Certain Extent or From a Particular\nPerspective\nIt is this situation that normally applies in the social sciences.\nUnder this broad form of research gap, different sub-research\ngaps can be encountered including those discussed below.\nHistorical. The research gap can be historical where research\nhas been conducted on a topic a long time ago with no other\nresearch conducted on the topic since then. The same topic\ncould be researched today as it is possible that with the\neffluxion of time, the conditions that existed at the time of\nthe original investigation into the topic might have changed.\nWhere a topic has been researched from the perspective of a\nparticular discipline.For example, a topic could have been\ninvestigated by a planner but has never been considered by\nan economist and, thus, it can be investigated by the econo-\nmist from the perspective of economics. Because these\nresearchers will have different subject backgrounds, they\nwill be wearing different lenses and, therefore, will investi-\ngate the topic from different perspectives in accordance with\ntheir training.\nWhere a topic has been researched in relation to a particular\ngeographical location. Regarding this situation, a topic could\nhave, for instance, been investigated using Holland as a case\nstudy but research has never been conducted into that topic\nusing Italy as a case study--this will, therefore, constitute a\nresearch gap. It could even apply to the same country where\nresearch would have been carried out on a particular issue\nusing a particular city or town as a case study and the same\nresearch could be conducted using a different city or town\nwithin the same country. Albeit it will be the same topic that\nis being investigated, the conditions in the different countries\nor different parts of the same country will be different, which\nwill influence the research.\nComparing issues. A fourth form of research gap will relate to\ncomparing issues. Thus, from the literature to be reviewed, it\nwill be possible to discover that research has never been con-\nducted on a topic already investigated on a comparative basis\nand this will be a research gap. This form of research gap\ncould, for example, relate to geographical locations where\nresearch has never been carried out on a topic on a compara-\ntive basis using different geographical locations.\nWhere a topic has two or more dimensions but research has only\nbeen conducted in relation to one or some of them. For instance,\nan issue such as constraints of accessibility to formal capital\nfor investment will have demand and supply side constraints.\nIt is, therefore, possible that although a lot of research would\nhave been conducted on this issue, all the studies might have\nconcentrated on, for example, the demand side in various\ncountries with no research that has looked at the supply side\nconstraints. This will, thus, constitute a research gap.\nWhen the mini literature review is being carried out, it is\nthe above forms of research gaps that one needs to be search-\ning. Once the research gap(s) are established, an appropriate\nresearch problem can be formulated. The research problem\nformulation is a very critical stage in the research process. As\nKerlinger (1986) aptly and succinctly puts it, \"If one wants to\nsolve a problem, one must generally know what the problem\nis. It can be said that a large part of the problem lies in know-\ning what one is trying to do\" (p. 17). The researcher needs to\nhave a clear idea regarding what he wants to find out about\nand not what he thinks he must find (Kumar, 2011). However,\nwhat the prospective researcher wants to find about should\nnot have been investigated in the existing literature. An issue\nor phenomenon becomes a research problem because it exists\nand has not been researched (or some aspects of it have not\nbeen researched) before. Consequently, the mere fact that an\nissue or phenomenon exists does not make it a research prob-\nlem--for the issue to become a research problem, the poten-\ntial researcher needs to demonstrate that the phenomenon has\nnot been investigated or some aspects of it have not been\ninvestigated in the existing literature. Thus, for all intents\nand purposes, the research problem is simply, a re-articula-\ntion of the research gap(s), which can alternatively be stated\nby posing relevant research question(s) that have to be\nanswered. The research problem or research question(s) will\nin turn form the basis of the research aim and objectives for\ninvestigation.\nIt is important to end the research background section\nwith a statement of the research problem or research\n6 SAGE Open\nquestion(s). The research problem or research question(s)\ncan also be stated in a sub-section of its own. Indeed, the\nwhole research background section need not be presented in\na monolithic manner. It can have sub-sections with appropri-\nate headings as required. It is possible to identify two or\nmore problems or questions from the mini literature review.\nHowever, when this scenario arises but the researcher wishes\nto concentrate on some of the research problems or ques-\ntions, the research scope or boundary needs to be defined or\nclearly stated to show, which of them will be addressed in the\nresearch. Due to the fact that a form of literature has to be\nreviewed, relevant references must be cited in this section.\nTherefore, personal unsubstantiated statements cannot be the\nbasis of research gap(s) and for that matter, research problem\nor research question(s).\nResearch Aim and Objectives\nThe experience of the authors bespeaks that some students\ntend to have difficulties differentiating between research aim\nand objectives. A research aim is basically a purpose state-\nment that defines the trajectory or route and destination of\nresearch. It is simply a catchy re-statement of the research\ntopic and, thus, when the research topic has been appropri-\nately phrased and very clear, it is easy to state the research\naim. The research aim is meant to address the research\nproblem or question(s). It needs to be clearly stated in one to\nthree sentences and only one research aim is needed even at\nthe master's and PhD levels because as earlier indicated, a\nresearch aim is catchy re-statement of the research topic and\nthe researcher will be dealing with only one research topic.\nThe realization of the research aim will, however, require\nthe pursuit of individual measurable objectives, which should\nalso be clearly stated. Thus, research objectives are a transla-\ntion of the aim into operational statements and tell the reader\nhow the overall research aim will be realized or achieved. In\nthe statement of research objectives, specificity and unambi-\nguity are important; that is, the objectives need to be specific\nand should be stated in an unambiguous manner. In addition,\nresearch objectives need to be realistic and it should be pos-\nsible to investigate them within a specified period of time\nbecause, as already noted supra, research will have to be car-\nried out within a given time frame. The research objectives\nshould leave the reader in no doubt as to what the proposed\nresearch precisely seeks to investigate.\nResearch objectives could be stated in bullet points or\nnumbered and typically between three and five objectives\nwill suffice even at the PhD level. Research aim and objec-\ntives are appropriately phrased using verbs such as \"to inves-\ntigate,\" \"to examine,\" \"to evaluate,\" \"to assess,\" \"to\ndetermine,\" \"to develop,\" \"to measure,\" \"to explore,\" and so\non. Such verbs are used to show that the research is \"do-\nable\" (Farrell, 2011) and will be critical and analytical in\nnature rather than descriptive. Examples are shown in\nIt is not uncommon to see statements such as the follow-\ning: \"to gain knowledge and understanding or to understand\n. . .\" (see, for example, Farrell, 2011) and \"to make recom-\nmendations\" as statements of research objectives. However,\nsuch statements cannot be research objectives. Regarding the\nfirst phrase, the overarching purpose of conducting research\nis to gain knowledge and understanding of a phenomenon or\nto understand a phenomenon or issue but that knowledge and\nunderstanding is gained after research objectives have been\ninvestigated and it is those objectives that need to be formu-\nlated and stated. Similarly, in terms of the second phrase,\nrecommendations are made after research objectives have\nbeen investigated and based on the research findings. Thus,\nrecommendations are an end product of investigating objec-\ntives. When research is conducted and reported, recommen-\ndations will be made any way and so it is needless to tell the\nreader the obvious.\nIt is also not uncommon to see research objectives and\nhypotheses (hypothesis for singular) stated in dissertations or\ntheses, and indeed, authors such as Farrell (2011) and Naoum\n(2013) create the impression that research objectives and\nhypotheses need to be stated in a research proposal. This,\nhowever, is problematic. A hypothesis has been defined by\nthat a variable has a causal effect on another variable. It is a\nsuggested explanation for a group of facts or phenomenon\neither accepted as a basis for further verification or accepted\ndefine it as a statement, conjecture, speculation, or an educa-\ntive guess, which is a reasonable suggestion of a causal rela-\ntionship between two variables.\nBased on the above definitions, a hypothesis can be\ndescribed as a testable proposition about the relationship that\nexists between two or more variables, concepts, or events. A\nnull hypothesis means there is no relationship between the\nvariables, concepts, or events. It is a research objective that\nis re-phrased as a research hypothesis and vice versa. For\nexample, an objective such as \"to examine the impact of\nprice on demand for goods and services\" (which can also be\nphrased as \"to investigate the extent to which price affects\nthe demand for goods and services\") could be re-phrased into\na hypothesis such as \"price affects the demand for goods and\nservices\" or \"price is a determinant of demand for goods and\nservices.\" Thus, once research objectives are stated, it is not\nnecessary to state hypotheses or when hypotheses are stated,\nit is needless to state research objectives; stating the two will\nbe tautological. Research objectives or hypotheses serve the\nsame purpose. Normally, research objectives are investigated\nwhile hypotheses are tested but the process of investigating\nresearch objectives or testing hypotheses is the same and the\nend results are also the same.\nStatement of research objectives or hypotheses (but not\nboth) in a research proposal and for that matter, in a disserta-\ntion or thesis is a sine qua non. This is because the research\nobjectives or hypotheses drive or determine the rest of what\nAbdulai and Owusu-Ansah 7\nis to be done. The chapters on: (a) critical and analytical\nreview of the main literature (an expansion of the mini litera-\nture review in the research proposal) including the develop-\nment of an appropriate theoretical framework (for MPhil and\nPhD theses); (b) research methodology; (c) data presenta-\ntion, analysis, and discussion; and (d) summary of research\nfindings or conclusions, limitations, and recommendations\nwill all be based on the research objectives or hypotheses.\nFor example, a discussion of the research methodology\nincluding the design of research instrument for data collec-\ntion must be linked to the research objectives or hypotheses\nand the research objectives or hypotheses will form the\nthemes in data presentation, analysis, and discussion.\nFurthermore, in the summary of research findings or conclu-\nsions, limitations, and recommendations chapter, the sum-\nmary of research findings will be linked to the research\nobjectives or hypotheses to establish the extent to which the\nobjectives or hypotheses have been investigated or tested. It\nis, therefore, inconceivable for a dissertation or theses not to\nhave research objectives or hypotheses.\nThus, in summary, first of all, the research problem or\nresearch question(s) are to be identified and stated based on\nthe research gap(s) established in the mini literature review.\nSecond, to address the research problem or questions(s), a\nresearch aim is formulated. Finally, to realize the research\naim, specific, unambiguous, measurable, achievable, realis-\ntic, and time-bound (SUMART) individual objectives are\nformulated to be investigated or alternatively, hypotheses are\nformulated to be tested. This order of activities is illustrated\ndiagrammatically in Figure 1.\nTable 2. Relationship Between Research Topic, Aim, and Objectives.\nResearch topic Registration of RE ownership and accessibility to formal capital for SMEs: A comparative study of\nBotswana and the Netherlands\nResearch aim The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of RE ownership registration on SMEs' accessibility to\nformal capital on a comparative basis between Botswana and the Netherlands.\nResearch objectives The achievement of the above research aim will require the pursuit of the following objectives:\nTo examine the nature of capital constraints among SMEs;\nTo assess the impact of RE ownership registration on SMEs' access to capital;\nTo evaluate the factors responsible for rejecting SMEs' capital demand by banks and other financial\ninstitutions and the importance of RE ownership registration relative to other factors; and\nTo investigate the differences (if any), which exist between the two countries regarding the effects of\nRE ownership registration on SMEs' access to capital.\nResearch topic Impacts of NRDs on existing inner city shopping centers and other city center retail areas: A case\nstudy of L1 in Liverpool, the United Kingdom\nResearch aim The aim of the research is to examine the impacts of NRDs on existing inner city shopping centers and\nother city center retail areas using L1 in Liverpool as a case study\nResearch objectives The above aim will be achieved by pursuing the following objectives:\nTo examine vacancy rates in Liverpool's existing inner city shopping centers and other city center retail\nTo assess the level of sales experienced by retailers in Liverpool's existing inner city shopping centers\nand other city center retail areas since L1 was opened;\nTo investigate the changes in occupation of retail space in Liverpool's existing inner city shopping\ncenters and other city center retail areas since the opening of L1; and\nTo explore the management strategies adopted by existing inner city shopping center managers and\nindividual shop managers with regard to coping with competition, retaining current business, and\nattracting new business.\nNote.

Order of activities.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe order of research problem or question(s), aim, and\nobjectives has been considered by Naoum (2013). However,\nNaoum's order is problematic as he appears to be putting the\ncart before the horse, particularly, where he places research\nquestions as follows: research aim; research objectives; and\nkey research questions. Naoum's order of activities suggests\nthat it is the research questions that address research objec-\ntives, when it is the other way round. As noted earlier,\nresearch is conducted to address a particular research prob-\nlem or questions. Thus, the research problem or question(s)\nmust first of all be established at the outset based on the\nresearch gap(s) and when this is done, the research aim and\nobjectives or hypotheses will then be formulated to address\nthe research problem or questions(s). Therefore, research\nobjectives or hypotheses are investigated or tested to achieve\nthe research aim and once the research aim is realized or\nachieved, it implies the research problem or question(s)\nwould have been addressed and for that matter, the research\ngap(s) would have also been filled. Consequently, diagram-\nmatically, the arrows in Figure 1 will be reversed from the\nbase as follows in Figure 2.\nResearch Methodology\nThe research aim and objectives or hypotheses that are based\non the research problem or question(s) considered above will\ntell the reader what exactly the researcher intends or wants to\ninvestigate. This section offers the researcher the opportunity\nto explain how the research will be carried out. Thus, research\nmethodology (also known as research approach) is the strat-\negy of investigation, which is about the whole dissertation or\nthesis from the beginning to the end including how the\nresearch objectives have been founded from the research\nproblem, how the literature review has been carried out, pilot\nstudies, data collection, analytical methods, and the process\nof developing findings and conclusions (Farrell, 2011). It is,\ntherefore, a gamut of various issues that are: (a) strategies\nof inquiry; (b) theoretical/secondary and primary data\ncollection; (c) sampling issues; (d) construction of research\ninstrument for primary data collection (design of question-\nnaires and interview schedules or guides), data collection\nprocedures (research methods), ethics, and pilot studies; (e)\ndata presentation, analysis, and discussion; and (f) validation\nof research findings. In this section, the elements of research\nmethodology are treated at a theoretical level first to provide\nan appropriate context before a consideration of what needs\nto be incorporated in the research methodology section in a\nresearch proposal.\nIn the social sciences, there are three research methodolo-\ngies that can be used to conduct academic research. These\nare: (a) quantitative research methodology, also known as the\ntraditional, positivist, or empiricist research approach; (b)\nqualitative research methodology, which is variously referred\nto as the constructivist, naturalistic, interpretative, postposi-\ntivist, or postmodern perspective approach; and (c) mix\nmethodologies and the other terminologies for it are multi-\nmethodology and pragmatic approach--it is an amalgam of\nquantitative and qualitative research methodologies in one\nstudy. The distinguishing features of quantitative and quali-\ntative research methodologies are provided in Table 3.\nResearch methodology is considered by some authors to\nbe the same as research design whereas others treat research\ndesign as a sub-set of research methodology. Kumar (2011),\nfor example, defines a research design as a plan, structure,\nand strategy of investigation so conceived as to obtain\nanswers to research problems or questions. Thus, he consid-\ners research methodology to be the same as research design\nwhere he differentiates between qualitative and quantitative\nresearch designs (also see, for example, Kerlinger, 1986, and\na sub-set of research methodology. Bryman (2012), for\ninstance, defines it as the framework for collecting data and\nanalysis--the focus here is only data collection and analysis.\nAlbeit the literature is ambivalent regarding the distinction\nbetween research methodology and research design, the\nauthors of this article are of the opinion that they are the\nsame and can be used interchangeably.\nRegarding research paradigm and methodology, there is a\ndifference between them. A research paradigm is a collection\nof assumptions and beliefs that guide the path of conducting\nresearch and interpreting findings (Koshy, Koshy, &\nWaterman, 2010). Thus, it can be described as a matrix of\ntheoretical mind-sets that underpin a research methodology\nor approach. For example, an assumption in the quantitative\nresearch methodology is that knowledge (epistemology) is\nreal and exists (ontology) there in the world that can be\nobjectively and quantitatively measured and that is an ele-\nment of a research paradigm in the quantitative research\nmethodology. Epistemological and ontological issues are\ntreated later. In terms of the qualitative research methodol-\nogy, the assumption is that knowledge is real and exists there\nResearch Gap(s)\nResearch Problem or Question(s)\nResearch Aim\nResearch Objectives or Hypotheses\nFigure 2. Addressing research problem or question(s)\nAbdulai and Owusu-Ansah 9\nin the world that can be subjectively and qualitatively mea-\nsured and that is also an element of a research paradigm in\nthe qualitative research methodology.\nStrategies of Inquiry\nVarious types exist in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed\nmethodologies, which have been considered by authors such\nCoghlan and Brannick (2014), and summarized as follows.\nSurveys.A survey is a system of gathering information and\nincludes cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that use\nmostly questionnaires, interviews, and observation for data\ncollection. In a cross-sectional survey, all the data on rele-\nvant variables are collected at the same time or within a rela-\ntively short time frame. It, therefore, provides a snapshot of\nthe variables included in the investigation at one particular\npoint in time. However, in longitudinal surveys, data are\ncollected over long periods of time. Measurements are taken\non each variable over two or more distinct time periods.\nThis permits the measurement of change in variables over\ntime.\nExperiments. The basic intent of an experiment is to test the\nimpact of a treatment or an intervention on an outcome (the\neffect--dependent variable), while controlling all other fac-\ntors (the determinants or causes--independent variables)\nthat might influence that outcome. Experimental strategies\nare normally used in the physical sciences where the experi-\nments are laboratory-based. However, they can be used in the\nsocial sciences--when they are used in the social sciences,\nthe experiment is field-based.\nEthnography.This is where the researcher studies an intact\ncultural group in a natural setting over a prolonged period of\ntime by collecting primarily observational data. The research\nprocess is flexible and typically evolves contextually in\nresponse to the lived realities encountered in the field\nsetting.\nTable 3. Characteristics of Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methodologies.\nQuantitative research methodology Qualitative research methodology\n1 It is an inquiry into a social or human problem based\nnormally on testing a theory composed of variables,\nmeasured with numbers, and analyzed using statistical\nprocedures to determine whether the predictive\ngeneralizations of the theory hold true.\nIt is an inquiry process of comprehending a social or human\nproblem based on building a complex holistic picture formed with\nwords, reporting detailed views of informants and conducted in a\nnatural setting.\n2 It views truthfulness or reality to exist in the world,\nwhich can be objectively measured.\nIt views truthfulness or reality to exist in the world that can be\nsubjectively measured.\n3 In terms of the relationship between the investigator and\nwhat is being investigated, the quantitative research\nmethodology holds that the researcher should remain\ndistant and independent of what is being researched to\nensure an objective assessment of the situation.\nThe inquirer normally goes to the site of the target participants\nto conduct the research. This enables the researcher to develop\na level of detail about the individual or place and to be highly\ninvolved in the actual experiences of the participants.\n4 It is not value-laden as the researchers' values are kept\nout of the study.\nIt is value-laden as the personal self becomes inseparable from the\nresearcher self.\n5 The entire process uses the deductive form of reasoning\nor logic wherein theories and hypotheses are tested\nin cause-and-effect order. Concepts, variables, and\nhypotheses are chosen before the study begins and\nremain fixed throughout the study. The intent of the\nstudy is to develop generalizations that contribute\nto the theory and that enable one to better predict,\nexplain, and comprehend a phenomenon.\nThe reasoning adopted in qualitative research is largely inductive.\nVarious aspects or categories emerge from those under\ninvestigation rather than are identified a priori by the researcher.\nThis emergence provides information leading to patterns or\ntheories that help explain a phenomenon. Theory or hypotheses\nare, therefore, not established a priori. The research objectives\nmay change and be refined as the inquirer learns what question\nto ask and to whom. The methodology is, therefore, emergent\nrather than tightly pre-figured.\n6 Regarding research methods (particularly, primary data\ncollection procedures), questionnaires are used and\nthe questions asked are largely closed-ended where\noptional responses are provided.\nInterviews are used for primary data collection and the questions\nasked are mainly open-ended where no optional responses are\nprovided.\n7 There is descriptive and inferential numeric analysis of\ndata using statistical packages.\nCollection of text data, description, and analysis of text or pictures/\nimages, representation of information in figures and tables, all\ninform qualitative research. Data are coded and analyzed using\nqualitative software packages.\nGrounded theory. In grounded theory, the researcher attempts\nto derive a theory of a process, action, behavior, or interac-\ntion grounded in the views of participants in the study. This\nprocess involves multiple stages of data collection and the\nrefinement and interrelationship of categories of\ninformation.\nCase study.It is an in-depth systematic investigation of a\nphenomenon (which can be a program, an event, an activity,\na process, a geographical location, one or more individuals,\netc.) by a researcher. The cases are bounded by time and\nactivity and researchers collect detailed information using a\nvariety of data collection procedures over a sustained period\nof time.\nPhenomenology. It is the study of everyday life. In phenome-\nnological studies, the investigator identifies the \"essence\" of\nhuman experiences concerning a phenomenon as described\nby participants in a study. Comprehending the \"lived experi-\nences\" marks phenomenology as a philosophy as well as an\napproach and the procedure involves studying a small num-\nber of subjects or participants via extensive and prolonged\nengagement to develop patterns and relationships of mean-\ning. In this process, the researcher \"brackets\" his experiences\nto understand those of the participants in the study.\nNarrative research.It is a form of inquiry in which the\nresearcher studies the lives of individuals and asks one or\nmore individuals to provide stories about their lives. The\ninformation is then re-told or re-storied by the researcher into\na narrative chronology.\nAction research. Action research, variously known as partici-\npatory action research, community-based study, co-operative\ninquiry, action science, problem-solving research, and action\nlearning, is the study of a social situation carried out by those\ninvolved in that situation to improve both their practice and\nthe quality of their understanding of the situation. Practitio-\nners, industrialists, and students from the professional back-\ngrounds normally adopt this strategy of inquiry by identifying\na problem in the course of their work and to investigate it in\norder to propose changes that will improve an existing\nsituation.\nSequential procedure. Inasequentialprocedure,theresearcher\nseeks to elaborate on or expand the findings of one research\nmethodology with another research methodology. This may\ninvolve beginning with a qualitative research methodology\nfor exploratory purposes and following up with a quantita-\ntive research methodology. When the researcher begins with\nqualitative research methodology followed by quantitative\nresearch methodology, it is termed a sequential exploratory\nstrategy. Here, priority is given to the qualitative aspect of\nthe study. The findings of the two phases are then integrated\nduring the interpretation phase. The purpose of this strategy\nis to use quantitative data and results to assist in interpreting\nqualitative findings.\nAlternatively, the study may begin with a quantitative\nresearch approach followed by the collection and analysis of\nqualitative data. Priority is typically given to the quantitative\ndata and the two research methodologies are integrated dur-\ning the interpretation phase of the study. This procedure is\ntermed a sequential explanatory strategy. The purpose of a\nsequential explanatory strategy typically is to use qualitative\nresults to assist in explaining and interpreting the findings of\na primarily quantitative study. It is better suited for explain-\ning relationships. It can be, especially, useful when unex-\npected results arise from a quantitative study. In this case, the\nqualitative data collection that follows can be used to exam-\nine these surprising results in more detail.\nConcurrent procedure.Unlike a sequential procedure above\nwhere the researcher begins with one methodology and fol-\nlows with another in stages, in a concurrent procedure, the\ninvestigator converges quantitative and qualitative data to\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of the research problem.\nIn this design, the investigator collects both quantitative and\nqualitative data at the same time during the data collection\nstage and then integrates the information in the analysis and\ninterpretation of the overall results. The researcher may nest\none form of data within another and this is called a concur-\nrent nested strategy. Given less priority, a quantitative\nresearch methodology is embedded or nested within a promi-\nnent qualitative research methodology or the vice versa. This\nnesting may mean that the embedded research methodology\naddresses a different issue than the dominant research meth-\nodology or seeks information from different levels. The data\ncollected from the two research methodologies are mixed\nduring the analysis phase of the project.\nThe concurrent nested strategy is often used so that the\nresearcher can gain broader perspectives as a result of using\ntwo approaches rather than using only one research method-\nology. For example, a primarily qualitative research design\ncould embed some quantitative data to enrich the description\nof the sample participants.\nTransformative procedure.In this procedure, the researcher\nuses a theoretical lens as an overarching perspective within a\nresearch design that contains both quantitative and qualita-\ntive data. The theoretical perspective can be based on, for\ninstance, ideologies such as advocacy. Within this lens could\nbe a data collection method that involves a sequential or con-\ncurrent strategy. The perspective is reflected in the research\nproblem or research question(s).\nReflection on strategies of inquiry. Sequential, concurrent, and\ntransformative procedures are strategies of inquiry in the\nmulti-methodology. However, in terms of the other strate-\ngies, as Farrell (2011) aptly notes, they \"are not closed\nboxes\" (p. 77) and can, therefore, fit into quantitative or\nAbdulai and Owusu-Ansah 11\nqualitative studies. For example, surveys and case studies\ncan be strategies in both quantitative and qualitative research.\nSometimes, surveys or case studies are referred to as research\nmethodology. However, from the preceding discourse, they\nare not research methodologies by themselves--they are\nrather strategies of inquiry within research methodologies.\nIn making a decision as to the methodology to use and\nsubsequently, the strategy of inquiry to adopt, researchers\nneed to consider their philosophical stance regarding episte-\nmological and ontological issues (Koshy et al., 2010).\nEpistemology is the theory of knowledge and it presents a\nview and justification for what can be regarded as knowl-\nedge; that is, what can be known and the criteria that knowl-\nedge must satisfy to be called knowledge rather than beliefs\n(Blaikie, 1993). What people say, how what they say is inter-\npreted, and what they do are all important regarding, for\nexample, an action researcher for knowledge creation (Koshy\net al., 2010). Ontology, is about the theory of being and its\nmandate is the development of strategies that can illuminate\nthe components of people's social reality; that is, about what\nexists, what it looks like, the units that make it up, and how\nthese units interact with each other (Blaikie, 1993). For\ninstance, within action research, researchers would consider\nthis reality as socially constructed and not external and inde-\npendent and the stories they tell will be based on subjective\naccounts from the people who live within their environ-\nment--thus, the methods of data collection they use will be\nconsistent with their ontological stance (Koshy et al., 2010).\nTypes of Data and Research Methods\nAs earlier indicated, there are two main types of data that can\nbe used in the above three research methodologies. These\nare: (a) secondary data, which refers to any published and\nunpublished material (e.g., materials from books, journals,\nnewspapers, reports, magazines, undergraduate and post-\ngraduate dissertations or theses, online materials, databases,\nvideo and audio recordings, photographs, films, and com-\nputer-based programs)--thus, a literature review is part of\nsecondary data collection; and (b) primary data--it is \"first\nhand\" information gathered via procedures such as observa-\ntion, interviews, questionnaires, and direct experiences. The\nquestionnaires (normally used in quantitative studies) can be\nadministered via mail/post, fax, Internet (web-based or\nemail), or face-to-face whereas interviews (often used in\nqualitative studies) can be conducted face-to-face, over the\nphone, or using a voice-over-IP service such as Skype.\nInterviews can be unstructured, semi-structured, or struc-\ntured, and the difference between them has been explained\nlows. Unstructured interviews (also called intensive, infor-\nmal, or in-depth interviews) are like journalistic interviews\nwith a guide prepared on the areas or issues one intends to\nask questions about. There are, therefore, no specific ques-\ntions or specific order. The wording and sequence of\nquestions to be asked depend on the answers the respondent\ngives to an initial question. It is assumed that the respondents\nhave particular experiences or are knowledgeable about\nsome subjects on which they can elaborate. The respondents\nare, thus, referred to as key informants and purposively cho-\nsen. Semi-structured interviews are more formal in compari-\nson with unstructured interviews in that specific questions\nare asked although they are not asked in any specific order\nand normally, no interview schedule is used. Regarding\nstructured interviews, an interview schedule is prepared\nwhere questions are presented in the same order and with the\nsame wording to all the respondents. Interviews can be con-\nducted on one-to-one or focus group basis. Focus groups/\ngroup interviews are open discussions between members of a\ngroup and the researcher.\nIt is the preceding data collection procedures that are\noften referred to as research methods. The questionnaires\nand interview schedules or guides prepared are known as the\nresearch instrument for primary data collection.\nSampling Issues\nIn the collection of primary data, a sample population (sam-\nple size) is normally selected from the target total population\n(sampling frame) and surveyed. In using questionnaires as\nthe research instrument and, particularly, where they are\nadministered via the Internet or post, one way to determine\nthe sample size is to distribute the questionnaires to all mem-\nbers of the sampling frame or a pre-determined sub-popula-\ntion of the sampling frame. The number of completed\nquestionnaires that are returned constitutes the response rate\nand that becomes the sample size. However, in geographical\nlocations where the Internet or postal system is not well\ndeveloped, this technique of determining the sample size\nmay be difficult, if not impossible, to implement.\nIn the light of the above problem, other methods that can\nbe explored are probability and non-probability sampling\ntechniques. The other name for probability sampling is ran-\ndom sampling. Random sampling generally incorporates\nsome type of systematic selection procedure to ensure that\neach unit or element in the sampling frame has an equal\nchance of being selected. The use of random sampling is\nbased on an implicit assumption that a sampling frame can\nbe established. Thus, where it is not possible to determine the\nsampling frame or an adequate sampling fame does not exist,\nrandom sampling cannot be used. Examples of random sam-\npling are simple random sampling, systematic sampling,\nstratified sampling, and cluster sampling, which have been\nextensively covered in the works of authors such as Morse\nNon-probability sampling focuses on volunteer potential\nsubjects, easily available potential subjects, or those who just\nhappen to be present when the research is carried out. There\nis no any systematic selection procedure. Non-random sam-\nples are mostly used in qualitative studies, pilot studies, and\nmarket research, consulting with experts or in circumstances\nwhere adequate sampling frames are unavailable (Lincoln &\nposive, and snowball sampling techniques are examples of\nnon-random sampling, which are also well treated by the\nabove authors.\nDesign of Research Instrument for Primary Data\nCollection and Pilot Studies\nIn designing a research instrument, it is important to note that\nquestions are asked to solicit information that will enable the\ninvestigation of research objectives (or testing of hypothe-\nses). There is, therefore, the need for the research instrument\nto be explicitly linked to research objectives. When a ques-\ntion is being constructed, it is critical to ask oneself how the\nresponse to that question will help in investigating a particu-\nlar research objective or part of it. Indeed, it might be useful\nto sectionalize the whole research instrument thematically\nbased on the research objectives in order to ensure that most,\nif not all, of the information that is needed to address the\nobjectives is obtained.\nA pilot study is described by Bell (1996, cited in Naoum,\n2013) as getting the bugs out of the research instrument so\nthat subjects in the main study will not experience difficul-\nties in completing it and for a preliminary analysis to be car-\nried out to determine whether or not the wording and format\nof questions will present difficulties when the main data are\ncollected and analyzed. It, therefore, provides a trial run that\ninvolves testing the wording of questions, identifying ambig-\nuous questions, testing the data collection method, and mea-\nsuring the effectiveness of standard invitation to respondents\n(Naoum, 2013). At the MPhil and PhD levels, a pilot study\ncan be carried out although this might not be possible for\nundergraduate dissertations due to time constraints.\nEthical Issues\nIn conducting research (laboratory-based or field-based),\nthere is the need to normally ensure people are not harmed\nphysically or emotionally and that is what ethical consider-\nations are about. The researcher has a responsibility to ensure\nthat research participants are protected (O'Leary, 2013).\nApart from not doing harm, there is also the need to be truth-\nful to the process (Coghlan & Brannick, 2014). Curtis and\nCurtis (2011) observe that the most important aspect of an\nethically appropriate research is voluntary informed consent.\nIn terms of recruiting participants, Curtis and Curtis explain\nthe following: voluntary as the notion of free will; informed\nas referring to the provision of enough information about\nwhat will be asked of them; and consent as the formal pro-\ncess, which they affirm that they have been provided with all\nthe information they require and are agreeing to take part out\nof their own free will. The process of gaining informed con-\nsent includes the provision of a participant with information\nsheet (PIS), which contains all the information the partici-\npant needs to make an informed decision about participation\ndata collection commences, ethical approval will have to be\nobtained from the researcher's institution.\nData Analysis and Validation of Research Findings\nAfter gathering the relevant data for the research, it has to be\npresented, analyzed, and discussed. A starting point is nor-\nmally to clean, transcribe (if recordings were done during the\ndata collection stage), and to code the data in an appropriate\nstatistical package such as STATA or SPSS (quantitative\nstudies) or qualitative data analysis software package such as\nNVivo (qualitative studies) for analysis. Content analysis can\nbe carried out where appropriate. It is a tool used to deter-\nmine the presence of certain words or concepts within texts\nor sets of texts by quantifying and analyzing the presence,\nmeanings, and relationships of such words and concepts\n(Palmquist, Carley, & Dale, 1997). There are two types,\nwhich are conceptual and relational analyses.\nAt an advanced level such as MPhil and doctoral studies,\nit is important to validate research findings albeit this is not\nnormally required at the undergraduate or MSc levels. Two\ncommon procedures that are used to validate findings are\nexplained as follows. One procedure is triangulation where\ntwo or more techniques are used in the investigation of a\nphenomenon to enhance confidence in the ultimate findings.\nFor example, the research methodologies, including data col-\nlection procedures, data sources, and survey participants can\nbe triangulated to validate the findings. The second proce-\ndure is to withhold a percentage of the data collected that is\nthen presented and analyzed later and compared with the ini-\ntial findings. This procedure, however, appears problematic\nas it is actually a continuation of data presentation, analysis,\nand discussion and not research validation in the real sense\nbecause it is the same data set that is used, just that the data\nare analyzed at a different time.\nWhat to Include in the Research Methodology\nSection\nUnder the research methodology section, a detailed treat-\nment of all the research methodological issues is not needed\nsince it will be considered in the research methodology chap-\nter during the write-up stage of the dissertation or thesis.\nWhat is required in this section is for the researcher to laconi-\ncally demonstrate awareness of the research methodology\nprocess in the social sciences in a logical manner. Thus, any\nconsideration of the theoretical issues should be as brief as\npossible by concentrating on the important and salient issues\nthat will inform how the research will be conducted. The\nresearch methodologies available in the social sciences\nshould be briefly explained and a justification provided for\nthe choice of a particular methodology.\nAbdulai and Owusu-Ansah 13\nThe selection of a research methodology needs to be\nexplicitly linked to the research objectives or hypotheses.\nTherefore, there is the need to explain clearly how each of\nthe research objectives will be investigated. If it is one\nresearch methodology that will be adopted to investigate all\nthe stated research objectives, then the linkage will be obvi-\nous and does not need an explanation. However, where the\nmulti-methodology will be adopted, there has to be an expla-\nnation regarding which research methodology will be used to\naddress which of the research objectives. For instance, if\nthere are four stated research objectives, the quantitative\nresearch methodology might be used to investigate two of\nthe research objectives whereas the qualitative research\nmethodology may be used to investigate the remaining\nresearch objectives, and this needs to be explained and justi-\nfied. Following on, the strategy of inquiry, research methods,\nand research instrument to be used, how the survey partici-\npants will be selected, and how the data to be collected will\nbe analyzed should be explicated. If a pilot study will be car-\nried out, it should be indicated. Also, it should be indicated\nthat ethical issues will be considered and that before the pri-\nmary data collection process begins, ethical approval will be\nobtained. Finally, it will be necessary to state that the first\npart of the research methodology will consist of a critical\nreview of the relevant literature in order to, among other\nthings, identify the appropriate theoretical framework for the\nresearch and to help in designing the rest of the research\nmethodology. Research methodology can be likened to the\n\"foundation\" of a building in construction and, therefore,\nneeds to be robust; if it is weak, the research will also be\nweak.\nResearch Significance/Importance\nThe importance of the research must be considered by justi-\nfying the need for the research. This will require some refer-\nence to be made to the research gap(s), problem, or\nquestion(s), and an explanation of how the proposed research\nwill contribute to existing body of knowledge (novelty) as\nwell as explaining how the outcomes of the research are\nlikely to benefit the following stakeholders where applica-\nble: (a) academia, (b) individuals and communities, (c)\nindustry and commerce, and (d) policymakers nationally and\ninternationally.\nResearch Program\nAs earlier indicated, time and resources regarding, particu-\nlarly, pecuniary legacy for the conduct of any research are\nnormally limited. Thus, there is the need for a research pro-\ngram. It indicates the principal or milestone activities to be\ncarried out and the time line for such activities. The research\nprogram will be used by the supervisor to monitor the prog-\nress made by the student once the research commences so\nthat any issues can be identified and addressed. The research\nprogram can be indicated in a tabular form or diagrammati-\ncally, for example, in the form of a Gantt chart and it can be\nembedded in the research program section or added as an\nappendix.\nReferences\nIn the above sections, relevant references will have been\ncited in-text where necessary in accordance with a particular\nreferencing style. It is in this section that the full references\nwill be provided in accordance with the same referencing\nstyle used for the in-text citations. The references should be\nlisted in an alphabetical order. Sources from which one can\ndraw information are varied as alluded to above. However, it\nis not advisable to rely heavily on websites as they are often\nnot considered a good source of materials. Thus, websites\nshould be used sparingly. The most highly regarded sources\nof materials are academic journals (including online jour-\nnals) and research monographs, followed by text books.\nQuantity, quality, and currency of references are of impor-\ntance here.\nThere can also be a bibliography section, which should be\ntitled \"Bibliography\" after the references section. The dic-\ntionary definition does not differentiate between references\nand bibliography. However, in academic writings, there is a\ndifference between the two albeit some authors use them\ninterchangeably perhaps based on the dictionary definition.\nAs Farrell (2011) explains, references are everything cited in\nthe dissertation. Thus, references that are specifically cited\nin-text will be fully listed under references. However, Farrell\ndescribes bibliography as everything that has been read or\nbrowsed, which is relevant to the subject area but has not\nbeen cited. It is, therefore, any material that is consulted to\nhelp shape the ideas of the researcher but has not been used\nin a manner to warrant in-text citation. For example, if a stu-\ndent consults somebody's dissertation or thesis to gain ideas\nregarding how to appropriately phrase a research topic, the\nstudent cannot cite that person in stating his research topic in\nhis dissertation or thesis. However, to acknowledge that per-\nson, the full reference to that dissertation or thesis will be\nlisted under bibliography. Similarly, references that may be\nrelevant to the research but have not been used in a manner\nto warrant in-text citation will be listed under bibliography\nfor further reading.\nResearch Proposal Components That\nAre Supposed to Feature in the Final\nThesis or Dissertation\nBased on experience, some students, especially, at the under-\ngraduate and master's levels, reproduce all the contents of\nthe research proposal in the introductory chapter of the dis-\nsertation, which is inappropriate. The introductory chapter is\nnamed \"Chapter One\" and its title is \"Introduction.\" The\nmain relevant sections in this chapter are: (a) research\nbackground; (b) research aim and objectives; (c) research\nmethodology; (d) summary of main research findings, limita-\ntions, and recommendations; (e) research significance/impor-\ntance; and (f) structure/organization of dissertation. The\nintroductory chapter serves a dual purpose by first, setting the\nappropriate scene for the research conducted and second,\nencapsulating what was researched and why it had to be\nresearched, how it was researched, what was found, limita-\ntions, and the way forward or recommendations; that is, it\nprovides a snapshot of the research that has been conducted.\nSections of the research proposal that should appear in the\ndissertation or thesis are the \"research background,\" \"research\naim and objectives,\" \"research methodology,\" and \"research\nsignificance/importance,\" of course, with appropriate amend-\nments where necessary because the main literature review\nwould have been carried out and the whole research con-\nducted. The contents of the research methodology section in\nthis chapter are supposed to be very laconic as there will be a\nchapter devoted to it in the dissertation or thesis.\nConclusion\nThis article has considered the essential elements of a good\nproposal for both undergraduate and postgraduate students in\nthe social sciences and it is hoped that the students would\nfind it intellectually stimulating and insightful.\nAlthough a theoretical framework, which is about the rel-\nevant theory or theories that underpin a particular study, is an\nimperative at a more advanced level such as MPhil or PhD, it\nhas not been considered above. This is because settling on a\nrelevant underpinning theory or theories is difficult, takes\ntime, and will not normally crystallize at the research pro-\nposal writing stage until the main literature has been criti-\ncally reviewed following the commencement of the research.\nThus, what is required at the mini literature review stage is\nfor the prospective researcher to bear in mind that a theoreti-\ncal framework has to be ultimately developed if it is an\nMPhil or doctoral research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbdulai, R.
