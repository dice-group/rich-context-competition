    "abstract": "Abstract\nTobacco use is the most preventable cause of chronic diseases and cancers worldwide. In south-western Taiwan, tobacco\nuse has become one of the top risk behaviors. Smoking in young people has been associated with alcohol addiction and drug\nabuse in later life; and most smokers start young. Initiation of cigarette smoking at an early age leads to more life-years of\ntobacco use, makes quitting harder, and increases the risk for serious health consequences. How adolescent boys effectively\ncontrol their tobacco use is still uncertain. The article explores on the experience of 12 adolescent boys in south-western\nTaiwan controlling tobacco use as a result of participating in a smoking prevention education program. In addition to the\nuse of interviews and focus groups as the traditional method of data gathering, the lead author also included the use of\nparticipants' paintings as representations of the participants' lived experience of the phenomenon. The findings of the study\nsuggest that adolescent boys with smoking experience in Taiwan had the desire to control their smoking behavior after\nobtaining information through a local education program. In addition, they chose suitable methods for controlling their\nsmoking based on the information that had been provided.\n",

By 2010, the number of high school students in the\ncountry had tried more than one cigarette by the age of 18\nwas 66.4% of Taiwanese teenagers (Department of Health,\n2013). Initial experimentation with tobacco by adolescents\ncan have a long-term impact on their lives and on society\nsmoking is sometimes related to more serious drug and alco-\nsocial problems. This article is part of a larger study con-\nducted by the lead author that initially investigated the moti-\nvation behind why south-western Taiwanese adolescent\nmales chose to smoke tobacco. It was identified that there\nwas no study that explored if adolescent Taiwanese boys\nwould be affected in controlling their smoking behavior if\nthey were involved in an education program. In addition, the\nsmoking prevalence of male adolescents is 2 times that of\nfemale adolescents (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2012).\nThe goal of this article, therefore, is to explore on the experi-\nences of controlling tobacco use among adolescent boys in\nsouth-western Taiwan who have been involved in an educa-\ntion program regarding smoking.\nSocietal Background\nAdolescence is a critical stage for physical and psychological\ndevelopment. It is a time when adolescents seek freedom,\nautonomy, and excitement (Johnson, Kalaw, Lovato, Baillie,\nof rules. Smoking is one of the behaviors that teenagers use\nto express their freedom. Most adolescents in Taiwan begin\nsmoking between the ages of 11 and 14 and become regular\ncharacteristics of adolescence, adolescent smoking was asso-\nciated with parental smoking, peer-group smoking, stress,\npoor self-esteem, body image dissatisfaction, risk-taking\nbehavior, and poor physical health (Croghan et al., 2006;\nJohnson et al., 2004; Teevale, Denny, Nosa, & Sheridan,\n2013).

Yet although significant efforts have\nbeen made to reduce the prevalence of smoking in adoles-\ncence (Wakefield, Dphil, Nichter, & Giovino, 2003; Wilson\net al., 2012), smoking rates at this life stage remain high\nworldwide. Since 1990, various antismoking campaigns\nhave been implemented including the enactment of the\nTobacco Hazards Act in 2009 by the Taiwanese government\n(Department of Health, 2013). However, despite these\nefforts, by 2010 the percentage of boys smoking had risen to\nrelated to the control of smoking behavior among adolescent\nboys have been undertaken, although some quit attempts\nhave been reported in adolescent boys and girls (Stanton et\ninvestigated African American youth (n = 140) and European\nAmerican (n = 570) daily smokers' efforts at self-quitting\n(total n = 980). They found that there was no significant dif-\nference at self-quit attempts in gender or age distribution\naccording to ethnicity. Elsewhere, it has been suggested that\na greater focus on educating boys'programs could be benefi-\ncial in adolescent's self-quit attempts (Vuckovic, Polen, &\nObjective\nThe objective of this research was to understand the lived\nexperiences of smoking among male adolescent, in particular\naround controlling tobacco use of 12 adolescent boys in\nsouth-western Taiwan who were involved in a smoking pre-\nvention education program.\nMethod\nQualitative methodology was used in this study. The purpose\nof using qualitative inquiry is to gain an understanding\n(Runswick-Cole, 2012) of adolescent male's experience of\ncontrolling smoking through establishing the meanings,\nthoughts, and ideas of phenomena rather than predict out-\ncomes from data. Through the qualitative methodology, the\nmeanings of the controlling smoking were established by in-\ndepth semi-structured interviews and drawings.\nParticipants in this study were high school students aged\nbetween 13 to 18 years who self-identified as having smoked\non more than two occasions, were current smokers, and will-\ning to share their experiences of smoking. Ethics approval\nwas granted from the Human Research Ethics Committee of\nthe University Hospital. Once ethics approval had been\nobtained and permission from the president of the high\nschool was received, the researcher circulated a flyer inviting\ninterested students to be part of the study. Acceptance of the\ninvitation required the students to contact the researcher by\nphone to express a personal interest in being interviewed\nabout their experiences of smoking. Prior to the commence-\nment of the study, informed consent was obtained in writing\nfrom the participants and their guardian(s). Twelve partici-\npants in total chose to be involved in the study. Participation\nwas voluntary. All participants completed the study.\nAs this study is based on the lived experience, an interpre-\ntive research was considered appropriate for the inquiry. To\nobtain multiple perspectives about how adolescent males\ncontrol their smoking behaviors, three sources of data were\ncollected: (a) individual participant interviews, (b) one focus\ngroup, and (c) individual participant paintings/drawings.\nParticipants\nAs part of a larger study investigating smoking behaviors in\nTaiwanese adolescent males, this study sample consisted of\n12 adolescent boys with smoking experience. The larger\nstudy was a two-group longitudinal research designed to\nexamine the effects of the smoking education program on\ntobacco use. The inclusion criteria of this study were\nTaiwanese boys who had experience of smoking, were aged\nbetween 13 and 18 years, and who had initiated cigarette\nsmoking between 11 and 14 years, as this indicated the par-\nticipants were habitual smokers. All of the participants'\nfathers were smokers, and 2 of the participants had parents\nwho both smoked. Eleven of the participants' family eco-\nnomic status was below the average. Their fathers' careers\nwere either fishermen or laborers. The average number of\ncigarettes smoked by the participants was from 5 to 10 daily.\nAll of them participated in the smoking education program.\nThe Smoking Education Program\nThis study was designed to elicit an in-depth understanding\nof the lived experiences of adolescent male smokers in terms\nof the control of smoking while participating in an education\nprogram that focused on the potential illness consequences\nof smoking. The smoking education program included three\nsessions (risks of tobacco use, government laws, and media\ninfluence) and each session was taught by local doctors and\nnurse practitioners from local hospitals for 1 hr each in the\nclassroom of a local high school. Diversified teaching and\nlearning materials have been used, including slides, videos,\nlearning sheets, and small-group content discussions in each\nsession. Through this work, adolescents'awareness of tobac-\nco's severe health risks was expected to be improved. In\nTable 1, the flow for the program is summarized with the\ntopics for the education program and the questions used in\nthe interviews.\nHong et al. 3\nData Collection\nEach participant was involved in two-face-to-face audio-\nrecorded interviews at the research site, each of which lasted\nbetween 30 and 45 min. The interviews were designed to\ngain the participants experience by encouraging in-depth\ndata. As a result, open-ended questions were used. All inter-\nviews were audio-taped and observation field notes were\nwritten during each interview. The first interview was to\nprovide the participants an opportunity to describe their\nexperiences of their feeling about smoking. The rationale of\nthe focus group which was conducted after the second edu-\ncation session provided a chance for drawing their experi-\nences of controlling smoking. Such an activity allowed time\nfor quiet reflection on their experiences of controlling smok-\ning and for them to share their experiences with friends. The\nfocus of the second interview was to provide an opportunity\nfor participants to share their experiences of controlling\nsmoking. All data were de-identified and kept securely in\nlocked filing cabinets. All data were collected over a\n9-month period in 2012 by one researcher, thus following a\nconsistent approach to data collection. Pseudonyms were\nused in place of participants' true names to assist in confi-\ndentiality of data.\nData Analysis\nAll interviews were transcribed verbatim and the lead\nresearcher listened to the audio while reading the transcripts\nseveral times, until experiences could be described and\n\"essences\" were identified. These were then clustered into\ncommon themes resulting in five defined categories or\nthemes. These were controlling by sleeping or eating, con-\ntrolling by experiencing distraction with leisure activities,\nthinking of family or friends, thinking about wasting money,\nand thinking about physical weakness or stunted growth.\nFindings\nThe participants indicated how smoking became their daily\nhabits and were unaware of the harm to their health during\nthe first interview. After being exposed to the smoking edu-\ncation program, all participants indicated that they would\nlike to quit/control smoking; however, they still had tobacco\ndependence. The participants described their experiences of\ncontrolling tobacco use that were categorized into the fol-\nlowing themes.\nControlling by Sleeping or Eating (n = 8)\nControl over smoking was associated with sleeping and eat-\ning. Steven, who was curious about tobacco, generally con-\ntrolled smoking by eating: I eat fruit or snacks . . . and after\neating food, I did not want to smoke. Similarly, Peter noted,\nWhen I desire to smoke, I eat something (snacks, fruits, or\nchewing gum), and especially in front of my girlfriend.\nSometimes, I just thought of not smoking in my mind; it\nworked.\nFor others, smoking intensified eating, this resulted in\nthem eating too much without controlling their weight. I felt\nhungry after smoking. I gained weight and felt tired. Also, I\nfelt I had become physically weaker than a year ago when I\nran. Sometimes, I didn't sleep well at night. My skin became\nworse, and had pimples. I was also concerned about my sex-\nual functioning. The education classes indicated that smok-\ning would impair it. I hoped that it would not have too much\ninfluence on my physical condition.\nDavid indicated his use of sleeping and eating to avoid\nsmoking. I used sleeping or eating to control smoking\nalthough it made me fat! It was so boring in a rural county. I\ndidn't know what to do at my free time. There was no super-\nmarket and department store near my home. If I would like to\ncontrol smoking, I slept or ate delicious food. John had the\nTable 1. The Flow of the Topics for the Smoking Education Program and the Questions Used in the Interviews.\nParticipants Topics for smoking education program and interview questions\nParticipant interviews (first round; n = 12) Tobacco use is often top risk behaviors of chronic diseases and cancers.\n How do you feel about smoking?\n Tell me about your family background.\n Initiation of cigarette smoking?\n Tell me more about the stories.\nSmoking education program (1-hr session) Session 1: Risks of tobacco use\nSmoking education program (1-hr session) Session 2: Government laws and adolescent awareness\nFocus group (n = 12) How do you think about yourself?\n Could you draw yourself?\n Describe and share with others about your stories.\nSmoking education program (1-hr session) Session 3: Media influence\nParticipant interviews (second round; n = 12) What is your experience of controlling smoking?\n What is the difficulty for you during the control process?\n Tell me more about your stories.\n4 SAGE Open\nsame opinion: When I slept, I did not think of cigarettes.\nTherefore, I felt that my physical condition became worse,\nand I gained weight. I gained 10 pounds during the 2 years\nafter taking up smoking. My height was still the same. I con-\ntrolled smoking by sleeping.\nBeing Distracted by Leisure Activities (n = 10)\nFor many of the participants, the experience of controlling\nsmoking behavior was assisted by participating in activities\nthey enjoyed, which as a result provided distraction from\nsmoking. Michael said, When I was playing basketball, I\nnever thought of smoking. Playing basketball made me con-\ncentrate and not think of anything else. I forgot to smoke. My\ndesire for smoking disappeared.\nPeter discovered that I did not smoke while I was playing\nvideo games. Peter further described, although I smoked one\npack per day, I never smoked when I played games via my\ncomputer at home . . . I enjoyed spending time online, which\nmade me concentrate on that and forgot smoking. At school,\nI usually played games via my mobile phone. Sometimes, I\ndid not smoke all day if I played games when I felt bored. As\na result of such activities, the participants experienced posi-\ntive feelings even where the desire to smoke persisted. John\nalso said, I loved playing on the computer. When I concen-\ntrated on playing, I never thought of smoking. Nobody could\nmake me move from the chair. For these adolescent males,\nplaying computers, video games, Wii, and mobile phone\ngames had become another method for controlling smoking.\nSteve pointed that when I playing computer games, I forgot\nto smoke. Maybe it was because playing games had lots of\nfun and I did not feel bored. I really loved games.\nSky and Bill both indicated that when I concentrated on\nhearing music or reading novels, I would not smoke. I really\nliked to listen to music and read novels. In general, when I\nlistened to music and reading novels, maybe I concentrate on\nthe atmosphere, I forgot smoking.\nRegardless of the activity they chose, if the participants\nenjoyed their activity, they became so involved and dis-\ntracted with the activity that their desire to smoke disap-\npeared during this time.\nThinking of Family or Friends (n = 12)\nFor George, his smoking behavior had become part of daily\nlife. George said, When my family told me to smoke less, I\nsometimes listened to their words. Smoking was part of my\nlife. I knew smoking could cause cancer and sexual dysfunc-\ntion. However, I did not have feelings about that. I did not\nthink of quitting smoking. Yet I controlled smoking when I\nthought of my family. I did not want them disappointed.\nPan also indicated, When my family complained at me, I\nthought of quitting smoking. I did not want them disap-\npointed; also, I did not want to hear them criticizing me. So\nI rarely smoked in front of them. It was my way of controlling\nsmoking. During the drawing session, Pan portrayed himself\nas follows: He smoked, but at heart he wanted to quit and\ncontrol his smoking behavior. He took pen in hand and then\ndescribed his portrait: I really wanted to quit smoking; how-\never, it was difficult. What should I do? When I saw ciga-\nrettes, I wanted to try. Therefore, I controlled smoking when\nI thought of my parents.\nFor a number of the participants, long-standing friends\nwere the main motivation to control smoking. A 13-year-old\nboy, David, pointed out how he controlled smoking. David\nsaid, I never smoked in front of my girlfriend. My girlfriend\ndid not want me smoke. I did not want her disappointed. I\nthought that I would quit for her.\nJohn faced a similar situation to David: John's girlfriend\ndid not like smoking. He never smoked in front of her. As\nJohn described it, I loved my girlfriend and so I did not want\nto disappoint her . . . Although smoking made me happy and\nI felt cool, I would not like to let her down. Therefore, I hoped\nto find a way to quit and control smoking. Steve also indi-\ncated that my best friend smoked, so I started smoking. If my\nbest friend did not smoke, maybe I would not have the chance\nto take up smoking. Peer pressure has been influential for\nthese male adolescents, both negatively and positively.\nNegative influences were experienced from friends who also\nsmoked. The pressure the participants felt to continue smok-\ning was increased due to the pressure they felt from their\nothers peers who also smoked. Positive peer pressure, how-\never, also assisted in the desire to give up smoking, particu-\nlarly when trying to impress family or girlfriends who did\nnot like smoking.\nThinking About Wasting Money (n = 8)\nMany of the participants thought about the waste of money\nin smoking. Peter explained, I would like to quit smoking\nbecause it costs money and affects health. All the money I\nspent on cigarettes came from my daily living allowance.\nTherefore, sometimes, I went hungry without eating my\nbreakfast in order to save money to buy cigarettes. Steven\nfaced the same situation: I need to save my breakfast money\nto buy cigarettes. One pack of cigarettes was about $100 NT.\nAlthough I was hungry, I still bought cigarettes because of\nmy craving for tobacco. Smoking really wasted my money.\nHowever, as the cigarette became more and more expensive,\nI did not have money to buy it, and I will quit it. I could not\nstand to be hungry.\nThere was difficulty in balancing their budgets between\nfood and cigarettes. In the end, the cost of cigarettes also\nplayed a role in them wanting to control their smoking or\neven quit.\nThinking About Physical Weakness or Stunted\nA number of participants felt their health had become worse\nsince they had taken up smoking. Most thought that their\nheight had not increased from the point that they took up\nHong et al. 5\nsmoking. They thought about physical weakness or stunted\ngrowth after smoking and felt upset. George stated, After\nsmoking, I was breathless when I ran. I never had this expe-\nrience before I smoked. Furthermore, John, Steven, and Peter\nalso indicated, My height did not grow after smoking. Steven\neven mentioned that I was only 163 cm in height, short in my\nclass. I was worried that I would not find a girlfriend. It was\nso bad that I did not keep growing after smoking. Steven\nportrayed himself as follows: My height did not increase\nafter smoking. Also, I could not sleep at night, which meant\nmy spirits in the morning were low and I was tired. I tried to\ncontrol smoking because of these reasons.\nJohn also found a similar situation as Steven: I did not\nsleep well after smoking. I stayed awake until midnight. I did\nnot like that. I hoped that I could sleep well and my height\nwould continue growing up to 175 cm. During the drawing\nsession, Steven added a further description: He portrayed\nhimself having nose bleeds with colorful hair without draw-\ning his body. He said, my body became weak after smoking. I\nfound that I didn't grow further and had less sleeping time at\nnight. When I ran, I breathed heavily. I would control smok-\ning when I thought about breathing heavily.\nDuring the drawing session, Sam drew himself as a fat\nman. He offered a further description: I was fat after smok-\ning. Smoking made me eat more and more. I could not con-\ntrol my appetite, which made me gain weight. I gained 10 kg\nafter smoking. I would control smoking for losing weight. I\nwanted to make girlfriend. Gaining weight made me like a\nstupid man.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of this study revealed five themes reflecting the\nbehaviors of the participants in their experiences of living\nwith controlling tobacco use. The participants had also\nbecome motivated in their desire to control or quit their\nsmoking after only two sessions of the education program.\nThey recognized links between the information given in the\nsessions, for example, side effects of smoking and the things\nthey were personally experiencing such as not eating prop-\nerly, which in turn became a motivation for them to want to\nquit smoking. The provision of education assisted the partici-\npants to become more motivated to change their smoking\nbehaviors as indicated in the data analysis.\nThe themes identified were congruent with other interna-\ntional studies. The participants in this study indicated that\nsmoking could be controlled by sleeping or eating. Although\nno studies indicated youth smokers controlled their smoking\nby sleeping, Larson et al. (2007) found that adolescents eat-\ning breakfast, lunch, and dinner regularly had a significantly\nlow percentage of cigarette use. In addition, frequent con-\nsumption of fast-food meals was significantly and directly\nrelated to smoking frequency and overall young people ate\nmore junk food to stop smoking (Larson et al., 2007). Their\nresults were consistent with this study as most participants\ninterviewed identified that they liked to eat fast food to con-\ntrol smoking.\nMost participants (n = 10) also stated that smoking can be\ncontrolled by participating in leisure activities, rather than\nconcentrating on the need to smoke. In the Larson et al.\n(2007) study, physical activity was significantly associated\nwith smoking behaviors, demonstrating that participation in\nteam sports reduced the smoking rate in adolescents. As a\nresult, if adolescents were encouraged to find an activity they\nenjoyed, this could provide significant support during their\nefforts to reduce or quit smoking. However, in this study,\nsome participants controlled smoking via sleeping or eating\nresulting in weight gain. These adolescent boys found a neg-\native way to control smoking. The nurse educators could\nencourage them choose a suitable activity to help them con-\ntrol smoking and become healthy.\nFamily and friend awareness were factors influencing\nmale adolescents' smoking habits. Jamil, Khan, Atta,\nShahzada,& Younis(2012) revealed friends and brothers\nrather than parents or teachers as significant influences on\nadolescents' tobacco use. Nargiso et al. (2012) also found\nthat close friends were significantly associated with smoking\nbehaviors, while family environment had no significant\neffect. This was congruent with the results found in this study\nwhere participants indicated their desire to \"not disappoint\"\ntheir girlfriends.\nSome participants indicated that they controlled their\nsmoking behaviors by thinking about wasting money, which\nis similar to the results in a study by Lovato et al. (2010) who\nfound that students smoked less cigarettes in areas where the\ncost was higher than other areas. In addition, some partici-\npants believed that smoking made them become physically\nweak or stunted. There are not many studies to demonstrate\nthis; however, Gold et al. (1996) did conclude that the growth\nof lungs was in fact stunted in adolescents who smoked.\nFurthermore, smoking may not actually increase appetite as\none participant (David) had indicated, because middle ado-\nlescents (13-17 years) generally experience weight gain nat-\nurally associated with growth and development (Stang &\nConclusion\nAs previously described, self-awareness and friends exert a\ngreat influence on teenage boys. Whether such boys smoke\ndepend on their strength of their social bonds with their\nfriends; to develop effective health education programs for\nyoung Taiwanese smokers, finding suitable strategies is\nimportant. Strategies employed by participants to stop or\nprevent a return to tobacco use included thinking of \"family\nor friends,\" \"finding activities,\" \"thinking about wasting\nmoney,\" and \"thinking about physical weakening or stunt-\ning.\" For many of the participants, the above strategies are\nthe most effective ways to quit or to have motivation to stop\nsmoking. Vuckovic et al. (2003) suggested that teen smokers\n6 SAGE Open\nneed to be provided with valuable information such as useful\nquit tips to have motivation to stop smoking, but they have\nnot said what useful quit tips are. Therefore, those above\nstrategies in this present study might be used as quit tips for\nmale adolescent smokers. In addition, this study demon-\nstrated that the provision of knowledge to participants in a\nway they could personally relate to it can assist in the moti-\nvation to reduce or quit smoking. This research will help\nhealth-related workers understand how adolescent boys con-\ntribute to control of smoking, how they think about smoking,\nand how smoking cessation programs can be developed for\nadolescent boys.\nLimitations of the Study\nThe study is limited by the small number of participants (n =\n12) involved. The focus of the study was restricted to persons\nwho were involved in smoking control. Further studies could\nbe undertaken involving physical activity, healthy diet, eco-\nnomic factor, and family members concerning the impact on\ntheir respective lives.\n"
