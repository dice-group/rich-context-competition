Periodontitis, the progressive loss of the alveolar bone around\nthe teeth and the major cause of tooth loss in adults, is due to oral\nmicroorganisms, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (1). There is\ngrowing evidence that poor periodontal health is associated with sys-\ntemic health deficits (2,3), including cancer (4,5). Although these\ndisease associations are suspected to have a microbial basis, there is\ncurrently no epidemiologic evidence pointing to specific microbial\netiologic agents.\nIn a prospective study of a nationally representative US population\nsample, we examined whether periodontal disease, assessed by dental\nexam, is associated with orodigestive cancer mortality. To directly\naddress microbe\u00adcancer associations, we also prospectively investi-\ngated the relationship of serum antibody levels for P.gingivalis in\nrelation to orodigestive cancer mortality.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III)\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention (CDC), was designed to examine the health and nutritional\nstatus of the non-institutionalized USA population (6), including estimates for\nthree major racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks\nand Mexican Americans, by oversampling the latter two populations. Data\nwere collected by interview and physical examination in Phases I and II,\nconducted in Mobile Examinations Centers, including blood sampling in Phase\nII for measurement of serum P.gingivalis IgG and other serum constituents. All\nprocedures were approved by the NCHS Institutional Review Board, and all\nsubjects provided written informed consent.\nFor assessment of the relationship of periodontal disease to orodigestive\ncancer mortality, we restricted eligibility to those who were of age 17 years\nand older and who had completed the periodontal exam (n 5 12 934) in Phase I\nor Phase II of the survey. Those who had a prior cancer (n 5 320), had un-\nknown mortality status (n 5 7) or missing smoking status (n 5 2) were\nexcluded, resulting in a cohort of 12 605 subjects. For assessment of the\nrelationship of serum P.gingivalis IgG to orodigestive cancer mortality, we re-\nstricted eligibility to Phase II participants included above who were also assessed\nserologically for serum IgG antibody against P.gingivalis (n 5 9152). After\nrestricting for age below 17 years (n 5 1040), unknown mortality status\nin the analysis (exclusion may overlap).\nPeriodontal disease\nFor assessment of periodontal disease, periodontal attachment loss and pocket\ndepth were evaluated by dental examiners trained to follow a written set of\nobjective standards to minimize examiner variability by eliminating conditions\nknown to be sources of disagreement (6). If the examiner was equivocal\nregarding the appropriate score, the lesser score was assigned. All teeth pres-\nent, excluding roots, were scored. We defined periodontal disease based on the\nguidelines of the CDC and the American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/\nAAP) (7). Briefly, subjects were classified as having severe periodontitis if at\nleast two teeth had interproximal (between teeth) attachment loss !6 mm and\nat least one tooth had interproximal pocket depth !5 mm. Subjects were\nclassified as having moderate periodontitis if they did not meet criteria for\nsevere periodontitis but they had at least two teeth with interproximal attach-\nment loss !4 mm or at least two teeth with interproximal pocket depth !5 mm.\nSerum IgG antibody to Porphyromonas gingivalis\nSerum P.gingivalis IgG was chosen for study to capture evidence of systemic\nexposure to this bacterium because it is a validated NHANES III periodontal\npathogen (8), with well-described periodontal pathogenicity (9). Detailed\ninformation on the assay used to measure P.gingivalis IgG has been provided\nelsewhere (10). Briefly, levels of the serum P.gingivalis IgG were assayed with\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during the baseline survey or shortly\nthereafter. Antibody measurements were reported in enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay units of IgG (EU). Based on a previous report in NHANES III\nvalidating this assay for periodontal disease, we assigned three categories of\nP.gingivalis IgG (8,11), associated with none or mild (i.e. normal) (,69 EU),\nrespectively.\nEnd point ascertainment\nFollow-up of the cohort was from the date of the baseline physical and peri-\ntality was based on the NHANES III Linked Mortality File (ICD-10; with 113\nunderlying causes of death), ascertained through probabilistic linkage with the\nNational Death Index (NDI), with cancer deaths coded by the ICD-10 classi-\nfication. Orodigestive cancers were as follows: lip, oral cavity and pharynx\ncolon, rectum and anus (C18-C21). Survival follow-up continued until death or\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were analyzed using SUDAAN (release 9.0.1; Research Triangle\nInstitute) to account for the complex sample design of NHANES III, including\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; EU, enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay unit; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey; RR, relative risks.\n\u00d3 The Author 2012.

Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to compute mor-\ntality relative risks (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) in\nrelation to categories of periodontal disease and serum P.gingivalis IgG. RR\nwere calculated with time elapsed since survey date (in months) as the time-\ndependent parameter. RR were adjusted for age and sex and additionally for\nsmoking status (never, former, current and unknown), education, race/ethnicity\n(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American and other)\nor unlikely (BMI ,15 or .40)]. We tested the proportional hazards assump-\ntion by modeling interaction terms of time and continuous serum P.gingivalis\nIgG levels and found no statistically significant deviations. For visual inspec-\ntion, we also applied non-parametric regression using cubic splines (13) to\nexamine the association between serum P.gingivalis IgG and risk of orodiges-\ntive cancer mortality. For this analysis, the number and location of the knots\nwere identified through a stepwise selection process (14). Statistical signifi-\ncance was determined by a two-sided P , 0.05.\nResults\nAmong 12 605 NHANES III participants examined for periodontal\nodontal disease. Among 7852 subjects assessed for serum P.gingivalis\nIgG, levels were significantly greater in study participants with mod-\nperiodontitis, normal subjects tended to be younger, female, non-\nHispanic White, better-educated, never-smokers and of lower BMI\n(Table I). Participants with low serum P.gingivalis IgG levels\n(,69.1 EU) also tended to follow these patterns, except that gender\ndifferences were not noted and an excess of non-smokers among those\nwith high P.gingivalis titers were noted (Table I).\nOrodigestive cancer mortality was elevated in subjects with peri-\nodontal disease, with adjustment for age and sex (RR 5 2.42, 95% CI\nwas also evidence that risks for orodigestive cancer mortality\nincreased with the severity of periodontal disease (multivariate-\nadjusted P trend 5 0.01) (Table II).

Other sites of\norodigestive cancer had too few deaths for statistical analysis (lip,\n(Supplementary Table 1 is available at Carcinogenesis Online).\nParticipants with high levels of serum antibody to P.gingivalis\n(!69.1 EU) also tended to have excess orodigestive cancer mortality\njects with clinically apparent periodontal disease (RR 5 2.25, 95% CI\njects (Figure 1) showed increasing orodigestive cancer mortality with\nincreasing P.gingivalis IgG levels, although the dose-response was not\nlinear, tending to flatten at higher IgG levels.\nDiscussion\nOur investigation in NHANES III, a nationally representative popula-\ntion-based cohort study, showed increasing risk for orodigestive cancer\nmortality in relation to increasing severity of periodontal disease and in\nrelation to serum P.gingivalis IgG, a biomarker for exposure to this\nperiodontitis-related pathogen. The observed associations remained sta-\ntistically significant following control for age, sex, smoking, education,\nrace/ethnicity and BMI. Although numbers were small for cancer site-\nspecific analyses, clinically defined periodontitis tended to be associ-\nated with colorectal and pancreas cancer in our study.\nSeveral other studies have related cancer risks to periodontal disease\nand tooth loss, a generally accepted surrogate marker in adults for\nperiodontitis (1). In NHANES I, non-significant age- and gender-\nadjusted excesses of pancreas cancer were found in subjects with\nTable I.

In a hospital-based case\u00adcontrol study of 14 common cancer types\nin Japan (16), self-reported tooth loss was associated with head and neck\n(borderline significant) and esophagus cancer. In the Health Professional\nFollow-up Study cohort (17,18), self-reported periodontitis was associated\nwith increased risk for all cancer and for pancreas cancer, whereas tooth\nloss was associated with a borderline significant association with all\ncancer. Greater tooth loss was associated with excesses of esophageal\nsquamous cell carcinoma and gastric cardia and non-cardia adenocarci-\nnoma, in studies in China (19) and Finland (20), whereas excesses of\npancreas cancer were also reported from the Finnish study (21). Recent\nreviews indicate that there is growing evidence of oral health\u00adorodigestive\ncancer risk associations, with the strongest evidence for associations\nwith pancreas cancer (4,5). Farrell et al. (22) recently reported that oral\nmicrobiome profiles significantly differ in pancreatic cancer patients and\ncontrols.\nAlthough several studies are pointing to associations of poor oral\nhealth with increased risk for cancer and other diseases (2\u00ad5), our\nstudy is the first to relate a specific oral microbe, P.gingivalis, to\norodigestive cancer. Furthermore, our observation that P.gingivalis\nis associated with risk in subjects not exhibiting overt periodontal\ndisease is a strong indicator that microbial factors play a role in\norodigestive carcinogenesis independent of their association with\nperiodontal disease. In addition to their role in periodontal disease\nand tooth loss, oral bacteria colonize the gut and enter the blood after\nmastication, personal oral hygiene and dental procedures (23\u00ad27) and\nprovide source of ligands for toll-like receptors (28), membrane\nreceptors involved in innate immune regulation by recognition of\npathogen-associated molecular patterns from a wide spectrum of in-\nfectious agents. It is also possible that inflammation due to immuno-\nlogic response to oral bacteria and their toxins (3,29) may play an\nimportant role in oral and gastrointestinal carcinogenesis (30,31).\nAlternatively, oral bacteria may be associated with cancer risk by\nlocal metabolism of activating carcinogens from alcohol and smo-\nking--risk factors for several orodigestive cancers--and systemic\nrelease of the activated carcinogens, which has been most clearly\ndemonstrated for alcoholic beverage-associated ethanol metabolism\nby oral microbes (32). Finally, oral bacterial profiles could be a marker\nof an individual's unmeasured proinflammatory susceptibility related\nto inherent genetic and immune system deficiencies.\nOur study was limited in that it was based on mortality rather than\nincidence and results were derived from small numbers of site-specific\norodigestive cancer deaths, thus we had limited power for evaluation of\nmortality risks for specific cancers. Although P.gingivalis is a well-\ncharacterized oral bacteria, serum antibody assessments are indirect\nmeasures for orodigestive bacterial exposure, based on individually\nTable II.

Our study\npoints to P.gingivalis as a potential etiologic agent, yet we recognize\nthat this association may be serving as a proxy biomarker for other\npathogenic agents and that definitive conclusions will require direct\nmicrobiome-wide evaluations of oral microbes, as are recently coming\ninto epidemiologic use (33). Strengths of this study include the pro-\nspective design in a nationally representative population, including\nethnic minority groups, a detailed periodontal exam characterizing se-\nverity of periodontitis and the availability of pre-diagnostic serum\nP.gingivalis IgG levels as a periodontal pathogen biomarker. With these\nresources, we were able to evaluate dose-response relationships using\nclinic and biomarker-based risk factor measures.\nIn summary, we found that periodontal disease was associated with\norodigestive cancer mortality and identified P.gingivalis as a specific\nand potentially independent microbial marker for risk of orodigestive\ncancer death. These findings may reinforce public health recommen-\ndations for the maintenance of good oral health as a means of orodi-\ngestive cancer prevention and point to the need for microbiome-based\napproaches to identify the potentially broad spectrum of microbial\ndrivers of orodigestive cancer mortality.\nSupplementary material\nSupplementary Table 1 can be found at http://carcin.oxfordjournals.\norg/\nFunding\nInstitute and Career Development Award by American Association\nfor Cancer Research (AACR).\n"
