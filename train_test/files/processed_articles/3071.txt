Both overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25-29.9\nkg/m2) and obese (BMI, 30 kg/m2) persons were more likely to have elevated CRP\nlevels than their normal-weight counterparts (BMI, 25 kg/m2). After adjustment for\npotential confounders, including smoking and health status, the odds ratio (OR) for el-\n(95% CI, 4.94-7.81) for obese women. In addition, BMI was associated with clinically\nen. Waist-to-hip ratio was positively associated with both elevated and clinically raised\nCRP levels, independent of BMI. Restricting the analyses to young adults (aged 17-39\nyears) and excluding smokers, persons with inflammatory disease, cardiovascular dis-\nease, or diabetes mellitus and estrogen users did not change the main findings.\nConclusion Higher BMI is associated with higher CRP concentrations, even among\nyoung adults aged 17 to 39 years. These findings suggest a state of low-grade sys-\ntemic inflammation in overweight and obese persons.\nof all eligible adults consented to an ini-\ntial interview in their household. Of the\nsubsequently examined in a mobile ex-\namination center or in their homes. Per-\nsons with missing data on height, body\nand pregnant women (n = 307, vali-\ndated by urine pregnancy test) were ex-\nstatistical analyses.\nBody weight and height were\nmeasured using standardized proce-\ndures.15 Bodymassindex(BMI)wascal-\nculated as weight in kilograms divided\nby the square of height in meters and\nused as an indicator of body fat.16,17 The\nWaist circumference was measured\nat the level of the high point of the iliac\ncrest and the circumference at the level\nof maximum extension of the but-\ntocks.15 The waist-to-hip ratio, calcu-\nlated as waist circumference divided by\nhip circumference, was used as an in-\ndicator of abdominal visceral fat.19\nSerum specimens for the measure-\nment of CRP were stored at -70\u00b0C and\nanalyzed within 2 months after phle-\nbotomy. C-reactive protein was ana-\nlyzed using a modification of the Beh-\nring Latex-Enhanced CRP assay on the\nBehring Nephelometer Analyzer Sys-\ntem (Behring Diagnostics, Westwood,\nMass) (M.H.W., Phyllis R. Daum, MT\n[ASCP], G.M.M., unpublished data,\nqualitycontrolprocedureswereusedand\nthecoefficientofvariationofthemethod\nof data collection. The assay could de-\ntectaminimalCRPconcentrationof0.22\nmg/dL, and values below this level were\nclassified as undetectable. The assay was\ndesigned primarily to detect inflamma-\ntion and was included as part of the\nNHANES III cohort to help detect in-\nflammationasaconfoundingvariablefor\ninterpretation of nutrition markers. Be-\ncause most individuals had values less\nthan the minimum detectable concen-\ntration, CRP is treated as a categorical\nrather than a continuous variable.\nRacewasdefinedbyself-reportasnon-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or\nMexicanAmerican.Peopleoutsidethese\ncategorieswereclassifiedasother.Smok-\ning status was based on self-report and\ncategorized as never, former, or current\nsmoking. All persons with a serum co-\ntinine concentration of more than 57\nhigh-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy and atmospheric-pressure chemi-\ncal ionization tandem mass spectros-\ncopy21 were categorized as current\nsmokers, irrespective of self-report. In-\nflammatory disease prevalence was de-\ntermined through self-report of physi-\ncian-diagnosed conditions (chronic\nbronchitis, asthma, emphysema, and\nrheumatoid arthritis) and self-report of\n\"having a cold\" in the past few days. A\nserumtubedilutionlatexfixationtestfor\nrheumatoid factor was assessed in per-\nsons with a positive test result (1:40\ntiter) were categorized as having rheu-\nmatoid arthritis or a related inflam-\nmatory disorder, irrespective of self-\nreport. Cardiovascular disease included\nself-reported physician-diagnosed myo-\ncardial infarction and stroke and an-\ngina as assessed by the Rose Angina\nQuestionnaire.23 Diabetes mellitus was\ndefined as self-reported physician-\ndiagnosed diabetes mellitus with insu-\nlinuseor,inthecaseofundiagnoseddia-\nbetes mellitus, a fasting plasma glucose\nself-report, categorized as contracep-\ntive medications (oral or implant) or es-\ntrogen replacement therapy.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe study population was divided into\n2 categories based on CRP concentra-\ntion, undetectable (0.22 mg/dL) and\nelevated (0.22 mg/dL). The popula-\ntion was also divided into 2 categories\nbased on the conventional clinical cut\npoint for inflammation, a CRP concen-\ntration of more than 1.00 mg/dL. Two\noutcome variables were defined: el-\nevated CRP level (0.22 mg/dL), which\nwas compared with undetectable CRP,\nand clinically raised CRP level (1.00\nmg/dL), which was compared with CRP\nlevelofnomorethan1.00mg/dL.Within\neach sex, the relationship between BMI\nand CRPconcentrationcategory was ex-\namined by multiple logistic regression\nanalysis.Wecalculatedoddsratios(ORs)\nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for\nBMI as a categorical variable according\nto the clinical guidelines, with normal\nweight (BMI 25 kg/m2) as the refer-\nence category, and for BMI as a continu-\nous variable, expressed per 5-kg/m2\n(about 1 SD) increment. Moreover, ORs\nper SD increment of waist-to-hip ratio\n(0.1 units) were calculated. Adjust-\nmentsweremadeforpotentialconfound-\ners, including age, race, smoking\nstatus, estrogen use, inflammatory dis-\nease, and other diseases associated with\nlow-grade inflammation, including car-\nmellitus.28 To assess potential effect\nmodificationbyage,smokingstatus,dis-\nease status, or estrogen use, the analy-\nses were repeated, restricted to young\nestrogen-using nonsmokers. Odds ra-\ntios do not approximate risk ratios when\nthe prevalence of the outcome variable\nin the study population is greater than\nCRP concentration therefore should not\nbe interpreted as a risk ratio. Analyses\nwere performed using SAS (SAS Insti-\ntute Inc, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Tri-\nangle Park, NC) and incorporated\nsampling weights to account for over-\nsamplingandnonresponsetothehouse-\nhold interview and examination.30 Vari-\nance estimates were calculated with\nSUDAAN, incorporating the complex\nsampling design of NHANES III.30\nRESULTS\nElevatedCRPlevels(0.22mg/dL)were\nwomen, and clinically raised CRP lev-\nspectively.

Per 1-SD increase in waist-to-\nhip ratio, men were 1.41 and women\nwere 1.21 times more likely to have el-\nevated CRP levels (Table 2). The OR for\nclinically raised CRP levels per 1-SD in-\ncrease in waist-to-hip ratio was 1.36 in\nThe association between BMI and\nCRP was also investigated after stratifi-\nold = 60 years). Among women, the\nassociation between BMI and CRP cat-\negories was influenced by age group.\nOlder obese women were less likely to\nhave elevated or clinically raised CRP\nlevels than young obese women. A simi-\nlar effect modification by age group in\nwomenwasobservedusingBMIasacat-\negorical variable.

Of inter-\nest is our observation that the distri-\nbution of body fat is associated with\nCRP concentration independent of BMI.\nA high waist-to-hip ratio, indicative of\na large amount of abdominal visceral\nfat, was associated with low-grade sys-\ntemic inflammation in men and women.\nOurresults,togetherwiththeevidence\nofpreviousstudies,haveimportantim-\nplications for the health risks of over-\nweightandobeseindividuals,including\nthoseatyoungages.BasedonNHANES\nIII data, we estimated that 53.9% of US\nadults aged 17 years or older are over-\nweight or obese. Overweight, obesity,\nandalargewaist-to-hipratioposeacon-\nsiderable health risk, including cardio-\ninflammationhasbeenshowntoincrease\nthe risk for cardiovascular disease.9-13\nSomeoftheincreasedriskforcardiovas-\ncular disease in overweight and obese\npersonsmaybeexplainedbyourobser-\nvationthatincreasedCRPconcentrations\nare more prevalent in these persons.\nC-reactiveproteinconcentrationswell\nbelow the conventional clinical upper\nlimit of normal of 1 mg/dL have been as-\nsociated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in\nrisk of myocardial infarction, ischemic\nstroke, and peripheral arterial disease in\nhealthy men and women.9-13 In addi-\ntion, elevated CRP levels are predictive\nof cardiac complications inpatients with\nunstable angina or myocardial infarc-\ntion of tissue factor, a potent procoagu-\nlant, in monocytes.40 Moreover, elevated\nCRP concentrations are associated with\nincreased coronary heart disease mor-\ntality and total mortality.9,41\nApproximately25%ofcirculatingIL-6\nisestimatedtobereleasedbyhumansub-\ncutaneous adipose tissue in vivo,2 and\nIL-6 stimulates the production of acute-\nphase proteins in the liver.6,7 This might\nexplain the observed associations be-\ntweenBMIandCRP.Invitro,humanab-\ndominal visceral adipose tissue releases\nmore IL-6 compared with subcutane-\nous adipose tissue,5 possibly explaining\nour observation that a higher waist-to-\nhip ratio, after adjustment for BMI and\nseveral confounders, was indepen-\ndentlyassociatedwithelevatedCRPlevel.\nBody mass index is an important\nclinicalindicatorofoverweightand obe-\nsity,18 but its use as an indicator of body\nfatness has limitations.

The biologi-\ncal variability of CRP is substantial, with\nreported values ranging from 10.6% to\nmisclassification due to biological vari-\nability will lead to underestimation of\ntrue associations, this limitation is un-\nlikely to explain our findings.\nMeasurements of the serum concen-\ntration of IL-6 were not available in the\npresent study. Although the results sup-\nport the hypothesis that IL-6 pro-\nduced by the adipocytes increase CRP\nconcentration, direct assessment of IL-6\nconcentration is needed in future stud-\nies to further test this hypothesis.\nIn conclusion, the results of this\nlarge-scale cross-sectional study show\nthat higher BMI is associated with\nhigher CRP concentrations that could\nnot be explained by inflammatory dis-\nease or other factors or diseases known\nto increase CRP concentrations. Be-\ncause these associations also were ob-\nserved among young adults aged 17 to\n39 years, subclinical disease is un-\nlikely to explain our findings. These\ndata suggest that a state of low-grade\nsystemic inflammation is present in\noverweight and obese persons.\nREFERENCES\n1. Flier JS.
