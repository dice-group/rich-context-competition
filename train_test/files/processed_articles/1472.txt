We assessed these trends by\napplying the Framingham Heart Study prediction model to national data.\nMethods and Results--The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II (1976\u00ad1980), NHANES III\npopulation of the United States. We excluded people with a history of CV disease, pregnant women, participants with\nmissing CV risk factors data, and individuals outside the Framingham age range of 30 to 74 years. The Framingham risk\nfunction was used to estimate the 10-year risk for incident symptomatic CV disease. We calculated the slope of change\nor rate of change per year between NHANES II and III, and between NHANES III and 1999\u00ad2004. The difference\nbetween slopes was calculated and compared to zero. The average age-adjusted 10-year CV risk between NHANES II\nand III decreased from 10.0% to 7.9% between NHANES II and III, with a statistically significant slope (P0.001).\nHowever, the average age-adjusted CV risk decreased at a lesser magnitude between NHANES III and NHANES\nKey Words: obesity  epidemiology  prevention & control  risk factors\nCardiovascular (CV) disease represents the most common\ncause of death in the United States, accounting for\napproximately 1 million deaths annually.1 Multiple reports\nhave demonstrated significant changes in the prevalence of\nCV risk factors over the last 30 years, including downward\ntrends in cholesterol2 and cigarette smoking,3,4 and an early\ndecrease in the prevalence of hypertension for the last 10\nyears.5\u00ad9 There have also been increases in the prevalence of\nCV risk factors provide different strengths of risk for incident\nmyocardial infarction,15 it is unknown whether the net trend\nin risk for incident CV disease in the United States has\nincreased, decreased, or has remained stable over the last 3\ndecades.\nEpidemiological studies assessing the trend in CV disease\nincidence has demonstrated conflicting results in the inci-\ndence of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease as\na whole.16 The ascertainment of temporal trends in incident\nCV disease is difficult. Major challenges include change in\nthe diagnostic criteria for myocardial infarction, changes in\nphysicians practice, the discovery of new methods in diag-\nnosing preclinical coronary disease, and the discovery and\nwide implementation of highly sensitive techniques in detect-\ning myocardial injury. Despite the overwhelming evidence\ndemonstrating a decrease in age-adjusted CV mortality over\nthe last decades,17\u00ad19 it is unclear whether the bidirectional\ntrends in CV risk factors are reflected in a reduced risk for\nincident CV disease.\nValidated risk prediction formulas can estimate individual\ncoronary risk.20 The formulas or algorithms are based on\npredictive modeling, which has been extensively validated in\ndifferent populations in the United States20,21 and else-\nwhere.22,23 These prediction formulas provide reliable esti-\nmates of global population risk and help in identifying\nchanges in net CV risk.\nFrom the Divisions of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine (F.L.-J., V.L.R., H.H.T., V.K.S.), and the Department of Health Sciences\nResearch (V.L.R.), Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester Minn; the Section of General Internal Medicine (J.A.B.), Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical\nCenter, Lebanon, NH; and Brekke Associates (L.B.), Golden Valley, Minn.\nThis work was presented in part at the 2008 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, New Orleans, La, November 7\u00ad12, 2008.\nThe online-only Data Supplement is available at http://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/CIRCOUTCOMES.108.847202/DC1.\nCorrespondence to Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, MD, MSc, Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905.

The present analysis incorporated major\nized manner. Detailed study design and sampling have been de-\nBecause our focus was to estimate the 10-year risk for incident CV\ndisease, we excluded people with a self-reported history of myocar-\ndial infarction, angina, or stroke; pregnant women; people with\nmissing CV risk factor data; individuals 74 years as they were not\nincluded in NHANES II; and subjects 30 years as the Framingham\nscore was not designed to assess risk in this age group. Of\nparticipants with nonzero weights, we excluded 2310 participants of\n7866 participants used from each respective survey in the risk\nfunction. The subset of patients with fasting data included 3463\nunderwent formal institutional review board approval, which in-\ncluded a written informed consent. NHANES II did not have formal\ninstitutional review in the manner in which it is defined currently.\nThis analysis obtained an exemption from the Institutional Review\nBoard as the data were deidentified in nature.\nMeasurements\nLipid analyses were conducted on frozen serum samples shipped on\ndry ice to a central laboratory.31 Cholesterol measurements were\nstandardized according to the Centers for Disease Control\u00adNational\nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lipid Standardization Program\ncriteria.31 We used different definitions of dyslipidemia depending of\nthe parameter used and history of treatment. High cholesterol was\ndefined as a measured total cholesterol (TChol) 240 mg/dL.\nDyslipidemia was defined as participants having a total cholesterol\n(TChol) 240 mg/dL, or a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL) 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women. Finally,\n\"Dyslipidemia with TG\" included participants with a diagnosis of\ndyslipidemia with a triglyceride (TG) level of 150 mg/dL whose\nblood results were based on a morning subsample of blood. We also\nclassified participants according to the history of self-reported\ndyslipidemia and treatment for it. These definitions paralleled those\noutlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult\nTreatment Panel III guidelines.32\nPlasma glucose was measured using the hexokinase enzymatic\nmethod.13,33 Diabetes prevalence was defined as the sum of the\nnumber or participants with self-reported diabetes on the whole\nsample combined with those with glucose level 126 mg/dL on the\nfasting morning subsample using methods of Flegal et al,34 and\ntermed \"prevalent diabetes.\" This calculation includes variance\ncalculations using jackknife methods accounting for dependence\nbetween the two samples.34,35 This definition of diabetes was based\non the most recent American Diabetes Association consensus state-\nment36 and was slightly different from the definition used in the\nFramingham study,20 where the cutoff value for fasting glucose was\n150 mg/dL. However, the CV risk associated with a fasting glucose\nbetween 126 to 150 is very similar to the risk of glucose values just\nabove 150 mg/dL. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a fasting\nglucose of 126 mg/dL36 and absence of self-reported diabetes.\nDifferences in blood pressure measurement protocol across the 3\nsurveys included the number of measurements, the qualifications of\nthe staff performing them, and whether it was measured in seated or\nsupine positions. We limited our analysis to sitting measurements.\nThe first measurement was excluded unless it was the only one\navailable, and the remaining measurements were averaged to con-\n\"history of hypertension\" as a self-reported diagnoses of hyperten-\nsion and defined \"hypertension-measured\" if systolic blood pressure\nwas 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg,\nregardless of the presence of self-reported hypertension or current\nhypertension treatment. This was performed in line with the manner\nthe Framingham 10-year risk score incorporates blood pressure\nvalues. This model does not differentiate between diagnosed versus\nundiagnosed hypertension, or between those receiving treatment for\nhypertension versus those untreated. We also analyzed the preva-\nlence of treated hypertension.\nCurrent smoking was defined as current cigarette, pipe, or cigar\nsmoker. Current cigarette smoking was defined if subjects answered\nyes to both questions: \"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in\nyour entire life?\" and \"Do you smoke cigarettes now?\" Current cigar\nor pipe smoking was defined if participants smoked either type\n\"every day\" or \"some days.\" The NHANES definition of current\nsmoking was slightly different from the Framingham study,20 where\ncurrent smoking was defined as smoking regularly during the\nWeight and height were measured by standard protocols. Body\nmass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilo-\ngrams by the square of height in meters. Obesity was defined as BMI\nData and documentation for all surveys were downloaded in Sep-\n60 to 74 were defined for trend comparisons as recommended by\nhttp://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nCoronary Heart Disease Risk Function\nWe used the Framingham formula20 to estimate the 10-year risk for\nincident coronary disease, separately by sex, using age, TChol, HDL,\nblood pressure (5 categories each), diabetes (yes/no), and smoking\n(yes/no). The crude score was calculated based on the linear function\nconsisting of the sum of  coefficients and transformed into 10-year\npredicted CV disease risk. The risk score was used in statistical tests\nof change as it had a less skewed distribution than the 10-year risk\nitself. CV risk was additionally calculated as if all members were 50\nyears old.\nAnalysis\nWe calculated weighted means, standard errors, and 95% confidence\nlimits using SAS-callable SUDAAN 9.0.1 to properly account for the\ncomplex survey design. The NHANES examination sample weight\nwas used for most variables. The morning fasting sample weight was\nused for the subsample with values for fasting glucose, low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and TGs. Triglyceride values were\nconverted to their natural log during the analyses because of the\nconsiderable skewness of the variable.\nResults were age\u00adsex standardized by the direct method to the\nthe Year 2000 age-adjustment weights that are commonly used in\nmortality estimates, because these weights are based on the predicted\nUS population in year 2000 and not on actual values. The age groups\n74 years. This standardization also served to adjust for missing data\nby age and sex. For trend analyses we used F tests. Our primary\noutcome was the slope of change or rate of change per year between\nNHANES II and III (first time period), and between NHANES III\ntime frame between the midpoints to measure the elapsed time\nbetween surveys, using 13 years as the average time between the first\n2 surveys and 10.5 years between the last 2. The difference in slopes\nwas also calculated and compared to zero using a t test. A probability\nvalue 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The mean BMI increased in all\nage groups, as did the proportion with a BMI 30 kg/m2, but\nthe rate was higher in females than males. The rate of change\nwas similar in both time periods.\nHypertension\nThe prevalence of participants with an elevated blood pres-\nsure (those defined as hypertension- measured) significantly\ndecreased over time, but the decrease was more significant in\nthe first time period than in the second period for the overall\ncohort, in either sex and across all age groups. The proportion\nof participants on antihypertensive medications increased\nsignificantly over time. The mean values of systolic blood\npressure dropped in all age groups in the first time period but\nincreased slightly in period two. Detailed changes in blood\npressure values over time for the whole group and compari-\nsons of slopes are listed in the Table. Values separated by sex\nor age group are displayed in Appendix 1 and 2.\nHyperlipidemia\nThe mean TChol decreased during the first time period but\nthe mild decline in the second period did not reach statistical\nsignificance, whereas LDL steadily decreased during both\nperiods. Mean HDL showed a modest increase over time, but\nthe slope was statistically significant only during the second\ntime period, in line with the significant rise in the use of\nmedications for dyslipidemia.42 Triglycerides had a nonsig-\nnificant increase over both time periods and in all groups.\nChanges over time in the prevalence of dyslipidemia using\ndifferent definitions and the corresponding slopes are listed in\nthe Table. Values separated by sex or age group are displayed\nin Appendix 1 and 2.\nHyperglycemia and Diabetes\nThe rate of change for fasting glucose of all persons had a\npositive slope in the first time period (P0.001), but in the\nsecond time period the change was insignificant. These trends\nwere similar across sex and age groups. The rate of change\nfor the percent of participants with diabetes mellitus had\nresults parallel to those found for fasting glucose.\nSmoking\nThe proportion of current smokers, cigarette, cigar, and pipe\nsmokers all decreased over time in both sexes and age groups.\nThe rate of change was more pronounced in the first time\nperiod than in the second for the whole sample. Although the\ndropped in the first time period, there was a slight increase in\nthe rate of smokers in the second time period.\nCardiovascular Risk\nThe average age-adjusted 10-year CV risk between NHANES\nII and NHANES III decreased from 10.0% to 7.9% with a\nstatistically significant slope (P0.001; Figure 3). However,\nthe average age-adjusted CV risk showed a smaller decrease\nsignificantly higher in the first time period than in the second.\n(P0.001). Trends were nearly identical when data were\nanalyzed assuming that all participants were 50 years old.\nWhen categorized by sex, CV disease risk in women\ndecreased between NHANES II and NHANES III (P0.001)\nbut did not change between NHANES III and NHANES\nsimilar to the entire sample (Figure 4). People from 60 to 74\nyears of age were the only age group with a decrease in\npredicted CV disease risk of similar magnitude in both time\nperiods (Figure 5). For other age groups, the predicted risk\ndecreased primarily between NHANES II and III but mini-\npersisted in our sex-adjusted analysis and analysis of patients\nassumed to be 50 years of age (data not shown).\nLopez-Jimenez et al Trends in Cardiovascular Risk 445\nhttp://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nDiscussion\nOur results, based on data from national surveys representa-\ntive of the United States population, demonstrate that CV risk\nfactors have changed at different rates and directions in the\nlast 30 years. The net 10-year risk for incident CV disease in\nthe United States has significantly decreased from 1976\u00ad\nwomen, there was no change in the latter period. Our results\nsuggest that the stagnation of CV risk reduction can be\nexplained by the slower improvement in lipid parameters and\nsmoking rates, by the reversal of the trend in blood pressure\ncontrol, and probably by the effect of the increased preva-\nlence in obesity-related CV risk factors.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first\nto calculate the trend in the net CV risk for developing CV\ndisease over the last 3 decades. This period of time is when\nmost evidence-based strategies for primary prevention of CV\ndisease have emerged and been widely implemented.17\nThese data have enormous public health implications, and\nsuggest that the gain in primary prevention of CV disease that\nduring the last time period, despite the discovery and imple-\nmentation of effective treatment modalities in managing\ndyslipidemia and hypertension,8,32,43 national antismoking\ncampaigns,44 and efforts related to primordial prevention. Our\nresults also suggest that the lack of change of the net risk for\nincidental symptomatic CV disease may be attributable to the\nincreased prevalence of obesity,10,11 which translates into a\nhigher prevalence of diabetes mellitus13,14 perhaps also con-\ntributing to the reversal of the trend in blood pressure control\nTable.

The number of cigarette, cigar, and pipe smokers\nmay not add up to 100% because of patients who used multiple smoking modalities. The distribution of TGs were skewed, thus a natural log of triglycerides was\nused for significance testing.\nHistory of hypertension indicates self-reported diagnosis of hypertension; hypertension on medications, participants with a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension\nand on anti-hypertensive medications; history of dyslipidemia diagnosed, participants with a self-reported diagnosis of dyslipidemia; dyslipidemia on medication,\nparticipants with a TChol 240 or an HDL 40 in males or 50 in females on medications; high cholesterol measured, participants with a TChol 240; dyslipidemia,\nparticipants with either a TChol 240 or an HDL 40 in males or 50 in females; dyslipidemia with TG, participants with a TChol 240 or an HDL 40 in males\nor 50 in females and a TG 150, only in the sample of participants with a morning subsample; diabetes, based on participants with self-reported diabetes or a\nfasting glucose level 126 mg/dL; total diabetes morning sample, prevalence on subsample of participants with only fasting blood glucoses; undiagnosed diabetes,\nparticipants with a fasting glucose 126 mg/dL and the absence of self-reported diabetes; current smoker, participants currently smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes;\nand cigarette smoker, participants currently smoking and that have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.\nhttp://circoutcomes.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nand the slower improvement in lipid parameters. If the\nobesity epidemic is sustained45 and smoking rates, blood\npressure, and lipid values continue with similar trajectories,\nthe net population CV risk can be expected to increase.\nIt is difficult to determine whether our results will translate\ninto a larger number of cardiovascular events in the United\nStates in the coming years. However, the predicted reduction\nthe modest decrease in incident CV disease observed in\nsurveillance studies comparing CV disease rates between the\n80s and the late 90s.46 This parallelism between the predicted\nreduction in risk and the reduction in events 10 years later\nadds validity to our results.\nSeveral studies have assessed temporal changes in individ-\nual CV risk factors, and their results have been for the most\npart similar to ours, despite the fact that our analysis was\nlimited to those without history of coronary disease or stroke\nand excluded young adults or those older than 74\nthat the early declines in adult smoking rates might be\nhalted.3,4 This study also agrees with others demonstrating the\nincreased prevalence of cigar smoking in the last decade,45\nwhich may explain the minimal reduction of overall smoking\nduring the latter period, compared to the first time period.\nHajjar commented in 2003 that the prevalence of hyper-\ntension might be increasing despite a prior analysis from\nNHANES, suggesting hypertension prevalence was declin-\ning.8 Our results support the concept that hypertension has\nhad a bidirectional trend over the last 30 years, manifested by\na decline in systolic blood pressure values from NHANES II\nand NHANES III and a rise in these values between\nHypertension Diabetes % Obesity % High\nCholesterol\n% Smoker\nRisk Factor\n% of Persons\n*\n*\n*\nFigure 1.

Dietary changes, particularly a\nreduction in saturated fat intake with mild increases in\nmonounsaturated fat intake, may also explain the increase in\nmean HDL. Because exercise levels have remained un-\nchanged,48,49 the modest improvement in HDL could not be\nattributed to changes in physical activity.\nSeveral studies have highlighted the increased prevalence\nof diabetes mellitus since 1976, particularly diagnosed dia-\nbetes, with little change in the prevalence of undiagnosed\ndiabetes.13,50 Our analysis also shows a significant increase in\nthe average fasting blood plasma glucose levels over time,\nsuggesting that the increase in the prevalence of diabetes\nmellitus reported elsewhere is not positively confounded\nbecause of changes in diagnostic criteria.\nThe limitations of the current study relate primarily to the\nintrinsic limitations of the NHANES surveys and that of the\nFramingham prediction model. As in any survey, participa-\ntion bias may have yielded a sample that is not entirely\nrepresentative of the population. However, specific to\nNHANES is that the nationally represented population ex-\ncluded participants residing in nursing facilities, members of\nthe armed forces, institutionalized participants, or nationals\nliving abroad. Hence, generalizing the results to these popu-\nlations should be done with caution. The survey was designed\nspecifically to oversample certain subgroups of public health\ninterest to increase the reliability and precision of health\nestimates for these groups. In addition, excluded patients may\nhave differed from those included in this study. Some\nmeasurements may have differed by survey stage, and our\nefforts to standardize values might not be able to create\nidentical variables. We acknowledge that many NHANES\nvariables, including those assessing CV disease, are self-\nreported and may lead to reporting bias. The definitions of\ndiabetes and current smoking in the Framingham study were\nslightly different than the definitions used in the current\nanalysis. Finally, although the Framingham risk score was\ndeveloped for people with no history of CV disease, a small\nfraction of the total sample might have failed to report history\nof CV disease and were included in the current analysis.\nAlthough several of these limitations may hamper the validity\nof risk estimates in each NHANES survey, these potential\nsources of bias and error were present in the three surveys.\nTherefore, the comparison of trends in risk may be less\naffected than the individual risk estimates.\nOur analysis has several strengths. Contrary to other\nreports addressing the change in several CV risk factors, we\nused widely validated risk scores to predict the risk of\nincident symptomatic CV disease. By measuring the net\nchange in CV risk, we can better estimate the global impact\nof preventive strategies, particularly when certain risk factors\nimprove, others do not change, and others worsen during the\nsame time period. NHANES data were obtained using a\nprospective methodology with standardized measurements\nand definitions, and are known to be representative of the US\npopulation. Risk functions derived from NHANES data have\naccurately projected the extent of CV events and overall\nmortality even in other population groups.51,52 Furthermore,\nonly 1 other study has evaluated the change in CV risk among\nUnited States adults but only used 2 NHANES surveys, and\nrelied on the risk model adopted by the National Cholesterol\nEducation Program Adult Treatment Panel III and not the\nprecise Framingham formula in estimating overall CV dis-\nease risk, and their results were not age-stratified.53\nThe Framingham risk score does not account for risk\nfactors such as family history of premature coronary disease,\nexercise, diet, obesity, or body fat distribution. Nevertheless,\nat the time the scoring system was developed, exercise,\nobesity, and diet were believed to impact and mediate CV risk\nthrough factors already included in the model. Hence, our\nfindings may actually be conservative risk estimates, as the\nincreasing prevalence of obesity may have led to higher CV\nrisk, not only mediated through commonly recognized car-\ndiac risk factors, but also via obstructive sleep apnea, high\nleptin and low adiponectin levels, and changes in other\ninflammatory cytokines and adipokines linked with central\nobesity.54 Additionally, the Framingham risk score was cre-\nated to help clinicians identify patients at high risk for CV\ndisease, and therefore simplicity has been a priority even if\nFigure 5.

The validity of Fra-\nmingham and other scores predicting CV disease has been\ntested in diverse populations and shown different event rates\nfor any given estimated risk value. Although this weakness\nhas been addressed and can be partially corrected by doing\nappropriate calibration,21 the validity of the overall estimated\nrisk may be limited. Moreover, CV risk prediction rules can\nhelp to predict changes in event rates after changes in\ndifferent CV risk factors occur. For example, in an analysis\nshowing the change in predicted CV risk in a sample of\npatients who underwent bariatric surgery,51,55 the predicted\nreduction of cardiovascular events was very close to the risk\nreduction subsequently reported in a prospective cohort of\npeople who underwent bariatric surgery.52 It has also been\nshown that the use of risk factor categories provides similar\nprognostic information as using noncategorical prediction\nfunctions. The score uses blood pressure and lipid values\nregardless of history of diagnosis or medical treatment for\nhypertension or dyslipidemia, respectively. Blood pressure\nand cholesterol values regardless of use of medications better\ncapture the impact of public health and clinical factors that\nmay change over time, and are also less susceptible to recall\nbias than definitions based on treatment status. The prognos-\ntic performance of Framingham could affect the absolute risk\nestimates but not the trend over time because the same\nlimitations will apply to the 3 time periods. Therefore, our\nmain findings and conclusions are not hampered by the\nlimitations inherent to the Framingham risk score.\nIn conclusion, our study has shown that the estimated net\nrisk for CV disease in the United States population decreased\ncular risk reduction has been maintained in patients aged 60\nor greater, but the difference in risk reduction observed from\nNHANES II and III has been minimal in younger people,\nespecially among those age 30 to 39. The increase in the\nprevalence of diabetes and in blood pressure levels may\nexplain the staggering of the risk reduction from NHANES\nto diabetes mellitus14 and can aggravate systemic blood\npressure and dyslipidemia, the attenuation in risk reduction\ncan be at least partially attributed to the growing epidemic.\nHowever, other factors like the attenuation in the reduction of\nprevalent smoking and cholesterol control observed in the\nsecond time period compared to the first one might also\nexplain the results. These results reinforce the need for\naggressive community-wide and office-based promotion of\nprimordial prevention, with emphasis on physical activity,\nexercise, dietary changes aiming for a higher intake of fruits\nand vegetables, lower intake of salt and saturated fat, main-\ntenance of a healthy weight and smoking control. These\nresults also underscore the key role of health care providers\nmanaging CV risk factors. These findings also confirm that\nthe discovery and use of effective medications for lipids and\nblood pressure do not translate into global risk reduction,\nunless they are paired with strategies preventing the occur-\nrence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia and reduc-\ning the rates of new smokers.\nSources of Funding\nDr Lopez-Jimenez was a recipient of a Clinical Scientist Develop-\nment Award from the American Heart Association.
