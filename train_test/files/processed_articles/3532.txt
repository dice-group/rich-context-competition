The patients were stratified into four 5-year periods\naccording to their admission period and were followed up for a total of four years after the index event with regard to\nrecurrent ischemic stroke. A Cox regression model was used to analyze the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke.\nConclusions: The risk of recurrence among younger ischemic stroke patients has decreased over the past 20 years.\nDespite these improvements, younger patients are still at a high risk for recurrent ischemic stroke.\n",

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have\ninvestigated trends and changes in risk over a long\nperiod of time in younger patients with ischemic stroke\n(IS). Information on prognosis and outcome is import-\nant for understanding the etiology of stroke and also in\nunderstanding how to improve outcome after a stroke.\nAims\nThis study aimed to examine temporal trends and the\ncumulative risk of recurrent IS over time in younger\nadults aged 18\u00ad54 years who were hospitalized with a\nMethods\nSwedish hospitals are required to report principal and\ncontributory diagnoses of all patients to the national\nInpatient Register (IPR), which started in 1964, and\nhas been operating on a nationwide basis since 1987.\nIn the current study, data from the IPR and Cause of\nDeath Register were linked using the unique Swedish\npersonal identifier number (a unique 10-digit number).\nAll diagnoses are coded according to the International\nClassification of Disease (ICD) system, with ICD-8\ndictive value (PPV) for discharge diagnosis differs for\nStudy population\ndays after a first hospitalization with a principal dis-\n433 was considered but not included in the final ana-\nlysis due to uncertainty of the diagnosis in the IPR (625\nmen and 344 women). Because the IPR data were not\ncomplete until 1987, all IS cases were consistently\nregarded as a first-time event after a time frame of\nseven years using data from 1980 and onward. This\nwas performed for each separate year from 1987 to\n2006 to ensure that all data were treated as uniformly\nas possible. A total of 17,149 cases were identified as a\nfirst-time IS and were stratified into four time periods\nyears, 3\u00ad4 years, and 0\u00ad4 years for recurrent IS.\nRecurrent IS was defined as either a fatal (death in\nhospital) or nonfatal event that occurred 28 days after\nindex hospitalization and with at least two days\nbetween discharge from hospital and the next admis-\nsion (Figure 1). Because a death outside hospital\nascribed to IS could not be considered as a recurrent\nevent with certainty, we excluded 20 cases where this\norrhagic stroke events were not included (179 men and\n79 women). The main author (KWG) and a stroke\nphysician (CHS) separately reviewed a subsample (100\ncases) of all cases to ascertain that the selection process\nwas appropriate, particularly with respect to readmis-\nsion to a rehabilitation unit for the index stroke, which\ncould be ruled out in all cases.\nThe IPR and outpatient register was used to identify\nall comorbidities. For surgery codes only IPR was used.\nComorbidities over a period extending seven years\nbefore and including the index hospitalization for the\nfirst IS event were included. The following main or con-\ntributory discharge codes were used (ICD-10 (ICD-8;\ntion I21 (410).

In the present study, we found that\nthe four-year risk of recurrent IS declined in both men\nand women during the study period. Similar trends\nwere observed in most age groups over time except\nfor the youngest group (18\u00ad25 years). However, the\nresults should be interpreted with caution since the\nnumbers of recurrent events were limited. Consistent\nwith previous reports, we found that the risk of recur-\nrence of IS was highest during the first several months\nand up to a year after the index event, regardless of\ntime periods.10,14 After the first year, the rate of recur-\nrence declined and was less than 2% annually during\nthat most of the decrease in risk occurred within the\nfirst six months to one year. No improvements were\nobserved at the time intervals of 2\u00ad3 years and 3\u00ad4\nFigure 2. Cumulative risk of recurrent IS in men and women divided by period. (a) Men 18\u00ad54, (b) women 18\u00ad54.\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(1)\nyears in men. However, women showed a more compli-\ncated pattern, with a significant decline in risk after six\nmonths at a time interval of 1\u00ad2 years during the last\nmonths and 2\u00ad3 years. Again, these results should be\ninterpreted with caution because the number of recur-\nrent IS cases was limited.\nThere are several possible explanations for the\ndecline in recurrent IS. Improved treatment of cardio-\nvascular risk factors, such as blood pressure levels and\nsmoking rates over time, likely contributed to better\nsurvival and less severe stroke cases.17,18 The use of\nantihypertensive, antiplatelet, anticoagulation, and\nlipid-lowering drugs in secondary prevention is import-\nant for reducing the risk of recurrent IS.19 Prescription\nof these medications has increased over time.20\nHowever, Glader et al. showed that persistent use of\nsecondary prevention medications (e.g. statins and war-\nfarin) decreased within the first two years after IS.21\nA discontinuation of secondary preventive medication\nafter discharge from hospital has previously been\nshown to be a risk predictor for recurrent events\namong younger IS patients.11 Therefore, a poor adher-\nence to medication over time might explain why no\nsignificant improvements were observed for men and\nwomen at the time interval of 3\u00ad4 years. In addition,\nFigure 3. Stroke-free survival in men and women divided by period. (a) Men 18\u00ad54, (b) women 18\u00ad54.\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 11(1)\nprevious studies have shown that patients who are trea-\nted at stroke units have a better outcome than those\nwho are treated at a general ward,22 especially for those\n<65 years of age.23 The positive effect on outcome may\nbe the result of a multidisciplinary team effort with\nfocus on early treatment, better adherence to medica-\ntions, and rehabilitation in stroke patients.21,24 In\nSweden, the number of stroke units has increased for\nthe past two decades and a majority of all patients are\nnow being treated at a stroke unit.25 It is our belief that\nimproved secondary preventions and better accessibil-\nity to stroke units over time have most likely contrib-\nuted to a better prognosis after an IS.\nIn comparison to the MONICA and the Scottish\nstudy with older patients, we found a slightly larger\ndecline in the risk of recurrent IS over time.15,16 Our\nresult does not necessarily indicate that secondary pre-\nvention treatments have been more effective on younger\nIS patients. Instead, possible explanations for the dif-\nferences in the risk decline may be that older patients\nhave more complications, comorbidity, higher case\nfatality rate, and a poorer recovery rate than younger\nindividuals. In addition, younger, as opposed to older,\npatients may receive a more thorough investigation and\ncareful follow-up.\nOverall, an increase in comorbidities was observed\nthroughout the study period. This finding could be\nexplained by better clinical reporting, partly because\nof changes in financial incitements over the years.12\nDyslipidemia has previously been reported to be a\nprevalent risk factor among younger IS patients and a\npotential predictor for recurrent events.14,26 The valid-\nity of lipid disorders in the Swedish IPR is low and\nmost likely underreported.12 Therefore, it was not\nincluded in the present study. The marked increase in\nhypertension during the study period may partly be\nowing to changes in definition (currently > 140/\n90 mmHg) by the World Health Organization.27\nThere are some limitations and strengths to our\nstudy. A strength of our study is use of the IPR. This\nregistry has near-complete coverage of all hospitalized\nstroke cases in Sweden which is required to identify the\nlarge population needed for IS cases because it is an\nuncommon diagnosis in younger adults. A limitation of\nour study is the potential variation in diagnosis of\nstroke that has been set by physicians over time.\nHowever, imaging diagnostics were routinely used\nthroughout the study period, and these largely exclude\nhemorrhagic stroke and cerebral malignancies. Clinical\ndata on severity of stroke, neurological impairment,\nfunctional recovery, medications, and other hospital\ntreatments were not available, which limits the inter-\npretation of the data. Another potential limitation is\nthat there is no specific coding for recurrent IS in the\nIPR. However, to account for this, we used a strict\nprotocol and selected only those cases that occurred\nafter 28 days, specifying a time window of at least\ntwo days after discharge to avoid false-positive cases.\nConclusions\nThe risk of recurrence in younger patients with IS has\ndecreased over time, particularly during the first year\nafter an IS. However, younger patients have a substan-\ntial risk of recurrent IS, and a high proportion still\neither die or have a new stroke over a four-year\nperiod. Because younger stroke patients have more to\nlose than older patients in terms of quality of life and\ndisability-free remaining lifetime, development of new\nstrategies and improvements of secondary preventions\nincluding medications and lifestyle changes should be\nprioritized. To further improve outcome, improving\nunderstanding of the needs of younger stroke patients\nand recognizing that they might be different from older\npatients are important.\nAuthors' contribution\nKWG: Wrote the article and has been involved in the analysis\nand interpretation of the results.\nLB: Involved in the interpretation of the results and made\ncritical revision of the manuscript.
