Yet since the\n2008 economic crisis, the conversation has shifted to decreasing the size of the U.S. prison population\nvia legislation. Ironically, both political parties had a hand in creating this state of mass incarceration.\nBoth parties pushed policies to get \"tough on crime\" and wage the \"War on Drugs\"; beginning with\nLyndon Johnson, each president has made crime a campaign issue, one they promised to tackle.\nA major shift is at last occurring, and there is widespread agreement that there is a need for change.\nWhile Democrats and Republicans agree that something must change, their stances differ, and the most\neffective way(s) to address the problems associated with mass incarceration remain unclear. As stated\nin the New York Times:\nThe debate over how to reverse this [problem] breaks down among those who favor\nbroad changes to sentences, including the reduction of mandatory minimum sentences,\nthose who want to address early release and services behind bars, and those who favor\nWhile one party argues to eliminate incarceration for some crimes and replace it with fines, warnings,\ndrug treatment, etc., the other argues for more effective rehabilitation programs inside the prison walls,\nsuch as opportunities for inmates to advance their education. In this paper, I argue: (1) a methodological\nexamination of punishment informed by population dynamics is necessary to understand how and\nwhy the U.S. leads the world in the size of its prison population, which will help illuminate the\ncomplexity of the punishment problem; (2) formal demography provides unique tools to evaluate the\ncosts and effectiveness of policies proposed or in current use to slow, stop, and lower the size of the\nprison population.\n1.1. The Case for Demography\nSince the 2008 economic crisis, there has been a growing bipartisan trend to look for ways to\ndecrease the size of the U.S. prison population without sacrificing the quality of criminal justice.\nThe current overpopulation of the nation's prisons and jails is forcing states to seek ways to slow,\nstop, or reduce the number of people behind bars. Generally, there are four fronts for categorizing\ncurrent efforts to reduce the U.S. prison population (Porter 2015). First, many states have focused\non sentencing reforms, often through the reclassification of offenses from a felony to a misdemeanor\nfor some nonviolent crimes. Second, some states reroute those found guilty of low-level offenses\nfrom prison to rehabilitation programs, probation, community service, or some other alternative to\nincarceration. A third option has been to decriminalize certain offenses, rendering the associated\npunishments to fines. Finally, some efforts have gone towards addressing the consequences of\nhaving a criminal record in the hopes of reducing rates of recidivism such as \"ban the box\" efforts\nin some cities, which make it illegal for employers to ask about criminal records on job applications.\nEach of these four approaches are more or less time-bound with different consequences for the\nsize, composition, and overall cost of imprisonment. We can think of them in terms of their focus:\nsentencing, alternatives to incarceration, decriminalization, and reducing reentry. However, if the\ngoal is to reduce the U.S. prison population in the long-run, it means moving beyond study of the\nmaking population informed policies and legislation that integrate the complex population dynamics\nthat characterize prison populations.\nDemography, which is the study of how and why populations change, provides tools and\ntechniques to assist in formulating viable plans. For example, a similar question has circulated for\ncenturies regarding the world's exploding population. Population changes are brought about by\nbirths, deaths, and migration. While changes in a population's mortality tend to take time, women\ncan control their fertility and decide what number of children they bear. China is one example where\nknowledge of how populations grow helped to stabilize the size of the population. In the mid-twentieth\ncentury, rapid population growth occurred in China because the death rate declined while fertility\nrates remained the same, which resulted in a 60 percent population increase in just 20 years\n(Hesketh et al. 2005). In 1979, China's State Family Planning Bureau used demographic techniques\nincluding population projections and momentum to retard the population growth. Other nations\nhave turned to demography to address other population issues. For instance, many West European\ncountries have encouraged immigration from their former colonies to offset negative population\nAs of 2015, the U.S. had the world's highest number of people incarcerated (International Centre\nfor Prison Studies 2017). Just as demography has shed light on country-level population dynamics,\nit also can offer insights into how various policies affect prison populations. In this paper, I explore\nthe routes states could follow to reduce the United States' massive prison population and rates of\nincarceration. Employing demography to advance understanding of the growth and decline of the\ncountry's prison population adds a meaningful dimension to the assessment and implementation of\npolicies. Using admission and release data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, I apply two classic\ndemographic questions to the prison population: Given a set of policies, how long will it take to reach\nzero population growth? What strategies will provide the shortest route to zero or negative growth?\n1.2. Strategies to Zero Prison Population Growth\nThe demography literature establishes that even if a population holds its mortality schedule\nconstant (age-specific death rates), altering the fertility schedule (age-specific fertility rates) will\nhave a significant impact on the future size of the population (Demeny 1988; Pritchett 1994).\nAnalogously, adjusting prison entrance rates should have an effect on the size of the prison\npopulation, yet few studies have incorporated knowledge about both entrance and exit dynamics.\n(Austin and Krisberg 1985) utilized national data to show that despite the projected national trend\nof the prison population leveling out, the population would continue to rise, due to momentum.\nTheir paper established three options to curb the predicted growth in the prison population: change\nthe entrance schedule (number of admissions each year), change the release schedule, or expand prison\ncapacity. Their analyses suggested that policy reforms at that time were encouraging growth in the\nprison population, thereby making the third option, prison expansion, inevitable. Using Minnesota\nas an example, Knapp and Anderson (1981) proposed a similar use of simulations to determine the\nimpact of policies, which resulted in similar conclusions.\nThese previous works have certainly been instrumental in developing a dialogue around how\nto address the growth of the U.S. prison population. Scholars and policymakers have continued\nthe conversation, which has surfaced a series of questions: How should we model the prison\npopulation? What is the relationship between incarceration and sentencing policies? How do we create\neffective policies that do not compromise public safety? What is the route to zero (or negative) prison\npopulation growth?\nRecent work has focused on the causes of massive growth in the U.S. prison population and\nproposed ways to deal with the issue. However, some make recommendations based on policies of\nthe past, which may fall short due to changes in the overall context of the U.S. (Austin 2010) reminds\nus that we were once a nation with a rather stable rate of crime and incarceration. In fact, the current\ncrime rate is approximately the same as it was in 1969, when the prison population experienced its\nlast decline (Travis et al. 2014). Austin proposes returning to the sentencing regime that was in place\nat that turning point. Taking a historical view, other things going on at that time--for example, the\ncivil rights movement and its opposition to Jim Crow laws--might lead one to think that today's\nincarceration rates should be even lower. Returning to the earlier sentencing regime is a reasonable\ngoal, but, navigating the path to reach that goal might be difficult. Tonry (2014) provided a ten-step\nblueprint for moving beyond our current state of mass incarceration. Each step involves amending or\nending policies related to sentencing practices that some argue have led us to the current situation.\nThis could be part of the solution, but other studies show that we cannot move past mass incarceration\nif our main punitive instrument is incarceration.\nand, along with current policy initiatives, stresses the need for change in both admissions and\nsentencing policies. Similarly, this paper considers changes that impact admissions and/or exits\nvia sentencing, but also provides a nuanced understanding of how long it takes to see changes\nin the prison population after implementation and the monetary costs associated with the change.\nMost importantly, in this paper I demonstrate the power cohort-component population projections\nbring to thinking through and understanding the impact of policy changes. A strength of this method\nis that it integrates knowledge of past and current policies and the resulting population structure of\nsuch policies. This enables one to not only ascertain if new policies will meet the goals of slowing or\ndecreasing the prison population, but it also distinguishes how long the momentum of past policies\nwill influence the growth. Finally, most current initiatives focus on the non-violent inmate population;\nhowever inmates sentenced for violent crimes must be considered even if the policies focus only on\nsome non-violent offenses. Therefore, I demonstrate how demographic tools integrate this critical\ninformation to create population informed approaches to the path of zero, or even negative, growth in\nthe prison population.\n1.3. Examples of Recent Policy Reforms\nBefore describing the modeling procedures I used in this paper, it makes sense to provide more\ndetail about some of the recent reforms states have proposed and/or implemented to address the size\nand growth of their prison populations. I specifically turn to a report published by The Sentencing\nProject, \"The State of Sentencing 2014: Developments in Policy and Practice,\" which provides timely\nexamples (Porter 2015). Most reforms affecting adults can be grouped into four categories:\n(1) Reducing the length of sentence and/or reclassification (from felony to misdemeanor) for some\nnonviolent crimes. Many states have made changes to sentencing practices. Six offenses were\nreclassified in California, including shoplifting, from a felony to a misdemeanor. Other states,\nincluding New Hampshire and Tennessee, now offer additional opportunities for inmates to\nreduce the time served for certain offenses.\n(2) Rerouting people who commit low-level offenses and/or violate their probation or parole from\nprison to rehabilitation, probation, community service, or other alternatives to incarceration.\nIn Missouri, for example, people who commit misdemeanors classified at the lowest level are no\nlonger subject to incarceration.\n(3) Decriminalizing certain offenses. For example, Alaska and Oregon have decriminalized the\npossession of some quantity of marijuana for recreational purposes. In Maryland and the District\nof Columbia, the penalty for possessing a limited amount of marijuana has been reduced to a fine.\n(4) Addressing the consequences of having a criminal record, such as ineligibility for some types\nof financial aid and/or government assistance, difficulty finding legitimate employment,\nand difficulty finding appropriate housing. Several states--Delaware, Illinois, Nebraska, and New\nJersey--and the District of Columbia have implemented \"ban the box\" policies to help end\nemployment discrimination against people with a criminal record. In 2014, California and\nMissouri made great strides toward successful reintegration by removing restrictions on\nformer inmates with a drug felony record, thus enabling them to receive financial aid and\npublic assistance.\nEach of these four broad approaches has different short- and long-term implications for the size,\ncomposition, and cost of the nation's prison population. Based on the population and the policy\nliterature reviewed above, the strategies with the most promise are those that include policies that\nreduce the number of new admissions and/or recidivism. Each strategy above tackles at least one of\nthe fronts except the first strategy, which focuses on reducing the sentence length. In the next section,\nI describe the demographic tools necessary to assess the potential benefits and deficiencies of each of\nthe strategies.\n2. Data and Methodology\nThe prison population, like any population, can grow, decline, or remain the same size.\nA population that is growing or declining at a constant rate, r, is known as a stable population.\nWhen r = 0, it is a special case of the stable population, known as the stationary population. A stationary\npopulation meets three conditions: (1) it has a growth rate of zero; (2) it has the same number of yearly\nadmissions and releases; (3) the rate of net migration is zero. Such characteristics occur when the\nsame admissions rates and release rates have been in place for a sufficient amount of time. Because\nit takes time for the momentum of past policies to no longer influence the characteristics of the total\npopulation, implementation of policies that keep the yearly admissions the same and adhere to the\nsame release schedule do not typically yield a stationary population immediately. For example, we can\nput into practice a set of policies such that all new admissions adhere to conditions that characterize\na stationary population. However, the size of the current prison population is the result of years of\nadmissions under a variety of policies. Thus, the total prison population is a combination of the current\nand past regimes. Until the inmates from the former regime exit, they will influence the underlying\nstructure and release schedule of the prison population.\nIn this paper, I utilized national-level data from 2004 to demonstrate the capacity for states and\nagencies to make informed sentencing decisions. Although a notable amount of time has passed since\n2004, the timing of the data used in this paper is not relevant to its purpose--i.e., to show the short-\nand long-term consequences of policy reforms--or to the results. Correctional data from any time in\nthe era of mass incarceration can be used to demonstrate the challenges and possibilities of different\npolicies. Estimates from this data reflect a time when the incarceration population had not yet peaked;\nin comparison to current trends, the resulting simulations should roughly mirror changes for persons\nincarcerated for non-violent offenses and are conservative of the changes for persons incarcerated\nfor violent offenses. Further, this year is prior to the economic crisis that prompted discussions and\nlegislation with the goal of lowering the prison population.\nSeveral steps were needed to move from the raw data to determine the short- and long-term\nconsequences of policy changes. The first step was to calculate the 2004 duration-specific release rates,\nwhere the numerator was the number of releases and the denominator an estimate of person-years\nlived (or rather prison-years lived), for a duration category. The numerator for each duration-specific\nrelease rate came from National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) release files, which provide\ncomprehensive records of releases from state correctional facilities for 2004 that include information\nsuch as age, sex, education, race, state, ethnicity, length of stay, and the offense that led to incarceration.\nThese data are not comprehensive at the national level, as they are limited to the states that choose to\nreport in any given year. For this analysis, I used data from 33 states that reported release information\nThe denominator of the duration-specific release rates required an estimate of prison years lived\nfor each duration category; here, the mid-year population in 2004 was used as the estimate of prison\nyears lived. I initially chose this year because it is the year of the last Survey of Inmates in State\nCorrectional Facilities, which was the only way to estimate the denominator for the duration-specific\nrelease rates until recently. However, beginning with the 2005 data, the NCRP added a file that\nprovides year-end counts of the correctional populations by state. Combining the year-end counts\nwith the admissions and release files allowed an estimate to be made of the mid-year population for\n2004 by duration, thereby allowing the computation of the duration-specific release rates. Although\nthe data available eliminated the use of Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities, performing\nthis analysis using the year 2004 still provides the same insights because it represents the era of mass\nincarceration, and the majority of states had not experienced a decline in their prison population.\n2.2. The Cohort Component Method and Simulating the Impact of Policies\nI used the cohort-component method to determine the implications of policies on the future\nprison population (for more details, see (Preston et al. 2001)). This approach uses a discrete-time\nmodel and incorporates the current duration distribution and release schedule of the prison population\nin its projections (i.e., the influence of the past sentencing regimes). The projections are calculated\nat the duration level to incorporate the difference in the rates of release from prison by duration.\nThis piece is important because the release rates are not uniform. Rather, the release rates are high\ninitially. The release rates decline as the duration of stay increases because longer stays indicate the\ncommission of more serious crimes, which are typically accompanied by harsher sentencing. For the\nprison population, an interval length of six months was sufficient to incorporate differences in release\nrates from prison by duration of stay. In sum, use of the cohort component projection allows integration\n1 The 33 states used are Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,\nMichigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma,\nOregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West\nVirginia, and Wisconsin.\nof the underlying structure of the prison population and the release schedule. In addition, this method\nenables one the ability to impose changes to the future growth in admissions and release schedules\nwithout ignoring the past and current underlying structure of the prison population.\nThe simulation of changes resulting from policy involved several parameters: the number of\nannual admissions, the growth rate of admissions, the duration-specific release rates, and current\nprison population disaggregated by duration. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics that pertain\nto state-specific admissions allowed calculation of the admissions growth rate, where nine years of\ndata were used to provide a reliable estimate. In addition to knowledge of the current conditions,\nI used hypothetical parameters to reflect some of the current strategies for slowing and lowering the\nsize of the prison population. The cohort component projections provided a comparison between the\nvolume of the prison population if conditions remained the same and the if there was an immediate\nchange in the sentencing, number of admissions, and/or growth rate of admissions that lasted for fifty\nyears. Thus, the projected population combines the sentencing regimes of the past and the population\nproduced by the new policies to depict the influence of newly imposed conditions. Below I provide\nthe main steps necessary to produce the needed output (for more information on this method, please\n2.3. Input Variables\nCurrent Population. This is the current population of the correctional population stratified by\ntype of crime (violent vs. non-violent) and organized by the duration of time served for current stay.\nThe length of the interval for each duration category is six months. For example, the first interval is\nzero to five months (where five months is considered the time up to the beginning of the sixth month),\nthe second is 6 to 11 months, and so forth.\nCurrent Duration-Specific Release Rates. The current duration-specific release rates requires\npartitioning the releases and current population by violent vs. non-violent. The number of releases\nin each duration category forms the numerator of the duration-specific release rate and excludes\nreleases categorized as deaths, escapes, and transfers. The denominator makes use of the midyear\npopulation partitioned by type of offense and the appropriate duration category. The current\nduration-specific release rates are the quotients of the duration-specific releases and duration-specific\nmid-year population.\nCurrent Growth Rate. The instantaneous growth rate, r, can be expressed as:\nlim\nt\n N(t)\nN(t)t\n=\nd N(t)\ndt\nN(t)\n=\nd ln[N(t]\ndt\nThrough a series of equations, we can derive the following as an expression of the mean annualized\ngrowth rate:\nln N(T)\nT\nIn other words, the mean annualized growth rate used was the natural log of the quotient of the\nnumber of admissions in 2009 and the number of admissions in 2000 divided by the length of the\ninterval, which was nine years. In the middle of the nine-year period is the point of interest in this\nanalysis to capture an overall steady rate.\nOnly three states exhibited negative growth rates during the nine year period: New Jersey,\nNew York, and Kansas between 2000 and 2009 (based on authors calculations of data from Bureau\nof Justice Statistics). All other states experienced positive growth rates, with growth rates as high as\n0.06 (West Virginia), accompanied by a standard error of 0.027. Rhode Island had the highest level\nof standard error at 0.263, and a growth rate of 0.033. The range of growth rates and standard errors\nindicate the erratic nature of prison growth and reflect variations in state policies.\nChanges. The last input variables allow changes to the growth rate in admissions, the initial\nnumber of admissions for the projections, and the sentencing via changes in the duration-specific\nrelease rates. The changes stay in place for 50 years.\n2.4. Cohort-Component Mechanics\nTo determine the short and long term consequences of changes, at least two population processes\nhad to occur. The current population continued to be subjected to the duration-specific release rates,\nand the incoming populations were subjected to the parameters detailed above. The summing of\nthe two populations provided the total population. For most of the scenarios, changes were made\nto people committing non-violent offenses. To advance the populations, several calculations were\nnecessary. The most important calculation was the survival ratio, based on the nLx column of the life\ntable. Here, the subscript n indicates the length of the interval and the subscript, x, indicates the starting\nduration of the interval. Thus, we could change this to more accurately reflect the partitioning of the\nprison population by changing the n to a six. In the human population, this column tells us the total\nnumber of years contributed by people the age category depicted by the subscripts. The summation\nof this column divided by the radix of the life table (the number of people in the synthetic cohort)\nprovides us life expectancy at birth, or the average number of years a newborn could expect to live\nif he/she was subjected to the current mortality schedule. In the prison population, the analogous\nmeasure to life expectancy is the mean length of stay.\nThe survivor ratio is the ratio of people who survive from one duration category to the next.\nThe survivor ratio can be expressed, 6Lx/6Lx-6. Projecting the population forward, then, is simply\nthe product of the population in duration x-6 and the survivorship ratio. The calculation is slightly\ndifferent for the first duration interval, zero to five. Here, we utilize the number of admissions,\nb, (which can change yearly by some growth rate) and 6L0. The population size for that category can be\nexpressed as b*(6L0/(0.5*l0)), where, l0, is the radix of the life table. Thus, for each of the simulations,\nthere is an underlying assumption of a fixed growth rate in admissions and release schedule. Further,\nthe release schedule of the current population remains in place for the population already imprisoned.\nOnly new admissions are subjected to the changes. It would be relatively easy to insert variance into\nthe growth rate in admissions and/or the change in the release schedule. However, this was not done\nfor the sake of ease in understanding the short and long-term changes to the overall prison population\nby potential alterations to criminal policy.\n2.5. Estimating the Costs of Zero Prison Population Growth\nIn this paper, I made use of other formal demographic concepts, primarily prison years lived,\nto estimate the costs of each of the policies explored. Most of the strategies required some time for\nzero prison population growth to occur. I estimated the costs once zero growth occurred, which is\nsimply taking the total population at zero growth and multiplying it by the costs for each inmate.\nI also estimated the costs from the implementation of the policy through zero growth. Here is where\nthe concept of prison years lived is especially helpful. The size of the prison population changes over\ntime. Between two points in time, there are people who enter, people who leave, and people who\nare there the entire time. The estimation of prison-years lived allows one to take the entries and exits\ninto account, such that people who enter or leave prison half-way through the year only contribute to\nthe costs for half of that year (and any additional time from prior years). The product of the cost per\nyear to house a person in a state correctional facility and the person-years lived in prison yielded the\ntotal cost of each intervention from implementation through zero population growth. The costs of the\ndifferent policy interventions were compared to the cost if all parameters remained the same.\n3. Results\n3.1. Modeling Changes for Individuals Incarcerated for Nonviolent Offenses\nMost policy initiatives directed at changing the prison population have focused on people\nfound guilty of nonviolent offenses. The actions taken range from diversion programs to changes in\nsentencing structure. I demonstrate the implications of each of the four policy shifts discussed above\nand model how they affect the overall prison size over time. In other words, I model what one might\nexpect to see, given the approaches laid out in the prior section. Let us first consider four possible\nchanges in sentencing the nonviolent inmate population:\n(1) Examine the impact of lowering the average sentence by 20%. This translates into changing the\nlength of sentence for people who commit nonviolent crimes.\n(2) Examine what happens if zero growth in admissions is achieved. This means admissions would\nbe the same from year to year. Policy changes such as using alternatives to incarceration for\nsome offenses might lead to this result. For example, if the year to year variation in admissions\nresulted from drug offenses, rerouting this group to drug courts where the penalties consisted of\nprobation and/or some type of rehabilitation and life skills workshops would make the number\nof admissions to prison stationary year to year.\n(3) Implement an immediate 25% decrease in admissions and then hold that level constant. One way\nto achieve this is to decriminalize the possession/use of marijuana, within reason, and to provide\nalternatives to incarceration for some other nonviolent offenses.\n(4) Observe the results of a constant yearly decline in admissions. This could be achieved by reducing\nthe barriers to former inmates' reintegration into society. Many argue that these barriers are\nresponsible for the high recidivism in the U.S. The prior section provided examples of how states\nare trying to ameliorate the impact of having a criminal record.\nFigure 1 displays the size of the nonviolent population that results from implementing the four\nchanges delimited above. The graph shows each of these changes, as well as what happens when\nthe current regime remains constant, which is represented by the solid black line. The line with the\ncircle-dash pattern represents the change resulting from reducing the length of sentences; it shows\nan initial decline, soon followed by growth. The policies with some promise are those that make changes\nin admissions policies. The line made of dashes shows what happens when there is zero growth in\nadmissions. The line with the dash-dot sequence shows what happens when there is an immediate\ndecline in admissions, followed by no growth in admissions. The last line, the square-dash pattern,\nshows a constant rate of decline in admissions.\nfrom drug offenses, rerouting this group to drug courts where the penalties consisted of\nprobation and/or some type of rehabilitation and life skills workshops would make the number\nof admissions to prison stationary year to year.\n(3) Implement an immediate 25% decrease in admissions and then hold that level constant. One\nway to achieve this is to decriminalize the possession/use of marijuana, within reason, and to\nprovide alternatives to incarceration for some other nonviolent offenses.\n(4) Observe the results of a constant yearly decline in admissions.

The policies with some promise are those that make changes in\nadmissions policies. The line made of dashes shows what happens when there is zero growth in\nadmissions. The line with the dash-dot sequence shows what happens when there is an immediate\ndecline in admissions, followed by no growth in admissions. The last line, the square-dash pattern,\nshows a constant rate of decline in admissions.\nFigure 1. Nonviolent Inmate Population, Changes in Policies for Nonviolent Offenders.

That is, those who are incarcerated\nlonger maintain the size of the population.\nFigure 2. Complete Inmate Population, Changes in Policies for Nonviolent Offenders. Source:\nCalculations by author using Bureau of Justice Statistics data.\nUltimately, we cannot escape the policies of the past, an idea known as population momentum.\nThe sentencing practices of the past influence the size of the current prison population, and\nimmediate change is not possible unless there is something to counteract the momentum. Based on\nthis first exercise, which examined the impact of four changes to the current sentencing regime,\nseveral implications are possible. Policy changes for nonviolent offenses have little effect because of\nthe low mean length of stay for these crimes. Compensating for less punishment for nonviolent\noffenses by giving harsher sentences for violent offenses increases growth of the prison population.\nPolicymakers must consider the momentum of past policies, particularly the longer sentences\nattached to violent crimes.\n3.2. The Costs of Momentum\nReaching and maintaining zero population growth is heavily dependent on the movements of\npeople charged with and sanctioned for violent offenses. Although public safety certainly cannot be\nignored, this population is not part of this discussion of changes, unless a change involves more\npunitive policies. However, there is no reason to increase the current level of punishment for people\ncommitting violent crimes; I argue, rather, that the only way to sustain a lack of growth or negative\ngrowth in the prison population is to implement policies that continue to lower the rate of violent\ncrimes committed. Figure 3 displays what happens to the total prison population when the same\npolicies mentioned above are applied to the nonviolent offender population and the level of\nadmissions for violent offenders remains constant over time.\nFigure 2.

Although public safety certainly cannot\nbe ignored, this population is not part of this discussion of changes, unless a change involves more\npunitive policies. However, there is no reason to increase the current level of punishment for people\ncommitting violent crimes; I argue, rather, that the only way to sustain a lack of growth or negative\ngrowth in the prison population is to implement policies that continue to lower the rate of violent\ncrimes committed. Figure 3 displays what happens to the total prison population when the same\npolicies mentioned above are applied to the nonviolent offender population and the level of admissions\nfor violent offenders remains constant over time.\npunitive policies.

Figure 3 displays what happens to the total prison population when the same\npolicies mentioned above are applied to the nonviolent offender population and the level of\nadmissions for violent offenders remains constant over time.\nFigure 3.

Complete Inmate Population, Changes in Policies for Nonviolent Offenders and Violent\nOffenders. Source: Calculations by author using Bureau of Justice Statistics data.\nThe three policies that showed potential to lower the prison population by making changes\non entry side to people committing non-violent offenses are the same policies that have potential\nto bring about zero and negative growth in state prison populations. Remember that each of the\npolicies requires no increase in violent admissions from year to year. The first requires zero growth\nin admissions for both violent and nonviolent offenses. The second requires either that the level of\nadmissions declines gradually over time, or that there is negative growth in the nonviolent offender\npopulation. The third requires an immediate 25% decrease in the level of nonviolent admissions,\nfollowed by zero growth in year-to-year admissions. Nonviolent admissions would remain at that\nlevel for the foreseeable future. Thus there could be zero and negative growth in the prison population.\nThese findings demonstrate the need to integrate population dynamics when considering new\nprison policies. Policymakers therefore need an accessible tool that allows them to evaluate the short-\nand long-term consequences of policies.2 This tool would enable them to gauge how long it takes to\nreach zero growth and the financial cost of getting there. In other words, another issue to tackle is the\nlength of time it will take for past policies either to die out or be offset by new policies.\nIn 2012, approximately 1.5 million people were incarcerated in state correctional facilities. Based on\nthe models, I provide the number of years until zero or negative growth can be achieved in this\npopulation, and estimate the additional cost of supporting the prison population in the year it reaches\nzero or negative growth. Table 1 displays the results of this exercise, assuming it costs around $30,000\na year to house an inmate. Without any changes in the current sentencing regime and admissions\nschedule at the 30-year mark, the cost would be up to $73.8 billion, or about $30 billion more than\ncurrent costs of running prisons. Although the sentencing change does not achieve zero growth,\ncosts for this scenario at the 30-year mark would be far less than if nothing were done. With zero\nadmissions growth, the additional cost is far less, but still costly at $4.7 billion. The next situation,\na decrease in the admission of nonviolent offenders, actually takes a relatively short time, although it,\nof course, depends on the rate of decline. In 2.5 years, the population reaches zero growth and the\nadditional costs, given the ultimate population size, decreases to approximately $960 million.\n2 Please contact the author for access to a tool that calculates the short--and long--term consequences of policies on the size\nof the prison population.\nTable 1.

The additional costs assume that each inmate costs $30,000 per year.\nb \"Additional costs\" only looks at the additional costs in the final population for each year. For the two final options,\nwhere zero growth will not occur, the costs at 30 years was used. c \"Total costs\" calculates the cumulative costs\n(adds costs each year) from now to the time it takes to reach zero growth. For the two final options, where zero\ngrowth will not occur, the costs at 30 years was used.\nThus far I have only discussed the change in yearly costs at zero growth. This is important, but it\nis also important to consider what it would cost to get to zero growth. Implementing policies will\nslow growth, but growth will continue nonetheless, and the total cost to get to zero growth differs\nsubstantially, depending on the intervention. Estimating the total cost depends on the number of\nperson-years lived in state correctional facilities. In other words, it takes into account the yearly cost\n(at $30,000 per person) as the population grows. For the two options that will never result in zero\ngrowth--decreasing sentence lengths and making no changes--the total costs at the 30-year mark are\n$1.5 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively. The total cost if there is no growth in nonviolent admissions\nis $1.42 trillion, and the negative growth in nonviolent admissions that will take 2.5 years comes in at\n$75.6 billion. No matter what approach a state chooses, the era of mass incarceration will continue,\nand will continue, and will be costly, for some time to come.\nThe last situation, an immediate decrease in nonviolent admissions and no growth in both violent\nand nonviolent admissions for the foreseeable future, would result in immediate negative growth.\nCould this happen? Remember, policies that decrease imprisonment for non-violent crimes are typically\naccompanied policies that call for an increase in the punishment for violent crimes. Furthermore,\nfor negative growth to occur, there must be decrease over time in violent admissions. It will probably\ntake a number of states much more time to reach negative growth because, while achieving zero or\nnegative growth would be great, it would not be at all good to compromise public safety to do so.\nIn 2015, fewer than half of violent crimes reported were cleared by arrest or exceptional means\n(Federal Bureau of Investigation 2016), which conveys that at least 50% of violent crimes committed\nand reported that year had no resolution. It also means that, if all people who commit violent crimes\nwere caught and punished, admissions for these crimes would rise considerably. We also know\nthat many crimes go unreported. Thus, if we were able to increase reporting and clear a higher\npercentage of violent crimes, we would certainly expect to see growth in admissions for both violent\nand nonviolent crimes. These are two positive goals that should not be compromised by efforts to\nachieve negative growth.\n4. Discussion\nThe U.S. currently leads the world's nations in the absolute number of people incarcerated\n(International Centre for Prison Studies 2017). The decades of depending on incarceration as the\nmain form of punishment have forced congressional action and led to greater transparency about the\nmistakes and transgressions that put the country in such a precarious position. Although conversations\non this issue were certainly going on long before the 2008 economic crisis, the current national dialogue\non ending mass incarceration is unprecedented. Accordingly, politicians are now being pushed to\naddress how they will reduce the percentage of their budget spent on the criminal justice system.\nHowever, awareness alone cannot solve the U.S. punishment problem. The U.S. justice system is\nintricate and composed of different units. In addition to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which manages\nthe federal prison system, each state makes its own prison policies and faces different obstacles.\nCalifornia, for example, enacted legislation in 2011 that dictated that the prison population must\nbe less than 137.5% of the intended capacity (Golaszewski 2011). California has shown a decline in\nincarceration for several years now. Most credit this to the 2011 realignment legislation, which diverts\na large class of lower-level nonviolent offenders and parole violators to county jails, rather than state\ncorrectional facilities. While this helps lower the prison population, it potentially shifts additional\nburdens to the jail systems in terms of financial costs and overcrowding in jails (Kubrin and Seron 2016;\nMost state prison populations continue to grow, despite efforts to lower the size and costs of\nmass imprisonment. Several states have opted for less punitive measures for nonviolent offenders,\nsometimes replacing prison with options such as community-based programs, fines, tickets, probation,\nor even much shorter sentences. Still we must ask, can such strategies meet and maintain the policies'\nintended goals?\nFor centuries, demographers explored ways to encourage and discourage fertility rates that\nachieve the golden standard we call a stationary population. This is what China sought to do to avoid\npopulation explosion, and this is one of the central ideas explored in this paper as a means to reduce\nthe size of the U.S. prison population. While China did meet its intended goal, it was left with many\nunintended consequences. As such, careful and dynamic action must be taken to understand the\ncurrent prison situation, including the expected costs of prisons and how those costs can be alleviated\nwithout sacrificing public safety. For example, we must also consider how to reduce the cascading\nconsequences that currently seem to ensure that people who are \"marked\" (Pager 2003) with a criminal\nrecord will eventually return to prison.\nThe findings of this paper demonstrated that policies related solely to the sentencing regime\nwill do little, if anything, to lower the prison population. Policies that reduced admissions via\ndecriminalization of crimes or rerouting people to alternatives that did not leave the mark of a criminal\nrecord showed the most promise. Additionally, removing legislation that inhibits former inmates'\nability to integrate into society could be helpful. However, all of this must be considered alongside\nthe United States' low clearance rate for crime in general and the current size of the violent offender\npopulation. If long-term reduction in the size of the prison population is the goal, the U.S. must attend\nto strategies to prevent violent crimes and consider reforming the current punishments associated\nwith their commission.\nConflicts of Interest: The author declares no conflict of interest.\nReferences\nAustin, James. 2010.
