A smartphone combines the services of the\nInternet and a mobile phone. Smartphones offer qualitatively\ndifferent services in addition to the benefits that the Internet\noffers. Young people watch videos, express themselves,\ncommunicate with friends, and search for information using\nsmartphones, while older people use their smartphone for\nhaving video calls with their children living far away and for\nplaying games. The portability and accessibility of a smart-\nphone make it possible to use it anywhere, for any duration.\nWorldwide, smartphones were used by 1.85\nbillion\na median of 54percent across 21 emerging and develop-\ning countries such as Malaysia, Brazil, and China reported\nusing the Internet at least occasionally or owning a smart-\nphone. In comparison, a median of 87percent reported the\nsame across 11 advanced economies, including the United\nStates and Canada, major Western European nations,\ndeveloped Pacific nations (Australia, Japan, and South\nKorea), and Israel (Pew Research Center, 2016).

Smartphone addiction is a phenomenon that per-\ntains to uncontrollability of smartphone use. People with\nthis problem encounter social, psychological, and health\nSpecifically, adolescents are a high risk group for\nsmartphone addiction. Adolescents are strongly attached\nto their smartphone, and they regard a smartphone as\ntheir second self. Many smartphone users have reported\nthat they would not be able to live without a smartphone\n(Wajcman et al., 2007). Developmentally, adolescents\nexperience several physical and psychological changes.\nWhile, on one hand, they are dependent on their parents\nwith reference to their life and identity, on the other hand,\nthey are trying to be independent of their parents, to\nestablish their identity and to create an independent space\nfor themselves. During these changes, a smartphone\nbecomes indispensable for adolescents. They are inter-\nested in new technology and get used to the operation of\nsuch devices more easily than adults do. Adolescents, as\ndigital natives, express their thought in an online space,\ntry to keep up with fashion, use many kinds of applica-\ntions (apps), and search for emotional relationships and\nsupport. They are good in multitasking, and they pursue\ninstant reactions and feedback (Tapscott, 2009). When\nthese characteristics, including novelty seeking in ado-\nlescents, are combined with their immature control com-\npetence, they are placed at a high risk of smartphone\nIn this study, we targeted adolescents aged 13 to 15years,\nto examine the characteristics of their smartphone addic-\ntion. In addition, we compared a risk group for smartphone\naddiction and a normal user group in terms of their smart-\nphone use patterns and examined the risk factors for smart-\nphone addiction.\nLiterature review\nSmartphone addiction\nSmartphone addiction is considered to be rooted in\nInternet addiction due to the similarity of the symptoms\nand negative effects on users. Internet addiction is defined\nas an impulse control disorder, characterized by patho-\nSmartphone addiction could be categorized as a behavio-\nral addiction, such as Internet addiction. Behavioral and\nchemical addictions have seven core symptoms in com-\nmon, that is, salience, tolerance, mood modification, con-\nflict, withdrawal, problems, and relapse (Grant et al.,\nintegrally researched, but each symptom has been found\nin smartphone addiction studies. For instance, Lin et al.\n(2014) reported four features of smartphone addiction,\nthat is, compulsion, functional impairment, tolerance,\nand withdrawal. Bianchi and Phillips (2005) suggested\nthat smartphone overuse associated with psychological\nsymptoms constitutes a form of behavioral addiction.\nSmartphone addiction is also considered a technological\naddiction that involves human\u00admachine interaction\nSmartphone addiction is considered as the inability to\ncontrol the smartphone use despite negative effects on\nusers. The use of a smartphone not only produces pleasure\nand reduces feelings of pain and stress but also leads to\nfailure to control the extent of use despite significant\nharmful consequences in financial, physical, psychologi-\ncal, and social aspects of life (Shaffer, 1996; Van Deursen\ncharacterized as excessive or poorly controlled preoccu-\npations, and compulsive needs or behaviors that lead to\nA study reported that media addicts could not manage\npeople using the Internet longer had poor social support\nand higher levels of loneliness (Nie and Erbring, 2000).\nChildren using the cell phone displayed more behavioral\nproblems such as nervousness, temperament, mental dis-\ntraction, and indolence, and these problems worsened if\nthe children began using a cell phone at an early age\nAwareness regarding the severity of smartphone addic-\ntion has already been reflected in clinical science and\npraxis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association\n(APA), 2013) introduced the diagnostic criteria for Internet\ngaming disorder and encouraged further research for listing\nit as a formal diagnosis. Oulasvirta et al. (2012) reported\nthat the awareness of problems with repeated use of smart-\nphones was underestimated, and only a few reported that\nthey were aware of it. The few respondents reported\nrepeated usage of a smartphone as annoying, addicting, \"a\ntrap,\" and distracting. They were aware that repeated use\ncould lead to addiction; however, they were not aware of\nthe severity of the repeated and intense use of a smartphone.\nIf one is aware of the risks posed by smartphone addiction,\none would do something against it. The awareness of the\nseverity of smartphone addiction can, therefore, play a role\nin preventing it.\nLife satisfaction pertains to the normal evaluation of\none's surroundings, and subjective happiness or personal\ncontentment (Diener et al., 1985; Scheufele and Shah,\n2000). Addiction to media could increase depressive symp-\ntoms and substance use, and it could decrease well-being\n(2016) showed that smartphone addiction is not directly\nlinked to life satisfaction, but it is linked via perceived\nstress and academic performance.\nCha and Seo 3\nSocioeconomic status\nGender, specifically, being male, is a risk factor for patho-\nlogical Internet use (Frangos et al., 2011). Results from mul-\ntivariate logistic regression analyses have suggested\npercent increased odds for males to be addicted to the\nInternet (odds ratio (OR)\n=\nWomen use the Internet mostly for social purposes and males\ndo so for downloading programs, getting information, and\nfor visiting pornographic sites (Tsitsika et al., 2009; Ybarra\nand Mitchell, 2005). In contrast to Internet addiction, studies\non smartphone addiction reported that females were more\ndependent on smartphones than males were (Billieux et al.,\n2008). Females are more likely to be involved with their\nmobile than males are (Walsh et al., 2011), owing to the dif-\nferences in the purpose of use of mobile phones. Males are\nmore likely to use their phones for functional purposes, such\nas work-related use, whereas females primarily use their\nphones to keep in contact with valued people (Lemish and\nmales and females have different smartphone use patterns.\nAdolescents would be more at risk of smartphone addic-\ntion as compared with adults because adolescents are yet to\ndevelop self-control in smartphone use. Adolescents with\nworking parents could be at a risk of smartphone addiction,\npossibly because such children could not be cared by their\nparents after school and they would use smartphones with-\nout any rules and guidance.\nRegarding the income of smartphone users, there were\ndifferent research results. While one study reported that\nstudents from higher income families spent more time and\nmoney on their mobile phone, another revealed that lower\nincome students used their mobile phones more often\nResearch Center survey (2016) reported that people with\nmore education and higher income were more likely to use\nthe Internet or own a smartphone than were those with\nlower income and less education.\nSmartphone usage pattern\nSmartphone addicts spend considerable time using their\nsmartphone. The daily use duration of a smartphone is one\nof the most significant indicators of smartphone addiction.\npercent of adolescents\nand adults use smartphones for more than 4hours a day to\nmake calls and send messages. In addition, such people\nshowed more problems in psychosocial, health, and techno-\nlogical dimensions, and they exhibited more preoccupation\nwith smartphones and smartphone overuse as compared\nwith those who used a smartphone for less than 4hours per\nThe causes of smartphone use can be attributed to the\ntechnological and content-related features of a smartphone.\nRegarding technological features, Oulasvirta et al. (2012)\nreported that the motivation of smartphone use is triggered\nby accessibility, portability, easiness of operation, connect-\nedness, user interface, design, music and video player, navi-\ngation, and so forth. In Europe, smartphone users touched\ntheir phones about 10 to 200 times a day, for a mean dura-\n(MB) data per day (Falaki et al., 2010). Oulasvirta et al.\n(2012) suggested that smartphone addiction increased\nowing to the habit of checking the phone on hearing a noti-\nfication sound or message. With reference to content-related\nfeatures, Van Deursen et al. (2015) reported that social\nsmartphone use is one of the risk factors increasing smart-\nphone addiction. Salehan and Negahban (2013) suggested\nthat the predictive variable for smartphone addiction is the\nuse of social networking services (SNSs). Park and Lee\n(2012) reported that smartphone addicts prefer to use SNSs,\nwhich could explain why females are more addicted to\nsmartphones than males are. Song et al. (2004) classified the\ntypes of Internet use in relation with addictive behaviors.\nOne type is process-related gratifications, which are\nacquired during consuming or prosuming media. Pleasurable\nexperiences function as rewards and increase the risk of\nhabitual or addictive behaviors. Another type of Internet use\nis social usage. Smartphone addicts spend most of their time\non their smartphone for social purposes (Li and Chung,\nsive use of SNSs can negatively impact one's academic per-\none study reported that the use of a smartphone for gaming\nand the use of multiple apps for gaming were potential risk\nfactors for smartphone addiction, because, in smartphone\ngaming, it is easy to interact with other players through\nother social networking apps. Smartphone gaming, with or\nwithout the use of multiple apps, increases the risk of smart-\nA study on the relative effects of content types on smart-\nphone addiction showed that, among smartphone contents\nsuch as study, entertainment, SNS, and game, except for\nstudy-related content, the other three contents were signifi-\ncant predictors of smartphone addiction. SNS had the\nstrongest predictive effect on smartphone addiction, fol-\nlowed by entertainment, and gaming (Jeong et al., 2016;\nPsychological and physical health problem\nSmartphone addiction affects physical and psychological\nhealth (Abo-Jedi, 2008). Depression or anxiety can cause\ntechnology addiction, in that individuals with depression or\nanxiety use smartphone as a coping method to deal with\ndepressive and negative emotions (Kim et al., 2015).\nSmartphone addicts engage in checking behavior and react\nto notification sounds frequently. That is also a characteris-\ntic of depression and anxiety (Cougle et al., 2012; Evraire\n4 Health Psychology Open \nand Dozois, 2011). A longitudinal study on heavy users of a\ncomputer, social media, and mobile phone showed greater\nlevel of prolonged stress, depression, and sleep distur-\nbances (Thom\u00e9e et al., 2011). Excessive smartphone use at\nnight could keep one awake till late, thus impairing sleep\nand influencing stress and depression (Lemola et al., 2015).\nScreen time and Internet usage were found to affect sleep\naddicts were reported to show poorer sleep quality than\nnon-SNS addicts did (Wolniczak et al., 2013).\nThe negative effects of smartphone overuse on physical\nhealth include cancer; brain tumor; nervous disturbances;\nweakening of the immune system; problems with the eardrum;\npain in the wrist, neck, and joints; fatigue; and sleep disorders\nAs stated above, the overuse of the smartphone causes\nhealth problems, but the deprivation of a smartphone can also\ncause health problems.

They were sampled randomly from strata based\non city, age, and sex. The mean age of the participants was\nyears (standard deviation (SD)=0.78), with 51percent\nthem were in the first grade, 724 (39.7%) were in the second\nschool in 17 cities in South Korea, for example, Seoul,\nBusan, Daegu, and Daejeon. Trained interviewers conducted\nface-to-face interviews with the participants. Before they\nwere interviewed, the participants were informed about the\nsurvey and their consent to participate in the study was\nsought. Their participation was rewarded by a gift worth\nwon (US$4). This survey was conducted by Korean\nInformation Society Agency, to investigate the status of\nsmartphone addiction in Korea and the perception of the\nKorean people on the same.\nQuestionnaire\nThe questionnaire included items on demographic variables,\nsmartphone addictive behavior, and risk factors for smart-\nphone addiction. The participants responded to questions on\nsmartphone use patterns, such as the duration of daily smart-\nphone use; commonly used content of a smartphone, such as\ngame, SNS, music, or learning; and the purposes of the con-\ntent used, such as fun/stress reduction, communication with\npeople, accessing latest information, or passing time.\nRegarding smartphone content, we asked more about the\nSNSandgamethatwereusedmostfrequently(e.g.Facebook,\nTwitter, Kakaostory, Band, Instagram, or others), the dura-\ntion and purpose of SNS and game use, the time slot of gam-\ning, the awareness of gaming overuse, the use frequency of a\nPC room (PC room is a place where one can use the fastest\nPC for gaming by paying some money), and the monthly\nexpenditure for using a PC room.\nIn addition, we assessed physical and psychological\nhealth problems caused by smartphone use. Physical health\nproblems included dry eyes, sleep disturbances, pain in\nneck/wrist/back, digital dementia, chronic tiredness, and\nothers. Psychological problems included anger, annoyance,\nanxiety, depression, aggression, lethargy, and others.\nParticipants could choose multiple responses to report the\nproblems that they faced.\nRegarding smartphone addiction, we sought responses to\nquestions on the degree of life and relationship satisfaction,\nand future career plan. These questions were rated on a 4-point\nLikert-type scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much), to\nrespond to the following statements: \"I am satisfied with my\nlife,\" \"I am satisfied with my relationships,\" \"I have a career\nplan after graduating from the school\" (see Appendix 1).\nWe assessed the awareness on the severity of smart-\nphone addiction in Korea, experience of prevention educa-\ntion on smartphone addiction, and efficacy of the education\nusing the following questions: \"Is the prevention education\non smartphone addiction helpful?\" The question was rated\non a 4-point Likert-type scale from 1 (not helpful at all) to\n4 (very helpful).\nCha and Seo 5\nTo measure the prevalence of smartphone addiction in\nmiddle school students, we used a validated Smartphone\nAddiction Proneness Scale (Korean Information Society\nitems across three subscales, namely, daily difficulties,\nintolerance, and withdrawal. Sample items include \"My\nschool grades dropped due to excessive smartphone use,\"\n\"My family or friends complain that I use my smartphone\ntoo much,\" and \"I panic when I cannot use my smart-\nphone.\" The items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale\nfrom 1 (never) to 4 (always). Some items are scored in\nreverse order to avoid a response bias. The scores range\nfrom 15 to 60, with a clinical cutoff score of 42. The inter-\nnal consistency of this tool was r=0.82 (Korean\nData analysis\nA chi-square test was conducted to investigate differences\nin the demographic variables and smartphone use behaviors\nbetween the smartphone addiction and normal user groups.\nA t test was used to examine differences in the use duration\nof smartphone, SNS, game, and messenger services\nbetween the two groups. Subsequently, a multiple linear\nregression analysis was conducted to identify the predictors\nof smartphone addiction. Results were considered signifi-\ncant at p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using\nResults\nwere classified as a normal user group according to their\nscores on the Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale. The\nrisk group for smartphone addiction showed significantly\nhigher scores on the scale as well as on each subscale of the\ntool as compared with the normal users (Table 1).\nBefore analyzing the difference in smartphone usage\npattern between the two groups, we conducted a chi-square\ntest to examine whether these groups differed in terms of\ngender, age, income form of parents, monthly family\nincome level, and occupation of parents (Table 2). There\nwere no differences in the demographic variables between\nthe two groups. Both groups consisted of almost equal pro-\nportions of women and men. The average age was 15years\nin both groups, and 60\npercent of them were from a dual\nincome family. There was no difference in monthly average\nhousehold income and parental occupation. Thus, the two\ngroups showed a homogeneous composition.\nThe risk group for smartphone addiction used a smart-\nphone for an average of 313.13minutes per day, which was\nminutes longer than that of the normal user group.\nThis difference was statistically significant (t=6.16,\np=0.000).

To identify the sources of differences,\nwe further analyzed the positive and negative answers\nregarding the awareness of game overuse. There was no\nsignificant difference in the positive answers to game over-\nuse awareness. However, the percentage of respondents\nwho replied \"I strongly disagree\" was 23.2 in the risk group\nand it was 16.9 in the normal users. The percentage of\nrespondents who replied \"I disagree\" was 60.7 in the risk\ngroup and 66.8 in the normal users group. Thus, the risk\ngroup showed a stronger denial of their game overuse than\nthe normal user group did.\nRegarding the time slot of game use, there was no sig-\nnificant difference between the two groups.

To explore the risks and predictive factors of smart-\nphone addiction, we examined the physical and psycho-\nlogical health problems caused by smartphone usage, the\nawareness of smartphone addiction severity, and the effect\nof prevention education on smartphone addiction.\nThe prevalence of smartphone addiction in Korean\nmiddle school students was 30.9percent. It is a very high\nrate compared with that reported in other countries. The\npercentages of smartphone addiction in adolescents were\n10percent in England, 21percent in the Philippines, and\nMak et al., 2014). The Korean government has recog-\nnized the severity of smartphone addiction problems in\nadolescents, and the Framework Act on National\nInformatization was established in 2013, to help tackle\nthis problem. According to Article 30 of the act, all\nschools and public institutions are obliged to carry out\nprevention education on smartphone addiction. Although\nsent sample reported having received smartphone addic-\ntion prevention education, which could be regarded as\nvery low without considering other circumstances such\nas budget, reward, and administrative procedures. Among\nthose who received such education, a high proportion of\nthe respondents reported that the prevention education\nwas very helpful or helpful, and this proportion was\nhigher in the risk group for smartphone addiction (78.0%)\nthan that in the normal user group (63.6%). This result\nindicated that the education was effective, and that it\nneeds to focus more on those at risk of developing smart-\nphone addiction rather than on normal users.\nContrary to our hypothesis, smartphone addiction was\nnot related with gender, family income, or parents' educa-\ntion. These results are consistent with those of some studies\nthat reported that smartphone addiction is not significantly\nyears, neither household\nincome nor parents' education was found to have an effect\non the use of smartphones (Groupe Speciale Mobile\n(GSMA), 2011). As smartphones offer a variety of content\ntailored to individual interests, every individual from dif-\nferent socioeconomic backgrounds could find content that\nhe or she is interested in, or which fulfills his or her need or\nTable 7.

Thus, demographic variables showed no rela-\ntionship with smartphone addiction.\nThe main purposes of using SNSs and games were fun,\nstress reduction, and communication with people. This\nresult seems to be natural, but it should be interpreted by\nreflecting on the Korean society, which emphasizes greatly\non children's education. Adolescents in Korea have been\nexpected to exhibit good academic performance in a com-\npetitive social atmosphere. They experience high levels of\nstress associated with academic performance (Park et al.,\nmin-\nutes per day for exams to enter a prestigious university.\nThis is much longer as compared with that reported in other\ncountries, where the duration of studies ranges from 3 to\n6hours (National Youth Policy Institute, 2009). Most of the\nadolescents, thus, spend their little free time on a smart-\nphone, because there are not many leisure activities to\nrelieve stress and have fun. In this environment, promoting\nsmartphone use with the inability to control their smart-\nphone use despite negative consequences could lead to\naddiction. The high prevalence of smartphone addiction in\nKorean adolescents should, thus, be interpreted considering\nthe social environment.\nContrary to our hypothesis, the two groups showed no\ndifferences in life and relationship satisfaction. Life satis-\nfaction is partly related with social ties (Kahneman and\nKrueger, 2006), and frequent social communication has\nbeen found to exert a positive influence on life satisfaction\n(Diener et al., 1991). Internet users have fewer face-to-face\ninteractions like heavy television watchers do (Nie, 2001).\nSmartphone addicts who spend a lot of time on their phone\nare forced to reduce their face-to-face contact time.\nTherefore, smartphone addiction is considered to be related\nwith loneliness and shyness (Bian and Leung, 2014).\nSpecifically, the higher one scores on shyness and loneli-\nness, the higher is the likelihood that one would be addicted\nto a smartphone. In this sense, we hypothesized that the risk\ngroup for smartphone addiction will have lower interper-\nsonal and life satisfaction than the normal user group\nwould. However, the risk group merely showed a tendency\nto exhibit lower life satisfaction as compared with the nor-\nmal user group. Our result suggested that life and interper-\nsonal satisfaction levels could not explain the addictive use\nof smartphone alone. Samaha and Hawi (2016) reported\nthat smartphone addiction is not directly linked to life satis-\nfaction, but it is via perceived stress and academic perfor-\nmance. Satisfaction with life should be explained by many\nother factors such as family support, doing what they want\nto do, personality, positive thinking, and so on. Future stud-\nies should investigate the relationship of smartphone addic-\ntion with life satisfaction and other related variables to\nidentify the extent to which smartphone addiction can be\nexplained by life satisfaction, and to reveal the path of the\ninfluence of life satisfaction on smartphone addiction.\nHowever, the satisfaction of the online interpersonal\nrelationships in the risk group for smartphone addiction\nmay have offset the low satisfaction with their offline inter-\npersonal relationships. To further examine the relationship\nbetween interpersonal satisfaction and smartphone addic-\ntion, future studies should examine the effects of both\nonline and offline relationships.\nConsistent with other studies (Alijomaa et al., 2016;\nTorrecillas, 2007), we found that the risk group for smart-\nphone addiction spent more time on the smartphone, mobile\nmessenger, and SNSs than the normal user group did.\nSpecifically, the risk group spent 5.2\nhours while the nor-\nthat though smartphone addicts used a smartphone more\nfrequently and for a shorter duration as compared with non-\naddicts, the sum of the duration of use in a day was longer\nfor addicts as compared with that for nonaddicts. Another\nstudy that analyzed a large data set on actual smartphone\nusage revealed that the users typically spent almost 1 hour\nper day on the smartphone, but the duration was less than 1\nminute at each instance of use (Boehmer et al., 2011). This\nstudy reported also the differences in app usage duration.\nNews apps were accessed most frequently in the morning,\nwhereas communication apps were used throughout the\nday. Using a data set on smartphone use, Lee et al. (2012)\nshowed that a risk group for smartphone addiction spent\nmore time on smartphone use per day as compared with the\nnonrisk group, and their use was greater in the morning and\nevening. The usage sessions initiated by the push notifica-\ntions were longer for the risk group, which demonstrated\nthat notifications acted as external cues related to problem-\natic usage patterns. In addition, the risk group consumed\nsignificantly more online content that can provide instant\ngratification (e.g. pass time, entertainment, and information\nseeking).\nThe multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the\ndaily use duration of a smartphone and SNS, and the aware-\nness of game overuse predicted smartphone addiction. As\nexpected, longer daily use duration of a smartphone pre-\ndicted higher scores on the smartphone addiction scale, but\nthe awareness of game overuse predicted lower scores on\nthe smartphone addiction scale. Surprisingly, the shorter\ndaily use duration of SNS negatively predicted smartphone\naddiction, which was contrary to our hypothesis and that of\nother studies. Roberts et al. (2014) found that, among col-\nlege undergraduates, one of the predictors of mobile phone\naddiction was time spent on SNSs. In a European cross-\nsectional study, Lopez-Fernandez et al. (2017) reported that\ndaily use of a mobile phone, increased social networking,\nfemale gender, not necessarily monthly payment as type of\ncontract, online shopping, viewing TV shows, download-\ning-related activities, and messaging and chatting predicted\nmobile phone dependence in young adults. However, the\nabove studies focused on young adults, and we could not\nfind any studies on SNS use duration in adolescents aged\nyears. This study showed that the long SNS\n12 Health Psychology Open \nuse duration was not related to smartphone addiction in\nadolescents because the Pearson's correlation coefficient of\nSNS use duration with the smartphone addiction score was\nduration could function as a protective factor in combina-\ntion with other variables. That is, when adolescents use a\nsmartphone daily for a long duration, using SNS could pro-\ntect them from smartphone addiction by engaging in the\nuse of mobile messengers or gaming apps. It seems that\nusing SNS has a positive function of preventing smart-\nphone addition. This result must however be verified in a\nfuture study.\nLimitations\nWhile this study provides new insights into the smartphone\nusage pattern of middle school students in Korea, who are\nin a specific social environment, and the different usage\npatterns of the addiction and normal user groups, this study\nhas some limitations.\nFirst, this survey was conducted using face-to-face\ninterviews. Therefore, social desirability may have influ-\nenced the adolescents' responses. Intentionally or uninten-\ntionally, they might not have been frank about the use\nduration and content used on a smartphone. Lin et al. (2015)\nrevealed a significant discrepancy in self-reported and in-\napplication recorded smartphone use duration. Often,\nsmartphone users underestimate the use duration, and this\nunderestimation is greater in more frequent users than in\nnonfrequent users. To improve the awareness of smart-\nphone use, future studies should investigate the difference\nbetween self-reported and technological records of smart-\nphone use. Self-reported data and actual smartphone use\ndata could provide a comprehensive explanation about\nsmartphone usage patterns.\nSecond, some variables were measured subjectively,\nusing simple questions rather than standardized scales. For\ninstance, life and interpersonal relationship satisfaction,\nand health and psychological problems were based on sub-\njective evaluations. Therefore, to obtain objective data on\nthese variables, it is necessary to use standardized assess-\nment scales and diagnostic interviews conducted by a psy-\nchological or psychiatric professional.\nThird, the prevalence of smartphone addiction was high\nin this study as compared with that observed in other coun-\ntries, but the prevalence could not be compared with other\nstudies because each study used different scales to assess\nsmartphone addiction. Cross-country studies need to be\nconducted to using a common smartphone addiction scale\nto enable comparisons and interchange of strategies for pre-\nventing and treating smartphone addiction.\nFourth, this study provided a broad picture of smart-\nphone use and addiction, but this study could not provide a\nmore focused and deep understanding. This study was a\npart of a national survey on the state of smartphone\naddiction and awareness of Koreans regarding it. Future\nstudies should focus on one theme, for example, type of\nsmartphone addiction, such as SNS, game, shopping, or\nsexual content. Various addiction types would show differ-\nent usage patterns and user characteristics. Therefore, a\ndeeper understanding of the same would be helpful for\ndeveloping effective therapies and preventive programs\naccording to the needs of the individual.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAbo-Jedi A (2008) Cellphone addiction and its relation to self-clo-\nsure in a sample of Jordanian university and Amman private\nuniversity students.
