The reactive\napproach illustrated this engineering way (Galland, 1991).\nThis approach consisted of delimiting zones of accidents\nthrough statistical studies from police reports. Every zone of\naccidents was indicative of an infrastructural geometrical\nproblem. In this way, engineers had to detect the local cause\nof accidents and resolve the problem by a specific road con-\nstruction (Galland, 1991). While the reactive approach has\nsignificantly reduced the number of accidents during 1970-\nMinistry of Transport have begun to change.\nIndeed, after a gradual decline in accidents since 1990, the\ndeath toll of people killed in 6 days rose to 8,437 killed in\nNational Interministerial Observatory [RSNIO], 2007). Faced\nwith this rise, the road safety has become an important stake\nparticularly held by Jacques Chirac who was seeking a sec-\nond presidential mandate during the presidential election in\n2002. After being the \"great national cause\" of his last term,\nroad safety has been declared, after his re-election, the \"vast\npresidential political endeavor\" during the French National\nDay.This change of political semantic is not neutral (Devillard\n& Marchetti, 2008). From that moment, road safety field has\nbecome a showcase space, a barometer of the State action.\nAt the same time, the Ministry of Transport was confronted\nwith structural stakes. Environmental problems linked to the\nland-use planning policy and the decentralization of the State\ncompetences since 30 years in spatial planning project and\ntransports have radically transformed the relation between\nusers and State services. Embodied by the Barnier law (Law\nrelated to the strengthening of the environment protection,\n1995) and the Democracy of proximity law (Law related to\nthe Democracy of proximity, 2002), citizens and associations\nare granted a hitherto unseen right to examine. This transfor-\nmation of the users'role leads to the transparency of the State\naction and to possibilities of judicial sanctions against the\nConsequently, the French Ministry of Transport has\nundertaken a reorganization of its services. Until then, the\nroad safety control was ensured by local services called\nDepartmental Cell of Exploitation and Security (DCES).\nDCES provided a road safety expertise for local services of\nroad construction and also realized the assessment of these\ninfrastructures. In a \"judicialisation\" context,1 the DCES\njudge and be judged position posed problem.

In this way, the protection of the Ministry\nservices against judicial pleas has induced an administrative\nreorganization, which granted a significant place to central\nservices of the State in the road safety control.\nThe RSA implementation also gave the opportunity to\nbring in a new method named the proactive approach. The\nproactive approach considers that the application of techni-\ncal norms is not sufficient to guarantee by itself the users'\nsafety. To go beyond these limits, the proactive approach\nproposes an inductive assessment of the road. It consists of\ndriving on the infrastructure for picking up failing elements\non the basis of the auditor drivers' feelings. As outlined by\nthe designers of RSA, this instrument aims to depart from\ntechnical tropism by giving a place to drivers' experiential\nknowledge:\nRoad Safety Audit . . . is not intended to be technical check on\nthe design elements nor a design standards check . . . Although\nRoad Safety Audit does look at scheme design from the road\nusers' point of view, it is not in fact a road user audit--which\naims to ensure that each road user has been adequately catered\nfor within a scheme. (Belcher, Proctor, & Cook, 2008, pp. 1-2)\nHence, after an experimentation period, RSA had been\nofficially incorporated in 2001 by a circular (Circular related\nto the implementation of a road project security control,\n2001). But, during the experimentation, the auditors realized\nthe road safety control on the basis of their driving expertise.\nThe Ministry integrated a compulsory new technical tool\ncalled analysis grids3: These instruments propose to techni-\ncally frame the use of drivers' experiential knowledge. Used\nduring the assessment of the road, the grids are composed of\nseveral questions considered as the main drivers' interroga-\ntions in a driving situation. These drivers' interrogations\nreferred to technical answers from engineering books such as\nTechnical Conditions for Planning Inter-Cities Highways or\ninstructions about Main Roads Planning. Considered by the\nauditors as a technical check, which digresses from the\ninductive approach of RSA, auditors are confronted with a\ncontradictory injunction. They have to realize the road safety\ncontrol between two different kinds of knowledge: the driv-\ners' experiential knowledge suggested by the proactive\napproach and the technical knowledge from the analysis\ngrids imposed by the Ministry.\nHow auditors proceed to a road safety control between\nthese two forms of knowledge? Does one prevail over the\nother? Do these kinds of knowledge have the same place and\nlegitimacy in the RSAexpertise? Here, we will put aside issues\nabout governmentality (Foucault, 2004) through the New\nPublic Management and neoliberal logics of the audit (Power,\nquestion of confidence granted by the audit through the risk\nissue (Power, 2005). Based on the case study of auditors from\nFrench Ministry of Transport, this research aims to analyze,\nin an ethnographic way, the work done by the auditors\nbetween two contradictory forms of knowledge. This analy-\nsis will interrogate the classical opposition between expert\nand lay-knowledge described in the sociological literature\nand lead us to study the auditors'boundary-work through the\nIn the section \"Beyond the Symbolic Struggle: When\nRSA Revamps the Expert and Lay-Knowledge Relation,\" we\nwill see that RSA revamps the expert and lay-knowledge\nrelation by posing this issue outside the symbolic struggle\ndimension. Based on this observation, we develop an origi-\nnal methodological approach, which consists of defining\nRSA expertise not as a social position but as a process of\nacquisition of knowledge (Tr\u00e9pos, 1996). Then, we will pres-\nent the results of our ethnographic study realized in Lot-et-\nGaronne4 department. As such, we will see that technical and\ndriving expertise are mobilized in two different moments of\nRSA. We will see that these moments refer to a differentiated\nuse of the legitimacy assigned to technical knowledge and\ndrivers' experiences in accordance with the particular stakes\nthat expertise has to answer. Therefore, we will open a last\ndiscussion about the legitimacy of knowledge through the\nproblem extension established by Collins and Evans (2007).\nBeyond the Symbolic Struggle: When\nRSA Revamps the Expert and Lay-\nKnowledge Relation\nFrom philosophy (Habermas, 1973) to the Actor-Network\nand the second wave of the sociology of science (Bloor,\nexpert and laypeople relation mainly focuses on the lay-\nknowledge difficulty to succeed to the symbolic struggle\nagainst the technical or the scientific expertise.\nFor its part, RSA seems to be a paradoxical object. On one\nhand, by using drivers' experiences, RSA seems to transcend\nthe symbolic struggle between expert and lay-knowledge.\nOn the other hand, the technical knowledge and the compul-\nsory character of the analysis grid interrogate the possibili-\nties of hybridization process. In the RSA case, drivers'\nexperiences and technical knowledge both participate in the\nassessment but are related to two different rationales for\naction. The technical knowledge falls within structural log-\nics. It is a form of knowledge that stems from past engineer-\ning experiences and that has been institutionalized and\nformalized in norms. It is internalized as the reference that\nhas to be applied in a given context. The drivers' experi-\nences, for their part, appear as a form of knowledge that\ncomes from subjectivation process (Cantelli & Genard,\nby driving experiences through the singularity of each social\ntrajectory (Dubet, 1994). In this way, driving experiences\nappear as non-formalized knowledge but which can be for-\nmalized in engineering norms in the future.\nHence, the question posed by RSA is not the issue of the\nstruggle between technical and drivers' experiential knowl-\nedge but the issue of the auditor combinatorial activity\nbetween these technical and driving expertise. In this way,\nRSA expertise must be comprehended as the result of exper-\ntise acquisition through socialization process (Collins &\nThe question of the use of knowledge is directly and\ndeeply linked to the issue of the legitimacy. Indeed, a\nsocial actor will use a particular form of knowledge\nbecause, this one, consciously or not, appears legitimate\nfor him in a particular social context. In this way, to ana-\nlyze the legitimacy issue between technical and driving\nexpertise, we decided to use the boundary-work notion\n(Gieryn, 1983). Here, we defined the boundary-work as\nthe notion that focuses on the boundaries lability between\ndifferent forms of knowledge according to their social use\nand actor interplays (B\u00e9rard & Crespin, 2010). Specifically,\nthis notion tends to highlight the paradoxical process\nbetween the permeation and demarcation of knowledge. It\ntends to understand the social determinants that encourage\nthe social actors to consider a form of knowledge, at any\ngiven moment, legitimate to participate in expertise, and,\nat another time, as a non-legitimate.\nBecause the legitimacy assigned to a form of knowledge\nis deeply linked to conscious or unconscious social determi-\nnants, the analysis of the boundary-work in RSA has to be\nput in perspective not only with the political, historical, and\ncultural context but also with the auditors' social trajectories\nthat structure the RSA expertise.\nCase Study: Are Auditors Experts as\nthe Others\nThe study of the auditors' social trajectories and the analysis\nof the historical, cultural, and political background of the\nMinistry have highlighted the specific features of the RSA.\nFruit of the French engineering tradition and holder of a new\nform of expertise, the auditors both differ from the classical\nexpert of the Ministry and fall within the traditional French\nengineering epistemic culture (Knorr-Cetina, 1999).\nIndeed, as the overwhelming majority of scientists and\ntechnicians in France, auditors are civil servants of the State.\nSince the Jacobin period, science and technical domains are\nsubmitted to the administrative supervision of the State\nnotion, defined as the means to recruit, manage, and control\npeople in the administration (Thoenig, 1987) as well as the\nState control toward the schooling system are two instru-\nments that participate to the State domination toward science\nand techniques.\nThe auditors arise from this context. Auditors are road\nengineers and civil servants of the French State. They have\nbeen educated in engineering schools such as the National\nSchool of Technicians of Equipment or the National School\nof Civil Engineering. After graduating, they have moved\ntoward a civil servant career in the French Ministry of\nTransport. There, during the first years, they have been\ntrained trough a companionship system. Escorted by an\nexperienced engineer, they have been trained on the applica-\ntion of technical knowledge and are reinforced with the idea\nof their corps belonging. The case of an auditor from the\nDepartmental Direction of the Territories (DDT) illustrates\nthis trajectory:\nAfter obtaining my engineering degree at National School of\nCivil Engineering, I entered, in 1981, in the road subdivision of\nGers department. In Gers, I learn the crucial knowledge of the\nroad project. . . . In 1981, I met a technician from the National\nSchool of Civil Engineering who was head of section and also\nmy spiritual father. With him, I put my theoretical knowledge to\nthe test of his practices and I learn a lot. (Auditor from the\nMinistry of Transport)\nMoreover, the auditors' trajectories denote the acquisition\nof a heterogenic technical knowledge. Indeed, auditors have\nworked in different services of the Ministry and been initi-\nated into several domains of the road as design, sign boards,\nor accident analysis:\nMy entire career is based on road safety operations. I entered to\nthe Ministry as a designer. In this stage, I learned my job: guides\nand others instructions. I have been lucky to work in\ncompanionship with a road safety technician from the TSCE. He\ntaught me a lot about the horizontal alignment, what it could be\ndangerous about bending and width or not dangerous. Then,\nwhen I entered to infrastructures service, I taught lot of things\nabout the road alignment. What I could do and what I couldn't\ndo about bending and gradient. So, here, it was very precise.\nThere are documents, norms to design a road alignment . . .After\nthat, I entered in CDES. I obtained the rank of assessor . . . I\nwork on the equipment domain as a technical adviser. After that,\nI work more specifically on the road safety issue. I have been\ntrained by my colleagues of the accidents service. Then, I was\nattracted by the proactive approach so I decided to join the\ntraining to be auditor. (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)\nAs we can see at the end of this abstract from an inter-\nview, the auditors' trajectories are also characterized by a\nspecific training. First realized internally and next framed by\na European directive in 2008 (Directive of the European\nParliament and Council about the safety management of road\ninfrastructures, 2008), the RSA training is recognized by the\ncertification handed over by the minister. This training\nemphasizes on the proactive approach learning. It shows the\nnecessity of the use of drivers' experiences in an inductive\napproach of the road and presents the analysis grids, which\nhave to be used to complete the driving expertise.\n4 SAGE Open\nThis training lasted two days. First, they presented the audit\nmethod. The audit is above all a road control based on the\ndrivers' eyes. That's drivers' experiences, sensitivity and\nfeelings. The auditor is more human than prescriptive. In a\nsecond phase, they showed us tools that we have to use including\nthe analysis grids. (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)\nTrained in national engineering schools, then by compan-\nionship in several services of the Ministry, and finally edu-\ncated through the specific RSA training, the auditors'\ntrajectories are characterized by the acquisition of an eclectic\nknowledge. This eclecticism incites auditors to define their\nexpertise as generalist. \"This is general culture. . . . We have\na large and plural knowledge. We are not specialist of a\ndomain but we can bring out where the problem is. We assess\na road project on through the prism of several dimensions\"\n(Auditor from the Ministry of Transport).\nBut, the word \"generalist\" also indicates the integration of\na symbolic violence (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1970). Indeed, if\nauditors define themselves as experts, the auditors' plural\nknowledge is seen on the margins of the institutional defini-\ntion of the expertise. The canonic definition of expertise is\npresented as follows by an auditor:\nAnd you, what do you think about that? For me, I am an expert.\nBut here an expert is someone who perfectly knows his field and\nwho follows the evolutions of his field. To be expert you have to\nbe specialist of a domain. There is an expertise commission in\nthe Ministry, which confers the title of expert to an engineer. In\nfront of a commission people have to show their skills and\nknowledge. Then, a jury decides if you are expert or not.\n(Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)\nAt the end of this analysis, we can see that RSA expertise\nis in the heart of two paradoxes. First, auditors are both\ntrained to technical methods and to driving expertise. Second,\nauditors are subjected to a symbolic violence in the road\nengineering field structured around a distinction between\n\"specialized experts\" and \"general experts.\" Thus, these two\nparadoxes interrogate the role and the place given to the\ntechnical and the driving expertise in the RSA.\nMethod\nTo analyze the auditors' expertise, we have realized an eth-\nnographic study. France is divided into 11 geographical areas\nwhere auditors realize the road assessment: North-West,\nSouth-West, Atlantic, Center-West, West, Ile-de-France,\nMediterranean, Massif Central, Center-East, North, and East.\nIn this study, we have interrogated 11 auditors located in the\nsouthwest of France in the cities of Agen, Auch, Bordeaux,\nPau, and Toulouse. Auditors are road engineers who are\nphysically into local services, as the Interdepartmental\nDirection of the Roads (IDR), the DDT, or the Technical\nStudies Center of the Equipment (TSCE), but, unlike their\ncolleagues, the audit mission is directly reported to the\nGeneral Inspector of the Roads (GIR) from the DGTI\nThrough the observation of daily practices, we have\nhighlighted how auditors produce RSA expertise between\ndriving and technical knowledge. We have based this ethno-\ngraphic study on the \"becoming-expert\" approach devel-\noped by the French sociologist Jean-Yves Tr\u00e9pos (1996).\nThis consists of comprehending expertise as a social process\nof knowledge acquisition through the actor's social trajecto-\nries. For Tr\u00e9pos, many social figures participate in the\nexpertise. In turn, instrument of the political domain or citi-\nzen, the expert realizes his work in the convergence of sev-\neral figures. For bringing out these figures, Jean-Yves\nTr\u00e9pos proposes to analyze the material equipment (books,\ntools, regulations) and the immaterial equipment (knowl-\nedge, representations).\nSo, rather than sociology of expertise, we carried out soci-\nology of experts. We ran this empirical study for 1 year in the\nsouthwest of France. We have realized 46 semi-directive\ninterviews. First, these interviews consisted of interrogating\nauditors about their social trajectories to bring out the imma-\nterial equipment acquired in each important stage of their\nprofessional life.\nThus, concurrently with these interviews, we have real-\nized a documentary analysis of the auditors' material equip-\nment. The analysis grids are the most characteristic tools of\nthe auditor. There are three kinds of grids: urban grids, inter-\nurban grids, and speedways assessment grids. Analysis grids\nare composed of several questions which correspond with\nusers' interrogations in a driving situation. All these ques-\ntions refer to answers from technical instructions and engi-\nneering guides. Instructions are regulatory texts introduced\nby a ministerial circular. They pose rules that must be\nrespected for building a road. Guides, for their part, are\nadvices for applying instructions. Instructions as guides have\na compulsory character. Auditors, as civil servants of the\nMinistry, cannot infringe these technical texts except with a\nministerial decision that allows derogation.\nAfter pursuing semi-directive interviews, we interrogated\nauditors about the use of the drivers' experiences in RSA\nexpertise. Here, auditors had many difficulties to express\nwhat drivers' experiential knowledge was. Evasive words\nsuch as feelings or sensations were employed to qualify it.\nSo, to analyze the way in which drivers' experiences were\nused, we realized direct observations of audit realization.\nConducting direct observations was a relevant method to\nanalyze the auditors' boundary-work. We have distinguished\ntwo different moments in RSA expertise. The first moment\nconsisted of controlling the site with drivers' experiences by\ndriving on it and the second stage consisted, for its part, of\nchecking engineering norms application with analysis grids.\nHere, we have observed the complexity of RSA expertise,\nwhich both transcends and establishes boundaries between\ntechnical and drivers' experiences. Supported by unstruc-\ntured interviews, we interrogated auditors during the assess-\nment of the road and brought out the boundary-work realized\naround the legitimacy of knowledge in different moments of\nRSA expertise.\nHere, we will present results from the audit realization\nobserved in Lot-et-Garonne. This audit consisted of check-\ning 5.7 km of a road bypassing a town constituted by a bidi-\nrectional section, a dual carriageway, and two traffic circles.\nAssessing Roads With Driving\nExpertise: A Cognitive Change in Road\nSafety Control\nArriving at the site, auditors drove on the road at 100 km/hr,\n10 km/hr above the restricted speed because they considered\nthat they would drive at this speed in their everyday life. In a\nbend turning on the right, where overtaking was authorized\nby a dotted line, auditors picked up lack of visibility of the\nopposite road. This feeling was noticed and confirmed in a\nsecond passing. Then, the auditors decided to step out of the\ncar and noted the presence of a noise barrier on the side of the\nroad. They finally concluded that acoustic screening, in an\novertaking action, concealed cars that came from the other\nside of the road. They related this moment to the use of their\ndrivers' experiential knowledge:\nThat's observations or sensations of drivers. I don't know. It's\nlike if I said: with these sensations am I comfortable on the road\nby driving at this speed? It's like sensations related to visibility.\nThat's feelings, drivers' feelings but only feelings you know.\n(Auditor who realized the audit in Lot-et-Garonne)\nIn this instance, the auditors'difficulty to qualify the knowl-\nedge, which participates to driving expertise, can be explicated\nby the fact that auditors mobilize a tacit form of knowledge\n(Polanyi, 2009), specifically a somatic tacit knowledge\n(Collins, 2010). This form of tacit knowledge refers to physical\nlimits of human body. Indeed, if driving can be defined as the\nfruit of socialization process acquired by training in a driving\nschool or by interacting with other drivers on the road, driving\ncan also be comprehended as the fruit of a bodily learning by\nthe apprenticeship of the reduction of field of vision caused by\nspeed or by the integration of road signs information in a mov-\ning car (Dant, 2004). So, we can define the auditors' tacit\nknowledge as a form of bodily past experiences capitalized and\nrevived into the present actions (Sch\u00fctz, 1967).\nThe utilization of the drivers' tacit knowledge can be\nexplicated by two forms of transformations in the methods\nused in the road safety control. First is the change of the\nexpertise temporality. The proactive approach has been\nincorporated to overcome some limitations of the reactive\napproach. One of the most important critics was that reactive\napproach does not anticipate accidents soon enough. Indeed,\nbased on the statistical study of police accident reports, the\nengineering solutions are provided after accidents realiza-\ntion: \"Reactive approach cost a lot. There is dead and\nwounded. The limits of reactive approach are to act after\naccidents\" (Auditor from the French Ministry of Transport).\nThe proactive approach held by RSA proposes to raise\naccident prevention by intervening before the road is opened\nto the traffic. So, the auditors' work cannot be based on sta-\ntistical studies. Thus, the road safety control is realized\nthrough an inductive approach of the infrastructure. Auditors\ndrive on the road to anticipate future accident occurrences on\nthe basis of their lay-drivers' knowledge. This new form of\ntemporality transforms the relation to the knowledge used\nfor assessing the road. Contrary to reactive approach based\non statistical report of accidents, auditors have to anticipate\nwhat kind of accidents could happen. The proactive approach\nencourages in this way the use of the lay-drivers'knowledge:\n\"Contrary to reactive approach, we have no accident data.\nBut even though we don't have data, we are able to predict\nsafety. This subjectivity is based on our experiences of\ndriver\" (Auditor who realized the audit in Lot-et-Garonne).\nThe second change is related to the transformation of the\nrelation to the engineering norms. Indeed, the use of the lay-\ndrivers' knowledge is seen as a supplement of the limits of\ntechnical knowledge. Norms are not considered as the sole\nguarantee of safety. The technical knowledge is seen limited\nfor decreasing, by itself, the accident occurrences. The driv-\ners' experiential knowledge is seen as a palliative of the lim-\nits of technical knowledge. This position also reveals\ninterrogations about a decrease in confidence assigned by\nauditors to their own road safety techniques:\nWe can respect norms and rules and, despite everything, there are\nstill problems for drivers' safety. I think it is one of innovations\nof RSA to say we admit that norms cannot be only efficient for\nsafety. Engineers evolved. Engineers are not absolutely sure that\nthey reach to dominate nature by techniques. When I say nature I\nsay physical nature and human nature and the audit embodies this\nmovement. (GIR, director of the audit mission)\nRSA has transformed the engineering cognitive set in the\nroad safety control. The change in the temporality and the rela-\ntion to engineering norms break off the strict technical assess-\nment held by the reactive approach. In this first stage of the\naudit, the legitimacy accorded by engineers to driving exper-\ntise is unquestionable. The legitimacy of drivers' experiential\nknowledge comes from its capacity to transcend the limits of\nthe technical assessment. In a traditional technical domain as\nroad engineering, the legitimacy accorded to somatic tacit\nknowledge based on past driving experiences is singular.\nDrivers' experiences participate in practice to RSA expertise\nas any other technical form of knowledge. It even appears in a\nlegitimate similarity, which gets around the limitation of tech-\nnical knowledge. However, if the driving expertise is particu-\nlarly significant in the audit's first stage, during the second\nstage, the technical control occupies a central space.\nAssessing Roads With Technical\nKnowledge: The Answer to Political\nStakes\nDuring the second stage, auditors leave the car and walk on\nthe site to control correct norms application. In the case of\n6 SAGE Open\nLot-et-Garonne, some failing points have been brought out.\nFor example, the road sign D42, which informs about the\ndifferent directions at the next crossroads, was not set up at\n1.20 m from the safety barrier. Moreover, two safety barriers\nat a distance of less than 150 m between each other were not\njoined. This checking of norms application was realized by\nthe use of the analysis grids.\nIf the grids want to express the drivers' interrogations on\nthe road, auditors consider grids as a tool for applying techni-\ncal rules than expressing a real drivers' point of view. For the\nauditors, the compulsory character of instructions and guides,\nwhich grids refer to, strengthens the technical vision of the\nroad safety assessment. In this way, grids appear as a tool that\nframes the drivers' point of view in technical thought: \"Grids\nare made for a technical checking to see if all is conformed to\nrules of road conception. So, the answers of questions from\nguides are technical because the answer is based on regula-\ntions\" (Auditor who realized the audit in Lot-et-Garonne).\nIn this second stage, the centrality of the technical exper-\ntise finds a political explanation. An auditor, who contributes\nto the first RSA in France, explains the causes of grids incor-\nporation. The analysis grids have significantly changed the\nfirst objectives of the RSA:\nThe first time I realized the experimental RSA, there were no grids.\nIt was only our drivers'experiences and our knowledge of the road.\nAnd, during this period, we have gone further. In addition to our\ncontrol, we invite users and policemen to assess the road in parallel.\nSo, during the first audit, we were more in drivers'behavior notion.\nNow we are based on grids because, in the last thirty years, there\nhas been the creation of victim associations. Moreover, today\nMedias relay information that road kills. So, the State had to set a\ngood example especially because since Chirac the road safety is a\nnational cause. So, with analysis grids we have a same technical\ndocument of assessment in order to ensure the coherence and the\nhomogeneity of road safety control and consequently of\ninfrastructures. (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport)\nMoreover, this auditor underlines that grids incorporation\nechoes the change of the political road safety context. In a\ndecentralized State organization, where the possibilities of\npleas from victim associations against the State are more\nrecurrent, the Ministry of Transport protected him by the\nincorporation of new procedures: \"More and more victim\nassociations make judicial reviews. Were often are investi-\ngated and blamed. Now, we have established procedures in\norder to avoid that our criminal liability was called into ques-\ntion\" (Auditor from the Ministry of Transport).\nRSA embodies one of these procedures established for\njudicial protection quoted in this abstract from interviews.As\nwe have seen, the suppression of DCES because of its judge\nand be judged position and the supervision of RSA by the\ncentral services illustrate this movement:\nThe circular of 2001has incorporated a system of control in\nwhich the contracting authority is ensured by central\nadministration. There is a very little delegation of power to local\nservices. All files are approved by the minister and for the\nminister through directors of central administrations. If the\nprojectisapproved,itreturnstolocalservicesforimplementation.\nLocal services have a little room for manoeuvre. (GIR, director\nof the audit mission)\nBack in its territories through the RSA, the State protected\nits services against pleas by implementing the same technical\ntool of road safety control. By their compulsory character\nand because they refer to the same engineering regulations,\nthe analysis grids represent a technical reference document,\nwhich guarantees \"good\" realization of the road safety con-\ntrol and, moreover, the same road assessment all over France.\nWe are in a Jacobin Country. If you live in Brittany or in the\nCote d'Azur, a dual carriageway has to be made like this and not\nin another way. Roads has to be homogeneous because users\nmust find everywhere in France road infrastructures which are\nthe same for its safety. (GIR, director of the audit mission)\nFinally, if the technical knowledge, held by grids, is used\nto control the application of engineering regulations, it is\nalso mobilized for political purposes. In this instance, the\npolitical stakes about the pleas against the Ministry have\nnecessitated the incorporation of the same technical refer-\nence document: the analysis grids.\nThis empirical study shows that driving and technical\nexpertise both participate in the RSA assessment. But, they\nare mobilized in two distinct goals. If the driving expertise is\nused to transcend the limits of technical control, analysis\ngrids reintroduce a technical look to answer to political aims.\nThis observation incites an open discussion around the legiti-\nmacy assigned to these two forms of knowledge.\nDifferentiated Legitimacies: Drivers'\nExperiences and Technical Knowledge\nThrough the Problem of Extension\nThe ethnographic study of the auditors shows that drivers'\nexperiences have acquired a real legitimacy in the road safety\ncontrol. Drivers' experiences are not marginalized. On the\ncontrary, they actively participate in RSA expertise just as\ntechnical knowledge. From the reactive approach, which\nrealized a technical control of the road, to proactive approach\nwhere drivers' experiences take part in the expertise, the\nengineering methods of road assessment have changed.\nDriving expertise, which would have been qualified as an\nillegitimate form of knowledge during the period of the reac-\ntive approach, now participates in the assessment as well as\nthe technical expertise. In the abstract of the final report\nbelow, we can see the place given to technical and drivers'\nexperiences. The section written in black refers to technical\nnorms application related to the height of safety barriers or\nthe absence of road signaling. The red part refers to lay-driv-\ner's knowledge and talks about the lack of visibility for over-\ntaking caused by noise barrier on the side of the road.\nBut, during this study, we do not bring out any hybridiza-\ntion process. Even if driving expertise is acquired, in this\nday, a real expert legitimacy in the road safety control, tech-\nnical, and driving expertise appears as two distinct corpus of\nknowledge, which both participate to the RSA assessment\nbut without interpenetration and translation process.\nDespite the legitimacy assigned to driving expertise, a\nboundary with the technical knowledge remains: \"On the\none hand, we have the users' eyes of a lambda driver but, on\nthe other, we have to answer to political orders so we have\ndifficulties to dig out ourselves from the technical domain\"\n(Auditor from the Ministry of Transport).\nThis boundary is structured around the legitimacy\nassigned to the technical and driving expertise according to\nthe purpose that they have to treat in the expertise. This sepa-\nrated coexistence refers to the problem of extension (Collins\n& Evans, 2007), defined as the moving of expertise boundar-\nies around what is considered as legitimate knowledge to\ncontribute to expertise (Collins & Evans, 2007).\nIn this instance, the founding principles of what is con-\nsidered as a legitimate expertise for assessing infrastructures\nhave shifted. Today, the technical knowledge is no longer\nconsidered as the sole knowledge able to guarantee by itself\nthe safety for users. The driving expertise appears as a new\nresource of road safety assessment to mitigate the technical\nlimitations. But, a new form of boundary between technical\nand driving expertise is maintained. The political stakes,\nwhich RSA expertise has to answer, mark the demarcation.\nIndeed, if the use of driving expertise is judged as legitimate\nto guarantee the safety of users, this legitimacy disappears at\nthe moment when RSAhas to answer to the stakes of the judi-\ncial reviews against the Ministry. Here, technical expertise\nheld by the analysis grids still remains the most legitimate\none.\nIndeed, under what is presented as the main goal of exper-\ntise, that is to say the reduction of road accidents, the driving\nexpertise is used in the road safety control of the infrastruc-\nture. But, regarding what are considered as peripheral stakes\nof the road safety control, the technical expertise is mobi-\nlized to answer to political stakes about the possibility of citi-\nzen pleas against the Ministry. In this way, the legitimacy\naccorded to driving expertise ends where the political stakes\nbegin.\nThus, this discussion should not do without a last theoreti-\ncal reflection about the participation of lay-knowledge in the\nexpertise. If the analyses of the expert knowledge domina-\ntion toward laypeople are limited, the hybridization of the\nlay-knowledge seems not complete too. Indeed, this defini-\ntion suggests a translation process of the lay-knowledge in\nthe technical expertise, that is to say a total permeation\nbetween technical and lay-knowledge in another form of\nknowledge: a socio-technical knowledge (Callon & Rip,\n1992). As we have showed, the legitimacy accorded to driv-\ners' experiences ends when expertise is confronted with\npolitical stakes. In other words, a form of lay-knowledge can\nbe considered as legitimate to participate in the expertise but\nremains compartmentalized and assigned outside the man-\nagement of political stakes.\nThus, a question has to be posed. Does the particular legiti-\nmacy assigned to technical knowledge in the management of\npolitical affairs not underpin an unconscious acceptance of its\nauthority in this domain? Bourdieu (1984) showed that, beyond\nthe concepts of authority and domination, the legitimacy is also\ndetermined by a tacit "
