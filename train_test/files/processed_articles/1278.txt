Self-reported measures are more feasible to\ncollect for large population samples, less burdensome for\nthe study participants, and entail fewer costs than values\nobtained by clinical measurements of height and weight.\nAlthough there are many practical advantages of using\nself-reported data, adiposity values calculated from these\nmeasures, such as BMI, may be subject to inaccuracies\nbecause of random and systematic errors, which in turn\naffect the validity of the measures (3). For this reason, it is\nimportant to quantify the degree to which self-reported\nvalues agree with clinical measurements and whether these\nparticipant-provided responses are sufficiently accurate to\nbe used in epidemiological studies.\nMore than two decades ago, Stunkard and Albaum (4)\nreported a high accuracy of self-reported weights across\ndifferent ages and sexes. Also, Stewart (3) studied more\nself-reported values are valid and reliable indicators of\nmeasured weight and height, a finding that was confirmed\nby subsequent studies (5\u00ad11).

Gil-\nlum et al. (10) found a substantial underestimation of the\nprevalence of obesity based on self-reported height and\nweight in women and Mexican-American men.\nWe have found no studies that compared the correlations\nof biomarkers of disease with BMI based on self-reports and\ntechnician measurements. While traditional anthropometric\nmeasures such as weight and BMI are often used in epide-\nmiological studies, measures such as bioelectrical imped-\nance analysis (BIA) are used with increasing frequency to\nbetter distinguish between fat and lean tissue (13,14). The\naim of this study is to assess the validity of BMI based on\nself-reports in a nationally representative sample of U.S.\nadults (NHANES III) by 1) comparison with BMI based on\ntechnician measurements and 2) comparison of correlations\nfor BMI based on self-reports, BMI based on technician\nmeasurements, and percent body fat (PBF) based on BIA\nwith disease biomarkers.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nThe NHANES III study was conducted between 1988 and\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. This study was\ndesigned to provide a nationally representative sample of\nthe U.S. population (2 months of age) and to collect\ninformation on the health status of U.S. civilian noninstitu-\ntionalized populations. NHANES III sample design reflects\na stratified multistage probability design that included over-\nsampling of Mexican-American and black populations. This\nwas done to produce statistically reliable health estimates\nfor the two largest ethnic minority groups in the United\nStates. The sampling method was similar to those used in\nprevious Health and Nutrition Surveys, and details of the\nsampling methods and methodological information have\nNHANES III consisted of a survey and clinical exami-\nnation. All participants were interviewed at home (N \nthe clinical examination portion; 31,311 of those invited\nreceived a clinical examination. The exam was performed in\na mobile examination center for all who were able and at\nhome for those who were unable to attend the mobile\nexamination center.\nMeasurements\nWeight and height were measured by two methods: self-\nreported and clinically examined. Self-reported measures\nincluded in the at home survey, and clinical measurements\nwere collected at the clinical examination. Respondents\nwere asked, \"How much do you weigh without clothes and\nshoes,\" and \"How tall are you without shoes\" (15). These\nself-reported values were recorded in inch and pound units\nand converted to metric units. Subsequently, trained health\ntechnicians measured the weight and height of those partic-\nipants who attended the clinical examination, as described\npreviously (15). Height was measured to the nearest milli-\nmeter using a fixed stadiometer. Body weight was measured\nin kilograms (to the second decimal place) by a self-zeroing\ndigital weight scale for adults dressed in underpants, a\ndisposable paper gown, paper pants, and foam slippers. A\nToledo 2181 self-zeroing digital weight scale (Toledo\nScale, Columbus, OH) was used at the mobile examination\ncenter, and a SECA Integra Model 815 Scale (SECA, Ru-\nmily, France) was used for the home examination. Both\nscales were standardized (15). Measured values refer to\nweight and height measured by a physician during the\nclinical examination.\nFor the first time in a NHANES study, bioelectrical\nimpedance resistance measures were also taken during the\nclinical examination. To obtain PBF through BIA, patients\nwere instructed to lie on their backs while electrodes were\nplaced on their wrists and ankles. These electrodes delivered\na low-level alternating current (1 mA) measured at dis-\ntinct frequencies between 5 KHz and 1 MHz (15). PBF from\nBIA was used as a measure of body fat composition that\nmay not be captured through BMI measures. PBF was\ncalculated using prediction equations (14). First fat-free\nmass (FFM) was calculated through the Deurenberg predic-\nTotal body fat (TBF) was defined as the difference between\nweight and FFM. Finally, PBF was calculated as the ratio of\nTBF to weight (kg).\nPBF  (Wt  FFM)/Wt  TBF/Wt\nThose participating in the survey portion of NHANES III\nwere not told that they might be weighed and measured later\nduring the clinical examination. Blinding the participants to\nthe fact that they would later be clinically measured helps\nensure that the self-reported measures will be more similar\nto self-reported weight and height collected in epidemiolog-\n1 Nonstandard abbreviations: NHANES III, National Health and Nutirtion Education Study\nIII; BIA, bioelectrical impedance analysis; PBF, percent body fat; FFM, fat-free mass; TBF,\ntotal body fat; FBG, fasting blood levels of glucose; TG, triglyceride; HDLC, high-density\nlipoprotein-cholesterol; SBP, systolic blood pressure; CRP, C-reactive protein; LEP, leptin;\nCI, confidence interval.\nValidity of Self-reported BMI, McAdams, Van Dam, and Hu\nical studies.

Measured\nBMI was calculated using the weight and height recorded in\nthe physician's examination portion of the survey. The term\nmeasured BMI is used here to describe BMI calculated\nusing measured weight and height. Self-reported BMI was\ncalculated from the previously mentioned questions, which\nwere part of the household survey; self-reported BMI will\nbe used to describe BMI calculated by self-reported weight\nand height.\nFasting blood levels of glucose (FBG), triglycerides\n(TGs), blood levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol\n(HDLC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), C-reactive protein\n(CRP), and leptin (LEP) were measured in blood collected\nduring the clinical examination (18).\nAnalytic Sample\nAll subjects in this analysis were participants in\nwho participated in the clinical examination, 10,639 met the\ninclusion criteria. For this analysis, we first excluded all\nOf the adult population, we also excluded those with re-\nported diabetes or diabetes treatment (1437 participants),\nand, in addition, any of the remaining participants who used\nantihypertensive medication or cholesterol-lowering treat-\nments (4162 participants). These treatments and diseases\ncould confound the examined associations and complicate\ninterpretation of the results. Finally, participants who were\nmissing self-reported or measured height or weight (792\nparticipants) were excluded from this analysis, so that each\npatient would have at least one self-reported measure of\nBMI and one anthropometric measure. In addition, women\nwho were pregnant and participants with pacemakers were\nexcluded to ensure the accuracy of the BIA resistance data.\nSample sizes varied for the biological markers because of\nmissing values, with all analyses containing 10,000 par-\nticipants except for the analysis involving LEP (n  4203).\nsures, of which we analyzed 9481 who met our inclusion\ncriteria.\nStatistical Analysis\nThis study analyzed NHANES III data with SAS (version\n8; Statistical Analysis System, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)\nsoftware (19) to incorporate the sampling weights consistent\nwith the sample design of NHANES III. This was done to\ncompensate for the unequal probability of selection caused\nby the complex, multistage design of the survey, adjustment\nfor noncoverage and nonresponse, and oversampling of\nsubgroups. SUDAAN was used to calculate estimates and\nSE by taking into account the sampling weights and sample\nTable 1.

Statistical sampling weights for the total mobile\nexamination center or the home clinically examined sam-\nples were used, when appropriate.\nThe error in self-reported weight was calculated as the\ndifference between self-reported and measured weight. Dif-\nferences were also calculated for height and BMI, for which\nwe calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Error in\nself-reported weight, height, and BMI was calculated for\ngroups differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and age.\nAdults were categorized by sex (male or female), age\ngroup (60 or 60 years of age at interview), and BMI\nwere calculated for self-reported and measured weight,\nheight, and BMI, as well as biological measures. Age was\ncategorized as 60 or 60 years to be consistent with\nprevious published papers that suggested an effect of age on\nthe validity of self-reported weight, height, and BMI (12).\nBMI was categorized using the established World Health\nOrganization cut-points (20). Tables were stratified by age,\nrace/ethnicity, and sex.\nTo further study the association between self-reported\nand measured BMI, we constructed a Bland-Altman plot\n(21) of the differences in measured and self-reported BMI\nvs. the average of these two values.\nOutcome variables with skewed distributions, such as\nself-reported weight and height, measured weight and\nheight, FBG, TG, HDL, SBP, CRP, and LEP were log-\ntransformed for the analyses. Adjusted multiple Pearson's\ncorrelations were used to measure the correlation between\nlog-transformed self-reported variables and log-transformed\nmeasured variables, as well as log-transformed biological\nTable 2.

Similar summary statis-\ntics were found among subgroups by sex, race/ethnicity, and\nage (Table 1).\nComparison of BMI Based on Self-reports and BMI\nBased on Technician Measurements\nThe Pearson's correlation coefficients between self-re-\nported and measured weight, by sex, race/ethnicity, and age\ngroup, are presented in Table 2.

For all biological measures, the correlations\nassociated with BIA were either similar to or lower than\neither BMI correlation value; in the case of SBP, the dif-\nference was substantial (Table 4). For the total population,\ncorrelations between self-reported BMI and FBG (r \ndifferent from those with measured BMI, whereas correla-\ntions with TG and CRP were slightly lower for self-reported\nBMI (Table 4). In contrast, the correlations between BIA\nmeasures and disease biomarkers were substantially lower\nthan those for measured BMI. This difference existed in\nall subgroups except for those 60 years old, for whom\nthe correlation between BIA and CRP was similar to those\nwith measured BMI (r  0.26). Similar correlations be-\ntween self-reported and measured BMI with biomarkers\nwere also observed within different measured BMI catego-\nries (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nEpidemiological studies have evolved in the past decades\nsince the Stunkard and Albaum publication (4). With the\nincreasing use of biomarkers of obesity-related disorders in\nstudies, understanding the use of self-reported anthropomet-\nric measures is important. This analysis of NHANES III\ndata indicates that self-reported and technician-measured\nheight and weight are highly correlated. We observed un-\nderreporting of weight and overreporting of height, causing\na slight underestimation of BMI. This was most pronounced\nin subgroups such as Mexican Americans and older partic-\nipants. Correlations of self-reported and measured BMI\nwith obesity-related biomarkers were similar not only to\neach other, but also to those between BIA measures and\nbiomarkers. Although the correlations for self-reported BMI\nand biomarkers, such as CRP and TG, were slightly lower\nthan for technician measured BMI, these differences do not\nseem to be of a magnitude that is clinically significant. Both\nmeasures showed a moderate to strong positive association\nbetween adiposity and the studied biomarkers, and research-\ners would have drawn similar conclusions regardless of\nwhich measure of BMI was used. The latter result agrees\nwith a previous analysis of the NHANES III data that found\nBIA-estimated body fat was not superior to measured BMI\nin predicting obesity-related markers (22).\nPrevious reports of NHANES datasets have found a\nstrong relation between self-reported and measured weight,\nfound that self-reported BMI was under-reported in women\nand Mexican Americans as a consequence of overreporting\nheight and underreporting weight (10). Variability in the\ncorrelations was seen in different ethnic/racial groups. Also,\nweight and BMI discrepancies were associated with age\ngroup and measured BMI, as was noted by Kuczmarski et\nal. (7) and Villanueva (6). Although many other studies\nhave examined the differences between self-reported and\nhave examined the correlation of self-reported anthropomet-\nric measures and disease biomarkers in nationally represen-\ntative populations.\nNHANES III is a large cross-sectional study of the U.S.\npopulation designed for nationally representative samples\nfrom the U.S., and results have been widely published. In\nour analysis, the population includes men and women of\ndiverse ages and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Self-reported\nTable 5. Adjusted* correlations for biologic measures and anthropometric measures by measured BMI\n* Adjusted for sex, race, and age group.\nValidity of Self-reported BMI, McAdams, Van Dam, and Hu\nmeasures of weight and height were taken in close proxim-\nity to the measured values but were obtained without the\nparticipants knowing they would subsequently be mea-\nsured. Therefore, the self-reported values are similar to what\nwould be obtained in an epidemiological study with only\nself-reported measures. Different biological measures\nknown to be predictive of obesity-related disorders were\nused to examine the overall use of different anthropometric\nmeasures. The blood levels of biomarkers such as FBG,\nTGs, and HDLC, as well as SBP, reflect levels of adiposity\n(24), which makes these variables useful to compare the\nperformance of different anthropometric measures (25).\nThis study suggests that self-reported BMI can provide\nsufficiently accurate information in epidemiological studies\nin which the primary outcomes are disease biomarkers or\nobesity-related diseases. PBF calculated through BIA was\nnot superior to BMI as a predictor of biological markers\nknown to be associated with adiposity and risk for obesity-\nrelated diseases. Although we found self-reported BMI to\nbe highly correlated with measured BMI, some underesti-\nmation of true BMI occurs when BMI is based on self-\nreports. We therefore conclude that in most epidemiological\nstudies of adiposity-related conditions, using self-reported\nBMI will produce minimal bias for the measure of associ-\nation, although it can lead to some underestimation of the\npopulation prevalence of obesity.\n"
