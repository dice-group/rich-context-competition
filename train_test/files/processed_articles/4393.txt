    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the socio-cultural practices and interactions of learning science in a science\nclassroom within the concept of communities of practice. Our qualitative data were collected through observing, taking\nfield notes, and conducting interviews in a public science classroom during an entire school year. The study occurred in\na seventh-grade classroom with a veteran physical science teacher, with more than 10 years teaching experience, and 22\nstudents. For this article, we presented two classroom vignettes that reflect a sample of the participation, practice, and\ncommunity that was observed in the science classroom on a daily basis. The first vignette illustrated a typical formula of\nInitiation\u00adResponse\u00adFeedback (I-R-F) that transfers knowledge to students through a teacher-led discussion with the entire\nclass. The second vignette described a laboratory activity designed to allow students to apply or discover knowledge through\npractical experience, while taking responsibility for their learning through small-group work. The normative practices and\nroutine behaviors of the science classroom are highlighted through the description of material resources, and different\nmodes of participation accompanied by assigned roles and responsibilities. What we observed was that laboratory activities\nreproduced the epistemic authority of the I-R-F rather than creating collective cognitive responsibility where students have\nthe independence to explore and create authentic science experiences.\n",

On the contrary, in most\nschools, science classroom communities' practices are\nviewed as the safe version of scientists' practices performed\nin their communities (Archer et al., 2010). In addition, we\nrecognize that there are classroom science practices unre-\nlated to practices of scientists in research laboratories (Chinn\nriculum objectives, standards, and standardized testing.\nThese practices may discourage students to learn from\nauthentic tasks relevant to real-world problems (H\u00f6ngstr\u00f6m,\nOttander, & Benckert, 2010) and do not reflect the social\nnature of practice that encompasses commitment, uncer-\ntainty, peer review, and so on (Bricker & Bell, 2008).\nThus, our premise is that the practices of science and the\npractices of the science classroom are divergent with dis-\nsimilar social contexts. To understand these science class-\nroom practices, we asked the following research questions to\nexplore the socio-cultural practices and interactions of learn-\ning science in a science classroom to identify the normative\nschool science practices, interactional patterns, and power\nrelations:\nResearch Question 1: What are the students' science\npractices?\nResearch Question 2: What is the nature of the \"partici-\npant structures\" that emerged within the scientific\nevents the students performed?\n1The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK),\nAnkara, Turkey\n2Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA\n3Texas A&M University, College Station, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMehmet C.

We address these communi-\nties of practice to focus on the group behaviors versus indi-\nviduals. After a discussion of the methodology, we present\nand analyze two vignettes that illustrate observed class-\nroom members' engagement and interaction in two differ-\nent contexts: lecture and laboratory. The discussion of our\nfindings outlines the social dynamics that trigger and hin-\nder the formation of a classroom community of practice\nwithin a science classroom. Our findings are important for\ndesigning learning environments aimed to cultivate sci-\nence learning through participation, belonging, and prac-\ntice, in ways that might mimic professional scientific\ncommunities of practice or foster learning through\ndiscovery.\nTheoretical Framework\nSchool Science Classroom and Its Social Structure\nOur study will use a socio-cultural approach to provide an\nunderstanding of the social and cultural systems of class-\nrooms and students' classroom involvement (Kozulin,\nGindis, Ageyev, & Miller, 2003). Within a classroom culture,\nmembers construct social norms and rules as they develop\ndifferent roles and establish relationships among themselves\nand participant identities (Collins, 2006). The social author-\nity and epistemic role of the teacher contribute to the con-\nfiguration of the classroom culture by organizing and\nmanaging normative classroom practices, and in establishing\nConflicts, tensions, and disagreements are central to form\nand sustain a classroom community of practice and are cen-\ntral to this study for understanding the emergence or absence\nof a community of practice within a science classroom\n(Wenger, 1998). Individuals develop common knowledge\nthrough sharing and negotiating their understanding and\nexperience with each other in most classrooms (Elbers &\nStreefland, 2000). They may encounter conflicts with other\nstudents or resistance to their ideas, thoughts, and claims\nwhen engaged in activities with a discussion component\n(Olitsky, Flohr, Gardner, & Billups, 2010; Oliveira & Sadler,\n2008). When this occurs, these temporally emergent circum-\nstances are accommodated through the social interactions\nand negotiations among the classroom members (Mortimer\n& Scott, 2003). This study will focus on these temporal\nemergent circumstances because they lead to a shared reper-\ntoire among the members and help develop individual roles\nPhilips (1972) coined the term \"participant structures\" as\nthe context of participants' engagement, their social norms,\nrelationships, roles, and responsibilities, and the materials\nand knowledge acquisition. We analyze and articulate the\nsocial structure of a science classroom using \"participant\nstructures\" to explain (a) how class members participate in\nand sustain their practices, (b) what roles the teacher and the\nstudents are engaged in, (c) what relationships they establish\nin maintaining memberships, and (d) what types of resources\nare shared and generated (Cornelius & Herrenkohl, 2004;\nA community of practice encompasses three indicators--\nmutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire\n(Wenger, 1998). Mutual engagement is attributed to mem-\nbership, diversity, and relationship within a community that\ncreates a joint enterprise among the members:\nThe enterprise is the result of a collective process of negotiation\nthat reflects the complexity of mutual engagement. It is not just\na stated goal, but creates among participants relations of mutual\naccountability that become an integral part of the practice.\nThis in turn creates a shared repertoire as a set of resources,\nincluding routines, ways of doing things, words, tools,\nactions, concepts, or discourse that the community members\nuse and/or produce to sustain their memberships in a\ncommunity.\nCentral to a community of practice are participation and\nidentity transformation (Wenger, 1998). Participation is a\ncatalyst to developing and sustaining a community of prac-\ntice in a way that shapes members' actions and identities.\nParticipation is not limited to engaging in activities; it is also\na process of becoming a full participant. In this sense, Roth\n(1998) suggested that students be encouraged to engage in\nauthentic tasks in a community of classroom practice in\nwhich a novice learner or a newcomer adopts and uses a\nclassroom community's norms and beliefs to become a full\nmember of that community as opposed to grades and exams\nemphasized in most conventional classrooms (Barab &\nDuffy, 2000). Identity transformation occurs in the context of\nbecoming a full member in a community. Individuals at dif-\nferent levels of participation and membership become famil-\niar with and use knowledge, and master skills of a community\nthrough their personal trajectories of participation (Clark,\n2005). In the classroom context, a student learns as she\ndevelops and transforms her identity through her personal\ntrajectories of participation in a shared school science\npractice.\nResearchers have been interested in developing a com-\nmunity of practice in educational settings (Aguilar, 2009;\nClark, 2005). They examine the elements of communities of\npractice and use communities of practice as a framework to\nunderstand how individuals learn. Yet, there are a few studies\nthat explore and document the potential dynamics that deter-\nmine whether or not a community of practice emerges within\nschool settings, and how it does or does not emerge (Aguilar,\nAyar et al. 3\nAguilar (2009) has identified students' learning in school\nscience context by addressing the three interrelated con-\nstructs: (a) mutual engagement, (b) joint enterprise, and (c)\nshared repertoire. In her model, knowledge transmission by\nthe teacher and non-participations of the students was a bar-\nrier to the development of a classroom community of prac-\ntice. Whereas Olitsky (2007) observed that different types of\ninteractional events (e.g., one-on-one and whole-class) are a\nmeans to increase student engagement and student learning\nas well as to form a classroom community of practice, Roth\net al. (1999), in contrast, found that a small number of stu-\ndents participated in science classroom discourse practices,\nalthough students were provided with the opportunity to\ndevelop their own artifacts through different levels of social\nconfiguration (e.g., whole class and small group).\nIn this study, we contribute to this line of inquiry with a\nstudy of learning and teaching science in a seventh-grade sci-\nence classroom by highlighting the normative school science\npractices, interactional patterns among members of the class-\nroom, power relations, and cultural portrait of the classroom.\nTo address these issues, we examine the elements of the\nclassroom's community of practice.\nMethod\nThe Setting\nThis ethnographic study was conducted in a public school\nclassroom in North America. With one class for each grade\nlevel, the school hosted approximately 250 students in kin-\ndergarten through 12th grade in the same building. The\nschool served a middle-class neighborhood in mid-sized\ncommunity located nearby a major university. Several\nschools in the targeted community were approached and this\none self-selected itself to be the focus of this study. The 7th-\ngrade classroom, which is the focus of this study, had 22 stu-\nwere HispanicAmerican, and 46% were EuropeanAmerican.\nIts racial breakdown was representative of the community.\nMs. Corbin1 was the certified physical science teacher.\nShe has been teaching seventh- and eighth-grade science\ncourses in the middle school and physics, biology, and chem-\nistry courses in the high school over 10 years. For the last 3\nyears, Ms. Corbin has been organizing and supervising in-\nand out-school activities relevant to physical sciences.\nDuring the year of observation, she used the science curricu-\nlum that conformed to the state's science standards.\nData Collection and Analysis\nThis study was conducted in one science classroom to\ndevelop a \"thick\" description of the community of practice\nwithin it. Specifically, our aim was to determine the social\ndynamics that support or hinder the emergence of a commu-\nnity of practice in the school science context via normative\nschool science practices, interactional patterns, and power\nrelations.\nParticipant observation method was employed to thor-\noughly explore students' behaviors and actions during the\nclassroom cultural activities (Spradley, 1980). The first\nauthor closely engaged with the teacher and the students in\nthe classroom for an academic year. During laboratory activ-\nities, the investigator interacted with students in groups and\none-on-one and sometimes participated in labs as a member\nof the team. During these interactions, the investigator asked\nthe students both rhetorical and literal questions to document\nwhat they thought they were doing in the laboratory\nactivity.\nThe observer's role in class changed over time from a pas-\nsive participant role to an intermediate participant role. He\nmaintained the balance \"between being an insider and an\noutsider, between participation and observation\" (Spradley,\n1980, p. 60) by gradually adjusting his participation in the\nactivities and timing his questions to the activity. This strat-\negy allowed him to capture the local occurrences in the class-\nroom. As a participant observer, the investigator supervised\nthe students' extracurricular science fair projects at the\nrequest of students and the teacher. In his role as the science\nfair supervisor, he offered support to students' projects but\nabstained from directing their projects.\nObservation notes were made during visits and daily jour-\nnal entries provided additional details. The field notes and\ndaily journal included classroom observations and the\nobserver's self-reflections about the events of the classroom.\nThey also included notes on conversations with the students\nand Ms. Corbin in and outside of formal classroom activities.\nFormal interviews were recorded and transcribed.\nTwo data analysis methods were employed: (a) the ethno-\ngraphic data analysis method (Spradley, 1980) and (b) the\nconstant-comparative method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to\nanalyze data collected through participant observation and\ninterviews, respectively. Interviews were transcribed verba-\ntim. Interview transcripts and participant observations were\nmerged with the daily journals and artifacts (e.g., handouts,\nstudent presentations, and quiz or test sheets) to identify nor-\nmative school science practices, interactional patterns, and\npower relations.\nVignette 1: Presenting, receiving, and reproducing ready-\nmade scientific facts\nThe focus of the lesson is a quiz about deoxyribo nucleic acid\n(DNA) base pairing. Before the quiz, Ms. Corbin has stu-\ndents recall DNAstructure, and in their words, it is a \"twisted\nladder,\" while the teacher uses its technical term \"double\nhelix.\" Ms. Corbin distributes quiz sheets. Each sheet has\ndifferent samples of DNAstructure. Meanwhile, she instructs\n4 SAGE Open\nher students that they can gain extra credit if they write the\nnames of four bases correctly. Tim responds to her by asking,\n\"What if I misspell the names of the bases\" because \"the\nnames of bases are not so familiar to me, and they sound like\ntechnical terms.\" Ms. Corbin answers him by speaking to the\nentire class, \"Unless there are major misspellings, you will\nget credit.\" At this point, she gives students 3 min to com-\nplete their quiz.\nWhen students finish the quiz, Ms. Corbin picks a DNA\nsequence sample from the quiz and writes it on the white-\nboard. She asks students, \"What does Adenine (A) pair up\nwith?\" One student responds, \"A pairs up with Thymine\n(T).\" Ms. Corbin continues to ask, \"What does Cytosine (C)\npair up with?\" Another student tells, \"Guanine (G),\" and so\non. When Ms. Corbin and students have finished to pair up\nthe four bases (A, T, G, S), she lists and writes down the\nnames of four bases on the whiteboard. At the same time,\nstudents self-check whether the names of four bases are writ-\nten correctly on their quiz sheet. Yet, the teacher does not\ngrade students' quiz nor are they recorded in her gradebook.\nAfter students put the quiz away, Ms. Corbin moves on to the\nnext activity.\nMs. Corbin asks the students, \"How does DNA determine\nyour traits?\" She writes DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) on\nthe whiteboard. She asks first, \"What does DNA stand for?\"\nTom says, \"Deoxyribonucleic acid.\" Then Ms. Corbin\nexplains that the only difference between DNA and RNA is\ndeoxy, which RNA does not have. Therefore, RNA stands for\nribonucleic acid. She jots down the full names of DNA and\nRNA on the whiteboard. She asks the students to recall the\nfour bases in DNA. They express and list four bases--A, T,\nC, and G. She immediately interjects, \"RNA does not have T\nbase; instead, it has Uracil (U) along with other three bases.\"\nBy using recall and reminding techniques, Ms. Corbin\ndescribes DNA, mRNA, and tRNA, and notes their traits on\nthe whiteboard. Meanwhile, the students are busy with writ-\ning notes about RNA and its four bases in their notebooks.\nThen, she asks them to get a clean sheet of paper and instructs\nthem to \"Flip your paper in half vertically and then flip the\nother half in half again. You will have four columns.\"\nMeanwhile, she walks around and surveys whether students\nhave it as she has instructed. She is back to the whiteboard\nand writes a sample of DNA sequence--CATGCTAAT--on\nthe whiteboard. She instructs the students to label four col-\numns with headings: mRNA, tRNA, protein, and traits. She\nhas them note that mRNA is a messenger RNA; tRNA is\ntransfer RNA.\nMs. Corbin explains, \"C in DNA sequence pairs up with\nG in mRNA.\" She asks Danielle, \"A in DNA pairs up with\nwhat?\" to which Danielle hesitantly says, \"U?\" Meanwhile,\nother classroom members are insistently holding their hands\nup to get permission to answer this question. Ms. Corbin\nreminds everyone, \"RNA does not have T base; instead it has\nUracil.\" She marks it with a star on the whiteboard. She con-\ntinues by questioning the class with \"T in DNA sequence\npairs up with what?\" She goes through a sample of DNA\nsequence by pairing up the bases in mRNA and tRNA. Every\ntime, she points to the U base in the RNA sequence.\nWhen the students finish pairing up bases, Ms. Corbin\nasks them to look up the information provided in their activ-\nity sheet to identify protein codes based upon triple bases in\nthe mRNA sequence. When there is no response from them,\nMs. Corbin adds, \"GUA sequence is called Valine according\nto the information in the activity sheet\" and \"CGU sequence\nis Arginine and UUA sequence is Leucine.\" She finishes\nwith \"these are the types of amino acids.\" Ms. Corbin encour-\nages students to imagine the whole sequence of DNA and its\ncounterparts in mRNAand tRNAsequences by what kinds of\namino acid are produced. When students do not answer, she\nanswers for them with, \"If we consider the whole sequence\nof amino acid, then it looks like hitchhiker's thumb.\"\nVignette 2: Learning by doing some practical works\nOn one Monday afternoon, Ms. Corbin starts the class by\ntelling students, \"We will have a lab activity about the physi-\ncal and chemical changes.\" A whisper of \"YES\" is heard\nsoftly echoing among the students. Before the lab activity\nstarts, Ms. Corbin calls out the names of each lab group.\nRecently, she reconfigured them based on academic perfor-\nmance, behaviors, and gender. Each group has a designated\nleader assigned by the teacher and is typically the student\nwith a strong academic performance. The group recorder is\nselected by the group leader.\nStudents rearrange themselves into their laboratory\ngroups. Ms. Corbin distributes laboratory sheets to six groups\nof four students. She reads the first page of the laboratory\nsheet where lab purpose, procedures, and materials are listed.\nWhile Ms. Corbin reads the procedure section, she points to\nthe materials and equipment that the students will be using.\nThen, she assigns one student in the classroom to read out\nloud for the class the rest of the laboratory sheet.\nWhile students hold up their hands to volunteer to read it,\nshe selects Beril who does not have her hands up and is qui-\netly reading a novel. Beril reads the entire lab instruction step\nby step. When she finishes reading it, Ms. Corbin instructs\none student from each group to collect goggles and gloves,\nwhile another student gets test tubes, chemical substances,\nspatula, and pestle. Students assigned to obtain the experi-\nment materials move next to the bench where Ms. Corbin has\nlocated the equipment and the substances. At the bench, they\ntalk to each other about which equipment they will need,\nhow many test tubes they will use, and which substances\nthey will first use.\nToday's laboratory activity is composed of five mini\ninvestigations about physical and chemical changes. In one\ngroup, Julie as the designated group leader asks who will do\nwhich investigation. At that moment, each member looks at\nthe possibilities and self-selects an assignment. Julie domi-\nnates the group and assigns herself as a recorder even though\nAyar et al. 5\nTerri self-selects herself to be a recorder. Terri and other stu-\ndents in the group wordlessly acquiesce to Julie. As the\nleader Julie asks the group members' thoughts and ideas\nbefore she writes the group's findings. She puts forward her\nthoughts and ideas when other students do not share their\nideas and thoughts; the other members simply agree with no\ndiscussion. At the end of the laboratory sheet, Julie again\nprovides the answers for the group to write them down. The\ngroup agrees with her and accepts Julie's final statements\nwithout discussing their observations or conclusion from\neach investigation.\nWhile each group is busy conducting the experiments and\nidentifying the physical and chemical changes, Ms. Corbin\nstops by each group, checks what group members are doing,\nand asks them, \"What stage are you at?\" She continues to\nmonitor the groups, while some group members ask for help\nto answer a question about the procedures and their investi-\ngations. She provides guidance. As necessary, she answers\nthe questions directly. At other times, she responds with a\nquestion to allow them think and discuss in groups.\nWhen Ms. Corbin realizes that students completed the\nactivities on the first page of the laboratory sheet, she asks\nthem to continue on the second page where they will record\ntheir observations in a chart and explain whether the changes\nin matters are physical or chemical. Each group finishes\nexperimenting, recording observations, identifying physical\nand chemical changes, and answering questions on the labo-\nratory sheet. Ms. Corbin asks the groups to discuss similari-\nties and differences between the physical and chemical\nchanges in another worksheet. She picks Kevin to give an\nexample, and Kevin suggests that eroding is a physical\nchange. Another student, Rena, disagrees with Kevin's\nexample because she thinks that it is a chemical change. At\nthat moment, some students agree with Rena and some do\nnot. Ms. Corbin encourages the students to provide evidence\nand to explain why it is physical change or not. Disagreement\non that example lasts a while and then is resolved by Ms.\nCorbin. She concludes, \"I think that eroding is an example\nfor both physical and chemical changes.\" Ms. Corbin and her\nstudents continue discussing other examples regarding\nchemical and physical changes until the bell rings.\nFindings\nStudent Science Practices\nIn the seventh-grade science classroom, Ms. Corbin's nor-\nmative practices were to set the agenda and orchestrate both\nregular classroom and laboratory activities. As a knowledge\ntransmitter and a source of knowledge, she used the power of\nknowing and the authority to determine, plan, organize, and\nimplement the everyday activities of the classroom. In the\ninterviews, several students described the teacher's role as\nthe director and knower:\nMs. Corbin determined what activities we would do and why we\nwill do those. She determined them because almost everyone in\nthe class can participate in them and understand what's going\non. (Student 2)\nShe [The teacher] hands us worksheets. And we know she has\nmore knowledge and experience than us. (Student 1)\nMs. Corbin used a computer and a projector in the class-\nroom that gave her access to for Microsoft office program\napplications (e.g., word processing and Power Points) and\nthe Internet. She used these technologies to present knowl-\nedge and to implement instructional activities. For example,\nthe teacher used the projector to exhibit the picture of chro-\nmosomes to enable students to imagine and conceptualize\nhow and under what conditions people are born with Down's\nsyndrome. The projector was a tool for her to draw students'\nattention to the topic and concentrate on the picture dis-\nplayed. The computer and its accessories are technologies of\ndirection used by the teacher to monitor student's readiness\nto quizzes and exams as well as to disseminate ideas, con-\ncepts, and terms easily.\nIn other lessons, the computer and projector were used by\nstudents to share their projects with the classroom. Students\nhad projects to present over two semesters. Although some\ngroups preferred making a poster, some groups prepared\nPowerPoint presentations with animations and visual effects\nto draw their peer's attention. Again the computer and pro-\njector are being used as a technology of direction, this time\nby the students within the classroom. The technologies were\nused in similar ways by the classroom community to facili-\ntate teaching and repetition of scientific concepts as a recog-\nnized social practice of the classroom.\nIn addition, Ms. Corbin prepared handouts and used them\nto guide and support student learning. Handouts in-class\nactivities included worksheets, quiz sheets, and course notes.\nThese handouts pertained to knowledge presented in their\nscience textbook. These paper technologies reinforced the\nteacher's role of director and knower and rarely shifted those\nroles to the students. One student summarized this in her\ninterview:\nIn our class we usually get worksheets or lab experiments or\nsomething like that or either our teacher or book would provide\nthe correct answer or a correct possibility or any possibilities,\nbut in unknown answer--I wouldn't really expect that . . .\nAs illustrated in the second vignette, students were pro-\nvided with laboratory handouts. These handouts listed the\npurpose, the procedures, and the materials. The students\nwere also provided with laboratory materials and equipment\n(e.g., microscope, pH meters, gas pressure sensors, and bal-\nance) to conduct their scientific investigations and complete\ntheir lab assignments. These material resources were the\nshared repertoire in the classroom community where the\n6 SAGE Open\nstudents performed both in-class and lab activities to learn\nscientific concepts. They too reinforced the role of students\nas actors who follow the guidance of the director or teacher.\nMs. Corbin preferred using the Initiation\u00adResponse\u00ad\nEvaluation (I-R-E) and Initiation\u00adResponse\u00adFeedback (I-\nR-F) interactional sequences. That is, she preferred initiating\na question about a term, students responded to that question,\nand then she evaluated their response or provided feedback\n(Mortimer & Scott, 2003). She used these question\u00adanswer\nroutines between her and students to coordinate the regular\nclassroom activities as exemplified in the first vignette. For\nstudents, however, they responded to the I-R-E or I-R-F\nstrategy as another version of listen, receive knowledge, and\ntake notes.\nIn the second vignette, students are observed being more\nactively engaged with knowledge production through labora-\ntory activities to recall and verify knowledge. Students are\nalso asked to apply that knowledge and develop inquiry\nskills to complete the laboratory activity. Typically, the lab\nactivities were simple hands-on activities that the students\ncompleted by following the prescribed procedures (Chinn &\nMalhotra, 2002). Meanwhile, Ms. Corbin maintained her\nrole as a director by provided feedback, monitored their per-\nformance, and mentored them (Tabak & Baumgartner, 2004).\nIn this classroom, the students were expected to work in\nassigned groups and to accomplish their task in a collective\nmanner. Some students dominated the group's work to\naccomplish their normative laboratory practices. Other stu-\ndents took the responsibilities designated by their group\nleader mostly and rarely by their self-choice. As part of her\nnormative practices, Ms. Corbin intended to form diverse\nstudent groups in regard to sex, behavior, and academic per-\nformance every several weeks. She organized pair and small\ngroups to regulate the laboratory activities where students\nwere expected to work in groups. Ms. Corbin always moni-\ntored the students'group work as to whether they were work-\ning together or not. She encouraged them to work together\nfor the completion of the activities. Working together was a\ntacit and invisible norm during the laboratory activities that\nwas constantly reinforced by the teacher's verbal and non-\nverbal clues.\nDifferent students responded differently to the assigned\ngroups because of pre-existing relationships within the class-\nroom from several years of going to school together. One\nstudent explained the group's dynamics from a historical\nperspective:\n. . . We're a pretty hardworking class, although we know how to\nget on--on the teacher's bad sides. We've been doing that for\nyears though so--but you know, we can work well if uh . . .\nhmm, we're in the right groups. We all know each other pretty\nwell because we've been in this school for more than one year in\nmost cases. (Student 2)\nAnother student characterized the dynamics from a social\ngrouping perspective:\nThe ways the groups are made usually depend. If I were in a\ngroup with not my friends, then we probably would have been\nassigning stuff that each person brings, but when I'm with my\nfriends, we kind of just take the responsibility ourselves without\nassigning it. (Student 5)\nBy focusing on the normative practices and routine behav-\niors of the classroom, we see that community of practice is\ncentered on the teacher as a director. Whereas students'com-\nmunity of practice either follows the direction of the teacher\nor illustrates autonomy when assigned groups overlap with\nsocial groupings that exist outside of the classroom.\nThe Nature of the \"Participant Structures\" in the\nScience Classroom\nMs. Corbin established different modes of participation to\nsupport students' participation in their everyday activities:\n(a) individual mode, (b) pair mode, (c) small-group mode,\nand (d) whole-class mode.\nBy individual mode of participation, we refer to the inter-\nactions between a student and a teacher (Philips, 1972). In\nthis type of participation, all students worked individually\nunder Ms. Corbin's guidance on an assignment. Ms. Corbin\nacted as an authority figure, and checked and controlled the\nstudents' behaviors and attitudes to teach scientific topics.\nStudents were encouraged to ask questions if anything was\nnot clear to them. When the students had questions, they\ncalled on Ms. Corbin as the expert or authority who was\nresponsible to respond to their inquiries. This individual\nmode of participation defined the students as receiving\nPair mode of participation can be attributed to the interac-\ntions between two students under Ms. Corbin's guidance.\nStudents in pairs shared their understanding, experience,\nknowledge, competence, and responsibilities. In the mean-\ntime, Ms. Corbin was in the role of facilitating. When a pair\ngroup had a conflict or a disagreement, Ms. Corbin helped\nthem out through feedback. The pair mode of participation\noccurred as students were engaged with both the regular\nclassroom and laboratory activities. For example, when\ndesigning a solar oven model as a project work, Ms. Corbin\nset pairs who would decide their own best model to cook\nsomething. The students were encouraged to negotiate how\nto design a model, what kind of materials they would use,\nand how to use the model to conduct their investigations.\nWhile the students were the center of action and discussed\neach step to design the model by sharing their ideas, Ms.\nCorbin monitored each group, provided feedback, and\nchecked their performance. Students in pairs acted in a col-\nlaborative manner as they mutually communicated their\nideas with each other and shared with each other their knowl-\nedge and the experience that helped them accomplish their\nassignment. In addition, they were in symmetric interactions\nwhere no one dominated their conversation, which in turn\nAyar et al. 7\ndeveloped the sense of ownership of the model they designed\n(Oliveira, Sadler, & Suslak, 2007; Tabak & Baumgartner,\n2004). This pair mode of participation defined the students as\nacting, collaborating, and sharing individuals.\nSmall-group mode of participation is one in which stu-\ndents work in a small group with more distant teacher super-\nvision (Philips, 1972). In this type of participation, Ms.\nCorbin was in the role of mentoring each group and support-\ning their articulation of ideas among the students in each\ngroup (Tabak & Baumgartner, 2004). Ms. Corbin frequently\ninitiated the small-group mode of participation when the stu-\ndents frequently performed laboratory activities as illustrated\nin the second vignette. Given that the students were the cen-\nter of action, they were responsible for doing their own\ninvestigations. To accomplish their lab assignment, they\nwere provided with the opportunity to determine the division\nof labor in each group. Although they were not urged to be in\nthe pursuit of the unknown, they worked and completed lab\nassignment collectively, and negotiated their conflicts and\ndisagreements with regard to investigations, observations,\nand findings. In turn, their mutual negotiations led to trans-\nforming their disagreements into agreements. This small-\ngroup mode of participation defined the students as more\nacting, engaging, collaborating, and sharing individuals.\nWhole-class mode of participation can be attributed to the\nteacher-initiated whole-class interaction where the teacher\ndominates her social and epistemic authority to orchestrate\nthe classroom practices and maintain continuous science\nlearning (Turpen & Finkelstein, 2010). In the whole-class\nmode of participation, Ms. Corbin was the center of action;\ntherefore, she established asymmetric interactions with the\nstudents. She was in the role of leading conversations, trans-\nmitting knowledge to the students, and motivating the mar-\nginal students to engage in discussions through asking\nrhetorical and literal questions. In the meantime, many stu-\ndents voluntarily participated, listened to her, and rarely\nraised questions as shown in the first vignette. Ms. Corbin\npreferred to employ the I-R-F sequence to manage the whole-\nclass interactions. The I-R-F sequence motivated students to\nparticipate in a conversation and discuss scientific concepts.\nYet, the I-R-E sequence existed when students were engaged\nwith question\u00adanswer routine activities. This whole-class\nmode of participation defined the students as more receiving\nand less engaging individuals.\nDimensions of Communities of Practice in the\nScience Classroom\nOur study findings reveal practice, participation, and com-\nmunity in the science classroom, as dimensions of communi-\nties of practice. Practices that the students performed in the\nclassroom consisted of regular class and laboratory activities\nto become familiar with science subject-matter. Rarely, they\nwere provided with open-ended activities (e.g., designing a\nsolar oven model) to make connections to their daily life.\nParticipation structures that we observed were organized\nby the teacher depending on the nature of their normative\npractices. The individual mode of participation and the\nwhole-class mode of participation were to enhance the indi-\nvidualistic learning through the questions\u00adanswer routine\nworks (Lemke, 1990). The individual mode of participation\nrestricted the students to interact and communicate with the\nother classroom members because they were only in contact\nwith the teacher. The pair mode of participation and the\nsmall-group mode of participation provided students with\nthe opportunity to be the center of action, establish different\nroles, share responsibilities to perform their contextual prac-\ntices, and develop a collective understanding of a shared\npractice. In other words, they were given a chance to become\nmore active in a way that encourages them to move from\nbeing a peripheral participant to being a full participant\n(Wenger, 1998). In turn, this can allow identity transforma-\ntions as their participation level changes and they engage in\na shared practice.\nWe construe community with power relations, authority,\nand belonging. In this study, the seventh-grade students\naccepted and internalized that their teacher was the one who\nplans, organizes, and implements their classroom practices\nas well as initiates their common goals (e.g., particularly\nlearning and memorizing scientific concepts, having fun, and\nbeing successful in science exams) through her power and\nauthority as a component of classroom life (Pace &\nHemmings, 2007). Power relations between the teacher and\nthe students were stable. It was already given to the teacher\nwork with their close friends when they were formed in\ngroups because they had common histories and were aware\nof their good and bad sides. The teacher's epistemic and\nsocial authority played a role in configuring various student\ngroups in regard to their academic background, sex, and\nbehaviors. This was discouraging for students to have a feel-\ning of belonging to a group in a specific, and a classroom\ncommunity in general.\nDiscussion and Implications\nThis study has illustrated the normative practices and power\nrelations occurring in two teaching formats for science:\nI-R-E or I-R-F instructional sequences and small-group labo-\nratory activities share an epistemic authority that limits the\nparticipatory potential of both activities.\nIn the first vignette, the teacher guides and directs student\nlearning as she reinforces and introduces science concepts.\nShe controls learning activities in a directive manner that\nfacilitates one-on-one conversation between student and\nteacher and rarely between student and student. After the\nteacher places students into groups, the identified leader acts\nas a teacher and the group members participate in their nor-\nmal default role of learners. We see this in the student leader\nwho dominated her group's discussion, assigned roles to her\n8 SAGE Open\npeers, and offered answers to all questions to complete their\nlab investigations. Thus, the \"academic leader of the group\"\naccepts the responsibility and finishes their collective job to\nmaintain her status as leader. Meanwhile, the rest of the\ngroup maintain their normal role as learners and do not dis-\ncuss their observations or results with one another, which\nreinforces that science discourse is structured by I-R-E or\nI-R-F sequences. This is supported by studies of what occurs\nwhen scientists and students collaborate: The leading scien-\ntist typically takes the teacher's role in working with students\nLaboratory investigations in the classroom are a means\nfor students to conceptualize the subject-matter that is pre-\nsented during lectures: I-R-E or I-R-F. Lab activities are\ndesigned to give students the chance to learn independently\nor with peers. In the second vignette, we see the students\nreproducing I-R-F at the end of the lab activity rather than\ndiscussing among themselves. The classroom's default mode\nor established participatory structures shaped the community\nof practice and limited the development of practices that may\nhave encouraged discussion across groups.\nIn the second vignette, teacher authority was given to stu-\ndents via their assigned roles and responsibilities. The selec-\ntion of a student leader based on academic performance gave\nepistemic authority to only one student, while placing the\nremaining students in their habitual normative role as learn-\ners. The laboratory activity of Vignette 2 gave students\nresponsibility and created a division of labor that mimicked\nthe authority and normative practices of Vignette 1. Whereas\nthe teacher performs her role in an authoritative role, the stu-\ndent leaders perform theirs in an authoritarian manner. This\ndirectly challenges the idea that laboratory activities engage\nstudents with hands-on learning that enables them to under-\nstand and learn science concepts differently from a lecture or\nclass discussion. Our observation and comparison of two\ntypical activities in this science classroom ethnography\nthrough the lens of normative practices and participatory\nmodes illustrate the importance of describing the socio-cul-\ntural aspects of the school science classroom to understand\nnot only the individual practices of students and teachers but\nwhat their communities of practice are creating and repro-\nducing daily.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we drew on two vignettes to (a) reflect the\nnature of school science practices, (b) shed light on the inter-\naction and communication structures between students and\nthe teacher, (c) depict how the teacher organizes and man-\nages normative classroom practices for students to under-\nstand scientific concepts, and (d) identify the social dynamics\nthat hinder or trigger the formation of a community of prac-\ntice in the science classroom.\nThe students were engaged in regular classroom activities\n(e.g., completing worksheets and assignments through the\nteacher's knowledge, going over handouts and having mini\ndiscussions, and taking quizzes and exams). Research has\nshown how these \"regular classroom activities\" produce sta-\nble practices that reinforce the goal of higher exam scores\n(Zakharov, Carnoy, & Loyalka, 2014). During laboratory\nactivities designed to give students intimacy with scientific\nknowledge, concepts, terms, and natural phenomena, stu-\ndents were observed establishing social relationships pat-\nterned using I-R-F that defined their laboratory experiences.\nAlthough the teacher provided different participation modes\ndesigned to enhance student engagement in activities, social\nand epistemic authority were not redistributed or altered for\nactivities presumed to develop a norm based on collabora-\ntion. The power dynamics that created the student working\ngroups reproduced itself within the groups and affected how\nstudents worked together. What we observed was that labo-\nratory activities reproduced the epistemic authority of the\nI-R-F rather than creating collective cognitive responsibility\nwhere students have the independence to explore and to cre-\nate authentic science experiences.\nThus, barriers and triggers to a community of practice co-\nexist in the science classroom from the teacher's authority to\nworksheets and laboratory equipment. On one hand, we\nidentified that the teacher's institutionalized role, namely her\nepistemic and social authority, influenced students' actions,\nbehaviors, and learning activities. At times, this institutional\nrole was a trigger for community of practice in doing work-\nsheets or taking quizzes. However, it was also seen as a bar-\nrier to the formation of a community of practice in the\nlaboratory activities. The configuration of working groups\nbased on teacher authority worked as a barrier to developing\na collaborative community of practice for students to work\ncollectively as a group. On the other hand, these student\ngroups reinforced the role of the academically strong and\nweak in their participation in laboratory activity. Students\ncontinued to engage, collaborate, and share their ideas and\nthoughts with others in their established roles within I-R-F.\nTherefore, this study highlights the importance of the social\ncontext and dynamics operating within the science class-\nroom community of practice where practices can trigger or\nhinder an unintended norm to be reproduced and reinforced,\nregardless of intended norm.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
