    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBackground and aims Quitting smoking is the most potent way to reduce the health risks associated with smoking cig-\narettes, and public health objectives in the United States include dramatic increases in the proportion of smokers making a\nserious quit attempt eachyear. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has, since 2000, set as its Healthy\nPeople 2020 objective to encourage 80% of smokers to make a serious quit attempt per year. This study assessed the trend\nin quit attempts from 2009 to 2014. Design We examined the percentage of US smokers making a serious quit attempt\neach year from 2009 to 2014 from the repeating cross-sectional National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).\nSetting United States. Participants The number of qualifying respondents per year ranged from 5748 in 2010 to\nto have made a serious quit attempt if they were either current smokers who reported that they stopped smoking for more\nthan 1 day in the past 12 months because they were trying to quit smoking, or reported being former smokers (smoked\n100+ cigarettes life-time, but now not smoking) who quit in the past year. Findings Analyses of trends from 2009 to\nserious quit attempt rate was 55.0%. These rates are still below the Healthy People 2020 objective of 80% of smokers mak-\ning a serious quit attempt per year.\n",

Accordingly, efforts to re-\nduce its toll remain public health and public policy priori-\nties [1]. Long-established and accepted approaches to\nreduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality include ef-\nforts to prevent uptake by youth, reduce exposure to smoke\namong non-smokers and encourage and support quit at-\ntempts among current smokers. Promoting quitting\namong current smokers has the greatest near-term effect\non morbidity and mortality, as current smokers are subject\nto near-term harms [2,3].\nTotal smoking cessation in a population is the product\nof the proportion of smokers making a quit attempt\nmultiplied by their success rate [4,5]. As a result, public\nhealth programs have focused both on boosting quit at-\ntempts and improving their success rate. Zhu et al. [6]\nand Aveyard & Raw (2012) [7] have noted that we have\nhad only modest success at increasing quit attempts, both\nin the United States and globally. The US Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention (CDC) has, since 2000, set\nas its Healthy People objective to encourage 80% of\nsmokers to make a serious quit attempt per year [8], yet\nTo monitor progress on this goal, we examined esti-\nmates of past-year quit attempts to evaluate recent trends.\nMETHODS\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS) data.

This analysis is based on\nadult (18+ years of age; younger respondents were not\nasked questions about smoking) current (some days and\nevery day) smokers and former smokers who had quit in\nthe past year. Respondents whose current smoking status\nwas unknown were excluded from the analyses. The yearly\ning respondents (smokers and ex-smokers) per year\n(total = 40362 respondents), and were weighted to reflect\nthe US adult population.\nA serious quit attempt was defined following the meth-\nNHIS data (2011). Respondents were deemed to have\nmade a serious quit attempt if they were either current\nsmokers who reported that they stopped smoking for more\nthan 1 day in the past 12 months because they were trying\nto quit smoking, or reported being former smokers (smoked\n100+ cigarettes life-time, but now not smoking) who had\nquit in the past year.\nLogistic regression models were used to assess both lin-\near and quadratic trends in serious quit attempts by year.\nThe quadratic model included both linear and quadratic\nterms. No higher-order models were considered.\nDue to the complex NHIS sample design, analyses were\nconducted using SAS-Callable SUDAAN version 11.0.1\nand SAS version 9.4.\nRESULTS\nSerious quit attempt rates by year are shown in Table 1.\nlinear increase in serious quit attempts [odds ratio\nperiod, the proportion of serious quit attempts that ended\nin abstinence increased slightly, from 21.2% of all serious\nhowever, this increase is not significant (linear trend\nFig. 1, the proportion of smokers making a serious quit at-\ncounts for the quadratic trend.\nDISCUSSION\nThe proportion of smokers making a serious quit attempt\n1Estimates reported for the full 2009\u00ad14 analysis were generated using a logistic regression model including both linear and quadratic terms for year.

This is an encourag-\ning finding, especially as the CDC reported on state-level\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) quit\nattempt data showing no change between 2011 and\ncer Action Network to observe that: `(a)ttempts to quit\nusing cigarettes by adults stalled between 2011 and\nThe NHIS data do not themselves explain why quit at-\ntempts may have increased during this period. Many fac-\ntors can affect quit attempts [5], including substantial\nincreases in price and taxation [13], but as noted in the In-\ntroduction the last substantial national increase in ciga-\nrette prices was during the first half of 2009, limiting\nchanges in price as a simple explanation for the phenome-\nnon. The CDC Tips from Former Smokers (TIPS) campaign\nstarted in the first half of 2012, and pre\u00adpost analyses of\npopulation cohorts has demonstrated that TIPS increases\nAnother hypothesized influence on quit attempts is the\nawareness and use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).\nSome have expressed concern that the use of e-cigarettes,\nor even just awareness of e-cigarettes, might reduce quit at-\ntempts [18,19], suggesting that quitting activity would de-\ncline as e-cigarette awareness and use increase. However,\nthese data show that quitting activity has been increasing\neven as awareness and use of e-cigarettes has been increas-\ning steeply [20\u00ad22], which is not consistent with the hy-\npothesis that e-cigarette awareness and use is suppressing\nquit attempts.\nIn any case, the data show that the proportion of cur-\nrent smokers making serious quit attempts has been on\nthe upswing since 2012, and suggest that all efforts should\nbe made to maintain this momentum, and move towards\nof smokers make quit attempts each year.\nDeclaration of interests\nIn the past 3 years Pinney Associates has provided ser-\nvices for a range of companies, including\nGlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare on their stop-\nsmoking medications (Nicorette and NicoDerm CQ in\nthe United States), for NJOY, Inc., a developer and mar-\nketer of electronic nicotine delivery systems, and since\nFebruary 2015 for Reynolds American, Inc.
