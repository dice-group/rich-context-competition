Since 1993, both fatal and non-fatal\nfirearm related GSW injury rates have declined\nsubstantially, possibly due to improved eco-\nnomic conditions, the aging of the population,\nand changes in legislation, sentencing, and law\nenforcement practices.1\u00ad3 However, GSWs re-\nmain an important public health problem.\nThey were the second leading cause of injury\nIn addition, GSWs contributed an estimated\nemergency departments in the United States in\n1997, about half of which required hospitaliza-\ntion.3 4 Although suicides and homicides ac-\ncount for over 96% of all gunshot related\ndeaths, about 20% of gunshot related injuries\ntreated in hospital emergency departments in\nthe United States are unintentional.4\u00ad7\nPreventable firearm related injuries other\nthan GSWs (subsequently referred to as \"non-\nGSWs\") are also a public health concern. They\noccur in a variety of circumstances, including\nfights, arguments, routine gun handling (for\nexample, transporting, cleaning, repairing),\nrecreational gun use, and leisure time activities.\nFindings from one study of violence related\ninjuries suggested that one out of five violence\nrelated firearm injuries treated in American\nhospital emergency departments is associated\nwith being struck by a gun.8 Only minimal data\non unintentional non-GSWs have been re-\nported in selected populations, such as those\noccurring during hunting or target shooting,\ncleaning and repairing firearms, playing with a\ngun, or gun malfunction and mishandling.7 9\u00ad18\nThese studies focused mainly on the circum-\nstances of unintentional firearm related injuries\nand fatalities, most involving GSWs, and none\ncharacterize non-fatal, non-GSWs in the con-\ntext of all firearm related injuries.\nIn this study, we examine non-fatal, non-\nGSWs treated in hospital emergency depart-\nments in the United States. National estimates\nare presented by demographic characteristics\nof the injured person, type and location of\nwounds, hospitalization status, activity at the\ntime of injury, mechanism of injury, and other\ncircumstances of the injury incident. Firearm\nrelated injuries were defined as those associ-\nated with guns that use a powder charge to fire\na projectile. A non-GSW was defined as physi-\ncal injury (bodily harm), self inflicted or\ninflicted by another person, occurring (1) from\nbeing struck by a firearm or objects dislodged\nduring discharge of a firearm, or (2) while\nevading gunfire; for example, fracture of ankle\nfrom falling while running from gunfire. These\ninjuries can be violence related (for example,\nfractures from being purposely struck by a gun)\nor unintentional (for example, lacerations from\ngun recoil during recreational use). Fatal\nfirearm related injuries are not included in this\nstudy because deaths associated with non-\nGSWs cannot be identified in mortality data.\nMethods\nThese data were from the National Electronic\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) operated\nby the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nNEISS consisted of a stratified probability\nDivision of Adult and\nCommunity Health,\nNational Center for\nChronic Disease\nPrevention and Health\nPromotion, Centers\nfor Disease Control\nand Prevention,\nAtlanta, Georgia, USA\nJ M Hootman\nOYce of Statistics and\nProgramming,\nNational Center for\nInjury Prevention and\nControl, Centers for\nDisease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta,\nGeorgia, USA\nJ L Annest\nG W Ryan\nDivision of Violence\nPrevention, National\nCenter for Injury\nPrevention and\nControl, Centers for\nDisease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta,\nGeorgia, USA\nJ A Mercy\nMedical College of\nWisconsin, Milwaukee,\nWisconsin, USA\nS W Hargarten\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Jennifer M Hootman,\nDivision of Adult and\nCommunity Health (K45)\nNational Center for Chronic\nDisease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion, Centers\nfor Disease Control and\nHighway NE, Atlanta, GA\n(tzh7@cdc.gov)\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nemergency service and at least six beds. These\nhospitals are categorized in four strata--small,\nmedium, large, and very large--based on the\nannual number of emergency department\nvisits. Both rural and urban hospitals in all\ngeographic regions are represented. To obtain\nnational estimates, each firearm related case\nwas assigned a sample weight based on the\ninverse of the probability of selection. National\nestimates were then computed by summing the\nsample weights within the population group or\ncharacteristic of interest. The sampling frame,\ndata collection protocol, and sensitivity of\nNEISS for identifying firearm related injuries\nThis study primarily focuses on non-fatal,\nnon-GSW cases initially treated in NEISS hos-\npital emergency departments between 1 Janu-\nassociated with BB, pellet, and other air guns\nwere excluded. Patients discharged alive from\nthe NEISS hospital emergency department\nwere defined as having non-fatal injuries; this\ndefinition is supported by previous studies that\nsuggest most firearm related deaths occur\nbefore hospitalization.5\nAt each NEISS hospital, trained coders\nreviewed hospital emergency department\nrecords, emergency department logs, and\ntrauma registries to identify all firearm related\ninjuries.21\u00ad23 Coders then abstracted data on the\nnature of the injury, characteristics of the\ninjured patient, and circumstances of the inci-\ndent. Data were obtained on age, sex, and race,\nprimary body part aVected, diagnosis, disposi-\ntion at discharge from the emergency depart-\nment, locale where injured, type of firearm\nused, and person causing the injury. The coder\nprovided a short narrative about the injury\nevent as described in the medical record.\nnon-fatal, non-GSW cases were treated in\nNEISS hospital emergency departments.\nAmong these cases, we excluded 361 that\noccurred during military training (for example,\ninjured during military activities, Reserved\nOYcers' Training Corps, and rifle corps train-\ning). Most of the military related cases were\ntreated at the three military hospitals in\nNEISS. Military training related injuries were\nexcluded because military personnel have a\nmuch greater exposure to firearms during\ntraining subjecting them to higher risk than the\ngeneral public. Non-military training related\ncases (for example, assaults) treated at military\nhospitals were included. Two additional cases\nwere excluded because patients sustained both\nGSWs and non-GSWs. National estimates\nwere computed using weighted data for the\ntreated in NEISS hospital emergency depart-\nments.\nWe constructed two additional variables--\nmechanism of injury and activity at time of\ninjury--for this study. A coding scheme (avail-\nable upon request) was developed to categorize\ncases by mechanism of injury and activity at\ntime of injury using information in the\nnarratives. The coding procedures were pilot\ntested on an independent sample of NEISS\nnon-GSW cases. Each case was assigned a\nmechanism of injury and activity code by one\nresearcher. Then, using the protocol, a second\nresearcher systematically reviewed all narra-\ntives and assigned codes to corroborate the\nclassification. Any discrepancies were dis-\ncussed and the final decision agreed upon by\nboth researchers.\nMechanism-of-injury categories were mutu-\nally exclusive and reflected how the person was\ninjured. The coding scheme was modeled after\nguidelines to assign the International Classifi-\ncation of Diseases,9th Revision,Clinical Modifica-\ntion (ICD-9-CM) external causes of injury\ncodes (E codes) as well as the \"recommended\nframework for presenting injury mortality\ndata\".24 25 If more than one mechanism was\nlisted, the mechanism most consistent with the\nlisted diagnosis and type of injury was coded.\nFor instance, injuries resulting from being\nstruck by or striking against a stationary or\nmoving object included falling on a gun if the\ngun itself caused the injury. Injuries coded into\nthe struck by/against category exclude those\nsustained by falling or stumbling while carrying\na firearm, or by being struck by an explosive\nFigure 1 National estimates of non-fatal firearm injuries treated in hospital emergency departments, by type and intent of\nTotal non-fatal firearm injuries\nGunshot wounds\nUnintentional\nViolence related\nUndetermined\nUnintentional\nViolence related\nAssault\nSuicide\nattempt\nLegal\ninter-\nvention\nAssault\nSuicide\nattempt\nLegal\ninter-\nvention\nUndetermined\nOther gun related injuries\nNational estimates of non-fatal firearm related injuries 269\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nblast.

The rate for males was 4.3 times that for\nfemales. This diVerence was consistent for\nunintentional injuries and assaults.

The majority of injuries\ntreated were lacerations. However, lacerations\naccounted for a higher percentage of uninten-\ntional than assault related injuries (63% v 49%,\nsions accounted for a higher percentage of\nassault related than unintentional injuries\nGSWs were severe enough to require hospitali-\nzation, of which 71% involved the head and\nneck region. The locale where the injury\noccurred was determined for only about half of\nthe cases, most occurring in or around the\nhome. The type of firearm used was unknown\nin more than a third of the cases; of the known\nfirearm types, 34.5% were handguns. More\nthan 60% of the unintentional injuries were\nassociated with, or involved rifles and shotguns,\nwhile half of assault related injuries were asso-\nciated with or involved handguns. The majority\nof unintentional injuries were self inflicted. The\nperson causing the injury could not be\ndetermined in 45% of assault related cases; in\ncases with known perpetrators, injuries in-\nflicted by a stranger was the most common.\nThe activity at time of injury and mechanism\nof injury are described in table 3. Activity was\ndetermined for over 90% of unintentional\ninjury cases but only for about 25% of assault\nrelated cases. More than half of unintentional\ninjuries occurred during cleaning, repairing,\nloading/unloading, or transporting a firearm\nand an additional one fourth occurred during\nrecreational activities, such as hunting and tar-\nget shooting. For those assault related cases\nwith known activity, about 20% occurred while\nthe victim was engaged in vital, travel, or leisure\nactivities. For example, some were inadvert-\nently caught in the line of gunfire and were\nstruck by ricocheting debris or broken glass;\nothers fell down while attempting to evade\ngunfire.\nThe mechanism of injury was determined in\nmost cases. For assaults, the predominant\nmechanism was being struck by a moving gun,\nfrequently called a pistol whipping (82.5%;\nmost common mechanism was gun recoil\npiercing, crushing, and pinching injuries asso-\nciated with the slide or trigger mechanism or\nother gun part. Six per cent of unintentional\ninjuries resulted from mechanical force related\nto an explosion of gun parts. Other uninten-\ntional injuries included powder burns, burns\nfrom contact with hot shell casings, auditory\ntrauma from excessive noise exposure, and falls\nwhile carrying a firearm.\npersons with recreational non-GSWs were\ntreated in hospital emergency departments in\nthe United States (table 4). Persons treated for\nthese injuries were primarily male and over 15\nyears of age. Nearly two thirds of the injuries\nwere to the head, face, neck and eye, and most\nof the others were to the extremities. Rifles and\nshotguns accounted for nearly two thirds of\nthese injuries. Recreational non-GSWs were\nprimarily associated with hunting (55.2%;\n3043 injuries). Almost half of the recreational\ninjuries (3209 injuries) were caused by gun\nrecoil, and nearly eight out of 10 occurred dur-\ning the fall and winter.\nTable 3 National estimates of non-fatal firearm related injuries* other than gunshot\nwounds treated in hospital emergency departments, by activity at time of injury, injury\nCharacteristic\nTotal\nNo (%)\nIntent of injury\nUnintentional\nNo (%)\nAssault\nNo (%)\nActivity at time of injury\nMechanism of injury\nStruck by or against\nCut/pierce/crush/pinch\n*Excludes injuries sustained during military training.\nRoutine gun use includes cleaning, repairing, loading/unloading or transporting a firearm; vital\nactivities include eating and sleeping.\nThese estimates may be unstable due to low sample size (less than 25 sample cases) and/or a\ncoeYcient of variation >28%.\n\u00a7Percentages may not sum to 100.0 due to rounding.\nTable 4 National estimates of civilian non-fatal firearm\nrelated injuries* other than gunshot wounds occurring\nduring recreational activities and treated in hospital\nemergency departments, by selected characteristics: United\nCharacteristic No (%)\nSex\nAge\nPrimary body part aVected\nFirearm type\nActivity at time of injury\nMechanism of injury\nSeason\n*Excludes injuries sustained during military training.\nThese estimates may be unstable due to low sample size (less\nthan 25 sample cases) and/or a coeYcient of variation >28%.\nSeason is defined as fall (21 September to 20 December), win-\n\u00a7Percentages may not sum to 100.0 due to rounding.\nNational estimates of non-fatal firearm related injuries 271\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this report provides the first\nnational estimates of non-fatal, non-GSWs\ntreated in hospital emergency departments\npertaining to non-military, civilian life. During\nwere treated in American emergency depart-\nments annually. During this same period, an\neach year in the same hospitals. In addition, an\nshow that non-fatal, non-GSWs contribute\nmarkedly to the total numbers of firearm\nrelated injuries in the United States each year.\nPopulation subgroups at highest risk for sus-\ntaining non-fatal, non-GSWs are very similar\nto those at highest risk for fatal and non-fatal\nGSWs injuries. The non-fatal and fatal firearm\nrelated injury rates for males is about six to\nseven times higher than that for females.2\u00ad8 Our\nresults show that the rate of non-fatal,\nnon-GSWs for males was more than four times\nthat for females. The age distribution for non-\nfatal, non-GSWs also follows the distribution\nof fatal and non-fatal GSWs. People aged\n15\u00ad34 years account for the largest number of\nfirearm related injuries and deaths, over 70% of\nIn our study, 60% of the non-fatal, non-GSWs\nRegarding racial and ethnic disparity, our\nresults suggest that the racial disparity among\nnon-fatal and fatal GSW injuries extends to\nnon-fatal, non-GSWs injuries. The rate of\nnon-fatal, non-GSWs among black people was\napproximately three times the rate for non-\nHispanic whites. In 1996, the fatal firearm\nrelated injury rate for the black population was\n2.7 times that of the white population.4 Annest\net al reported that the non-fatal GSW rate\namong blacks was over nine times the rate\namong non-Hispanic whites and three times\nthe rate among Hispanics.5 Our estimates show\nthat among assault related non-GSW injuries\nfor blacks, the rate was eight times the rate for\nnon-Hispanic whites.\nImplications for prevention\nIn this study, national estimates indicate that\n97% of non-fatal, non-GSWs treated in hospi-\ntal emergency departments in the United\nStates during the study period were not hospi-\ntalized. However, non-GSWs, such as struck by\na gun in the head, that are not severe enough to\nrequire hospitalization may result in perma-\nnent or residual disability.26 27 Mild traumatic\nbrain injuries may lead to long term, potentially\npermanent residual symptoms such as head-\naches, irritability, anxiety, dizziness, fatigue,\nimpaired concentration, memory loss, and\ninformation processing deficits.28\u00ad35 Almost\ntreated in hospital emergency departments\nover the four year study period. Sixty seven per\ncent of these injuries were unintentional, most\nof which occurred during routine gun handling\narm related eye injuries, including corneal\nabrasions, lacerations, orbital lacerations, and\nenucleation are often severe enough to require\nsurgery and may result in permanent visual\nprevented through proper use of safety glasses\nand proper gun handling techniques. Even\nthough head, face, and eye injuries may result\nin significant disability, no mechanism cur-\nrently exists to monitor firearm related injury\ndisability nationally.40\nRecreational gun users need to understand\ntheir risk of non-GSWs during gun use.\nNon-GSWs severe enough to require emer-\ngency medical attention can occur, including\nlacerations, contusions/abrasions, and frac-\ntures. Almost 92% of unintentional non-fatal,\nnon-GSWs were self inflicted. A majority\n(55%) of unintentional non-fatal, non-GSWs\noccurred during activities such as cleaning,\nrepairing, and handling firearms. These activi-\nties have also been associated with uninten-\ntional GSWs.9 Twenty five per cent of an\nestimated 6871 unintentional injuries occurred\nduring recreational gun use, including hunting\ncases where the type of firearm was known,\nmost frequent type of firearm responsible for\nunintentional recreational injuries. This find-\ning is consistent with other reports of hunting\nrelated injuries and deaths.9 17\nSelf inflicted recreational firearm injuries\nhave high potential for prevention. Gun safety\nand firearm education programs should be\ndirected towards recreational gun users, in-\ncluding hunters and target shooters. In this\nstudy, just over three quarters of recreational\nnon-GSWs occurred during the fall. Emphasiz-\ning firearm safety messages during the late\nsummer and early fall may remind hunters and\ntarget shooters to be cautious when engaging in\ngun related activities.\nAmong recreational non-GSWs, 43% were\ncaused by gun recoil. Instructing novice gun\nusers in the proper positioning of the gun stock\non the shoulder can help to control the power-\nful \"kickback\" associated with discharge of a\nfirearm thereby limiting recoil related injuries.\nImproving firearm design, such as incorporat-\ning cushioned gun stocks or padded shoulder\nholsters, may also help reduce recoil related\ninjuries. Designing rifle scopes with padded\nand rounded edges could decrease chance of\nlacerations around the eye.\nLIMITATIONS\nWe estimated that 7630 persons purposely\nstruck by a gun were treated in American hos-\npital emergency departments annually. This\nby Rand in a study of all intentional injuries in\nbe explained by two factors. First, his estimate\nof being struck by a gun has a large sampling\nerror due to the small numbers of cases\nreported in the study conducted at one third of\nthe 91 NEISS hospitals. Second, it is possible\nthat his coding scheme was more inclusive in\ndefining struck by a gun. Both studies,\n272 Hootman, Annest, Mercy, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nhowever, indicate that those involved in policy\ndecisions and planning programs for gun\nrelated violence prevention should be informed\nnot only about GSWs but also about the extent\nof injuries from being struck by a gun.\nNEISS is only appropriate for calculating\nnational estimates of firearm related injuries\nand cannot be used to examine associations\nwith geographic location and urbanization.\nAlso, NEISS data on injury related circum-\nstances are abstracted from emergency depart-\nment records. Since medical personnel prima-\nrily are focused on treating the patient, medical\nrecords often lack suYcient information to\ndescribe injury related circumstances. For\ninstance, guns are used in about 30% of\nweapon related assaults.41 We were only able to\nclassify the context (for example, robbery, bur-\nglary, sexual assault) in 38.3% of assaults. Also,\nwe had diYculty identifying the locale of the\nassault related incident (48% unknown), the\ntype of firearm (34% unknown), the victim-\noVender relationship (45% unknown) and\nactivity at the time of injury (74% unknown).\nTo improve reporting of these characteristics,\nNEISS data could be linked to other data\nsources. Law enforcement and medical\nexaminer/coroner reports have been identified\nas providing the most comprehensive incident\ninformation on firearm fatalities; law enforce-\nment and crime lab reports could be a potential\ninformation source for investigating non-fatal\nNEISS collects data on firearm related inju-\nries treated in hospital emergency depart-\nments. As a result, this report may underesti-\nmate the number of non-fatal, non-GSWs\nbecause common types of non-GSWs, such as\ncontusions, lacerations and burns, may have\nbeen treated in medical facilities other than\nhospital emergency departments or may not\nhave required treatment by a medical profes-\nsional. NEISS does provide a sensitive estimate\nof the number of non-fatal firearm injuries.19\nAn evaluation of NEISS found that hospital\ncoders correctly identified 92.4% of GSWs\ntreated in a random sample of NEISS hospital\nemergency departments.18 Although non-\nGSWs were not included in that evaluation\nstudy, coders were instructed to report all gun\nrelated incidents described in the emergency\ndepartment record. We have no reason to sus-\npect NEISS is any less sensitive for non-GSWs.\nIn summary, non-fatal, non-GSWs make an\nimportant contribution to the overall public\nhealth burden of fatal and non-fatal firearm\nrelated injuries in the United States and aVect\nblacks disproportionately. Over half (58%) of\nsuch injuries were violence related. Injuries\nfrom being purposely struck by a gun should be\nconsidered when developing gun violence pre-\nvention programs at national, state, and local\nlevels. Most of the remaining non-fatal, non-\nGSWs were unintentional (41.4%), which were\npredominantly self inflicted (92%) and pre-\nventable. Further research is needed to identify\nand characterize gun users at greatest risk of\nsustaining these types of injuries and to exam-\nine associations between injury events and fire-\narm design and safety features. EVorts should\nbe made in state and local jurisdictions to\ndesign eVective prevention strategies and to\nfacilitate the availability of proper training and\neducation in gun handling and gun safety prac-\ntices for all gun owners and users to decrease\nthe risk of injury.\nWe would like to thank Mr Art McDonald, director, and Ms\nEileen Kessler, statistician and project oYcer, Division of Haz-\nard and Injury Data Systems, and other staV of the United\nStates Consumer Product Safety Commission for their\nassistance in providing surveillance data on non-fatal firearm\nrelated injuries using the NEISS.

Characteris-\nMillion Mom March\nIn May approximately 750 000 moms (and many dads and others) marched to Washington to\npress for sensible gun laws in the US. This was an impressive event and in spite of some trivial\ncounter demonstrations (\"I am here to protect my God-given right to carry a gun\", said one\nopponent), may well have succeeded in getting the message across to the US Congress that the\ntime for fundamental changes had come.\nRational research spending?\nLast year, an important report appeared in a leading international journal demonstrating that\n\"The amount of . . . funding for research on a disease is associated with the burden of the dis-\nease; however, diVerent measures of the burden . . . may yield diVerent conclusions about the\nappropriateness of disease-specific funding levels\". Indeed, they do. An inspection of the data\nreveals that injury is perhaps the most underfunded of all and that various, \"popular\"\ndiseases--for example, AIDS, breast cancer, diabetes, and dementia are clearly over-funded (N\nEditor's note: My apologies if I previously brought this report to our readers' attention.\n\"Accident\" again!\nIn a book about an American couple (Native Speaker, by Chang-Rae Lee), whose son was\nfatally injured, the author writes this bit of dialogue: \"It was a terrible accident\". The other\nretorts, \"An accident? . . .. How can you say it was an accident? We haven't treated it like one.\nNot for a second. Look at us, Sweetie, can't you see, when your baby dies it's never an acci-\ndent. I don't care if a truck hit him or he crawled out a window or he put a live wire in his\nmouth, it was not an accident. And that's a word you and I have no business using\" (p 120).\nEditor's note: Thanks to Elisa Braver for bringing this to my attention.\nPro-car, antipedestrian rhetoric in the UK\nA piece appeared in the Times (London) last fall that I dismissed after first reading it because\nI assumed it was tongue-in-cheek, facetious. I then concluded that the writer, Jonathan\nMeades, was perfectly serious. His extended tirade against the safety of pedestrians and pref-\nerence for protecting the needs of motorists is summed up well by the following opening\nquotes: \"Our cities are being killed by pedestrian zones which benefit only tourists and crimi-\nnals\". \"If God had meant us to walk he wouldn't have allowed us to invent the wheel\". I hesi-\ntated to report this, but think we need to appreciate what we are up against in our eVorts to\nprevent pedestrian injuries.\nAsbestos-containing crayons\nHealth Canada is inspecting crayons for asbestos after tests in the US found small amounts of\nthis carcinogen in three brands, including the most popular. Although the manufacturer dis-\nputes the findings, Health Canada will conduct its own tests as a \"precautionary\" measure.\n274 Hootman, Annest, Mercy, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nInj Prev\nJ M Hootman, J L Annest, J A Mercy, et al.\ninjuries other than gunshot wounds\nNational estimates of non-fatal firearm related\nhttp://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/268.full.html\nUpdated information and services can be found at:\nThese include:\nReferences\nhttp://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/268.full.html#related-urls\nArticle cited in:\nhttp://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/268.full.html#ref-list-1\nThis article cites 34 articles, 2 of which can be accessed free at:\nservice\nEmail alerting\nbox at the top right corner of the online article.\nReceive free email alerts when new articles cite this article.
