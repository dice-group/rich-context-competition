Typi-\ncally, QE has been accompanied by a special type of forward guidance (FG) where\ncentral banks provide (additional) stimulus by communicating that policy rates\nwill be kept constant for an extended period of time. Hence, there are two policies\ninfluencing the economy at the same time.\nMost studies that evaluate the macroeconomic effects of QE programmes \u00ad such\nas the Federal Reserve's large scale asset purchase programmes (LSAPs) or the\nEurosystem's public sector purchase programme (PSPP) \u00ad in tandem with FG\nprovide only point estimates of these effects (see, inter alia, Gertler and Karadi,\nuhl,\nOne potential reason for this observation is the two-step-approach that is usually\ntaken in the literature. In a first step, a model capable of generating real effects of\nQE and with a standard feedback rule for the policy rate is estimated (typically\nvia Bayesian estimation of the underlying DSGE model). In a second step, given\nthese estimates for the structural parameters, scenario analyses of QE in tandem\nwith FG \u00ad technically implemented by an anticipated interest rate peg \u00ad are carried\nout.1 The uncertainty surrounding the parameter estimates is usually neglected\ngoing from the first to the second step, as standard software tools to illustrate\nparameter uncertainty in such scenario analyses are not readily available.2\n1In the following, we use the terms FG and anticipated interest rate peg interchangeably.\n2There are three possible sources of uncertainty in this type of analysis. First, across model\nuncertainty \u00ad implying that the choice of the model for evaluating QE has an impact on the\nIn this paper, we provide an easy-to-implement way to analyse parameter uncer-\ntainty for scenario analyses involving QE in tandem with FG. In particular, after\nestimating parameters of (a linear version of) a model with Bayesian methods,\nwe conduct prior and posterior predictive analysis to use the information about\nthe parameter estimation obtained in the first step for the subsequent policy sce-\nnario analysis in the second step. We thus follow Leeper, Traum and Walker\nasses specific quantitative properties of DSGE models. These authors implement\npredictive analysis for linearised models, which are solved and simulated using\nstandard (first-order) perturbation techniques. We show that it is possible to ex-\nploit this technique in order to describe parameter uncertainty in the evaluation\nof QE accompanied by FG. The scenario analysis of QE in tandem with FG in our\ncase is based on a non-linear DSGE model.\nThe model we use for our analysis is the one in Carlstrom et al. (2017) (henceforth\nCFP). We estimate the model with European data and subsequently simulate\ntime paths for inflation in response to the launch of a QE programme for four\ndifferent policy scenarios: In the first scenario, a QE programme that mimics\nthe Eurosystem's PSPP affects the economy. In the second, third, and fourth\nscenario, the same QE programme again affects the economy but is additionally\naccompanied by one, two, and three years of FG, respectively. Our simulated time\nsimulation results \u00ad which is often illustrated by a simple comparison of median estimates of a\nlarge number of different studies (see, for instance, the meta-studies provided by International\nMonetary Fund, 2013; Deutsche Bundesbank, 2016). Second, within model uncertainty (i.e.\nparameter uncertainty) implying that uncertainty about estimates for the structural parameters\nof the underlying model will also translate into uncertainty about the estimated macroeconomic\neffects for a given purchase programme (the case we deal with in this paper). Third, data\nuncertainty (i.e. uncertainty about the information content present in collected data).\npaths imply a distribution of the inflation response to a QE programme which\nhighlights the relevance of parameter uncertainty in the assessment of QE. The\nprior-predictive analysis produces distributions for inflation based on the prior\ndistributions of the estimated model parameters, while the posterior-predictive\nanalysis is based on the distributions of the estimated parameters after having\nconfronted the model with the data. This allows us to assess what effect on the\ndistribution of the inflation response the data assign to the PSPP and FG within\nour model framework. It is easily possible to conduct the same type of analysis\nalso with respect to other macroeconomic variables. We confine ourselves to the\nanalysis of the inflation effects, though, to keep the analysis focused.\nIn principle, there are other methods of illustrating uncertainty in the evaluation of\nQE programmes. However, they are not applicable to the scenario we have in mind,\nnamely the evaluation of a QE programme accompanied by FG, implemented as\nan anticipated interest rate peg. For example, Bayesian impulse response func-\ntions principally allow for an evaluation of parameter uncertainty when analysing\nQE (at least if the QE shock is part of the estimation), but they are not readily\navailable if there is a temporary anticipated interest rate peg. Another example\nis the computation of conditional forecasts which principally allows for the illus-\ntration of uncertainty in the analysis of QE in combination with an interest rate\npeg. This method, however, involves implementing the peg by finding a series of\nshocks that imply a pre-specified path for the interest rate (based on the state\nspace solution of the underlying DSGE model). These shocks are by definition\nunexpected, that is, agents are not able to anticipate the temporary interest rate\npeg \u00ad which contradicts the very idea of FG. If agents are supposed to anticipate\nthe temporary nominal interest rate peg, this necessitates implementing the peg\nvia anticipated (or news) shocks as in K\u00a8\nuhl (2016) or solving and simulating the\nmodel by, for instance, assuming perfect foresight as in Sahuc (2016), neither of\nwhom considers parameter uncertainty.\nIn this paper, we take the perfect foresight approach to implement the anticipated\ntemporary interest rate peg and contribute to the literature by illustrating param-\neter uncertainty employing prior and posterior predictive analysis, and identifying\nthe individual contributions of the different parameters to this uncertainty. We find\nthat the uncertainty about the effects of the PSPP is considerable and amplified\nwhen the PSPP is accompanied by FG. The Calvo parameters \u00ad which govern the\nprobability, in a given period, of being able to reset prices and wages \u00ad have, for a\ngiven length of FG, the biggest influence in determining the uncertainty about the\ninflation effects of a QE shock. The estimated financial friction parameter \u00ad which\nis of crucial importance in the model for QE to have real effects (see Carlstrom\net al., 2017) \u00ad is of less importance regarding parameter uncertainty.\nWe organise our paper as follows. The next section presents the model. Section 3\nprovides details of the model's estimation and calibration. Section 4 describes how\nQE and FG are implemented. Section 5 describes the prior-posterior predictive\nanalysis we conduct and shows the resulting simulations of inflation for our different\npolicy scenarios. It also contains an analysis about which parameters are most\nimportant for our results. Section 6 concludes.\nIn the standard New Keynesian model, asset purchases are neutral (so-called Wal-\nlace neutrality), in that they do not have an effect on real economic activity and\ninflation (Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003). To simulate the effects of QE and\nto compute the corresponding uncertainty of these effects, we therefore rely on a\nDSGE model developed by CFP which features funding constraints and market\nsegmentation such that the Wallace neutrality does not apply. More precisely,\nin this model both households and financial intermediaries (henceforth FIs) face\nfinancial constraints. The bond market is segmented in that only FIs can pur-\nchase long-term debt instruments. These include public (i.e. government) and\nprivate (i.e. investment) bonds. From the perspective of the FIs, these are per-\nfect substitutes and, hence, yield the same returns. However, the ability of the\nFIs to adjust their liability position is limited by two constraints. First, they\nare leverage-constrained because the amount of deposits they can attract is con-\nstrained by their net worth (due to a hold-up problem). Second, FIs face net\nworth adjustment costs. Households need to finance their investments by way of\nissuing (long-term) investment bonds and, thus, face a funding restriction with re-\nspect to their investments (a so-called loan-in-advance constraint). The purchase\nof government bonds increases the FIs' demand for investment bonds since the lia-\nbility side of the FIs balance sheet cannot adjust easily due to the aforementioned\nconstraints. This in turn alleviates the households' loan-in-advance-constraint.\nOtherwise, the model exhibits familiar New Keynesian features. That is, it com-\nprises households that consume, save in (short-term) deposits and supply labour,\na standard production sector with monopolistic competition in intermediate good\nproduction, price and wage rigidities (see Erceg, Henderson and Levin, 2000) as\nwell as price and wage indexation (see Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans, 2005).\nIf the central bank abstains from forward guidance, it follows a standard Taylor\nrule with some degree of interest rate smoothing. The non-linear model equations\nare summarised in Table 1, and a complete derivation of the model is delegated to\nAppendix A.\nTable 1: Nonlinear model equations\nModel equations:\nHH cons. decision t\n= bt\n- Et\nEuler equation t\n= Et\nRd\nt\nWage curve (WC) wt\nXwn\nt\nXwd\nt\nWC nominator Xwn\nt\n= w,t\nbt\nt\nt\n+ Et\nw\nt\nXwn\nWC denominator Xwd\nt\n= t\nww\nt\nHt\n+ w\nt\nEt\nXwd\nWages law of motion wt\n) (w\nt\nw\nt\nHH decision capital t\nMt\nPk\nt\n= Et\nRk\nPk\nHH decision inv. bonds t\nMt\nQt\n= Et\nWelfare V h\nt\n= bt\nln (Ct\n) - Dw\nt\nt\n+ Et\nV h\nPrice of capital Rk\nt\n= mct\nReal wages wt\n= mct\nPhillips curve (PC) \nt\n= p\nXpn\nt\nXpd\nt\nt\nPC nominator Xpn\nt\n= Yt\np,t\nmct\n(i) + Et\np\nt\n-pp\nt\np\nXpn\nPC denominator Xpd\nt\n= Yt\n+ Et\np\nt\nt\nXpd\nInfl. law of motion (t\n) (\nt\np\nPrice dispersion Dp\nt\n= p\nt\n)\nt\n-p + p\np\nWage dispersion Dw\nt\n= w\nt\nw\nw\nwt\nw\n) w\nt\nwt\n-w\nResource constraint Yt\n= Ct\n+ It\nProduction function Yt\n= At\nK\nt\nt\n/Dp\nt\nFirm's capital decision Kt\nIt\nIt\nInvestment decision Pk\nt\n\u00b5t\n- S It\nIt\n=\nt\nIt\nIt\nFI's balance sheet \u00af\nBt\n+ \u00af\nFt\n= Nt\n+ Lt\nTable 1: continued\nModel equations:\nLeverage Ratio Lt\n=\nEt\nEt\nRL\nRd\nt\nLoan in advance constraint Pk\nt\nIt\n= \u00af\nFt\n-  \u00af\nFt\nt\nQt\nFI's net worth decision t\n[1 + f (Nt\n) + Nt\nf (Nt\n)] = Et\n Pt\nRL\n- Rd\nt\nLt\n+ Rd\nt\nLong-term interest rate RL\nt\nYield to maturity R10\nt\nt\n+ \nMarginal prod. of capital MPKt\n= At\nMarginal prod. of labour MPLt\n= (1 - ) At\n(i)Ht\n(i)-\nTaylor rule Rt\n) Rss\n\nt\nYt\ny\nR\nt\nNotes: bt\n= discount factor shock, Ct\n= consumption, t\n= Lagrange multiplier, t\n= inflation,\nRt\n= nominal interest rate, wt\n= real wage, Xwn\nt\n= & Xwd\nt\n= auxiliary variables for wage curve,\nXpn\nt\n= & Xpd\nt\n= auxiliary variables for Phillips curve, MPLt\n= marginal product of labour,\n= marginal product of capital, RL\nt\n= Long-term rate, R10\nt\n= yield to maturity, It\n=\nInvestment, Pk\nt\n= price of investment, \u00af\nFt\n= investment bonds, \u00af\nBt\n= government bonds, Qt\n=\nprice of bond, Ht\n= labour, At\n= technology shock, Nt\n= net worth, Lt\n= leverage, Dp\nt\n= price\ndispersion, Dw\nt\n= wage dispersion, Kt\n= capital, mct\n= marginal costs, \u00b5t\n= investment shock,\nt\n= financial shock, w,t\n= wage markup shock, p,t\n= price markup shock, Yt\n= output.\n3 Estimation and Calibration\nAs is common in the literature, we calibrate a subset of structural parameters\nto ensure identification.

The other structural parameters are estimated using\nBayesian methods. For the estimation, we linearise the model around the steady\nstate. We use eight observables for the euro area: real per capita output growth,\nreal per capita investment growth, gross inflation, employment growth, real wage\nTable 2: Calibrated parameters\nParameters Description Value\n Household discount factor 0.99\nI Investment adjustment cost 2\nLss Steady state leverage 6\np Elasticity of substitution (goods) 5\nw Elasticity of substitution (labour) 5\ngrowth, the first difference of the short- and long-term interest rate, and real bank\nnet worth growth. Data on bank net worth are taken from the European Central\nBank's MFI Balance Sheet Items Statistics. All the other variables are taken from\nthe Area-wide Model database.3 A description of the data is provided in Appendix\nB. All variables are demeaned. Since we have only seven structural shocks in the\nmodel, we add a measurement error to the observations equation for bank net\nworth in order to avoid stochastic singularity.4 The sample period is from 1998Q1\nTable 3: Prior and posterior distributions of structural parameters\nPrior distribution Posterior distribution\nParam.

For\nthe Taylor rule parameters we use the normal distribution, which is typically used\nfor unbounded parameters. For the financial sector parameter N\n, which governs\nthe importance of net worth adjustment costs, we use a gamma distribution with\nmean 3 and standard deviation 1. The left parts of Tables 3 and 4 display the\nprior distributions of the estimated parameters.\nGiven the prior distributions of the parameters, we draw posterior distributions\nusing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We run four chains, each with 500,000\ndraws.5 The right parts of Tables 3 and 4 report the posterior median, the poste-\nrior mean, and the lower and upper bounds of the 90% highest posterior density\n5We use Dynare 4.5.4 for the estimation of the model, see Adjemian, Bastani, Juillard,\nKaram\u00b4\ne, Mihoubi, Perendia, Pfeifer, Ratto and Villemot (2011).\nFigure 1: Prior and posterior distribution of structural parameters\nh\np\nw\nN\npi\ny\np\nw\nPosterior distribution\nPrior distribution\nPosterior mode\nNote: Dashed-dotted lines are prior distributions, solid lines are posterior distributions, and the\nvertical dotted lines are the posterior modes.\ninterval of the estimated parameters obtained by the Metropolis-Hastings algo-\nrithm. Convergence statistics proposed by Brooks and Gelman (1998) as well as\ntrace plots for the estimated structural parameters are presented in Appendix D.\nThe posterior means of the habit formation parameter (0.86), the price rigidity\nparameter (0.81), and the price indexation parameter (0.53) are estimated to be\nsomewhat higher than in CFP. The posterior means of the wage rigidity (0.82),\nwage indexation (0.38), and labour disutility (1.85) parameter are estimated to be\nsomewhat lower than in CFP. The posterior means of the Taylor rule parameters\nare in line with commonly observed values in the literature. The most noticeable\ndifference between our estimation result and CFP's is the posterior distribution\nfor the net worth adjustment cost parameter N\n. Our posterior mean for this\nparameter (6.82) is vastly higher than the one in CFP (0.79). This could have\nseveral reasons: First, net worth elasticity could be different in Europe compared\nto the USA. Second, our sample ends in 2013Q4 and thus includes data of the\nfinancial crisis. Third, we use data on bank net worth to better identify the net\nworth adjustment cost parameter. On average, financial frictions could thus be\nmore severe in our sample than in CFP's sample which ends in 2008Q4. Figure 1\nshows the prior and posterior distributions of the structural parameters as well as\ntheir posterior modes.\n4 Implementation of QE and FG\nWe implement the PSPP of the Eurosystem using an AR(2) process for the real\nmarket value of long-term bonds on the balance sheets of the FIs:\n\u00af\nBt\n= \u00af\nss\n\u00af\n\u00af\n-\u00af\nB\nt\nOnce triggered, the entire path of the PSPP is taken into account (and, thus,\nknown) by every agent of the model.

The unconstrained nature of the\ninterest rate in this scenario implies that it increases in response to the inflation-\nary stimulus of the QE programme according to the Taylor rule. In the second,\nthird and fourth scenario, we analyse the model's range of predictions if the QE\nprogramme is accompanied by a one, two, and three year lasting anticipated inter-\nest rate peg, respectively. After the peg, the interest rate varies according to the\nestimated Taylor rule.\nWe implement prior predictive analysis in the following way. Given the DSGE\nmodel outlined in section 2, we posit prior densities for the model's structural\nparameters, where we restrict our analysis to the parameter subspace that implies\na unique rational expectations equilibrium. We then simulate 100.000 sets of draws\nfor the structural parameters based on the prior distributions specified in Table\n3.8 Then, based on these draws, we calculate perfect foresight simulations for each\npolicy scenario. In this way, the prior predictive analysis produces a distribution\nof inflation effects for each policy scenario and, thus, a range of possible model-\nimplied responses to the policy impact before confronting the model with actual\ndata.\nWe use posterior predictive analysis to analyse the model-implied responses after\nhaving confronted the model with our data set. The posterior means/medians\nshown in Table 3 are based on the posterior distributions, which have been gener-\nated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm during the estimation of the model.\nWe simulate 500.000 sets of draws for the posterior distributions. Based on these\n8To generate these draws we make use of the Global Sensitivity Analysis toolbox developed\ndraws we calculate 100.000 perfect foresight simulations for each policy scenario.9\nIn this way, we produce a range of possible inflation responses for the four policy\nscenarios after the information content in the actual data has been exploited.10\n5.1 Baseline results\nOur first set of results, shown in Figure 3, refers to the policy scenario in which the\ncentral bank implements a QE programme without an interest rate peg. Conse-\nquently, in response to inflationary pressures the central bank increases its policy\nrate (not shown) according to the Taylor rule specified in (2), with TR\nt\nThe left-hand panel (red fan charts) shows the distribution of the inflation path for\nthe prior predictive analysis. The black line represents the median inflation path.\nThe simulations result in a median peak response of inflation of 0.34 percentage\npoints (pp) five quarters after the implementation of the QE programme. The\nuncertainty of the macroeconomic effects is highlighted by the 66 percent interval\nof the overall distribution of the simulations. The different shadings represent 5.\u00af\npercentiles. At the peak response, the interval exhibits a range of 0.20 pp for the\neffect of the PSPP on inflation. Thus, a priori, the model is able to generate notable\neffects of the PSPP, but the parameter uncertainty of the effects is pronounced.\nThe right-hand panel (green fan charts) in Figure 3 shows the distribution of\nposterior draws from the MCMC simulations that have converged.\n10Note that when we analyse the inflation effects of QE in combination with FG, some draws\n(which still deliver unique rational expectations equilibria) imply sign switches in the simulations\nof the endogenous variables. This phenomenon has become known as the reversal puzzle (see\nCarlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian, 2015; Gerke, Giesen, Kienzler and Tenhofen, 2017). Here, we\nfollow Lind\u00b4\ne, Smets and Wouters (2016) and constrain our analysis to those cases in which the\nreversal puzzle does not arise (for both the prior and the posterior predictive analysis).\nFigure 3: Inflation effects in response to a QE shock, prior-posterior predictive\nanalysis\n(a) Prior predictive, no FG\npp. diff.\n(b) Posterior predictive, no FG\npp. diff.\nNote: The figure shows the 66 percent interval around the median response to the QE shock.\nThe separated areas (from weak to strongly shaded) reflect 5.\u00af\n5% percentiles.

The median peak response\nof inflation is 0.42 pp, and at the peak response, the interval exhibits a range of\n0.15 pp. Hence, after confronting the model with the data, it suggests a higher\nmedian effect of the PSPP on inflation. Furthermore, as the distributional mass is\nmore centred around the median, the posterior distributions imply a lower degree\nof parameter uncertainty about these effects. This may, however, not come as a\nsurprise as the prior distributions were chosen to be fairly broad and accordingly\nthe posterior distributions tend to be narrower (see Figure 1), leading to a sizeable\nshare of the distributional mass to be close to the median response.\nFigure 4 shows the simulation results for the scenarios in which QE is accompanied\nby FG.

The left-hand panels (red fan charts) show the results of the prior\npredictive analyses, while the right-hand panels (green fan charts) show the results\nfor the posterior predictive analyses. Looking at the prior predictive analysis for\na QE programme accompanied by one year of FG (upper left graph), the median\nresponse increases strongly compared to the scenario without FG. The median\npeak effect is 2.62 pp, approximately seven times larger than the median peak\neffect without FG. In addition, a large share of the distributional mass now implies\nresponses which are multitudes larger than in the scenario without FG. At the\npeak, the interval exhibits a range of 6.52 pp.\nThe observation that even rather short periods of FG produce such large effects\nof inflation in New-Keynesian-type models such as those seen in Figure 4 seems\nunrealistic and has become known as the FG puzzle in the literature (see Del Negro,\nGiannoni and Patterson, 2015). Hence, here we replicate the expected result that\nthe median peak inflation response increases strongly with FG and accordingly the\ndistribution of the inflation paths widens.11\nThe upper right graph in Figure 4 shows the posterior predictive analysis for a\nQE programme accompanied by one year of FG. It shows that the median peak\nresponse of inflation increases (to 0.81 pp) and the range of the distribution at the\npeak widens (to 0.48 pp) compared to the posterior predictive analysis without\nFG, as expected. However, this increase in inflation responses going from zero to\none year of FG is not nearly as sharp as in the prior predictive analysis. It thus\nseems that the FG puzzle is less evident for the posterior predictive analysis. The\ndifference between prior and posterior predictive analysis, however, loses impor-\ntance for longer durations of FG, although the prior predictive analysis continues\nto deliver higher median peak responses of inflation as well as wider distributions\n11Several approaches have been developed in the literature to cope with the FG puzzle, such as\nFigure 4: Inflation effects in response to a QE shock and different durations of FG,\nprior-posterior predictive analysis\n(a) Prior predictive, 1 year FG\npp. diff.\n(b) Posterior predictive, 1 year FG\npp. diff.\n(c) Prior predictive, 2 years FG\npp. diff.\n(d) Posterior predictive, 2 years FG\npp. diff.\n(e) Prior predictive, 3 years FG\npp. diff.\n(f) Posterior predictive, 3 years FG\npp. diff.\nNote: The figure shows the 66 percent interval around the median response to the QE shock\naccompanied by one year of FG.

This is evident in the\nsecond and third row of Figure 4 where prior and posterior predictive analyses for\nthe inflation response for two and three years, respectively, of FG are shown. In\nthese cases, both the median peak responses (3.73 pp and 3.98 pp for two and\nthree years, respectively, of FG) and the ranges of the distribution at the peak\n(12.93 pp and 13.19 pp for two and three years, respectively, of FG) for the prior\npredictive analysis are higher than the median peak responses (3.16 pp and 3.20\npp for two and three years, respectively, of FG) and the ranges of the distribution\nat the peak (8.47 pp and 10.03 pp for two and three years, respectively, of FG) for\nthe posterior predictive analysis but the difference in both cases is less pronounced\nthan in the case of one year of FG. That is, for longer durations of FG, the FG\npuzzle is clearly evident also in the posterior predictive analysis. In any case, the\nuncertainty surrounding the effects of the QE programme accompanied by FG on\ninflation, in general, is substantial.\nComparing Figure 3(a) with Figures 4(a), 4(c) and 4(e), and Figure 3(b) with\nFigures 4(b), 4(d) and 4(f), it is obvious that the parametrisation of the model\ncannot explain the upward shift in the median path of inflation and the much\nwider distribution of the inflation path \u00ad it is the same within the left and right\ncolumns of Figures 3 and 4 \u00ad but can only be explained by the peg. That said, it is\nnevertheless useful to examine the role of the parameters for two reasons: (i) Since\nin the presented figures all parameters vary across draws, it is not clear what role\neach single parameter plays for the distribution, and thus parameter uncertainty,\nof the inflation response within each figure, that is, given a duration of FG and\ngiven the type of predictive analysis (prior or posterior). (ii) Figures 4(a) and 4(b)\nshow that there is a pronounced difference in the median inflation response as well\nas the width of the distribution across the type of predictive analysis. Since this\ndifference cannot be explained by the duration of FG \u00ad it is the same across the\ntwo figures \u00ad it must be the case that the parametrisation drives this result but\nit is not clear which parameters contribute most to this observation. Both issues\n(i) and (ii) can be examined within the framework of predictive analysis. We deal\nwith issue (i) in Subsection 5.2 and with issue (ii) in Subsection 5.3.\n5.2 The role of individual parameters for uncertainty\nFollowing Leeper, Traum and Walker (2017), we derive a measure indicating which\nparameters are most important for our results. In particular, we ask to which\nextent each estimated parameter contributes to uncertainty for a given interest rate\npeg, within each predictive analysis. To this end, we proceed as follows. For each\ndraw j  [1, J] of the parameters, j = j\n. . . j\ni\n. . . j\nn\n, we simulate the model\nand extract the peak response of inflation to the QE shock from these simulations.\nIn this way, we obtain a distribution of peak effects. Then, for each draw we\nsimulate the model again using a new parameter vector i,j = j\n. . . ~\ni\n. . . j\nn\n,\nwhere ~\ni\ndenotes the ith parameter that is now fixed at the median for each draw\nj. The only difference between j and i,j is thus the change from j\ni\nto ~\ni\n.\nWe again extract the peak response of inflation to the QE shock from these new\nsimulations and obtain a new distribution of peak effects. We do this for all\nestimated structural parameters of the model i = 1, ..., n. We then calculate the\nroot mean squared error RMSEi\n=\nJ\n(peakj-peakj\ni\nJ\nfor each of the parameters,\nwhere peakj\ni\ndenotes the peak effect of inflation for draw j when the ith parameter\nis fixed. The parameter with the highest RMSE has the biggest impact on the\nvariation of the peak response of inflation to a QE shock. We calculate the RMSEs\nboth for the prior and the posterior predictive analyses for zero, one, two, and three\nyears of FG.\nTable 5: RMSEs for peak response of inflation for the prior predictive analyses\nwhen a given parameter is fixed at its prior median and different durations of FG\n(a) 0 years FG\n\nw\np\nN\nw\ny\np\n(b) 1 year FG\np\nw\n\ny\np\nN\nw\n(c) 2 years FG\nw\np\ny\nw\np\n\nN\n(d) 3 years FG\nw\ny\np\nw\n\np\nN\nTable 6: RMSEs for peak response of inflation for the posterior predictive analyses\nwhen a given parameter is fixed at its posterior median and different durations of\nFG\n(a) 0 years FG\nw\np\n\ny\nw\np\nN\n(b) 1 year FG\nw\np\ny\n\nw\np\nN\n(c) 2 years FG\nw\np\ny\np\nw\n\nN\n(d) 3 years FG\nw\np\ny\nw\np\n\nN\nTable 5 shows the RMSEs for the peak effect of inflation for the prior predictive\nanalyses when a given parameter is fixed at its prior median and different durations\nof FG. The parameters are sorted in descending order according to their RMSEs.\nAlthough there is variation in the ranking for different durations of FG, the broad\npicture is that the Calvo parameters p\nand w\nwhich govern the probability of re-\nsetting prices and wages, respectively, play the most important role in determining\nthe uncertainty about the peak response of inflation to a QE shock. In contrast,\nN\n, the parameter governing net worth adjustment costs, has comparably little\ninfluence on the uncertainty about the peak inflation response to a QE shock. The\nlatter observation is noteworthy since N\ngreater than zero is a prerequisite for\nQE to have real effects in the model. A similar picture emerges for the peak effect\nof inflation for the posterior predictive analyses when one parameter is fixed at\nits posterior median, shown in Table 6. Across all durations of FG, the Calvo\nparameters have a strong influence on the peak effect of inflation and hence on the\nuncertainty about the effect, while, again, N\nhas comparably little impact.\nThe result that the financial friction parameter is of minor importance for the\noutcomes of the policy scenarios is in line with other studies analysing the role of\nfinancial frictions for the dynamics of macroeconomic variables. For example, Suh\nand Walker (2016) find that the New Keynesian model with financial frictions is\nnot capable of reproducing the empirically observed dynamics between financial\nand non-financial variables. That said, it is not obvious what the reason is for\nthis observation. For example, it could be due to the model structure per se or\nto estimating the linear version of the model.12 However, our approach to analyse\nparameter uncertainty is in no way dependent on the specific model structure or\nthe estimation of a linear version of the model.\n12Although we estimate the linear version of the model, our simulations are based on the fully\nnon-linear version of the model with different durations of interest rate pegs.\n5.3 Evaluating differences between prior and posterior pre-\ndictive analysis\nFigures 4(a) and 4(b) show that there is a marked difference in the median infla-\ntion response as well as the width of the distribution between the prior and the\nposterior predictive analysis of the inflation response for one year of FG.13 Since\nthis difference cannot be explained by the duration of FG this suggests that the\nstrength of the FG puzzle depends on the parametrisation. Put differently, the\nestimation carries the model into parameter regions where the FG puzzle is not as\napparent as in those parameter regions implied by prior distributions for one year\nof FG. To evaluate the relative influence of each single parameter on this result,\nwe again apply the procedure described in subsection 5.2 but vary the experiment\nin one important aspect: Instead of fixing a given parameter to the median of the\nposterior distribution when conducting the posterior predictive analysis, we now\nfix a given parameter to the median of the prior distribution when conducting the\nposterior predictive analysis. We then again compare, draw by draw, the peak of\nthe inflation response thus obtained with the peak of the inflation response ob-\ntained when all parameters are varied by computing the RMSEs for the different\nparameters. In this way, we are able to determine the relative influence of the\nparameters on the difference between the results of the prior and the posterior\npredictive analysis for one year of FG, that is, on producing the FG puzzle.\nTable 7 shows the RMSEs for the posterior predictive analysis in the case of one\nyear FG when a given parameter is fixed at its prior median, sorted in descending\n13As described in section 5.1, this difference is also apparent for two and three years of FG,\nalbeit to a less pronounced degree.\nTable 7: RMSEs for peak response of inflation for the posterior predictive analysis\nwhen a given parameter is fixed at its prior median and one year of FG\nw\np\npi\nw\ny\nN\np\norder according to their RMSEs. We observe that w\nhas the highest RMSE\nand thus the strongest influence on the different results across the prior and the\nposterior predictive analysis for one year of FG, whereas  has the lowest influence.\nN\n, the parameter governing net worth adjustment costs, has, once again, only\nlittle influence. We visualise this result with Figure 5 that shows the distribution\nof the inflation response to a QE shock produced by a posterior predictive analysis\nwhen w\n(Figure 5(a)) and  (Figure 5(b)) are fixed at their prior median. The\nchange of  in the posterior predictive analysis to its prior median in each draw of\nparameters essentially produces the same picture as in Figure 4(b), that is, the FG\npuzzle is apparent only very moderately. To be precise, the median peak of the\nFigure 5(b), and the range of the distribution at the peak changes only to a small\nchange of w\nin the posterior predictive analysis to its prior median in each draw\nof parameters produces a much higher median peak response of inflation of 1.5396\npp (an increase of around 90%) and a much wider range of the distribution at the\nFigure 5: Inflation response to QE shock for one year FG, posterior predictive\nanalysis with w\n(left) and  (right) fixed at prior median.\n(a) w\npp. diff.\n(b) \npp. diff.\nNote: The figure shows the 66 percent interval around the median response to the QE shock\naccompanied by one year of FG.

This holds in general for all durations of FG. That is, it matters where a given\nparameter is fixed in the framework of this type of predictive analysis, and the\ndecision of where to fix a given parameter depends on the question the researcher\nseeks to answer.\n6 Conclusion\nWe use prior and posterior predictive analysis to examine the extent of parameter\nuncertainty when analysing the macroeconomic effects of the Eurosystem's PSPP\nand FG. Prior and posterior predictive analysis provides a way of carrying over\nthe information about parameter uncertainty gained in the estimation of a model\nto a policy scenario analysis involving the solution of a non-linear model (in our\ncase under the assumption of perfect foresight) with an anticipated interest rate\npeg, and allows for identifying the driving parameters behind this uncertainty.\nWe find that the uncertainty about the effects of the PSPP is considerable and\nincreases when it is accompanied by FG. The Calvo parameters \u00ad which govern\nthe probability, in a given period, of being able to reset prices and wages \u00ad have\nthe biggest influence in determining the uncertainty about the inflation effects of\na QE shock while the financial friction in the form of net worth adjustment costs\nis much less important.\nIn general, the method of using predictive analysis for illustrating parameter un-\ncertainty in policy scenarios is very flexible. In particular, its use does not depend\non a specific model structure, on estimating a linear or non-linear version of a\nmodel, or on solving and simulating the model in a linear or non-linear setup.\nReferences\nAdjemian, S., Bastani, H., Juillard, M., Karam\u00b4\ne, F., Mihoubi, F., Perendia, G.,\nPfeifer, J., Ratto, M. and Villemot, S.

The same approach is also taken in Suh and Walker (2016) and Leeper et al.\nThe prior predictive analysis we carry out entails the following steps:\n1. Given the model, M outlined in Appendix A, and its corresponding struc-\ntural parameters, , we posit a prior density, p(|M), specifying the range of\nvalues for the parameters and the associated probabilities. The parameters\nare drawn independently and ~\np (|M) denotes the product of the marginal\nparameter distributions. We define an indicator function, I {  D\n}, that is\nassumed to take on the value one if  generates a determinate solution of the\nmodel M and zero if it is not part of the subspace of parameters D\nthat de-\nlivers a unique rational expectations equilibrium. The joint prior distribution\nis defined as p (|M) = c-1 ~\np (|M) I {  D\n}, where c =\n\n~\np (|M) d\ndescribes a scaling factor that ensures that the prior density integrates to\none.\n2. The model generates predictive distributions for its variables, yT\n, using\np (yT\n|M) =\n\np (yT\n|, M) p (|M) d, where p (yT\n|, M) = L (yT\n|, M) de-\nnotes the likelihood of the data.\n3. For any vector of interest, , the predictive distribution can be used to\nproduce p (|yT\n, , M). Our statistics of interest are the response of inflation\nafter a QE shock in periods zero to 25 after the shock, as well as the peak\nresponse of inflation.\nImplementation in Dynare: First, we sample draws for the structural parameters\nfrom the prespecified corresponding prior distributions. This is done using the\nglobal sensitivity analysis (GSA) toolbox, which is part of Dynare. Then, we solve\nthe model under perfect foresight for each draw, simulate the path for inflation in\nresponse to a QE shock and extract the peak of the inflation response. Having\nthese statistics at hand for every draw, we can calculate their median as well as\ntheir dispersion.\nWe implement the posterior predictive analysis in the same way, except that we\nsample draws for the structural parameters from the posterior distributions ob-\ntained by the Metropolis Hastings algorithm.\nAppendix D Estimation\nD.1 MCMC diagnostics\nFigure 6 shows the univariate convergence statistics for all estimated parameters h,\nw\n, p\n, , , w\n, p\n, N\n, \nand y\n. The statistics include three different measures:\nthe measure presented in the column 'intervall' is based on an interval statistic\nconstructed around the parameter mean (i.e. the 80% HPD intervall). The mea-\nsures shown in the columns variance and skewness are based on a statistic that\ndepicts squared and cubed deviations from the parameter mean. The blue line\ndepicts theses measures based on all draws (i.e. draws from all Markov chains\ntogether - between chain measure) and the red line is based on the draws from the\nindividual chains (within a chain measure). Each row in Figure 6 corresponds to\none parameter.\nFigure 6: MCMC univariate convergence diagnostics for all estimated structural\nparameters\nInterval\nD.2 Trace plots\nTo show that the draws for the estimated structural parameters which we use\nfor the posterior predictive analysis are not trending or display otherwise strange\nbehavior, we also present trace plots for all structural parameters in Figure 7. Since\nwe rely on the last 100,000 draws from the first Markov chain, we correspondingly\npresent the trace plots for each of the parameters base on the first Markov chain\nFigure 7: Trace plots for estimated parameters based on first Markov chain\n(a) h\n(b) w\n(c) p\n(d) \n(e) \n(f) w\n(g) p\n(h) N\n(i) \n(j) y"
