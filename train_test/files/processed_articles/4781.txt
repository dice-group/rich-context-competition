    "abstract": "Abstract: Altruistic behavior, in which one individual provides aid to another at some cost\nto itself, is well documented. However, some species engage in a form of altruism, called\nrescue, that places the altruist in immediate danger. Here we investigate one such example,\nnamely rescuing victims captured by predators. In a field experiment with two North\nAmerican ant species, Tetramorium sp. E and Prenolepis imparis, individuals were held in\nartificial snares simulating capture. T. sp. E, but not P. imparis, exhibited digging, pulling,\nand snare biting, the latter precisely targeted to the object binding the victim. These results\nare the first to document precision rescue in a North American ant species; moreover,\nunlike rescue in other ants, T. sp. E rescues conspecifics from different colonies, mirroring\ntheir atypical social behavior, namely the lack of aggression between non-nestmate\n(heterocolonial) conspecifics. In a second, observational study designed to demonstrate\nrescue from an actual predator, T. sp. E victims were dropped into an antlion's pit and the\nbehavior of a single rescuer was observed. Results showed that T. sp.

Examples of rescue behavior in non-human\nanimals include a male capuchin monkey helping a mother-infant pair flee a group of\nattackers (Vogel and Fuentes-Jim\u00e9nez, 2006) and dolphins lifting an injured pod member\nto the surface to breathe instead of fleeing the fishing boat that caused the injury\n(Siebenaler and Caldwell, 1956). The species in both cases are mammals and, although\nthese observational reports have gained attention, there is only one, very recent\nexperimental study of rescue behavior in mammals (Bartal, Decety, and Mason, 2011). In\ncontrast, rescue behavior \u00ad at least very simple forms of it \u00ad have been observed in ants as\nearly as Belt's 1984 monograph, and several more recent studies have revealed not only\nthat ant rescue is much more complex than previously believed (Nowbahari, Scohier,\nDurand, and Hollis, 2009; Nowbahari, Hollis, and Durand, 2012), but also that rescuers are\nwilling to face extreme risks (Czechowski, Godziska, and Kozlowski, 2002).\nThe very structure of eusocial ants' society is based upon an altruistic worker caste\ncaring for offspring not their own (Bourke and Franks, 1995). Additionally, worker ants\nprovide help for individuals in distress; for example, when one ant is trapped by dirt,\nnestmates have been observed digging the dirt away from the trapped ant, which generally\nresults in the trapped individual being freed (Lafleur, 1940; Markl, 1965). More recently,\nants have been observed engaging in what might be altruistic behavior that puts the\naltruist's own safety in danger. For example, when driver ants, Dorylus spp., attack\nPachycondyla analis soldier ants, small P. analis worker ants, the victims in these\nencounters, will attack the Dorylus ants clinging to the body of their soldier nestmates\n(Beck and Kunz, 2007). Indeed, P. analis worker ants that appeared to be fleeing the scene\nwere observed turning back to join the fight, effectively aiding a struggling nestmate.\nAlthough the worker ants' response may at first seem an obvious example of altruistic\nrescue, as the workers' behavior alleviates the distress of a nestmate and places the rescuers\nin danger, the behavior may in fact have been self-defense, as suggested by the authors\nthemselves.\nNonetheless, recent experimental studies provide clear evidence for actual rescue\nbehavior in ants. In separate experiments, one conducted in the laboratory (Nowbahari et\nal., 2009) and another in the field (Hollis and Nowbahari, 2013), the ability to rescue was\nexplored in six different species of sand-digging Mediterranean ants. In both studies,\nindividual ants were tied to a piece of filter paper with nylon thread and partially buried in\nsand. In the presence of the entrapped victim, rescuers of three species, namely Cataglyphis\ncursor, Cataglyphis floricola, and Lasius grandis, not only engaged in the simple digging\nand pulling behaviors, but also exhibited two previously unknown rescue behaviors. That\nis, following their ineffective behavior to free the victim, rescuers then began to move sand\naway from the victim, exposing the nylon snare, and then targeted the snare with precise\nbites. Labeled precision rescue behavior by the authors, snare biting was carefully aimed,\neven though it was in direct contact with the victim's body, thus suggesting that ants\nsomehow were able to recognize what, exactly, held the victim in place.\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\nYet another report of ant rescue provides additional evidence that several ant\nspecies engage in behavior that meets the Nowbahari and Hollis (2010) definition of\nrescue. When either Formica sanguinea or Formica cinerea workers were captured by\npredatory larval antlions, nearby nestmates attacked the antlion, dug in the dirt to uncover\nnestmates, and pulled on the limbs of the captured ant (Czechowski et al., 2002). Although\nthe two forms of precision rescue behavior described by Nowbahari et al. (2009) were not\nreported in this study, it is possible that the authors simply failed to include them.\nBecause of their sedentary habits, pit-digging antlions, such as those observed by\nCzechowski et al. (2002), provide a unique opportunity for studying rescue behavior under\nboth field and laboratory conditions. Many antlion species, members of the family\nMyrmeleontidae, build cone-shaped pits in loose, sandy soils during their larval stage. Pit\ntraps not only allow for prey capture over a large distance, but also they inhibit prey escape\nand serve as a source of protection for the antlion (Guillette, Hollis, and Markarian, 2009;\nLucas, 1986). After an arthropod crawls past the edge of the trap and begins to lose its\nfooting on the collapsing pit walls, it may spend time struggling to escape before it falls to\nthe bottom of the pit where the antlion waits with open mandibles. Once captured, the prey\nmay struggle for a period of time before the antlion is able to subdue it, often by flicking it\nback and forth against the pit walls (Griffiths, 1980). This somewhat long process makes\nsuccessful rescue attempts possible. Indeed, we have observed ants alive and fully mobile\nafter being held by an antlion for over 10 minutes, all the more surprising because antlions\nkill their prey by injecting poison through the mandibles (Griffiths, 1980).\nThe present study attempted to explore precision rescue behavior, and its role as an\nantipredator strategy, in two species of North American ants, Tetramorium sp. E (Schlick-\nSteiner et al., 2006) and Prenolepis imparis. These species were selected for three reasons,\nall of which enabled us to expand our knowledge of precision rescue in ants. One, both\nspecies share the same general habitat as pit-digging antlions and, thus, provide an\nopportunity to study species for which rescue might serve as an important antipredator\nstrategy. Two, T. sp. E differs in an important way from the three Mediterranean \"rescuer\"\nWhereas all three of those species rescued only nestmates, displaying aggression toward\nants of either another species or another colony, T. sp. E does not display aggression\nbetween non-nestmate conspecifics, suggesting \u00ad albeit on the basis of behavioral evidence\nonly \u00ad that they may have a unicolonial structure (Steiner, Schlick-Steiner, and Buschinger,\n2003). Unicolonial ants build extensive colonies that can include hundreds of nests between\nwhich workers and queens can move freely without aggression (Helanter\u00e4, Strassmann,\nCarrillo, and Queller, 2009). But whether or not T. sp. E is a unicolonial species, the lack of\naggression between non-nestmate conspecifics gave us good reason to predict that, if T. sp.\nE were capable of engaging in rescue behavior, it would likely rescue all conspecifics,\nwhether nestmates or not. Finally, three, although Prenolepis imparis, the other ant species\nchosen for this study, are of the same relatively small size as T. sp. E (0.3 cm) and, thus,\nwould likely have difficulty escaping antlions' pits, they are not found in as close proximity\nto predatory antlions as are T. sp. E ants. However, unlike T. sp. E, P. imparis exhibits no\nevidence of a unicolonial social structure and is highly aggressive toward ants of other\nspecies - often one of the dominant species in an ant community hierarchy (Fellers, 1989).\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\nThus, if P. imparis did engage in rescue behavior, it would be more likely to share the\n\"rescue profile\" of the three previously studied Mediterranean species, rescuing only\nnestmates.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1, a field study, compared the behavioral reactions to an artificially\nrestrained ant, the victim, in two North American ant species, Tetramorium sp. E and\nPrenolepis imparis.\nMaterials and Methods\nTests were carried out in South Hadley, Massachusetts between May and July 2011.\nEach of four T. sp. E colonies and three P. imparis colonies, at least 150 ft. apart from each\nother, were tested under five different conditions: homocolonial tests, in which the live\nvictim was a conspecific from the same test colony; heterocolonial tests, in which the live\nvictim was a conspecific from a different colony; heterospecific tests, in which the live\nvictim was a member of a different species; anesthetized nestmate tests, in which the victim\nwas a nestmate that had been anesthetized by freezing, making it incapable of signaling\nalarm; and, control tests in which the paper-and-thread snare was empty. Only colonies that\nexhibited high activity levels and a large number of foragers present on the surface near the\nnest entrance were chosen for study. All data were collected during ants' active period.\nFilter paper snares were prepared in advance of all tests: Using a sewing needle, a\nsmall loop of two-ply cotton thread was inserted into a 1.0 x 0.5 cm piece of filter paper;\nthe ends of the thread were tied loosely underneath the paper and left hanging until needed\nin the field. Prepared snares were kept in a clean container to avoid contamination; a new\nsnare was used for each test.\nProcedure\nThe testing procedures were similar to Hollis and Nowbahari (2013). Victim ants\nwere captured after they were observed leaving the nest entrance of the colony and gently\ninserted into the thread loop, which then was tightened around the ant's thorax. To insure\nthat foragers would be likely to encounter the test stimulus, the snared ant was placed\nwithin 5 cm of the nest entrance and the paper was lightly covered with substrate from the\nnest area. Each test commenced within 10 seconds of positioning the snared ant, and was 5\nminutes in duration.\nFor anesthetized nestmate tests, victims were placed in a small plastic container and\nrefrigerated for a period of 15 minutes. After anesthetization the ant was snared as\ndescribed above. Control tests were conducted using an empty snare not containing an ant,\nbut in all other ways prepared as described above. Half of the heterospecific tests were\nconducted with a member of the other species being studied and half with Formica ants\nfrom a nearby colony.\nData collection and analysis\nSix trials of each test type were obtained from each of the seven ant colonies (four\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\nT. sp. E and three P. imparis). All tests were recorded using Panasonic Mini DV Digital\nCamcorders, and data were collected during playback of the video-recorded trials. An\ninterval recording procedure was used to collect all data: Each 5-minute trial was divided\ninto 10-second intervals and target behaviors were recorded by interval. For each target\nbehavior (see Table 1), the data were the proportion of intervals in which that behavior\npattern was observed.\nEach of the behavior patterns was subjected to a univariate analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) with two between-subjects factors, namely species and test type. In addition,\nbecause the individual rescue behavior patterns cannot capture the overall level of rescue,\nwe also computed a \"combined\" rescue score.\nTable 1. Operational definitions of target behavior patterns\nBehavior Operational Definition\nSand digging Ant positions itself within 2 cm of, and facing, the test stimulus, either the\nensnared ant victim or the paper-and-snare control stimulus, and flicks sand\nbackward, away from the test stimulus, using its anterior legs (Experiment 1\nonly). The antennae are facing forward, in the characteristic non-aggressive\nposture.\nLimb pulling Ant grabs limb of the ant victim with mandibles and drags it backwards with\nfrequent antennation. The antennae are facing forward, in the characteristic\nnon-aggressive posture\nSnare biting Ant bites and tugs at the thread snare using mandibles (Experiment 1 only).\nThe antennae are facing forward, in the characteristic non-aggressive\nposture.\nSand transport Ant picks up, using its mandibles, one or more particles of sand/substrate\ncovering the filter paper or ensnared ant victim (Experiment 1), or covering\nthe victim while in the antlion pit (Experiment 2), and moves it at least one\nbody length from its original position. The antennae are facing forward, in\nthe characteristic non-aggressive posture.\nAttack Ant engages in either of two aggressive behaviors (Experiment 2 only):\nBiting/dismembering, closing its mandibles around part of the antlion's\nbody, sometimes while also moving away from the antlion; or, stinging,\ndirecting its stinger toward the antlion, often while the gaster (abdomen) is\nflexed, curved underneath the body. All attack components are performed\nwith the antennae flexed backward, in the characteristic aggressive posture.\nResults and Discussion\nAlthough both species engaged in frequent approach to the test stimulus, which we\ninsured by placing the victim close to the nest entrance, T. sp. E and P. imparis differed\nsignificantly in their combined rescue response to the test stimuli (see Figure 1). An\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\nindicating that T. sp. E and P. imparis responded differently to the experimental conditions\nvaried between the test stimuli. Exploration of the significant interaction between species\nmuch unlike P. imparis, T. sp. E engaged in rescue behavior on both homocolonial and\nheterocolonial tests, and performed significantly more rescue behavior during\nhomocolonial tests than either heterospecific, anesthetized nestmate, and empty snare tests\n(p =.003, p =.004, and p =.004, respectively). However, in keeping with our predictions, T.\nsp. E provided rescue equally to both homocolonial and heterocolonial ants of the same\nspecies (p = .999), engaging in rescue behavior in 38% of homocolonial and 42% of\nheterocolonial trials. These findings are very much unlike previous results with the three\nMediterranean rescuer species (Hollis and Nowbahari, 2013; Nowbahari et al., 2009), but\nconsistent with observations that T. sp. E ants do not display aggression toward non-\nnestmate conspecifics and, possibly, have a unicolonial social structure (Steiner et al.,\n2003). Conversely, P. imparis performed rescue behavior in only one test, a heterocolonial\ntest, which also included aggressive behaviors directed towards the snared conspecific.\nBoth T. sp. E and P. imparis refused aid to all heterospecific victims, and also did not\nrespond with rescue behavior during any of the control tests, either with an anesthetized\nnestmate or with an empty snare.\nFigure 1. The mean proportion of intervals in which at least one individual engaged in\nsome form of rescue behavior (i.e., combined score), in response to five kinds of test\nstimuli\nNotes: Tests were conducted with each of two species, Tetramorium sp. E and\nPrenolepis imparis. Error bars reflect \u00b1 standard error of the mean.\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\nAs can be seen in Figure 2, which illustrates the types of rescue behavior performed\nin response to homocolonial victims, T. sp. E engaged in both sand transport and snare\nbiting, the kinds of precision rescue behaviors first reported in C. cursor (Nowbahari et al.,\n2009) and more recently in C. floricola and L. grandis (Hollis and Nowbahari, 2013).\nFigure 2. The mean proportion of intervals in which ants engaged in each of the four\nrescue behavior patterns during homocolonial test trials\nNotes: Tests were conducted with each of two species, Tetramorium sp. E\nand Prenolepis imparis. Error bars reflect \u00b1 standard error of the mean.\nExperiment 2\nAlthough we postulated that the rescue behavior delivered by T. sp. E to an\nartificially ensnared conspecific also would occur if a conspecific were captured by an\nantlion, this premise required further testing. Because Experiment 1 already had included\ncontrol groups designed to show that rescue is elicited only in the presence of an actively\nresponding conspecific victim, Experiment 2, a semi-naturalistic observational study\nperformed in the laboratory, was designed merely to demonstrate that T. sp. E would\nindeed enter an antlion's pit and attempt to rescue a nestmate captured by a live antlion.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe ant subjects were obtained from two wild T. sp. E colonies taken from the\ngrounds of Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA, and moved into the laboratory.\nEach colony was kept in a 10-gallon aquarium tank filled with commercially available\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\ngarden soil. The upper walls of the aquarium were coated with fluon (\"Insect-A-Slip\"),\nwhich prevents ants from escaping. Ants were maintained on a mixture of honey water ad\nlibitum, and fed mealworms two to three times each week. Colonies were misted with\nwater daily to prevent dehydration.\nAntlions were wild captured larvae (Myrmeleontidae sp.) obtained from\nAntLionFarms.com, Pensacola, Florida. After arrival, antlions were placed individually in\nsmall round plastic food bowls (4 x 15 cm diam), filled with fine sanitized Estes Marine\nSand. A plastic ring (\"pit ring\") was placed on top of the sand in the middle of each bowl, a\ntechnique for insuring that antlions dug pits in the center of each bowl. (Details of antlions'\nhousing and maintenance are described in Guillette et al., 2009). Antlions used in this study\nwere selected based upon their weight and pit size: Only antlions that weighed between\nchosen. Pit rings were removed after pits were established.\nBefore each test, two ants were removed from the surface of one colony and placed\nin an empty plastic bowl, the walls of which were coated with fluon. One member of the\npair, randomly chosen as the victim, was picked up and gently rolled between the\nexperimenter's fingers, and then dropped, still alive, directly into an antlion pit. This\nprocedure stunned the ant and injured its legs, which prevented escape from the antlion.\nSixty seconds after the victim was dropped and grabbed by the antlion, the remaining pair\nmember was placed halfway between the edge of the bowl and the edge of the antlion pit.\nOnce the potential rescuer entered the antlion pit, behavior was video recorded for 5\nminutes, or until the potential rescuer climbed out of the pit. Both ants were left in the bowl\nfor the antlion to consume. After antlions consumed the prey and threw both carcasses from\nits pit, the antlion was removed, the sand in its bowl was replaced by fresh sand, and the\nantlion was placed back into the bowl and given time to build a new pit. Antlions were used\nagain after 3 days if they met the criteria for inclusion, described above. A total of 58 trials\nwere conducted. Target behaviors, described in Table 1, were scored during video\nplayback.\nResults and Discussion\nIn 36% of trials, individual T. sp. E ants responded to a nestmate captured by an\nantlion and performed rescue behavior (see Figure 3). This percentage of rescue attempts,\nwhich is nearly the same as occurred in the homocolonial trials of Experiment 1 (38%), is\nsurprising given that, in Experiment 2, only one potential rescuer was present. That is,\nprevious research (Nowbahari et al., 2009, 2012) has shown that, often, at least several\nforagers must be present for rescue to be elicited, a condition that our field experiment\nessentially duplicated but which was not the case in Experiment 2. Nonetheless, and despite\nthis potential limitation, in the present experiment T. sp. E rescuers pulled on the limbs of\nnestmates held by a live predatory antlion and transported sand away from covered\nnestmates. In addition, T. sp. E rescuers responded to the predator by attacking it. Antlion\nattacks took several forms: Rescuers bit the antlion, attempted to dismember it by pulling\non its mandibles, and stung the antlion.\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\nFigure 3. The mean proportion of intervals in which Tetramorium sp. E rescuers engaged\nin each of three rescue behavior patterns\nNote: Error bars reflect \u00b1 standard error of the mean.\nAlthough our experimental procedure of rolling the victim prior to placement in the\npit not only prevented its escape, but also, more importantly, rendered it incapable of\naugmenting the efforts of the rescuer, four of the rescue attempts were successful in that the\nrescuer either pulled the victim out of the mandibles of the antlion or caused the antlion to\nopen its mandibles and release the victim. In several cases the antlion responded to the\nrescuer by abandoning the prey and burrowing under the sand, one of several ways that\nantlions circumvent the antipredator tactics of their prey (Eisner, Baldwin, and Conner,\n1993). Finally, in one trial, which clearly demonstrates the risk to rescuers' own safety, the\nvictim was released following a successful rescue attempt, whereupon the rescuer was\ngrabbed by the antlion and the original victim, now freed, began to pull on the limbs of the\ncaptured rescuer.\nThe purpose of this observational study was simply to determine whether the rescue\nbehavior patterns that occurred in Experiment 1 would be performed in an actual encounter\nwith a live predator. Interestingly, in Experiment 2 we observed attacks on the antlion itself\nin almost exactly the same proportion of intervals that we had observed snare biting in\nExperiment 1 (cf. Figures 2 and 3). Clearly, however, limb pulling, behavior that would\nappear to be the safest tactic for the rescuer because it could remain at some distance from\nthe predator, was the predominant behavior. Digging, which could have made the pit walls\nsteeper and thus exacerbated the problem \u00ad but in any case would not likely have aided the\nvictim \u00adwas never observed.\nGeneral Discussion\nTaken together these experiments demonstrate that at least one North American ant\nspecies, T. sp. E, is capable of providing precision rescue behavior for nestmates,\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\nexpanding the work of Nowbahari et al. (2009) and Hollis and Nowbahari (2013) on\nseveral Mediterranean species. Moreover, T. sp. E not only rescued nestmates, but also\nextended that same aid to conspecifics from other colonies, a significant departure from\nrescue behavior in Mediterranean ants, but which is consistent with the hypothesis that it\nmay have a unicolonial structure (Steiner et al., 2003). Finally, T. sp. E directly attacked\npredatory antlions, placing rescuers at very high risk of being captured themselves, as\nactually occurred in our observational study.\nWhenever T. sp. E provided rescue to distressed conspecifics, the rescue attempts\nappeared to be precisely directed to the actual threat. That is, when a piece of thread was\nthe restraining device, T. sp. E bit the thread, moved sand away from it, which exposed the\nthread further, and continued biting at the thread. When, however, an antlion's mandibles\nrestrained the victim, T. sp. E employed very different tactics, namely precisely directed\ndismembering and stinging behavior instead. Although precise rescue behavior in ants is\ncertainly the result of relatively simple behavioral algorithms, the underlying mechanisms\ncontrolling this behavior would seem to be a bit more complex than what would be needed\nto elicit digging and pulling. For example, a call-for-help signal, such as an ant alarm\ncould be used to alert conspecifics, producing frenetic movement in multiple directions as\nthe rescuer attempts to orient toward the source. After the rescuer detects the source, it then\nsimply follows the signal's sensory gradient until it makes contact with the victim. Then,\nonce contact has been made, involving, for example, a cuticular hydrocarbon recognition\nmechanism in ants (H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson, 1990; Howard, 1993; Howard and Blomquist,\n2005), the rescuer digs and pulls. It is difficult to see, however, how these kinds of simple\nreleasing mechanisms could guide ant rescuers to the precise location of whatever object is\nholding the victim in place, enable them to transport sand away from this object, exposing\nit further, and then to target their bites and stings to the object itself, transporting additional\nsand as necessary. Additional research is required to explore what appear to be more\ncomplex mechanisms.\nAlthough not all potential rescuers engaged in rescue behavior, it is likely either that\nsome critical threshold was not reached, or that some individuals are less capable of\nrescuing than others, as has been demonstrated in C. cursor (Nowbahari et al., 2012).\nSimilarly, in several species of social insects where extremely risky behaviors are a\npossible response to nest threats, some individuals perform self-preservation behaviors\neven when the nest is in direct danger (Shorter and Rueppell, 2012). Thus, our data, which\nrevealed that not all individuals help a conspecific and that victims sometimes are ignored,\ndo not detract from the finding that T. sp. E is capable of engaging in what appears to be an\neffective antipredator strategy.\nDespite the fact that colonies of P. imparis were found in the same general habitat\nas antlion pits, albeit not in close proximity to them, and that its small size would render it\neasy prey for antlions, this species rarely if ever engaged in rescue of any kind; moreover,\neven on the one occasion in which P. imparis ants did respond to a nestmate, they never\nexhibited snare biting or sand transport. These differences between species suggest that\nrescue behavior \u00ad or, at a very minimum, precision rescue behavior \u00ad is not necessarily a\ntrait found in all ant species. Thus, other ecological factors, which this study was not\nPrecision rescue behavior in North American ants\ndesigned to elucidate, must be influencing this behavior (but see Hollis and Nowbahari,\n2013, for a discussion of ecological variables associated with rescue behavior).\nNonetheless, our results provide evidence that there is variety in this trait, necessitating a\nbroader comparative study of rescue behavior in multiple species from different families.\nFinally, attempts to measure the true frequency of successful rescue behavior in the wild\nwould provide a deeper understanding, not only of the predator-prey relationship between\nants and antlions (Hollis, Cogswell, Snyder, Guillette, and Nowbahari, 2011; Hollis and\nGuillette, 2011; Lucas and Brockmann, 1981), but also of this extreme form of altruism \u00ad a\nbehavior that appears to have evolved in many animals.\n"
