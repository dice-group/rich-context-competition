The relationship of sleep to health has been an active area of research in recent years, and the National\nSocial Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) expanded sleep data collection in Wave 2 with enhanced core questions\nand a novel sleep module that included an objective measure of sleep duration and quality.\nMethod. A randomly selected one-third of Wave 2 participants and their spouses or coresident partners were invited to\nparticipate in the sleep module. Objective sleep data were collected using wrist actigraphy, an accelerometer that records\nan integrated measure of motion over short epochs (15 s each). This information is stored and subsequently analyzed to\ndetermine sleep and wake periods by epoch. Individuals were instructed to wear the actiwatches for 72hr. Several sleep\nparameters were derived from the accelerometer. Individuals concurrently kept a sleep diary.\nResults. Sleep actigraphy data were successfully collected from 780 individuals. Many of the survey-based and the\nactigraph-estimated sleep parameters varied by age and gender. However, age and gender patterns often differed for sleep\ncharacteristics that were both asked and measured, such as sleep duration.\nDiscussion. The survey and actigraphy data provide different information about sleep characteristics. The opportunity\nto examine actigraph-estimated sleep characteristics in a nationally representative sample of older adults allows novel\nanalyses of the associations of sleep parameters with social and health data.\nKey Words: Actigraphy--Sleep--Sleep duration--Sleep quality.\nSleep is a complicated behavior with multiple dimen-\nsions that include timing, duration, consolidation,\ndepth, and restfulness. Sleep characteristics vary from\nperson to person (Lauderdale et al., 2006; Nunes et al.,\nsleeping are common among older adults (Ancoli-Israel,\n2003). Although it seems intuitively obvious that sleep is\nessential to life, the physiological functions of sleep are not\nfully understood; this has been an active area of research in\nSleep has not historically been one of the lifestyle risk fac-\ntors routinely queried in population-based surveys and stud-\nies.Forexample,theannualNationalHealthInterviewSurvey\njust added sleep questions to the coreAdult Health Behaviors\nthere were a few large epidemiologic cohorts that included\none or more survey questions about sleep prior to 2000, nota-\nbly the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study\nI and II, the Nurses' Health Study, and the First National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic\nFollow-up Study (Ayas et al., 2003; Gangwisch, Malaspina,\nBoden-Albala, & Heymsfield, 2005; Kripke, Garfinkel,\nWingard, Klauber, & Marler, 2002). Analyses from these\nstudies have found that survey-based sleep characteristics\ncorrelate with many health outcomes, including mortality\n(Cappuccio, D'Elia, Strazzullo, & Miller, 2010; Gallicchio\n& Kalesan, 2009). Most sleep research in nonclinical popula-\ntions has been laboratory-based and included small numbers\nof volunteers. Such studies have identified potential mecha-\nnisms that could explain some of the correlations found\nbetween sleep and health in the cohort studies. For exam-\nple, laboratory-based experimental studies of younger adults\nhave indicated that there may be deleterious consequences\nof inadequate sleep across multiple physiological domains,\nincluding cognitive, metabolic, and immunologic (Faraut,\nBoudjeltia, Vanhamme, & Kerkhofs, 2012; Van Cauter,\nWave 2 of National Social Life, Health, and Aging\nProject (NSHAP) added a novel sleep module that included\nan objective measure of sleep as well as additional survey\nquestions; these are the first objective sleep data available\nfor a nationally representative sample of the population in\nthe United States. This paper will describe the survey ques-\ntions about sleep in the Wave 1 and Wave 2 core interviews,\nthe measurements included in the sleep module in Wave 2,\nand some suggestions for using them in analyses.\nLauderdale et al.\nWave 1 Sleep Data\nSurvey questions about sleep have most often assessed\nquantity, quality, or general satisfaction, frequently posed\nas \"feeling rested\" during the day. In the first wave of data\nfour questions in the core survey. These questions were\nasked of all participants. Sleep quantity was assessed with\nthe single question \"How many hours do you usually sleep\nat night?\" and response options were in whole hours. Sleep\nquality was included as part of the depression instrument, in\nwhich respondents were asked about the frequency of sev-\neral conditions, including \"My sleep was restless.\" Overall\nsatisfaction was assessed with the question \"How often do\nyou feel really rested when you wake up in the morning?\"\nwith four levels of response endorsement. Finally, in the\nsocial relationships section, there was a question about how\noften individuals with spouses or romantic partners slept in\nthe same bed as that person during the past month. Mean\nreported sleep duration from the single question was just\nunder 7hr and did not vary greatly by age or sex (Table 1).\nOnly about 60% reported feeling rested in the morning most\nof the time, and this also did not vary greatly by age or sex.\nRelatively few, however, reported that sleep was restless\nmost of the time (12%), and this also did not vary strongly\nby age or sex. The one sleep question with a strong age effect\nin Wave 1 was sleeping with a partner, which decreased by\nage, not only because fewer individuals had partners, but\nalso because those with partners were less likely to sleep\nin the same bed. Data are publicly available (NSHAP Wave\n1: Waite, Linda J., Edward O. Laumann, Wendy Levinson,\nStacy Tessler Lindau, and Colm A. O'Muircheartaigh.\nNational Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP):\nConsortium for Political and Social Research [distributor],\nWave 2 Sleep Data\nSurvey Questions in the Core Data Collection\nGrowing interest in sleep as a chronic disease risk factor\ncontributed to a decision to enhance sleep data collection in\nenhancements: (a) changes in the core sleep questions includ-\ning a different approach to querying typical sleep duration\nand a few additional questions and (b) inclusion of a new\nmodule, with an objective sleep measurement and sleep log,\noffered to a randomly selected one-third of respondents and\ntheir spouses or coresident partners. Data are publicly avail-\nable (NSHAP Wave 2: Waite, Linda J., Kathleen Cagney,\nWilliam Dale, Elbert Huang, Edward O. Laumann, Martha K.\nMcClintock, Colm A. O'Muircheartaigh, L. Phillip Schumm,\nand Benjamin Cornwell. National Social Life, Health, and\nAging Project (NSHAP):Wave 2 and Partner Data Collection.\nThe core sleep duration question was modified in\nresponse to accumulating evidence that single questions\nabout usual sleep duration are not highly correlated or\nwell calibrated with measured sleep duration for older\nTable 1. Sleep Questions in Wave 1 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (2005\u00ad2006)\nMeasure Overall\nMale Female\nHow many hours do you usually sleep at night?\nHow often do you feel really rested when you wake up in the morning?\nMy sleep was restless\nIn the last month, how often did you sleep in the same bed with your spouse or romantic partner?\nNote. All are proportions except where the mean is specified. Means and proportions are calculated using the sample weights, while the \"Number of observations\"\nis the unweighted number of respondents.\nAssessment of Sleep in the NSHAP\nadults, although self-reported duration does nonetheless\npredict many health outcomes (Ananthakrishnan et al.,\nCastill\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n-Mu\u00f1oz, L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda, & Rodr\u00edguez-\nArtalejo, 2013). Self-reported duration is typically longer\nthan sleep as measured by either actigraphy or polysom-\nnography, and the correlation between self-reported dura-\ntion and measured sleep is in the low to moderate range\n(Patel, Blackwell, Ancoli-Israel, & Stone, 2012; Silva\ndence of systematic biases in self-reported duration: for\nexample, those with more education have a higher corre-\nlation between reported and measured sleep compared to\nthose with less education (Lauderdale, Knutson, Yan, Liu,\nA few epidemiological cohorts of older adults have\nrecently added or included objective sleep measurements,\neither actigraphy, which estimates sleep based on arm\nmotion, or polysomnography, which defines sleep based\non electrical activity in the brain recorded by an electro-\nperfect measure of routine sleep behavior. They are imper-\nfect because: (a) actigraphy measures a physical state that\nis highly correlated with sleep but does not actually meas-\nure sleep and (b) polysomnography may alter sleep behav-\nior due to its intrusiveness and its need to be set up by a\ntechnician.\nThere has been very little methodological work about how\nbest to ask about sleep duration to optimize validity and reli-\nability. This is likely because asking about sleep duration in\nmore than one way in the same interview causes respondents,\nremembering their most recent answer, to be more consistent\nin their subsequent answers than they might be if differently\nworded questions were asked at different times. There are\nunderstandable reasons why habitual sleep duration questions\nmay be challenging for individuals to answer. A valid answer\ndraws on several cognitive domains. First, individuals must\nrealize that they need to carry out a mental arithmetic prob-\nlem in order to give an accurate answer. Then they need to\nfigure out the time when they typically fall asleep and when\nthey usually wake up--both of which may have great night-\nto-night variability. Finally, they must hold those numbers in\nmind and subtract in their head, a calculated difference that\noften spans midnight. It seems likely that many older individ-\nuals may have difficulty doing this or simply chose not to, and\ninstead respond with a number that seems plausible. In Wave\n2, NSHAP removed two potentially problematic aspects of\nthe duration question: realizing it is an arithmetic problem and\nmentally subtracting. Respondents were asked \"What time\ndo you usually go to bed and start trying to fall asleep?\" and\n\"What time do you usually wake up?\" These questions were\nasked separately for \"weekdays or work days\" and for \"week-\nends, or days off.\" Individuals responded with clock time,\nincluding hours, minutes, and a.m./p.m. The answers not only\nallow the calculation of usual sleep duration by the analyst,\nTable 2.

All are proportions except where the mean is specified. Means and proportions are calculated using the sample weights, while the \"Number of observations\"\nis the unweighted number of respondents.\nLauderdale et al.\nbut also make it possible to consider the circadian timing of\nusual sleep as an additional sleep characteristic.\nThe remaining three sleep questions from Wave 1 were\nrepeated in the Wave 2 core interview. There were also new\nquestions about sleep medications and naps in the Wave 2\ncore interview (Table 2). Average sleep duration calculated\nfrom the usual bedtime and waketime questions for week-\nthis increased with age for men but not for women. Overall,\n20% had taken sleep medications in the previous 2 weeks--\nthis was higher for women than men but did not vary with\nage. A majority of respondents had taken at least one nap\nduring the past week, and the frequency of naps increased\nwith age.\nThe Sleep Module\nA randomly selected one-third of the Wave 2 respond-\nents were invited to participate in the Sleep Module dur-\ning their in-home interview (Wave 1 respondents and their\nspouses/partners were selected independently). Altogether,\ncoresident partners) were invited to participate; of these,\n897 agreed to participate. The Module had two compo-\nhr of wrist actigraphy and a \"Sleep and Activity\nBooklet.\" For those who agreed, a date was set for sleep\ndata collection and the booklet and actigraph, along with a\nprepaid return mailer, were mailed out, usually a few days\nafter the in-home interview; 823 were successfully recon-\ntacted and received the packet. The booklet had two parts:\nadditional questions about sleep and a 3-day sleep log to\nbe filled out concurrently with wearing the wrist actigraph.\nSeven hundred and eighty-five booklets were ultimately\nreturned. Because the booklet was received a few days after\nthe interview, NSHAP had the opportunity to ask respond-\nents about sleep duration in two different ways without hav-\ning both in the same interview. The Wave 1 sleep duration\nquestion was repeated in the Sleep and Activity Booklet:\n\"How many hours do you usually sleep at night?\" There\nwere three additional sleep quality questions in the book-\nlet: (a) the frequency of having trouble falling asleep, (b)\nwaking up during the night, and (c) waking up too early\n(Table 3). These questions have previously been used in\nmany studies, including the Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) and the\nHealth and Retirement Survey (HRS). The mean sleep\nhours reported in the booklet, using the same wording as the\nWave 1 core question was 7.5hr, which decreased with age\nfor women, but not for men. Women were more likely than\nmen to report having trouble falling asleep. With increasing\nage, both men and women were more likely to report wak-\ning up during the night and waking up too early.\nThe booklet also contained a 3-day sleep log. For each of\nthe three 24-hr periods (within the 72hr) when the actigraph\nwas worn, individuals were asked to write down when they\nstarted trying to fall asleep, when they awoke, whether\nthey napped and for how long (within categories; variables\ndescribed in Table 4).\nActigraphy\nWrist actigraphy data were collected using the Actiwatch\nSpectrum model from Phillips Respironics; the manufac-\nturer loaned Actiwatches to NSHAP for this study through\ntheir grant review process. Actiwatches look like a digital\nwristwatch, but they include a highly sensitive accelerometer\nTable 3.

Counts of activi-\nties are recorded within prespecified epochs (15-s epochs\nwere used for NSHAP). Upon return of the Actiwatch,\ndata were downloaded and analyzed using manufacturer-\ndeveloped and tested algorithms that estimate several\nsleep parameters using the patterns of activity counts. This\nActiwatch Spectrum model includes additional features:\nmeasures of ambient and colored light and a detector of\nwhen the Actiwatch is on the wrist. There have been many\nvalidation studies of individuals concurrently wearing an\nactigraph (various manufacturers and models) and under-\ngoing polysomnography. However, most of these studies\nonly included a small number of subjects, often fewer than\n20, and focused on either a clinical population or a much\nyounger population. There have been several review arti-\ncles about the validation studies (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003;\nSadeh & Acebo, 2002; Van de Water, Holmes, & Hurley,\nthe overall correlation in sleep duration for adults is about\nthe accuracy of actigraphy, compared with polysomnogra-\nphy, depended on the sleep variable, the manufacturer of the\ndevice and the study population. Among the few studies of\nolder, community-dwelling adults, a study of 36 postmeno-\npausal women reported correlations over 0.9 for total sleep\ntimeandsleepefficiency(Jean-Louis,Kripke,Cole,Assmus,\n& Langer, 2001). More recently, a very large study of older\nmen compared different actigraphy scoring algorithms to\npolysomnography and found only moderate correlations\nfor the best of the algorithms (Blackwell, Ancoli-Israel,\nRedline, Stone, & Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS)\nStudy Group, 2011). In general, actigraphy overestimates\nsleep relative to polysomnography, as still awake time tends\nto be scored as sleep. In addition, Phillips Respironics has\ncompiled a bibliography of validation studies using their\nhealthcare.philips.com/us_en/homehealth/sleep/actiwatch/\ndefault.wpd). Details about the Actiware 5.5 software are\navailable from http://www.learnactiware.com/tutorials/ and\nthe user manual is available online at www.camntech.com/\nfiles/The_Actiwatch_User_Manual_V7.2.pdf.\nIndividuals were asked to wear theActiwatch for 72hr; the\nActiwatch records the time and date. The devices were sent\nout on all weekdays, and the participants were asked to start\nwearing the watch the day they received it, which was always\na weekday because of the type of delivery. The model also\nincludes an event marker and participants were asked to push\nit both when they started trying to fall asleep each night and\nwhen they awoke fully for the day. The event marker leaves\na time stamp but does not affect recording, which was set to\nbegin automatically during the morning of the day when the\nparticipant received the instrument and record continuously\nthereafter.The actigraphy data may be fully analyzed whether\nor not the event marker was pressed; the event markers supply\nadditional information about the individual's sleep-related\nbehavior. Six hundred and fifty-five individuals remembered\nto use the event marker at the beginning and 674 remem-\nbered to use it at the end of at least one night. Some analyses\nmay need to be restricted to nights with event markers. For\nexample, an analysis of sleep latency would be restricted to\nnights with an evening event marker, whereas an analysis\nof consistency of bedtime might be restricted to individuals\nwith all three evening event markers. The main rest interval\n(which contains not only the sleep interval but also the time\nspent falling asleep and waking up) for each individual was\nfirst set by the manufacturer's software to capture the long-\nest sleep interval each day, based on the activity pattern. The\nrest intervals were then manually reexamined and reset if the\ninterval set by the software failed to fully include the longest\nsleep interval, defined by the activity pattern. For example,\nthe software sometimes only included part of the night when\nthere was a long awake episode during the night. Additional\ndata used for setting the rest interval were the event marker\nand the light level, which typically indicated when the lights\nwere turned off. When present, the event marker was pri-\noritized unless it was inconsistent with the other pieces of\nevidence, because it appeared that individuals occasionally\nforgot to press the event marker and then thought to press it if\nthey awoke during the night.\nActigraphy Results\nActigraphs with data were returned by 793 individu-\nals. However, for 13 of them, the data could not be used to\ndetermine sleep statistics, for reasons such as no discernable\nrest interval, resulting in usable data from 780 individuals.\napproximately aged 62\u00ad90 during Wave 2 data collection,\ndata presented in Table 6 includes only the primary respond-\nents and the spouses/partners whose birth years were in\nthe range included in the primary respondent sample (174\nspouses/partners). However, analyses with actigraphy data\nTable 4.

Each question is asked for each of three 24-hr periods, concurrent\nwith wearing an Actigraph.\nLauderdale et al.\ncould include a more extended age range among the spouses.\nFor the small number of individuals with fewer than three\nusable nights of actigraphy data, the summary means include\none or two nights, as available. For each individual, the pub-\nlic release dataset includes sleep parameters for up to three\nindividual nights and also provides means across nights.\nThe definitions of the actigraphy-estimated sleep charac-\nteristics are given in Table 5, and the averages for the sleep\ncharacteristics included in the public release data are given\nin Table 6. The public use file also includes the nightly data.\nSeveral variables are based on the definition of each epoch\nas sleep or not, which is a function of the activity count in\nthat epoch and surrounding epochs. \"Assumed sleep\" is the\nlength of the interval that begins with the first epoch scored\nas \"sleep\" in the major sleep interval and ends with the last\nepoch scored as \"sleep.\" \"Actual sleep\" is the total duration\nof the epochs scored as sleep within the assumed sleep inter-\nval. Wake after sleep onset, referred to as WASO, is the total\nminutes awake during the assumed sleep interval. \"Percent\nsleep\" is the percent of the assumed sleep interval that is\nactual sleep. Additional variables are the clock times at the\nbeginning and end of the assumed sleep interval, the day of\nthe week of each sleep interval and the fragmentation index.\nFragmentation is an indicator of sleep disruption and is the\nsum of two percentages: the percentage of the sleep interval\nspent moving and the percentage of immobile periods (i.e.,\ncontiguous epochs with no movement) that are no more than\none minute long. Although there is no clear definition of\nwhat \"sleep quality\" is, WASO, fragmentation, and percent\nsleep are each thought of as quality indicators.\nFor the full sample of individuals with birth years 1920\u00ad\nhr (Table 6). This\nwas higher for women than men and there was a slight trend\ntoward longer assumed sleep with increasing age.Actual sleep\nhr, and this increased with age for men but not\nfor women, with the mean being higher for women than men\nat younger ages but similar in the oldest age group. WASO\naveraged 39min, and this increased with age for men but not\nfor women. The mean fragmentation index was higher for\nmen than women in each age group and increased with age for\nmen. Percent sleep averaged 82% overall and decreased with\nage for both men and women. Figure 1 shows the distribu-\ntion of actigraphy-estimated average sleep durations (\"actual\nsleep\") by hours of self-reported sleep (from the single ques-\ntion \"How many hours do you usually sleep at night?\"). This\ngraph shows that there is not a high correlation between the\nself-reported and actigraph-estimated durations.\nDiscussion\nNSHAP greatly expanded the opportunities to investigate\nhypotheses related to sleep in the Wave 2 data collection.\nTable 6.

WASO = wake after sleep onset.\nAssessment of Sleep in the NSHAP\nA few additional questions were added to the Wave 2 core\nquestionnaire, but the more important additions were in the\nrandomly selected one-third sleep module that successfully\ncollected an objective measure of sleep, wrist actigraphy. The\nsleep module also included a 3-day sleep log and several addi-\ntional survey questions. There is, however, no perfect way to\nmeasure sleep, and the actigraphy-derived variables should be\nthought of as estimates of sleep parameters. Because NSHAP\nalso collected survey-based sleep characteristics, the data pro-\nvide diverse opportunities to compare both ways of measuring\nsleep characteristics and examine how each relates to social\nfactors, biomarkers, and health. Finding differences between\nsurvey responses and an objective measure is not unique to\nsleep: Differences have similarly been found between self-\nreported physical disabilities and performance-based meas-\nures, with both independently predicting short-term mortality\nand nursing home admission (Guralnik et al., 1994).\nThere are important limitations to the actigraphy data.\nWe only collected data during a 72-hr interval based on\nconcerns that compliance would suffer with a longer pro-\ntocol. Given the amount of day-to-day variability in sleep,\na longer interval would provide a better estimate of the\nindividual's underlying mean and also permit additional\nwithin-respondent analyses of variability (Rowe et al.,\n2008). However, 3-day data collection is probably less of\na limitation in this mostly retired population than among\nyounger, working adults. For example, we did not find any\nevidence of a day-of-the-week effect, which is usually seen\nin working age or school age populations. Another limita-\ntion is that the data do not support the calculation of sleep\nlatency for all individuals and all nights. Sleep latency is\nthe amount of time it takes an individual to fall asleep ini-\ntially after she or he begins to try falling asleep. It is dif-\nficult to determine when an individual began trying to fall\nasleep unless the event marker was used, which was only\ntrue 84% of the nights. Finally, while there are 195 couples\nwhere both partners provided actigraphy data but the data\nwere not collected contemporaneously, thereby preclud-\ning an hour-by-hour analysis of how one partner's sleep or\nsleep quality affects the other. This was done to avoid the\npossibility of the actiwatches being inadvertently switched\nwere they sent to both members of a couple at the same\ntime.\nSuggestions for Analysis\nThe public use actigraphy data file includes the day of the\nweek for each for the three nights.\nFor each night, there are five variables derived from\nactigraphy, listed in Table 5, which also includes the cor-\nresponding variable name. In addition, the sleep log bed-\ntime and waketime are included for each night, both on a\n1,440min basis beginning at noon (log_bed and log_wake).\nFinally, there is a nap variable for each day (log_nap).\nMost analyses will want to use the mean values across\nnights, although estimates of variability across the three\nnights may also be of interest. Caution should be used when\nincluding more than one of the actigraph sleep variables\nin the same statistical model because they are all interre-\nlated and almost all are strongly correlated with each other.\nSpecifically, note that acti_sleep and waso sum to assumed_\nsleep, and that percent_sleep is the ratio of acti_sleep and\nassumed_sleep.\nFigure 1. The distribution of the actigraph-estimated sleep duration (\"actual sleep\") by hours of self-reported sleep in response to the question \"How many hours\ndo you usually sleep at night?\" For each boxplot, the central line is the median and the top and bottom of the box represent the interquartile range. Outliers are marked\nas small circles. These data are unweighted.\nLauderdale et al.\nAnalysis of changes in sleep quantity and quality from\nWave 1 to Wave 2 are limited by the changes in how the\nsleep data were collected, and the relative paucity of sleep\nquestions in Wave 1. Comparisons of the three questions\nasked identically in the two waves are straightforward.\nHowever, comparisons of self-reported sleep hours across\nwaves are necessarily limited because the duration data\nwere collected differently in the Wave 2 core. Investigators\nmay want to consider whether a crosswalk can be developed\nbetween the single question and the sleep duration derived\nfrom the usual bedtime/waketime questions in the Wave 2\ncore by investigating the responses to the single question in\nthe Sleep and Activity Booklet for in Wave 2.\nThe enhanced sleep data in Wave 2 of NSHAP, com-\nbined with the rich survey and biomarker data, should allow\nresearchers to advance our knowledge of how objective and\nsurvey-based measures of sleep relate to health and aging.\nFunding\nThe National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project is supported by the\nNational Institutes of Health, including the National Institute on Aging\nthe Office of AIDS Research, and the Office of Behavioral and Social\nble for the data collection.
