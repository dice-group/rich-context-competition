This study identified different types of caregivers who provide care to older African Americans, the types of\ncaregiving structures created to provide care, and the factors that help predict caregiving structures.\nMethods. A community sample of 330 caregivers caring for 202 elderly African Americans was used. Multinomial logistic\nregression predicted what type of caregiving structure was created by families to provide care to older relatives.\nResults. Three types of caregivers were identified: 187 primary caregivers, who were connected to 79 secondary caregivers\nand 49 tertiary caregivers. Fifteen tertiary-only caregivers who were not connected to other caregivers were identified. Five\ncaregiving structures were found: (i) primary, secondary, and tertiary, (ii) primary and secondary, (iii) primary and tertiary, (iv)\nprimary only, and (v) tertiary-only. Characteristics of care recipients were predictive of caregiving structures.\nDiscussion. Different types of caregivers with distinct roles and responsibilities provided care within defined caregiving\nstructures to olderAfrican American family members. Caregiving structures may be individualistic (only one caregiver) or col-\nlectivist (two or more caregivers). Caregiving structure is predicted by the care recipients' conditions and situations, but not\nthose of the primary caregiver.\nTN the reviews on caregiving to elderly people, limited find-\nX ings are available on caregiving in ethnic minority groups\nSchultz, Visintainer, & Williamson, 1990). In addition, few\nfindings are available on caregiving issues beyond those of the\nknown about how families make use of multiple caregivers who\ncreate distinct structures of care for elderly relatives. We be-\nlieve, as Keith (1995) suggested, that caregiving to older people\ncan be understood more clearly by changing the approach; that\nis, by expanding the focus of caregiving studies from just the\nprimary caregiver to examining how families organize the struc-\nture of care when caring for dependent members. Therefore,\nrather than continuing to study the caregiving dyad (care recipi-\nent and primary caregiver), we examine the multiple types of\ncaregivers and the various ways in which care is given to older\npeople. As Pyke and Bengtson (1996) suggest, this approach\ncan show whether families create individualistic or collectivist\nsystems of care to address older relatives' needs.\nFindings show that the incidence of severe functional limita-\ntions among olderAfrican Americans (40%) is higher than among\nWhites (27%; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1995), that the rate of\ninstitutionalization for African Americans is less than hah0 the rate\nfor Whites (Belgrave, Wykle, & Choi, 1993), and that African\nAmerican families make limited use of formal services to assist\nwith caregiving (Caserta, Lund, Wright, & Redburn, 1987; Logan\n& Spitze, 1994). In light of these findings, there is a need to study\nhow African American families provide care to older relatives be-\nyond a single caregiver. Accordingly, in this study we address\nthree major questions: (a) Do older African Americans receive\ncare from different types of caregivers who have different levels of\nresponsibility and who provide different amounts of care? (b) Are\nthe different types of caregivers in African American families or-\nganized to form distinct structures through which care is pro-\nvided? (c) Which factors best predict what structures of care are\nused by caregivers to provide care to olderAfrican Americans?\nTypes ofCaregivers\nIn this study we distinguished the different types of caregivers\nby their level of responsibility and caregiving tasks. Primary\ncaregivers were identified by care recipients or their proxies and\nwere verified by the caregivers. They had the highest level of re-\nsponsibility regarding care and performed the largest number of\ncaregiving tasks. Primary caregivers provided care alone or in\nconjunction with other helpers. Secondary caregivers were iden-\ntified by the primary caregiver as persons who performed tasks\nat a level similar to that of the primary caregiver, but without the\nsame level of responsibility. Therefore, secondary caregivers\nwere not in charge of making decisions about the care recipi-\nent's support and care and only provided care in conjunction\nwith primary caregivers. Tertiary caregivers were usually identi-\nfied by the primary caregiver and provided care with the pri-\nmary caregiver. These caregivers had little or no responsibility\nfor making decisions regarding the care recipient; they per-\nformed specialized tasks such as grocery shopping, yard work,\nor paying bills. Some tertiary caregivers, however, provided care\nin the absence of other caregivers, typically to high-functioning\nolder people. Similar to primary caregivers, these tertiary care-\ngivers were identified by the care recipients or their proxies.\nCaregiving Structures\nWe proposed that caregivers would create various structures of\ncare, which would differ according to the type and combination\nof caregivers, that provide varying degrees of care and support to\nolder relatives. Although it would have been ideal to include all\npossible combinations of caregiving structures that included vari-\nous numbers and configurations of caregivers in this article, we\nwere only interested in examining whether a primary caregiver\nhad at least one secondary and/or tertiary caregiver who provided\nthem with the most assistance among all other caregivers in their\nsupport network. We believed this approach would provide an\navailable sample of caregiving structures for analysis. Therefore,\nprimary caregivers could work either alone (primary-only) or in\ncombination with others (primary and secondary; primary and\ntertiary; or primary, secondary, and tertiary). Secondary care-\ngivers worked only in combination with others (primary and sec-\nondary; or primary, secondary, and tertiary). Tertiary caregivers\ncould work either with others (primary and tertiary; or primary,\nsecondary, and tertiary) or alone (referred to as tertiary-only).\nHypotheses about caregiver structures.--Based on previous\nliterature, we have five hypotheses about caregiving structures.\nFirst, care recipients with the highest levels of dependency, as\nevidenced by their need for assistance with activities of daily\nliving (ADLs), would receive care in larger structures (e.g., pri-\nmary, secondary, and tertiary vs primary-only, primary and ter-\ntiary, primary and secondary, or tertiary-only; Litwak, 1985;\nStoller & Pugliesi, 1991). Second, care recipients with limited\nfinancial resources, as evidenced by their inability to meet their\nfinancial obligations, would receive care in smaller structures\nMurrell & Norris, 1991). Third, the greater the care recipients'\nuse of formal support services--situations that most often indi-\ncate greater frailty and dependency--the more likely that care\nwould be provided in larger as opposed to smaller structures\n(e.g., primary, secondary, and tertiary vs primary-only). Fourth,\ncare recipients with the greatest number of children living\nwithin one hour's drive would have larger caregiving structures\n(Himes, Jordan, & Farkas, 1996). Finally, caregivers coresiding\nwith the care recipient (Soldo, Wolf, & Agree, 1990; Ward,\nLogan, & Spitze, 1992), working full-time (Starrels, Ingersoll-\nDayton, Dowler, & Neal, 1997), experiencing distress in their\nrole as a caregiver, or suffering physical health problems would\ngive care in larger structures (e.g., primary, secondary, and ter-\ntiary) than the caregivers without these characteristics.\nMETHODS\nSampling Procedures\nThis study included olderAfrican Americans who were mem-\nbers of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiological\nStudies of the Elderly (EPESE; Cornoni-Huntley, Blazer,\nService, & Farmer, 1990). Two criteria were used to select older\nteria included an inability to perform two or more basic activities\nof daily living (Branch, Katz, Kniepmann, & Papsidero, 1984)\nand/or a score of 3 or more (indicating mild to severe cognitive\nimpairment) on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire\n(SPMSQ; Pfeiffer, 1975). Four hundred ninety-seven African\nAmerican elders met these criteria, but only 234 were available\nwhen this study began. Most of the attrition resulted from deaths.\nAll 234 elderly participants or their proxy respondents were\nour study and how we obtained their names, addresses, and\nphone numbers. A follow-up screening telephone interview\nwith the elderly participants or proxy respondents was con-\nducted to determine whether there was a main caregiver who\nprovided them with the most support and care. If identified, that\nperson was contacted by phone to verify his or her caregiving\nroles and responsibilities, and an in-person interview was\nscheduled. If there were any discrepancies in identifying and\nverifying the main caregiver, the care recipient was contacted\nagain. In the few cases in which this occurred, we were able to\nidentify the appropriate main caregiver. Ten percent of the 234\nmain caregivers refused to participate, 2% could not be con-\ntacted, and 2% of the care recipients had died or were institu-\ntionalized. As a result, 202 main caregivers were interviewed\n(187 primary and 15 tertiary-only caregivers). We asked the pri-\nmary caregivers whether there was one secondary and/or tertiary\ncaregiver who provided the greatest amount of help in assisting\nthem in their caregiving role. From this group, 79 secondary and\n49 tertiary caregivers were interviewed. Thus, our total sample\nMeasures\nThe measure of caregiving structure consisted of five categories\nreflecting combinations of types of caregivers identified in the\nstudy: (i) primary, secondary, and tertiary, (ii) primary and sec-\nondary; (iii) primary and tertiary; (iv) primary-only; and (v) ter-\ntiary-only. To assess the level of dependency among care recipi-\nents, we used the Duke OARS 6-item physical ADL subscale,\nwhich had a Cronbach's alpha of .77 (Fillenbaum, 1988). Degree\nof assistance with support on this scale ranged from 2 (unable to\nperform tasks) to 0 (able to perform tasks without help). We as-\nsessed financial status by care recipients' reports on whether the\namount of money they possess meets their needs poorly, fairly\nwell, or very well. The number of children living within a one-hour\ndrive of the care recipient was measured as a continuous variable.\nTo measure care recipients' use of formal support services (e.g., de-\nlivered meals, physical therapy, or homemaker service), we asked\nprimary caregivers to indicate whether the care recipients used any\nof 16 different formal support services within the past month.\nThese were summed to indicate the total number of services used.\nCoresidence was defined as living with the care recipient (coded 1)\nor not living with care recipient (coded 0). Employment was mea-\nsured as employed (coded 1) or not employed (coded 0). We mea-\nsured caregivers' functional health using a 10-item subscale from\nthe Rand Health Survey. Scores were converted to percentiles rang-\ning from 0 to 100, with higher percentiles indicating better health\n(McHorney, Ware, Lu, & Sherbourne, 1994). Cronbach's alpha\nwas .91. We measured caregiver distress by dichotomizing the\nGlobal Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI;\nDerogatis & Spencer, 1982). The BSI subscales had Cronbach's\nalphas ranging from .71 to .90. Caregivers were classified as dis-\ntressed if they had a T score of 63 or greater on two or more of the\nnine subscales.\nRESULTS\nCare Recipients\nThere were 42 male and 160 female African American care re-\ncipients. The average age was 74. More than 75% were unmar-\nried, with the majority being widowed. The average number of\nADL limitations, as reported by the main caregivers, was 2.4.\nForty-three percent of the care recipients were cognitively im-\npaired. More than half (58%) of the care recipients lived with their\nprimary caregiver and only 2% lived more than 30 minutes away.\nNone of the tertiary-only caregivers lived with the care recipients.\nCaregivers\nAs shown in Table 1, we found four different types of care-\ngivers. These were 187 primary caregivers, 79 secondary care-\ngivers, 49 tertiary caregivers, and 15 tertiary-only caregivers.\nTertiary caregivers had provided care for a longer time (10.6\nyears) man either primary, secondary, or tertiary-only caregivers\n(8.7 years, 7.1 years, and 3.2 years, respectively). Most of the\ncaregivers had moderate functional health with mean scores\nThe majority of the caregivers were middle-aged adult (55\nyears old) daughters of the care recipients. Almost four times as\nTable 1.

Wives were more likely than husbands to be\nproviders of care to a spouse. Unlike primary caregivers, the sec-\nondary, tertiary, and tertiary-only caregivers included paid helpers\n(22%, 8%, and 40%, respectively). Caregivers were more likely to\nbe unmarried (57% were divorced, widowed, or never married)\nthan married. The majority (more than 55%) of the caregivers had\nat least a high school education. Seventy-four percent of the pri-\nmary caregivers had an annual personal income of $15,000 or\nless. Although personal incomes were somewhat higher for all\nother caregivers, approximately one third had annual incomes of\nthe secondary, tertiary, and tertiary-only caregivers.\nPredicting Caregiving Structures\nFive caregiving structures were identified: primary and sec-\nondary (33%); primary, secondary, and tertiary (25%); primary-\nonly (19%); primary and tertiary (16%); and tertiary-only (7%).\nFor the multivariable analyses, the tertiary-only structures\n(N=15) were dropped because of their small number. Further-\nmore, we combined the primary-only and primary and tertiary\nstructures because the frequency of each was small (31 and 39,\nrespectively); the only difference between them was the pres-\nence of a tertiary caregiver who performed specialized tasks to\nsupport the primary caregiver in the primary and tertiary struc-\nture. Given the limited amount of assistance a tertiary caregiver\nmay provide, we believed that the coefficients on the variables\nused to predict these structures would not differ significantly.\nGuided by our hypotheses, we considered eight predictors\nreflecting the needs and conditions of care recipients and care-\ngivers. The four predictors for care recipients included ADL\nstatus, level of formal support, doing well versus doing poorly\nin meeting theirfinancialneeds, and the number of children liv-\ning within one hour's drive of the care recipient. The four care-\ngiver predictors included living versus not living with the care\nrecipient, distressed versus not distressed, employed versus not\nemployed, and the level of functional health. We tested for multi-\ncollinearity by examining correlations among the predictor vari-\nables. None were found to be significantly related.\nTo assess the effect of the predictor variables, we estimated\nmodels using multinomial logistic regression. This procedure\nsimultaneously estimates the effects of the predictors on the\nprobability of belonging to the reference category (primary,\nsecondary, and tertiary) as compared with each of the other cat-\negories of the dependent variable (primary-only/primary and\ntertiary, and primary and secondary). However, according to\nConcato, Feinstein, and Holford (1993), the results of logistic\nregression models possessing fewer than 10 outcome events per\nindependent variable may be questionable as to accuracy, and\nthe tests of significance may be invalid. Therefore, because of\nour small sample size in the primary, secondary, and tertiary\nstructure, we performed the analyses in two steps. First, we\nused bivariate analyses to determine the relationship between\ncaregiving structure and each of the eight variables. Second, we\nperformed multinomial logistic regression using only the sig-\nnificant predictors from the bivariate analyses.\nIn the bivariate analyses, we found that all four of the vari-\nables on the care recipients were significant, but none of the\ncaregiver variables were significant. Therefore, our multivari-\nTable 2.

The model shows that as a care recipient's ADL level\nincreases, the caregiving structure is less likely to be primary-\nonly/primary and tertiary, or a primary and secondary, than a\nprimary, secondary, and tertiary structure. As the care recipi-\nent's use of formal support increases, care is less likely to be\nprovided in a primary-only/primary and tertiary, or primary and\nsecondary structure, than a primary, secondary, and tertiary\nstructure. If the care recipient does poorly in meeting financial\nneeds (vs not doing poorly), the caregiving structure is more\nlikely to be primary-only/primary and tertiary, or primary and\nsecondary, than primary, secondary, and tertiary. As the number\nof children living within one hour's drive of the care recipient\nincreases, care is less likely to be provided in a primary-\nonly/primary and tertiary structure, than a primary, secondary,\nand tertiary structure. However, there was no difference in\nwhether care was provided in a primary and secondary versus a\nprimary, secondary, and tertiary structure based on the number\nof children living within one hour's drive.\nDISCUSSION\nWe found, as others have reported (Burton & Dilworth-\ndependent family members in African American families in-\nvolves different types of caregivers. In this study, we identified\nand labeled these various caregivers as primary, secondary, and\ntertiary based on their roles and responsibilities. The main care-\ngivers were organized into five caregiving structures (primary,\nsecondary, and tertiary; primary and secondary; primary and\ntertiary; primary-only; and tertiary-only), which are similar to\nthose described by Keith (1995) and by Pyke and Bengston\n(1996). Like those researchers, we found both individualistic\n(involving one caregiver) and collectivist (involving two or\nmore caregivers) caregiving structures. However, almost three\nfourths (74%) of the structures were collectivist in that they\nwere formed by two or more caregivers.\nAs expected, care recipients with greater dependency were\nmore likely cared for in larger structures. Care recipients in poor\nfinancial condition were less likely to be cared for in larger struc-\ntures. This is consistent with previous reports which show that\nwhen family members' financial resources are limited, they\noften have smaller levels of support available than do those with\nmorefinancialmeans (Benin & Keith, 1995; Murrell & Norris,\n1991). In agreement with yet other findings (Dwyer & Miller,\nwas important. The greater the number of children living within\none hour's drive, the more likely caregivers tended to use struc-\ntures with larger levels of support.\nWe found no support for our hypothesis that the caregivers'\ncharacteristics would help to predict caregiving structure. We\nbelieve that these characteristics were not significant predictors,\nin contrast to those reported in the caregiving literature on pre-\ndominantly White samples, because they may not represent the\nissues that are best suited for predicting caregiving structures\namong African Americans. For example, historical evidence on\nAfrican American families helps to clarify why coresidence did\nnot predict caregiving structure in this study. Historians such as\nreport that African Americans share households not only for\neconomic reasons, but also for cultural reasons, such as shared\nvalues and beliefs about closeness and connectedness. We be-\nlieve that these values and beliefs may create norms regarding\nhousehold sharing in the African American culture and thus\nmay reduce the stress and strain found in other groups residing\ntogether. Nevertheless, we agree with other researchers\n(Aquillo, 1990; Peek, Coward, & Peek, in press) that further re-\nsearch is needed to explain why coresidence is more prevalent\namong older African Americans than in other groups and to ac-\ncount for the effect of coresidence on caregivers' outcomes. In\nfact, further studies with larger samples are needed for examin-\ning the full range of caregiving structures and testing our beliefs\nthat the effects of the independent variables in predicting care-\ngiving structure are not statistically different for primary-only\nand primary and tertiary structures. A larger sample would also\nprovide the opportunity to examine the predictors of the ter-\ntiary-only caregiving structure.\nThe major strengths of this study are that we identified the\ndifferent types of caregivers providing care to older dependent\nAfrican Americans according to their roles and responsibilities\nand the amount of care they provided. We also identified care-\ngiving structures (individualistic and collectivist) that caregivers\nuse when providing care. Although we cannot make any con-\nclusions about how different the types of caregivers and care-\ngiving structures identified in this study are from those that may\nexist among other racial and ethnic groups, our findings can\nprovide information that can be used in future comparative\nstudies. Further, we make no claim that all African American\nfamilies with dependent elders use multiple caregivers and that\nfamilies organize themselves through defined caregiving struc-\ntures when providing care. We do, however, purport that the\ni\nfindings reported in this study reflect and support the cultural\nlegacy of extended family caregiving to dependent family\nmembers in African American families. In this instance, elderly\ndependent members are most often cared for by two or more\npeople whose roles and responsibilities address their needs.\n"
