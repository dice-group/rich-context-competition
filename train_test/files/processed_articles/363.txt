    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Each year the American Cancer Society compiles estimates of the number of new\ncancer cases and deaths expected in the US in the current year and the most recent data on\ncancer incidence, mortality, and survival. An estimated 1,268,000 new cases of cancer will be\ncancer incidence and death rates have continued to decrease in men and women since the early\n1990s, and the decline in overall cancer mortality has been greater in recent years. Despite\nreductions in age-adjusted rates of cancer death, the total number of recorded cancer deaths in\nthe US continues to increase, due to an aging and expanding population. Large disparities in\ncancer incidence and mortality across racial/ethnic groups continue. Black men and women\nexperience higher incidence of cancer and poorer survival than white men and women. The\ndisparity in survival reflects both diagnosis of cancer at later disease stages, and poorer survival\nDr. Greenlee was Program Director\nfor Cancer Surveillance in the\nDepartment of Epidemiology and\nSurveillance Research, American\nCancer Society, Atlanta, GA.

These estimates may vary\nconsiderably from year to year, particularly for\nless common cancers and for states with\nsmaller populations. We discourage the use of\nthese estimates to track year-to-year changes\nin cancer occurrence and death. The recorded\nnumber of cancer deaths and cancer death\nrates from the National Center for Health\nStatistics, and SEER cancer incidence rates are\ngenerally more informative statistics for\ntracking cancer trends. For example, breast\ncancer incidence rates increased about 1% per\n1996. Despite the stabilization of incidence\nrates during the latter time period, the\nestimates of new breast cancer cases continued\nto the residual effects of the strong rate\nOur estimates are based on the most\ncurrently available cancer mortality and\nincidence data; however, these data are three\nand four years old, respectively, at the time that\nthe estimates are calculated. As such, the effect\nof large changes occurring in the three or four-\ncannot be captured by our modeling efforts.\nFinally, our estimates of new cancer cases are\nbased on incidence rates for the geographic\nlocations that participate in the SEER program\nand, therefore, may not be representative of the\ntotal US.\nDespite these limitations, the American\nCancer Society estimates do provide evidence\nof the current patterns of cancer incidence and\nmortality in the US. Such estimates will assist\nour continuing efforts to reduce the public\nhealth burden of cancer in 21st century.
