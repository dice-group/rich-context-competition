While an indicator of confusion,\nrecognition false alarms do not tell the entire story regarding\nmemory for sponsor\u00adevent relationships. In two experiments\nusing press release announcements about sponsored events,\nfree recall results show relatively good memory for spon-\nsors, and that under certain conditions, the mention of direct\ncompetitors can actually facilitate recall of true sponsors and\nevents. The findings point to the importance of understand-\ning the memory-based characteristics of measurement as\nwell as to the memory-supported decision-making tasks that\nsponsorship information might eventually influence. Need-\nless to say, these findings also raise several interesting future\nresearch questions. In particular, the findings suggest a role\nin sponsorship-linked communications for \"episodic-seman-\ntic constellations\" that may naturally arise as exposure to\nsponsorship-linked communications is combined with\nsemantic knowledge.\nMarketing practitioners, in response to increasingly\nfragmented media markets, are rapidly evolving a set of\nmarketing communication strategies that have been labeled\nindirect marketing (Cornwell, 2008). These indirect market-\ning communications are typically embedded in consumer\nexperiences and include sponsorship of sports and events;\nbrand placement in programs, movies, and computer games;\nambient marketing; and various forms of electronic\ncommunication (de Pelsmacker & Neijens, 2012). Of these,\nsponsorship currently takes the largest share of communica-\n(International Events Group, 2011). Moreover, this figure\nmost likely underestimates the importance of sponsorship in\nattempting to reach consumers because it does not include\nthe traditional advertising and promotion that is themati-\ncally tied to sponsorship. Given that marketers expect that\nconsumer awareness is influenced by sponsorship commu-\nnications, and that marketers also believe that image and\ngoodwill toward their brand can be influenced by learning\nabout sponsor\u00adevent relationships, we need to understand\nhow consumers remember these communications.\nUnfortunately, in this loosely coupled relationship between\nevent and brand, confusion may arise. Indeed, the business\npress is awash with disconcerting reports of sponsor mis-\nidentification. The objectives of this article are to examine\nhow it is that memory confusion is currently addressed in\nthe sponsorship literature, to learn what is typically held in\nmemory, and to consider the influence of competitive men-\ntions on recall for sponsorship relationships.\nMemory for Sponsorship\nRelationships\nTable 1 offers a review of selected sponsorship-related\nstudies that measure memory.

Table 1 will be a reference for\nthe following sections.\nAmbushing\nOne of the most important strategic sources of potential\nconfusion in sponsoring is ambushing by another company,\noftentimes a direct competitor. Sandler and Shani (1989)\ndefined ambushing as the efforts of an organization to asso-\nciate itself with an event in the hope of reaping the benefits\nof an official sponsor. The success of ambushing attempts in\nterms of outcome variables of interest (e.g., awareness of\nambusher brand stemming from the ambushing activity),\nalthough richly discussed in the business press and academic\nwritings, offers less in terms of clear empirical support.\nMany field studies do not have adequate control over expo-\nsure to allow ambushing to be documented as the source of\nmemory confusion. Table 1 offers two experimental studies\nof the memory effects from ambushing advertisements.\nKinney and McDaniel (1996) pitted early sponsorship-\nlinked advertising for the true sponsor of the Olympics\nagainst actual ambusher advertising by direct competitors.\nTheir findings demonstrated that sponsors (with a clear\nOlympic association) and ambushers (with an implied\nOlympic association) were equally well recalled and ascribed\nas sponsors. In their research, study participants were not\nmade aware within the experiment of the true sponsorship\nstatus, thus participants were easily duped by marketing\ncommunications into believing that the ambushers were true\nsponsors.\nHumphreys, Cornwell, et al. (2010) examined the mem-\nory effects of counterambushing communications. On one\nhand, transgressed true sponsors are known to invoke a\n\"name and shame\" strategy (Farrelly, Quester, & Greyser,\n2005) to discredit ambushers; on the other hand, Cornwell,\nWeeks, and Roy (2005) have suggested that the often whim-\nsical and fun nature of ambushing may lead to positive affect\nfor ambushers and potentially distinctive memories.\nImportantly, counterambushing messages are an additional\ninstance when links between the event and the ambusher are\ncommunicated. Humphreys, Cornwell, et al. found that\ncounterambushing communications, after a short delay,\nworked to improve the memory of the relationship between\nthe event and the ambusher. It is possible that the gist of\nwho's who (ambusher or sponsor) was lost and the relation-\nship of the event to the ambushing brand was strengthened.\nAmbushing is a strategic activity that holds many interesting\nmemory questions. It is perhaps less worrisome to marketers,\nhowever, given current legislative protection for true spon-\nsors, than is simple confusion.\nFalse Recognition\nOne phenomenon of consistent interest in studies of spon-\nsorship is that of false recognition. Although perhaps not\ndiscussed as false recognition, many studies have docu-\nmented the tendency of sponsorship audiences to recognize\nfoils as sponsors (see Table 1). For example, in a study set in\na motor sport context, Quester's (1997) use of what she\nreferred to as pre\u00adpost aided recall (asking if a list of brands\nwere event sponsors) showed foils with awareness levels\nsometimes surpassing those of true sponsors. Interestingly,\nnonsponsoring brands Castrol motor oil and Fuji film not\nonly had high recognition as sponsors initially (67% and\n42%) but also retained these levels after the passage of the\nevent (63% and 41%). Notably, these foil brands were direct\ncompetitors of true sponsors: Agip (motor lubricant) event\nsponsor and Kodak (film) sponsor\u00adsupplier. At the same\ntime, respondents were able to identify true sponsors of the\nevent as well or better than foils in some instances after the\nevent (Regional government sponsor 85%, Agip 46%, and\nKodak 46%). An important point to note for the current\nresearch is that simply because a foil congruent with the\nevent may be falsely recognized as a sponsor does not neces-\nsarily indicate destructive interference for recognition of\ntrue sponsors for an event. In fact, there is substantial evi-\ndence in recognition research that destructive interference\ndoes not occur (Dyne, Humphreys, Bain, & Pike, 1990;\nThis tendency to falsely recognize competing brands as\nsponsors is presumably driven in part by similarity between\ncompeting brands. Given that brands such as Powerade and\nGatorade are consumed in a similar way, for a similar pur-\npose, and marketed in conjunction with similar events, is it\nany wonder that consumers might mistake one for the other\nwhen asked about their sponsorship of an event? To suggest\nthat brand parity is leading to brand confusion would not be\nnew (Clancy & Trout, 2002); however, simple similarity of\nbrands per se has not been investigated in the literature on\nsponsorship. In addressing the communication challenge\nposed by brand similarity, the broader marketing and adver-\ntising literature is fragmented with many contextually spe-\ncific studies, for example, similarity due to comparative\nadvertising (Gorn & Weinberg, 1984), similarity related to\nperceptions of brand origin (Loken, Ross, & Hinkle, 1986),\nand similarity due to inferences about service providers\n(Matta & Folkes, 2005). In this instance, for communication\ncontexts such as sponsorship and brand placement, prior lit-\nerature has not identified the range of variables that might be\nrelevant and the paradigms that might be applied to\nCornwell et al. 3\nTable 1.

It should be\nnoted that participants in the\nbrand sponsorship prompt\ngroup where only given the\nbrand and asked to recall the\nevent.\nParticipants were assigned to\none of three conditions (event\nsponsorship prompt; brand\nsponsorship prompt; category\nsponsorship prompt).

In most instances, the most summative findings are reported.This table is not intended to provide a detailed account of methods and findings.\nTable 1. Continued\nunderstand the memory of these simple yet complexly\nembedded communications.\nMeasure of Memory for Sponsorship\nMost past studies of memory for sponsorship communica-\ntion have employed cued or aided recall (see Table 1). One\nstudy specifically considering the variation in cueing is that\nof Tripodi, Hirons, Bednall, and Sutherland (2003). Using\ntelephone survey data collected about the time of the 2000\nOlympics, they considered four approaches to measuring\nrecall: (a) event sponsorship prompt (\"When you think of\n[Event Z], which sponsors come to mind?\"), (b) brand\nsponsorship prompt (\"When you think of [Brand X], what\nsponsorships come to mind?\"), (c) category sponsorship\nprompt (\"When you think of [Category Y, for example,\nbands] what sponsorships come to mind?\") and (d) brand\nrecognition recall (\"I am going to tell you some of Brand\nX's current or recent sponsorships. For each one, could you\ntell me whether you were aware, before today, of Brand X\nsponsoring that event?\"). Not surprisingly, Tripodi et al.\nfound that these different approaches to measurement\nyielded different estimates of memory. Free recall was not\nutilized but had it been, one could only suspect it too would\nhave yielded yet a different picture of memory.\nAn example of a study using free recall is that of Bennett\n(1999) who measured consumer awareness of sponsorship\ninformation, both before and after the viewing of a soccer\n6 SAGE Open\nmatch. On exit, awareness was based on a measure of free\nrecall for \"any firms or brands advertised on perimeter post-\ncued by product category and then by a \"fully aided\" cue\n(which transformed the task into a recognition task). That is,\nattendees were presented with specific brands (including\nfoils) and asked which ones they recalled (recognized). Note\nthat the initial task is classified as free recall study in that no\nexplicit cues for individual brands were supplied. However,\na cue was provided in that participants were asked to recall\nbrands and firms and the general context of the sporting\nevent may have also served as a cue. In a very different\napproach, Johar and Pham (1999) utilized an open-ended\nsure recall measure following exposure to press release\nsponsorship announcements. With each participant reading\nfour press releases followed by a rating task and a filler task,\nparticipants were cued with the event for the sponsor. In this\ntask, 32% reported feeling sure that they recalled the sponsor\nand 56% of these had indeed identified the true sponsor.\nAlthough the studies in Table 1 show a great deal of vari-\nety in measurement, several empirical consistencies can be\nidentified. First, when recognition measures are utilized\nWakefield, Becker-Olsen, & Cornwell, 2007), there is huge\npotential for foils to be identified as sponsors. This is most\nlikely due to what Johar et al. (2006) called \"general plausi-\nbility\" of named brands as sponsors (p. 190). In contrast,\nresearch using recall measures finds very little spontaneous\ninterference from nonsponsors (Bennett, 1999; Grohs,\nWagner, & Vsetecka, 2004). This is the case even when these\nnonsponsors are direct competitors active in the field envi-\nronment (Oakes, 2003) or presented for the study in an\nexperimental context (Cornwell, Humphreys, Maguire,\nWeeks, & Tellegen, 2006). Finally, and important to the cur-\nrent research, is the fact that oftentimes good recognition of\ntrue sponsors is found at the same time as high incorrect rec-\nThe Assumption of Destructive Interference\nIt is safe to say that the standard assumption in research on\nsponsorship communications is that competitive mentions\nare problematic. This assumption is often accompanied by\nanother subtler theoretical one that assumes that memories\noverwrite. That is, if you learn more about the competitor\nyou will forget more about the sponsor. Evidence for\ndestructive interference in the basic memory literature is\nactually quite weak and finding it depends on the task used\n(recognition vs. recall). Recent research suggests that mem-\nory errors that could be interpreted as errors induced by\ninterference might rather be described as a failure to access\na particular bit of information (Humphreys, Tangen et al.\n2010). Given a different cue, or in a different context, a cor-\nrect response may be available (Tulving & Pearlstone,\n1966). In recall, when two targets come to be subsumed\nunder the same cue, such as when an event associated with\na sponsor is also then associated with a competitor, a person\nmay report the competitor not the sponsor when asked about\nevent sponsorship. The issue that occupied early researchers\nin psychology was whether this \"mistake\" occurred because\nlearning the association between a cue and a new word\ncaused the \"unlearning\" of the prior association or whether\nthe participant was confused as to which of the two alterna-\ntives was correct (Barnes & Underwood, 1959). Using recall\ntasks, evidence was found for both positions, though the\nevidence for confusion is stronger (Postman & Stark, 1969).\nMore recently it has been shown that at the time of retrieval,\nthe two targets subsumed under a cue can block each other\nso that neither is produced (Humphreys, Tehan, O'Shea, &\n\"unlearning\" does not discriminate between destructive\ninterference and this type of response competition. The evi-\ndence for interference when memory was tested by recogni-\ntion, however, was equivocal.\nIdeas about recognition being a matching operation in\nwhich the recognition response is driven by a calculation of\nthe similarity between the \"to-be-recognized\" item and the\ncontents of memory led Dyne et al. (1990) to reexamine the\nrole of associative interference in recognition. Using very\nsimilar tasks, they showed that associative interference had\ndifferential effects on cued recall and pair recognition. That\nis, they showed that associating the same cue with two dif-\nferent responses hurt recall but increased both the hit rate\n(correct identification of old items) and the false alarm rate\n(false recognition of new items) in recognition. Dyne et al.\ndid not address the situation where a similar cue is associated\nwith the same item (e.g., a competitor is also associated with\nthe event); however, Metcalfe (1990) analyzed this situation\nfrom a theoretical perspective, which was essentially the\nsame as the Dyne et al. perspective. On the basis of the\nMetcalfe analysis (also see Humphreys, Pike, Bain, & Tehan,\n1989), it seems likely that Dyne et al.'s findings will also\napply to the situation where two similar cues are associated\nwith the same item. This in turn applied to sponsorship sug-\ngests that in recognition, the association of a similar com-\npetitor of the sponsor to an event is likely to increase the\nprobability of identifying the competitor and the sponsor as\nbeing associated with the event. Thus, in recognition, the\nprobability of being able to discriminate between the sponsor\nand its similar competitor is reduced. At the same time, in\ncued recall, a presented competitor can be expected to result\nin interference if recall of the sponsor is cued with the event.\nFurther evidence against destructive interference comes\nfrom a short-term cued recall paradigm by Tehan and\nHumphreys (1996). These researchers showed that interfer-\nence occurred when the cue subsumed both the target and the\ninterfering item but not when it only subsumed the target.\nIf sponsorship is examined by free recall, there are also\ntask-based characteristics at work. For example, premature\nCornwell et al. 7\ncessation of recall (i.e., stopping further recall attempts once\none item has been recalled) is less likely to occur in free\nrecall than in cued recall. Therefore, interference found in\ncued recall studies is less likely because the participant will\nnot stop recalling when an alternative is found. However, it\nis true that in free recall, the recall of one member of a cate-\ngory tends to reduce the probability of recalling other mem-\nbers from that category (for discussion of how remembering\ncan cause forgetting see Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994).\nThus, the recall of one brand (either sponsor or competitor)\nmay reduce the probability of recalling the other.\nThe gist of this basic memory research for sponsorship is\nthat many popular measurement approaches may suggest\nhigh levels of destructive interference. For example, forced-\nchoice recognition studies may look like destructive interfer-\nence but a different picture may emerge with yes/no\nrecognition measurement where the hit rate and the false\nalarm rate allow a more straightforward examination of\nmemory. Furthermore, with recall, the results may depend on\nwhether cued recall or free recall is used. Thus, the approach\nto measurement is decidedly important.\nThe Possibility of Role Reversal\nIn contrast to the destructive view, there are at least three\nways a competitive mention might improve memory for the\ntrue sponsor. First, the presentation of an event and related\nsponsors and their competitors may be organized into a cat-\negory (e.g., Olympic-type alliances). Second, the competitor\nmay serve during recall as another retrieval cue. Third, dur-\ning the encoding process, one may pay more attention to the\ntrue sponsor when a competitor is present. Each of these\npossibilities will be discussed in turn.\nOrganization and categorization. Studies of the organization\nof memory have shown that materials having some provided\nstructure (e.g., words from a category such as a fish, an insect)\nresult in associative clustering in memory (Bousfield, Cohen,\n& Whitmarsh, 1958). That is, items from the same category\ntend to be recalled in adjacent output positions. There is evi-\ndence that this increase in clustering and the accompanying\nincrease in free recall result, at least in part, from organiza-\ntional processes occurring during the study. That is, Einstein\nand Hunt (1980) showed that instructions to sort list items\ninto categories improved free recall, especially when the\norganized structure of the study list was not that obvious. Pre-\nsumably, what is happening is that preexisting semantic rela-\ntionships combine with new episodic learning in a manner\nthat is not fully understood (e.g., Schwartz & Humphreys,\n1973). This associative clustering not only explains organiza-\ntion in memory but it is also the case that organization sup-\nports recall. While memory researchers have been primarily\ninterested in the organization of memory and the extent to\nwhich individuals depend on available structure or develop\ntheir own subjective structure (e.g., Schwartz & Humphreys,\nsorship context. If an event is named and congruent sponsors\nfor the event and their direct competitors are mentioned (e.g.,\nmarathon event, New Balance as sponsor, and Reebok as\ncompetitor), a category of sorts may form, especially if this\ninformation is contrasted with another, different event (e.g.,\nbiking event, Cannondale as sponsor, and Schwinn as com-\npetitor). The juxtaposition of such information could readily\nbe found in a general sports magazine like Sports Illustrated.\nThus, the memory for each category and the elements in it\nwill be supported by preexisting associations among the ele-\nments as well as by the exposure episode.\nAssociates as cues. In addition to memory effects related to\nexposure or study processes, memory research is also con-\ncerned with processes operating at the point of recall or test.\nFor example, Tulving and Pearlstone (1966) provided a dem-\nonstration of the power of providing category names as\nonstrated that they could selectively interfere with category\nrecall (the probability of recalling at least one member of a\ncategory) and item recall (the probability of recalling a par-\nticular item from a category) given that the category label\nwas present as a retrieval cue. More recently, Nelson and\ncolleagues (Nelson, McEvoy, & Schreiber, 1990) have pro-\nvided an impressive amount of evidence showing that asso-\nciatively related words can serve as effective retrieval cues\neven though they were not present at study. That is to say that\nif the competitor brand, Reebok, comes to mind at test, for\nwhatever reason, it may support recall of New Balance as the\ntrue sponsor of a marathon.\nAttending to differences. As an alternative to a new integra-\ntion of semantic knowledge and episodic learning, it is pos-\nsible that a competitive mention simply directs attention to\nthe true sponsor and thus enhances the learning of who the\ntrue sponsor is. This is in keeping with work on similarity\njudgments showing that distinctive features are helpful in\ndiscerning between two options (Tversky, 1977). That is,\nparticularly in the case of ambushing, it seems reasonable\nthat ambushers draw attention to the designation of true\nsponsor. For example, an ambusher flying a blimp over the\nstadium sponsored by a direct competitor is bound to draw\nattention to the true sponsor and the ambusher and poten-\ntially create better recall for both and for the event itself.\nWhile in this context, the possible role of competitive men-\ntion facilitating memory is clear, it may also be complicated\nby individual attitudes toward the act of ambushing. Corn-\nwell et al. (2006) considered the mention of direct competi-\ntors within a press release and found that traditional\ninterference was not particularly great. They note that study\nparticipants may have used the format of the press release to\nmake an inference that the particular competitor mentioned\nwas not the true sponsor and this clarity may have supported\nmemory for the true sponsor. In experimental studies, the\npresence of a competitor without the role of ambusher may\nsimply make a person read the materials more carefully for\nunderstanding.\nIn summary, we do not yet understand what is typically held\nin memory from sponsorship-linked marketing communications\n8 SAGE Open\nbecause we have not yet explored all of the ways that mem-\nory can be probed. Moreover, there is a need in measurement\nto understand the impact of interference from competitive\nmentions in general without engaging participants with\nissues arising from ambushing. We will now turn to a discus-\nsion of the materials developed for this study.\nDesign and Procedure for Experiments\nFor word economy, an overview of the design and procedure\nfor both experiments is given here and only variations from\nthis format introduce Experiment 2. A paradigm used by\nutilized in the current research. In their studies, participants\nread simulated press releases naming a company and a spon-\nsored event. The adaptation of this paradigm by Cornwell et\nal. (2006) will also be adopted for introducing a competitor\nto avoid the affectively charged issue of ambushing. While\nsimulated press releases offer an appealing context for the\nstudy of sponsorship communications due to their ecological\nvalidity (these announcements appear regularly in the busi-\nness press) and flexibility (they are easily manipulated in an\nexperimental setting), their construction is a complex under-\ntaking and will thus be described in detail.\nTwelve sets of press releases were developed for the\nexperiment--one set for each of 12 events. All brands uti-\nlized in the study were well-known international or national\nbrand names and all events were fictitious. Given that articu-\nlation of the relationship between sponsor and event and\ntheir congruence has been shown to influence memory\n(Cornwell et al., 2006), all versions of the press release were\nfor a congruent sponsor\u00adevent relationship and all had an\narticulating sentence that explained why this brand would\nsponsor this event.\nEach press release was a passage of text, four sentences\nin length, announcing a sponsorship deal between a\ncompany and event. The first sentence included the name of\nthe company, a brief description of the company in relation-\nship to the industry (to ensure participants were familiar\nwith the company's domain), and the name of the event. In\nthe competitor-present condition, this first sentence also\nmentioned that a competitor had vied for but lost the spon-\nsorship contract. The second sentence described the event.\nThe third and final sentence described and reinforced the\nreason for the sponsorship. In each press release, the spon-\nsor and event names were mentioned 3 times across the four\nsentences. Every attempt was made to match the content of\nthe press releases within a set and across sets. For a sample\nof the stimuli used in the experiment, see Table 2.\nThe experiment was administered via computer. At the\nbeginning of the experiment, participants were instructed\nthat they would be required to read a series of press releases\nabout upcoming events and their sponsors. They were\ninformed that each event had a unique sponsor. Participants\nwere not informed that they would be tested on their memory\nfor the sponsor\u00adevent pairings.\nEach participant received 12 press releases. The press\nreleases for the 12 events were presented in a random order\nfor each participant. The version of the press release appear-\ning at exposure for each event was counterbalanced across\nparticipants. The exposure phase was self-paced with par-\nticipants pressing the space bar following the presentation\nof a press release to indicate they had finished reading the\npassage of text. Following exposure, participants spent 10\nmin engaged in a visuospatial puzzle task, which served to\ncreate a delay between the exposure and test phases of the\nexperiment, and to reduce possible rehearsal or additional\nprocessing of the sponsorship information. In reporting the\nexperimental results, the recall values are discussed as prob-\nabilities and stem from the raw recall in each cell of the\ndesigns.\nExperiment 1\nIn this free recall task, participants are asked to recall all\nitems in a network. As discussed, the presence of a similar\ncompetitor might improve free recall if the competitor helps\nto form a category and if it functions as a cue for other mem-\nbers in a network. Thus, in free recall, an individual's recall\nof a highly similar competitor may serve as a cue for the\nTable 2. Sample Stimulus for the Sponsors and their Corresponding Competitors (Competitor-Present Condition) for the Sponsor\u00ad\nEvent Pairings in Experiments\nCongruent and articulated press release with competitor: Energizer and Remote ControlVehicles Race\nAfter a lengthy competition for sponsorship rights with Duracell, Energizer, a leading manufacturer of dry cell batteries and flashlights,\nannounced a 3-year sponsorship deal with the Remote ControlVehicles Race.The Remote ControlVehicles Race will be restricted\nto vehicles that have been made by their controllers and should include entries of all shapes and sizes. Energizer will be providing the\nbatteries to power the vehicles on the day, which will demonstrate how their products \"never say die,\" as the race will span 30 laps.\nEnergizer hopes this sponsorship deal will demonstrate the utility and durability of their products.\nCongruent and articulated press release without competitor: Sony and Moonlight Music Festival\nYesterday, after months of intense competition among some of the most comprehensive entertainment brands in the world, Sony\nannounced the beginning of a 3-year sponsorship deal with the new Moonlight Music Festival.The festival will run each year in summer\nand will feature a variety of rock bands playing from dusk until dawn. Sony explained that the sponsorship of the Moonlight Music\nFestival is ideal, as it will strengthen the company's image of delivering quality means for entertainment. Sony is excited about the move\nto target young adults and view this sponsorship opportunity as the perfect starting point.\nCornwell et al. 9\nsponsor. The competitor may also serve as a cue for the\nbrand category, which may in turn serve as a cue for the\nsponsor and the event. It thus seems probable that the sup-\nportive cueing function of the competitor, including the pos-\nsibility that the presence of a competitor will increase\nattention to the designation of true sponsor, would outweigh\nany interfering effect of the competitor and produce net\nfacilitation. This prediction depends on the assumption that\nthe competitor and the sponsor are highly similar. Because\nthe brands utilized in the study were identified from industry\ndatabases as direct competitors (e.g., BP and Shell, Kodak\nand Fuji, Gatorade and Powerade, adidas and Puma), we can\nassume some level of similarity, but we do not know\nwhether they are similar enough to produce facilitation in\nfree recall. Experiment 1 thus becomes a test of this similar-\nity assumption. In addition, it allows for a direct comparison\nbetween the recall of the sponsor and recall of the competi-\ntor. This experiment will allow us to learn the extent to\nwhich sponsor and competitor information are available,\nwith the expectation that the presence of a direct competitor\nwill support recall.\nHypothesis 1: Facilitation can occur in free recall\nwhen a similar competitor is mentioned in the press\nrelease.\nMethod\nParticipants. Twenty participants were drawn from a paid\nparticipant pool at a large state university. Each person par-\nticipated in an individual session, received AU$10, and\nspoke English as their first language.\nDesign. Experiment 1 involved a within-subjects design.\nCompetitive mention (competitor present; competitor\nabsent) was the independent variable and free recall for the\nsponsor, event, and competitor served as the dependent\nvariables.\nProcedure and materials. The instructions specified that\nparticipants were to list, in the space provided, the name of\nthe events that they read about in the press releases. More-\nover, they were to provide the name of each event's sponsor.\nIf participants believed that there was an additional brand\nmentioned, they were instructed to write the name of that\nbrand in the final space. An example was provided to illus-\ntrate the task requirements. Participants were instructed to\nfill in as many spaces as possible, even if they had to leave\nsome only partially complete.\nResults\nThe free recall probabilities for Experiment 1 are presented\nin Table 3.

Most importantly, the\npredicted facilitation occurred. That is, the probability of\nrecalling the sponsor was higher in the competitor-present\ncondition as was the probability of recalling the event. This\nTable 3.

Thus, the\ncompetitor's similarity to the sponsor facilitated an\nepisodic-semantic relationship among the elements in\nmemory.\nThis interpretation of facilitation as related to sponsor\u00ad\ncompetitor similarity would be further enhanced if facilita-\ntion could be shown not to occur when the sponsor and\ncompetitor were less similar (e.g., if they came from differ-\nent-industry categories). In sum, categorization and associ-\nate-based cueing would be less likely to occur when an\nout-of-industry competitor is mentioned in the press release.\nExperiment 2 is designed to test this interpretation and thus\nHypothesis 2.\nHypothesis 2: An out-of-industry competitor will not\nproduce the facilitation found for a within-industry\ncompetitor.\nExperiment 2\nMethod\nParticipants. A new group of 56 participants was drawn\nfrom the university's paid participant pool. Each person par-\nticipated in individual sessions, received AU$10, and spoke\nEnglish as their first language. Each participant was ran-\ndomly assigned to one of two conditions (within-industry\ncondition, n = 28; different-industry condition, n = 28).\nDesign. In each condition, participants were assigned to a\nwithin-subjects design where competitor mention (competi-\ntor present; competitor absent) was the independent variable.\nIn the within-industry condition, the competitor was within\nthe same-industry category (e.g., \"Sony defeated Panasonic\nin a bid for sponsorship\"). In the different-industry condi-\ntion, the competitor was not within the same brand category\n(e.g., \"Sony defeated Smirnoff in a bid for sponsorship\"). In\nboth conditions, free recall for the sponsor, event, and com-\npetitor were the dependent variables.\nProcedure and materials. A different set of 12 press\nreleases was required for Experiment 2 so that the sponsor\nand the out-of-industry competitor were congruent with the\nevent. Thus, there were 12 sponsors, 12 within-industry\ncompetitors, and 12 out-of-industry competitors, each of\nwhich was congruent with 1 of 12 events. In the within-\nindustry condition, each participant viewed 12 press releases\nwith 6 press releases having mention of a competitor within\nthe same brand category and 6 containing no competitive\nmention. In the different-industry condition, each partici-\npant viewed 12 press releases with 6 press releases having\nmention of an out-of-industry competitor and 6 having no\ncompetitive mention. All other aspects of the procedure\nwere the same as in Experiment 1.\nResults\nGiven that our experimental design resulted in a distribution\nof participants to cells that is not straightforwardly analyzed\nusing ANOVA, t-test results are presented in the following\nsection. As in Experiment 1, in the competitor-present\ncondition, the probability of recalling the sponsor was\nhigher than the probability of recalling the competitor. This\nresult held in both the within-industry condition, t(27) = 5.76,\nrespectively, and the different-industry condition, t(27) =\npetitor, respectively. Again, this was an expected finding.\nAlthough the trend was again for greater sponsor recall in\nthe competitor-present condition (M = .70) over the compet-\nitor-absent condition (M = .64) in the within-industry condi-\ntion, the result was not significant, t(27) = 0.99, ns. In the\ndifferent-industry condition, as predicted by Hypothesis 2,\n.65 for the competitor absent and present conditions, respec-\ntively. Table 3 presents the free recall probabilities for\nExperiment 2. While the findings support the lack of facilita-\ntion in the different-industry condition, the within-industry\ncondition of Experiment 2 failed to replicate the finding of\nfacilitation from Experiment 1. An explanation for this lack\nof predicted facilitation follows.\nDuring the debriefing of Experiment 2, several partici-\npants identified three sponsors contained within the press\nreleases (Sony, Dolby, and Kodak) as belonging to \"film and\nsound\" and in a sense to the same-industry category.\nAlthough this was unexpected, it is reasonable given that\nparticipants might have been inspired by fictitious events\nsuch as a music festival and a film festival to form, what we\nmight call, an \"episodic-semantic constellation.\" This epi-\nsodic-semantic constellation is presumably similar to the use\nof weakly related items to organize recall. One can observe\nthe use of these weak links if the items have been chosen so\nthat more obvious links are not present (Schwartz &\nHumphreys, 1973). It was decided that a post hoc analysis\ncould explore the influence of an episodic-semantic constel-\nlation on the results.\nPost hoc analyses. In Experiment 2, as mentioned above,\nthe version of the press release appearing at exposure for\neach event was counterbalanced across participants. For half\nthe participants, the press releases containing these three\nsponsors (Sony, Dolby, and Kodak) appeared in the compet-\nitor-present condition. For the other half of participants,\nthese three sponsors appeared in the competitor-absent con-\ndition. As a result of the link between these sponsors and\ntheir fictitious events, the initial recall of just one of these\nsponsors might facilitate recall of one or both of the other\ntwo, especially when no other within-industry competitor to\nsupport sponsor recall has been provided within the original\npress release (i.e., the competitor-absent condition). In other\nwords, for some of the items, we may have inadvertently\nprovided an industry member that served to support sponsor\nrecall in the competitor-absent condition, thus weakening\nour manipulation. This possibility leads to the following test-\nable hypotheses:\nHypothesis 3: In the within-industry condition, the\ndeletion of these three items should result in a drop\nin sponsor recall when the competitor is absent\ncompared with when the competitor is present,\nresulting in significant facilitation.\nHypothesis 4: In the different-industry condition, the\ndeletion of these items should result in no differen-\ntial change when the competitor is present and when\nit is absent, resulting in no significant facilitation.\nThe results following the deletion of the three press\nreleases identified by participants as being subsumed under\nthe same-industry category are presented in Table 4. For\ncomparison purposes, the predeletion results are also pre-\nsented. The results of the deletion were as predicted. For the\nwithin-industry condition, the probability of recalling the\nsponsor dropped when the competitor was absent and\nremained essentially the same when the competitor was\npresent. The result was a significant difference in sponsor\nrecall as a function of whether the competitor was present or\nIn contrast, deletion resulted in only minimal changes in\nsponsor recall in the different-industry condition. The result\nwas that there was still no significant difference in sponsor\nrecall as a function of whether the different-industry com-\n.67, respectively. Thus, an arising episodic-semantic constel-\nlation had masked the predicted facilitation. Therefore, the\npost hoc analysis of Experiment 2 supports the findings of\nExperiment 1, namely, in free recall, the presence of a simi-\nlar competitor can facilitate recall.\nFinal Discussion and Future Directions\nThese results demonstrate that contrary to popular discus-\nsion of the detrimental effects of competitive mention\nlargely driven by studies of false recognition, competitors\ncan produce facilitation as well as interference. That is,\nresults from these free recall experiments find that competi-\ntive mentions can support recall of the sponsor and event.\nWe can say with some confidence that memory organization\nand categorization plays a role in sponsorship recall for\nthese materials. Both the experimental results contrasting\nwithin the industry with different industries of competitive\nmention and the post hoc analysis support the notion that\nindividuals form episodic-semantic constellations and that\nthese are used in recall. Although these findings consider\nseveral events, the results may generalize to other aspects of\norganization and categorization in sponsorship. For instance,\nthe nature of an event roster (or number of event sponsors)\nhas been examined for its potential influence on attitudes\n(Ruth & Simonin, 2006), but facilitative memory effects\narising from the nature of other sponsors for an event have\nnot been considered. If the various sponsors for an event\nform an episodic-semantic constellation that facilitates (or\ndoes not facilitate) recall for the elements in the constella-\ntion, marketers may want to know. In addition, if a consis-\ntent roster of sponsors for an event were to be maintained it\ncould be argued that, over time, memory for the episodic-\nsemantic constellation could strengthen and/or become less\ndependent on the specific context and thus support long-\nterm memory. Likewise, although the findings here are not\ndirectly applicable to the firm's formation of a sponsorship\nportfolio (e.g., the combining of various art, charity, and\nsport sponsorships), the findings do suggest that the organi-\nzation and categorization of sponsorship portfolios might\ninfluence recall as well as perceptions of image.\nAlthough we cannot examine individuals' cue chains,\npresumably in these experiments, recall of the competitor\nwas cueing recall of the sponsor either directly, via the indus-\ntry category, or via the event. This is decidedly important as\nsponsorship-linked marketing is manifest within contexts\nrich with direct competitor and noncompetitor mentions.\nLikewise, retail environments where sponsorship-linked\nmarketing communications may be relevant in decision\nmaking are often also rich with direct competitor cues; how-\never, these cues might not be detrimental, especially if true\nsponsor cues are available on packaging. At the moment, the\nmost we can say is that marketers should attempt to be aware\nof important associates as cues and not to presume that they\nresult in destructive interference for sponsorship-linked mar-\nketing communications.\nTable 4. Pre- and Postdeletion Sponsor Recall Probabilities\nP (sponsor) Competitor absent Competitor present Statistical significance\nWithin-industry condition\nDifferent-industry condition\nIn the current experiments, press releases in the competitor-\npresent condition allowed the proposition \"not a sponsor\" to\nbe encoded. This contrasting information is presumed to have\nsupported a distinction (Tversky, 1977) and influenced mem-\nory. One can only suspect that exciting and memorable\nambushing events such as when runner Linford Christy wore\nPuma logo contact lenses at the 1996 Olympics (where adidas\nwas the official sponsor, Barrett, 1996) would be even more\ninfluential on memory than the manipulations used here.\nBecause intentional and inadvertent ambushers are a regular\npart of the sponsorship landscape, the power of propositional\nstatements to influence information processing may be impor-\ntant to marketers as well as legislators. Aside from memory,\nfuture research will eventually have to consider the potentially\npositive affective response to ambushing.\nMoreover, these facilitation findings resulting from an\nepisodic-semantic constellation are important as they might\nhelp to understand other unexplained facilitation findings.\nFor example, in studies investigating the role of interference,\nKumar and Krishnan (2004) showed that contextual adver-\ntising elements (e.g., advertising photos) can be a source of\ninterference and facilitation. Specifically in their Experiment\n2, when a picture label (e.g., beach scene) served as the\nretrieval cue, brand claim and brand name recall with similar\nvisual scenes were less than those with dissimilar visual\nscenes. When product class served as the retrieval cue, brand\nclaim and brand name recall were higher with similar visual\nscenes than with different visual scenes. The authors suggest\nthat the product class cue was enabling participants to recall\nbrand name via a retrieval path not encountering contextual\ninterference. An explanation that is compatible with the\nKumar and Krishnan explanation, but which is also more\nspecific, is that the study of two beach scenes made either the\nlabel \"beach scene\" or a composite image of a beach scene\nmore available. This label or image would be highly con-\nnected to the product category (sun tan lotion) and to the\nspecific highly familiar brand name used (Coppertone). The\nresult is that two exposures to a beach scene create an avail-\nable alternative retrieval pathway to the direct link between\nthe product category and the brand name. This appears to be\nsimilar to the alternative retrieval pathway created by the\npresence of a similar competitor in Experiments 1 and 2 of\nthe present research.\nSeveral findings here suggest the need for future research.\nIncluded is the possible influence of propositional informa-\ntion. This is consistent with other calls for research on con-\nsumer inference making (Kardes, Posavac, & Cronley,\n2004). With respect to another aspect of inference making, if\nstatements regarding a competitor are placed outside the\npress release where the sponsor\u00adevent link is initially\nformed, do they result in the incidental ambushing described\nby Quester (1997)? Because almost any sports program or\npublication would exhibit a pattern of sponsor\u00adevent infor-\nmation followed by product advertising from, if not direct\ncompetitors, competitors able to form an episodic-semantic\nconstellation, the resulting memory is of decided interest to\nmarketers. In sum, many unintentional or incidental ambush-\ning communications take place in conjunction with legiti-\nmate sponsorship communications. How detrimental or\nfacilitating is increased competitor availability when it is\naccomplished via independent and unrelated competitive\nmentions?\nIn conclusion, the advent of embedded communications\nin sponsorship and areas such as brand placement and ambi-\nent marketing brings with it the requirement to investigate\nthese communications, as best we can, in situ. We must\nconsider information processing tasks as they are presented\nto consumers. Although this seems in contrast to controlled\nexperimental work, this research has shown that a system-\natic investigation of somewhat complex or even \"messy\"\npress releases (from an experimental paradigm perspective)\ncan yield insights. In summary, we found that even a brief\npress release can produce a relatively strong memory for a\nsponsor\u00adevent relationship. While these types of communi-\ncations may be naturally vulnerable to confusion when\ndirect competitors are mentioned, significant memory for\neach communication element is possible even under these\ncluttered conditions. Finally, this research showed that indi-\nviduals form episodic-semantic constellations and that these\nconstellations can support memory, at least in the short\nterm. Such constellations are, therefore, potentially impor-\ntant in many aspects of sponsorship where collaborating or\ncompetitive sponsors are communicated.\n"
