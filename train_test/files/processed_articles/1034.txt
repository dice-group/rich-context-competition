Introduction\nExisting studies suggest that the informal economy in Russia is large. For\nexample, focusing on the relationship between output and aggregate electricity\nconsumption, Johnson et al. (1997) argue that the informal economy in Russia\namounted to 41.6 percent of total gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995. Using\nhouseholds' electricity rather than aggregate consumption, Lacko (2000) provides\nestimates similar to those in Johnson et al. (1997). Although it provides much lower\nestimates of the size of the informal economy, the Russian State Committee on\nStatistics (Goskomstat) admits that the Russian informal economy is large and\ngrowing fast. According to its estimates, the share of the informal economy in\nIn this paper, we define the informal economy as those legal production\nactivities which should be registered with the relevant authorities by employers\nor self-employed, but are not, as well as those for which no registration\nrequirements actually exist (the production of goods and services aimed\nprimarily at generating employment and income for the households concerned).\nAlthough in theory the nation's GDP should include value added produced in\nthe informal economy, in practice it does not because of measurement problems.\nConsequently, the authorities are unable to impose taxes on informal economy\nactivities.2\nIn transition economies in general, and more specifically in Russia, informal\neconomy activities are largely made up of moonlighting activities (second job\nholdings), and most moonlighting activities take place in the informal economy.\nAccording to the VCIOM data, moonlighting represents about 70 percent of\nRussian households' money income from the informal economy.3 Moreover,\n2 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2002) defines the non-\nobserved economy as those activities which should be included in a nation's GDP, but are in fact not\ncovered in the statistical surveys or administrative records used in the compilation of the National\nAccounts. The non-observed economy is made up of the following three components: the underground\neconomy that produces legal goods and services but conceals production activities deliberately in order\nto avoid paying taxes or social security contributions; the illegal economy that produces or distributes\ngoods and services whose sale or possession is forbidden by laws; the informal economy that operates\nusually at the household level and legally produces goods and services in order to generate employment\nand income for the households concerned. Our definition of the informal economy is rather broader\nthan the OECD's definition: it includes both the underground and the informal economy categories defined\nby the OECD.\n3 The VCIOM data are based on a series of regular (mostly bi-monthly) cross-sectional household surveys\nconducted since 1991 by the All-Russian Centre for Public Opinion Research (VCIOM is its Russian acronym).\nFor a detailed description of the VCIOM data, see Brainerd (1998).\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 3\nall additional jobs in Russia were in the informal economy. In contrast, only\n4.7 percent of total main jobs could be considered to be informal.4\nIs the informal economy harmful for the economy as a whole? Some studies,\nmainly based on aggregate data, suggest that it has negative effects. First, being\nuntaxed by nature, it prevents overall tax revenue from increasing as much as it\nwould if the activities undertaken in the informal economy were conducted in the\nformal sector (Johnson et al., 1997). This is a significant limitation in transition\neconomies, where the government needs to generate revenue to improve the social\nsecurity system and the quality of public services. Second, because of its low\nproductivity and high transaction costs, the informal economy is likely to restrict\nfor the private sector growth, which is regarded as an engine of economic growth\nin transition countries (Blanchard, 1997). Fourth, increases in income inequality in\ntransition economies are found to be positively associated with informal economy\neconomy has been badly hit by its soaring informal economy activities: weak\neconomic growth, a persistent public budget deficit, and rising income inequality\ncan all be seen as direct consequences of these activities. Thus, policies aiming at\nshrinking the size of the informal economy are particularly desirable.\nHowever, an important disadvantage of the use of aggregate data for the study\nof the informal economy is widely recognized. These data can only show the\noverall picture without proper differentiation between the various types of informal\nEnste, 2000). Given that the motivations for undertaking informal economy activities,\nas well as their effects, are extremely different depending upon the various types of\nsuch activities, failing to allow for heterogeneity across different kinds of informal\neconomy activities could lead to gross and possibly misleading simplification of\ntheir motives and effects.\nResearch using micro-level data such as household budget surveys, enterprise\nsurveys and labour force surveys has attempted to analyse particular sectors of\nthe informal economy in transition countries.6 Most microdata-based studies of\nthe Russian informal economy have used household budget surveys (Braithwaite,\n4 In Russia, a primary (main) job is usually seen as the place where a person keeps his/her labour book \u00ad\na document that traces the `official' work history and salaries. Primary jobs are also in many cases connected\nwith benefits such as medical and pension rights. In this regard, it is reasonable to assume that secondary\njobs (moonlighting activities) are generally `unreported', and are, therefore, part of the informal economy.\n5 Rosser et al. (2000) use aggregate data on income inequality and the size of the informal economy in\ntransition countries and analyse a simple correlation between the two variables. They find that the coefficient\nof correlation between the level of the Gini coefficient (used as a proxy for inequality) and the share of the\ninformal economy in 1993\u00ad94 is 0.76 and conclude that the larger the informal economy, the higher the\nincome inequality. This conclusion is confirmed in Rosser et al. (2003), where a multiple regression\nframework based on data from 18 transition economies is used.\n6 Feige and Ott (1999) describe the results of this type of research for various transition countries.\n4 Guariglia and Kim\ngenerally confirm one of the findings based on aggregate data: the informal\neconomy in Russia is positively associated with income inequality.\nThe main contribution of our paper is that it uses microdata to focus on an\nimportant dimension of the Russian informal economy, namely dynamics. This\naspect has been largely neglected by the existing studies on moonlighting, which\ngenerally only show snapshot pictures of moonlighting, without looking at its\nchanging nature. Although Klopov (1996) put forward the idea that moonlighting\nhas a positive role in smoothing labour market transitions, the hypothesis has never\nbeen tested empirically. Understanding the dynamics of informal economy activities\nis extremely important for the implications it has on the economy as a whole. As\nAsea (1996) and Foley (1997) suggest, what matters for the economy as a whole is\nwhether informal economy activities can evolve into formal activities, after having\nallowed participants in the informal economy to sufficiently develop their human\ncapital. If this is the case, then the informal economy may provide a dynamic outlet\nfor entrepreneurial talent, which can lead to a better formal economy as part of a\nnatural evolution (Asea, 1996; Levenson and Maloney, 1998). This positive effect of\nthe informal economy may offset the negative effects mentioned previously.\nIn this paper, we will try to answer the following questions: Are there frequent\nbi-directional movements between the formal and informal economies in Russia?\nFor what purposes do people use informal jobs? Are such purposes associated with\nthe enhancement of human capital? Is there any evidence that previous participants\nin the informal economy subsequently become registered self-employed workers\nor entrepreneurs? We will attempt to answer these questions by focusing on\nmoonlighting, which represents an important component of the informal economy\nin Russia. More specifically, we will assess the degree of persistence of moonlighting\nand evaluate the rate of conversion of secondary jobs into primary jobs by analysing\nthe relationship amongst current moonlighting, past moonlighting, and the desire to\nswitch jobs, as well as the relationship amongst actual job changes, past moonlighting,\nand the desire to switch jobs. We will use a nationally representative longitudinal\nsurvey of Russian citizens, the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS)\nOur findings suggest that moonlighting is transitory: previous moonlighting\nis negatively associated with present moonlighting. Moreover, an intention to shift\n7 The RLMS is a panel household-based survey representative of the Russian Federation as a whole. See\nSection 4 for more details on this survey. We limit our analysis to the period 1994\u00ad98 because, as we will\ndiscuss in Section 5.4, this paper investigates among other things the extent to which moonlighting was\nused by workers to smooth the transition towards a main job as self-employed. Self-employment was in\nfact strongly discouraged until the late 1980s. With the transition towards a market economy, the share of\nself-employed out of total employment increased substantially as households took advantage of the sudden\nopening of these new but rather uncertain opportunities (Earle and Sakova, 1999, 2000). This process,\nhowever, slowed down with the stabilization of the country which followed the 1998 crisis.\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 5\njobs has a positive impact on moonlighting. This may suggest that people who want\nto switch jobs use moonlighting as an experiment, before making a full commitment\nto another job. We also find that previous moonlighting and an intention to switch\njobs are positively associated with an actual job change. Finally, self-employment\nis a popular choice as a main activity for previous moonlighters.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review existing studies\non the determinants of moonlighting. In Section 3, we explain our methodological\nframework and describe our estimation strategy. In Section 4, we present our dataset\nand some descriptive statistics. Section 5 illustrates our empirical results about the\ndynamics of moonlighting of the Russian working-age population. Section 6\npresents our conclusions.\n2. Existing work on moonlighting\nA fairly large number of papers have been written on multiple job holding in\nWestern countries. One group of economists attempts to explain the motives for\nmoonlighting by looking at differences in returns between jobs in the formal sector\nand jobs in the informal sector (Ehrlich, 1973; Shishko and Rostker, 1976; Conway\nand Kimmel, 1998). If the latter jobs are associated with higher risk but higher\nreturns compared to the former, households will allocate some of their time to\njobs in the informal sector in order to maximize returns given risk. Another group\nof economists emphasizes the importance of unemployment or, more generally,\nworking-hour constraints as causes of moonlighting (Shishko and Rostker, 1976;\nRose (1994) suggests that there are two major motives for moonlighting in\ntransition countries: survival and enterprising.9 In line with the first motive, Kim\n(2005) argues that in Romania, moonlighting is driven by low income and by the\ngap between the needed and the actual consumption levels. Similarly, Desai and\nIdson (2000) claim that wage arrears, which increase the incidence of poverty, are\npositively correlated with the probability of holding a secondary job in Russia. On\nrates in secondary jobs in Russia are higher compared to those of primary jobs, and\nthat Russian households, which are not necessarily poor in terms of their income\nfrom legal sources, tend to participate in the informal economy to further increase\ntheir income. On the basis of surveys of households conducted in four Russian\n8 For instance, Paxson and Sicherman (1996) argue that a full-time employee is subject to a working hour\nconstraint if he/she would like to work more, for instance because of a difficulty in making ends meet with\nonly the income from his/her primary job, but is not able to do it.\n9 Enterprising is intended as the exploitation of opportunities. According to this motive, people moonlight\nnot out of necessity, but because they want to avoid paying taxes, or to use their human capital to exploit\nthe higher returns available in the informal economy, and hence to increase their income.\n6 Guariglia and Kim\ncities, Clarke (1999) claims that there is no correlation between economic hardship\nsuggest that higher education is positively correlated with holding a second job,\nwhile the effect of primary job wages is either insignificant or very small in terms\nof its magnitude. In line with the enterprising motive, their finding indicates that\nrelatively well-off workers hold additional jobs to further increase their income\nwithout paying taxes, thereby increasing income inequality.\nOther researchers have investigated further reasons why households might\nhold multiple jobs. Guariglia and Kim (2004) find that moonlighting in Russia is a\nself-insurance mechanism that can be used as an alternative to precautionary\nsaving to smooth consumption in the presence of fluctuating earnings. Commander\nand Tolstopiatenko (1997) claim that the extent of moonlighting is also affected by\ndemand factors. A firm can choose whether to employ part-time informal labour\nsubject to some probability of being caught, or full-time formal labour that pays\npayroll taxes. Their findings suggest that the allocation of workers across formal\nfull-time and informal part-time jobs depends on the scale of the subsidy provided\nto formal sector workers.\n3. Methodological framework\nLet us denote by T the time available to an individual for work or leisure; by h1\nand\n, the number of hours that he spends on his main and secondary jobs, respectively;10\n, the hourly wages on his primary and secondary jobs, respectively;\nby NLY, his non-labour income; and by Y, his total income.11 The individual's\nutility function can be written as follows:\nU = U(T - h1\nThe individual maximizes his utility function subject to the following constraints:\n+ NLY, and (2)\nBecause the budget constraint is satisfied with equality, the utility function can be\nexpressed as:\n10 The word `he' will be used hereafter to refer to both genders.\n11 Models similar to the one outlined in the succeeding discussion were used in Shishko and Rostker (1976),\nKrishnan (1990), and Conway and Kimmel (1998). In our empirical analysis, we deflate all nominal variables\nusing price deflators based on September 1992 roubles.\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 7\nU = U(T - h1\n+ NLY). (4)\nWe can define the marginal utility with respect to the secondary job working hours\nas follows:\nThe first-order conditions for utility maximization can be obtained by setting\nequation (5) equal to 0, and then solving it for the labour supply relative to\nsecondary jobs.\nIf we let P2\ndenote the decision to have a secondary job, the Kuhn\u00adTucker\nslackness conditions yield the following:\nAssuming that is a function of all the exogenous variables included in the\nmodel, the following estimable participation equation can be derived:\n= Xit\n+  ln w1,it\n+  ln w\n+  ln h1,it\n+ vi\n+ vt\n+ eit\nwhere Xit\nis a vector of exogenous variables relative to individual i at time t, which\nincludes demographic, educational, and regional variables, as well as some variables\nrelated to the individual's main job, such as wage arrears. w1,it\nis the wage rate earned\nby individual i at time t in his primary job, and w\nthe corresponding wage rate\nearned in his secondary job, which, as described in Appendix 1, will be obtained\nfrom the estimation of a wage rate equation using the Heckman (1976) procedure.12\nThe error term in equation (7) is made up of three components: a time-invariant\nindividual-specific effect (vi\n), which can be viewed as a collection of factors that are\nspecific to the individual but are not included in Xit\n; a time-specific effect (vt\n), which\naccounts for possible business cycle effects; and an idiosyncratic component (eit\n).\nIn order to test whether moonlighting is persistent, we will add previous\nmoonlighting to the right-hand side of equation (7). In addition, we will test\nwhether moonlighting is positively associated with a desire to switch jobs by also\nincluding a variable relating to the desire for a job change expressed in the previous\nperiod as a regressor. We will, therefore, estimate the following extended equation:\n12 As pointed out in Moffitt (1999), the Heckman procedure is extremely sensitive to the specification and\nnon-normality of the errors. We tested the robustness of our main results by estimating different versions\nof all our equations, which omit the predicted variables. The results were very similar to those presented in\nthe paper and are not reported for brevity. They are, however, available from the authors upon request.\ndU\ndh\nmu h w w NLY\n( , , , ).\n=\nP\nh\ndU\ndh\nh\ndU\ndh\n.\n=\n= <\n> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif or\nif or\ndU\n8 Guariglia and Kim\n= Xit\n+  ln w1,it\n+  ln w\n+  ln h1,it\n+ vi\n+ vt\n+ eit\ndenotes moonlighting for individual i at time t \u00ad 1, and di(t-1)\nis a\ndummy variable indicating whether respondent i expressed a desire to switch jobs\nat time t \u00ad 1.\nEquation (8) will be estimated using a random-effects Probit model. As the same\nindividual appears up to three times in the sample, the use of a random-effects\nestimator will allow us to take into account unobserved heterogeneity (which\nappears in the vi\ncomponent of the error term).13 We will take into account the vt\ncomponent of the error term by including time dummies in all specifications.\nHowever, if the initial observation of moonlighting is correlated with the\nindividual-specific component of the error term, then the estimation of equation (8)\nusing a random-effects Probit specification is likely to lead to biased estimates.14\nWe will, therefore, also use an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach, where lagged\nmoonlighting will be instrumented using lagged local unemployment rates, lagged\nbroad categories of primary occupations (managerial, professional, non-manual\nskilled, manual skilled, unskilled), lagged perceived economic rank,15 and time\ndummies. These instruments are intended to capture both demand- and supply-side\naspects of moonlighting.\nWe will subsequently test whether job changes follow spells of moonlighting\nand the declared intention to switch jobs. Following Roy (1951) and Lee (1978), the\ndecision to change jobs can be reached after comparing the relative earnings expected\nin a new job and an old job with a certain `reservation' wage ratio. In particular, if\nwe denote by jc a binary choice variable indicating whether the individual changes\njobs or stays with his old job, by wn1\n, the wage that would be received in a new main\njob if jc = 1, by wo1\n, the wage that would be received in the old main job if jc = 0,\nand by , the ratio between the two corresponding reservation wages, then an\nindividual would change jobs (jc = 1) if the following equation holds:\n13 Because the sample of individuals that we use in this paper is randomly drawn from a large population,\nit is appropriate to use a random-effects model (Baltagi, 1995).\n14 More generally, if there is a correlation between the regressors and the individual-specific component of\nthe error term, then one should treat the vi\ncomponent of the error term as fixed. However, in the Probit\ncase, because we cannot subtract the group means from all the variables and then work on the transformed\ndata, it would not be possible to obtain consistent estimates of the individual-specific component of the error\nterm under this scenario as the number of vi\ns increases with the sample size. This is known as the incidental\nparameters problem (see Neyman and Scott, 1948). To check the robustness of our main random-effects\nProbit specification, we will use an alternative estimator, the conditional fixed-effects Logit estimator\n(Chamberlain, 1980), which is a conditional maximum likelihood estimator, where the conditioning is\ncarried out with respect to a minimal sufficient statistic in order to eliminate the unobservable vi\ns.\n15 The perceived economic rank variable is based on the following question asked in the RLMS: `Imagine a\n9-step ladder where on the bottom, the first step, stand the poorest people, and on the highest step, the 9th, stand the\nrich. On which step are you today?'\n*\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 9\nOtherwise, the individual would choose to stay with the old job (jc = 0).\nis not directly observable. We will assume that it is a linear function of a set\nof individual characteristics, Z. Substituting into (9) and rearranging yields the\nfollowing estimable equation:\nwhere the first element will be estimated using the Heckman (1976) procedure, and\nthe last three elements represent the composite error term.\nFinally, we will analyse which type of main job an individual chooses to hold\nafter a period of moonlighting. Main jobs are categorized as self-employed, paid,\nor entrepreneurial jobs. The decision to acquire a self-employed main job is defined\nby the binary choice variable, seit\n, which is modelled as follows:\nseit\n=  ln (w\n) + Kit\n+ vi\n+ vt\n+ eit\nw\nis the wage that individual i would get at time t in self-employment: it will be\nestimated using the Heckman (1976) procedure. Kit\nis a set of characteristics of\nindividual i at time t. The choice of having a paid job and engaging in entrepreneurial\nactivities as a main occupation will be estimated in a similar way. Both equations\n(10) and (11) will be estimated using a random-effects probit model.\n4. Data and descriptive statistics\nThe data used in this paper consist of rounds 5 to 8 of the Russian Longitudinal\nMonitoring Survey (RLMS), corresponding to household and individual interviews\nrepresentative sample of several thousands of households across the Russian\nFederation.16 The RLMS contains detailed information on households' income and\n16 The RLMS is managed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Population Centre, in collaboration\nwith five agencies which include Paragon Research and the Russian Institute of Sociology.

We restrict our\nsample to adult individuals who have a main job.17 Given the fact that retirement\nages for Russian men and women are 60 and 55 years, respectively, we also restrict\nour sample to individuals who are aged between 18 and 58 years for men, and\nWe classify an individual as holding multiple jobs if he answered `yes' to either\nof the following questions:19\n`Tell me please, do you have some other kind of work?'20 and\n`Tell me please, in the last 30 days did you engage in some additional kind of work for\nwhich you got paid? Maybe you sewed someone a dress, gave someone a ride in a car,\nassisted someone with apartment or car repairs, purchased and delivered food, looked after\na sick person, or did something else that you were paid for?'\nThe first question refers to a paid secondary job while the second refers to the\nso-called individual economic activities, which can be viewed as self-employment\n17 Individuals who have a main job are those who did not answer `I do not work' to the survey question:\n`Tell me please, do you now work, are you on paid or unpaid leave, or do you not work?'\n18 We apply this specific restriction because we intend to avoid complications caused by moonlighting\nclose to retirement ages. Our results did not change if we considered a sample of men aged 18 to 60 years\nold and women aged 18 to 55 years old. Note that by only considering workers far enough from retirement\nage, only 17 men and 10 women were excluded.\n19 One can distinguish moonlighters from multiple job holders: the former refer to people who hold a\nsecondary job while working on a full-time basis in their main job. The latter refer to workers who hold\nseveral part-time jobs at the same time. According to our dataset, 78 percent of secondary job holders work\nmore than 40 hours per week in their main job. This indicates that participants in the Russian secondary job\nmarket are, in general, moonlighters (that is full-time workers rather than part-timers in their main job). We\nincluded a dummy variable for lagged moonlighting together with one for lagged multiple job holding in\nour regression for present moonlighting. The coefficients on both dummy variables were negative and\nprecisely determined. Moreover, the difference between the coefficients on the two variables was not\nstatistically significant (2(1) = 0.56, P-value 0.45). In the remaining part of this paper, we therefore use the\nterms moonlighting and multiple job holding interchangeably.\n20 This first question was only asked to those respondents who, earlier in the questionnaire, reported\nhaving a main job. It was followed by other questions about the type of this secondary occupation and the\ncharacteristics of the enterprise/organization at which it was held, in terms of number of employees,\nownership structure, and so on. These additional questions indicate that the secondary jobs referred to are\nmore formal compared to the Individual Economic Activities (IEAs) to which the next question refers. Also\nnote that, in our sample, these secondary jobs represent about 37 percent of the additional jobs held by\nRussian employees, whereas the IEAs represent the remaining 63 percent. The VCIOM data show that some\nindividuals hold more than one secondary job: in November 1997, 14 percent and 10 percent of moonlighters\nheld two second jobs and more than two second jobs, respectively. Unfortunately, the RLMS does not\nprovide accurate information on the number of second jobs held by moonlighters.\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 11\nactivities.21 In order to be classified as holding multiple jobs, an individual\nalso needs to state that he worked a positive number of hours in the last\n30 days on his additional job, and that he received a positive wage payment on that\nAlthough the second question on second-job holding seems to refer to\nunskilled types of occupations, the Russian labour market for moonlighting is not\ndominated by low-skilled and less-educated workers. For example, according to\nVCIOM data, 68 percent of the moonlighters declared that the qualifications\nrequired for their additional job were higher or equal to those required in their\nmain job.\nTable 1 reports variable means over the pooled sample for working-age popu-\nlation, together with standard errors and the ranges of the variables. Compared to\nnon-moonlighters, multiple-job holders are slightly younger, more educated,\nand have a somewhat shorter primary job tenure. Monthly working hours of\nmoonlighters in their main job are slightly lower than those of non-moonlighters,\nand real wage rates of moonlighters in their primary jobs are very similar to those\nof non-moonlighters. However, the moonlighters' real wage rates in the secondary\njobs are more than four times higher than the wage rates in their primary jobs.23\nRegional differences are also noticeable: moonlighting is particularly high in\n21 The VCIOM dataset provides detailed information on the types of second jobs, which can be associated\nwith self-employment (IEAs). According to the VCIOM, from 1994 to 1999, the most popular IEA was to\nprovide consumer services such as repair work (this activity represented 28 percent of the total of IEA-\ntype second jobs), followed by the sale of goods including shuttle trading (22 percent), professional work\n(translating, computer programming, etc., 16 percent), personal services (baby-sitting, nursing, cooking etc.,\n12 percent), private lessons (9 percent), business mediation (6 percent), production of consumer goods\n(5 percent), and work in own shop, caf\u00e9, and kiosks (3 percent). The RLMS provides details for paid second\njobs. According to this dataset, the highest share of paid second jobs can be found in the occupational group\nof professionals: 26 percent of the individuals holding paid second jobs work as professionals on their\nsecond job. This is followed by the occupational group of plant and machine operators and assemblers (22\npercent), unskilled occupations (19 percent), technical and associated professionals (14 percent), and service\nand market workers (13 percent).\n22 For self-employed workers, wages are meant as profits. Also note that the questions relative to IEAs and\npaid secondary jobs are not defined using the same time frame. In particular, the question in the survey\nrelative to the latter variable asks whether a worker holds an additional paid job now, while the question\nregarding IEAs refers to a second job held during the last 30 days. This is why in our analysis, we defined\na moonlighter as an individual who stated that he held an additional job (either paid or IEA-type), and who\nreceived positive income and worked positive hours on that job during the last month. Therefore, an individual\nwho only started his last job now would not be considered as a moonlighter, as he would not have received\na positive income from that job, nor worked a positive number of hours on that job in the last month.\n23 This comparison is based on money wages. Income in kind such as free or subsidized housing, health\ncare, and nursery facilities are widely available for main jobs. If those fringe benefits were included, the\ndifference between income from main jobs and secondary jobs would obviously become smaller. Friebel and\nGuriev (1999) analyse the negative effect of in-kind payments from enterprises on job mobility. Higher risk\nattached to secondary jobs and opportunities for using equipment available on main jobs can also explain\nwhy workers hold main jobs in spite of their far lower wage rates.\n12 Guariglia and Kim\nTable 1.

As for main occupations, professionals, as well as crafts and\ntrade people, are highly active in holding multiple jobs.24\n5. The dynamics of moonlighting: Empirical evidence\n5.1 Is moonlighting persistent or transitory?\nGiven that moonlighting is highly associated with informal economy activities,\nan important question that arises is whether it is persistent or transitory.\nPersistent moonlighting suggests a limited rate of conversion of secondary jobs\ninto primary ones. Although their secondary job may provide a higher wage rate,\npeople may be reluctant to transform it into their primary occupation, because\nof the risk attached to it. Only if they become sufficiently confident about their\nsecondary job will they transform it into their main occupation. Moreover, fringe\nbenefits and wage arrears associated with their main job may deter workers from\nleaving it. Some moonlighting jobs may not be convertible to a main job because\nthe demand for the good or service produced in these jobs is not sufficient to\nsupport full-time work, or because these are seasonal secondary jobs. In such cases,\nindividuals will continue to moonlight, thus moonlighting could be persistent. Finally,\nmoonlighters may be reluctant to convert their secondary job into their main job in\norder to continue to avoid taxes on the income from their secondary job.\nTable 2 presents a mobility matrix of moonlighting. The table shows that multiple-\njob holding in Russia is not growing. The share of multiple-job holders as a proportion\ncaused either by a frequent bi-directional movement between single-job holding and\nmultiple-job holding, or by persistent moonlighting activities by certain groups of\nindividuals. The table supports the former hypothesis, suggesting considerable mobility\nbetween single-job and multiple-job holding. For example, new moonlighters, defined\nas those who held a secondary job for the first time in the current year, amounted\nThe transitory nature of moonlighting can be more clearly shown by looking at\nthe conditional probability of continued moonlighting in the present period given\nmoonlighting in the previous round: this probability is fairly stable over the period\nconsidered (37\u00ad38 percent). On the other hand, about 60 percent of the individuals\nwho engaged in moonlighting in the previous period return to holding only one\n24 We used Hotelling's (1931) t-squared generalized means tests to see if the differences in the means of the\nvariables discussed in the text were statistically significant. All differences referred to were significant. We\ndid not present the tests for brevity.\n25 The VCIOM data also suggest that there is little evidence of a significant increase in the number of multiple\njob holders in the period 1994\u00ad99.

The probability of holding multiple jobs after having\nexperienced moonlighting for the previous two and three rounds increases to\nAlthough the analysis of the transition probabilities presented in Table 2 suggests\nthe transitory nature of moonlighting, the result is only indicative because no controls\nare included. As we discussed in Section 3, we now estimate the following model:\n= Xit\n+  ln w1,it\n+  ln w\n+  ln h1,it\n+ vi\n+ vt\n+ eit\nwhere i indexes individuals and t indexes time,27 P2,it\nrepresents moonlighting in the\ncurrent round, and P2,i(t-1)\nis moonlighting in the previous round.

For this purpose, we restrict our sample\nto respondents who moonlighted at least once before the present period. To give\nsome indication of the duration of moonlighting, we also include in our specification\ntwo new dummy variables, one indicating whether the individual moonlighted in\nthe previous two rounds, and another indicating whether he moonlighted in the\nprevious three rounds. We estimate our equation for the probability of moonlighting\nat time t using a random-effects probit specification.\nThe results, reported in column 1 of Table 3, show that the coefficient on the\nestimated secondary job wage rate is positive and highly significant, suggesting\nthat higher wages are positively correlated with moonlighting. On the other hand,\nthe coefficients associated with the primary job wage and wage arrears are not\nprecisely determined.29 The coefficient on the variable indicating whether the\n26 We tested for the equality between these two probabilities. The test statistic was t = 8.98 and the equality\nwas consequently rejected.\n27 t refers to the rounds of the RLMS used in estimation. The available rounds are 5 to 8, but round 5 is lost\ndue to the presence of a lagged variable on the right-hand side of the estimating equation. Lagged variables\nrefer to variables in the previous round. Time dummies are included in all regressions.\n28 The predicted secondary job wage rate is obtained using the Heckman (1976) procedure, which corrects\nfor self-selection bias. See Appendix 1 for details on the calculation of this predicted wage.\n29 These results are different from those obtained by Desai and Idson (2000). This is because the sample that\nwe use in our study when we analyse the determinants of moonlighting is different from the sample that\nthey use. Because we focus on the dynamics of moonlighting while Desai and Idson (2000) investigate the\ndeterminants of moonlighting in a static context, we have to restrict our sample to respondents who\nmoonlighted at least once before the present period. In contrast, Desai and Idson (2000) use a larger sample\nregardless of moonlighting experience. Furthermore, we use a random-effects probit specification while\nDesai and Idson (2000) and other researchers generally use pooled cross-section regressions.\n18 Guariglia and Kim\nTable 3.

This implies that previous moonlighting is\nnegatively associated with the probability of holding multiple jobs in the present\nperiod. In other words, in Russia, moonlighting is transitory rather than persistent.30\nIn contrast, the positive and significant coefficients on the variables indicating\nwhether the individual moonlighted in the two and three previous rounds suggest\nthat the longer the period in which the individual engaged in moonlighting, the\nless likely he is to return to single-job holding.31\nOne problem with these estimates is that they could be biased if the initial\nobservation of moonlighting is correlated with the individual-specific component\nof the error term. In column 2 of Table 3, we use an Instrumental Variable (IV)\napproach, which helps us to control for this problem. As we discussed previously,\nwe instrument the previous moonlighting variable using lagged regional\nunemployment rates, lagged primary job categories, and lagged perceived\neconomic rank. The coefficient on previous moonlighting is once more negative\nand precisely determined. To check for instrument validity, we performed a test\nas in Nickell and Nicolitsas (1999): we regressed our previous moonlighting\nvariable on all the exogenous variables plus all the remaining instruments, using a\nrandom-effects specification. We then tested for the joint significance of the\nlatter instruments, using a Wald test. The statistic suggests that the instruments are\nWe check the robustness of our results in three ways. First, one could argue that\nthe inclusion of a generated regressor such as the predicted second job wage in our\nmoonlighting regression might result in biased standard errors. In addition, given\nthe fact that the RLMS is based on a stratified sampling procedure starting from the\nprimary sampling units (PSUs), clustering can also have an impact on the standard\nerrors.33 The first column of Table A3 in Appendix 2 presents the estimation results\n30 Note that spells of moonlighting that are completed quickly have a lower probability of still being in\nexistence when the stock of persons currently moonlighting is observed, whereas longer spells have a higher\nprobability of appearing in the sample. This problem is known as `length-biased sampling' (Kiefer, 1988).\nThe possibility of a return of a moonlighter to holding one job between the surveys actually reinforces our\nfinding that moonlighting is transitory in Russia.\n31 It has to be noted, however, that very few people moonlighted in the two or three previous rounds. Table\nof which had moonlighted in the previous two rounds; and only 22 of which had moonlighted in the\nprevious three rounds.\n32 Although this joint significance test only tells us that the instruments are good predictors of lagged\nmoonlighting, we also think that they can be reasonably excluded from the present moonlighting equation,\nas they are lagged one period. It makes sense to assume that lagged unemployment rates, lagged primary job\ncategories, and lagged economic rank perceived by the individual are strongly related with past moonlighting,\nbut not as strongly with present moonlighting. Dynan (2001) used a similar approach to estimate a consumption\ngrowth equation with lagged consumption growth as a regressor.\n33 For a description of the multilevel probability sample design of the RLMS, see Gregory et al. (1999). For\nan analysis of the impact of clustering on standard errors, see Deaton (1997).\n22 Guariglia and Kim\nof our moonlighting equation once the generated variable bias and clustering are\ntaken into account.34\nSecond, we check whether the fact that we only use individuals who have\npositive income and have worked for positive hours in the last 30 days generates\na sample-selection problem. We therefore use a larger sample of the Russian adult\npopulation that comprises both working individuals and individuals on leave.\nNote that non-working individuals cannot be included in the sample because the\nquestion on additional paid jobs is only asked to individuals who have a working\nstatus.35 The result of the estimation of equation (12) based on the larger sample is\npresented in the second column of Table A3.36\nLastly, following Chamberlain (1980), a conditional fixed-effects logit model\nis used as an alternative method of estimation. An advantage of this method of\nestimation is that it allows the regressors and the individual-specific component of\nthe error term to be correlated. A disadvantage is that all time invariant variables\nhave to be dropped from the estimation. In addition, all the individuals for whom\nthe dependent variable is either always 0 or always 1 are dropped from the sample\nused in estimation. Finally, the precision of some variables whose variance is\nnegligible across time is compromised. Column 3 of Table A3 shows the results\nusing this alternative estimation method.\nThe three columns of Table A3 show that in all cases the coefficient on the\nprevious moonlighting variable is negative and statistically significant. This\nsuggests that correcting the standard errors for clustering or generated variable\nbias, using an extended sample, and using a different estimation method do not\naffect our main results.\nGiven this transitory nature of moonlighting, three further interesting questions\narise. Is moonlighting associated with the desire for a job shift? Do job changes\neffectively occur after moonlighting and a declared intention to switch jobs? What\nprimary occupation do previous moonlighters choose? We analyse these issues\nin turn.\n34 In order to take clustering and the generated regressor bias into account, the following procedure was\nused: first, a random sample of similar size to the original sample was drawn with replacement from the\nobserved sample; second, the relevant regression was estimated on this new sample using the Stata\n`svyprobit' command, with the option psu, in order to take clustering into account; third, the procedure was\nreplicated 1,000 times and bootstrapped standard errors were calculated from the distribution of each of the\n1,000 estimated parameters obtained in these replications. Note that bootstrapping the standard errors is\nspecifically aimed at correcting for the generated variable bias.\n35 Individuals subject to wage arrears who were not paid their wage at all during the month prior to\ninterview are also excluded from the sample used in estimation, as their primary job wage is recorded as\nmissing. According to the VCIOM, however, in 1997 only 11 percent of the workers who suffered from wage\narrears in the previous month did not receive any wage at all. The majority of workers subject to wage\narrears received partial wages and are therefore included in our sample.\n36 The unpaid leave variable which we included in this specification is insignificant. This can be seen as\nfurther evidence that moonlighting is not associated with hardship faced by the individuals.\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 23\n5.2 Is moonlighting associated with the desire for a job shift?\nWe initially test whether an individual's intention to switch jobs has an impact on\nhis probability to hold an additional job. The intention of making a job switch is\ninferred from the answer given to the following question:\n`Would you like to find different work?'\nThe responses are coded as 1 if the respondent answers `yes' and 0 if the\nrespondent answers `no'. We use the first lag of the variable quantifying the\nintention to make a job switch, along with all other variables used in the regressions\nreported in the first two columns of Table 3 as independent variables in a random-\neffects probit model for the probability of moonlighting in the present. We use the\nlagged intention to make a job change to explain current period moonlighting\nbecause it is reasonable to assume that people take some time before they start\nto moonlight with a view to implementing their intention to switch jobs.37 In\naddition, the use of the first lag of the variable relative to the individual's intention\nto change jobs avoids possible endogeneity biases that may arise when using the\ncontemporaneous variable.\nThe results are presented in column 3 of Table 3. The coefficient associated\nwith the variable indicating the intention of a job switch proves to be positive and\nstatistically significant.38 A possible explanation for this finding could be that\nmoonlighting in Russia is used as a mechanism that enables workers to experiment\nwith a different job, instead of immediately shifting to it. Moonlighting can, in fact,\nreduce the risk attached to a job change in two ways. First, it can make a reversal\nless costly when the prospects of the job tried turn out not to be bright. In such a\nway, moonlighting can help those individuals for whom changing jobs at once\nwould be too costly and risky, to start a new job or business more smoothly.\nSecond, it provides a period for obtaining the necessary skills and information. If\n37 Note that a lag of one year does not necessarily mean that the respondent starts moonlighting after one\nfull year: moonlighting can begin at any time between the previous round and the present round, but it is\njust recorded in the present round survey. We checked whether our results are sensitive to which specific\nlag is used on the variable relative to the desire of changing jobs in two ways. First, we used the variable\nof an intention to change jobs lagged twice (instead of the same variable lagged once) as an explanatory\nvariable in our regression for present moonlighting. This allows for a longer time interval between the\nintention and implementation. The coefficient and the t-value on the twice-lagged variable were 0.167 and\n2.73, respectively. Second, we instrumented the variable relative to the intention for a job switch using\nregional unemployment rates, job categories, and perceived economic ranks and used the first lag of the\npredicted variable as a regressor. The coefficient on this predicted variable was still precisely determined\n38 As before, we checked the robustness of this result by using the extended sample and by taking clustering\nand the generated regressor bias into account. We found that the coefficient on the variable relative to the\nindividual's intention to switch jobs was in both cases precisely determined and positive. We did not report\nthese results for brevity, but they are available upon request.\n24 Guariglia and Kim\nthis interpretation were true, then moonlighting could be viewed as a `human\ncapital-enhancing activity'.39\n5.3 Does a job change follow an intention to switch jobs and/or\nprevious moonlighting?\nOne may ask whether a declared intention to change jobs effectively ends in a job\nswitch, and whether previous moonlighting contributes to the switch. We estimate\nequation (10) to test whether the prior intention to switch jobs and previous\nmoonlighting have a statistically significant effect on actual job changes.\nProblematically, rounds 5 to 6 of the RLMS do not provide direct information on\nwhether the respondent changed jobs. Sabirianova (2002) attempted to trace\noccupational mobility using the differences reported between rounds in the four-digit\nInternational Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes, which are\navailable in the RLMS. Because of miscoding, however, she concluded that the result\nwas hardly convincing. For example, she found that 50.3 percent of employed\nrespondents changed their occupation between 1994 and 1995. We use an alternative\nmethod, which can provide a more reliable estimate of actual job changes. Our\nmethod is based on the answers given by respondents to the following question:\n`Tell me, please, since what year and month have you been working at this place?'\nWe assume that a job change has occurred if the starting date of the current\njob is later than that reported in the previous year survey.40 According to this\ntwo figures are fairly consistent with the subjective evaluations of job changes\nrespondents declared to have changed their place of work over the periods\n39 Foley (1997) interprets his finding that secondary employment is most often in a different field than the\nmain occupation in a similar way as ours. He in fact claims that workers may be exploring possible career\nshifts without having to make a full investment and leave their primary job.\n40 In this case, the job switch obviously occurred between the date of the previous survey and that of the\npresent survey. We examined possible irregularities in the data and corrected them. For example, some\nobservations were recorded as job changes while the individual was on leave. These were corrected because\njob changes are incompatible with paid/unpaid/maternity leave. We also looked at other information such\nas the number of employees in the enterprise/organization before and after the job change in order to check\nwhether our variable of job change was reliable. One limitation with this methodology is that it can only\ncapture inter-firm occupational mobility, but not changes in a respondent's occupation within the place of\nwork. However, the number of respondents who switched jobs within the place of work is not large:\naccording to round 8 of the RLMS, which specifically asks about job changes, only 3.3 percent of respondents\nsaid they had changed jobs while remaining within their place of work.\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 25\nWe now use the whole sample of working-age population because we deal with\nactual job changes, which are not restricted to moonlighters. We first estimate the\nwage rates of the new and old jobs using demographic, human capital, regional, and\noccupational dummies as explanatory variables. The differences between estimated\nwage rates at new and old jobs are incorporated as an independent variable in the\nregression for actual job changes, the results of which are presented in Table 4.41\nWe find that an intention to change jobs expressed in the previous period is\npositively associated with an actual job change. In addition, moonlighting in\nthe previous period is also positively associated with job changes, suggesting\nthat former moonlighters are more active in changing their jobs compared to\nnon-moonlighters.42 These findings may be explained by the fact that individuals\nwho desired to switch jobs used moonlighting as an experimental mechanism,\nand actually changed their main job if the experiment was successful. We also find\nthat the coefficient associated with the wage gap variable is positive but not\nprecisely determined.43 A further interesting result, which is consistent with Earle\nand Sabirianova (2002), is that wage arrears in the previous round are negatively\nassociated with job changes in the present round.44\n5.4 Which primary occupation do previous moonlighters choose?\nWe now discuss which types of primary job people who have moonlighted in the\npast and desired a job shift tend to choose in the present. In particular, we want to\n41 For the sake of brevity, the results from the wage regressions, estimated using the Heckman (1976)\nprocedure, are omitted, but are available from the authors upon request.\n42 We obtained similar results using the information on actual job changes derived from the direct question asked\nin rounds 7 and 8. In other words, we combined job changes in round 6 measured indirectly using the\nmethod explained in the text with data on actual job changes available from the RLMS in rounds 7 and 8. In\nthis case, the coefficient and t-value on the dummy indicating the intention to switch jobs were respectively\n43 There may be cases in which workers who switch jobs end up with new jobs requiring lower qualifications\nthan their old jobs. These types of job switches are likely to be involuntary. They may occur, for instance,\nas a consequence of the loss of the employee's main job. In these cases, the employee may be left with little\nchoice, apart from taking an unskilled job. This may justify why the coefficient on the wage gap variable\nin the job change regression is positive but not statistically significant: voluntary movers exploiting\nhigher wages on new jobs are likely to be mixed with non-voluntary movers who have to end up with jobs\nrequiring only elementary skills. This hypothesis is confirmed by examining the ISCO codes associated with\nworkers' main jobs before and after the job changes. The number of job movers who moved upward on the\nladder of ISCO codes was similar to that of the individuals who moved downward. In addition, about 18\npercent of job movers ended up with jobs requiring no skills (ISCO codes equal to 9,000 or above), moving\nfrom jobs that required higher level of skills according to the ISCO codes.\n44 For an extensive discussion on why wage arrears might be negatively associated with job changes, see\nEarle and Sabirianova (2002). They suggest that wage arrears affect the slope of the wage\u00adtenure profile,\nthus increasing an incentive to remain longer with an employer. Other reasons include the fact that workers\nwho quit a job generally lose any chance to receive back wages owed. Poor outside options and fringe\nbenefits attached to a job can also explain the negative effect of wage arrears on job changes.\n26 Guariglia and Kim\nTable 4.

(cont) Effects of previous moonlighting and of the intention\nof a job switch on actual job changes\ntest whether in the future, these people will hold main jobs as paid employees,\nentrepreneurs, or self-employed.45 Some previous moonlighters may prefer jobs\nas paid employees in enterprises or public organizations because they found\nmoonlighting too risky. Others might want to hold jobs as entrepreneurs after\nhaving acquired some experience and possibly some capital. Alternatively previous\nmoonlighters may decide to work as self-employed on a full-time basis. To find\nwhich is the correct scenario, we estimate random-effects probit regressions for the\nprobability that previous moonlighters now hold each of the three types of main\noccupations (paid employees, entrepreneurs, and self-employed).\nFollowing Manser and Picot (1999), we differentiate the self-employed into\nincorporated and unincorporated. The unincorporated self-employed are defined\nas the currently working people who answered `no' to the following question:\n45 Because, as we discussed in the introduction, only 4.7 percent of total main jobs in Russia in 1998 could\nbe considered as informal (Kim, 2002), it is reasonable to assume that the main jobs referred to in this\nsub-section take place in the official economy.\n28 Guariglia and Kim\n`Please state if you work for an enterprise, organization, institution, collective farm, state\nfarm, firm'.\nIncorporated self-employed, on the other hand, are defined as those who\nanswered `yes' to the above question, work at their own enterprise, hold more than\nThe classification as entrepreneur is based on the answer given by respondents\nnot already classified as self-employed to the following question:\n`Do you think you are doing entrepreneurial activities in this job?'\nThe respondents who answered `yes' to this question were classified as\nentrepreneurs. Finally, paid employees are defined as currently working people\nwho are neither self-employed, nor entrepreneurs.\nThe regression results are presented in Table 5.47 Column 2 shows that there is\nno significant association between previous moonlighting and a main job as an\nentrepreneur. According to column 3, there is evidence that previous moonlighting is\nnegatively related with the probability of holding a paid job. Column 1 suggests that\nthere is a positive and precisely determined association between self-employment\nand previous moonlighting: the coefficient and the t-value on the moonlighting\n46 In more detail, the incorporated self-employed also answered `yes' to the question: `Do you work at your\nown enterprise?' and answered `from 51\u00ad100 percent' to the question: `What percentage of this enterprise do you\nown?'; and `less than 10' to the question: `How many people work in your enterprise?' Given that self-employment\nis not clearly defined in the questionnaire, we used several definitions of self-employed, for instance\nincluding only the unincorporated, or only the incorporated. In all cases, we obtained results similar to those\nreported, which are available upon request.\n47 The results in Table 5 refer to the estimation of equation (11), where the dependent variable is a binary\nvariable indicating whether people hold jobs as self-employed, entrepreneurs, or paid employees at time t.\nThe results were obtained using a two-step estimation procedure as before. In the first step, we estimated\nselectivity-bias-corrected earning functions for self-employed, entrepreneurs, and paid employees using a\nHeckman (1976) procedure, and fitted values for wage rates were obtained. In the second step, the estimated\nwage rates were used as explanatory variables in the estimation of the equation for the participation in each\nof the three main occupations. Note that for the self-employed, we use wages to refer to the profits or\nrevenues that they obtain from their business.\n48 The coefficient on the previous moonlighting variable is still marginally significant when we take the\neffect of clustering and the generated regressor bias into account (the t-value becomes 1.92). Considering\nthe possibility of measurement error affecting the self-employed category, we pooled the self-employed and\nentrepreneurs together in a single category and looked at the effect of previous moonlighting on the\nprobability of being an entrepreneur or self-employed as a primary job. The results, not reported for brevity,\nsuggested that the coefficient associated with previous moonlighting was strongly significant both when\nclustering and the generated regressor bias were taken into account (t-value is 2.40) and when they were\nnot (t-value is 2.72). Note that this broader classification is unlikely to suffer from measurement error\nbecause occupation as a self-employed worker or entrepreneur is directly observable from the data and is\nclearly differentiated from occupation as a paid employee.\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 29\nTable 5.

(cont) Effects of previous moonlighting on main job occupational choices\nThe Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 31\na moonlighter in the previous period is associated with a 35 percent higher\nprobability of being self-employed in the present.49 In other words, a popular first\njob choice of previous moonlighters appears to be self-employment.50\nIn order to put the marginal effects obtained before in a better context, Table 6\nshows workers' transition to different types of primary jobs (self-employed, paid,\nand entrepreneurial jobs) after a spell of moonlighting as self-employed (individual\neconomic activities). We only focus on those moonlighters who hold a self-employed\nsecond job because we are interested in seeing whether they convert their main job\nto self-employment following a moonlighting spell as self-employed.\nSeveral observations can be drawn from the table. First, across the three different\ntypes of jobs, the conditional probability that an individual does not engage in\nmoonlighting in the terminal period after an initial period of moonlighting is\nhigher than the probability that he still moonlights (column 1).51 This confirms our\nearlier finding of the transitory nature of moonlighting.\nColumn 5 of the table reports ratios obtained by dividing the number of\nworkers who were moonlighting as self-employed at time t and hold a main job as\nself-employed, paid employees, or entrepreneurs in period t + 1 (column 1), by the\ntotal number of workers who hold a main job in each of the three groups of\nactivities at time t + 1 (column 3). These ratios, which are 10.0 percent for the\nself-employed, 9.8 percent for the entrepreneurs, and 7.9 percent for the paid\nemployees, suggest that following a spell of moonlighting as self-employed, people\nare most likely to hold a self-employed or entrepreneurial primary job.52\nThe ratios reported in column 5, however, do not take into account the fact that\nformer moonlighters might have already held a main job as self-employed, paid\nemployees, or entrepreneurs in period t. Column 6 takes this effect into account: it\nindicates the ratio between the number of workers who did not have a main job\nin one of the three main categories of activities, but who were moonlighting as\nself-employed in period t, and switched to a main job as self-employed, paid\n49 Note that although only 31 individuals in our sample moonlighted as self-employed in the period prior\nto effectively becoming self-employed, which represents only 8.4 percent of the pool of self-employed, these\n31 individuals represent 26.5 percent of the inflow into self-employment (see Table 6 below and the associated\ndiscussion).\n50 One should also consider the possibility that some past moonlighters end up in unemployment or out of\nthe labour force, instead of going into single job holding. We have tested this hypothesis by estimating a\nregression similar to those reported in Table 5, where the dependent variable is equal to 1 if the respondent\nis unemployed or out of the labour force, and 0 otherwise. We found that the coefficient associated with the\nprevious moonlighting variable was marginally significant (t-value: 1.96). Moreover, its coefficient (0.12)\nwas very small compared to the corresponding coefficient reported in column 1 of Table 5 relative to the\nprobability of ending up as self-employed as a main occupation (0.33). These results, which are not reported\nfor brevity, but are available from the authors upon request, suggest that the association between past\nmoonlighting and becoming unemployed or exiting the labour force is not particularly strong.\n51 The difference between the two probabilities is statistically significant (t-value: 21.9).\n52 Note that the difference in the ratios relative to the self-employed and paid workers is statistically significant\n(t-value: 8.9), whereas the corresponding difference between self-employed and entrepreneurs is not (t-value: 0.12).\n32 Guariglia and Kim\nTable 6.

The shares reported in column 6 show that\nself-employment moonlighting contributes to the expansion of self-employment\nin Russia, as it represents 26.5 percent of the new self-employed main jobs. In\ncontrast, the contribution by previous moonlighters to the flows into the categories\nof paid employees or entrepreneurs is significantly lower.53\nOne possible interpretation of our findings is that self-employment activities\nwere strongly discouraged until the late 1980s in the Soviet Union. Although those\nactivities began to emerge in a new environment at the later stage of perestroika, the\nshare of self-employment out of total employment was negligible. The transition\ntowards a market economy in Russia provided households with the sudden opening\nof opportunities. Workers contemplating self-employment could experiment with\nit as a secondary form of employment, before leaving their main job and becoming\nfull-time self-employed. Thus, secondary jobs could serve as the entry point of\nself-employment, which could evolve into entrepreneurships in the future.54 If\nthis interpretation were true, then moonlighting in Russia could be viewed as a\nlow-cost seedbed for setting up new self-employed businesses, and moonlighting\ncould be seen as a significant factor that contributed to the emergence of new\nself-employed businesses during the transition period.55\n6. Conclusions\nUsing the RLMS, this paper has analysed the dynamics of moonlighting in Russia.\nWe can summarize our findings as follows: First, previous moonlighting is\n53 Both the differences in shares between self-employed and paid worker, and between self-employed\nworker and entrepreneur are statistically significant (the t-values are 9.5 and 2.0, respectively).\n54 Earle and Sakova (1999) suggested that the considerable rise in self-employment after the transition can\nbe seen as a `quasi-experiment' for understanding the sources of entrepreneurship in transition economies.\nDue to the lack of capital and of a banking system to finance small businesses, the start-ups would nearly\nalways have begun as self-employed activities.\n55 The positive correlation between past moonlighting and self-employment could also reflect the decision\nof workers who expect to lose their primary job to start self-employment as a coping mechanism and thus\nto combine it with their first job until they effectively lose their primary job, after which the secondary\nself-employment would become de facto the main activity (see Earle and Sakova, 2000). Although in some\ncases, this interpretation could be true, we think that because the unemployment rate in Russia was fairly\nlow over the period considered, averaging only 7.2 percent (Russian Economic Trends, 1999), it is more likely\nthat moonlighting was used as a stepping stone to setting up new self-employed businesses. Furthermore,\nover the period 1994\u00ad98, only 13.5 percent of respondents on average answered the question: `How\nconcerned are you that you might lose your job?' with `very concerned', the other possible answers being `a little\nconcerned', `both concerned and not concerned', `not very concerned', and `not concerned at all'. We constructed\na dummy equal to 1 for these respondents and equal to 0 otherwise and included it as an additional\nexplanatory variable in equation (12). We found that the coefficient associated with this dummy was negative\nand precisely determined, suggesting that people who expect to lose their primary jobs are actually less\nlikely to moonlight. This is in line with the enterprising motive for moonlighting discussed in Section 2.\n34 Guariglia and Kim\nnegatively associated with present moonlighting, suggesting that moonlighting in\nRussia is transitory. Most working-aged Russians return to a single-job holding\nafter a period of moonlighting.\nSecond, an intention for a job shift expressed in the past is positively correlated\nwith present moonlighting and previous moonlighting is positively associated with\npresent job changes. This may be due to the fact that Russians use moonlighting as\na mechanism to smooth the process of changing jobs. Moonlighting can in fact\nallow individuals to transform their secondary job into the primary one without\nexposing them to the risk arising from an immediate shift from one job to the\nother. Moonlighting can also be used as a human capital-enhancing activity for a\njob mover, enabling him to accumulate the necessary skills and information about\nthe new job. According to our results, an intention to change jobs tends to end up\nwith an actual job change, suggesting that there is a significant association\nbetween the intention and the implementation. We can therefore conclude that\nthere is a considerable interaction between the three key variables in our analysis:\nmoonlighting, an intention to change jobs, and an actual job change.\nThird, previous experience as a moonlighter is positively correlated with\nbecoming self-employed as a main activity, and 26.5 percent of the inflow into\nself-employment is due to those people starting self-employment as a main job\nafter a period of moonlighting as self-employed. In the early stages of the transition,\nmany households worked in the informal economy because of turmoil, excessive\nregulations, high taxes, wage arrears, and so on. As the transition proceeded,\nthe turmoil and some of the extreme distortions subsided. This appears to have\nencouraged former moonlighters to move into self-employment as a main job,\nemerging into the tax-paying official economy. After having experienced self-\nemployment in the official economy for a while, some of the former moonlighters\nmay eventually become entrepreneurs in the official sector. In this sense,\nmoonlighting in Russia can be viewed as an effective incubator for setting up new\nself-employed/entrepreneurial businesses in the official economy, and might\nprovide long-term benefits to the economy in spite of its possible negative effects,\nwhich have been widely discussed in the literature.\nReferences\nAhn, N. and Rica, S.

The dependent\nvariable in the wage equation is the logarithm of real hourly wages received in\nthe month prior to interview in the informal economy. The independent variables\nare standard: human capital variables such as education and main job tenure,\ndemographic characteristics, location, main job occupational dummies captured by\nISCO codes, and secondary job characteristics. Note that wage arrears in secondary\njobs are not common: only 9 percent of moonlighters in our sample face unpaid\nwages. The identification variables in the participation equation include wage rates\nand working hours from the main job, income from non-job-related sources,\nmarital status, and family characteristics. These variables are assumed to affect the\nparticipation decision through their effects on the individual's preference and his\ntime constraints.\nWe estimate the wage and participation equations separately for each round\nfor two reasons. First, this helps to avoid possible instability of equations across\nrounds. Second, the Heckman-type regression is not yet developed to take into\naccount the panel nature of the data. The estimation results for the wage equations\nare presented in Tables A1 and A2.\n38 Guariglia and Kim\nTable A1.
