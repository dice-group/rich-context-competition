Berg2, Carri Casteel1\n1 Injury Prevention Research Center, Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, College of\nPublic Health, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America, 2 Department of Sociology,\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Science, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, United States of America\n* shabbarkaid@gmail.com\n Introduction\nGovernment policies designed to alleviate the public health burden of violence generally con-\nsider law enforcement officials as important resources for violence prevention. A fundamental\ncomponent of such crime-control efforts is the willingness of the public, particularly victims of\ncrime, to mobilize legal authorities to resolve public safety threats [1]. Without active commu-\nnity involvement the police are less likely to detect violent crimes, arrest suspects, and effec-\ntively allocate crime-control resources to communities [2]. However, according to recent\nnational-level estimates, approximately 54 percent of violent victimizations are not reported to\nthe police [3].\nSeveral individual, situational, and contextual factors reliably predict whether or not vic-\ntims mobilize police services [4\u00ad7]. Research suggests that reporting of victimizations to\npolice may vary by victim and offender characteristics, including injuries received, presence\nof bystanders, and use of weapons [8\u00ad14]. It is documented that African Americans, Hispan-\nics, and people living in disadvantaged neighborhoods experience higher rates of violence\nthan Whites and those from low-poverty neighborhoods [3,15]. Furthermore, it has been\nsuspected that police services are not as robust or effectively delivered to minority groups in\nsome communities, which could translate into race-specific effects of police notification on\nsubsequent victimization risk [16,17]. Thus, both police notification and its impact on sub-\nsequent experiences with violence and property crime may also vary by victim's racial/ eth-\nnic background.\nVictims are also concerned about retaliatory action from perpetrators in case of police\nnotification [18\u00ad20] which may preclude them from reporting. Reporting practices are also\nimportant for understanding the mechanisms of repeat victimization [21]. Research shows\nthat prior victimization is strongly associated with risk of future victimization [22\u00ad25].\nResearch on repeat victimization raises questions about the implications of police reporting\non personal safety. But comparatively few studies have moved beyond the question of \"why\nvictims notify the police\" to questions about the ramifications of reporting [25,26]. The only\nstudy that assessed the personal ramifications of reporting to the police has been conducted\nin the context of intimate partner violence [25]. Another ecologic study conducted in the\nUnited Kingdom assessed the association of anonymous police reporting with violence and\nviolence-related injuries [26]. Both these studies reported that police reporting was associ-\nated with fewer future victimization/ crime. But there is no information about how reporting\nto police affects all forms of interpersonal violence including robberies, assaults, gang vio-\nlence and property crimes like thefts and burglaries. Addressing this knowledge gap may\nhelp inform policies about how police engage victims, particularly those in minority\ncommunities.\nIn this study, we evaluated the association of reporting victimization to police with the inci-\ndence of future victimizations. The study used National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)\ndata, which is the only nationally representative incident-level crime and victimization data\nthat collects detailed victim and social contextual data about each event [27].\nPolice Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations\nfor Injury Prevention and Control.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nMethods\nParticipants and procedures\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the National Crime Victimization\nSurvey (NCVS) 2008\u00ad2012, a nationally representative, self-reported, longitudinal survey of\nincident non-fatal crime reports, designed to assess the rates of non-fatal crime victimization\nin the United States (US) [27]. The survey is sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and\nthe data is collected by the US census bureau. The NCVS is a household based survey of 90,000\nhouseholds that targets 12 years or older household residents. The housing units and group\nquarters are clustered within counties, groups of counties, and large metropolitan areas. The\nsurvey excludes residents under 12 years of age, crew members of maritime vessels, personnel\nliving in military barracks, the homeless, prison inmates, US citizens living abroad, and foreign\nvisitors [28]. The initial survey is a face-to-face interview after which the participants take tele-\nphone surveys every six months for three years. Each participant takes up to seven surveys con-\ntributing a maximum of 3.5 years of person-time in the NCVS. Participants who completed at\nleast one follow-up survey after their first reported victimization during 2008\u00ad2012 were\nincluded in this study. Due to the secondary and de-identified nature of the publicly available\nNational Crime Victimization Survey data used for this study, it was determined `not human\nsubject research' by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Iowa.\nMeasures\nParticipants who reported their first victimization to the police, between 2008 and 2012, were\nconsidered exposed and those who did not report their initial victimization to the police were\nconsidered unexposed. Thus the exposure variable was a binary variable. After the initial vic-\ntimization, they were followed over time to assess the rate of subsequent victimization. The fol-\nlow-up time varied based on when the participants reported their initial victimization, and\ntheir last completed follow-up (Fig 1). Fig 1, provides examples of how the eligible person-time\non the study (TS\n) was calculated for each participant and how it compared with the person-\ntime of follow-up on the NCVS study (TNCVS\n). Participants who did not report any victimiza-\ntion (P4), did not take a follow-up survey after the first victimization report (P8), were enrolled\ntowards the end of the follow-up period from July-December 2012 (P5), or reported their first\nvictimization at the end of follow-up period (P10) were not eligible for this study; hence repre-\nsented in Fig 1 with TS\ncould have had their first victimization before the one observed in Fig 1, however, we did not\nhave information on that since we defined our study observation period between 2008 and\nDuring the follow-up surveys participants reported future victimizations that occurred after\nthe initial victimization, these subsequent (or future) victimizations were categorized as inter-\npersonal violence (including sexual assaults, robberies, threatened assaults and threatened\nrape), burglary (including forced entry into a property), and theft (including motor vehicle\ntheft and pickpocketing). The overall future victimizations, future interpersonal violence vic-\ntimizations, future burglary victimizations, and future theft victimizations were accounted as\ncount variables. The future victimization counts were divided by the total person time on the\nstudy (TS\n) to calculate rates of future victimizations per 100 person-years.\nTo identify potential covariates for controlling confounding, a directed acyclic graph [29]\nwas developed using previously published literature [4\u00ad20] and consensus among the co-\nauthors. A directed acyclic graph, also known as causal diagram, allows to identify a minimal\nsufficient set of well measured variables that controls for all known confounding. The minimal\nPolice Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations\nsufficient set of variables required to control for all known confounding included initial victim-\nization type (interpersonal violence/ burglaries/ thefts), victim's baseline age (continuous), sex\n(male/ female), race (White/ African American/ American Indian Alaska Native/ Asian), eth-\nlege/ associate degree/ bachelor's degree/ master's +), offender sex (male/ female/ not known),\nvictim-offender relationship (stranger/ acquaintance), victimization location (inside home/\noutside home/ friend's home/ commercial place/ parking places/ school/ public places/ other),\nvictim injury (yes/ no), and bystander presence (yes/ no/ don't know). We hypothesized that\nthe relationship between reporting to police and the incidence of future victimization may vary\nby race of the victim and victim-offender relationship. Hence, we explored effect measure mod-\nification by these characteristics by examining the p-value of the interaction term in the regres-\nsion analyses; we reported stratified rate ratio estimates.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used survey statistics (surveymeans, surveyfreq, surveyreg) in SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC)\nto calculate weighted frequencies, rates, and unadjusted and adjusted rate differences of future\nvictimization comparing those who reported their initial victimization to the police and those\nwho did not.\nWe used generalized linear mixed Poisson models for multilevel survey data to compare the\nrates of future victimization among those who reported their initial victimization to the police\nand those who did not, while accounting for clustering in the survey design. These analyses\nwere conducted using SurveyGLIM in LISREL9 (SSI Inc., Skokie, IL) to estimate weighted\nunadjusted and adjusted rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analyses\n, person-time in the\nNCVS study; TS\n, eligible person-time within the observation period, such that individuals with TS\n= 0 are ineligible for this study.\nPolice Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations\nHowever, the above analyses may have potential selection bias based on when the initial vic-\ntimization occurred during the follow-up (which is when the exposure to police reporting is\nmeasured). This can be assessed by the length of time survey participants were followed after\ntheir initial victimization (Fig 1). To assess the effect of the potential selection bias on the asso-\nciation between police reporting and future victimization, we conducted sensitivity analyses.\nWe restricted the analyses sample based on follow-up cutoffs of 6 months, 12 months, and 24\nmonths. We then examined the association of police reporting with future victimization in\neach of the restricted sample files separately and compared the rate ratios with the overall rate\nratio estimate.\nResults\nafter initial victimization; these participants were excluded from this study. The remaining\n18,657 participants who took at least one follow-up survey after their initial victimization were\neligible for this study (Fig 2). They took a total of 45,255 follow-up surveys (median = 2;\nipants were not reported to the police. Of the 45,255 follow-up interviews, 899 were taken by\nproxies.\nThe median age of all eligible participants was 39.7 years (interquartile range: 26.2, 52.2),\n50.4% of whom were females (Table 1). The majority of participants were White (78.3%), fol-\nlowed by African American (15.7%). At baseline, more than two thirds of the participants were\nvictims of thefts, another 14.8% were victims of burglaries, and 16.3% were victims of interper-\nsonal violence. The majority of offenders were males (80%); 14% of offenders were victim's\nPolice Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations\nacquaintances. Most baseline victimizations (59.6%) occurred either inside or in the vicinity of\nvictim's home (outside).\nTable 1.

For every 100 victimizations that were reported\nto the police there were 13.5 fewer subsequent victimizations, four of which were interpersonal\nviolence and nine of which were thefts. Overall, participants from all racial groups who\nreported to the police experienced fewer future victimizations.\nOur results align with the study conducted in Cardiff, UK, where anonymized police report-\ning of violent crime indices from emergency department visits was associated with 42% fewer\nviolence-related injuries in Cardiff [26]. However, this association is ecologic [26]. In this\nstudy, we evaluated the association of police reporting with the incidence of subsequent victim-\nization on the same victims. The only other similar study was conducted among victims of inti-\nmate partner violence [25]. In that study, police involvement was associated with 48% fewer\nfuture incidences of domestic violence. This study also used the NCVS data to evaluate the\nThere are several reasons to expect that police reporting of an incident might deter future\nvictimization. First, police action may result in arrest and conviction of offenders thereby pro-\ntecting the victim from re-victimization by the same offender. Second, the offenders may also\nview police intervention, irrespective of arrest, as stigmatizing, which may deter them from tar-\ngeting the same victim again [30]. The stigma and shaming may be further compounded if/\nwhen police investigations acquire and release digital evidence (images or videos) that end up\non social media and news outlets [31,32]. The digital evidence may also aid the police in identi-\nfying, arresting, and convicting the offenders [31]. Third, offenders may be deterred if the\npolice warn or indicate future arrest is likely when they intervene [33]. However, the deterrence\npotential of stigma and arrest might be effective insofar as the same offender, whether acquain-\ntance or stranger, intends to target that victim again [34]. Fourth, victims might acquire strate-\ngies to effectively lower their vulnerability to victimization as a result of their contact with the\npolice. For instance, the police might raise their awareness about high-risk activities and neigh-\nborhoods and inform victims of strategies to safeguard themselves from future harm. Informa-\ntion and support is often provided by victim services that are generally affiliated with local\npolice jurisdictions [35]. Lastly, there is evidence to suggest that reporting to police improves\nseeking of mental and physical health services by victims, which may also reduce the potential\nfor subsequent victimization [35]. Altogether, these potential preventive outcomes of police\nnotification may lower the risk of future victimizations as seen in the current study.\nHowever, we observed that only 41% study participants reported their initial victimization\nto police. This is similar to previous studies that revealed the low prevalence of police reporting\nPolice Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations\nof victimizations [8\u00ad14]. Low reporting of victimization is also prevalent in cyber victimiza-\ntions [36]. Several factors like retaliation from offenders, perceived triviality of the crime, rela-\ntionship to the offender, societal stigma and stress, or distrust and perceived incompetence of\nlaw enforcement may explain the low prevalence of police reporting by victims [7,9].\nWhile all other racial groups experienced 23% or more decline in subsequent victimization\nrates, African Americans experienced only an 11% decline. This was because in this study the\nAfrican Americans who reported stranger perpetrated victimization experienced similar or\nhigher rates of victimizations, especially property crimes (burglary), than African Americans\nwho did not report stranger perpetrated victimization to the police (Table 3). This may suggest\na lack of trust between the police and African American victims as suggested in previous stud-\nies from Philadelphia [16] and Washington, DC [17]. American Indians and Alaska Natives\nwho reported to the police experienced a higher rate of acquaintance perpetrated interpersonal\nviolence victimization (Table 3). American Indians and Alaska Native populations have been\nnoted to experience high rates of violence victimizations [3], and the most common reason of\nnot reporting violent victimizations to police is fear of reprisal [19] suggesting a potential retal-\niatory response.\nLimitations\nIn this study, we used self-reported NCVS data with 6 month recall, which may induce recall\nbias leading to under- or over-reporting of victimization to police and exposure. There are\nthree possibilities. First, victims may under- or over-report future victimizations. If the under-\nor over-reporting is non-differential between the exposed and unexposed, then the rate ratio\nestimates will not be affected, but, the rate difference estimates will decrease or increase, respec-\ntively. The second possibility is under-reporting (more likely than over-reporting) of both\nexposed and unexposed events at the initial victimization (under-reporting of person-time),\nwhich will also result in under-reporting of future victimizations (under-reporting of out-\ncomes); assuming non-differential reporting, this will not change the estimates. The third, and\nthe most plausible, is differential reporting of the initial victimizations. Here, the exposed\nevents are likely to be reported accurately\u00adbecause police are usually informed in case of more\ntraumatic events which may be recalled accurately; and, the unexposed are under-reported\nleading to under-reporting of future victimizations. This possibility will also not change any\nestimates. Hence, our estimates seem robust to recall bias.\nAbout 1.9% (n = 899) of interviews were proxy interviews, which may be of concern, how-\never, after excluding the proxy interviews from the analyses our estimates did not change\nappreciably.\nPolice reporting is not the same as police action or arrests. Our findings may be interpreted\nto suggest that police reporting may have a protective association with future victimization\nindependent of police action; however, most police reporting is followed by some police action\nwhether the victim is aware of it or not [26].\nLastly, although our estimates are generated from a well-grounded specification, this is an\nobservational study. Even after controlling for many potential confounders there may be other\nunknown/unmeasured confounders that we cannot control for in the analyses. Hence, the rate\nratios from this study are measures of association, not causation. Since we cannot conduct a\nrandomized trial to observe this exposure-outcome relationship, the best potential way to get\ncloser to a causal interpretation may be through a natural experiment or instrumental variable\napproach. Such an approach posits that if there is a randomly distributed natural variable (e.g.,\na policy that may be instituted in some states but not others) which predicts the exposure\n(prevalence of police reporting), does not have a direct relationship with the outcome (future\nPolice Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations\nvictimization), and is not associated with known confounders of the exposure-outcome rela-\ntionship, then we may be able to estimate the effect (causation) of the exposure on the\noutcome.\nConclusions\nWe conducted a longitudinal study that allowed us to temporally examine how the rates of\nfuture victimization change following a police report for baseline victimization in a nationally\nrepresentative sample of survey participants. Our results suggest that reporting victimizations\nto police may reduce the victim's likelihood of future victimization. The protective association\nof police reporting may be due to the victim's protective behaviors, police actions, and victim\nservices that provide mental and physical health services. However, in this study, less than half\nof the victims reported their victimizations to the police. It is hence foreseeable, that an increase\nin reporting of violent and property crimes to police may be an important factor in crime pre-\nvention and control. Future studies may explore interventions to increase the prevalence of\npolice reporting by victims thereby reducing re-victimizations in future.\n"
