However, the benefit of annual vs less frequent\nscreening intervals has not been well evaluated, especially for low-risk patients.\nObjective To examine the marginal cost-effectiveness of various screening inter-\nvals for eye disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, stratified by age and level of\nglycemic control.\nDesign Markov cost-effectiveness model.\nSetting and Participants Hypothetical patients based on the US population of dia-\nbetic patients older than 40 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey.\nMain Outcome Measures Patient time spent blind, quality-adjusted life-years\n(QALYs), and costs of annual vs less frequent screening compared by age and level of\nhemoglobin A1c\n.\nResults Retinal screening in patients with type 2 diabetes is an effective interven-\ntion; however, the risk reduction varies dramatically by age and level of glycemic\ncontrol. On average, a high-risk patient who is aged 45 years and has a hemoglo-\nlevel of 11% gains 21 days of sight when screened annually as opposed to\nevery third year, while a low-risk patient who is aged 65 years and has a hemoglo-\nlevel of 7% gains an average of 3 days of sight. The marginal cost-\neffectiveness of screening annually vs every other year also varies; patients in the\nhigh-risk group cost an additional $40 530 per QALY gained, while those in the\nlow-risk group cost an additional $211 570 per QALY gained. In the US population,\nretinal screening annually vs every other year for patients with type 2 diabetes costs\n$107 510 per QALY gained, while screening every other year vs every third year\nConclusions Annual retinal screening for all patients with type 2 diabetes without\npreviously detected retinopathy may not be warranted on the basis of cost-\neffectiveness, and tailoring recommendations to individual circumstances may be pref-\nerable.

In the baseline case, no direct\ncosts were attributed to blindness, al-\nthough the impact of attributing medi-\ncal and societal costs to blindness was\nexplored in sensitivity analyses. In these\nsensitivity analyses, we used costs of\nblindness from prior cost-effective-\nson between studies. Thus, in the base-\nline case, we used the perspective of a\nthird-party payer, while governmen-\ntal and societal perspectives were ex-\nplored in sensitivity analyses.\nWe evaluated the costs and effective-\nness of screening the US population of\npatients with known type 2 diabetes us-\ning data from NHANES III (Table 2).\nThe proportions and total numbers of\npatients with diabetes in the US popu-\nlation were calculated using the survey\nweights from NHANES III. We as-\nsumed that, at baseline, none of the pa-\ntients had been previously screened, so\nthat at entry, all patients were screened\nat the intervals defined in the model. On\ndiagnosis of retinopathy, patients were\nscreenedannually.Thepredictionsofthe\nmodel (costs and QALYs) were then ap-\npliedtotheUSpatientpopulation,strati-\nfied by age and level of glycemic con-\ntrol. By summing total QALYs and costs\nacrossageandhemoglobinA1c\nstrataand\ncomparing these between screening in-\ntervals, we were able to calculate the\nmarginal cost-effectiveness of increas-\ning screening frequency for the popu-\nlation of patients with type 2 diabetes in\nthe United States.\nOne-way sensitivity analyses were\nconducted on individual estimates to as-\nsess their impact on the costs and effec-\ntiveness of screening. The ranges of es-\ntimates encompass the ranges reported\nin the literature. Because only single\nstudies were available in some cases (eg,\nETDRS and DRS), a range of possible ef-\nfectiveness was estimated for the pur-\nposes of sensitivity analyses.

Results for average pre-\ndicted time spent blind, using the base-\nline case assumptions, are presented in\nTABLE 4. As expected, risk of blind-\nness varies by age and hemoglobin A1c\nlevel. For example, in the absence of a\nscreening program, a 45-year-old pa-\ntient who maintains an average hemo-\nglobin A1c\nlevel of 11% would be pre-\ndicted to spend, on average, 358 days\nblind during his or her lifetime, while\na 65-year-old patient who maintains a\nhemoglobin A1c\nlevel of 7% would be\npredicted to spend, on average, 20 days\nblind. The estimates of risk in Table 4\nclearly show that screening is effective\nand that more frequent screening is\nmore effective. For our prototypical\nhigh-risk case (aged 45 years; average\nhemoglobin A1c\n, 11%), screening ev-\nery 5 years decreases estimated aver-\nage time spent blind by 164 days per\nblind), increasing the screening inter-\nval to every 3 years reduces time spent\nblind by 24 days, and annual screen-\ning further reduces time spent blind by\n21 days. For most groups, however, the\nmarginal return on increasing screen-\ning frequency is small; for example,\nscreening every 3 years vs no screen-\ning for a 65-year-old patient with he-\nmoglobin A1c\nof 7% reduces time spent\ning annually further reduces time spent\nblind to 9 days, but at more than twice\npatient, data not shown).\nThe marginal cost-effectiveness of in-\ncreasing screening frequency, strati-\nfied by age and hemoglobin A1c\nlevels,\nis presented in TABLE 5. Given the di-\nminishing returns accrued by greater\nscreening frequency, it is not surpris-\ning to find that annual screening usu-\nally costs more per QALY gained than\nlessfrequentscreeningintervals. For ex-\nample, for a 65-year-old patient with an\naverage hemoglobin A1c\nlevel of 9%, an\nannual screening program compared\nwith an every other year screening pro-\ngram would result in spending an ad-\nQALY gained. In this same group, ev-\nery other year vs every third year screen-\nQALY gained. For many patients, an-\nnual screening costs are substantially\nmore, with little marginal benefit, when\ncompared with screening every other\nor even every third year. The patients\nwho benefit the most, and for whom\nscreening is most cost-effective, are\nthose who have particularly poor gly-\ncemic control.\nWe examined the accuracy of the\nmodel by comparing the predictions of\nthe model for clinical end points with\nthose observed in the UKPDS. The cu-\nmulative incidence of retinopathy pro-\ngression in the model was similar at all\ntimes to those observed in the UK study\n(eg, for patients with a hemoglobin A1c\nlevel of 7%, the 12-year incidence was\nmodel). Examination of stages be-\nyond initial retinopathy suggest that the\nmodel is highly predictive of the UKPDS\nresults as well. For example, our model\npredicts that UKPDS patients with an\naverage hemoglobin A1c\nlevel of 7% will\nhave a 10-year risk of photocoagula-\nand those with an average hemoglo-\nlevel of 8% will have a 10-year\nrisk of photocoagulation of 10.0% (vs\nCosts and Effectiveness\nin the US Population\nWe used data from NHANES III, a\nrepresentative population-based\nsample of the United States, to pro-\nvide estimates of the levels of glyce-\nmic control and age of the population\nTable 3.

While there are few\ndata suggesting that blindness has a di-\nrect consequence on medical care costs,\nblindness has potential costs such as\ngovernment provision of disability com-\npensation and Medicare.48 One prior\nanalysis estimated values of the social\ncost of blindness ranging from $32 per\nyear for those who become blind at age\nfor those who become blind prior to age\nnumbers have a fairly substantial ef-\nfect on the overall cost-effectiveness of\nthe intervention; in fact, for high-risk\npopulations (those with young onset or\npoor glycemic control), annual screen-\ning appears to save money compared\nwith no screening. However, inclu-\nsion of these costs has minimal im-\npact on the marginal cost-effective-\nness of increasing screening frequency,\nditional QALY gained (compared with\nthe baseline case results) being typi-\ncal. The effect of adding societal costs\nis small because increasing screening\nintervals have only a small impact on\ntime spent blind for most patients with\ntype 2 diabetes.\nThesinglemostimportantvariablein\ndetermining overall costs is the cost of\nthe screening examination.

Other variables af-\nfected the effectiveness of screening, but\nthe influence of these variables was\nnot large across a reasonable range of\nvalues.\nMultivariate sensitivity analyses were\nconducted by creating distributions of\nthe estimates based on the ranges out-\nlined in Table 1 and running repeated\niterations of the model, randomly sam-\nduces a distribution of the cost-\neffectiveness values.

The distribution\nshows only a 17.3% chance that the\nmarginal cost-effectiveness of annual vs\nevery other year screening is greater\nrisk group. In contrast, none of the\nmedium- and low-risk groups demon-\nstrated that annual screening is cost-\neffective compared with every other\nyear screening.\nCOMMENT\nDiabetic eye disease remains a major\ncause of blindness in the United\nStates. Randomized trials have shown\nthat laser photocoagulation can sig-\nnificantly reduce the risk of blindness\nin patients with advanced eye compli-\ncations.2,3 However, optimal screening\nintervals have not been adequately\nevaluated, particularly with regard to\nvariability in eye disease risk in those\nat low risk. Despite this, many organi-\nzations, including the National Com-\nmittee for Quality Assurance, through\nHEDIS measures,11 recommend that\nannual eye examinations be used not\nonly as a general guideline, but as a\nquality standard in all patients with\ndiabetes.\nOur study suggests that such recom-\nmendations may be overzealous. The\nbaselinecaseanalysisshowsthatinmany\ngroups of patients, annual screening of-\nfers very little marginal benefit over ev-\nery other year screening. For some low-\nrisk groups (eg, those with good\nglycemic control, older age, and no reti-\nnopathy on prior examination), every\nthird year screening may be almost as\ngood as annual screening and is a more\ncost-effective approach. In addition to\nhealth care costs, unnecessary patient\nburden must be considered. Patients\nwith diabetes average 8 to 12 outpa-\ntientvisitsannually,49 andvisitsthathave\nlittle expected benefit can compete with\nother recommended care, both in terms\nof health care resources and patient time\nand energy.\nUsing NHANES III to estimate the\ndistribution of age and glycemic con-\ntrol in the United States, we have shown\nthat if a single screening strategy were\nto be recommended for the entire US\npopulation, every other year screen-\ning would seem to be the optimal\nchoice, if the commonly suggested\nis used as the definition of a cost-\neffective intervention.50 However, rec-\nommendations better tailored to indi-\nvidual patient circumstances would\nseem preferable. A number of poten-\ntial screening strategies could be pro-\nposed. For example, annual screening\ncould be recommended for all pa-\ntients with hemoglobin A1c\nvalues over\nin the US population according to\nNHANES III), while the remainder of\nthe population could undergo screen-\ning every 2 to 3 years, with the least fre-\nquent screening interval being re-\nserved for those with excellent glycemic\ncontrol. Monitoring and feedback sys-\ntems would be needed to ensure that\nthis less frequent screening interval did\nnot lead to patients not being screened\nat all. The most aggressive approach\nsupportable by our results would be to\nrecommend that annual screening is the\nsafest strategy, but that if patients\nachieve good glycemic control and have\nnormal results of baseline examina-\ntion, every second or third year screen-\ning is almost as good at preventing\nvisual loss. Under this scenario, pro-\nfessional recommendations do not\nchange, but performance and quality\nmeasures, particularly those associ-\nated with incentive and disincentive\npayments, must recognize that pa-\ntients and physicians might choose less\nfrequent screening intervals.\nWe conducted extensive sensitivity\nanalyses to test the robustness of our\nconclusions. In general, the largest un-\ncertainty is not how little benefit the\nlow-risk patients receive, but pre-\ncisely how large the benefit is to the\nhigher risk, and thus higher benefit, pa-\ntients. Inclusion of a direct cost of blind-\nness into the model had minimal im-\npact on the marginal cost-effectiveness\nof annual screening, although it dra-\nmatically improves the overall cost-\neffectiveness of any screening com-\nTable 7.

Sen-\nsitivity analyses demonstrate that the\nutility of blindness is an important pre-\ndictor of the cost-effectiveness of a\nscreening program, and estimates of av-\nerage utility vary widely.43,45 In addi-\ntion, we were unable to adequately as-\nsess the impact of states of visual\nimpairment less than blindness be-\ncause of limited information on the risks\nand utilities of these states. Because util-\nity is likely to vary dramatically from\npatient to patient, a shared decision-\nmaking approach to retinal screening\nintervals may be best when formulat-\ning a plan of care for patients with dia-\nbetes. Whether we recommend an-\nnual or every second to third year\nscreening, patients should know that\nthe lowest risk will accrue with an-\nnual screening; however, as long as gly-\ncemic control is good, and screening\noccurs every 2 to 3 years, the risk of de-\nveloping blindness is still low. An-\nother potential weakness is that an an-\nnual screening program could allow\nother conditions, such as glaucoma and\ncataracts, to come to earlier medical at-\ntention. However, the impact of screen-\ning for these conditions in a diabetic\npopulation has not been studied.\nThis study is also limited in its abil-\nity to address potential variations in reti-\nnopathy risk in minority populations.\nWhile the risk of retinopathy appears\nto be higher in certain ethnic groups,\nthere continue to be conflicting data on\nlevel of risk,53-55 and some or all of the\nincreased risk may be due to hyperten-\nsion and level of glycemic control.56-58\nIn particular, it should be noted that\nthere are conflicting data on the risks\nof retinopathy in the Hispanic popula-\ntion; recent analyses suggest that el-\nevated risk may persist after adjust-\nment for glycemic control and\nhypertension.58 It should also be noted\nthat the risk estimates used in this\nanalysis were based on the UKPDS\nstudy population, which included mi-\nnorities, but not Hispanic Americans.\nThus, the aggregate estimates may re-\nflect reasonable population, but not pa-\ntient-specific, risks, and certain groups,\nmost notably Hispanics and Native\nAmericans, may not be adequately rep-\nresented in the analysis.\nIt is clear that we can improve the ef-\nficiency of screening by targeting pa-\ntients based on commonly measured\nclinical indicators. Ironically, those who\nwill benefit most from eye screening are\nthe patients whom providers often find\nthe most frustrating to treat; namely,\nthose with poor glycemic control. How-\never, these are the patients who need\nto be the most aggressively screened.\nThis may run counter to a common im-\npulse to give up on other interven-\ntions when patients are noncompliant\nor are unsuccessful with treatments to\nimprove glycemic control. However,\nsetting a standard of having 80% of a\ndiabetes population receiving annual\neye examinations will not be produc-\ntive if the high-risk patients are the ones\nnot being regularly screened.\nOur study suggests that annual reti-\nnal screening for most patients with\ntype 2 diabetes produces little benefit\nthat is not achieved with every second\nto third year screening. Although our\nconclusions would be stronger if there\nwere empirical data on the efficacy of\nvarying screening frequencies, the re-\nsults of this analysis suggest that the of-\nten-cited policy of annual eye screen-\ning for all patients with type 2 diabetes\nshould be reevaluated. Furthermore,\ngroups involved in dissemination of\nquality-of-care standards need to re-\nconsider the marginal benefit of fre-\nquent eye examinations when setting\ntheir quality and performance stan-\ndards. If not, we run the risk of encour-\naging, or even demanding, ineffi-\nciency and requiring care that would\nnot be wanted by many well-informed\npersons with type 2 diabetes.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported in part\nby Veterans Affairs Health Services Research Ser-\nvice and National Institutes of Health grant P60-\nResearch and Development Career Development\nAwardee.\nREFERENCES\n1.
