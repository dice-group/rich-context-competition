A\ncomparison of corpus-based\nand qualitative analyses of\nnews articles about masculinity\nPaul Baker\nLancaster University, UK\nErez Levon\nQueen Mary University of London, UK\n Keywords\nCorpus, discourse, masculinity, qualitative, triangulation\nIntroduction\nCorpus approaches to critical discourse analysis (CDA) have grown in popularity since\nCorresponding author:\nPaul Baker, Department of Linguistics and English Language, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YT, UK.\nEmail: p.baker@lancaster.ac.uk\nArticle\nput forward several arguments for the use of a large body of electronically coded text\nwhich is subjected to analysis of linguistic patterns via computer software. First, findings\nare more likely to be reliable and valid if shown to occur across a larger dataset. Second,\na corpus approach guards against the accusation that critical discourse analysts could\n`cherry-pick' or intentionally select (possibly atypical) data or linguistic features for\nanalysis to prove a preconceived point (Widdowson, 2000, 2004). Third, corpus proce-\ndures offer findings based on frequency patterns so it becomes possible to indicate the\ncommonly realised (and less popular or minority) discourses in societies. Unlike CDA,\ncorpus linguists often take a `bottom-up'or data-driven approach to their research, begin-\nning with few strong (or conscious) hypotheses or expectations about what they will\nfind. Instead, the corpus processes drive the analysis, and linguistic patterns based around\nwhat emerges as frequent or salient need to be accounted for. Furthermore, a corpus\napproach to discourse analysis is not always critical. For example, one school within\nsuch corpus approaches is Corpus Assisted Discourse Analysis (CADS), which is noted\nby Partington et al. (2013) as `not tied to any particular school of discourse analysis...\nunlike CDA, it has no overarching political agenda' (p. 10). On the other hand, the\napproach developed by Baker et al. (2008) is inspired by the Discourse Historical\nApproach (DHA) (Reisgl and Wodak, 2001) and is more oriented towards providing a\ncritical perspective. With corpus approaches being an `emergent' technique for CDA,\nhowever, there are questions about the extent to which such an analysis can usefully sup-\nplement or replace more traditional and qualitative techniques. Additionally, does a\nlarger corpus necessarily guard against cherry-picking? Ultimately, will different meth-\nods produce wildly different results?\nThe main aim of our research was to carry out an experiment where the two authors\nworked independently of each other, one using corpus-based techniques, the other\nfocusing on a qualitative analysis, in order to address the same research question which\ninvolved the representation of different types of masculinity in the British press. The\ncorpus analyst (Baker) used a large corpus of approximately 44.1 million words of\nnewspaper articles stored in electronic form, while the qualitative analyst (Levon) stud-\nied a down-sampled set of 51 articles. We were interested in detecting whether there\nwere broad similarities or differences between the research findings and how this related\nto the different methodologies that were undertaken.1 A point of concern was that there\nwould be no overlap between our findings, or worse, that the two analysts would pro-\nduce contradictory conclusions. A secondary aim was to create and test a means of\ndown-sampling the corpus data for the qualitative analysis as a way of selecting the\nmost representative articles. While down-sampling is certainly a form of `cherry-pick-\ning', we aimed to at least choose cherries from an informed position. Finally, we wanted\nto see whether a form of the `triangulatory' approach that was undertaken here could be\nrecommended to other researchers as a means of producing a better (more complete,\nrigorous, interesting and/or deeper) analysis.\nAfter discussing relevant studies in corpus linguistics and/or CDA that have oriented\ntowards triangulation, we then describe how we collected and down-sampled the corpus\nused in this study. This is followed by an account of the ways that the analyses were car-\nried out, along with a brief summary of the two sets of results. The final sections of this\narticle compare and critique our findings, discussing and attempting to find explanations\nfor the strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques as well as making suggestions for\nhow other researchers could gainfully combine corpus approaches with CDA.\nTriangulation\nIn social science, research triangulation (Cicourel, 1969) involves carrying out two or\nmore approaches as a means of checking results. It is derived from land-surveying tech-\nniques which `determine a single point in space with the convergence of measurements\ntaken from two other distinct points' (Rothbauer, 2008: 892) and can involve the imple-\nmentation of multiple datasets, investigators, theories or methods (Denzin, 1970). In\nqualitative research, triangulation can be used as an alternative to traditional measures of\nreliability and validity, enabling researchers to overcome limitations associated with a\nsingle method or their own biases. CDA often involves triangulation; for example, Van\nDijk (2006) describes his approach to CDA as having a `theoretical framework [that] is\nmulti-disciplinary, articulated by the fundamental triangulation of discourse, cognition\nand society' (p. 115), while Wodak (2007) notes that `One of the most salient features of\nthe discourse-historical approach is its endeavour to work interdisciplinarily, multi-\nmethodically and on the basis of a variety of different empirical data as well as context\nAthird form of triangulation that relates to CDAis in combining close qualitative read-\nings with a corpus linguistics approach that uses computer software to identify frequent\nand salient linguistic patterns over large amounts of data. Such an approach is described\nby Baker et al. (2008) as a `useful methodology synergy'. One strand of this research\ninvolved one team of researchers (Gabrielatos and Baker, 2008) working on an entire\ncorpus of news articles about immigration (140 million words) taken from 19 British\nnewspapers, while another team carried out a close reading (using the DHA) of a smaller\nset of 439 articles which had been down-sampled (KhosraviNik, 2010). The down-sam-\npling was based on taking sets of articles from three newspapers during a small number of\nperiods which had the most articles about immigration. The paper by Baker et al. (2008)\nnoted a couple of differences between the two sets of findings. For example, the DHA `at\ntimes facilitated a more detailed analysis, taking into account larger amounts of textual\ncontext as well as the structure and characteristics of the employed genres' (Baker et al.,\ncorpus-based approach ... uncovered a small number of articles where `positive' topoi of\nRASIM were employed in the corpus. This was different to the CDA analysis, which, focusing\non a smaller number of articles, concluded that positive topoi were almost non-existent. (Baker\nHowever, the paper was more strongly focussed around the ways that the two approaches\ncould be combined into nine stages, advocating moving back and forth recursively between\nqualitative and quantitative forms of analysis in order to generate new hypotheses as well as\nto test existing ones. A pertinent question that arises out of this research is whether the\n\ntechnique for down-sampling produced a representative set of texts for a comparable analy-\nsis with the entire corpus. In focusing on just three newspapers (two broadsheets,\none middle-market) during a small number of short periods of intense discussion about\nimmigration, the CDA was potentially restricted to the analysis around `big news' events\nwhich generated a lot of discussion.\nTwo further studies have attempted to address whether corpus-based approaches to\ndiscourse analysis can help to provide a consistent set of findings independent of analyst\nor even method used. Research by Marchi and Taylor (2009) and Baker (forthcoming)\ninvolved experiments where more than one researcher independently worked with corpus\ndata and then compared results. Marchi and Taylor (2009) used a corpus of newspaper\narticles to address the question `How do journalists talk about themselves/each other and\ntheir profession in a corpus of British media texts?'. They uncovered a mixture of disso-\nnant, converging and complementary findings. The former indicates findings that are\nincompatible with each other, while converging findings are those which confirm one\nanother. Marchi and Taylor (2009: 6) warn that while such findings are often the aim of\ntriangulation (e.g. to demonstrate greater validity), they do not necessarily indicate greater\nreliability as the researchers may be equally wrong. Complementary findings are seen as\npart of a jigsaw puzzle (via Erzberger and Prein, 1997) which `may offer a more complete\nview of the construct which is being investigated, and as such is a highly productive aim'\nindependently on a corpus of newspaper articles about foreign doctors, in order to uncover\nrepresentations of this group. He attempted to summarise and quantify the findings from\nthe reports produced by the analysts, noting that about a quarter of findings were shared\nby at least three out of five analysts (or the majority). This included mostly frequently\nmentioned representations in the corpus, such as foreign doctors constructed as having\npoor English language abilities, being incompetent and requiring tougher regulation.\nHowever, the majority of findings (about two-thirds) were only uncovered by single ana-\nlysts. Such less-mentioned findings related to infrequent phenomena in the corpus, which\nmay explain why they tended to be overlooked in a corpus analysis which usually fore-\ngrounds high frequency phenomena. Baker notes two strategies for analysis that appeared\nto be particularly productive. The first was to carry out one methodological technique in\na very thorough way (e.g. by carrying out a concordance search of a relevant term and\nreading every concordance line carefully, rather than say, a sample of lines). The other\nproductive technique involved using multiple methods as a form of triangulation.\nWith the two studies described above, the analysts were all corpus linguists, although\nthey were free to choose from a range of different tools and techniques and as such the\nmethod sections of each analysis were unique and would have helped to lead researchers\ndown particular analytical routes while closing others off. It is also important to bear in\nmind individual differences as being a factor that is difficult to control for. Even asking\nmultiple researchers to try exactly the same technique could result in unique outcomes as\ncertain aspects of the data may appear more interesting to one person than another. Studies\nlike those described above, along with our own experimental comparison of methods,\nshould not be taken to be definitively controlled in other words. Rather they are indicative\nof the types and amounts of difference and similarity that could be found between two\nmethods, along with suggestions relating to strengths and weaknesses of each.\nThus, our main aim in this study is to carry out a more comprehensive comparison of\ncritical corpus and qualitative methods, akin to the study by Marchi and Taylor (2009)\nwhere two researchers (the authors) separately undertake to analyse either a whole cor-\npus or a down-sampled set. Compared to the study by Baker et al. (2008), we have used\na different method for down-sampling which we feel is more fully representative of the\ncorpus in two ways (number of newspapers and periods of time). Our study focuses on\nthe shared and unique findings elicited from the two approaches, as well as discussing\npossible reasons for any discrepancies. The following section describes the dataset we\ncollected and the two ways in which it was analysed.\nData\nThe online news database Nexis UK was used to build a corpus of British newspaper\narticles about masculinity. Articles were collected from nine daily national newspapers\narticles had to include at least one of the following terms:\nmasculine OR masculinity OR macho OR manhood OR manly OR machismo OR manliness\nOR maleness OR black men OR black man OR asian man OR asian men OR white men OR\nwhite man OR working class man OR working class men OR middle class man OR middle\nclass men OR upper class men OR upper class man.\nAdditionally, a set of excluding terms were used in order to limit repeated articles due\nto some newspapers archiving second editions or regional editions of the same issue. The\nresulting corpus was 44.1 million words in size. The whole dataset was used for the cor-\npus analysis, although clearly it would not be feasible for the close qualitative analysis to\nbe carried out on such a large amount of text. Instead, a down-sampling method was used\nin order to reduce the number of articles to a workable amount. As our research question\ninvolved the representation of and discourses around six male identity groups, we first\nidentified the articles which contained the most references to each group, for example,\nby locating the article which had most mentions of the terms black man and black men\ncombined. This gave us six articles (one for each group), although the set was somewhat\nskewed towards broadsheet newspapers which tended to have longer articles. Therefore,\nin order to provide a more representative coverage from the corpus, we carried out the\nsame exercise again, separately for each of the nine newspapers. This would have\nresulted in a down-sampled set of 54 articles. However, as The Mirror, Sun and Star did\nnot mention upper-class men, the actual set came to 51 articles. We feel that this method\nof down-sampling produced a small set of salient articles where the particular identities\nwe were interested in were likely to be foregrounded as a topic in themselves rather than\nmentioned `in passing'. A question this raises for the comparison, however, is whether\nreferences to men as the main focus of an article will access different discourses to those\nwhere they are more fleetingly eluded to.\nThe two analysts agreed on a research question for their analyses, which was `How\nare different types of men represented in the British press?'. They also agreed to produce\nan analysis consisting of around 3000 words, summarising the main patterns that they\nfound. They then worked without any form of collaboration on their respective datasets\nfor a period of three weeks. The resulting analyses were then exchanged and compared.\nMethods of analysis\nThe corpus analysis was approached relatively `naively' so hypotheses were not formed\nin advance of the analysis, nor were attempts made to link findings to existing theories\nor research on masculinity. Instead it involved using the corpus analysis software\nWordSmith Tools 5 to find the strongest collocates of the six identity groups within the\nentire 44.1 million word corpus. Collocates were obtained using the Dice Coefficient, an\neffect size statistic which is a measure of strength of association between two words.\nSingular and plural identities were considered separately (so, for example, collocates of\nboth the phrases Asian man and Asian men were elicited in two separate searches), and\nthe 20 collocates with the highest Dice score were collected for each search term. This\nresulted in potentially 40 collocates for each identity, although in a few cases collocates\nfor the singular and plural identities were the same (e.g. accused collocates with both\nblack man and black men). The collocational relationships were explored using concord-\nances (tables which show all of the occurrences of a word, phrase or related pair of words\nin the immediate context that they occur in) in order to identify the most typical contexts\nthat they occurred in. In many cases, concordance lines needed to be expanded in order\nto access more context, which sometimes involved reading an entire article. Collocates\nwhich contributed towards similar representations of masculinity were grouped together\nin order to indicate discourse prosodies where a group is frequently associated with a set\nof words that reference the same discourse. An example of this would be the way that\nblack men were positioned as either suspected (with collocates like accused, defends,\ncustody, lawyer, DNA and database), or actual criminals (with collocates like raping,\nrape, prison, confessed, deaths and gang).\nThe analysis also focused on whether discourse prosodies were unique to particular\nidentities or shared between more than one group. Cases where a collocate occurred due\nto the repetition of a single quote across multiple articles on the same story were high-\nlighted as potentially interesting but offering only weak evidence for the generalisabiltiy\nof a particular discourse. An example would be the collocate inarticulate which appears\nwith working-class man. However, this pairing only ever occurred in a repeated quote\nacross numerous articles that is attributed to the then Labour chairman Ian McCartney,\nwho says `When you're basically described, and the best way of paraphrasing, as an\ninarticulate working class man from Glasgow who's very liked but ain't that much good,\nyou know it's a caricature too far'. The quote does indeed suggest that inarticulate is\nseen as a characteristic of being working class, but more evidence would be needed to\nsupport this.\nFor some of the less frequent terms, 20 collocates were not found. In particular, there\nwere only five collocates for upper-class man/men and all of them were grammatical words\nlike of and the. Therefore, rather than examining these collocates, concordance lines of all\nthe cases of upper-class man/men were scrutinised (there were only 31 lines in total).\nThe qualitative analysis of the down-sampled set of articles was situated within a\nframework of stance-taking, or the act of linguistically evaluating a contextually relevant\nobject, and, in so doing, positioning one's self (and others) in social space (Du Bois,\n2007; Jaffe, 2009). Most commonly, stance-taking is viewed as an interactional phenom-\nenon, something that people do in naturally occurring speech. In this analysis, however,\nthe argument put forward in Thurlow and Jaworski (2009) was followed, which states\nthat written discourse, and particularly media texts, can also function as a stance-taking\nvehicle by virtue of its ability to instantiate an ideological framework both for the evalu-\nation of social practice and for the association of those practices with pre-defined social\ncategories and roles (see also Agha, 2007; Kress, 1995). In other words, in much the\nsame way that variation in spoken language provides individuals with a means to adopt\ndifferent footings with respect to the categories and characteristics referenced through\ntalk, it is argued that the textual properties of written discourse serve to encode different\nsocio-interpretive schema within which relevant social categories and category-affiliated\nactivities are positioned and evaluated. Given this point of departure, the primary aim of\nthe analysis of the down-sampled set is therefore to determine what ideological frame-\nwork for masculinity the texts serve to instantiate, and to discover how the different\nmasculine identities in question are positioned within this space.\nThis task was approached by asking three basic questions of the texts in the sample\nis the stance object, or the particular category or trait being described and assessed, (2)\nhow is that object evaluated (affectively, epistemically and deontically) and (3) how do\nthese evaluations serve to position that object relationally in social space? Due to the\ndesign of the current study, the first question \u00ad while often highly relevant with interac-\ntional data \u00ad is relatively trivial in our sample. The down-sampled set is structured\naccording to frequency of occurrence of the relevant search terms, and so each of these\nterms (e.g. black man/men, white man/men) were taken to be the respective stance\nobjects. The qualitative investigation therefore focuses on resolving the two latter ques-\ntions, which was accomplished by examining a range of both formal and semantic fea-\ntures, including clause modality, presupposition and implicature, and verbal argument\nstructure. The analysis began with an investigation of discourses of `masculinity' more\ngenerally, as opposed to texts that focus on any one specific masculine type. This\nallowed the identifications of the broader ideological topography (Bourdieu, 1979) of\nmasculinity that exists in the sample as a whole. Then, the analysis turned to an exami-\nnation of the specific masculine types, and a discussion of the ways in which they are\ndiscursively constructed as being more or less desirable, worthwhile and even morally\nsound than others.\nComparison of findings\nRather than providing the full analysis reports, in this section we carry out a\nmeta-analysis which involves comparing and contrasting the two reports together. We\nhave first divided our meta-analysis into a discussion of shared and unique findings, and\nthen we move on to attempting to provide an explanation for the differences and similari-\nties of the two approaches, as well as more critically evaluating the strengths and weak-\nnesses of each, and the extent to which a combined approach would eliminate weaknesses.\nWe should note that unlike Marchi and Taylor (2009), the comparison did not uncover\nany discordant findings (where we directly or indirectly disagreed), so all of our findings\nwere either converging (shared) or complementary (different but contributing towards a\nwider picture).\nShared findings\nAs noted earlier, the corpus analysis found a discourse prosody of black men as suspected\nor actual criminals due to the presence of collocates like accused, custody, rape, prison,\nconfessed and gang. Black men were also constructed as physically over-powering or\nimpressive due to the use of collocate tall. The qualitative analysis noted a related con-\nstruction of black men as violent and also indicated an over-abundance of physicality.\nBoth analyses noted some common stereotypes around representations of black men, as\nwell as the "
