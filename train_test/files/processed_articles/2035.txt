Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a\ncommon endocrine disorder, affecting 4\u00ad8% of reproductive-age\nwomen (Azziz et al., 2004). In addition to ovulatory dysfunction and\nhyperandrogenism, PCOS is associated with a constellation of meta-\nbolic and CVD risk factors otherwise known as metabolic syndrome\n(Ehrmann et al., 2006). In addition to dyslipidema (Legro et al.,\n2001), women with PCOS have been noted to have high rates of\nglucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes (Ehrmann et al., 1999;\nLegro et al., 1999), that are present even in adolescents (Palmert\nWomen with PCOS have an increased risk of subclinical athero-\nsclerosis as indicated by endothelial dysfunction (Paradisi et al.,\n2001), increased carotid artery intima media thickness (Talbott\net al., 2000), and increased coronary artery calcification compared\nwith reproductively normal control women of similar age and weight\n(Christian et al., 2003). It has been suggested that, due to its preva-\nlence and its metabolic risk factors, PCOS may account for a significant\nproportion of atherosclerotic heart disease observed in women\n(Dahlgren et al., 1992).

The Nurse's Health Study has shown an\nincreased CVD event rate in post-menopausal women with a\nhistory of oligomenorrhea during their reproductive years (Solomon\net al., 2002). Similarly, prospective studies of post-menopausal\nwomen with androgen excess have shown them to have more\nsevere coronary artery disease and higher CVD event rates (Shaw\nPCOS is likely a complex genetic disease (Ewens et al., 2010) that is\nclearly modified by the environment (i.e. more severe phenotype with\nobesity). We and others have shown that elevated CVD risk clusters\nin first-degree relatives, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and dia-\ningly, parents of affected women provide an opportunity to investigate\nPCOS-related CVD risk in a population at an age where these events\nbecome common, and also represent a group with environment and\ngenes shared with their daughters. We hypothesized that there would\nbe an increased CVD risk in parents of women with PCOS and an\nincreased prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk based on\nthe Framingham Risk Assessment Tool for estimating the 10-year risk\nof developing CHD (myocardial infarction and coronary death).\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy subjects\nWomen with PCOS and their parents were recruited into an ongoing phe-\nnotype/genotype study of PCOS families between the years of 2001 and\n2005. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of\nNorthwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and the Penn\nState College of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.\nPCOS probands were defined by the 1990 NIH-NICHD criteria of\nhyperandrogenic chronic anovulation with exclusion of other etiologies\n(Zawadski and Dunaif, 1992). To qualify as a PCOS proband, a woman\nhad to have six or fewer menses per year in addition to hyperandrogen-\nemia defined by either total testosterone (T) more than 58 ng/dl and/\nor non-sex hormone-binding globulin-bound T more than 15 ng/dl,\nlevels .2 SD values above the mean value established in reproductively\nnormal women aged 18\u00ad40-year-old in the early follicular phase of the\nmenstrual cycle (Legro et al., 1998). Probands were not taking any\nconfounding medications that alter sex steroid metabolism or insulin sen-\nsitivity and were age 15\u00ad44 years. Non-classical 21-hydroxylase\ndeficiency, hyperprolactinemia, androgen-secreting tumors, thyroid\ndisease and pregnancy were excluded by appropriate tests before the\ndiagnosis of PCOS was made (Legro et al., 1998).\nStudy design\nA total of 410 PCOS probands from the two participating sites were\nstudied, along with participating parents. The majority of the participants\nresided in Pennsylvania; however, 35 states were represented for pro-\nbands, 35 states for mothers and 34 states for fathers. We obtained\nmedical history, biometric information and fasting blood according to\nour standard phenotyping protocol (Legro et al., 1998). Standardized\nforms were used to obtain personal medical history, including history of\ncardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, tobacco\nuse and current prescription medications. The participant was asked to\nrecall any `heart attack' or `stroke' within their immediate family, requiring\nthat they specify during which of three age ranges the event occurred for\nSubjects who completed the study on-site had their blood pressure,\nheight and weight measurements performed by clinical research staff.\nSome of the subjects were studied off-site. Off-site subjects self-reported\ntheir height and weight measurements. We have previously validated self-\nreported height and weight (Sam et al., 2006). All subjects had blood\nsamples, which were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast,\nand levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-\nterol were assayed (Legro et al., 2002a). Data on reproductive and meta-\nbolic phenotypes, including fasting glucose, lipid and lipoprotein levels,\nhave been reported on some of the probands and mothers and fathers\nReference population\nIn order to determine the prevalence of CVD events and risk factors in a\nreference group, we used a US population-based sample of comparable\ngender, mean age and mean BMI data abstracted from the nationwide\ndatabase (www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). All records from the NHANES\ndatabase were selected such that they were gender appropriate,\nwithin +1 year in age, and within+ 0.5 kg/m2 in BMI of subjects in\neach of our subsets (probands, mothers and fathers) (Sam et al., 2006;\nmetric measurements, blood pressure and fasting glucose and lipid levels\nand was sampled from all U.S. households during this time frame.\nFramingham CHD score\nA CVD risk score was calculated for subjects aged 20 years and older who\nhad no cardiovascular events or diagnosis of diabetes using the online\nNational Cholesterol Education Program calculator (http://hp2010.\nnhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp). We chose this method because it is\ncommonly used clinically and has been validated in other populations in\nthe USA (D'Agostino et al., 2001). The algorithm predicts the 10-year\nrisk of coronary events using the following measurements: age, gender,\ntotal and HDL cholesterol levels, smoking status, current use of anti-\nhypertensive medications and systolic blood pressure. These parameters\nwere measured at the time of the subject's visit to the center and from\ninformation noted in their completed medical history.\nStatistical analysis\nMany parents did not participate in the study and thus were not pheno-\ntyped. Exclusion of non-studied parents could potentially bias the\nresults, for example, a non-studied parent may have been unable to par-\nticipate in the study due to death or incapacitation from a CVD event. The\ninclusion of non-studied parents in the analysis to reduce this potential bias\nrequired the use of proband reporting of non-studied parental CVD\nevents. Validation for using proband reporting of parental CVD events\nwas undertaken by calculating the kappa statistic and 95% confidence\ninterval to assess the agreement between the probands and their\nstudied parents' reporting of parental CVD events.\nThe selected NHANES data as described under the Reference Popu-\nlation section was weighted appropriately as per NHANES study instruc-\ntions to provide population parameters of heart attack, stroke and 10-year\nFramingham CHD risk score. The one-sample binomial exact test was\nused to compare heart attack and stroke prevalence in the PCOS families\nwith the reference population from NHANES. The one-sample t-test was\nused to compare the Framingham 10-year CHD risk of the PCOS families\nto the NHANES reference population.\nResults\nValidation of proband reports of parental\nCVD history\nProband parental history reports were compared with the surveys\ncompleted by their respective parents. Two hundred eleven\nmothers (52%) completed surveys and were included in the validation\nprocess. One hundred eighty fathers (44%) completed surveys and\nwere included in the validation process. Ninety-eight percent (379/\n387) of the parents were in agreement with the proband's report of\nNinety-nine percent (371/376) were in agreement with the proband's\nCardiovascular events\nDemographic characteristics of the PCOS probands, mothers and\nfathers and their respective NHANES reference groups displayed in\nTables I and II show the prevalence of cardiovascular events in the\ndifferent subject populations. We found only one self-reported CVD\nevent in a PCOS proband: a stroke at age 12. Given that an exponen-\ntial increase in CVD events occurs for men at age 55 years, 56% of our\nfathers qualified as being in the higher-risk age group. The prevalence\nof heart attack and stroke in fathers of women with PCOS was signifi-\ncantly increased compared with the NHANES population. All other\noccurrences of CVD events in PCOS probands and mothers were\nnot significant compared with our reference population. However,\nthe exponential increase in CVD events occurs for women at age\n65 years; only 7% of our mothers were in the higher-risk age group.\n10-year calculated CHD risk\nThe factors shown in Table III were used to estimate the Framingham\n10-year CHD risk for the different subject populations. Subjects were\nonly included in this analysis if we had complete information on all risk\nfactors included in the Framingham calculation. The proband fathers\nhad an increased risk profile compared with the NHANES population\n(P \u00bc 0.03; Table IV). The 10-year CHD risk for both probands and\ntheir mothers did not differ from their respective NHANES population.\nDiscussion\nOur study noted an increased prevalence of heart attack (11.1 versus\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................\nTable I Demographics for PCOS families and NHANES reference population.\nProband,\nn (%)\nFemale NHANES controls\nfor probanda (%)\nMother,\nn (%)\nFemale NHANES controls\nfor mothera (%)\nFather,\nn (%)\nMale NHANES controls\nfor fathera (%)\nRace\nMean (SD) Mean Mean (SD) Mean Mean (SD) Mean\nNHANES, The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\naNHANES data were appropriately weighted to obtain a population parameter for the proportion or the mean; therefore, no sample size or estimate of variability is provided.\n......................................................................................................... ..............................................................................\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................\nTable II Prevalence for CVD events in PCOS families and NHANES reference population.\nHeart Attack Stroke\nRelation PCOS family data\nfraction (%)\nNHANES dataa (%) P-valueb PCOS Family\nData Fraction (%)\nNHANES dataa (%) P-valueb\naNHANES data were appropriately weighted to only obtain a population parameter for the proportion of events; therefore, no sample sizes are provided.\nbOne-sample binomial exact test.\nCHD risk in fathers of women with PCOS compared with population\nof similar age and BMI. There was no statistically significant increased\nprevalence of events in women with PCOS or their mothers, nor was\nthere an increased 10-year CHD risk compared with the women in\nstudy thus suggests that first-degree male members of PCOS families\nhave both increased risk and corresponding event rates, whereas\nfemales are relatively normal.\nSeveral studies have investigated the risk of CVD in family members\net al., 2007). These studies have been limited by small sample sizes\n(,100 subjects). In addition, control populations for these studies\nwere small and ascertained from disparate sources, for example,\nfrom infertility clinics. Thus, the control populations were subject to\nselection bias and were, perhaps, not representative of the larger\npopulation. Hunter et al. (2007) showed an increased CVD risk in\nbrothers but not fathers of women with PCOS based on survey of\nthe proband with PCOS. This study was limited by an inconsistent\ndiagnosis of PCOS and by the fact that the investigators did not\nsurvey or phenotype the other first-degree relatives. Yilmaz et al.\n(2005) showed an increased risk of CVD in both fathers and\nmothers of women with PCOS. This study was designed similarly to\nours, and our mothers' ages were overlapping. Atiomo et al. (2003)\nshowed an increased number of women with PCOS who had a posi-\ntive family history of heart attacks. However, it is unclear what signified\na parental history of heart attacks for the study, as it was not specified\nif the affected family member was a parent, sibling, aunt/uncle or\ngrandparent.\nOur study finds an increased risk for CVD events only in fathers.\nThis is consistent with our previous studies noting clustering of CVD\nrisk factors in first-degree male relatives of probands (Sam et al.,\nscope of the study. However, the increased prevalence of hyperten-\nsion and use of hypertensive medications among the fathers who\nwere phenotyped compared with the NHANES reference group\nsuggests this significant CVD risk factor was a major contributor to\nour findings. Our failure to detect an increased risk of CVD events\nin affected women and their mothers may reflect their relatively\nyoung age since CVD events do not become prevalent in women\nuntil the seventh to eighth decades of life. Given that an exponential\nincrease in CVD events occurs for men at age 55 years, 56% of our\nfathers qualified as being in the higher-risk age group. However, the\nexponential increase in CVD events occurs for women at age 65\nyears; only 7% of our mothers are in the higher-risk age group. It is,\ntherefore, possible that our results may differ were we to enroll\nolder female subjects or to observe our present cohort longer.\nWe also did not find an increased 10-year risk of CVD events in\nwomen with PCOS or their mothers, in contrast to previous studies\nreflect the fact that while there were relative abnormalities in risk\nfactors in women compared with a reference population, including\nthey were not substantial enough to increase the calculated CVD\nrisk score. Alternatively, there may be some aspects of PCOS that\nare protective against CVD events. For example, prolonged ovarian\nreserve in women with PCOS may provide a longer window of\nsex steroid production and cardiovascular protection in women\nOur study, like all of the others on the topic, was limited by the ret-\nrospective nature of the study and by the relatively small sample size.\nThough cardiovascular events are major life-changing occurrances, it is\npossible that recall bias may lead to lapses in the parent either directly\ndocumenting it or communicating it to their daughters.

Our study was strengthened by\nstandardized phenotyping of subjects with PCOS and by systematic,\nprospective collection of CVD event history. Further, we have vali-\ndated that a proband report of a parental CVD event had a high con-\ncordance with the parent report (98% for heart attack and stroke).\nThis concordance reduced the likelihood of underestimating of event\nrates when a parent was lost to follow-up due to a fatal or incapacitat-\ning CVD event. The NHANES data allow for comparison with a large\ncross section of the U.S. general population. However, there were\ndifferences in the recruitment of subjects and the ascertainment of\noutcomes between NHANES and our study that could confound\nour findings. For example, the history of events was obtained by\nin-person home interview in NHANES and by standardized question-\nnaire in our study, potentially resulting in selective reporting of actual\nevents. Further we chose a time point in the NHANES data that was\nroughly halfway between our start and completion date for this study,\nsuch that changing cardiovascular event rates could alter our findings.\nFinally, it is impossible with such a study design to control for all\nconfounding factors between the NHANES study and our case\nseries. For example, we did not control for smoking, and we found\nhigher rates of diabetes in our families than in the NHANES reference\npopulation. The prevalence of diabetes in our probands was 5%, in\nour mothers was 17%, and in our fathers was 20%. Whereas in the\ngender and age-relevant NHANES population it was 2% for probands,\n6% for mothers and 11% for fathers. However, based on the patho-\nphysiology of PCOS as a disorder of insulin resistance, we would\nexpect this diabetes discrepancy.\nAs awareness and proper diagnosis of PCOS increases, larger\nstudies of the long-term comorbidities of this syndrome will become\nmore feasible. We conclude that there is an increase in CVD events\nand risk in fathers of women with PCOS. This is a distinct population\nwho can be targeted for early screening and surveillance for CVD.\nStudy of shared environment and genes may shed light on a\ncommon etiology to PCOS in daughters and CVD disease in fathers.\nAuthors' roles\nM.C.T., A.R.K., A.R.K., C.M.S., A.D., R.L. researched data, contribu-\nted to discussion, reviewed/edited manuscript.
