Characterizing patient\nfactors associated with adherence is also important given evi-\ndence from clinical trials suggesting that as long as adherence\nis sustained, BP effects persist.12,13 Previous studies have sug-\ngested that both poor physician adherence to treatment guide-\nlines and poor patient adherence to recommended therapy are\npossible reasons for low rates of BP control.15\u00ad21 However, even\nif physicians did prescribe lifestyle changes, patients might not\nhave understood the counseling and in effect, not have received\nthem. To assess how frequently patients with hypertension\nreport receiving lifestyle modification counseling, and to\nexplore which patient characteristics, including BP control, are\nassociated with the receipt of and adherence to such counseling,\nwe examined results from a nationally representative survey of\nadults who had been previously diagnosed with hypertension.\n1Institute for Health Policy and Department of Medicine, Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 2The Brigham andWomen's-\nFaulkner Hospitalist Program, Department of Medicine, Brigham andWomen's\nHospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 3The Division\nof General Internal Medicine, Brigham andWomen's Hospital, Harvard\nMedical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 4Department of Epidemiology,\nHarvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 5VA Greater Los\nAngeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, California, USA; 6The Department\nof Health Care Policy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nCorrespondence: Lenny Lopez (llopez1@partners.org)\n\u00a9 2009 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.\nLifestyle Modification Counseling for Hypertensive\nPatients: Results From the National Health and\nBackground\nLifestyle modification is recommended for all patients with the\ndiagnosis of hypertension.\nMethods\nWe examined 3,497 adult hypertensive participants (representing\n42 million Americans), from the National Health and Nutrition\ndemographic, and clinical factors of participants who reported\nreceiving lifestyle counseling and their adherence.\nResults\nOf the 3,497 participants with hypertension, 84% reported receiving\nlifestyle modification counseling. After adjustment for demographic\nand clinical characteristics, non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to\nreport receiving counseling (odds ratio (OR), 2.5; P < 0.001) when\ncompared to whites. Men (OR, 1.5; P = 0.02) reported receiving\ncounseling more often than women as well as those with Medicare\ninsurance (OR, 1.5; P = 0.02) compared to the privately insured.\nParticipants who were hypercholesterolemic (OR, 1.7; P < 0.001),\n(OR 3.0; P < 0.001) reported receiving lifestyle counseling more often\nthan those without these conditions. Of those receiving counseling,\n88% reported adhering to those recommendations. After adjustment\nfor demographic and clinical characteristics, only non-Hispanic\nmore likely to report adhering when advised.\nConclusions\nHigh cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients had high rates of\nlifestyle counseling. However, gaps exist in lifestyle counseling for\nyoung and low cardiovascular risk hypertensive patients. In addition,\ndifferences in rates of adherence exist especially in those with high\ncardiovascular risk comorbid conditions. Future work is needed\nto increase adherence to lifestyle counseling for all hypertensive\npatients.\narticles Lifestyle Modification Counseling for Hypertensives\nMethods\nStudy population. Using data from the National Health and\nexamined adult participants aged >20 years who reported\nbeing told by a provider on two or more different visits that\nthey had hypertension or \"high BP.\" We limited our analysis to\npatients who reported at least two observations of elevated BP\nbecause, unlike patients noted to have an isolated elevated BP,\npublished hypertension guidelines at the time recommended\nthat these patients should have received hypertension treat-\nment with lifestyle therapy (e.g., lose weight, increase exercise,\ncut down on salt intake, quit smoking or decrease alcohol con-\nsumption) with or without medication.14,22\nSurvey data. NHANES is a complex, stratified multistage\nprobability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US\npopulation comprised an interview questionnaire, a physical\nexam, and a laboratory test section. The current NHANES\nis a continuous survey with the data release cycle altered to\nevery 2 years. We followed current recommendations from the\nNational Center for Health Statistics and considered the time\n6-year sample weights for all analyses. A detailed description\nof the history, design, data collection, and available data for\nNHANES is available at the website of the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).23\nMain outcomes of interest were the odds of reporting receipt\nof and of adhering to lifestyle modification recommendations.\nThe NHANES interview questions assessing receipt of and\nadherence to lifestyle modification recommendations are pro-\nvided in Table 1. As NHANES does not provide detailed clini-\ncal history to completely determine which lifestyle counseling\neach participant should be receiving, we deemed participants\nto have received lifestyle counseling if they responded \"yes\" to\nany one of the questions in order to improve their BP listed\nin Table 1. Participants were determined to have not received\nlifestyle therapy if they received only medication therapy or no\ntherapy at all. We deemed participants to be adherent if they\nresponded \"yes\" to appropriate follow-up questions regard-\ning adherence. In cases where participants received multiple\nlifestyle therapies, they are considered adherent if they replied\nthat they are adherent to any of the lifestyle therapies. We also\nincluded the question of whether the participant reported ever\nbeing told to take antihypertensive medications for secondary\nanalyses of the association between BP and the choice of phy-\nsician therapeutic intervention.\nFrom the survey, we also obtained participants' self-reported\nrace/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was coded in NHANES as non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nother Hispanic, and other/multiracial. We grouped Mexican\nAmerican and other Hispanic into one category. Financial\nstatus was categorized using the poverty income ratio, where\nfamily income is divided by the federally defined poverty\nthreshold for that family (poverty income ratio <1 indicated\nimpoverished). Low educational level was defined by noncom-\npletion of 12th grade. Insurance status was defined as medi-\ncal coverage provided by Medicare, Medicaid, private sources\n(including government and single service insurance) or having\nno insurance. Diabetes was defined as self-report of physician\ndiagnosis or as current or past user of insulin or oral hypogly-\ncemic agent. We excluded diabetes diagnoses made during\npregnancy. History of CVD included congestive heart failure,\ncoronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and\nstroke. We also included whether participants reported having\na usual source of health care.\nExamination and laboratory data. From the NHANES exami-\nnation and laboratory files we obtained participants body mass\nindex (BMI). Overweight was defined as a BMI of 25\u00ad29kg/m2\nand obesity was defined as BMI 30kg/m2. BP was measured\nthree or four times manually by a trained operator using a\nmercury sphygmomanometer according to a standard proto-\ncol and calculated as the average after excluding the first meas-\nurement. The BP measurement techniques were identical over\nStatistical analysis. Each survey oversampled non-Hispanic\nblacks, Mexican Americans, and individuals aged 60. Special\nsampleweightsprovidedbyNationalCenterforHealthStatistics\nwere included in the analysis to adjust for oversampling as well\nas nonresponse bias and post-stratification population totals.\nSampling errors were obtained using a Taylor linear approxi-\nmation method with replacement.23 Due to the complex design\nof NHANES, SUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle\nTable 1| NHANES questions assessing receipt of and adherence to lifestyle modification advice\nLifestyle modification counseling Compliance to lifestyle modification counseling\nBecause of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you\never been told to control your weight or lose weight?\nAre you now controlling your weight or losing weight?\nBecause of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you\never been to told to cut down on salt or sodium in your diet?\nAre you now cutting down on salt or sodium in your diet?\nBecause of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you ever\nbeen told to exercise more?\nAre you now exercising more?\nBecause of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you\never been told to cut down your alcohol consumption?\nAre you now cutting down on your alcohol consumption?\nBecause of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you\never been told to do something else?

We used the 2-test to com-\npare the distribution of study variables among patients who\nreceived and adhered to counseling. Factors significantly asso-\nciated with either receiving or adhering to lifestyle recommen-\ndations were then included in a multivariable-logistic regres-\nsion analysis to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with\n95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of receiving and adhering\nto lifestyle counseling. The following demographic and clinical\nvariables were included in our models (age, gender, race, US\nborn, insurance status, income and education level, having a\nusual place of care, BMI, diabetes, high cholesterol, and CVD).\nAll P values reported are for two-tailed tests and a value of <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant. In secondary analyses,\nwe performed analysis of variance to compare the association\nbetween receipt of lifestyle modification alone, medication use\nalone, or receipt of both therapeutic modalities, with mean\nsystolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels at the time of the\nsurvey. Similar analyses of variance were done to examine the\nassociation between participant adherence to the therapeutic\nmodality recommended and mean SBP and DBP levels.\nResults\nParticipant and clinical characteristics\ning receipt of lifestyle modification counseling, representing\n42 million Americans. Of participants with hypertension, 78%\nwere non-Hispanic white, 14% were non-Hispanic black, and\n8% were Hispanics (Table 2). Those who were >60 years of age\ncomprised 46% of the adult hypertensive population and 42%\nwere 41\u00ad60 years of age. There were slightly more women than\nmen and the majority were born in the United States. Overall,\nmost of the participants were privately insured and had a usual\nplace of care. A small proportion of the study sample was\npoor and had less than a 12th grade education. The majority\nof hypertensive participants were overweight or obese and had\nhigh cholesterol. A smaller proportion of the participants had\nCVD or diabetes.\nReceipt of lifestyle modification counseling\nOf the adult hypertensive population, 84.3% reported receiving\nlifestyle modification counseling. Of these, 81.7% were advised\nto reduce their dietary sodium, 79.3% to exercise more, 65.5%\nto lose weight, 31% to reduce alcohol consumption, and 4.4%\nto quit smoking.\nIn unadjusted analyses, participants who were aged >40\nyears, had a usual place of care, were obese (BMI 30), diabetic\nor had high cholesterol reported receiving lifestyle counseling\nmore often than their counterparts (Table 2). In addition, non-\nHispanic blacks reported more often receiving counseling than\nHispanics and non-Hispanic whites.\nDemographic differences in receipt of counseling remained\nafter adjustment for demographic and clinical character-\nistics. Men continued to report receiving counseling more\noften than women and non-Hispanic blacks more often than\nnon-\nHispanic whites. Participants with Medicare insurance\nreported receiving counseling more often than those with\nother insurance groups. Participants with high cholesterol,\ndiabetes, or who were overweight (BMI 25\u00ad29), or obese (BMI\n30) reported receiving lifestyle counseling more often than\ntheir counterparts (Table 3).\nThe type of physician intervention reported by partici-\npants depended on the underlying BP (Figure 1). Those par-\nticipants who reported receiving only medication advice had\nthe highest mean SBPs (139mmHg), followed by those who\nreported getting both lifestyle counseling and medication\nadvice (136mmHg), followed by those who only got advice\n(132mmHg). Those who reported no physician advice inter-\nvention had the lowest mean SBP (129mmHg) of the cohort\n(P values across all four groups P < 0.001).\nThere was a small difference between the four groups in\nmean DBP (overall P < 0.001). Those who reported receiving\nonly medication advice had a mean DBP of 72mmHg while\nthose that reported getting both lifestyle counseling and medi-\ncation advice had a mean DBP of 74mmHg. Participants who\nreported receiving only lifestyle advice had a mean DBP of\n77mmHg while those reporting no physician intervention\nhad a mean DBP of 74mmHg.\nAdherence to lifestyle modification counseling\nOf the adult hypertensive population that received counseling,\n88% reported adhering to those recommendations. The major-\nity reported adhering to the advice of reducing dietary sodium\nreducing their alcohol intake, 59% adhered to increasing their\nexercise level and none claimed adherence to smoking cessa-\ntion advice.\nIn unadjusted analyses, participants who were >60 years of\nage, had a usual place of care, were Medicaid recipients, or had\ndiabetes reported the highest rates of adherence (Table 2). In\naddition, non-Hispanic blacks more often reported adherence\nwhen compared to Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.\nAfter adjustment for demographic and clinical characteris-\ntics, sociodemographic differences in adherence to counseling\npersisted with, participants who were >60 years of age and\nnon-Hispanic blacks were more likely to report adhering when\nadvised compared to non-Hispanic whites (Table 3).\nParticipants who reported adherence to lifestyle modifi-\ncation counseling had higher mean SBPs. The mean SBP of\nreported noncompliance (P = 0.002). The mean DBP of those\nwho reported being compliant was 74 vs. 75 for those who\nreported noncompliance (P = 0.46). Of adherent participants,\n91% took medication while 81% of the nonadherents took\nmedications.\nIn addition, there were modest differences in SBP and DBP\nacross type of participant reported adherence. The mean SBP\nfor adherence to medication advice alone was 139mmHg,\n133mmHg for adherence to lifestyle advice alone and\n137mmHg for those adhering to both therapeuric modali-\nties (P = 0.09).

Our study has several\nmajor findings. In our sample, representing 42.7 million adult\nhypertensive individuals in the United States, we found high\nrates of lifestyle counseling among men, non-Hispanic blacks,\nthose with Medicare insurance and especially in those with\nclinical comorbidities. However, we also found that significant\ngaps exist in lifestyle counseling for young adult hyperten-\nsive patients and those hypertensive patients who have fewer\ncomorbid cardiovascular risks. After multivariate adjustment,\nonly non-Hispanic blacks and those aged >60 were more likely\nto report adhering when advised. In addition, participants\nwith the highest SBPs were more likely to report only medica-\ntion advice and those with the lowest SBPs were more likely to\nreport only lifestyle advice.\nIt is well known that diabetes, obesity, and elevated cho-\nlesterol are all associated with increased morbidity and mor-\ntality. In addition, being overweight has now been shown to\nhave deleterious effects.24\u00ad27 Although a high rate of overall\nlifestyle counseling was reported by the participants, we found\nsignificant differences in lifestyle counseling rates by clinical\ncharacteristics.20,28,29 We found that adults with hypertension\nand who were overweight or obese, diabetic, or with elevated\ncholesterol were more likely to report receiving lifestyle modi-\nfication counseling. This is consistent with a previous study\nfinding that diabetic patients are more likely to get more CVD\nprevention services than nondiabetic patients.30 A recent\nstudy of physician behavior demonstrates that the quality of\ncare actually increases as the patient's number of chronic con-\nditions increases.31 However, it has also been shown that rates\nof recommendations for lifestyle interventions are suboptimal\namong low cardiovascular risk patients.21 This is consistent\nwith our findings that significant gaps exist in lifestyle coun-\nseling for patients who have not yet developed comorbid con-\nditions or target organ damage and interventions to improve\nthese rates should be studied.\nHigher rates of counseling by health-care providers are\nindicative of closer guideline adherence and point to an\nimprovement in the quality of hypertension care nation-\nally.2 Both sixth and seventh report of the Joint National\nCommittee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and\nTreatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommend\nlifestyle counseling for all hypertensive patients regardless of\ntheir BP range.14,22 Although there was a high level of life-\nstyle counseling in certain groups of patients in our study,\nJoint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection,\nEvaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guide-\nlines appeared to be followed unevenly by physicians. In our\nanalysis, participants reported their physicians were more\nlikely to prescribe only medication advice for those with the\nhighest SBPs and only lifestyle advice to those with the low-\nest SBPs. For patients with the highest SBPs, providers may\nbe starting patients directly on medication because their BP\nwas more poorly controlled at baseline. However, because\nof the cross-sectional design of NHANES, it is not possible\nto ascertain the causal effects of BP on physicians' lifestyle\nrecommendations.\nTable 3| Significant adjusted predictors of receipt of and\nadherence to lifestyle modification counseling\nCharacteristics\nOdds ratio\nfor receipt of\nOdds ratio for\nadherence to\nAge, years\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nInsurance\nWeight (BMI)\nUsing multivariable-logistic regression, adjusting for all listed characteristics and income\nlevel, education level, US born, usual place of care and cardiovascular disease.\nBMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval.\nDBP\nNone\nGot both\nOnly advise\nOnly medication\nSBP\nFigure 1 | Mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and type of\nadvice given.

Multiple studies, including physician and\npatient surveys, have demonstrated varying levels of physi-\ncian adherence to hypertension guidelines.15\u00ad21 Most have\ndocumented low levels of guideline adherence. However, the\nmajority of these studies focus on the use of pharmacological\ntherapy while our study focuses on lifestyle modification. In\naddition, one study has shown poor physician knowledge of\nlifestyle recommendations.21\nAfter multivariable adjustment, non-Hispanic blacks\nreported higher rates of adherence when compared to non-\nHispanic whites. This finding is consistent with previous stud-\nies using nationally representative data.29,32 This high rate of\nadherence may represent true self-perceived adherence efforts\nand a high degree of self-motivation and participation with\ntheir health providers.33 Patients counseled by physicians to\nmodify behavior are more confident and motivated and may\nbe more successful.33\u00ad36 The high rate of adherence could also\nrepresent acquiescent-response tendency. Previous studies\nhave documented that non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics are\nmore likely to answer affirmatively to yes/no questions regard-\nless of question content or phrasing.37,38\nOur study found that participants who reported adherence\nto lifestyle modification counseling, 91% of whom were tak-\ning medication, had higher mean SBPs compared to those who\nreported receiving counseling but did not adhere. These find-\nings are consistent with previous national studies showing low\nhypertension control and room for improvement, even among\npatients treated for hypertension.1\u00ad4,7 One possible explana-\ntion for this association may be that patients with poorly con-\ntrolled BP are more motivated to adhere to recommended\nlifestyle changes. Alternatively, these findings may also repre-\nsent patients who are not yet at goal but require multiple thera-\npeutic interventions for BP control.\nPrevious trials have demonstrated that despite a general\nassumption that older individuals are \"set in their ways,\" age\ndid not affect the ability to make lifestyle changes.39 Our anal-\nysis highlights that younger patients (<60 years) are less likely\nto adhere. This is an important intervention point in light of\nthe increasing burden of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity\nin younger age groups. In addition, this patient population has\na longer period of time to develop serious end organ damage\nfrom these comorbidities.\nNHANES has been routinely used to provide an estimate of\npatients' activities and may reflect the patients' understanding\nof their medical care.1,3\u00ad5 However, there are several limita-\ntions to this study. Given that NHANES is a cross-sectional\nsurvey, we are only able to test factors associated with receipt\nand adherence to lifestyle recommendations but are unable to\nestablish causality. In addition, the NHANES questions do not\nallow determination of when in the clinical course of hyperten-\nsion management the participant received lifestyle counseling.\nBecause of participant self-report, recall failure and biases may\nhave been introduced. Furthermore, we do not have detailed\ninformation on the appropriateness, content, or intensity of\ncounseling, nor do we have data on use of ancillary services\n(e.g., case managers and registered dietitians) by participants.\nIn this nationally representative data set, we found high\nrates of lifestyle counseling by health-care providers for hyper-\ntensive patients especially for those with the highest cardio-\nvascular risks. However, after multivariate adjustment, only\nnon-Hispanic blacks and those aged >60 were more likely to\nreport adhering when advised. Increasing both physician and\npatient adherence to lifestyle modification guidelines will be an\nessential first step and merits further investigation. In light of\nthese findings, population-wide adoption of healthy lifestyles is\ncritical to reduce the societal burden of CVD and its sequelae.\nFurthermore, policy makers and health advocates should focus\non developing programs targeting young adults with hyperten-\nsion given their low adherence rates, as they have a significantly\nincreasing rate of hypertension and related disorders.\n"
