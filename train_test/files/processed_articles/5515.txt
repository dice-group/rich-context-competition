Face perception and lightness\nillusion (e.g., lightness perception is affected by the lightness of adjacent areas) have been\ninvestigated separately by numerous studies (Adelson, 2000; Tanaka & Farah, 1993) and are\nalready established as different research fields with very little relationship. In addition, in\nrecent years, perceptual effects of cosmetics have begun to draw attention as a promising new\nCorresponding author:\nEmail: y-kobayashi@hus.osaka-u.ac.jp\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\nfield of perceptual study (Matsushita, Morikawa, Mitsuzane, & Yamanami, 2015; Morikawa,\nMatsushita, Tomita, & Yamanami, 2015). However, very few studies, if any, have tackled the\nintersection of these three fields.\nAlthough several studies have examined shape or size illusions in faces (Lee & Freire, 1999;\nMatsushita, Morikawa, & Yamanami, 2015; Morikawa et al., 2015), illusion of facial color or\nlightness remains largely unexplored. Makeup artists and advertisements for cosmetics often\nclaim that lip color can influence facial skin's apparent lightness (e.g., http://verilymag.com/\n2015/02/best-lipstick-skin-tone). Currently, we do not have scientific evidence to either\nsupport or deny these claims.\nPrevious studies have revealed that face color or lightness is a major determinant of\nperceived healthiness and attractiveness (Frost, 1990; Pazda, Thorstenson, Elliot, &\nPerrett, 2016; Stephen, Coetzee, & Perrett, 2011). Moreover, contrast between light facial\nskin and dark facial parts (eyes and lips) is positively correlated with perceived health,\none way for cosmetics to make the face appear more feminine and, hence, attractive is by\nexaggerating facial contrast (Jones et al., 2015; Russell, 2010). Although cosmetics' effect on\nattractiveness may not be large (Jones & Kramer, 2015, 2016), color and lightness of lips can\nbe easily and dramatically altered using lipsticks. Lipsticks may not only increase the contrast\nbetween lips and facial skin but may also influence perceived lightness of skin. Therefore, it\nwould be both scientifically interesting and beneficial for practical purposes to test the effect\nof lip color on facial skin's perceived lightness.\nOn one hand, there is a reason for thinking that lip color would not affect facial skin's\nperceived lightness: The lip area is far smaller than the facial skin area. Generally, in nonface\nobjects and surfaces, color or lightness of a larger and surrounding area influences perceived\ncolor or lightness of a smaller and surrounded area but not vice versa (Yund & Armington,\n1974). Although the smaller area might affect the larger surrounding one, it would be too\nweak to observe. Lips are much smaller than the facial skin that surrounds them. Considering\nthese facts, we might predict that lip color or lightness is unlikely to affect that of the larger\nand surrounding area, that is, facial skin.\nOn the other hand, many researchers have argued that processing faces differs from\nprocessing nonface objects because the former relies more heavily on holistic processing\nthan does the latter (Cornes, Donnelly, Godwin, & Wenger, 2011; Rossion, 2013; Tanaka\n& Farah, 1993). Therefore, the lightness-induction pattern in faces can possibly differ\nfrom that in nonface objects. Morikawa (2017) noted that geometric illusions in human\nfaces and bodies tend to occur in the direction of assimilation rather than contrast.\nMorikawa argued that this pattern of geometric illusions is distinct from classical\nnonface illusions, calling it ``biological illusion.'' If this peculiar tendency occurs in\nlightness perception of faces, lip color might affect perceived facial skin tone.\nInvestigating lightness illusion in human faces and comparing it with the illusion in\nnonface objects could contribute to studies of both lightness perception and face\nperception. Therefore, the present study attempted to examine whether lip color and\nlightness could affect perceived lightness of facial skin.\nExperiment 1\nMethod\nThis study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Human\nSciences, Osaka University. Twenty-one nai\u00a8ve volunteers (10 females) participated in\n2 i-Perception\nnormal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal trichromatic color vision and gave\nwritten informed consent. The sample size of this study is much larger compared with that of\ntypical lightness perception studies (e.g., Madigan & Brainard, 2014; Sawayama & Kimura,\n2012). Stimuli were presented on an LCD screen (NEC MultiSync LCD-PA241W, screen size\nnormally illuminated.\nAll facial stimuli were generated from an average face of 40 Japanese women in their 20s.\nThey were asked to keep a neutral expression while being photographed under the same\ndiffused illumination. Software Morph 2.5 J was used to average those faces. Dimensions of\nincluding the white background (113.8 cd/m2) of the faces. The present study is one of the\nvery first attempts at measuring color or lightness illusion caused by lip color; therefore, we\nadopted an average face as a starting point.\nFour standard stimuli were employed (Figure 1(a)). One was the original face, and the\nothers were faces with lighter lips, darker lips, and redder lips. Because our main interest was\nlightness illusion, the standard stimuli included darker and lighter lips. A previous study\nreported that reddish facial skin is perceived lighter (Yoshikawa, Kikuchi, Yaguchi,\nMizokami, & Takata, 2012). If lip color is assimilated with facial skin color, then redder\nlips might make facial skin appear lighter. Therefore, we also included redder lips in the\nstandard stimuli. Adobe Photoshop CS3 was used to create these altered lips. Using the Hue\nor Saturation function, we decreased the lightness value by 8 for darkening and we increased\nit by 12 for lightening. Using the Color Balance function, we increased the red value by 100\nfor reddening. Dimensions of the face itself were approximately 544 pixels (147 mm) wide at\neye level and approximately 937 pixels (253 mm) high from the top of the head to the tip of\nthe chin. The average luminance and CIE chromaticity coordinates of a small circular area\nOriginal Lighter lips Darker lips\nRedder lips\nThe darkest The lightest\nOriginal\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 1. (a) Four standard stimuli. They were identical faces except for lip colors. (b) The area where\nluminances and chromaticity coordinates were measured is indicated by a circle on the lower lip. (c) Examples\nof comparative stimuli. Nine levels were prepared. (d) The area where luminances were measured in each\ncomparative stimulus is indicated by a circle on the cheek.\nKobayashi et al. 3\ncovering the lower lip (Figure 1(b)) were as follows, respectively: original: 53.5 cd/m2,\ndarker lips' luminance was lowered by more than the lighter lips' luminance was raised\nbecause lipsticks which darken the lips are much more common than the ones which\nlighten them for everyday makeup (Russell, 2009).\nComparative stimuli consisted only of the middle slice of the average face for three\nreasons (Figure 1(c)). First, the part of the human face that represents ``complexion'' the\nbest is cheeks and not the forehead or chin. Second, it is well known that lightness\ncontrast or assimilation illusions are sensitive to the spatial separation between the\ninducing area and the test area. If lip color has any illusory effect at all, it would\nmost likely manifest itself in skin areas near the lips and not in the forehead. Third,\nwe wanted participants to compare luminance in the same part of the face. If the\ncomparative stimuli had consisted of an entire face, some participants may have\ncompared the forehead while other participants may have compared the nose, cheeks,\n75.7, and 77.5 cd/m2. The luminance of each stimulus indicates the average of a circular\narea covering the cheek (Figure 1(d)).\nThe method of constant stimuli was employed. In a trial, one standard stimulus and one\ncomparative stimulus were presented side by side on a gray background (56.4 cd/m2). The\ndistance between the two stimuli was 144 pixels (39 mm), and they were aligned so that the\npartial face was exactly level with the corresponding part in the full face. Participants were\nasked to report which facial skin appeared lighter by pressing a key. The stimuli presentation\nlasted at most for 1,500 ms, but it was interrupted by participants' key presses. Between trials,\nthere were 500 ms intervals during which only the gray background was displayed.\nExperiment 1 was composed of 288 trials (four standard stimuli, nine comparative stimuli,\ntwo presentation positions, and four repeats), and trial order was randomized. Participants\nbegan the experiment after a practice of 40 trials (four standard stimuli, five comparative\nstimuli, and two presentation positions).\nResults\nWe obtained psychometric functions from luminance of each comparative stimulus and its\nselection probability for each participant. Then, a cumulative normal distribution function\nwas fitted to individual data by the least squares method. The luminance value (the horizontal\naxis) of the function when the probability value (the vertical axis) reached 50% (i.e., the\nmean) was defined as the point of subjective equality (PSE), where perceived lightness of the\nstandard stimulus was equal to that of the comparative stimulus. To properly fit the function\nto individual data, it was expected that the selection probability for the darkest and lightest\ncomparative stimuli should be 0% and 100%, respectively (these two extreme comparative\nstimuli were created as obviously darker or lighter than the standard stimulus). For these two\nstimuli, we set a criterion of 75% correct responses, which is a common definition of\nthreshold employed in two-alternative forced-choice psychophysical experiments. One male\nparticipant fell short of the criterion. Therefore, he was excluded, and the remaining 20 were\nfurther analyzed. Figure 2 shows the mean of PSE for each standard stimulus. A one-way\nrepeated measures analysis of variance indicated that the main effect of lip color was\n2 \u00bc .44. Post hoc t tests using Holm's method\n(Holm, 1979) was performed on the data. Holm's method, which employs sequentially\n4 i-Perception\nrejective tests, is known for its versatility as well as Bonferroni's method; however, its Type II\nerror rate is lower than Bonferroni's method. The following p values were sequentially\ncorrected with Holm's method. T tests showed that the facial skin with redder lips\nfacial skin with darker lips appeared darker than that of the original face, t(19) \u00bc 4.03,\np \u00bc .004, d \u00bc 0.58. However, there was no significant difference between the skin with\nneither main effect of sex nor interaction between sex and lip color was significant (p \u00bc .066\nThese results revealed that redder lips lightened perceived lightness of facial skin and that\ndarker lips darkened it. In other words, lip color can influence facial skin's appearance. Here,\nwe could not observe lighter lips' effect but that might be because the luminance increment\nfor the lighter lips was relatively small. Results of Experiment 1 showed that lip color can\ncause lightness assimilation in human faces. The effect of redder lips will be discussed in the\nDiscussion section.\nNormally, as mentioned earlier, lightness induction from a small and surrounded area to a\nlarge and surrounding area is unlikely to arise. Possibly, this unusual pattern of lightness\ninduction is caused by holistic processing, which is known as a peculiarity of human face\nprocessing that can be disrupted by inversion (i.e., turning upside down; e.g., Tanaka &\nexperiment to examine whether this effect can be explained by holistic processing. If the\nlightness-inducing effects observed in Experiment 1 were caused by holistic processing,\nthey should be much weaker in Experiment 2.\nExperiment 2\nMethod\nTwenty-two volunteers (12 females) participated in Experiment 2; their ages ranged from 19\nto 44 years (M \u00bc 24.6, SD \u00bc 4.79). They had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and\nnormal trichromatic color vision and gave written informed consent. None of them\nparticipated in Experiment 1.\nThe apparatus and procedure were the same as in Experiment 1 except that all the stimuli\nwere inverted.\nFigure 2. Illusion magnitude of perceived luminance for each standard stimulus in Experiment 1. Error bars\nindicate standard errors.\nKobayashi et al. 5\nResults\nTwo female participants were excluded from analysis by the aforementioned criterion, and\nthe remaining 20 were analyzed. PSEs were calculated using the same method as in\nExperiment 1. Figure 3 shows consistently high PSEs, which may be because the inverted\ncomparative stimuli were more vulnerable to disruption of holistic processing. If the inverted\npartial face is not perceived as a face, facial lightness constancy fails, which makes the partial\nface subject to simultaneous contrast effect and perceptually darkened by the surrounding\nwhite area (Yund & Armington, 1974). A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance\nZp\n2 \u00bc .11. Post hoc t tests using Holm's method (Holm, 1979) showed no significant\ndifferences between the original face and the other three conditions (original vs. redder\nmain effect of sex nor interaction between sex and lip color was significant (p \u00bc .755 and\nUnlike Experiment 1, the lightness-inducing effects could not be observed in Experiment 2.\nThis shows that the lightness-inducing effects of lips on facial skin stem largely from holistic\nprocessing.\nDiscussion\nExperiment 1 revealed that redder lips made perceived lightness of facial skin lighter and that\ndarker lips made it darker. Previous studies with nonface stimuli (Yund & Armington, 1974)\nshowed that a smaller and surrounded area is unlikely to cause lightness induction in a larger\nsurrounding area. Therefore, these lightness-inducing effects observed in Experiment 1 may\nbe unique to faces. Results of Experiment 2 supported this hypothesis, showing that such\neffects cannot be observed in inverted face stimuli. It is likely that holistic processing of faces\ncauses assimilative lightness induction. Below, we discuss implications of the present findings\nin three fields of perceptual research: face perception, lightness illusions, and effects of facial\nmakeup.\nMorikawa's (2017) ``biological illusion,'' mentioned earlier, could explain this unique\npattern of lightness induction. According to his argument, illusions in human faces and\nFigure 3. Illusion magnitude of perceived luminance for each standard stimulus in Experiment 2. Error bars\nindicate standard errors.\n6 i-Perception\nbodies share tendencies uncommon in nonface objects. One tendency is assimilative:\nGeometric illusions in body parts tend to induce illusions of assimilation instead of\ncontrast. And Morikawa also observed that in the human face and body, the visual\nproperty of a smaller region can spread to larger adjacent areas, a phenomenon that he\ncalled ``visual echo illusion.'' These tendencies of biological illusion have been confirmed\nby some other studies (Matsushita et al., 2015; Morikawa, 2017). Indeed, the present\nstudy's results seem to accord with the theory of biological illusion.\nAlthough at first glance the phenomenon that redder lips lightened perceived lightness of\nskin does not appear to accord with tendencies of biological illusion, the phenomenon can be\nreconciled with biological illusion if we consider the finding that reddish faces appear lighter\n(Yoshikawa et al., 2012). More specifically, facial skin's reddish appearance caused by redder\nlips' assimilative illusion would lead to lighter appearance of complexion. Therefore, effects\nof both darker lips and redder lips can be considered illusions of color or lightness\nassimilation in accord with characteristics of biological illusion.\nKiritani, Okazaki, Motoyoshi, Takano, and Okubo (in press) also reported that lip color\nwas assimilated into facial skin's perceived color. For example, they found that orange lip\ncolor makes facial skin appear yellowish, and reddish lip color makes facial skin appear\nreddish and lighter. Their findings are in general agreement with ours. However, Kiritani\net al.'s (in press) experiment employed paired comparisons instead of psychophysical\nmethods, so the absolute size of illusion was unclear. In addition, in their experiment, both\nstandard stimuli and comparative stimuli were whole faces including lips, and participants\nwere asked to evaluate colors of ``whole faces.'' Possibly, therefore, participants judged the\naverage color of the whole face including lips. That is, their results might have derived not\nonly from judgment of facial skin color but also from that of lip color itself. The present\nstudy overcame those problems by using a psychophysical method and partial faces excluding\nlips as comparative stimuli.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first psychophysical evidence that\nsupports the claim of cosmetics manufacturers and makeup artists that lipsticks can influence\nperceived lightness of facial skin. Lip color has been known as a major determinant of facial\nattractiveness and sex typicality (Stephen & McKeegan, 2010). Lipsticks can directly increase\ncontrast between lips and facial skin, which leads to increased perceived health, femininity,\nexistence of an indirect lip-color effect on the impression of faces mediated by the illusion of\nfacial skin's perceived lightness. Facial skin lightness is related to sexual dimorphism and\napparent healthiness (e.g., Frost, 1990; Stephen et al., 2011). Moreover, the illusory effect of\nred lip-color on facial skin can enhance facial contrast, which increases perceived femininity,\nhealth, and youthfulness (Porcheron, Mauger, & Russell, 2013; Russell et al., 2016).\nTherefore, cosmetics have both direct and indirect illusory effects to enhance facial beauty,\nfemininity, and attractiveness.\nStill, some unresolved issues remain to be investigated by future studies. First, a serious\nweakness of the present study is the fact that it used only one average face. Therefore, the\ngeneralizability of our conclusions is limited. Follow-up studies that employ a wide variety of\nindividual faces are needed to examine whether the lightness assimilation also occurs with\nother faces. Second, effects of lightness and saturation of lips' redness would have to be\ndisentangled. Third, we do not yet understand how the lightness assimilation spreads from\nthe lips. For example, it may be possible that darkening the lips makes the immediate area\naround the lips appear lighter, but areas further away (the cheeks) appear darker. Finally, the\neffect of lighter lips was not observed, but it might be because of the small increment in the\nlips' luminance. Much lighter lips might have increased the perceived lightness of skin\nKobayashi et al. 7\nsignificantly. Further research is necessary to investigate the exact nature of the facial\nlightness illusion.\nThe present study demonstrated that unusual illusions of lightness or color assimilation\ncan arise in face perception because of holistic processing of faces. In addition, it was\nsuggested that psychophysical methods can be very useful for measuring perceptual effects\nof cosmetic facial makeup. Finally, it was proposed that faces should be studied as unique\nobjects worthy of academic attention from the perspective of lightness perception. The\npresent study could make new contributions to three fields of perceptual research: face\nperception, lightness illusion, and visual effects of cosmetics.\n"
