The reviews concluded, indepen-\ndently, that despite the methodological limitations of\nthe surveys included, CAM was used by substantial\nproportions of the general populations of a number\nof countries.

In affluent countries, where biomedical services\nare more accessible, a substantial amount of CAM is\nused for illness prevention and health promotion\npurposes (3). There is also evidence that CAM is fre-\nquently used as an adjunct to biomedical treatment by\npatients with serious disease such as cancers (5,6) and\nto self-manage long-term health complaints like low\nback pain (7). However, the socio-cultural factors\ninfluencing CAM use in affluent societies are still not\nwell understood.

A six-\nitem literature-based tool was devised to assess robustness and interpretability of\nCAM-use estimates. Results: Fifty-one reports from 49 surveys conducted in 15\ncountries met the inclusion criteria. We extracted 32 estimates of 12-month preva-\nlence of visits to CAM practitioners (range 1.8\u00ad48.7%). Quality of methodological\nreporting was variable; 30 / 51 survey reports (59%) met four or more of six quality\ncriteria. Estimates of 12-month prevalence of any CAM use (excluding prayer) from\nsurveys using consistent measurement methods showed remarkable stability in\n2007). Conclusions: There was evidence of substantial CAM use in the 15 coun-\ntries surveyed. Where national trends were discernable because of consistent mea-\nsurement, there was no evidence to suggest a change in 12-month prevalence of\nCAM use since the previous systematic reviews were published in 2000. Periodic\nsurveys are important to monitor population-level CAM use. Use of government-\nsponsored health surveys may enhance robustness of population-based prevalence\nestimates. Comparisons across countries could be improved by standardising\napproaches to data collection.\nReview criteria\n\u00b7 Nine databases were searched from 1998\nonwards; prior studies were identified from two\nprevious systematic reviews.\n\u00b7 Studies were included if they reported prevalence\nof CAM use over 12-months in a representative\nsample of the general population. Studies were\nexcluded if restricted to a single CAM therapy, or\nnot written in English.\n\u00b7 A six-item tool to assess quality of published\nCAM-use prevalence surveys was devised and\napplied.\nMessage for the clinic\n\u00b7 The review included 51 reports from 49 surveys\nprevalence of any CAM use ranged from 9.8% to\npractitioners.\n\u00b7 There was no evidence of a change in CAM use\nsince previous reviews were published in 2000.\n\u00b7 Periodic surveys with consistent measurement\nmethods are needed to determine trends in CAM\nuse by national populations.\n1Cardiff School of Health\nSciences, Cardiff Metropolitan\nUniversity, Cardiff, UK\n2School of Health and Related\nResearch, University of\nSheffield, Sheffield, UK\nCorrespondence to:\nPhilip Harris,\nCardiff School of Health\nSciences,\nCardiff Metropolitan University,\nWestern Avenue, Cardiff CF5\nEmail: peharris@cardiffmet.ac.uk\nDisclosures\nNone.\ndriven more by congruence with values and beliefs\nthan by dissatisfaction with biomedicine (10) but\nmotivation to use CAM is further complicated by costs\nand benefits as experienced by consumers.\nAlthough the true rate of CAM use can be\nexpected to differ between countries because of eco-\nnomic, social and cultural factors, the prevalence\nrates estimated by surveys are also affected by meth-\nodological factors. Some of these have been identified\n(2) with the recommendation that surveys justify the\ntypes of CAM surveyed; use pretested data collection\nmethods; distinguish between consultations with\nCAM practitioners and over-the-counter products;\nseek reports of usage for each of the practitioner\ntherapies and products identified; and specify the\nperiod over which CAM use is estimated (most sur-\nveys choose a 12 month retrospective period). Others\nhave also recommended a more standardised method\nof collecting data to improve the comparability of\nCAM use estimates (13).\nThe two previous reviews of CAM prevalence (1,2)\neach included 12 surveys for review with seven1\ncommon to both studies because of differences in\nsearch methods and selection criteria. The current\nstudy has drawn on these two earlier reviews to\ndevelop more rigorous criteria for searching and\nselection and aims to (i) systematically review all sur-\nveys of CAM use by the general public, (ii) identify\ntrends in CAM use by national populations, (iii)\ndevelop a brief tool for assessing methodological\nquality and apply it to each survey.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nThe systematic review followed the recommenda-\ntions in the PRISMA statement (16). The following\ndatabases were searched in February 2011: MED-\nLINE, Medline in Process, EMBASE, Cochrane\nDatabase of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CEN-\nTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, HTA database,\nScience Citation Index, AMED and PsycINFO. The\nsearch strategy combined terms for: (i) complemen-\ntary and alternative medicines, (ii) prevalence, sur-\nveys or patterns of use, and iii) population-level or\nnational-level data. The full search strategy is pro-\nvided in Appendix 1. The search was restricted to\nstudies published from 1998 onwards. Studies pub-\nlished prior to 1998 were identified from two previ-\nous systematic reviews of CAM prevalence (1,2).\nBibliographies of included papers were checked for\nfurther relevant studies.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nStudies were included if they reported prevalence of\nCAM use over a 12-month retrospective period\nwithin a representative general population sample of\na nation or a defined geographical area. Surveys of\nclearly-defined age groups (such as adults or chil-\ndren) were also included. Included studies used sur-\nvey methods such as structured interviews or self-\ncomplete questionnaires. Studies were excluded if\nthey were restricted to a single therapy (rather than\nCAM use overall), did not report 12-month preva-\nlence, or were not written in English. Studies were\nalso excluded if they were not based on representa-\ntive samples of the general population; for example,\nsurveys of sub-populations with specific clinical con-\nditions or socio-demographic characteristics (other\nthan age).\nStudy selection and data extraction\nStudy titles retrieved by the search were assessed for\ninclusion by one reviewer and a sample of excluded\ntitles was checked by a second reviewer: no instances\nof discrepancy were found. Potentially relevant\nabstracts and full texts were assessed by two review-\ners and any discrepancies resolved through discus-\nsion. Data were extracted by one reviewer and\nchecked by a second.\nQuality assessment\nThere is no agreed set of criteria for assessing quality\nof health-related surveys, although various publica-\ntions have explored issues relating to the critical\nreview of questionnaire-based surveys in health\nresearch (17\u00ad22), and previous studies of CAM-use\nprevalence have commented on these issues\nFor the purposes of this review, we derived a\nshort, literature-based quality assessment tool com-\nprising important and assessable criteria of methodo-\nlogical quality, and applied this to each of the\neligible papers identified. Our rationale for selecting\nquality criteria related to the need to assess the\nrobustness and interpretability of published CAM-\nuse estimates. Our quality criteria reflect a combina-\ntion of aspects of study design, study conduct and\nthe reporting of results (Box 1).\nRationale for quality criteria\nStudy design\nAs with all surveys of prevalence, the estimates pro-\nduced are the direct product of the questions asked;\nslight changes in the form of questions will have the\npotential to affect the resulting estimates. This is par-\nticularly important in surveys of CAM where multi-\nsame survey source.\nCAM use by general population 925\nple, and sometimes culturally specific understandings\nexist in relation to the practice and to the constitu-\nent therapies (2,23). CAM prevalence surveys have\nemployed one of two data collection methods; either\na list of named therapies is presented, or more\nexploratory, open question(s) are used to elicit CAM\nuse. Our first criterion required papers to reproduce\nthe CAM survey question(s) verbatim or describe the\nCAM question in the text (e.g. `we asked about...').\nFor closed questions, we required a list of the pre-\nspecified therapies (and exclusions) presented to sur-\nvey respondents (described clearly enough for the\nindividual therapies to be counted reliably). Where\nopen question(s) were used to collect CAM-use data,\nwe sought evidence of the content and number of\nopen questions employed.\nAs the measurement process for CAM-use is com-\nplex and variable, the validity of the survey instru-\nment is strengthened if it has been tested in a pilot\nstudy for ease of completion and comprehensibility\n(2,14,18). Evidence of such piloting formed our sec-\nond criterion. Explicit mention of a pilot was sought\nfor all studies, but routine, government-sponsored\nsurveys were assumed to have undergone a piloting\nphase as this is standard practice and frequently\ndescribed in separate, methodological papers or\nreports.\nAdequate sample size enhances the robustness of\nthe estimates produced and, if something is known\nabout expected prevalence prior to the survey, a\nsample size calculation can be performed to ensure\nadequate numbers for each item of importance to\nare part of wider-scope studies of health behaviour\ntend to have large samples, but may not perform\nsample size calculations in relation to items measur-\ning CAM use. Our third criterion was met if studies\nreported a sample of at least 1000, and / or if they\nreported a sample size calculation specific to CAM\nuse.\nData collection\nPrevious papers have cited `good' response rates for\nsurveys as between 70\u00ad80%, and `acceptable'\nresponse rates for postal surveys between 50% and\nto have been met if studies reported a response rate\nof at least 60% (we accepted adjusted or unadjusted\nresponse rates and report these in Table 1).\nAnalysis\nOur fifth quality criterion was deemed to have been\nmet if appropriate correction for non-response bias\nwas used; for example, weighting the responses to\nthe known characteristics of the original sample pop-\nReporting of estimates\nFinally, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provide an\nestimate of the range in which the true prevalence\nprovide more information whilst reducing the likeli-\nhood of `false' precision being attributed to the esti-\nmates. Our sixth and final quality criterion was\ntherefore met when studies reported 95% CIs, or\nstandard errors (SEs) from which the CI can be cal-\nculated, for the main CAM-use prevalence estimates.\nResults\nNumber of surveys included\nThe search identified 2312 unique citations, as shown\nin Figure 1.

Most surveys also allowed\nrespondents to report the use of `other' types of CAM,\nbut CAM prevalence estimates were inflated by the\ninclusion of prayer as a type of CAM (32). Use of\nprayer was most frequently reported in studies from\nthe USA and East Asia. Other factors contributing to\nhigh estimates of CAM use were the inclusion of reli-\ngious practices other than prayer (51); named thera-\npies not commonly regarded as CAM such as `dietary\nsupplements' (48); and the use of indigenous, tradi-\ntional medicine (52). This reinforces the call for a\nmore standardised approach to collecting comparable\npopulation data (13).\nThere was evidence of national trends in Australia,\nUK and USA. In Australia during 2004, about one in\ntwo adults and one in five children had used some type\nof CAM and about one in four adults had visited\nCAM practitioners (29,30) with no significant change\ngested that CAM use has remained fairly constant\nCAM and one in eight consulting a CAM practitioner\nindicating that nearly four in ten adults and one in\nnine children had used some type of CAM (31). How-\never, in general, information on trends is limited by\ninsufficient data from repeat surveys with consistent,\nhigh quality methods.\nThere is currently no consensus regarding `what is\nquality' in the context of prevalence surveys.

We aimed to produce\nquality criteria that relate to the likely robustness and\ninterpretability of the estimates produced. The devel-\nopment of the assessment tool was based on researcher\nexperience and authoritative sources. Our experience\nof applying the six identified criteria suggested they\nhad face validity, but further work is needed to estab-\nlish their reliability and validity. Reliable and valid cri-\nteria can be used to select high quality surveys for\nfuture systematic reviews and to help guide the devel-\nopment and reporting of prevalence surveys.\nApplication of the six-item quality assessment tool\ndeveloped for this review suggested that the quality\nwas variable; 30 survey reports (59%) achieved four\nor more of the six quality criteria. There was no evi-\ndence of an association between date of publication\nand quality, but we did observe a trend towards\nhigher quality in the government-sponsored surveys,\naccording to our criteria.\nThe rationales cited for conducting CAM surveys in\nthe reports reviewed were predominantly concerned\nwith perceptions of the popularity of CAM, and its\nincreasing use, and the implications of this for public\nhealth and health service planning. Recent surveys\nhave revealed that delayed medical care was associated\nwith CAM use in the USA (53); that most respondents\nin Australia were unaware that CAM use was not rou-\ntinely tested for safety and efficacy by a government\nagency (29); and that more than one in four UK\nrespondents taking prescribed drugs stated they were\nalso using CAM (42). All of the recent reports in Aus-\nto improve communication between physicians and\npatients about their use of CAM; openness and non-\njudgemental communication is needed to determine\nthe risks of drug interactions and other potential com-\nplications (29). Periodic surveys of general popula-\ntions are required to monitor changing patterns in\nCAM use as well as public perceptions and awareness,\nand the quality of communication between healthcare\nproviders and their users.\nFinally, most studies reviewed also reported esti-\nmates for visits to specific CAM practitioners. This\nwill be the subject of a separate publication and\ncomplete the picture of the world-wide use of CAM\nbased on the best available evidence.\n"
