Elderly patients thus have a\nright to expect their nutritional needs to be fulfilled during\nhospitalization. Several studies have shown that a large pro-\nportion of elderly patients are already undernourished, or at\nrisk of becoming so, on hospital admission (Imoberdorf et al.,\ntus often deteriorates during their hospital stay (Rasmussen,\nHolst, & Kondrup, 2010). Considering the increase in the\naging population in Norway, as in the rest of Europe, it may\nnot be unreasonable to assume that the proportion of under-\nnourished elderly patients will rise. It is therefore vital that\nhospitals have a nutritional care policy ensuring proper iden-\ntification and treatment of patients suffering from undernutri-\ntion and the risk of undernutrition. In recent decades, there\nhas been a growing awareness of undernourishment in the\nhealth care sector in Europe (Council of Europe, 2003;\nLjungqvist, van Gossum, Sanz, & de Man, 2010). In line\nwith European guidelines (Howard et al., 2006; Kondrup,\nAllison, Elia, Vellas, & Plauth, 2003; National Collaborating\nCentre for Acute Care, 2006), national professional guide-\nlines on prevention and treatment of undernutrition were\npublished for the first time in Norway in 2009 (The Norwegian\nDirectorate of Health, 2009). Nevertheless, there is a limited\nbody of research available today exploring how undernour-\nishment is addressed for elderly patients in the hospital set-\nting in Norway. A cross-sectional study designed to estimate\nthe prevalence of nutritional risk among elderly patients was\nconducted at a large university hospital in the period 2011 to\n2013 (H. K. Eide, Saltyt Benth, Sortland, Halvorsen, &\nAlmendingen, 2015). To assess nutritional care, data on iden-\ntifying and treating nutritional risk were also recorded, which\nwas the aim of the present article.\nBackground\nAt present, there is no clear consensus on a method for iden-\ntifying undernutrition (Cederholm et al., 2015; Rasmussen\net al., 2010). Moreover, the terms \"undernutrition\" and \"mal-\nnutrition\" are often used interchangeably (Cederholm et al.,\n1University of Oslo, Norway\n2Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Norway\n3Akershus University Hospital, L\u00f8renskog, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nHelene Kj\u00f8llesdal Eide, Division of Medicine, Akershus University Hospital\nand Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, PO BOX 1000,\nEmail: h.d.eide@gmail.com\nAre Nutritional Care Adequate for\nElderly Hospitalized Patients? A\nCross-Sectional Study\nHelene Kj\u00f8llesdal Eide1,2, Jrat Saltyt Benth3,\nKjersti Sortland2, Kristin Halvorsen2, and Kari Almendingen2\n Keywords\nnutritional care, nutritional risk, elderly patients, hospital care, cross-sectional study\n2 SAGE Open\n2015). The following definition of malnutrition is, however,\nwidely used (Stratton, Green, & Elia, 2003): \"A state of\nnutrition in which a deficiency, excess or imbalance of\nenergy, protein, and other nutrients causes measurable\nadverse effects on tissue/body form (body shape, size and\ncomposition), function, and clinical outcome,\" whereby\nundernutrition constitutes part of the deficiency. For elderly\nin the hospital setting, a variety of physiological, psychologi-\ncal, and social changes associated with the process of ageing\ninteract with disease processes, making this group of patients\nparticularly vulnerable to developing undernutrition (Morley,\net al., 2003). Focus on optimal care for prevention and treat-\nment of undernutrition is therefore important for elderly hos-\npitalized patients.\nTraditionally, nurses have been responsible for patients'\nnutrition as part of caring for the patients' basic needs\n(Henderson, 1997). Now, however, nutrition is generally\nseen as an interdisciplinary field in which several hospital\nprofessions (Jefferies, Johnson, & Ravens, 2011), including\nphysicians, nurses, clinical dietitians, and food service staff,\npartake. Nevertheless, by being with the patients in a 24/7\ncontext, the importance of nurses in identifying the need for\nnutritional treatment and implementing appropriate nutri-\ntional treatment measures should be underscored (Bonetti,\nrepresent the largest group of health care professionals work-\ning in hospitals, and influencing their approach to under-\nnourishment may yield clinical benefits for elderly\nhospitalized patients.\nThe Norwegian guidelines, largely in line with European\nguidelines (Howard et al., 2006; Kondrup, Allison, et al.,\nfocus on four key recommendations that are to be imple-\nmented into hospital routines (The Norwegian Directorate of\nHealth, 2009). First, for a routine identification of undernu-\ntrition and the risk of undernutrition, nutritional risk screen-\ning must be performed on all patients on hospital admission\nand subsequently weekly. Hence, the term \"nutritional risk\"\ncovers both the concepts \"the risk of undernutrition\" and\n\"undernutrition.\" As undernutrition is easier to prevent than\nto treat, it is preferable to identify this condition as early as\npossible. This is especially true for older people whose nutri-\ntional status recovers more slowly (Roberts et al., 1994;\nVellas, Albarede, & Garry, 1992). Second, when patients\nscreen positive for nutritional risk, a treatment plan must be\ndeveloped to establish severity and to consider appropriate\nnutritional treatment measures. In many cases, this is based\non a more detailed nutritional assessment. Third, information\non nutritional status and treatment must always be docu-\nmented in medical records. Fourth, this information must be\ncommunicated to the next level of care in discharge letters.\nDespite the fact that undernourishment can result in seri-\nous health consequences, such as prolonged hospital stays,\ndelayed recovery, and increased complications (Norman\net al., 2008), European studies demonstrate that this condi-\ntion is often ignored for elderly patients in the hospital set-\nSaeglitz, Gueldenzoph, Sieber, & Stehle, 2010). Norway\nseems to be no exception (H. D. Eide, Halvorsen, &\nAlmendingen,2015;NorwegianBoardofHealthSupervision,\nduration of an average hospital stay is decreasing in Norway\n(Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care services, 2009), as\nin the rest of Europe. However, shorter hospital stays do not\ndiminish the significance of providing adequate nutritional\ncare. On the contrary, as studies have shown that undernour-\nished patients have longer hospital stays (Feldblum et al.,\nidentifying patients nutritionally at risk and initiating appro-\npriate treatment.\nMethod\nDesign\nThe cross-sectional study was conducted at a university hos-\npital in Norway. The university hospital provides health care\nservices for approximately half a million people living in\nurban and rural municipalities. The patient population is het-\nerogenic with respect to ethnicity and socioeconomic factors,\nand covers about 10% of the Norwegian population. By\noperating as both a local and regional hospital, the university\nhospital offers locally based specialist services as well as\nmore specialized services.\nThe study was developed with multidisciplinary collabo-\nration between the researchers, the collegium at a nursing\nbachelor education program, representatives from the uni-\nversity hospital, and other experts in the field. Second-year\nnursing students undergoing their acute and clinical care\npractice studies at the university hospital collected data on\nnutritional risk and nutritional care for elderly patients. The\nstudents were instructed to participate as part of their obliga-\ntory clinical training and education. In this way, the students\ngained firsthand experience and increased awareness of\nnutritional risk and of how recommended nutritional care is\ncarried out among elderly hospitalized patients.\nParticipants\nNine nutritional screening days were executed in the aca-\nnursing students were in touch with the patients. The ward\nnursing staff provided the nursing students with lists of all\nelderly (70 years or older) patients admitted on the included\nwards at 08.00 on the screening days, and these patients were\nasked to participate. Terminal patients, that is, patients\nassumed to be short-lived (less than 1 month) and patients\ndiagnosed with dementia, were excluded. Also excluded\nwere patients experiencing language difficulties, patients\nEide et al. 3\nwho were not present at the time of the screening due to\noperations or examinations, and patients who were found\nunfit to participate, for example, due to unconsciousness or\nhaving contagious illnesses. The ward nursing staff in coop-\neration with the nursing students selected all eligible patients.\nThe study sample included patients admitted to 14 out of\n16 medical and surgical wards at the university hospital, in\naddition to four associated wards. Due to differences in the\npatients' diagnoses, two wards were divided into two sub-\nwards. A stratified sampling technique was utilized in the\ndata collection (Cochran, 1963). It tends to produce samples\nthat are most representative of the population in terms of\nreduced sampling error. Correspondingly, sample size calcu-\nlations adjusting for possible cluster effect due to stratifica-\ntion were performed. The minimum sample size of 522 was\nrequired to achieve a 95% degree of confidence with a length\n10% at most for a prevalence of 30% nutritionally at risk,\nwhile assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of\n0.3 (Eide et al., 2015). In accordance with the stratified sam-\npling technique, the number of elderly patients proportional\nto the ward size was consecutively included in the sample on\neach ward. The size of ward was defined as the daily average\nnumber of elderly patients based on the records from the last\n6 months provided by the hospital's analysis department.\nSampling stopped on each ward when the intended number\nof patients was reached. A statistician was responsible for the\nstatistical sampling design.\nData Collection\nOn the screening days, the students screened the patients for\nnutritional risk and filled in a questionnaire for every patient\nfollowing instructions in a specially prepared manual. The\nquestionnaire included information about age, gender, num-\nber of days in hospital, weight, height, body mass index\n(BMI), nutritional risk, and nutritional care.\nNutritional measurements. To identify nutritional risk, the stu-\ndents used the 2009 translated Norwegian version (The Nor-\nwegian Directorate of Health, 2009) of the Nutritional Risk\nHamberg, & Stanga, 2003). The form is recommended by the\nEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism\n(ESPEN) as well as the Norwegian Directorate of Health for\nuse in the hospital setting, and is a widely used screening tool\nin Europe (Schindler et al., 2010) as well as in Norway\nwho will benefit from nutritional treatment due to undernutri-\ntion and/or increased nutritional needs resulting from disease\nform, the patients were screened based on evaluations of BMI,\nrecent weight loss, dietary intake, and disease severity. The\nscreening form included an initial screening and a final screen-\ning. The final screening was conducted if the answer was\n\"yes\" to any one of the questions in the initial screening.\nPatients with a total score of 3 or more in the final screening\nwere classified as nutritionally at risk. A score of 1 was added\nfor patients older than 70. Weight was measured without shoes\nand outer clothes in either a standing or sitting position to the\nnearest 0.1 kg with apparatus available on the wards at the\ntime of data collection, following usual hospital practice.\nHeight was measured to the nearest 1 cm with a nonelastic\nmeasuring tape, either in a standing position against a wall\nwithout shoes or alternatively with half arm span if the patients\nhad problems standing (Kwok & Whitelaw, 1991). The BMI\nwas calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height\n(m). The age-independent BMI classification system pre-\nsented by the World Health Organization (WHO; 2006) was\nused when categorizing patients' BMI.\nNutritional care. Questions regarding the nutritional care used\nin identifying and treating nutritional risk was developed in\ncollaboration with representatives from the university hospi-\ntal, for example, the chef, a clinical dietitian, and a research\nand development nurse to ensure correct and relevant formula-\ntions.All questions were based on the recommendations stipu-\nlated in the Norwegian guidelines and the hospital's food\nservice practices at the time, and are shown in Tables 3 and 4.\nThe questions concerned the use of nutritional risk screening\ntools and whether weight measurements were recorded on\nadmission and then on a weekly basis, the coding of undernu-\ntrition diagnoses (E43, E44, or E46) in line with the Interna-\ntional Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health\nProblems (ICD-10). Furthermore, the questions included ini-\ntiation and type of nutritional treatment measures. The nursing\nstudents retrieved this information from the patients' medical\nrecords. The availability of weighing apparatus at wards each\nscreening day was also noted in the questionnaires to deter-\nmine whether the wards had the proper equipment needed to\nroutinely measure weight for their patients.\nData Analysis\nPatient characteristics were described as means and standard\ndeviations (SDs) or frequencies and percentages, as appro-\npriate. Nutritional routines and treatment were presented in\nthe form of frequencies and percentages. Differences in\nnutritional routines and treatment between those nutrition-\nally at risk and those not at risk and between those with BMI\nFisher's exact test. The analyses were conducted on anony-\nmous data files. All tests were two-sided. The p values below\n5% were considered statistically significant. The statistical\nprogram IBM SPSS statistics Version 22.0 for Windows was\nused for statistical analysis.\nPilot Study\nTo test the questionnaire used, a pilot study was performed at\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Eide, Saltyt Benth, Sortland, Halvorsen, and Almendingen\npilot study involved totally 96 students screening 290 elderly\npatients, and showed that the bachelor nursing education pro-\ngram had an infrastructure that enabled the collection of data.\nEthical Statement\nThe study was completed in compliance with the guidelines of\nthe Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Internal Privacy\nCommission at the university hospital. The patients had to give\noral informed consent prior to participation. The researchers\nreceived anonymously completed questionnaires and screening\nforms from the students.As the data were anonymous, the study\nwas exempted from review by the Regional Committee for\nResults\nParticipation\nThe study population comprised 508 patients admitted to 20\nhospital wards (Table 1). Due to a lack of reporting by some\nstudents on patients who declined participation or were\nexcluded, only approximate information regarding participa-\ntion status was known. Of 1,059 patients for whom participa-\ntion status was known, 145 patients (14%) declined\nparticipation, while 390 (37%) were excluded according to\npredefined criteria. However, as the consecutive inclusion of\npatients was performed, a somewhat low participation rate\nshould therefore not affect the data quality.\nPatient Characteristics\nPatient characteristics are outlined in Table 2. The study pop-\nulation consisted of 48.8% women. The average age was\nnutritionally at risk, and mean BMI was 24.9 kg/m2 (SD =\n4.9). The patients had been admitted to the hospital on aver-\nage 5.3 days (SD = 6.3) at the time of data collection.\nAccording to WHO's cutoff values, 6.5% were identified as\nweight. Of the 199 patients nutritionally at risk with non-\nmissing values, 32 (16%) were identified as underweight,\nNutritional Routines\nStanding weights were available on all screening days at\n70% of the wards, while at 20% of the wards, standing\nweights were available only on at least one, but not all\nscreening days. At 10% of the wards, standings weights were\nnot available on any screening days. The availability of chair\nweights varied even more: at 40% of the wards, chair weight\nwere available on all screening days; at 55% of the wards,\nchair weights were available on some screening days; while\nTable 2.

Bed weight was available at only one ward\non one of the screening days. \"Not available\" implied that\nthe apparatus did not work, for example, the battery had run\ndown or there was no apparatus at the ward.\nNutritional routines performed at wards are outlined in\nTable 3. Only six (1.2%) of 478 patients with nonmissing val-\nues had been screened for nutritional risk with a screening tool\nby the hospital staff. Weight on admission was recorded for 46\npatients staying for longer than 7 days, weight within the last\nweek was recorded for 18 (14.0%) patients. Notably, weight\nwas recorded more frequently (p = .013) on admission for\npatients admitted to surgical wards (14.9%) compared with\npatients admitted to medical wards (6.9%), as well as more\ncompared with patients not operated (7.6%). No differences\n(p = .425) were observed in weight recordings on admission\nfor patients nutritionally at risk and those not at risk, whereas\nfrequently on admission (p = .028) compared with patients\nof 199 patients nutritionally at risk with nonmissing values\nNutritional Treatment\nreceived some form of nutritional treatment, 122 (68.5%) did\nnot receive any nutritional treatment, while nutritional treat-\nment was nonexistent for 23 patients (Table 4). More (p =\n.010) patients nutritionally at risk received some form of\nnutritional treatment compared with patients not at risk. Of the\npatients nutritionally at risk, those with BMI 18.49 kg/m2\n(53.6%) received some form of nutritional treatment more\n(Figure 1). Table 4 shows the types of nutritional treatment\nmeasures recorded on patients. Although not frequently\nrecorded in the patients' medical records, the most common\ntreatment measures were adaptations to the eating situation,\nadaptations of the normal diet and supplement drinks.\nAdjusted diets, energy- and nutrient-enriched meals, snacks\nbetween meals, and enteral and parenteral nutrition were sel-\ndom used. Only eight (14.3%) of 178 patients nutritionally at\nrisk with nonmissing values had been referred to a clinical\ndietitian.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first Norwegian cross-sectional study of such\nscale assessing nutritional care used for identifying and treat-\ning nutritional risk among the hospitalized elderly. The\nresults demonstrate that the nutritional care management for\nelderly patients without dementia at the participating hospi-\ntal wards was inadequate. Recommended nutritional care\nTable 3.

Weight recordings on admission and initiation of\nnutritional treatment, between patients with BMI 18.49 kg/m2\nNote. BMI = body mass index.\n6 SAGE Open\nwere not implemented in line with international and national\nguidelines, suggesting that the majority of the undernour-\nished elderly, or those at risk of becoming undernourished,\nare neither identified nor treated according to their needs.\nOur results are in agreement with the findings of a qualitative\nstudy in the same research project that was conducted in par-\nallel at the participating university hospital (Eide et al.,\n2015). This study, on nurses' experiences, revealed that\nimportant elements in nutritional care for the undernourished\nelderly seemed to be missing in clinical practice. These stud-\nies verify and reinforce each other by showing similar results.\nThe use of any nutritional risk screening tool was practi-\ncally absent in the hospital, and there were no established\nroutines for measuring weight. There was also a lack of\nappropriate weighing apparatus, for example, chair and bed\nweights, which made it challenging to obtain the weight of\ndiseased elderly who are often bed-bound and/or in severe\npain. There did not seem to be a system to make it possible\nfor the ward staff to routinely identify nutritional risk, which\nimplies that many of the undernourished elderly or those at\nrisk of becoming so are left unidentified. This finding of sys-\ntem failure is in accordance with other European studies on\nelderly hospitalized patients (Bonetti et al., 2013; Vanderwee\nhospital population (Bavelaar, Otter, van Bodegraven, Thijs,\n& van Bokhorst-de van der Schueren, 2008; Cereda et al.,\nAlthough the Norwegian guidelines represent an impor-\ntant step toward better nutritional care, it remains to ensure\nthat these guidelines are implemented in hospital practice.\nInterestingly, weight on admission was recorded more often\nat surgical wards and for patients who had been operated,\nalthough this was still rarely done. As weight information is\noften required before the initiation of anesthetics prior to sur-\ngery, many of these recordings were most likely obtained for\nreasons other than evaluating nutritional status.\nIf appropriately targeted, nutritional treatment can pro-\nduce various clinical benefits. For example, a recent review\nTable 4. Nutritional Treatment Performed at Wards.\nParameter, N (%) Total sample (N = 508) Nutritionally at risk (n = 201) Nutritionally not at risk (n = 252)\nInitiation of nutritional treatment?\nIf nutritional treatment: Type of nutritional treatment measure:\n Adaptations to the eating situation (sitting position, environment, feeding, support devices, shielding)\n Adaptations of the normal diet (portion size, appearance, prepared sandwiches)\n Adjusted diet (special meals, consistency)\n Energy- and nutrient-enriched meals\n Snacks between meals\n Supplement drinks\n Enteral nutrition\n Parenteral nutrition\n Referred to a clinical dietitian\nEide et al. 7\nconcluded that protein and energy supplementation produces\na small but consistent weight gain in older people and may\nhave beneficial effects on both mortality and complications\n(Milne, Potter, Vivanti, & Avenell, 2009). In this study, we\nfound a large discrepancy between the actual presence of\nnutritional risk and patients receiving nutritional treatment.\nAbout two thirds of patients nutritionally at risk received no\nnutritional treatment at all. This is, however, not surprising,\nbearing in mind the inadequate nutritional routines.\nNutritional treatment measures should always be imple-\nmented in the order of priority outlined in the Norwegian\nguidelines' \"nutritional ladder\" (The Norwegian Directorate\nof Health, 2009). The simplest and cheapest way to provide\nnutritional treatment is to get the patient to eat more of the\nhospital food, either by adapting the normal diet or by serv-\ning an adjusted diet, snacks in-between meals, or energy- and\nnutrient-enrichedmeals(Howardetal.,2006;Nieuwenhuizen,\nWeenen, Rigby, & Hetherington, 2010). In addition, the eat-\ning environment is important (Howard et al., 2006;\nNieuwenhuizen et al., 2010). However, some patients strug-\ngle to meet their nutrition requirements through the hospital\nfood alone, and supplement drinks and artificial nutrition\nshould be provided, in addition or as a substitute (Howard\nmeasures, such as adaptations to the eating situation or the\nnormal diet and supplement drinks, were more commonly\nused than artificial nutrition. However, adjusted diet, energy-\nand nutrient-enriched meals and snacks between meals were\nseldom used. Because it was not possible to evaluate the\ntreatment recorded on individual patients, we do not know\nwhether the treatment was properly targeted. Nevertheless,\nour results demonstrate that undernutrition and the risk of\nundernutrition were clearly undertreated, a fact that corre-\nsponds to other European studies on elderly patients (Bonetti\nto the general hospital population (Bavelaar et al., 2008;\n2011). Notably, few patients nutritionally at risk were\nreferred to a clinical dietitian, suggesting that they were\nrarely involved in the patients' treatment.\nAll elderly patients are potentially at risk of becoming\nundernourished, including also patients with normal weight\nand those overweight. In this study, more than 80% of the\npatients nutritionally at risk were of normal weight or over-\nweight. However, undernutrition and the risk of undernutri-\ntion are easily overlooked for these patients compared with\npatients who are underweight if nutritional risk screening is\nnot routinely performed. Suominen et al. demonstrated that\nonly the truly anorectic elderly patients were recognized as\nundernourished (Suominen, Sandelin, Soini, & Pitkala,\n2007). We found similar tendencies in our study, as patients\nwith BMI 18.49 kg/m2 were weighed more frequently on\nadmission and received nutritional treatment more often\nwhen nutritionally at risk, compared with patients with BMI\n18.5 kg/m2. The number of elderly people with high BMI is\nincreasing in the world's population, and it will be vital for\nhealth care professionals to be aware that undernutrition and\nthe risk of undernutrition also occur among these patients.\nLimitations\nThe high representativeness of the study sample was ensured\nby using a stratified sampling technique (Cochran, 1963) in\ndata collection, warranting sufficient representation of each\nparticipating ward.Adjustment for possible cluster effect due\nto stratification was used in sample size calculations. Patients\nfrom nearly all somatic medical and surgical wards at the\nparticipating hospital were included in the sample, in addi-\ntion to four associated wards. On this basis, the study sample\ncan be considered representative, and it provides a reliable\npicture of nutritional care for elderly patients without demen-\ntia at somatic wards.\nThe large number of students involved in data collection\nmight be seen as a shortcoming of the study. It can further be\nassumed that the students had little prior research experi-\nence. However, persons central in planning and carrying out\nthis study were experienced in using students for the collec-\ntion of research data (Sortland, Gjerlaug, & Harviken, 2013),\nand two persons central to the research project were avail-\nable to the students at the hospital on all screening days.\nMoreover, an interrater agreement study conducted exhibited\nan acceptable quality of the screening data (Eide et al., 2015).\nThe students were supervised in use of the screening form\nand the questionnaire prior to each screening day, and were\ninstructed to participate to safeguard and optimize the data\ncollection.\nAs information retrieved from the patients' medical\nrecords may not necessarily reflect the actual treatment and\ncare provided, due to poor documentation practices at the\nhospital, actual care practices may have been underreported.\nHowever, ensuring optimal documentation on nutritional\nmatters is one of the key recommendations stipulated in the\nnational guidelines (The Norwegian Directorate of Health,\n2009) and forms an important part of adequate nutritional\ncare. There was a considerable amount of missing data on\nnutritional treatment in this study, as well as frequent use of\n\"do not know\" when reporting the usage of nutritional risk\nscreening tools at different wards. The lack of routines and\ntreatment found in this study probably reflects the difficulties\nthe students had in finding any information on nutritional\nmatters in the patients' medical records.\nConclusion\nFrom the present study, we conclude that nutritional care rec-\nommended both internationally and nationally was not imple-\nmented at the participating hospital wards, suggesting that\nnutritional care for elderly hospitalized patients was not ade-\nquate. This implies that the majority of the elderly patients\nnutritionally at risk are neither identified nor treated according\n8 SAGE Open\nto their needs. There is a clear need as well as a high potential\nfor quality improvement in nutritional care so that the nutri-\ntional needs of the undernourished elderly or those at risk of\nbecoming so can be fulfilled. The results presented in this\nstudy will be important to consider when improving nutri-\ntional care practices for the hospitalized elderly, and it will be\nessential that nursing students receive proper nutritional edu-\ncation and training to meet the substantial challenges related to\nundernourishment in the hospital setting. The article highlights\nthe importance of having systematic nutritional care practices\nto make it possible for the ward staff to routinely identify\nnutritional risk and initiate appropriate nutritional treatment\nmeasures.\n"
