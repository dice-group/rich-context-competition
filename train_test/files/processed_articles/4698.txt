Results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed an unidimensional structure consistent with the\nconceptualized nature of cognitive test anxiety and previous examinations of the English version of the CTAR. Examination\nof the factor loadings revealed two items that were weakly related to the test anxiety construct and as such were prime\ncandidates for removal. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to compare model fit for the 25- and 23-item version\nof the measure. Results indicated that the 23-item version of the measure provided a better fit to the data which support\nthe removal of the problematic items in the Turkish version of the CTAR. Additional analyses demonstrated the internal\nconsistency, test\u00adretest reliability, concurrent validity, and gender equivalence for responses offered on the Turkish version\nof the measure. Results of the analysis revealed a 23-item Turkish version of the T-CTAR is a valid and reliable measure of\ncognitive test anxiety for use among Turkish students.\n",

Test anx-\niety research is indeed steeped in international perspectives,\nwith a long tradition of building theory and empirical evi-\ndence from diverse cultures. Although there are differences\nidentified in the measurement and impact of test anxiety\nacross different cultures, those differences are generally\nexplained by the variations across contexts related to the\neducational settings, conditions, or opportunities (e.g.,\nCassady, Mohammed, & Mathieu, 2004). The prevalence of\ntest anxiety has routinely been estimated to lie somewhere\nbetween 25% and 40% of learners reporting they experience\nsome degree of test anxiety (Carter, Williams, & Silverman,\nPutwain and Daly (2014) recently clarified this view by\nreporting that approximately 15% of learners reported they\nwere \"highly test anxious.\" Perhaps even more concerning is\nthe available evidence suggesting differential levels of test\nanxiety among certain societal groups. For instance, there is\na clear and consistent pattern of results in test anxiety litera-\nture suggesting that females as well as members of ethnic\nminority groups tend to report elevated levels of anxiety\nMcDonald, 2001). There is also a concern that not only the\npercentage of test anxious learners is increasing but also the\nseverity of the perceived anxiety in those learners is on the\nrise in countries where there is a high degree of academic\npressure tied to high-stakes tests (e.g., Casbarro, 2005; Lowe,\nAlthough the literature has provided several orientations to\nexplaining test anxiety and the influence of test anxiety on\nlearners and learner outcomes, there tends to be a general\nagreement that it is a multidimensional construct, with a two-\nfactor representation serving as the most enduring view.\nLiebert and Morris (1967) set the field forward with their rep-\nresentation of test anxiety as composed of emotionality and\nworry, which may also be conceptualized as affective and cog-\nnitive test anxieties. The emotionality aspect of test anxiety is\nidentified through biological and physiological responses to\nanxiety (e.g., elevated heart rhythm [HR], headaches, cortisol\nMicke, Mateo, Kozak, Foster, & Beilock, 2011). The\ncognitive--or worry--component attends to manifestations\nincluding (a) self-deprecating thoughts, (b) distractibility dur-\ning study and test-taking, (c) comparisons with peers, (d)\n1Ege University, Izmir, Turkey\n2Ball State University, Muncie, IN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nChristopher L.

This is\ngenerally explained through either a skills deficit orientation\n(i.e., poor cognitive skills and testing strategies lead to fail-\ntive-interference perspective (i.e., attentional resources\ndirected toward nontask activities; Sarason, 1988). Both per-\nspectives have merit, and likely explain the experience of a\ndiverse array of test anxious learners; that is, there are mul-\ntiple manifestations of the commonly reported construct of\ntest anxiety (Zeidner & Matthews, 2005). In both of these\norientations, it is important to recognize that the impact of\ntest anxiety on the learner and her or his outcomes is not\nrestricted to the testing situation itself. Rather, across all\nphases of the \"Learning-Testing Cycle,\" test anxiety can\nhave an impact that will decrease overall performance. As\nsuch, test anxiety affects the learners' experience during test\npreparation, test performance, and test reflection (Rafferty,\nAssessment of Cognitive Test Anxiety\nThe Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale (CTAR; Cassady &\nJohnson, 2002) was developed to assess only the cognitive\naspects of test anxiety, across the learning\u00adtesting cycle. The\nscale has been used in the United States (e.g., Bourne, Arend,\nand Greece (Tsianos, Lekkas, Germanakos, Mourlas, &\nSamaras, 2009); it has also been effectively translated for use\n(Furlan, Cassady, & Perez, 2009). Sparked in large part by\nthese cross-cultural validation studies, the CTAR has been\nrevised to eliminate reverse-coded items that were deter-\nmined to measure a separate construct (i.e., \"test confi-\ndence\"; Cassady & Finch, 2014). The current Cognitive Test\nAnxiety Scale\u00adRevised (CTAR) is a 25-item measure that is\ncomposed largely of the original items from the CTAR.\nTest Anxiety in Turkey\nEffective research on test anxiety in new cultural settings can\nonly be realized in the socio-cultural framework of the\neducational setting within which students experience academic\nstressors. Similar to other European countries, secondary edu-\ncation students in Turkey face high levels of stress related to\ntesting due to several layers of highly competitive educational\nassessments used to determine access to University programs\nadmissions in Turkey are dependent on (a) student performance\nin secondary education, (b) determined quality of the second-\nary school the student attended, and (c) a two-stage national-\nlevel central exam (G\u00fcr & \u00c7elik, 2009). In this system,\nlikelihood of admission in post-secondary programs has been\ntraditionally highly dependent on the quality--or reputation--\nof the high school they attended (G\u00fcr & \u00c7elik, 2009). The cre-\nation of central exams was intended in part to mitigate potential\ninequality in admissions deliberations (cbay, 2005). However,\nthere continues to be concern that mismatches between high\nschool educational curriculum and the central assessments con-\ntributes to considerable difficulties and uneasiness for students\nAvailable data suggest Turkish universities are highly\nselective with admissions. A recent examination conducted\nby the OSYM Student Selection and Placement Center\n(2014) revealed that more than 2 million students applied for\npost-secondary study in Turkish universities--including\nboth undergraduate and graduate levels. Of these students,\ngraduate-level programs with an even smaller amount being\nstudy. This competitive climate for attaining access to qual-\nity higher education naturally sparks concerns for high\nthe rates of reported test anxiety reported by students prepar-\ning to take the Turkish national exams were higher than gen-\neral reported levels (Aydin & Yerin, 1994; Pinar-Bapinar,\ndents preparing for the Turkish national exam reporting hav-\ning test anxiety (Dereli, 2003), and another line of work\nclaimed that 84.1% reported either moderate or high levels\nCurrent Investigation\nThe CTAR is not unique in having an international\npresence--several measures have been adapted for use in\nvarious cultures and languages (e.g., Friedman & Bendas-\nTurkish versions.

We believe these multinational investi-\ngations are essential to expand the growing understanding of\nacademic anxieties in a myriad of cultural contexts--with\nparticular attention to unique experiences for traditional\nunderrepresented or underserved groups.\nMethod\nParticipants\nData were collected from high school seniors (N = 1075,\n55% female) attending secondary schools located in Izmir\nis located in the west, and it is one of three metropolises in\nTurkey.

The TAI (Spielberger, 1980) is a\n20-item measure designed to assess the multidimensional\nnature of test anxiety. Participants indicated their typical\nreactions to evaluative situations using a 4-point Likert-type\nscale (1 = never, 4 = always). TAI items can be used to create\ntwo subscales assessing the Worry and Emotionality dimen-\nsions of test anxiety--as well as an indicator of overall levels\nof test anxiety. Previous examinations have demonstrated\nthat the TAI possesses acceptable levels of internal consis-\ntency (Worry,  = .93; Emotionality  = .94) and is a valid\nindicator of test anxiety among members of the Turkish pop-\nsion of the original CTAR (Cassady & Johnson, 2002) that is\ndesigned to assess the cognitive indicators of test anxiety.\nParticipants reported how well each of the presented items\ndescribes them using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at\nall like me, 4 = very much like me). Previous work with the\nCTAR has demonstrated that the measure is a reliable and\nvalid measure of the cognitive test anxiety construct (Cas-\nProcedure\nTranslation of CTAR.Three fluent English\u00adTurkish bilinguals\nwere recruited to translate the CTAR from English into Turk-\nish for use in the current examination. To maximize the valid-\nity of the cultural adaptation of the measure, translators were\ninstructed to emphasize transliteral equivalence between the\nEnglish and Turkish versions of the CTAR. As result, certain\nphrases were modified to reflect the educational structure of\nTurkish society. For example, in the Turkish educational sys-\ntem, the phrase \"final exam\" is only used within the context of\npost-secondary education. Therefore, the wording on Item 11\nof the CTAR was translated from \"I tend to freeze up on things\nlike intelligence tests and final exams\" to \"I tend to freeze up\non important exams\" to ensure the statements evoked similar\nmeaning among high school and university students.\nFirst, we administered the Turkish version of the CTAR to\na small group of students similar to the population of interest\n(n = 10) to ensure that typical high school learners were able\nto effectively respond to the newly translated items as ini-\ntially prescribed. They reported some words in scale (e.g.,\n\"final exam\") were not appropriate for common use in their\nhigh school settings. Next, we shared those students'\nresponses and the Turkish version of the CTAR with a panel\nof six independent experts who rated (a) the validity of lan-\nguage used with the Turkish translation and (b) the overall\nmeaning of items included in the Turkish version. This pro-\ncess was undertaken to ensure that the translation focus on\ntransliteral equivalence was reached--which ensures that the\nnewly translated version will focus on the same construct\nrather than merely mimic the words in the original survey\n(Hocevar & El-Zahhar, 1992). Based on these two initial\nvalidation checks of the language, minor changes were made\nto the measure. At that point, the Turkish version of the\nCognitive Test Anxiety Scale\u00adRevised (T-CTAR) was back-\ntranslated from Turkish back into English by a linguist who\nsubsequently compared the semantic equivalence of the\nEnglish and Turkish versions of the scale.\nPrimary data collection. All participants were volunteers who\nprovided informed consent prior to taking part in the study.\nParticipants in the current examination completed a struc-\ntured questionnaire form containing a general information\nquestionnaire (i.e., demographic questionnaire), the Turkish\nversion of the TAI (\u00d6ner & Kaymak, 1987), and the Turkish\nversion of the CTAR (Cassady & Finch, 2015). The partici-\npants completed each measure in classrooms located on their\nrespective high school campuses. The experimental proce-\ndure took approximately 10 min to complete, and each par-\nticipant completed the experimental materials individually.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe mean scores and standard deviations for each measure\nare presented in Table 1.\nStructural Validity of T-CTAR\nTo explore the structural validity of the T-CTAR, we ran-\ndomly split the full 1,075-participant sample into two\n4 SAGE Open\nrandom halves. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was\nconducted on Sample 1 (n = 536) using Principle Axis\nFactoring with the Promax rotation. The EFA was conducted\nusing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS;\nVersion 21).

However,\nexamination of the scree plot revealed a single dominant fac-\ntor accounting for a large amount of the total variance. We\ndecided on a single-factor solution as it was interpretable,\nsupported by previous research exploring the dimensionality\nof the CTAR (Cassady & Finch, 2015), and accounted for\n38.8% of the total variance (see Table 2 for factor loadings).\nTwo items were dropped (Items 22 and 24) from the factor\nsolution because their factor loadings fell below the com-\nmonly used criterion value of 0.30 (Tabachnick & Fidell,\n2013).

Results demonstrated the\nresults of both factor solutions demonstrate the Turkish\nCTAR provides a durable unidimensional solution to the\nconstruct of cognitive test anxiety that is consistent with the\ninitial conceptualization measured by the original English\nversion (Cassady & Johnson, 2002). Although both factor\nsolutions demonstrate sufficient model fit, review of the item\nstatistics as well as consideration of the meaning of the items\nwithin the cultural context of Turkey led to the decision that\nthe most appropriate version for use in research in the Turkish\nversion is the 23-item version (see Table 2).\nReliability of T- CTAR\nAn additional group of high school students (n = 30, 50%\nfemale) from the Izmir region were recruited to explore the\nreliability of the T- CTAR. The composition of the subsam-\nple was found to be consistent with that of the sample uti-\nlized during primary data collection. Mean age for the\nPearson product\u00admoment correlation coefficient revealed\na strong positive correlation between Time 1 and Time 2\nscores, r = .93, p < .001, suggesting the T-CTAR provides\nstable estimates of cognitive test anxiety across time. The\ninternal consistency of the 23-item T-CTAR was found to\nalign with prior studies, illustrating an excellent level of\ninternal consistency (Cronbach's  = .93). These results are\nconsistent with prior research demonstrating the stability of\nscores on cognitive test anxiety in a sample collected in the\nUnited States (Cassady et al., 2004). Correlational analyses\nwere conducted using the SPSS software (Version 21).\nConcurrent Validity: TAI\nTo explore the concurrent validity of the Turkish CTAR, we\ncomputed Pearson product\u00admoment correlation coefficients\nby assessing the relationship between the Turkish CTAR and\nthe well-established TAI (Spielberger, 1980). Correlation\nanalyses were once again conducted using the SPSS soft-\nware (Version 21). Prior studies with various measures of\ntest anxiety have repeatedly demonstrated that the theoreti-\ncally separate dimensions of test anxiety tend to share mod-\nerate to high positive correlations (Kalechstein, Hocevar,\nanticipated the Turkish CTAR would be positively related to\nthe two subscales as well as the total score for the TAI.\nHowever, given the conceptual alignment between cognitive\ntest anxiety and worry, we anticipated these two scores\nwould share the highest correlation.\nResults of the analysis revealed strong positive correla-\ntions among the test anxiety measures used in this study (see\nTable 3). The correlations among the T-CTAR and the Worry\nand Emotionality subscales of the TAI were similar, with a\nslightly higher correlation observed between T-CTAR and\nWorry. This is in line with the theoretical intent of the\nT-CTAR, providing good indication of concurrent validity\nfor the new T-CTAR. The positive relationship with the\nEmotionality scale is not surprising--that is, cognitive test\nanxiety is not separate from the emotionality construct. Prior\nstudies with the original CTAR have routinely demonstrated\nsimilar correlations with Sarason's (1984) Bodily Symptoms\nTable 1.

In the current examination, DIF\nwas assessed using an hybrid, iterative, ordinal logistic\nregression method that utilizes techniques common to item\nresponse theory to identify--and control for--levels of the\nlatent trait under examination (Choi et al., 2011). The use of\nan iterative, hybrid ordinal logistic regression method pro-\nvides several advantages in the current examination as it\nallowed for an examination of uniform, nonuniform, and\ntotal DIF effects for each of the T-CTAR Items. DIF analyses\nResults of the DIF analysis revealed 10 items that were\nfunctioning differentially between males and females after\ncontrolling for overall levels of cognitive text anxiety.\nBecause DIF screening using ordinal logistic regression\ntechniques is based on the likelihood ratio statistic, some\nhave expressed concern that given a large enough sample\nsize the test will produce statistically significant, albeit\nmeaningless, differences in item functioning (Choi et al.,\n2011). Therefore, the magnitude of the DIF effects in the cur-\nrent analysis were examined using the criteria set forth\nnaled meaningful differences in item functioning.\nExamination of the pseudo R2 values for each items exhibit-\ning DIF revealed no pseudo R2 values exceeded .01 for tests\nexploring uniform, nonuniform, and total DIF effects. These\nfindings suggest that although statistical differences in item\nfunctioning were detected between the genders, items on the\nT-CTAR were functioning equivalently for males and\nfemales in the current sample. Items identified as possessing\nDIF and pseudo R2 values for the tests of uniform, nonuni-\nform, and total DIF are presented in Table 4.\nGender Differences in the Experience of Test\nAnxiety\nTo compare gender difference in the perception and experi-\nence of cognitive test anxiety, an independent samples t test\nwas conducted comparing levels of test anxiety reported by\nmales and females on the T-CTAR. Results of the analysis\nrevealed females reported significantly higher levels of cog-\nd = 0.30. These results support previous findings suggesting\nthat females often report higher levels of test anxiety than\nHembree, 1988) and, when considered in conjunction with\nthe previously described DIF analysis, suggest the observed\ngender differences cannot be attributed to the differential\nfunctioning of items contained in the T-CTAR.\nDiscussion\nThe primary focus of this study was to test the viability of a\nnewly designed T-CTAR in measuring levels of cognitive\ntest anxiety in a sample of high school students in the final\nyear of secondary education. In addition, the study was\ndesigned to examine the relationships among the T-CTAR\nand the well-established Turkish version of the TAI.\nTranslation efforts resulted in a measure that students and\nexperts alike agreed provided a valid treatment of the test\nanxiety construct for use in educational and research con-\ntexts. Furthermore, investigation of the factorial structure for\nthe T-CTAR demonstrated that while the 25-item single-fac-\ntor solution is viable, a 23-item solution was superior. For\nboth versions, the results confirmed a line of research illus-\ntrating that the core items in the T-CTAR and CTAR can rep-\nresent a central construct of cognitive test anxiety that is\nBozkurt et al. 7\nmost readily conceived as a single dimension when examin-\ning the general population (Cassady & Finch, 2015).\nThe analyses also provided compelling evidence that two\nitems from the English version of the CTAR should be\nproblematic for achieving optimal fit in prior work with the\nEnglish version (Cassady & Finch, 2015) and addresses the\nnotion that \"luck\" plays a role in successful test performance.\nThe repeated failure of this item to fit well within the cogni-\ntive test anxiety construct suggests it is not a good item for\nfuture use. This particular item raises another issue of cul-\ntural context that bears attention in studies of test anxiety in\na multicultural framework. The concept of \"luck\" was raised\nin prior studies with diverse populations who viewed any\nissues of chance or luck to be determined in a religious or\nspiritual context. Within different religious and cultural\nframeworks, the concept of luck may very well carry differ-\nent meaning and further supporting removal. Item 22\naddresses focuses on recognizing mistakes after completing\ntests--which may be peripherally related to test anxiety but\nnot a direct component characteristic. Although the item has\nperformed reasonably in prior versions, it was clearly not a\nuseful item in the T-CTAR.\nFurther analyses demonstrated that the gender differ-\nences observed in total cognitive test anxiety (including in\nthis study) were not a measurement artifact deriving from\ninappropriate DIF for specific items on the T-CTAR. As\nsuch, the data illustrate that males and females respond in a\nfunctionally similar way for the collection of 23 items on\nthe T-CTAR. Consequently, gender differences noted in\noverall T-CTAR scores can be presumed to illustrate a gen-\nerally higher level of cognitive test anxiety for high school\nfemales in Turkey than their male counterparts. This pattern\nis consistent with a long history of research in test anxiety\nand other measures of negative affective responses (e.g.,\nbut the advantage of the data in this study is that the spe-\ncific focus on item-level differences among males and\nfemales has been ruled out as a source of meaningful expla-\nnation for gender differences.\nThe study also supported that the T-CTAR was a valid and\nreliable measure of test anxiety, as demonstrated in the high\ninternal consistency and theoretically consistent pattern of\nconvergent validity observed when assessed alongside the\nTurkish version of Spielberger's (1980) TAI. The data did\nnot follow primarily expected patterns because the correla-\ntions between T-CTAR and the subscales of the TAI did not\ndiverge as anticipated. However, this was revealed to be\nmore of an issue with the extremely high correlation between\nthe subscales in the TAI, precluding effectively identifying\ndivergent validity with the current measures.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: Portions of this\nwork were supported by the Research Design Studio at Ball State\nUniversity and the Ball State University Aspire Grants program.\nReferences\nAydin, G., & Yerin, O.
