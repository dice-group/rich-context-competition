Whitaker\n Key words: safety, residence characteristics, environ-\nment, mothers, crime\nIntroduction\nThe characteristics of neighborhoods can influence how\nand where people spend their time (1). For example, certain\nneighborhood characteristics may lead people to spend less\ntime outdoors. More indoor time may contribute to obesity\nby decreasing physical activity and by increasing sedentary\nbehaviors and food intake.\nPeople's perception of social disorder and of collective\nefficacy in their neighborhood may influence how much\ntime they spend outdoors. Social disorder is a measure of\nneighborhood safety that describes potentially threatening\nneighborhood conditions and behaviors such as the presence\nof drug dealing, loitering, and public intoxication (2,3).\nSuch neighborhood activities may lead people to remain in\ntheir homes, thereby constraining their outdoor activity and\nreducing daily energy expenditure.\nCollective efficacy is a measure of people's perception of\ncloseness or connection with their neighbors (social cohe-\nsion and trust) and the capacity of neighbors to intervene on\nbehalf of their community to reach common goals (informal\nsocial control) (4). Distrust and lack of collective accom-\nplishment are associated with violence and victimization,\neven after taking into account the economic and demo-\ngraphic characteristics of residents (4). Therefore, low lev-\nels of perceived collective efficacy, like low levels of per-\nceived neighborhood safety, might be associated with a\ntendency for people to remain indoors.\nIf people do not feel safe in their neighborhoods or\nconnected to their neighbors, this could also increase levels\nof perceived psychological stress. For some, chronic stress\ncould lead to functional impairment through anxiety or\ndepressed mood. These emotions could increase social iso-\nlation and reduce energy expenditure in routine or leisure-\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

Perceived stress or symp-\ntoms of depression or anxiety can also increase food intake\nin some individuals (5,6).\nDespite the hypothesized link between the perceived\nlevel of neighborhood safety and obesity, we are aware of\nno studies in adults that have evaluated this association.\nUsing data collected in 20 U.S. cities, we tested the hypoth-\neses that women with young children who lived in neigh-\nborhoods that they perceived as unsafe and as having lower\nlevels of collective efficacy would have a higher mean BMI\nand a higher prevalence of obesity than those who lived in\nneighborhoods where these characteristics were perceived\nto be more favorable.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nStudy Design and Sample\nThe Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study is a birth\ncohort study following 4898 children and their parents. This\nreport focuses on the mothers. The sample was drawn from\ncause unmarried mothers were oversampled (3:1) relative to\nmarried mothers (7), 3712 of the women in the study were\nunmarried (so-called fragile families) when the baseline\nsurvey was conducted at delivery.\nWomen were ineligible (5% of sampled births) if their\nchild was placed for adoption, if they did not speak either\nEnglish or Spanish adequately to understand the survey, or\nif they were too ill after delivery. Most hospitals did not\nallow women 18 years of age to participate. Among\neligible women, 82% of those married and 87% of those\nunmarried agreed to participate. The institutional review\nboards at all birth hospitals, as well as those at Princeton and\nColumbia Universities, approved the data collection proce-\ndures. All participants gave informed written consent.\n(53%) participated in an in-home survey during which\nheight and weight measurements were obtained and mothers\nresponded to questions about their neighborhood. The ra-\ncial/ethnic composition of the mothers was different among\nthose who were followed-up at 3 years and those who were\nnot (non-Hispanic white, 20% vs. 23%; non-Hispanic black,\nwere no significant differences in baseline income, marital\nstatus, age, or education.\nMeasures\nBMI. BMI (kilograms per meter squared) was calculated\nfrom the women's measured or self-reported heights and\nweights. In two of the cities, all heights were reported. In the\nother 18 cities, heights were measured, and those who\nrefused were asked to report their height. All subjects were\nweighed unless they were pregnant, exceeded the scale limit\nof 140 kg, or refused. In each of these situations, the subject\nwas asked to report her current weight (or her prepregnant\nweight if she was pregnant).\nwith BMI data. Of these, a total of 675 (28%) had reported,\nrather than measured, height or weight; 180 were pregnant,\nboth.\nNeighborhood Safety/Social Disorder. Perception of\nneighborhood safety was assessed using the Neighborhood\nEnvironment for Children Rating Scales (8). This eight-item\nscale, designed to measure social disorder, asked the women\nhow often they saw events in their neighborhoods such as\nloitering adults, gang activity, drunks or drug dealers hang-\ning around, and disorderly or misbehaving groups of youths\nor adults.\nThe four response options (never, rarely, sometimes, and\nfrequently) were assigned the values 1 through 4, respec-\ntively. Internal reliability of the eight items, as measured by\nCronbach , was 0.91. The scale score was computed as the\nmean value of the responses for all women who completed\nat least six of the eight items. The scale scores ranged from\n1 to 4, with lower scores indicating a higher level of\nperceived safety. Because the scale scores were not nor-\nmally distributed, they were divided into tertiles. The safest\ntertile (referred to as high safety) included all women with\na score equal to 1.0 (i.e., answering never to all items). The\nmedium safety tertile scores ranged from 1.1 to 2.0, and the\nleast safe tertile (referred to as low safety) included all\nwomen with a score  2.0.\nCollective Efficacy. The measure of collective efficacy\nwas adapted from the 1995 Community Survey of the\nProject on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods\n(4). This construct consisted of two components: social\ncohesion and trust, the level of trust and attachment among\nneighbors; and informal social control, a belief in the ca-\npacity of neighborhood residents to intervene to help the\ncommunity reach collective goals. Each component con-\nsisted of five items. For the social cohesion and trust com-\nponent, the women recorded their level of agreement to\nstatements about their neighbors, such as, \"People in this\nneighborhood can be trusted.\" The five response options\nwere strongly agree, somewhat agree, neither agree nor\ndisagree, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree. The\ninformal social control construct consisted of questions\nabout how likely neighbors were to intervene in certain\nsituations, such as if a fight broke out in front of their house\nor if children were skipping school. The five response\noptions were very likely, somewhat likely, neither likely nor\nunlikely, somewhat unlikely, and very unlikely.\nThe response options for each of the 10 items, ranging\nfrom strongly agree to strongly disagree (social cohesion\nand trust) and very likely to very unlikely (social control),\nNeighborhood Safety and Maternal Obesity, Burdette, Wadden, and Whitaker\nwere assigned the values 1 to 5. Internal reliability of the 10\nitems, as measured by Cronbach , was 0.85. A collective\nefficacy score was computed for all mothers who completed\nat least four of the five items for each of the two compo-\nnents (i.e., at least eight of the 10 total items) by averaging\nthe responses to the completed items. The scale scores\nranged from 1 to 5, with a higher number indicating a lower\nlevel of collective efficacy. These scores were divided into\ntertiles to facilitate the interpretation of results. Women in\nthe low-efficacy tertile were those who rated their neigh-\nborhoods as having the least collective efficacy (highest\nscale score), and women in the high efficacy tertile were\nthose who rated their neighborhood as having the most\ncollective efficacy (lowest scale scores).\nCovariates. Income was calculated as a ratio of house-\nhold income divided by the income at the federal poverty\nthreshold for a given household size in the year of reporting\n(see http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/poverty.shtml). Other so-\nciodemographic covariates included education, race/ethnic-\nity, and current marital status.\nSmoking status (yes/no variable) and 12-month history of\na major depressive episode [yes/no variable computed from\nthe Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short\nForm, version 1.0 (World Health Organization) (9\u00ad11)]\nwere obtained at 3 years. These two conditions are poten-\ntially related to both the exposure (neighborhood context)\nreported the number of hours (0 to 24) the television (TV)1\nwas on in the house each day. This variable served as a\nproxy for TV viewing.\nData Analysis\nObesity was defined as having a BMI  30 kg/m2.\nAcross the three tertiles of neighborhood safety and collec-\ntive efficacy, we compared the mean BMI using one-way\nANOVA, and we compared the prevalence of obesity using\n2 tests. We then used General Linear Models to compare\nmean BMI and percentage obese across these tertiles after\nadjusting for covariates.\nResults\nThirty percent were married, 38% lived in households re-\nporting income below the federal poverty threshold (in-\ncome-to-poverty ratio  1.00), and 66% reported no edu-\ncation beyond high school (Table 1). Approximately one-\nhalf the women were non-Hispanic black, and one-fourth\nwere Hispanic (any race).\nwomen were more likely to be obese and to have higher\nBMI if they were less educated, unmarried, had lower\nincome, or were Hispanic or non-Hispanic black (Table 1).\nWomen who reported symptoms in the prior 12 months\nconsistent with a major depressive episode had higher mean\nBMI and were more likely to be obese.\nWomen who were more educated, married, non-Hispanic\nwhite, older, and had higher income were more likely to\nperceive their neighborhoods as being safer and as having\nmore collective efficacy (Table 2). Women with a depres-\nsive episode were more likely to perceive their neighbor-\nhoods as less safe and as having lower collective efficacy.\nThe average amount of time (hours per day) the TV was on\nin the house was higher in obese women (8.4 vs. 9.1; p \n0.009) and was higher when neighborhoods were perceived\nas being less safe (low-safety to high-safety tertile, 10.3,\nNeighborhood Safety\nIn bivariate analysis, women had higher mean BMI and\na higher prevalence of obesity as the level of perceived\nneighborhood safety decreased (Table 3). After adjusting\nfor sociodemographic factors (household income, educa-\ntion, race/ethnicity, age, and relationship status as the cat-\negorical variables listed in Table 1), obesity prevalence\nand mean BMI were still significantly associated with\nneighborhood safety. Across the three tertiles, from the\nhigh-safety to the low-safety tertile, the mean BMI went\nfurther addition of three variables (smoking, depression,\nand number of hours per day the TV was on) had minimal\nimpact on the relationship between BMI or obesity and\nsafety (adjusted model in Table 3). After adjustment for\nall covariates, the prevalence of obesity was 9 percentage\npoints higher among women in the least safe tertile com-\npared with those in the safest tertile. Using an obesity\ncut-off point of BMI  40 kg/m2, obesity prevalence still\nincreased significantly from the high-safety to the low-\nall covariates.\nCollective Efficacy\nIn bivariate analysis, women who perceived lower\nlevels of collective efficacy had higher mean BMI and also\ntended to have a higher prevalence of obesity (Table 3).\nHowever, after adjusting for all covariates, there was no\nclear relationship between collective efficacy and either\nmean BMI or obesity prevalence. Using an obesity cut-off\npoint of BMI  40 kg/m2, obesity prevalence was not\nsignificantly different from lowest to highest level of col-\ncovariates.\n1 Nonstandard abbreviation: TV, television.\nNeighborhood Safety and Maternal Obesity, Burdette, Wadden, and Whitaker\nTable 1.

Several studies\nhave explored the relationship between neighborhood safety\nand physical activity. In a national telephone survey of 1600\nadults, neighborhood safety was shown to be a barrier to\nTable 2.

In qualitative studies, safety\nhas been reported by minority women to be a barrier to\nphysical activity (18).\nIn contrast to these studies, others have shown that safety\nand crime are not associated with physical activity levels. In\na cross-sectional study of 1800 U.S. adults, subject report of\nhigh crime in the neighborhood was not significantly related\nto physical activity after adjusting for age, sex, race, in-\nyears of age and older, neither the perception of high levels\nof crime nor lack of safe places to exercise was associated\nwith leisure-time physical activity (20).\nAlthough obesity was related to our measure of neigh-\nborhood safety, it was not related to our measure of collec-\ntive efficacy. It is possible that outdoor physical activity is\nmore influenced by the fear associated with social disorder\nthan by a sense of low social cohesion and trust in the\nneighborhood or a low level of informal social control. In\naddition, women who perceived their neighborhoods as\nhaving low collective efficacy may still have had meaning-\nful social connections with individuals outside of their\nneighborhood. These connections may have resulted in psy-\nchological benefits that offset any psychological distress\nassociated with the perception of low collective efficacy in\ntheir neighborhood.\nFrom our cross-sectional study, we cannot infer that low\nlevels of neighborhood safety cause obesity. It is possible,\nfor example, that obese women may be more inclined to\nperceive their neighborhood as unsafe because they are\nsubjected to higher levels of discrimination (21). We have\nno measurement of physical activity to evaluate whether\nreduced physical activity mediates the relationship between\nsafety and obesity. The hours per day that the TV was on in\nthe household is only a proxy measure for TV viewing time,\nwhich is, in turn, not necessarily correlated with physical\nactivity levels.\nWe also had no information on diet. Neighborhoods with\nlow levels of safety may also have a lower availability of\nfoods that could reduce the risk of obesity (22,23). How-\never, we did control for individual-level indicators of race/\nethnicity and social class that may be related to both diet\nand neighborhood safety. It is also possible that neighbor-\nhood safety affects obesity by other factors, such as psy-\nchological stress, that influence both energy intake and\nexpenditure. Although we had no measure of perceived\nstress, chronic stress may contribute to depression, which\nwas included in our analysis but which did not seem to\nmediate the BMI-safety relationship.\nAlthough multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved\nin the association between neighborhood safety and obesity,\nthe one most often proposed involves the effect of safety on\nphysical activity. Therefore, the lack of data on physical\nactivity in this study is an important limitation that should\nbe addressed in future research.\nTable 3.

In the Moving to Opportunity\nstudy, low-income families were randomly assigned to re-\nceive housing vouchers that could be used to move to\nneighborhoods that varied in the percentage of residents\nliving in poverty (24). Women who received vouchers to\nobtain housing in higher income neighborhoods had a sig-\nnificantly lower prevalence of obesity at follow-up. Al-\nthough the neighborhood safety levels were not measured,\nwomen in the higher income neighborhoods did have\nlower levels of anxiety and depression, suggesting the pos-\nsibility that psychological stress may be part of a causal\npathway between neighborhood safety and obesity. Adding\nmeasures of safety perception, psychological stress, physi-\ncal activity, sedentary time, and dietary intake to experi-\nments or quasi-experiments of neighborhood mobility\nwould help increase our understanding of the effect of the\nneighborhood environment on obesity.\nAlthough the neighborhood context is often mentioned\nas an important factor influencing adult physical activity\nlevels and obesity (25,26), this is the first study, to our\nknowledge, to find an association between perceived safety\nand BMI. This finding has particular implications for the\nobesity epidemic because our study focused on women of\nchildbearing age who have young preschool children. Many\nwomen were living in low-income households. Not only do\nlow-income minority women experience higher rates of\nobesity (27,28), but many are single mothers who are im-\nportant role models and facilitators of their children's ac-\ntivity levels. Thus, future studies should not only assess how\nperceived safety influences adult physical activity and obe-\nsity, but they should also attempt to evaluate what aspects of\nperceived neighborhood safety influence children's outdoor\nplay.\n"
