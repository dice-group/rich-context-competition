Susan Marquis\nHealth insurance purchasing alli-\nances (for brevity, we use the term\n\"alliances\") are one component of\nmany state and national health reform plans\nintended to move us toward the goal of uni-\nversal coverage.1 Alliances were intended to\nexpand coverage by making insurance more\nattractive and affordable to small employer\ngroups. The presence of an alliance also was\nhoped to stimulate competition in the rest of\nthe small-group market, thereby leading to\nexpanded coverage outside of the alliance as\nwell. Previous work, based on qualitative\nmethods and the perceptions of key inform-\nants, suggests that alliances have not gener-\nally offered lower prices. However, some ob-\nservers believe that they have had important\nspillover benefits to the market as a whole.\nThe most important feature of alliances\nthat might make insurance more attractive is\npermitting employers to offer their employees\na choice of plans, something that was not\npractical for small groups otherwise.2 Some,\nhowever, have questioned the importance to\nemployees of expanded choice, especially for\nthose in very small groups. The Florida alli-\nances, for example, planned to eliminate the\nchoice requirement for very small employers\n(those with four or fewer employees).3 The\nchoice feature is thought to have helped small\nemployers offer managed care without forcing\nall oftheiremployees into a single health main-\ntenance organization (HMO).4 In one state the\nalliance may have speeded small groups' mov-\ning from indemnity to managed care.5\nMaking insurance more affordable is\nviewed as critical to getting more small\ngroups to offer coverage.6 Alliances are seen as\na means of lowering administrative costs and,\nin principle, giving small groups collective\npurchasing power to negotiate lower rates\nfrom insurance carriers and health plans. The\nlatest information available from states that\nhave implemented alliances suggests that\nprices inside and outside the alliances are\ncomparable, however.7 Hopes of lower admin-\n\u00a92001ProjectHOPE\u00adThePeople-to-PeopleHealth Foundation,Inc.\nThe authors are senior economists at RAND's Washington office.\nemployer surveys to assess whether the three\nlargest statewide small-group health insurance\npurchasing alliances--in California, Connecticut,\nand Florida--increased coverage in small busi-\nness. They did not. Specifically, they did not re-\nduce small-group market health insurance premi-\nums, and they did not raise small-business\nhealth insurance offer rates. We explore and dis-\ncuss some reasons why. Alliances do permit em-\nployers to offer much greater choice in the\nnumber and types of plans; employees are found\nto take advantage of this wider choice.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This suggests that\nalliance prices in California remained below\nmarket for the first several years. However,\nrecent reports suggest that pricing in Califor-\nnia's alliance now merely accords to that in\nthe outside market. Florida appears to have\nhad a similar experience.9\nThe lack of a price advantage to purchasing\nwithin most alliances is cited as a critical fac-\ntor accounting for their low market penetra-\ntion. Although some alliances grew very rap-\nidly from their small base levels at first, their\nultimate market penetration has fallen far\nshort of initial expectations.10 Many also point\nto the initial failure of some alliances to recog-\nnize the important role that agents and bro-\nkers play in the small-group market (or to\nreimburse them adequately). Many brokers\nsaw the alliances as a threat to their business\nand, as a result, refused to promote the alli-\nance products to employers.11 A final impedi-\nment to success for some alliances has been\nlimited marketing.12\nNonetheless, many observers have credited\nalliances with being catalysts for change in\nthe small-group market overall.13 Pricing par-\nity inside and outside the alliance does not\nnecessarily spell failure in making insurance\nmore affordable. Officials in several states be-\nlieve that the presence of an alliance promoted\nprice competition, leading to generally lower\nprices for small groups. This is attributed, in\npart, to the ease of comparative shopping that\nthe alliance provides, with its standardized\nbenefit packages and published rates.14 Alli-\nances also have been credited with inducing\nsome insurers to offer multiple benefit designs\nto their small-group clients, thereby increas-\ning choice outside the alliance.15 In these\nways, the presence of an alliance may indi-\nrectly lead to expanded coverage, even if the\nalliance does not directly enroll a large\nnumber of newly insured groups.\nThe purpose of this study is to explore\nthese issues in the three states with the larg-\nest small-group alliances in the nation. We\nuse data from 1997 employer surveys that in-\nterviewed both alliance participants and non-\nparticipants. Our contribution to the litera-\nture comes from using quantitative methods\nto assess the effects of several different alli-\nances in a parallel fashion. Thus, it comple-\nments the previous literature reporting re-\nsults based on qualitative methods.\nThe Study Alliances\nWe studied the Health Insurance PlanofCali-\nfornia (HIPC), sponsored by the California\nManaged Risk Medical Insurance Board;\nHealth Connections, sponsored by the Con-\nnecticut Business and Industry Association\n(CBIA); and the Florida Community Health\nPurchasing Alliances (CHPA).16 The alliances\nwere similar in severalimportant ways, yet their\ndifferences permit us to better generalize about\nthe variety of alliance designs in existence.17\nAll three alliances operated statewide in\n1997 and were based on managed competition\nprinciples--that is, choice of plans, stan-\ndardized benefits, and annual open enroll-\nment. California offered complete employee\nchoice of all participating plans operating in\nthe employer's geographic area, which at the\ntime of our study included numerous HMOs\nand some point-of-service (POS) plans and\npreferred provider organizations (PPOs).\nConnecticut offered employer choice from\namong sixteen options--four insurers times\ntwo plan types times two benefit levels--\nwith full employee choice encouraged. Florida\noffered employer choice among all participat-\ning plans in the area but required employers\nto offer at least some choice. Employee choice\nwas limited to those plans selected by the em-\nployer, although in fact most employers of-\nfered the full array of options in their area.\nEach alliance was introduced against a back-\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

California's was a single, state-\nsponsored alliance, managed by an inde-\npendent state agency that had an independent\npolicy-making board. Florida had eleven area\nCHPAs, each a private, nonprofit organiza-\ntion. The CHPAs were started with seed\nmoney from the state government and func-\ntioned under state charter and with state\nagency oversight and management. The CBIA\nis a private association; Health Connections is\nopen to all small businesses in Connecticut.\nIn California and Connecticut the alliance\nwas permitted to contract selectively with\nhealth plans. In Florida the alliances could not\ncontract with plans and were required to\nmake available all plans that wished to be of-\nfered at their market prices. In fact, most in-\nsurers in that state were prohibited from of-\nfering different premiums based on claims\ncosts for groups in and out of the alliance and\ncould vary only the administrative costs in the\npremium. Connecticut also prohibited plans\nfrom offering different premiums to groups in\nand out of the alliance. Both Connecticut and\nFlorida required employers to enroll through\na broker. In California, employers could enroll\nthrough a broker or directly through the alli-\nance. California initially offered a cost advan-\ntage to employers in purchasing directly, but\nthis was later eliminated in order to increase\nbrokers' cooperation with the alliance.\nStudy Data And Methods\nWe examined employment-based coverage\nfor alliance and nonalliance participants in\nthe three states using data from the 1997\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)\nEmployer Health Insurance Survey. To inves-\ntigate effects of the alliance on the small-\ngroup market as a whole, we measured\nin the three states and contrasted these with\nchanges occurring in the rest of the nation.\nOur estimates for 1993 come from the Na-\ntional Employer Health Insurance Survey\n(NEHIS). The two surveys were comparable\nin sample and measurement design, admini-\nstration, and processing. General background\non these two surveys has appeared else-\nwhere.18 The following details the specific fea-\ntures unique to the present study.\nn Sample. The sample frame for both sur-\nveys was the Dun's Market Identifiers national\ncensus of employment establishments.19 The\nRWJF sample was supplemented by a list\nsample of participants in the three states' alli-\nances. The alliance frame in each state was\nstratified by geography and establishment\nsize; within each state, the alliance sample\nwas selected in proportion to the nonalliance\nsample in the same stratum.20\nThe focus of our analysis is small employ-\ners: establishments of firms with fifty or fewer\nemployees. The number of small employers\ncluded 1,433 small employers in California,\nAmong these, 161 were selected from the list of\nparticipants in the California HIPC, 87 from\nthe Health Connections list, and 149 from the\nFlorida CHPA's list of participants.

We measured alliance\nparticipation rates and the types of insurance\nchoices offered by alliance and nonalliance\ntails about each insurance plan offered were\ncollected as part of the interview. For estab-\nlishments that were selected from the alliance\nlists, however, the plan characteristics were\nmeasured from administrative records. Em-\nployers were classified as offering a choice of\nplans if they offered two or more plans,\nwhether of the same or different types and\nwhether through the same or different carri-\ners. We also examined the number of employ-\ners offering more than one type of health in-\nsurance plan--defined as an HMO, POS, PPO,\nor indemnity plan.22 For nonalliance partici-\npants, plan types were classified based on the\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The\npremiums were adjusted for actuarial differ-\nences in the benefits of different plans.23 We\ncomputed an average single premium for the\nestablishment as the enrollee-weighted aver-\nage for all of the separate plans offered.\nAll small employers in the three states\nwere asked whether they were aware of the\nalliance operating in their state.24 They also\nwere asked whether the company consulted\nan agent or broker to help in evaluating differ-\nent plans. Alliance participants consulting\nbrokers were asked whether the broker had\nprovided information about plans outside of\nthe alliance; nonparticipants were asked\nwhether their broker informed them about al-\nliance plans.\nWe estimated the alliances' spillover effect\non the small-group market in each of the three\nstates by examining the change between 1993\nand 1997 in the share of employers offering\ninsurance, the share offering a choice of plans,\nand premiums for single coverage. This base-\nline period was prior to the emergence of the\nConnecticut and Florida alliances. The Cali-\nfornia alliance started issuing policies in July\nof that year, so it was unlikely to have greatly\naffected the small-group market.\nWe used multivariate regression methods\nto control for changes over the period in the\ncomposition of small employers (industry,\nsize, and business age composition), in the\ncharacteristics of their employees (share of\nunion, part-time, and low-wage workers),\nand the nature of small-group insurance mar-\nket reforms in place in the state (guaranteed\nissue for some or all products, and prohibition\nagainst using health differences in pricing\nplans). To control for unmeasured temporal\nchange that might affect the small-group mar-\nket, we compared the change in market char-\nacteristics over time in each of the three states\nwith that in the small-group market in the\nrest of the nation.25 This is usually called a\n\"difference-in-difference estimate.\" Our\ndifference-in-difference estimate for each\nstate accounted for any difference between\neach alliance state and the rest of the nation in\nthe changing composition of small employers.\nThe difference-in-difference estimate ac-\ncounts for state-invariant temporal factors;\nhowever, there may have been state-specific\nchanges over time unrelated to regulations\nthat could bias this comparison. To control\nfor state-specific temporal effects, we as-\nsumed that these factors affected medium-\nployers in the state. We then compared the\nchange in outcomes over time between small\nand medium-size employers in each of the\nthree alliance states with the change between\nsmall and medium-size employers in the rest\nof the nation. This is referred to as a \"differ-\nence-in-difference-in-difference\" estimate.26\nResults\nn Alliance participation. Each alliance had a\nvery low share of its state's small-group mar-\nket (Exhibit 1). Among small employers that\noffered insurance as a benefit, only 2\u00ad6 per-\ncent purchased it through the alliance. Em-\nployers that had offered insurance for two\nyears or fewer were not significantly more\nlikely to purchase through the alliance than\nwere employers that had offered insurance\nlonger. Therefore, the alliances do not seem to\nhave contributed to attracting new employers\nto offer insurance. We also did not find differ-\nences in the alliance market shares among\nvery small employers (ten or fewer workers)\nand other small employers (not shown).27\nAwareness of the alliance varied consider-\nably across the three states (Exhibit 1). Only\nabout 40 percent of small businesses in Cali-\nfornia that offered insurance reported that\nthey had heard about the California HIPC. In\ncontrast, more than three-quarters of small\nemployers in Connecticut that offered insur-\nance were aware of its alliance.28 Even among\nthose knowledgeable about the alliance, how-\never, its market share did not exceed 10 per-\ncent in any state.\nThe vast majority of all small businesses\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In contrast, three-\nquarters or more of alliance participants were\npresented with information about one or\nmore nonalliance insurance plan options.\nSelected characteristics of workers that\nare related to risk--sex, age, and earnings--\ndid not differ between businesses that did and\ndid not participate in the alliance (Exhibit 2).\nThis suggests that alliances have not attracted\ngroups of greater or less health risk than the\nbroader small-group market.\nn Choice of plans. Providing small em-\nployers with both the ability and a simple\nmeans to offer a choice of plans is widely cited\nas alliances' strongest selling point. Many em-\nployers must offer a choice if they are to par-\nticipate. Thus, it is not surprising to find that\nmost employers in the alliance offered a\nchoice, whereas few other small employers\ndid so (Exhibit 3). Moreover, employees in a\nsubstantial fraction of employer groups in the\nalliance exercised choice by enrolling in more\nthan one of the offered plans. We observe this\nexercise of choice in a large number of groups,\neven though the small size of many of them\nSmall Employers In Three States Participating In And Aware Of Alliance, 1997\nAll employers\nParticipate in alliance 1% 3% 2%\nEmployers offering insurance\nParticipate in alliance\nParticipate (have offered insurance 2 years or fewer)\nAware of alliance\nParticipate, if aware of alliance\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nNOTE: Small employers are establishments of firms with fifty or fewer employees.\nCharacteristics Of Small Establishments In Three States Offering Insurance That Do\nAnd Do Not Purchase Through An Alliance, 1997\nPercent of establishments\nAgent helped evaluate options\nInformed of nonalliance/alliance\noption by agent if use agent\nPercent of firm employees\nFemale\nper year\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This suggests that employ-\nees have heterogeneous preferences for insur-\nance that employers cannot fully accommodate\nby offering a single insurance plan.\nThe choice offered by the alliance typically\nprovided access to different types of plans\n(HMO, PPO, and POS) and therefore with ac-\ncess to options about restrictions on choice of\nproviders.30 In many groups, employees made\ndifferent enrollment choices between plan-\ntype options, which is further evidence that\nchoice provided value to employees.\nParticipation in an alliance greatly in-\ncreased employees' opportunity to enroll in an\nHMO. Access to HMOs was nearly universal\nfor alliance participants, and a large fraction\nof these groups had one or more employees\nwho elected the HMO option. In contrast, the\nnumber of nonalliance employers offering an\nHMO ranged between 43 percent and 57 per-\ncent in the three states. The alliance may have\nbeen a vehicle for small employers to move\nmore rapidly to HMOs while still providing\nemployees who wished a broader choice of\nproviders to pick an alternative type of plan.\nEnrollment in HMOs among employees in\nparticipating businesses was about twenty-\nfive to thirty-three percentage points higher\nthan enrollment among other employees (not\nshown).\nn Cost. Premiums for plans purchased in\nthe California alliance were significantly\nlower than were premiums for plans offering\ncomparable benefits purchased outside of the\nalliance, as has been found in other studies\naddressing this period (Exhibit 4).31 In con-\ntrast, the alliances in the other two states ap-\nPercentage Of Establishments In Three States Offering And Selecting A Choice Of\nMultiple plans\nGroups offering\nGroups selecting\nMultiple plan types\nGroups offering\nGroups selecting\nGroups offering\nGroups selecting\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nNOTES: \"Groups selecting\" indicates that individuals within the group enrolled in different plans, different plan types, or a health\nmaintenance organization (HMO). \"Multiple plan types\" includes more than one of the following: HMO, point-of-service (POS),\npreferred provider organization (PPO), and indemnity.\nActuarially Adjusted Premiums For Employee-Only Coverage For Alliance Participants\nAnd Nonparticipants In Three States, 1997\nHMO\nSOURCE: 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.\nNOTES: HMO is health maintenance organization.

There\nwas no statistically significant difference in\nmonthly premiums for employee coverage\nwhether purchased in or outside of the alli-\nance in Connecticut or Florida.\nn Competitive effects on the market.\nThere is little evidence that any of the three\nalliances had broader effects on the small-\ngroup market in their state.

Changes\nin offer rates in the three states also did not\ndiffer significantly from those in the rest of the\nnation (the \"difference-in-difference\" meas-\nure). Again, even the direction of change in\nCalifornia and Connecticut compared with\nchanges occurring in the nation does not indi-\ncate that the alliance increased the availability\nof insurance to workers in small businesses.\nChange In Characteristics Of The Small-Group Market In Three States, 1993 And\n1997, And Contrast With Change In The Rest Of The Nation\nPercent offering insurance\n(difference-in-difference)\nchange for rest of nation\nPercent of offerers offering multiple plans\n(difference-in-difference)\nchange for rest of nation\nPremium for employee-only coverage\n(difference-in-difference)\nchange for rest of nation\n(difference-in-difference-in-difference) 5 \u00ad4 \u00ad17\nSOURCES: National Employer Health Insurance Survey (1993); and 1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Employer Health\nInsurance Survey.\nNOTES: Adjusted 1993 value is adjusted to 1997 characteristics of the state's employers, employees, and group insurance\nreforms.

This controls for state-\nspecific changes over time that affect both\nsmall and mid-size employers. This change\nmeasure is also small in magnitude and sug-\ngests that the alliance did not lead to an ex-\npansion in coverage.\nThe results in Exhibit 5 also do not sup-\nport the hypothesis that alliances led to more\nchoice in the broad market for small employ-\ners. The three measures of change are typically\nsmall and of inconsistent sign. The only statis-\ntically significant change is the increase in\nchoice in Florida, and this change is also sig-\nnificantly greater than the increase in choice\noffered in the small-group market nationally\n(the difference-in-difference estimate). How-\never, this appears to be a trend occurring in\nthe state rather than a factor attributable to\nthe alliance, as evidenced by a negative (al-\nthough insignificant) sign for the difference-\nin-difference-in-difference measure.\nSimilarly, alliances do not appear to have\nled to increased price competition in any of\nthe three states. Changes in premiums for em-\nployee-only coverage in the small-group mar-\nket in these states tended to mirror trends\nnationally--as seen by the small and insignifi-\ncant difference-in-difference measures.\nDiscussion\nWe hark back to the question posed in our\ntitle: \"Have alliances increased coverage?\" The\nanswer is no--at least, not in the states and\ntime periods we studied, which contain the\nthree largest small-group alliances imple-\nmented to date. These alliances encompass a\nrange of models, including public and private\nsponsorship. Therefore, governance does not\nappear to be a factor in this conclusion.\nWhat, then, prevented these alliances from\ncontributing to expanded coverage? Except\nfor California, they did not offer insurance at\nprices lower than those for comparable prod-\nucts in the broader market. The Florida and\nConnecticut alliances were prohibited by law\nfrom doing so. The California alliance aggres-\nsively negotiated rates with plans, and plans\nwere not permitted to offer lower prices out-\nside of the alliance. Despite the apparent price\nadvantage in the California alliance, few em-\nployers chose to participate. We believe that\nthis reflects the alliances' initial failure to ap-\npreciate the way in which most smaller busi-\nnesses purchase insurance. Many small em-\nployers rely heavily on their insurance agents\nfor advice, and the alliance failed to obtain the\nfull cooperation of brokers. Brokers' resis-\ntance was also a problem confronting the Flor-\nida alliance, as evidenced by the infrequency\nwith which brokers presented the alliance op-\ntions to customers in these states. Hence, their\ngrowth was limited.\nIn contrast, the Connecticut alliance en-\ndeavored to develop good relationships with\nagents and established an agent advisory\nboard to do so. We see evidence of greater\ncooperation by agents in presenting the alli-\nance in Connecticut. Nonetheless, with a\nproduct that was not less costly, the Con-\nnecticut alliance captured only a slightly\ngreater market share than did the others we\nstudied.\nAlliances, not having achieved significant\nmarket penetration, did not induce enough\ncompetitive pressure on the outside market to\nachieve the hoped-for spillover effects on\nprices. Moreover, low market penetration\nmakes continued participation in the alli-\nances less attractive to insurers, thereby\nthreatening the alliances' long-term viability.\nWithdrawal of plans is a problem that has\nconfronted the California and Florida alli-\nances and a factor that has led to the closing of\nthe Florida alliance altogether.\nWe rephrase our question to ask, \"Can alli-\nances increase coverage?\" What would con-\nstitute a more favorable set of circumstances?\nThe ability to engage in selective contracting\nis a necessary condition to offering lower\nprices, but it is unlikely to be sufficient to\nexpand coverage if alliances cannot attract\ngreater market share. Growth might be faster\nand last longer with full broker cooperation.\nElliott Wicks and colleagues suggest a\nH E A L T H T R A C K I N G : M A R K E T W A T C H\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

However, without substan-\ntial subsidy support to enhance employees'\ndemand for coverage, major coverage expan-\nsion seems unlikely. Most states that intro-\nduced alliances did so during debate about\nnational health care reform and expected that\nsubsidies or mandates would be a component\nof reform. Thus, they did not expect alliances\nalone to solve the problem of the uninsured.\nAlthough we conclude that voluntary alli-\nances are unlikely to expand coverage in the\nsmall-group market, they have produced de-\nmonstrable benefits to employers that partici-\npate. Their employees have much greater\nchoice in the number and types of plans avail-\nable to them and take advantage of this\nchoice. Alliance participants also moved to\nmanaged care more rapidly than did other\nsmall groups. This may have allowed partici-\npating employers to reap the cost savings af-\nforded by managed care earlier than their coun-\nterparts in the broader market, and without the\ndisadvantage of restrictingallof theiremployees\nto a single highly managed care option.\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).\nAny views expressed herein are solely those of the\nauthors and no endorsement by the RWJF, the\nNCHS, or RAND is intended or should be inferred.\nThe authors thank Linda Andrews, Roald Euller,\nand Ellen Harrison for their efforts in preparing the\nsurvey data files on which this paper is based.

Buchmueller, \"Managed\nCompetition in California's Small-Group Insur-\nance Market,\" Health Affairs (Mar/Apr 1997):\nPlan of California.\" For Florida, see Lazarus and\nAssociates, FloridaSmall Group Reform; and Wicks\net al., Barriers.\n10.

The\nCBIA has sponsored pooled purchasing of life\nand health insurance for a wider range of em-\nployer sizes since 1946. The Florida alliance was\nclosed in summer 2000. In an earlier study we\nexamined a much broader set of pooled purchas-\ning arrangements for firms of all sizes, in con-\ntrast to the present study, which is limited to\nsmall businesses participating in three specific\nalliances. See S.H. Long and M.S. Marquis,\n\"Pooled Purchasing: Who Are the Players?\"\n17. The descriptive information that follows is\nbased on our own direct contact with the alli-\nances and on several references, including the\nInstitute for Health Policy Solutions Web site,\nihps.org/chpglist.html (all); Ross, \"Health Insur-\nance Purchasing Cooperatives\"(CA, FL); Wicks\net al., Barriers (CA, FL); and Yegian et al., \"The\nHealth Insurance Plan of California.\"\n18. A summary is found in M.S. Marquis and S.H.\nLong, \"Trends in Managed Care and Managed\nvey, see 1997 Employer Health Insurance Survey: Final\nMethodology Report (Research Triangle Park, N.C.:\nResearch Triangle Institute, 1998); and P.\nKemper et al., \"The Design of the Community\nTracking Study: A Longitudinal Study of Health\nSystem Change and Its Effects on People,\" Inquiry\nNEHIS, see A.J. Moss, Plan and Operation of the\nNational Employer Health Insurance Survey\n(Hyattsville, Md.: National Center for Health\n19. The sample frame included employers with at\nleast one employee; self-employed individuals\nwith no employees were excluded.\nprobability of sampling from multiple frames\n(the Dun's list and the alliance list) for alliance\nparticipants.\n21. Participation rates are for groups with 1\u00ad50 em-\nployees. The Florida alliance was also open to\nself-employed individuals with no employees,\nwhich comprised a substantial share of partici-\npants. They are excluded from our measures.\n22. The alliances offered indemnity plans to out-of-\nstate employees only; however, many non-\nalliance participants offered indemnity plans.\n23. The actuarial value is the ratio of the expected\nplan benefit payments to the expenditures for a\nstandardized population.\n24. The question was, \"Was your company aware\nthat as a small employer it could purchase health\ninsurance coverage for employees through the\n[relevant alliance]?\"\n25. This includes medical cost inflation. The premi-\neral increases in price, which therefore would be\nrepresented in the simple change for each alli-\nance state but is controlled for in the difference-\nin-difference estimate. It also includes any\nchanges in the generosity of plans over time. The\npremiums in our time-series analysis are not ad-\njusted for actuarial differences in plans because\nwe do not have actuarial values for the 1993\nplans. Therefore, we assume that changes in ac-\ntuarial values that occur over time are similar\nnationwide.\n26. For details on the regression model, e-mail the\nauthors: <long@rand.org> and <susanm@rand.\norg.>\n27. Others have reported that the Florida alliance\ndid attract a large number of \"microgroups\" with\none or two persons to the group insurance mar-\nket that previously would not have been able to\nparticipate in the group insurance market. See,\nfor example, M.A. Hall and E. Wicks, \"An Evalu-\nation of Florida's Small-Group Health Insurance\nReform Laws\" (Winston-Salem, N.C.: Wake\nForest University School of Medicine, 1999). Our\nsurvey did not include the self-employed with no\nemployees, however, which comprise the one-\nperson groups.\n28. The CBIA sold health insurance to trade associa-\ntion members for many years prior to estab-\nlishing the Health Connections alliance for small\nbusinesses. It is possible that some small em-\nployers in Connecticut were aware of the asso-\nciation plan and so reported awareness of the\nalliance.\n29. In Connecticut and Florida, alliance participants\nare required to purchase through an agent or\nbroker. Reported use of a broker by alliance par-\nticipants in these states may be less than 100\npercent if the survey responses reflect use of a\nbroker to help evaluate options, rather than sim-\nply who sold the product.\n30. In the period of our study, the California alliance\nincluded HMO, PPO, and POS options. How-\never, subsequently all PPOs and most POS plans\nwithdrew. The Florida alliance included HMO\nand PPO plans, whereas the Connecticut alli-\nance offered a choice among several HMO and\nPOS plans.\n31. Yegian et al., \"The Health Insurance Plan of Cali-\nfornia\"; and Buchmueller, \"Managed Competi-\ntion.\"\n32. The adjusted values are predicted values from\nthe multivariate regression for employers with\nthe characteristics of those in the state in 1997\nand for market reform characteristics set to the\nstate's 1997 values, as if they were observed in the\nyear in question.\n33.
