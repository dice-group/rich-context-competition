In this study, 143 students participated in a\ntwo-step interview study in which they spoke about their experiences on either seeing a ghost author doing the research\nof someone else in exchange of money or they themselves being a ghost author. In all, 29 students said that they had done\nit once or so. The in-depth interviews with these 29 students showed how the plagiarism industry works in Iran, who the\ncustomers are, how they find each other, and so on.\n",

Although the bulk of\nresearch into plagiarism as academic misconduct has been\ncarried out in English-speaking nations (e.g., Australia, the\nUnited States), studies have now been emerging, document-\ning this transgression in many countries across the world.\nOne country that has received some attention in recent years\nis Iran, a nation that is experiencing significant academic and\nscientific growth.\nIran is an Islamic republic with a population of about 76\nmillion. When the Islamic Revolution happened in 1979, there\nstudents (Sedighi, 2014). At the professional level, there are\nmore than 55,000 faculty members with a PhD working at\nIranian academic institutes (Sedighi, 2014). Also, many doc-\ntoral-level students will be looking for new teaching and\nresearch positions, plus some of the several thousand students\ncurrently studying outside Iran (Moslemi Naeini, 2013) who\nwill likely return to Iran. The number of tertiary academic\ndemics in the pipeline and a faltering economic situation, it is\nlikely that additional academic positions necessary to meet the\nneeds of the country will not be created. Thus, securing an\nacademic position already is increasingly competitive and will\nlikely become even more so in the near future. An additional\ncomplication is that few international students enroll in the\nIranian universities. So, the universities may have to lower\ntheir admissions criteria to enroll more students and survive.\nBut, even with lower academic standards, students in the\nhumanities will still need to prepare term papers and write the-\nses. However, if some of these students lack proper academic\nskills, how will they be able to complete their assignments? In\naddition, one has to wonder how all of those unemployed PhD\nor MA graduates will be able to make a living.\nIn this article, we study what we call the \"plagiarism\nindustry\" in Iran. We have interviewed a group of enterpris-\ning students who, at the time of the interviews, were earning\na living, or had done so in the past, by writing other students'\nterm papers and theses. The qualitative data obtained have\nprovided us with insights that reveal the complexities of this\nplagiarism industry and offer clues about the causes, effects,\nand the economic realities that underlie this activity. But\nfirst, we will examine the state of plagiarism in Iran accord-\ning to the available literature.\nPlagiarism in Iran\nOver the past decades, Iran has had such a sharp increase in\nscience production that it was placed among the 31 countries\n1University of Tehran, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nEhsan Shahghasemi, Faculty of World Studies, University of Tehran, North\nEmail: shahghasemi@ut.ac.ir\nConfessions of Academic Ghost Authors:\nThe Iranian Experience\nEhsan Shahghasemi1 and Manijeh Akhavan1\n Keywords\nsocial sciences, education, criminology, academics, students, educational measurement and assessment\n2 SAGE Open\nof the world that published the so-called \"top 1% most cited\npapers (Scopus\u00ae) and ranked 39 in the world, but their H\nindex (an index that estimates the importance and impact of\ncontributions by a scientist or a country) was 40, placing Iran\nin the 69th position. There are many factors contributing to\nthis relatively low citation rate, including the vicious cycle of\npoor methodology and plagiarism (Farrokhi, 2009).\nPlagiarism is not something special to Iran or even to our\ntime. But, as mentioned earlier, the extraordinary demand for\nhaving an academic certificate has convinced many people\nthat they can make a lot of money by selling academic ser-\nvices. In the most notable example, the late Ali Kordan, an\nally of the Iranian President, was fired from his job as\nMinister Interior in 2008 when he was found to have lied\nabout having received an honorary doctorate from Oxford\nUniversity (Burke, Tomlinson, & Coope, 2012). And in\n2009, Nature published an article with a peculiar title \"Iranian\nministers in plagiarism row,\" which was a reaction to a chain\nof scandals in which some academic journals found papers\nby some of the Iranian authorities were in fact plagiarized\nand were subsequently retracted (Butler, 2009). After that\nepisode, a group of researchers responded to the charges by\npointing out that much of the fraud has been perpetrated by\npoliticians, and not Iranian full-time academics (Bloch,\n2012). Moreover, in an effort to further combat the percep-\ntion that Iranian academics might in some way condone\nthese activities, some of the Iranian professors and research-\ners founded the weblog \"Professors Against Plagiarism.\"\nResearch on Plagiarism in Iran\nA number of studies have been carried out in Iran in an effort\nto examine the various parameters of plagiarism. For exam-\nple, Ojaghi, Keyvanara, Cheshmeh Sohrabi, and Papi (2011)\ncarried out a qualitative study on faculty members at\nUniversity of Esfahan, Iran, in which the authors sought the\nopinion of study participants regarding the main causes of\nplagiarism in Iran's academic community. The professors\nwho participated in this research identified two major vari-\nables as important in this respect. Internally, those who have\nbeen raised in families in which ethical conduct is regarded\nseriously were said to be less likely to plagiarize. In addition,\nparticipants felt that plagiarism is more likely to occur in a\nclimate in which such behavior is more common and less\nlikely to be met with criticism and punishment. With respect\nto the latter point, it is interesting to point out that Donald\nMcCabe, one of the most prominent authorities in academic\ndishonesty, has consistently found that one of the strongest\npredictors of academic dishonesty is the academic integrity\nclimate of an institution (McCabe, Trevino, & Butterfield,\n2001). That is, based on several studies using thousands of\nNorthAmerican students, these authors conclude that students\nare more likely to cheat if they believe that other students\nengage in this behavior and get away with it. Finally, Ojaghi\net al. also revealed that among their 21 participants, some\nadmitted that the PhD certificates of some current professors\nin the Iranian universities are not genuine.\nFealy, Biglari, and Pezeshkirad (2012) conducted a sur-\nvey on 225 graduate students in large public university in\nTehran in an effort to determine how these students viewed\nplagiarism. They found that most of the students had slightly\nunfavorable or neutral attitudes toward plagiarism. They also\nfound a significant difference between those who attended\narticle-writing courses and those who did not, in viewing\nplagiarism unethical. Their survey showed that only about\n40% of their respondents said they do not plagiarize, which\nmeans that the remaining 60% are overtly saying they resort\nto plagiarism to prepare their term papers. Similarly,\nfaculties and 30 majors at a different university and their\nresults revealed that fewer than half of the students would\nnot resort to plagiarism when they felt the need to do so,\nwhile more than a half of their respondents said that plagia-\nrism is common in their university. They also found that the\nnumber of male students who said they resorted to plagia-\nrism was significantly higher in comparison with that of\nfemale students. Based on their survey and other data, they\nconcluded that plagiarism is very common in Iran.\nIn one study, Amirkhani, Vahdat, and Khezrian (2010)\nconducted a survey on 250 students in a public university to\nsee whether there was any correlation between psychological\ncharacteristics and Internet plagiarism, and reported that\nextroversion, academic talent, and emotional stability are\namong the important factors preventing students from doing\nplagiarism on the Internet.\nGhost Writing as Alternative to\nPlagiarism\nAlthough most students who plagiarize seem to do so by tak-\ning textual material that is already freely available to them\nvia paper or online sources, a small percentage of them\n(about 5%) are known to have confederates produce the\nwork on their behalf or purchase the work via one of the\nmany online essay writing services or \"paper mills\" that have\nemerged over the years (Scanlon & Neumann, 2002). In\nview of the economic realities facing Iran and given the cur-\nrent academic climate at many Iranian academic institutions,\nwe wanted to examine the problem of plagiarism from the\nperspective of those who offer term paper and essay services\nor seek such services in Iran. For this purpose, we carried out\ninformal interviews with a sample of students ranging from\nthose holding Baccalaureate degrees to those holding PhD\ndegrees. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the\nextent of this particular type of plagiarism in Iran and the\nconditions that give rise to this behavior.\nShahghasemi and Akhavan 3\nMethod\nSubjects\nA convenience sample consisted of 143 BA, MA, and PhD\nstudents in humanities from a major Iranian University par-\nticipated in this research (see Table 1). Age data were not\ncollected.\nMaterials\nAll respondents were asked the following two questions\n(\"Have you ever heard a classmate of yours paid somebody\nelse to do his or her homework/final paper?\" and \"Have you\never worked on a project of somebody else in exchange of\nmoney?\"). If they answered in the affirmative, they were\nthen interviewed.\nProcedure\nGiven the sensitive nature of the topic, we knew from the\nbeginning that getting students to reveal their true opinions\nand actual practices regarding their academic writing would\nbe no easy task. After all, even after assuring them of the\nanonymity of their responses, people are probably not going\nto be completely open about their unethical behaviors if they\nknow that their responses are going to be presented in a\npaper. Therefore, part of the inclusion criteria for the inter-\nview was based on a subjective determination on the part of\nthe interviewers (E.S. and S.A.) that the respondents were\nbeing honest. Thus, during a period of 18 months from May\nferent majors of humanities. These majors included social\nsciences, communication studies, management, theology,\npolitical relations, psychology, regional studies, and so on.\nBecause of the sensitivity of the subject, most of the inter-\nviews were carried out during social chats in a friendly atmo-\nsphere, so the interviewees, all of whom were known to the\ninterviewers, were not aware of the purpose of chats. Only in\ncases in which there was a mutual trust between interviewee\nand interviewer, the participant was informed about the\nnature of conversation. Those who reported that they did not\nwrite papers or theses for other students were asked only two\nquestions. But, those who said that their job was or is to do\nother people's academic work were interviewed in greater\ndepth.\nResults and Discussion\nIn this section, we present a summary of the responses to\neach of the questions and use selected participant responses\nto illustrate some of the findings.\nIn response to the question, \"Have you ever heard a\nclassmate of yours paid somebody else to do his or her\nThis figure means that 81% of participants reported to have\nwitnessed somebody in their academic circle paying some-\nbody else to do his or her scientific assignment. All 100% of\nthe PhD students, 88% of MA students, and 72% of BA stu-\ndents in humanities said that they have witnessed a case.\nSome of the participants elaborated the instances of such\ntransactions. For example, a MA-level female, age 25,\nreported,\nI know a former classmate of mine who was divorced and got\nmoney from her ex-husband. She said she does not bother\nherself doing these \"stupid things.\" She said in each semester\nshe employs the best people to write her an original paper. She\nsaid sometimes, just a smile would be enough.\nA female, PhD, age 32, commented, \"It is very common.\nI am wondering, did you not see many posters offering such\nservices on street walls?\" A 23-year-old female student in a\nBA program reported,\nAfriend of mine was in a terrible stress. She thought she couldn't\nwrite the article our rigorous professor expected. Therefore she\npaid a small stipend to a MA student and he wrote the paper. We\nthen found that this student had many similar papers which were\nsold to customers cheaply.\nIn response to the question, \"Have you ever worked on a\nproject of somebody else in exchange of money?\" a total of\n29 of the respondents answered affirmatively, and a majority\nof them were PhD students. All these respondents reported to\nhave prepared somebody else's assignment at least once (see\nTable 1. Number of Respondents by Sex and Level of Education.\nMale Female Total\nTable 2. Number and Percentage of Respondents Who Wrote\nAssignments for Others in Exchange for Money.\nYes Total Percent Total percent\nMA\nBA\n4 SAGE Open\nIt is noteworthy that only 6 of 76 (8%) of the female\nrespondents said \"yes\" to this question, suggesting that\nfemales are less likely to engage in these unethical academic\npractices, whereas 34% of male respondents reported to have\ndone so. Also, as noted above, it seems that those with more\neducation are more likely to engage in this activity, perhaps\nbecause they are expected to have better writing skills and be\nmore knowledgeable about the subjects that they are asked to\nwrite about. One other factor could be due to the fact that\nhigher levels of education are by nature associated with\nhigher age status, which means that the individual has more\nresponsibilities, and most of these responsibilities need\nmoney.\nThose who denied writing paper for money offered vari-\nous reasons for their reluctance to do so. For example, a\n29-year-old PhD male reported that\nthough I have had many such offers, I could never convince\nmyself writing for somebody else. I, like everybody else, prefer\nto be the sole owner of my work. If someone cannot write, he or\nshe can give up and go for some job else.\nA 19-year-old female BA student said,\nI am very busy and I cannot do my work the way I like. I have\nno time to do such thing . . . yes, if somebody offers me a good\npayment and I am sure of the ability of myself to do so, I may\nconsider it.\nAnother female, age 23, in a BA program said, \"I don't do\nit because it is robbery. It is as ugly as that. But people justify\nit for themselves.\" Similarly, a 19-year-old male BA student\ndid not think that the act was ethical: \"If it becomes a routine,\nyou will simply witness someone who is stupid becoming a\ntop student of our class just because he or she is rich and can\nafford to pay PhD students.\" Finally, a 31-year-old female\nPhD student who felt strongly against writing assignments\nfor other students said,\nNot only I have never done it, I push back every one who makes\nme such offers . . . yes, indeed I have had such offers, but I have\nnever accepted them. Everyone needs money, but at what price?\nI think it is better to steal money from the poor and not enter\nsuch a dirty job.\nFor the 29 students who claimed to have at least one time\ndone somebody else's work in exchange of money, we asked\nthem to provide details about different aspects of this activ-\nity, and what follows represents a summary of these\nfindings.\nRationale for Engaging in Ghost Authorship\nThe vast majority of the respondents justified their ghost\nwriting activities by claiming that they were in financial dis-\ntress or felt pressure to generate some additional income. The\nfollowing remarks by various respondents illustrate this\npoint. A 33-year-old male PhD student reported,\nWell, I am not from the capital and you know that the capital is\na wild city. Without money, I could barely eat. My family could\nnot afford to secure enough money for me. Therefore I did it five\nor six times.\nAccording to a 22-year-old male BA student, \"Every\nhuman being has a minimum of needs. I only do it when I am\nin financial pressure.\" A 25-year-old male MA student\nremarked,\nIt goes back to when I had to support my younger brother.\nActually, no one expected me to support him. But, I was the\nolder brother and I was naturally supposed to do so. It also gave\nme the opportunity to live on my own and therefore I helped my\nfamily to stay on their feet after the financial losses they\nexperienced at that time.\nOthers rationalized their actions in terms of professional\nstatus. For example, a 34-year-old male PhD student argued,\n\"I have spent my life to become a professional, but I cannot\nafford to buy a car. So I have to accept offers to write theses.\nThis is life; don't be stupid.\" A 28-year-old BA male\nremarked, \"I do this because I need money. This is very stu-\npid not to accept money. Without money, you are dead.\"\nWho Are the Customers?\nWe were interested in learning about the characteristics of\nthose who seek ghost writing services, and we, therefore,\nasked them to describe them in some detail. Their responses\nindicated that a large proportion of their customers were\nwealthier students who attended a nearby private university\nwith several branches in the Tehran area. Of course, not all\nthe student-customers were from that one university.\nMoreover, in some cases, the respondents indicated that\nsome of their customers were actual professors. Interestingly,\nseveral respondents indicated that they were approached by\nmany more female than male students. Some customers\ntended to be governmental managers who felt the need to\nfurther their studies to get to better qualify for a promotion or\nto simply ensure that they can maintain their current posi-\ntion. There was also the suggestion that as an increasing\nnumber of Iranians have advanced degrees, these govern-\nment managers feel somewhat intimidated by the prospect of\nhaving to work in a system in which many of their subordi-\nnates are better educated than their managers. The following\nresponses illustrate these trends. A 38-year-old male PhD\nstudent stated,\nThey are mainly from [. . .] University. They are wealthy. They\npay you well and they pay well for everything. But, they are not\njust from [. . .] university. There are other customers as well.\nMost of them are women who want to write their thesis. There\nShahghasemi and Akhavan 5\nare also men . . . They are mainly older than ordinary students. I\nthink they just came here to get a degree and they don't care for\nquality.\nA 32-year-old female PhD student reported that \"they are\nfrom many backgrounds. But because I don't work profes-\nsionally, my customers are mainly from my university and [.\n. .] University.\" Another female respondent, a 25-year-old\nMA student, stated the following:\nI only occasionally got such offers. Most of them are from my\nuniversity but I have also offers from [. . .] University and other\nacademic institutes. I am more comfortable working with\nwomen because they know me and I know them by nature. The\nother reason is that I am a girl and I cannot quarrel with men\nabout money. Given that there are enough requests coming from\nwomen, why should I bother myself quarreling with men?\nFinally, a 33-year-old male PhD student commented,\nI only work with [. . .] University students because I don't want\nmy friends and colleagues at my university to know about it.\nMoreover, their professors are not rigorous as ours. My\nexperience is that they accept everything the students email\nthem. Most of my customers are women.\nOne 32-year-old female PhD student reported that one of\nher customers was a college professor. She stated,\nFor example, I know a professor who likes to publish many\nacademic articles. He pays me well and I write the articles for\nhim. Sometimes he includes me as author, but at other times, he\nlists himself as sole author.\nHow They Find Each Other\nIn English-speaking countries, if a student wishes to pur-\nchase a term paper for use in a course, all she or he needs to\ndo is an Internet search for term papers, academic essays,\nand theses. A plethora of sites purport to have stocks of thou-\nsands of papers, which are sorted by topic. Many of these\nsites also offer custom-written papers, which students can\narrange to order from the privacy of their own home as long\nas she or he has an Internet connection and a credit card. Our\ncurrent sample of 29 ghost authors revealed a variety of dif-\nferent ways of promulgating and arranging for these services.\nFor example, a 32-year-old male PhD student stated,\nBoth [informal] social network and advertisements are\nimportant. I also have a liaison with corporations which are\nactive in the industry. They call me and give me the proposal. I\nwill tell them my price. Then they add 30% and share it with the\ncustomers. I like working for myself, indeed. But it is not\npossible to find all of the customers via social networks.\nThe above arrangements are similar to those described\nsome years ago by Witherspoon (1995) and more recently by\nThis job is illegal, and moreover, academia is a special\nplace in which plagiarism is harshly criticized. Yet, this busi-\nness needs both parties to get to know each other. Therefore,\nit seems that only those who are less professional in this busi-\nness accept jobs from the same institutes. More professional\npeople find their customers in other institutes. Examples\nfollow:\nOne 25-year-old female MA student reports that requests\nfor papers \". . . are mainly from the people whom I know, but\nin some cases I find them through shared friends. Sometimes,\nstudents from [. . .] University come to our faculty and try to\nfind the right person.\" Our research reveals that most of the\norders are facilitated by social network. But, for profession-\nals, advertising institutes are involved. They overtly adver-\ntise in faculties in every university. A 33-year-old male PhD\nstudent stated that \"women talk to each other more openly as\ncompared to men and so, most of them find me through their\nfriends.\" Another 33-year-old male PhD student said that\n\"they come to faculty and ask for help and the faculty mem-\nbers redirect them to you. Even now I have occasionally\nreceived these proposals.\" Finally, a 29 year-old male BA,\nsaid that he\nworked with a bunch of people. They give me the projects and I\ndo it. I have been told not to try to come in direct contact with\ncustomers; otherwise, they will dismiss me. I am contented with\nthe stipend and there is no reason for raising conflict of interest\ncomplains.\nOriginality and Quality\nWe tried to explore the degree of originality and the quality\nof the ghost-written works. Here, respondents' answers to\nour questions suggest that most of the ghost-written papers\nthey produce are not very original and not necessarily of\ngood quality. For example, a 32-year-old male PhD student\nstated the following:\nFrankly, I have dozens \"Reviews of Literature,\" \"Methodology\nsections,\" \"Results,\" etc. For each customer, I assemble the texts\nand it's done. After 6 months, you get to know professors and\nunderstand how to assemble the thesis in a way that he or she\napproves it. I don't even think that most of them read the thesis\nthoroughly. Generally, I write a MA thesis in a single day.\nThe approach to ghost writing of picking and choosing from\na collection of archived sections of papers was also men-\ntioned by a 34-year-old male PhD student in connection with\noffering his services to a university professor:\nWhen I was doing it for my professor, I did it brilliantly. I\nexpected him to at least include my name as a co-author. He paid\nme well but refused to include my name. Therefore, I didn't\nbother myself working hard for the next work. Also, I found that\nneither he nor somebody else doesn't read the articles critically.\nTherefore, I still do that whenever I am in need of money. I got\nsame money for less effort. For others, however, I don't take\n6 SAGE Open\nmuch time. I have many texts on my laptop. This is just a matter\nof mingling texts and selling them.\nOne theme that was repeated several times was the appar-\nent lack of evaluation of students' works by their professors.\nFor example, a 27-year-old male BA student revealed the\nfollowing:\nAt first I was very sensitive about the quality. Now, I don't care.\nLet me give you a wonderful example. You don't believe it. Four\nyears ago, when I was a BA student, I entered this job. I wrote a\nthesis for a MA student. It had been thoroughly copy-pasted\nwith slight modifications. The student paid my stipend and\ninvited me to attend his defense session. Amidst the discussions\non quality of his thesis, I browsed the thesis and with a great\nhorror found I had forgot to remove the "
