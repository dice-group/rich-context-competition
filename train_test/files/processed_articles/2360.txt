However,\nperinatologists and neonatologists are also interested in obesity\nbecause there is an emerging hypothesis that obesity may be due to\nmaternal and fetal (developmental) nutrition, developmental\nexposure to environmental chemicals or the interaction of\nnutrition and environmental exposures during development.16,17\nThe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nStudy of Early Child Care and Youth Development demonstrated that\nchildren with a BMI of>85th percentile as well as a BMI in the high-\nreference ranges are more likely than children with a BMI <50th\npercentile to continue to gain weight and reach overweight status by\nadolescence.18 The sample studied was drawn from middle class\nfamilies that were predominantly White. The objective of our study was\nto estimate the predictive value of earlier levels of BMI on later risk of\noverweight status (Xthe 85th percentile) and obesity (Xthe 95th\npercentile) during early adolescence in an urban, low socioeconomic\nstatus sample while controlling for variables that effect obesity and\noverweight status. The multi-site longitudinal study evaluating the\neffect of maternal lifestyle during pregnancy on childhood and\nadolescent outcome (Maternal Lifestyle Study) offered an opportunity\nto study risk for obesity in early childhood in this at-risk population.\nCorrespondence: Dr S Shankaran, Children's Hospital of Michigan, 3901 Beaubien\nE-mail:sshankar@med.wayne.edu\nwww.nature.com/jp\nMethods\nThe Maternal Lifestyle Study is performed at four sites\n(Brown University, University of Miami, University of Tennessee at\nMemphis and Wayne State University) in The Eunice Kennedy\nShriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nNeonatal Research Network with additional support from the\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse. The study was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board at each of the participating clinical\ncenters and informed consent was obtained before study initiation.\nThe recruitment and selection procedures have been described\npreviously.19 The children were born between May of 1993 and May\n(diagnosed by maternal self-report and meconium analysis of\ncocaine metabolites by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy)\nand 730 comparison group infants matched on race, gender and\ngestational age. Confidentiality regarding maternal substance use\nwas assured through each center's National Institute on Drug\nAbuse Certificate of Confidentiality. Children were evaluated on an\nannual basis from birth to the 11 year visit (to 2006). At each\nclinic visit, height was measured with the child standing without\nshoes, feet together on a stadiometer. Weight was measured using a\n2-Beam scale with children wearing light clothing (no shoes, no\nouter clothing and no items that could add weight such as keys,\nbelts or watches). The BMI was determined separately for boys and\ngirls at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and\nNational Center for Health Statistics Growth charts designed for use\nStatistical analyses\nChildren who were present for the 11 year visit and had at least two\nprevious visits at ages 1 through 11 years were included in the\nstudy. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk for\noverweight and obesity at 11 years were examined comparing the\nfrequency with which children did reach versus did not reach\nspecific BMI percentiles during the preschool year (2 to 4 years),\nearly elementary (5 to 7 years) and late elementary (8 to 10 years)\nvisit to the clinic. Logistic regression analysis controlled for\npredefined perinatal, childhood and sociodemographic variables\nknown to affect BMI. The maternal variables included maternal\nsubstance use, prepregnancy height and weight and race.4,21,22 The\ninfant variables included birth weight and gender.22 From the age\nof 6 years, information on physical activity, including hours of\nexercise, days of exercise in the past week and sport activities from\nthe child and parental interview were obtained using the Child\nHealth and Illness Profile. Information on the hours of watching\ntelevision (reflecting physical inactivity) was also obtained from the\ninterview of the child at 11 years. Information on diet was obtained\nfrom a 3-day food diary using the Nutri-Pro Data System. The\nsociodemographic variables included assessment of socioeconomic\nstatus, education, annual income, occupation and whether the\nfamily was living at the Federal Poverty Level.23,24 Only perinatal\nand neonatal variables were used at birth, whereas variables\nevaluating physical activity, inactivity, blood pressure and diet were\nexamined at the annual visits between 6 and 11 years of age.\nFamily history and parental blood pressure was available only at\nTwo sets of logistic regression models were conducted. The first set\nof models predicted whether children were overweight or obese at 11\nyears of age, based on whether they were 85th to 95th percentile\nor>95th percentile for weight at earlier ages. Models were developed\nseparately for boys and girls. The second set of models predicted\noverweight or obese at 11 years, based on BMI at earlier ages. These\nanalyses were conducted for the combined sample. The analyses\naccounted for clustering of children at the site level using the SUDAAN\nsoftware (Research Triangle Institute 2008, Research Triangle Park,\nNC, USA) for cluster-correlated data.\nResults\nThe study sample included 907 children seen at the 11 year visit.\nApproximately, 42% of the children were overweight or obese, 17%\nof the entire group was overweight and 25% were obese (Table 1).\nThe clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in Table 2.\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for weight, height and BMI by gender\nGender/age Weight, kg Height, cm BMI\nBoys\nGirls\nAbbreviation: BMI, body mass index.\nEarly predictors of adolescent obesity\nS Shankaran et al\nJournal of Perinatology\nAt 11 years, the mean\u00b1s.d. for weight for the boys was 44\u00b113 kg,\nwhereas that of the girls was 48\u00b116 kg.

Among the girls, 20% were\noverweight and 26% were obese.\nThe logistic regression model predicting BMI greater than 85th\npercentile based on prenatal, neonatal, 7 and 11 year factors is\nshown in Table 2. Higher maternal prepregnancy weight, higher\nbirth weight and watching 3 h or more of television at 7 years of\nage was associated with a higher risk of BMI>85th percentile at\n11 years of age, whereas male gender and less than a high school\nmaternal education were associated with a lower odds of being\noverweight or obese at 11 years of age.\nThe risk of being overweight or obese at 11 years of age, given\nthe number of times the BMI exceeded the 85th percentile or 50th\npercentile during the preschool, early elementary or late\nelementary years is shown in Table 3, following adjustment for\nmaternal, neonatal and childhood variables listed in the Table.\nChildren who wereX85th percentile at one time between 2 to 4\nyears of age had twice the risk for overweight status at 11 years.\nTable 2 Logistic regression model predicting BMI>85th percentile at 11 years\nVariable N % Adjusted OR 95% CI P-value\nPrenatal/neonatal\nRace\nMaternal education\nWatch TV on school days(Hours)\nHours exercise or play sports on school days\nWatch TV per day (Hours)\nDays play active games or sports\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; REF,\nreference category; SGA, small for gestational age.\nNote: Model accounts for clustering of children by site.

Between 5 and 7 years\nof age, if BMIX85th percentile was noted once, the risk for\nbecomingX85th percentile at 11 years was fivefold. The risk\nincreased by 72-fold if BMI was measuredX85th percentile for\nmore than two times. Between 8 and 10 years of age, if BMIX85th\npercentile occurred once, the risk for overweight status at 11 years\nwas increased by 26-fold. The risk increased by 352-fold if BMI was\nmeasuredX85th percentile for more than two times. After\ncontrolling for covariates, being overweight at previous visits was\nassociated with increased odds of being overweight at 11 years.\nOverweight status at 2 years was associated with odds ratio 4.5\nof becoming overweight at 11 years.\nThe relationship between being overweight or obese at 11 years\nof age and BMI at earlier ages is demonstrated in Figure 1. For\neach age, children were divided into 20 groups, based on their BMI\npercentiles. The sample sizes across the categories ranged from a\nlow of 3% to a high of 20% of the sample. Logistic regression\nmodels were computed to predict the probability of being overweight or\nobese at 11 years of age for each of the 20 groups at earlier ages. As\nnoted in the figure, children in the higher BMI categories at younger\nages had consistently higher probability of being overweight or obese at\n11 years of age. This relationship is strongest for the later ages as\nillustrated by the steepness of the curves.\nDiscussion\nIn this longitudinal secondary analysis of preexisting data\ninvolving 907 at-risk children aged 11 years we found an\nalarmingly high rate (42%) of overweight and obesity. The effect\nsize was greater for BMI measurements taken closer to 11 years.\nThis effect persisted after controlling for perinatal, childhood and\nsociodemographic variables that contribute to the risk of obesity\nand overweight status.\nIn the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study,\namong 6- to 11-year-old children, the prevalence of obesity was\nwere obese. This high rate may reflect the predominately inner city,\nlow socioeconomic status of the children in our study.23,24 Our\nfinding that higher BMI was associated with a higher maternal\nweight before pregnancy, higher birth weight, female gender and\nmore hours of watching television have been documented by other\ninvestigators.1,22,25 In our study we found there was a trend that\nparticipation in physical activity could be protective against overweight\nstatus (P\u00bc 0.09), a finding noted by other investigators.1 We did find\na relationship between low maternal education and low child BMI.\nRecently, van Rossem et al.26 evaluated 2954 Dutch children and\nfound that relative to children from mothers with the highest\neducational level, mean BMI s.d. scores was lower at 2 years in\nchildren with low, mid-low and mid-high educational level, and in the\nmid-low group at 3 years. They conclude that the inverse relationship\nbetween socioeconomic status and childhood overweight presumably\nemerges after age 3 years.\nWe evaluated the affect of prenatal substance abuse on the\nchild's BMI at 11 years of age and did not find any relationship.\nAlcohol use during pregnancy is associated with a negative affect on\nheight, weight and head circumference, whereas cocaine exposure has\nbeen associated with impaired growth in childhood.27,28,29 Smoking\nduring pregnancy has been associated with an increase BMI during\nearly childhood as well as adolescence.30,31\nThe findings of our study parallel those that of the Early\nChildcare and Youth Development longitudinal study in which it is\nwas shown that children with a BMI>85th percentile are more\nlikely than children whose BMI <50th percentile to continue to\ngain weight and reach overweight status by adolescence.18 However,\nour study specifically focuses on high-risk urban, low\nsocioeconomic status children, including those whose mothers had\nused cocaine, alcohol and tobacco during the pregnancy. Another\ndifference between our study and the Early Childcare Youth\nDevelopment Study is that our study included preterm infants and\nour study measured growth at more time points. Lastly, in our\nstudy we evaluated the affect of variables known to influence BMI\nincluding maternal, child and sociodemographic variables.\nThe strengths of our study include the large number of children\nwho were evaluated, the prospective nature of the evaluation and\nthe assessment of confounding variables that effect BMI. The\ndrawback of the study is that we did not have assessments of skin\nfold thickness, measurements of the waist-to-hip ratio or the waist-\nThe clinical implication of this study is that overweight and\nobesity in adolescence is preceded by increasing BMI in the\npreschool years. We emphasize that obesity in children is a huge\nproblem.

It is possible to prevent as well\nas treat obesity.1 Our study highlights this association by\ndemonstrating a trend for increased physical activity to be\nprotective, whereas sedentary habits such as television watching\nincreased the risk of obesity. The perinatal period and the period of\nadiposity rebound 16,17 have been identified as critical periods that\neffect weight gain for pediatric patients: in our study we have\nidentified the preschool years also as a time when rapid weight\ngain can affect adolescent obesity.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n"
