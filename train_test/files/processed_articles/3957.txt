Anticholinergics are used as\na premedication in oral or bronchial pro-\ncedures because they reduce mucosal\nsecretions and the resulting reflexive\nbronchospasms, thereby preventing vagus-\ninduced bradycardia and improving surgical\nvisibility.4\u00ad6 However, anticholinergics\ninhibit muscarinic acetylcholine receptors,\nexerting antimuscarinic actions such as dry\nmouth and fever. Thermoregulation is more\ndependent on sweating in children than in\nadults, and children may be more suscep-\ntible to higher body temperatures after\ninjection of anticholinergics.7\u00ad9\nDelayed discharge of paediatric patients\ndue to postsurgical fever is frequently\nobserved in patients anaesthetized with\nketamine and adjunctive anticholinergics.\nFever accounts for 4.7% of complications\nin paediatric outpatients after surgery,10 and\nmay be caused by underlying disease,\ndehydration after preoperative fasting, or\nmedication. Surgery is usually postponed in\npaediatric patients with fever or cold symp-\ntoms, reducing the likelihood that under-\nlying conditions cause fever in this patient\ngroup. Although dehydration after pre-\noperative fasting can cause fever,11 the fact\nthat body temperature was normal before\nsurgery suggests that fasting is unlikely to\nbe the cause of fever in these cases. Of the\nmedications used routinely in these patients\n(including Hartmann's solution, normal\nsaline, adjunctive anticholinergics, ketamine\nand anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs),\nanticholinergics alone are reported to cause\nfever as an adverse effects.7,8 Ketamine\nhas also been reported to cause fever, but\nthis is not generally regarded as an\nadverse event.12 The other listed medica-\ntions (fluid and anti-inflammatory drugs)\nare used to treat fever, and are not the\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the\nfever-causing effects of adjunctive anti-\ncholinergics in children under ambulatory\nanaesthesia using ketamine.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled, prospective study recruited\nsequential paediatric outpatients aged\n12 months \u00ad 8 years who were scheduled\nfor procedures requiring ketamine sedation\n(including v-tube insertion, simple incision\nfor cyst removal, and frenuloplasty of the\nat the Department of Anaesthesia and Pain\nMedicine, Inje University Ilsan Paik\nHospital, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.\nInclusion criteria were: (i) American Society\nof Anaesthesiologists class I14; (ii) surgery\nminimize variation due to body temperature\nfluctuations and duration of preoperative\nfasting). Patients who required endotracheal\nintubation due to respiratory failure during\nthe procedure and patients who received\nmedications other than ketamine were\nexcluded.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom the parents or guardians of the patients,\nand the study protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board of Inje University\nIlsan Paik Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, Republic\nof Korea.\nStudy design\nPatients were randomly assigned between\ntwo groups (using http://randomization.\ncom): glycopyrrolate- group (group G),\nand saline (control) group (group N;\nFigure 1). After randomization, a single\nresearcher (K.W.K.) prepared the study\ndrugs (0.005 mg/kg glycopyrrolate [Tabinul\ninjection 0.2 mg/ml; Hana Pharm Co. Ltd.,\nSeoul, Republic of Korea], or the same\nvolume of saline [placebo]) in a blinded\nmanner. Another researcher (M.H.H.) mea-\nsured the body temperature of the patient\nprior to surgery using a tympanic thermom-\nGmbH, Germany) three times in each ear,\nand recorded the highest value as the body\ntemperature for that patient. The second\nresearcher (M.H.H.) then administered the\nprepared study drugs. Ketamine (1 mg/kg\ninitial dose, 5\u00ad10 mg additional dose, intra-\nvenous bolus) was used for sedation, and no\nother drugs were administered until the end\nof the study. Oxygen was supplied via nasal\ncannula, blood pressure and oxygen satur-\nation were monitored, and heart rate\nwas monitored via electrocardiogram. The\nsecond researcher (M.H.H.), who was\nblinded to the experimental grouping of\nthe subjects, measured body temperature at\nThe quantity of oral secretion produced\nduring the procedure was recorded by a\nthird researcher (J.H.K.), using a Visual\nAnalogue Scale (VAS) by indicating a pos-\nition from 0 mm (no secretion) to 100 mm\n(maximum secretion); the distance from 0\n(in mm) was then measured by the first\nresearcher (K.W.K.). The fluid infusion rate\nwas increased when the body temperature of\nthe patient exceeded 37.8C, and antipyr-\netics were administered when fever contin-\nued after body temperature measurements\nwere completed. Fever was defined as body\ntemperature >37.8C at more than one\ntime point.\nFigure 1. Consort flow diagram for patient enrolment into a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate\nthe fever-causing effects of adjunctive anticholinergics in children under ambulatory anaesthesia using\nketamine.\nStatistical analyses\nA preliminary study with ten paediatric\npatients indicated that around 30% of\npatients receiving anticholinergics devel-\noped postoperative fever, compared with\n4.7% of the control group. The incidence of\na type I error was 0.05 and a type II error\npatients were required in each group (84\npatients in total).\nData were presented as n or mean \u00c6 SD.\nBetween group comparisons were made\nusing independent t-test, with repeated\nmeasures analysis of variance used to evalu-\nate between group differences in body tem-\nperature. All statistical analyses were\nfor Windows\u00d5 (MedCalc Software, Ostend,\nBelgium). P-values < 0.05 were considered\nto be statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study recruited a total of 84 patients,\nwho were randomized between group G\nand clinical characteristics of the patients are\nshown in Table 1. There were no significant\nbetween group differences in age, gender,\nweight, duration of surgery, ketamine dose\nor preoperative body temperature.

This finding could be regarded as\nclinically negligible because the overall mean\nbody temperature of both groups was 37C \u00ad\n37.5C, a small difference from the baseline\nbody temperature (37.0C), and requiring no\ntreatment. Higher body temperatures per-\nsisted until 90 min after surgery in patients\ntreated with anticholinergic drugs in the\ncurrent study, whereas temperatures in the\nplacebo group returned to baseline by 60 min\nafter surgery. Of clinical importance, how-\never, was the significantly higher incidence of\nfever in patients treated with anticholinergic\ndrugs than those in the placebo group.\nThe definition of fever used in the present\nstudy was a tympanic temperature of 37.8C.\nFever is generally defined as a rectal tempera-\nture of >38C, but the routine use of a rectal\nthermometer is challenging and tympanic\nthermometers are preferred. Temperatures\nmeasured using tympanic thermometers\nthan those measured using a rectal thermom-\neter.15,16 We used a declining body tempera-\nture <37.8C as one of our discharge criteria\nin order to ensure the safety of our patients.\nAs expected, the quantity of oral secretions\nwas significantly lower in the anticholinergic-\ntreated group than the placebo group,\nFigure 2.

Body temperature was measured tympanically before surgery\ny P < 0.05 vs control group at same time point; z P < 0.05 vs baseline in same group; repeated measures\nanalysis of variance.\nalthough there were no secretion-associated\ncomplications observed in any patient. The\nincreased amount of suction required to deal\nwith the greater volume of oral secretions in\nthe placebo group did not increase the dur-\nation of the procedure. The total volume of\nadministered fluid was higher in the antic-\nholinergic-treated group compared with the\nplacebo group, due to the increase in infusion\nof fluids when fever was present.\nThe effectiveness of adjunctive anticholin-\nergics prior to sedation is unclear, and rou-\ntine administration of anticholinergics in\nprocedures such as bronchoscopy has been\nviewed skeptically.17,18 Some recommend the\navoidance of adjunctive anticholinergics in\npaediatric patients,19 because of their limited\neffect on suppressing salivation while increas-\ning the risk of enhancing the adverse effects\nof ketamine.20 Adjunctive anticholinergics\nare recommended for the suppression of\nhypersalivation and for their antiemetic\neffect in ketamine sedation.21 To our know-\nledge, the only report of the relationship\nbetween adjunctive anticholinergics and fever\nis a study applying atropine to eyes prior to\nophthalmic examination.22 Our present find-\nings suggest that routine premedication with\nadjunctive anticholinergics should not be\nrecommended in paediatric patients receiving\nketamine sedation, because the increase in\nbody temperature outweighs any advantages\ngained from suppression of oral secretions\nduring surgery.\nThere were several limitations to our\nstudy. Various surgical procedures were\nincluded and there was no evaluation of the\nsurgical difficulties caused by oral secretions.\nMore informative data could be collected if\nprocedures that are sensitive to the amount of\noral secretion are studied, and if any surgical\ndifficulties are evaluated by the surgeon.\nIn conclusion, routine premedication\nwith adjunctive anticholinergics should not\nbe considered in paediatric patients receiv-\ning ketamine sedation due to the increased\nrisk of fever. Use of anticholinergics should\nbe limited to procedures that require a high\nlevel of secretion suppression.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
