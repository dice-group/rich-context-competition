For instance, women who\nexperience earlier menarche have their first pregnancy earlier and prefer more masculinized male voices. Early menarche may also\nlead to preferences for masculine faces, but no study has shown such a link. We therefore investigated the relationships between\npubertal timing, reproductive plans, sexual attitudes and behaviors, and masculinity preferences in nulliparous women aged 18\u00ad30\nfrom the United Kingdom (N \u00bc 10,793). We found that women who experienced earlier menarche reported a younger preferred\nage to have a first child and showed stronger masculinity preferences. This provides evidence that women experiencing early\nmenarche not only have children earlier but notably plan to have children earlier. Additionally, our findings provide evidence that\nage of menarche influences partner selection, which is instrumental for the implementation of reproductive strategies.\n",

Perrett1\n Keywords\nmenarche, puberty, masculinity, faces, preferences, reproduction\nIntroduction\nLife history theory proposes that individuals face a trade-off\nbetween effort spent on survival and effort spent on reproduc-\nreproductive effort, individuals must also balance mating and\nparenting effort (Chisholm et al., 1993). Much research on life\nhistory theory has focused on understanding how different\nreproductive strategies influence an individual's reproductive\nsuccess. For example, some individuals may pursue a quanti-\ntative reproductive strategy of having a greater number of chil-\ndren with a relatively low level of investment in each, while\nother individuals may pursue a qualitative reproductive strat-\negy of having fewer children with a relatively high level of\naddition to quantity versus quality, speed is also a factor in\nreproductive strategy. For instance, individuals who choose\nto have children can exercise a ``fast and early'' or a ``slow\nand late'' reproductive strategy (Draper & Harpending, 1982).\nAccording to life history theory, reproductive strategies\ndepend on both developmental and environmental factors and\ncan be adaptive (Belsky, Steinberg, & Draper, 1991; Hoier,\n2003). One developmental factor that has been identified as\ninfluential in life history trajectory is pubertal timing (Belsky\nassociated with early onset of ovulatory cycles (Vihko & Apter,\n1984). Even after menarche, women who experienced early\npubertal timing have been found to have higher estradiol levels\nas adolescents (Vihko & Apter, 1984) and up until early adult-\nhood (Apter, Reinila\n\u00a8, & Vihko, 1989; Bernstein, Pike, Ross, &\nResearch proposes that there is a complex relationship\nbetween exposure to adversity and psychosocial stress early\nin life and biological reactivity (Boyce & Ellis, 2005; Ellis,\n2004). For instance, girls with high psychosocial stress arising\nfrom father absence tend to experience earlier menarche than\ngirls whose fathers were present in their home (Doughty &\n1 School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews,\nScotland, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nCarlota Batres, School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of\nSt Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, KY169JP, Scotland, UK.\nEmail: jcb23@st-andrews.ac.uk\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nRodgers, 2000; Ellis, McFadyen-Ketchum, Dodge, Pettit, &\nearly father absence develop in a manner that speeds pubertal\nmaturation and accelerates onset of sexual activity, since they\nare exposed to an environment where male parental investment\nis unreliable. Indeed, research has shown that girls who expe-\nrience early menarche have romantic relationships at an earlier\nage, engage in sexual intercourse at an earlier age, and have\nunknown, however, whether women who experience menarche\nat an earlier age plan to have children earlier or whether they\nhave their first pregnancy earlier as a by-product of having\nromantic relationships and sexual intercourse at an earlier age.\nWe therefore aimed to investigate whether, in addition to their\nactual reproductive outcomes, age of menarche also influences\nwomen's reproductive plans. We predicted that women who\nreported an earlier age of menarche would also report a\nyounger preferred age to have a first child.\nIt has also been argued that speed of sexual development\ninfluences mate preferences because partner selection is instru-\nmental for the implementation of reproductive strategies\n(Cornwell et al., 2006). One preference that has been suggested\nto influence reproductive strategies is that for masculinity.\nThere is some evidence that masculinity is a cue to health as\nindicated by findings that males with higher levels of facial\nmasculinity are perceived to be healthier (Rhodes, Chan, Zeb-\nrowitz, & Simmons, 2003). More importantly, although the\nevidence is still debated (Rantala et al., 2013; Roberts, Bucha-\nnan, & Evans, 2004), men with masculine faces might actually\nbe healthier as measured by health histories and medical exam-\nMasculinity is also a cue to dominance (Batres, Re, &\nScott, Clark, Boothroyd, & Penton-Voak, 2013), since it sig-\nnals physical strength and fighting ability. For instance, when\nindividuals are asked to vote for someone to run their country\nin times of war, they select candidates with masculine faces\n(Little, Burriss, Jones, & Roberts, 2007). Masculine men may\nbe healthier or more dominant, enabling them to win in intra-\nsexual competitions, and as a result of successful competitions,\nthey may have greater access to resources, enabling them to\nmaintain a healthier physique and high status.\nAlong with the benefits associated with masculinity, there is\nevidence of certain costs associated with this trait. For instance,\nincreasing facial masculinity results in decreasing perceptions\nof warmth, cooperation, emotionality, honesty, and perceived\nquality as a parent (Perrett et al., 1998). Additionally, there is\nevidence for a link between masculinity and aggression, since\nmasculine faces are considered more threatening, coercive, vola-\ntile, and controlling (Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink, & Gram-\nmer, 2001). Such evidence supports the idea that women face a\ntrade-off, with preferences depending on the costs and the ben-\nefits of choosing a masculine partner. For example, masculinity\npreferences are higher when women are considering engaging in\nshort-term relationships (Little, Burt, Penton-Voak, & Perrett,\nMasculinity preferences are also influenced by individual\ndifferences. For instance, research has found a positive correla-\ntion between a woman's age, within fertile years, and prefer-\nences for masculinity in male faces (e.g., Little et al., 2001).\nAnother individual difference that has been suggested to influ-\nence masculinity preferences is age of puberty. Cornwell et al.\n(2006) predicted that women who mature earlier would have\nlearned to associate masculine characteristics with potential\nmates and would therefore prefer faces with higher levels of\nmasculinity. More specifically, girls who experience earlier\nmenarche are more likely to draw the attention of boys who\nare older and more physically mature (Gowen, Feldman, Diaz,\nearly attention from boys with more sexually mature charac-\nteristics may then result in early maturing girls preferring more\nmasculine partners (Cornwell et al., 2006).\nHoier (2003) did indeed find that women who experienced\nearlier menarche gave higher overall attractiveness ratings to\nmale faces when compared to women who experienced later\nmenarche. Cornwell et al. (2006), however, found no effect of\nmenarche age on facial masculinity preferences but did find\nthat women who had intercourse at an earlier age preferred\nmore masculine faces. The link between pubertal timing and\npartner preferences might not have been found in Cornwell\net al.'s (2006) study, since their sample consisted of only\n46 women. Furthermore, age of menarche varies depending\non country of origin (Pathak & Whittemore, 1992), a variable\nthat was not controlled for in Cornwell et al.'s (2006) study.\nPhysical stress in the environment, such as economic hardship\nand malnutrition, leads to a delay in puberty, since it is neces-\nsary for the individual to channel energy toward growth and\nsurvival rather than reproduction (Ellis & Garber, 2000; Sur-\nbey, 1998). Given that physical stress in the environment varies\ngreatly across countries, it is helpful to hold country of origin\nconstant when examining age of menarche. Indeed, some stud-\nies have found that average age of menarche does not even\noverlap between some countries (Bernstein et al., 1991). For\nexample, one study classified participants from the United\nStates as having menarche ``before age 12,'' ``at age 12,'' or\n``at age 13 and older,'' whereas participants from China were\nclassified as having menarche ``before age 15,'' ``at age 15,'' or\n``at age 16 and older'' (Bernstein et al., 1991). Such differences\nsuggest that country of origin should be held constant in order to\nbetter examine the influences of pubertal timing.\nAlthough Cornwell et al. (2006) did not find a link between\nage of menarche and facial masculinity preferences, Jones,\nBoothroyd, Feinberg, and DeBruine (2010) did find that\nwomen who experience earlier menarche prefer more mascu-\nlinized male voices. Moreover, research has found that\nwomen's preferences for men's facial and vocal masculinity\nare positively correlated (Feinberg, DeBruine, Jones, & Little,\n2008). We therefore aimed to investigate whether age of\nmenarche influences facial masculinity preferences in a large\nsample of women from the United Kingdom and predicted that\nwomen who reported early menarche would prefer more mas-\nculine male faces.\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nAge of menarche has also been linked with the number\nof partners wanted, with earlier puberty leading to a higher\nnumber of partners desired (Hoier, 2003). In addition, Smith\net al. (2009) found that women who prefer short-term rela-\ntionships have stronger preferences for masculine men.\ncate that women who undergo menarche at a younger age\nmay be more interested in short-term sexual relationships.\nSurprisingly, Hoier (2003) did not find a link between age\nof menarche and sociosexuality (i.e., willingness to engage\nin uncommitted sexual relationships). We therefore aimed to\nfurther investigate the relationship between age of menarche\nand women's sociosexual attitudes in a large sample of\nwomen. We predicted that women who reported an earlier\nage of menarche would report both a stronger sex drive and\na higher willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual\nrelationships.\nMethods\nMaterials\nMale and female university students aged 18\u00ad22 were photo-\ngraphed facing forward, under constant camera and lighting\nconditions, with neutral expressions, no adornments, and\nclosed mouths. These images were delineated with 189 points\nusing Psychomorph, a custom face-processing software\n(Tiddeman, Perrett, & Burt, 2001), and aligned to a standard\ninterpupillary distance (Rowland & Perrett, 1995). Seven\nmale composite images were created (each averaging three\noriginal male faces together). Masculinity prototypes were\nthen generated by separately averaging the female faces and\nthe male faces (for details, see Batres & Perrett, 2014). The\nseven composites were then transformed to create pairs\nusing +50% of the shape difference between the male and\nthe female prototypes while holding texture and color con-\nstant. This resulted in a total of seven pairs of male faces,\nwhere each pair was made up of a 50% feminized and a\n50% masculinized face shape.\nA questionnaire asked for the participant's sex, age, ethni-\ncity, sexual orientation, whether they already had children\n(``How many children do you have?''), their preferred age\nto have a first child (``What age would you like to have [or\nhave had] your first child?''), the age at which they had their\nfirst sexual intercourse (``About what age were you when you\nfirst had sexual intercourse?''), their age of menarche (``How\nold were you when you started puberty [when you started your\nfirst period]?''), their sex drive (on a scale from 1 \u00bc strongly\ndisagree to 7 \u00bc strongly agree, ``I have a strong sex drive''),\nand the three attitude questions from the revised sociosexual\norientation inventory (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; the average\nscore for these three questions was used in the analyses). The\nattitude questions were utilized since of the three facets of\nsociosexuality (i.e., behavior, attitude, and desire) attitude\ntoward sexual relationships is the best predictor of women's\npreferences in potential partners (Quist et al., 2012).\nParticipants and Procedures\nA total of 10,793 Caucasian nulliparous heterosexual women\nUnited Kingdom completed all questions of the study online\n(see Reimers, 2007 for details). Ethical criteria from the British\nBroadcasting Corporation (BBC) editorial policy and guide-\nlines were followed. Participants were first presented with the\nquestionnaire and instructed to skip any question that did not\napply to them (e.g., if they had not had sexual intercourse, then\nthey should skip the question regarding their age at first sexual\nintercourse) or any question to which they did not recall the\nanswer (e.g., if they did not remember the age at which they\nstarted their first period, then they should skip that question). It\nmust be noted that only participants who completed all ques-\ntions of the study were included in the data analyses, meaning\nthat the sample was restricted to women who were sexually\nactive and wanted to have children at some point. After the\nquestionnaire, participants were then presented with the seven\npairs of faces varying in masculinity, where one pair appeared\nat a time. The order of the pairs and which face was on the left/\nright were both randomized. Participants were instructed to\nselect which face they considered to be the most attractive.\nResults\nGiven that less than 5% of the sample reported age of menarche\nat 10 years or younger and 16 years or older, we winsorized\nthose responses into two categories. Using those categories,\n4.9% of women reported their age of menarche as 10 years\nage 15, and 2.3% reported age 16 or older. For all the analyses,\nmasculinity preferences were calculated by taking the propor-\ntion of masculine faces selected across the seven pairs. Partial\ncorrelations controlling for current age were conducted (see\nTable 1). There were significant positive correlations between\nage of menarche and both age of first sexual intercourse,\nsignificant negative correlations between age of menarche and\nwas no significant correlation between age of menarche and\nThe data were further analyzed using a two-step hierarchical\nregression analysis (dependent variable: masculinity prefer-\nence; first-step independent variable: current age; second-step\nindependent variables: age of menarche, preferred age to have a\nfirst child, age of first sexual intercourse, sex drive, and socio-\nsexual attitude).

This study also replicates the\nfinding that there is no link between age of menarche and\nsociosexuality (Hoier, 2003). Along with previous literature\n(Provost, Kormos, Kosakoski, & Quinsey, 2006), this study\nshows that sociosexuality is related to masculinity preferences,\nand since we found that early menarche is also related to mas-\nculinity preferences, we expected for earlier menarche to be\nrelated to a less restricted sociosexual attitude. Our study, how-\never, did not find this link, and, with such a large sample, it\nprovides strong evidence that there is no relationship between\nage of menarche and sociosexual attitudes. One possible expla-\nnation for this finding is that age of menarche may not relate to\nsociosexual attitudes but may relate to one or both of the two\nother dimensions of sociosexuality (i.e., behavior and desire).\nAs mentioned earlier, girls who experience earlier menarche\ndraw more attention from boys (Gowen et al., 2004; Magnus-\nson et al., 1985). Such increased levels of attention could mean\nthat women who experience menarche earlier may have similar\nsociosexual attitudes to women who experience menarche\nlater, but those with earlier menarche may simply engage in\nmore sociosexual behaviors as a consequence of having more\nopportunities to do so. This study only examined sociosexual\nattitudes, and therefore, future research would be needed in\norder to investigate the relationships between sociosexual\nbehaviors and desires with pubertal timing.\nOur results showed that even after controlling for other\nfactors known to influence masculinity preferences (e.g., socio-\nsexual attitude), women who experience earlier menarche\nprefer more masculine male faces. This suggests that develop-\nmental factors influence not only reproductive strategies but\nalso partner selection, which is instrumental for the\nimplementation of such strategies. Our findings support one\nexplanation proposed by Cornwell et al. (2006) in which girls\nwho experience early menarche may consider themselves to be\nof higher quality, given their social success through puberty,\nand therefore, these earlier maturing girls may in turn prefer\nhigher quality mates (i.e., more masculine). Alternatively, our\nfindings could also support a further explanation proposed by\nmaturing girls might have learned to associate masculinity with\ndesirable mates, since girls who experience earlier menarche\nare more likely to draw the attention from boys who are older\nand more physically mature (Gowen et al., 2004; Magnusson\net al., 1985). Additionally, girls who experience early\nmenarche are more likely to have engaged in sexual and roman-\ntic activity with older males and also receive more attention\nand positive feedback from older males (Prokopc\nThese early positive interactions with older males could lead\nearly maturing girls to develop a preference for masculine-\nlooking partners later on in life, since older males look more\nmasculine (Batres et al., 2015). Indeed, research has found that\nfacial attractiveness judgments in adulthood reflect the effects\nof visual exposure during critical periods of development\n(Perrett et al., 2002; Saxton, Little, DeBruine, Jones, &\nUpon further inspection, the significant relationship\nbetween age of menarche and masculinity preferences seems\nto be driven by women who experienced menarche at age 11.\nAs evidenced by Figure 1, masculinity preferences peak for\nthose women who reported age of menarche as 11. These find-\nings suggest that there might be something special about\nexperiencing menarche at that age. Indeed, at age 11, most girls\nin the United Kingdom transition from primary school, where\nthey are surrounded by younger boys, to secondary school,\nwhere they are surrounded by older boys. Thus, it appears that,\nin the United Kingdom, age 11 is a critical period during devel-\nopment that has long-lasting influences on partner preferences.\nIt would be interesting to examine the relationship between age\nof menarche and masculinity preferences in countries where\nthe transition between primary and secondary school falls at a\ndifferent age in order to further test the influence of being\nexposed to older boys during sexual maturation.\nOur results also provide new evidence that women who\nexperience menarche at an earlier age have a younger preferred\nage to have a first child than women who experience menarche\nat a later age. This relationship persisted even after controlling\nfor other factors. This suggests that women who experience\nearly pubertal timing not only have children earlier (Udry,\n1979) but notably plan to have children earlier. This distinction\nis important, as it provides evidence that women experiencing\nearlier menarche are planning to reproduce earlier, not simply\nhaving earlier pregnancies as a by-product of having romantic\nrelationships and sexual intercourse at an earlier age. Addition-\nally, it is important to note that, although statistically signifi-\ncant, several effect sizes in our regression analyses, including\nthe effect size of menarche age on preferred age to have a first\nchild, were statistically quite small. That said, our findings are\nBatres and Perrett 5\nof theoretical importance since they provide evidence that even\nafter many years, age of menarche still relates to our variables\nof interest (e.g., preferred age to have a first child).\nOne possible explanation for our findings is that levels of\nfemale reproductive hormones may underlie all of our variables\nof interest (i.e., age of menarche, preferred age to have a first\nchild, and masculinity preferences). Women who experience\nearlier menarche have higher estradiol levels as adolescents\n(Vihko & Apter, 1984) and even up until early adulthood\nmones have been found to influence feminine appearance\n(Jasien\n\u00b4ska, Ellison, & Thune, 2004), partner preferences (Fein-\nberg et al., 2012), and ideal number of children (Law-Smith\net al., 2012). For instance, women with higher levels of estro-\ngen are more likely to have feminine body shapes (Jasien\n\u00b4ska\nare rated as more attractive (Rhodes et al., 2003), and conse-\nquently, they may be able to choose masculine partners and\nenforce demands of paternal investment more successfully than\nless feminine women (Feinberg et al., 2012). Indeed, research\nhas found that women who rate themselves as more attractive\nare more attracted to masculinity (Feinberg et al., 2012; Little\net al., 2001). Estrogen levels have also been found to correlate\npositively with maternal tendencies (Law-Smith et al., 2012).\nGiven such findings, it is possible that levels of reproductive\nhormones may explain the links between early menarche and\nboth desire to have children at a younger age and preferences\nfor more masculine partners.\nIt would be beneficial for future studies to examine whether\nthe links between early menarche, preferred age to have a first\nchild, and masculinity preferences are also present in other\ncountries. As mentioned earlier, physical stress in the environ-\nment, such as economic hardship and malnutrition, leads to a\ndelay in puberty, since it is necessary for the individual to\nchannel energy toward growth and survival rather than repro-\nKingdom is a developed country with high gross national\nincome per capita and high life expectancy (United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, 2014); hence, it would be interesting\nto compare the influence of age of menarche in a country that\nhas low gross national income per capita and low life expec-\ntancy. Additionally, women from the United Kingdom have\naccess to free public health care and contraception, both of\nwhich may influence their reproductive strategies. It would\ntherefore be interesting to examine how age of menarche influ-\nences reproductive plans as well as sexual attitudes and beha-\nviors in countries where women do not have access to such\nservices. Lastly, even within the same country, women's envir-\nonments will vary, and therefore, future research would benefit\nfrom delving further into how physical stress in the environ-\nment (e.g., socioeconomic status) influences reproductive stra-\ntegies and mate preferences through pubertal timing.\n"
