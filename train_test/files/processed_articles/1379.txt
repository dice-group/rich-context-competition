Nelson Hopkins, MD\nBackground and Purpose--Although the short-term risks of stroke and types of stroke associated with isolated systolic\nhypertension (ISH) and borderline isolated systolic hypertension (BISH) have been described, the long-term effects of\nthese hypertensive conditions, particularly in younger individuals, are unclear. We performed this study to evaluate the\nlong-term risks of stroke, type of stroke, and predictors of stroke associated with ISH and BISH and how this risk\ncompares with that for persons with diastolic hypertension and normotension.\nMethods--We used the 20-year follow-up data for 12 344 adults aged 25 to 74 years who participated in the First National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey Follow-Up Study to determine the aforementioned risks. Blood pressure (BP)\nmeasurements of the participants were obtained during baseline evaluation. ISH was defined as systolic BP\ndiastolic BP 90 mm Hg. Diastolic hypertension was defined as a diastolic BP 90 mm Hg. Normotension was defined\nas systolic BP 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP 90 mm Hg. Incidence of stroke overall and incidence of ischemic stroke\nand intracerebral hemorrhage were determined from a review of hospital records and death certificates. Relative risk\n(RR) of stroke and stroke type in association with each hypertensive category was determined by Cox proportional\nhazards analysis after adjustment for potential confounding variables.\nhypertension (n3954). Normotension was observed in 6656 persons. After adjustment for differences in age, sex,\neducation, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking, a significantly higher RR\n1.8) than those with normotension. The risk was significantly higher for ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage in\npersons with ISH and BISH. Among the 1734 persons with either ISH or BISH, the risk of stroke was independently\nassociated with older age, diabetes mellitus, and systolic BP 180 mm Hg.\nConclusions--Increased risks for stroke, ischemic stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage were observed in patients with\nBISH, similar to those associated with ISH and diastolic hypertension. Future clinical trials are required to evaluate the\nKey Words: hypertension  intracerebral hemorrhage  stroke  stroke, ischemic\nAcommon belief among patients and some practitioners is\nthat elevated diastolic pressure is more important than\nelevated systolic pressure. However, recent evidence suggests\nthe importance of systolic blood pressure in determining the\nrisks of myocardial infarction and stroke.1\u00ad3 Two important\ncategories of systolic hypertension have been recognized,\nwhich include isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) and bor-\nderline isolated systolic hypertension (BISH). ISH is charac-\nterized by reduced vascular compliance, often in combination\nwith increased peripheral resistance. In absolute terms, ISH is\ndefined as an elevated systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg\nand a normal diastolic blood pressure (90 mm Hg).2,3 BISH\nwas introduced as a category of hypertension by the Joint\nNational Committee in 19854 and further emphasized in\ntreatment of high blood pressure. The entity was further\nstressed in the World Health Organization guidelines.7 BISH\nis defined as systolic blood pressure between 140 and\n159 mm Hg and normal diastolic blood pressure\n(90 mm Hg).4 The prevalence of systolic hypertension\nvaries, depending on the population screened. In the Hyper-\ntension Detection and Follow-Up Program,8 blood pressures\nFrom the Department of Neurosurgery, State University of New York at Buffalo (A.I.Q., M.F.K.S., L.R.G., L.N.H.), and Department of Neurology,\nOhio State University, Columbus (Y.M.M.).\nReprint requests to Adnan I.

Of\nthe total population screened, 2.4% had ISH (systolic blood\npressure 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure\nprevalence of ISH was greater in blacks and women than in\nboth whites and men. The prevalence of ISH was 5.3% in\nwhite men, 6.4% in black men, 7.4% in white women, and\n8.3% in black women. In an analysis of 30-year follow-up\ndata from the Framingham Study, Wilking et al9 reported that\nyears and accounted for 57% of all hypertensive conditions in\nmen and 65% in women. Although the risk of stroke overall\nand according to type and subtype has been evaluated in some\nclinical trials involving participants with ISH, the long-term\nnatural history of ISH and BISH has not been determined,\nparticularly in younger age groups. We used 20-year\nfollow-up data from the first National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiological\nFollow-Up Study (NHEFS) to determine the risks of stroke\nand types of stroke that are associated with ISH and BISH.\nFor a comparative analysis, we estimated the risk of these\noutcomes in patients with diastolic hypertension and normo-\ntension. We also evaluated the factors that increase the risk of\nstroke in patients with these hypertensive conditions.\nSubjects and Methods\nNHANES I was conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during\nsample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the United\n1 and 74 years was included. The NHANES I was designed so that\ncertain population groups considered at high risk of malnutrition\n(such as the elderly, those living in poverty areas, and women of\nchild-bearing age) were oversampled at preset rates. Adjusted\nsampling weights were computed within 60 age/sex/race categories\nto inflate the sample to closely reflect the US civilian noninstitution-\nalized population at the midpoint of the survey. A subset of 14 407\nNHANES I participants who were between the ages of 25 and 74\nyears (at the time of the baseline survey) received a more detailed\nhealth examination. The NHEFS comprised a series of studies to\nprovide follow-up data on these 14 407 NHANES I participants. The\nand 1992. The first wave of data collection was performed during\ninterviews with subject or proxy; measuring pulse rate, weight, and\nblood pressure of surviving participants; collecting hospital and\nnursing home records of overnight stay; and collecting death\ncertificates of decedents. Subsequent follow-up of the NHEFS was\nconducted with the same design and data collection procedures\nexcept that a 30-minute computer-assisted telephone interview was\nadministered in place of a personal interview and no physical\nmeasurements were made. Tracing and data collection in the NHEFS\nwere very high, with 94% of the study population traced for each\ncompleted wave of follow-up. The interview rates ranged from 91%\nto 96% of the participants traced. By the end of the 1992 NHEFS\nprevious surveys had been successfully traced.15 Approximately\n32% of the NHEFS cohort was known to be deceased, with a death\ncertificate available for 98% of the 4604 NHEFS decedents. An\nanalysis was performed to determine the effect of age at baseline\nevaluation on loss to follow-up. Age at baseline was categorized into\nfive 10-year age groups. Rates of loss to follow-up were highest for\nparticipants aged 45 years (14%) and decreased for subsequent age\nyears, respectively).\nDefinitions of Stroke Events and Stroke Types\nParticipants were considered to have experienced a stroke event if\nthey were hospitalized or died during the 20-year follow-up period\n437.1 according to the International Classification of Diseases,\nNinth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Our definition of\nstroke event included both ischemic and hemorrhagic events but not\ntransient ischemic events (ICD-9-CM code 435). ICD-9-CM codes\nwere assigned on the basis of the underlying cause of death listed on\nthe participant's death certificate. Stroke events were further classi-\nfied as intracerebral hemorrhage in participants with ICD-9-CM\nDefinitions of Hypertensive Conditions\nBlood pressure status was categorized on the basis of measurements\nobtained at physical examination during the NHANES I baseline\nclinical evaluation. One blood pressure measurement was obtained\nfrom all participants in a sitting position and was used for the present\nanalysis. ISH was defined as systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg\nand diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg. BISH was defined as\ndiastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg. Diastolic hypertension was\ndefined as diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg. Normotension was\ndefined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood\nthe NHANES I baseline survey had 3 consecutive blood pressure\nmeasurements performed. We determined the correlation between\nsingle blood pressure recordings with the average of 3 consecutive\nblood pressure recordings. Pearson product-moment coefficient was\nused to test this correlation with the use of JMP statistical software\n(SAS Institute Inc). A high correlation coefficient of 0.95 and 0.92\nfor systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was observed\nbetween single recording and average of multiple recordings.\nStudy Variables\nKnown cerebrovascular risk factors that were identified as potential\nconfounding variables in our study of the association between\nhypertensive conditions and stroke events were age, sex, race/\nethnicity (black, white, other), educational attainment (12 years,\nbody mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of the height in meters), diabetes mellitus, and cigarette\nsmoking (never, former, and current). All measurements were\nobtained prospectively during the NHANES I baseline interview.\nInformation regarding the status of cigarette smoking was obtained\nfrom the 1982 follow-up. Socioeconomic data and smoking status\nwere self-reported. Diabetes mellitus was determined from the\npatient's report of a physician's diagnosis. Trained examiners mea-\nsured the height and weight of each participant during the NHANES\nI physical examination.\nStatistical Analyses\nBecause the duration of follow-up varied among the participants,\nCox proportional hazard analysis was used to estimate the relative\nrisk (RR) for stroke and stroke types. We included all patients in the\nanalysis and censored the data for patients who died from noncar-\ndiovascular deaths at the time of death. RR for stroke and stroke\ntypes for each type of hypertension was estimated after adjustment\nfor the established cerebrovascular risk factors. The Cox propor-\ntional hazard model was adjusted for differences in age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, education, cigarette smoking, serum cholesterol level,\ndiabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and body mass\nindex. In the present model age was dichotomized at 60 or 60\nyears. The cutoff for dichotomization is based on the age definitions\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nused by previous clinical trials evaluating the effect of treated and\nuntreated hypertension on cardiovascular diseases.16\u00ad18 The data\nregarding diabetic status were unavailable for a large proportion of\nparticipants. The exact relationship between this category of diabetes\nand stroke is undefined and probably not comparable to participants\neither with or without documented diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we\nentered the variable of diabetes mellitus as absent, present, or\nunknown. A second logistic regression analysis was performed\nwithout including serum cholesterol levels in the model. This\nanalysis was performed because serum cholesterol levels may be\nassociated with ischemic stroke but not with intracerebral hemor-\nrhage.19 Furthermore, an inverse association has been suggested\nbetween serum cholesterol levels and intracerebral hemorrhage.20\nBecause the exclusion of serum cholesterol levels from the model did\nnot affect the results, the results of the analysis including serum\ncholesterol levels are presented. All the variables were entered in the\nmodel simultaneously to adjust for the potential confounding effect\nof each variable.\nA separate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to\nevaluate the effect of the following variables: age, sex, absolute\nmeasurement value of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, diabetes\nmellitus, smoking, serum cholesterol, body mass index, and use of\nantihypertensive medication on risk of stroke in participants with\nISH or BISH. A subset analysis was performed in patients with\ndiastolic hypertension to determine the effect of systolic blood\npressure on the risk of stroke compared with normotensive persons.\nThe multivariate-adjusted risk of stroke was analyzed for different\n180 mm Hg).

Those who died from causes other than stroke\n(n2738) were censored at the time of death and included in\nthe analysis.

Partic-\nipants with ISH, BISH, or diastolic hypertension were 3 to 6\ntimes more likely to have strokes than those with normoten-\nsion. The stroke rate was 2 times higher in persons with\nISH than in those with either BISH or diastolic hypertension.\nA significantly higher RR for all strokes was observed in\npersons after adjustment for confounding factors through\nmultivariate analysis. An increased RR for both ischemic\nstroke and intracerebral hemorrhage was found in persons\nwith ISH, BISH, and diastolic hypertension compared with\nthose with normotension.\nTable 3 demonstrates the factors that contributed to in-\ncreased risk for all strokes among participants with ISH or\nBISH (n1734). The risk of stroke was higher in persons\naged 45 years. Other independent variables associated with\nrisk of stroke were diabetes mellitus (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to\nCI, 1.5 to 4.0). Regular or occasional use of antihypertensive\nmedication was not associated with the risk of stroke.\nIn the subset analysis including patients with diastolic\nhypertension, there was a stepwise increase in the risk for\nstroke with higher systolic blood pressure. Compared with\nnormotensive patients, the multivariate-adjusted risk of stroke\nfor each category of systolic blood pressure was as follows:\nDiscussion\nOur analysis showed that each category of hypertension\nrepresented in this study confers an increased risk for stroke,\nincluding both ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage.\nISH appeared to pose the highest risk for both types of stroke\nevents. The stroke risk for persons with BISH appears to\napproximate that for persons with diastolic hypertension. Our\nanalysis also identified characteristics in persons with ISH or\nBISH that are associated with an increased risk of stroke.\nISH as a Risk Factor for Stroke\nKannel et al21 reported prospective data from the Framing-\nham Study relating systolic and diastolic blood pressure,\npulse-wave configuration, and patient age to future stroke\nincidents. Subjects with ISH experienced 2 to 4 times as\nmany strokes as did normotensive persons. Although diastolic\nblood pressure was related to stroke in subjects with systolic\nhypertension, the diastolic component added little to the risk\nassessment in men and was unrelated to the overall incidence\nof stroke. Systolic pressure seemed to be the more potent\ncontributor of stroke. The Copenhagen City Heart Study,22 a\nprospective population survey, evaluated the prevalence of\nISH and associated risk of major cardiovascular events. The\nrisk of stroke and myocardial infarction in association with\nnot receiving antihypertensive or cardiac medicine and had\nno history of stroke or myocardial infarction. The prevalence\nof ISH showed an age-related increase from 3% in 55-year-\nTABLE 2.

The RR of stroke\nafter adjustment for other risk factors was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.6 to\nwas the highest RR among all hypertensive groups. The\npopulation-attributable risk for stroke associated with ISH\nwas estimated as 30%.\nThe risk of death from coronary heart disease, stroke, all\ncardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality associated with\nISH among the middle-aged population was determined in\nhistory of myocardial infarction or stroke over a 15-year\nfollow-up period.23 Coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiovascu-\nlar disease, and mortality from all causes among men and\nwomen aged 45 to 64 years increased with increasing levels of\nsystolic blood pressure. Among women aged 45 to 64 years, ISH\nincreased the RR of these fatal events. Among men aged 45 to\n64 years, only deaths related to coronary heart disease were\nsignificantly associated with ISH.\nPetrovitch et al24 examined the prevalence of ISH in a\nyears and compared rates of stroke among those with ISH,\nisolated diastolic hypertension, combined systolic-diastolic\nhypertension, and normotension. Men with ISH had the\nhighest rates of stroke, followed by men with systolic-dia-\nstolic hypertension. Men with isolated diastolic hypertension\nhad rates only slightly higher than those of men in the\nnormotension group. RR adjusted for other risk factors varied\nby age group. For men aged 45 to 54 years, RRs of stroke for\nsubjects with ISH, isolated diastolic hypertension, and sys-\ntolic-diastolic hypertension (compared with normotensive\nsubjects) were 4.8, 1.4, and 4.3, respectively.

In these trials,\nyears. Various antihypertensive medications were used to\ntreat ISH. These included thiazides, calcium channel block-\ners, a combination of thiazide and triamterene, -blockers,\nand thiazide in combination with either amiloride or a\n-blocker. Among 7757 placebo-treated patients, major car-\nreceived pharmacological treatment, major complications\npersons. Pharmacological treatment of ISH reduced total\nmortality by 13%, cardiovascular mortality by 18%, all\ncardiovascular complications by 26%, stroke by 30%, and\ncoronary events by 33%. We observed that in patients with\nBISH or ISH, antihypertensive treatment did not affect the\nrisk for stroke. This finding may be secondary to treated\nhypertensives having had years of uncontrolled hypertension.\nGiles et al,27 in an analysis of the NHANES I cohort,\nobserved that among persons with a blood pressure 140/\n90 mm Hg, persons who were receiving medication had a\nmean blood pressure of 164/94 mm Hg, while persons who\nreported not taking medication had a mean blood pressure of\n152/92 mm Hg. The lack of beneficial effect of antihyperten-\nsive medication is probably attributable to the presence of\nmore severe hypertension in treated patients.\nStroke Types and Subtypes and ISH\nWe observed that the risk of either ischemic stroke or\nintracerebral hemorrhage is higher in persons with ISH and\nBISH. In a subgroup analysis in the Systolic Hypertension in\nthe Elderly Program (SHEP), Perry et al28 evaluated the\nincidence of stroke types and subtypes in 4736 men and\nwomen aged 60 years with ISH from 16 clinical centers in\nthe United States. Participants were randomly assigned to\nreceive treatment with either chlorthalidone (12 mg daily),\nchlorthalidone (same dose) with atenolol (25 mg daily) or\nreserpine (0.05 mg daily), or a placebo. They were followed\nparticipants in the active treatment and placebo groups,\nrespectively, had ischemic stroke; 9 and 19 participants,\nrespectively, had hemorrhagic strokes. A significant reduc-\ntion was observed in the risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic\nstroke in the active treatment group. No significant difference\nwas observed in the risk for stroke of unknown type. Among\npatients with ischemic stroke, a significant reduction was\nobserved in the RR for ischemic strokes classified as lacunar\nand undetermined. The RR was not significantly different for\nembolic and atherosclerotic ischemic stroke.\nISH appeared to have a stronger association with both\nischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage compared with\nBISH and diastolic hypertension (Table 2). No clear evidence\nexists to support a differential effect of ISH and diastolic\nhypertension in predisposing to ischemic or hemorrhagic\nstroke. Davis et al29 determined the risk factors for stroke and\nstroke subtype in the SHEP trial. In the multivariate analysis,\nhigher systolic blood pressure was associated with an in-\ncreased risk for stroke and ischemic stroke. No definite\nrelationship could be demonstrated between systolic blood\npressure and hemorrhagic stroke, atherosclerotic ischemic\nstroke, lacunar ischemic stroke, or embolic stroke. However,\nthe analysis was limited because of the small number of\npatients in each of the outcome categories. A report of a\ncombined analysis of 13 cohorts from eastern Asia reported\nthe effect of baseline diastolic pressure on risk of ischemic\nperson-years of observation.19 Logistic regression analyses\ndemonstrated a somewhat stronger association between dia-\nstolic blood pressure and hemorrhagic stroke in comparison\nwith ischemic stroke.\nPersons With ISH and BISH at Risk for Stroke\nWe found a higher risk of stroke among participants with ISH\nor BISH aged 45 years. Other persons at higher risk\nincluded diabetics, and those with systolic blood pressures\n180 mm Hg. Previous studies have recognized the prognos-\ntic importance of age and diabetes mellitus for determining\nthe risk of stroke among patients with ISH. Davis et al29\nperformed proportional hazards analyses of data from the\nSHEP to determine risk factors for stroke and stroke type in\npersons with ISH. During an average follow-up of 4.5 years,\n25 embolic strokes) were documented. The authors concluded\nthat in older persons with ISH, history of diabetes and\nsmoking are important risk factors for lacunar stroke, whereas\ncarotid bruit and age are important risk factors for atheroscle-\nrotic and embolic stroke, respectively. In the SHEP pilot\nproject, Siegel et al30 examined the effect of known cardio-\nvascular risk factors in younger persons to see whether they\nwere applicable in an elderly population. They prospectively\nfollowed up 551 men and women aged 60 years and who\nhad pretreatment systolic blood pressures 160 mm Hg and\ndiastolic blood pressures 90 mm Hg. After adjustment for\nconfounding variables, age, level of education, history of\ncardiovascular event, and smoking remained significant pre-\ndictors of a first-time cardiovascular event. We did not find a\nrelationship between diastolic blood pressure and risk of\nstroke. In a subgroup analysis of the 4736 participants in\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nSHEP, Somes et al31 found, for persons with ISH, that a\ndecrease of 5 mm Hg in diastolic BP increased the risk for\ncardiovascular disease (RR, 1.11).\nIssues Related to Data Interpretation\nWe used the blood pressure recording from baseline evalua-\ntion to define various forms of hypertension. Blood pressure\nis not static but rather a continuous variable that changes from\nminute to minute.32 Therefore, casual blood pressure readings\nrepresent a minute part of the entire 24-hour circadian blood\npressure pattern. In addition, some patients may manifest a\ntransient stress response when blood pressure is measured in\nthe presence of a medical professional (white coat hyperten-\nsion). Perloff et al33 evaluated 1076 persons with both office\nand ambulatory blood pressure measurements. The ambula-\ntory measurements were obtained with a semiautomatic\npatient-activated portable device (10 to 40 measurements per\npatient over 1 to 2 days). The ambulatory blood pressure\nmeasurements were lower than office measurements in 78%\nof the patients. The effect of this overestimation by office\nblood pressure measurement was most prominent in women\nand persons with borderline hypertension. The relationship\nbetween the measurements generated by these 2 methods\ncorrelated in a linear manner. Our use of a single blood\npressure measurement to define various forms of hyperten-\nsion may have led to inclusion of nonhypertensive patients in\nthe BISH category. Because of the presence of normotensive\npersons, the actual risk of stroke in persons with BISH may\nbe higher than that determined in our study.\nWe used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth\nRevision (ICD-9) codes from discharge abstracts and death\ncertificates to identify incident cases of stroke and stroke\nsubtypes. Broderick et al34 determined the accuracy and yield\nof ICD-9-CM codes for cases of stroke and transient ischemic\nattack in a population-based study. The ICD-9 diagnoses\nwere compared with the diagnoses made by the study\nneurologist after review of clinical and radiographic informa-\ntion for each potential case. When primary discharge diag-\npositive rate was 83% and the yield of cases of stroke and\ntransient ischemic attack was 84%. The validity of death\ncertificate diagnosis of stroke and its type as the underlying\ncause of death was investigated in a sample of in-hospital\ndeaths of possible stroke cases from the Minnesota Heart\nSurvey.35 Relative to a standardized physician diagnosis,\npositive predictive values for the death certificate diagnosis\nwere 100% for all types of stroke, 82% for intracranial\nhemorrhage, and 97% for nonhemorrhagic stroke. On the\nbasis of results of previous population-based studies, we think\nthat hospital discharge or death certificate diagnoses are\nsufficiently accurate to justify their use in epidemiologic\nstudies. Probably most important, the validity of ICD-9\ndiagnoses does not differ by strata defined by blood pressure.\nThe follow-up rates differed by age, with the lowest tracing\nrate observed in participants aged 45 years. Because the\nmajority of strokes occur among older adults, participants lost\nto follow-up could not have substantially biased the results\npresented in this report.\nConclusions\nWe observed that BISH is a category of hypertension that is\nassociated with an increased risk of stroke, ischemic stroke,\nand intracerebral hemorrhage, which is similar to that asso-\nciated with ISH and diastolic hypertension. The increased risk\nof stroke was also observed in the younger group of partici-\npants (aged 45 to 64 years) who had systolic hypertension.\nFuture clinical trials should evaluate the effect of antihyper-\ntensive treatment in younger persons with BISH and ISH.\nReferences\n1.
