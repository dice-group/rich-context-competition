KU-32 (N-{7-\nrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy]-8-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-\n3-yl}acetamide) was developed as a novel, novobiocin-based,\nC-terminal inhibitor of Hsp90 whose ability to increase\nHsp70 expression is linked to the presence of an acet-\namide substitution of the prenylated benzamide moiety of\nnovobiocin. KU-32 protected against glucose-induced\ndeath of embryonic DRG (dorsal root ganglia) neurons\ncultured for 3 days in vitro. Similarly, KU-32 significantly\ndecreased neuregulin 1-induced degeneration of myeli-\nnated Schwann cell DRG neuron co-cultures prepared\nfrom WT (wild-type) mice.

KU-32 is readily bioavailable and\nwas administered once a week for 6 weeks at a dose of\n20 mg/kg to WT and Hsp70 KO mice that had been\nrendered diabetic with streptozotocin for 12 weeks. After\n12 weeks of diabetes, both WT and Hsp70 KO mice\ndeveloped deficits in NCV (nerve conduction velocity) and\na sensory hypoalgesia. Although KU-32 did not improve\nglucose levels, HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin) or insulin\nlevels, it reversed the NCV and sensory deficits in WT but\nnot Hsp70 KO mice.

Indeed, small molecule\ninhibitors against targets that are relatively diabetes-specific,\ni.e. aldose reductase and advanced glycation end products,\nhave not effectively halted the progressive degeneration of\nsensory fibres in human DPN (Tomlinson and Gardiner, 2008).\nOn the other hand, targeting pathways that contribute to\ndisease progression, but that are not necessarily diabetes-\nspecific, has met with some success. For example, oxidative\nstress contributes to neuron and glial degeneration in DPN\n(Obrosova, 2009) and some small molecule antioxidants have\nshown efficacy in reversing clinical and electrophysiological\ndeficits associated with the disease (Pop-Busui et al., 2006). A\ncommon theme in the above approaches has been the\npharmacological targeting of one specific biochemical\npathology associated with DPN. An alternative and relatively\nunexplored paradigm for treating DPN is to up-regulate a\nbroad cytoprotective response.\nHsp90 (heat-shock protein 90) is the master regulator of\nthe HSR (heat-shock response) since it binds HSF1 (heat-\n1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email dobrowsky@ku.edu).\nAbbreviations: AM, acetoxymethyl ester; DAPI, 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DPN, diabetic peripheral neuropathy; DRG,\ndorsal root ganglion; Drp1, dynamin-related protein 1; FBG, fasting blood glucose; FCS, fetal calf serum; Hsc70, heat-shock cognate 70 stress protein; HSF1, heat-shock\ndimethyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy]-8-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl}acetamide; LC-MS, liquid chromatography MS; MBP, myelin basic protein; MNCV, motor NCV;\nNCV, nerve conduction velocity; NGF, nerve growth factor; NRG1, human recombinant neuregulin-1-b1 epidermal growth factor domain; SC-DRG, Schwann cell DRG; SNCV,\nsensory NCV; STZ, streptozotocin; WT, wild-type.\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nshock factor 1). Disruption of the Hsp90\u00adHSF1 complex by\ncellular stress induces the transcriptional up-regulation of\nantioxidant genes and molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70,\nthat characterize the cytoprotective HSR (Peterson and Blagg,\n2009). The induction of molecular chaperones can minimize\nthe accumulation of damaged proteins by enhancing their\nrefolding and interfering with pro-apoptotic pathways\ninhibitors can mimic cell stress and promote the release of\ndecrease protein aggregation has been proposed for treating\nneurodegenerative diseases whose aetiology is linked to the\naccumulation of specific misfolded or aggregated proteins\nof DPN is unlikely to result from accumulation of any one\nspecific misfolded or aggregated protein, hyperglycaemia can\nincrease oxidative modification of proteins (Akude et al., 2009).\nThis can damage protein structure, impair protein folding,\ndecrease refolding of damaged protein or induce protein\naggregation. Thus chaperone induction by Hsp90 inhibitors\nmay help to minimize hyperglycaemic stress; however, their\nuse is potentially complicated by the dual role of Hsp90 in\nregulating protein folding.\nIn the presence of co-chaperones, the folding of nascent\nand damaged polypeptides into their biologically active\nstructures is dependent on Hsp90 and Hsp70. `Client proteins'\nform a stabilized complex with an Hsp90 homodimer, and ATP\nhydrolysis by the chaperone's intrinsic N-terminal ATPase\nprovides the energy necessary for conformational maturation\nof the client. Inhibiting the chaperone activity of Hsp90\nblocks protein folding and leads to client protein degradation\n(Powers and Workman, 2007). Since many oncoproteins are\nHsp90 clients, N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors promote onco-\nprotein degradation and cytotoxicity (Bishop et al., 2007;\nTaldone et al., 2008). Thus Hsp90 inhibitors can be useful as\nboth chemotherapeutic and neuroprotective agents, and their\nprimary biological outcome is dictated by the therapeutic\nwindow that dissociates client protein degradation and\ncytotoxicity from the cytoprotective induction of an HSR\ninhibitors have been designed (Pacey et al., 2006), we sought\nnovel Hsp90 analogues that effectively promote neuropro-\ntection in the absence of cytotoxicity.\nNovobiocin is an inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase that also\nexhibits weak affinity for the C-terminal ATP-binding domain\nof Hsp90. Since novobiocin promotes client protein degradation\nat concentrations that also induce an HSR (Marcu et al., 2000a,\n2000b; Figure 1A), a systematic modification of novobiocin\nwas undertaken to identify structure\u00adactivity relationships\nthat yielded high-affinity C-terminal analogues that diverged\nclient protein degradation from Hsp70 induction (Burlison et al.,\ndihydroxy-5-methoxy-6,6-dimethyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-\nyloxy]-8-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl}acetamide;\nFigure 1A) emerged from this library as a potent inducer of\nHsp70, but a poor inducer of client protein degradation.\nImportantly, KU-32 was found to be minimally cytotoxic to\nprimary cortical neurons and protected against neuronal death\ninduced by amyloid b-peptide (Ansar et al., 2007; Lu et al.,\nPrevious work has suggested that Hsp70 can improve the\nsurvival of motor and sensory neurons after axotomy of\nneonatal sciatic nerves (Tidwell et al., 2004). However, it is\nunknown whether pharmacologically manipulating molecular\nchaperones in adult animals is sufficient to improve clinically\nrelevant indices of unmyelinated and myelinated fibre\nlevels, we examined whether it decreased neurodegeneration\nof non-myelinated or myelinated sensory neurons in vitro\nand attenuated the pathophysiological progression of DPN in\nmice. Our results provide compelling evidence that inhibiting\nHsp90 can protect against sensory neuron death and\ndemyelination and reverse the sensory deficits associated\nwith DPN. Moreover, Hsp70 expression is critical to this\nneuroprotection since its genetic ablation abolished drug\nefficacy. These results establish proof-of-principle that\npharmacological modulation of molecular chaperones may\nbe useful toward decreasing neurodegeneration associated\nwith the onset of DPN.\nMaterials\nSTZ (streptozotocin) was obtained from Sigma\u00adAldrich (St.\nthesized and structural purity was verified as described\nantibodies used and their sources were: SMI-94R (Covance,\nPrinceton, NJ, U.S.A.); compact myelin protein zero (P0\n),\nubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (PGP 9.5; Chemicon, Temecula,\nArbor, MI, U.S.A.); Akt (also called protein kinase B), b-actin\nand horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies\n(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.); Alexa\nanti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, U.S.A.).\nMCF7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified\nEagle's medium)-F12 medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS\n(fetal calf serum) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml\nstreptomycin.\nPreparation of non-myelinated and myelinated\nDRG (dorsal root ganglion) neurons\nDRG neurons were dissected from embryonic day 15\u00ad18 rat\npups (Zanazzi et al., 2001) and ganglia were collected into L15\ndissociation, the cells were resuspended in serum-free\nM.J.

The cultures were co-\nstained for MBP and PGP9.5 and nuclei were visualized with\nDAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Degeneration of the\nmyelin segments was quantified with the aid of the open\nsource imaging software, Cell Profiler (http://www.cellprofiler.\norg). Individual myelin internodes were identified using\nOtsu's method for thresholding and segmentation (Otsu,\n1979).

Thermal stimuli\nwere delivered using a Hargreaves analgesiometer (Hargreaves\net al., 1988).

KU-\n32 significantly increased the expression of Hsp70 in MCF7\ncells at 10 nM, which is consistent with the induction of an\nHSR. Although inhibiting Hsp90 can destabilize its association\nwith client proteins such as Akt and lead to their degradation,\n5 mM KU-32 only induced a 35% decrease in the Akt client\n(Figures 1B and 1D). In contrast, KU-174 is a novobiocin\nanalogue in which the acetamide is replaced with a biaryl ring\nM.J.

This substitution abolished Hsp70 induc-\ntion and shifted the potency for promoting a 50% decrease\nin the Akt client protein from .5 mM for KU-32 to approx.\nthe prenylated benzamide of novobiocin with the simplified\nacetamide is responsible for differentiating client protein\ndegradation from Hsp70 induction.\nSince DPN affects both non-myelinated and myelinated\nsensory fibres, we assessed whether KU-32 could protect\ncultured sensory neurons against death and demyelination. We\nfirst determined whether KU-32 could protect unmyelinated\nembryonic primary sensory neurons from glucose-induced cell\ndeath (Vincent et al., 2005). Rat embryonic DRG neurons were\ncultured for 3 days and hyperglycaemia was induced by the\naddition of 20 mM excess glucose (45 mM final glucose\nconcentration) to the medium. Cell death was assessed by the\nuptake of propidium iodide. Hyperglycaemia increased neuro-\nnal death by ,1.5-fold, but a 6 h pretreatment with either\n0.1 or 1 mM KU-32 prevented glucose-induced cell death\n(Figure 2A). Regardless of any arguments surrounding the physio-\nlogical relevance of the glucose concentration, these in vitro\ndata support that targeting molecular chaperones can protect\nunmyelinated sensory neurons from acute glucotoxicity.\nTo ascertain whether KU-32 could protect myelinated\naxons against degeneration, we assessed its ability to prevent\nNRG1-induced demyelination. Neuregulin-1 is a family of EGF\n(epidermal growth factor)-like ligands that bind ErbB\nreceptors and can induce demyelination of myelinated rat\nor mouse SC-DRG neurons (Syed et al., 2010). Myelin\ndegeneration is readily visualized and quantified by staining\nthe SC-DRG co-cultures for MBP and assessing the number of\ndamaged myelin segments (Zanazzi et al., 2001). At 2 days\nafter treating rat SC-DRG co-cultures with 100 ng/ml NRG1,\nthe percentage of damaged myelin segments was approx.\nwas sufficient to prevent this damage. Similarly, KU-32 also\nprevented the NRG1-induced decrease in the expression of\nthe compact myelin protein zero, P0\n(Figure 2C). Importantly,\nany alterations in client protein levels by KU-32 were not\nsufficient to affect viability since 1 mM KU-32 neither\npromoted the death of the unmyelinated sensory neurons\n(Figure 2A) nor increased the number of damaged myelin\nsegments in the SC-DRG co-cultures (Figure 2B).\nAlthough KU-32 induces the expression of Hsp70, it\nremains unclear whether this protein may be central to its\nneuroprotective efficacy. Therefore SC-DRG co-cultures were\nmice. These two genes represent the inducible forms of\nHsp70, while a related chaperone that is constitutively\nexpressed, Hsc70 (heat-shock cognate 70 stress protein), is\npresent at normal levels in these mice (Hunt et al., 2004). WT\ndecrease in the area occupied by myelinated segments\n(Figures 3A and 3B). Additionally, the segments showed a\nsignificant shortening of internode length, indicative of an\nincreased number of breaks due to the ongoing degeneration\nFigure 2 KU-32 protects rat sensory neurons against glucose-induced\ndeath and neuregulin-induced demyelination\n(a) Embryonic sensory neurons were treated for 6 h with 1% DMSO or 0.1\u00ad1\nmM KU-32 in a medium containing 25 mM glucose (LG). The glucose\nconcentration was raised to 45 mM to induce hyperglycaemia (HG) and the\ncells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cell death was assessed using\nversus HG; #P,0.02 versus HG (n53).

As above, pretreatment\nwith 1 mM KU-32 prevented the damage to the myelin\nsegments formed in cultures from WT mice, and this cor-\nrelated with an increase in Hsp70 levels in the KU-32-treated\ncultures (results not shown). On the other hand,\nKU-32 was ineffective in preventing NRG1-induced demye-\nlination in co-cultures prepared from Hsp70 KO mice\nlevels in these cultures (results not shown). These results\nsupport the notion that Hsp70 expression is a key component\nof the neuroprotective efficacy of KU-32.\nKU-32 attenuates the pathophysiological\nprogression of DPN\nThe onset of DPN in rodents (3\u00ad12 weeks) is characterized by\nearly metabolic alterations in the conduction velocity of\nperipheral nerves and the development of altered sensory\nthresholds to noxious thermal (unmyelinated fibres) or\nmechanical (myelinated fibres) stimuli presented to the foot.\nSince our in vitro readouts support the notion that KU-32\nprotects unmyelinated and myelinated nerves from death and\ndegeneration, we rationalized that it may be similarly\nprotective in a rodent model of DPN.\nKU-32 is highly bioavailable and has a systemic clearance of\n71.4 ml/min per kg. The drug was detectable to similar levels in\nboth brain tissue and plasma after intraperitoneal administra-\ntion in mice and had a mean half-life (tK\nmin in plasma and brain respectively (Figure 4A). Although the\naccumulation of KU-32 in peripheral nerve has not been\nassessed, the level of Hsp70 was modestly increased in sciatic\nnerve at 1 week after drug administration (Figure 4B). Pre-\nliminary studies indicated that more frequent dosing at these\nconcentrations did not increase the expression of Hsp70.\nWeekly treatment of KU-32 for 6 weeks at both doses did not\nalter body weight and showed no confounding affects on\nelectrophysiological and psychophysical measures that are\ndiagnostic for the onset of DPN (results not shown). No overt\ntoxicity was seen at 60 mg/kg, which was the highest dose\ntested.\nFigure 3 Hsp70 is required for KU-32 to protect against neuregulin-induced demyelination\nMyelinated mouse SC-DRG neuron co-cultures were prepared from WT (a\u00adc) or Hsp70 KO (d\u00adf) mice and treated overnight with\nvehicle or 1 mM KU-32. The cultures were treated with PBS or 200 ng/ml NRG1 for 4 days and myelin segments were visualized by\nstaining the cultures for MBP. Total cell number was assessed by staining nuclei with DAPI.

Therefore diabetes was\ninduced in 8-week-old C57Bl/6 mice and allowed to progress\nfor 12 weeks prior to drug treatment. Mice then received\nvehicle or 20 mg/kg KU-32 once a week for 6 weeks. WT mice\nthat were diabetic for 3 months developed significant deficits\nin MNCV prior to drug treatment (control, 60.4\u00a12.0 m/s; STZ,\nSNCV declined, it did not yet reach significance (control,\nboth MNCV and SNCV continued to significantly decline after\n18 weeks of diabetes, KU-32 prevented this degeneration and\nreturned NCV to control levels (Figure 5A). Consistent with\nthe development of a sensory hypoalgesia, diabetic mice also\nshowed decreased responses to mechanical (Figure 5B) and\nthermal (Figure 5C) stimuli. KU-32 treatment also signifi-\ncantly improved these deficits in a time-dependent manner\nto near control levels after 6 weeks of treatment. It is\nimportant to note that diabetic mice receiving KU-32 showed\nno changes in FBG, HbA1c or plasma insulin levels compared\nwith the diabetic mice receiving vehicle (Table 1). Thus the\nimprovements in nerve function are not related to decreased\nhyperglycaemia or an outright increase in insulin levels.\nHowever, since STZ does not completely ablate insulin\nproduction, we cannot rule out the possibility that KU-32\nmay improve insulin action (Chung et al., 2008).\nTo define the relative contribution of Hsp70 to the efficacy\nof KU-32, we examined the effect of diabetes and KU-32\nFigure 4 Pharmacokinetic profile of KU-32 uptake in plasma and brain\nafter intraperitoneal administration\n(a) KU-32 (2 mg/ml) was injected intraperitoneally in 5% Captisol, and plasma\nand brain samples were taken at the indicated time.

Diabetic Hsp70 KO mice also\ndeveloped significant deficits in MNCV and SNCV (Figure 6A)\nthat mirrored those seen in WT mice. Compared with WT\nmice, genetic deletion of Hsp70 did not alter the severity of\nthe deficits in mechanical (Figure 6B) and thermal sensitivity\n(Figure 6C) that had developed prior to drug treatment. Thus\nthe Hsp70 KO mice respond to diabetes in a manner very\nsimilar to that observed in WT mice. However, weekly dosing\nunable to correct the deficits in NCV or mechanical and\nthermal sensitivities. Consistent with the in vitro data, these\nresults provide strong support that Hsp70 plays a central role\nin the neuroprotective efficacy of KU-32.\nDISCUSSION\nTargeting molecular chaperones has shown promising results\nin treating both neurodegenerative and diabetes-associated\nphenotypes. For example, N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors\ndecreased motor neuron degeneration in a murine model of\nspinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Waza et al., 2005) and\nreduced aggregated or hyperphosphorylated forms of tau\nprotein in JNPL3 mice (Luo et al., 2007) and humanized tau\nprotein transgenic mice (Dickey et al., 2007). Similarly,\ninduction of Hsp70 with HSF1 activators (bimoclomol and\nrelated hydroxylamine derivatives) improved insulin resist-\nance (Chung et al., 2008), diabetic wound healing (Atalay et\nslowing of NCV in diabetic rats (Biro et al., 1997). In the\npresent study, we provide the first evidence that a novel C-\nterminal Hsp90 inhibitor that increases Hsp70 expression is\nsimilarly effective in preventing death of unmyelinated\nneurons, demyelination of myelinated sensory neurons and\nwas able to reverse pre-existing sensory deficits associated\nwith the development of DPN in mice.\nHsp70 is a critical mechanistic component necessary for the\nefficacy of KU-32 in improving a major neurodegenerative\ncomplication of diabetes. However, the molecular basis by\nwhich Hsp70 intersects with biochemical mediators that\ncontribute to the pathophysiology of DPN is unclear. It is well\nrecognized that induction of the HSR can up-regulate\nnumerous genes that may have a beneficial effect in\nameliorating DPN, i.e. Mn superoxide dismutase and haem\noxygenase 1. The reliance on Hsp70 expression for neuropro-\ntection suggests that if KU-32 promotes a broader HSR via the\nrelease of HSF-1, this is not sufficient for drug efficacy.\nPrevious work has shown that up-regulation of Hsp70 can\nimprove insulin resistance and that this is associated with a\ndecrease in phosphorylation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)\n(Chung et al., 2008). Although increasing the expression of\nHsp70 inhibits JNK-dependent apoptosis (Bienemann et al.,\nsubstantial contributing feature to the pathophysiology of\nDPN (Cheng and Zochodne, 2003). Indeed, adult neurons are\nrelatively insensitive to JNK-induced apoptosis (Walsh et al.,\n2004). However, JNK activation does mediate death of\nembryonic neurons (Bienemann et al., 2008; Salehi et al.,\nactivity may protect against glucose-induced death of the\nimmature, embryonic DRG neurons. Interestingly, although\nincreased expression of the c-jun transcription factor con-\ntributes to NRG1-induced demyelination, its phosphorylation\nby JNK is not essential to mediate Schwann cell degeneration\n(Parkinson et al., 2008). These results suggest that any\ninhibitory effect of Hsp70 on JNK activity would not be\ncritical to the ability of KU-32 to attenuate demyelination.\nHowever, an interaction of Hsp70 with JNK is possible in the\ncontext of DPN, since JNK activity increases in diabetic nerves\nto features of neuropathic pain (Gao and Ji, 2008). Thus up-\nregulating Hsp70 may be an effective treatment for both\ninsensate and painful diabetic neuropathy.\nThe ability of Hsp70 to refold aggregated or oxidatively\ndamaged proteins may also contribute to improving nerve\nfunction. It is generally accepted that enhanced production\nof reactive oxygen species and subsequent mitochondrial\ndysfunction (Verkhratsky and Fernyhough, 2008) and fission\ncontribute to DPN. Oxidative modification of the mitochon-\ndrial fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) by\nS-nitrosylation favours the formation of Drp1 tetramers and\nTable 1 FBG, HbA1C and insulin levels in WT and Hsp70 KO mice\n*P,0.05 versus vehicle+vehicle; {P,0.05 versus vehicle+KU-32; n.d., not determined.\nTreatment FBG (mg/dl) HbA1C (%) Insulin (nM) n\nWT mice\nM.J.

It will be important to determine whether an\ninteraction of Hsp70 with Drp1 may aid its refolding or\nprevent aggregation to minimize increased GTPase activity\nand organelle fission. However, Hsp70 mutants that are\nfolding-incompetent, but are able to bind and maintain the\nsolubility of denatured proteins, were as effective as WT Hsp70\nin decreasing oxidative stress and the rate of proton leak across\nthe inner mitochondrial membrane in glucose-deprived\nastrocytes (Ouyang et al., 2006). Thus the folding competence\nof Hsp70 may not be a critical feature of neuroprotection, at\nleast in transient models of oxidative stress that are not\nassociated with protein aggregation. On the other hand, Hsp70\nmay also help maintain mitochondrial protein integrity via its\ninteraction with TOM70 (translocase of outer membrane 70),\nwhich is important for mitochondrial protein import (Young\nIt is notable that the diabetic Hsp70 KO mice developed a\nsimilarly severe neuropathy as was observed in the WT mice.\nThis outcome indicates that inducible forms of Hsp70 are not\nnecessary for the pathogenesis and progression of neuropathy.\nHowever, since constitutive forms of Hsp70 (Hsc70) may\npossibility that diabetes-induced changes in chaperone activity\nmay contribute to decreased neuronal function. Indeed, the\neffect of diabetes on Hsp70 protein expression and its role\nin the development of diabetic complications are not clear. In\nshort-term diabetic rats (1 month), Hsp70 levels did not change\nin various skeletal muscles, heart, liver or kidney (Najemnikova\net al., 2007). However, diabetes may affect Hsp70 in a cell-\nselective manner since immunoreactivity increased in the\nkidney outer medulla, but not the glomeruli, of rats rendered\nwhether this contributed to the nephropathy that developed in\nthese animals was not determined. Similarly, some reports\nindicate that a 15 min heat stress enhanced the expression\nof Hsp70 in diabetic heart relative to levels observed in heat-\nstressed non-diabetic rats (Najemnikova et al., 2007). In\ncontrast, induction of Hsp70 has been reported to be similar\nin hearts from heat stressed control and diabetic rats and that\nHsp70 induction in diabetic heart was not cardioprotective\nagainst an ischaemia/reperfusion injury (Joyeux et al., 1999).\nThese results raise the issue of whether Hsp70 induction may be\nbroadly protective in reversing diabetic complications assoc-\niated with other organs. However, to the best of our knowledge,\nthe potential efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors and Hsp70 induction\nagainst other diabetic complications has not been adequately\nexamined.\nIn summary, the present study provides proof-of-principle\nthat pharmacologically targeting molecular chaperones can\nbe sufficiently cytoprotective to reverse pre-existing symp-\ntoms associated with insensate DPN in experimental animals.\nThe potential of this approach as a monotherapy or in\nconjunction with pharmacological agents that antagonize a\nspecific biochemical pathology that contributes to DPN may\nbroaden our translational options toward developing effec-\ntive therapies for the medical management of DPN.\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by grants from the Juvenile Diabetes\nResearch Foundation and the National Institutes of Health\nFigure 6 Hsp70 is required for the in vivo efficacy of KU-32 against\nindices of diabetic sensory neuropathy\nHsp70 KO mice were rendered diabetic for 12 weeks and then treated with\nweekly doses of vehicle or 20 mg/kg KU-32 for 6 weeks.
