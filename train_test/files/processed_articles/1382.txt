    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: To explore the connection between primary care physicians' race and sex and\ntheir annual incomes, we used restricted versions of Community Tracking Study Physician\nmary care physicians, we inconsistently found lower yearly incomes for their black male\npeers but consistently found significantly lower incomes for their female peers of any race,\nafter differences in work effort, physician characteristics, and practice characteristics were\nadjusted for. Sex-based differences persisted over time. Our findings suggest that address-\ning the underlying causes of sex-based income differences should be a priority for health\nprofessional organizations, particularly as more women enter the physician workforce.\nHistorically, women have earned less than men. In the United\nStates, the disparity appears to be narrowing: among full-time, year-\nround workers, the female-to-male median annual earnings ratio im-\nmore women entered the workforce, fewer women received minimum wages, and\nthe real wages of men decreased.1 Blacks and Hispanics also have lower median\nearnings than whites. However, while the black-to-white median annual earnings\nratio has remained relatively constant over the past decade (60.2 percent in 1995\npercent to 72.1 percent. In the recent past, the Asian-to-white median annual earn-\nings ratio also has been increasing.\nWhether income disparities among physicians are attributable to race or sex is\nP C P E a r n i n g s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 8 , N u m b e r 2 5 5 7\nWilliamWeeks(William.B.Weeks@Dartmouth.edu)isprincipalinvestigatorwiththeVeteransAffairs(VA)\nOutcomesGroupResearchEnhancementAwardsProgram(REAP)inWhiteRiverJunction,Vermont,andan\nassociateprofessorattheDartmouthInstituteforHealthPolicyandClinicalPracticeinLebanon,New\nHampshire.TannerWallacewasaresearchassistantattheVAandisnowasenior,DepartmentofEconomics,at\nWashingtonandLeeUniversity,inLexington,Virginia.AmyWallaceisacoreinvestigatorwiththeVAOutcomes\nGroupREAPandanassociateprofessorintheDepartmentofPsychiatryatDartmouthMedicalSchool.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

First, blacks and women represent growing\nproportions of medical students, residents, and practicing physicians.2 Second,\nbecause black primary care physicians (PCPs) have been shown to be more likely\nthan nonminority PCPs to care for underserved, medically indigent, and sicker\npopulations, it stands to reason that their incomes might suffer as a result.3\nUsing American Medical Association (AMA) data, we previously explored the\nrelationship between sex, race, and PCPs' annual incomes in the 1990s.4 After ad-\njusting for work effort, physician characteristics, and practice characteristics, we\nfound that white and black male physicians had similar annual incomes. However,\nwhite female physicians' adjusted incomes were 9 percent lower than those of\ntheir white male counterparts among family physicians, 18 percent lower among\npediatricians, and 19 percent lower among internists. Black female physicians' ad-\njusted incomes were 22 percent lower among family physicians, 27 percent lower\namong pediatricians, and 29 percent lower among internists.\nHowever, those studies had several limitations. First, the number of respon-\ndents was relatively small: to develop an adequate sample size, we needed to\nmerge ten years of data into a single data set. Second, the AMA's sampling method-\nology did not allow for the generation of national estimates. Finally, the AMA data\ndid not allow us to track individual physicians over time and thereby determine\nwhether the sex-based income gaps we saw were changing.\nConducted thrice over the past decade, the Community Tracking Study (CTS)\nPhysician Survey had many respondents, provided national estimate weights, and\ntracked adequate numbers of physicians over time to allow for longitudinal analy-\nses. Therefore, for this study we used the CTS data to determine whether, after ad-\njusting for important variables, we could uncover any race- or sex-based inequities\nin incomes among PCPs, and whether any revealed inequities changed over time.\nStudy Data And Methods\nn Data source. We obtained the restricted-use version of the CTS Physician\nsurveys collected information on physicians practicing in the contiguous United\nStates who provided direct patient care for at least twenty hours per week. The sur-\nveys obtained data on physicians' personal and practice characteristics, and annual\ntively. The surveys excluded federal employees, physicians who had not completed\ntheir medical training, and temporarily licensed international medical graduates\n(IMGs).\nn Sequential cross-sectional samples. We limited our analysis to physicians\nwho self-identified as PCPs in family practice, general internal medicine, or pediat-\nrics. Subspecialists were excluded from the analysis. The restricted-use versions in-\ncluded information on physicians' sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. We limited our\nanalysis to physicians who self-reported their race as Caucasian/white, African\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Whenever Hispanic ethnicity was re-\nported, we classified the physician as Hispanic, regardless of whether race was addi-\ntionally reported. Finally, following methods that we have previously used to mini-\nmize the effects of high- and low-outlier incomes, we limited our analysis to\nphysicians who reported incomes between the first and ninety-ninth percentiles of\nthe sample.6\nn Longitudinal sample. The restricted-use versions of the CTS include a unique\nphysician identifier that allowed us to determine whether a respondent had partici-\npated in multiple surveys. We were therefore able to construct a sample of 510 fam-\nily practice physicians, 360 general internists, and 309 pediatricians who had partic-\nipated in all three surveys.7\nn Independent variables that influence physicians' incomes. We collected\nvariables that we have previously found to be associated with physicians' incomes.\nWork effort. The number of annual hours worked, calculated by multiplying the\nnumber of hours reported working in the practice of medicine in the past week by\nthe number of weeks worked in the last year, is an important variable in analysis of\nphysicians' incomes.8\nProvidercharacteristics. To address our concern that sex might influence the age at\nwhich a physician entered medical school, and therefore bias results, repeating\npreviously used methods, we incorporated into the analysis the number of years,\nin categorical terms from 0\u00ad5 years through forty or more years, that respondents\nreported having practiced medicine, instead of age.9 Because these factors have\nbeen associated with differences in annual incomes among physicians, we in-\ncluded practice ownership status, board certification status, and IMG status as\nvariables.10 Because we reasoned that PCPs' incomes might vary by training de-\ngree, we also included in the analysis the type of degree held--either osteopathic\n(DO) or allopathic (MD).\nPractice characteristics. Because practicing in nonmetropolitan areas has been as-\nsociated with lower physician incomes, we included whether physicians practiced\nin nonmetropolitan areas.11 Further, because disproportionate service of the medi-\ncally indigent and patients with relatively poor insurance has been hypothesized\nto decrease physicians' incomes, we included the self-reported proportion of pa-\ntients in a physician's practice who are insured by Medicare and Medicaid.12\nn Analyses. Using the variables described above, we first performed a sequential\ncross-sectional analysis to describe the physician and practice characteristics of\nmale and female white, black, Asian, and Hispanic physicians. To determine whether\nrace or sex was associated with physicians' incomes, we used a linear regression\nmodel in which the log of physicians' annual incomes was the dependent variable\nand race, sex, and the variables described above were independent variables. Finally,\nfor physicians who had completed surveys for all three years, we used a generalized\nestimating equations (GEE) analysis to determine whether the incomes of particular\nrace/sex groups had changed over time.13\nP C P E a r n i n g s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 8 , N u m b e r 2 5 5 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The number of years in practice for\nwhite male respondents increased over time, while the proportion who did not\nhave an ownership interest in their practices declined over time. Among white\nmale family physicians and pediatricians, board certification rates increased over\ntime. With the exception of black male internists, where incomes and board cer-\ntification rates declined, and Asian family physicians, where non-ownership sta-\ntus increased, similar trends were found among men in all specialties.\nD a t a W a t c h\nPhysicians' Mean Adjusted Annual Incomes, Annual Hours Worked, And Proportion Of\nMedicaid Patients In Practice, By Specialty, Race, And Sex, Relative To White Male\nSOURCE: Authors' analysis of data from the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, 2003.\nNOTE: Means for white males in each specialty are in parentheses.\nSpecialty-specific mean adjusted values as proportion of that for white male physicians\nAsian male\nBlack male\nFamily practice\nInternal medicine\nPediatrics\nWhite female\nHispanic male\nAsian female\nBlack female\nHispanic female\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

With the exception of white female internists,\nacross both specialties, the relative adjusted incomes of all female races/ethnicities\nwere lower in 2003 than in 1997. Among male internists, only blacks had statisti-\ncally lower adjusted annual incomes than their white counterparts, and only in\nethnicity was never associated with incomes that were significantly lower than\nthose for whites. The R2 for the regression models that we used ranged from 20.1\nn Longitudinal analysis. For physicians surveyed in all three years, greater\nwork effort and board certification were associated with higher incomes, while hav-\ning a higher proportion of patients enrolled in Medicaid was associated with lower\nincomes (Exhibit 5). A relatively flat inverted U-shaped lifetime earning curve was\nevident, with incomes peaking after fifteen to nineteen years of practice. Within the\nlongitudinal sample, black male physicians and all female groups had significantly\nlower adjusted incomes than white male physicians. Overall, there was an upward\ntrend of about 1 percent per year in adjusted incomes over time for all groups. How-\never, with the exception of a downward trend in relative adjusted incomes of 0.3 per-\ncent per year (p = 0.08) across time for women, we found no statistically different\nnarrowing or widening of income gaps between white male physicians and race, or\nrace/sex combinations.\nDiscussion\nUsing data from the three most recently completed CTS Physician Surveys, we\nfound that male physicians had higher unadjusted incomes and worked more\nhours, but female physicians were more likely to care for Medicaid patients. After\nadjusting for work effort, physician characteristics, and practice characteristics,\nwe found that across all specialties and virtually every year, female physicians\nconsistently had much lower incomes than white male physicians; among male\nphysicians, we found such disparities only for black internists. We found no evi-\ndence that sex-based disparities that were present in 1997 had decreased by 2003.\nFor a subsample of physicians who participated in all three surveys, we found that\nblack male physicians had lower adjusted incomes than their white male peers,\nand female physicians of all races/ethnicities had even lower relative incomes.\nThese disparities appeared not to be narrowing; indeed, we found a trend toward\na slight widening of the sex-income gap.\nn Comparison with AMA survey. These results revealed slightly greater sex dis-\nnomic Monitoring System. Comparing white female physicians with their white\nmale counterparts, we found that female family physicians' adjusted incomes were 9\npercent lower, internists' were 19 percent lower, and pediatricians' were 18 percent\nlower.16 Using CTS data, we found that white female physicians' adjusted incomes\nwere about 20 percent lower than those of their white male peers across specialties.\nP C P E a r n i n g s\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 8 , N u m b e r 2 5 6 3\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 02, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Our analysis has several limitations. First, the number of black\nand Hispanic respondents was relatively small, particularly among women. Second,\nour findings could be spurious, simply reflecting increased numbers of female and\nblack physicians during a time period of stagnating physician incomes. However, the\nrelative consistency of findings with those of other studies, and in both the sequen-\ntial cross-sectional and longitudinal samples, makes us confident of our findings.\nThird, we did not examine other variables that might influence physicians' incomes.\nAlthough each of our regression models accounted for a minimum of 20 percent of\nthe variance in incomes, factors that were not incorporated into the analysis--such\nas the proportion of time spent in direct patient care versus other activities--might\nmitigate some of the differences we found. Finally, the longitudinal analysis covers\nonly seven years, which represents about one-fifth of a physician's working lifetime,\nand physicians of all ages were included in the analysis; however, different results\nmight be observed if physicians were followed for a longer period.\nn Trend lines. Despite these limitations, our results suggest that being female is\nconsistently associated with having lower annual incomes among PCPs, but race,\nper se, is not. And although the sex-based differences that we found are similar to\nthose found among nonprofessionals, sex-based disparities in primary care medi-\ncine do not appear to be narrowing as they are among nonprofessionals.17\nIt seems inconsistent that a profession that embraces equity as a\ncornerstone of medical quality tolerates sex-based inequity in pay.18 Female\nPCPs have achieved the same level of education, have made the same time com-\nmitment to training, and have expended the same direct and opportunity costs re-\nquired of such commitment as their male counterparts. Efforts to further elucidate\nand address the underlying causes of sex-based income differences--such as life-\nstyle choices or performance bonuses based on work hours--are warranted and\nshould be a priority for health professional organizations, particularly as more\nwomen enter the physician workforce.\nThisworkwassupportedbyVeteransAffairsHealthServicesResearchandDevelopment(HSR&D)Grantno.\nREA03-098.AmyWallacewastherecipientofaVAHealthServicesResearchAdvancedCareerDevelopment\nAwardwhilethestudywasbeingconducted.Theviewsexpressedinthispaperarethoseoftheauthorsanddonot\nnecessarilyrepresenttheviewsoftheDepartmentofVeteransAffairsoroftheU.S.government.\nNOTES\n1.
