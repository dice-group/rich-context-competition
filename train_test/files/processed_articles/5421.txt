    "abstract": "Abstract\nQualitative researchers who explore sensitive topics may expose themselves to emotional distress. Consequently, researchers\nare often faced with the challenge of maintaining emotional equilibrium during the research process. However, discussion\non the management of difficult emotions has occupied a peripheral place within accounts of research practice. With rare\nexceptions, the focus of published accounts is concentrated on the analysis of the emotional phenomena that emerge\nduring the collection of primary research data. Hence, there is a comparative absence of a dialogue around the emotional\ndimensions of working with secondary data sources. This article highlights some of the complex ways in which emotions\nenter the research process during secondary analysis, and the ways in which we engaged with and managed emotional states\nsuch as anger, sadness, and horror. The concepts of emotional labor and emotional reflexivity are used to consider the ways\nin which we \"worked with\" and \"worked on\" emotion. In doing so, we draw on our collective experiences of working on\ntwo collaborative projects with ChildLine Scotland in which a secondary analysis was conducted on children's narratives of\ndistress, worry, abuse, and neglect.\n",

However, with\nrare exceptions, the focus of published accounts is concen-\ntrated upon the analysis of emotional phenomena that emerge\nduring the collection of primary research data. Such accounts\nare focused upon the emotional challenges of research\nencounters that require interaction with research participants.\nBy comparison, there is an absence of an academic dialogue\naround the emotional dimensions of working with secondary\ndata sources (Fincham, Scourfield, & Langer, 2008). This\nmay reflect an assumption that secondary analysis lacks the\ninterpersonal context within which emotional distress can\narise (Fincham et al., 2008), the possibility that secondary\nanalysis is considered to be less emotionally demanding\n(Woodby et al., 2011), and the lack of a research culture in\nthe secondary analysis of qualitative data more generally\nGiven the absence of interaction with participants, it is not\ndifficult to understand why there has been a neglect of the\nemotional dimensions of secondary analysis or why second-\nary analysts, unlike fieldworkers, have not been presented as\n1University of Dundee, UK\n2University of Edinburgh, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nSharon Jackson, School of Education, Social Work and Community\nEducation, University of Dundee, Nethergate, Dundee, DD1 4HN,\nUnited Kingdom.\nEmail: s.a.jackson@dundee.ac.uk\nResearching Distressing Topics: Emotional\nReflexivity and Emotional Labor in the\nSecondary Analysis of Children and Young\nPeople's Narratives of Abuse\nSharon Jackson1, Kathryn Backett-Milburn2\nand Elinor Newall2\n Keywords\nsecondary analysis, emotions, emotional labor, qualitative research, child abuse\n2 SAGE Open\nresearch accounts. This article highlights some of the com-\nplex ways in which emotions enter the research process dur-\ning secondary data analysis. In doing so, we draw upon our\ncollective experiences of working on two projects in which\nsecondary analysis was conducted on both quantitative and\nqualitative data extracted from the call records of ChildLine\nScotland1 (CLS), a confidential telephone counseling service\nfor children/young people aged 18 and younger in Scotland,\nwherein children/young people's narratives of distress,\nworry, abuse, and neglect are represented. Our experiences\nof working with the qualitative data are the primary focus of\nthis article.\nThe first project examined children/young people's con-\ncerns about the health and well-being of their parents and\nsignificant others, and the second investigated children/\nyoung people's concerns about their sexual health and well-\nbeing. Both projects involved us reading and analyzing chil-\ndren/young people's accounts of physical and sexual abuse.\nThe analysis of narrative accounts in which children/young\npeople disclosed these experiences were particularly chal-\nlenging, and it is with the emotional challenges of analyzing\nthese that we reflect upon in this article.\nDuring the course of the two projects and beyond, we dis-\ncussed, wrote, and reflected upon our experiences of work-\ning with CLS data, and we draw upon these in this article. We\napproach this article as both novice and experienced research-\ners. Kathryn was the principal investigator on both projects\nand had extensive prior experience and expertise in qualita-\ntive research in the area of children and families. Sharon was\nemployed as the research fellow on the first project, and then\nas the research fellow and coinvestigator on the second proj-\nect. Elinor joined the research team during the second project\nas a research fellow when Sharon left her post to take up a\npermanent post in another institution. Sharon remained\ninvolved in the second project as a coinvestigator. Sharon\nwas responsible for the data collection and analysis task in\nthe first project and the data collection task during the second\nproject. Elinor had primary responsibility for the data analy-\nsis task during the second project. Kathryn was involved in\nmany of the analytical discussions that characterized our\n\"analytical meetings,\" and was involved in reading and\nworking with extracts of the data. For both Sharon and\nElinor, these projects represented their first academic\npositions.\nBefore moving on to describe and reflect on our experi-\nences of working with the research data, this article will\nconnect with key strands of thought in relation to emotions\nand qualitative research that have influenced our analysis.\nWe begin by locating emotion as a dimension of reflexivity.\nWe do so because the research process that we undertook\nrequired an active engagement with emotional reflexivity,\nand an "
