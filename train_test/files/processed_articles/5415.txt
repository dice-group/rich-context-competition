Research using the Wason selection task has found that people are\nadept at identifying people who are in a position to cheat (e.g., Cosmides, 1989;\nresearch has found a locus for cheater detection abilities: Patients with bilateral\nlimbic system damage affecting temporal pole and amygdala are uniquely impaired in\nreasoning about social contract versions of the selection task (Stone, Cosmides,\nIn addition to being adept at identifying individuals in a position to cheat,\nhowever, one must also be good at remembering individuals and information\nregarding their behavior in previous social exchange situations (Cosmides and Tooby,\n1989). But, what information is most important to remember? We test the following\nhypotheses:\n(1) Cheaters are remembered better than cooperators. This is suggested by two\npieces of evidence: First, it is cheaters who threaten the viability of social exchange\nbecause of the advantages of accepting benefits without paying costs (e.g., Axelrod,\ndiscovering someone cheated may be more diagnostic of their character than finding\nout they cooperated. Successful cheaters have to appear to be trustworthy, so they\nlikely have to cooperate much of the time.\n(2) Cooperators are remembered better than cheaters. People who have\ncooperated may be deemed trustworthy, and we may remember them particularly\nwell so that they can be approached first in future instances of exchange. Indeed, as\nBrown and Moore (2000) have argued, due to the problem of subtle cheating, it is\nimportant for people to be good at detecting and remembering individuals with pro-\nsocial motives (see also Brown, Palmetta and Moore, 2003).\n(3) Cheaters and cooperators are remembered equally well. Both categories may\nbe important and worth remembering, though for different reasons. We want to\nremember the cheaters because we want to avoid them in the future. We want to\nremember the cooperators because they are people that we want to approach first in\nfuture instances of social exchange. Indeed, in Brown and Moore's (2000) study,\nperformance on altruist-detection and cheater-detection versions of the Wason\nselection task were comparable, suggesting people may place equal importance on\ndetecting and remembering cheaters and cooperators.\nTwo studies present evidence relevant to these issues (Mealey, Daood, and Krage,\n1996; Oda, 1997). Specifically, both of these studies found that the faces of cheaters\nwere remembered better one week after being exposed to them than were the faces of\nthose deemed trustworthy. These studies, however, leave some important questions\nunanswered. First, they did not examine whether people were more likely to\nremember the social contract information of the cheaters. Demonstrating that the\nfaces of cheaters are more likely to be recognized does not show that people also have\nbiased access to relevant information about their character. Indeed, according to\nBruce and Young's (1986) model of face perception, recognizing an individual face is\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\na separate and dissociable component from accessing person identity and character\ninformation. Second, the studies do not examine whether the amount of resources\ninvolved in the exchange has an effect on the biased memory for cheaters. It is\npossible that differences between cooperators and cheaters emerge only when there is\na substantial amount involved in the exchange and that relatively small amounts do\nnot lead to any differences in memory for cheaters or cooperators. Third, the studies\ndid not examine the processes leading to better memory for the faces of cheaters. For\ninstance, do people spend more time looking at the faces of cheaters than the\ncooperators? Fourth, the studies did not examine how soon the bias is evident in\npeople's memory. They looked at memory one week after exposure, allowing for the\npossibility that in relatively short durations, no bias may be evident. Fifth, the studies\ndid not examine whether people are conscious of the need to remember some\nindividuals more than others. Is it a product of implicit processing, or is there also\nexplicit awareness of the relative importance of social contract information? The\npresent experiments were designed to address each of these questions.\nExperiment 1\nThis study assessed people's explicit judgments of the relative importance of\ncheaters and cooperators, and how these judgments are affected by the amount that is\ninvolved in the exchange. Specifically, participants used rating scales to indicate how\nimportant it is to remember individuals they had categorized as cheaters, cooperators,\nor neither.\nMethod\nParticipants. Forty-nine individuals participated (41 female, 8 male; mean age =\n19.74 years, ranging from 18 to 27). In this and the next experiment, all participants\nwere volunteers from introductory psychology classes at California State University,\nLong Beach, and they received extra credit added to their final grade. All were tested\nindividually.\nStimuli and apparatus. This experiment used eight social contract rules, each\nembedded in a scenario providing a context for each rule (see Figure 1 for sample\nitem). The rules were of the form \"if P then Q\", such as \"If you borrow money from\nJohn, you must make your payments on time.\" Along with each rule, participants\nreceived information about different fictional individuals. The information specified\nwhether the individuals had a) accepted a benefit and failed to pay the cost (cheaters),\nb) accepted the benefit and paid the cost (cooperators), or c) the information was\nirrelevant to the rule (neither). For the above rule, an example of irrelevant\ninformation would be \"This person went to high school with John.\" For each rule,\ninformation on six individuals was provided: two cheaters, two cooperators, and two\nneither, leading to a total of 48 individuals across the eight rules and scenarios.\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nFigure 1 Sample item\nJohn is a very successful businessman. Through his hard work, he has managed to\nbuild a very good life for himself and his family. Though he is well off, he is also\nquite generous. He is willing to help out his long-time friends by offering them\nloans with interest rates lower than those of local banks. His friends have agreed to\nborrow money from John in order to buy cars, homes, and to pay for college tuition\nfor their children. John's requirement for loaning his friends money is as follows:\nIf you borrow money from John, you must make your payments on time.\nUnfortunately, while some of his friends cooperate with the rule, others have not.\nSome decided to borrow money from him without paying it back, while others\npromptly make their payments. Your task is to determine, on the basis of the\ninformation given, which of the following individuals are cheaters, which are\ncooperators, and which are neither.\nCh1: This person borrowed $2,000 from John and didn't pay him back.\nCh2: This person borrowed $50,000 from John and didn't pay him back.\nCo1: This person borrowed $2,000 from John and paid him back.\nCo2: This person borrowed $50,000 from John and paid him back.\nN: This person went to high school with John.\nN: This person was in John's fraternity.\nN.B. The full list of items can be obtained from the first author at dchiappe@csulb.edu.\nFor the cheaters and cooperators, we manipulated the amount or resources involved in\nthe exchange (See Figure 1). The amounts used were the same for the cheater and\ncooperator conditions. In addition, participants were also shown photos of the\nindividuals. These were color photos of adult males, taken with permission from the\nUniversity of Stirling face database, and from the Purdue University face database\n(Martinez and Benavente, 1998). To not confound faces with conditions, six different\nversions of the experimental program were created, with each photo appearing in\neach of the six conditions. Furthermore, two orders were generated for each of these\nsix versions, so that participants did not always see the faces in the same order. For\neach participant, the program also generated a random order of presentation for each\nof the eight rules.\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nThe experiment was conducted on a DellTM desktop computer, running Super\nLabTM. Participants used the \"1\" key (labeled \"CH\") to classify cheaters, the \"2\" key\n(labeled \"CO\") to classify cooperators, and the \"3\" key (labeled \"N\") to classify\nsomeone as neither a cheater nor a cooperator on the basis of the information\nprovided. They used the number keys (from 1 to 7) at the top of the keyboard to\nindicate how important it is to remember a given individual.\nProcedure. Participants began by reading the instructions for the task, which\nrequired them to categorize individuals as cheaters, cooperators, or neither, on the\nbasis of the information provided, and then to indicate how important it is to\nremember those individuals, using a scale ranging from \"1\" (not at all important) to\n\"7\" (extremely important). Participants were told that the information we get about\npeople can suggest that we should remember them. This is because we may have to\ninteract with them in the future.\nEach set of trials began with the scenario presented on the computer screen,\nwritten in black against a white background. The rule appeared in the middle of the\nscenario, on a separate line. The scenario remained on screen until participants\npressed the spacebar. Then they received information about six individuals. For each\nof the six individuals, trials proceeded as follows: A box (2\u00be\" wide and 3\u00bc\" long)\nappeared in the center of the screen, with a question mark embedded inside. Beneath\nit, the information for an individual was shown. The question \"Is this person a\ncheater, cooperator, or neither?\" appeared underneath. Once participants categorized\nthe individual, a photo of him appeared. It was presented where the box-plus-question\nhad been. Underneath, the question \"How important is it to remember this person?\"\nappeared, with the seven-point rating scale below. It remained until participants\nentered a number. Information for the next individual then followed.\nResults\nPrior to analyzing the rating scale data, we examined participants' performance in\ncategorizing the individuals as cheaters, cooperators, or neither. Only participants\nwith at least 90% accuracy were included in the analyses. Two were excluded,\nleaving 47. Table 1 includes the mean rating on the seven-point scale across the\ndifferent levels of social contract status.\nResults for Experiments 1 and 2\nNote: Numbers in parentheses are standard deviations. CH = cheater, CO =\ncooperator and N = Neither. 1 = less at stake, 2 = more at stake. Means for # of faces\nand status recalled are out of a maximum of 8 for CH 1, CH 2. CO 1 and CO 2. They\nare out of 16 for the totals.\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nMean rating on\n7-point scale\nMean viewing\ntime in msec\nMean # faces\nrecognized\nMean # status\nrecalled\nA one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA with social contract status as the repeated\nhoc, pairwise comparisons with a Bonferroni adjustment revealed that all means were\nsignificantly different from each other. Thus, CH 1, CH 2, CO 1 and CO 2 all\nreceived higher ratings than N, p < .001. Furthermore, CH 2 received higher\nimportance ratings than CH 1, p < .001; CO 2 received higher ratings than CO 1, p <\n.001; both CH 1 and CH 2 received higher ratings than both CO 1 and CO 2, p <\nThis was further confirmed with a 2X2 repeated measures ANOVA with status\n(cheater vs. cooperator) and amount (lower vs. higher) as the two repeated-measures\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nbetween status and amount, F (1, 46) = 5.96, p < .05. That is, there was a greater\nincrease in importance rating for the cheaters (difference = .62 between CH 1 and CH\n2) than for the cooperators (difference = .35 between CO 1 and CO 2). Cheaters were\nrated more important to remember than cooperators and more so when a greater\namount of resources was involved.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 examined the amount of time people spend looking at the faces of\ncheaters, cooperators and those classified as neither. It also examined whether there\nare biases in memory for both the faces of individuals and for information regarding\ntheir character (i.e., whether they were cheaters, cooperators, or neither) and whether\nthe amount involved in the exchange has an effect on encoding information about\nindividuals.\nMethod\nParticipants. One hundred and twenty eight individuals participated (102 female,\nand were given one hour to complete the task.\nStimuli and apparatus. The eight scenarios, the photos, and information on the\nsocial contract status of individuals from Experiment 1 were used for part one of this\nstudy. The second part of the experiment used 96 photos, 48 from part one, and a\nsecond set of 48 photos, taken from the same face databases. The order in which the\nfaces were presented was randomized, with one random order per participant.\nBoth parts of the experiment were conducted on a DellTM desktop computer,\nrunning Super LabTM software. Responses were recorded using a 6-button response\nbox with millisecond accuracy. From left to right, the first button was red and had no\nlabel. The next two buttons were yellow and labeled \"yes\" and \"no.\" The remaining\nthree buttons were green and were labeled \"CH,\" \"CO,\" and \"N,\" representing\ncheaters, cooperators, and neither.\nProcedure. As in Experiment 1, each of eight sets of trials began with a scenario\npresented on the screen, with a rule appearing roughly in the middle of the scenario.\nThe scenarios remained on screen until participants pressed the red button on the\nresponse box. This was followed by information on six individuals that had to be\ncategorized according to their social contract status (cheater, cooperator, or neither).\nFor each of the six individuals, the trials proceeded as follows: A box appeared in the\ncenter of the screen, with a question mark embedded inside. Under the box, the\ninformation for that individual was presented. Beneath the information, the question\n\"Is this person a cheater, cooperator, or neither?\" appeared. Once participants\ncategorized the individual, a photo of the individual was shown. It was presented\nwhere the box plus question mark had been. The picture remained on the screen until\nthe participant pressed the red button. Participants were told to look at each photo for\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nas long as they wished. They were also instructed to leave their left index finger on\nthe red button throughout the first part of the experiment. Once a photo was removed\nfrom the screen, a row of seven asterisk marks appeared on the center of the screen\nfor 2500 msec, followed by the information for the next individual. Prior to doing the\nexperimental trials, subjects were given a practice scenario to make sure they knew\nwhat to do in this part of the experiment.\nAfter part one, participants were immediately given a surprise recognition memory\ntest. They saw photos of adult males, half new and half from part one. The photos\nappeared on the center of the screen. For each one, participants had to answer two\nquestions: (1) Do you recognize this person from part one? And, (2) Was this person\na cheater, cooperator, or neither? These questions appeared, one at a time, beneath\neach photo, centered horizontally on the screen. For the first question, they had to\nrespond by using the yellow buttons labeled \"yes\" and \"no,\" depending on whether\nthey recognize the person from the first part. For the second, they had to respond\nusing the green keys, labeled \"CH,\" \"CO,\" and \"N,\" depending on whether they\nremember them as cheaters, cooperators, or neither. If participants did not recognize\nthe person from part one, they were told to respond \"no\" to the second question as\nwell.\nResults\nAs in Experiment 1, only those participants that correctly categorized at least 90%\nof the individuals were included in the following analyses. This led to the exclusion\nof five participants, leaving a total of 123.\nViewing times for faces\nTable 1 lists the mean viewing times for all the faces that were correctly classified\nas cheaters, cooperators, or neither.

Though the descriptive statistics revealed greater likelihood of\nremembering social contract status when more resources were involved, this was not\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nGeneral Discussion\nThese studies examined the salience of information in social contract situations.\nWe tested three claims about the relative importance of cheaters and cooperators: (1)\nCheaters are more important to remember than cooperators, (2) Cooperators are more\nimportant to remember than cheaters, and (3) Cheaters and cooperators are equally\nimportant to remember. Our results are most consistent with the first. Experiment 1\nfound people rated cheaters more important to remember than cooperators, though\nboth were rated higher than those categorized as neither. Experiment 2 found cheaters\nwere looked at longer than cooperators, though both were looked at longer than those\nclassified as neither. People also had better memory for faces of cheaters than\ncooperators, and were more likely to remember social contract information for\ncheaters.\nWhy should cheaters be particularly salient? One reason is because cheaters\nthreaten the very viability of social exchange (e.g., Cosmides, 1989; Cosmides and\nremember individuals that accept benefits and fail to pay costs, cheaters would out-\nreproduce cooperators. Furthermore, instances of cheating may carry greater\ninformation value. If evolution works to improve the efficiency of cognitive\nmechanisms, we would expect that it would produce a cognitive system that is\nparticularly sensitive to information that has the greatest diagnostics value. In this\ncase, it should be most sensitive to information providing cues about a person's\ncharacter. Everything else being equal, knowing that a person cooperated may not tell\nus much about their character. Knowing that they cheated would be more relevant.\nThis is because cheaters have to give the appearance of being trustworthy and thus\nthey may have to cooperate much of the time.\nHowever, our results also provide some support for the view that it is important to\nremember cooperators. Cooperators were looked at longer and remembered better\nthan those judged irrelevant to the social contract situation. This suggests that people\nalso regard as important individuals displaying pro-social behavior (Brown and\nMoore, 2000). This is important because individuals need to know whom to approach\nin future instances of exchange, not just which individuals to avoid. Of course, it may\nalso be important to rely on information from other people in the form of gossip, to\navoid the problem that even cheaters often have to cooperate (Emler, 1990, 1992).\nThe present studies also found that people can make conscious judgments of the\nrelative importance of remembering cheaters and cooperators. This was revealed in\nExperiment 1, where explicit judgments of importance were assessed. This suggests\npeople can strategically implement encoding strategies that increase the likelihood of\nremembering different individuals. For instance, by knowing that they want to\nremember the cheaters, people can decide to spend more time looking at their faces\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nrelative to individuals with a different social contract status. This is what we found in\nExperiment 2.\nOur studies also examined whether the amount of resources involved in the\nexchange has an effect on the relative importance of remembering cheaters and\ncooperators. One would expect that any differences in importance between the two\nshould be particularly evident when there is more to lose or gain in an exchange.\nWhen trivial amounts are involved, the relative difference in importance between\ncheaters and cooperators may be negligible. The amount involved in the exchange\ncould also affect the actions that a person takes in dealing with cheaters. As Cosmides\nand Tooby (1989) put it, \"When you believe that I have cheated you in a major way,\nthere should be a flood of memories about your past history with me: You must\ndecide whether it is worth your while to continue our relationship\" (p. 63). Thus, do\nyou give a person another chance, or do you exclude them outright from all future\nexchange? The extent of the infraction likely plays an important role in this regard.\nThe first study found that people gave higher important-to-remember ratings when\na greater amount was involved. However, the results of the second experiment failed\nto find an effect of amount. Thus, people's conscious intentions did not turn into\nlonger viewing times, and did not turn into a greater likelihood of remembering the\nindividuals. Though the descriptive statistics were in that direction, the results were\nnot significant. This could be due to the high amounts of variance observed in the\nviewing times. High variance can have the effect of eliminating any differences\nobserved between experimental conditions. By contrast, the data in the first\nexperiment were obtained using a 7-point rating scale. By its very nature, this\nconstrains much of the variance, making it more likely that an effect will be\nsignificant. At any rate, further research will be required to address this issue.\nAnother interesting discovery of the present study has to do with how quickly the\neffects on memory are evident. Previous studies have found differences in memory\nbetween cheaters and cooperators with a delay of a week between first exposure to\nthe faces and subsequent attempts at recognition (Mealey, Daood, and Krage, 1996;\nOda, 1997). These studies, however, did not examine whether those biases are\nevident after only a short delay. Indeed, one might expect that in the short run, no bias\nwould be evident because the individuals would be relatively fresh in memory.\nInterestingly, however, a bias in remembering the cheaters was evident shortly after\nthe individuals were first seen. Thus, cheaters stand out right away, more so than do\npeople exhibiting pro-social behavior. Future research will have to determine whether\ndifferences between cheaters and cooperators get larger with time or remain constant.\nImportantly, the memory bias was evident not just in terms of face recognition, but\nalso with respect to the social contract status. The studies by Mealey, Daood, and\nKrage (1996) and Oda (1997) found biased face recognition for cheaters, but did not\nexamine whether there are differences in the likelihood of remembering that the\ncheaters were cheaters compared to remembering that the cooperators were\ncooperators. As noted above, however, one must not only be able to recognize many\ndifferent individuals, one must also be able to recall how those individuals behaved in\nCheaters Are Looked At Longer and Remembered Better Than Cooperators in Social Exchange\nSituations\nsocial contract situations. This is crucial for deciding whether or not to channel future\nresources to an individual. Our studies suggest that biases in memory also extend to\nthe information regarding the individual's character.\nTo conclude, though much research has shown people are good at identifying\npotential violators of social contract rules, the present study shows that people are\nadept at remembering the information that carries the greatest diagnostic value in\nsocial exchange. People are particularly good at remembering the faces of cheaters,\nand that these individuals violated social contract rules, compared to other social\ncontract information. Moreover, our results suggest that this may be accomplished at\nleast in part by spending a greater amount of time looking at the faces of these\nindividuals.\nReferences\nAxelrod, R. (1984).
