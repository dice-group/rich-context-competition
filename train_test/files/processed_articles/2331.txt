The objective of\nthis study was to determine whether the overuse and mis-\nuse of health care services in the ambulatory setting has\ndecreased in the past decade.\nNational Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the out-\npatient department component of the National Hospital\nAmbulatory Medical Care Survey, which are nationally\nrepresentative annual surveys of visits to non\u00adfederally\nfunded ambulatory care practices. We applied 22 qual-\nity indicators using a combination of current quality mea-\nsures and guideline recommendations. The main out-\ncome measures were the rates of underuse, overuse, and\nmisuse and their 95% CIs.\nResults: We observed a statistically significant improve-\nment in 6 of 9 underuse quality indicators. There was\nan improvement in the use of antithrombotic therapy for\natrial fibrillation; the use of aspirin, -blockers, and stat-\nins in coronary artery disease; the use of -blockers in\ncongestive heart failure; and the use of statins in diabe-\ntes mellitus. We observed an improvement in only 2 of\n11 overuse quality indicators, 1 indicator became worse,\nand 8 did not change. There was a statistically signifi-\ncant decrease in the overuse of cervical cancer screen-\ning in visits for women older than 65 years and in the\noveruse of antibiotics in asthma exacerbations. How-\never, there was an increase in the overuse of prostate can-\ncer screening in men older than 74 years. Of the 2 mis-\nuse indicators, there was a decrease in the proportion of\npatients with a urinary tract infection who were pre-\nscribed an inappropriate antibiotic.\nConclusions: We found significant improvement in the\ndelivery of underused care but more limited changes in\nthe reduction of inappropriate care. With the high cost\nof health care, these results are concerning.\nhealth care, policymak-\ners are increasingly in-\nterestedinidentifyingthe\ninefficiencies in our\nhealth care system.1 In an analysis of the\nestimated $700 billion that is wasted an-\nnually in our health care system, over-\nuse, or the delivery of services for which\nthe risks exceed the benefits, has been\nidentified as a significant component,\nequaling roughly $280 billion.2 Interest in\noveruse has started to gain traction, no-\ntably by physician leaders. Several na-\ntional physician groups have tackled the\noveruse of screening and diagnostic test-\ning, identifying many common scenarios\nin which services have low value and high\ncost.3,4 Research has confirmed that over-\nuse is widespread and occurs across mul-\ntiple specialties.5,6\nAssessments of the current state of our\nhealth care system typically examine 1 of\n3 interrelated dimensions of quality: struc-\nture (the characteristics of the resources\nof the health care system), process (inter-\nactions between clinicians and patients),\nand outcomes (changes in patients' health\nstatus).7 Evaluations of process measures\ndominate quality improvement because\nthey are activities that clinicians control\nmost directly. Process measures can be\nfurther categorized into overuse, under-\nuse, and misuse. Overuse represents the\ndelivery of health care for which the risks\noutweigh the benefits (eg, use of an anti-\nbiotic to treat viral respiratory syn-\ndromes); underuse represents the failure\nto deliver health care for which the ben-\nefits outweigh the risks (eg, use of an as-\npirin in patients with coronary disease);\nand misuse is the delivery of the wrong care\n(eg, use of an antibiotic other than nitro-\nFor editorial comment\nsee page 93 Author Affil\nGeneral Inte\nDepartment\nSinai School\nKale and Fed\nDivision of O\nEffectivenes\nPublic Healt\nWeill Corne\n(Dr Bishop)\nYork; and Di\nInternal Med\nof Medicine\nCalifornia (D\nSan Francisc\nHospital (Dr\nFrancisco, C\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of\nGeneral Internal Medicine,\nDepartment of Medicine,\nMt Sinai School of Medicine\n(Drs Kale and Federman), and\nDivision of Outcomes and\nEffectiveness, Departments of\nPublic Health and Medicine,\nWeill Cornell Medical College\n(Dr Bishop), New York,\nNew York; and Division of\nGeneral Internal Medicine,\nDepartment of Medicine,\nUniversity of California\n(Dr Keyhani), and\nSan Francisco Veterans Affairs\nHospital (Dr Keyhani),\nSan Francisco, California.\n\u00a92013 American Medical Association.

Understanding the relation-\nship of changes in underuse to overuse and misuse helps\nto characterize the state of our evolving health care sys-\ntem, particularly with respect to the quality of care de-\nlivered and the growing costs associated with care. In this\nstudy, we apply the quality framework of underuse, over-\nuse, and misuse to a nationally representative sample of\npatients cared for in ambulatory care settings to deter-\nmine whether the overuse and misuse of health care ser-\nvices have decreased in the past decade.\nMETHODS\nWe performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from the\nSurvey (NAMCS) and the outpatient department component\nof the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey\n(NHAMCS). The NAMCS and NHAMCS are nationally repre-\nsentative surveys conducted annually by the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health\nStatistics. The NAMCS surveys patient visits to physicians in\nnon\u00adfederally funded, non\u00adhospital-based offices; the NHAMCS\nsurveys patient visits to physicians in non\u00adfederally funded hos-\npital outpatient departments. The visits sampled take place dur-\ning a 1-week period that is randomly assigned for each prac-\ntice (a 4-week sample period is used in NHAMCS). We pooled\nsample sizes.\nBoth surveys use a multistage stratified probability sam-\npling design that allows for the generation of national esti-\nmates on the patient-visit level. Information collected in both\nsurveys includes the visit characteristics, diagnoses, medica-\ntions, and services ordered.\nWe developed our quality indicators using a combination of\ncurrent performance measures and guideline recommenda-\ntions (Table 1). Each indicator was chosen because it per-\ntained to outpatient quality of care and could be reliably cal-\nculated using information in the NAMCS and NHAMCS in the\nstudy years. We identified 22 measures, which we organized\ninto 1 of 3 categories: underuse, overuse, or misuse (Table 1)\nof health care services.9-31 Although in some cases we applied\nguideline recommendations that were published after 1999 or\nafter 2009, this approach allowed for comparative assess-\nments of the quality of care over time and is consistent with\nprevious examinations of quality using NAMCS and NHAMCS.8\nFor each indicator, we identified the eligible population (de-\nnominator) using a combination of variables: patient's reason\nfor the visit, the diagnosis (classified using the International Clas-\nsification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification di-\nagnostic codes), and the diagnosis check-boxes (owing to\nchanges in survey design, this variable was not used to iden-\nWe excluded patient visits on the basis of clinical contraindi-\ncations. For example, we were interested in examining the ex-\ntent to which patients with atrial fibrillation are prescribed an-\nticoagulation, on the basis of a quality measure developed by\nthe American College of Cardiology, American Heart Associa-\ntion, and American Medical Association Physician Consor-\ntium for Performance Improvement.9 We constructed the de-\nnominator for this quality indicator by identifying all visits by\npatients with documented atrial fibrillation who did not have\na contraindication to anticoagulation, such as a diagnosis of gas-\ntrointestinal bleeding. We then measured the proportion of vis-\nits in which the patients were prescribed anticoagulation. Medi-\ncations were identified using a combination of the medication\ncodes developed by the National Center for Health Statistics\nand the Multum Lexicon Plus database.32\nFor each measure, we calculated the weighted proportion of\neligible visits in which the patient received recommended care\nor, in the case of our overuse and misuse measures, the weighted\nproportion of eligible visits in which the patient received non-\nrecommended care. We then used the 2 test to compare dif-\nWe took into account the sampling weights and sample de-\nsign variables available in NAMCS and NHAMCS to generate\nthese weighted, nationally representative estimates.

Our findings of\nthe continued delivery of inappropriate care, such as the\nuse of prostate-specific antigen testing in older men and\ncervical cancer screening in older women, are consis-\ntent with other studies34,35 that demonstrate the persis-\ntence of inappropriate care. Our results also suggest that\nthere has been little change in the delivery of inappro-\npriate ambulatory care in the past decade.\nGiven the questionable sustainability of the current\ntrajectory of health care costs, our findings uniquely in-\nform the discussion of strategies to improve the quality\nof health care, particularly as solutions are analyzed with\nan eye on their affordability and financial impact. We\nfound considerable room for improvement in most of our\noveruse measures, a space in which the dual goals of high\nquality and reduced costs can be met, and demon-\nstrated that attention to underuse and overuse has been\nuneven. The United States has a higher total expendi-\nture on health relative to its gross domestic product com-\npared with all other countries.36 Although there is con-\ntinuing debate about what constitutes a reasonable cost\nof health care, there is growing momentum in deliver-\ning higher quality care that costs less. Reducing inap-\npropriate care where patients clearly do not benefit and\nfor which there may be added risk is certainly part of this\nThere are several possible explanations for our find-\nings; however, among the most likely is that targeting and\nreducing inappropriate care has not been a real focus of\nthe quality of care movement. In the past 2 decades, there\nhas been substantial growth in methods to measure qual-\nity in health care. These quality measures have devel-\noped alongside the growing understanding that medi-\ncine can and should be delivered on the basis of evidence.\nUsing a combination of information from clinical trials\nand observational studies, panels of expert physicians have\ncreated clinical practice guidelines, a repository of which\nis maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and\nQuality.38 The creation of clinical practice guidelines has\ninformed the development of metrics to assess the qual-\nity of our health care system.39 Although quality assess-\nments are dominated by process-based measures, these\nhave mostly taken the form of underuse measures.
