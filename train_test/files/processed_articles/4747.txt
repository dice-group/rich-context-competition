SRP was the only treatment for\nperiodontal disease. Despite recently devel-\noped techniques, SRP remains the most\nimportant part of periodontal disease treat-\nment.1 The classic devices used for root\nsurface debridement are oscillating scalers\nand hand instruments.2,3 The beneficial\neffects of scalers and hand instruments\ncombined with personal plaque control in\npatients undergoing SRP have been verified.\nThese benefits include reduction of clinical\ninflammation, microbial shifts to a less\npathogenic subgingival flora, a decreased\nprobing depth (PD), and increased clinical\nattachment. However, as the pocket depth\nincreases, the efficiency of plaque elimin-\nation may decrease.4 Dragoo5 and Clifford\net al.6 assessed traditional and `microultra-\nsonic' scaling tips with respect to their\ncapacity to achieve the most apical extension\nof the periodontal pockets; however, they\nobtained contradictory results. Dragoo5\nreported that only a few of the instruments\nreached the most apical depth of the pocket.\nIn contrast, Clifford et al.6 reported that\nboth types of scaling tips could reach and\ndebride dental plaque in pockets with depths\nof 4 to 6 mm and 7 mm. The literature\ncontains various reports supporting success-\nful long-term maintenance following trad-\nitional air-polishing treatment.4\nDental plaque progresses from aerobic,\ngram-positive colonisation to anaerobic col-\nonisation favouring gram-negative growth.\nAs bacterial plaque develops, the oxygen\nlevel drops to zero, favouring decreased\noxygen conditions and the production of\nodoriferous volatiles.7 Oxygen is consumed\nby bacteria that utilise oxygen to oxidise\nsubstrates (anaerobes) from saliva and gin-\ngival fluid. Studies have suggested that peri-\nodontitis increases the severity of halitosis.8\nThe bleeding tendency of the periodontal\ntissues may supply fundamental substrates\nfor odour production. When periodontal\ntissues are inflamed, they provide more\nmethionine, which is changed into methyl\nmercaptan at a higher rate than in healthy\ngingival tissues. The increased gingival\ncrevicular fluid flow in the presence of\nperiodontitis may be a constant source of\nmethionine. Increased salivary putrefaction\nmay occur due to a higher concentration of\ndisintegrated epithelial cells.9 A few reviews\nhave suggested that the production of vola-\ntile sulphur compounds (VSCs) by these\ngram-negative bacteria may contribute to\nthe improvement of periodontal disease via\nbreakdown of the oral mucosa, prompting\nbacterial invasion.10\nAir polishing using a conventional air-\npolishing device with fine-grain (DV90:\n63 mm) glycine powder aimed directly into\nthe periodontal pocket has been demon-\nstrated to be efficacious and safe for remov-\ning the subgingival biofilm in periodontal\npockets. In one study, glycine powder air-\npolishing (GPAP) reduced the total viable\nbacterial counts in periodontal pockets with\nPDs ranging from 3 to 5 mm and to a\nsignificantly greater extent than SRP using\ncurettes.11 However, no studies have inves-\ntigated the efficacy of using GPAP adjunc-\ntively with SRP in the treatment of halitosis.\nTherefore, the aim of this clinical study was\nto evaluate the effect of using GPAP\nadjunctively with SRP on periodontal par-\nameters and halitosis.\nMaterials and methods\nIn the present trial, 60 patients (age range,\nteeth with 4- to 6-mm periodontal pockets\nwere recruited from patients undergoing\nperiodontal treatment at the Department\nof Periodontology of our institution. The\nexclusion criteria were acute infectious oral\nlesions, furcation defects, use of antibiotics\nfor any reason within the last 4 weeks,\nperiodontal treatment within the last 6\nmonths, and pregnancy or lactation.\nPatient standardisation\nAll patients were instructed to avoid spicy\nfood containing ingredients such as garlic,\nonions, and peppers as well as alcoholic\ndrinks and mouthwashes for 2 days prior to\nhalimetry. On the day of the examination,\nthe patients were instructed to avoid coffee,\ncandy, chewing gum, breath mints, per-\nfumes, deodorants, shampoos, creams, and\nscented moisturisers. They were also advised\nto have breakfast at least 2 h and no more\nthan 4 h before the examination.\nPeriodontal examination\nThe plaque index (PI),12 gingival index\n(GI),13 clinical attachment level (CAL),\nPD, position of the gingival margin, and\nbleeding on probing (BOP) were measured\nat baseline and 1 month after treatment by a\nsingle calibrated examiner who was not\naware of the type of treatment applied.\nThe PI, GI, PD, position of the gingival\nmargin, and BOP were evaluated with a\nperiodontal probe at six sites on all teeth.\nBOP was assessed by the percentage of sites\nthat bled after probing.\nEvaluation of VSCs\nA portable sulphide monitor (Halimeter,\n#RH17K; Interscan Corp., Chatsworth,\nCA, USA) was used to assess the VSC\nlevels. Measurements using the Halimeter\nwere taken according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Three Halimeter readings were\ntaken, and the calculated average was rec-\norded as ppd. Halimeter measurements were\nperformed at baseline, immediately after\nStudy design\nThis was a computer-randomised, single-\nblind, controlled clinical study. After being\ngiven verbal information about the treat-\nment plan and potential discomforts\nand risks, the patients who provided written\ninformed consent were included in the\nstudy. The study protocol and related\nconsent forms were approved by the\nEthics Committee of Near East University\nviously undergone and completed initial\nperiodontal therapy. The patients were\ndivided into two groups. In the control\ngroup, SRP was performed using an ultra-\nsonic scaler (Piezon Master 700; Electro\nMedical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland) and\nhand instrumentation. In the test group, in\naddition to SRP with ultrasonic and hand\ninstrumentation, GPAP (Air-Flow Perio\nPowder; Electro Medical Systems) was per-\nformed for 10 seconds per periodontal\npocket using a Perio-Flow device (Air-\nFlow Master; Electro Medical Systems).\nStatistical analysis\nThe mean values of the clinical parameters\nwere calculated for all groups. One-way\nrepeated analysis of variance was used to\nevaluate the changes in VSC values over\ntime within the groups. Post hoc compari-\nsons were performed using Tukey's test\nwhen significance was detected. A t-test\nwas used for comparison among groups\nat each time point. Changes in periodontal\nparameters after treatment were assessed\nby paired t-tests in dependent groups.\nValues of P < 0.05 were considered statistic-\nally significant.\nResults\nAll 60 patients completed the 1-month study\nperiod. The changes in the PI, GI, PD, BOP,\nand CAL in the control and test groups are\npresented in Table 1. In both groups, the PI,\nGI, PD, BOP, and CAL gain scores were\nsignificantly lower at 1 month than at base-\nline. However, there were no significant\ndifferences in the PI, GI, PD, BOP, or\nCAL at the intragroup comparisons. The\nchanges in the VSC values in both groups\nare presented in Table 2. The VSC values\nwere significantly different between baseline\nand 1 month in both groups. However,\nthe intergroup comparisons of the VSC\nvalues showed no significant differences at\nany time point.\nDiscussion\nDental plaque in the periodontal pocket and\non the root surface was recently shown\nto cause changes in biological structure.\nBacterial exotoxins that penetrate the root\nsurface, antibody complexes, and microbial\nmetabolism lead to these changes.14 The\nefficacy of periodontal therapy is directly\nrelated to the percentage of bacteria in\nthe pocket.15 Mechanical debridement con-\nstitutes the initial and arguably most critical\nmethod of managing inflammatory peri-\nodontal disease. Based on measurable end-\npoints, mechanical debridement is generally\nrecognised for its effectiveness. These\nendpoints include CAL, PD, BOP, and\nalterations in the subgingival microflora.4\nEffective root surface debridement is diffi-\ncult to perform because of anatomic limi-\ntations.16 Therefore, the use of GPAP\nmay simplify periodic subgingival instru-\nmentation and may be an alternative to\nthe conventional techniques of subgingival\nThe present study revealed that mechan-\nical instrumentation and GPAP had the\nsame effect on PI scores when used in\nperiodontal pockets with moderate PDs.\nSimilarly, Flemmig et al.17 showed that\nhand instrumentation and GPAP had the\nsame effect on PI when used in periodontal\npockets with PDs of up to approximately 3\nTable 1.

Halimeter volatile sulphur compound values.\nBaseline\nImmediately after\nDifferent superscript letters indicate statistical significance in the intragroup comparisons (P < 0.05) by Tukey's t-test.\nThe intergroup comparisons of volatile sulphur compounds showed no significant differences at any time point.\nBecause the use of low-abrasive powder\nled to a significantly higher reduction in\nsubgingival bacteria than hand instrumen-\ntation, it may be speculated that the clinical\noutcomes of periodontal maintenance ther-\napy using subgingival air polishing may be\nequivalent to or even better than the clinical\noutcomes of conventional modes of debride-\nment.18 In our study, the PD and BOP\nscores decreased in both groups, but the\ndifference between the groups was not stat-\nistically significant. Similarly, Mu\nalso found a significant decrease in the PD\nand BOP in their ultrasonic and Perio-Flow\ngroups when used with SRP at 3-month\nintervals, but no significant difference was\nfound between the two groups. GPAP has\nbeen shown to be more efficient in debriding\ndeep periodontal sites than SRP using\ncurettes. The mean time needed to treat\none deep periodontal site was 0.5 minutes\nfor GPAP alone compared with 1.4 minutes\nfor SRP.20 Our results suggest that some of\nthe classic methods are already sufficient\nbecause the pocket depths in the study were\nmoderately deep.\nSome researchers have found that\nintraoral bacteria metabolise desquamated\nepithelial cells and blood cells, leading to the\nproduction of VSCs from cysteine and\nmethionine and thus increasing the VSC\nscores parallel to an increase in the gingival\nbleeding scores.21\u00ad23 Many studies have also\nshown that periodontal diseases cause an\nincrease in VSC values, which then decrease\nafter periodontal treatment.24 In the present\nstudy, the decrease in halitosis values was\nstatistically significant at the end of treat-\nment in both groups.\nTonzetich25 reported that VSC produc-\ntion is associated with the periodontal\npocket depth and the presence of deep\nperiodontal pockets. A periodontal pocket\nis an ideal environment for VSC formation\nwith respect to current bacterial profiles\nand sulphur sources.7 The amount of\nVSCs in the mouth increases in proportion\nto the depth of the periodontal pockets.\nKoshimune et al.26 found a statistically\nsignificant relationship between VSC values\nand the presence of periodontal pocket\ndepths of >4 mm and BOP. In another\nstudy, hydrogen sulphide production in\nperiodontal pockets was semi-quantitatively\nmeasured and found to have a positive\ncorrelation between the periodontal pocket\ndepth and the amount of hydrogen sul-\nphide.27 In the present study, both treatment\nmodalities resulted in a significant reduction\nin VSC values, and the PD was found to\nbe significant. Another study by Morita\nand Wang7 revealed a statistically significant\ndifference between halitosis and BOP.\nSo\n\u00a8 der et al.28 reported a positive correlation\namong halitosis, poor oral hygiene, peri-\nodontal disease, and BOP. No study has\ninvestigated the efficacy of GPAP in halitosis\ntreatment; thus, we could not conduct a\ncomparison. Additionally, the use of GPAP\nfor deep periodontal pockets may be more\neffective in the treatment of halitosis, but\nfurther information is needed.\nConclusion\nOur results suggest that there is a positive\ncorrelation between halitosis and periodon-\ntal disease. Within the limits of the present\nstudy, SRP is effective in the treatment of\nperiodontitis and halitosis; however, using\nGPAP adjunctively with mechanical instru-\nmentation has no beneficial effects on hali-\ntosis and periodontal parameters.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
