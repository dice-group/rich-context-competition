The latter\nis of interest for a broad range of research. Nationally\nrepresentative estimates of the intake of drinking water,\ncombined with estimates of moisture intake from food\nand other beverages, were used in developing the Dietary\nReference Intakes for total water for the USA and\nCanada(1). In the literature, many studies consider drink-\ning water in its role as a vehicle for water-borne nutrients,\nchemical contaminants and micro-organisms(2,3); others\nfocus on the benefits of consuming water rather than\nother beverages (e.g. reference (4)).\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services have a long\nhistory of collecting intake information on all types of\nwater. The two Departments have partnered in dietary\nintake data collection since 2002, conducting the survey\nWhat We Eat in America (WWEIA) as the dietary intake\ninterview component of the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES). The 24 h dietary recall\nmethod used in WWEIA is the USDA five-step Automated\nMultiple-Pass Method (AMPM)(5). The addition of the\ncollection of drinking water intake data to the AMPM\nrecall via food-frequency type questions which asked\nthe respondent to estimate the total amounts of tap and\nbottled water consumed the previous day. Based upon a\ncomprehensive review of water consumption studies, an\ninternational panel concluded that a diary is the preferred\nmethod for collection of water intake data, but that if a\ndiary is not feasible then a 24 h recall method \u00ad rather\nthan an FFQ \u00ad is the best alternative for obtaining valid,\ncomplete water intake reports(3).\nCertain research questions require either comparing or\ncombining data from multiple NHANES cycles. For example,\ntrends analysis, by definition, compares variables of interest\nacross time. The NHANES analytic guidelines strongly\nrecommend that researchers who wish to analyse data for\nspecific demographic sub-domains (e.g. by race/ethnicity\nwithin age/gender group) combine data from consecutive\ntwo-year cycles in order to produce estimates with greater\nstatistical reliability(6).

Because of the\nof drinking water intake with earlier estimates is of interest.\nAlthough a few studies have analysed current US intake\ndata collected using this new methodology(7\u00ad10), no study\nto date has reported intakes of total drinking, tap and\nbottled water for all age and gender groups.\nThe goals of the present study were twofold: for indi-\nviduals aged $1 year, (i) to provide updated national\nestimates of total drinking, tap and bottled water collected\nestimates with estimates based on data collected in\nMethods\nSample\nWater intake estimates presented are based on data from\n8437 individuals aged $1 year who provided one com-\nplete day of dietary recall data in WWEIA/NHANES\nof water estimates across survey cycles was carried out\nusing the data sets immediately before and after the\nmethodological change in order to minimize the effect of\ntime on water consumption patterns. Earlier data used for\ncomparisons are from 8249 individuals the same age\nwere designed to be representative of the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized US population, with oversampling of per-\nnon-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans and pregnant\nwomen to improve accuracy of related estimates(13,14). The\ndata and accompanying documentation are available online\nfor both surveys(11,12). Breast-feeding children and pregnant\nand lactating females were excluded from all analyses.\nWater intake data\nIn the present study, the term `total drinking water' refers\nto the sum of tap water plus plain bottled water (i.e. bottled\nwater without added sweetener or carbonation) that was\nconsumed as a beverage. Water consumed as a component\nof another beverage or food (such as that contained in\nbottled drinks, used in brewing coffee or added when\nreconstituting condensed soup) is excluded.\nmation on tap and plain bottled water was collected after\nthe 24 h recall, and information on sweetened water was\ncollected during the 24 h recall(12,15). In general, tap and\nplain bottled water questions resembled food-frequency\nquestions in that the respondent was asked to give a\nsingle estimate of total consumption for the day (Table 2).\nare collected during the 24h recall in the same manner as\nfor all other beverages and foods(5,11,16). Item-specific\ninformation (such as type, amount, time and name of eating\noccasion, etc.) that is obtained about foods and non-water\nbeverages is now also captured for drinking water.\nStatistical analyses\nAnalyses were carried out using the statistical software\npackages SAS release 9?1?3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)\nand SUDAAN release 9?0 (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC, USA). SUDAAN was used to\nadjust for survey design effects resulting from NHANES'\ncomplex, multistage, probability sampling(6,17,18).\nTwo-sided t tests were used to detect differences\nlowing variables: (i) percentage of individuals reporting\nany plain water; (ii) mean intake of total plain water; (iii)\npercentages reporting specific water types (tap, bottled);\nand (iv) mean intake of each water type. Dietary sample\nweights were applied in all analyses to produce nationally\nrepresentative estimates.\nResults\nThe percentages of individuals reporting total drinking\nwater, tap water and plain bottled water on any given day\nUSA reported drinking some water.

For total plain drinking water, no differ-\nmean intakes per person. Men aged $71 years had a\nno significant differences in estimates of plain bottled\nwater intake per person for any of the age/gender groups.\nDiscussion\nTwenty-four hour recalls are preferable to FFQ for\nobtaining valid, complete water intake reports(3). USDA's\nAMPM (the 24 h recall method used in WWEIA) has been\ncalled the `current state-of-the-art 24-hour dietary recall\ninstrument'(19). Although the validity of the AMPM as a\ncollection instrument for intakes of drinking water per se\nhas not been tested, research has shown that the AMPM\nestimates energy intakes more accurately than FFQ do(20).\nAs shown by validation in doubly labelled water studies, the\nAMPM yields very accurate, unbiased energy estimates for\nhighly motivated subjects(20), although reporting bias is still\npossible among less motivated respondents and individuals\nclassified as overweight or obese(5).\nThe AMPM addresses the known issue of under-\nreporting in intake surveys, having undergone extensive\nmethodological testing to enhance food recall and thus\nspecific mentions (probes) of water were incorporated\ninto AMPM questions in order to encourage respondents\nto remember to report it. Water is included in both the\nintroductory question (`Please tell me everything you had\nto eat and drink .. even snacks, coffee, soft drinks, water\n[italics added], and alcoholic beverages') and the final\nquestion (`Do you remember anything else you drank,\nincluding water (italics added) y') of the AMPM(16).\nPortion estimation aids including household cups, mugs\nand glasses and a detailed USDA Food Model Booklet are\nemployed to help respondents estimate amounts con-\nsumed, a technique recommended to enhance water\nintake accuracy(3). Additional features of the AMPM that\nencourage complete reporting are its administration by\ntrained interviewers and the collection of the first day's\nintake (as used in the present analysis) in person(11,12).\nTable 2 Drinking water questions and variables in What We Eat in America/National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003\u00ad2004\nType of water included and questions related to:\nYear Post-recall daily total water intake data 24 h recall data- for each report of consuming water\ncarbonated water, seltzer water, club soda, and\ncarbonated bottled water such as Perrier?

In general, 24 h recall data include a USDA food code identifying the type of water\nconsumed, the amount consumed, the amounts of nutrients provided, the time and name of the eating occasion, and whether the water was consumed in\ncombination with other foods.\nDownloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Increased\nsales of unsweetened carbonated (sparkling), flavoured\nand enhanced waters during this time period(23) are\nunlikely to explain the lower percentages reporting tap\nrespondents who reported these kinds of water was very\nfactors could explain some of the observed differences in\nreporting between the survey periods. For example, a\ndrought in the Southeast USA during 2005 through the\nwater consumption behaviour in that region during the\nchange might explain the differences in intake estimates,\nthe AMPM's demonstrated performance in collecting\ncomplete food intake data(5) makes it highly unlikely that\ncollecting water data via the AMPM would result in\nincreased under-reporting. Rather, the opposite is more\nlikely: namely, that less over-reporting of tap water\ncollected via AMPM than in the earlier survey period\nwhen they were collected via FFQ-type questions.\nOne conclusion that can be drawn from the differences\nin percentages of individuals reporting water and in mean\nmay be inappropriate to combine data from older survey\ncycles with newer data, at least for some age/gender\ngroups. Trends analysis of water intake data may be\ncontraindicated as well, given the (possible) impact of\nthis methodological change. The findings of the present\nstudy illustrate the importance of careful examination of\nsurvey variables before either conducting trends analysis\nor combining data from multiple WWEIA/NHANES sur-\nvey cycles. Despite these caveats, these data provide\nbenchmark estimates of drinking water intake in the USA;\ninvaluable information that is appropriate to use to\naddress a myriad of research questions.\nResearchers should note the analytic benefits afforded\nby the new method of collecting water data using the\nAMPM. Among these benefits, the most evident is that\nthe WWEIA/NHANES total nutrient intake data files\nnow include drinking water's contribution not only to\nmoisture, but also to the nutrients Ca, Cu, Mg, Na and Zn.\nAdditionally, this methodological change has greatly\nextended the array of variables that are available for\nanalyses involving water beyond its nutrient contribu-\ntions. Data for each report of tap or plain bottled water\nnow include a USDA food code identifying the type of\nwater consumed, the amount (in grams) consumed on\nthat occasion, the intake day of the week, the main lan-\nguage in which the interview was conducted, the time\neach eating occasion began, the name by which the\nrespondent referred to the eating occasion (breakfast,\nsnack, etc.), whether the water was consumed at home or\nnot, and (for bottled water only) where it was obtained(11).\nThis additional information provides new possibilities for\nexamining water consumption patterns.\n"
