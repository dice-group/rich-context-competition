The\nauthors had three study objectives. Firstly, they examined mortality rates by both individual level SES\n(measured by income, education, and occupational/employment status) and neighbourhood level SES\n(index of neighbourhood income/wealth, educational attainment, occupational status, and\nemployment status). Secondly, they examined whether neighbourhood SES was associated with mor-\ntality after controlling for individual SES. Thirdly, they calculated the population attributable risk to esti-\nmate the reduction in mortality rates if all women and men lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods.\n(neighbourhood proxy) and mortality data through 1997.\nMain results: Mortality rates for all six gender and racial/ethnic groups were two to four times higher\nfor those with the lowest incomes (lowest quartile) who lived in the lowest SES neighbourhoods (lowest\ntertile) compared with those with the highest incomes who lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods. For\nthe six groups, the age adjusted mortality risk associated with living in the lowest SES neighbourhoods\nranged from 1.43 to 1.61. The mortality risk decreased but remained significant (p values <.05) after\nadjusting for each of the three individual measures of SES, with the exception of Mexican-American\nwomen. Furthermore, the mortality risk associated with living in the lowest SES neighbourhoods\nremained significant after simultaneously adjusting for all three individual measures of SES for white\nmen (p<0.001) and white women (p<0.05). Deaths would hypothetically be reduced by about 20%\nfor each subgroup if everyone had the same death rates as those living in the highest SES neighbour-\nhoods (highest tertile).\nConclusions: Living in a low SES neighbourhood confers additional mortality risk beyond individual\nThe importance of neighbourhoods in our life cycles has\nlong been observed. Over 30 years ago Rossi noted that our\nneighbourhoods provide the medical facilities in which\nwe are born, the schools in which we are taught, the housing\nin which we live, the social milieu in which we set up our\nhouseholds, the factories and businesses where we find work,\nand finally the cemeteries where we are buried.1 While factors\nbeyond our neighbourhoods also affect our lives, the local\ncommunity plays an important part in shaping our daily\nexperiences and is the setting in which many social, economic,\nand political policies have an impact.2\nIt is logical that the neighbourhood socioeconomic environ-\nment plays an important part in our health. This may occur, in\npart, via access to goods and services (for example, education\nand employment opportunities; price, availability, and quality\nof goods and services), norms and values, and the physical\nenvironment (for example, air and water quality). Despite the\nfact that neighbourhoods, as well as people, are stratified\nalong socioeconomic lines, surprisingly few studies have\nfocused on the role of the neighbourhood environment in\nshaping the health of its residents. Studies have more\ncommonly focused on how individual socioeconomic charac-\nteristics influence health.3\u00ad8 However, there is a growing\nconsensus that socioeconomic characteristics of neighbour-\nhoods may influence both the socioeconomic status (SES) and\nhealth of its residents.\nFindings from historical and contemporary epidemiological\nstudies that have examined individual SES and mortality have\nconsistently shown that women and men with low SES,\nregardless of how it is measured, have higher death rates than\ntheir higher SES counterparts.8\u00ad11 Recent studies have exam-\nined neighbourhood SES and mortality, focusing on the\nbroader social context within which health related behav-\niours, decisions, and events occur. Findings from these studies\nindicate that neighbourhood SES is associated with individual\nlevel mortality, independent of individual SES.9 12\u00ad21 This\nsuggests that characteristics of places represent more than the\naggregation of characteristics of their residents. The magni-\ntude of the neighbourhood effects in these studies has gener-\nally been modest. However, it is difficult to determine the\nextent to which individual level SES is on the pathway\nbetween neighbourhood SES and mortality (that is, is a\nmediator rather than a confounder) so that the effect of\nneighbourhood SES on mortality could be underestimated\nafter adjusting for individual SES.\nThis study extends the existing literature on neighbourhood\nSES and individual level mortality, while considering the\neffects of individual SES. We used a nationally representative\nsample that includes the three largest racial/ethnic groups of\nSee end of article for\nauthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nDr M A Winkleby, Stanford\nCenter for Research in\nDisease Prevention,\nStanford University School\nRoad, Palo Alto, CA\nwinkleby@stanford.edu\nAccepted for publication\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nwww.jech.com\nwomen and men in the US. We stratified by racial/ethnic\ngroup because we hypothesised that neighbourhood effects\ncould potentially vary across groups given that patterns of\nresidential segregation are closely related to socioeconomic\nsegregation. We had three study objectives. Firstly, we\nexamined mortality rates by both individual level SES\n(measured by income, education, and occupational/\nemployment status) and neighbourhood level SES (index of\nneighbourhood income/wealth, educational attainment, occu-\npational status, and employment status). Secondly, we exam-\nined whether neighbourhood SES was associated with\nmortality after controlling for individual SES. Thirdly, we cal-\nculated the population attributable risk to estimate the reduc-\ntion in mortality rates (that is, number of lives saved) if all\nwomen and men lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods.\nMETHODS\nData sources\nWe used data from the National Health Interview Survey\nCensus for neighbourhood SES and to the National Health\nInterview Survey/Multiple Cause of Death Public Use Data file\n(NHIS/NDI) for mortality through 1997. We included data for\nblack, Mexican-American, and white women and men, aged\n25\u00ad64 at interview. This age group was selected to ensure that\nmost people had completed their education and because pre-\nvious research has found that SES differences in health are\ngreater for young and middle aged adults compared with the\nelderly population.10 22 23 The NHIS data were collected through\na continuing survey of US households in a multistage design\nwhere a probability sample of the civilian population is drawn\nThe NHIS/NDI file was produced by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics by matching characteristics from the NHIS\nand the National Death Index (NDI), allowing for a follow up\nmortality link with survey data.26 The NDI was searched from\nthe month and year of the NHIS interview to 31 December\n1997, making the shortest follow up period one month and the\nlongest follow up period 11 years. The final sample consisted\nwomen and men (table 1).\nAddresses of the respondents in each annual NHIS file have\nbeen geocoded to 1990 census geography, which was used to\nlink characteristics of the respondents' place of residence\nusing census tract level data. Census tracts include about 4000\nto 7000 people, have boundaries that represent comparatively\nhomogeneous populations in terms of social and economic\ncharacteristics,27 28 and have been used extensively as proxy\nmeasures of neighbourhood environments. Only 5.4% of\nrespondents were missing geographical identifiers and were\nnot included in the analysis.\nAll research was approved by the appropriate ethics\ncommittee at Stanford University, School of Medicine and\nconforms to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nDefinition of variables\nIndividual level SES was defined by three measures:\neducational attainment, income-to-needs ratio (annual in-\ncome per family member), and a combined measure of occu-\npational and employment status. We operationalised edu-\ncational attainment into categories based on achieved\ncredentials (less than 9 years, 9\u00ad11 years, 12 years, more than\n12 years). The income-to-needs ratio was calculated by divid-\ning the midpoint of the categories for family income by family\nsize as the resources available to a family size of one with\n$50 000 are very different than to a larger family size with the\nsame income. The midpoint of family incomes above $50 000\n(the highest cut off in the NHIS) was assigned a value of\n$75 000 (which was just below the average family income of\n1990 US census).29 We operationalised income into gender and\nracial/ethnic group specific empirical quartiles because previ-\nous research on the effects of income on health outcomes has\nshown non-linear effects30 and because categorising income\nallowed us to include an indicator variable for those with\nmissing income data (see appendix). We operationalised\noccupational/employment status into four standard census\nbased categories: not in the labour force (including retired\npersons, homemakers, students), unemployed, blue collar\nworkers (service, farming/forestry/fishing, precision\nproduction/craft/repair, and operator/fabricator/laborer occu-\npations), and white collar workers (managerial/professional\nspecialty, and technical/sales/administrative support occupa-\ntions). We excluded persons in the military and those with\nunknown occupations. Correlations among the three indi-\nvidual SES measures were 0.48 or below for the overall sample\nand for each racial/ethnic group.\nTo define neighbourhood level SES, we performed a princi-\npal components analysis using standardised values of five\ncensus tract variables to represent neighbourhood level\neducational attainment (percentage of persons 25 years and\nover without a high school degree), income (median family\nincome), wealth (median housing value), occupational status\n(percentage blue collar workers), and employment status\n(percentage unemployed). The first component accounted for\nalmost 60% of the variance. All five variables contributed\nabout equally to the component; therefore, we calculated our\nneighbourhood SES index as the mean of the standardised\nvalues with equal weights. We compared the neighbourhood\nSES index to one based on centile ranks to examine whether\noutliers influenced the index and found that the two indices\nwere highly correlated (0.96); therefore, we used the index\nbased on the means of the standardised values in our analyses.\nWe operationalised the neighbourhood SES index into gender\nspecific and racial/ethnic group specific empirical tertiles (see\nappendix). Previous analyses have found this sample of\ncensus tracts to be nationally representative of all US census\ntracts in terms of socioeconomic characteristics.31\nRace/ethnicity was self reported and included persons who\nidentified themselves as either black (non-Hispanic),\nMexican-American (Mexican-Mexicano, Mexican-American,\nChicano), or white (non-Hispanic). Other racial/ethnic groups\nwere excluded from the analysis because of small sample\nsizes.\nAnalytical approach\nWe calculated age adjusted, all cause mortality rates per\n100 000 person years for the follow up period by dividing the\nnumber of deaths by the number of person years of follow up.\nMortality rates are presented for women and men for the three\nracial/ethnic groups, stratified by individual and neighbour-\nhood SES. Relative rates of mortality were obtained using Cox\nTable 1 Unweighted sample sizes and number of\ndeaths (in parentheses) by racial/ethnic group and\nSample size Number of deaths\nBlack\nWhite\nMexican-American\nSocioeconomic status and mortality 445\nwww.jech.com\nproportional hazards regression models. The final models\nwere estimated with the summary neighbourhood SES index\nas well as with each component of the index and similar pat-\nterns were found. The population attributable risk (PAR) was\ncalculated using the overall death rates compared with the\nrates for those living in the highest SES neighbourhoods,\nwithout regard to individual SES. Thus, the PAR represents the\nproportional reduction in mortality that would occur if every-\none experienced the mortality rates of those living in the\nhighest SES neighbourhoods.\nAs the NHIS is a complex multistage probability sample\nthat yields clustered observations, we used SUDAAN (version\nsurvey design effects and to produce valid variance estimates\nin our regression models.32 SUDAAN also alleviates difficulties\nwith statistical inference introduced by multilevel research\nnot used in this analysis because, while the number of census\ntracts (or neighbourhoods) was large for each group, there\nwere few adults sampled per tract (about two persons sampled\nper tract).37 Given that our data, in large measure, are not\nnested (that is, few sampled per tract) and that one person's\nmortality is not likely to affect another person's in the same\ntract (that is, low intercorrelation coefficient), we feel that this\nanalytical approach is appropriate. Previous studies have used\nRESULTS\nBlack and Mexican-American women and men lived in lower\nSES neighbourhoods compared with white women and men,\nas measured by our neighbourhood SES index. As illustrated\nin figure 1, there was little overlap in the middle tertile of the\nSES index when comparing the white population with black\npopulation and Mexican-Americans. The values within each\ntertile represent very different neighbourhood conditions. For\nexample, neighbourhoods with a SES index value of 1 (the\napproximate upper value for the middle tertile of neighbour-\nhood SES for the black population and Mexican-Americans)\ncompared with 0 (the approximate upper value for the middle\ntertile of neighbourhood SES for the white population) had\nproportion of residents without a high school degree (44% v\nthese differences we stratified the analyses by race/ethnicity so\nthat the results can be interpreted within each racial/ethnic\ngroup.\nby individual SES (in this case, income to needs ratio) and the\nneighbourhood SES index are shown in figure 2. For all com-\nparisons, there was a more pronounced gradient between\nindividual SES and mortality than for neighbourhood SES\nand mortality. Overall, mortality rates were higher for men\nthan for women (note the different scales for the mortality\nrates), and were highest for black men and women. Death\nrates generally increased as neighbourhood SES decreased,\nwith the exception of Mexican American men and women for\nwhom the patterns were less consistent. One noticeable\nexception was that the highest death rates for Mexican-\nAmerican women and men were for those with the lowest\nfamily incomes who lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods.\nDeath rates for all six gender and racial/ethnic groups were\ntwo to four times higher for those with the lowest incomes\n(lowest quartile) who lived in the lowest SES neighbourhoods\n(lowest tertile) compared with those with the highest incomes\nwho lived in the highest SES neighbourhoods. The relations\nbetween educational attainment and occupational/\nemployment status with neighbourhood SES were less\nconsistent (data not shown). This is possibly because of\nsmaller sample sizes within certain categories (for example,\nnumber of unemployed).\nTo examine whether living in a low SES neighbourhood\nconferred additional mortality risk beyond individual SES, we\ncalculated relative mortality ratios from age adjusted Cox pro-\nportional hazards models (tables 2 and 3). We estimated five\nmodels for each of the six groups. The independent variables\nwere: age and neighbourhood SES (model 1); age, one of the\nindividual SES variables (income to needs, educational\nattainment, or occupation/employment status) and neigh-\nbourhood SES (models 2\u00ad4); and age, all three individual SES\nvariables, and neighbourhood SES (model 5). For the six\ngroups, the age adjusted mortality risk associated with living\nin the lowest SES neighbourhoods ranged from 1.43 to 1.61 (a\n43% to 61% increased risk) (model 1). The mortality risk\ndecreased but remained significant (p values <0.05) after\nadjusting for each of the three individual measures of SES,\nwith the exception of Mexican-American women (models\n2\u00ad4). As an example, for white women, the 43% increased risk\nin mortality associated with living in a low SES neighbour-\nhood decreased to 18% when adjusting for the income to\nneeds ratio, to 22% when adjusting for educational attain-\nment, and to 36% when adjusting for occupation/employment\nstatus. In model 5, living in a low SES neighbourhood was\nassociated with an 11%\u00ad18% increase in the risk of mortality\nfor white women and men respectively, which remained\nstatistically significant after simultaneously adjusting for all\nthree measures of individual SES (p values <0.05 and\nTable 4 presents the PAR as a percentage and in absolute\nterms. As a percentage, not controlling for individual SES,\ndeaths would hypothetically be reduced by about 20% for each\nof the six groups if everyone had the same death rates as those\nliving in the highest SES neighbourhoods (highest tertile spe-\ncific to each racial/ethnic and gender group). In absolute\nterms, black men and women would benefit the most; their\nfor black women.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study compares the pattern and effect size of neighbour-\nhood SES on mortality for black, Mexican-American, and\nwhite women and men across different measures and levels of\nindividual SES. Consistent with past research, we found that\nthe effects of individual SES were stronger than the effects of\nneighbourhood SES.21 In addition, neighbourhood SES ex-\nerted independent effects beyond individual SES. Except for\nFigure 1 Distribution of the neighbourhood SES index by\nrace/ethnicity.\nwww.jech.com\nMexican-American women, residence in a low SES neigh-\nbourhood was associated with a significantly increased risk of\nmortality for all groups, after adjusting for each of the three\nindividual measures of SES (and remained significant for\nwhite women and men after simultaneously adjusting for all\nthree measures). We estimated that deaths would be reduced\nby about 20% for each group if everyone had the same death\nrates as those living in the highest SES neighbourhoods. The\nabsolute number of deaths saved would be substantial for all\nethnic and gender groups, and especially for black women and\nmen.\nSeveral previous studies have examined neighbourhood\neffects on the risk of mortality. However, none have used a\nnationally representative sample of black, Mexican-American,\nand white women and men with both individual and\nneighbourhood measures of SES, and presented results\nseparately by gender and race/ethnicity. Anderson et al,17 used\nthe National Longitudinal Mortality Study to compare 11 year\nmortality risk for black and white women and men, ages\n25\u00ad64, living in low income census tracts versus high income\ncensus tracts, after adjusting for individual family income.\nThey found similar relative risks as our current study for black\nand white women and men, but did not examine socioeco-\nnomic inequalities among Mexican-Americans. Waitzman and\nSmith used the NHANES I with the Epidemiologic Follow-up\nSurvey to examine poverty area residence and mortality.18 They\nfound that poverty area residence was associated with\nincreased follow up mortality among young and middle aged\nwomen and men, after adjusting for individual characteristics;\nthey did not examine black and white adults in separate analy-\nses. LeClere et al14 used the same dataset as our study (but ana-\nlysed the three racial/ethnic groups together and used a shorter\nfollow up time) to examine the role of racial/ethnic segregation\nin explaining racial/ethnic disparities in mortality. They found\nthat neighbourhood segregation explained racial/ethnic dis-\nparities in mortality. Another population based mortality\nfollow up study in the Netherlands examined mortality and\nfound significant socioeconomic neighbourhood effects; how-\never, their measures of neighbourhood were derived from\naggregated individual level reports and not from all neighbour-\nhood residents.42 Finally, two studies using prospective data\nfrom a survey in one county in California (the Alameda County\nStudy) found independent neighbourhood effects on the risk\nof mortality.9 13 When combined with the results of these previ-\nous studies, our findings provide further evidence that the\nneighbourhood socioeconomic environment is \"independ-\nently\" associated with risk of mortality.\nOur results for Mexican-American women and men\ndiffered from the other racial/ethnic and gender groups in two\nregards. Firstly, for Mexican-American men there was only\none significant association between individual level SES and\nmortality (the increased hazard for men not in the labour\nforce compared with white collar men). Secondly, for\nMexican-American women, the associations between indi-\nvidual level SES and mortality were generally significant;\nhowever, the association between neighbourhood SES and\nmortality became non-significant after adjustment for any of\nthe individual measures of SES. These findings differ from\nFigure 2 Age adjusted all cause\nyears by income-to-needs ratio (in\nquartiles) and neighbourhood SES\nindex (in tertiles).

While the reasons for\nthese patterns among Mexican-American women and men\nare unclear, we suggest that perhaps the harmful effects of low\nindividual SES for men and low neighbourhood SES for\nwomen may be buffered by protective factors, such as social\nprocesses (for example, cohesion, social support, social\ncontrol) or cultural factors (for example, acculturation, strong\nties to Mexico) that may be more prevalent among Mexican-\nAmericans compared with the other groups, but may operate\ndifferently for Mexican-American women and men.38 43\nStrengths and limitations\nThere are a number of strengths to our analyses. To examine\nsocioeconomic inequalities in mortality, we used data from a\nnationally representative sample with multiple measures of\nSES. This increases the generalisability and validity of our\nfindings.2 44 In addition, the census tracts used in our analyses\n(that is, those in which the study sample resided) have been\nshown to be nationally representative of all US census tracts in\nterms of socioeconomic characteristics.31\nThe limitations of our work include possible bias from sev-\neral sources. Firstly, neighbourhood SES levels were measured\nThis presents the possibility of simultaneity bias because in\nsome cases neighbourhood poverty was measured after\npersons surveyed had died; however, we do not expect this to\nbe an important bias because socioeconomic characteristics of\nneighbourhoods generally do not change significantly over a\nseveral year period.45 Secondly, income had considerable miss-\ning data; 20% for the black population, 15% for Mexican-\nAmericans, and 14% for the white population. For all three\ngroups of women and men, those with missing income data\nwere less likely to be white collar workers, and were more\nlikely to have lower educational attainment and be older\n(except Mexican-American men), out of the labour force, and\nliving in a low SES neighbourhood (except for Mexican-\nAmericans) compared with those without missing income. All\npeople with missing income were retained in the analysis in\nseparate categories. Thirdly, there is possible bias in the prob-\nability of being classified as dead because the linkage between\nthe NHIS and NDI relies on a matching methodology. We\nexamined this possible bias between the matching method-\nology and age, gender, race/ethnicity, individual and neigh-\nbourhood SES, and found no evidence for substantial bias in\nthe probability of being classified as dead.\nA further possible limitation is that factors associated with\nself selection into certain neighbourhoods could account for\nthe results, leading to erroneous conclusions of neighbour-\nhood effects. Neighbourhoods are based on geographically\ndefined census tract boundaries and considerable debate\nexists as to whether these boundaries represent neighbour-\nhoods as defined by the residents living within them.\nMoreover, geographical boundaries may not be the most\nappropriate way to define neighbourhoods; for example,\nothers have suggested that neighbourhood definitions should\nbe based on patterns of social interaction.46 Finally, we have no\ninformation regarding the historical context of neighbour-\nhoods, how they are changing, or how long people have been\nexposed to their neighbourhood environments.46\nOur finding that neighbourhood SES was not statistically\nsignificant after adjusting for the three measures of individual\nSES for some groups does not necessarily mean that\nneighbourhood SES does not matter; indeed, individual SES is\npartly determined by the residential environment in which\none lives and thus can be a mediator. This has led to consider-\nable debate over whether individual SES in models examining\nneighbourhood effects is a true confounder or a mediator (for\na detailed discussion of this issue, see Diez-Roux 199847 and\ndetermines their individual SES (for example, through\neducational and/or employment opportunities), then indi-\nvidual SES would be considered a mediator in the causal\npathway between neighbourhood SES and mortality as com-\npared with a true confounder. If this is the case, our models\nunadjusted for individual SES (see tables 2 and 3, model 1)\nmay be more appropriate to estimate the effect of neighbour-\nhood SES on mortality. In addition, our models adjusted for\nindividual SES (see tables 2 and 3, models 2\u00ad5) may underes-\ntimate the effect of neighbourhood SES on mortality.13 47 It is\nperhaps more appropriate to consider the \"neighbourhood\neffect\" as a range with the age adjusted estimate as the upper\nbound (model 1) and the age and individual SES adjusted\nestimates as the lower bound (model 5).48\nThe influence of neighbourhoods\nOur findings show that, in general, living in a low SES neigh-\nbourhood is associated with increased risk of mortality,\nregardless of a person's individual SES. This may be because\nneighbourhoods become highly differentiated over time in the\navailability of goods and services as residents move according\nto their demands for such goods and services. In addition to\nthe historical context of neighbourhoods, these demands may\nproduce varied local environments based upon ability to pay,\nresulting in affluent places characterised by less hazardous\nphysical environments and greater access to high quality\ngoods and services (both publicly and privately provided)\ncompared with less affluent places.46 Furthermore, norms and\nvalues may become differentiated according to the SES of a\nneighbourhood through peer influences and collective sociali-\nsation, and may, for instance, influence health related behav-\niours of its residents.49 Finally, neighbourhood SES may influ-\nence the risk of mortality through psychosocial mechanisms,\nsuch as social support or sense of control.\nTable 4 Death rates per 100 000 person years, by race/ethnicity and gender, and\nOverall death\nrate\nDeath rate for\nresidence in highest\ntertile SES\nneighbourhood\nPercentage\nPAR Absolute PAR\nMen\nWomen\nwww.jech.com\nImplications for public policy\nOver 31 million white, almost 4.5 million black, and over 1.5\nmillion Mexican-American women and men live in low SES\nneighbourhoods (the lowest tertile of our neighbourhood SES\nindex). Knowledge about the neighbourhoods in which people\nlive can provide health professionals with valuable insight\nabout how residential environments can influence behaviours\nand health. For example, people who live in lower SES neigh-\nbourhoods may encounter significant barriers to adopting and\nmaintaining healthy behaviours (for example, few or no gro-\ncery stores with affordable fresh produce, few or no pharma-\ncies or safe places to exercise, limited public transportation\nand access to health care). In addition, they may be more\nlikely to be exposed to hazardous environments (for example,\ncrime, poor air or water quality) compared with people who\nlive in higher SES neighbourhoods. In response to such\ninequalities, health professionals can be important advocates\nin promoting healthy neighbourhoods. This includes support\nof public policies that regulate fast food, alcohol, tobacco, and\nfirearms availability as well as support of affordable health\ncare services and medications.\nTo address social inequalities in mortality, we support a\nbroad health policy agenda that integrates a focus on\nrace/ethnicity, SES, and the social environment, such as the\nnewly created National Center on Minority Health and Health\nDisparities (www.nih.gov) and the Canadian Institutes of\nHealth Research (www.cihr.ca). A broad focus on socioeco-\nnomic inequalities has many advantages. It acknowledges the\nimportant demographic trends in immigration and intermar-\nriage that have made the classification of people by race and\nethnicity less valid over time as the number of persons from\nmultiethnic backgrounds increase. It also ensures the inclu-\nsion of all low SES populations in health initiatives and\nguidelines, and achieves a more equitable access to resources.\nFinally, it creates a more valid scientific ground for research on\nhealth disparities that goes beyond individual level SES and\nrace/ethnicity, and furthers an understanding that social, eco-\nnomic, and political factors are fundamental causes of poor\n"
