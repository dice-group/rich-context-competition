Merrill\nThe reliance on employer-sponsored insurance to finance health care\nplaces American business at the center of the debate over how to reform\nthe U.S. health care system. At issue is the level of responsibility that the\nprivate sector should assume for the health care needs of workers and\ntheir families, and the costs associated with providing such benefits.\nUnlike in most other industrialized countries, employer-sponsored health\ninsurance in the United States has served as the main alternative to the\ndevelopment of national health insurance for the entire population.\nSeveral forces, such as continuing health care cost inflation, an increas-\ningly constrained and complex system of provider reimbursement, the\nimpending burden of retiree coverage, and concerns about how rising\nhealth benefits costs may undermine international competitiveness, are\nleading American business to take a closer look at what changes should\nbe made in health care financing and delivery.\nEmployer-sponsored insurance is the principal mechanism for financ-\ning health care in this country. Ninety-two percent of full-time employees\nin medium-sized and large firms and 66 percent of all Americans rely on\nemployer-sponsored insurance as their primary source ofhealth coverage.1\nto active and retired employees and their dependents, accounting for 29.3\npercent of national health spending.2\nAs a benefit of employment, health care has become one of the most\ncontentious issues in recent labor negotiations.3 Workers are concerned\nwith maintaining or expanding their coverage, while employers seek\nrelief from the relentless cost inflation that has made health benefits the\nfastest-rising component of employee compensation.4 Nowhere has this\ntension been more apparent than in the recent debate over employers'\nobligations to fund retiree health benefits, the future costs of which are\nJoel Cantor and Nancy Barrand are seniorprogram officers, Randolph Desonia is a program officer,\nand Alan Cohen is a vice-president at The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

To date, several surveys have been conducted to gauge\nthe position of business on health care issues.8 None, however, has\nsucceeded in reaching a large, representative sample of major corporate\nexecutives. Yet it is precisely those business executives who are most likely\nto be influential in the debate over health care reform. In this  ,\nwe report findings from a survey of the chief executives of the nation's\nlargest corporations. The confidential survey, conducted in late 1990 by\nthe Gallup Organization on behalf of The Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation, aimed to elicit business executives' views on the need for change\nin the health care system, the directions that such changes should take,\nand the role that business should play in the health care system.\nSurvey methods. Chief executives of the 1,000 firms on the Fortune\n500 service and industrial lists were invited to participate in a fifteen-\nadvance of telephone contact, a letter of invitation was sent, accompa-\nnied by the endorsement of four prominent corporate executives. Indi-\nviduals with the title of chief executive officer (CEO) were approached\nfor a confidential interview, and, if CEOs were unavailable (some com-\npanies do not use the CEO title), only individuals with the titles of\npresident or chairman of the board were accepted. After extensive efforts\nto obtain responses during the twenty-three-week field period, an abbre-\nviated questionnaire was mailed to the CEOs of companies that did not\nrespond to the telephone survey. A total of 330 telephone interviews and\n54 mail questionnaires were completed, yielding a response rate of 38.7\npercent. This represents the largest number of interviews of CEOs,\npresidents, or chairmen of the board from Fortune 500 companies ever\ncompleted on health care issues. Furthermore, respondents are highly\nrepresentative of those on the Fortune 500 service and industrial lists.10\nThe Need For Change In The Health Care System\nRespondents were asked which of three statements best reflected their\noverall view of the U.S. health care system: (1) \"only minor changes are\nneeded;\" (2) \"fundamental changes are needed;\" or (3) \"we need to\ncompletely rebuild it.\"11 Ninety-one percent of the top executives sur-\nveyed expressed the view that fundamental changes or complete rebuild-\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The motivation for change may\nbe found in the executives' assessments of problems in the health care\nsystem. System costs were cited most frequently, although concerns about\naccess to care also figured prominently. Sixty-two percent of respondents\nmentioned cost concerns first when asked in an open-ended question to\nidentify the most important problems in the health care system; 24\npercent also mentioned concerns about access.\nThis motivation for change may also be spurred by the executives'\nconcerns about the effects of health care costs on their own companies.\nThirty-five percent rated health care costs as a \"top concern\" compared\nto other costs of doing business for their company. Nearly 60 percent rated\nhealth care costs as a \"major concern,\" and only 7 percent as \"minor\" or\nnot a concern at all. The proportion of respondents ranking health care\ncosts as a \"top concern\" did not vary significantly by number of employees\nin the company. However, those executives reporting more than 10\npercent of their company's payroll going for health benefits (134 respon-\ndents) were twice as likely to rate the cost of those benefits as a \"top\nconcern\" than were those whose companies spent less than 5 percent.\nMost executives expressed pessimism about their companies' prospects\nfor controlling health care costs. Only 12.7 percent predicted that their\ncompany would be able to bring costs \"mostly under control\" over the\nnext year or two. When asked whether the solution to the problem of\nrising health care costs could be achieved by each employer working on\nits own, three-fourths said no. Furthermore, over half agreed that health\ncare costs cannot be controlled without some form of government inter-\nvention. This is noteworthy given that, over the past ten years, many\nlarge employers have elected to self-insure and to negotiate directly with\nproviders in an attempt to insulate themselves from cost shifting and\nregulatory controls in the insurance market. More than 80 percent of the\nfirms surveyed reported being wholly or partly self-insured.\nExecutives' Perceptions Of The Need For Health System Reform\nSurvey response\nOn a whole, the health care system works pretty well,\nand only minor changes are needed to make it better\nThere are some good things about our health care system, but\nfundamental changes are needed to make it work better\nOur health care system has so much wrong with it that we\nneed to completely rebuild it\nPercent\nresponding\nSource: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, survey of top U.S. executives, 1990.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\nThe Direction For Change\nExecutives reporting the need for fundamental changes or complete\nrebuilding of the health care system were nearly twice as likely as those\nadvocating only minor changes to believe that government intervention\nis needed to control costs. Those who saw the need to completely rebuild\nwere also three times more likely to have expressed interest in alternatives\nto the current employer-based insurance system. One-fourth of all respon-\ndents agreed that the current employer-based system should be replaced,\nand among those who would completely rebuild the system, more than\ntwo-thirds would replace it entirely.\nSpecific government actions. To discern in greater detail the direction\nin which respondents felt that public policy should go, we asked them\nabout ten specific government actions (Exhibit 2). For each action, they\nwere asked whether government should \"act now,\" \"consider for the\nfuture,\" or \"not consider within the foreseeable future.\" For four of the\ninterventions, three-quarters or more of the executives supported imme-\nSupport For Ten Specific Government Interventions\nActions government could take\nMake greater use of selective contracting to purchase services\nunder the Medicare and Medicaid programs (n = 349)\nEncourage small businesses, through tax incentives, to provide\nEstablish standards for the appropriate use of medical care\nExpand existing public programs to cover more of the\nCreate a single set of reimbursement rules for hospitals and\ndoctors to be used by all private insurers as well as\nRequire that all employers provide health benefits (n = 378)\nControl health expenditures through regulation of payment\nto hospitals and doctors (n = 366)\nDirectly control the physical capacity of the health care\nsystem, such as regulating the number of hospital beds that\nReplace the existing system with health care coverage of all\nAmericans through a public health insurance system\nControl the number of medical and surgical specialists\nPercent responding\nAct Consider for\nnow the future\nNot\nconsider\nSource: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, survey of top U.S. executives, 1990.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Three other\ngovernment interventions received majority support (\"act now\" or \"con-\nsider...\"), while three interventions did not receive majority support.\nPerhaps because of the traditional free-market orientation of business,\nmany of the government interventions involving direct regulation of the\nhealth care industry received relatively little support. However, when we\nexamined executives' perceptions of necessary measures to control costs,\nsome preferences for various government regulations emerged. Among\nexecutives who support government intervention to control costs, most\nindicated that government should implement or consider the following\nreforms: medical standards, a single set of reimbursement rules for all\npayers, and regulation of payment to hospitals and doctors. Less supported\nby all respondents were government controls over physical capacity of\nthe health care system and numbers of medical and surgical specialists.\nThose actions most commonly proposed to increase access to health\ncare--tax incentives for small businesses, expansion of public programs,\nmandated employer-based coverage, and universal public health insur-\nance--received mixed support. For example, more than three-quarters of\nthe executives supported expansion of existing public programs. At least\ntwo out of three respondents would give high priority to people that\nexperience catastrophic medical expenses, are denied coverage because\nof poor health, or cannot afford available coverage. In contrast, only half\nof the respondents would give high priority for government help to the\nunemployed, and fewer than one-third would place high priority on help\nfor employees of businesses that do not provide coverage.\nSupport for systemwide reform was also strongly associated with per-\nceptions about cost control. Executives who believe that government\nintervention is needed to control costs were more likely to support\noptions involving major restructuring of the health care system. The more\nfundamental the restructuring, the greater was this differential in support.\nThe differential was greatest for universal public health insurance, which\nreceived support from only 9 percent of executives who reported that\ncompanies can control costs on their own, compared to half of executives\nwho reported that government help is needed. Among the ninety-three\nexecutives who supported the most fundamental change--replacing the\nemployer-based insurance system--more than 80 percent supported a\nsingle reimbursement system for all payers, and an equal proportion\nsupported universal public health insurance.\nThe role of business. Various scenarios for changing the U.S. health\ncare system promote different roles for the public and private sectors.\nRegardless of the extent or type of government action endorsed, respon-\ndents supported some level of continued private-sector responsibility for\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

A large majority would\ncontinue company responsibility for basic hospital care, A smaller major-\nity saw companies as responsible for substance abuse and mental health\nbenefits. On the other hand, a majority endorsed government or shared\nresponsibility for catastrophic and long-term care. Even many of the\nexecutives supporting systemwide reform believed companies should\nretain some responsibility for their employees' health care costs. For\nexample, among executives responding that government should \"act\nnow\" to implement universal public health insurance, 45.8 percent would\nstill have companies take responsibility for basic hospital coverage.\nAlso, regardless of the direction change might take, executives\nendorsed greater individual cost sharing and continued experimentation\nwith ways to organize efficient medical care delivery. Nearly three-fourths\nreported that the out-of-pocket expense paid by individuals for their\nhealth care is too little. In addition, approximately half felt that replacing\nfee-for-service medical practice with managed care delivery entities that\ntake responsibility for their enrollees would lead to better cost control.\nImplications For The National Debate\nThis survey of 384 top executives of the nation's largest companies--\nemploying ten million individuals--reveals a nascent political will\namong business leaders to proceed with major changes in the health care\nsystem. Pressure from rising costs of providing health care coverage to\ntheir workers may be the single most important factor stimulating execu-\ntives' current high level of interest in system reform.

Thus, the 203 executives who supported\ngovernment intervention to control costs are the strongest proponents\nnot only of regulatory solutions, but also of fundamental system reforms\nas dramatic as replacement of the current system of employer-based\ninsurance. The unrelenting inflation in health care costs is likely to\nfurther induce business leaders to support major reforms. This trend is\nexecutives conducted by William M. Mercer, Inc. The proportion of\nrespondents in those surveys who strongly agreed that the United States\n\"is facing a health care crisis\" rose from 30 to 54 percent over that period.12\nThe executives surveyed here were willing to consider a wide range of\nspecific government actions to change the health care system. They also\nadvocated continuing some company responsibility for workers' basic\nhealth care coverage. This may indicate their wish to redefine the role of\nbusiness within the context of a more complementary public/private\nsystem of health care coverage. The comparatively stronger support for\nan all-payer reimbursement system than for direct regulation of the health\ncare industry or for a public-only insurance system may further underscore\nthat a more acceptable and viable solution is a partnership of business\nand government rather than one imposed by the public sector.\nThe national debate over the future of the health care system, thus far,\nhas proceeded without consensus. Large businesses, as major stakeholders\nin the outcome of this debate, will play a key role in determining the\ndirection that change will take. Half of the business leaders are undertak-\ning executive-level efforts to determine where their company stands on\nnational health policy issues. The findings of this survey illustrate both a\nsense of urgency and a willingness among major employers to pursue\nfundamental reform of our nation's health care system. As costs continue\nto escalate, the pressure for change will grow.\nThe views expressed in this   are solely those of the authors, and no official endorsement\nby The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation or Columbia University is intended or should be inferred.\nThe authors thank Jack Meyer and Marc Berk for their valuable advice throughout the development\nand analysis of the survey.
