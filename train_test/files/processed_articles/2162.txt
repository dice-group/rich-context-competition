Individuals who misuse heroin and prescription opioids are known to bear a\ndisproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality. Service providers and public health authorities are challenged\nto provide appropriate interventions in the absence of basic knowledge about the size and characteristics of this\npopulation. While illicit drug users are underrepresented in population-based surveys, they may be identified in\nmultiple administrative data sources.\nMethods: We analyzed large datasets tracking hospital inpatient and emergency room admissions as well as drug\ntreatment and detoxification services utilization. These were applied in combination with findings from a large\ngeneral population survey and administrative records tracking prescriptions, drug overdose deaths, and correctional\nhealth services, to estimate the prevalence of heroin and non-medical prescription opioid use among New York\nCity residents in 2006. These data were further applied to a descriptive analysis of opioid users entering drug\ntreatment and hospital-based medical care.\nResults: These data sources identified 126,681 cases of opioid use among New York City residents in 2006. After\napplying adjustment scenarios to account for potential overlap between data sources, we estimated over 92,000\nindividual opioid users. By contrast, just 21,600 opioid users initiated drug treatment in 2006. Opioid users\nrepresented 4 % of all individuals hospitalized, and over 44,000 hospitalizations during the calendar year.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that innovative approaches are needed to provide adequate services to this\nsizeable population of opioid users. Given the observed high rates of hospital services utilization, greater integration\nof drug services into medical settings could be one component of an effective approach to expanding both the\nscope and reach of health interventions for this population.\n",

In recent\ndecades we have seen significant changes in the culture\nand patterns of drug use, including greater availability of\npotent prescription opioids and decreasing rates of\nintravenous drug use. What persists is the disproportion-\nate burden of morbidity and mortality borne by opioid\nusers, including chronic infectious diseases (hepatitis C,\nHIV/AIDS) and premature death due to overdose and\naccidents [2-7]. Service providers and government health\nauthorities are challenged to provide appropriate drug ser-\nvices in the absence of basic knowledge about the size and\ncharacteristics of their target population.\nThree notable developments in recent years make this\nan opportune time to revisit estimates of the prevalence of\nopioid use. First, increasing rates of prescription opioid\nmisuse and related overdose deaths indicate a shift in drug\nuse patterns, demographics, and potential harms of use\n[8-11].

Historically, re-\nsearch on opioid use has largely focused on heroin-using\npopulations, with much less known about the treatment\nneeds and access to care issues experienced by prescrip-\ntion opioid users [12].\nA second event is the approval in 2002 of buprenor-\nphine for treatment of opioid dependence, which offers\nan exceptional opportunity for expansion of evidence-\nbased treatment. Buprenorphine can be prescribed by\nphysicians in general practice settings, and thus offers the\npossibility of dramatically expanding access to treatment,\nbut is not currently being employed to its fullest poten-\ntial [13,14]. A related third event is a newly increased\nemphasis on integrating addiction treatment into non-\nspecialty medical settings such as primary care clinics.\nThis is exemplified in the current strategic plan issued by\nthe federal Office of National Drug Control Policy, which\nemphasizes early identification of substance use disorders\nand expansion of treatment through mainstream health-\nPopulation surveys, primarily the National Survey on\nDrug Use and Health (NSDUH), are relied upon to assess\nthe prevalence of illicit drug use, but are believed to se-\nverely underestimate `hardcore' drug use, including heroin\nand injection drug use [16,17]. The survey does not in-\nclude individuals who are incarcerated, institutionalized,\nor street homeless; all populations with disproportionately\nhigh prevalence of drug use [18]. It may also underesti-\nmate drug use among those who do participate, due to\nunderreporting of stigmatized and illicit behavior by\nrespondents, despite efforts to counteract this with recent\nchanges in survey methodology [19]. As a result of these\nconstraints, the NSDUH is limited in its ability to inform\nintelligent program design for opioid users.\nOther data collected for administrative purposes and\npublic health surveillance contains information on the\nhealth, demographic, and geographic characteristics of\nopioid users, and captures populations excluded from\nthe NSDUH sample. While no single data source pro-\nvides a comprehensive picture of illicit opioid use, each\nprovides information on a subset of users who have\ndeveloped social, psychological or physical problems as a\nconsequence of their use. Yet these data sources have\nnot previously been systematically applied to characterize\nthe prevalence of opioid use. We analyzed these data\nwith a goal of informing potential changes in drug ser-\nvices that could accommodate those left out of the\ncurrent treatment system.\nMethods\nThis descriptive analysis of the prevalence of opioid use\nin New York City utilizes multiple data sources,\nincluding administrative datasets recording hospital in-\npatient and emergency room admissions, treatment and\ndetoxification services utilization, prescription records,\noverdose deaths, and correctional health statistics, as\nwell as survey data from the NSDUH. Using data from\nthe most recent year (2006) for which complete data\nwere available for all sources, we analyzed these datasets\nin combination to characterize the population of opioid\nusers who would be candidates for drug services. We\nthen compared them to the population entering drug\ntreatment programs to estimate the extent of the un-\ntreated opioid user population.\nDefinition of opioid use/users Opioid users are defined\nas individuals using heroin or misusing prescription\nopioids (taking prescription opioid medications outside\nof a physician's care or other than as prescribed). Opioid\nuse is potentially, but not necessarily, concurrent with\nthe clinical diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence.\nWhile not all datasets allow a rigorous classification of\nabuse or dependence, opioid users are identified in the\ndata by virtue of the health or treatment consequences\nof their opioid abuse, dependence, or poisoning, and are\nthus all potential candidates for drug services [20,21].\nCase definition Cases were limited to unique indivi-\nduals because our goal was to identify the size and char-\nacteristics of the opioid user population rather than\nservice utilization. Cases were additionally limited to\nresidents of the five counties of New York City. Specific\ndefinitions for identifying cases of opioid use varied by\ndataset, and are described in Table 1.\nDescription of the datasets Datasets containing detailed\ninformation on characteristics of the study population\nwere classified as `primary.' Those providing only general\ninformation about the population of interest (i.e. fre-\nquency of cases) were classified as `supplemental' datasets.\nPrimary datasets\nStatewide Planning and Research Cooperative System\n(SPARCS) is an administrative reporting system of the\nNew York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) that\ncomprehensively records all hospital inpatient and out-\npatient visits to New York State hospitals [22].

The CDS tracks all\nadmissions to licensed providers of medical detoxifica-\ntion and substance abuse treatment services, and records\npatient-level demographics and provides detailed infor-\nmation about recent substance use behaviors. Data is\ncollected from each patient at the time of admission,\nand all information is based on client self-report. Cases\nwere drawn from both the detoxification and substance\nabuse treatment program datasets, and limited to indivi-\nduals reporting one or more opioids as a primary, sec-\nondary or tertiary drug of abuse. We did not distinguish\nbetween individuals who entered drug treatment volun-\ntarily and those who were mandated to treatment by the\ncriminal justice system through alternative to incarcer-\nation and similar programs.\nSupplemental datasets\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is an\nannual household survey conducted by the U.S. Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\nIt is the primary source of information on the prevalence\nand patterns of substance use in the general population,\nage 12 and older [23]. Information collected includes\npatterns and severity of lifetime, past year and current\ndrug use. Population prevalence is estimated from the\nsurvey sample using established NSDUH methodology\n[24]. Substate-level data on opioid use is not published,\nbut was obtained from SAMHSA for New York City\n(NSDUH region A) by the NYC DOHMH (Bureau of\nAlcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care and Treatment),\nwhich provided the data for this analysis. Cases included\nwere limited to individuals classified as having abuse or\ndependence on heroin or prescription opioids.\nThe Bureau of Correctional Health Services in the\nNYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC\nDOHMH) records on-site health services received by\nNew York City jail inmates, including the number re-\nceiving methadone for detoxification or maintenance\ntreatment of opioid dependence during the period of in-\ncarceration. Jail rather than prison inmates are included\nin this analysis because of their shorter length of stay.\nWith an average length of stay of just 37 days [25], most\nof these inmates are expected to rejoin the community\nwithin the calendar year, thus adding to the population\nof New York City opioid users eligible for drug services.\nData used in this study were provided by Correctional\nHealth Services and do not allow identification of unique\nindividuals.\nThe Bureau of Vital Statistics in the NYC DOHMH\nmaintains records of unintentional drug overdose deaths.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care\nand Treatment conducted an additional review of Med-\nical Examiner records for these cases to detail the sub-\nstances involved and circumstances of overdose death.\nThese publicly available overdose data were used in our\nanalysis [6].\nPrescription records are collected by the NYS DOH for\nall controlled substances prescribed and dispensed in\nNew York State, including buprenorphine. Oral bupre-\nnorphine is indicated exclusively for treatment of opioid\ndependence, and may be prescribed by qualified physi-\ncians for maintenance or detoxification treatment. Data\nis collected on the total number of buprenorphine pre-\nscriptions filled, as well as the number of individuals fill-\ning a buprenorphine prescription for the first time. Data\non buprenorphine prescriptions dispensed in New York\nCity is regularly provided to the NYC DOHMH, Bureau\nof Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care and Treat-\nment, and the Bureau Assistant Commissioner (author\nDH) provided summary statistics for the current ana-\nlysis. Buprenorphine treatment entrants were defined as\nthose individuals filling a buprenorphine prescription in\n2006 who did not fill a buprenorphine prescription\nwithin New York City in the prior three years.\nNotably, we did not use data from the Drug Abuse\nWarning Network (DAWN). DAWN is a federal surveil-\nlance system tracking substance use-related ED visits\nbased on chart reviews rather than ICD-9 codes, and is\noften applied to assessments of the health burden of illicit\ndrug use at the local and national level [26]. We chose to\nuse SPARCS instead of DAWN to track emergency de-\npartment admissions in our analysis because DAWN data\nreflects a rate projection based on a sample of patient vis-\nits rather than an inclusive count of all ED admissions.\nAnalysis\nThree subpopulations of opioid users were defined. The\ngeneral population (G) refers to opioid users identified\nthrough population health and criminal justice data.\nDrug services entrants (D) are those entering inpatient\ndetoxification or drug treatment programs, or filling\ntheir first buprenorphine prescription. Medical services\nrecipients (M) are those identified in the SPARCS data-\nsets from inpatient hospitalizations (based on hospital\ndischarge data) or emergency room admissions.\nEstimation of subpopulations\nWe calculated the number of opioid users identified\nwithin each dataset according to the case definitions\nspecified in Table 1. Within the primary datasets, cases\nwere limited to unique individuals. In the SPARCS data,\nthis was accomplished by creating a unique identifier\nbased on SPARCS UPID, (an anonymous identifier pro-\nvided in the datasets), in combination with date of birth\nand sex. In the CDS data, individuals were identified\nusing a unique identifier constructed from sex, date of\nbirth, last four digits of social security number, and first\ntwo characters of last name. To eliminate duplication,\ncases were further restricted to the first admission of the\ncalendar year for each individual, both within and be-\ntween the detoxification and substance abuse treatment\nprogram datasets. In the supplemental datasets, NSDUH\nmethodology provided prevalence estimates [24]. Over-\ndose deaths are unique by definition. The number of\nindividuals receiving buprenorphine is tracked by the\nNYS DOH utilizing identifying information included on\neach filled prescription. We were not able to limit the\ncorrectional health services data to unique individuals.\nThe total number of individual opioid users captured\nin each subpopulation was then estimated. While we\nwere able to limit cases within most datasets to unique\nindividuals, we were not able to track individuals be-\ntween the various data sources. This introduced the pos-\nsibility of over-counting individuals who appeared in\nmore than one data source. For example, an individual\nwho had both an emergency room visit for medical rea-\nsons and a drug treatment program admission in 2006\nmay have been counted twice in our analysis, because\none admission would be captured in the SPARCS data,\nand the other in the CDS. To account for this we incor-\nporated `expansive' and `restrictive' estimates of the\npopulation size, and examined varying degrees of overlap\nbetween the datasets defining our subpopulations.\nIn estimating the `general population' (G) of opioid\nusers, the expansive estimate assumed no overlap be-\ntween NSDUH and the corrections population or over-\ndose decedents. The most restrictive estimate assumed\nthat individuals identified through corrections or over-\ndose deaths were already accounted for by the NSDUH\nsampling strategy and estimation method, even though\ncorrections populations are not surveyed directly. In the\n`drug services population' (D), the CDS dataset identified\nunique individuals admitted to either drug treatment or\nmedical detoxification services. The only potential dupli-\ncation of drug services recipients would thus be through\ndouble counting of those who received a prescription for\nbuprenorphine in addition to detoxification or drug\ntreatment services. Therefore, the more expansive esti-\nmate assumed that individuals initiating buprenorphine\ntreatment and those entering detoxification or drug\ntreatment services were distinct, whereas the more re-\nstrictive estimate assumed that buprenorphine recipients\nwere already counted among the drug treatment\nadmissions.\nFor the `medical services' (M) population, any indivi-\nduals who were hospitalized for drug detoxification or re-\nhabilitation procedure(s) were identified using\nInternational Classification of Infectious Diseases, 9th revi-\nThese cases were removed from the analysis of the med-\nical services population, because detoxification and re-\nhabilitation admissions are comprehensively recorded in\nthe CDS data. This step eliminated duplication of indivi-\nduals appearing in both the CDS and SPARCS datasets.\nUnique individuals were identified within and across the\nSPARCS inpatient and outpatient data using our unique\nidentifier.\nEstimation of the total opioid user population\nAdding the combined totals from each subpopulation\nprovided an expansive and a restrictive unadjusted esti-\nmate of the opioid user population. However, combining\nthese subpopulations introduced further potential for\nduplication of individuals who may appear in more than\none group. To account for this, we examined two sce-\nnarios describing degrees of overlap between our gen-\neral, medical services, and drug services subpopulations.\nThe expansive estimate assumed that there was no\noverlap between subpopulations. While some opioid\nusers likely appear in more than one subpopulation, this\napproach may compensate for the fact that opioid users\nare a hidden population that is likely to be undercounted\nin all datasets [27,28]. The restrictive estimate assumed\nthat the general population estimate accurately identifies\nall opioid users, thus eliminating the need to additionally\ninclude those individuals presenting for medical and\ndrug services. The midpoint between the expansive and\nrestrictive estimates was considered our best estimate of\nthe total opioid user population.\nEstimation of treatment entrants\nWe identified two subpopulations to formulate an esti-\nmate of the number of opioid users entering drug treat-\nment in 2006. The first subpopulation came from the\nCDS data, which identifies those individuals citing opi-\noid(s) as a primary, secondary, or tertiary drug of abuse\nupon entry to a treatment program. In this analysis of\ndrug treatment entrants, individuals admitted for detoxi-\nfication only were excluded, unless they also entered a\ntreatment program in 2006. The second subpopulation\nwas identified through buprenorphine prescription\nrecords. To account for potential double-counting of\nindividuals receiving buprenorphine who may have also\nattended a drug treatment program, we calculated both\nexpansive and restrictive estimates of the number of\ntreatment entrants. The midpoint of the expansive and\nrestrictive estimates was used as our estimate of the total\nnumber of treatment entrants.\nDescription of opioid users entering drug services and\nhospital-based medical services\nAfter applying the specified case definitions to restrict\nthe dataset to individual opioid users, we used descrip-\ntive statistics to examine the demographic and geo-\ngraphic characteristics of cases identified in the CDS\n(drug services) and SPARCS (hospital-based medical ser-\nvices) data. County of residence was identified by the\nindividual's home zip code. The drug services data\nincluded individuals admitted to drug treatment, detoxi-\nfication services, or both during 2006. The hospital ser-\nvices data was divided into emergency room (ER) and\ninpatient admissions. In this descriptive analysis, opioid\nusers who had hospitalizations for detoxification or re-\nhabilitation were included in the hospital inpatient data,\n(along with those hospitalized for medical reasons), in\norder to provide a more comprehensive picture of the\nopioid user population accessing hospital-based acute\nmedical care. This is in contrast to the prevalence esti-\nmations, in which individuals admitted for detoxification\nor rehabilitation were excluded from the SPARCS data\nto avoid duplication.\nResults\namong New York City residents in 2006 (Table 2). Based\non our case definitions, all of these opioid users have\nattributes consistent with opioid abuse, dependence, or\npoisoning, and would thus qualify for services to address\nOpioid users were categorized into three subpopula-\ntions, of which the general population (G) was the lar-\ngest, with a midpoint estimate of 69,463 individuals.

Opioid users had a mean age of\n40 years or greater, with hospital inpatients being consid-\nerably older. The majority were male, though there was\ngreater representation of females in the hospitalized\npopulation than in drug treatment programs. The Bronx\nwas the county with both the greatest number and pro-\nportion of opioid users. Bronx residents were also well\nrepresented in the drug services population, with a rate\nTable 2 Opioid user subpopulations: New York City, 2006\nSubpopulation Dataset Opioid\nmisusers (N)\nSubpopulation\nestimation definitions\nSubpopulation\nestimates (N)\nMidpoint\nestimate (N)\nGeneral Population (G) Expansive = GE\n= a + b + c\nRestrictive = GR\n= a\nGE\nGR\nb.

Overall, they represented 4.1 % of all\nindividuals hospitalized and 0.7 % of all individuals admit-\nted to the emergency room in 2006. In total, opioid users\nfor medical reasons (i.e. not for detoxification or rehabili-\ntation). They incurred an additional 10,053 emergency\nroom visits that did not result in hospitalization (data not\nshown).\nDiscussion\nOur analysis sought to provide a rigorous estimation of\nthe opioid user population by grounding prevalence esti-\nmates in a range of datasets that are not often applied to\nthis question. Although even this diversified approach\nmay not capture the full scope of opioid use, it does\nallow construction of a more comprehensive picture of\nopioid users in New York City, including prevalence,\nservice utilization, and demographic characteristics.\nThere is clearly a need for expanded drug services for\nopioid users in New York City. Even using our most re-\nstrictive estimations, there were over 69,000 opioid users\nindividual opioid users did initiate treatment, this repre-\nsents a small fraction of the identified opioid user popu-\nlation. Moreover, because close to half of treatment\nadmissions are mandated each year in New York City,\nincluding one-third by criminal justice authorities (i.e.\ncourts, probation, parole), one can assume a consider-\nable portion of this fraction did not initiate treatment\nvoluntarily.\nThe current drug treatment system alone cannot be\nrelied upon to accommodate the needs of this popula-\ntion. Though maintenance treatment with an opioid\nagonist medication, (methadone or buprenorphine), is\nthe best evidence-based treatment strategy for opioid de-\npendence [29], not all of the opioid users identified here\nwould necessarily qualify for, or accept, medication\nassisted treatment. Furthermore, accommodating these\nindividuals within the existing substance abuse treat-\nment system would involve doubling the capacity of\nNew York City opiate agonist treatment programs,\nwhich currently serve approximately 37,500 patients\n[14]. Buprenorphine treatment in general medical set-\ntings provides an alternative means of treatment expan-\nsion, but slow uptake among physicians has thus far\nlimited its reach.\nWhile many opioid users would undoubtedly benefit\nfrom traditional drug treatment services, the availability\nof treatment slots is not the only barrier to engaging\nthem in effective evidence-based care. Although these\ndata sources largely capture the negative sequelae of opi-\noid use (health problems, incarceration) that are more\nprominent among those with active substance use disor-\nders, even non-dependent and early-stage users are vul-\nnerable to drug-related problems, and may also have\nbeen identified here. Similarly, these data may include\nopioid users that were already enrolled in drug treat-\nment, but nonetheless experienced problems related to\ndrug use. Some opioid users could be served by less in-\ntensive treatment interventions, such as brief interven-\ntions or pharmacotherapy, provided in healthcare or\nFigure 1 Estimation of total opioid users compared to opioid users entering drug treatment.\nTable 3 Characteristics of adult opioid users admitted to drug and medical services: NYC, 2006\nCharacteristic Drug Services Entrants (CDS) Emergency Room Admissions (SPARCS) Hospital Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS)\nOpioid\nusersa\nN (%)\nTotal\nindividuals\nentering drug\nservicesb\nN (%)\nOpioid users in\ndrug services\npopulationb\n(%)\nOpioid users in\nNYC(county)\npopulationc\nOpioid\nusersa\nN (%)\nTotal\nindividuals\nadmitted to\nERN (%)\nOpioid\nusers in ER\npopulation\n(%)\nOpioid users\nin NYC(county)\npopulationc\nOpioid\nusersa\nN (%)\nTotal\nindividuals\nadmitted to\nhospitalb\nN (%)\nOpioid users\nin hospital\npopulationb\n(%)\nOpioid users\nin NYC(county)\npopulationc\nAge (years)\nSex\nCounty of\nResidence\na Unique individuals; persons younger than 18 years are excluded.\nb Includes individuals who had admissions for detoxification or rehabilitation procedures.\nc Total NYC and county population measures represent the 5 NYC boroughs for ages 18 and older, 2006.

Many would\nbenefit from harm reduction approaches to prevent the\nnegative consequences of opioid use. A greater diversity,\nas well as a greater number, of treatment providers would\nthus be needed to deliver care to the full range of opioid\nusers identified here. Public health authorities could\napply this data to assess and orient the structural config-\nuration of existing treatment services, and to expand en-\ngagement, access points, service types and modalities,\nand venues to better reach the sizeable under-served opi-\noid user population.\nOur approach does have a number of limitations. Most\nnotably, we were unable to match individual opioid users\nacross data sources. Capture-recapture analysis, which re-\nlies on identifying unique individuals across multiple data-\nsets, can potentially improve the accuracy of prevalence\nestimation, and has been applied in municipalities outside\nthe US to estimate populations of illicit drug users [32-\n35]. We chose not to use this approach because accessing\nfully identified individual-level data from multiple data\nsources was not feasible at the time of this analysis. Simi-\nlarly, although it would be desirable to perform a validity\ncheck of the final estimates using an alternate method, this\nwas beyond the scope of the present study. However, our\nfindings do have face validity in light of prior estimates of\nthe New York City opioid user population [1,13].\nOur estimation of the medical services population re-\nlied on hospital data from inpatient and emergency\nroom presentations, and did not capture individuals who\nutilized only ambulatory care services. Analysis of insur-\nance claims data could contribute that information, but\nwas not accessible for this analysis. Our data also fail to\ncapture services provided within the Veteran's Adminis-\ntration (VA) system.\nThere are several limitations inherent to the datasets\nthemselves. Substance use is often not identified in med-\nical settings [36-39] and substance use and other mental\nhealth diagnoses are poorly captured by medical admin-\nistrative data [40-44]. Additionally, none of the datasets\nthat rely on service utilization (drug treatment, detoxifi-\ncation, or hospital inpatient services) capture those with\nless problematic opioid use, who have not experienced\nthe health and social sequelae of addiction that often\ndrive users to seek care. As a result, we relied on the\nNSDUH for the general population estimation of opioid\nuse, despite its known limitations [16,17]. Finally, our\nanalysis is restricted to a single year-long period (2006),\nand thus does not capture trends in opioid use over\ntime. This may be a particularly significant limitation\nwith respect to prescription opioid use, which has been\nrising rapidly nationwide [9-11].\nDespite these limitations, our study contributes to the\nunderstanding of the prevalence of opioid use in New\nYork City by rigorously defining the dimensions and\ncharacteristics of the opioid user population. More\nsophisticated epidemiologic analyses of these multiple\ndatasets, including capture-recapture and multiplier\nmethods, could provide a more accurate estimate of the\nhidden population of opioid users who do not appear in\nany existing data sources. Our goal here was to take a\nfirst step toward that end by defining the number and\nrange of individuals who met our case definition of\nproblematic opioid use in health-related datasets.\nConclusion\nThe health and social impact of opioid use is well\nrecognized, but drug services have yet to adapt and ex-\npand to meet the needs of New York City's sizeable out\nof treatment opioid user population. By providing a\nmore comprehensive view of the opioid user popula-\ntion, our analysis could inform policy changes at the\nmunicipal and state level that would foster a broader\nspectrum of services for opioid users, and greater diver-\nsity of settings in which drug services are provided.\nEfforts to reach this population could include provision\nof treatment and early intervention outside of specialized\ndrug treatment programs, through greater involvement\nof the mainstream health care system. Though a minority\nof opioid users entered drug treatment in 2006, our ana-\nlysis reveals that their contact with other aspects of the\nhealth system is routine. Many are utilizing hospital-\nbased care, and many more are likely seen in ambulatory\ncare settings, visits to which were not captured here.\nThis presents an opportunity to expand both the scope\nand reach of drug services. Office-based treatment with\nbuprenorphine, for example, offers the opportunity to\nreach individuals who do not typically seek care at sub-\nstance abuse treatment programs. Greater adoption of\nscreening and brief intervention (SBI) models is another\npotential avenue for expanding services to the large sub-\nstance using population that is not actively seeking drug\ntreatment.\nThese changes will occur only with strong public health\nleadership and targeted research that informs and sup-\nports changes within the complex systems of health care\nand drug treatment services. Buprenorphine's potential\nhas yet to be fully realized, in New York City and through-\nout the U.S., due to practitioner- and systems-level bar-\nriers [45-47]. There are important questions about how\nbest to implement SBI, and its effectiveness for individuals\nwith opioid abuse or dependence, but research can pro-\nvide better models for identifying and engaging this popu-\nlation in health care settings [48]. Successful early\nintervention with these users could potentially prevent de-\nvelopment of the severe sequelae of untreated opioid use\ndisorders, including the health and social consequences\nthat are starkly revealed here as statistics on hospitaliza-\ntions, incarcerations, and overdose deaths.\nAbbreviations\nHealth surveys and datasets\nCDS: Client Data System; DAWN: Drug Abuse Warning Network;\nICD-9: International Classification of Infectious Diseases 9th revision;\nNSDUH: National Survey on Drug Use and Health; SPARCS: Statewide\nPlanning and Research Cooperative System.\nAgencies and Organizations\nNYC DOHMH: New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; NYS\nDOH New: York State Department of Health; NYS OASAS: New York State\nOffice of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n"
