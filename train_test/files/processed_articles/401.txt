Arnett, Suzanne Oparil\n Key Words: blood pressure  mortality  hypertension  adults  medication use\nThe prognostic value of blood pressure is based mainly on\nmeasurements obtained in a clinic setting, typically\naveraged over several visits.1\u00ad3 Visit-to-visit variability of\nblood pressure is often dismissed as random fluctuation\naround a patient's true basal blood pressure and is thought to\nbe a limitation of measuring blood pressure in the office\nsetting.4,5 However, recent data suggest that visit-to-visit\nvariability of blood pressure is reproducible and not a random\nphenomenon.6\nThe concept that variability in blood pressure has a\nprognostic value for cardiovascular events is not new.7\u00ad10 In\n1993, investigators demonstrated that higher diurnal variabil-\nity of blood pressure assessed by ambulatory monitoring over\n24 hours was associated with an increased risk for left\nventricular hypertrophy during 7 years of follow-up.7 In\n2010, secondary analyses of several randomized controlled\ntrials demonstrated a strong association between longer-term\nvariability in systolic blood pressure and stroke and coronary\nheart disease risk.11 In these studies, blood pressure variabil-\nity was assessed across multiple visits (ie, visit-to-visit\nvariability) conducted over periods of 12 to 36 months.\nData on visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure have\nbeen derived primarily from select populations, mostly sec-\nondary analyses of randomized controlled trials including\npatients with or at high risk for vascular disease. Scarce data\nare available on the correlates and prognostic significance\nof higher visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure in the\ngeneral population. Therefore, we analyzed data from the\npopulation-based Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) to determine factors\nassociated with higher visit-to-visit variability of blood\npressure. In addition, we examined the association between\nFrom the Departments of Epidemiology (P.M., D.K.A.) and Medicine (P.M., S.O.), University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL;\nDepartment of Medicine (D.S.), Columbia University, New York, NY; Department of Medicine (M.T.), University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,\nCanada; Department of Research & Evaluation (K.R.), Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, CA.\nCorrespondence to Paul Muntner, Department of Epidemiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1665 University Blvd, Suite 230J,\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nvisit-to-visit variability of blood pressure and all-cause\nmortality.\nMethods\nNHANES III was a stratified, multistage probability survey designed\nto select a representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized\nUS population.12 NHANES III consisted of an in-home interview\nwith blood pressure measurements and a visit to a mobile examina-\ntion center for a medical evaluation including additional blood\ncompleted the NHANES III interview and examination between\nwere selected to attend a third visit at the mobile examination center,\nduring which time the complete medical evaluation including blood\npressure measurements was repeated. We limited the current analy-\nses to NHANES III participants who were selected for the third study\nvisit and excluded 1040 participants without 3 blood pressure\nmeasurements at each of the 3 NHANES III study visits. In addition,\n178 participants whose blood pressure was not measured in the same\narm at all 3 visits were excluded. After these exclusions, a total of\n956 NHANES III participants were included in the current analyses.\nAmong those selected to attend the third visit, participants included\nsimilar mean systolic blood pressure levels during the in-home visit\nduring the first visit to the mobile examination center (125.3 mm Hg\nNHANES III was approved by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention institu-\ntional review board. All participants gave informed consent.\nBaseline Data Collection\nDemographic and health-related information was collected using a\nstandardized questionnaire during the in-home interview. The use of\nantihypertensive medications was ascertained via self-report with\nclasses of antihypertensive medications determined through pill\nbottle review. Antihypertensive medication classes considered for\nanalysis included angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,\nbeta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-type diuretics.\nOther classes had too few individuals taking them to provide stable\nresults. During the medical evaluation, height and weight were\nmeasured and body mass index was calculated. Blood and spot urine\nspecimens were obtained and processed for analysis. Diabetes\nmellitus was defined as a fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dL, a\nnonfasting plasma glucose 200 mg/dL, or a self-reported history of\ndiabetes with concurrent use of antidiabetes medication. Serum\nC-reactive protein (CRP) levels 2 mg/L were defined as elevated.\nEstimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using\nthe Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation,\nAlbuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin to urinary creatinine\nBlood Pressure Measurements\nBlood pressure was measured 3 times during the in-home interview\nand 3 additional times during each of the 2 visits to the mobile\nexamination center. The first visit to the mobile examination center\nwas scheduled within 1 month of the in-home interview, and the\nsecond visit was scheduled on completion of the first visit. The\nmedian duration between consecutive mobile examination center\nvisits was 17 days (minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 48 days).\nThe same standardized protocol and equipment were used for\nmeasuring blood pressure during the in-home and mobile examina-\ntion clinic visits. Blood pressure was measured by a trained research\nassistant during the in-home visit and by a trained clinician during\nthe visit to the mobile examination clinic. Additional details regard-\ning blood pressure measurement and quality control procedures are\nprovided in the NHANES III manual of operations. For systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressure, separately, the second and third measure-\nments from each visit were averaged. Using the mean systolic blood\npressure from each visit, the standard deviation and coefficient of\nvariation of systolic blood pressure across study visits were calcu-\nlated. The standard deviation and coefficient of variation of diastolic\nblood pressure across study visits were also calculated.\nMortality Follow-Up\nAdult NHANES III participants were followed for mortality through\nNHANES III participants with the National Death Index to ascertain\nvital status. Matching was based on 12 identifiers for each participant\n(eg, Social Security number, sex, and date of birth). Identical\nmatching methodology applied to the NHANES I Epidemiological\nFollow-Up Study for validation purposes found that 96.1% of\ndeceased participants and 99.4% of living participants were correctly\nStatistical Analysis\nTwo sets of analyses were conducted, one for standard deviation of\nsystolic blood pressure across study visits and the second for\ncoefficient of variation. The analysis for standard deviation of\nsystolic blood pressure is described below with identical methods\nused for the analysis of coefficient of variation of systolic blood\npressure. Baseline participant characteristics were calculated by\ntertile of standard deviation of systolic blood pressure. Tests for\nlinear trend across tertiles were calculated by including the median of\neach tertile as a continuous variable in linear or logistic regression\nmodels. The association between participant characteristics with\nstandard deviation of systolic blood pressure was assessed using\nlinear regression. Characteristics investigated include age, sex, race\u00ad\nethnicity, physical inactivity, current smoking, body mass index,\ntotal cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, reduced eGFR, albuminuria,\nelevated CRP, history of myocardial infarction (MI), history of\nstroke, mean systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, and antihy-\npertensive medication drug class. Initial regression models included\nadjustment for age, sex, and race\u00adethnicity. A subsequent model\nincluded all variables associated (P0.05) with the standard devia-\ntion of systolic blood pressure in the age-, sex-, and race\u00adethnicity-\nadjusted models.\nNext, hazard ratios for all-cause mortality associated with tertiles\nof the standard deviation of systolic blood pressure, with the lowest\ntertile serving as the referent, were initially calculated unadjusted\nand after age, sex, and race\u00adethnicity adjustment. A subsequent\nmodel included adjustment for age, sex, race, and variables associ-\nated with standard deviation of systolic blood pressure in the age-,\nsex-, and race\u00adethnicity-adjusted models as described above. To\naccount for potential differences in blood pressure resulting from\nmeasurements taken in the home versus clinic setting, as a sensitivity\nanalysis, a final regression model included adjustment for the\ndifference in mean systolic blood pressure between the in-home visit\nand the first mobile examination clinic visit. In addition, secondary\nanalyses restricted to participants not taking antihypertensive medi-\ncation were conducted. Too few participants were taking antihyper-\ntensive medications (n170) to provide valid results among this\ngroup.\nThe association of standard deviation of systolic blood pressure,\nmodeled as a continuous variable, with all-cause mortality was\nevaluated using Cox proportional hazard models and restricted\nquadratic splines with knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of\nsystolic blood pressure distribution. For spline analysis, the 10th,\n50th, and 90th percentiles of the coefficient of variation of systolic\nAnalyses were repeated for tertiles of standard deviation and\ncoefficient of variation of diastolic blood pressure with all-cause\nmortality. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models\nwas confirmed using Schoenfeld residuals. All analyses were con-\nducted without sampling weights as recommended for NHANES III\nsecond examination data using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute).\nMuntner et al Visit-to-Visit Variability in Blood Pressure 161\nhttp://hyper.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nResults\nCorrelates of Visit-to-Visit Variability in Systolic\nBlood Pressure\nThe mean of the standard deviation and coefficient of\nvariation of systolic blood pressure across study visits was\n7.7 mm Hg and 6.1%, respectively. Higher tertiles of the\nstandard deviation of systolic blood pressure across visits\nwere associated with older age, higher total cholesterol levels,\nmean systolic blood pressure, and mean pulse pressure (Table\n1). In addition, individuals in the higher tertiles of standard\ndeviation of systolic blood pressure across study visits were\nmore likely to be physically inactive, have diabetes, reduced\neGFR, albuminuria, elevated CRP, a history of MI or stroke,\nand to use ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel\nblockers, or thiazide-type diuretics.

In addition, unadjusted hazard\nof coefficient of variation in diastolic blood pressure. No\nassociation between variability in diastolic blood pressure\nand mortality was present after adjustment for age, sex,\nrace\u00adethnicity, or other potential confounders.\nDiscussion\nIn this population-based study of US adults, older age, female\nsex, a history of MI, and ACE inhibitor use were associated\nwith higher variability of blood pressure across study visits.\nIn addition, higher visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood\npressure was associated with increased mortality risk over\n14-year follow-up. A significant association was not present\nfor visit-to-visit variability in diastolic blood pressure.\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed for mechanisms\nunderlying higher levels of visit-to-visit variability in systolic\nblood pressure.6,17,18 It has been suggested that arterial stiff-\nness may be one factor leading to higher blood pressure\nvariability.19 In the present study, pulse pressure and older\nage (both directly associated with arterial stiffness) were\nindependently associated with greater visit-to-visit variability\nin systolic blood pressure.20,21 Further, it has been suggested\nthat increased blood pressure variability may additionally be\na manifestation of baroreflex regulation of blood pressure.3,22\nHowever, previous evidence indicates that decreased (not\nincreased) heart rate variability is associated with an in-\ncreased risk of mortality, suggesting that heart rate variability\ndoes not play a role in the relationship between blood\npressure variability and mortality in the current study.23\nAlthough some have suggested that higher blood pressure\nvariability might identify people with subclinical inflamma-\ntion,24 elevated CRP was not associated with increased\nvisit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure in the\ncurrent analysis. Because CRP was measured using a low-\nsensitivity assay in NHANES III, this possible mechanism\nwarrants additional study.\nUse of antihypertensive medications is a potential deter-\nminant of variability in blood pressure.

Although ACE inhibitors were asso-\nciated with higher blood pressure variability after multivari-\nable adjustment, no differences in visit-to-visit variability\nwere present for the other antihypertensive medication\nclasses. The limited sample size of participants taking anti-\nhypertensive medication precluded a direct head-to-head\ncomparison of drug classes.\nOne possible factor to explain the link between antihyper-\ntensive medication use and higher visit-to-visit blood pres-\nsure variability is low medication adherence. In the current\nstudy, an association between visit-to-visit variability and\nincreased risk for all-cause mortality was present among indi-\nviduals not taking antihypertensive medication, suggesting ad-\nherence is not responsible for this association. Nonetheless,\nfuture studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms\nunderlying visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure\nassociated with antihypertensive medication use, different\nclasses of medication, and adherence.\nEvidence suggests that visit-to-visit variability in blood\npressure is reproducible and not a random phenomenon.

The\ncurrent study population included a multiethnic sample of\npatients taking and not taking antihypertensive medications,\nand, unlike most previous studies on visit-to-visit variability\nin blood pressure, participants were not randomized to\ninterventions.\nIn the current study, no association was present between\nvisit-to-visit variability in diastolic blood pressure and all-\ncause mortality. This is consistent with previous research.11,27\nFor example, in the Honolulu Heart Program, variance of\ndiastolic blood pressure across 4 visits was not associated\nwith subsequent coronary heart disease incidence.27 In addi-\ntion, in the UK-TIA study, the visit-to-visit variability in\ndiastolic blood pressure was not associated with stroke, and\nan association was present only in the highest deciles in the\nAnglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial Blood Pressure\nThis study should be interpreted in the context of several\npossible limitations. Most notably, the first set of blood\npressure measurements occurred during an in-home exami-\nnation, whereas the latter 2 sets of measurements occurred in\na medical evaluation conducted in a mobile examination\ncenter. In addition, the in-home blood pressure measurements\nwere obtained by a research assistant, whereas the clinic\nmeasurements were obtained by a physician. However, the\nstudy protocol and equipment used were identical for all\nblood pressure measurements, and adjustment for the change\nin blood pressure between measurements taken in the home\nand clinic setting did not effect the association of visit-to-visit\nvariability with mortality. Another potential limitation is that\nblood pressure measurements were available at only 3 time\npoints. It would be valuable to calculate variability, with\nmore visits occurring over a longer time period. Finally, only\na subsample of participants were asked to attend the second\nclinic examination. Three blood pressure measurements were\nasked to complete the second clinic examination. The small\nsample size prevented us from conducting subgroup analyses\nand investigating cause-specific mortality. Given its strong\nassociation with age, visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood\npressure may prove to have greater prognostic importance\namong older adults. This should be addressed in future\nstudies.\nPerspectives\nVisit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure can be\nidentified in clinical practice, and the natural assumption may\nbe that it is the result of measurement error. However, the\nfindings from the present study suggest that such variability is\nassociated with increased mortality. Additional research is\nneeded to confirm these results, identify the putative mech-\nanisms involved in this association, and evaluate approaches\nto reduce visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure and its\nclinical sequelae.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.
