These reports indicated that Ang II is\ninvolved in the development of kidney diseases and pro-\nteinuria. Although the action of Ang II is basically\nexplained as being on systemic blood pressure and/or\nintra-glomerular pressure-dependent mechanisms, some\nstudies have focused on the pressure-independent mech-\nanism of Ang II action in kidney.10,11 Although the RAS\nwas originally viewed solely as an endocrine system,\nsome recent studies have emphasized that the local RAS\nplays an essential role in maintaining local tissue func-\ntions.12,13 However, the role of the local RAS in regulat-\ning glomerular function is not yet well evaluated.\nIn the field of nephrology, clarification of the mecha-\nnism of proteinuria is one of the most important themes.\nThe filtration barrier of the kidney glomerulus, preventing\nthe leak of plasma proteins into primary urine, comprises\nthree layers: the endothelial cells, the glomerular basement\nmembrane, and the visceral epithelial cells (podocytes). It\nPossible role for glomerular-derived\nangiotensinogen in nephrotic syndrome\nMihoko Yamazaki1,2, Yoshiyasu Fukusumi1, Mutsumi Kayaba1,\nYukina Kitazawa1, Sayuri Takamura1, Ichiei Narita2\nand Hiroshi Kawachi1\n Keywords\nAngiotensinogen, podocyte, slit diaphragm, nephrin\nDepartment of Cell Biology, Kidney Research Center, Niigata\nUniversity Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Japan\nDepartment of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Kidney Research\nCenter, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental\nSciences, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nHiroshi Kawachi, Department of Cell Biology, Kidney Research Center,\nNiigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences,\nEmail: kawachi@med.niigata-u.ac.jp\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nis now accepted that the slit diaphragm (SD), located\nbetween adjacent foot processes of podocytes, functions as\nthe final barrier of the glomerular capillary wall, and that\ndysfunction of the SD is involved in the development of\nproteinuria in several common diseases .14\u00ad16\nWe have previously reported that the ARB ameliorates\nproteinuria in rat nephropathy models in which proteinuria\nresults from SD dysfunction.17,18 In these reports, we\nshowed that ARB reduced proteinuria by preventing the\ndis-localization of the functional molecules of the SD.\nThese observations indicated that the increase in Ang II\naction participates in the development of SD dysfunction.\nHowever, the differential roles of the systemic and local\nRAS in regulating the barrier function of the SD remain to\nbe clarified.\nIn this study, we showed that glomerular expression of\nangiotensinogen (AGT) and the receptors for Ang II were\nclearly increased in the nephrotic models. We also showed\nthat ARB treatment rescued the decreased expression of\nnephrin, a key molecule of the SD, and suppressed the\nincrease of the expression of AGT in nephrotic rat glomer-\nuli. It is conceivable that the promoted local RAS action\nparticipated in SD dysfunction, and that ARB treatment\nameliorated SD injury by blocking the positive feedback\nloop of the activated local Ang II action.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals and cultured podocytes\nAll in vivo experiments were performed using specific path-\nof 7\u00ad8 weeks. All rats used in this study were purchased\nfrom Charles River Japan (Atsugi, Japan), and fed with a\nnormal salt diet. All animal experiments conformed to the\nNational Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Animals. Procedures for the present study were\napproved by the Animal Committee according to the guide-\nlines for animal experimentation of Niigata University. All\nthe animal experiments were conducted in compliance with\nthe protocol which was reviewed by the InstitutionalAnimal\nCare and Use Committee and approved by the President of\nNiigata University (Permit Number: #26, Niigata Univ.\nRes.378-2). Cultivation of conditionally immortalized\nmouse podocytes kindly donated by Dr. P. Mundel (Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) was conducted\nas reported previously.19\nExperimental protocols\nExperiment 1: Analyses of the expression of\nRAS components in nephrotic syndrome models\nANA nephropathy. Two sets of experiments were done. In\neach set nine rats were used. Six rats were intravenously\ninjected with murine monoclonal antibody against rat\nkilled under pentobarbital anesthesia at 1 h and 5 days\nafter the injection. Another three rats were injected with\nvehicle (PBS) and sacrificed at 1 h. After blood sampling,\nthe kidneys were removed, weighed, cut into portions and\nused in immunofluorescence (IF) studies. The remaining\nkidney materials from three rats in each group were pooled\nand used for preparation of glomeruli, and the glomerular\nmaterials were used for reverse transcription polymerase\nchain reaction (RT-PCR) and for Western blot analysis.\nPAN nephropathy.The same as for the study on ANA\nnephropathy, two sets of experiments were performed for\nPAN nephropathy. In each set nine rats were used. Six\nrats were intravenously injected with PAN (100 mg/kg\nb.w.), and three rats each were killed under pentobarbital\nanesthesia at 1 h and 10 days after the injection. Another\nthree rats were injected with vehicle (PBS) and sacrificed\nat 1 h. The samples were prepared as in the ANA nephrop-\nathy experiment.\nExperiment 2: Analysis of the effect of ARB on\nthe expression of AGT and nephrin\nA total of 12 rats were injected with PAN, and six rats were\norally administered with irbesartan (15 mg/kg b.w. per\nday) from 3 days before the injection with PAN, and the\nremaining six rats were treated with distilled water.\nIrbesartan was kindly gifted from Dainippon Sumitomo\nPharma Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan. The treatment of 15 mg/kg\nb.w. per day of irbesartan was confirmed not to affect sys-\ntemic blood pressure18 and to ameliorate proteinuria (day\nwere sacrificed on day 10. Kidney materials were used for\nRT-PCR and IF analyses. The other three rats injected with\nPBS instead of PAN were treated with ARB as described\nabove and sacrificed 10 days after PBS injection.\nReal-time RT-PCR analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR\nwith glomerular RNA was performed according to the\nmethod described previously.17,18 The data are shown as\nratios relative to control findings and expressed as means\n\u00b1 SD of two samples. The primer sequences are summa-\nrized in Table 1.\nImmunofluorescence\nIF studies were performed according to the method previ-\nously reported.21 Antibodies used in this study are as fol-\nlows: rabbit anti-AGT antibody was purchased from\nAbcam (Cambridge, MA, USA), and mouse anti-nephrin\nantibody (ANA: mAb 5-1-6) was prepared as previously\ndescribed.20,21 The following antibodies were used as the\nYamazaki et al. 3\nmarkers for glomerular cells: mouse anti-RECA1 antibody\n(Serotec, Oxford, JE, UK), mouse anti-synaptopodin anti-\nbody (PROGEN, Heidelberg, Germany), mouse anti-\nFITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and RITC-conjugated\nanti-mouse IgG were purchased from DakoCytomation\n(Glostrup, Denmark).\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blot analysis was performed according to the\nmethod described previously.23 Strips of the membrane\nwere exposed to rabbit anti-AGT antibody or rabbit anti--\nactin antibody. Anti--actin antibody was purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO, USA). The\nstrips were then washed and incubated with alkaline phos-\nphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Zymed\nLaboratory Inc. San Francisco, CA, USA).\nResults\nmRNA expression of RAS components was\ndetected in glomeruli and cultured podocytes\nmRNA expression of AGT, renin, ACE, ACE2, neprilysin,\nAT1R and AT2R was detected in isolated rat glomeruli and\nin differentiated cultured podocytes by RT-PCR. The find-\nings are shown in Figure 1.\nGlomerular mRNA expression of RAS\ncomponents was altered in nephrotic rats\nGlomerular mRNA expression of AGT was clearly\nincreased more than 50 times in both nephrotic models.\nThe expression levels were already increased just\nafter disease induction (1 h) in both models. The expres-\nsion levels of Ang II receptors were also increased. The\nexpression of AT1R was clearly doubled when proteinuria\npeaked in both models, although the increase was not evi-\ndent at the early phase (1 h). Expression ofAT2R increased\nby around 10 times at 1 h after disease induction in both\nmodels. On the other hand, expression levels of the\nenzymes RAS, renin, ACE, ACE1 and neprilysin were\ndecreased. The features of the changes in expression of\nRAS components were very similar in the two models. The\nfindings are shown in Figure 2.\nGlomerular expression of AGT was increased at\nthe protein level in nephrotic models\nBands around 50 kd were detected in normal rat glomeru-\nlar lysate with anti-AGT antibody, and the intensity of the\nbands was increased in the glomerular lysates of rats in\nthe nephrotic models. Representative Western blot find-\nings and semi-quantitative data are shown in Figure 3(a).\nThe immunostaining of AGT was observed in a discon-\ntinuous patchy pattern in normal rat glomeruli; the inten-\nsity of the AGT staining increased and its staining pattern\nchanged to a continuous pattern along the capillary loop\nin the nephrotic models (Figure 3(b)). Dual-labeling IF\nanalysis showed that the AGT staining on day 10 of PAN\nnephropathy was clearly different from endothelial cell\nmarker RECA-1 and mesangial cell marker Thy1, and\nmajor portions of AGT were co-stained with a podocyte\nmarker synaptopodin (Figure 3(c)). Positive AGT stain-\ning was detected at the apical surface of tubular cells in\nproteinuric states (Figure 3(b)). Positive AGT staining\nwas observed in normal rat liver section. No clear\nincrease in AGT staining was detected in the nephrotic\nmodels used in this study (data not shown).\nTable 1.

Next, we analyzed the effect of ARB\ntreatment on the expression of RAS components and nephrin.\nThe increase of mRNAexpression ofAGT and the reduction\nof renin, ACE and nephrin at 1 h of PAN nephropathy were\nsuppressed by theARB treatment (Figure 4(a)). The increase\nin the immunostaining of AGT on day 10 of PAN nephropa-\nthy was suppressed by ARB treatment (Figure 4(b)).\nDiscussion\nIt is understood that Ang II contracts efferent arterioles of\nglomeruli more effectively than afferent arterioles, and\nthat the consequent glomerular hypertension damages the\nglomeruli and enhances proteinuria. Thus, it has been\naccepted that RAS inhibitors have a protective role for kid-\nney glomeruli and ameliorate proteinuria by reducing glo-\nmerular hypertension. However, some recent reports have\nshown that RAS inhibitors reduce proteinuria indepen-\ndently to intra-glomerular pressure.10,11 It is also reported\nthat Ang II acts directly on glomerular podocytes.17,24\nFrom these observations, it is now accepted that the action\nof Ang II directly damages the barrier function of podo-\ncytes, and RAS inhibitors ameliorate proteinuria by pro-\ntecting podocytes. However, the pathogenic mechanism of\nhow Ang II acts on podocytes is still unclear. Durvasula\net al. showed that cultured podocytes actively synthesize\nAGT if they are stimulated by stretch or a high-glucose\ncondition.25,26 The reports suggested that the local RAS\nparticipates in the development of podocyte injury. On the\nother hand, Matsusaka et al. reported that Ang II action-\ndependent nephropathy could be induced in podocyte-\nspecific AGT knockout mice, indicating that the systemic\nRAS plays a major role in inducing podocyte damage.27\nThus the role of the local RAS in podocyte injury is still\ncontroversial.\nIn this study we first analyzed the expression of RAS\ncomponents in isolated glomeruli and in cultured podo-\ncytes. mRNA expression of all major components of the\nRAS was detected (Figure 1). Expression of AGT in nor-\nmal rat glomeruli was also observed with immunohisto-\nchemical analysis, although the staining was not very\nintense. It is conceivable that these observations suggest\nthat the local RAS might have a physiological role in\nmaintaining glomerular function.\nNext, to elucidate the role of the local RAS in the devel-\nopment of podocyte injury, we analyzed the expression of\nRAS components in nephrotic models. We adopted two\nnephrotic models, ANA nephropathy and PAN nephropa-\nthy. ANA nephropathy is caused by a one-shot injection of\nthe antibody against nephrin, a key molecule of the SD.\nProteinuria in ANA nephropathy is induced by the rear-\nrangement of nephrin and other functional molecules of\nthe SD without participation of any inflammatory factors\nas an experimental model of human minimal change\nnephrotic syndrome. PAN has toxicity specifically to\npodocytes. Although the precise pathogenic mechanism of\nPAN nephropathy has not yet been elucidated, it is accepted\nthat the disarrangement of the SD molecules is involved in\nWe found that glomerular mRNA expression of AGT is\ndramatically increased in both models from just after dis-\nease induction, and that the increase of AGT expression\nwas maintained when proteinuria peaked (Figure 2). The\nincreased expression of AGT in glomeruli was also\ndetected in the immunohistochemical analysis and Western\nblot study with glomerular lysates (Figure 3(a, b)).\nFigure 1. mRNA expression of RAS components.\nRepresentative agarose-gel electrophoretic patterns of RT-PCR.\nmRNA expression of AGT, renin, ACE, ACE2, neprilysin, AT1R and\nAT2R was detected in isolated rat glomeruli and in differentiated\ncultured podocytes.\nYamazaki et al. 5\nFigure 2. Glomerular mRNA expression of RAS components in nephrotic rats.\nGlomerular mRNA expression of AGT is evidently increased in both models. Expression levels of AT1R and AT2R were increased. Expression of re-\nnin, ACE, ACE1 and neprilysin was decreased. The data are shown as ratios relative to control findings and expressed as means \u00b1 SD of two samples.\n6 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nDual-labeling IF study with glomerular cell markers\nshowed AGT was mainly expressed in podocytes in glo-\nmeruli (Figure 3(c)).\nIn this study we also showed that the mRNA expression\nof AT1R was clearly increased in the nephrotic stage in\nboth models. By contrast, the expression of renin and ACE\nwas decreased (Figure 2). These enzymes might be\ndecreased to suppress the effect of the dramatic increase of\nAGT production. Although the meaning of the changes in\nthe expression of the RAS molecules in glomeruli is not\nwell explained, these observations suggest that local RAS\nactivity is basically regulated by the amount of the\nsubstrate, AGT, and that the increased production of AGT\nin podocytes contributes to podocyte injury in an autocrine\nmanner.\nIt should be mentioned that the increase of the protein\nlevel of AGT was not remarkable if compared with the\ndecrease of the level of mRNA. Although it is difficult to\nexplain the precise reason for this discrepancy, it is plausible\nthat some post-translational pathway suppressed the increase\nof the AGT protein. It is also plausible that some negative\nfeedback pathway enhanced the degradation of AGT.\nAnother important finding we should mention is that\nATR2 expression also increased in both nephrotic models.\nFigure 3. Glomerular expression of AGT and nephrin in nephrotic rats.\n(a) Western blot analysis. AGT-specific bands around 50 kd were detected in normal rat glomerular lysate, and the intensity of the bands was\nincreased in the glomerular lysates of rats in the nephrotic models. Semi-quantitative data of the band density are shown. (b) IF findings of AGT and\nnephrin. AGT staining was increased and its staining pattern changed to a continuous linear-like pattern along the capillary loop. Positive AGT stain-\ning was detected at the apical surface of tubular cells in proteinuric states. (c) Dual-labeling IF analysis: AGT staining on day 10 of PAN nephropathy\nwas clearly different from the endothelial cell marker RECA-1 and the mesangial cell marker Thy1, and major portions of AGT were co-stained with\na podocyte marker synaptopodin.\nYamazaki et al. 7\nWe have previously reported that AT2R-mediated Ang II\naction has a function opposite to AT1R-mediated Ang II\naction.17 It is thought that the increase of AT2R is a protec-\ntive response to suppress AT1R-mediated Ang II action.\nIt is reported that the local tissue RAS is enhanced if\nthe cells are stimulated,25,26,31 and that the activated local\nRAS participates in tissue injury in an autocrine or par-\nacrine manner. A recent report implied that if the cells\nare stimulated with Ang II, the Ca++ channel was acti-\nvated and the consequent increase of Ca++ influx\nenhanced the local RAS in a positive feedback loop.31 In\nthis study we observed that glomerular mRNA expres-\nsion of AGT increased remarkably in nephrotic models,\nand the increase of AGT was also observed by immuno-\nhistochemistry. We observed that the increase in AGT\nstaining in liver is not clear in the nephrotic models.\nThese observations suggest that the local RAS may be\ninvolved in the development of the nephrotic models.\nARB is widely used for patients showing proteinuria,\nincluding in steroid-resistant nephropathy.32 In this\nstudy, we also observed that the ARB treatment sup-\npressed the increase of the glomerular expression of\nAGT, and inhibited the decrease of the expression of SD\nmolecules, and then ameliorated proteinuria in the\nnephrotic model (Figure 4). The observations suggest\nthat the local RAS participated in SD dysfunction, and\nthat ARB treatment protected the SD by blocking the\npositive feedback loop of the local action of Ang II.\nThis is the first report showing that the expression of\nAGT in podocytes was evidently increased in nephrotic\nstates and the increased expression of glomerular AGT\nwas suppressed by ARB treatment. It is conceivable that\nthe promoted local RAS participates in the development of\nnephrotic syndrome.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFigure 4.
