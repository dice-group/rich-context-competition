In a meta-analysis of VM and video self-monitoring\n(VSM), Bellini and Akullian (2007) found that respondents\nwith ASD are able to copy positive behavior modeled on\ntelevision (by themselves or others) if they recognize them-\nselves in the film; however, they must already have the abil-\nity to act in the desired way and to understand the modeled\nbehavior as desirable. Most early studies used videos to dem-\nonstrate the desired behavior to students, who learned by\nobserving and copying. But what happens when the students\ndo not have insight into their own behavior?\nA study by Greatz et al. (2006) showed that students who\nare unaware of their unwanted behaviors have difficulty elim-\ninating it and displaying only the desired behavior. Dratsch\net al. (2013) found that people with autism are impaired in\ndetecting direct gaze, and therefore also have a deficit in per-\nceiving social cues. This deficit makes it more difficult for\nthem to develop social skills than it is for people with no such\ndeficit. The aim of this study was to examine how an inter-\nvention that focused the respondents on certain cues might\nhelp them to develop their social skills. Shulman, Guberman,\nShiling, and Bauminger (2012) found that when discussing\nsocial and moral issues, people with ASD showed less flexi-\nbility than other people, less abstract thought, and less ability\nto adapt their judgment to different contexts and situations.\nThey used pictures of undesired behaviors in their study, and\ncompared 18 respondents withASD with 18 respondents with\ntypical development. The authors discussed the specific\nimplications of these findings for education in the field of\nsocial and moral education, but they may have placed too\nmuch importance on abstract thinking, flexibility, and gener-\nalization to new contexts when trying to understand the\nrespondents' reasoning. There is a risk that individuals with\nASD use other ways of dealing with social interactions that\nwe do not yet have tools to capture. Even if there has been\nfound positive results regarding social review, the studies are\nnot explicitly based on a theory of learning. Instead, research\non autism has increasingly focused on the development of\nsocial skills, and various methods have been tested. Variation\ntheory has previously been used to demonstrate that social\nskills can be developed in structured situations that allow\n1University of Gothenburg, Sweden\n2Kristianstad University, Sweden\n3Municipality of H\u00e4ssleholm, Sweden\nCorresponding Author:\nMona Holmqvist Olander, Department of Pedagogical, Curricular and\nGothenburg, Sweden.\nEmail: mona.holmqvist@gu.se\nSocial Review as a Tool for Developing\nSocial Skills: Using Contrasting Cases\nMona Holmqvist Olander1,2 and Helen Burman3\n Keywords\nbehavioral sciences, nonverbal, interpersonal communication, human communication, communication studies, communication,\nsocial sciences, education, educational measurement and assessment, learning disabilities, special education\n2 SAGE Open\nrespondents to discern specific differences between their own\nbehavior and the desired behavior, however not regarding\n(2005) said that \"little progress has been made in identifying\nthe critical components of video models and video models\nand video based instruction\" (p. 195), and we have tried to\nmake progress by taking departure from a theory of learning.\nIn this study, the conjectures in variation theory have been\nused to analyze what the respondents seem to discern from\nthe material in relation to their changed behavior. The theo-\nretical framework is based on an assumption that learning\nrequires discernment, simultaneity, and variation intertwined\nin every learning situation (Lo, 2012). The design offers the\nrespondents, one by one, to discern what behavior should be\nmodified. Previous studies on social review have mainly not\nbeen based on a learning theory to design the instruction. In\nthis study, the theoretical point of departure was that the\nrespondents needed to be offered simultaneity in the learning\nsituation by showing two different situations (variation) from\nthe same respondent (invariant) and social activity (invari-\nant). By that the aspect that we want them to focus on is\nvaried against an invariant background; two different ways\nto behave by the same person in the same situation. This is\ncalled to design learning situation based on \"patterns of vari-\nation\" (Lo & Marton, 2012), which has been found very\npowerful in different kinds of instruction (Marton & Tzu,\n2004). Results have also pointed out the gain for teachers'\nlearning to design more powerful instructions by the use of\nHolmqvist, Gustavsson, & Wernberg, 2008).\nThe social review method, using VSM, records the stu-\ndent performing one targeted behavior on videotape and ana-\nlyzes the film with the student, using a guide to structure the\nlearning (Quill, 1995). Several studies have used this method\nin various ways aimed to make the student aware of his or\nher behavior (McConell, 2002). This use of videotape differs\nfrom that of VM, in which the desired behavior is modeled to\nthe student, often by another person. In social review, how-\never, the person's own behavior is usually in focus. It is not\ndifficult in VM to show a person modeling the desired behav-\nior; however, VSM relies on the students'own performances.\nIf students do not evince the desired behavior in the video,\nwithout seeing a clear example or contrast with unwanted\nbehavior they may believe they act appropriately. Bellini and\nAkullian (2007) showed that VM and VSM intervention\nstrategies met the criteria for an evidence-based study design.\nTheir results showed that it was essential for students to see\nthe desired, rather than the undesired behavior, to raise their\nawareness and motivation to acquire the model behavior. In\ntheir 2007 study, Bellini and Akullian (Bellini & Akullian,\n2007) edited out unwanted behaviors and used videos that\nshowed the students the desired behavior only, arguing that\nthe skill should be learned through positive examples. This\nstrategy was also used by Hitchcock, Dowrick, and Prater\n(2003), who argued that seeing their own success would\nstrengthen the students' belief in their capacity to behave\nappropriately. Hitchcock et al. described the two different\napproaches:\nObserving a superior level of performance that would indicate\nfuture mastery of behavior is a key element. The video is\nconstructed by identifying and filming images of a desired\nbehavior and editing to create an \"exemplary\" sample of the\nperson performing the desired skill. This view is in contrast to\n\"feedback,\" which involves review of past or current\nperformance, including errors or deficits. Thus, feedback may\ninclude a focus or discussion of errors in performance, which is\ncontrary to the philosophy of building new skills through a\npositive, errorless approach. (p. 39)\nHowever, some studies use examples of desired and unde-\nsired behaviors to encourage change. Greatz et al. (2006)\nstudied a student who had no knowledge of his unwanted\nbehavior. He thought that he behaved appropriately, and thus\nwas not open to a learning situation until agreement was\nattained between the student and the teacher about the desired\nbehavior. They videotaped his behavior, then edited the vid-\neos and showed the student separate films of the desired and\nthe undesired behaviors to clarify and make the student\naware of his current behavior. The authors of this study point\nout the difficulty of making these students understand which\nbehaviors they need to change as they are more or less\nunaware of their own behavior.\nI knew that this differed from what most effective teaching\npractices encourage; errorless performance that accentuates the\npositive . . . there was a reason for him to actually see his\nIn the two different videos, one about a minute long caught\nthe student in the desired behavior, and the other captured the\nunwanted behavior. This method, of course, requires that\nthe student at some point present the desired behavior. In the\nintervention, the film with the unwanted behavior was shown\nfirst to clarify for the student and raise his awareness about\nhow he had behaved. The teacher commented throughout to\nclarify what the student was doing and what effect his behav-\nior had. The student responded by sitting calmly and saying,\n\"Oh no!\" After that, the film with the desired behavior was\nshown. The teacher commented throughout this video as well.\nIn this case, the student responded by becoming jubilant and\nsaying, \"That's me!\" The student recognized himself and\nshowed awareness about the differences in his behavior\nbetween the two films. He frequently watched the \"good\"\nmovie after that, and when he relapsed into the unwanted\nbehavior, a reminder of the \"good\" movie immediately\nchanged his behavior. This effect, however, requires the stu-\ndent to have an interest in watching television and an under-\nstanding of what happens in the videos.\nwhether people with ASD learn visually and whether they\nHolmqvist Olander and Burman 3\nlike to watch TV, and found that they do on both counts.\nAccording to Bellini and Akullian (2007), people with ASD\nlike to look at themselves, and this was especially obvious\nin tapes that showed them succeeding. The results also show\nthat children with ASD find it easier to imitate actors who\nresemble themselves in some way. Because it is not always\npossible to capture on video examples of the students per-\nforming the wanted behavior, the use of actors with whom\nthey can identify is an important alternative. Greatz et al.\nargued that the use of videotape is useful in this group\nbecause neither eye contact nor social interaction is required.\nIn addition, the use of videotape allows clear delineation of\ndesired (and undesired) behaviors and gives students the\nopportunity to focus completely on themselves and their\nbehaviors. Banda et al. studied which skills were developed\nin the target group through video observations and found\nthey were primarily the skills needed in everyday activities\n(daily living), communication and social skills, which indi-\ncated that the use of videotape was an effective method. But\nacademic skills and undesirable behaviors were also posi-\ntively affected. A main difference between VM and VSM is\nthat any person can play the role in VM, whereas in VSM\nthe pupil in the learning situation enacts the behavior in the\nstudies of students with ASD using either VM or VSM. The\nstimuli were divided into five groups according to the actor\nof the role in the films: adults, other students (peers) similar\nto the students in the learning situation, the students them-\nselves performing the desired behavior, hands only visible\nin a film illustrating the performance of a skill, and a mix-\nture of the four designs. The study showed that films with\nthe most significant influence were those in which the stu-\ndents played the role (VSM), followed by those enacted by\ntheir peers.\nAlthough the methods of VM and VSM are time-con-\nsuming, results indicate the time is well spent. Banda et al.\n(2007) argued that it is important for teachers to understand\nthat despite the initial time and expensive technology\ninvolved in implementing a video method, VM was in fact\neconomical because the same peer-acted videos could be\nused for many students with the same needs. Bellini and\nAkullian (2007) found no clear evidence of difference\nbetween the results for VM versus VSM, but that the ability\nto generalize knowledge seemed to increase with VSM. This\nies of VM and VSM, which showed even in early research\non influencing behavior and perspective-taking skills by\nvideo analysis, VSM was more effective for developing\nsocial skills. Bellini and Akullian conducted a meta-analysis\nof 23 different case studies of VM and VSM with people\nwith ASD and found that both were effective strategies for\nstrengthening social and communication skills, living skills,\nand behavior. This was true for children and adolescents\nwith ASD. The results showed that the methods enhanced\nthe ability to acquire skills that were maintained over time,\nand that was generalized among students and situations.\nThis result was consistent with results from Hitchcock et al.\nnosed and undiagnosed students.\nThe aim of this study is to, based on a theory of learning,\ncompare in what ways two different cases of the use of self-\nmonitoring videotapes for developing social skills in adoles-\ncents with ASD facilitates their social behavior studied with\na micro-level approach. The design of the study is based on a\ntheory on learning: Variation theory and the theoretical con-\njectures have been used to design the instruction. The pattern\nof contrast has been used to offer the respondents to discern\nthe undesired and desired behavior at the same time to model\nthe wanted behavior.\nMethod\nTwo 15-year-old male students who attended a special class\nin school were chosen to be included in this case study. Both\nhad a diagnosis of autism, along with other cognitive dis-\nabilities, and both were verbal and able to understand events\nshown on a television screen. In the first case (A, Adam),\nCarol Gray's (1995) method of social review was used, with\nvideo recordings aimed at teaching students to \"read\" social\nsituations and thereby improve their social and communica-\ntive interactions with the environment. Because the student\nin this case believed he already exhibited the desired behav-\nior shown in the video, he was also shown a video demon-\nstrating the undesired behavior to show the difference\nbetween them. In Case B, Bill, social review was combined\nwith VSM, as one aim of the study was to model the wanted\nbehavior. However, this method was further developed by\nadding a contrast between wanted and unwanted behavior by\nshowing two different video clips of the respondent in both\nkinds of behavior. In Case B, three different situations were\nvideotaped on three different occasions. The first showed a\nstructured manual learning situation (a domestic science les-\nson) in a large group. This situation was filmed many times\nto capture desired and undesired behaviors. The second situ-\nation that was filmed was a structured theoretical situation in\nthe classroom. This time the students were working in a\nsmall group, as they normally did. During the lesson, about\nfour students sat around a table with one or two adults and\neither worked with their weekly journals and summed up the\nweek's work with text and pictures or played games. The\nthird videotaped situation was during recess, when the\nrespondents had break outside together with other pupils and\nwere free to choose whatever they wanted to do. During the\nstructured situations, one camera on a tripod was placed in\nthe room and directed at the respondent. The unstructured\nsituation required other methods to videotape, because the\nrespondents were moving freely in the schoolyard. The\nresearcher held the camera and followed the respondents\nduring those situations. All films were 20 min long. The\nfilms were then reviewed for appropriate clips of desired and\n4 SAGE Open\nundesired behavior, and a 2-min clip from the structured\npractical situation (domestic science lesson) was produced,\nas suggested also by Shukla-Mehta, Miller, and Callahan\nResults\nThe results of this study show thatAdam and Bill, in response\nto social review with videos, were able to change their\nbehavior and to articulate what they were and were not per-\nmitted to do. Analyses of the films showed that the respon-\ndents became aware of the focus on their behavior in the\nlearning situation and were surprised when they saw their\nunwanted behavior in the edited video. The contrast between\ndesired and undesired behavior was clear and helped the\nrespondents to be aware of the difference. At a 6-month fol-\nlow-up, they still referred to the film clips to modify their\nbehaviors in other situations as well as in the original learn-\ning environment.\nCase A--Adam\nAs the videos were played, Adam was asked four questions:\n(a) Who do you see in the movie? (b) What are the people\ndoing in the movie? (c) Are they talking to each other or are\nthey doing anything together? (Is there some kind of inter-\naction or communication between the people in the movie?)\nand (d) What do the people in the movie say? It is worth\nnoting that the student saw the movie many times and he\ndiscovered new things each time. It took time for him to\nperceive anyone other than himself. To answer Question 1,\nAdam needed to see the video sequence only once. To\nanswer the remaining questions, he watched the movie\nsequence 4 times for each question. In total, Adam saw the\nThe first step was to identify a social situation needed to\nbe improved. A video sequence was selected that showed\nAdam acting in his accustomed manner in a recognizable\nsituation in the kitchen where he worked. He was impulsive\nand talked directly to the intercom receiver when he was\nworking in the kitchen. The student's deficiencies in proce-\ndural memory made him lose focus easily, forget quickly\nwhat he should do and how to do it, and lose control of his\nmovements when talking about anything other than what he\nwas doing at the moment. He was in need of continuous\ndirection from the teacher, which, along with the other fac-\ntors, became irritating to the adults in the situation, who also\nneeded to correct and direct the student.\nThe second step was to watch the clip with no sound and\nask Adam, the four questions. The questions aimed to collect\ninformation about how he perceived the situation with only\nvisual information (the aspect sound was removed). For\nQuestion 1, \"Who do you see in the movie?\" Adam looked\nall over the kitchen but could not name anyone until he saw\nhimself. Seeing himself seemed to orient him and he was\nthen also able to recognize the others. Question 2, \"What are\npeople in the video doing?\" was more difficult. He focused\non himself and what he was doing in the video, but did not\nseem aware of what others were doing. During the second\nshowing of the video, Adam was asked direct questions\nabout what each person was doing, and with such strong ori-\nentation toward the targeted persons, one at a time, he was\nable to answer. However, he needed to watch 4 times to cap-\nture what everyone actually did; in comparison, what he\nseems usually to be aware of in daily life is very limited. He\nalso had problems talking about anyone else than himself in\nthe video, and the third question, \"Are they talking to each\nother or are they doing anything together?\" (Is there some\nkind of interaction or communication between the people in\nthe movie?) was even more difficult than the second. In the\nclip, Adam talked to the teacher twice, and this he knew\nbecause he had turned toward the camera, which the teacher\nwas managing. Although he saw the clip 4 times he could not\nsee that there was no communication or interaction between\nthe others. Of course, the sound was turned off, but he was\nunable to infer any interaction from actions, expressions, or\nglances, as people usually do when looking through a win-\ndow or inside a car.\nThe last question, intended to gather information about\nhow Adam perceived the situation with sound turned on,\nwas: \"What are the people in the video saying?\" He could\nhear that he was talking all the time and that he talked about\nmany things. After having watched and listened 4 times\nAdam identified that the teacher had asked him to do the\ndishes. However, he never heard that a classmate had told\nhim several times that he would wash the dishes. He did not\nnotice that two of his classmates were talking to each other or\nwhat they said. The analysis of the three initial steps showed\nthat Adam had many characteristics that were typical of\nASD. He was extremely self-centered and did not seem to\ncare about what other people said or did. He neither saw any\nother person nor heard them if he was not very strongly\nguided, and he had to watch the clips several times for each\nquestion to say what had actually happened. The others'\ninteractions and communications seemed to be of no interest\nto him. This may be explained by his lack of a theory of\nmind, or it may be due to selective perception caused by the\nstudent's brain being unable to integrate all the sensory input\nadequately (Adler & Adler, 2006). Through his single focus\non himself, excluding all the other people and what they\nwere doing, he fit very well the picture of a person with ASD\nThe fourth step was to compare and share perspectives\nabout the situation in the film. When the teacher and Adam\ndiscussed what was different between the expressed aware-\nness of each of them, he became aware of the teacher's\ninterpretation of the video. This shift in perspective made\nAdam see how he talked constantly and lost focus on his\nwork, and he realized that he should concentrate more on his\nwork. When he said this he seemed to be a bit disappointed\nHolmqvist Olander and Burman 5\nand lowered his head. It was obvious that this was some-\nthing he had heard the teachers say to him quite often. When\nhe was asked what he meant, he could not find an answer,\nbut said after a moment that he should be quieter. As he\nseemed disappointed in himself, the situation was changed\nto make him feel more comfortable. Another film clip\nshowed Adam working diligently. Although he was still\ntalking quite a bit and often, this time he talked about what\nhe was doing or was going to do. The contrast between the\nclips was clear. He looked happier and he commented that\nhe worked better when he was concentrating on his work,\neven though he was talking. It seemed that Adam needed to\nverbalize his thoughts, and did not seem to be aware that in\nsome cases he was disturbing the rest of the class with his\nloud talking. When viewing the videos, the teacher and\nAdam discussed (a) the student's loud and careless way of\ntalking, (b) the difference between thinking and talking, (c)\nthe propriety of talking about the task at hand, and (d) the\npossibility of working without speaking. When the discus-\nsion was finished and he was asked about what he had\nlearned, Adam replied, \"I must concentrate and work qui-\netly, but I can talk about what I am doing right at the\nmoment.\" He had apparently always been told, by different\nadults and in different ways, that he should be quiet and con-\ncentrate, but no one had really sat down and tried to sort out\nand clarify in detail how Adam understood this and what he\nshould do instead. Because he is not severely mentally\nretarded, people seemed to take for granted that he under-\nstood what they meant and that he could see himself from\ntheir perspectives, but he seemed genuinely surprised when\nhe saw his behavior in the video clips. The training situation\nended with a written sentence, which Adam himself com-\nposed: \"I'm going to concentrate and work quietly, but I can\ntalk about what I am doing right now,\" to disseminate to\ninterested adults in his environment. The written sentence\nwas an important tool for him as a reminder of how he could\ntransfer learning from this situation to other future situa-\ntions. Observations afterward have shown that the written\nsentence is a more powerful tool for him in coping with\nwork situations than are verbal instructions.\nThis changed not only the way Adam experienced his\nteachers and other students, but also the way the teachers\nexperienced his behavior. Before seeing the video, the teach-\ners thought Adam was extremely repetitive and that he talked\naloud all the time. During the recording, the staff was respon-\nsible for ensuring all the students' lunches were prepared on\ntime and the kitchen was left ready for a new group after-\nward. The staff would also ensure that all three students\nworked with the right equipment and measured out the cor-\nrect amounts of the correct ingredients. It was in many ways\na stressful situation for the staff and probably why they did\nnot have as much tolerance toward him as was required.\nWhen the film was observed in a nonstressful situation, to\nselect a sequence showing the student's lack of communica-\ntion and interaction and problems it caused, the observers\nwere certain that there would be many sequences to choose\nfrom. Surprisingly, however, Adam tended to work well and\ndo what he was supposed to, although he did talk loudly and\nconstantly. Interestingly, he usually talked about what he was\ndoing. He was motivated during the class in which he made\nhis lunch. Not until he came to class in the kitchen after lunch\nto do cleaning did he begin to talk about other things; when\nhe talked about topics other than the task at hand, then he lost\ncontrol of his movements and could not wash dishes\nanymore.\nCase B--Bill\nThe second case was designed based on the findings of the\nfirst case, and the results that Adam and his teachers' views\nwere changed by the videos were seen as important to fol-\nlow-up. Case B, Bill, was more structured than the first, by\ndefining three different situations to be filmed for 20 min\neach, before and after the intervention. Bill was also loud,\nand the study aimed to decrease his noise-making and teach\nthe student to control this behavior in the structured situa-\ntion. The first filmed sequence was of domestic science les-\nson in a large group (B1); the second was a structured\ntheoretical situation in the classroom (B2), working as\nusual in a small group; and the third situation was a non-\nstructured situation, at recess outside with other students\n(B3). The structured situation (B1) was targeted, and from\nthis one clip each with desired and undesired behavior was\nchosen, for a total of 2 min of videotape. After this, an anal-\nysis was made of all the 20-min films and his desired and\nundesired behaviors were counted to see whether they\nincreased or decreased after the intervention, and whether\nthere were any differences in his behavior attributable to\nthe different situations. The first film began with Bill at\nrest. He started to work very well, moving as he liked, and\nthere were no demands on him. The observation situation,\nwith a person following him with a camera, seemed a bit\nembarrassing for the student, and staff confirmed that the\nstudent's behavior was unnatural and not representative of\nhim during the second break situation when the camera and\ncameraman were present. The analysis shows that Bill's\nbehavior deteriorated from 3 to 7, to 10 deviations from\npre-intervention to post intervention, to 6-month follow-up\nwhen he was filmed during this situation. When he was in\nthe classroom with his regular classmates, the unwanted\nbehavior decreased after the learning situation from eight\nincidents to none. However, at the follow-up after 6 months\nthree incidents were noted, but as he was going to change\nschools in a few weeks he was likely at a higher level of\nstress at the follow-up. In the structured practical situation,\nthe student, even though he was in a group of students other\nthan his own classmates, and although he had different\nassistants on each film, greatly enhanced his performance\nfrom 37 deviations to 6 after the learning situation and only\n3 at the follow-up 6 months later (Table 1).\n6 SAGE Open\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to compare in what ways two dif-\nferent cases to the use of self-monitoring videotapes for\ndeveloping social skills in adolescents with ASD facilitates\ntheir social behavior studied at a micro-level approach\n(Lavrakas, 2008). The point of departure was variation the-\nory (Marton & Booth, 1997). Based on the conjectures of the\ntheoretical framework, the desired behavior was made dis-\ncernible by contrasting the undesired and the desired behav-\nior to see the difference at the same time by the use of varying\nthe way the respondents did behave. The situation and person\n(the respondent) were the same (invariant). The video\nsequences from different times but showing the same kind of\nsituations, but showing the students behaving in different\nways. Before Adam and Bill saw themselves on the film,\nthey were not expressly aware of their own behavior. By that,\nit was difficult to understand what the teachers wanted them\nto change as the thought they did behave more or less as they\nwere told to. When they were shown the wanted and\nunwanted behaviors, it seemed to clarify things they had\nalready been asked to do or not to do several times during\ntheir school years. Previous studies of VM have shown posi-\ntive results in students' behavior, as they copy and adopt the\nmodeled behavior in the video. In this case, both students\nthought they were already acting in the desired way, and did\nnot understand what they were being asked to change. The\nquestion in these two case studies was how to make them\naware of their actual behavior and learn to change it. The\ndesign in this study was based on variation theory, and\naspects of the different behaviors were made discernible by\nthe use of contrast. The teachers used an edited film of differ-\nent behaviors to make Adam and Bill aware of the difference\nbetween unwanted and wanted behaviors. When the students\nwere shown exemplary behavior immediately followed by a\ncontrasting film with the unwanted behavior, they could see\nthe clear contrast and assimilate the knowledge of how to\nbehave in different situations.\nThere seems to be a kind of transfer in this kind of learn-\ning, as found in other studies that have shown how students\ncould later relate to the films and correct their own behavior\n(Greatz et al., 2006). Transfer has also been found in studies\nbased on variation theory, called generative learning\n(Holmqvist, Gustavsson, & Wernberg, 2007). The analysis\nof the films shows that Adam became aware of the learning\nsituation and surprised when he saw his deviance in an edited\nfilm. He was positive and happy, however, when he next saw\nthe film with the desired behavior of his working an exem-\nplary way. The contrast was clear and helped the student to\nsee the difference. In Case B, Bill was helped by the learning\nsituation for at least 6 months, reducing his deviant behavior\nfrom 37 to 3 in the kitchen (practical instruction) and from 8\nto 3 in the classroom, and could also generalize that learning\nto other school situations.\nIn conclusion, Adam and Bill could clearly see the con-\ntrast in their behavior when shown the clips of themselves in\ndirect succession. They seem to have increased awareness,\nbecome more conscious, and been able to assimilate this new\nknowledge of themselves and to change their behavior for\nthe better in theoretical and practical structured situations.\nBill's behavior in the unstructured break situation showed\nthat he viewed being followed by a cameraman as an abnor-\nmal and uncomfortable situation. This was not very surpris-\ning, because Bill was usually free of demands during recess\nand able to behave as he liked, while being filmed made him\nself-conscious and disturbed his natural way of acting. In the\nstructured situations, he was used to having demands and\nbeing observed, and the teachers found him to behave as\nusual during filming of these parts. The method of social\nreview in a design using clips of desired and undesired\nbehavior improved the students' awareness of their behavior\nand their willingness and ability to change it.\nThe limitations and shortcomings of this study is the small\nnumber of students; however, in this case, the aim was to fol-\nlow Adam and Bill during a long period of time and with a\nmicro-level approach. Moreover, we had no controls, which\nwould seem impossible, as people with this diagnosis are all\nvery different. Even if it seems that the contrast in behaviors\nshown by the two different clips allows the students to\nachieve the insight and new knowledge that allows them to\nchange their behavior, the results have to be followed-up in\nfuture research with other respondents in different ages and\nwith other symptoms. The method of filming with a video\ncamera and editing the film on the computer, however, was\ndifficult and would not be possible for all teachers to accom-\nplish. It required technical equipment, all the different com-\nponents of which had to be compatible with each other, as\nwell as special editing software to be installed on the com-\nputers. If it could be made more user-friendly to teachers and\nother personal, this method could be used in several situa-\ntions where changed behavior is required, from school to\nforensic psychiatric care.\nTable 1. Deviations in Making Loud Sounds for Respondent B.\nDeviations during the 20-min\nvideotapes\nUnstructured\nbreak (recess)\nStructured instruction\nsituation (classroom)\nPractical instruction\nsituation (kitchen)\nSix months after the intervention 10 3 3\nHolmqvist Olander and Burman 7\nThe conclusion is that using the method and base it on a\ntheory on learning (variation theory) also provides an oppor-\ntunity for exchange between the students and teachers, which\nmay (based on their spontaneous remarks) increase the\nteachers' understanding of the students. However, this also\nneeds to be studied further, as such a claim cannot be made\nby this limited study. Even if it is time-consuming to edit the\nfilm on the computer, the results in a long-term perspective\nare worth it as the behavior monitored in high degree is expe-\nrienced as bothering in the environment. Ayres and Langone\n(2005) asked how the positive results of using video can be\nused by the teachers. One powerful direction for future\nresearch is to study more cases and based on the results\ndevelop some kind of software helping the teachers to create\nvideo clips for instructional purposes used to decrease\nsocially obstructive behavior making integration easier in the\nfuture as people with ASD could easier understand what we\nmean in a concrete way that complement the verbal instruc-\ntions. Building bridges between our different understandings\nof the same situation might facilitate the integration in\nsociety.\n"
