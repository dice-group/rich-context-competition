    "abstract": "Abstract\nIt is well acknowledged that innovation is a key success factor in the mobile service domain. Having creative ideas is the first\ncritical step in the innovation process. Many studies suggest that customers are a valuable source of creative ideas. However,\nthe literature also shows that adults may be constrained by existing technology frames, which are known to hinder creativity.\nInstead young children (aged 7-12) are considered digital natives yet are free from existing technology frames. This led us to\nstudy them as a potential source for creative mobile service ideas. A set of 41,000 mobile ideas obtained from a research\nproject in 2006 granted us a unique opportunity to study the mobile service ideas from young children. We randomly\nselected two samples of ideas (N = 400 each); one contained the ideas from young children, the other from adults (aged\n17-50). These ideas were evaluated by several evaluators using an existing creativity framework. The results show that the\nmobile service ideas from the young children are significantly more original, transformational, implementable, and relevant\nthan those from the adults. Therefore, this study shows that young children are better sources of novel and quality ideas\nthan adults in the mobile services domain. This study bears significant contributions to the creativity and innovation research.\nIt also indicates a new and valuable source for the companies that seek creative ideas for innovative products and services.\n",

In this article, mobile\nservice is used as an umbrella term to refer to mobile apps,\nmobile software-as-a-service, hardware, and any combina-\ntions of them. Several changes occurred in the mobile ser-\nvice market since the Apple App Store, the Google Play\nstore, and the Nokia Ovi store started opening in 2007 (Lane\net al., 2010). These platforms have revolutionized the con-\ncept of the mobile phone, hosting the release of new content\nevery day. Nowadays, the majority of mobile devices require\nservices such as voice and data services, SMS (Short Message\nService), video streaming, location-based services, and so\nforth. For the companies in this arena, one key question they\nneed to constantly answer is, \"Where are the ideas for the\nnext leading mobile services coming from?\"\nInnovative ideas can come from both inside and outside a\ncompany. Companies that utilize external actors and sources\nin their idea generation processes tend to be more innovative\n(Laursen & Salter, 2006). Research into the relationship\nbetween customer and product innovation maintains that\nexisting customers are often considered a valuable source of\ncreativity and innovation (von Hippel, 1986). The \"voice of\ncustomer\" needs to be heard (Laursen & Salter, 2006).\nListening to the voices of customers and observing their\nbehaviors may provide valuable data on unsatisfied needs\nand point to creative solutions to existing problems. However,\nfor high-technology industries such as mobile technology, it\nhas been argued that ordinary customers are not a good\nsource for new ideas because \"real-world experience of ordi-\nnary users is often rendered obsolete by the time a product is\ndeveloped or during the time of its projected commercial\nlead users--those users who face needs that will be general\n1Free University of Bozen\u00adBolzano, Italy\n2Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nXiaofeng Wang, Faculty of Computer Science, Free University of Bozen\u00ad\nEmail: xiaofeng.wang@unibz.it\nIn Need of Creative Mobile Service Ideas?\nForget Adults and Ask Young Children\nIlona Kuzmickaja1, Xiaofeng Wang1, Daniel Graziotin1,\nGabriella Dodero1, and Pekka Abrahamsson2\n Keywords\nmobile services, smartphones, innovation, creativity, idea generation, idea evaluation, children, technology, psychology,\ninformation systems\n2 SAGE Open\nin a marketplace several months or years before ordinary\nusers do--is coined in the same study. Von Hippel (1986)\nargued that lead users are in a better position to provide accu-\nrate data on future needs; however, they suffer the same con-\nstraints of ordinary customers posed by their real-world\nexperience and available technology.\nChildren, however, are one group of people who suffer\nless from the above-mentioned constraints (Druin, 2002),\nand a never-ending source of imagination (Scaife & Rogers,\n1998). They are less constrained by existing technology\nframe due to their little life experience. Still, they somehow\nremain as a neglected group by market and innovation\nresearch, perhaps due to the traditional views of the all-\nknowing adults and the all-learning children (Druin, 2002).\nChildren are not considered a lead user group as defined by\nvon Hippel (1986), and they cannot even be considered as a\ncustomer group due to their lack of purchasing power.\nHowever, the studies conducted before the Internet age hint\nthat children, especially young children, are more creative\nthan people from other age groups. Children have been pro-\nposed to be part of the processes to design new technologies,\nin the roles of informants, design partners, or even leaders\nThe mobile phone industry might really benefit from this\nneglected source of creative ideas.\nResearch Question: Can young children be a valuable\nsource of creative mobile service ideas?\nThis is the research question that our study sets out to\nanswer. As far as the authors are aware of, there are no other\nstudies along this line of inquiry. The purpose of this study is\nto have a better understanding of the voices of young chil-\ndren in terms of creative mobile service ideas. To this end,\ntwo sets of mobile service ideas randomly sampled from a\nlarger survey conducted in 2006 were analyzed. One set con-\ntained 400 unique ideas expressed by a group of young chil-\ndistinctive ideas from a group of adults aged from 17 to 50\nyears. These ideas were analyzed using a conceptual frame-\nwork of creativity derived from the literature, in which cre-\nativity is conceptualized as a compound concept with two\ndimensions: novelty and quality. Both dimensions have two\nassociated constructs: originality and paradigm relatedness\nfor the novelty dimension, and relevance and workability for\nquality (Dean, Hender, Rodgers, & Santanen, 2006). We\ntested the difference between the two samples along the\nabove-mentioned dimensions and constructs. The findings of\nour study empirically demonstrate that young children are\nactually a valuable source to derive novel ideas that are also\nof high quality. In contrast, the adults'ideas are deemed to be\nless novel and of lower quality.\nThe remaining part of the article is organized as follows.\nThis section continues with laying out the background and\nrelated work. The concept of creativity is investigated in the\nConceptualization of Creative Ideas subsection. The research\napproach is described in the Materials and Method section.\nThen the Results section reports the obtained outcomes of\nthe study, which are further discussed in the light of relevant\nstudies in the Discussion section. The limitations of the study\nare reflected on in the same section. The last section con-\ncludes the article and outlines future work.\nMobile Services\nAccording to Alahuhta (2011), mobile services are \"radio\ncommunications services between mobile devices while in\nmotion or between such stations and fixed points of services\n(computer systems/servers)\" (p. 76). The architecture of\nmobile service systems can be decomposed into three com-\nponents: (a) wireless communication infrastructure, (b)\nmobile terminals, and (c) mobile (content) services and apps.\nThe majority of mobile services and apps rely on cellular\nnetworks. Although many apps function in offline mode,\nnowadays users have to be online to benefit from most\nmobile services.\nFor end users, the most concrete embodiment of mobile\nservices is the mobile device itself. Within a decade, a great\ndevelopment has occurred in mobile devices. This develop-\nment is mainly due to the miniaturization and an increasing\nlevel of integration of electronic devices. After the introduc-\ntion of physical full keyboards to business-oriented mobile\nphones, the product line has greatly developed in terms of the\nnumber of cellular bands, the quality of display, the amount\nof memory and storage, the variety of data access methods,\nthe capabilities of running mobile applications, and the num-\nber of features. Desoli and Filippi (2006) presented the evo-\nlution of mobile terminals and stated that new upcoming\nmodular devices could satisfy increasing user demand. The\nsize and weight of mobile devices have decreased steadily\nuntil the introduction of touch-based smartphones where,\ndue to the new interaction method and improved user experi-\nence, the displays have become larger than earlier. The first\niPhone sale on June 29, 2007, is a watershed of mobile termi-\nnals and the boom of the smartphone era. Additional File 1\n(in the online appendix) is a portrait of the technological evo-\nlution of mobile terminals using typical phones of the year as\nexamples.\nMobile content services and apps can be classified in dif-\nferent ways. Alahuhta, Abrahamsson, and Nummiaho (2008)\nsuggested a list of categories from an end-user perspective,\nincluding information pull and push, service request, locat-\ning persons, objects, identification, and so forth. The full list\nof categories and descriptions can be seen in Table 1.\nUntil 2009, the distribution of mobile content services\nand apps used to be controlled either by device manufactur-\ners or traditional telecom operators. In July 2008, Apple\nlaunched the App Store to promote mobile applications for\nthe iPhone and iPod mobile handsets. Similarly, Google\nlaunched its own store for applications running the Android\nKuzmickaja et al. 3\noperating system in October 2008. These are the two most\npopular and well-known application stores. The application\nstores attempt to integrate applications closely with devices,\nso that application downloading is simple and easy and the\nuser experience is optimized (Alahuhta, 2011).\nSource of Creative Ideas\nThe mobile service domain is highly dynamic and innova-\ntion plays a crucial role (Siau & Shen, 2003). Obtaining\ncreative ideas is the first step toward innovation. McLean\n(2005) stated that \"without creative ideas [. . .] innovation\nis an engine without any fuel,\" and further elaborated that\n\"no innovation is possible without the creative processes\nthat mark the front end of the process: identifying impor-\ntant problems and opportunities, gathering information,\ngenerating new ideas, and exploring the validity of those\nWhere do creative ideas come from? Ideas for new prod-\nucts or processes can come from both inside and outside a\ncompany. Laursen and Salter (2006) claimed that companies\nwho use external actors and sources in their idea generation\nprocesses tend to be more innovative. Customer needs and\nconsumer trends are often a valuable source of innovation.\nIdeas provided by end users can play a major role in the\ndevelopment of new services. For example, one case study of\nbanking services showed that the customers of the bank pro-\nposed around 40 new functionalities. In comparison, only\nseven novel functionalities were proposed by the bank itself\n(Oliveira & von Hippel, 2011). Therefore, the \"voice of cus-\ntomer\" needs to be heard (Laursen & Salter, 2006).\nHowever, for novel products characterized by rapid\nchange such as mobile services, the insights of existing cus-\ntomers and users into new product, process, or service needs\nand potential solutions are \"constrained by their own real-\nworld experience\" (von Hippel, 1986). As a consequence,\ncustomers \"steeped in the present\" are \"unlikely to generate\nnovel product concepts which conflict with the familiar\"\n(p. 791), as the familiarity with the attributes and uses of\nexisting products affect an individual's ability to conceive\nnovel attributes and uses. It also affects the ability to conceive\nnew product needs, especially in high-technology industries\nusers of a product whose needs will become general in a mar-\nketplace months or years in the future, and who do have real-\nlife experience with the novel product or process concepts of\ninterest. They are in a better position than \"ordinary\" users to\nprovide new product concept and design data.\nHowever, von Hippel (1986) admitted that the insights of\nlead users could be as constrained to the familiarity as those\nof other users. Therefore, a natural question to ask is, who\nare the group of people that are least constrained by their\nown real-world experience and familiarity with existing\ntechnologies? This points our attention to children.\nCreativity of children. Several studies investigating creativity\nbased on a person's age have agreed that children are more\ncreative than adults, because they explore the world with\n\"fresh eyes.\" Instead, rather than producing ideas based on\nreceived new information, adults are eliminating information\nevaluated an individual's creativity over the time. A three-\nstep research has been conducted: (a) in 1968, a total of\nwere evaluated as creative; (b) in 1973, those children were\ntested again as they were 10 years old, 30% being creative;\n(c) in 1978, a final test was conducted on the same group of\nchildren when they were teenagers (15 years old), and only\n12% of them were considered creative. However, the same\nconsidered creative. Therefore, the younger a person is, the\nhigher the tendency of being creative.\nHowever, how \"fresh eyed\" are today's children in terms\nof information technologies? Today's children have been\ncharacterized as being digital natives, as opposed to their\nparents and instructors, who are better considered as digital\nimmigrants (Prensky, 2001). Recent studies have reported\nhow high is the amount of digital-based experience that chil-\ndren have been exposed to. It has been shown that there is an\nincreasing use of computers, Internet, videogames, and\nmobile devices by children (Subrahmanyam, Greenfield,\nKraut, & Gross, 2001). In particular, it has been shown that\nhalf of the children in 10 U.K. primary schools were already\nmobile phone owners before 2004 (Davie, Panting, &\nCharlton, 2004). When smartphone is concerned, a recent\nresearch project found that 40% of European boys and 37%\nof European girls aged 9 to 12 have a smartphone for private\nWould the familiarity with information technologies pre-\nvent children from being creative, as it puts constraints on\nTable 1.

Not necessarily. For example, Jackson et al. (2012)\ninvestigated children's creativity and information technol-\nogy use, and revealed that a certain correlation existing\nbetween videogame playing and children creativity. Children\nhave also been proposed to be part of the processes to design\nnew technologies, in the roles of informants and design part-\nwork looked into the potential of children leading the process\nof design from initial problem formulation to design review\nand elaboration (Yip et al., 2013). The possibility and effec-\ntiveness of children being expert evaluators using heuristic\nevaluation method has also been explored (Salian, Sim, &\ninvolvement of children as active participants and evaluators\nhas been that there is a considerable distance between chil-\ndren and any (adult) expert \"guessers,\" and children act in\nways that could not have been predicted by an expert.\nIn brief, even though there is a seeming tension between\nchildren having \"fresh eyes\" (less constrained by existing\ntechnologies) and their being digital natives, evidences in the\nliterature show that the two may not be in conflict but could\nboth boost the creativity of children in the domain of infor-\nmation technologies. Based on the reviewed literature, we\nwould expect that, when mobile services are concerned, the\nideas coming from young children should be more creative\nthan those generated by adults; therefore, young children can\nbe a valuable source of innovation. In this article, we focus\non the creativity of young children aged from 7 to 12 years.\nAccording to Piaget (1953), this is a homogeneous group in\nterms of their intellectual development. Young children in\nthis age group are able to think abstractly and make rational\njudgments about concrete, observable phenomena.\nConceptualization of Creative Ideas\nCreativity is a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary concept that\nis difficult to measure (Piffer, 2012). Over hundred defini-\ntions exist for creativity, spanning several disciplines\na component of creativity is imaginative thinking, that is, the\nability to see things in novel ways, to recognize patterns, and\nmake connections. Nijstad and Paulus (2003) described cre-\nativity as \"the development of original ideas that are useful\nor influential.\" Rhodes (1961) suggested that creativity could\nbe an attribute of a process, a product, a person or environ-\nmental press, so-called four P's model of creativity.\nHowever, Dean et al. (2006) argued that, to define idea\ncreativity, it was helpful to differentiate it from the concept\nof creativity itself. Drawing on MacCrimmon and Wagner\n(1994), they defined \"a creative idea as a quality idea that is\nalso novel. That is, it applies to the problem, is an effective\nand implementable solution, and is also novel\" (p. 649).\nBased on a literature review of 51 studies on quality, novel,\nand creative ideas, they summarized a conceptual framework\nof idea creativity as illustrated in Table 2.\nNovelty is considered to be the main dimension of creativ-\nity (Dean et al., 2006). A novel idea is rare, unusual, or\nuncommon (Connolly, Dalgleish, Kalverboer, Hopkins, &\nGeuze, 1993). According to this definition, the most novel\nidea is an idea that is totally unique; conversely, the least\nnovel idea is the most common one (MacCrimmon &\ning the framework, the novelty of any idea must be judged in\nrelation to how uncommon it is in the mind of the idea evalu-\nator or how uncommon it is in the overall population of\nideas. Novelty can be broken down into two constructs: orig-\ninality and paradigm relatedness. Ideas are considered origi-\nnal when they are rare but also have the characteristic of\nbeing ingenious, imaginative, or surprising. Idea originality\nranges from those that are common and mundane to those\nthat are rare and imaginative. Paradigm relatedness describes\nthe transformation potential of ideas. It is the degree to which\nan idea relates to the currently prevailing paradigm, and it is\nclosely related to the concepts of transformational and\ngerminal.\nBased on this understanding, we can formulate the fol-\nlowing hypotheses regarding the novelty dimension of idea\ncreativity:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Mobile service ideas expressed by\nyoung children are more novel than those by adults.\nHypothesis 1a (H1a): Mobile service ideas expressed by\nyoung children are more original than those by adults.\nHypothesis 1b (H1b): Mobile service ideas expressed by\nyoung children are more transformational in terms of\nexisting paradigm than those by adults.\nThe second dimension of idea creativity is quality, which\nis further divided into workability and relevance. An idea is\nworkable (or feasible) if it can be easily implemented and\ndoes not violate known constraints. An idea is relevant if it\napplies to the stated problem and will be effective at solving\nthe problem. There is a third construct suggested by Dean\net al. (2006), namely, specificity. An idea is specific if it is\nclear and worked out in detail. We excluded the specificity\nconstruct in this study, as Dean et al. (2006) recommended\nthat specificity was optional and should be measured only\nwhen it is a main focus of a study.\nConsequently, we formulate the following hypotheses\nregarding the quality dimension of idea creativity:\nTable 2. Conceptualization of Idea Creativity.\nDimensions Constructs\nNovelty Originality\nParadigm relatedness\nQuality Workability\nRelevance\nSource. Adapted from Dean, Hender, Rodgers, and Santanen (2006).\nKuzmickaja et al. 5\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Mobile service ideas expressed by\nyoung children are of higher quality than those by adults.\nHypothesis 2a (H2a): Mobile service ideas expressed by\nyoung children are implemented more frequently than\nthose by adults.\nHypothesis 2b (H2b): Mobile service ideas expressed by\nyoung children are more relevant than those by adults.\nMaterials and Method\nSample\nThe research design has relied on a historical data set. In\n2006, a group of researchers from theVTTTechnical Research\nCentre of Finland launched a national research project called\nthe Idea Movement (Leikas, 2007). They systematically col-\nlected innovative ideas of mobile services from the Finnish\ncitizens through 31 workshops organized in the country in\nthat year. The locations of the workshops included universi-\nties, schools, workplaces, and even a shopping center.\nThe workshops were run in a consistent format, but the\ntargeting participants were grouped by their ages. Therefore,\nthe workshops were run separately for children and adults.\nEach workshop was kicked off with a short introduction to\nscientific process and idea generation techniques, which was\nthen followed by brainstorming sessions both individually\nand in groups. Each participant was asked to produce 20\nideas individually and then to form groups of three to four\npeople per group. Each group was targeting at generating\n100 ideas or more. The researchers acted as the facilitators of\nthe workshops and encouraged the participants not to think\nabout the technology, but to express their concrete needs, and\nto produce ideas even if they would feel them either \"silly\"\nor not realistic in their minds. The ideas were produced in a\nwritten format. For this reason, the writing ability of young\nchildren did most likely have impact on the extent of how the\nideas were expressed. Regardless, young children wrote\ndown their ideas independently without the assistance from\nthe adults present at the workshops.\nThe ideas were generally one to two sentences in length,\ndescribing a mobile service idea, or expressing a need that\none thinks could be fulfilled utilizing mobile technology.\nTwo examples of the ideas are as follows:\nThe camera of the phone would have a recognition feature\nwhich would recognize persons in photos. (Child idea)\nA composing service which lets one to inspect song patterns that\nare based on different mathematical forms. (Adult idea)\npants, the majority of whom were university students, school\nchildren, and elderly people. Among the total ideas, 1,800\nTo decide the meaningful sample sizes for comparing the\nideas of young children and adults, we consulted several\nstudies in statistics and organizational research. We set a\nvalue of .05 as margin error, as suggested in the guidelines by\nBartlett, Kotrlik, and Higgins (2001) and Krejcie and Morgan\n(1969). We adopted the most conservative value for variance\nestimation of .50, that is, the one usually found for dichoto-\nmous variables and will also produce the maximum sample\nsize (Bartlett et al., 2001). Subsequently by using the Cochran\n(1977) formula for sample size estimation, we calculated that\nfor a 0.95 confidence level, we needed at least sample size of\nN = 384. However, the application of a simplified formula\nfrom Yamane (1967), which took into account the population\nsize as well, gave us the sample size value N = 395, that is,\nscope. As a result, we opted to randomly select 400 distinct\nideas from the idea set of young children (7-12 years old) and\ntwo samples can be freely accessed online.1\nIdea Creativity Assessment\nTwo independent raters evaluated the creativity of each idea\nin each sample by using the framework described in the pre-\nvious section (as shown in Table 2). Both judges were adult\nmobile service users and had years of experience with mobile\ndevices. One of the judges had 6 year experience in mobile\nservice development and was an early adopter of mobile\ndevices. The other rater was a researcher on open innovation\nand creativity in information systems. Before the rating, the\njudges were trained on the definition and understanding of\nthe idea creativity concept and measurement scales. The\njudges were blind to the sources of the ideas, which were\nungrouped and randomized.\nNovelty assessment. The two constructs of novelty, original-\nity and paradigm relatedness, were measured with a Likert-\ntype scale from 1 to 5. A score of 1 was assigned to least\noriginal or least influential. A score of 5 represented the other\nextremes. The detailed scale descriptions can be seen in\nTable 3. Following the recommendation of Dean et al.\n(2006), the novelty score was calculated as the sum of origi-\nnality and paradigm relatedness, thus ranging in the interval\nAll ideas were generated and collected in 2006. Therefore,\nthe novelty assessment was challenging for the present study.\nTo address this issue, we selected two best-selling mobile\nAdditional File 1 for its main characteristics) and Nokia\nof each phone to have a clear presentation of what mobile\nfunctionalities and services were available at that time.\nAlthough Nokia had published smartphones already in 2005\nat the time when the data were collected.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 4. The Novelty of Young Children's and Adults' Ideas.\nYoung children's ideas Adults' ideas\n Originality\nParadigm\nrelatedness Novelty Originality\nParadigm\nrelatedness Novelty\nQuality assessment. Quality was composed of two constructs:\nworkability and relevance. In terms of workability, the used\ndata set granted a unique opportunity to go beyond a simple\nspeculation. We could investigate if these ideas were actually\nimplemented after they have been generated in 2006. Any\nidea that has been developed, produced, and marketed in at\nleast some part of the world was considered implemented,\ntherefore workable. However, ideas that had not been turned\ninto mobile services or apps at all or that were in develop-\nment but had not been marketed were considered not imple-\nmented, therefore not workable. Evaluated in this way, 1/0\ndichotomous scores were used. To see whether an idea has\nbeen implemented or not, information on software, hard-\nware, or service that would match the idea was searched\nthrough various online channels. The complete procedure of\nthe workability assessment that we used is available in Addi-\ntional File 2 (in the online appendix).\nRelevance was also assessed using the dichotomous\nscores, to enable the aggregation to the higher quality dimen-\nsion. A score of 1 meant that an idea was a relevant mobile\nidea, 0 otherwise. To determine if an idea was a relevant\nmobile service idea, we used the category list of mobile ser-\nvices (as shown in Table 1). If an idea could be put into the\nlisted categories, it was considered a relevant idea. Otherwise,\nthe idea was considered not relevant. It is worth noting that\nthe ideas that indicate new but un-named types of mobile\nservice were considered relevant and classified under the cat-\negory \"Other mobile service ideas.\"\nThe quality score was calculated as the sum of relevance\nand workability, within the [0, 2] score range. It is worth\nmentioning that, due to the different scales used to measure\nnovelty and quality, we could not aggregate the novelty and\nquality dimensions as a single creativity score in this study.\nThis is a trade-off we decided to make to benefit from the\nhistorical nature of the data that allowed us to investigate the\nactual implementation of these mobile ideas.\nResults\nThis section provides the analysis outcomes of the two ran-\ndom samples of 400 ideas generated by young children and\n400 ideas by adults. It is organized in two subsections, Idea\nNovelty and Idea Quality. Each subsection contains the\ndescriptive statistics and the hypothesis testing of each cre-\nativity dimension.\nIdea Novelty\nAdditional File 3 (in the online appendix) contains a list of\nthree most novel ideas from the children and adults samples,\nas well as three least novel ideas from the two samples.\nDescriptive statistics. Table 4 summarizes the measures of the\nnovelty dimension and its two constructs, originality and\nparadigm relatedness.\nRecalling that the score range of the two constructs is [1, 5],\nwith respect to both originality and paradigm relatedness, the\nyoung children sample presented higher values for the mean\nand the average rating of the ideas. In addition, the mean and\nthe median of the adults sample were less than 3, which is the\nTable 3.

It appeared that the young\nchildren on average were able to provide sufficiently original\nand related ideas, whereas the adults could not.\nIn Figures 1 and 2, the boxplots of originality and para-\ndigm relatedness show strong differences between the two\nsamples. Regarding originality (see Figure 1), the distribu-\ntion of the averaged scores of the young children's ideas is\nnoticeably greater than that of the adults' ideas. The first\nquartile of the children's sample--that is, 3--is greater than\nthe third quartile of the adults' sample--that is, 2.5. In addi-\ntion, the children's median value corresponds to the third\nquartile value of 3.5 and is greater than the adults' median\nvalue, by 1.5 units. It should be noted that the values of the\noutliers in Figures 1 and 2 fall outside 1.5 times the inter-\nquartile range and are therefore meaningless in our context.\nHowever, it is interesting to notice that 45 ideas from the\nchildren sample were rated higher than 4 on average whereas\nonly 2 ideas from the adults sample were rated higher than 4\non average.\nFor the paradigm relatedness construct in Figure 2, the\ndistribution of the averaged scores of the children's ideas\nappears to be greater than that of the adults' ideas. The first\nquartile of the children sample and the third quartile of the\nadults sample have the same value of 3.5. The median of\nthe children's ideas is greater than that of the adults' ideas\nby 1 unit.\nRecalling the score range [2, 10] for the novelty dimen-\nsion, we see in Table 4 that the children's sample outper-\nforms the adults'one.

A series of Shapiro\u00adWilk tests on the sam-\nples showed strong evidence for non-normality (p value <\n.0001, for the two groups, for all the three hypotheses' test-\ning). Therefore, the hypotheses were tested with a series of\none-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Table 5 summarizes\nthe tests.\nAt a .0001 significance level, there was support for H1a\nand H1b, which state that the mobile service ideas expressed\nby young children are more original and paradigm changing\nthan those by adults. Finally, at the same significance level,\nFigure 1. Boxplots for idea originality.\n8 SAGE Open\nthe results also show the evidence for a higher novelty level\nfor the children's ideas with respect to the adults' ideas (H1).\nIdea Quality\nDescriptive statistics. Table 6 summarizes the measures of the\nquality dimension and its two constructs, relevance and\nworkability.\nRecalling that the constructs relevance and workability\nare binary in the interval [0, 1], the two samples provide sim-\nilar values for the relevance. The mean value was 0.98 for the\nchildren's sample and 0.96 for the adults' one, whereas the\nmedian was 1 for both. Regarding workability, a larger dif-\nference between the children's sample and the adults' one\nwas observed. Although the median was the same for both\ngroups--that is, 1.00--the children's sample had an average\nvalue for workability higher by 0.12 units, whereas the dif-\nference in the standard deviations was 0.07. It appeared that\nthe children's ideas on average are more often implemented\nthan the adults' ideas. However, no difference in the rele-\nvance of the two groups was noticeable.\n(96%) were considered relevant from the adults' sample.\nThus, the children provided a slightly higher number of rel-\nevant ideas, with an increment of 2%.\n(81%) have been developed in the past years. However, from\nThus, the children sample presented 12% more workable\nideas.\nHypotheses testing.Both relevance and workability con-\nstructs followed binomial distribution, because their values\nrepresent the number of successes in a sample. Therefore, we\ntested the one-tailed hypotheses (H2, H2a, H2b) with a chi-\nsquared test for proportions of two independent samples. The\nproportions to be tested were the ones mentioned in the pre-\nvious sub-section. The hypotheses tests are summarized in\nWith a p value less than .0001, we found significant evi-\ndence for the hypothesis that the children's ideas are more\nworkable than the adults'ideas (H2a). With a p value smaller\nthan .05, we found significant support for the hypothesis that\nthe children's ideas are more relevant than the adults' ideas\n(H2b). Finally, with a p value smaller than .0001, we found\nFigure 2. Boxplots for idea paradigm relatedness.\nKuzmickaja et al. 9\nsignificant evidence to support the hypothesis that the chil-\ndren's mobile service ideas have higher quality than the\nadults' ones (H2).\nDiscussion\nWe hypothesized that the mobile service ideas expressed\nby young children aged 7 to 12 years are more novel (H1)\nand of higher quality (H2) than those by the adults aged 17\nto 50. The results of our study support the two higher level\nhypotheses. The general perception suggested by the liter-\nature was that the ideas from children are wilder and less\nrealistic and therefore less relevant and workable than\nthose of adults. However, our findings empirically\ndemonstrate that this may not be the case for the mobile\nservices domain.\nIn terms of the two constructs of idea novelty, namely,\noriginality and paradigm relatedness, our study supports the\ntwo hypotheses H1a and H1b, and provided significant evi-\ndence that children's ideas are more original and transforma-\ntional in terms of existing paradigm than those by adults.\nTherefore, our study supports the creativity literature that\nclaims that children are more creative than adults (Land &\ncerned. It also provides further evidence that, although\ntoday's young children are increasingly familiar with and\nconfident in using information technologies, unlike adults,\nthey could still keep their \"fresh eyes\" and open minds when\nimagining future digital products and services. The reason\nbehind this could be that young children aged 7 to 12 years\nare in the intellectual development phase, and their minds are\nstill forming and naturally more open than those of adults\n(Vint, 2005). However, as it is demonstrated, the \"window of\nopportunity\" closes very quickly and they lose their creativ-\nity dramatically when they grow up. We should either utilize\nthis source of creativity in time or we need to reflect on and\nreact accordingly to enable children to preserve or adults to\n\"re-learn\" creativity.\nFigure 3. Boxplots for idea novelty.\nTable 5. Hypotheses Testing for the Novelty of Children's and\nAdults' Ideas.\nResearch\nHypothesis\nM\ndifference\nMedian\ndifference W value p value\nRegarding the two constructs of idea quality, our results\nsupport H2a and found significant evidence that the mobile\nservice ideas expressed by children are implemented more\nfrequently, that is, they are more workable. In the study of\nideas could be implemented. Our study found instead that the\npercentage of implemented adults' ideas was 69%, which is\n26% lower than predicted. We also found significant support\nfor H2b, which shows that children's ideas are more relevant\nthan those of adults. The results regarding workability and\nrelevance are surprising in the sense that the intuitive expec-\ntation would be on the contrary. One would think that the\nideas from children are less relevant and workable or at least\nthere should not be significant difference between the two\nage groups.\nAs part of the relevance analysis, this study classified the\nchildren's ideas using the list of categories from Alahuhta\net al., (2008; as shown in Table 1), and calculated the per-\ncentages of each category (see Additional File 4 in the online\nappendix). We compared the percentages of our analysis of\nthe children's ideas with that of the adults' ideas presented in\nAlahuhta et al. (2008). We found that the category with the\nlargest percentage in the children's sample was \"Other\nmobile service ideas\" (45.5%), which indicates that the ideas\nfrom children are more difficult to be classified under exist-\ning categories, and therefore, more \"out of the box.\" In com-\nparison, the ideas from adults categorized under this category\nare 24% of the total adults' ideas analyzed in Alahuhta et al.\nLimitations of the Study\nSeveral limitations, most of which are related to the samples,\nmay threaten the validity of our study. First, there was no\ndetailed demographic data available for the original ideas\ncollected in 2006. We could not know about the children and\nadults behind these ideas more than their ages and that they\nare from Finland. This is a threat to generalize our findings to\nchildren and adults of other nations. However, Finland is an\nadvanced country in terms of mobile technologies; therefore,\nit can be argued that its population is a good representative of\ncurrent and potential mobile users. In addition, we could not\nknow exactly how many ideas were generated by the same\npersons. However, as the focus of our study is idea creativity\nrather than person creativity, the unit analysis is idea, not the\nperson. Therefore, the lack of the demographic data does not\npresent a serious threat, even though the availability of this\ndata would help a better understanding of the generalizabil-\nity of the results to a larger population.\nAnother limitation is that in this study we did not\ninclude another age group of children from 13 to 16 years\nold, which is considered a teenager group. Although their\nideas are also interesting to explore and a comparison\ncould be made between them and the other two age groups,\nthe group was excluded from the investigation. The litera-\nture review precisely indicated young children (7-12 years\nold) as a very creative group yet the most neglected one,\nmostly due to their lack of purchasing power and the tradi-\ntional beliefs that relegate adults as \"all-knowing\" and\nyoung children as \"all-learning\" (Druin, 2002). Meanwhile,\nthe creativity of children has been shown to dramatically\ndecrease when they become teenagers (Land & Jarman,\nin studying the extremely young children as a source of\ncreative mobile service ideas. For the same reason, we did\nnot further divide the adult group into more fine-grained\ngroups. Future studies can build on top of our findings,\nincluding the teenager group or focusing on the compari-\nson of children's ideas with those from a sub-group of\nTable 6.

Hypotheses Testing for the Quality of Children's and Adults' Ideas.\nResearch\nSample estimates\np value\nChildren Adults\nNote. CI = confidence interval.\nKuzmickaja et al. 11\nFinally, due to the research design choice, we could not\naggregate novelty and quality scores to a final creativity\nscore for the evaluated ideas. Therefore, our claim that the\nmobile service ideas expressed by young children (7-12\nyears old) are more creative than those of adults might be\nlimited. However, the construct of creativity is expressed in\nour adopted four sub-hypotheses and measures, which all\nwere empirically proved to be significantly in favor of young\nchildren.\nConclusion\nInnovation is a key success factor in any high-technology\nsector, including the mobile service domain. Creative ideas\nare the first step of innovative products and services. Existing\ncustomers, especially lead users, are considered the main\nsources of creative ideas. However, their creativity is con-\nstrained by the available technologies and their life experi-\nences. One potential source of creative ideas, which is\nsomehow overlooked, is young children. This led us to study\nyoung children (aged 7-12) as another potential source for\ncreative mobile service ideas. Year 2007 saw the introduc-\ntion of smartphones, the most significant change to the\nmobile service domain. A collection of more than 41,000\nmobile ideas collected in 2006 granted us a unique opportu-\nnity to study the potential of children as the source of cre-\native mobile service ideas. To understand if the mobile\nservice ideas expressed by young children are more creative\nthan those by adults, we randomly selected two samples\nfrom the idea database of a Finnish research project. One\nsample was a collection of ideas from young children aged 7\nthem using a creativity framework distilled from the litera-\nture. The results showed that the mobile service ideas from\nyoung children are more novel and have higher quality than\nthose from adults.\nThe article offers several interesting findings that would\nbe useful for creativity research as well as mobile service\u00ad\nproviding companies and designers. The theoretical contri-\nbution of our study lies in the six hypotheses, which our\nstudy supported significantly. They add to the body of\nknowledge of creativity study, especially regarding the idea\ncreativity of younger age group, that is, the \"digital natives.\"\nThe practical implication of our study is that it indicates a\nnew and valuable source for the companies that seek creative\nideas for innovative products and services. Even though the\ncost of collecting ideas from young children is yet to be bet-\nter understood, we expect that it should not be more costly\nthan from the adults as the ideas in our samples were col-\nlected in the same manner.\nSeveral future studies can be derived from our study. As\nin this study the analysis was at the idea level, future stud-\nies can analyze the creativity at the person level in terms of\nmobile service ideas. Future studies can bring in more\nangles as well, such as the time of implementation, when\nan idea was implemented after it was uttered, and the pop-\nularity of an implemented service, indicated by its down-\nload rate.\nAuthors' Note\nIlona Kuzmickaja, Xiaofeng Wang, and Daniel Graziotin all con-\ntributed equally to the study.
