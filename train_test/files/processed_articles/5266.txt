It is estimated that 2\nbillion people worldwide have been infected with\nHBV, and 240 million people are chronically\ninfected with HBV. People who are chronically\ninfected with HBV are at an increased risk of devel-\noping hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation,\nand hepatocellular carcinoma [Sarin et al. 2016].\nThe prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\n(NAFLD) has increased recently. NAFLD is a dis-\nease that comprises a wide spectrum of liver dam-\nage, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis,\nfibrosis and cirrhosis. NAFLD is now the most\ncommon liver disorder in Western countries,\nNAFLD have an increased mortality from both\nliver-related and non-liver-related disease when\ncompared with the general population [Levene\nand Goldin, 2012]. There are patients who have\nconcurrent chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infec-\ntion and NAFLD, which can cause a clinical\ndilemma regarding different clinical management\nfor these two conditions. Therefore, the early diag-\nnosis and appropriate management of hepatic stea-\ntosis in patients with CHB is important. However,\nat present, studies on the clinical characteristics\nA noninvasive diagnostic model to assess\nnonalcoholic hepatic steatosis in patients\nwith chronic hepatitis B\nHongjie Ou*, Shaohang Cai*, Ying Liu, Muye Xia and Jie Peng\n Keywords: blood pressure, chronic hepatitis B, controlled attenuation parameter, hepatic\nsteatosis, hepatitis B virus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\nCorrespondence to:\nJie Peng, MD\nState Key Laboratory of\nOrgan Failure Research,\nGuangdong Provincial\nKey Laboratory of Viral\nHepatitis Research,\nDepartment of Infectious\nDiseases and Hepatology\nUnit, Nanfang Hospital,\nSouthern Medical\nGuangzhou Avenue North,\nHongjie Ou, MD\nDepartment of infectious\ndiseases, First Affiliated\nHospital of Xiamen\nUniversity, Fujian\nProvince, China\nShaohang Cai, MD\nDepartment of Pathology,\nSun Yat-sen University\nCancer Center,\nGuangzhou, China\nSun Yat-sen University\nCancer Center, State Key\nLaboratory of Oncology in\nSouth China, Collaborative\nInnovation Center\nfor Cancer Medicine,\nGuangzhou, China\nYing Liu, MD\nThe First people's hospital\nof Shunde, Guangdong\nProvince, China\nMuye Xia, MD\nJie Peng, MD\nDepartment of Infectious\nDiseases and Hepatology\nUnit, Nanfang Hospital,\nSouthern Medical\nUniversity, Guangdong\nProvince, China\n*These authors\ncontributed equally to this\nwork.\nOriginal Research\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(2)\nand diagnosis of NAFLD in patients with CHB\nremain uncommon.\nLiver biopsy is still regarded as the `gold stand-\nard' for assessing hepatic steatosis. However, the\ninvasive nature of the process of liver biopsy\nbrings about a risk of complications in 0.5% of\ncases, and mortality of about 0.05% [Lok and\ntant to develop methods for quantifying hepatic\nsteatosis in a noninvasive way.\nLiver ultrasound (US) is the most commonly used\nnoninvasive imaging diagnostic tool to assess\nhepatic steatosis. A recent study has demonstrated\nthat hepatic ultrasound has a high sensitivity and\nspecificity for evaluating hepatic steatosis when\nhepatic fat content is >20% [Dasarathy et al.\n2009]. For those patients with liver steatosis\n<20%, hepatic ultrasound may not be effective\nfor clinical use. The controlled attenuation param-\neter (CAP) measured by transient elastography\nwas recently introduced as a promising noninva-\nsive quantitative test for measuring hepatic steato-\n2012]. CAP can be used to assess hepatic steatosis\nwhen hepatic fat content is at least 5% [Masaki\net al. 2013]. Recent studies have confirmed that\nCAP is well correlated with the grade of hepatic\nsteatosis when confirmed by histological grading,\nas well as hepatic steatosis assessed by hepatic\nultrasound [de Ledinghen et al. 2014; Sasso et al.\n2010]. However, due to the practical difficulty of\nperforming the transient elastography assessment,\nand the lack of skilled operators, CAP measured\nby transient elastography has not been widely\nimplemented clinically. A simple, economical,\nand effective diagnostic model would be valued,\nespecially in low-income countries.\nTherefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a\nnoninvasive diagnostic test for nonalcoholic hepatic\nsteatosis in patients with CHB by using routinely\navailable clinical markers. Demographic and clini-\ncal parameters were compared in patients with\nCHB (control group) and in patients with concom-\nitant CHB and hepatic steatosis (steatosis group).\nMethods\nPatients studied and clinical parameters\nstudy of data from 1312 patients with CHB from\nthe First Affiliated Hospital, Xiamen University,\nwere included and analyzed. The Institutional\nReview Board of First Affiliated Hospital, Xiamen\nUniversity approved the study. Each enrolled\npatient provided informed consent.\nThe clinical data obtained were allocated to two\nphases, in sequential chronological order (Figure\n1). CHB was defined as the presence of seroposi-\ntivity for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) for more\nthan 6 months with persistent or repetitive ala-\nnine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation [Sarin\nThe 1312 patients included in the study were\ndiagnosed with chronic active HBV infection\nand with documented persistent or repetitive\nmean serum HBV DNA viral load was 7.19 \u00b1\nIU/ml.

Hypertension was defined, according\nthe 2013 European Society of Hypertension/\nEuropean Society of Cardiology guidelines for the\nmanagement of arterial hypertension, as an office\nsitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140\nmmHg and/or office diastolic blood pressure\n(DBP)  90 mmHg, measured by a mercury\nAccording to current guidelines, for the diagnosis\nof hypertension, patients were divided into the\nH Ou, S Cai et al.\nfollowing four groups.

Ultrasonic attenua-\ntion was measured at 3.5 MHz using signals\nassessed by transient elastography. The median\nCAP value was expressed in units of the decibel\nper meter (dB/m). A CAP value was considered\nreliable with both interrogative range/median\nAt the time of transient elastography, patient\ninformation on lifestyle, including alcohol con-\nsumption and smoking, was collected and ana-\nlyzed. Laboratory tests, including levels of serum\nlipids, and blood uric acid were assessed, accord-\ning to standard procedures and the results per-\nformed within 14 days of transient elastography,\nby automated techniques, were also collected.\nHBV serological markers were determined using\na commercially available radioimmunoassay\n(ARCHITECT i2000SR, Abbott Laboratories).\nSerum HBV DNA levels were measured using\nreal-time polymerase chain reaction quantifica-\ntion. Blood pressure was measured twice at rest in\na sitting position, spaced 2\u00ad5 min apart, and the\nmean of two values was used in the analysis.

The average\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study show that the FL test, a\nnoninvasive diagnostic model, based on the CAP\nmeasured by transient elastography, could pre-\ndict hepatic steatosis in patients with CHB. The\nFL could be developed as a diagnostic test of sim-\nple steatosis in CHB patients who refuse liver\nbiopsy or in whom liver biopsy is contraindicated.\nThe study findings support the argument that the\nFL test could be important for clinical practition-\ners in countries with limited medical resources\nand funding.\nThere are now many reports on the prevalence of\nthe coexistence of NAFLD with CHB. In a study\nin China, 891 CHB patients were compared to\n922 healthy people, and the prevalence of NAFLD\nin the control group [Wong et al. 2012]. Another\nstudy, reported by Bondini and colleagues\n[Bondini et al. 2007] showed that NAFLD was\nobserved in 19% of patients with CHB, with a\nFigure 2.

The cut-off value for the\nCAP measurement was set at 232.5 with a sen-\nsitivity value of 87.0% and a specificity value of\nNAFLD in this study was similar to that in the\ngeneral population as reported by the clinical\npractice guidelines for the management of\nunlike hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the\nCHB virus infection did not have a significant\nimpact on hepatic steatosis. For most CHB\npatients, the presence of NAFLD may be\ncaused by an unhealthy lifestyle. However,\nlarger studies are required to investigate this\nassociation further.\nCurrent guidelines recommend that the treat-\nment of patients with CHB should commence if\nthey have persistently elevated ALT levels, at\nmore than twice the upper limit of normal [Sarin\net al. 2016]. However, an abnormal ALT level is\noften observed in patients with hepatic steatosis;\nthe raised ALT level from HBV-infected patients\nFigure 3. ROC curve to validate FL test in diagnosis of NAFLD.

A marker such as serum\nHBV DNA level may not reflect antiviral response\n[Cai et al. 2014]. Similarly, inappropriate antivi-\nral treatment with HBV associated with non-\nalcohol steatohepatitis (NASH) brings the risk of\nHBV drug resistance and increases the economic\nburden of treatment, which may also influence\nthe treatment adherence of CHB patients [Peng\net al. 2015]. However, lack of antiviral treatment\nin patients with CHB because the physicians mis-\ntakenly believe that elevated ALT was due to\nNASH carries the risk of progressive liver fibrosis\nand risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore,\na noninvasive diagnostic model for hepatic steato-\nsis, such as the FL test would be of value as an\nassessment for patients infected with HBV, espe-\ncially before the antiviral treatment.\nFigure 5.

Another study,\nreported by Ates and colleagues [Ates et al. 2011],\nof 84 patients with CHB who received interferon\ntreatment, the sustained virological response\nshowed no difference between patients who had\nhepatic steatosis and those who did not, although\nthere was a trend towards a poorer response in the\nhepatic steatosis patients. In 2012, Shi and col-\nleagues [Shi et al. 2012] observed a similar result,\nand reported that there was no significant differ-\nence in HBeAg seroconversion and virological\nresponse rate in patients with or without NAFLD.\nStudies have reported that high baseline ALT lev-\nels result in improved clinical outcomes after anti-\nWhether CHB associated with NASH is also\nassociated with increased ALT levels at baseline,\nand is an indicator of better clinical outcome, is as\nyet unknown. Liver steatosis has been shown to\nbe associated with an unfavorable response to\ntreatment with interferon and ribavirin in patients\nwith HCV [Poynard et al. 2003]. For patients\nwith CHB, diet and lifestyle changes may be\nrecommended.\nNAFLD had been shown to be associated with\ninsulin resistance in the liver, muscle, and adipose\ntissues [Gaggini et al. 2013], and with metabolic\nsyndrome, [Alberti et al. 2005], which is sup-\nportedbythefindingsofthisstudy.Cardiovascular\ndisease is a common cause of death in patients\nwith NAFLD [Targher et al. 2010], which raised\nthe possibility that the FL test from our study\ncould be developed as a method for risk stratifica-\ntion for patients with CHB who may develop car-\ndiovascular disease.\nIt is important to mention that previous studies\nhave described the use of the FL index and the\nFL algorithm as predictors of hepatic steatosis,\nbased on liver ultrasound [Bedogni et al. 2006;\nLin et al. 2011]. When the cut-off value of the FL\nindex was set as 50, the sensitivity was 70%,\nLin et al. 2011]. However, these previous studies\nwere undertaken in the general population, and\npatients infected with HBV were excluded\nindex has not been investigated in patients with\nCHB. Liver ultrasound has a limited sensitivity\nand specificity for the evaluation of hepatic stea-\ntosis when hepatic fat content is >20% [Dasarathy\net al. 2009]. For those patients with hepatic stea-\ntosis <20%, liver ultrasound may not be effective,\nwhereas CAP can be used to assess hepatic stea-\ntosis when the hepatic fat content is 5% or more\nAlthough this preliminary study is one of the first\nto evaluate the FL test in patients with CHB, it\nhas limitations. The study was retrospective in a\nsingle center, performed by clinicians from the\nsame center. The small study size and the poten-\ntial for study bias could be overcome in future\nstudies with the use of multiple centers, possibly\nin several regions and countries. The FL test\ncould also be validated using patients who have\nalso had liver biopsies and a histological quantifi-\ncation of hepatic fat.\nIn conclusion, this study has demonstrated a\nnoninvasive test for hepatic steatosis in patients\nwith CHB infection. The findings of this study\nhave supported the potential use for CAP value\nin the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis, as a sensi-\ntive and specific noninvasive test. However, it is\nimportant to stress that the findings of this pre-\nliminary study should be taken further and sup-\nported by larger, controlled, multicenter studies\nin patients with NAFLD with and without CHB\nvirus infection.\nFigure 6.
