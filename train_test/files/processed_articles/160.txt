A possible reason for the limited\nimpact of the TCR was that multinational firms had the option to work around the regulation\nby using holding company structures.

Introduction\nThere is growing empirical evidence that multinational firms adapt their financial policies in\na tax-efficient way. Studies on the financial structure of U.S. outbound investment (Foley,\nDesai, and Hines 2004, Altshuler and Grubert 2003) as well as German outbound investment\n(Mintz and Weichenrieder 2005) suggest that an increase in the host country tax rate by 10\npercentage points on average increases the leverage of manufacturing firms by some 2\u00ad4\npercentage points. Countries with high tax rates therefore seem to attract a considerable\namount of tax-deductible interest cost. To a considerable extent the debt that multinationals\nshift into high-tax countries takes the form of cross-border intracompany loans. Germany,\nwhich during most of the 1990s had the highest corporate tax rate among OECD countries,\nis an obvious example. Ramb and Weichenrieder (2005) point out that at the end of the\n1990s this type of finance on average accounted for some 20 percent of the balance-sheet\ntotal of German manufacturing corporations that were held by a foreign direct investor.\nGovernments may react in several ways to curb tax-efficient financing schemes that\ncome at a tax revenue cost. One method taken by some home countries of multinationals\n(Japan, the U.S., and Italy) is to use interest allocation rules.1 Under an interest allocation\nrule, the interest deduction is allocated according to a pro rata share. That is, for tax\npurposes, there may apply a compulsory shift of interest deductions from the parent firm to\nthe foreign affiliates.\nIn this paper we will consider thin-capitalization rules that are applied by host\ncountries of multinational firms. A thin-capitalization rule (TCR) typically restricts the tax\ndeductibility of interest if the amount of loans granted by the investor or a closely related\nparty is deemed excessive. In France, for example, an interest payment by a foreign-owned\ncorporation to its investor may be qualified as a dividend, if the loans provided by this\ninvestor exceed 150% of her equity share. Similar TCRs with various ratios are used, for\nexample, in Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands.2 In recent years, thin-capitalization\nrules have attracted additional political attention because of their possible interference with\nEuropean law. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) disallowed application of a former\nGerman thin-capitalization rule to companies operating in Germany if the loan is given by\nan investor located in an EU member country. The ECJ held that the rule selectively\ndiscriminated against EU investors.\nSo far there have been few empirical studies on the economic effects of TCRs.3 A\nrecent exception is Buettner et al. (2007), who argue that German investment abroad tends to\nbe more tax-sensitive if the host country employs a TCR. Overesch and Wamser (2006)\nprovide some evidence that tightening of TCR rules reduces the fraction of intracompany\nloans in German FDI financing. The present paper is an effort to further improve our\nknowledge of the working of TCRs in practice. In this paper we will highlight the empirical\nreactions of foreign companies to the German TCR legislation. Besides the immediate\nquestion whether the introduction or tightening of the TCR has had the desired effects on the\namount of intracompany loans, a second question is how firms have accommodated. For\nexample, a multinational that faces restrictions in financing its German affiliate by\nintracompany loans could react by using more equity or more third-party debt, or it could\nreduce investment along with the amount of intracompany loans.\nYet another possibility is that multinationals succeed in working around legal\nrestrictions. Particular weak spots in the legislation may allow this. For example, the\nGerman TCR, which was introduced in 1994, featured a special preference for holding\ncompanies. It provided a safe-haven debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 for all nonbank corporations,\nbut provided a more lenient 9:1 safe haven for holding companies. That is, an interest\npayment from a German holding company to its foreign investor was safe from being\n3 For recent theoretical papers, which analyze thin-capitalization rules as measures of international tax\nqualified as a dividend as long as ratio of the investor's loans to his or her equity in the firm\nwas smaller than 900 percent. Under the German 1994 TCR rule this may have invited the\nuse of domestic holding corporations to work around the more stringent 3:1 rule.4 A main\npurpose of this paper is therefore not only to look at the financing reaction of foreign\naffiliates in Germany, but also to consider empirically, by drawing on information provided\nby the Deutsche Bundesbank database MiDi, the extent to which firms took advantage of\nthis loophole.\nThe reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we will give a\ndescription of the German TCR and describe its evolution over time. Section 3 introduces\nthe MiDi data that are used for the present analysis, and Section 4 then empirically examines\ncorporate reactions to the 2001 change in the German TCR. Section 5 investigates to what\nextent holding companies have been used as vehicles to work around the German TCR.\nSection 6 concludes.\n2. The Evolution of the German TCR\nIn Germany, an explicit TCR was legislated in 1993 and became effective in January 1994.\nBefore that date no explicit rules existed.5 The newly introduced \u00a7 8a of the corporate tax\ncode (KStG) allowed the authorities to qualify an interest payment as a deemed dividend if\nthe loans granted by an investor exceeded three times his or her share in total corporate\nequity as measured at the end of the last fiscal year. In such a case the deemed dividend then\nreduced the tax deductibility of interest for German corporate taxes. An exception applied if\nthe firm could convincingly argue that the same loan would have also been granted by a\nnonaffiliated third party or if the loan was only given temporarily. Effectively, the regulation\n4 In a recent study, Weichenrieder and Mintz (2007) highlight possible additional roles of holding companies\nfor avoiding taxation in an international setting. Empirically, another important role is the minimization of\nwithholding taxes.\n5 An attempt to curb thin capitalization by using a bylaw of the finance ministry was overturned by the courts.\nSee Weichenrieder (1995, p. 177) for an account of the history of the German TCR.\ncreated a safe haven if the intracompany-debt-to-equity ratio of three or less was complied\nwith, while higher levels of thin capitalization created the risk of nondeductible interest\npayments. The German TCR is only applicable if the investor's share in the corporation is at\nleast 25 percent (including shares held indirectly via affiliated entities). It also fails to be\nbinding for unincorporated businesses like branches of foreign multinationals and\npartnerships. Since the rule only applied to investors who could not claim an imputation tax\ncredit for dividends to reduce German income taxes, the TCR was mainly relevant for\nforeign owners of German corporations who are not subject to German income tax.\nAs mentioned above, the 1994 TCR gave a preference to holding companies that\ncould receive a loan from their owners up to nine times their equity stake in the firm (safe\nhaven of 9:1).6 To be considered a holding company under the regulation, a corporation\nmust either restrict itself to the provision of financial services to affiliated companies or hold\nshares in other corporations amounting to 75% of total assets or more.\nhaven for nonholding companies was reduced to 1.5:1, i.e., an interest payment could be\ndeemed a dividend if the loans granted by an investor exceeded her share of the corporate\nequity by 50 percent.7 While this further limited the amount of intracompany loans provided\nby a foreign parent to a German affiliate, a preference for holding companies continued to\napply. The safe haven for these companies was set at a ratio of 3:1.\nA second revision of the TCR was triggered by a ruling of the ECJ. In its decision of\n12 December 2002 it held that the German rule discriminated against EU investors. This\ntriggered a revision of the German TCR, which became effective in January 2004. The rules\ncontinue to allow deeming interest payments to affiliated parties to be dividends if the loan\ngranted by an investor exceeds 150 percent of the investor's share of corporate equity.8\n6 A special provision is available for banks.\n7 For loans with a variable interest rate a smaller safe haven of 0.5:1 applied.\n8 Corporations that can argue that a third party would have granted the loan at a comparable interest rate may\nexceed the ratio under the old and new rules.\nHowever, they now apply to foreign and domestic investors alike. In addition, the\npreferential safe haven for holding companies was lifted. As a measure to protect small and\nmedium-sized domestic firms with loans granted by their shareholders, interest is not\ndeemed a dividend if the interest paid to the investor falls short of 250,000. Because of\nlacking data for the post-2004 era, this paper does not attempt to give empirical evidence on\nthe effects of this last revision, but is mainly concerned with the introduction and the 2001\nrevision. Finally, it should be mentioned that Germany has recently enacted a further change\nin its approach towards thin capitalization. From the year 2008, the thin-capitalization rule\nhas been replaced by an earnings-stripping rule.9 Yet, the experience with previous\nlegislation can give potentially important lessons for the future and for other countries.\n3. German FDI Statistics\nTo evaluate the impact of German TCR legislation we make use of the German FDI\ndatabase MiDi of the Deutsche Bundesbank. By law, affiliates of foreign investors have to\nreport a reduced balance sheet to the Deutsche Bundesbank if the total assets of the direct\ninvestment meet mild size requirements. For wholly owned affiliates of foreign investors,\nfrom 2002. In the case where a foreign-owned company holds yet another German company,\ninformation has also to be provided on this dependent company, allowing a look at\nownership chains of foreign-owned firms in Germany.\nAmong other things, the database gives information on equity, third-party debt, loans\nreceived from affiliated firms inside and outside Germany, and total assets of foreign-owned\naffiliates in Germany. This information on financial structure makes the data a very good\nbasis for our empirical investigation.10\n9 For details see Bundesministerium der Finanzen (2007).\n10 Other studies that have used the German FDI database MiDi to identify tax effects on foreign-owned firms\nThe firm-level data from 1996 to 2004 has a panel structure that allows tracking of\nfirms across years. Unfortunately, this panel structure is missing for the years 1989 to 1995,\nand during this period firms cannot be traced over time. This implies that some effects of the\nGerman legislation can only be measured in a limited way. If, for example, the introduction\nof the TCR in 1994 has given incentives to use new holding companies to take advantage of\ntheir preferential treatment, then this behavior can only be detected since 1996. Similarly,\nchanges in the financial structure from the 1994 introduction of the TCR cannot be traced on\na firm level during the period 1994\u00ad1996. Our evaluation of the empirical effects will\ntherefore rest largely on the analysis of the 2001 reform of the rules.\n4. TCR and the effect on high-leveraged firms\nA first empirical question is whether the introduction in 1994 and the further tightening in\n2001 of the German TCR formed a binding restriction on firms with pronounced thin\ncapitalization and triggered a reduction in the relative prominence of intracompany loans.\nFigure 1 provides some descriptive evidence for nonfinancial incorporated affiliates by\ndepicting the ratio R of an investor's loans (plus the loans granted by other foreign-affiliated\nfirms) to the 'investor's share of total equity in German-incorporated affiliates over time.11\nMore precisely, the figure plots this ratio for a firm in the 25th percentile, for one in the 75th\npercentile, and for the median firm. The firms in the 75th percentile show very high\nintracompany loans provided by the foreign investor relative to his share in total equity.\nreceived loans from foreign investors or foreign-affiliated companies that amounted to more\nthan 200% of the foreign investor's equity. Simple eyeball econometrics would suggest that\n11 While the German TCR calls for using the lagged values of equity when calculating the safe-haven ratio, we\nhave to rely on the current equity for pre-1996 periods, as firms can be followed over time only from 1996\nonwards. For consistency reasons current equity is also used in Figure 1 for later years. Because of a special\nexemption for banks and differences in balance sheets, we excluded financial firms.\nthe introduction of the TCR in 1994 and its tightening in 2001 were accompanied by a\ndecrease in intracompany debt. While the pre-1994 value was around 400% for a firm in the\n75th percentile, it came down to some 300% after the introduction of the TCR and stayed in\nthis range for a couple of years, only to experience an additional decrease after the\nOf course, the picture drawn by Figure 1 may be deceptive. It is conceivable that\neven without the introduction and tightening of the TCR, a moderating time trend or other\nreasons for a reduced use of intracompany loans were present. For example, the cut in the\nGerman headline corporate tax from 40% to 25% in 2001 may have made intracompany\nloans less attractive (see Ramb and Weichenrieder 2005).\nFigure 2 is constructed similarly to Figure 1, but restricts attention to foreign-owned\nbranches (including partnerships), which are not subject to the German TCR. The graph\nshows that thin capitalization is not restricted to corporations, but can also be found for\nforeign-owned firms had a ratio R above 2: loans from foreign affiliated firms amounted to\nat least 200 percent of the foreign investor's equity. While branches have not been affected\nby the introduction of the TCR in 1994 and its tightening in 2001, they also showed a\ndecline in the use of intracompany loans over time. Conversely, during the years following\nthe tightening of the rules in 2001, branches showed a smaller reduction in R than did\ncorporations. Like corporations, branches experienced a decrease in the federal German\nFigure 1: Foreign loans over equity, corporations\nratio (R) of the foreign investor's loans to equity\n(end of year values)\nintroduction TCR,\nsafe haven\ninterest\nAnnotation: R is defined as a foreign investor's loans to a German affiliate, divided by his share in the\naffiliate's total capital (= paid up capital + capital reserves + surplus reserves + profit or loss carry forwards).\nThe upper curve (p75) denotes the value of R for a foreign firm in the 75th percentile; the middle curve, the\nmedian firm; and the lowest curve (p25), the value for the 25th percentile. The figure represents nonfinancial\nincorporated affiliates the immediate (co-)owner of which is a foreign investor. Holding companies have also\nbeen excluded.\nFigure 2: Foreign loans over equity, branches\nratio (R) of the foreign investor's loans to equity\n(end of year values)\nAnnotation: The figure represents nonfinancial unincorporated affiliates the immediate (co-)owner of which is\na foreign investor. For definitions see Figure 1.\nIn the next step we want to investigate econometrically the specific reactions that the\ntightening of the TCR rules had on foreign-owned firms in Germany, using micro data. A\nproblem that persists even with micro data at hand is that any decrease in the relative use of\nintracompany loans after the introduction may be attributable to a common time trend \u00ad the\n(uniform) reduction of the income taxes on branches and incorporated affiliates, or other\ncommon shocks \u00ad rather than to the tightening of the TCR. In other words, we are in need of\na control group that was not subject to the tightening of the TCR. While foreign-owned\ncorporations were potentially affected by the 2001 reform of the TCR, the regulations do not\napply to foreign partnerships and foreign-owned branches located in Germany. We therefore\nconsider these latter types of businesses as a potential control group, which we will in the\nfollowing call simply \"branches\".12\nAn important firm characteristic that we are interested in is the definition of intrafirm\ndebt as it is applied by the TCR. We therefore define the variable IRAT as the ratio of\nintrafirm debt, which a company has received from foreign-affiliated firms, to the total\nequity of the firm in the preceding year. The lag in the denominator of the ratio is motivated\nby the fact that such a lag is present in the relevant definition of the safe haven in the\nGerman tax code. Since in the following we will concentrate on years for which the data set\nhas a panel structure, we can eschew the (somewhat simpler) ratio R, which was used in\nFigure 1 and Figure 2, and replace it with IRAT. In the year 2000, a company may either\nhave had an IRAT of more or less than 1.5. If the reform of the TCR was affecting firm\nfinancial policy, then we should expect that firms that in 2000 had already complied with the\n2001 safe haven had a smaller incentive to reduce their IRAT than did firms that found\nthemselves in a situation beyond the future safe haven. More importantly, within the group\nof firms that in 2000 showed an IRAT of more than 1.5, corporations should have had a\n12 A conceivable alternative control group consists of firms with less than 25 percent foreign ownership. We\ndid not pursue this alternative for two reasons. First, the number of foreign-owned firms having a foreign\nownership between 10 and 25 percent is relatively small. Second, unlike branches, these firms have a much\ndifferent financial structure with few loans from foreign-affiliated firms.\nlarger incentive to reduce their IRAT than branches, as the TCR and its revision were not\napplicable to the latter group. In particular, corporations should have felt a larger incentive\nto reduce the ratio than branches. The strategy to empirically identify the effects of the\nregulation therefore is to look at whether corporations that in the year 2000 started with an\nIRAT of more than 150 percent showed a subsequent reduction in the amount for\nintracompany loans that was larger than the reduction for the control groups.13\nOf course, to be a suitable control group, branches should have similar financial\nstructures to corporations. As Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, this was roughly the case in 2000,\nthe year preceding the reform.\nWe start the empirical analysis by defining several variables. CORP takes on the\nvalue 1 if the firm under consideration is incorporated (and potentially affected by the TCR).\nIt is zero otherwise. Conversely, the dummy BRANCH takes on the value 1 if CORP = 0.\nThe variable RATIO is created as a dummy that equals zero if a firm in the year 2000 had an\nIRAT below or equal to 1.5, and that equals one otherwise. Finally, we employ a time\neffective, but takes on the value zero in 2000.\nThe variables used in our regression are built by interacting these dummies:\n13 We decided not to use data on 2003, because such data could have been contaminated by the expectation of\nWith the help of these variables we can form a baseline regression that uses IRAT as\nthe endogenous variable:\n(5) IRATit\n= tt\n+ fi\n+ uit\n.\nHere t is a year fixed effect, f is a firm fixed effect, and SALES is the yearly turnover\nof an observed firm. u is the error term. By construction, b1\nmeasure how the\nprecisely, because we included time fixed effects, the coefficients capture the differential\neffect with respect to the excluded base group CORP_LOW, i.e., the group of corporations\nthat started out with IRAT < 1.5 in 2000. First, we expect that the coefficient b1\nwill be\nsignificantly negative, since corporations that started out with IRAT2000\nfelt a larger pressure to adapt their financial structure than corporations that were already\ncomplying. While such a negative coefficient would be consistent with an influence of the\nTCR on financial policy, it could also result from a general tendency of high-leveraged firms\nto return to lower leverage. Therefore, we will also test whether b1\nis significantly different\nfrom the coefficient b2\nthat takes up the reactions of thinly capitalized branches.\nTo perform the regression we introduced several restrictions on the sample of\nselected firms. First, while the MiDi database contains firms that are indirectly owned by a\nforeign investor via a German intermediate firm, we concentrate on firms that are directly\nheld by a foreign investor with an ownership share of at least 25%. Only this type of firms\nwas affected by the pre-2004 TCR. Second, we drop firms that have more than one foreign\ninvestor. The reason is that the TCR requires calculating the ratio IRAT on an investor level,\nwhich from our data is impossible if there is more than one foreign investor. Third, to\ncalculate the ratio IRAT for the year 2000 we need 1999 information on equity. This\nadditionally reduces the sample. Fourth, we exclude observations with negative values of\nlagged equity, as in these cases it is not possible to calculate a sensible value for IRAT.\nFifth, we excluded holding companies, banks, and other financial firms that received a\ndifferent treatment under the TCR and/or possess a very different financial structure. Finally,\nwe require the firms in our sample to have three consecutive observations.14 This leaves us\nwith a working sample of 1699 corporations and branches observed over the period 2000\u00ad\nTable 1 gives an overview of the firms in our four different baskets. Using the\nborderline of IRAT = 1.5, we have 109 branches with low levels of thin capitalization\n(IRAT  1.5), and 34 branches with a high level (IRAT > 1.5). Corporations are somewhat\nmore likely to fall in the high basket than branches: we have 576 high-leveraged\nWithin the group of branches (corporations) that in 2000 had a ratio of 1.5 or less, the\naverage was 0.286 (0.437). Branches and incorporated affiliates are roughly similar when\nwe look at the subgroups of firms that in 2000 had IRAT > 1.5: for incorporated firms IRAT\nthen averaged 525 percent, compared to 431 percent for branches.\nInterestingly, the average size of the firms (as measured by turnover) in the four\nbaskets hardly depends on incorporation. Indeed, the average sales in the low and high\nbaskets are slightly higher for branches.\nTable 2 reports the result for the empirical model in equation (5), while Table 3\ncontains the relevant descriptive statistics of the sample. First, consider the column in\nTable 2 that uses IRAT as the dependent variable. As explained above, we grouped firms\ninto four baskets. We included dummies for three groups and chose low-leveraged\ncorporations as the base case for which no dummy applies. The significant negative\ncoefficient of the variable CORP_HIGH_01_02 therefore indicates that corporations that in\n2000 started out with high intracompany loans (IRAT > 1.5) significantly reduced their thin\n14 During our period of interest (2000\u00ad2002) there was a change in the reporting requirement that induced the\ndropout of a large number of small firms with less than 3 million balance sheet total. The requirement of three\nconsecutive observations makes sure that for our sample the number of observations per firm is not correlated\nwith firm size. Since the endogenous variable is a ratio with equity in the denominator, equity losses\nsometimes produce very extreme values in the endogenous variable. We therefore excluded 5 percent of the\nremaining firms on the basis that their value of IRAT in one of the three years exceeded 20.9. We also\nexcluded a limited number of firms that changed from an incorporated to an unincorporated status during our\nperiod of interest.\ncapitalization in the following two years, in contrast with corporations that started out with a\nvalue of IRAT below 1.5.\nWhile this result is indicative, one may object that corporations in the high-leveraged\nsubsample had simply more opportunity to reduce this ratio. To infer whether the tightening\nof the thin-cap rules was effective, it is therefore necessary to compare the corporations that\nstarted with IRAT > 1.5 with those unincorporated firms that also started out with a high\nlevel of thin capitalization. If there is a different effect on corporations from that on\nunincorporated firms that were not affected by the tightening of the regulation, then we\nshould expect the coefficient b1\nto be significantly different (smaller) from the estimated\ncoefficient b2\n. Indeed, this is the case, and the linear restriction b1\nis rejected at the 5-\npercent level. On average, high-leveraged corporations reduced IRAT by 120 percentage\npoints more than high-leveraged branches.\nThe next five columns report how other balance sheet items have reacted to the\ntightening of the TCR. One way to accommodate a reduction of intracompany loans could\nbe to reduce investment. The results in the second column give no evidence of such a\nreaction. The coefficient for high-leveraged corporations does not differ from that of low-\nleveraged corporations, nor does it differ from the one for high-leveraged unincorporated\nfirms. The hypothesis b1\ncannot be rejected at usual significance levels. The third\nregression shows that, if anything, corporations that tended to be affected by the tightening\nof the TCR increased their financial assets more than other corporations. But the test b1\nis only rejected at the 11-percent level. Another possible reaction of corporations to\naccommodate to the tightened TCR is to increase equity. In comparison with low-leveraged\ncorporations, the increase in equity for high-leveraged corporations indeed is highly\nsignificant. When the change is compared with the change for unincorporated firms with\nhigh leverage, however, the difference in differences is not significant. The fifth regression\nin Table 2 shows the relative change in intracompany loans. The estimated coefficient of\nimplies that, compared with low-leveraged levered corporations, high-\nleveraged corporations reduced their average amount of intracompany loans by 103\npercent.15 The comparison with high-leveraged unincorporated businesses yields no\nsignificant results, that is, the hypothesis b1\ncannot be refuted.\nThe estimated coefficients for log SALES turn out to be insignificant in columns 1\nthrough 4 of Table 2, but at least weakly significant and positive in columns 5 and 6. This\nsuggests that firms that experience an increase in sales tend to prefer an increase in\nintracompany loans and third-party debt over an increase in equity.\nAnnotations: The first figure denotes the mean value of a variable in the respective basket, the second denotes\nthe median. Sales are measured in thousands of euros.\nTo examine the robustness of our results and to gain additional insights into the\nworking of the thin-capitalization rules, we also tested a finer grouping of firms. For that\npurpose we divided all firms for which in the year 2000 IRAT was larger than 1.5 into three\nsubgroups. HIGH1 (HIGH2, HIGH3) indicates the lowest (middle, highest) leveraged\nsubgroup with IRAT > 1.5. The dividing lines between these subgroups were drawn such\nthat each of the three groups had the same number of firms. This produced the following\nsubgroup HIGH2 (HIGH3), 2.61 < IRAT < 5 (IRAT > 5). While this additional grouping\nmay allow identifying more exactly what types of firms did react, the split-up produces\nrather small groups of unincorporated affiliates against which the development of\nHIGH1, HIGH2, and HIGH3, the corresponding group sizes are 13, 12, and 9 for branches.\n15 This of course must imply that the control group of firms on average increased their intracompany loans,\nallowing for a difference of more than 100 percent.\nTable 2: Differential effects on thin capitalization of incorporated firms\nIRAT\nLog of fixed\nassets and\nintangibles\nLog of\nfinancial\nassets\nLog of\nequity\nLog of\nintracompany\nloans\nLog of third-\nparty debt\nAnnotations: ***significant at 1% level, **significant at 5% level, *significant at 10% level.

While this\nseems to suggest limited evidence for the impact of the 2001 reform on corporations, one\nshould keep in mind the rather small group sizes.\nAs in Table 2, the results of Table 4 show now evidence that corporations reacted to\nthe tightened TCR by disinvesting (column 2) or reducing financial assets (column 3). At the\nsame time, the results in column (4) suggest that the affected corporations increased their\nequity to comply with the tightened rules. The significance of the reduction in intracompany\nloans depends on the comparison group. The reduction is always significant for high-\nleveraged corporations if the comparison is with low-leveraged corporations. If compared\nwith branches having similar leverage, then the policy change is only significant for group\nTable 4: Differential effects in different thin-cap classes\nIRAT\nLog of fixed\nand\nintangibles\nassets\nLog of\nfinancial\nassets Log of\nequity\nLog of\nintracomp\nany loans\nLog of third-\nparty debt\nAnnotations: ***significant at 1% level, **significant at 5% level, *significant at 10% level.

The same applies to the other logged variables.\n.\nBy and large, our estimation results indicate that the tightened TCR was successful in\nreducing thin capitalization.16 At the same time, we find no evidence that firms that were\nmost likely to be affected by the new rule reduced investment.17 Instead, the results suggest\n16 This is also confirmed by a recent paper by Overesch and Wamser (2006) that does not consider the exact\nchannels through which the firms reacted.\n17 We also checked whether firms that, because of their initial value of IRAT, were particularly affected by the\nTCR tightening had a smaller survival probability in subsequent years, but found no such evidence.\nthat corporations with high levels of thin capitalization increased their equity and tended to\nreduce intracompany loans.\n5. The creation of ownership chains\nAs discussed in the previous section, a foreign firm that faces the need to adjust its\nfinancial structure because of a thin-capitalization rule may increase its equity base, increase\nthe use of third-party debt, or reduce the amount of intracompany loans along with total\nassets.\nIn the German case, also a less straightforward route was conceivable. Given that\nholding companies enjoyed a preferential safe haven under the 1994 TCR, foreign investors\nmay have found it attractive to use an ownership chain to circumvent the implications of the\nTCR for nonholding companies. Figure 3 illustrates. Under a direct ownership structure\nalternative indirect structure (case B), the parent establishes a holding company and endows\nit with a debt-to-equity ratio as high as 9:1. These funds can be used by the holding company\nto buy the preexisting affiliate from the parent without triggering a net inflow of funds into\nGermany.18 The larger the purchase price, the larger the total debt and equity that can be\nallocated to the holding company. Since the holding company is a German legal entity, it\ndoes not fall under the 1994 TCR and may endow the affiliate with debt. But even if it holds\nonly equity of the affiliate, the total allowable intracompany debt that could be channeled to\nGermany is larger than in the direct case.\nUnlike in the direct case A, the dividends paid by the affiliates do not directly accrue\nto the parent, but take a route via a holding company. In a last step, to ensure that the interest\npaid on the parent debt is tax-deductible from the profits earned by the affiliate, the two\n18 It should be mentioned that the holding company, to qualify for the preferential safe haven, had to hold at\nleast one additional company, the size of which was irrelevant, however.\nGerman affiliates have to enter into a profit transfer agreement to assure tax consolidation\nbetween the holding company and the affiliate, which allows interest paid by the affiliate to\nbe used to reduce profits transferred to the holding company.\nFigure 3: Direct versus indirect ownership structure\nMuttergesellschaft\nOperative\nGesellschaft\nMuttergesellschaft\nOperative\nGesellschaft\nParent Subsidiary\nSubsidiary\nSubsidiary\nHome Country\nGermany\nMuttergesellschaft Holding\nOperative\nGesellschaft\nDebt or Equity\nConsolidation\nMuttergesellschaft Holding\nGesellschaft\nParent\nHolding\nCompany\nSubsidiary\nA\nB\nAfter 2000, a change from a direct to an indirect ownership structure still allowed\nlarger amounts of intracompany debt for German affiliates, but, as laid out above, while the\nsafe haven for normal corporations was set to 1.5:1, the safe haven for holding companies\nwas only lowered to 3:1. The scheme laid out above was well known to tax-law practitioners\n(see Krebs 1998), and it is an empirical question to what extent it indeed was used to escape\nthe German TCR. Our principal question in this section therefore is the possible extent to\nwhich foreign-owned firms have changed their internal structure from a direct one to an\nindirect one as illustrated by Figure 3?\nAgain, our investigation is impeded by the fact that the database MiDi lacks a panel\nstructure for years prior to 1996, which makes it impossible to track foreign affiliates over\ntime for the period 1993\u00ad1996, so changes in the ownership structure can only be detected\nafter 1996. A change in ownership structure from direct to indirect may have been motivated\nby the TCR if the following conditions hold:\n- The corporation that is used to form the ownership chain must be a holding company, as\nonly those could benefit from the preferential safe haven.\n- The ownership fraction that the holding company acquires in the affiliate must be at least\n50%, the minimum to establish a profit transfer agreement that is accepted for tax\npurposes.\n- The dependent affiliate must be outside the banking industry, as this industry is not\naffected by the German TCR.\nTable 5: Affiliates with change from direct to indirect ownership19\nYear\nChanges from\ndirect to indirect\n(constant parent)\nThereof:\npre-\nexisting\nholding\ncompany\nChanges from\ndirect to indirect\n(constant country\nof parent)\nThereof:\npre-\nexisting\nholding\ncompany\nChanges from\ndirect to indirect\n(changing\ncountry of\nparent)\nThereof:\npre-\nexisting\nholding\ncompany\nAnnotation: The table reports the number of affiliates that are reported as indirectly held via a German\nintermediate holding company, but were owned directly by a foreign investor in the preceding reported year.\nTo be included, the dependent affiliate must not be in the banking sector, and the holding company in the\nownership chain in the current year must own at least 50% of the equity. As in the preceding section, we\nexcluded affiliates with more than one foreign investor.\nBased on the above criteria, we found a total of 389 foreign-owned affiliates that initially\nwere held directly by a foreign investor and were transformed into an indirect participation\n19 In 48 cases a single holding company took over two or more previously directly held affiliates in the same\nyear.\ncases, the change from direct to indirect ownership via a German holding company left the\nidentity of the foreign parent unchanged (Table 5, column 1). But some of the restructurings\nwere accompanied by other changes in ownership: in 182 cases the inclusion of the German\nholding company was accompanied by a change in the identity of the foreign parent firm,\nbut the new parent resided in the same country (Table 5, column 3).20 In these cases, the\nrestructuring in Germany may have been going along with a restructuring of the corporate\ngroup in the parent country. A German affiliate that used to be held via a certain corporation\nabroad may have been moved to a different corporation within the same company group.\nHence, the ultimate foreign group that owns the German affiliate could have stayed the\nsame. Conversely, the previous parent may have sold the German affiliate to a new investor\nwho then preferred a German ownership chain rather than direct ownership. In this second\ncase, tax considerations are less likely to be the decisive reason for the change to indirect\nownership. For example, the new owner at the time of purchase of the German affiliate may\nhave already owned a German holding company and for governance reasons may have\ndecided to transfer the ownership to it. Indeed, while only 30% of the 94 affiliates in column\n1 were transferred to a preexisting holding company for which data in the database is\navailable years prior to acquisition, ownership for 57% of the 182 companies of column 2\nwas transferred to a preexisting German holding company. So we decided to report this case\nseparately.\nBesides the cases reported in columns 1 and 3, column 5 also reports cases in which\nboth the parent and the country of the parent have changed. In these cases, 55% of the\naffiliates were transferred to preexisting holding companies, 45% of the affiliates were taken\nover by holding companies that in the previous years were not included in the database.\n20 The MiDi database does not give information on characteristics of the foreign parent, but it reports an\nidentification number for the parent and the country of residency.\nTable 6: Developments in balance sheet items (bn. )\nUltimate parent unchanged Parent stays in same country Country of parent changes\nYears Affiliates Holding comp. Affiliates Holding comp. Affiliates Holding comp.\n(1) before\nDifference\n(4) before\nDifference\n(7) before\nDifference\nDifference\nDifference\nDifference\nA first question is whether the changes in ownership structure that are described by\nTable 5 have economic significance. The 94 affiliates that are reported in column 1\nrepresented a balance sheet total of some 13.8bn. evaluated at the end of the year in which\nthe respective changes in the ownership link occurred. The equivalent figure for the group of\ncolumn 5 was 9.5bn. These figures compare to the balance sheet total of all directly held\naffiliates in our sample (with at least 50 percent foreign ownership, outside banking) of\nrepresenting 3980 affiliates.21 Clearly, the firms that experienced a change from direct\nownership to indirect ownership via a German holding company were above average size,\nand the total assets involved are considerable, reflecting a moderate but nonmarginal\nfraction of total foreign-owned assets in Germany.\nIn a next step, we investigate to what extent the changes in the ownership links have\ntriggered an increase in total debt within Germany and, concurrently, an increase of debt tax\nshelter. Table 6 collects the relevant data. Since the advantages of using a German holding\ncompany structure were lowered by the 2001 TCR reform, we split all restructurings\n2000 and 2003. When we compare the year before and after the change of the ownership\nlink and look at the total debt variable for the 94 firms with a constant ultimate parent, we\nfind that the total volume of debt was roughly kept constant. For those firms restructured\nbefore 2001, columns 1 and 2 indicate that the aggregated value of total debt was 4.0bn.\nbefore and 4.1bn. in the year after the restructuring. Restructurings after 2000, in total,\nhave been associated with a reduction in debt. The fact that the restructurings did not\nsignificantly increase the debt levels of affiliates does not rule out a tax motivation for the\nchange in the ownership link. Such a conclusion would overlook that the holding companies\nheavily increased their debt levels. For these, the aggregated values of total debt increased\n21 The reduction of the number of affiliates is due to a redefinition of the reporting requirements in 2002.\naggregated increase in loans from affiliated companies outside Germany by 6.0bn.\nsecond (columns 4 and 5).22 The increase in total assets that was experienced by the holding\ncompanies in both time windows was somewhat larger than the total assets of the affiliates\nthat were taken over. This may indicate either that the purchase price (paid to the foreign\nparent) was considerably larger than the equity of the acquired affiliate, or that the holding\ncompany bought other assets during the year of the ownership change. The database allows\ncalculating the increase in financial assets of the holding companies that are associated with\nportion of the increase came from investments in other financial assets. Hence, if the holding\ncompanies invested in other assets than the German affiliate, which was acquired from the\nparent, then the other financial investments were also in affiliated firms.\nOverall, the data for the 94 cases in which a directly held affiliate has been\ntransformed into an indirect participation implies that the transactions were suitable for\nreducing taxable income in Germany. On the one hand, the funds channeled to Germany are\nused by the holding companies to earn tax-exempt income from owning shares in affiliated\ncompanies. On the other hand, a large fraction of the funds provided by the foreign parent\ntook the form of intracompany loans, the interest on which is tax-deductible in Germany and\ntaxable abroad. The extent to which the ownership restructurings have pumped debt into\nGermany has changed over the years. While the holding companies involved have increased\ntheir borrowings from affiliated companies considerably when the holding company\nprivilege was still generous (i.e., before 2001), the effect in later years has flattened off.\n22 For this calculation the debt and total assets of firms that did not appear in the data prior to the ownership\nchange was set to zero. Since the reporting requirements are rather moderate, this should lead to only small\nerrors.\nNext, consider the 182 cases in which the affiliate experienced a change from direct\nto indirect participation, but the ultimate parent changed even though the country of the\nultimate investor stayed the same. Again, a comparison of the last year before the ownership\nchange to the first balance sheet after the change shows that, also in this group of\nrestructurings, most changes in leverage occurred at the level of the German holding\ncompanies, but hardly at the level of the ultimate German affiliate. Total assets of the 182\n0.2bn (0.5bn). At the same time, the shares in affiliated companies of the holding\nincrease in debt levels at the holding company level. Total debt increased by 14.9bn. and\n10.7bn. in the two time windows, and the lion's share involved intracompany loans.\nFinally, consider the 128 cases of changes in the ownership chain that implied a\nchange of the country of the foreign direct investor. Evaluated at the year after the\nownership change, the total assets of the affiliates were 4.7bn. and 4.8bn. during the two\ntime windows. Compared to these values, the increase in the shares of the holding\ncompanies was quite pronounced at 9.6bn. and 5.2bn. In the first (second) time window,\nthe restructuring was associated with an increase of cross-border intracompany loans by\nTaken together, the figures in Table 6 imply that the 389 cases of restructuring of\nownership were accompanied by an increase of intracompany loans to German holding\nSince a large fraction of holding companies that served as vehicles to increase\nGerman intracompany loans are new establishments, this points to a potential problem of\nprevious studies that tried to identify the effects of international tax differentials on leverage\ndecisions. Often these studies employ fixed-effects panel estimations that cannot take up the\neffect of new firms. To the extent that changes of leverage are conducted by using new\nvehicles, within estimators that only capture the change occurring in existing affiliates may\nunderestimate debt shifting activities.\nThe above calculations illustrate that ownership restructurings have been extensively\nused to increase the level of intracompany loans from abroad. A remaining issue is the\nextent to which the increase in intracompany loans would have been possible without the use\nof holding companies. Instead of using intermediate holding companies, a directly held\naffiliate could pay out accumulated earnings as a dividend and borrow back these funds from\nits foreign parent. The attractiveness of this policy option depends of course on whether the\nTCR are already binding, and this is likely if the intracompany loans are larger than the\nrelevant save haven. Evidence is provided by considering equity and intracompany loans\nfrom abroad aggregated on a company group level for those foreign investments that have\nbeen restructured using a German intermediate holding company. For this purpose, we take\nthe sum of all intracompany loans that a group of German affiliates owes to affiliated\ncompanies outside Germany and divide it by the total equity of all the affiliates that are\ndirectly held by the foreign parent. We do not include the equity of indirectly held affiliates,\nas this should already be reflected in the equity of the German intermediate firm. Groups of\ncompanies are identified by the same identification number of their foreign parent. All\nnumbers are collected for the years after an ownership change.\nThe figures collected in Table 7 show that in many cases, the aggregated ratio of\ncross-border intracompany loans to parent equity (post restructuring) would have complied\nwith the respective TCR even without making use of the holding company privilege. For\nexample, the median ratio for all company groups before 2001 was 2.136, when the German\n1.5 was allowed by TCR standards. This suggests that for some foreign-owned firms the\nownership restructuring may have been the preferred way of increasing leverage in Germany\nfor other reasons than working round the TCR. At the same time, for quite a number of\ncases, the overall ratio of intracompany loans to net equity was beyond the respective safe\nhaven, and the intention to work around the TCR is a prime candidate for explaining the\nrestructuring.\nTable 7: Group financing ratios (total loans from affiliated firms outside Germany divided\nby equity of directly held firms)\nObservations 25th percentile Median 75th percentile\nAll restructurings\nSame parent only\nParent country unchanged, parent\nchanged\nParent country changed\nTable 8: Number of restructurings in thin-capitalized groups\nPeriod Changes from\ndirect to indirect\n(constant parent)\nThereof:\nabove\nTCR\nthreshold\nChanges from\ndirect to indirect\n(constant country\nof parent)\nThereof:\nabove\nTCR\nthreshold\nChanges from\ndirect to indirect\n(changing\ncountry of\nparent)\nThereof:\nabove\nTCR\nthreshold\nTable 8, which takes advantage of the same measure of leverage as Table 7, reports\non the exact number of restructurings that led to a thin capitalization above the safe haven\nlevel in the absence of a holding company and its privilege. Aggregated across all three\ntypes of restructurings, this has been the case for some 50% of the restructured affiliates. If\nwe look at the relevant fraction of total debt increases due to higher holding company debt,\nevidence suggests that debt increases were concentrated in groups of firms with pronounced\nthin capitalization (after restructuring). At the same time it suggests that in many cases the\noverall debt levels reached by the ownership change would have been possible without the\nintermediate holding company.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\nThe paper has looked at the experience of the German TCR from various angles. The\nintroduction in 1994 as well as the tightening of the rules in 2001 was followed by a visible\nreduction of thin capitalization among the foreign-owned affiliates with the largest fraction\nof cross-border intracompany borrowings as a fraction of equity. However, the role of the\nthin-capitalization rules needed careful econometric consideration, as the intracompany\nloans of branches, which did not fall under the TCR, experienced the same declining trend.\nThe econometric analysis produced a significant effect of the TCR: the reduction of the ratio\nbetween loans from affiliated parties and foreign-owned equity was more pronounced for\nhigh-leveraged corporations then for unincorporated affiliates starting with a similar share of\nthin capitalization. In the German case, the TCR did not seem to produce a reduction in\ninvestment. While not or only weakly significant, our results suggest that affiliates reacted\nby using more equity and more third-party debt.\nA second part of the paper has highlighted a loophole of the legislation that was due\nto a preference given to holding companies. For this reason, foreign multinationals could\nwork around the German TCR by introducing a German intermediate holding company that\nused loans from affiliated companies abroad to buy a preexisting affiliate. Based on the\nMiDi data of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the paper shows that for the period 1997-2003 the\nuse of holding company structures has been responsible for a total of more than 37bn. of\nnew intracompany loans in the nonfinancial sector, which should have led to a sizable\nincrease in tax-deductible interest in Germany and a loss in tax revenues. However,\nrestructurings of this type were also observed in cases where the relative level of\nintracompany loans was low. Therefore, not all of the restructurings that have taken place\ncan be interpreted as an effort to work around the TCR. Instead, for some of the cases the\nuse of a leveraged intermediate holding company may have been considered an easier\napproach than an increase in the leverage of the operating affiliate. This is a potentially\nimportant message for empirical estimates of the elasticity of leverage with respect to tax\nrates. In many cases the empirical identification strategy has looked at the within variation\nof tax rates and leverage for a given set of affiliates. If multinationals rather react to tax\ndifferentials by setting up new affiliates, then the within variation may seriously\nunderestimate the tax-rate elasticity of leverage.\nBibliography\nAltshuler, Rosanne and Jack Mintz (1995), \"US interest-allocation rules: Effects and\npolicy\", International tax and public finance 2, 7-35.\nAltshuler, Rosanne and Harry Grubert (2003), \"Repatriation taxes, repatriation strategies\nBecker, Johannes, Clemens Fuest, and Thomas Hemmelgarn (2006), Corporate tax reform\nand foreign direct investment in Germany: Evidence from firm-level data, CESifo\nBuettner, Thiess, Michael Overesch, Ulrich Schreiber, and Georg Wamser (2007), The\nimpact of thin-capitalization rules on multinationals' financing and investment\ndecisions, Ifo Discussion Paper.\nDesai, M.A., C.
