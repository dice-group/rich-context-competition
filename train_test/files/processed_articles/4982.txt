On March 1, 2015, a\nnew negative reinforcement intervention involving \"service fees\" for a visit without appointment was implemented at King\nAbdullah University Hospital in Jordan. To evaluate the effect of this intervention in improving patient adherence to medical\nappointment, a retrospective preintervention and postintervention analysis was used, including all patients (n = 65535) who\nhad scheduled appointments at 39 outpatient clinics. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was first performed. Then,\na multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors that might predict individuals who are likely to attend\nor miss their appointments and those who have a greater tendency to visit the hospital with or without appointments.\nAlthough the average percentage of appointments attended was more than missed preintervention and postintervention, the\ndecrease in percentage of missed appointments was more pronounced postintervention. Also, the average percentage of\nvisits without appointments was less than visits with appointments in both times, but the decrease in the percentage of visits\nwithout appointments was more prominent after. The regression analysis revealed that younger, married and male patients\nwere more likely to miss their appointment before and after the intervention. Also, younger patients had a tendency to\nattend without appointments. Conversely, patients with the lower copayment rate had a tendency to adhere to appointment\ntimes. In conclusion, negative reinforcement interventions could improve patient appointment adherence rates. Accordingly,\ninterventions designed that consider evidence and are theory-based are needed to change patient behavior.\n",

Nusairat, MSc, PhD1\n Keywords\nappointment adherence, no-show, negative reinforcement, patient behavior, hospital\nArticle\nIntroduction\nOver the last years, there has been revived interest in adher-\nence to medical appointments; this was strongly influenced\nby the high prevalence of no-show behavior and its subse-\nquent impact.1,2 No-show prevalence rates vary across health\ncare settings and populations. In the structured review con-\nducted by Turkcan et al,1 the mean no-show prevalence\nacross the 62 studies included was 23.8%, with the highest\nrate occurring in North America (27.1%) and the lowest\nundertaken in Asia.1\nNo-show behavior affects all parties involved in the deliv-\nery of health care, including patients, families, providers,\nand insurance agencies. For patients, missed appointments\nresult in poor treatment adherence, disruption of multidisci-\nplinary health care, and difficulty in patient-provider rela-\ntionship.3 They are also associated with increased risk of\nrehospitalization,4,5 poor control of chronic conditions,3,5 and\ncan affect the health of other patients who lose the opportu-\nnity to receive timely care.6 For health care providers, missed\nappointments reduce the chance of junior physicians to learn\nfrom different cases,7 and could lead to staff underutilization,\nlower productivity, and increased costs.2,8-11\nSeveral studies were conducted to identify the risk factors\nassociated with no-show behavior and characteristics of those\n1Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan\nCorresponding Author:\nMohammad Alyahya, Department of Health Management and Policy,\nFaculty of Medicine, Jordan University of Science and Technology, P.O.\nEmail: Msalyahya@just.edu.jo\npatients who are likely to miss their appointments. Many of\nthese studies reached the same conclusion that being young,\nfrom minority racial or ethnic groups, or single, all signifi-\ncantly increased the likelihood of missing appointments.12-19\nOther possible predictors were insurance status, gender, lower\nincome, and day and time of appointment.18,19 A wide range\nof reasons why patients do not adhere to their medical\nappointments have also been extensively studied.\nThe most commonly self-reported reason for failure to\nattend was that patients \"forgot\" their scheduled medical\nappointments. This explains why reminding interventions\n(ie, phone calls, mails, and SMS) have received a substantial\namount of attention, though reminders do not necessarily\nchange patient behavior. Other identified reasons included\nlack of transportation, competing priorities with work time,\nfamily problems, difficulties with appointment scheduling\nsystems, and patient's health status such as feeling better or\nTo improve appointment adherence, several interventions\nhave been utilized. Common interventions include appoint-\nment reminders, cancellation policy, patient education, and\nusing a financial incentive.6,7,23-26 Despite the availability of\nthese interventions, no-show behavior remains a burden to\nhealth care systems. Various policies have also attempted to\ncurb the negative consequences of no-show behavior. Such\npolicies include open-access or same day scheduling, follow-\nup after a no-show appointment, and overbooking appoint-\nments.27-30 Although these interventions and policies have\nbeen shown to reduce no-show rates, they are costly and\nlabor-intensive, and their applicability is questionable.13,31\nOverbooking, for instance, increases patient wait time\nand patient dissatisfaction, and might lead to work overload\nat specific times.24,32 It has also been found that open-access\nscheduling does not always result in a significant reduction\nin no-show rates.33-35 Moreover, it is impractical to impose\nfinancial penalties on those patients who did not attend\ntheir scheduled appointment, as well as ethical and legal\nissue. Insurance agencies such as Medicaid in the United\nStates do not permit health care providers to charge no-\nNew Intervention\nRecently, on March 1, 2015, a new intervention was launched\nat King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH), which is\naffiliated with the Jordan University of Science and\nTechnology (JUST). Instead of using financial penalties, this\nintervention charges 15 Jordanian Dinars (US$21) for a visit\nwithout an appointment. If a patient misses a scheduled\nappointment, he or she has to wait a long time to reschedule\na new appointment, and may search for other ways to be seen\nby doctors. Many patients try to use their social relationships\nto be seen, which places a heavy burden on hospital resources.\nUnscheduled appointments are considered overbooking, and\nnegatively affect those patients who already have a\nscheduled appointment by increasing their wait time.\nUnscheduled patients also burden doctors by increasing the\nnumber of patients in the clinics, which causes doctors to\nhave to rearrange patient time slots for those who have\nadhered to their appointments. The new policy applies to all\noutpatient services, irrespective of the nature of the visit.\nHowever, individual employees at KAUH and JUST, as well\nas their dependents, are exempt from the policy.\nThis intervention adopted by KAUH uses negative rein-\nforcement to change patient behavior. In operant condition-\ning learning theory, negative reinforcement is defined as\nthe removal, reduction, or escape of an unpleasant stimulus\ncontingent upon a behavior, which results in an increased\nfuture rate of responding (behavior frequency).36,37 Negative\nreinforcement and punishment are often confused, because\nboth involve the removal of an aversive stimulus. However,\nthey differ from each other in how response is triggered and\nthe effect on governing individual behavior.36,38 First, nega-\ntive reinforcement entails avoiding a negative result when a\ndesired behavior occurs, whereas punishment implies\napplying a negative consequence when undesired behavior\nis exhibited.36,39 Hence, by attending scheduled appoint-\nments, patients escape the negative consequences of a visit\nwithout an appointment. This in turn would decrease the\nappointment no-show rate. Second, negative reinforcement\nenhances the frequency of desired behavior, while whereas\npunishment reduces undesired target behavior.36,39,40 Instead\nof punishing those who do not attend their appointments,\nthe intervention was introduced to increase the attendance\nrate.\nAccordingly, the primary objective of this study is to\nidentify whether the implementation of \"service fees\" for\noutpatient visits without a previously scheduled appointment\nas a negative reinforcer can improve patient attendance at\nscheduled appointments with the hospital. The study also\naims to identify the main predictors of no-show behavior and\nvisits without appointment.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Data Collection\nThis is a preintervention and postintervention study41 of all\npatients who had scheduled appointments from September 1,\nafter--at KAUH. KAUH is a multispecialty teaching hospi-\ntal with 527 beds; it provides a wide range of health services\nand is considered as a referral hospital for 4 cities in the\nNorth of Jordan. Services provided by KAUH are in high\ndemand, especially the outpatient clinics, which are\nrenowned for their competent medical staff and availability\nof advanced technology.\nThe data of the study were extracted retrospectively from\nthe database of the 39 outpatient specialist clinics at the hos-\npital. For each patient, the following data were obtained:\nAlyahya et al 3\nattended appointments 6 months before, missed appoint-\nments 6 months before, total appointments 6 months before,\nattended appointments 6 months after, missed appointments\n6 months after, and total appointments 6 months after.\nSimilarly, the data included numbers of total visits 6 months\nbefore, visits with appointments 6 months before, visits\nwithout appointments 6 months before, total visits 6 months\nafter, visits with appointments 6 months after, and visits\nwithout appointments 6 months after. In addition, data on\ndemographic variables and patient characteristics such as fee\nexemption status, patient age, gender, marital status, and\ncopayment status were also collected.\nEthical approval.This study received ethical approval from\nthe institutional review board (IRB) committee at KAUH\nData Analysis\nDescriptive statistics are reported for appointments showed\nup and visits with appointments before and after the inter-\nvention. As the data before and after the intervention were\nobserved on the same patients, a repeated-measures analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effect\nof the intervention on appointment adherence and visits\nwithout appointments. The significance of collected factors\nand covariates on the probability of attending appointments\nand the probability of visits with appointments was tested.\nFactors considered included intervention, exemption status,\ngender, marital status, and copayment.Age of the patient was\ntreated as a covariate.\nTo identify factors that may predict individuals who are\nlikely to miss their appointments and those who have a\ngreater tendency to visit the hospital without prescheduled\nappointments, a multivariate linear regression model was\nused to relate the probability of adherence to appointments\nand probability of visits with appointments to the significant\nfactors found in the repeated-measures ANOVA. The analy-\nsis was performed using SPSS 20.0.\nResults\nA total of 65535 patients who had scheduled appointments\nduring the study period were identified. The mean age of\nmean percentage of missed appointments decreased from\nthe postintervention period. This difference reflected a reduc-\nInterestingly, the mean percentage of visits without appoint-\npostintervention.\nEffect of the Intervention on Appointment\nAdherence and Visits With Appointments\nBased on the patients' characteristics, means and SDs for\npercentages of attended appointments and percentages of\nvisits with appointments before and after the intervention\nare shown in Table 2. A repeated-measures ANOVA with\nintervention (before and after the intervention) as within-\nsubjects factor and gender (male, female), marital status\n(single, married), exemption status (yes [with], no [with-\nout]), and copayment group (groups1 through 4) as\nbetween-subjects along with patient age as a covariate was\nconducted. Two response variables were considered; the\nfirst was the probability of a show-up in an appointment\ncalculated as the percentage of appointments the patient\nshowed up of the total appointments (Table 3). The second\nresponse variable was the probability of a visit with appoint-\nment obtained as the percentage of visits with appointments\nof the total visits (Table 4).\nFor the probability of a show-up in an appointment,\nANOVA results revealed that intervention (P < .001), age\nwere the significant factors along with the 2-factor interac-\ntions: Intervention \u00d7 Age (P < .001), Intervention \u00d7\nMarital status \u00d7 Copayment (P = .004). Exemption status\nwas a marginally significant factor with a P value of .093.\nFor the probability of visits with appointment, the effect\nmarital status (P < .001), and copayment (P < .001) were all\nsignificant. The following 2-factor interactions were also\nsignificant: Intervention \u00d7 Gender (P = .051), Intervention \u00d7\nTable 1.

Table 5 shows the estimated\nregression parameters along with their 95% confidence inter-\nvals (CIs). Based on the parameter estimates, we found that\nfemale patients had a higher probability of adherence to\nappointments than males, with increased probability after the\nintervention. In contrast, married patients were more likely\nto miss their appointments than single patients. Married\npatients have shown a slight improvement in the adherence\nafter the intervention. Among copayment groups, group 3\npatients had the lowest probability of adherence compared\nwith other groups (before and after). This means that patients\nwithin the lower range of copayment rate had a tendency to\nattend their appointments. However, all groups have shown a\nsignificant increased probability of adherence after the inter-\nvention. Patients with no exemption have shown a slightly\nreduced probability of adherence to appointments after the\nintervention compared with that before the intervention. The\nresults also indicated that older patients had a tendency to\nattend appointments, particularly after the intervention.\nIn concordance with the above findings, female patients\nhad a higher probability of visits with appointments than\nmale patients. Also, the probability of visits with appoint-\nments for married patients has improved after the interven-\ntion. Patients with the lower copayment rates were less likely\nto attend without previous appointment, whereas younger\npatients were much more likely to attend without appoint-\nments. Finally, a substantial improvement in the probability\nof visits with appointment has been achieved after the inter-\nvention for patients with no exemption.\nDiscussion\nAppointment adherence is a health behavior that remains a\nchallenge for health care systems because of its detrimental\neffects on patient treatment and outcomes.3-5 However,\nappointment adherence has received little attention as a\nbehavioral issue, compared with, for example, treatment\nadherence, or immunization uptake.42\nThis study examined whether an intervention implement-\ning fees for unscheduled visits would result in improving\nappointment adherence. Although reducing visits without\nappointments has been an objective of the intervention, the\nultimate aim is to increase the rate of appointment adher-\nence. The study found that the mean percentage of visits\nwithout appointments decreased significantly from 30.61%\nto 18.78%, and that the mean percentage of the no-show rate\nintervention. In addition, our results demonstrated that both\nvisits with appointments and attended appointments have\nimproved after introducing the new intervention.\nAlthough there are a number of other interventions that\nhave been shown to decrease the rates of no-show behavior,\nthese interventions may have limited impact and lead to\nTable 2.

For instance, overbooking and\nopen-access policies might increase the risk of overloading\nthe schedules of health care providers, which requires careful\nobservation and management, and accurate prediction of\ndemand.24,43 In addition, many previously discussed inter-\nventions have only been used in research studies, and have\nnot necessarily been applied in health care facilities, or used\nNonetheless, the effectiveness of using financial incen-\ntives (rewards/penalties) in changing individual behavior has\nbeen theoretically substantiated and empirically supported in\ndifferent health care settings.46,47 In a recent study, Kubanek\net al38 tried to address whether Thorndike's law of effect is\nsymmetric or qualitatively distinct in regard to monetary rein-\nforcement and punishment. They found that reinforcement\nand punishment play a distinct role in guiding individual\nTable 3.

Punitive policies might be effective in reducing the\nno-show rate but are difficult to implement and can affect\naccess to health care service, particularly among those\npatients with limited income.17 Also, it might be unfair to\ncharge those who had inevitable reason for not attending.2,13,48\nIn their qualitative study, Martin et al20 argue that imposing\nfinancial penalties would have some effect in reducing missed\nappointments but would not be significant; furthermore, it\nmight be not acceptable to providers to fine nonattending\npatients. In addition, such policies might encourage patients\nto cancel or reschedule their appointments.49\nInstead of fining those patients who missed their scheduled\nappointment, KAUH introduced the \"service fees\" as a nega-\ntive reinforce to those who want visits without appointments.\nTable 4.

They are more attentive\nto their health, and have enough free time compared with\nyoung adults.26 Moreover, and in accordance with several\nprevious studies,14-16 this study showed that male patients\nwere more likely to no-show to their appointments before\nand after the intervention, though this has not been found\nconsistently.1,50,51 Some previous studies also indicated that\nbeing married is associated with a low no-show rate,1,17 while\nwe found that single patients were more likely to attend their\nappointments. Singles usually have less family commitments\nand it is easier for them to manage their time. Interestingly,\nhaving full insurance coverage was found to be significantly\nassociated with a tendency to attend appointments. A possi-\nble explanation is that most patients with 0% copayment had\ngovernment insurance and were referred from other govern-\nment hospitals, or they had full insurance coverage from the\nRoyal Court or from other agencies. However, in both cases,\nfull coverage is usually time limited. So, such patients try to\nenjoy the greatest possible benefits, especially as most of the\npatients are from lower income families.\nFinally, there are other patient characteristics and predis-\nposing factors that have been identified in previous studies as\npotential influences on patient adherence to prescheduled\nappointments including health status, income, and race and\nethnicity.1,52 However, as most inhabitants in Jordan are\nArabs, Jordanian ethnicity and culture are characterized by\nuniformity and there are no racial and ethnic differences in\nTable 5.

Chronic dis-\nease patients might be more apt to attend their appointments\nthan patients with acute illnesses, because patients with\nchronic diseases usually have a good relationship with their\ncaregivers, and they are more compliant with their treatment\nplan.1,17 In addition, the severity of health conditions might\nbe associated with adherence to appointments; for instance,\nit has been shown that more ill patients are less likely to miss\ntheir appointments.1,17 Therefore, it is worthy to consider and\nexamine the effect of these factors in future works to predict\nand improve appointment adherence.\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates the ability of negative reinforce-\nment to modify patient behavior and increase patient\nappointment adherence rates. Appointment adherence\nenhances the efficacy of health services. Besides using the\nscheduled appointment to provide adequate and timely\npatient care, health care settings maximize the utilization of\nexisting resources. The study also highlights that develop-\ning an effective and socially appropriate intervention that\ncould improve appointment attendance requires a clear\nexplanation of the impact of such interventions from theo-\nretical perspectives. Hence, health managers and policy\nmakers need to consider evidence and theory-based inter-\nventions that go beyond merely the managerial practical\nissues. Further studies should focus on the empirical link\nbetween theory and practice in governing patient adherence\nbehavior. Finally, we expect that visits without appoint-\nments and no-show rates could be further reduced than our\nreported results if the intervention is continued, as the cur-\nrent study examined impact only in the first 6 months of\nimplementation.\n"
