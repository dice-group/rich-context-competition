    "abstract": "Abstract\nVerbal and non-verbal interactions that occur daily between teachers and headteachers, teachers and pupils, and among\npupils can generate conflict that may adversely affect teaching, learning, and schooling effectiveness. Little attention is,\nhowever, paid to the quality of relationships that exists between teachers and pupils, among teachers, among pupils, between\nteachers and their school heads, and between schools and their local communities. This study sought to investigate conflict\nprevalence in Ghana's primary schools, and how relationship conflict is understood to affect teaching and learning at the level\nof headteachers as administrators, teachers as classroom managers, and pupils as learners, and direct beneficiaries of primary\neducation. Using data gathered via interview, questionnaire administration, and observation in 30 public primary schools in\n10 circuits of one district of Ashanti Region, the findings revealed a high prevalence of fighting, heckling, bullying, and other\nforms of relationship conflict among pupils; strained teacher\u00adpupil relations due to insolence, indiscipline, and use of offensive\nlanguage; and teacher\u00adparent arguments and quarrels due to harsh punishment and verbal assault of pupils. Teacher\u00adpupil\nconflicts may extend to teachers excluding the affected pupils from teaching and learning activities, denying them the rights to\nask and answer questions, and have their class exercises marked, leading to lowered pupil self-esteem, reduced concentration\nduring lessons, and passive involvement in learning activities, which could result in truancy and school dropout. Strengthening\nguidance mechanisms and encouraging peer mediation could significantly curb conflict in school environments and thereby\nraise educational standards in the district.\n",

Conflict occurs between\npeople in all kinds of human relationships and in all social\nsettings. Because any aspect of living or working together\ncontains the seed of situational conflict, relationship con-\nflicts can occur between family members, friends, and staff\nin an organization (Tizard, Blatchford, & Burke, 2000).\nConflict inherently involves some struggle, incompatibility,\nor perceived differences in values, goals, or desires; charac-\nteristics, beliefs, and lifestyles; and power of influence and\naction between two or more parties in a relationship, com-\nbined with attempts to control each other and antagonistic\nfeelings toward each other (Hart, 2002; Ivancevich &\nHeit, & Page, 2005). The incompatibility or difference may\nexist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties\ninvolved. Nonetheless, opposing actions and hostile emo-\ntions are very real hallmarks of human conflict (Deutsch &\nColeman, 2000). This happens because people's values and\nneeds have been shaped by different socialization processes\nthat depend on differing cultural and family traditions, levels\nof education, breadths of experience, and lifestyles, which\nmake individuals see the world differently (Ivancevich &\n1Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology, Kumasi, Ghana\n2Asante-Akim District Assembly, Konongo, Ghana\nCorresponding Author:\nNana Afia Amponsaa Opoku-Asare, Department of Art Education,\nCollege of Art & Social Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science\n& Technology, Kumasi OR38, Ghana.\nEmail: afia_asare@yahoo.co.uk\nConflict Prevalence in Primary School and\nHow It Is Understood to Affect Teaching\nand Learning in Ghana\nNana Afia Amponsaa Opoku-Asare1, Harriet Takyi1,\nand Margaret Owusu-Mensah2\n Keywords\nrelationship conflict, interaction, teaching, primary school, Ghana\n2 SAGE Open\nIndividual differences add pleasure and richness to life,\nbut they can also create conflict (Covey, 2002). Disagreement\nbetween people or choices can arise whenever the perceived\ninterests of an individual or a group clash with those of\nanother individual or a group in such a way that strong emo-\ntions are aroused and compromise is not considered to be an\noption (Meeks et al., 2005). Similarly, power can also gener-\nate conflict where an individual or a group tries to influence\nor exert power to get another person or group to agree with an\nentrenched position (L. Larson & Mildred, 2002). Conflict\nmay not only take a toll on the physical body but it often\noccupies the mind and causes a great deal of emotional stress;\nconflict behavior does not only affect those involved, but it\nmay even extend to those who have no part in it (Hart, 2002).\nConflict also has the potential for either a great deal of\ndestruction or much creativity and positive social change, and\nfor positive change and innovation (Owens, 2001; Robbins,\n2000). It is essential therefore to understand the basic pro-\ncesses of conflict so that we can work to maximize productive\noutcomes and minimize destructive ones (Kriesberg, 1998, as\ncited in L\u00f2pez Fern\u00e1ndez-Cao et al., 2010).\nConflict and Education\nConflict in the school environment can have adverse effects\non the academic environment, including affecting the morale\nof educators, the pace at which they work, and increasing\nabsenteeism (Jennings & Wattam, 2004). Unless colleagues\nunderstand personal differences and accept each other's\npoint of view, needs, priorities, and approach to work and\nproblem solving (Robbins, 2000), conflict will occur. In\nschools, conflict usually occurs between headteachers and\nteachers, teachers and teachers, teachers and pupils, teachers\nand parents, pupils and pupils, and schools and their com-\nmunity (Siann & Ugwuegbu, 2000; Whetten & Cameron,\n2005). The quality of relationships between teachers and\ntheir pupils is critical because it affects how well a student\nadjusts in the school environment (Pianta & Stuhlman,\n2004). This notion is emphasized by the finding that children\nwho experience teacher\u00adstudent relationships with conflict\nin first grade demonstrated lower achievement in mathemat-\nics over the following 2 years (Buyse, Verschueren,\nVerachtert, & Van Damme, 2009, as cited in R. Larson,\n2012). Good interpersonal relationships in the school situa-\ntion, which include how well teachers relate with pupils, how\nteachers relate with each other, how the school relates to the\npupils'parents or guardians and to the community as a whole,\nare recommended (Kyriacou, 1999) because they promote\neffective teaching, learning, and school administration\nMethod\nThis study adopted a combination of qualitative and quanti-\ntative research methods (Leedy & Ormrod, 2005) with\ninterview, observation, and questionnaire administration to\ninvestigate conflict behavior in 30 public primary schools\nlocated in 10 different educational circuits in one district of\nAshanti Region, Ghana. The focus was on how interpersonal\nconflict is understood at the level of headteachers as admin-\nistrators, teachers as classroom managers, and pupils as\nlearners and direct beneficiaries of primary education, and\nperceived to affect teaching and learning. Data were sought\n57 boys) across the 30 schools. The pupils were randomly\nselected from the six class levels with the assistance of the\nheadteachers because only three (or 10%) of them returned\nthe questionnaire that was initially administered. Observation\nof classroom and playground activities by the authors also\nprovided additional data for the study. The interviews, ques-\ntionnaire administration, and observation were done concur-\nrently over 52 school days.\nFocus-group interviewing was adopted with the 130 pupils\nbecause while negotiating access to the schools, it was real-\nized that many of the pupils could neither read nor understand\nspoken English well. As a cost-effective way of investigating\nthe underlying meanings that inform the perceptions of peo-\nple about certain issues (Robinson, 1999), focus-group inter-\nviewing in Twi, the local language, provided opportunity for\nthe pupils to articulate their experiences of conflicts. The\npupils' language deficiency confirms Sellers's (2007) finding\nthat, in practice, teachers in some areas of Ghana use the local\nlanguage in instruction because pupils at primary school are\nnot proficient enough in the English language. Adopting Twi\nin this face-to-face verbal communication with the pupils\nresponds to the call for social researchers to pay attention to\nlocal languages to get to valuable data from the large number\nof illiterates in sub-Saharan Africa (King'ei, 2006).\nA 15-item questionnaire comprising both open- and\nclosed-ended questions meant to access the strengths in each\nform of method (Reja, Manfreda, Hlebec, & Vehovar, 2003)\nwas administered to 135 teachers. Questionnaire administra-\ntion made it easy to reach all the teachers within a short time\nand with less effort; the return rate was 88.9%. Besides, the\nresults of the piloted instrument revealed that the teachers\nwere more upbeat about answering the questionnaire than\nagreeing to be interviewed. Additional data were sought\nthrough direct observation (both participant and non-\nparticipant) of classroom and school activities to gain insight\ninto the natural occurrence of conflict in the schools and to\nalso validate data gathered from the questionnaire and inter-\nviews. This was done by sitting at the back of each class\nkeenly observing teaching and learning processes for two\ninstructional periods of 30 min in each school. This provided\nopportunity to scan the classroom environment for conflict\nincidents as the lessons went on in the participating teachers'\nclassrooms.\nOpoku-Asare et al. 3\nObservation was also done by moving around the school\ncompounds during the first and second break periods as the\npupils were engaged in different activities such as eating and\nplaying, to gather firsthand data on actual conflict situations\nas they occurred. These methods of triangulation helped to\nproduce a more thorough understanding of the phenomenon\nstudied and thereby improve the authenticity of the research\nDiscussion\nPrevalence of Conflicts\nThere was consensus among the teachers, headteachers, and\npupils in the sampled schools that disagreements and other\ntypes of relationship conflict occur among the pupils, among\nteachers, and between teachers and pupils, teachers and\nheadteachers, teachers and parents of pupils, and schools and\ntheir local communities. As to its prevalence, 99.2% (119) of\ndescribed conflict as a daily occurrence, particularly among\nthe pupils. This corroborates Siann and Ugwuegbu's (2000)\nfinding that relationship conflicts occur among these key\nplayers in the school system, all of which have direct nega-\ntive consequences for teaching, learning, and educational\nstandards. This is despite efforts made by the headteachers\nand guidance and counseling committees to apply existing\nconflict resolution guidelines to deal with disagreements,\nquarrels, fights, and other relationship conflicts that erupt in\nthe schools. The study however, points to the established\nconflict resolution structures being ineffective for resolving\nrelationship conflicts that occur among personnel who func-\ntion in the school environment, which calls for further\nresearch into Ghana's policy and procedure for conflict man-\nagement in the basic school system.\nForms of Conflict\nConflicts that were identified in the schools manifested as\nquarreling, fighting, yelling, heckling, confrontation out of\nanger, jostling, and bullying among the pupils; verbal abuse,\ncaning, and excessive punishment meted to pupils by teach-\ners; angry teachers and parents quarreling or exchanging\nharsh words and insults; angry parents chasing their children\nto school to punish them or report offenses caused at home to\nget them punished; as well as heated arguments, quarrels,\nand strong disagreements between headteachers and\nteachers.\nPupils' Perceptions of Conflict\nInterviews with the 130 pupils revealed four types of rela-\ntionship conflict that frequently occur in the sampled schools:\n82 (representing 63.1%) of them reported pupil\u00adpupil con-\n(or 7.6%) pupils identified teacher\u00adparent conflicts, while 17\n(or 13.1%) of them cited pupil\u00adparent conflicts. The data\nshow pupil\u00adpupil conflicts as the most rampant relationship\nproblem prevalent in the 30 sampled schools. Table 1 pro-\nvides the factors that are perceived to cause these types of\nconflicts.\nAs Table 1 indicates, the pupils pointed out teasing, gos-\nsiping, trickery, and jealousy as the significant factors that\ngenerate the most relationship conflicts among them. Further\nprobing revealed that most quarrels, insults, and fighting\nemerge from pupils teasing each other because they are too\ntall or short, too fat or thin, or they are unable to answer\nquestions in class. Bullying of younger pupils by the older\nones both on the playground and on the way home from\nschool, jealousy over unequal personal resources, and steal-\ning of other pupils' pocket money, erasers, and writing mate-\nrials also feature prominently as sources of friction, tension,\nand fights among the pupils.\nThe pupils attributed conflicts that occur between teach-\ners and pupils to teachers venting anger with their parents on\nthem; teachers punishing pupils who steal, fight, or use abu-\nsive language; and pupils who gossip over suspected amo-\nrous relationships between male teachers and the older\nfemale pupils that they are too afraid to talk openly about.\nThey also ascribed conflicts that occur between teachers and\nparents to teachers insulting their parents for the pupils'\nwrongdoings, which often get reported at home and cause\nparents to retaliate; teachers being too harsh on pupils; teach-\ners punishing pupils with excessive weeding on the school\nfarm; and harassment over unpaid fees and levies. Last,\npupils reported that conflict between pupils and parents arise\nfrom angry parents following their children to school either\nto punish them for disobedience, theft, or misbehavior at\nhome, or reporting such offenses to get them punished by\ntheir teachers. It is important to indicate that at some points\nof the focus group conversation, some of the pupils expressed\ngrave concern over unsavory comments some of their teach-\ners make when they have difficulty understanding what is\ntaught.\nThe most unpleasant comments were made by pupils\nwhose teachers often insult their parents over their mistakes,\nconduct, or learning difficulties. Expressions of disgust were\nobvious from interjections such as, \"Why should my teacher\ninsult my mother who is at home when I am the one in the\nTable 1.

Although many of the pupils' reports\nattract strong conflict behaviors and responses, many of the\npupils' parents ignore their children's negative reports. This\nhowever, does not negate the fact that teacher\u00adparent con-\nflicts exist in the sampled communities.\nThe variety of responses that emerged from the pupil\ninterviews show the importance pupils attach to both family\nand school ties; they cherish both home and school relation-\nships. The emotional attachment with their mothers, the\npupils said, makes it difficult for them to refrain from dis-\nclosing embarrassing and hurtful incidents that occur in\nschool to them. Essentially, if a teacher insults a pupil's par-\nents for the child's wrongdoing in school, the pupils con-\ncerned felt obliged to respond the best way, which is to report\nthe insult or incident to their parents for redress.\nEffects of Conflict on Teaching and\nLearning\nTeacher\u00adPupil Conflict\nAccording to the pupils, if a conflict emerges between a\nteacher and a pupil or pupils and it is resolved, some teachers\nrefuse to let go of the issue but use it as a weapon to punish\nthe offending pupil by relating poorly with them. This makes\nthe affected pupil unhappy, embarrassed, and uncomfortable\nin the teacher's presence both inside and outside the class-\nroom. Even after conflicts have been settled, the pupils reit-\nerated that \"some teachers keep on making references to\nwhatever caused the conflict they had had with the pupils\neven during lessons, which causes us much embarrassment\nand makes us want to run away from the presence of our\nclassmates.\" In some situations, it was reported that a teacher\ncould hate the offending pupil to the extent of refusing to\nmark exercises those pupils present in class, refusing to call\non those pupils to answer questions they ask during lessons,\nand more irritatingly, refusing to call on such pupils who\ndare to raise their hands either to ask or answer questions, or\nthey simply ignore them in all class activities. The apt\nresponse to such a situation was, \"This hurts so much you\ndon't want to come to school the next day if your friends\ndon't come to get you,\" which portends the possibility of\npupils dropping out of school if this denial persists.\nThe pupils intimated that when their teachers deny them\nthese rights in class, they feel awkward in the midst of their\npeers, which also adversely affects their ability to learn.\nAccording to the pupils, such conflict aftermath\nmakes it difficult for those pupils to assess their performance in\nclass; in this case, the timid pupil may decide to stay out of the\nteacher's way by not coming to school just to avoid that situation,\nand may eventually drop out of school if no one goes after them.\nThe pupils also made it clear that sometimes when a conflict\noccurs between a teacher and a pupil, other teachers join the\nfray, and in solidarity with their colleague, they also harass\nthe pupil in school. Such a pupil becomes very uncomfort-\nable in the school environment and cannot go to see their\nsiblings and friends in other classrooms. The implication is\nthat pupils in conflict with particular teachers could end up\nbeing unnecessarily punished by other teachers in their\nschool. This scenario runs contrary to the expectation that\nteachers would act in loco parentis (as surrogate parents) to\ntheir pupils and that this parenting role would compel pupils\nto replicate the feelings they have for their parents to their\nteachers (Orlich, Callahan, & Gibson, 2001).\nClose interactions between teachers and pupils should\nrather forge bonds of trust and mutual support between them\nso that the teachers could exert their influence to control the\nclassroom environment to significantly reduce tension and\nincrease the probability of successful learning and social\nprogress for their pupils (Orlich et al., 2001). After all, the\nEducation for All program implies children coming to school\nand enjoying the experience of learning, and developing\ntheir full potential through education to ensure their full and\nequal participation in building a better world (Oxfam, 2005).\nRelationship conflict is therefore a risk factor to consider as\nfar as Ghana's attainment of the Millennium Development\nGoal 2 of \"increased primary enrollment by 2015\" (Ministry\nof Education, Youth and Sports [MOEYS], 2004) is\nconcerned.\nThe sentiments the pupils expressed over the aftermath of\nconflicts that occur in the sampled schools corroborate Siann\nand Ugwuegbu's (2000) assertion that negative attitudes of\nteachers lower their pupils' self-esteem, which calls for\nOpoku-Asare et al. 5\nattention and intervention by education officials in the study\narea, especially where primary school teachers in Ghana are\nassigned to specific classes only and, as generalist classroom\npractitioners, also teach all subjects on the timetable (Boafo-\nAgyemang, 2010). Knowing that positive teacher\u00adchild rela-\ntionships serve as a protective factor for positive social and\nacademic development of children implies that tension may\nundermine the pupils' willingness to stay in school and\nachieve their educational and life goals (Rudasill & Rimm-\nIt is important to state here that the pupils' description of\nconflict occurrences and their effects on teaching and learn-\ning in the 30 schools were almost the same. Except for the\n6- to 10-year-old pupils who had few or no conflict stories to\nnarrate, the 12- to 13-year-olds were very vocal about the\nepisodes they had observed in their own classrooms or other\nclasses, and even mimicked the behavior of some of the\nteachers who had engaged in such confrontations. The narra-\ntions showed that interpersonal conflict is a regular feature in\nthe sampled schools and a great source of worry to the pupils\nwho also pointed out the threat of conflict on their educa-\ntional aspirations. Including conflict studies in teacher devel-\nopment programs would equip newly trained teachers in\nparticular with the basic knowledge to understand the effects\nof relationship conflicts and to also acquire some skills for\nconflict prevention and peace building in the schools.\nTeacher\u00adParent Conflict\nThe pupils reported that after some teachers have had a con-\nfrontation with a parent, those teachers displace their anger\non the children of those particular parents although they may\nhave played no role in it. This, the pupils said, adversely\naffects their absorbing capacity for the day. Another worry-\ning issue was that some teachers take delight in constantly\nmentioning the wrongdoings of parents during lessons just to\nspoil their day and embarrass them. What bothered the pupils\nmost was that those teachers waste instructional time just\nhammering on whatever a parent had done and, sometimes,\nthey insult those parents as well. The burning questions the\npupils kept asking were, \"Why should my teacher insult my\nparent at all in the classroom?\" and \"What wrong did they\ndo?\" Sincerely, a teacher who uses instructional time to fan a\nconflict would certainly not be able to complete the assigned\nsyllabus, which invariably has adverse effects on all the\npupils' ability to assimilate what is taught and, in the\nlong term, their academic achievement and educational\nopportunities.\nThe findings suggest that pupils in the district suffer\nunduly from the effects of \"made-in-the-community\" con-\nflicts that get carried into the classroom, which could prevent\nthe pupils from attaining the full benefits of schooling. The\nlevel of conflict occurrence also contradicts the expectation\nthat teachers would collaborate with parents to promote the\nsocial, emotional, and academic growth of their pupils to\nmotivate them to stay in school and complete their education\n(Orlich et al., 2001). Sour relationships between parents and\nteachers, the two key figures at the center of children's edu-\ncation, suggests inadequate interpersonal and conflict man-\nagement skills for dealing with issues of conflict in the study\narea. These significant adults in the children's lives may also\nnot be fully aware of the complementary role they play as far\nas the children's education is concerned. Besides, pupil\nachievement in primary school depends largely on teacher\ngoodwill (Boafo-Agyemang, 2010) and active monitoring of\nteaching effectiveness (Opoku-Asare, 2006); hence, achiev-\ning quality primary education must necessarily entail educa-\ntion officials focusing much attention on promoting good\ninterpersonal relationships in the schools.\nTeachers' Perceptions of Conflict\nUnderstanding of Conflict\nThe teacher is a very crucial element in attaining quality edu-\ncation. Achievement of the objectives of any curriculum\ndepends to a great extent on teachers who have a strong com-\nmitment to teaching so that they might be a source of inspira-\ntion to their pupils and effective facilitators of learning\n(Colker, 2008). The teachers' responses to the questionnaire\nrevealed three views of conflict: 108 (representing 90.0%) of\nthe 120 respondents defined conflict as \"a misunderstanding\nor disagreement between two or more people or groups of\npeople.\" This reflects the basic definition provided in the lit-\nerature, which shows that the large majority of the teachers\nunderstand what conflict means and could identify conflict\nsituations in the schools.\nNine (or 7.5%) of them defined conflict as \"a fight\nbetween two or more people,\" which suggests that this group\nof teachers could ignore early signs of conflict and would\nintervene only when it escalates into physical assault or vio-\nlence. These teachers could find it difficult to resolve conflict\nbecause they might not see it brewing as a serious matter or\na threatening situation at its early stages of development.\nBeing handicapped in conflict identification from the grass-\nroots puts the pupils of these teachers at risk if they should\nexperience any psychological problems that do not manifest\nas physical assault or overt actions.\nThe remaining three teachers defined conflict as \"a mere\nargument between two or more people.\" This view of con-\nflict suggests that these teachers would interpret any argu-\nment as an issue of conflict and address it as such. This\nperception could create unnecessary relationship problems\nwith their colleagues, pupils, and people they may come in\ncontact with on the basis that they could regard any expres-\nsion of ideas or merely arguing one's views out on an issue\nof mutual interest as a conflict. Consequently, lessons taught\nby these teachers might generate conflict where pupils or\nother teachers need to debate issues or express views that are\ndifferent from theirs.\n6 SAGE Open\nTypes of Conflicts Identified\nThe types of conflicts and the frequency of responses that\nhighlighted the respective conflicts in response to the ques-\ntionnaire are as follows: conflict among pupils (81 responses),\nconflict between teachers and parents (75 responses), con-\nflict between teachers and headteachers (63 responses), con-\nflict between teachers and pupils (45 responses), conflict\nbetween pupils and parents that gets carried into school (39\nresponses), conflict among teachers (34 responses), and con-\nflict between schools and their local communities (20\nresponses). Causal factors of these seven types of conflicts\nthe teachers identified are summarized in Table 2.\nPerceived Effects of Conflict on\nTeaching and Learning\nreported that conflicts that occur in their schools have direct\nnegative effects on teaching and learning. The remaining six\n(or 5%) respondents were of the view that conflict in their\nschools produce positive results on teaching and learning as\nthe teachers and pupils try to prove their point on issues of\nmutual interest and also bring out their values and personal\ndifferences in relation to work ethics. Similar to Whetten and\nCameron's (2005) assertion, these teachers believe conflict\ncan yield positive results to those involved. Pervasive con-\nflicts have both short- and long-term implications for educa-\ntional opportunities of children in Ghana. The high incidence\nof conflict among teachers and pupils in the sampled schools\ncould partly be attributed to the high population (55%) of\n20- to 30-year-old, less experienced teachers working with a\nfew (15%) elderly, more experienced, and soon-to-retire\nteachers aged 50 to 60 years old in the schools.\nThe senior teachers could serve as role models for the\nyounger teachers to emulate; they could also use their tradi-\ntional knowledge, class management experience, and skills\nin parenting to help the younger teachers deal with their rela-\ntionship problems so they can help to prevent conflict from\nemerging in the classroom. However, having a small popula-\ntion of experienced teachers in the schools implies insuffi-\ncient mentors for the younger teachers to turn to for advice in\ncase of difficulties, for ideas about how to address specific\nstudents' needs, or for insight in their subject areas. The sce-\nnario also suggests the schools have inadequate \"traditional\nelders\" to mediate or arbitrate \"made-in-the-community\"\nconflicts and prevent them from adversely affecting aca-\ndemic work and relationships in the schools.\nAll things being equal, the senior teachers could use their\n\"I-have-been-there-before\" experience (Opoku-Asare, 2000)\nto coach younger teachers posted to their schools to help\ntheir pupils resolve relationship and behavioral problems\nthey encounter, or even serve as arbitrators to mediate con-\nflicts that occur between individuals who function in the\nschool system.\nThese \"elders\" could also motivate their younger col-\nleagues to adopt more pragmatic strategies to help their\npupils to understand the need for maintaining healthy rela-\ntionships and promote peaceful school environments that\npromote quality living. Nonetheless, inadequate classroom\nmanagement skills among both sets of teachers could also\npush conflict and its management out of the limelight and\nthereby cause minor disagreements to escalate and destroy\nexisting peaceful relations in the schools. This notwithstand-\ning, opposing ideas, decisions, or actions relating directly to\nhow to curb conflict on the job, expression of different val-\nues and work practices, as well as individual personality dif-\nferences (Ivancevich & Matteson, 2002) could generate\nintragroup conflict between the older and younger genera-\ntion of teachers. The good thing, however, is that 54 (or 45%)\nof the 120 teachers were married, which implies having suf-\nficient numbers of \"mother\" and \"father\" figures for the\npupils to look up to for support in dealing with the issues of\nlife on a daily basis, and adequate numbers of adults with\nrelevant social and parenting skills to guide the pupils to\nhandle relationship problems amicably without resorting to\naggression, physical fights, or verbal assaults.\nNonetheless, as the pupil interviews revealed, some of the\nteachers have poor rapport with their pupils to the extent of\nrefusing to teach them or mark their class work, which cre-\nates opportunity for some pupils to drop out of school. The\nsituation clearly undermines teachers'position in loco paren-\ntis (Orlich et al., 2001) so that as role models, their pupils\nwould emulate their behavior to build good relationships and\nTable 2.

The many\nteacher\u00adpupil, teacher\u00adparent, and pupil\u00adpupil conflicts are\nsimply out of touch with effective schooling.\nThe remaining 6 of the 120 teacher respondents were of\nthe view that conflict in their schools produce positive results\non teaching and learning as the teachers and pupils try to\nprove their point (Whetten & Cameron, 2005) on issues of\nmutual interest, and the values that relate to their personal\ndifferences. The problem however, seems to hinge on adults\nin the schools being unable to deal with their own personal\ndifferences and thereby become role models for the pupils to\nemulate. Laxity in the practice of school supervision (Opoku-\nAsare, 2006) can contribute to high levels of interpersonal\nconflict in the schools.\nThe teachers' responses to the questionnaire revealed that\nwhen teachers and parents are in conflict, the teachers refuse\nto show love to the wards of those parents, which goes a long\nway to negatively affect the learning capacity of the pupils\nconcerned. In the same way teachers who get involved in\nconflict with their headteachers tend to feel awkward in\nschool, often becoming withdrawn or unwilling to teach, and\nif they do it at all, they do not put in much effort to deliver the\nlessons as they are expected to do. This reduced level of\nteacher productivity impinges directly on the quality of cur-\nriculum delivery, learning effectiveness, pupil academic\nachievement, and opportunity for secondary education. The\nsituation reflects Owens's (2001) view that conflict in\nthe school situation often develops into hostility that can take\nthe form of alienation, apathy, and indifference, which\ndirectly affects the quality of relationships and educational\nachievement for the pupils.\nThe questionnaire also revealed that pupils who get\ninvolved in conflict with teachers tend to have low concen-\ntration or even divided attention in class; instead of concen-\ntrating on what the teacher is teaching, their thoughts tend to\ndwell on the conflict and its repercussions, which takes their\nminds off the lessons and makes it difficult for them to absorb\nwhat is taught in class. Those pupils' thoughts tend also to\nget disturbed by the possible outcome of the conflict, which\ninvariably reduces their learning capacity and academic per-\nformance over time. If such a conflict is not resolved as early\nas possible, it may lead to overt and covert enmity between\nthe pupils and the teachers, which may increase the potential\nfor some pupils to become truants or even drop out of school.\nMoreover, the use of instructional periods to settle conflicts\nin the classroom leads to lost time for lessons, inability to\nadhere to timetables, how much of the syllabus will be cov-\nered and invariably, how much the pupils will learn.\nIt emerged from the interviews that where pupils in con-\nflict are in the same class, such pupils are reluctant to work\nin the same groups, and also refuse to respond to questions\nasked in class for fear of making mistakes and giving the\nother pupils a cause to laugh, tease, or make fun of them\noutside the classroom. These attitudes affect educational out-\ncomes negatively because their class teachers would not\nknow whether pupils who do not answer or ask questions\nhave understood the lessons or not. The Circuit Supervisors\nresponsible for the sampled district ought to pay regular vis-\nits to the schools, effectively monitor teaching and learning\nactivities, and help the headteachers, teachers, and pupils\nimplement existing conflict resolution structures and thereby\npromote a school culture of respect, harmony, collaboration,\nand peace to enhance productivity in the schools. They could\nalso implement alternative dispute resolution strategies to\nenable school personnel to deal effectively with the early\nwarning signs of conflict and how to mitigate their adverse\neffects from affecting teaching, learning, and the school\nenvironment.\nConfrontation poses a great threat to interpersonal rela-\ntionships in the school system, the pupils' education, and\nfuture livelihood; it also has dire consequences for Ghana's\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goal 2 of\nHeadteachers' Perspectives of Conflict\nOne of the fundamental administrative functions of the\nschool head is to continually reduce barriers and consolidate\nstrong relationships between the school and parents and the\ncommunity at large so as to harness community support and\nloyalty to improve teaching and learning, and thereby bring\nabout change in learner behavior. It is also the responsibility\nof headteachers to create, nurture, and maintain an environ-\nment that invites teachers and students to expend their effort\ninto teaching and learning, and to implement the curriculum,\nprograms, and policies of the Ghana Education Service\nConsequently, interviews were held with all the 30 head-\nteachers, which revealed the prevalence of persistent rela-\ntionship conflicts in their respective schools.\nIn identifying the types of conflicts experienced in the\nconflicts as the most rampant; two each cited teacher\u00adpupil\nand teacher\u00adheadteacher conflicts, respectively, while one\nmentioned conflicts that emerge between teachers and par-\nents. The headteachers intimated that any kind of conflict\nthat emerges in the school environment has direct conse-\nquences for teaching and learning, with 27 or 90% of them\nattesting that conflict also undermines school administration.\nThey conceded that headteachers find it very difficult to\nassign duties to teachers they are in conflict with, particu-\nlarly when a teacher is absent and one of them must step in to\nenable the pupils do profitable work for the day. They\nrecounted that where conflict arises between a teacher and a\npupil, the teacher usually stops teaching to address the con-\nflict; when conflict occurs between pupils of the same class\nduring teaching periods, their teachers also spend part of the\ninstructional periods settling the conflict, which wastes time.\nTable 3 summarizes the factors the headteachers attributed to\nconflicts that occur in their schools.\n8 SAGE Open\nAccording to the 30 headteachers, what makes the situa-\ntion worse is that primary school teachers in Ghana are gen-\neralist teachers who teach all the subjects on the primary\nschool timetable and are also assigned to one class of pupils\npupils who get into conflict with their teachers cannot benefit\nfully from what is taught in all the subjects that constitute the\nprimary curriculum. In some cases, the headteachers inti-\nmated that the pupils could convey distorted messages of\nsuch relationship conflicts in school to their friends at home\nand create unnecessary tension. In the worse situation,\noffended pupils could get their friends to assault the teachers\ninvolved. Eventually, a teacher could be transferred from a\nschool in which they have had problems, which ends up neg-\natively affecting the staffing situation in the school, particu-\nlarly rural schools to which many qualified teachers refuse to\naccept postings (The President's Committee on Review of\nEducation Reforms in Ghana Report, 2002).\nOn the contrary, 3 (10%) of the 30 headteachers reported\nduring the interviews that conflicts that occur in school can\nalso positively affect academic work and the individuals\ninvolved. They explained that conflict brings out individual\ndifferences in people and highlights the need for coopera-\ntion; if conflicts are amicably resolved and both parties are\nsatisfied, their productivity increases (Jennings & Wattam,\nflict aftermath could impact positively on teaching and learn-\ning. Nonetheless, the 90% affirmation of the adverse effects\nof conflict on schooling by the headteachers suggests that\nconflict poses more problems for classroom and administra-\ntive work than it yields any positive effects.\nObservation\nAlthough the questionnaire responses provided by the 120\nteachers and evidence from interviews with the 30 head-\nteachers and 130 pupils hinted the existence of different\ntypes of relationship conflicts in the schools, no significant\nteacher\u00adpupil and teacher\u00adteacher conflicts were observed in\nany of the 30 schools. It is possible that collegial responsibil-\nity to maintain cordiality among the teachers and mutual\nrespect that requires that personal differences should not\ninterfere with professional practice, particularly where \"out-\nsiders\" whose intention of visit they knew were present, was\nthe motivation for the teachers to behave civilly to each other\nduring the period of observation. It was obvious that the\nteachers simply acted unnaturally to avoid any conflict\noccurring between them and their pupils, suggesting that the\nteachers are better positioned to prevent others from driving\nthem into conflict. As adults, they are more likely to consider\nalternative strategies to deal with conflict situations they\nencounter, especially where \"strangers\" are present in their\nworking environment. Nonetheless, the high levels of con-\nflict that occurred among the pupils in class and at play sug-\ngest the pupils' lack of self-control and adequate numbers of\nrole models to show them the proper way to address their\ngrievances. The good thing is that children easily make up\nafter disagreements, and even after fighting, they quickly\nforget such disputes and resume their play.\nThe apparent absence of conflict occurrences between the\nsampled schools and their local communities suggests little\nor no interaction or peaceful co-existence between the\nschools and their communities. It is also possible that the\ntraditional leaders apply arbitration, mediation, and consen-\nsus building strategies to resolve conflicts that erupt between\nthe school and the communities. Unfortunately, this seeming\nharmonious co-existence does not reflect in the behavior of\nthe pupils who often resort to fighting, heckling, and other\nphysical forms of abuse to resolve their differences, particu-\nlarly on the playground and on their way home from school\nwhere no adult supervises them. The level of observed con-\nflicts on the playground could be attributed to the absence of\nteachers on supervisory duties (Owusu-Mensah, 2007).\nPervasive conflict among the pupils could also be a reflec-\ntion of the level of conflicts they encounter in their commu-\nnities, which they had learned as acceptable means of\nhandling disagreements.\nFew issues of teacher\u00adheadteacher conflicts were, how-\never, observed at staff meetings that were held in the head-\nteachers' offices in all 30 schools, to which the researchers\nwere invited. Conflicts also erupted between teachers and par-\nents, between headteachers and parents, and also between the\nheadteachers and Parent\u00adTeacher Association (PTA) officials\nat scheduled PTA meetings in 15 schools. The teacher\u00adparent\nTable 3.

Strong arguments and quarrels\noccurred between some headteachers and their schools' PTA\nofficials for lack of transparency in disbursing PTA funds\nand the government's Capitation Grant, which is meant for\nbasic schools to offset their recurrent expenditure.\nInterestingly, the researchers' presence in the schools did\nnot stop the PTA meetings or prevent the occurrence of\nintense disagreements and strong arguments because the\nagenda for those meetings were set long before the research-\ners negotiated access to the schools; the parents and officials\nconcerned were compelled to attend with no option to do\notherwise. Having \"outsiders\" at those meetings did not\nseem to matter as differences had to be resolved and misun-\nderstandings cleared; the people simply made every effort to\nmake their voices heard, and many did not mince words in\nexpressing how strongly they felt with the issues discussed.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nPrimary schools in the study district experience persistent\nconflict, which has direct adverse consequences for teaching\nand learning, whether it occurs between a teacher and a pupil\nor pupils, between a teacher and the head of a school, or\nbetween teachers and parents. Conflict between a teacher\nand headteacher can lead to a teacher's reluctance to provide\nquality teaching to their pupils and cause them to lose out on\nwhat they should gain from the curriculum. School\u00ad\ncommunity conflict can also slow down the cordial relation-\nship between school authorities and the communities. The\nstate of affairs in the study area points to laxity in the practice\nperhaps also accounts for ineffective curriculum delivery,\nlow pupil achievement, and lowered standard of education in\nThe idea is that when schools, families, and communities\nwork together to support learning, pupils tend to do better in\nschool, stay longer in school, and show greater commitment\nIt is necessary therefore that the district education office\ntakes steps to improve the leadership skills and managerial\neffectiveness of the headteachers to enable them to build\npositive working relations with their staff so that they can\nliaise to curb conflict occurrence in the schools and promote\nacademic productivity.\nKnowing that conflict in primary schools, irrespective of\nthe type, affects the pupils' education, and having found that\nconflict between pupils occurs every day in the sampled pri-\nmary schools suggest the urgent need to adopt measures to\neducate schools in the district on conflict and its negative\nimpacts on their academic performance. Resolving these\nissues will improve peace building and ease tension between\nthe key players in the education enterprise. The level and\nnature of conflicts experienced in the schools also suggests\nthat the School Management Committees and PTA officials\nare not visiting the schools regularly to monitor the perfor-\nmance of pupils and to help in solving school problems\nDistrict level checks to monitor supervisors' performance in\nensuring quality standards in the district could detect ten-\nsions that militate against teacher efficiency and pupil learn-\ning, and thus help enhance the educational experience for\nthe pupils. These are issues that directly affect relationships\nand make it difficult for effective teaching and learning to\ngo on.\nIt is important also that school authorities complement\npupils' good behaviors and reward them somehow to encour-\nage them to continue to behave well in school. Instituting peer\nmediation teams comprising well-behaved pupils and equip-\nping them with conflict resolution skills would enable these\nrole models to help their schools handle interpersonal conflict\nmore effectively. This group could be trained periodically by\nthe district education office, civil society, or any community\nbased or non-governmental organization, which is interested\nin conflict management so that schools in the district would\nhave relatively reduced conflict environments. It is also neces-\nsary for pupils to be educated on existing conflict resolution\nmechanisms in the schools and the associated sanctions for\noffenses.\nConflict resolution bodies such as the Disciplinary, and\nGuidance and Counselling Committees in the schools\nUmude, 2012) should be strengthened to enable them to edu-\ncate the pupils on better ways of handling conflict to promote\ngood neighborliness among the pupils and thereby curb\nintractable issues of conflict and create an enabling environ-\nment for teaching and learning to occur in the schools.\nInstituting peer mediation teams and peace clubs with pupils\nwho are disciplined and well behaved could help the schools\nmanage relationship conflicts. Further research on conflict in\nGhanaian schools would identify effective intervention strat-\negies that would be appropriate for minimizing or curbing\nconflicts that occur in the schools.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAddae-Boahen, A., & Arkorful, C.
