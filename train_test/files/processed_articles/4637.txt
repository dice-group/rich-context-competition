Correlations between PHPT1 expression and demographic and\nclinical characteristics were analysed prospectively.\nResults: In total, 122 patients (78 male/44 female) were included. In normal kidney tissue, PHPT1\nexpression was observed only in the proximal tubule. High PHPT1 expression levels were\nassociated with larger tumour size, higher Fuhrman nuclear grade and advanced pathological\ntumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis (pTNM) stage compared with low PHPT1 expression levels. Patients\nwith low PHPT1 expression showed better overall survival and progression-free survival compared\nwith those with high PHPT1 expression. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that nuclear grade\nand pTNM stage were independent predictors of progression-free survival and overall survival in\npatients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. PHPT1 expression was also an independent predictor\nof overall survival but not progression-free survival.\nConclusions: PHPT1 was expressed in the epithelium of proximal tubuli and nuclei of clear-cell\nrenal cell carcinoma tissue samples. High levels of 14 kDa phosphohistidine phosphatase protein\nwere negatively associated with overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with\nclear-cell renal cell carcinoma.\n",

Mutational inactivation of von\nHippel\u00adLindau disease tumour suppressor\nprotein in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma is\nthought to be one of the molecular fac-\ntors underlying this disease.3 For example,\nabnormal expression of von Hippel\u00adLindau\ndisease tumour suppressor, E3 ubiquitin\nprotein ligase (VHL) gene will result in\nupregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor\n1-a and lead to epidermal growth factor\nreceptor signalling,4 which will further acti-\nvate Raf serine/threonine kinase isoforms\n(e.g. Raf-1 and B-Raf) and increase cell\nproliferation and survival.5 Abnormal\nexpression of VHL can indirectly stimulate\nangiogenesis by increasing the production of\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\nand platelet-derived growth factor, which\nare substrates of receptor tyrosine phos-\nphorylation.4,6 All of these factors promote\nthe metastasis of renal cell carcinoma,4,6 and\ntargeted therapy aimed at regulating abnor-\nmal serine/threonine or tyrosine phosphor-\nylation has been a crucial turning point in\nthe treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer.\nMany active drugs target neoplastic neo-\nangiogenesis by directly blocking VEGF\n(e.g. bevacizumab),7\u00ad9 or its receptor (e.g.\ntyrosine-kinase inhibitors).10\u00ad13 Some tar-\ngeted drugs have significantly improved the\nprognosis patients with of renal cell\nPhosphohistidine is widely used in\nsignal transduction activity of the eukary-\notic cells, and accounts for 6% of the\nprotein-bound phosphate.16 The function\nof phosphohistidine in eukaryotes is little\nstudied, however, compared with serine/\nthreonine and tyrosine phosphorylation.\nAnalysis of the molecular structure of\nphosphohistidine has shown that the phos-\nphoramidate bond in phosphohistidine at\nthe 1-N and 3-N positions of the imidazole\nring is different from the phosphoester bond\nin phosphohydroxyamino acids. Moreover,\nthe N-bound phosphate of phosphohistidine\nis very labile under acidic conditions.17,18\nResearch in the field of phosphohistidine\nphosphorylation has, therefore, been ham-\npered by difficulties in analysis and detection\nof phosphohistidine under the often very\nacidic conditions during which protein char-\nThe present study aimed to explore the\nclinical significance of phosphohistidine\nphosphatase 1 (PHPT1) expression in\nclear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Expression\nof PHPT1 in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma\nwas examined using an immunohistochem-\nical approach to determine 14 kDa phos-\nphohistidine phosphatase (PHPT1) protein\nlevels; correlations between PHPT1 expres-\nsion and clinicopathological features and\nprognostic factors in clear-cell renal cell\ncarcinoma were investigated.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and clinicopathological\ndata\nIn this prospective observational study,\npatients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma\nwho underwent radical or nephron-sparing\nnephrectomy at Beijing Friendship\nHospital, Capital Medical University,\nBeijing, China were sequentially enrolled\n2012. Clinical records, imaging data and\nhistopathological features were fully docu-\nmented. Prior to data analyses, each\nclear-cell renal cell carcinoma sample was\nre-evaluated with regard to the carcinoma\ntype, tumour stage and nuclear grade.\nTumour staging was redefined according to\nclassification system by reviewing imaging\ndata and slides.14 Nuclear grading was\nreassigned according to the Fuhrman\nsystem by two independent pathologists.21,22\nRecurrence or metastasis of renal cell car-\ncinoma was determined according to clinical\nand radiographic findings. Disease-related\ndeaths were identified by reviewing the\nmedical records.\nInclusion criteria comprised patients\ndiagnosed with clear-cell renal cell carcin-\noma. Patients receiving chemotherapy or\nradiotherapy following surgery, or who were\ndiagnosed with clear-cell renal cell carcin-\noma (in addition to other types of renal cell\ncarcinoma) were excluded. The follow-up\nperiod was defined as the time from surgery\nto time of death or time of last recorded\nclinical data.\nThe present study was approved by the\nBeijing Friendship Hospital, Capital\nMedical University ethics review committee,\nand written informed consent was obtained\nfrom all participants.\nSample collection and processing\nTumourtissue samples were collected from\neach patient during surgery to remove the\nclear-cell renal cell carcinoma. During this\nsurgery, healthy tissue samples were also\nobtained from each patient from an area\n2 cm from the tumour tissue. All samples\nwere fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-\nAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in 100 mM\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.5),\nand embedded in standard paraffin\nwax. Tissue sections were cut to 6-mm\nthickness and stored at 4C. Haematoxylin\nand eosin stain was used to visualize tissue\nsections.\nTissue samples and\nimmunohistochemistry\nParaffin-wax sections were deparaffinized\nwith xylene and rehydrated in decreasing\nconcentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval\nwas performed by heating the sections in an\nantigen retrieval buffer (1 \u00c2 citric acid buffer\nsolution, pH 6.0 [Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,\nChina]) in a microwave oven (model\nMYZH931, Kaixiu Trade, Guangzhou,\nperoxidase activity was blocked using 3%\nfor 10 min at room temperature, fol-\nlowed by blocking of endogenous biotin\nenzyme with normal goat serum for 30 min\nat room temperature. Sections were then\nincubated with a 1 : 40 dilution of polyclonal\nrabbit anti-PHPT1 primary antibody\nnight at 4C, washed three times with 0.01M\nPBS (pH 7.4), followed by incubation with a\n1:500 dilution of mouse antirabbit horse-\nradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-\nbody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at room\ntemperature for 60 min. Sections were\nthen washed again three times in PBS.\nImmunostaining was visualized using a\nhorseradish catalase diaminobenzidine\ncolour kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,\nChina), and the sections were counter-\nstained with haematoxylin. For negative\nplace of the primary antibody.\nTissue sections were observed at\n200 \u00c2 magnification using an Olympus\nmicroscope (Olympus, Japan). A total of\nthree sections were analysed per patient,\nwith 15 fields of view captured for each\nsection. Positive stained cells and total cells\nwere counted in each field. For each patient,\nthe percentage of positive cells was calcu-\nlated as the mean of three sections (15 fields\nper section). Expression of PHPT1 was\nclassified into four grades determined by\nthe percentage of positive cells in the tumour\nsection as follows: grade 1, 5% positive\ncells; grade 2, 6%\u00ad25% positive cells; grade\npositive cells. Grade 1 and 2 tumours were\nconsidered to have low PHPT1 protein\nlevels (negative); grade 3 and 4 tumours\nwere considered to have high PHPT1 pro-\ntein levels (positive).\nStatistical analyses\nMeasurement data were presented as mean \u00c6\nSD and statistical analyses were performed\nusing SPSS\u00d5, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA) for Windows\u00d5. Clinico\npathological data were compared between\npatients with PHPT1-positive and PHPT1-\nnegative tumours. To verify the association\nbetween categorical variables, 2-test was\nperformed. Student's t-test for independent\nsamples was used, to analyse continuous\nvariables. Prognostic single factor analysis\nwas performed using Kaplan\u00adMeier curves\nand the log-rank test to determine between-\ncurve differences. The Cox proportional haz-\nards model was employed in multiple fac-\ntor analysis.

The mechanisms by\nwhich PHPT1 promotes tumour invasion\nand metastasis remain unclear.
