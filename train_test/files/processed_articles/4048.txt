Aside from a small number of recent, conflicting studies, the literature gap on\nthis key issue remains. The present study examines the 54,094 homicide deaths, including 41,123 gun homicides, victimizing\nCalifornia residents ages 15 to 69 during 1991 to 2012 by poverty status. Without controlling for poverty, homicide rates\ndisplay the traditional age-curve peaking at 19, then declining. When poverty is controlled, the traditional age-curve persists\nonly for high-poverty populations, in which young people are vastly over-represented, and homicide rates are elevated for all\nages. This finding reiterates that \"adolescent risk taking\" may be an artifact of failing to control for age-divergent SES.\n",

The evidence for the claim that\n\"adolescent risk\" is an artifact of adolescent poverty is\nstraightforward: Where subjected to the same economic dis-\nadvantages, as teenagers are on average, middle-aged adults\n(thought to be a mature, risk-averse demographic) display\nhigher \"teenaged\" outcomes with respect to such \"adolescent\nrisks\" as serious crime, violent crime, firearms mortality, and\nfatal traffic crashes. Conversely, where teenagers enjoy the\nsame advantaged economic conditions as the average mid-\ndle-aged adults, teenagers display \"middle-aged\" outcomes\nThese studies do not make any inferences about individual\nrisk taking; their focus is on populations.\nAlthough these studies have proven controversial, the lit-\nerature disputing their findings is very sparse. Virtually all\nstudies that have advanced traditional assertions of adoles-\ncent versus adult risks have failed to control for inter-age\ndisparities in SES; other studies have controlled only for race\nor geography or examined only a single young cohort. Such\nlimited methods are insufficient to sustain conclusions about\nadolescent risk taking. Exhaustive literature searches by the\nauthors and by other researchers have revealed only one\nother study of the interaction of age and economic disadvan-\ntage in predicting risk taking: Shulman et al. (2013a),\nSteinberg, and Piquero's (2013) analysis of National\nLongitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data that finds no\nage\u00adpoverty interaction for ages 12 to 23 in self-reported\noffending. However, this cohort study is limited in age range\nand fails to control for major confounds such as period\neffects, as will be discussed.\nThe absence of adolescent-versus-adult behavior studies\nthat incorporate comparative SES interactions is related to an\ninconsistency in theoretical treatment. When explaining even\nlarge discrepancies in behaviors between population groups,\nmodern theorists and researchers reject internal biological\n(i.e., neurological) and developmental (i.e., risk taking) traits\n1Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, San Francisco, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMike Males, Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, 40 Boardman Place,\nEmail: mmales@earthlink.net\nAge, Poverty, Homicide, and Gun\nHomicide: Is Young Age or Poverty Level\nthe Key Issue?\nMike Males1\n Keywords\nadolescents, age, risk taking, homicide, guns, development\n2 SAGE Open\nin favor of external sociological conditions (concentrated\npoverty, unemployment, discrimination, etc.; Gould, 1981).\nResearchers and theorists acknowledge the crucial nature of\nSES disparities when assessing behavior divergences\nbetween Adult Population A versus Adult Population B,\nAdolescent Population A versus Adolescent Population B,\nand every other comparative analysis--except Adolescent\nAge A versus Adult Age B. Researchers seem to assume that\nthe effects of SES disparity are inapplicable in only one\ninstance: when youth and adult behaviors are compared.\nThe failure to analyze divergent adolescent\u00adadult SES as\na determining factor in divergent adolescent\u00adadult behavior\nis compounded by the resurrection of long discredited bio-\ndeterminist notions. Recent small-subject functional mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies purportedly showing\nyouths use more primitive areas of the brain than adults in\ndecision-making have been interpreted as biological proof of\ninnate adolescent risk taking, sometimes generating extreme\nstatements. \"Adolescents, on average, engage in more reck-\nless behavior than do individuals of other ages\" and are \"bio-\nlogically driven\" to risk taking, including criminal offending,\ninterpretations are not warranted at this early stage of brain\ninvestigation and involve more prejudice than science, as\nevidenced by the fact that claims of greater adolescent risk\nare made even when fMRI findings show adolescents use\nmore sophisticated cortical reasoning than do adults (Baird,\nFugelsang, & Bennett, 2005). More recent, decisive reviews\nof multiple studies have found fMRI findings \"puzzlingly\"\noverstated (Vul, Harris, Winkielman, & Pashler, 2009, p.\n274) and have failed to replicate earlier fMRI claims (Boekel\net al., in press). As brain imagings do not demonstrate greater\nrisk-taking propensity in and of themselves, the theory of\nadolescent crime proneness remains founded in crime statis-\ntics whose age-discrepant external variables have not been\ncontrolled prior to assertions of age-discrepant internal\ndrivers.\nThis study attempts to fill this literature gap by extending\nthe previous analyses of age\u00adpoverty interactions to examine\none of the most serious forms of alleged \"adolescent risk tak-\ning\": homicides, especially by firearms. Both research and\npopular literature regularly depict homicide, especially gun\nkillings, as an adolescent and young adult risk behavior; one\nprominent team even dubbed these young ages as \"deadly\nBennett, DiIulio, & Walters, 1996; National Research\n1994). Even the nation's highest legal authority has depicted\nhomicide as a particular teenaged risk (Supreme Court of the\nBackground and Literature Review\nDecades of research have consistently upheld that poverty\nand related social disadvantage are key factors promoting\nTracy, & Brown, 2001), though they disagree as to the extent\nand mechanisms (Wright, Caspi, Moffitt, & Silva, 1999).\nThe lengthy, general literature reviews in previous studies\nnal behavior and reaffirming SES as a critical factor when\ncomparing differences in offending by population groups\nwill not be repeated here. Rather, the present review will\nextend these past literature reviews by adding the recent,\nsmall body of population and cohort studies that examine age\nand SES in the context of risk behaviors.\nThere appears little investigation of how poverty interacts\nwith age across the life span to produce theories of deviance\nand risk taking (Brown & Males, 2011; McCall, Land,\nappears no literature other than by Males and Brown that\nassesses the interaction of poverty, age, and risk behaviors\nfor ages above 24. The sparse literature on age\u00adpoverty inter-\nactions falls into two categories: population-level studies and\ncohort studies, each of which present advantages and weak-\nnesses. Cohort studies examine criminal offending longitudi-\nnally along a birth cohort as it ages. This vertical approach\nallows examination of trends within the cohort examined but\nis vulnerable to \"period effects\" in that its results are not gen-\neralizable to other cohorts that may display different patterns\nin different time periods. In contrast, population-level stud-\nies analyze offending rates horizontally across generations\nduring the same time period, a cross-sectional approach that\ncontrols for cohort effects but may not be generalizable to\nother time periods. It is difficult to apply cohort and popula-\ntion studies to test or refute each other because they use very\ndifferent assumptions and methods, although synthesizing\ntheir findings may prove useful.\nPopulation (Macro-Level) Studies\nStudy of the effects of personal, socio-economic, and other\nenvironmental factors on individual (micro-level) propensi-\nties to crime is supplemented by a literature that delineates\nmacro-level (population-wide) influences with strong pre-\ndictive values on the distribution of crime (Pratt & Cullen,\n2005). Both traditional macro-level theories, including insti-\ntutional anomie and social disorganization (Cancino, Varano,\nSchafer, & Enriquez, 2007), and more recent analyses (i.e.,\nSampson, 2012) have documented that community factors\npowerfully affect criminal behaviors and related social phe-\nnomena. One of the most \"stable and strongest predictors\" of\ncrime is the constellation of factors labeled as \"concentrated\nerty rate is a key measure. Individual-level and population-\nlevel theories are not mutually exclusive and may be\nintegrated in studies of the mediation of environmental fac-\ntors on individual behavior (Mufti, 2009).\nThree relevant population-level studies by the same\nauthors, Brown and Males (2011) and Males and Brown\nstatistics to conclude that adolescents' and young adults'\napparently elevated rates of felony crime, violent crime, and\ngun violence mortality are due to their low-SES relative to\nolder adults', not young age. The 2013 article, replicating\n2011 results, found that without controlling for SES, crime\nrates displayed the traditional age\u00adcrime curve, peaking in\nlate adolescence and early adulthood (Males & Brown,\n2013a). However, when poverty status was controlled by\nmeans of comparing crime rates among 906 population cells,\neach of which represented distinct age, race/ethnicity, county,\nand poverty values, the traditional age\u00adcrime curve largely\ndisappeared. Where middle-aged adults suffered high rates\nof poverty common to teenagers, they displayed higher\n\"teenage\" offending rates; where teenagers enjoyed low\nmiddle-aged poverty levels, they displayed lower middle-\naged crime rates. That is, \"adolescent risk taking\" is an arti-\nfact of failing to control for age-divergent SES. These studies\nsuggest that adolescents and young adults, like non-White\nraces, suffer higher rates of crime and arrest due to poverty\nand related economic disadvantages, not demographic char-\nacteristics such as age or race.\nHowever, these population-level studies have distinct\nlimitations. Owing to the difficulty of assembling complete,\ndetailed data sets by age, geography, and race and ethnicity\nover multiple years, these studies examined 1 year's cross-\nsections of crime, population, and poverty data for the state\nof California, a large and diverse geography that may not\ngeneralize to other locales. Multi-year data sets would allow\nfor control of cohort effects. Furthermore, population-level\nstudies examine demographic units and are not useful for\ndelineating individual risk.\nCohort Studies\nCohort studies also suffer from data limitations due to the\nlack of consistent, complete surveys and archival tabulations\nof representative populations over time. One recent study of\nan inner-city cohort found that \"neighborhoods explain a\nlarge percentage of individual-level disparities\"; in particu-\nlar, neighborhoods with high levels of concentrated disad-\nvantage as a result of entrenched poverty are especially\ncriminogenic (Sampson, Morenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005, p.\n6). Although \"the probability of violence accelerates in early\nadolescence for all groups [in the study], reaching a peak\nbetween the ages of 17 and 18 and then declining precipi-\ntously\" (Sampson et al., 2005, p. 4), the larger work casts\ndoubt on the theory that aging itself produces a spontaneous\ndesistance from crime. Rather, routine criminal offending\ndiminishes coincident with \"turning points\" that arise from\n\"opportunities,\" such as stable employment, marriage, or\nwealth accumulation, all of which are confounded with\nincreasing age (Laub & Sampson, 2003). Socio-economic\ndisadvantage appears to intensify and prolong \"crime-prone\nyears\" from adolescence well into adult ages (Phillips, 2006).\nConversely, cities with higher than average proportions of\neconomically and socially engaged young people had lower\nhomicide rates as the proportion of people aged 18 to 29 in\ntheir populations increased (Fabio, Tu, Loeber, & Cohen,\nThe only cohort study directly assessing the age\u00adpoverty\ninteraction appears to be one limited analysis of NLSY\nreported criminal offending by youths age 12 to 17 (collected\nin Wave 1 in 1996) declined sharply as that cohort aged into\nafter economic status was controlled. \"The age\u00adcrime curve\nin adolescence and early adulthood is not due to age differ-\nences in economic status,\" concluded Shulman et al. (2013a,\np. 848). Because this study was published explicitly to refute\nBrown and Males (2011, referred to as the \"subject study\" in\nthis subsection) and appears the only other study to incorpo-\nrate SES in addressing the age\u00adcrime curve, an extensive\nanalysis of Shulman et al. (2013, referred to as the \"counter-\nstudy\") is presented here.\nFirst, the counter-study authors' repeated claims to have\n\"tested\" and provided a \"strong rebuttal\" to Brown and\nMales (2011) is questionable. A cohort counter-study that\nuses an \"age range . . . restricted to adolescents and young\nadults\" ages 12 to 23 is insufficient to \"test\" statements in the\ncross-sectional subject study that encompassed ages 15 to\n69. Questions of whether \"poverty varies systematically with\nage,\" or that the counter-study's findings can be combined\nwith previous studies that do not control for SES to argue\nthat biological and developmental reasons explain why\n\"crime is in fact committed disproportionately by the young\"\nthe evidence presented.\nSecond, extensive re-analysis casts strong doubt as to\nwhat the counter-study (published 17 years after the baseline\nyear of the cohort it analyzed) actually found. Only some of\nthe major limitations and inconsistencies in the NLSY data\nbase were acknowledged in the counter-study. The acknowl-\nedged limitations include the problems that both those pro-\nviding SES information and the household configurations\nchanged substantially from NLSY Waves 1 (parents) to\nWaves 6 to 7 (young adults), and that differing proportions in\nthe three waves averaging around one fourth of the total sam-\nple provided no SES data. The counter-study's economic\nanalysis strongly depended on the authors' assumption that\nNLSY respondents know \"the gross household income (the\nsum of household members' wages, child support, invest-\nment income, rental income, retirement income, gifts, gov-\nernment support) for the prior year\" (Shulman et al., 2013a,\np. 852). This might generally be true for parents responding\nin Wave 1 but is much less likely to be accurate for young\nadults living with parents or roommates in Waves 6 to 7.\nHow many young adults know all sources of income of their\nparents or housemates? In fact, parents'self-reported income\n(using the R2 values) of the income status reported by young\n4 SAGE Open\nbetween income status in Waves 6 to 7, 1 year apart, is just\n.33; that is, most of those who were poor in 1996, or even in\nimplausibly weak correlations given the unlikeliness of sig-\nnificant income changes within the same (or somewhat the\nsame) set of individuals in such short periods. This indicates\nthe counter-study's estimates of SES by time period and age\nare not consistently obtained. Thus, the counter-study cannot\nbe shown to have presented crime rates by earlier (adoles-\ncent) and later (young adult) ages standardized to equivalent\nincome statuses over time, a flaw that would negate its\nconclusions.\nThe counter-study's unacknowledged limitations are\nequally troubling. These include the non-random dropout of\n7. As dropouts disproportionately displayed greater personal\nrisk factors than those retained in the survey (Aughinbaugh\n& Gardecki, 2007), a selection bias is created that may ren-\nder later waves less likely to commit crime than earlier\nwaves. This bias affects not just self-reports of crime but also\nthe counter-study's inconsistent measures of income status.\nThese limitations and biases, not uncommon in cohort sam-\nples such as NLSY, make this data set difficult to use to ana-\nlyze age, SES, and offending over time.\nThird, and also serious, is the conundrum of \"honestly\nreporting one's dishonesty,\" a validity threat generic to self-\nreporting surveys (see Lauritsen, 1998). The pattern found in\nthe counter-study could result either from a real decline in\noffending or from a decline in willingness to report socially\ndisapproved behaviors by age and over time. The suspicion\nthat adults under-report their crime is reinforced by Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) clearance reports showing\njuveniles are over-arrested; that is, they commit a substan-\ntially lower proportion of crimes than their arrest proportions\nwould predict. For example, youths under age 18 accounted\nfewer than half the youths arrested for homicide were ulti-\nmately charged with that offense. The American Civil\njuvenile arrests found 56.6% were not sustained; while these\nshowed up on official tabulations of arrests, probation offi-\ncers found no criminal activity meriting further action.\nSimilarly, public health statistics tied to a variety of\ncrimes, such as hospital emergency treatments and deaths\nfrom abusing illicit drugs, peak at ages well beyond teen\nyears. Taken together, independent measures indicate that\nthe self-report data the counter-study relies on is not conver-\ngent with official records. The authors' failure to present\nstrong literature findings of consistent self-reporting of\noffending across the life span is a critical omission. While\nthe subject study uses a data set (arrests) that is biased against\nits hypothesis that youth and adult crime rates equalize once\nSES is controlled, the counter-study's data set (self-reported\noffending) appears biased in favor of its hypothesis that ado-\nlescents commit more crime than do adults.\nFinally, due to admitted limitations and inconsistencies in\nthe NLSY, the counter-study by necessity used an out-of-date\ncohort that fails to capture major changes in youth and adult\noffending patterns--including dramatic weakening of the\nage\u00adcrime curve--in recent decades that have been particu-\narrest rates, particularly by younger ages, declined sharply\nter-study--and continued declining through 2013, the most\nrecent year available (Figure 1). In 1996, arrest rates peaked\nat age 18 and displayed the familiar age\u00adcrime curve. After a\nsubstantial decline in teenage crime rates and a lesser decline\nand the age\u00adcrime curve had weakened considerably. After\neven larger declines in crime among teenagers through 2013,\narrest rates peaked at age 21, and the age\u00adcrime curve all but\ndisappeared. Self-reported and victim-reported offending\nmeasures also show disproportionate declines in youthful\n2013a). The overall crime decline concentrated in young\nages easily accounts for the lower rate of self-reported\neffects from aging. The failure of the counter-study to include\na control series (which is not available in the NLSY) to adjust\nfor general changes in crime also risks negating its findings.\nAuthors further make no effort to control for \"college\npoverty,\" the temporarily low incomes of college students\nwho typically also have low crime rates, a major problem\ngiven the counter-study's limited, under-24 age range and\ninconsistent income measure. The \"college poverty\" issue\nwas acknowledged in the subject study but constituted less of\na problem because of that study's much broader age range.\nIn every case, the critical limitations and omissions of the\ncounter-study contribute to a pro-hypothesis bias. The advan-\ntage of the NLSY's potential to capture offenses not reported\nto police is more than offset by its limitations in terms of\nconfinement to a single, outdated, young cohort age, incon-\nsistent measurement of SES and offending, and attrition of\nhigher-risk subjects over time. Regression models by race\nand economic status derived from the counter-study's single,\nlimited, and confounded data set cannot reliably demonstrate\na generalizable age\u00adcrime curve even within their truncated\nage range, let alone serve as a challenge to newer, popula-\ntion-level studies encompassing much broader age ranges.\nAge, SES, and offending clearly require more analysis.\nMethod\nThe present study uses population-level analysis of two crime\npredictors: age and poverty rate. The premise derived empiri-\ncally from macro-level statistics is that young populations\ndiffer substantially from older populations in more ways--\nand potentially more important ways--than just age. One bar-\nrier to analysis is that SES variables such as poverty level are\nnot captured in the official arrest statistics typically used to\nconstruct crude age\u00adcrime curves. An alternative measure,\nself-reporting surveys of criminal behavior, enables tabula-\ntions of individual socio-economic variables that are not cap-\ntured in official crime statistics, but self-reports may be\nincomplete and unreliable (Lauritsen, 1998), and, in particu-\nlar, may vary in reliability with age as previously discussed.\nA third alternative, used here, is to use risk outcome and\ncensus statistics to conduct population-level investigations\ninto whether disproportionately low-SES and high concen-\ntration of high-arrest demographics among young people, as\nopposed to young age per se, explains the \"age\u00adhomicide\ncurve\" in the same way they would explain the \"race\u00adhomi-\ncide curve.\" Homicide, particularly firearms homicide, fatal-\nity has been extensively cited as exemplifying the most\nserious kind of age-based risk.\nHomicide Tabulations\nAs an index, homicide has distinct advantages and disadvan-\ntages. It is subject to rigorous investigation and is the only\ncriminal offense also tabulated as a vital statistics event. In\nCalifornia, homicide deaths are available from the state's\n2012 period in considerable detail, providing homicide method\nand single year of age by race and Hispanic ethnicity by county\nof residence. This 22-year study period includes years of both\nhigh- and low-homicide tolls and thus minimizes both period\nand cohort effects as well as selection biases. However, it is\na relatively rare offense requiring large populations and mul-\ntiple years to show definitive, detailed patterns.\nTo minimize the crime-inhibiting physical limitations of\nvery young and very old age, only ages 15 to 69 are assessed.\nFor these ages, all homicide deaths (N = 54,094), gun homi-\ncide deaths (n = 41,123), and non-gun homicide deaths (n =\n12,977) are tabulated for the four major races (Hispanic,\nWhite not Hispanic, Black not Hispanic, Asian/Other not\nHispanic), for eleven 5-year age groups (15-19 through\n65-69), and for the state's 58 counties for the study period.\nThese tabulations produced 2,552 raw, age-by-race-by-\ncounty cells statewide.\nPopulations and Poverty Rates\nPopulations by single year of age, race and Hispanic ethnic-\nity, county of residence, and year are available from\nEPICenter (2014) and the California Department of Finance\n(2014) for the entire period. Poverty rates--the percentage of\nthe population living in households with incomes below fed-\neral poverty guidelines--by age group, race, and county for\n1999, a central year in the study period, are available from\nAfter excluding the 305 minimal population cells without\nthe state's population remained available for analysis.\nPoverty rates by single years of age by race and county were\nimputed from grouped-age poverty rates by standard linear\nAge\nFigure 1. Youth offending as a period effect declined sharply from 1996 (corresponding to NLSY, Wave 1) to 2003 (corresponding to\nNote. Proportion arrested for any offense (status offenses excluded). NLSY = National Longitudinal Study of Youth.\n6 SAGE Open\nAnalysis\nFor ages 15 to 69, separate homicide counts, population\nthe population in poverty were calculated separately for each\nrace, 5-year age group, 5% poverty bracket, and county by\nstandard SPSS software. Age groups were further collapsed\ninto standard 5-year age groups for those under age 30 and\n10-year age groups for those 30 and older. Due to very small\nnumbers of young people in the two lowest poverty brackets\nand very few older ages in the two highest poverty brackets,\nthe lowest and highest poverty rates were combined into less\nthan 10% and more than 25% brackets (Table 1). This analy-\nsis is repeated for firearms homicides and non-gun homi-\ncides. Excel charting functions produced both the crude\npoint-to-point arithmetic trendlines and the polynomial\nregression lines based on least-squares expressions incorpo-\nrating all data points into a continuous curve, shown in\nResults\nAge and Poverty Levels\nTable 1 provides the sums of homicide counts and popula-\ntions by age group and poverty bracket. Poverty is heavily\nconcentrated in younger ages. California's teenagers and\nyoung adults occupy very different economic environments\non average than older adults. More than half (52%) of 15- to\n24-year-olds are in population cells with poverty levels aver-\naging 20% or higher, compared with fewer than 7% of adults\nolds occupy cells with poverty rates averaging below 10%,\n5% or 10% poverty brackets, younger people's average pov-\nerty rate is higher than for older ages.\nCommensurate with higher poverty levels, youths and\nyoung adult populations have substantially higher propor-\ntions of African and Hispanic Americans, whose homicide\nTable 1.

Older ages also show much higher\nrates of homicide among those in the 20+% poverty brackets\ncompared with those in poverty brackets below 10%, but\nthere are so few occupants age 40 and older in the highest\npoverty categories that homicide rates are more erratic and\nthe overall impact of poverty is much lower.\nAge, Poverty, and Gun Homicide Rates\nCrude rates of gun homicide mortality by age group, unad-\njusted for poverty level--that is, the familiar age\u00admurder\ncurves, including their polynomial distributions--are shown\nin Figure 2. In the unadjusted distribution, both homicide and\ngun homicide rates peak at age 19 and decline thereafter, and\nTable 1 and Figure 3 show the complex results for homi-\ncide rates when poverty rates are held constant across age\ngroups. When poverty levels are held constant, the traditional\nTable 2.

These high-poverty brackets\ncontaining just half the teenage and young adult populations\nbut accounting for four fifths of teenage and young adult gun\nhomicides are the ones that generate crude, unadjusted age\u00ad\nhomicide curves.\nAt poverty levels below 20%, age\u00adrisk curves are weak\nand ambiguous, and teenaged rates become unremarkable. A\ndelayed age\u00adcrime curve appears at a constant poverty level\n30s and age 15-to-19's rates similar to those of adults in their\nlate 30s. In the 10% to 14% poverty bracket, the peak occurs\nthose in their 40s and 50s. At poverty levels below 5%, only\nan average of 0.2 gun homicides per year occurred among\nproducing rates that were low and erratic.\nThe goodness-of-fit of the polynomial trendlines to the\narithmetic trendlines is strong for poverty levels of 5% or\nhigher, with R2 values of well over .90 for poverty levels of\nthe smaller, more erratic numbers at poverty levels of 0% to\n4%, all of which are strongly significant. The near-complete\nabsence of young people from low poverty and older ages\nfrom high-poverty brackets renders gun homicide rates more\nerratic and error terms larger, but the association of poverty\nwith more homicide remains.\nDiscussion\nTwo salient facts, the first well accepted among modern\nresearchers and the second well documented by standard\nsocial indexes, are evident: (a) poverty and social disadvan-\ntage are crucial variables in assessing comparative levels of\ncriminal offending and other risks among varied populations,\nand (b) adolescents, young adults, and older adult popula-\ntions differ in significant ways other than just age, including\npoverty level and other measures of disadvantage. This study\nrepresents the latest validation of a long line of social science\nresearch that incorporates measures of disadvantage as stan-\ndard controls when evaluating statistical variations among\npopulation groups--but which, curiously, have only rarely\nand recently been applied to comparative studies of risk by\nage.\nIn every case we have investigated of supposedly signa-\nture \"adolescent risks\"--fatal traffic crashes, firearms mor-\ntality, felony crime, violent crime, and, in the present study,\nhomicide and firearms homicide--we find they are severely\nmitigated or disappear altogether once the economic playing\nfield is leveled. The \"age\u00adcrime curve\" does exist in two\nways: (a) at every poverty level, murder rates drop off in the\n50s and 60s, and (b) at poverty levels of 20% or higher, the\ntraditional age\u00adcrime curve prevails. It is the very high gun\nhomicide level (and to a much lesser extent, the higher\nnon-gun homicide level) in the poorest brackets occupied\nheavily by young people that create the traditional \"age\u00ad\nrisk\" curve. That is, adolescent risks are artifacts of the real-\nity that the overwhelming majority of serious adolescent\ncrimes, including homicide, and other risk outcomes are con-\ncentrated in the poorest demographics--those with poverty\nrates of 20% to 25% and higher--in which middle-aged and\nolder adults are seldom found.\nUnder this revised theory, young people do not \"age out\"\nof crime, they \"wealth out.\" The failure to consider SES as a\ndeterminant in offending may also explain why studies\nattempting to forecast crime trends from the age structure of\nthe population have proven so quickly and notoriously inac-\nBecause poverty is an acknowledged, crucial variable and\nthe young are much poorer than the old, research that pur-\nports to affirm adolescent risk taking while failing to incor-\nporate measures of age-based disadvantage in comparing\nrisks across the life span represents a deviation from standard\nsocial science practice. Unfortunately, some researchers pro-\npose to perpetuate this omission. Shulman et al. (2013a;\n2013b) summarized new efforts by \"developmental scien-\ntists from diverse backgrounds\" who \"have been making\nrapid progress toward an integrated theory\" that would\nexplain \"at multiple levels\" why \"there is something about\nadolescence as a developmental period that inclines youth\ntoward law-breaking behavior\" and \"increased willingness\nthat their single, age-limited, methodologically flawed, and\nfatally confounded study of one young NLSY cohort has\neffectively established that \"the age\u00adcrime curve in adoles-\ncence and early adulthood is not due to age differences in\neconomic status,\" they welcome an \"integrated theory\" that\nincorporates findings from neuroscientific work investigating\nstructural and functional changes in the brain that take place\nduring adolescence and may facilitate risk-seeking, as well as\nresults from psychological research examining age-related\nchanges in traits (e.g., sensation-seeking, reward salience, and\nsusceptibility to peer influence) related to this type of behavior.\nYet, developmentally and neurologically based risk con-\ncepts remain poorly grounded. That \"something about ado-\nlescence,\" as we have shown in several studies, is a poverty\nlevel 2 to 3 times higher than among middle-aged adults--a\n\"something\" that middle-aged adults, when subjected to it at\nteenaged levels, is also associated with middle-agers' greatly\nheightened rates of crime and other risks. Economic disad-\nvantage is the same \"something about African Americans,\"\n\"something about Native Americans,\" and \"something about\nMississippians\" that is associated with statistical excesses\nfor many risks--a \"race\u00adcrime curve\" or a \"geography\u00ad\ncrime curve\"--in these groups. However, this is not to say\nthat higher poverty, greater disadvantage, and lower SES\nengender the same effects within populations, and certainly\ndo not produce the same effects among individuals. With\nregard to age, JosephAdelson (2008) points out, \"transitional\nperiods--from early childhood to middle age\"--produce\ntheir own types of \"inner and outer discord,\" and many indi-\nviduals will not display tendencies found among other of\nFor example, the fact that rates of a comprehensive risk\nindex, violent death (accident, suicide, homicide, and unde-\ntermined deaths), are substantially higher among suppos-\npopulation in 2012)--including surprisingly high risks\namong non-Hispanic Whites (84.8)--than among the sup-\nposedly risk-prone, more racially diverse ages 18 to 24\n(60.1; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC],\n2014), could be used to formulate an integrated, bio-devel-\nopmental theory of innate middle-aged cognitive deteriora-\nand risk taking. Yet, excessive and rising external mortality,\nalong with rising criminal arrest (FBI, 2014), among\nAmerican middle-agers (despite their generally high-SES\nand low-poverty levels) has received virtually no scholarly\nor policy attention. If it did, one can safely bet the focus\nwould be on external conditions, not internal biologies.\nInvestigations consistently suggest that adults, including\nresearchers, favor their own aging peers while subscribing\nto systematically negative stereotypes toward adolescents\nthat constitute \"a stubborn, fixed set of falsehoods,\" as\nreaffirmed. In a review of 150 studies, Offer and Schonert-\nReichl (1992) lamented that so many, including researchers,\n\"continue to believe many of the myths about adolescence\"\nIn that light, the \"integrated theory\" purporting to merge\nbiological- and developmental-stage theories to speculate\nwhy adolescents \"act the way they do\" (Shulman et al.,\nnotions that combined supposedly innate biological- and\nphylogenic-stage notions into theories speculating why\nraces, ethnicities, and genders \"acted the way they did\" (see\nGould, 1981). One only need consider the fact that homicide\nrates are 18 times higher among the poorest than the wealthi-\nin the lowest poverty brackets experience an average of just\n1.1 murders per year (a European level), or that 40-agers and\n50-agers subjected to the same poverty levels as older teen-\nagers display the same levels of homicide (see Table 1)--to\ncome to the conclusion that innate biological and develop-\nmental imperatives are at best marginal drivers of late ado-\nlescent and young adult offending.\nLimitations\nThis study continues preliminary, population-level investiga-\ntion of risk outcomes by age. It concerns the association of\nrisk with environments of poverty and, to avoid the \"ecologi-\ncal fallacy,\" cannot be used to predict individual outcomes.\nThe study is confined to homicide and gun homicide, rare but\nwell defined and comprehensively tabulated outcomes that\nhave been asserted to display the traditional \"age-crime\" pat-\ntern, and may not apply to unstudied risks. It is confined to\nCalifornia, a populous state with large representations of var-\nied demographics that, nevertheless, may not be generaliz-\nable to other geographies.\n"
