Using an Internet-based epidemiological survey, this\npaper advances understanding of the prevalence and correlates of NMU of medications used to\ntreat ADHD, sources of diverted medications, motivations for use, and consumption patterns.\nMethods: The study used a self-administered Internet survey of civilian, noninstitutionalized adults\n(N = 4,297) aged 18 to 49 in the United States. National-level estimates were created using\npropensity scoring methods and weighting procedures using data from three nationally\nrepresentative probability surveys: a random-digit dialed telephone survey, the current U.S.\nCensus, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).\nResults: Past-year prevalence of NMU of ADHD medications was approximately 2%, with 4.3%\nreporting NMU used on multiple occasions. Receipt of medications for ADHD was a significant\ncorrelate of past-year NMU, though most nonmedical users never had a prescription. Among\npersons who had never been prescribed medication to treat ADHD, friends or family members\nwere the most common source. Productivity was the most frequently endorsed reason for NMU.\nAlcohol was the substance most commonly used in combination with ADHD drugs.\nConclusion: Because most prescription ADHD medications currently are highly regulated, policy\noptions for supply-side reduction of nonmedical use may include identifying those medications with\nlower abuse liability for inclusion on insurance formularies. Patient and physician education\nprograms also may be useful tools to heighten awareness of intentional and unintentional diversion\nof ADHD medications for nonmedical purposes.\nThis article is available from: http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n\u00a9 2007 Novak et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nClinician awareness of the presence and burden of atten-\ntion deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased\nin the United States and internationally [1-4]. In parallel,\nprescribing of medication for ADHD has increased over\nthe past several years, particularly for adults [5,6]. Thus,\nthe number of youth and adult patients receiving pharma-\ncologic ADHD treatment is growing, and treatment\nincludes a diverse range of stimulant and nonstimulant\nmedications. As the number of prescriptions increases, the\navailability of these medications for diversion to nonmed-\nical use (NMU) also increases.\nWhat is largely known about NMU of ADHD drugs is\nderived from data sources that may not focus specifically\non ADHD medications or from samples with limited gen-\neralizability. Most of these investigations have grouped a\nvariety of prescription stimulants (e.g., methampheta-\nmine, ADHD medications, anorectic drugs) as a broad\ntherapeutic class. A study that specifically identified the\nNMU of prescription ADHD stimulants was conducted by\nSurvey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) [7]. Except for\nmethamphetamine, however, the 2002 NSDUH asked\nabout NMU of specific stimulants only for the lifetime\nperiod. Therefore, measurement of past-year NMU of\nADHD stimulants in the study was limited to persons who\nhad never used any other types of stimulant nonmedi-\ncally. Based on these data, the past-year prevalence of\nNMU of only ADHD stimulants was higher among young\ndemographic correlates also differed between stimulants\nin general and ADHD stimulants. This suggests that infor-\nmation about NMU of prescription stimulants may not be\napplicable to NMU of ADHD-specific medications. How-\never, limiting measurement of past-year NMU of ADHD\ndrugs to persons who exclusively misused these medica-\ntions likely underestimated the true population preva-\nlence, as it would have excluded persons who were\nnonmedical users (NMUs) of both ADHD stimulants and\nother stimulants in the past year. Further, NSDUH cap-\ntures information on only a small subset of stimulant\nmedications used to treat ADHD and excludes the newer\nclasses of nonstimulant ADHD medications. Even for\nADHD medications that are considered to have lower\nabuse potential, information about their use outside of\nmedical supervision or in doses exceeding a treatment reg-\nimen would constitute problematic use due to potential\nside effects or drug interactions.\nOther studies have observed higher rates of stimulant mis-\nuse among those aged 18 to 25, college students, and\npolydrug users [8-11]. Past studies examining polydrug\nuse typically define use of multiple drugs based on a sum-\nmary of the number of different substances used at any\ntime in the past year. One notable exception that exam-\nined the co-occurrence of use of multiple substances was\na study conducted by McCabe and colleagues [11]. How-\never, the sample was limited to college students at a single\nuniversity, and only the co-occurrence between alcohol\nand prescription medications, including stimulants, was\ninvestigated. More specific information is needed about\nconsumption patterns using a more diverse sample to\nexamine whether users are combining multiple drugs\nwithin a single drug-using episode, and if so, which drugs\nare used together with ADHD medications. This is signifi-\ncant given the potential adverse health risks associated\nwith particular drug combinations involving ADHD med-\nCompared to studies examining the prevalence and corre-\nlates of nonmedical ADHD drug use, fewer studies have\nspecifically examined dimensions of access and motiva-\ntion for NMU of ADHD medications. McCabe et al. [13]\nreported that in a sample of middle and high school stu-\ndents in the Midwest, over 23% of those with a prescrip-\ntion for an ADHD medication were approached to sell,\ntrade, or give away their medications. This finding is con-\nfirmed in the 2005 NSDUH, which found that most per-\nsons who used prescription stimulants (excluding\nmethamphetamine) nonmedically in the past year\nreceived them from friends or relatives for free [14]. Some\nstudies have examined associations between NMU and\npsychological factors, including ADHD status [15,16] to\nidentify possible motivations for use. For example, a clin-\nical case-control study by Wilens and colleagues [17]\nbased on ADHD diagnosis (N = 186) found that 36% of\nthe sample reported use for self-medication, 25% used\nADHD medications to get high, and 39% had unknown\nmotivation. A community-based study at a single univer-\nsity found that nearly 25% of those with ADHD reported\nuse of their medications for recreational purposes [18].\nYet, much of the literature points to NMU of prescription\nstimulants for performance enhancement. Teter et al.\n[19], in a study at a large, midwestern university, found\nthat prescription stimulants were used primarily for per-\nformance enhancement, although use for feelings of\neuphoria (e.g., getting high) also was noted. These studies,\nwhile primarily limited to regional populations, suggest\nthat peers are a common source of diverted medications\nand that performance enhancement or self-medication\nare important motivations for NMU.\nSome of these investigations used large, epidemiological\nsurveillance systems (e.g., NSDUH) that offer considera-\nble breadth but may lack sufficient depth for examining,\nin detail, more focused topics such as NMU of ADHD\nmedications. In contrast, a small but insightful number of\ninvestigations focusing on patterns of diversion and moti-\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nvation for NMU of ADHD medications have relied on\nsmall, regionally based or clinical samples [20,21]. The\ncosts and resources needed to recruit a sample large\nenough to support reliable estimates of NMU of ADHD\nmedications could be an important barrier to designing\nnew national-level and international-level studies with\nspecific foci on ADHD medication NMU and diversion.\nInternet surveys have emerged as an alternative data col-\nlection method when in-person or telephone surveys\ncould be costly or time-consuming. Berrens et al. [22] list\nseveral features of Internet surveys that make this design\nwell-suited for a study of diverted ADHD medication use,\nincluding (1) low marginal costs because no interviewer\nlabor is involved in screening or interviewing, (2) the abil-\nity to use visual cues (e.g., pictures of medications) via the\nWeb to aid respondent recall, (3) rapid assembly of sam-\nples, and (4) rapid data collection from respondents with\nless prevalent characteristics of interest [7,23]. Concerns\nthat have been cited about some Internet surveys focus on\nthe use of nonprobability samples [24]. However, these\nconcerns may be partly offset by an increased level of\naccess to the Internet by a broader range of socioeconomic\nand demographic groups, particularly younger adults\n[25,26], a subpopulation with higher rates of NMU of pre-\nscription drugs. Internet recruitment can use a probability\nsample to select respondents who then complete the inter-\nview via a Web-based data collection system. However,\nInternet market research panels have emerged as an ave-\nnue for recruitment because a sample may be drawn from\na preexisting opt-in panel of possible respondents that\nhave agreed to complete regular online surveys. In this\nregard, \"opt-in panel\" refers to a group of respondents\nthat have agreed to participate in multiple surveys, rather\nthan a single group of participants in a longitudinal study.\nTwo techniques that also have been used to increase the\nconfidence in findings from this approach include tar-\ngeted recruitment based on known demographic charac-\nteristics of panel participants and use of propensity\nweighting methods to approximate the results that would\nhave been obtained from a probability-based survey [27].\nYet, Internet panel data should be carefully evaluated for\nbias, and regarded as an initial step in producing estimates\nthat shed preliminary insight into the nature and scope of\nan emergent issue, or one about which little is known,\nsuch as prescription drug abuse.\nIn light of these issues, this diversion study reports find-\nings using an existing opt-in Internet sample recruited\nfrom the entire United States for the following purposes:\n(1) provide estimates of NMU of ADHD medications by\nidentifying specific medications used in the treatment of\nADHD rather than using a general question about \"pre-\nscription stimulants\" commonly used, (2) identify the\nsubpopulations (e.g., those with ADHD) at greatest risk\nfor NMU, (3) identify important sources of diverted med-\nications, (4) examine motivations for NMU, and (5) esti-\nmate the patterns of alcohol and other drug use in\ncombination with ADHD medications.\nMethods\nStudy sample and procedures\nParticipants were drawn from Harris Interactive's Harris\nPoll Online (HPOL) panel, which consists of several mil-\nlion members internationally who consented to be con-\ntacted for public opinion surveys administered through\nthe Internet. Members are added to the database after they\nhave completed a two-stage registration process: first by\nsigning on to the HPOL Web site and then by responding\nto a confirmation e-mail message providing a confidential\npassword. Data are collected through an encrypted, pass-\nword-protected Web portal. Eligible panelists were nonin-\nstitutionalized civilian adults aged 18 to 49 living in the\nUnited States (50 states and the District of Columbia). A\nminimum age of 18 was chosen because the time and\ncosts of obtaining active parental consent for minors\nlikely would have offset the benefits of online data collec-\ntion. The maximum age was set at 49 to increase the effi-\nciency of the sampling design, taking into account the low\nprevalence of NMU of prescription drugs among persons\naged 50 or older [23] and the number of respondents who\nwould be needed to generalize to this age group. Moreo-\nver, the NSDUH, which was used as a benchmark to post-\nstratify the data, collapses ages 50 to 65 into a single cate-\ngory rather than reporting age-specific data for this range.\nThe sample size was determined from prevalence rates of\nNMU of ADHD stimulants estimated from Kroutil et al.\n[7]. These estimates provided sample sizes for three targets\n49), gender, and NMU of ADHD stimulants (lifetime and\npast 3 years). These procedures favored the representation\nof whites, males, and young adults to ensure adequate\nnumbers of nonmedical users (NMUs) in the final sam-\nple.\nThe survey was conducted during August 2005. Study\nenrollment and consent involved a two-part process. First,\ne-mail invitations describing the study were sent to panel\nmembers who initially met eligibility criteria according to\ndata in the Harris Interactive (HI) database on panel\nmembers' age group and country of residence. These crite-\nria were based on the NSDUH, which collects information\nfrom residents of households, noninstitutional group\nquarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories), and\ncivilians living on military bases. Persons excluded from\nthe survey include homeless persons who do not use shel-\nters, active-duty military personnel, and residents of insti-\ntutional group quarters, such as prisons and long-term\nhospitals. Respondents completed a short screener that\nverified these characteristics. The screener also asked\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nabout respondents' military status, living situation, and\nsubstance use history, including NMU of ADHD medica-\ntions; target groups were filled according to screening\nresponses. For consistency with the NSDUH, active-duty\nmilitary personnel and residents of institutional group\nquarters (e.g., long-term care facilities) were excluded\nfrom the study. Eligible respondents (i.e., those whose tar-\nget groups had not been filled) were routed to a more\ndetailed consent statement for participation in the full\nsurvey. Respondents who otherwise would have been eli-\ngible but whose target groups had already been filled did\nnot complete the full survey. The survey took an average\nof 20 minutes to complete if respondents reported NMU.\n11,200 responses were received, regardless of outcome, or\nbers who responded, 4,541 met the eligibility criteria and\nwere needed for the study (i.e., their target groups had not\ncompleted the survey, and 244 (5.4%) declined to partic-\nipate or did not complete the survey by the close of data\ncollection.\nWeighting procedures\nWe employed a two-part methodology to adjust for Inter-\nnet responses relative to the U.S. population of adults\naged 18 to 49. First, propensity scoring methods were\nused to weight the data to approximate results for a prob-\nability-based telephone survey. Second, the data were fur-\nther weighted to match the U.S. target population\ndistribution by general demographic characteristics and to\nmatch the distribution of past-month cigarette use and\npast-month binge alcohol use estimated from 2003\nNSDUH, which were the most current publicly available\ndata during the data processing phase of this study, in\nbelow.\nThe first step in the weighting procedure involved propen-\nsity scoring to reduce the bias attributable to collecting\ndata from only HPOL members. The propensity score was\nincluded to adjust for self-selection into the online popu-\nlation and the panel, as well as for survey nonresponse\nthat may not be explained by demographic differences. HI\nperiodically conducts parallel telephone and Web surveys\nto measure attitudinal and behavioral variables that pre-\ndict one's propensity to be online; the telephone survey is\nbased on random-digit dialing (RDD) probability sam-\npling. Using the combined telephone and Web surveys,\nHI created a propensity score model [27] for online survey\nresponse. Weights were created so that the weighted distri-\nbution of the propensity score for Web respondents was\nmatched to the distribution for the RDD telephone\nrespondents. This approach caused the weighted distribu-\ntion of the attitudinal and behavioral variables of Web\nrespondents to be aligned with those of the RDD tele-\nphone respondents. In short, the propensity score adjust-\nment may make the Internet survey estimates more\ncomparable to those obtained from an RDD telephone\nsurvey. It is similar to adjustments made in clinical and\nobservational studies to ensure that groups are balanced\non potentially confounding characteristics. In this case,\nthe effect of confounding by selection into the Internet\npanel is adjusted using information from an RDD tele-\nphone survey. The weighting targets for the telephone sur-\nvey were derived from the Current Population Survey\nconducted annually by the U.S. Census.\nThe second step was that the propensity score-adjusted\nweights that RTI obtained from HI underwent further cal-\nibration using the generalized exponential model [29]\na weighted household screening response rate of 90.7%\nand a weighted interview response rate of 77.4% [30]. We\nused past-month cigarette use and past-month binge alco-\nhol use from NSDUH as a benchmark in creating final\nweights to make appropriate inferences to the noninstitu-\ntionalized U.S. adult population aged 18 to 49. Both of\nthese variables are likely related to a respondent's proba-\nbility of substance use and a respondent's likelihood of\nbeing in a Web panel [31]. Age, gender, and highest edu-\ncation also were included in the weight adjustment to\nbring the weighted distribution of the Internet respond-\nents in line with the U.S. target population. This strategy\nfurther aligned the Internet sample with the large, nation-\nally representative NSDUH on factors related to NMU of\nprescription medications. Although a detailed accounting\nof the propensity model is beyond the scope of the current\nmanuscript, this additional supplemental information is\nfreely available by contacting the primary author.\nWe also evaluated bias by comparing estimates in our sur-\nvey with those for analogous variables in the 2005\nNSDUH. Correspondence between the 2005 Diversion II\nestimates and the 2005 NSDUH suggests that the propen-\nsity model developed using 2003 NSDUH data, a follow-\nup telephone survey, and the U.S. census successfully\nreduced bias in the estimates, thus providing a large\ndegree of confidence in the resulting estimates.\nSample characteristics and correspondence with the 2005\nNSDUH\nTable 1 provides a demographic breakdown of the study\nsample, including unweighted and weighted percentages.\nBecause our procedures targeted specified numbers of\nNMUs, young adults and whites were overrepresented in\nthe survey; however, the final analysis weights of young\nadults and whites reflect their representation in the U.S.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 2 compares estimates from the 2005 diversion study\nand the 2005 NSDUH, including significance tests and\neffect sizes. We present effect sizes using Cohen's d [32]\nbecause the combined samples of the NSDUH (N =\nhigh power to classify even the smallest of differences as\nstatistically significant. Measures in Table 2 were not used\nin our weight calibrations. Therefore, they indicate how\nwell our weighting procedures yielded estimates that are\ncomparable to a large, national probability survey. Of the\ndrug use items common to both studies, only the preva-\nlence estimate for lifetime NMU of Cylert (pemoline) was\nsignificantly different, though the effect size suggests that\nthis difference was relatively small.\nInstrument and measures\nDemographic and substance use items were based directly\non public-domain NSDUH questions to establish compa-\nrability in the estimates between the two studies. NMU of\nprescription drugs was defined as use without a prescrip-\ntion or for the feeling or experience; examples of exact\nquestion wordings in the diversion study are shown in the\nappendix. Consistent with NSDUH, respondents were\nasked about the most recent NMU, including NMU in the\n12-month period prior to taking the survey (i.e., \"past\nyear\").\nNSDUH asks about lifetime NMU of a subset of ADHD\nmedications but does not ask specifically about most\nrecent NMU of ADHD medications. Therefore, we\nadapted NSDUH questions to ask about the most recent\nNMU of a wider range of ADHD medications. Similar to\nNSDUH, pictures of prescription pills were used to facili-\ntate recall. For comparability with NSDUH, we asked\nrespondents about NMU of brand-name drugs followed\nby their generic equivalents, or about NMU of specific\nbrand-name drugs only. In addition, we asked respond-\nents about NMU of a fictitious drug (Supraval) to gauge\nthe potential for indiscriminate reporting of NMU [33].\nAfter completing the medication module, respondents\nwere asked the number of days in the past year they used\nany ADHD medication.\nNSDUH also does not capture information on ADHD\nsymptomatology. Therefore, we created items to capture\nwhether respondents reported ever receiving a diagnosis\nTable 1: Sample characteristics of 2005 ADHD diversion study\nSample n Sample Percent Weighted Percenta SE\nAge\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation\nInsurance\nADHD status\nADHD = attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\na Weighted to the U.S. population of noninstitutionalized civilian adults aged 18\u00ad49.\nb Excludes four respondents who reported fabricating symptoms or obtaining medications from a doctor \"who didn't ask too many questions\" in the\npast year.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nof ADHD from a medical professional and whether they\never received prescription medication for their condition.\nAmong respondents who reported that they had received\nprescriptions for ADHD in the past year, we excluded four\nwho reported that they obtained some medications by\nmisrepresenting their symptoms or by going to doctors\nwith lenient prescribing practices. We defined remaining\nrespondents who received prescriptions for their ADHD\nin the past year as having \"legitimate\" prescriptions\nbecause they did not report NMU, or if they did, they did\nnot obtain their medications fraudulently from physi-\ncians.\nUsing existing items from prior studies [28,34], respond-\nents with past-year NMU of ADHD medications were\nasked to report ways in which they obtained these drugs\nin that period. In addition, respondents who reported\npast-year NMU were asked about drugs they used at the\nsame time or within a couple of hours of their NMU of\nADHD medications. Past-year NMUs also were asked the\nprimary reason for misusing these ADHD medications\nTable 2: Selected lifetime nonmedical use of prescription and illicit drugs, ADHD diversion study, National Survey of Drug Use and\nLifetime Use\n%a SE %a SE Pb ESc\nIllicit Drugs\nPrescription stimulantse\nPrescription stimulantse\nADHD Nonstimulants\nADHD = attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; n/a = Estimate not available from the 2005 NSDUH; NSDUH = National Survey of Drug Use and\nHealth.\na Weighted to the U.S. population of noninstitutionalized civilian adults aged 18 to 49.\nb P value derived from chi-square test in SUDAAN.\nc Effect size, determined by the difference in prevalence estimates between the 2005 Diversion Study and the 2005 NSDUH.

Because some of these medications may be\nused to treat ADHD (e.g., amphetamines), respondents in the 2005 Diversion Study who reported lifetime nonmedical use of \"prescription diet\npills\" were subsequently asked separate questions about nonmedical use of (a) amphetamines; (b) Benzedrine; (c) Biphetamine; (d) Fastin, or\nphentermine; or (e)some other prescription diet pill.\ng ADHD stimulants referred to any of the following: amphetamines or dextroamphetamine (including any form of Adderall, Biphetamine, Dexedrine,\nDextrostat, or Dexampex); any form of methylphenidate or dexmethylphenidate (including Ritalin, Concerta, Methylin, or Focalin); or Cylert or\npemoline.\nh Nonmedical use of any ADHD stimulants or nonstimulants in the period of interest.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n[35] (see the appendix for question wording). Of note was\nthat student status refers to current enrollment in high\nschool, college, technical school, or advanced graduate\nstudies.\nAnalysis\nDescriptive statistics include prevalence estimates (per-\ncentages), the corresponding standard errors, and the esti-\nmated numbers of persons in the population. These were\ncalculated by applying weights to generalize the answers\nof the respondents to the population of U.S. civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized adults aged 18 to 49. Statistical tests,\nsuch as chi-squares, odds ratios, and corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs) were used to examine differ-\nences in the distribution of outcomes within demographic\nand substance use subgroups. Bivariate associations are\npresented because our primary interest was to identify vul-\nnerable populations rather than build explanatory models\nusing multivariate statistical modeling approaches. How-\never, we also estimated a single multivariable (i.e.,\nadjusted) model using logistic regression. The independ-\nent variables included demographics, ADHD status, and\ndrug use history. We present the significance effect of each\ncharacteristic after adjusting for potential confounders in\nthe model. All analyses used SUDAAN (Release 9.01) to\naccount for the sampling design by making appropriate\nuse of the calculated sample weights [36]. As this was not\na multistage design, no adjustments were necessary to cor-\nrect the standard errors for the sampling of respondents\nwithin strata.\nResults\nPrevalence of lifetime and past-year NMU\nmedically any ADHD medication, which includes both\nstimulants and nonstimulants, at least once in their life-\ntime, and 2% did so in the past year (Table 2); estimates\nwere comparable for ADHD stimulants. NMU of short-\nacting forms of ADHD stimulants was more prevalent\nthan that of long-acting ones, both for lifetime (5.4% for\nshort-acting ADHD stimulants versus 2.1% for long-act-\ning) and past-year (1.6% versus 1.0%) periods. (See the\nappendix for examples of how survey information was\nobtained on NMU of short- and long-acting medications).\nMany of the specific drug estimates for past-year NMU\n(Table 3) should be interpreted cautiously because of\ntheir imprecision, as shown by the magnitude of the\nstandard errors relative to the estimates. Most respondents\nwho reported past-year NMU reported such use on multi-\nple occasions \u00ad an estimated 30% of past-year NMUs of\nADHD medications used on 1 or 2 days in the past year,\nand 70% used on 3 or more days.\nPast-year NMU in selected population subgroups\nBivariate data in Table 4 indicate that the most vulnerable\npopulations for NMU were those abusing illicit drugs \u00ad\nincluding methamphetamine (OR = 48.3 for past-year\nusers versus nonusers), cocaine (OR = 26.4), marijuana\n(OR = 7.3) \u00ad and alcohol (binge drinking OR = 5.1). In\naddition, 69.2% of NMUs reported binge drinking in the\npast month, and 53.9% used marijuana in the past year,\nbut only 16% were past-year methamphetamine users\n(data not shown).\nHigher rates of NMU of ADHD medications also were\nobserved for those who self-reported that they had\nreceived a legitimate prescription for ADHD medications\nin the past year (OR = 22.1) or had received medications\nin their lifetime but not in the past year (OR = 6.3).\nAlthough ADHD apparently elevated the risk of NMU, 1.9\nwho participated in NMU had never been diagnosed and\ntreated pharmacologically for ADHD. Further, fewer than\n5% of past-year users who used ADHD medications non-\nmedically were prescribed ADHD medications in that\nperiod.\nNMU of ADHD medications was more prevalent among\nobserved in key demographic subgroups, including gen-\nder, race, student status, and insurance status.\nSimilar to the bivariate models, in the multivariate logistic\nregression model, the likelihood of past-year NMU of\nADHD drugs was higher for past-year marijuana users and\nbinge drinkers than for their nonusing counterparts.\nReceipt of ADHD medications in the past year or lifetime\nalso remained significantly associated with NMU of\nADHD drugs in the multivariate model. However, the\nassociation for past-year methamphetamine use became\nnonsignificant in the multivariate model, suggesting that\nthe strong bivariate association between methampheta-\nmine use and NMU of ADHD drugs may be accounted for\nlargely by other demographic, psychosocial, and sub-\nstance use characteristics. This could be due either to con-\nfounding in which NMU and methamphetamine use are\nrelated to a third demographic or substance use factor, or\na mediational pathway in which the exogenous factors\ninfluence methamphetamine use, which influences NMU\nof ADHD medications. The effect of age also became non-\nsignificant in the multivariate model, suggesting a possi-\nble mediational pathway in which age may influence\nADHD symptoms and substance use behaviors such as\nbinge alcohol use and marijuana or cocaine use. In turn,\nother drug use and ADHD symptoms may influence the\nlikelihood of past-year NMU of ADHD medications.\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSources of diverted medications and motivations for NMU\nFigure 1 presents findings on sources of diverted ADHD\nmedications for the NMUs who reported never having an\nADHD diagnosis and prescription.

However, physicians also were a significant\nsource of diverted medications for this group, with nearly\n20% of NMUs having obtained fraudulent prescriptions\nby fabricating symptoms or presenting to doctors who\nwere known to \"not ask too many questions.\" An esti-\nmated 5% of NMUs without a legitimate need for a pre-\nscription procured their medications over the Internet.\nTable 3: Selected past year nonmedical use of prescription and illicit drugs, ADHD diversion study, National Survey of Drug Use and\nPast Year Use\n%a SE %a SE Pb ESc\nIllicit Drugs\nPrescription stimulantse\nPrescription stimulantse\nADHD Nonstimulants\nADHD = attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; n/a = Estimate not available from the 2005 NSDUH; NSDUH = National Survey of Drug Use and\nHealth.\na Weighted to the U.S. population of noninstitutionalized civilian adults aged 18 to 49.\nb P value derived from chi-square test in SUDAAN.\nc Effect size, determined by the difference in prevalence estimates between the 2005 Diversion Study and the 2005 NSDUH.

This study contributes new data on\na variety of issues related to NMU that provide insight into\nthe patterns of NMU of prescription ADHD medications\nand associated risk factors in the United States. However,\nresults from our study are not directly comparable to\nother data sources given that our study focuses on specific\ntypes of ADHD drugs rather than on stimulants in general.\nMost directly comparable is the study conducted by\nKroutil and colleagues [7] using the 2002 NSDUH. Based\non those data, the past-year prevalence of NMU of ADHD\nstimulants was higher among young adults aged 18 to 25\n(1.3%). This estimate is lower than our estimate of 4.3%\nfor those aged 18 to 25 for at least two reasons. First, the\ncurrent study covered a larger range of stimulant medica-\ntions, including medications such as Adderall, than the\nNSDUH. Also, the Kroutil et al. [7] study estimated NMU\nof ADHD medications for persons who had not misused\nother stimulants; that likely underestimated the preva-\nlence of any NMU of ADHD medications.\nAlthough not directly comparable because the estimates\nare based on only stimulants, the 2005 NSDUH estimated\nlant nonmedically in the past year. We also estimated the\npast-year prevalence from the public use files of the\nNational Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related\nConditions [38], which was found to be 1.7% among\nthose aged 18 to 25. Follow-up data for young adults from\nthe 2005 Monitoring the Future survey indicated that 5%\nto 7% of young adults aged 19 to 24 used amphetamines\nUse of alcohol or selected other drugs in combination with\nnonmedical use of adhd medications in the past year\nUse of alcohol or selected other drugs in combina-\ntion with nonmedical use of adhd medications in the\npast year.

Results from the College Alcohol Study\nrevealed that the rate of past-year NMU of prescription\nstimulants among college students was 4.1% [40], which\nin the current study.\nInspection of the prevalence rates from various commu-\nnity-based investigations revealed that, even among repre-\nsentative probability surveys, there is a wide degree of\nvariation, which may be due to differences in methodol-\nogy. For example, the NSDUH uses a definition of NMU\nbased on use without a doctor's prescription or \"only for\nthe experience or feeling it caused.\" This final definition\nresulted from methodological testing [23,41] to simplify\nthe concept of \"nonmedical\" use for NSDUH respond-\nents, some of whom are as young as 12. This definition\nhas been criticized for leaving open the possibility that\nlegitimate use may be reported by mistake [42]. However,\ndifferences in prevalence estimates between surveys such\nas the NSDUH and National Epidemiologic Survey on\nAlcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) also may be\nrelated to differences in mode of administration; NSDUH\nquestions about drug use are self-administered, but\nNESARC is administered directly by interviewers. Other\nresearch suggests that respondents may underreport sensi-\ntive behaviors if asked directly by interviewers [43]. Nev-\nertheless, findings on the correlates of NMU of ADHD\nmedications from this study were largely consistent with\nprevious research, providing a degree of confidence in our\nmethods. In particular, we observed higher rates of NMU\namong young adults aged 18 to 25 than among older age\ngroups, which parallels other national data [44,45].\nThere also is significant interest in the rates of NMU\namong students. Recent studies suggest that young adults,\nand particularly students, may account for much of the\nNMU of prescription stimulants. For example, Herman-\nStahl et al. [9] found in analyses of NSDUH data that col-\nlege students were at a greater risk of NMU of prescription\nstimulants than their noncollege peers. Further, previous\ncollege enrollment or graduation also was a significant\nrisk factor, suggesting that NMU of stimulants in general\nmay persist beyond college. However, the current study\nfound no statistically significant (P < .05) differences in\nthe rates of NMU of ADHD medications between young\nadult students (4.6%) and young adult nonstudents\n(4.2%), although we considered a broader range of medi-\ncations and focused on ADHD drugs rather than on pre-\nscription stimulants in general. It also should be noted\nthat our definition of student status included technical\nstudents and did not distinguish between full-time and\npart-time students. Thus, future studies should probe for\ndifferences in NMU by student enrollment status, includ-\ning full-time, part-time, public, private, technical, and\ncommunity college.\nAnother important contribution of this study involves\nexamination of the patterns of polydrug use among\nNMUs of ADHD medications. Binge alcohol use (69%)\nand marijuana use (54%) were fairly common among\npast-year NMUs, which also has been found in a previous\nstudy [9]. Although most ADHD medications are classi-\nfied as stimulants, only 16% of past-year NMUs of ADHD\nmedications also were past-year methamphetamine users.\nIn contrast, 46% of methamphetamine users commonly\nmisused prescription ADHD medications. One possible\nexplanation for this latter finding is that methampheta-\nmine users may engage in NMU of ADHD stimulants as a\nsubstitute when methamphetamine is unavailable. How-\never, additional studies, using items that capture aspects\nof substitution among methamphetamine users, are\nneeded to specifically test this assertion. Overall, NMU of\nADHD medications by methamphetamine users appears\nto constitute a relatively small portion of the overall diver-\nsion of ADHD medications in the United States, although\nuse of methamphetamine is a powerful risk factor for\nA significant strength of this study was that we also asked\nabout the concomitant use of ADHD medications with\nother drugs and alcohol. We observed that approximately\n68% of past-year NMUs had used at least one other sub-\nstance either at the same time or within a couple of hours\nof NMU of ADHD medications. Findings from McCabe et\nal. [11] using a sample drawn from a single university\nshowed that most polydrug use involving alcohol and\nprescription drugs occurred simultaneously rather than\non separate occasions. The high rate of alcohol use in\ncombination with NMU of ADHD drugs is alarming in\nthese studies, given that ADHD stimulants can counteract\nthe depressant effects of alcohol. This leaves open the pos-\nsibility that persons who drink alcohol may be able to\nprolong their drinking by also using stimulants, thereby\nincreasing their risk of alcohol poisoning. Findings from\nthe Drug Abuse Warning Network [46] indicate that over\n2% of all emergency department visits involving alcohol\nalso involved prescription stimulants [46]. We also found\nthat nearly one in five NMUs of ADHD medications had\nused them in combination with cocaine, which may\nincrease the risk of adverse cardiac events, given known\nrisks associated with cocaine use [47] and recent concerns\nabout potential cardiovascular risks associated with spe-\ncific ADHD medications [48]. The issue of co-occurrence\nis particularly germane because alcohol and other drugs\nhave the potential to affect the synaptic transmission pro-\nduced by stimulant and nonstimulant ADHD medica-\ntions, thus affecting regulation and causing adverse\nimmediate and long-term health consequences [49-51].\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nRecent research has found elevated rates of substance use\namong those with ADHD [16,52]. Similarly, findings\nfrom our study indicated that those who self-identified\nthat they had been diagnosed by a physician with ADHD\nand had been prescribed medication were at increased risk\nfor NMU of ADHD medications. However, NMU by this\nsubpopulation constitutes a relatively small proportion\n(less than 5%) of the total past-year NMU in the United\nStates. Further, interpretation of the association between\nnonmedical use of ADHD medications and a history of\npharmacologic treatment for ADHD requires caution. Our\ndata are cross-sectional and preclude causal inferences,\nsuch as concluding that prescribing medications with\npotential abuse liability increases the likelihood of NMU.\nAccumulating evidence from prospective research also\nsuggests that treatment of ADHD with stimulants in and\nof itself does not confer additional liability to NMU of\nADHD stimulants or other substances [53,54].\nOne possible explanation for the relation between NMU\nand an ADHD diagnosis or receipt of medications is that\nsome patients receiving pharmacological treatments may\nbe undermedicated or noncompliant with their pre-\nscribed therapeutic dosage. Consequently, they may take\nexcessive quantities to self-medicate or overcompensate\nfor earlier noncompliance because of an increase in the\nquantity and severity of untreated symptoms. However,\nundermedication seems a less plausible explanation for\nNMU in this study, as the question wording for NMU\nprimes the respondent to answer about use beyond the\ntherapeutic value of the drug as prescribed by a physician\nor medical professional (see the appendix). However, pro-\nductivity (39.8%) was a commonly endorsed motivation\nfor NMU for all respondents, regardless of ADHD status.\nThus, it is possible that a proportion of NMUs who are\ntaking ADHD medications to be more productive may be\nself-medicating ADHD symptoms. It is also possible that\na large proportion of those whose primary motivation for\nNMU is productivity may actually meet the criteria for\nADHD, but have not received a formal medical diagnosis.\nIn contrast to self-medication, another prominent sub-\ngroup of NMUs \u00ad nearly 30% \u00ad could be considered rec-\nreational users whose principal motivations were tension\nrelief, euphoria, or thrill-seeking. Another possible expla-\nnation linking ADHD and NMU is that an additional set\nof vulnerability factors linked to NMU, such as co-occur-\nring psychiatric disorders, may increase the likelihood of\nNMU of ADHD medications. We are conducting addi-\ntional analyses to examine the complex issues related to\ntreatment status, ADHD symptoms, NMU, and motiva-\ntions for use. Thus, additional research is needed with per-\nsons being treated pharmacologically for ADHD to\ncompare NMU between those with and without psychiat-\nric comorbidity to identify the combination of risk factors\nthat can account for vulnerability to NMU.\nOverall, these findings should be interpreted in light of\nseveral considerations. First, the validity of self-reported\ndrug use among Internet respondents depends on their\nwillingness to answer truthfully about drug use in that\ndata collection mode and their ability to recall use of spe-\ncific drugs within designated time frames. To aid in recall,\nour online survey questionnaire supplied respondents\nwith reference dates to establish recall periods such as the\npast 12 months and, where possible, made pictures of\nmedications available to respondents. We have also\nshown that our findings are consistent with data from a\nlarge national probability survey (NSDUH), as well as\nwith findings from other studies on NMU. Confidence in\nour findings is also supported by the low prevalence of\nself-reported NMU of the fictitious drug Supraval (life-\nents were able to discriminate between real and fictitious\ndrugs. Substance use data have been shown to be statisti-\ncally comparable between data collection modes involv-\ning mail surveys and the Internet [55], as well as between\nthe Internet and telephone [56]. HI also conducts routine\nscreening of Internet IP addresses and conducts follow-\nups with members to ensure that each participant is not\nusing multiple e-mail accounts to opt into the panel. For\nsecurity reasons, each panelist is also assigned a unique\nand confidential ID to ensure privacy. Together, these\nfindings strengthen our confidence in the accuracy of the\nself-reports and use of the Internet recruitment design.\nAlthough the convergence of our findings with those from\nother studies does not rule out misreporting of drug use in\nour data, it does not suggest a markedly greater misreport-\ning problem in our study than in others. Nevertheless, the\npossibility of a mode effect does remain [57], and\nresearchers should be sensitive to its presence by compar-\ning estimates from other data sources to check for reliabil-\nity of the data.\nSecond, concerns about selection bias may arise from the\nlow overall number of responses relative to the number of\ne-mail invitations that were sent and from our use of a\nnonprobability Internet survey to estimate NMU. With\nregard to the numbers responding, it should be noted that\nthis method differs from other survey research methods,\nin that the current study did not employ numerous fol-\nlow-up attempts or refusal conversion efforts. Further,\nbias is defined as the difference between the sample esti-\nmate and the true population estimate. If the results from\nother nationally representative data systems (e.g.,\nNSDUH, NESARC) are used as the \"true\" gold standard\npopulation estimates, then comparing our results as the\nsample estimates to those found in other studies as the\npopulation estimates reveals no appreciable degree of\nbias. In addition to the studies noted above (e.g.,\nNESARC, MTF), a direct comparison of estimates between\nthe current study and the 2005 NSDUH, the most meth-\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nodologically parallel study, for variables that were not\nused in our weighting procedures suggests that we\nreduced to a large degree the potential biases resulting\nfrom the sample selection for the online survey. In addi-\ntional analyses not shown, we also estimated parallel\nregression models using the 2005 NSDUH and our Inter-\nnet sample. For the outcomes of past-year marijuana use\nand past-month binge alcohol use, we observed high con-\nsistency in the estimated odds ratios for common demo-\ngraphic characteristics measured in both studies. The\nprimary difference in the estimates for these variables was\nthat the width of the confidence interval around each esti-\nmate was wider in the Internet study than in the NSDUH.\nThis could be expected given the differences in the sample\nsizes between the NSDUH (N = 32,104) and our study (N\n= 4,297). If bias existed in the propensity score algorithm\nused to generate the sample weights, we would have\nexpected to observe differences in the estimates in addi-\ntion to the confidence intervals. Epidemiologic studies of\nNMU of ADHD drugs can suffer from other biases inher-\nent to sample selection, such as samples drawn from clin-\nical populations, local or regional samples, or samples of\ndemographic subgroups that are accessible for surveys\n(e.g., students). Therefore, we believe that our study adds\nto the base of knowledge about NMU of ADHD medica-\ntions through its national focus and depth of coverage of\nrelevant issues.\nWe note that the value of the Internet panel design is\nmeant to complement, not replace a national probability\nstudy. Internet surveys may be a promising approach for\nconducting formative research or gathering information\non a focused topic for less time and expense than other\nsurvey methods. Internet panels are burgeoning in many\ncountries around the world, and this study design is\nappearing in the research literature with greater frequency.\napproach to examine the psychological reaction to the ter-\nthe Harris Interactive Online Poll, a panel with several\nmillion members in 125 countries, to examine patterns of\nsmoking cessation. Their combined sample consisted of\n2,009 participants from the United States, Canada, the\nUnited Kingdom, and France. They compared characteris-\ntics of cigarette smokers from a standing Internet panel\nwho were selected for the study to characteristics of smok-\ners in national data systems in each respective country and\nfound a high degree of correspondence on major demo-\ngraphic characteristics. In particular, the rapidity with\nwhich Internet surveys can be conducted may open new\nopportunities for cross-national studies of NMU of pre-\nscription medications. Under careful methodological\nrigor, this approach may be favorable to a small face-to-\nface survey or a large telephone survey. Nevertheless,\nresults from an Internet design should be regarded as pre-\nliminary estimates that should be replicated using\nnational probability samples.\nConclusion\nGiven these considerations, this research has important\nimplications for addiction research and policy. Future\nstudies, perhaps using longitudinal designs, should con-\nsider examining factors that may be important for the ini-\ntiation of NMU, progression to abuse or dependence, and\ntransitions to other drugs, such as methamphetamine.\nThese studies might examine the relevant contributions of\naccess to medications, attitudes toward use, and motiva-\ntions for use as they relate to these varying trajectories over\ntime. Additional studies may also consider examining the\nuse of specific ADHD medication formulations, such as\nlong-acting versus short-acting medications, as well as the\nprevalence of NMU formulations in relation to different\nprescribing practices across various geographic areas.\nIn terms of public policy, regulatory options to discourage\ndiversion may be limited. In the United States, for exam-\nple, many of these medications are already under the\nhighest level of Federal regulation for legally approved\ncontrolled substances (i.e., Schedule II under the Control-\nled Substances Act). Nevertheless, about 20% of NMUs\nobtained diverted ADHD medications directly from phy-\nsicians, with a much smaller percentage (5%) obtaining\nthem from Internet pharmacies. Thus, further education\nmay be needed to aid physicians in recognizing when\npatients are attempting to obtain ADHD medications\nfraudulently. Legislation also may be needed to create\nadditional prescription drug monitoring programs at the\nstate level or stricter penalties for lax prescribing practices\nfor ADHD medications.\nFormulation of medications also plays a significant role in\ndrug abuse [60]. Therefore, decisions about which medi-\ncations are included in insurance providers' formularies\ncould affect ADHD medication prescribing practices and\ncould decrease the availability of those ADHD medica-\ntions with greater abuse liability.\nConsistent with other research, however, this current\nstudy showed that persons with prescriptions for ADHD\nmedications were the leading source of diverted medica-\ntions. For example, a study of ADHD stimulant diversion\namong college students at a Midwestern university found\npeers to be the most common sources of diverted prescrip-\nNSDUH also reported that the most recent stimulants\nused nonmedically were provided by friends or relatives\n[14]. About 35% of NMUs in our study who did not have\na prescription of their own were estimated to have stolen\nADHD medications. Thus, some people who have a pre-\nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nscription to treat ADHD may unknowingly be supplying\nADHD medications that are taken without their permis-\nsion.\nBecause friends and family are important sources of\ndiverted medications, education of patients with prescrip-\ntions for ADHD medications will be important in reduc-\ning the risk of NMU and deterring informal distribution to\nfamily and friends. As such, intervention programs should\nbe developed to educate patients regarding the potential\nfor diversion, whether the medications are intentionally\nshared or taken without the patient's knowledge.\nFinally, the use of this Internet survey methodology may\nbe relevant to policy makers with limited budgets who are\nseeking timely information on a relatively low-prevalence\nphenomenon in a target population. Again, this method-\nology would not supplant national probability surveys. If\nan external data source exists for use as a benchmark,\nhowever, this data collection method could provide pol-\nicy makers and planners with usable information in a rel-\natively short amount of time.\nCompeting interests\nThere are no financial competing interests.
