    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent restatements of the case for routine circumcision of normal male infants and boys typically base their arguments on a\nrange of medical evidence showing circumcision to have a protective effect against certain pathological conditions. It is then\nassumed that this evidence leads automatically to a clinical recommendation that circumcision should either be \"considered\"\nor strongly urged. Closer analysis reveals that the recommendation of infant or child circumcision has less to do with the\nmedical benefits than with the historic origins of the procedure, the convenience to the operator and the status of the\npatient. It is further suggested that it is not clear that the medical benefits of infant or child circumcision outweigh the risks\nand harms, and that this style of advocacy fails to pay due regard to basic principles of bioethics and human rights that are\naccepted in other areas of medical practice.\n",

When\nchallenged on these points, advocates argue that infancy is\nthe best time for the operation because it is simpler and\ncheaper at that age, provides the greatest benefits, and per-\nmits parental choice. In this article, it is argued that these\npropositions are medically and logically questionable, that it\nis far from certain that circumcision provides significant net\nbenefit to males in developed countries, and that the prefer-\nence for circumcising infants (rather than recommending the\noperation as a health precaution to competent adults) has\nmore to do with history, habit, and power than with the inter-\nests of the child.\nNTC of normal male infants and boys has been such a\nfamiliar feature of Anglophone medical practice that it is dif-\nficult to appreciate what an anomaly it is. Surgical removal\nof body parts normally requires proof of pathology, efforts at\nnon-surgical (medical) cure, and valid informed consent. In\nthe case of circumcision of healthy male minors, none of\nthese conditions is met. In this article, it is argued that the\nreasons for this peculiarity are not to be found in the familiar\nlitany of benefits and risks advanced by circumcision advo-\ncates and financially interested providers; they must rather\nbe sought in the history of medical knowledge, the structure\nof the profession, and the advance of technology. As histo-\nrian David Gollaher points out, had circumcision not become\nestablished in Anglophone societies in the Victorian era, and\nin view of the development of evidence-based medicine, the\nadvance of bioethics and the recognition of children's rights\nsince that time, \"no physician would dream of proposing\nsuch a thing today.\" Furthermore, considering the parallel\n1Independent Scholar, Curtin, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nRobert Darby, Independent Scholar, 15 Morehead Street, Curtin,\nAustralian Capital Territory 2605, Australia.\nEmail: robert.darbyact@gmail.com\nTargeting Patients Who Cannot Object?\nRe-Examining the Case for Non-\nTherapeutic Infant Circumcision\nRobert Darby1\n Keywords\ncircumcision, minors, consent, bioethics, human rights, sexually transmitted infections, child health\n2 SAGE Open\ncase of female genital cutting/mutilation, he suggests that if\n\"circumcision [of boys] were confined to developing nations,\nit would by now have emerged as an international cause cele-\nbre, stirring passionate opposition from . . . the global human\nrights community\" (Gollaher, 2000, p. xiv). Although there\nare community-based anti-circumcision movements in many\ncountries, particularly the United States, it remains true that\nthe response from mainstream human rights and bioethical\ninstitutions has been surprisingly muted (Carpenter, 2014).\nA Brief History of Routine Medical\nCircumcision\nCircumcision of boys was introduced in mid-19th-century\nUnited Kingdom and United States as a means of controlling\nmanifestations of juvenile sexuality (principally \"masturba-\ntion,\" by which was meant any fondling of the genitals) and\nas a treatment for what became known as \"congenital phimo-\ninfluence of nerve force theory, phimosis (i.e., a tight and/or\nnon-retractable foreskin) was blamed for a host of pathologi-\ncal conditions, from epilepsy to bed-wetting. It was also seen\nas an incitement to penis fondling, and thus to masturbation,\nthen regarded as both a moral crime and the cause of many\ndiseases, both real and imaginary,2 and behavioral problems.\nAt first, circumcision was performed ad hoc on boys caught\nplaying with their penis or found to have an adherent or oth-\nerwise non-retractable foreskin. But as doctors discovered\nthe scale of these problems--hardly surprising, as nearly all\nboys masturbated, and a tight, non-retractable foreskin is the\nnormal condition of the juvenile penis (Agarwal, Mohta, &\nit was their duty as far-sighted health providers to take action\nbefore these problems produced their damaging conse-\nquences. The transition of circumcision from a case-by-case\ntherapy to a general prophylactic was registered in Dr.\nNorman Chapman's observation that the incidence of adhe-\nsive foreskins was probably far higher than people realized.\nBecause \"a long and contracted foreskin\" was so often a\nsource of \"secondary complications,\" he proposed in 1882\nthat it was \"always good surgery to correct this deformity . . .\nas a precautionary measure, even though no symptoms have\nmight well have been following the advice of Erichsen's\nSo great are the evils resulting not only from congenital phimosis,\nbut from an abnormally long, though not phimotic, prepuce, that\nit is only humane and right from a moral point of view, to practise\nearly circumcision in all such cases.

(4) It prevents the retention of\nsebaceous secretion and consequent balanitis. (5) It probably\npromotes continence by diminishing the pruriency of the sexual\nAs Gollaher (2000) remarks, these declarations and many\nlike them represent an important transition in thought:\nCircumcision becomes not just a treatment for existing prob-\nlems, but an anticipatory intervention designed to prevent\npossible problems in the future.\nBy the turn of the century, it was accepted that circumci-\nsion was generally desirable as a means of preventing mastur-\nbation, phimosis, venereal disease, certain forms of cancer,\nand various minor penis problems loosely grouped under the\ncatch-all heading of \"balanitis,\" as well as reducing the male\nsex drive (Darby, 2005). Most of the real medical problems in\nthis list occurred in adults rather than children, but because\nadult men were not exhibiting much eagerness to get them-\nselves circumcised, the doctors concentrated on the younger\ngeneration. As Gollaher (2000) sums up, \"The ultimate popu-\nlarity of circumcision depended not on convincing normal\nmen to undergo the ordeal of surgery, but on targeting a group\nof patients who could not object\" (p. 100). Take-up of the\nprocedure was inhibited, however, by the difficulty of the\noperation (often quite messy and bloody, especially in infants\nand young boys), the lack of suitable instruments, and the\nhigh incidence of complications, including deaths from infec-\ntion and bleeding. These obstacles were gradually overcome\nby the progress of aseptic surgery and, in the 1930s, with the\ndevelopment of effective antibiotics and a purpose-built\ndevice--the Gomco clamp. This was the brainchild of U.S.\ngynecologist HiramYellen and businessmanAaron Goldstein,\nowner of the Goldstein Manufacturing Company (Yellen,\n1935). They claimed to have invented an instrument so ele-\ngant in design and so simple to use that even an untrained\nintern, accoucheur or general practitioner (GP) could easily\nperform circumcision procedures with a negligible incidence\nof complications and a neat result. Whatever the truth of those\nclaims, the device took off, and it remains the instrument of\nchoice among U.S. circumcision providers to this day, rivaled\nGuttmacher, professor of obstetrics at Johns Hopkins, recom-\nmended the \"gadget,\" and discussed \"phimosis\" (foreskin\ntightness) and prevention of masturbation among the reasons\nthe baby should be circumcised (Guttmacher, 1941).\nThe ubiquity of routine infant circumcision in the United\nStates was thus the result, not of any clinical trials or other\nresearch demonstrating the value of circumcision in improving\nchild health, but of a power play within the medical profession\nand the temptations of technology. The Gomco clamp allowed\nthe obstetricians to become the dominant players in the circum-\ncision market, replacing the midwives who had previously\nbeen responsible, and cutting out the pediatricians and urolo-\ngists (who were left with the task of repairing the botches)\nbecause they could perform the operation as a routine part of\nthe childbirth process at a significantly lower cost to the par-\nents: Unlike operations performed by surgeons, Gomco cir-\ncumcisions were done without anesthetic. Contrary to Yellen's\nclaim, the Gomco did not ensure \"bloodless\" surgery, but its\ndesign characteristics did produce a standardized, radically\ndenuded organ, which has come to be widely regarded as the\n\"normal\" condition of the U.S. penis. Specialists in women's\nhealth and midwifery thus became the branch of the medical\nprofession with prime responsibility for delicate operations on\nintimate parts of the male body of which they had no expert\nknowledge, and it was the incorporation of circumcision as a\nroutine phase of childbirth that has been the most important\nfactor in the persistence of NTC in the United States (Cohen,\nthis division of professional responsibilities in other countries\nthat adopted circumcision (the United Kingdom, New Zealand,\nAustralia, Canada) helps to explain why routine circumcision\nhas largely died out in these regions. The fact that it was the\npediatricians who saw the complications helps to explain why\nthey were the ones who took the initiative in discouraging the\nThe importance of the obstetricians in promoting routine\ncircumcision of infants is further highlighted by a key paper\nfrom 1953 that consolidated the principle that the earlier cir-\ncumcision was performed, the better. According to the authors,\nRichard Miller and Donald Snyder, the principal \"indications\"\nfor circumcision were to promote \"hygiene\" and to prevent\nphimosis, venereal disease, and cancer of the penis. Additional\n(disputed) advantages were to discourage masturbation,\nincrease the male libido, and promote longevity. Despite the\nfact that the only real benefits in this list accrue to adults rather\nthan children, the authors went on to list nine additional reasons\nas to why circumcision should ideally be performed immedi-\nately after birth, and certainly before mother and child are dis-\ncharged from the hospital. These include (a) greater safety, (b)\nlower incidence of complications, (c) faster healing, (d) conve-\nnience, (e) opportunity for close observation, (f) simpler to\nensure sterile environment, (g) operation wakes sleepy babies\nup,3 (h) faster healing and lower incidence of infection, and (i)\nless pain than if done later.\nThe authors had little evidence for any of these assertions,\nbut it is clear that the most important factors in their mind\nwere not the health and well-being of the child, but expedi-\nency and cost. As they explain under the \"Convenience\"\nheading,\nPrior to this new plan . . . a line-up on Sunday morning was\nroutine. It meant an extra hospital trip, a good deal of unavoidable\ndelay between cases, and the resulting traffic problem in the\nbirth rooms was prodigious. Under the present regime the\nobstetrician finishes his episiotomy, walks across the hall and\ncircumcises the infant, and is finished with the whole business.\nThe time saved for both the physician and nursing staff is\nSo impressed were Miller and Snyder with the efficiency\nof their production line that they returned to its advantages in\ntheir conclusion, there making the additional points that\n\"there is no conflict in the scheduling of cases, and no babies\nare forgotten and left uncircumcised\" (p. 10). For all those\nreasons, \"as well as those of economy, convenience, safety,\nrapidity of healing and close observation,\" they continued,\n\"we feel that immediate circumcision of the newborn male\ninfant might well be more universally adopted\" (p. 10). As\nindeed it was, though only in North America. Although the\npractice became rare in the United Kingdom and began to\ndecline in Australia and New Zealand during the 1950s, rou-\ntine circumcision did not reach its peak incidence in the\nThe New (African) Evidence\nRoutine circumcision declined in the 1970s after critical\nstatements from pediatric health bodies in Australia, Canada,\nand the United States,4 the aim of which was to try to halt a\npractice that their 19th-century forebears had initiated.\nWhereas these efforts had a substantial impact in Australia\nand a moderate impact in Canada, they made only a small\ndifference to the incidence of circumcision in the United\nStates, where large sections of the medical profession\nremained committed to the belief in the value of the opera-\ntion. The effect of this intransigence has been to spawn two\ncontradictory trends: a vigorous, community-based anti-cir-\ncumcision movement; and in response to this, a reassertion\nof Victorian arguments for the medical benefits of circumci-\nsion, fortified with \"new evidence\" whenever available.\nLike their predecessors, the new generation of advocates\nrely most heavily on evidence that circumcision has a protec-\ntive effect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs),\nespecially HIV.5 The problem is that children are not sexu-\nally active; that most of this \"new evidence\" is from studies\nof circumcision of adult males, not infants; and that it derives\nfrom African countries with very different social and epide-\nmiological environments from those in the developed West\n(Green et al., 2010). Whether or not the evidence from the\nclinical trials is sufficient to justify the massive scale of the\nAfrican circumcision programs, advocates of widespread\ncircumcision in developed countries stretch it far beyond its\nlogical and geographical limits, asserting that it constitutes a\n\"compelling\" argument (a) for circumcising infants and (b)\napplying the programs universally, regardless of the local\nconditions, no matter how different they may be from the\n4 SAGE Open\nregions where the evidence was generated (Bossio, Pukall, &\nSteele, 2014). The rhetorical maneuver by which they\nachieve these leaps should be examined because it involves a\ncluster of logical errors and failures of ethical awareness that\ninhibit clear thinking about the ethics, benefits, risks, and\nharms of NTC as a medically rationalized procedure in\ndeveloped nations.\nThe fundamental flaw in this argument is that it rests on a\nlogical fallacy that may be called the health benefits logical\nslide. It comes in two forms. The original form conflates\nchildren and adults as subjects of medical concern and of\nethical consideration:\n1. A range of evidence suggests that the surgical\nremoval of the adult foreskin may reduce a male's\nrisk of contracting certain infectious diseases to\nwhich he may later be exposed and may also alleviate\nsome other potential problems.\n2. It follows that doctors should remove the foreskin of\nall infant males as a routine precaution.\nThe second form of this fallacy is a more recent develop-\nment, modeled on the first, which fails to distinguish not\nonly between adults and children but also between sub-Saha-\nran Africa and developed (Western) nations with radically\ndifferent social and epidemiological environments:\n1. Three clinical trials and some other evidence suggest\nthat in the sub-Saharan African environment, surgical\nremoval of the foreskin may significantly reduce a\nmale's risk of contracting HIV through unprotected\nheterosexual intercourse.\n2. It follows that doctors should remove the foreskin of\nall infant males as a precaution against HIV/AIDS,\nnot only in sub-Saharan Africa but also in the United\nStates and in other developed nations.\nExpressed as baldly as this, the non-sequiturs involved in\nthe above arguments should be evident. Yet, in various forms,\nthe logical leap from (1) to (2) in the original form of the fal-\nlacy has been marketed relentlessly by circumcision advo-\ncates over the past decade. So ingrained in Anglophone\ncountries is the idea that circumcision means circumcision of\ninfants that we even hear the term \"elective circumcision\"\nused to mean, not a free choice by an adult for himself, but\nrather parents making the decision on behalf of a child\n(\"Should Elective Circumcision,\" 2012). The second form is\na recent refinement but suffers from the same flaws. Both\narguments appear regularly in both the popular media and in\nprofessional journals, both prestigious and obscure (Cooper,\n& Gray, 2011).6 For those committed to evidence-based and\nethically aware medical practice, the uncritical acceptance of\nthis sort of rhetoric by the media and health authorities\nshould be a cause for concern.\nThe first objection to these arguments is that the original\npremise of both--that the surgical removal of the foreskin con-\nfers lifelong health benefits that exceed the risks of surgery and\nthe harms of losing a visually prominent and sexually functional\nbody part--has not been established. Reviews of this question\nby competent authorities (such asAustralian Safety and Efficacy\nRegister of New Interventional Procedures [ASERNIP], 2008;\nHutcheson, 2004; Perera, Bridgewater, Thavaneswaran, &\nMaddern, 2010) have failed to confirm the claims of significant\nbenefit, and after a detailed review of the evidence, Malone and\nSteinbrecher (2007) conclude that the only indications for cir-\ncumcision in childhood were intractable cases of phimosis\ncaused by balanitis xerotica obliterans and recurrent balanopos-\nthitis. Surveys by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation\nthat children in the United States (where circumcision is com-\nmon) fare less well on several heath indicators than in compara-\nbly developed European countries where circumcision is rare.\nThere are certainly many confounding socio-economic factors\nin play here, but health statistics do not support the proposition\nthat circumcision improves child health outcomes. Studies in\nAustralia (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW],\n2010) similarly bear out the converse: that a substantial decline\nin circumcision incidence did not lead to worse child health\noutcomes.\nThe Opinion of Child Health\nAuthorities\nIt is also significant that, with one semi-exception, all the medi-\ncal organizations that have issued policy statements on infant\nor child circumcision have found that there is no justification\nfor it as a routine health precaution.7 The exception is the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), whose 2012 policy\nstatement has been widely (though inaccurately) interpreted as\na recommendation for circumcision. In fact, the AAP does not\nrecommend the operation or regard it as medically necessary,\nbut concludes merely that the benefits exceed the risks. Even\nthis moderate position has been criticized on empirical grounds\nby child health experts (Frisch et al., 2013) and on logical and\nphilosophical grounds by others (Darby, 2015; Svoboda & Van\nHowe, 2013).8 What is interesting about the AAP policy is not\nits central contention, but a couple of subsidiary conclusions\nthat are not backed up by any real evidence at all: first, that it is\nlegitimate for parents and doctors to circumcise for cultural and\nreligious reasons; and second, that it is appropriate for medical\ninsurance systems (both government and private) to pay for cir-\ncumcision procedures. To take the second point first, the AAP\noffers no argument as to why it is acceptable for systems\nintended to improve health to pay for cultural or religious ritu-\nals. As Adler (2011) argues, if a medical procedure is neither\nclinically necessary nor recommended, it may be unlawful for\nMedicare to fund it.\nAs to the first point, I do not wish to make an argument\nabout the ethics of religious and culturally motivated\ncircumcision, but point out that the timing of the operation in\nthese instances is not dictated by health considerations or the\nbest interests of the child, but by the traditions of the culture.\nMost circumcising cultures perform the operation around\npuberty, signifying the boy's (and in most cases also the girl's)\ntransition from childhood to adult responsibility. Exceptions to\nthis pattern are found in Islam, which sets no specific age and\nimposes no obligation on parents to circumcise their children\n(AldeebAbu-Sahlieh, 1994); and in Judaism, which (uniquely)\nprescribes circumcision in early infancy (the eighth day). There\nwas never any \"health logic\" to these rules, which were purely\na matter of tribal custom or religious tradition (Glick, 2005).\nAs indicated above, the AAP is quite isolated in its sup-\nport for circumcision, moderate and equivocal though it is.\nMore typical of world opinion are the policies of the Royal\nAustralasian College of Physicians (RACP) and the Canadian\nPaediatric Society (CPS). After a comprehensive analysis of\nthe relevant literature, the RACP concluded that \"the fre-\nquency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of\nprotection offered by circumcision and the complication\nrates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumci-\nsion in Australia or New Zealand\" (RACP, 2010, p. 5). The\nCPS, Fetus and Newborn Committee (2015) concurs, \"While\nthere may be a benefit for some boys in high-risk populations\n. . . the Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend the\nroutine circumcision of every newborn male\" (p. 311). What\nmakes the position of both these bodies all the more signifi-\ncant is that they reached this conclusion on the basis of a\nnarrow calculus of risks and benefits and paid little attention\nto the value of the foreskin to the individual and his possible\nwishes in later life. There has never been a comprehensive\nassessment of the complications of circumcision, some of\nwhich (such as excessive tissue removal, leading to uncom-\nfortable erections) may not become evident until after\npuberty (Peterson, 2001). The value of the foreskin itself as a\nfunctional body part that the individual might want to keep\nand enjoy has rarely been factored into such harm\u00adbenefit\ncalculations as have been attempted.9 Both the reviews men-\ntioned above and the policy statements of medical authorities\nacknowledge evidence from Africa that circumcision of\nadult males can reduce their risk of acquiring HIV through\nunprotected intercourse with an infected female partner in\nregions of high heterosexual HIV prevalence. But they point\nout that these conditions are not present in developed coun-\ntries and that children, not being sexually active, are not at\nrisk of sexually transmitted HIV (Bossio et al., 2014; Lyons,\n2013). It is, therefore, far from clear that circumcision does\nconfer the benefits claimed by its promoters, undermining\nthe premise of both versions of the argument outlined above.\nQuestions of Logic and Evidence\nThese considerations bring us to the next stage of the argu-\nment: that even if premise 1--that circumcision did confer\nlifelong health benefits--were granted, it would not follow\nthat the operation may ethically be performed on minors. The\nargument of those who advocate routine neonatal circumci-\nsion is now so familiar that it hardly needs detailed exposi-\ntion: The health benefits of circumcision accrue to the\ncircumcised infant, on a probabilistic basis, at future points\nin his life, some in infancy or childhood, but the bulk (and\nmost significant) in adulthood. They include such advan-\ntages as a reduced risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), phi-\nmosis and minor penile problems in childhood, and of STIs\nand rare forms of cancer in maturity. This list corresponds\nclosely to the Victorian trilogy that circumcision prevented\nmasturbation in childhood, syphilis in maturity, and cancer in\nold age (Darby, 2005). The principal pillar of the case for\ncircumcision is not, therefore, the claim that it meets the\nhealth needs of the infant or child, but that it improves the\nhealth prospects of the adult he will later become. These\nfuture benefits, it is claimed, not only outweigh the risks and\nharms (physical, psychological, and emotional) of the proce-\ndure but also justify (or even require) the widespread adop-\ntion of circumcision as a preventive measure of public health.\nNone of these claims follows logically from the evidence.\nBecause the major benefits claimed--reduction in the risk of\nSTIs (including HIV)--can be enjoyed only by mature and\nsexually active males, the logical prescription arising from\nthe premise is to provide the information to young adults and\nallow them to elect to have their own foreskins removed if\nthey judge it to be prudent and are willing to face the risks\nand losses. This would correspond to voluntary medical male\ncircumcision (VMMC), as recommended by the World\nHealth Organisation in regions with epidemic levels of het-\nerosexually transmitted HIV and low circumcision preva-\nlence. The fact that few adult males in developed nations do\nchoose to have themselves circumcised,10 and that forcing\nmen to submit to circumcision would be a criminal assault\nunder any legal code (or, if legally sanctioned, a gross viola-\ntion of personal autonomy and individual human rights), is in\nitself a powerful argument that it would be unethical to per-\nform the same operation on infants or children, who cannot\nresist.\nHealth Benefits of Circumcision\nThe health benefits claimed for circumcision fall into three\ncategories: (a) benefits to the person as a child, (b) benefits to\nhim as an adult, and (c) benefits to hypothetical third\nparties.\nChildren\nIf pathological phimosis and UTIs (the principal benefits\nclaimed for early circumcision) were as common and as\ninfectious as, say, chicken pox and frequently fatal (or as\ncrippling as polio); if there were no effective treatments; and\nif all boys were at equally high risk of these problems, it\nmight indeed be ethical to circumcise them in infancy as a\n6 SAGE Open\nprecaution. These conditions do not, however, apply.\nPathological (as opposed to physiological) phimosis11 is an\nuncommon condition, affecting approximately 0.6% of boys\nally curable by application of steroid ointment (Ashfield,\nNickel, Siemens, MacNeily, & Nickel, 2003; Shankar &\nRickwood, 1999). Minor penis problems grouped under the\nheading \"balanitis,\" if they arise, can usually be treated with-\nout the need for surgery (Edwards, Bunker, Ziller, & van der\nMeijden, 2014). Although severe persistent phimosis plus\npoor hygiene may increase the risk of cancer of the penis in\nlater life, it is not in itself a pathological condition, and in\nmost cases causes little more harm than intermittent discom-\nfort. Any adult so inconvenienced can easily take the neces-\nsary medical or surgical steps. UTIs are also a rare condition,\naffecting about 8% of girls and 2% of boys by age 7, and\nusually associated with congenital abnormalities of the uri-\nnary tract or bladder, or a preterm birth; most cases are read-\nily cured with antibiotics (Sureshkumar, Jones, Cumming, &\nCraig, 2009). Persistent recurrent infections may be an indi-\ncation for circumcision, but that is no justification for per-\nforming the operation in advance of proven pathology (Na,\nTanny, & Hutson, 2015; Williams, Hodson, Isaacs, & Craig,\n(Marild, Hansson, Jodal, Od\u00e9n, & Svedberg, 2004).\nAdults\nThe benefits of circumcision to adult males are said to be\nreduced risk of STIs (including HIV) and cancer of the penis.\nThe first point to make is that there is no consistent evidence\nthat circumcision does reduce the risk of STIs: Some studies\nshow uncircumcised men to be at greater risk of some STIs;\nothers that there is no difference; and yet others that circum-\ncised men are at greater risk of some infections.13 There is\ncertainly no evidence that a high incidence of circumcision is\ndoing anything to restrain the spread of STIs in the United\nStates, which exhibits a far higher STI incidence than Europe,\nwhere circumcision is rare (Centers for Disease Control,\ngonorrhea, and syphilis has declined steadily in Europe since\n1980, in the United States the incidence of all three has\nsteadily increased, and the incidence of gonorrhea is 20 times\nwith about five in Europe. Even more alarming is the far\nhigher incidence of HIV in the United States, particularly in\nsome cities: Washington, D.C., reports an incidence of 179.56\nsub-Saharan Africa (\"Americans Are More Likely to Have an\nThese comparisons might be rejected on the basis that\nthey suffer from the \"ecological fallacy\"--that broad popu-\nlation groups cannot validly be compared for statistical pur-\nposes because this does not allow specific variables, such as\ncircumcision status, to be distinguished. It could be claimed,\nfor example, that in Europe, all the STI cases occur in uncir-\ncumcised men and none in the circumcised. Against this\ngambit, there is an increasing body of specifically U.S.\nresearch comparing circumcised with uncircumcised men\nshowing that circumcision does not reduce the risk of STI\ntransmission or may even increase it. A study of men attend-\ning sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States\n(Crosby & Charnigo, 2013) found that circumcised men had\ndouble the incidence of STIs and were significantly less\nlikely to use condoms. This is the first U.S. study of condom\nuse that compared circumcised with normal men, and reached\na conclusion strongly at variance with the popular perception\nthat circumcised men are less susceptible to STIs and find it\neasier to use condoms. On the contrary, as Crosby and\nThese findings suggest quite the opposite in that intact men were\nless likely to report UVS [unprotected vaginal sex] and less\nlikely to report infrequent condom use compared with their\ncircumcised counterparts. These two observations are quite\nconsistent with the descriptive finding that showed a greater\nthan two-fold past history of STIs for circumcised men compared\nA further study (Crosby et al., 2015), this time of men\nwho have sex with men (MSM) in a southern U.S. city with\nan \"extremely high\" HIV prevalence, found that there was no\ndifference in the incidence of HIV and other STIs between\ncircumcised and uncircumcised partners. The study also\nfound that circumcised men were twice as likely not to wear\na condom when taking the active role in intercourse. The key\npoint is that because condoms (even if worn inconsistently)\nare the most effective means of HIV prevention, anything\nthat discourages condom use raises the risk of infection with\nHIV and other STIs.\nThe second point is that the greatest risk factor for all these\ndiseases is a multiplicity of sexual partners, meaning that they\ncan be avoided by appropriate behavioral choices: care in\nselection of partners and commitment to safe sex, including\nconsistent condom use in penetrative sex. The third point is\nthat most STIs are readily cured with antibiotics. An adult\nmale is entitled to choose circumcision in preference to a\ncourse of penicillin, but it is far from an obviously rational\ndecision, and it is certainly not one that an adult is entitled to\nmake on behalf of a child. HIV remains incurable (though no\nlonger fatal and now manageable by anti-retroviral therapy),\nbut adult males are at high risk of STIs only if they engage in\nhigh-risk sexual behavior. In the developed world, moreover,\nunlike in Africa, HIV is not a heterosexual epidemic, but a\nrelatively rare disease largely confined to the sub-cultures\nwhere it originated: homosexual men and injecting drug\nusers, neither of which groups derives any risk reduction\nthe only means by which children could contract HIV is\nthrough surgical procedures and blood transfusions, it is not\nnecessary to circumcise them as a precaution.\nIn the case of genital cancers and human papilloma virus\n(HPV), similar points apply. Since the days of Jonathan\nHutchinson (Darby, 2005), circumcision advocates have\nmade much of the value of circumcision in preventing cancer\nof the penis (Morris et al., 2011). Whether or not it does so is\nless significant than the fact that penile cancer is a rare dis-\nease of older men--so rare that accurate statistics on inci-\ndence are difficult to find, and so rare that it is even less\ncommon than male breast cancer. The American Cancer\ndeaths. If prophylactic removal of infant male breasts is not\nrecommended as a breast cancer preventive, there is cer-\ntainly no need for prophylactic removal of the foreskin as a\npenile cancer preventive. Replying to recent media claims,\nthe Australian Cancer Council (2012) warns that the evi-\ndence of circumcision having a protective effect was not suf-\nficient to justify the operation on children. Because cancer of\nthe penis is usually associated with severe, persistent phimo-\nsis, an adult male can reduce the danger by seeking either\nmedical or surgical treatment for the condition. Because\nHPV--certain strains of which are now thought to be a caus-\native or predisposing agent--is spread by sexual contact, it is\nan infection that only sexually active adults can contract, and\nthere is no conclusive evidence from developed countries\nthat uncircumcised men are at any greater risk than the cir-\nWeaver et al., 2004). The introduction of an effective vaccine\nfor both girls and boys, moreover, offers far greater protec-\ntion than anything conferred by surgical alteration of the\ngenital anatomy. An adult male may prefer to get himself cir-\ncumcised instead, but that does not oblige him to impose this\noption on his children.\nThird Parties\nThe third category is benefits to hypothetical others, namely,\nthe suggestion that boys ought to be circumcised to reduce\nthe risk of cervical cancer in future female sexual partners.\nAs Darby (2015) argues, however, the idea is morally unten-\nable, for even if it were true that having an uncircumcised\npartner increased a woman's risk of HPV infection and thus\ncervical cancer, it is not ethically permissible to remove the\noffending body part from a non-consenting child on the basis\nthat he might later become infected with HPV and might then\ngo on to infect hypothetical sexual partners sometime in the\nfuture. Nobody would regard it as ethically acceptable to\ntake a child's blood, bone marrow, or any internal organ,\neven if the transaction were sure to benefit another person\nwho might die without them; it cannot, therefore, be ethical\nto remove a child's foreskin in the hope of providing a less\nsubstantial benefit (risk reduction) to somebody whose iden-\ntity is unknown. As Beauchamp and Childress (2009)\ncomment,\nObligations of non-maleficence are more stringent than\nobligations of beneficence, and in some cases non-maleficence\noverrides beneficence, even if the best utilitarian outcome could\nbe obtained by acting beneficently. If a surgeon, for example,\ncould save two innocent lives by killing a prisoner on death row\nto retrieve his heart and liver for transplantation, this outcome\nwould have the highest net utility . . . but the surgeon's actions\nwould be morally indefensible. (p. 150)\nWith rare exceptions, medical interventions are permissi-\nble only when they are intended to benefit the person being\ntreated. While it is legitimate for a donor to supply bone mar-\nrow or a kidney, even though the operation benefits only the\nrecipient, this is on the basis that the donor volunteers and\nunderstands what is at stake. It would be a gross violation of\nmedical ethics for any body part to be taken by force or with-\nout informed consent, no matter how great the advantage to\nthe recipient.\nBioethical and Human Rights Principles\nBecause most circumcision advocacy places little emphasis\non bioethical and human rights issues, it is well to be reminded\nof the basic principles of bioethics as set out by Beauchamp\nand Childress (2009): autonomy (requiring respect for\ninformed choice), non-maleficence (not doing harm), benefi-\ncence (doing good), proportionality (ensuring that the out-\ncome of the intervention provides a significant net benefit to\nthe patient in relation to the risks run and the losses sustained),\nand justice (treating the person fairly). To establish the legiti-\nmacy of circumcision of non-consenting children, it is neces-\nsary to show that the operation is consistent with these\nprinciples, but it is difficult to find any circumcision advo-\ncacy that discusses them in detail. Some circumcision advo-\ncates seek to reverse the onus of proof by suggesting that not\ncircumcising a boy is a violation of his human rights because\nit denies him both protection against the health risks attribut-\nable to the foreskin and the advantages accruing from its\nremoval (Bates et al., 2013). But this is to assume that the\nbenefits of circumcision are as great as claimed (the very\npoint in dispute), that the foreskin is worthless and its removal\nnot a deprivation or even a harm, and that the boy's own pos-\nsible future preferences are of no account.\nTo take the question of harm, despite arguments to the con-\ntrary by some moderate (parental choice) supporters of NTC,\nit cannot plausibly be maintained that excision of the foreskin\nis not a harm.15 Removal of normal tissue is not necessarily a\nharm, for few people would be likely to mind if a healthy\nappendix was extracted as a precaution, as it is imperceptible\nand has no psychological significance. The genitals are a dif-\nferent matter: A visually prominent component of a body part\nas sexually significant as the penis will never be regarded with\nthe same indifference, neither by admirers nor detractors.\nSome advocates have likened circumcision to minor surgical\nprocedures such as cleft palate or hare lip repair or even orth-\nodontic treatment; but the comparison fails because these are\n8 SAGE Open\ntherapeutic procedures aimed at restoring anatomical normal-\nity and full physiological functionality. Moreover, as Brian\nEarp (2015b) points out, there is no evidence that the benefi-\nciaries of these interventions object to what was done to them.\nWhile we can observe a voluble anti-circumcision movement\nin the United States and elsewhere,16 and cohorts of men who\ndeeply resent their circumcision and seek to restore their fore-\nskins (Watson, 2015), it is not possible to detect any anti-cleft\nlip repair movements or a surge of online communities dedi-\ncated to recovering their crooked teeth. Leading exponents of\nthe view that parents have the right to circumcise their boys\nacknowledge that circumcision is a harm, but argue that it is\nnot sufficiently harmful to warrant prohibition (Benatar &\nment here is not whether NTC of minors should be illegal, but\nwhether it is of \"compelling\" net medical benefit and ethically\npermissible.\nOpen Future, Best Interests, and\nSubstituted Judgment\nFundamental as they are, the Beauchamp and Childress prin-\nciples are not the only guidelines to be considered when we\nperform surgical procedures on children. There is also the\nquestion of the child's right to an open future, the best inter-\nests and substituted judgment tests, and the increasingly\nprominent matter of human rights. These include a person's\nright to physical integrity, as embodied in much Western law\nand custom, and in certain international human rights treaties\nand declarations. These rights are now generally accepted as\napplying to girls, but if they are human rights they must, logi-\nthe Victorian era that gave birth to circumcision, children\nwere to be seen but not heard and medical ethics were rudi-\nmentary; but during the 20th century, the slow human rights\nrevolution (Pinker, 2011) that began with John Locke reached\nchildren, who are now seen as possessing the same sort of\nrights to bodily integrity and protection from harm that adults\nenjoy (Orend, 2002). This does not mean that children have\nequal rights as adults, but, as Brennan and Noggle (1997)\nargue, that they are entitled to the same moral consideration\nas adults because they are persons. At the same time, chil-\ndren may be treated differently from adults by virtue of their\nimmaturity and dependent status, and parents have real but\nlimited authority to direct their upbringing. As Tobin (2013)\nrecently argues, because children have interests, they also\nhave rights, even though they (temporarily) lack the capacity\nto articulate, much less enforce, them. The concept of the\nchild's right to an open future can provide a bridge between\nthe child's temporary lack of capacity and the preservation of\nhis long-term interests.\nThe child's right to an open future is an accepted principle\nin legal philosophy, applied to bioethical issues by Dena\nsurgical treatment of hypospadias (Carmack, Notini, & Earp,\n2015). The principle holds that children are adults-to-be, and\nthat it is the duty of parents to make efforts to preserve and\nprotect their options so that they can make choices about mat-\nters of personal preference for themselves in adulthood. This\napplies not only to the provision of affection, food, shelter\nand education but also to freedom from irreversible and\npotentially harmful decisions about their body that they might\nlater resent. If this extension is valid, the open future principle\nwould allow parents to compel children to brush their teeth\nand prevent them from getting obtrusive marks such as a tat-\ntoo, a nose-ring, or permanent genital modifications, and at\nthe same time would constrain them from imposing such\nmodifications. It would preclude deaf parents who believe\nthat deafness is a valid culture from deliberately causing their\nchildren to be deaf. Forcing children to clean their teeth, pre-\nventing them from smoking, and preserving their foreskin all\nhave the same rationale and objective: to maintain the body\nfor future use and to ensure that the future adult will be able\nto make his own decisions about such matters when he\nbecomes responsible for his own self-management.\n\"Best interests\" and \"substituted judgment\" are two tests\nthat may be applied when decisions have to be made on\nbehalf of those incompetent to make them for themselves,\nwhether minors or disabled adults. \"Best interests\" are the\nlong-term interests of the person as a person, taking account\nof the society in which he or she lives, interests, skills, hopes,\nwishes, values, self-image (among others), and if a minor the\nperson's interests in the future, as an adult. In the case of Re\nJ--Child's Religious Upbringing and Circumcision (2000),\nfor example, an English court determined that it would not be\nin his best interests for a 6-year-old boy to be circumcised\nmerely because his Muslim father wanted him to be. A simi-\nlar conclusion was reached by the Family Court of Australia\n(2003) in the case of K and H. It would, however, be in the\nchild's best interests to be given necessary therapeutic medi-\ncal treatment, such as a life-saving blood transfusion, even if\nhis parents were Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religion pro-\nhibited such procedures. It would also be in his best interests\nto be vaccinated against serious diseases, such as hepatitis B,\nif he was at risk of infection (say from a parent with the dis-\nease), even if the parents were philosophically opposed to\nvaccination (Isaacs, 2009). In both cases, the child's welfare\ntrumps the parents'wishes. When medical treatment is either\nnecessary to save a person's life, or provides proven and sub-\nstantial benefits (such as immunity to serious diseases) with-\nout harm, loss of body parts or function, and without a\nsignificant risk of complications, it is acceptable to provide it\nwithout the informed consent of the recipient.\nThe other test is the substituted judgment test--the option\nthat an incompetent person would be most likely to choose\nfor himself if he were competent to form and express an\nopinion (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009). Analyzing this\nconcept, the legal scholar James Dwyer (1994) suggests that\nchildren should not have fewer rights than or be treated with\nless consideration than incompetent adults. Dwyer acknowl-\nedges that infants and young children would not have shown\nmuch evidence of preferences on any aspect of their lives,\nbut does not regard this as invalidating the substituted judg-\nment principle so long as there are reasonable grounds for\ndetermining what the incompetent person would choose if he\nor she were competent. One way of establishing the answer\nin relation to medical issues is to ask what competent adults\nchoose when faced with the same question. Most adults\nwould agree to a blood transfusion if it meant the difference\nbetween life and death, and most would agree to get vacci-\nnated against a serious disease if they were likely to be\nexposed to it and at risk of infection. The case of circumci-\nsion is even more clear-cut: Because a negligible number of\nadult men in Western societies elect circumcision for them-\nselves, we may reasonably infer that if the average minor\nwere asked whether he wanted to get circumcised he would\nrefuse.\nThe Case for Infant Circumcision?\nIf the health benefits are not as great as claimed and the\nimportant ones can be secured by voluntary circumcision in\nadulthood, and if the ethical objections to NTC of minors are\ngreater than circumcision advocates allow, it follows that the\ncase for infant circumcision has not been made. The reasons\ngiven for insisting on it in commentaries by Tobian, Gray,\nMorris, and, with less enthusiasm, the AAP17 place too much\nemphasis on the wishes of adults and not enough on the inter-\nests and autonomy of the child. Indeed, they scarcely go\nbeyond the narrow utilitarianism of Miller and Snyder: that it\nis simpler, more convenient, cheaper, less painful, and\nattended with fewer complications than if done later. The\nfirst three points show insufficient regard for the interests of\nthe child, his autonomy, or even his personhood, but focus\nentirely on the needs of adults and impersonal health sys-\ntems. They are questionable because they ignore the funda-\nmental point that medical interventions are not normally\npermissible unless their intent, rationale, and result are to\nbenefit the person being treated. Procedures intended to ben-\nefit other parties, as is the case if they are performed for rea-\nsons of economy, convenience, or simplicity (here meaning\nthat a baby is more easily persuaded than an adult), fail both\nthe non-maleficence and beneficence tests and are plainly\nunacceptable. By analogy, it is probably cheaper and more\nconvenient to have sex with an unwilling 5-year-old than\nwith an unwilling adult, but that does not make the practice\ndesirable.\nIf it is cheaper to circumcise children rather than adults\nthis is only because infants are usually circumcised as part of\nlarger process (the childbirth sequence), with inadequate\nanesthesia, or none at all (Bellieni, Alagna, & Buoncore,\nof the foreskin (Cold & Taylor, 1999), any cutting in that area\nis intensely painful, no matter what the age, but circumcision\nis probably less painful for an adult because he can be given\nboth effective anesthesia and post-operative pain control,\nand he can articulate his needs. To circumcise without effec-\ntive anesthesia would be a gross violation of the non-malefi-\ncence principle and extremely cruel: even supporters of a\nparental right to circumcise regard such an omission as ethi-\ncally unacceptable (Benatar & Benatar, 2003). Research into\nthe effects and complications of circumcision is too inade-\nquate for anybody to know whether it is safer and less harm-\nful in infancy, childhood, or maturity.18 If mere cheapness is\nthe aim of health care, the best policy is to avoid unnecessary\nsurgeries (Van Howe, 2004). The \"increased cost\" argument\nis based on the false assumption that circumcision will be\nnecessary at a later stage: In the vast majority of cases, cir-\ncumcision will not be necessary, meaning that there will be\nno costs at all.\nA disturbing feature of much current circumcision advo-\ncacy is the underlying assumption that the biomedical evi-\ndence \"speaks for itself\"; once the evidence is available,\npublic policy should follow automatically as a logical conse-\nquence. As de Camargo, Mendonca, Perrey, and Giami\n(2015) comment, however, this is a technocratic and authori-\ntarian approach that over-simplifies the complexities of med-\nical decision making, ignores social and other contextual\nfactors, dismisses bioethical and human rights principles as\nnebulous, and considers \"subjective\" issues such as the value\nof the foreskin and the preferences of the individual to be\nirrelevant. Savulescu (2015) similarly warns against the ten-\ndency to \"scientify\" everything: \"Evidence will tell us what\nto do, people believe. But what constitutes sufficient evi-\ndence is an ethical decision,\" as is weighing risk and benefit\n(p. 30). \"Ethics is not peripheral to medicine and research--\nit is central. What you study will determine what you find\"\n(p. 30). We typically hear arguments that circumcision is jus-\ntified or not justified on the basis that the benefits exceed the\nrisks of the surgery or that the risks of surgery exceed the\nbenefits. But the risk\u00adbenefit rule was devised for therapeu-\ntic procedures, where there is a pathological condition that\nrequires treatment. In the case of normal male infants and\nboys, there is no pathology to treat, meaning that circumci-\nsion is a non-therapeutic procedure, and hence should be\ngoverned by far stricter rules. In the case of minors, who by\ndefinition cannot give consent, the rules should be stricter\nstill. Furthermore, as Buchanan (1983) points out, risk\u00adben-\nefit equations are not merely clinical (objective) calculations,\nbut moral judgments about a person's values and how he\nwishes to manage his life. The principal quasi-ethical argu-\nment commonly advanced by circumcision advocates19 is\nthat parents are entitled to make medical decisions for their\nchildren; because it is widely agreed that parents can provide\nsurrogate consent for a child to be vaccinated, they can\nequally provide consent for a child to be circumcised. This\nproposition is highly dubious. Although circumcision advo-\ncates have sought to liken circumcision to vaccination, there\nare fundamental differences in mode of operation, effective-\nness, and personal outcomes, both bodily and psychological\ndoes nothing to support the case for circumcision.\nParental Rights or Parental Duties?\nAs for the parental rights argument, it is not parents who\nneed rights over their children, because they already have\nfull power over them. Parents have authority, but because\nchildren are vulnerable, and infants a powerless and even\nvoiceless group, in need of special protection, they are the\nones who require and possess rights, and society places lim-\nits, both moral and legal, on how parents may treat them.\nParents may not sell their children into slavery, subject them\nto unreasonable corporal punishment, or have sex with them;\non the positive side, they must nurture and care for their chil-\ndren, provide them with an adequate education, and socialize\nthem into the ways of society. It follows that parents do not\nhave an unfettered right to choose medical treatments for\ntheir children, and it has been argued that parents have no\nlegal right to authorize controversial or non-recommended\nmedical treatments for their children, and certainly not if it\ninvolves unnecessary removal of healthy body parts\nwas concerned about the wide discretion conferred by proxy\nconsent and disputed the assumption that parents had \"the\nright to make all medical care decisions involving a minor\nchild.\" Because children, in his view, belonged primarily to\nthemselves, he proposed the following principles for pediat-\nric care:\n1. Any proposed medical intervention that could be delayed,\nwithout significant adverse consequences, until the child\ncould provide his own consent would be prima facie wrong.\n2. Any medical intervention for which there is no demonstrable\nneed would be prima facie wrong--e.g. circumcision.\n3. Any medical intervention that holds out the prospect of\ndemonstrable benefit to the child whose life or well-being\nwere in jeopardy would be prima facie obligatory--e.g.,\nIn other words, what parents have is an obligation to pro-\ntect their children's rights and provide appropriate, beneficial,\nand needed treatment that is manifestly in the child's best\ninterests, has regard to the open future principle, and satisfies\nthe substituted judgment test--that it was a decision a reason-\nable adult would be expected to reach for himself. A parent is\nnot entitled to provide a sick child with harmful, inappropri-\nate, or spurious treatments (such as faith healing or bogus\n\"alternative\" cures), or to deny a healthy child vaccination\nagainst serious diseases of which he is at risk (Isaacs, 2009).\nRejecting the argument that observance of a \"harm threshold\"\nis an adequate yardstick for parental decisions about medical\nparents are not automatically entitled to deny them beneficial\nand necessary treatments; and, it follows that they are not\nentitled to impose harmful or unnecessary treatments. In these\nsituations, medical personnel may be entitled (even morally\nobliged) to override parental wishes, either by insisting on a\nbeneficial intervention to which parents object, or by refusing\nan intervention that parents have sought. It is reasonable for\nparents to have their children vaccinated against the risk of\nfuture diseases because such prophylaxis protects them and\nthe community from diseases that affect them as children and\ndoes not deprive them of a normal body part. Vaccination\nmay thus be assessed as being in the child's best interests and\nalso--as shown by the fact that adult men regularly get them-\nselves vaccinated--as passing the substituted judgment test.\nAs Beauchamp and Childress (2009) point out,\nBest interest judgments are meant to focus attention entirely on\nthe value of the life for the person who must live it, not on the\nvalue of the person's life for others. \"Quality-of-life\" judgments\nalso concern only the individual's best interests, not his or her\nworth to enhance another's quality of life. (p. 140)\nIt follows that, barring a genuine pathological condition for\nwhich circumcision is the only cure, the only person entitled\nto make a health-based decision about such surgery is the\nperson who must live with the consequences.\nRoutine Peripubertal Circumcision?\nRecognizing that if circumcision does offer significant health\nbenefits they do not apply until adulthood, some commenta-\ntors have suggested that infant circumcision be abolished and\nreplaced with \"elective\" circumcision in late childhood or\nearly adolescence (around 11 years of age). As MacDonald\nThere is no new evidence that infant circumcision provides any\nadded benefit to the neonate, infant or young child with respect\nto HIV and HPV protection. The potential benefit from\ncircumcision only begins to accrue when the male becomes\nAccordingly, \"the important question for . . . pediatric societ-\nies is not about a change in infant circumcision recommenda-\ntions, but rather the need to address whether there would be\nmerit in routine peripubertal male circumcision.\" This is an\ninteresting idea, but there is clearly a difference between\noffering circumcision to an 11-year-old boy and performing\nit routinely at that age, as in South Korea or the Philippines\nto make the dubious suggestion that an 11-year-old can give\ninformed consent. Although a boy at that age would indeed\nbe more competent to give informed consent than he was at\n6 weeks or 6 months, it is still difficult to accept that he\nwould have sufficient competence to consent to an\nirreversible alteration to a central part of his genital anatomy.\nFew boys of that age would have adequate maturity of judg-\nment or knowledge of both what the operation entailed and\nits short- and long-term consequences, and many would be\nsubject to such strong parental, peer, and social pressures that\nthey would not be capable of making a free choice. The earli-\nest age at which a person is held to be competent to consent\nto sexual relations is 16 or 18; it is hard to see why the rules\nfor irreversible genital alterations should be less strict than\nthose governing sexual relations.\nMacDonald's suggestion was picked up by the Canadian\nmedia, and attracted comments that demonstrated, yet again, the\ndepth of the Anglophone assumption that circumcision means\ncircumcision of infants. One medical practitioner was reported\nas stating that the idea was unacceptable because \"If you explain\nto any 11-year-old what you were proposing, likely an 11-year-\nold would never consent to have that done.\" Quite--for as a\nreader of the National Post (\"Simon of Toronto\") commented, it\nwould be hard to find a more convincing ethical argument as to\nwhy circumcision of children should not be done at all:\nThat's about as solid an argument against circumcision as\nanybody should need. Basically, he's saying that the best reason\nto cut babies is because they can't tell you to stop. It neatly--and\nbrutally--clarifies the moral injustice of the practice. (Kirkey &\nNewborn males who are not circumcised at birth are much less\nlikely to elect circumcision in adolescence or early adulthood.\nParents who are considering deferring circumcision should be\nexplicitly informed that circumcision performed later in life has\nincreased risks and costs. (p. e760)\nSo although the AAP does not recommend circumcision, it\nstill puts strong pressure on parents to have it done. Brian Morris\n(1999) similarly admits that if the circumcision choice were left\ntothem,manyboyswouldmakethe\"wrong\"decision.\"Parental\nresponsibility must override arguments based on the rights of\nthe child,\" he writes, \"parents have the legal right to authorise\nsurgical procedures in the best interests of their children\" (pp.\n61-62). When they are old enough to give legal consent, males\n\"are reluctant to confront such issues\" and are neither \"mature\nnor well-informed enough\" to make the right decision for them-\nselves. In other words, Morris concedes that if doctors waited\nuntil boys were old enough to make up their own mind, most\nwould not consent to the operation. It would be hard to think of\na stronger argument as to why circumcision should not be done\nbefore the person is able to provide informed consent.\nConclusion\nI have sought to show that recent restatements of the medical\ncase for NTC of normal infants fail on three major points, one\nethical, one medical, and one logical. They do not demonstrate\nthat circumcision of non-consenting minors is permissible\nwithin accepted principles of bioethics and human rights; they\nfail to establish that the benefits are sufficiently great to out-\nweigh the harms and risks; and, they do not show that circum-\ncision must be performed in infancy to secure the major benefits\nclaimed for it. Even if it were true that circumcision did confer\nall the health benefits claimed, and ignoring such unsettled\nquestions as complications and the harms arising from loss of\nthe foreskin, the ethical principles governing surrogate consent\nfor surgical procedures on incompetent persons would not\nallow the operation to be performed on normal infants or other\nminors. Even if circumcision did confer a significant reduction\nin the risk of contracting certain diseases in adulthood, such as\nSTIs, it does not follow that circumcision must be performed in\ninfancy. If that were the case, the expensive African programs\nfor mass circumcision of adults as a tactic against heterosexu-\nally acquired HIV would be pointless. Despite mounting con-\ncern that these programs are less effective and more risky than\ncommonly believed,20 advocates still consider circumcision as\na means of reducing the risk of HIV and other STIs to be no\nless effective in adulthood as in childhood.\nThat being so, why do their arguments for circumcision in\ndeveloped countries such as the United States and Australia\nfocus on circumcision of infants? I have argued that the answer\nto this question leads us into an ethical and logical void: The\npreference for circumcising infants has little to do with the\ngreater efficacy of the intervention in early life, and almost\neverything to do with its mechanics. Adult men are usually\nreluctant to be circumcised and are not readily coerced; infants\nand children have less power to resist and can easily be com-\npelled to submit. Because they are incapable of saying no, chil-\ndren are a softer target. The notion of infancy as the \"best time\nto circumcise\" is based on the assumption that prophylactic\ncircumcision is desirable for all and that it will be necessary at\nsome point: If later, the argument goes, why not do it now and\nget it over with (Wallerstein, 1980)? But if prophylactic cir-\ncumcision is neither desirable nor necessary, and if unneces-\nappropriate times to circumcise are when it is clinically neces-\nsary to address a problem that has not responded to medical\ntreatment; or, when a competent male elects the operation for\nhimself and gives his informed consent.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n 1.
