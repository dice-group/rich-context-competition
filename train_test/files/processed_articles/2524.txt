Specifically, 23 biomarkers were included, representing seven physiological systems:\nmetabolic lipids, metabolic glucose, blood pressure, parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system,\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and inflammation. For factor invariance tests, age was categorized into three groups\nResults: A bifactor model where biomarkers simultaneously load onto a common AL factor and seven unique system-\nspecific factors provided the best fit to the biomarker data (comparative fit index = 0.967, root mean square error of\napproximation = 0.043, standardized root mean square residual = 0.028). Results from the bifactor model were consistent\nwith invariance across age groups and sex.\nConclusions: These results support the theory that represents and operationalizes AL as multisystem physiological dysreg-\nulation and operationalizing AL as the shared variance across biomarkers. Results also demonstrate that in addition to the\nvariance in biomarkers accounted for by AL, individual physiological systems account for unique variance in system-\nspecific biomarkers. A bifactor model allows researchers greater precision to examine both AL and the unique effects of spe-\ncific systems.\n",

(1\u00ad3)). Measures of physiological systems are fre-\nquently operationalized via the use of biomarkers. As the\nfield of psychosomatic medicine has advanced, it is in-\ncreasingly common for multiple biomarkers to be assessed.\nAlthough many biomarkers exist for each physiological\nsystem, there is little consensus on how to integrate these\nbiomarkers to assess the state and functioning of physio-\nlogical systems and multisystem physiological dysregu-\nlation. Despite the lack of consensus on how to integrate\nmultiple biomarkers, it does seem that using combinations\nof biomarkers is valuable. For example, in one study, a\ncomposite risk score of biomarkers predicted all-cause mor-\ntality over and above age and sex (4), and in another study,\nthe number of high-risk biomarkers combined demon-\nstrated a gradient relationship with mortality (5).\nSupplemental Content\nFrom the Department of Psychology (Wiley) and Division of Geriatrics (Karlamangla, Seeman), David Geffen School of Medicine, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, CA; Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research (Wiley), Australian Catholic University, Victoria, Australia; and Davis School of\nGerontology (Gruenewald), University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Teresa E.

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nOne conceptual approach to integrating biomarkers of\nmultiple systems is allostatic load (AL), which posits that\nthe body's adaptation to challenge and demands of the envi-\nronment (allostasis; (6)) over time takes a physiological toll\nand results in cumulative wear-and-tear or dysregulation\nacross multiple physiological systems (7). Thus, the dys-\nregulation is hypothesized to be a multisystems phenome-\nnon that occurs across multiple regulatory systems rather\nthan in particular systems only (for a review, see Ref.\n(8)). Figure 1 shows a diagram of three potential levels of\nanalysis for biomarkers, from using specific biomarkers\nas outcomes (bottom), to combining multiple biomarkers\nto assess specific physiological systems (middle), and the\nhighest aggregate combining multiple physiological sys-\ntems (AL; top). The primary goal of this study is to test\ntwo plausible measurement models of biomarkers hypo-\nthesized to represent both overall AL and individual physi-\nological systems.\nAn individual with allostatic overload and systemwide\ndysregulation will demonstrate some degree of dysregula-\ntion in multiple physiological regulatory systems involved\nin allostasis, and this physiological dysregulation may be\nassessed using a composite index from multiple systems.\nTo date, such indices of AL have typically been created\nby assuming equal influence of individual biomarkers, di-\nchotomizing them into high and low health risk based on\nquartiles or clinical risk points, averaging within a particu-\nlar physiological system (e.g., cardiovascular), and then\nsumming (e.g., Refs. (4,9)). Similar indices have been cre-\nated by first standardizing individual biomarkers and then\nsumming (e.g., Ref. (10)). Although less commonly applied\nto biological data, scale development and testing methods\nsuch as factor analysis have been used for years to develop\nand validate measures of latent constructs (e.g., depressive\nsymptoms) from multiple observed indicators (e.g., feeling\nsad or blue, loss of interest). For an introduction to factor\nanalysis in psychosomatic research, see Ref. (11).\nThe few studies that have examined the psychometric\nproperties and tested the factor structure of biomarkers\nin relation to AL found that a second-order AL factor\n(i.e., biomarkers load onto individual system factors which\nin turn load onto AL) provided adequate fit to the data\n(12\u00ad14). Related work in metabolic syndrome has shown\na similar hierarchical factor structure (e.g., Refs. (15,16)).\nIn addition, a second-order AL factor model of biomarkers\nwas found to be invariant across sex and ethnicity (13), and\nprovided good fit when controlling for sex and age (12);\nit did, however, differ between participants on and off of\nmedications in an elderly sample (14).\nLimitations are apparent in the existing literature on\nAL. First, previous research has had relatively few bio-\nmarkers per system, leaving open the question whether\nthe same factor structure will emerge when systems are\nmore comprehensively assessed. Second, although AL is\nhypothesized to be prominent in the aging process (17), to\nour knowledge, no previous study has tested whether the\nmeasurement of AL is invariant across adulthood or\nwhether the relations among biomarkers differ as a func-\ntion of age. Finally, although a second-order factor model\nprovided adequate fit in previous studies, there was room\nfor improvement of model fit. Given the complex rela-\ntions among biomarkers, examining alternative models\nmay be valuable.\nIn the present study, we used data from the Midlife in\nthe United States (MIDUS) II Biomarker Project, to address\nthe following aims.\nFIGURE 1.

This bifactor model tests whether the relations among\nbiomarkers are explained by two processes: a) a common\nfactor, capturing the notion that there is an underlying\nprocess influencing multiple physiological systems, and\n2) system-specific factors, capturing the notion that beyond\nthe common portion shared across biomarkers, there are\nunique effects of particular physiological systems that are\nindependent of other systems. Model 1 is nested within\nModel 2 allowing for a direct test of fit.\nSpecifically, we hypothesize that Model 1 will demon-\nstrate acceptable fit and represent a parsimonious ver-\nsion of a correlated-systems model. Finally, if systemwide\neffects drive the individual systems, then Model 2 will\ndemonstrate no better fit than Model 1 and be less parsimo-\nnious. However, if the systemwide and system-specific ef-\nfects have unique and nonoverlapping elements, Model 2\nshould demonstrate better fit. Because we expect impor-\ntant, unique systemwide and system-specific effects, we\nhypothesize that Model 2 will demonstrate the best fit.\nTo test whether the optimal factor structure underlying bio-\nmarkers of AL (Aim 1) is invariant across adulthood from\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe sample came from the larger MIDUS study. The first wave of data,\nMIDUS I, included phone interviews and mailed questionnaires to a na-\ntional sample of adults aged 25 to 74 years and was designed to assess fac-\ntors related to physical and psychological health and well-being in early\nadulthood, middle adulthood, and older age. Data for MIDUS I were\n(the core sample; n = 3487); siblings of the core sample (n = 950); twins\n(n = 957 pairs); and an oversampling in metropolitan areas (n = 757). Par-\nticipants from MIDUS I, as well as an additional sample of urban African\nAmericans living in Milwaukee, WI (n = 592, to increase diversity), were\nassessed in 2005 for MIDUS II (18). MIDUS II included follow-up ques-\ntionnaires, and a subset of participants who were eligible and consented\n(n = 1054 from the original sample and n = 201 from the Milwaukee sam-\nple) participated in the MIDUS II Biomarker Project, where extensive\nbiological data were collected (19). Thus, a total of 1255 participants\nwere included coming from 1098 families (944 families contributing one\nparticipant, 152 families contributing two participants, 1 family contribut-\ning three participants, and 1 family contributing four participants).\nProcedure\nAs part of the MIDUS II Biomarker Project, participants went to one of\nthree (University of California, Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin;\nand Georgetown University) General Clinical Research Centers for a med-\nical examination and comprehensive biomarker assessment (e.g., fasting\nblood draw, 12-hour urine, and electrocardiography), and reported on med-\nication history. Details on MIDUS are available online at http://www.\nmidus.wisc.edu, and for the biomarker project, see Ref. (19). The MIDUS\nII Biomarker Project was approved by the institutional review boards of\nthe University of Wisconsin, Madison; the University of California, Los\nAngeles; and Georgetown University.\nDemographics and Health Outcomes\nDemographic data including age, sex, and ethnicity were collected\nvia self-report. Self-reported medication use, including antihypertensive\nmedications, heart rate reducing (e.g., -blockers), diabetes medications,\ncholesterol-lowering mediations, and fibrates, was collected and used to\nidentify medication-free participants.\nBiological Measures\nSeven physiological systems were measured using 23 biomarkers. Details\non collection and assay of biomarkers are reported in Supplementary Data\nSympathetic Nervous System\nThe sympathetic nervous system (SNS) was measured using 12-hour, over-\nnight urinary epinephrine (E) in mg/g creatinine and norepinephrine (NE)\nin mg/g creatinine.\nParasympathetic Nervous System\nThe PNS was measured using heart rate variability and resting pulse rate\n(in beats per minute). Heart rate variability was assessed via electrocardiog-\nraphy and was operationalized as the standard deviation of beat-to-beat\nintervals (R-R interval), root mean square of successive differences\n(RMSSD), low-frequency spectral power, and high-frequency spectral\npower (HFHRV).\nHypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis\nThe HPA axis was measured using 12-hour, overnight urinary cortisol\ng/g creatinine and blood serum dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)\nin g/dL.\nInflammation\nInflammation was measured using plasma levels of C-reactive protein\n(CRP) in mg/L, interleukin-6 (IL-6) in ng/L, fibrinogen in mg/dL, soluble\nE-selectin (sE-Selectin) in ng/mL, and soluble intracellular adhesion\nmolecule 1 in mg/L.\nCardiovascular\nThe cardiovascular system was measured with resting systolic blood pres-\nsure (SBP) in mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in mm Hg. For\nthe model, these were converted into pulse pressure (SBP - DBP) and SBP.\nGlucose\nThe metabolic glucose system was measured using the homeostatic model\nassessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose in mg/dL,\nand glycosylated hemoglobin in percent.\nLipids\nThe metabolic lipid system was measured using waist-to-hip ratio, high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol in mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\ncholesterol in mg/dL, and triglycerides in mg/dL.\nData Analysis\nStructural equation modeling was used to compare the two alternative\nmodels of the relations among biomarkers, with age and sex included as co-\nvariates for each biomarker.\nModel fit indices were used to find the best fitting of the two hypothe-\nsized factor structures. In addition, Model 1 is nested within Model 2. A 2\ndifference test adjusted for the scaling factor (21) was conducted between\nModels 1 and 2. Multiple-group structural equation modeling was used to\nMultisystem Physiological Dysregulation\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

Specifically, model invariance was tested for age\nsistent or differs for younger and older participants and sex (female versus\nmale). To compare factor means across groups (a common objective in re-\nsearch on AL), it is generally considered necessary (22) that the models\nat least demonstrate the following: configural invariance (i.e., the same\nnumber of factors and indicators loading on the same factors), metric\ninvariance (i.e., the factor loadings are identical across groups), and scalar\ninvariance (i.e., the intercepts of the indicators are identical across groups).\nSequentially, more constrained models (i.e., configural only, con-\nfigural + metric, and configural + metric + scalar) across groups were\ntested. 2 tests are reported, but results are considered consistent with\nmodel invariance only if the most restrictive configural + metric + scalar\ninvariance was met as demonstrated both by adequate model fit and by\nminimal change in model fit (comparative fit index [CFI], root mean square\nTABLE 1.

Residual variances were not\nconstrained to be equal across groups, as it is expected that variability\nmay differ between groups (e.g., participants in the youngest age group\nmay not have the same range on biomarkers as older adults may have).\nFinally, if the bifactor model is correct, it should exhibit item parameter\ninvariance (24); that is, the same general and system-specific factor load-\nings should result regardless of the specific subset of biomarkers or sys-\ntems assessed. This follows from the logic that if the items are indicators\nof the latent factors specified, we should be measuring the same latent\nfactor regardless of which specific indicators are used, and so when some\nitems are dropped, the factor loadings of the remaining items should not\nchange (i.e., be invariant). To examine item parameter invariance, seven ad-\nditional models were fit. Each of the seven models started with the overall\nbifactor model on all participants and systematically dropped one of the\nseven systems by removing all the biomarkers of a particular system as well\nas the system-specific factor. For example, one model was the bifactor\nmodel without the inflammation system and dropped CRP, IL-6, fibrino-\ngen, sE-Selectin, and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1, leaving\n18 biomarkers, one common AL factor, and six system-specific factors.\nStatistical Methods\nBiomarkers were assessed for univariate normality, and log transformations\nwere applied to E, NE, standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval, RMSSD,\nlow-frequency spectral power, HFHRV, cortisol, DHEA-S, CRP, IL-6, sE-\nSelectin, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and tri-\nglycerides. Outliers were addressed by Winsorizing the lower and upper\n0.5%. Because multivariate nonnormality remained despite these transfor-\nmations, a robust estimator and standard errors were used. To address the\nsmall amount (<3%) of missing data, full information maximum likelihood\nestimation was used (25). Standard errors and model tests were adjusted for\nnonindependence within families using clustered standard errors based on\nthe Huber-White \"sandwich\" estimator implemented in Mplus; thus, inde-\npendence is assumed among cluster units, not individual units.\nGood model fit was chosen as the combination of the CFI > 0.95,\nare available from the Standardizing Physiological Composite Risk End-\npoints Project Web site: http://score-project.org. Data management, de-\nscriptive statistics, and transformations were conducted using R v. 3.1.1\n(27) and Mplus v. 7.3 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, Los Angeles, CA) via Mplus-\nAutomation v. 0.6\u00ad3 (28) for the structural equation models.\nRESULTS\nParticipant age ranged from 34 to 84 years, with ap-\nproximately equal numbers of women and men. Sample\ncharacteristics and descriptive statistics for the biomarkers\n(untransformed) are presented in Table 1. Based on prelim-\ninary analyses, three modifications were made to all hy-\npothesized models. First, HOMA-IR was allowed to cross\nload on both the lipid metabolism and glucose metabo-\nlism factors. Second, heart rate was used as an indicator\nof the PNS rather than the cardiovascular factor. Third, a\nresidual correlation between HFHRV and RMSSD was\nallowed. No other modifications to the hypothesized models\nwere made.\nAim 1: Model Comparisons\nModel fit indices comparing the two alternative models\n(Fig. 2) are shown in Table 2. The second-order model\n(Model 1) demonstrated acceptable fit, with two of three in-\ndices meeting the criteria for good fit, although the CFI did\nexpected, the bifactor model (Model 2) demonstrated the\nbest fit to the data and met all criteria for good model fit\nbifactor model also fit significantly better than the second-\norder factor model (2\nresults suggest that a common factor does underlie the indi-\nvidual biomarkers, but that there are also unique, system-\nspecific effects.\nAim 2: Model Invariance\nThe fit of the bifactor model was tested across age (45,\na multiple group model. Results from the configural,\nconfigural + metric, and configural + metric + scalar invari-\nance tests are shown in Table S1, Supplemental Digital\nContent 1, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/A264, and sex-\nspecific loadings are shown in Figure S1, in Supplemental\nDigital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/A264.\nThe configural + metric + scalar invariant models were\ntested against the configural only model for sex. The\nconfigural only model for age did not converge, so for\nTABLE 2.

For this reason, age group\u00adspecific loadings\nalso could not be shown as only the constrained models\nconverged, which by definition have identical loadings. Al-\nthough the configural + metric + scalar invariant model fit\nstatistically significantly worse for both age and sex (all p\nvalues < .05), the change in fit indices was small for age\nIn addition, the configural + metric + scalar invariant models\nall SRMRs < 0.08). Thus, overall the results were consis-\ntent with model invariance by age and sex. The final\nconfigural + metric + scalar invariant model fit indices are\nshown in Table 2.\nFinal Model Estimates\nThe standardized loadings of each biomarker on the\nsystem-specific and common AL factor for the final overall\nbifactor model are shown in Table 3. With the exception of\nLDL, E, and DHEA-S, all biomarkers loaded significantly\nand in the direction such that higher AL scores indicate\nmore physiological dysregulation. LDL and DHEA-S were\nnot statistically significant, and E loaded negatively on AL,\nindicating that the higher the AL score, the lower E. Al-\nthough biomarkers from the PNS and cardiovascular (blood\npressure) systems loaded in the expected directions and\nwere statistically significant, loadings were small or mod-\nest. In the bifactor model, most correlations among bio-\nmarkers across systems will be captured by the common\nAL factor, so as expected the estimated correlations among\nthe latent system-specific factors were generally small, with\nthe largest two between the HPA and SNS (r = 0.34) and\ncardiovascular system (r = 0.23), with all other factor corre-\nlations  0.20 (see Table 4 for details).\nAs a sensitivity analysis, the factor loadings from the fi-\nnal bifactor model on only those 486 participants who were\nmedication-free are also presented in Table 3. In general,\nthe results are quite similar, with some additional nonsignif-\nicant parameters due to the reduced sample size.\nFinally, item parameter invariance was examined by\ncomparing the standardized loadings from the seven re-\nduced models (each now with only six systems assessed)\nto the full bifactor model. None of the loadings from the re-\nduced models fell outside the confidence interval for the\noverall bifactor model, and most exhibited minimal differ-\nences (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with what would\nbe expected if the model had item parameter invariance.\nDISCUSSION\nAcross 23 biomarkers in a large sample of adults, a bifac-\ntor model of AL provided both good fit and was the best-\nfitting model. This result has two important implications.\nFirst, it confirms what previous studies have demonstrated\nthat consistent with AL theory, a common factor under-\nlies biomarkers of multisystem physiological functioning\n(12\u00ad14). Second, it is the first study, to our knowledge, that\ndemonstrates that in addition to the common underlying\nAL factor, individual physiological systems account for\nunique variance in biomarkers not accounted for by the\ncommon factor. Composites of biomarkers within a system\nor factor scores from the second-order factor (Model\n1) model will conflate system-specific effects and effects\nof the common factor. Using a bifactor model (Model\n2) provides an alternative and novel method that allows\nthe examination of either the common AL factor, the\nsystem-specific factors unconflated from AL, or both.\nMost loadings were in the expected directions, but\nthere were exceptions. Contrary to AL theory, E loaded\nnegatively on the common AL factor, although it corre-\nlated positively with NE (r = 0.50), which did load posi-\ntively on the AL factor. To our knowledge of the three\nother studies that examined the factor structure of AL,\nonly one assessed E and found that it was not significantly\nassociated with AL (9). Cortisol also loaded negatively onto\nthe common AL factor, but it is less clear whether high or\nlow values of basal cortisol are desirable (e.g., Seeman\nand colleagues (13) found that higher AL was associated\nwith a lower cortisol awakening response and flatter change\nover the day). Alternatively, this may be unique to the\nMIDUS study as participants had to travel to one of three\nclinical research centers for the overnight stay when their\nbiomarkers were assessed, which may have affected their\novernight urinary cortisol.\nOverall, the largest factor loadings for the common\nAL factor were from biomarkers from the inflammation,\nglucose, and lipid systems. Biomarkers in the SNS, PNS,\nand cardiovascular (blood pressure) systems did not load\nstrongly on the common AL factor, but did load onto their\nsystem-specific factors. These systems also had the strongest\ncorrelations among the system-specific factors. Although AL\ntheory does not hypothesize stronger associations among\nthese systems than other systems, these results make sense\nin that the biomarkers from these systems only load mod-\nestly on the common AL factor, with more of their variance\naccounted for by the system-specific factors, leading to\nhigher correlations among the system factors (although\nnone of these correlations are large). These results suggest\nthat for the SNS, PNS, and cardiovascular (blood pressure)\nsystems, it may be particularly important to examine their\nunique effects beyond overall AL. By examining shared\nand system-specific effects, we believe that this bifactor\nmodel can facilitate greater precision in the next generation\nof research. For example, different types of stressors (e.g.,\nlow-grade chronic stress versus traumatic stress) may be as-\nsociated with higher allostatic, but show differential effects\non specific systems, such as SNS or PNS.\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

(29) argued for a\nneed to standardize the measurement of AL and for re-\nsearchers to report on the specific components of AL. We\nagree that the specific components of AL are important; in-\ndeed the bifactor structure suggests that specific physiolog-\nical systems account for additional variance in biomarkers\nover and above AL. Using a method that allows both AL\nand specific physiological systems to be used as indepen-\ndent predictors or outcomes facilitates examining both\nsystemwide (AL) and system-specific effects. We believe\nthat using a bifactor model represents an important ad-\nvance in psychosomatic research for untangling the rela-\ntions between psychological factors and system-specific\nand systemwide physiological dysregulation.\nThe results were consistent with item parameter invari-\nance for the bifactor model. The property of item parameter\ninvariance means that the system-specific and AL factor\nloadings would not change regardless of the specific bio-\nmarkers measured. Item parameter invariance is an im-\nportant property that underlies methods such as computer\nadaptive testing where not all participants are given the\nsame questions and yet they receive comparable scores on\nthe same underlying construct. If this result is replicated\nand shown reliable, it has the potential to provide a path-\nway to resolve discrepancies across studies due to different\nbiomarkers being measured by deriving scores on the same\nunderlying AL and individual system factors, even if the\nexact subset of biomarkers assessed varies. Another im-\nplication is that research that does not measure all 23 bio-\nmarkers can still derive a comparable AL score, opening\nthe possibility of a \"short\" version of AL where fewer bio-\nmarkers are assessed to save cost or participant burden.\nHowever, one disadvantage of measuring fewer biomarkers\nis that it may no longer be possible to obtain a score on a\nparticular system-specific factor.

To recom-\nmend which biomarkers should be measured to optimally\nmeasure AL, future research is needed to examine the rela-\ntionships between AL scored from different biomarkers\nand other constructs such as stress, physical functioning,\nmorbidity, and mortality.\nWe found that for the bifactor model, results were con-\nsistent with what would be expected if it was invariant\nbetween men and women, which is consistent with prior\nresearch on AL comparing women and men (13), as well\nas across age groups.\nLimitations of the current study should be noted. The\nsample was predominantly white, with fewer African\nAmericans and small numbers of other ethnicities repre-\nsented. In addition, only basal levels of biomarkers were\nassessed; future research is needed to examine relations\namong functional measures of biomarkers (e.g., inflamma-\ntory response to antigens). Finally, when testing measure-\nment invariance where the model fit is compared across\nsubgroups of the sample, many subgroups were small, and\nin these multiple group models, the overall sample size\nwas small compared with the number of parameters and\ncomplexity of our measurement model. However, with\n1254 participants, this is one of the largest studies with ex-\ntensive biomarker data available.\nThe study also has several important strengths. The cur-\nrent study comprehensively assessed seven physiological\nsystems using 23 biomarkers. The use of many biomarkers\nensures that each of the seven systems is measured by more\nthan one biomarker, allowing us to differentiate effects\nshared across systems and effects unique to systems. An-\nother strength is the broad age range from 34 to 84 years.\nFinally, the current study used careful statistical analyses in-\ncluding the following: accounting for clustering in twins\nand siblings in the MIDUS data, nonnormality of the bio-\nmarkers, missing data, and investigating alternative theo-\nretical models.\nIn conclusion, across 23 biomarkers in MIDUS, we\nfound evidence for a common AL factor, as well as for\nseven system-specific factors, and this model held across\nage groups and sex. Although our findings were consistent\nFIGURE 3. Item parameter invariance plot. Standardized loadings with 95% CIs for the overall bifactor model are shown in black\ntriangles. Results from seven \"reduced\" models where each system was systematically dropped are shown slightly below the results\nfrom the overall bifactor model. The overlap in points and confidence intervals shows that the standardized loadings for the remaining\nbiomarkers do not change substantially when biomarkers for any one system are dropped.

Nevertheless, they do point\nto the robustness of AL, and perhaps suggest that appar-\nently disparate sets of biomarkers used in many studies\nmay actually be more comparable than expected. Future\nresearch is needed to examine the predictive effects of\nAL and specific systems on health. Future research could\nalso explore whether for specific outcomes, such as partic-\nular diseases, or for different predictors, such as chronic or\nacute stress, different profiles emerge across the common\nAL factor and system-specific factors. To standardize the\nmeasurement of AL as Gallo et al. (29) suggest, further\nwork is needed to reach consensus on how to define \"opti-\nmal\" measures of AL and specific physiological systems\n(e.g., predict disease incidence or mortality, and predict\nfunctioning), and then to develop and validate sets of bio-\nmarkers for each system and for AL overall--work that\nis challenging given the great diversity of samples and pop-\nulations studied. Nevertheless, findings that the bifactor\nmodel was consistent with item parameter invariance, if\nreplicated, open the intriguing possibility that just as in\ncomputer-adaptive testing where not all participants com-\nplete the same questions, yet can be given comparable\nscores, it may be possible to obtain comparable AL scores\nfrom different sets of biomarkers and perhaps begin to re-\nsolve concerns about the challenge interpreting the AL\nliterature when measurement is inconsistent.\nSource of Funding and Conflicts of Interest: MIDUS I\nwas supported by the John D. and Catherine T.
