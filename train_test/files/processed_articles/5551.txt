These\ninclude a wide variety of phenomena and practices--such as crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, open\ninnovation, peer and community production, innovation contests, and user innovation--that are\nbeing adopted by organizations of all types (Harhoff and Lakhani, 2016).\nWhile we are descriptively learning much about these crowd-type phenomena and more\nopen forms of organization, the underlying theoretical and comparative commonalities and\ndifferences--as well as their implications for theories of the firm--remain under-specified.\nThese evolving forms of innovation, strategy, and organizing of course are not completely new;\nCorresponding author:\nTeppo Felin, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 1HP, UK.\nEmail: teppo.felin@sbs.ox.ac.uk\nSpecial Issue: Organizing Crowds and Innovation\nindeed, there is a long historical record of contests and communities as important drivers of\ninnovative activity prior to and during the Industrial Revolution (Bessen and Nuvolari, 2016;\nMowery and Rosenberg, 1998). Others have of course long posited that the nature of innovation\nand production is fundamentally changing (e.g. Von Hippel, 1976, 1986). Yet others argue that\nthese new ways of organizing simply represent \"hybrid\" forms of more discrete organizational\ntypes such as markets and hierarchy (Foss, 2003)--or perhaps linked to networks (Powell,\n1990) and communities (Adler, 2001). But arguably the organization, innovation, and strategy\nliteratures have struggled to theoretically integrate many crowd-related phenomena coherently\ninto their body of work. It also seems that our theories continue to lag practice, where various\norganizing and organizational \"technologies\" and designs are outpacing the ability of our theories\nIn this article, we fill this gap and focus on various crowd-related phenomena, forms, and practices\nand argue that the theoretical and empirical opportunity is to specify their central features in terms of\nwhat we call \"sociality\" (cf. Zenger et al., 2011), particularly as this sociality relates to strategy, inno-\nvation, and potentially new theories of the firm. By the word sociality, we mean any deliberately\ndesigned--or emergent or unintended--social interaction, aggregation, or variety of social influence\nthat relates to the firm, its strategy, and innovation. We contend that understanding (1) the functions\nof sociality, (2) the forms of sociality, and (3) the failures of sociality will help us introduce important\ntheoretical and comparative intuition to explain crowd-related practices. Under the rubric of the func-\ntions of sociality, we discuss how this concept can extend rationality and how it plays a functional\nrole in sensing, signaling, and identity matching. Our focus on the forms of sociality contrasts the\nnominal, independent or aggregate, and emergent social interactions--whether unintended or\ndesigned--that occur within and across organizations and markets. And in our discussion of failures,\nwe highlight how the benefits of sociality are often misapplied and misattributed.\nOverall, we make the case that understanding the functions, forms, and failures of sociality will\nbest help us integrate various crowd-type, peer, and community phenomena into our theories. The\nopportunity we see is in carefully thinking about how sociality relates to the theory of the firm and\nits implications for the changing nature of organizational boundaries, and more generally the\nevolving nature of strategic and innovative activity. We argue that systematically exploring the idea\nof sociality will generate new theoretical and empirical insights for our understanding of strategy,\norganizations, and innovation. We first provide a broad overview of theories of the firm as they\nrelate to innovation and then focus on the relations between sociality (its function, forms, and fail-\nures), the firm, and the locus of innovation. We concurrently discuss future research directions and\nthereafter provide an introduction to the special issue papers and essays.\nTheories of the firm and innovation\nCoase's (1937) theory of the firm is seen as a landmark contribution to help us understand organi-\nzational boundaries and the comparative dynamics between organizations and markets (Gibbons,\nence of transaction costs in markets leads to the \"emergence of the firm.\" He placed emphasis on\nan \"entrepreneur-coordinator,\" who \"directs resources\" and more generally \"coordinates produc-\ntion.\" His seminal contribution was to highlight how the visible hand of an entrepreneur or man-\nessentially \"taking over\" the market's invisible hand where coordination occurs through the price\nWhile Coase's theory undoubtedly made contributions to our understanding of the nature of\nfirms and markets, what is readily evident is that the approach had a rather thin view of sociality.\nFor example, the judgment about which activities should be handled by firms versus markets was\nimplicitly left to a sole decision-maker--the \"entrepreneur-coordinator\"--who optimizes on the\nbasis of transaction dimensions, such as asset specificity, uncertainty, and frequency (Williamson,\n1985). Thus, the entrepreneur or manager, based on his or her assessment, is the central pivot point\nand nexus between markets and hierarchy (Zenger et al., 2011). The only form of sociality in this\nmodel is represented by factors such as hiring, which is seen as transactional, where employees\ncontract with the manager for their labor--and essentially, their discretion--in exchange for a sal-\nary. Activity within the firm, then, is guided by managerial fiat. As aptly summarized by Coase\n(1937), an employee does not take actions within a firm \"because of a change in relative prices, but\nbecause he is ordered to do so\" by the manager (p. 387).\nThe problem of course is that the decision calculus of economic activity--for example, about\nwhich activities to pursue (make or buy), whom to hire, what strategy to pursue--is necessarily\na social activity. This was pointed out early on by Malmgren (1961) who argued that the theory\nof the firm needed some way of understanding how information aggregates across multiple peo-\nple within an organization. In other words, the firm is a social entity, rather than just a stylized,\nsingular person--even though the latter conception tends to dominate. Malmgren thus called for\ntheories that recognize the so-called \"multi-person\" firm. Rather than treating firms as equiva-\nlent to the CEO or manager, attention should be given to the underlying social and interactional\nfactors related to decisions and transactions. Some aspects of this sociality were of course central\nto the Carnegie School (March, 1963). However, the focus on social aggregation and certain\nforms of sociality and interaction represented an aspect of the Carnegie tradition that sadly did\nnot receive much attention in the decades following Simon and March's early contributions\nThe subsequent years of research in the domain of strategy and organization theory have added\nvaried aspects of sociality to our understanding of economic activity. For example, Granovetter\n(1985) strongly critiqued the Coase\u00adWilliamson conception of production and economic activity\nfor not recognizing structural and social embeddedness. The calculations of transaction cost eco-\nnomics seemed to not recognize the underlying relational mechanisms and forms that underlie and\nconstitute production (e.g. Uzzi, 1996). Important contributions in the innovation literature took\ntheir cues from these arguments and highlighted how alliances, network-related and communal\narrangements, and forms play an important role in firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998;\nThe technology and innovation literatures have paralleled some of the above developments,\nby first focusing on internal R&D and various structural features related to firms (e.g. Allen,\n1977; Chandler, 1993) and then moving from R&D- and firm-centric conceptions to higher lev-\nels of analysis. To illustrate this shift--specifically focusing on the last two decades--it is worth\nrevisiting the topics and concepts featured in the highly visible Administrative Science Quarterly\nspecial issue on \"Technology, Organizations, and Innovation,\" published now over a quarter of\na century ago (Tushman and Nelson, 1990). This Special Issue contained landmark articles that\nintroduced and discussed topics such as absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), tech-\nnology and structure (Barley, 1990), R&D and organizational boundaries (Pisano, 1990), tech-\nnology and organizational ecology (Barnett, 1990), and architectural innovation (Henderson and\nClark, 1990). These articles and concepts--many years later--continue to gain attention and to\nshape the way scholars think about innovation, technological change, strategic management, and\norganization theory. However, the intervening years have seen significant shifts in the locus,\nstructure, and nature of innovation and associated innovation processes. The combination of\nproduct or service modularity (e.g. Baldwin and Clark, 2003) and sharply decreased computing\nand communication costs have transformed the nature of organizational boundaries and the ways\nfirms innovate (e.g. Felin and Zenger, 2014; Lakhani et al., 2013). Fundamental organizational\nand strategic assumptions at the core of our extant innovation research seem to be called into\nquestion with increased modularity and sharply decreased communication costs. For example,\nthe Chandlerian notions of organizational boundaries and associated local communication codes\n(e.g. Henderson and Clark, 1990), the primacy of local search and satisficing (e.g. Cohen and\nLevinthal, 1990), the notion that transition costs are lower within the firm than outside the firm\n(e.g. Pisano, 1990) seem open to reconsideration (see Benkler, 2017; Baldwin and Von Hippel\n(2012)). The firm-specific and R&D-centric model seems to have yielded to a logic of \"open-\nness\" and different and new ways of thinking about innovation, its locus, and the nature of the\nfirm itself.\nThe user and open innovation literatures have also questioned our paradigms, specifically\nin terms of the locus and sources of innovation. Users originate new products, firms, and even\nindustries--which would not be captured if we have a singular focus on firm-centric activities and\nproduction (Von Hippel, 1986, 2005). And, more broadly, there are any number of reasons to be\n\"open\" to ideas and knowledge from any number of environmental and outside sources that can\nproductively be harnessed by the firm (cf. West and Lakhani, 2008; West et al., 2014; also see\nLeiponen and Helfat, 2010): users, customers, suppliers, and universities (e.g. Foss et al., 2011;\nLaursen and Salter, 2006). Simultaneous developments have also included social movement\u00adlike\nforms of production, as is evident in open source software (Lakhani and Von Hippel, 2003). These\narguments have raised important questions about the nature of production and the theory of\nIf we step back, it seems clear that there have been a number of changes in how innovation is\nstructured and organized. But while the literatures in these areas are growing rapidly, the underly-\ning theoretical mechanisms and comparative intuition deserves further attention. For example,\nstudies of crowds and open innovation remain relatively descriptive of the phenomena or attempt\nto explain micro-behavior by resorting to established theoretical frameworks from within the social\nscience traditions of economics, psychology, and sociology, raising questions about the underlying\ntheoretical and comparative and organizational mechanisms. Furthermore, research on crowds and\nthe shifting locus of innovation has often been uncoupled from the firm (Altman et al., 2015). We\nbelieve that a central issue that can help the field theoretically understand crowd-related and open\npractices--and more carefully link them to theories of the firm--has to do with \"sociality.\" We\nnext discuss what we mean by sociality, why we think focusing on it might lead to theoretical\ninsights, and then focus on the functions, forms, and failures of sociality in the context of the theory\nof the firm, strategy, and innovation.\nInnovation and sociality: functions, forms, and failures\nAs described in section \"Introduction,\" by \"sociality\" we mean any deliberately designed--or\nemergent or unintended--social interaction, aggregation, or type of social influence that relates to\nthe firm, strategy, and innovation. Of course, what sociality is and \"does\" in the context of organi-\nzations and markets has received attention in the literature. For example, organizations are gener-\nally seen as being \"thick\" with varied social processes--related to influence and interaction--as\nargued by various knowledge-based views of the firm which focus on a range of factors such as\nsocial capital (e.g. Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; cf. Adler and Kwon, 2002), socialization (e.g.\nables are seen as the central determinants of knowledge creation and innovation. And these social\nvariables are often contrasted with the market's \"thin\" and atomistic view of sociality (cf.\nGranovetter, 1985). But as we will argue, these distinctions are far from clear in the context of\ncrowds and the many market-like practices that feature unique forms of sociality and now find\nthemselves entangled with organizing and organizations.\nWe thus see sociality as an important meso-level concept that can help develop more fine-\ngrained and comparative theories related to innovation and organizations. Our emphasis on the\n\"meso\" factors is a deliberate effort to understand the underlying theoretical mechanisms behind\nthe new cognitive, behavioral, and social patterns that we are witnessing in the changing landscape\nof organizations and innovation. Thus, our goal, albeit preliminary, is to develop a middle-range\ntheory (cf. Merton, 1949; also see Simmel, 1971) of innovation and organizing, with significant\nempirical implications for linking the micro and macro as well. Understanding the specific func-\ntions, forms, and failures of sociality, we argue, provides the key to this theoretical endeavor.\nFunctions of sociality\nWe see sociality serving a number of specific functions in the context of firms and markets--with\nparticular relevance to recent practices such as crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, user innovation, and\npeer production. We discuss three specific functions: (a) sociality as extension of rationality, (b)\nsociality as sensing and signal, and (c) sociality as matching and fostering identity.\nFirst, sociality can serve the function of extending or amplifying rationality. The knowledge,\ninformation, ideas, and rationality of individuals are necessarily delimited. But sociality can expand\nthese bounds. Thus, while the idea of bounded rationality is often applied to firms as a whole--that\nis, where the firm itself is seen as a unitary, boundedly rational actor (Whetten et al., 2010)--careful\nconsideration should be given to how the aggregation of heterogeneous rationalities within and\noutside the firm leads to the loosening of these constraints. Individuals within and across organiza-\ntions have ideas, information, and knowledge that can be harnessed and pooled in powerful ways.\nMany of the crowd-type practices represent precisely this type of extension of rationality (e.g.\nO'Mahony and Lakhani, 2011). We can, then, see organizations--and different types of crowds, as\nwe will discuss later--as essentially a vehicle or mechanism for the extension and amplification of\nrationality. After all, as discussed by Arrow (1974), organizations (and other social collectives) can\n\"acquire more information than any individual\" and thus \"collective action can extend the domain\nThis type of social extension or amplification of rationality was presciently also called for by\nthe organizational sociologist Art Stinchcombe (1990) in his book Information and Organization.\nHe argues that a central criterion for any theory of organization is that it must somehow account for\nsocial rationality: as he puts it, organization theories must \"explain how organizations can be more\nrational than individuals (though of course they are not always)\" (Stinchcombe, 1990: 341). The\nfocus on organizations as extenders of rationality, however, is counter to the current pessimism in\nthe literature, where many are obsessed not with rationality but with the pathologies, biases, and\nerrors of organizational activity and decision-making (cf. Porac and Tschang, 2013; also see Powell\net al., 2011). The problem of course is that focusing on blindness, boundedness, and error misses,\nand cannot explain, the fact that organizations and varied forms of human collective action--\nincluding the varied uses of crowds--in fact are responsible for all the built environment and driv-\ners of significant technological progress in the modern world.\nA natural extension of the logic of broader collective or organizational rationality is that the\ninclusion of outside constituents--for example, crowds of varying types--might also serve the\nfunctional role of extending and amplifying rationality (e.g. Boudreau and Lakhani, 2013; King\nand Lakhani, 2013). This intuition of course is familiar from other literatures as well. For example,\nthe alliances' literature argues that in dynamic environments, all the relevant knowledge (or,\n\"rationality\") can scarcely be housed within firms, and thus the locus of knowledge and innovation\nincreasingly is the network rather than the firm (e.g. Kogut, 2000). Many crowd-related practices\nserve precisely this function of extending rationality as well, by introducing a wider array of pos-\nsibilities, knowledge, and ideas to the firms in different ways. Outside crowds--of varying types--\ncan be used as an innovation partner (Boudreau and Lakhani, 2013), where problems (or the need\nfor resources or funding; Drover et al., 2017) can be broadcast to those who might have the relevant\nknowledge and solutions (Jeppesen and Lakhani, 2010). Customers, users, and even individuals\nwidely disconnected from the focal activities of the firm can provide valuable insights, ideas,\nresources, and knowledge that can productively be harnessed and utilized in organizational deci-\nThe second function of sociality is the role it can play as sensing and signal. If we think of\norganizations as entities that process information (cf. Tushman and Nadler, 1978), then different\nforms of sociality can be seen as ways of sensing and signaling environmental opportunities. The\nidea of sensing has recently received significant interest as a central element of organizational\ncapabilities (O'Reilly and Tushman, 2008; Teece, 2007). And sensing is associated with the cogni-\ntive architecture of the firm (Powell et al., 2011; also see Eggers and Kaplan, 2013). Decision-\nmaking and sensing are traditionally viewed as the mandate of top management, though there of\ncourse are crude informational mechanisms built into bureaucracies and hierarchies as well (cf.\nKnudsen and Levinthal, 2007). But the onus of this sensing activity is traditionally placed on the\nmanager, in the form of Coasean fiat.\nHowever, recently more democratic and bottom\u00adup forms of sensing show promise as a way of\nharnessing the collective wisdom that (more often than not) latently sits within and among the\nemployees in the firm, and beyond. Felin and Powell (2016) recently studied this type of sensing\nat the software company Valve Corporation. The company was founded in 1996 by a set of employ-\nees who left Microsoft. The Valve founders felt that Microsoft--though of course an innovative\ncompany in its own right--did not allow them to undertake new, promising initiatives without\nintervention from higher level managers. Valve thus instituted a deliberate effort to involve\neveryone within the organization to sense opportunities. This was done by radically flattening the\norganizational structure and by allowing any employee to initiate and self-select onto projects that\nthey felt would generate the most value. Thus, the responsibility of sensing was radically dispersed\namong the employees, providing a valuable signal about what the company could and should do.\nThese types of practices of course are familiar to us from other settings as well (also see Kleinbaum\net al., 2013). For example, Foss (2003) discusses how the Danish hearing aid company Oticon\nsimilarly flattened their organizational structure and allowed individuals to self-select onto teams\nand projects, with powerful outcomes in terms of innovation and performance.\nAlthough we are familiar with flat structures, it is important to note that there are intriguing\ncrowd and process-related innovations--directly related to the social functions of sensing and\nsignaling--that have also emerged and allowed a company like Valve to thrive. Specifically, Valve\ninadvertently stumbled on a striking innovation, an organizational \"technology\" of a sort, that\nhelped them optimize how the sensing of opportunities was done within the organization (Felin and\nPowell, 2016). Specifically, Valve instituted a so-called \"rule of three\" which specified that if three\nindividuals within the company thought that a strategic initiative or product was worth pursuing--\nto the point where they were willing to work on this project themselves (and thus perhaps drop\nother projects)--then this served as a permission and signal to seize the relevant opportunity. The\nrule of three operated without managerial intervention and put the responsibility of social, joint\nsensing squarely in the hands of employees themselves. The social process of coming up with\nideas, and the efforts to recruit others to work on these ideas, as well as the further shaping of these\nideas through social interaction, served functionally as a sensing mechanism and signal about what\nstrategic initiatives might be worthwhile.\nAs a brief aside, strikingly similar mechanisms can be found in nature as well, in the so-called\n\"quorum sensing\" literature (Sumpter, 2010). Social animals like ants and bees explicitly use this\nmechanism to make decisions about where to forage and hunt for food, or where to locate their\nnest. If a sufficient number of individuals, say, ants or bees, think that a particular location is opti-\nmal, then this serves as a collective signal that this is the optimal choice. Thus, sociality serves a\nfunctional role in the process of sensing and signaling. Similar allusions to insect-like phenomena\nand coordination have also been made in analyzing the development of open source projects with\ndevelopers adopting \"stigmergic\" coordination where simply the work done by others provides\nguidance on the next activity to be completed by someone else (e.g. Bolici et al., 2016).\nOf course, this type of dispersed sensing and signaling is not a panacea and needs to be used with\ncaution, in the appropriate context (Puranam et al., 2014).And it is not practical for all organizations\nand industries, as many strategies require the orchestration, cooperation, and effort of the organi-\nzation as a whole. In other words, some organizational settings--depending on what they hope to\nachieve (Nickerson and Zenger, 2004)--may not be conducive to dispersed experimentation and\nemergent organization. But even large organizations can institute practices and tools that capitalize\non the fact that the organization is a social entity with many individuals whose sensing and signaling\ncapacities--which more often than not remain latent and underutilized--can be harnessed in power-\nful ways. To provide another example, some organizations have created internal prediction markets\nand varied voting mechanisms that allow employees themselves to assess opportunities and signal\npotential sources of value (Cowgill et al., 2009; Croxson, 2010). Radical decentralization is not the\nonly option. The infusion of market-type mechanisms like prediction markets provides another\nalternative to sensing and signaling, where the broad adoption of such approaches--subject to\nappropriate incentive alignment--can powerfully harness the rest of the organization in making\npredictions in uncertain environments (Coles et al., 2007).\nIn all, the functions of sociality related to both extending rationality and sensing and signaling\nare fundamentally changing the way organizations, and firms, organize even their most strategic\nactivities. And crowds--both internal and external to the firm--are being utilized as a mechanism\nfor suggesting ideas, adding and aggregating information, filtering, and as tipping points and col-\nlective thresholds for organizational and collective decision-making. Ogawa and Nishikawa (2016)\nprovide a fascinating overview of how crowds have been systematically used for more than 10\nyears at Muji, the global Japanese-based home goods retailer. Overall, the model of the Coasean\nfirm, with its singular decision-maker, is rapidly changing, where sociality increasingly plays the\nfunctional role of extending rationality and signaling.\nThird and finally, sociality serves the function of matching and fostering identity. Many\ncrowd-related practices are social movement\u00adlike entities, where ideology and purpose are read-\nily intermingled with work and economic activity. These social movements may feature monetary\nmotivations. But more often than not these may remain peripheral, as intrinsic and prosocial\ndrivers motivate participation and contribution (Benkler, 2017; O'Mahony and Lakhani, 2011).\nFor example, the open source software movement for many is laden with strong ideological\naspirations, which are deeply political, social, and even revolutionary (Stallman, 2002). Perhaps\nan unintended and surprising by-product and outcome of the open source software movement has\nbeen the massive growth of profitable opportunities and businesses, which have been layered and\nbuilt on top of the free software movement. For some these hybrid open/closed, free/priced out-\ncomes are fundamentally incoherent and problematic (Stallman, 2009).\nHowever, this incoherence now essentially constitutes the heterogeneous souk of hybrid forms\nand ways of organizing that somehow touch nearly all aspects of the economy. The debates about\nthe underlying motivations and purposes of these models will undoubtedly continue (for an over-\nview, see Von Krogh et al., 2012), with some arguing that extrinsic motivation and incentives\ncontinue to play the more significant role (Lerner and Tirole, 2002), and yet others arguing that all\nthis activity simply represents a type of selfish market logic (Raymond, 2001). But regardless of\none's views, the underlying organizational landscape and locus of innovation has certainly been\nsignificantly affected (Lakhani and Von Hippel, 2003; Von Hippel and Von Krogh, 2003).\nArguably one of the strongest effects has come in the form of how individuals think about their\nidentities, and even the very purposes of social organization. Personal identities are closely inter-\nKrogh et al., 2012) and individuals seek to self-select into organizations that match their own\nidentities. In other words, various heterogeneous forms, and the social identities and causes that\nthey espouse, provide individuals an opportunity to match their own identities with those organiza-\ntions, collectives and purposes that they see as worthwhile. For some purists, the open software\nmovement is akin to a broader social movement that questions the very foundations of capitalism\n(S\u00f6derberg, 2015), while, again, for others these movements simply represent an alternative form\nof markets (cf. Lerner and Tirole (2002)). But these open and closed organizing forms exist simul-\ntaneously and allow individuals to select and match their own identities with the espoused iden-\ntities and purposes of the organization, for example, whether for profit or not. The \"Creative\nCommons\" initiative provides an apt example of this, where producers of copyright-able content\ncan choose whether to allow free, staged (semi-free), or strict use of their content, and where those\nusing this content, whether for ideological or practical reasons, can, in turn, select which products\nto use and which not to use (Lessig, 2002). Varied forms of organization are similarly becoming\nplaces that play the functional role of allowing individuals to match their own needs, purposes, and\ninterests with those of the organization.\nHeterogeneous forms of organization have provided employees a multitude of options for\nexerting their voice and in participating more directly even in large-scale decision-making within\norganizations. Some of these democratic tendencies are organization- and industry-dependent.\nBut the increased options for how strategic activity is organized across organizations allow\nemployees the chance to self-select into those that match their propensities, interests, and broader\nsocial goals. These changes have led to a host of concepts that try to capture the identity and\nvoice-related dynamics that shape strategy and innovation. For example, some scholars have\ncalled for research on so-called \"open strategy,\" where the questions of inclusion, participation,\nand transparency play a central role (Hautz et al., 2016; also see Birkinshaw, 2016). Others have\ncontrasted traditional bureaucracy with a \"conversational firm\" (Turco, 2016), where conversa-\ntion rather than directives, fiat, or hierarchy coordinates economic activity. Identity-related\nissues loom large in all these literatures and provide an opportunity for future theoretical devel-\nopment and empirical work.\nCertainly the Coasean model of people doing something \"because they are ordered to do so\"\n(Coase, 1937: 287) feels antiquated given many of the above developments toward openness and\nvaried forms of sharing, social interaction, and sociality. Knowledge-based workers expect to join\norganizations where they can have meaningful input into how they work, what they work on, and\neven what the organization as a whole aspires toward. This is not to say that managers will com-\npletely disappear (Foss and Klein, 2014), or that hierarchies and bureaucracies will be completely\nsupplanted by flat structures. Although the identity and voice-related dynamics are an increasing\nreality for most organizations, as the informational conduits such as social media create avenues\nfor employees to have their say (Turco, 2016).\nOf course, the function of sociality as matching and fostering identity is not just delimited to\nemployees but also outside stakeholders. Customers and broader stakeholders (e.g. investors)\nincreasingly demand transparency and they exert voice by, for example, not buying a company's\nproducts if they do not align with their own identity or if information about ethical or other\nviolations are made public. Furthermore, external pressure groups--boycotts, or collective action\norchestrated by social movements--are also increasingly central to strategy itself (King and\nWalker, 2014). External or outside stakeholders can also play an important role in directing the\nattention and even structure of firms (Crilly and Sloan, 2013). Overall, organizations fundamen-\ntally depend on these external constituents, as they can exert voice and thus materially shape\norganizational outcomes (King et al., 2010).\nForms of sociality\nSo far we have discussed the functions of sociality in the abstract, without getting into the specific\nforms that sociality can take. Our discussion of the forms of sociality is not meant as a comprehen-\nsive catalog of the varied organizational forms that relate to crowds and innovation. We only point\ntoward many crowd-type phenomena as examples of specific forms of sociality. More fine-grained\ndiscussions of what each of these forms is, and how they differ, can be found in our previous work\n(e.g. Felin and Zenger, 2014; Lakhani et al., 2013), as well as the work of many others (e.g.\nHere, we are concerned with the forms of sociality that are either (a) independent, aggregate,\n\"thin,\" and nominal within or across organizations and markets or (b) interacting, \"thick,\" and\nintensive within and across organizations and markets. Thus, the ways in which individuals aggre-\ngate and interact--whether deliberate, designed or not--represent broad forms with differential\nimplications for strategy and innovation (cf. Barney and Felin, 2013). Our interests here can be\nseen as meta-theoretical and related to areas such as organizational design (cf. Gulati et al., 2012),\nwith particular attention on sociality and innovation. While we make a distinction between thin and\nnominal sociality versus thick, more intensive sociality, our focus is largely on the former as past\nresearch has already covered the stronger sense of sociality in the context of organizational forms.\nAnd naturally there is overlap between these categories. However, we think making this distinction\nis useful for theoretically understanding various crowd-related practices in the context of strategy\nand innovation.\nThe very simplest form of sociality is one that is only nominal, or put differently, aggregate or\n\"thin.\" This is where individuals independently--in whatever collective setting--produce, assess,\nand judge outcomes, and the sum total of the individual behavior or efforts somehow gets pooled\nand aggregated (or averaged) to the collective level (for helpful intuition on this from the levels of\nanalysis literature, see Klein et al., 1994). The micro organizational literature has powerfully wres-\ntled with these issues--for example, independent or nominal versus interdependent groups, aggre-\ngate versus emergent effects. But the strategy and innovation domain features unique considerations\nthat deserve careful attention (cf. Barney and Felin, 2013), as these have a bearing on new forms\nof strategy and innovation.\nPerhaps the simplest example of nominal sociality and aggregation that is pertinent to the strategy\nand innovation domain is the idea of the \"wisdom of crowds\" (Surowiecki, 2004). The intuition\nbehind the wisdom of crowds--and \"crowdsourcing\" more generally--of course originated from the\nwork of polymath Francis Galton and his (1907) Nature article \"Vox Populi.\" Galton--who also\ninvented the concepts and notions of correlation and regression (Stigler, 1989)--sets out to prove the\n\"stupidity and wrongheadedness of men and women,\" specifically by having individuals (indepen-\ndently, without influence) estimate the weight of an ox that he had placed at the entrance of the\nPlymouth Country Fair. He received 787 guesses from the public. These estimates of course varied\nsignificantly, with many far off the mark. But intriguingly, in the nominal aggregate, the individual\nestimates yielded an average of 1198 lbs, which was just one pound off the actual 1197 lbs weight of\nthe ox. In other words, the nominal and aggregate \"crowd\" yielded a powerful signal.\nAcentral point of insight from this experiment goes counter to how we generally think of social-\nity, where the emphasis is placed on thick social interaction rather than independence, where any\nsociality is only nominal. But social interaction in certain settings--that is, for certain problems\nand tasks--often leads to pathologies rather than functional signals or rationality (Le Bon, 1895).\nThus, the power of Galton's experiment is in highlighting how independent and nominal sociality,\nwhile just an aggregate (or in this case, average), can powerfully be utilized to make judgments.\nThe generality of this principle has been shown to hold in other, more micro settings, such as stud-\nies of brainstorming. In that context, independent and nominal aggregation leads to a far larger and\nbetter set of ideas--including much variance--while social interaction leads to a significant reduc-\ntion in variance and to social pathologies like groupthink, information or idea suppression, and\nsocial loafing (e.g. Diehl and Stroebe, 1987). The general principle has significant economic and\nsocietal consequences as well. For example, economic bubbles emerge precisely from these types\nof pathological social interactions where well-meaning knowledge transfer and information shar-\ning create and sustain value-related distortions and pathologies that circumvent the power of inde-\npendence and the associated collective wisdom that might lie in aggregating or averaging judgments\nVarious crowd-related practices in fact are underpinned by the same statistical mechanisms that\nwere identified by Francis Galton, where independent judgment of the value or worth of certain\nactivities or products can lead to powerful insights. A statistical view, as advocated by Galton, is\nparticularly useful for understanding how and why the generation and selection of innovative ideas\ncan be performed in the context of crowds. For example, innovation contests rely on extreme value\nstatistics to find the best performing solution (Boudreau et al., 2011; Lakhani et al., 2013). A con-\ntest, at its most basic level, is the instantiation of a statistical distribution of quality for an innova-\ntion problem. Each contestant offers a range of possible solutions, creating a distribution from\nwhich the best choices, or a useful average, can be drawn. The multiple independent conjectures,\ndraws, and contributions provide the distribution, and sponsoring organization might simply pay\nfor the best performing (or extreme value) solution. Emerging evidence points to the fact that the\noutcomes of innovation contests can outperform the work done by staff in elite research institutions\nThe selection of innovative ideas that might further be developed into products and firms has\nalso achieved significant uptake in the economy (Mollick and Kuppuswamy, 2016). For example,\ncrowdfunding (equity or otherwise) might be seen as a form of this type of nominal and aggregate\nsociality, where backing and funding startups are driven, in some measure, by independent assess-\nment, evaluations, and behaviors. Individuals essentially \"vote with their money,\" providing a\nvaluable aggregate signal. Many of the settings for crowdfunding lack market-legitimating actors\nthat could recommend or provide information about these products or startup opportunities, which\nof course has its own virtues and pathologies. Interestingly, in some contexts these nominal crowds\neven outperform market experts (Mollick and Nanda, 2016). But overall, crowdfunding represents\na bottom\u00adup assessment and judgment of dispersed individuals--a form of sociality that is nomi-\nnal, but nonetheless powerful in its potential to offer a signal--about which products or companies\nmight be funded.\nOf course, the crowdfunding area has received significant attention recently and its many mani-\nfestations have been catalogued in a number of recent papers and special issues (for a review, see\nDrover et al., 2017; Fleming and Sorenson, 2016). But the theoretical mechanisms that make it\ninteresting deserve more attention. Indeed, one aim of our special issue is to provide preliminary,\ntheoretical foundations for practices such as crowdfunding. For our purposes, this phenomenon\nserves as a helpful illustration of how this practice and the form of sociality that underpins it serve\nvarious functions, as a way of extending rationality, and where the social dynamics serve as\nsensing and signal, and further where matching and the fostering of identity create powerful venues\nfor individuals to exert voice and enable collective action and the realization of innovative prod-\nucts and firms.\nIn terms of sociality and form, crowdfunding raises fundamental questions about the notion\nof expertise, which is one of the fundamental drivers or assumptions behind bureaucracy and\nhierarchy, and even the more general social structures of firms, markets, and economic activity.\nFor example, funding of economic activity is fundamentally tied to significant sources of capital,\nas represented by venture capital or private equity. But crowdfunding, for better or worse,\ndemocratizes this activity by allowing \"lay\" individuals, not necessarily experts, to back and\nsupport products and initiatives they find worthwhile (cf. Mollick and Anand, 2015). This\ndemocratization of innovative activities has also shifted the opportunity set of the wider public\nto make judgments about the potential viability of a new product or even the viability of a new\nfirm, which historically was the purview of capital markets or venture capitalists. But now the\npublic can participate in the fortunes, peaks, and valleys of this activity. These crowd-related\nphenomena might even dispense with expert judgment, or at least provide an alternative signal-\ning mechanism and mechanism of interaction. While expert judgment of course remains impor-\ntant in many settings (cf. Mollick and Nanda, 2015), even naive participants in crowd-related\nactivities have been shown, particularly in the aggregate, to beat experts (Dhami et al., 2015;\nTetlock and Gardner, 2016). There are in fact questions about just how good venture capitalists,\nsupposed experts in the domain of funding startups, are in assessing the promise and potential of\nproducts and startups. Recent, large-scale empirical analysis shows that there is no real, system-\natic expertise in the domain of venture capital (e.g. Harris et al., 2014), just as there is no mean-\ningful expertise among those who manage large institutional portfolios or private equity (e.g.\nAnother intriguing opportunity to utilize sociality and nominal aggregation is in identifying\nheretofore unidentified talent or expertise within some population or crowd. The wisdom of crowds\nbenefits from the fact that averages provide a powerful informational signal about opportunities.\nHowever, in some settings, some individuals--who ex ante would not be considered experts--in\nfact manifest beyond-average skill and abilities. For example, Budescu and Chen (2014) utilized a\ncrowd to make economic forecasts and from these forecasts identified latent experts who, over and\nover, made prescient estimates that proved useful.\nCertain innovation tournaments, competitions, and contests similarly serve as vetting mecha-\nnisms for the identification of talent and ability. The nominal sociality embedded within contests\nand their structure enable marginalized individuals (marginalized in terms of, say, technical domain\nor gender) to be given the chance to participate and succeed under circumstances of blind review\n(Jeppesen and Lakhani (2010)). Assessments of expertise might be tied to visible, stereotyped\ncharacteristics associated with particular individuals (e.g. in terms of demographic characteristics\nor education), although the process of blind submission and contribution can shift the locus of\nevaluation to what actually matters. Thus, nominal sociality in contests also emerges in the form\nof motivation to compete, compare, and potentially win by participants. The presence of others is\nboth the attraction and the motivator for effort exertion (Boudreau et al., 2016). Prediction markets\nmay serve a similar function (Cowgill et al., 2009).\nOf course, nominal and aggregate forms of sociality are only thin, that is, social in name only.\nThe literatures on organizational forms have thus focused on \"thick\" social interaction, where com-\nmon goals, cooperation, task interdependence, and a host of other factors require more careful\ncoordination and collaboration among individuals. This literature in fact has recently received a\nmuch-needed infusion of insights from a number of key papers (e.g. Fjelstad et al., 2012; Gulati\nIt is worth first stating that this \"thick\" sociality, specifically its origins, cannot simply be\nassumed, but requires an explanation of how it emerges. For example, where do common goals\ncome from (Simon, 1961)? The importance of this question was recognized by the Carnegie\ntradition. March (1963), for example, argued decades ago that \"the composition of the firm is not\ngiven; it is negotiated. The goals of the firm are not given; they are bargained\" (p. 672). It is here\nthat we see some interesting opportunities to link the functions of sociality (e.g. sociality as identity\nmatching) with the organizational forms that we observe.\nIn many cases, it is likely that the common values and goals observed within an organization,\nand the forms that these organizations take (e.g. in terms of how they are structured), are essentially\nlatently present in the sets of individuals that choose to join or select into a particular organization\nor form. That is, individuals seek to find and join causes, goals, and purposes that meet their own\naspiration and ideas. This might be seen as an overly simplistic way of thinking about common\ngoals, and sociality and form, but it nonetheless provides an important baseline assumption for any\nsocial theory (cf. Abell et al., 2014). This intuition was in fact a central component of earlier social\ntheories, although it has not received much attention in the intervening decades. For example, the\nColumbia School sociologists and social theorists such as Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955) argued that\n\"common values precede rather than follow from social interaction\" (pp. 59\u00ad60). And several dec-\nades earlier, Simmel's (1971) social theory featured a similar premise, where he began his analysis\nof form with so-called \"component individuals\" and argued that \"society exists where a number of\nindividuals enter into interaction\" (p. 23, emphasis added)--thus pointing toward the mechanism\nof choice and self-selection. We can similarly say that organizations and collectives emerge--\nincluding their latent values and goals--where individuals choose to join particular collective or\nsocial causes that fit their ex ante aspirations, preferences, identities, and interests. And these inter-\nests might not just relate to the overall purposes and goals of an organization but also to the actual\norganizational forms--and the implied structures and relations, or incentives--that are utilized to\nattain those goals. These dynamics play out in a number of different organizational and social con-\ntexts. For example, social movements are characterized by the process of individuals self-selecting\ninto them (Jasper, 2004), and similar dynamics play out in the career choices of scientists (Roach\nand Sauermann, 2010; cf. Eesley and Wang, 2017). Overall, an important mechanism behind\norganizational forms undoubtedly is this process of self-selection, where people \"vote with their\nfeet\" in terms of common goals and ideals. Indeed, self-selection is a distinguishing factor underly-\ning participation in both contests (Lakhani, 2016) and communities (Von Krogh et al., 2003).\nIndividuals choose the institutional structure, that is, whether to participate in a competition or\ncollaboration; the nature of the project, the amount of effort they will exert, and the motivating\nforce for participation. Interestingly, psychological factors, such as envy and comparison costs,\nmight also play an important role in the process of individuals self-selecting into different types of\norganizations and forms (Nickerson and Zenger, 2008).\nHaving recognized the role of self-selection in explaining common goals, it is important to also\nrecognize that thick socialization, social interactions, relations, and other social factors of course\nalso play a central role in the emergence of common purposes, goals, and organizations (e.g. Adler,\ncommunities and peer production has also focused on similar mechanisms (e.g. O'Mahony and\nFerraro, 2007). But our focus, in this section, has largely been on sociality and social form that is\nlargely nominal and aggregate. We have done so deliberately, as much of the extant organizational\nliterature has already focused on sociality that is thick, more intensive and strongly interactional\n(Zenger et al., 2011). Thus, we see value in unpacking the forms that sociality takes, and particu-\nlarly the opportunity to highlight the nominal and aggregate forms of sociality, as these relate to the\ncontext of firms, crowds, and innovation.\nForms of course can be defined in a number of different ways. Puranam et al. (2014) have\nrecently offered a helpful, generic framework for thinking forms--their \"four universals of organ-\nizing.\" They argue that any organizational form needs to consider four problems: task division,\ntask allocation, reward distribution, and information flows. Thus, they see \"organizing as problem-\nsolving,\" and more generally, organizing as division of labor and integration of effort (Puranam\nconversations with our discussion above, to further help us understand how different forms of\nsociality co-exist and interact in the context of firms and innovation.\nFor example, among the most central considerations for crowd-related practices and questions\nof openness and form is the matter of information--its processing, flows, and sharing. Various\nnew practices are in effect efforts to try to improve information processing by introducing forms\nthat create interfaces and conduits for others--customers and users, and \"crowds\" more gener-\nally--to meaningfully interact with a focal organization by way of informational inputs, such as\nproduct ideas (e.g. Chatterji and Fabrizio, 2014). The information overload that can come from\nopening the organization to its environment in this fashion, however, requires mechanisms for\nfiltering this information. Somehow the organization needs to transform the mass of possible\ninformation to knowledge and eventually some form of wisdom (Ackoff, 1989). Thus, the pro-\ncesses and forms which might allow us to generate useful knowledge from information deserve\nfurther attention. Given the data and information-intensive environments of the knowledge econ-\nomy, organizations need to find forms and mechanisms that can allow them to move from masses\nof data to information and knowledge, and eventual \"wisdom\" about which activities and strate-\ngies to pursue. The various crowd-type practices, when appropriately designed, might help firms\naccomplish this task.\nFailures of sociality\nDespite our discussion of the functions and forms of sociality, sociality of course can fail in multiple\nways. Recognizing these failures, and when and why they occur, is an important next step for the\ncrowds and \"open\" literatures, with significant implications for strategy and innovation more broadly.\nWe next discuss how the failures of sociality result from its misattribution and misapplication.\nThe exuberance about various new organizational forms and openness can lead to a rather\nuncritical stance about the possibilities of sociality, without commensurate attention on the\nZenger et al., 2011). Interestingly, early research on crowds was in fact precisely about their\nmadness, rather than about their wisdom (Le Bon, 1895). The literatures on crowds and openness\nhave been particularly susceptible to an overly positive view of crowds and openness, perhaps\nexacerbated by practitioner books that quixotically claim that these practices and forms will\nrevolutionize everything and seemingly guarantee organizational performance. But any form of\nsociality, while clearly featuring many virtues and benefits, also features attendant pathologies\nand costs. Thus, the general advocacy for particular forms of sociality or particular organiza-\ntional forms needs to include attention on the costs and problems that might result from misat-\ntributions and misapplications.\nPart of the misattribution is the result of logical and empirical mis-specifications which come\nfrom problematic interpretations about the origins of competitive advantage and organizational\nperformance. To illustrate, we might look at some form of sociality--say, an alliance (or a link with\na university) which involves intensive interaction (e.g. knowledge sharing) between two social\nentities--and assume that the sociality within the alliance itself, and the more general relational\nform, leads to positive outcomes, such as new product development or organizational performance.\nHowever, misattributions about what leads to performance can occur if the theoretical and empiri-\ncal specifications do not account for the potential of confounding causes--or put differently, endo-\ngeneity (cf. Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003)--related to the ex ante nature of the social entities or\nfirms themselves. For example, the underlying reasons why an alliance was attractive to a firm (or\nwhy some form of open relationship between a particular firm and university made sense) could be\na confounding factor. Thus, the sociality itself becomes co-varying epiphenomenon, rather than a\ncausal driver. Undoubtedly, both factors could be at play. However, it is clearly easy to misattribute\nthe performance solely to the sociality itself. Similarly in the domain of open innovation, we can\nsample on firms that are open to varying degrees--on some set of dimensions--and ascribe perfor-\nmance outcomes to this openness, but miss the underlying reasons for why they are open, when,\nand open to what. Thus, no particular variant of sociality or organizational form is a panacea. Each\nhas benefits and costs, depending on what an organization is trying to accomplish.\nA central misattribution is that the various practices and forms related to crowds and openness\nrepresent a free resource--readily available to all--without attendant costs (cf. Felin and Zenger,\n2016; Von Hippel and Von Krogh, 2016). But if crowdsourcing is seen as a practice that might\nyield product ideas and an advantage for a focal firm, naturally this practice will diffuse, and thus\nthe costs of inducing crowds and users to interact with competing firms can lead to a costly arms\nrace that in fact dissipates rather than create value. Furthermore, the use of any of these practices\nfeature additional, hidden costs related to the organization's attention and its ability to in fact\ncarry out the practices.\nRecent scholarship by us (e.g. Felin and Zenger, 2014; Lakhani et al., 2013) and many others\n(e.g. Foss, Frederiksen and Rullani, 2016; Von Hippel and Von Krogh, 2015) has sought to remedy\nthese misattributions by delineating when openness, and of what type, makes sense. This program\nof research is an attempt to generate comparative and analytic insights about when certain forms\nof sociality make sense, and when not. The specific focus in this work is on the nature of problems\nor tasks, and how clearly understanding the problem at hand (its \"formulation\") can provide guid-\nance for which types of sociality and form might be beneficial. Problems or tasks can be complex\nand interdependent, or independent and modular. And the information and knowledge needed for\nsolving these problems can be housed within the firm, or the firm may have to access knowledge\nfrom outside its boundaries.\nOverall, talk about openness broadly, in the abstract, misses the more fine-grained, analytic\nnuance that is needed to specify when certain forms or governance structures make sense, and\nwhen not--and what an organization should be open to and why. Championing openness and thick\nforms of sociality has had the effect of throwing a wet blanket over the more careful analysis that\nneeds to be done about the failures that might relate to certain forms of sociality and openness.\nAfter all, organizations can be open to widely different things--ideas, people, knowledge, funds,\nand so forth--and thus coarse references to the benefits miss not only the costs but the more\ndetailed and contingent specifics that help us understand the comparative dynamics between dif-\nferent forms, the problems that they solve, and the overall architecture and structure of innovation.\nThankfully recent work has moved in these directions (West et al., 2014). Although, in terms of the\nfailures (and benefits) of sociality, it is in this--more fine-grained, analytic, and theory-driven--\ndomain that we see significant opportunities for future work on crowds, firms, and innovation.\nIntroduction to special issue\nThe special issue papers and essays can broadly be introduced by highlighting how they relate to\ntheories of the firm and crowds, particularly in terms of our overall framework that focuses on the\nfunctions, forms, and failures of sociality.\nPapers\nIn the first paper, Kolbjornsrud studies how varied agency problems are introduced and solved\nwithin different types of collaborative communities. His paper is a deep dive into the specific func-\ntions--designed and emergent--of sociality within different types of communities. The organiza-\ntional literature tends to talk about communities as a monolith. But Kolbjornsrud shows how mutual\nmonitoring, membership restrictions, values and rules, and incentives vary significantly across these\ncommunities. His research suggests opportunities for future work to more carefully understand and\nspecify the comparative dynamics within, rather than across, organizational forms (in this case,\ncommunities), and to further specify the linkages to \"pure\" forms such as firms and markets.\nIn the second paper, Kornberger focuses on the structural and design-related aspects of various\ninnovation systems. He argues that interface design in innovation systems and the design of partici-\npatory architectures, as well as the design of evaluative infrastructures, are essential components\nof innovation systems. Kornberger particularly contrasts visible hand versus more distributed\nforms of decision-making and social interaction and also highlights the novel linkages between the\ntwo. The paper offers a unique view of innovation, touching on both the functional and form-\nrelated aspects of sociality.\nManning and Bejarano study how entrepreneurs elicit participation, engagement, and behavior\nthrough framing. In other words, organizations (or those seeking funding) can influence crowds\nand potential funders by how they communicate their projects and products to external constitu-\nents. Manning and Bejarano specifically look at how entrepreneurs mobilize crowds to fund their\nprojects through different narratives. Their paper highlights how mobilization is not necessarily\ntied to the nature of projects or opportunities themselves, per se, but is also influenced by how these\nare \"packaged\" to different constituents and crowds. Their paper can be seen as an effort to under-\nstand how organizations can functionally \"use\" crowds to accomplish their desired ends.\nSeidel, Langner, and Sims focus on how the stage and evolution of technology shape which\ncrowds are relevant for further technological evolution. In essence, certain types of communities\nand crowds serve different functional purposes at different stages of the technology lifecycle. Thus,\ncrowds and various innovation-relevant communities can be understood as playing an important,\nunique role, depending on the stage and development of technologies. Seidel et al.'s approach thus\noffers us a contingent view of the functional use of crowds, which represents precisely the type of\nnuanced, forward-looking scholarship called for in this Special Issue.\nFinally, Vuculescu studies how humans engage in cognitive search and problem-solving by\nimposing their models and theories onto the world. She uses both an agent-based approach and\nexperiment to develop her arguments. While the \"crowds\" in her model are nominal, nonetheless\nthe paper suggests future opportunities to consider how aggregate and social models of environ-\nments might influence organizational search and problem-solving. Furthermore, her paper raises\nimportant micro\u00admacro questions related to how cognitive models aggregate in social settings such\nas organizations. Thus, her paper can be seen as a stepping stone to study the factors discussed by\nus above, the functions, forms, and failures of sociality.\nEssays\nThis Special Issue also features three essays on the broad topic of firms, crowds, and innovation.\nThese essays are written by prominent scholars from the disciplines of law and sociology, organi-\nzation theory, and strategy. The authors offer broad, forward-looking reflections and ideas on how\nthe nature of innovation and organization is evolving and changing in the context of the various\ncrowd-type practices and phenomena discussed in this Special Issue.\nIn the first essay, Yochai Benkler focuses on peer production, a particular form of sociality, and\nargues that it serves a number of functions. He specifically argues for the comparative advantages\nof peer production, relative to firms and markets, and highlights how they build on prosocial and\nintrinsic motivations in emphasizing the commons. Benkler argues that various market mecha-\nnisms can serve as a hindrance for more radical forms of innovation and growth, which can be\nfostered and enabled by forms such as peer production and community. This essay is a provocative\ncontribution to this Special Issue and further builds on Benkler's (2002) path-breaking work on the\nchanging nature of production and innovation in society.\nIn the second essay, Nickerson, Wuebker, and Zenger can be seen as focusing on all three\naspects of sociality: functions, forms, and failures. They specifically outline how the use of differ-\nent forms of crowds represents a governance choice. They argue that different innovation problems\ncan be solved by different crowds, by allowing firms access to the positive aspects of sociality in\nsome cases, and avoiding costs and failures in other cases. Their work links these conversations\nwith the problem-solving perspective (Nickerson and Zenger, 2004), which has recently received\nsignificant attention in the innovation and strategy literatures.\nFinally, in the third essay, Woody Powell raises questions about whether various crowd-related\nphenomena are new (in terms of function and form) and also aptly points out the failures of social-\nity that might emerge from these practices and increased openness. Thus, Powell considers social-\nity more broadly and argues that the comparative benefits offered, for example, by secure\nemployment within firms may have led to increased precariousness in terms of careers and the\neconomy more widely. His essay raises the broader consequences of various crowd-related prac-\ntices, with psychological, economic, and sociological implications for individuals and their careers,\nfirms, and their performance and responsibility, as well as societal welfare.\nConclusion\nNew organizational practices and forms--for example, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, user innova-\ntion, and peer production--are changing our understanding of the locus and nature of innovation.\nThe purpose of this Special Issue is to take stock of these changes and to highlight associated impli-\ncations for theories of the firm and our broader understanding of innovation and strategy. We have\nspecifically focused on the concept of sociality--its functions, forms, and failures--and suggested\nthat attention on these factors will help us make theoretical progress in the organizational and strat-\negy literatures. Furthermore, attention on sociality, as we have discussed, suggests significant\nempirical opportunities for future work. We link these ideas to the special issue papers essays. As a\nset, these paper suggest that the innovation and organization literatures are at a critical juncture, and\nthat future research and practice on innovation will necessarily need to be distinct from the past.\nThis period of ferment calls for new theory and fresh observation within the firm and between the\nfirms, markets, and communities. Overall, our hope is that this Special Issue stimulates precisely\nthis type of research, which will further help us understand the sociality of innovation and strategy.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or pub-\nlication of this article: The authors would like to thank Oxford Sa\u00efd Business School's research fund for\nfunding the special issue workshop in Oxford and the \"Organizing Crowds\"-project.\nReferences\nAbell P, Felin T, and Foss N (2014) Microfoundations of social theory: A response to Jepperson and Meyer.\nAckoff R (1989) From data to wisdom.
