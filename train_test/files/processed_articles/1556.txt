Multiple cause-of-death\ndata files can list as many as 20 contributing causes of death in addition to the reported underlying cause of death.\nAnalysis of multiple cause-of-death data can provide information on associations between causes of death, re-\nvealing common combinations of events or conditions which lead to death. Additionally, physicians report the\ncausal train of events through which they believe that different conditions or events may have led to each other and\nultimately caused death. In this paper, the authors discuss methods used in studying associations between\nreported causes of death and in investigating commonly reported causal pathways between events or conditions\nlisted on the death certificate.\ncause of death; death certificates; mortality\nAbbreviations: EOR, exposure odds ratio; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; MCOD, multiple cause-of-death; MOR, mortality\nodds ratio.\nDeath certificate data are generally analyzed by examin-\ning the underlying cause of death as reported on the death\ncertificate by the medical examiner (1). However, deaths\nrarely have only one cause, and this method does not allow\nresearchers to assess the role of conditions that were impor-\ntant contributors to death but were not reported as the un-\nderlying cause. Multiple cause-of-death (MCOD) data offer\nan alternative. MCOD data specify the underlying cause of\ndeath but also include data on other contributing causes of\ndeath (2). Thus, more complete information on factors and\ndiseases causing death can be utilized.\nMCOD data can be useful in a number of ways. In this\npaper, we focus specifically on the utility of MCOD data for\nthe analysis of associations between causes of death. We\ndescribe methods that can be used to test associations be-\ntween conditions in MCOD data and to suggest possible\ncausal relations. In order to provide examples of the types\nof analyses we describe, we refer to our previously pub-\nlished analysis of the 114,380 deaths reported in the United\nlisted as a cause of death in MCOD coded data (3).\nThe simplest analysis of association between conditions\nin death certificate data involves examining the frequency\nwith which two conditions are reported together. For exam-\nple, an analysis of all 114,380 death certificates listing pres-\nsure ulcers as a cause of death reveals that septicemia is also\nSince this percentage is far higher than we would expect to\nsee among decedents without pressure ulcers, we may con-\nclude that some association between pressure ulcers and\nsepticemia is present in death certificate data.\nHowever, it may not always be clear whether the percent-\nage of death certificates reporting comorbidity is different\nCorrespondence to Matthew D.

This\nfigure is not substantially higher or lower than we would\nexpect, so it is difficult to discern whether or not an associ-\nation exists between reporting of pressure ulcers and report-\ning of heart disease in death certificate data.\nIn order to solve this problem, we can conduct a case-\ncontrol study comparing deaths from the condition of\ninterest with deaths from other conditions. The use of mortal-\nity odds ratios (MORs) and exposure odds ratios (EORs) in\ncase-control studies with mortality data is preferable to the\ntraditional use of the proportional mortality ratio (4). The\nMOR and EOR differ in that the MOR assumes the condi-\ntion (pressure ulcers) used for case/control selection to be\nthe outcome, while the EOR assumes it to be the exposure.\nIn our data, we suppose that if a causal association exists\nbetween pressure ulcers and septicemia, pressure ulcers will\nact as the exposure and septicemia as the outcome. Thus, in\norder to calculate an MOR, we would have to use septicemia\ndeaths as cases and choose nonsepticemia deaths as con-\ntrols. In contrast, if we wanted to calculate the EOR, we\nwould compare pressure-ulcer-associated deaths with a con-\ntrol sample of non-pressure-ulcer-associated deaths. The\ndifference between the MOR and the EOR is largely a dif-\nference of terminology. Although the two figures are calcu-\nlated using different sampling procedures, they are\nestimates of the same quantity. Thus, the MOR and the\nEOR will differ only to the extent that error is present in\nthe selection of controls, and controls may be selected ran-\ndomly so that the difference between MOR and EOR re-\nflects only random error. Additionally, when testing possible\ncausal associations between causes of death, it is not possi-\nble to prove which variable is the outcome and which is the\nexposure. Thus, the terms MOR and EOR reflect a re-\nsearcher's educated guess as to the direction of causation\nin the analysis being performed. To the extent that EOR and\nMOR differ, it is not possible to know which figure is pref-\nerable to use unless additional information is present. How-\never, we mention the difference between MOR and EOR\nbecause correct identification of the exposure variable in\ncase-control studies can be important in identifying poten-\ntial confounders for stratification and in the selection of\nappropriate controls (4).\nStratification may be necessary to modify crude MOR\nand EOR figures because persons who die of pressure ulcers\nmay be different in a number of ways from decedents with-\nout pressure ulcers. For example, they will probably be older\nand thus more likely to be reported as suffering from heart\ndisease. The presence of factors, such as age, which exert an\neffect on the exposure (heart disease) and are related to the\noutcome (pressure ulcers) may introduce confounding. Var-\nious methods of stratification are available to control for\nconfounding, including the use of the standardized mortality\nodds ratio (5). However, we focus here on the use of\nmatched comparisons because of their utility even when\ndata are sparse in some strata. In matched comparisons,\na matched control is selected for each case from other deaths\nthat are similar to the case with respect to age, sex, race/\nethnicity, or any other factors for which we desire to control.\nMatched mortality odds ratios (mMORs) or matched expo-\nsure odds ratios (mEORs) are then calculated in order to\nestimate the magnitude of the association between the con-\nditions. While the selection of matched controls does not\ncontrol for confounding on its own, the calculation of\nmMORs (or mEORs) does. mMORs (and mEORs) treat\neach individual matched pair as a single stratum and intro-\nduce stratification by the variables used in the matching\nprocess.\nAs with odds ratios in other types of matched pair studies\n(6, 7), matched statistics are calculated by examining dis-\ncordant pairs, where either the case is exposed and the con-\ntrol is unexposed or the case is unexposed and the control is\nexposed (see table 1).\nThe following equations are used (6, 7):\nmMOR \u00bc mEOR \u00bc B=C\nand\nVar\u00bdln\u00f0mMOR\u00de \u00bc Var\u00bdln\u00f0mEOR\u00de \u00bc 1=B\u00fe1=C:\nIn our sample of pressure-ulcer-associated deaths (3),\nmatched exposure odds ratios confirm our suspicion that\na strong association exists between reporting of pressure\nulcers and reporting of septicemia in death certificate data\nIn contrast, a negative association was found between re-\nporting of pressure ulcers and reporting of heart disease\nGenerally, when we speak of two conditions as being\n``associated'' with each other, we mean that the presence\nof one condition indicates a higher or lower probability that\nthe other condition will also be present. However, physi-\ncians filling out death certificates only report conditions that\nthey believe were instrumental in causing death. They do not\nreport all prevalent conditions. Thus, death certificate data\ncannot indicate whether septicemia is more likely to be\npresent in decedents with pressure ulcers than in decedents\nwithout them. They can only indicate whether septicemia is\nmore likely to act as a cause of death when pressure ulcers\nare also a cause of death than when they are not. This in-\nformation has real clinical significance, suggesting the im-\nportance of septicemia prevention and treatment in persons\nwith pressure ulcers as a mechanism for preventing death.\nHowever, associations in death certificate data should not be\nTABLE 1.

It is possible that persons in the general population\nwith pressure ulcers are more likely to have or develop\nsepticemia, but death certificate data do not measure the\nprevalence of either condition and can only provide indirect\nsupport for such a theory.\nAdditionally, selection bias can threaten the validity of\ninferences derived from a case-control study. Selection bias\nmay arise when both outcome and exposure status influence\nthe inclusion of subjects in a study. In case-control study\ndesigns, an association necessarily exists between the out-\ncome and selection, since subjects are enrolled in the study\non the basis of their disease status. Consequently, any asso-\nciation between exposure status and selection will lead to\nselection bias. In order to be included in a case-control study\nof mortality data, a person must have died. Thus, any expo-\nsure that increases the likelihood that someone will die\nalso increases the likelihood that the person will be included\nin the study, generating a type of selection bias termed\nBerksonian bias (5). For example, suppose an investigator\nwere interested in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nas a potential risk factor for heart disease and sought to\nestimate the association between these conditions using\ndeath certificate data. Persons would initially be included\nin the study based on the presence of heart disease on the\ndeath certificate, creating an association between heart dis-\nease and selection. In addition, persons with the exposure,\nHIV, would also be more likely to be included in the study,\nsince HIV infection increases the likelihood that a person\nwill die. This would probably cause persons with HIV to\nbe overrepresented in death data relative to the general\npopulation.\nSince most medical conditions listed on death certificates\nought to have contributed to death, it is reasonable to expect\nthat some level of Berksonian bias will operate in nearly all\nassociations estimated between causes of death listed on\ndeath certificates. Berksonian bias can be limited, however,\nby selecting controls who died from conditions thought to\nbe unassociated with the exposure. A second form of selec-\ntion bias known as detection bias (8) can occur if the expo-\nsure and outcome conditions are thought to be associated. In\nthis case, persons with the exposure condition may be more\nlikely to be tested for the outcome condition and thus will be\nmore likely to be identified as cases in the study.\nDeath certificate data may also be affected by reporting\nbias. At the simplest level, reporting bias may result from\nincorrect diagnoses' being recorded on the death certificate.\nHowever, a more systematic type of reporting bias is also\npossible. In our data, the number of death certificates that\nrecorded both septicemia and pressure ulcers as causes of\ndeath may be an artifact, in part, of common medical opin-\nions among physicians filling out death certificates. The bi-\nologic plausibility of a connection between pressure ulcers\nand septicemia is high. Thus, a physician filling out a death\ncertificate for a person who died of septicemia and had\na severe pressure ulcer might mistakenly assume that both\nconditions contributed to death. The opposite can also oc-\ncur; most conditions (such as heart disease in the example\nabove) are not thought of as being associated with the de-\nvelopment or progression of pressure ulcers. Even if both\nheart disease and pressure ulcers were important contribu-\ntors to death, physicians may be unlikely to list heart disease\nand pressure ulcers on the same death certificate, simply\nbecause of the low biologic plausibility of the two condi-\ntions' acting in concert to cause death.\nIn the case of models using a matched design, a special\ntype of selection bias known as overmatching bias may be\npresent (4). While matching on true confounders will not\ncause this type of bias, matching on any factor which is af-\nfected by the exposure variable and is related to the outcome\nvariable may introduce overmatching bias, and in some sit-\nuations this bias cannot be eliminated analytically. Thus, it\nis important to select matching variables carefully. The com-\nmon use of demographic variables such as age, race, and sex\nfor matching should not introduce overmatching bias, since\nthese variables are unlikely to be affected by the exposure.\nWhile matched odds ratios are unable to indicate causal\nrelations between conditions, epidemiologic methods of\ncausal inference are available (8, 9). Some types of evidence\ntypically used to imply causation (such as a dose-response\nrelation or temporality) cannot be examined using death\ncertificate data, but others can. The strong biologic plausi-\nbility of a causal relation between pressure ulcers and sep-\nticemia provides some evidence that the association we\nobserved may be causal. Additionally, the strength of the\nrelation (mEOR \u00bc 11.3, 95 percent confidence interval:\nweak or moderate biases alone (however, strong biases\nmay exist in death certificate data).\nIn addition to standard epidemiologic methods of causal\ninference, death certificate data contain information on the\nsupposed causal train of events leading to death, as reported\nby the physician. The US Standard Certificate of Death has\ntwo sections in which cause-of-death data can be entered\n(figure 1). In part I, the physician is asked to describe the\ncausal train of events which led to death. The condition\nreported on line a of part I is the immediate cause of death,\nthe last condition in the causal train of events leading to\ndeath. It is caused by the condition or event (if any) reported\non line b, which in turn is caused by the condition or event\n(if any) reported on line c.\nThis information is recorded in MCOD data in the entity\naxis code variables (10). Entity axis codes provide research-\ners with International Classification of Diseases codes for\nthe conditions or events reported in part I and also note\nwhich line of part I the physician originally used to report\neach condition or event. Thus, in the above example, if a\npressure ulcer is reported on line b and septicemia is re-\nported on line a, we may suppose that the physician believed\nthe pressure ulcer to be a cause of septicemia, which in turn\ncaused death. Entity axis data are not always clear. While\nonly one condition should be reported per line in part I, this\nrule is not always followed. For example, a physician may\nreport ``septic pressure ulcer infection'' on line a of part I. In\nthis case, both septicemia and pressure ulcers will be coded\nin MCOD data as having been entered on line a and it will\nnot be possible, using the data alone, to determine the causal\ndeaths were identified for which pressure ulcers and septi-\ncemia were indicated on the same line of the death certifi-\ncate, such that the direction of causation was unclear.\npressure ulcers and septicemia were both listed in part I,\nsepticemia was listed as being ``due to or a consequence\nof'' pressure ulcers. It is unlikely that such a strong trend\nwould be observed by chance alone.\nHowever, causal pathways reported in entity axis codes\nonly reflect physicians' best judgment about the causal train\nof events. It is not possible, using death certificate data, to\ndetermine which criteria the physician used to infer causa-\ntion. The physician may have reasoned incorrectly or may\nhave had insufficient information with which to adequately\nassess the causal train of events leading to death, and there-\nfore caution must be exercised.\nIn certain cases, we may be able to recreate and validate\nthe physician's process of causal inference with a reasonable\npercent) cases for which multiple sclerosis and pressure\nulcers were both reported in part I of the death certificate,\npressure ulcers were reported as being a result of multiple\nsclerosis. It is reasonable for a physician to assume that\na person with an incapacitating case of multiple sclerosis\nwould not have developed a severe pressure ulcer in the\nabsence of multiple sclerosis. However, in some cases, the\nphysician's process of causal inference may be unclear, or it\nmay even be apparent that the physician's reporting cannot\nreflect true causation. Six death certificates were found in\nwhich multiple sclerosis was reported as having resulted\nfrom pressure ulcers. Current medical knowledge suggests\nthat this is unlikely, and so few physicians reported this\ncausal pathway that it is quite possible they did so uninten-\ntionally. To the extent that physicians' reasoning is unclear\nor seems incorrect, causal pathways reported in entity axis\ncodes should be given less credence.\nWhile part I of the death certificate only allows for the\nreporting of a single train of events leading to death, cau-\nsality may be extremely complicated in real situations.\nDeaths may be caused by multiple trains of events which\nmay or may not converge. Thus, physicians are also pro-\nvided with part II (figure 1), in which they can record other\nconditions or events that contributed to death but were not\nlisted in part I. It is not possible to establish a causal relation\nbetween these conditions and those reported in part I,\nthough such a relation may exist. Of the 45,374 death cer-\ntificates that listed both pressure ulcers and septicemia as\ncauses of death, either pressure ulcers or septicemia was\nno causal relation was indicated.\nAdditionally, data from entity axis codes are recoded to\ngenerate record axis code variables. While entity axis codes\nreflect data originally reported by the examiner, record axis\ncodes reflect ``cleaned'' data, in which some conditions are\nrecoded to better match the context of other conditions or\nevents reported on the death certificate (11). For example,\nsuppose that a medical examiner reports both alcohol de-\npendence syndrome and cirrhosis of the liver without men-\ntion of alcohol as a cause of death. Both conditions will be\nshown in entity axis code data. However, in record axis code\ndata, they will be replaced with a single condition: alcoholic\ncirrhosis of the liver. Unfortunately, record axis code data do\nnot reflect the position in which conditions are recorded in\nthe causal train of events leading to death.\nCONCLUSIONS\nLike all data, death certificate data are imperfect, and it is\nimportant to understand their limitations before attempting\nto interpret associations observed in the data.

MCOD data are free and\nprovide an easily available source of population-based infor-\nmation on causes of death and associations between causes of\ndeath. While studies utilizing death certificate data cannot\nprove the existence of causal relations, entity axis code data\nprovide an additional source of information on the causal\npathways physicians believe to have resulted in death.\n"
