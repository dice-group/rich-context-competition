A statistically insignificant correlation was found between either construct; however, qualitative\nanalysis provides implications for teachers on the power of student reflection. Foremost, reflective activities do not appear\nto detract from academic performance nor have a negative correlation with student motivation. Furthermore, reflective\nactivities in the short term appear to affect students on an affective level rather than a cognitive level.\n",

However, my mine is long aban-\ndoned and well worn. Long gone are the fancy machines,\nsparkling tools, and multitude of workers who once labored\nto discover the sparkling gems that lie beneath. Now, all that\nis left are myself and the hard to find diamonds--the ones\nthat take excruciating effort to locate, yet are still highly\nvaluable once they are finally discovered and polished. My\ntools are limited. Fancy equipment and influx of supplies are\na distant memory; therefore, I rely on ingenuity and, perhaps\nmost importantly, my mind to reveal the treasures that were\nleft behind in the rapidity and oversight of my predecessors.\nOf course, the diamonds I am referring to are carbon based,\nbut they are not the gems that adorn the fingers and necks of\nother people--they are people; students to be exact. However,\nthese students, much like the remnants left behind in an\nabandoned mine, struggle to be recognized for both their\nbeauty and potential for success. As their teacher, I often feel\nlike the lone miner who has unlimited access to their aban-\ndoned prize, and although it can be a difficult challenge to\nuncover and polish the gems that are locked deep within the\nearth, the feeling of zeal and passion when one is discovered\nis second to none.\nIn a world of equitable education for all, it is surprising\nthat these students have been relegated to near abandonment.\nWhile their dominant culture or high aptitude peers have been\ntransitioned into college bound tracks and advanced courses,\nthese students have simply slipped into despair due to a quag-\nmire of issues: learning disabilities, low-socioeconomic sta-\ntus, broken homes, behavioral struggles, constant moving\nbetween schools, and interactions with teachers who are\neither unprepared to meet their individual needs or frustrated\nwith their constant need for remediation, both academically\nand affectively. Consequently, our system's most struggling\nstudents are often passed along without the requisite skills\nneeded to succeed in life or are simply cast off just like the\ndiamonds in the mine whose cost to extract outweighs their\nperceived value in the open market. However, the fact that\ntheir inherent value has not been initially recognized is not\nalways cause for alarm because there are prospectors among\nus who are always on the hunt to discover the jewel that still\nlies within each and every one of these students: the potential\nto become empowered members of society through access\nand support within our educational system.\nAs a teacher within fragile populations, I have noticed\nthat many of my students lack the motivation to complete\nassignments or display a lack of confidence in their academic\nabilities. However, what is most interesting to me is that my\nstudents are far more capable than they perceive themselves\nto be. When probed about the disconnect between their\npotential and their actual performance, many of my students\nexplain that they have been told in the past that they are sub-\npar or have been made to feel like failures due to constant\ncomparison with other students. Consequently, their motiva-\ntion to complete work wanes because they feel inadequate\nand their perspective on their abilities is skewed due to a lack\nof feedback or positive attention. This, combined with the\ngeneral apathy and lack of motivation often seen among high\n1Public Charter School, Orlando, FL, USA\n2University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDerek Cavilla, Adjunct Instructor, University of Central Florida, Orlando,\nThe Effects of Student Reflection on\nAcademic Performance and Motivation\n Keywords\nreflection, motivation, metacognition, underserved students, affective development\n2 SAGE Open\nschool students who are near graduation, is highly problem-\natic for both the student and the teacher because precious\nlearning time and opportunities are being lost at a critical\nstage in life--a time when youth are making the transition to\nadulthood and must be prepared to enter either an institution\nof higher learning, the military, or the workforce.\nThis conundrum is the basis for my study. In wondering\nhow I could improve overall student motivation and self-\nconcept, I honed in on the idea of reflection as a tool not only\nto enhance students' affective psyche, but their academic\nperformance as well. As a passionate and caring teacher, I\ntake extra time to provide my students with feedback on all\ntheir assignments and am sure to point out the positive\naspects of their work and efforts in my class. This is an\nanomaly for many of my students and, at first, they are often\nunsure if the grades and feedback they are receiving are hon-\nest and accurate. Over time, they begin to realize that they\nhave significant talent and skills; however, until this realiza-\ntion is internalized and reinforced on an intrapersonal level,\nthere is a possibility for relapse and regression. Therefore, it\nis my hope that the introduction of a mandatory, structured\nreflection as part of assignments in my class will yield posi-\ntive results in the form of less missing assignments and\nimproved performance on academic tasks. Asking students\nto examine their own efforts on assignments as well as\nrequiring them to formally state their rationale for complet-\ning or choosing not to complete activities through reflection\nwill provide them with the personal insight and intrapersonal\ncognition that is required for success not only in the educa-\ntional arena, but in professional and higher education set-\ntings as well.\nA significant amount of research and resources regarding\nreflection are focused on teachers, not students, and have\nmore prevalence either in contexts outside of education, such\nas in Mountford and Rogers's (1996) study on the use of\nreflection in nursing, or in institutions of higher education,\nsuch as Yost, Sentner, and Forlenza-Bailey's (2000) notion of\nreflection as the primary component of an effective teacher,\nrather than in primary or secondary school settings. In addi-\ntion, while reflection could be seen as a type of self-evalua-\ntion, my action research is not focused on students' actual\nability to evaluate their own work. Rather, students are asked\nto reflect on their perceived effort and to gauge their overall\nperformance of the task at hand, a concept discussed and\nclarified by Kritt (1993) as metacognition or thinking about\none's own thinking. While metacognition is a construct too\nlarge to review in the context of this study, research indicates\nthat students with higher metacognitive ability are often\nmore successful than those who lack this skill (Sperling,\nRichmond, Ramsay, & Klapp, 2012). Therefore, the purpose\nof this study is not to focus on the benefit of teacher reflec-\ntion or the use of reflection as self-evaluation, but rather on\nreflection as a tool for improved student metacognitive prac-\ntices and academic performance as previously investigated\nwith success by Ash, Clayton, and Atkinson (2005); Lew and\nSchmidt (2011); and--as specifically examined for under-\nserved high school populations such as the context for this\nstudy--Cleary, Platten, and Nelson (2008). This focus cul-\nminates in the research question for this study:\nResearch Question 1: To what extent does student reflec-\ntion correlate with academic achievement and motivation\nto complete assignments for underserved students in 11th-\nand 12th-grade English?\nReview of Literature\nThe goal of this study is to determine if a correlation exists\nbetween student self-reflection and academic performance\nand motivation. This review of literature will serve to\ninform the following aspects of my research: how reflec-\ntion is defined, how reflection has evolved over time,\nwhat previous research has discovered regarding any\npotential connections between student self-reflection and\nacademic performance and motivation, as well as the\nimplications for teachers who may or may not currently be\nutilizing reflective exercises in their own classrooms. As\ndiscussed by Yancey (1998), \"[i]f we don't ask our stu-\ndents to [reflect on] their own work--a process based on\ninternal factors and criteria--they are likely to [remain]\ndependent on external rewards, now knowing where to\nbegin to consider their own performance\" (p. 14).\nMoreover, students who are explicitly taught metacogni-\ntive activities, such as written self-reflection, tend to be\nmore highly engaged in their school work as well as main-\ntain higher levels of academic proficiency (McCormick,\nWhile reflection could be seen as a type of self-evalua-\ntion, my research was not focused on students' actual ability\nto evaluate their own work. Rather, they were asked to reflect\non their perceived effort and to gauge their overall perfor-\nmance of the task at hand. Therefore, the articles presented\nbelow do not involve the concept of reflection as self-evalu-\nation, but rather reflection as a tool for improved metacogni-\ntive practices to effectively enhance overall academic\nmotivation and performance. The following review of litera-\nture will guide the reader through (a) the history and ratio-\nnale for integration of reflective thinking, (b) definitions and\nconcepts of student self-reflection as they relate to education,\n(c) the potential benefits of integrating reflective activities\ninto the classroom, (d) specific studies that support these\nbenefits, and (e) the implications for teachers to create action\nto make reflection a part of their day-to-day classroom rou-\ntines. Therefore, to provide a holistic rationale and review,\nliterature has been included from the educational, profes-\nsional, and international arenas. For purposes of this study, as\nwell as the context for this review of literature, the definition\nof reflection provided by Webb and Scoular (2011) will be\nutilized:\nReflective learners\n1. [I]dentify . . . opportunities and achievements\n2. [S]et goals with steps to achieve them\n3. Review progress, act . . . on outcomes[,] [and] . . .\ncheck how things are going and take action\n4. Ask for feedback and advice; respond positively to\nfeedback and advice\n5. Evaluate experiences and learning to inform future\nprogress\n6. Communicate about their learning\nThe History and Rationale for Integration of\nReflective Thinking\nThe foundations of reflection as a tool for learning began not\nwithin the walls of a primary or secondary classroom, but\noutside of the realm of education altogether. For example,\nMountford and Rogers (1996) conducted research on the use\nof individual and group reflection as a tool for effective\nlearning for nurses and claim,\nformal reflection was seen as a learning strategy to influence\npositively students' educational outcomes and professional\npractice via six key factors[:] . . . academic self concept, . . . task\nawareness . . . views of knowledge, . . . the influence of\nknowledge on behavior, . . . writing as a learning activity, and . .\n. generating knowledge by reflecting in and on assessment with\nWhile this study focused on a field outside of education, the\nidea of academic self-concept and task awareness are of par-\nticular interest to education. The study relays that \"when\nsomeone's self-concept matches what they really think, feel\nand do, they are able to realize their full potential\" (Rogers in\ntask analysis, the researchers point to Dewey (1933) who\nasserted,\nbeing responsible and taking control of one's own education and\npractice as essential attributes for success. Task awareness is just\nas much a part of education as it is a part of practice. Students\nwho are active in constructing meaning from their educational\ntasks . . . are more successful, especially in the long term.\nGiven this close connection to the idea of reflection in educa-\ntion, it is no surprise that later research focused on the idea of\nteacher preparation programs working to develop more\nreflective educators.\nThe Journal of Teacher Education (Yost et al., 2000)\nrefers back to Dewey, who felt the most important quality of\na teacher was critical reflection. The authors relay that\na reflective/analytic teacher is one who makes teaching decisions\non the basis of conscious awareness and careful consideration of\nthe assumptions on which the decision are based[.]. . . The end\nresult of critical reflection for the individual is cognitive change.\nThis focus on the importance of reflection for the educator is\nwhat spurned so many colleges of education, perhaps includ-\ning our own, to infuse high levels of reflective thinking and\npractice within the pedagogy of the teachers that they are\ntraining. Yost et al. (2000) wrote, \"we believe that teacher\neducation programs must designate critical reflection as a\nprimary mission and interweave reflection throughout the\nteacher education curriculum\" (p. 41). Consequently, it is\nlogical to assert that the more reflective the teacher, the more\nteachers will imbue reflective thinking within the curriculum\nfor their students, which is a primary focus of my own study.\nDespite the focus on developing a reflective teacher and the\nlack of research on student-centered reflection, one area of\nfocus that prior research felt would benefit from infusion of\nreflection was the area of service learning.\nOgden and Claus (1997) discussed the \"burgeoning ser-\nvice learning movement\" of the 1990s and relay the impor-\ntance of reflection among student participants to avert\nrelegating service learning projects to a mere \"superficial\naddition\" to the school curriculum (p. 72). The authors relay,\nthe experiential education and service learning literature makes\nclear that reflection is the central way in which we process\nexperience into learning. Reflection contributes to understanding\nand generalization, and it becomes the cornerstone to developing\na more thoughtful and intentional pursuit of future action.\nThis concept of processing experience into meaningful learn-\ning and understanding is not isolated to service learning; in\nfact, it is the basic tenet for why reflection ultimately devel-\noped into a core principle for preservice teachers as well as\ndeemed beneficial for students across all subjects of the cur-\nriculum. Therefore, before we are able to examine the pro-\nspective benefits of the induction of reflective thinking into\nthe curriculum, or delve into actual studies surrounding this\ntopic, it is essential to canvass the rationale for its develop-\nment and integration in the first place.\nDefinitions and Concepts of Student Self-\nReflection as They Relate to Education\nYancey (1998) relayed that many teachers see reflection\nactivities as student self-evaluation and that many students\nare reticent to participate in self-assessment because they\n\"see that kind of judgment as belonging to the teacher\" (p.\n13). However, the same study is clear to assert that to transi-\ntion students from external to intrinsic motivation to suc-\nceed, reflection must be integrated and embraced within the\nclassroom. Therefore, while reflection does not need to take\nthe place of a teacher's assessment, it can be infused as part\nof an activity to enhance student performance because, if stu-\ndents are \"makers of meaning,\" their own thoughts and inter-\npretation of their work and its overall impact \"have to be part\nof the mix\" (Yancey, 1998, p. 17). All in all, the most com-\npelling issue related to prior research in the use of reflective\n4 SAGE Open\nthinking is its inherent power to enhance outcomes--particu-\nlarly in combination or support of metacognition and/or criti-\ncal thinking (Ford & Yore, 2012). From professional fields\noutside of education, to teachers, to students, the power of\nreflection is evident; however, its integration into the curric-\nulum must be intentional and well planned to have maximum\neffect.\nThis mirrors the position taken by Kritt (1993) who\nrelayed, \"by about fifth grade children begin to have meta-\ncognitive ability sufficient to realize when they are not\nunderstanding something. . . . [T]hey could use this knowl-\nedge to monitor their own behavior\" (p. 44). This connection\nto learning theory and affective development is crucial and\nimplies that reflection could be an appropriate self-monitor-\ning tool in both primary and secondary grades. This infusion\nof self-discipline and ability to think about the approach used\nto complete an academic task is critical to achievement and\ndeveloping a concept of oneself as a thinking person requires\nopportunities to engage the range of one's abilities and guidance\nin recognizing one's strengths and weaknesses, as well as\nassistance in figuring out how to play to one's strengths and\nminimize weaknesses. (p. 45)\nHowever, the rationale for development and direct instruc-\ntion of reflective practices is not limited in scope to just the\nUnited States.\nRussian educational theorists have developed a method\nfor direct instruction of reflection, dubbed Learning Activity,\nfor elementary school students. As discussed by Zuckerman\n(2004), \"when the elementary school curriculum does not\nfoster reflective development, other habits of intellectual\nwork will be cultivated that later limit students motivation\nfor and access to self-learning\" (p. 10). Given this tenet, the\nauthor presents the Russian viewpoint of reflection, which\nmirrors what many professional educators may already be\ndoing in their classroom, albeit implicitly. Zuckerman (2004)\nrelayed that concepts such as considering the goals and\nmeans of one's own actions and thoughts as well as the will-\ningness and consideration to take on the views of others are\ncritical to effective educational growth and learning, going\nas far as to say that direct instruction of reflective thinking\ncan stretch students'zone of proximal development as postu-\nlated by Vygotsky. This is a pivotal idea considering that, the\nwider a student's zone of proximal development, the greater\nthe amount of learning that can take place independently\nonce it has been properly scaffolded by the teacher.\nAsimilar consensus was determined by English and Swedish\nresearchers who concluded that student reflection served to\nenhance \"learning as understanding `reality'\" and ultimately\nresulting in students' abilities to \"see learning as personally\nmeaningful . . . [and] describe . . . transformation[s] in percep-\ntions of the world before and after learning\" (Bednar & Eglin,\nRussian study and discusses the concept of secondary and post-\nsecondary students using reflection to develop double-loop\nlearning. In this framework, students who have mastered reflec-\ntive thinking practices move from \"`passing the unit,'to create a\nmore productive learning spiral in which they gain transferable\nlearning skills\" (Bednar & Eglin, 2007, p. 53). These interna-\ntional comparisons serve to illustrate the cross-cultural and\nhumanitarian basis for the benefits of reflection activities in\nboth primary and secondary settings.\nThe Potential Benefits of Integrating Reflective\nActivities Into the Classroom\ncritical self-reflection not only improves students' critical\nthinking skills but also helps students develop self-knowledge. .\n. . [It] compels students to interrogate their beliefs and\nperspectives on reality by acknowledging how they influence,\nand are influenced by, their social realities. (pp. 339-340)\nThis sheds light not only on the power of reflection as an\nacademic learning tool, but on the transformative power of\nits ability to fundamentally change the way students think\nand perceive their effort, motivation, and ability to complete\nnovel and familiar tasks. In addition to supporting students'\nabilities to think about their thinking, the basic principle of\nmetacognition, reflection also allows students affective out-\nlets that can reduce stress and frustration toward the curricu-\nlum. As discussed by Rusche and Jason (2011), \"giving\nstudents an opportunity to `write it out'not only can alleviate\nsome frustration but can significantly deepen their grasp on\nthe material, even when they do not like it or agree with it\"\npositive outlook with regard to the power and importance of\nmetacognitive thinking as developed by reflection; they\nrelay, \"lifelong learning takes place through reflection. That\nis, learning begins with metacognition, knowing one's own\nthoughts and reflection, which allows the individual to iden-\ntify factors that influence one's own thinking\" (p. 1). As\nteachers, we are often tasked with designing or delivering a\nmere section of the overall curriculum--a grade in primary\nschool or simply a year of a single subject in secondary\nschool. However, the underlying hope is that our impact\nspans well beyond the 180 days that students spend in our\ncharge. Rather, if students are truly supported through effec-\ntive instruction as well as empowered for the development of\nenhanced affective and metacognitive growth, the effect is\nmuch longer lasting--perhaps for a student's entire lifetime\n(McCormick et al., 2013). As evidenced in the literature,\nthere is a clear rationale for the integration of reflection in the\nclassroom, with Colley et al. (2012) calling it a \"key peda-\ngogical strategy . . . [that] develop[s] a realistic sense of effi-\ncacy and motivation\" (pp. 12-13); however, it is also integral\nto examine the specific benefits of its implementation.\nStudent reflection was identified as one of the top six\nactivities to promote student achievement in Maurice Elias's\n(2010) article titled, \"School Climate That Promotes Student\nVoice.\" In his article, the author attests that \"students should\nhave chances to set some of their own goals, monitor their\nown progress, have choices in how they show evidence of\nwhat they've learned, and share their learning with others\"\n(Elias, 2010, p. 24). This approach seems effective because it\nhelps to create a culture of intrinsic motivation to succeed as\nwell as promotes students' approaches to completing assign-\nments for the sake of growth and learning rather than simply\nto receive a grade. By encouraging students to express their\nthoughts and ideas about their performance on academic\ntasks, we are not only allowing them to analyze their own\nlearning, but are teaching them a skill that reaches far beyond\nthe classroom and into the rest of their adult lives in both\nprofessional and social interactions. As summarized by the\nauthor of this study, \"lasting learning is the results of acts of\nco-creation in caring contexts, and that is what the pedagogy\nA comparable framework was examined by Harford\n(2008) who passionately relayed, \"routine reflection exer-\ncises can result in the most exciting and rewarding moments\nin the classroom . . . [because] reflection reinforces the stu-\ndents' sense of competence and accomplishment while\nsimultaneously helping them recognize their areas of weak-\nness\" (pp. 61-62). Again, this sentiment is imperative when\ndiscussing the potential impact of reflection as a tool to sup-\nport student growth because learning is more than memoriz-\ning content or moving through the curriculum--It is about\nhelping students to develop the confidence to attempt con-\ncepts that may be foreign to them, to persevere in the face of\nadversity, and to use failure or impasse to deepen the desire\nto find new approaches to solving problems. When these\ncomponents are infused with the content of the curriculum,\nwe are no longer moving through learning, we are experienc-\ning intellectual and emotional evolution. In her closing,\nHarford attests, \"engaging in an authentic process of reflec-\ntion . . . is one of the best ways to ensure buy-in from stu-\ndents across the academic spectrum\" (p. 65). This concept of\nbuy-in is critical, especially in today's assessment-driven\nculture where students may feel the effects of an unintention-\nally fractured curriculum or propensity to learn simply for\nthe sake of passing state-mandated tests. Consequently, once\nthe culture of reflection is successfully integrated into the\nclassroom or school setting, its effects have shown to be\npotent--even in an assessment-driven educational culture.\nPrior Studies That Support the Benefits of\nReflection\nAsh et al. (2005) discussed how reflective activities must be\nintentionally linked to assessment, which is the approach\nused in my study. To receive a summative evaluation of their\nwork, my students will have completed and attached a reflec-\ntion activity to their assignment. Ash et al. (2005) relayed\nthat reflection activities have the potential to improve stu-\ndents' overall academic performance as well as allow teach-\ners to \"evaluate the quality of thinking\" demonstrated by\nindividual students by \"gaining access to their internal\nthought processes about the activities\" (p. 49). This is an\nimportant component to consider because it implies the pos-\nsibility for teachers to unravel the disparity between students'\nperceived and actual ability levels through execution of\nreflective interventions. Phan (2008) shared a similar out-\nlook on the value of reflection, but notes that very few stud-\nies have looked at its actual impact in the classroom setting;\nher research tested a structural model that included looking\nat the classroom environment, achievement goals, and reflec-\ntive thinking practices. In this study, it was determined that\nthe overall ability of reflective thinking in relation to student\nachievement relies heavily on the actual classroom environ-\nAlthough the overall number of studies that analyze and\nreport findings on the connection between reflection and aca-\ndemic achievement or motivation are limited, there are a few\nthat are noteworthy.\nA review from the Journal of Advanced Academics sup-\nports the specific rationale for my study and focuses on the\nperformance of secondary students in an urban setting, which\naligns very well with the situation presented in my research.\nThe authors state,\n[i]mpacting the academic performance of high school students .\n. . is important because of the high-stakes nature . . . relative to\ntheir vocational and post-secondary pursuits. . . . Getting\nstudents to become more active, strategic participants in their\nlearning . . . is an important pathway to academic success.\nThe authors relay that there is no single intervention that can\nrectify the poor academic performance seen among today's\nurban, high school students; however, students in their study\ndid show marked improvement on academic tasks after\nexposure to a well-structured intervention program involving\nstudent reflection. This is promising and posits that future\nresearch studies, such as the one presented herein, will allow\nfor greater generalization of findings for urban or high school\nstudents in general. Lew and Schmidt (2011) concluded that\nstudent reflection through the use of journals resulted in stu-\ndents examining both the process and content of their learn-\ning and showed a weak to moderate correlation with\nimproved academic performance. Their findings suggest that\nstudents' ability to accurately reflect on their work improves\nover time, but does not significantly affect their overall per-\nformance on work in the classroom (Lew & Schmidt, 2011,\np. 540). In addition, the authors relay that, in their experi-\nence, self-reflection skills are not easily taught and that the\nquestion of whether or not effective student reflection affects\n6 SAGE Open\noverall performance either positively or negatively is still up\nfor debate. However, rather than abandon the concept of\nreflection as a tool for enhanced student performance, the\nauthors of this study suggest that further research is needed\nas well as point out that student reflection may improve stu-\ndent learning in ways that are not measureable by academic\nwhile these studies clearly indicate the power of reflection as\na tool for enhanced academic performance, further studies\nshow the relevance for improved metacognition and\nenhanced motivation to succeed academically by allowing\nstudents to recognize and ponder areas of excellence as well\nas needed improvement (McCormick et al., 2013; Sperling\nDesautel (2009) conducted a study on the effects of reflec-\ntion in an urban elementary school, very similar to the eth-\nnography of my study, and concluded, \"self-reflection serves\nthe goal of constructing metacognitive knowledge by mak-\ning formerly unconscious, intangible, or reflexive processes\nor events explicit\" (p. 2001). This concept is integral and\npoints out not only the power of reflection but also the need\nfor its meaningful integration into the curriculum. In the cur-\nrent age of assessment-driven culture, many students are\nforced full of facts, strategies, and procedures, but are often\nnot allowed time for this content to percolate or culminate\ninto synthesis of how to transfer it into other arenas.\nTherefore, while requiring specific planning and execution\ntime, reflection can help students transfer knowledge and\nunderstanding from the subconscious to the conscious part of\ntheir psyches. This approach is also supported by Webb and\nScoular (2011) whose study revealed, \"reflection time help-\nful for recapping . . . lesson[s] and reinforcing learning. It\nhelped [students] realize what they were doing wrong and\nwhat they needed to improve\" (p. 479). These studies convey\nthe power of student self-reflection as a learning activity in\nrelation to improved academic performance, motivation, and\nmetacognitive thinking, which mirrors the rationale for this\nstudy.\nImplications for Teachers\nIn her article \"Practicing the Virtue of Reflection in an\nUnfamiliar Context,\" Birmingham (2003) discussed the\nmodel of reflection known as phronesis. In this theory, first\ndescribed by Aristotle in his work Nicomachean Ethics,\nreflection is not something a teacher does, not a form of\nknowledge or a thought process, not a rule or a principle, but a\nmoral way of being. The first implication of this model is that\nreflection is more than relevant to moral issues; reflection is\nThe study continues to describe the definition of phronesis as\n\"practical wisdom\" and \"the virtue of thought that permits\ncorrect reasoning in decisions that involve virtues of\nAristotle's concept of phronesis back to Dewey, Birmingham\n(2003) relayed the three virtues of character, or attitudes that\nhe considered essential for reflection: wholeheartedness,\nopen-mindedness, and responsibility (p. 192). The idea of\nreflection as a tool for morality and ethics supports a study\nconducted by Sunstein (1998) who implemented reflection\nas a way to prelude students'propensity for plagiarism in her\nclassroom. After asking students to reflect on their actions\nand intentions for assignments, the value and importance of\nreflection as a tool in the classroom became clear; however,\nthe author points out that use of reflection must be inten-\ntional and meaningful. She writes,\n[v]apidreflectionseems,atbest,anexerciseinself-indulgence[.].\n. . Careful, detailed reflection upon one's own learning, however,\nis not among the \"basic skills\" taught in schools[,]. . . [b]ut it is\n[how] . . . students take stock of learning represented in a given\ncollection of work at a given moment in time. (Sunstein, 1998,\nThis call for meaningful reflection is important and relays\nthat reflective activities must be infused within the curricu-\nlum rather than seen as a mandatory add-on or mundane\nrequirement.\nWhile this may take extra planning to incorporate into the\ncurriculum, the benefits are paramount because when stu-\ndents and teachers analyze outcomes and assessments with\nrigorous questions that demand reflection and reflexivity,\neveryone involved has the potential to see the true meaning\nof the assignment at hand (Sunstein, 1998). However, while\nreflective thinking has become an integral part of both the\nteacher and his or her student, it is important to delineate the\nconcept of reflection as support for performance and motiva-\ntion versus being used as an actual self-assessment.\nDuijnhouwer, Prins, and Stokking (2012) provided a concise\ndefinition of reflection as it relates to this study: \"a process\nthat starts with the identification of a problem and the deci-\nsion to seek a solution\" (p. 172). Ge and Land in Duijnhouwer\net al. (2012) relayed that \"instruction that provides students\nwith questions to ask themselves during problem-solving has\nbeen shown to enhance performance\" (p. 173).\nAlthough existing research on this topic is limited, there\ndoes appear to be a positive correlation with student self-\nreflection and academic performance and motivation. For\nexample, Duijnhouwer et al. (2012) mirrored the anticipated\noutcome of this study. By asking students to reflect on their\nassignments to personally explore their true intentions and\ninsight toward their perceived efforts and cognitive growth,\nrather than as a manner of simply providing a quantitative\ngrade or summative evaluation on their own work, it is my\nintention to enhance their performance not only academically\nbut affectively as well--thus translating into a correlation not\nonly between reflection and performance but also between\nreflection and mere motivation to attempt completion of\nassignments. Nascent research also asserts that the lines\nbetween critical thinking, metacognition, and reflection\nshould be blurred in an effort to promote cohesion and inter-\ndependence among these core, yet historically separated con-\nstructs, in the classroom (Ford & Yore, 2012).\nMethod\nSite and Participants\nThe setting for this study is a small high school that was\nestablished 9 years ago and operates in the heart of down-\ntown Orlando as a public, Orange County charter school.\nThe school serves only students in the 11th and 12th grades\nand provides teaching in all core content areas as well as in\nphysical education and business. Of the 242 students who\nattend the school, 54% are African American, 26% are\nHispanic, 18% are Caucasian, and 2% are Asian. The gender\nbalance is fairly equal, with 51% of the student body being\nfemale and 49% male; the institution is a Title One school\nand nearly all the student population comes from working\npoverty families or underserved communities. The overall\nschool demographics also represent the demographics of the\nparticipants of this study due to the fact that, as the sole\nEnglish teacher at the school, I serve and support more than\n95% of the student body in either English III or English IV;\nthe only students who are not in one of my 10 class periods\nare those who have already completed their English class\ncredits at a previous school. Consequently, this research will\nreach nearly the entire student body and will provide insight\nbased on the broad range of students served at this institution\nof learning. Although not an alternative school, the student\nbody presents various challenges that must be overcome by\nthe staff to assist students with graduation, foremost among\nthem academic achievement; the average grade point aver-\nage (GPA) of students at this school is 1.30. This results in\nteachers providing a significant focus on the remediation of\ncore skills in reading and math as well as constant socioemo-\ntional support to help students gain greater levels of motiva-\ntion and commitment to their learning and growth. It is the\ncommitment to this goal that served as the impetus for this\naction research project, although the context of the site and\nits participants present the following limitations: (a) a rela-\ntively small sample size, (b) research and focus in a single\nsubject across only two grade levels, and (c) the integration\nof a single, self-created student reflection instrument as a\ntool for the intervention.\nMaterials and Conceptual Framework\nof the reflection instrument that was used as an intervention\ntool (see the appendix) and concluded about 8 weeks later on\nMarch 22, 2013, when the final data were collected for anal-\nysis. The disconnection between the students' actual and\nperceived abilities, as well as the disparity between their\nmotivation to complete assignments or exert their maximum\neffort on academic tasks, prompted the development of this\nresearch instrument because, to answer the research ques-\ntion, it had to be ensured not only that the researcher would\nbe able to effectively integrate a structured, reflective activ-\nity into the classroom routine but also to establish if there\nwas a correlation between its implementation and students'\nacademic performance and motivation to complete their\nassignments in class. The reflection instrument developed\nwas the only material outside of regular classroom curricu-\nlum--such as books and project supplies--that was utilized\nfor intervention with the study participants.\nThe main issues that needed to be addressed in this study\nwere how to enhance the students' overall level of personal\nempowerment in their abilities as well as to facilitate their\nability to think about their efforts from both an academic and\naffective standpoint. This issue aligned well with the concept\nof self-reflection; however, as discussed in the review of lit-\nerature, this notion is multifaceted. Therefore, to define the\nconceptual framework for this action research project, it was\ndecided to hone in on the practice of reflection as a method\nfor improved cognition to support students'overall academic\ngrowth and intrinsic motivation to complete their tasks.\nDesautel (2009) relayed that reflection had a strong connec-\ntion with metacognition, which is a person's ability to think\nabout his or her own thinking. This enhanced level of self-\nunderstanding and direction indicated the potential power to\nlead toward improved intrinsic motivation, not only to com-\nplete assignments and tasks but to also execute them to one's\nfullest potential--thus resulting in improved academic per-\nformance, as detailed by Ash et al. (2005), Lew and Schmidt\nand--as specifically examined for underserved high school\npopulations such as the context for this study--Cleary et al.\nConsequently, the reflection tool that was created was\nspecifically aimed at supporting the conceptual framework\nof this study by stimulating students' metacognition through\nstructured and meaningful reflective prompts about their\nwork, thus resulting in the potential for improved academic\nperformance on future assignments as well as increased\nmotivation to complete their tasks effectively. These aspects\nof academic performance and motivation, the dependent\nvariables, are the components of the research question that\nwill be measured and analyzed qualitatively and quantita-\ntively both before and after the introduction of the indepen-\ndent variable, the reflection instrument.\nProcedure\nPrior to the introduction of the intervention instrument, stu-\ndents had not reflected on their work in any formal capacity;\ntherefore, introduction of this task was novel for the partici-\npants of the study. As a result, the researcher opted for a\n8 SAGE Open\nwritten reflection, as opposed to a verbal reflection, to allow\nstudents sufficient time to process their thoughts and provide\nmeaningful insight into the various prompts given within the\nreflective activity. Most assignments given in the classroom\ncontext are completed in the actual classroom; therefore, the\ncompletion of the reflection assignment took place in class\nfor the vast majority of the students. The intervention used in\nthis study was focused on each of the students in 10 class\nperiod sections, five of which were English III and five of\nwhich were English IV; students received the instrument\nwithin the context of their 75-min class as part of their\nassignment requirements. The intervention mechanism was a\nstructured reflection assignment that students were required\nto complete and attach to each of their written English assign-\nments and was introduced and explained prior to its manda-\ntory integration over the course of 12 possible assignments\nduring the treatment period. After assignments were col-\nlected for grading, the reflection instruments were personally\nremoved and stored for qualitative analysis and evaluation\nafter the close of the data collection period.\nTo strengthen and add potential credence to the qualita-\ntive data collected from the students' reflection instruments,\ndata were also collected from a quantitative standpoint to\nassist with determining if a correlation existed between stu-\ndent self-reflection and academic performance, student moti-\nvation to complete assignments, or both. For baseline data\ncomparison, student data were collected from the second\nmarking period of the academic school year, which ran from\ndiscussion or implementation of structured reflective activi-\nties in class. The specific data collected for the purpose of\nfuture comparison were the total number of missing assign-\nments per student for the academic marking period as well as\neach of his or her summative report card grades, which rep-\nresented the total average of all combined assignments on an\ninterval scale ranging from a possible 0% to 100%.\nThis same exact procedure was conducted at the conclu-\nsion of the data collection period so that each student's over-\nall number of missing assignments as well as his or her\noverall academic performance could be compared with how\nit was prior to the introduction of the reflection instrument.\nOnce the quantitative data were retrieved from the school's\napproved grade-keeping software program, ProgressBook, it\nwas entered into Microsoft Excel for data analysis. Each stu-\ndent who was enrolled in any class sections for both the sec-\nschool year comprised one row of data that consisted of his\nor her name, his or her total number of missing assignments\nfor the second marking period, his or her grade for the sec-\nond marking period, his or her total number of missing\nassignments for the third marking period, and his or her final\ngrade for the third marking period; students who were with-\ndrawn during the data collection period or who were not\nenrolled for either the full period of the baseline or interven-\ntion periods were removed from the data collection.\nAlthough I was present to guide students in how to com-\nplete their reflections if needed, it was entirely up to them to\ndetermine how to best answer the questions and prompts that\nwere presented to them on the intervention tool. Students\nwere asked to complete their reflections individually and\nwere told that their responses would not affect their assess-\nments in any way, thus promoting honesty and transparency\nin the activity--anonymous submissions were also accepted\nfor students who were concerned that their reflections were\ntoo personal or abrasive in nature. The supposition is that\nstudent academic performance on assignments will increase\nand that the overall number of missing assignments from stu-\ndents will decrease while the treatment is in place. In addi-\ntion, it is also the conviction that the possible correlation\nbetween the independent and dependent variables could shed\nlight onto the potential power of reflection in the classroom\nand could serve as the basis of its integration for teachers of\nother subject areas at this school as well as for schools in\nother underserved communities.\nData Analysis\nThe results of the quantitative research indicated that there\nwas a statistically insignificant correlation between student\nself-reflection and academic performance and motivation to\ncomplete assignments for underserved students in 11th- and\n12th-grade English; however, analysis of the qualitative data\nindicated that students' levels of metacognition and reaction\nto the intervention were largely positive. Therefore, while\nthe hypothesis to the research question was not proved\nthrough the quantitative data, the qualitative analysis pro-\nvided a multitude of facts and considerations as presented\nbelow.\nQuantitative Analysis\nThe summative academic marking period grades for all par-\ntive activity intervention and M = 73.47 after its\nimplementation. In addition to determining means, Pearson\ncorrelations were run between the two sets of report card\ngrades as well as the number of missing assignments for the\nsecond and third marking periods. A paired-sample t test was\nalso used to determine a possible statistical difference in stu-\ndent grades after the treatment. There was a moderate to\nstrong correlation between the two sets of student grades, r =\n.638, n = 146; the paired-sample t test indicated that the sta-\ntistical difference between the two sets of summative grades\nWith regard to the total number of missing assignments for\nthe marking periods, the overall number missing from the\n2.27, n = 146) for the intervention period, which brought the\noverall percentage of missing assignments to 18.67% for the\ncollection period prior to the reflective activity and 18.89%\nafter its integration. There was a moderate to strong correla-\ntion between the number of missing assignments from before\nand after the treatment, r = .647, n = 146. The mean results\nfor both academic performance and overall number of miss-\ning assignments for each individual class section are sum-\nmarized in Table 1:\nQualitative Analysis\nFrom the reflection instrument, student response data were\ngrouped based on (a) academic performance indicators, (b)\nacademic motivation indicators, and (c) affective motivation\nindicators. The strongest indicator was for affective motiva-\ntion, including reflection resulting in metacognition, with\n84.3% of participants responding either favorably or show-\ning an indication of improved affective motivation or self-\nefficacy for future motivation. This was followed by 74.8%\nof students responding favorably to a commitment to future\nacademic motivation and 67.3% of students providing feed-\nback and insight that related favorable to improved academic\nperformance. A summary and analysis of specific detail for\neach of the indicators are presented below.\n1. Academic Performance: For this indicator,\nQuestions 1 and 3 from the reflection instrument\nwere used to determine a positive or negative influ-\nence on students' academic performance based on\ntheir responses to the question prompts. Overall,\n67.3% of respondents indicated a positive change in\nacademic performance and relayed comments such\nas the following:\nIhatewriting,butthisactivitymademerealizethatbrainstorming\nto describe a topic makes the task easier for me.\nAt first I thought this assignment was boring, but now I can\nrelate to it and find this concept more interesting.\nThe end result of my assignment doesn't live up to my personal\nexpectations, so I will have to work harder on the next one.\nI didn't like poetry before, but after reading the poems in class\nand finding that they aren't hard to understand, I like them\nbetter.\nI discovered that poetry is like a puzzle with universal themes\nthat can be easily mistaken.\nThis assignment has made me work harder to try and succeed\nand get a better grade.\nThis activity changed the way I comprehend. Now, I don't just\nread the story and tell what it means, I also tell about its other\nelements and structures and infer more.\nIn the future, I will elaborate more and use support from the text\nin my responses to get a better grade.\nI have learned that success requires me to look beyond what is\npresented.\nThe remaining 32.7% of responses were either left blank\nor indicated a negative change or attitude toward aca-\ndemic performance, including comments such as the\nfollowing:\nThis activity did not change my thinking at all.\nI hated poetry before this assignment and still hate it.\nMy way of thinking about this topic has not changed.\nI only completed this assignment for a grade.\n2. Academic Motivation: For this indicator, Questions 2\nand 5 from the reflection instrument were used to\ndetermine a positive or negative influence on stu-\ndents' academic motivation to complete assignments\nbased on their responses to the question prompts. In\ntotal, 74.8% of respondents indicated a positive\nchange in current or future academic motivation and\nrelayed comments such as the following:\nTable 1. Quantitative Results of Changes in Student Grades and Missing Assignments After Implementation of Self Reflection\nInstrument.\nSection Baseline grade (M) Post grade (M) Baseline missing (M) Post missing (M)\nI did truly do everything I could to succeed, but I need to work\non my time management.\nOn future assignments, I will try harder and turn it in on time.\nIf I were to revisit this assignment, I would do more research and\nlook up better vocabulary words.\nI need to organize my time better to make sure I succeed.\nI would try harder and ask for more help instead of attempting to\nunderstand it on my own.\nI would change my work ethic completely and try much harder.\nI would not miss the class that was given to go over this\nassignment so I would not be rushing through this to get the rest\nof my work done.\nI would turn it in on time and not procrastinate as much.\nI took advantage of all the time given to me and I worked\nproficiently and tried my best.\nThe remaining 25.2% of responses were either left blank or\nindicated a negative change or attitude toward academic\nmotivation and self-efficacy to complete assignments,\nincluding feedback such as the following:\nI would do nothing differently.\nI never try my best on assignments in class.\nIt's okay. I could have done better, but choose not to.\nNo, I did not.\nI rushed just to get the job done.\nI procrastinated and didn't even finish.\n3. Affective Motivation: For this indicator, Questions 4\nand 6 from the reflection instrument were used to\ndetermine a positive or negative influence on stu-\ndents'affective motivation and self-efficacy based on\ntheir responses to the question prompts. All in all,\n84.3% of respondents indicated a positive change in\neither affective motivation or improved self-efficacy\nand shared comments including the following:\nI now know that this work is not as hard as it seems, so next time\nI won't overthink it and will just do it more calmly.\nThis task made me think about what else I need to learn in school\nand life.\nI am excited to learn more; I never knew how creative I could be!\nI feel more motivated and confident in my abilities to work on\nthis topic in the future.\nPoetry has boosted my emotions and made me think outside of\nthe box.\nI feel I have the potential to influence my classmates because\nthey looked to me for help on this assignment; I now enjoy\nhelping other people more.\nI have learned that there is more than my own perspective in the\nmeaning of things.\nThe passion I put into my responses would influence others\nbecause it's organic and I feel that my realness is that others\nexpect and enjoy from me.\nI now look at the work and the information in it much differently\nto learn how it affects me and my life.\nI am actually excited to read and learn new words now.\nPoems and I are now on friendly terms. Not the best, but not the\nworst like before.\nI hope to inspire others to try their best and turn their work in on\ntime, like me.\nThe remaining 15.7% of responses were either left blank or\nindicated a negative change or attitude toward affective\ngrowth, intrinsic motivation, or self-efficacy, including\nresponses such as the following:\nI don't have the ability to influence others.\nI don't want to learn more about anything.\nNobody would listen to me or believe me anyway.\nNothing has changed and I still feel the same way.\nNo because I still have too much to learn to be able to influence\nother people.\nNo because other people would have done better on this\nassignment anyway.\nDiscussion\nFrom a quantitative standpoint, the results showed that\nreflection as a tool for enhanced metacognition, thus translat-\ning to improved academic performance or motivation to\ncomplete assignments, had minimal to no overall effect.\nAlthough the correlation between the sets of grades and\nmissing assignments was moderate to strong, the null hypoth-\nesis for this study was that there would be no correlation\nbetween baseline and postintervention results because a\nsignificant growth in academic performance or a tremendous\nchange in the overall number of student missing assignments\nwould result in a weak to negligible correlation. Therefore,\nthe strength of the correlation for the overall groups of par-\nticipants supported the results of the statistical means of the\nparticipants in both areas, both of which actually declined\nvery slightly from the baseline to the postintervention period.\nDespite this overall scope of a lack of quantitative impact,\nthere were four sections that showed improved performance.\nSections 6, 8, and 10 all showed improvement in both aca-\ndemic performance as well as decline in the mean number of\nmissing assignments while Group 3 showed improved aca-\ndemic performance despite an actual increase in the overall\npercentage of missing assignments. As a result of the inter-\npretation of the quantitative data, the hypothesis was not\nproved: There was little to no correlation between student\nreflection and improved academic performance and motiva-\ntion to complete assignments for underserved students in\n11th- and 12th-grade English. However, despite this lack of\nquantitative proof, the qualitative proof yielded more posi-\ntive results.\nWith regard to academic performance, more than two\nthirds of participants conveyed partial to significant insight\ntoward enhanced academic performance. A majority of stu-\ndents relayed exerting extra effort to achieve the maximum\ngrade possible as well as conveyed changing the way they\nthought about the concepts taught after completion of les-\nsons. While this growth may not have been evident in the\noverall means of student grades, it was quite clear in their\nresponses on the reflection instrument. In addition, when\nparing the data down to the individual student level, there\nwere some striking instances of growth, with a small portion\nof students improving more than 40% from their perfor-\nmance in the baseline period to the length of time that\nincluded the reflective activity. Moreover, nearly three\nfourths of students detailed specific examples and connec-\ntions to improved academic motivation. Comments, as\nshown in the aforementioned qualitative analysis, regarding\nthe tendency to procrastinate, to rush through work, to give\nminimal effort, as well as insights that shed light on a portion\nof students who were clearly empowered and gave their\nmaximum effort to complete assignments efficiently and on\ntime were significant.\nThis level and depth of thought, as well as the level of\ntransparency and willingness to voice the truth of the situa-\ntion with regard to motivation and effort, clearly relayed that\nthe reflective activity caused students to think about their\napproach, motivation, and efforts with regard to completion\nof their tasks. Again, while this trend did not specifically\ntranslate to the overall mean or percentage of missing assign-\nments decreasing for the entire group of participants, it\nclearly indicated the potential for improvement and explained\nwhy several students grew from missing nearly all assign-\nments for the second marking period to missing only one or\nno assignments for the third marking period. Finally, the vast\nmajority of participants, more than 84%, presented indica-\ntors for positive affective growth with regard to motivation\nand/or self-efficacy on the reflection instrument, which is a\nsignificant level of positive evidence for improved metacog-\nnition as it relates to the potential for improved performance\nand motivation in the future. Again, while this remarkable\nlevel of positive indication did not translate into quantitative\nimprovement, it does show that the reflection instrument\neither assisted with students' growth in the area of improved\nmetacognition or at least provided them with an outlet for\nmetacognitive thought that would not have necessarily been\navailable to them without the reflection instrument. While\nthese qualitative measures do not inherently prove the\nhypothesis for this study, they do allow for educational stake-\nholders to reflect on their possible implications as well as the\ndiscrepancy between the expectations and outcomes of this\naction research project.\nImplications\nBased on the observations of students made by the instructor\nduring this study, a paramount implication is that the power\nof student self-reflection, as well as the seemingly positive\nfeedback that may come with it, does not inherently translate\ninto quantitative academic success or improvement for all\nstudents or the participant group as a whole. This tenet is\nsupported not only by the personal observations made during\nthis study but also by the qualitative results of the reflective\ninstrument. Clearly, enhanced metacognition took place on\nboth an intellectual and affective level, as shown by the\nmajority of participants who responded positively to the\naforementioned indicators; however, these results did not\ntranslate into improved academic performance or motivation\non a larger or more significant scale as hypothesized in the\nresearch question. Therefore, while this action research has\nskimmed the surface for the power of reflection in the class-\nroom, as well as provided a sound and firm foundation of\nprior research and conceptual framework, there appears to be\nadditional elements required, such as additional time for\ninfusion of the intervention or improved instruction and\nimplementation of the reflective activity itself, to unleash the\nfull potential power of reflection as a tool for enhanced\nmetacognition.\nFurthermore, it is evident that the overall number of stu-\ndents' missing assignments directly link to their academic\nperformance--a fact that any seasoned teacher can easily\ninfer. As shown in the quantitative analysis, three of the four\nsections that showed mild improvement in academic perfor-\nmance all indicated an overall reduction in the amount of\nmissing work. Therefore, the power of reflection as a tool for\nenhanced metacognition in the short term may be best uti-\nlized initially simply to motivate underperforming students\nto complete their tasks to avert bringing down their summa-\ntive grades merely from a refusal to complete and turn in\nassignments. Using this step as an initial approach, teachers\ncould then continue to build upon the power of enhanced\nmetacognition by implementing activities and interventions\nthat allow students to examine their cognitive and intellec-\ntual approaches toward their work, thus propelling them\ntoward substantial and long-lasting academic improvement.\nThe idea of this multistep approach toward reflection evokes\nan interesting concept: Take an initial affective approach\nwith reflection to motivate students to embrace the responsi-\nbility and willingness to attempt completion of required tasks\nand then subsequently build on their newfound motivation to\nfurther enhance improved academic performance through\nreflective activities aimed at analyzing and evaluating the\napproaches used in completion of those tasks. Using this\nframework, the formula for effective integration of reflection\nas a tool for durable and significant academic improvement\nand motivation may require initial separation of affective and\ncognitive processes followed by a reconnection of the two\nmodalities once initial progress has been established.\nGiven this potential ramification, it is important to note\nthat improved academic performance and motivation is not\nentirely based in the cognitive arena; therefore, reflection\nshould not be relegated to this portion of the student psyche\neither. In today's highly diversified classroom, students\narrive with a plethora of needs, some of which are intellec-\ntual, some of which are social-emotional, and all of which\nmust be determined for each individual student and the con-\ntext that he or she is arriving from. The possibilities are\nendless: an underachieving gifted student from a low-socio-\neconomic urban area, a student with a cognitive or emotional\ndisability from an affluent area, a higher performing student\nwho is frustrated with curriculum due to a language barrier, a\nbrilliant yet introverted student who is at risk due to bullying,\nor simply an average, dominant culture student who appears\napathetic toward the curriculum due to prior negative experi-\nences or sudden life changes that result in a refocus of priori-\nties merely to survive. Given this exponential list of\npossibilities and combinations, it is feasible to surmise that\nwithout some level of affective intervention to remediate\npossible affective duress students will struggle academically\nor suffer from a decline in intrinsic motivation or self-effi-\ncacy. Therefore, a tool that can be used in a highly individu-\nalized and nonthreatening manner is reflection with a focus\non affective and social-emotional growth, which is a tactic\nthat deserves merit not only for serving the whole student but\nalso for its potential to enhance students' lives well beyond\nthe 180 days of the school year by providing an opportunity\nfor time to think about one's thinking and the implications of\nhow the daily interaction with life's quandaries can ulti-\nmately lead to empowerment and success across the intel-\nlectual, social, intrapersonal, and professional spectrums.\nAll in all, the most exigent implication of this study is the\nrevelation that, although student self-reflection as an inter-\nvention for improved academic performance and motivation\nmay not yield the most staggering quantitative results in an\nabbreviated time period, the approach of using reflection as\na tool to enhance and refine students' ability to develop\nmetacognition does not appear to be detrimental in any\naspect whatsoever. All results of this study indicate that\nreflection as a tool for enhanced metacognition in either the\naffective or cognitive framework only served to maintain\nstudents' current academic performance and/or motivation\nor improve it--sometimes significantly for students who\ntruly embraced the potential of its full impact. Therefore,\nthis action research suggests that despite the convoluted\nnature of today's curriculum- and assessment-driven educa-\ntional culture, reflection should not be rejected as a potential\ndetractor for academic performance or a meaningless part of\nthe hidden curriculum that merely serves to help students\nfeel better about themselves. Rather, it should be imple-\nmented in a well-structured, intentional manner with pur-\nposeful fidelity throughout the course of a student's\nacademic career so that it becomes ingrained within the very\nway that he or she approaches the complex issues of intel-\nlectual and social-emotional growth throughout his or her\nlife experience. If this task is accomplished, we have ful-\nfilled our mission as educators because our students deserve\nmore than a curriculum and instruction that teaches them\nconcepts and facts; they are entitled to the exposure of skills\nand tactics that will allow them to develop into their full and\nutmost potential as an individual, which is a sojourn that can\nbe traversed successfully through the power of\nself-reflection.\nAppendix\nBelow is a condensed version of the researcher created\nreflection instrument used for this study, which served as the\nindependent variable. As indicated in the results, the ques-\ntions below were grouped into the following indicators for\nqualitative data analysis: (a) Academic Performance,\nQuestions 1 and 3; (b) Academic Motivation, Questions 2\nand 5; and (c) Affective Motivation, Questions 4 and 6.\nHow has this activity changed the way I think about this\nconcept?\n_____________________________________________\n_______________________________________________.\nDid I truly do everything I could to succeed in this task?\n_____________________________________________\n_______________________________________________.\nDoes the end result of this assignment live up to my personal\nexpectations?\n_____________________________________________\n_______________________________________________.\nDo I feel that my work on this assignment has the potential\nto influence others?\n_____________________________________________\n_______________________________________________.\nIf I were to revisit this assignment in the future, what would\nI do differently?\n_____________________________________________\n_______________________________________________.\nHow has this assignment fueled my thirst to learn more about\nthis topic?\n_____________________________________________\n_______________________________________________.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAsh, S., Clayton, P., & Atkinson, M.
