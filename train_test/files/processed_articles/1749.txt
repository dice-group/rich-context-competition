Although observational stud-\nies have reported that the prevalences of\noverweight, obesity, and severe obesity\nhave increased in recent years,8,15 indi-\nviduals who are obese early in life have\nnot been studied longitudinally to de-\ntermine their risk of developing severe\nobesity in adulthood. To this end, we\nused a US nationally representative, lon-\ngitudinal cohort to determine the inci-\ndence and risk of severe obesity in adult-\nhoodamongindividualswhowereobese\nduring adolescence.\nMETHODS\nNational Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent Health\nThe National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health (Add Health) is a co-\nage, 15.9 years) drawn from a sample\nschools in the United States with un-\nequal probability of selection. Incor-\nporating systematic sampling meth-\nods and implicit stratification into the\nAdd Health study design ensured that\nthis sample is representative of US\nregion, urbanicity, school size, school\ntype, and ethnicity.\nPoststratification sample weights en-\nsure that population estimates at each\nwave conform to population estimates\nfrom individuals eligible for each inter-\nview; thus, the respondents are repre-\nsentative of the US school population in\nI) as they are followed into adulthood.\nmean age, 16.5 years) included wave I\nadolescents still of school age by de-\nsign (including those currently in high\nschoolandhighschooldropouts).Wave\nmean age, 22.3 years) and wave IV, con-\nage, 28.9 years) included all wave I re-\nspondents, regardless of wave II partici-\npation. The most recent data collection\n(wave IV) includes follow-up inter-\nwave I respondents (exclusions: 96 de-\nceased at wave III and 687 not sampled\nat wave III), with 80.25% of the eligible\nrespondents(ineligible:184whomoved\nout of the country, 87 military sta-\ntioned out of the country, and 126 de-\nceased at wave IV) consenting to par-\nticipate in wave IV.\nWritten informed consent was ob-\ntained for all wave I participants. Sur-\nvey procedures have been described\nelsewhere and were approved by the in-\nstitutional review board at the Univer-\nsity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.16\nMeasures\nWeight and height were measured in\nwaves II through IV during in-home\nsurveys using standardized proce-\ndures. Wave I used self-reported height\nand weight data, which were excluded\nfrom this analysis because the gain in\n1 additional year of follow-up was not\nan acceptable trade-off for the error that\nwould have been introduced with use\nof a combination of self-report (wave\nI) and measured (waves II-IV) height\nand weight data.\nBodymassindex(calculatedasweight\nin kilograms divided by height in me-\nters squared) and BMI percentiles from\nmeasured height and weight were de-\nrived for age and sex using the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention Na-\ntionalCenterforHealthStatisticsgrowth\ncharts.17 Given that adolescent BMI\n(wave II; 1996) was not linearly associ-\nated with incident severe obesity, BMI\nwas categorized using the recom-\nmended definitions for comparability\nacross adolescence and adulthood.18\nThesecategoriesweredefinedas:(1)nor-\nmal weight (5th to 85th percentile\non BMI-for-age growth chart or BMI of\nviduals aged 20 years); (2) over-\ndividuals aged 20 years); (3) obesity\ndividuals aged 20 years); and (4) se-\nspondents who exceeded scale capacity\nclassified as severely obese. Incident se-\nvere obesity in adulthood was classified\nas nonsevere obesity at adolescence\n(wave II) and severe obesity at adult-\nAge was recorded as the respon-\ndent's age on the date of examination.\nAge at onset of severe obesity was de-\nfined as age at the wave in which the\nindividual was initially classified as se-\nverely obese. We observed a nonlinear\nrelationship between age at onset of se-\nvere obesity and development of se-\nvere obesity in young adulthood; thus,\nwe categorized age at onset of severe\nobesity as younger than 20 years (ref-\nyears, and 30 years or older.\nConsistent with previous Add Health\ntained from a combination of in-home\nsurveys from parents and adolescents\nand was categorized as non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic\n(Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South\nAmerican, Mexican, or other His-\npanic), or Asian American (Chinese,\nFilipino, or other Asian).\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses were conducted\nusing Stata software, version 10.1 (Stata\nCorp, College Station, Texas). To ac-\ncount for Add Health's stratified sam-\npling strategy, clustered sampling de-\nweights and survey analysis tech-\nniques were used in all analyses. All re-\nsults are nationally representative of\nadolescents who were enrolled in grades\ninto adulthood.\nFor descriptive analyses, percent-\nages were calculated for categorical vari-\nables, while means were calculated for\ncontinuous variables. To compare in-\ndividuals with incident severe obesity\nwith individuals without severe obe-\nsity, a 2-sided t test and F statistic were\nused to test for statistical differences\n(P.05). Incidence rates of severe obe-\nsity during the transition from adoles-\ncence to adulthood were calculated by\nsex, race/ethnicity, and adolescent\nweight status (normal, overweight, and\nobese). A 2-sided F statistic was used\nto compare the incidence of severe obe-\nsity by these categories, and the Bon-\nplied for multiple comparisons.\nDiscrete time hazard models (with\na complementary log-log link), a\ntype of a survival analysis model\nappropriate when the outcome is\nascertained at periodic measure-\nthe relationship between adolescent\nobesity and incidence of severe obe-\nsity in adulthood. Given the rela-\ntively low incidence of severe obesity\nin individuals who had normal\nweight as adolescents, the 3 catego-\nries used to obtain absolute inci-\ndence rates (normal weight, over-\nweight, and obese) were condensed\nto 2 categories, obese vs nonobese\n(ie, collapsing normal weight and\noverweight into the nonobese cat-\negory) for the hazard analyses. Given\nthe particular discrete time interval\nbased on the examination dates and\nobesity data, models were condi-\ntioned on time as a unit of analysis,\nwith age at the examination during\nwhich severe obesity was first\nrecorded serving as the primary time\nvariable in all models. Age-specific\nhazard ratios (incidence rate ratios)\nwere calculated for the probability of\nbecoming severely obese during a\ngiven age range, conditioned on no\nsevere obesity at the beginning of\nthat interval. Discrete time hazard\nmodels assume that once individuals\nbecome severely obese, they remain\nseverely obese and, thus, while\nincluded in models, they no longer\ncontribute to the analysis.\nThe hazard models included only\nrace and sex to provide net effects of\nrisk rather than causal modeling of\nthese relationships. Thus, a parsimo-\nnious model was used to describe the\nrelationship between adolescent obe-\nsity (vs nonobesity) and risk of severe\nobesity in adulthood. To determine\nwhether the relationship between\nadolescent obesity and severe obesity\nrisk varied by sex and race/ethnicity, a\n3-way interaction was used to exam-\nine effect modification using Wald\ntests (P=.10). Despite borderline sig-\nnificance (P=.14), differences in the\nassociations across race/ethnicity are\nclinically important given the racial/\nethnic disparities in the prevalence of\nobesity and its comorbidities. Thus,\nfinal models were sex-stratified and\nincluded interactions between adoles-\ncent obesity and race/ethnicity. Addi-\ntionally, effect measure modification\nby age at severe obesity onset with\nadolescent obesity and age at severe\nobesity onset with race/ethnicity was\ntested, but neither showed effect\nmodification.\nRESULTS\npantsmeasuredatwaveII(FIGURE) were\nincluded in the analytic sample frame,\nexcluding participants of Native Ameri-\ncan race/ethnicity (n=45); individu-\nFigure.

Yet, little is known\nregarding the persistence of severe obe-\nsity, the progression of obesity to se-\nvere obesity, and how risk differs by sex\nand race/ethnicity. Understanding these\npatterns is critical for reducing the bur-\nden of obesity and for implementing in-\nterventions to prevent the progression\nof obesity to severe obesity. Findings\nfrom current research suggest that in-\nterventions designed to prevent adult-\nonset severe obesity would best be\nimplemented among obese adoles-\ncents, particularly black girls.\nAlthough previous studies have\nshown a persistence of obesity from\nchildhood and adolescence to adult-\nthat have examined persistence and\ndevelopmentofsevereobesity.Thecur-\nrent findings indicate that (1) there is\nstrongpersistenceofsevereobesityfrom\nadolescence to young adulthood; (2)\nthere is a relatively high incidence rate\nof severe obesity during the transition\nfrom adolescence to adulthood; and (3)\nindividuals who were obese as adoles-\ncents were significantly more likely to\nbecome severely obese in adulthood,\nhighlighting the need for primary and\nsecondary prevention of severe obe-\nsity early in the life course. In particu-\nlar, primary prevention efforts should\nfocus on the prevention of obesity prior\nto adolescence, while secondary pre-\nventioneffortsshouldfocusontheiden-\ntification and treatment of high-risk\ngroups in adolescence, including over-\nweight and obese adolescents.\nThere are a few limitations to this\nanalysis. The main objective of this\nstudy was to determine the incidence\nof severe obesity during the transition\nfrom adolescence to adulthood and to\ndetermine which groups are at high-\nest risk. As such, the analytic strategy\nwas designed to test the net effects of\nrace/ethnicity and sex on severe obe-\nsity rather than undertake causal mod-\neling of these relationships. Clearly, sev-\neral other biological, sociocultural, and\nenvironmental factors associated with\nrace/ethnicity and sex are likely to affect\nsevere obesity incidence. Future re-\nsearch should address the specific fac-\ntors associated with onset of severe obe-\nsity. A second limitation to this research\nis the use of conventional albeit some-\nwhat arbitrary BMI cut points. These cut\npoints do not capture differences in in-\ncidenceofobesitycomorbiditiesthatex-\nist on the continuum of BMI values.28\nLikewise, cut points do not capture the\ncomplex process of body weight regu-\nlation29 or the gradual process of weight\ngain.30 However, cut points are needed\nfor clinical guidance28 and for compara-\ntive purposes.18 Finally, while unique\nlongitudinal data were available for the\nperiod from adolescence to young\nadulthood, these data are nationally rep-\nresentative of the school-aged popula-\nup over time into adulthood and, thus,\nare not nationally representative of the\nlow-up.\nTable 2.
