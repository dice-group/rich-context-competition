    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe article processing charge (APC) financed Open Access is a publication model that provides immediate and free access\nto scientific articles. More than half of the world's Open Access articles are published according to this concept. However, a\nside effect of the model is that research is not published if researchers cannot pay the publication charge. The study examines\nthe nature of this phenomenon, its extent, and implications. The study places a special focus on authors who are not affiliated\nwith a research institution. The proportion of these authors is identified among 2,184 Danish authors in Danish periodicals\nin 2010. The possibility for poor researchers to receive compensation from publishers is investigated as well. Paying the\nAPC is a problem for many researchers--represented by around 30% of authors who have published in Danish journals\n(unemployed scientists, students, as well as retired and private employees). Grants from publishers exist, but they are small\nand too uncertain to ensure that research is published optimally. This study predicts that a large amount of valuable research\nrisks not being published if this publishing model dominates without alternatives or countermeasures.\n",

This principle is probably no more valid. A political\ndemand that research should be freely available on the\nInternet, namely, Open Access, has been created in connec-\ntion with digital publishing. There had been an intense dis-\ncussion of how free access would be financed when\nsubscription payments are abolished. Furthermore, there has\nbeen consensus that free access to research should not be at\nthe expense of quality. Therefore, development of sustain-\nable publishing models is sought.\nTwo of the three dominant Open Access models will not\nbe discussed here: In the first model, called Green Open\nAccess, authors self-archive their own articles. The existing\nform of publishing is retained, and subsequently each author\nmakes his article available in an open archive. The second\nmodel, Delayed Open Access, retains subscriptions while\ndelaying open access for a period, so the publishing com-\npany can manage to generate revenue to cover its expenses.\nNeither of these two models is optimal, as there will not\nbe immediate access to the originally published articles, and\nit is questionable whether the business principles are sustain-\nable in the long run.\nThe third model, called Gold Open Access, is based on\npaid release. In most cases, the authors have to pay an article\nprocessing charge (APC) to have their research published.\nThe model does not have the other two models'drawbacks--\narticles are published immediately after the authors pay their\ncontribution. There is genuine free access.\nIt has long been debated whether this publishing form\nwould be economically viable (Bergstrom & Bergstrom,\n2004), but after a few years of application, publishers such as\nPublic Library of Science (PLoS), BioMed Central, and oth-\ners have shown that free magazines can be among the world's\ntop ranked and still be economically viable (King &\nThus, there has been a noticeable change of attitude\ntoward Gold Open Access. Commercial publishers have\nstopped their resistance, and even the world's largest pub-\nlishers have begun to publish journals based on author pay-\nment. Politically, there is also growing support. Based on a\nreport by the Finch committee, the Government of Great\nBritain supported an Open Access policy based on author\nHowever, the author-funded publishing model has a type\nof built-in system failure that prevents research from being\n1National Museum of Science and Technology, Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark\nCorresponding Author:\nJ\u00f8rgen Burchardt, National Museum of Science and Technology, Fabriksvej\nEmail: jorgen.burchardt@mail.dk\nResearchers Outside APC-Financed Open\nAccess: Implications for Scholars Without\na Paying Institution\nJ\u00f8rgen Burchardt1\n Keywords\nacademic publishing, APC-financed Open Access, waive, research institution, developing countries\n2 SAGE Open\npublished if researchers or their institutions cannot afford to\npay. It is a well-known problem that authors from the poorest\ndeveloping countries cannot pay even though some publish-\ners have introduced a policy to compensate them partly or in\nwhole.\nEven in the wealthiest countries, authors can have prob-\nlems paying this fee. This study focuses on one such group:\nthe researchers without an institution behind them to pay for\ntheir publishing.\nAPC-based publishing is indeed sustainable for individ-\nual journals, but the issue is about whether the publishing\nform is also sustainable when we consider science from the\nperspective of the big picture. Is it sufficient to have all\nresearch of value published, as the traditional subscriber-\nbased publishing model could deliver? This study will pro-\nvide evidence of a potential large problem.\nAPC Financing\nIt is not quite new that authors have paid to have their research\npublished. In the 1930s, individual journals collected a fee\nfrom authors to reduce the price of the subscription (Curb &\n1965, the U.S. government gave official permission to use\nfederal funds for fee waivers. King and colleagues (King &\nAlvarado-Albertorio, 2008; King, McDonald, & Roderer,\n1981) state that more than 50% of articles in science in the\n1970s were published with some form of author payment.\nOne paid if you wanted an illustration in color or if the article\nwas above a certain maximum length. There are no state-\nments from humanities, social sciences, and other areas out-\nside science, but the proportion was probably extremely low.\nIt was mainly company-owned journals that charged extra\nfees, opposed to society-owned journals. Commercial pub-\nlishers' journals were funded by subscription payments, and\nduring the 1970s, many researchers preferred to publish for\nfree in these journals.\nIn his overview of Open Access, Solomon (2012)\ndescribes how the commercial publisher BioMed Central\npublished its first free article in 2000. Its publishing based on\nAPC made the publisher so profitable that in 2008, it was\nsold to a leading commercial publisher, Springer Verlag. In\ntotal of 76,000 Open Access articles (Bj\u00f6rk & Solomon,\n2012), which was almost half of all Open Access articles,\nand with the continued surge, probably well more than half\nof Open Access articles today belong to this category of\nThe level of APC varies widely among journals. Some\njournals have sufficient external financing and they do not\ncharge APC at all or ask only for a very small amount. An\nand prestigious journals with a high impact factor are expen-\nwas an increase of 10% in the average APC in a selected\nHowever, there are many other payment structures; for\nexample, institutions may pay a lump sum to cover the pub-\nlishing of all their researchers' works, as is done by the\nworld's largest Open Access publisher BioMed Central.\nHowever, other publishers require a payment to have a man-\nuscript judged, and perhaps the author must also pay extra\nfor a subsequent linguistic correction.\nResearchers want to publish in the best journals and are,\ntherefore, willing to pay an extra large amount to gain higher\nvisibility and recognition. Publishers behind the APC-based\npublishing model, therefore, attach considerable importance\nto marketing themselves to authors, in contrast to the tradi-\ntional publishers, whose marketing is targeted at users (Bj\u00f6rk\nAPC System Weaknesses\nInitially, it was discussed that the publishing method could\nhave negative consequences. An Organisation for Economic\nCo-Operation and Development (OECD) report (Houghton\ndisadvantages when publishing required a payment:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There will be an even greater disparity between\nresearchers. It was already established that research-\ners with large research were more advanced than\nresearchers outside, and the difference will be\nstrengthened to the detriment of unknown and young\nresearchers.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It may not work in large areas of the humanities, arts,\nand social sciences with funding limitations.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It may be difficult to operate in areas with a high num-\nber of rejected manuscripts, as the authors of the few\nrecorded additional articles would have to pay the edi-\ntorial costs of rejected manuscripts.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It would lead to researchers publishing less.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There would be a shift in the published articles\nbecause scholars in some research directions would\nfind it easier to raise money than others.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Researchers in developing countries would not have\naccess to publishing.\nLiyanage and Raina MacIntyre (2006) explained the\nproblems by distinguishing between multiple types of\nauthors; author-paid publishing is not suitable for research-\ners early in their careers, researchers employed in govern-\nment offices or agencies that do not pay for the employees'\npublications, or researchers whose research is not funded by\nthe pharmaceutical industry.\nThe publishing principle may also seem unfair, as\nresearch-intensive universities would face an extra financial\nburden in comparison with more teaching-oriented universi-\nties and highly applied areas, interrupting the business to\nBurchardt 3\nfund most of the cost. Similarly, some countries would pay\nmore than other \"free rider\" countries that could benefit from\nresearch without having to pay. For example, the United\nKingdom pays about 3.3% of the world's costs of journal\nsubscriptions but accounts for 5% of the world's research\n(The Science and Technology Department, 2004), and a\nreport from the Research Information Network (Hulls,\nRennison, & Rattensperger, 2008) indicates that the United\nKingdom produces as much as 6.6% of the world's research.\nDeveloping countries' problems are addressed by Papin-\nRamcharan and Dawe (2006), who conclude that APC will\ncertainly exclude less fortunate researchers from publishing\nin Open Access journals. It is true that several publishers\noffer support, but the articles state that often the publication\nwill be delayed and aid funds may be limited. In general,\nmany researchers are not on an equal footing with their peers\nin more economically advantaged parts of the world.\nApparently, politicians believe that research funding from\nfoundations also has to include payment of theAPC. This has\nbeen implemented in the guidelines for many research coun-\ncils, including Horizon 2020 in the European Union (EU).\nThe British House of Commons stated in a 2004 report (The\nScience and Technology Committee, 2004) that payment\nshould not depend on a researcher's personal financial situa-\ntion; it should not even be his or her institution's responsibil-\nity: \"We believe that such funding should originate with the\nresearch funder, not the institution. By that payment would\nbe included in the total research funding, this would facilitate\neffective planning and budgeting\" (p. 78).\nHowever, not even one of the richest areas of research,\nmedicine, could have the entire fund paid through these\nfunds (Schroter, Tite, & Kassem, 2006). The study showed\nthat only 41% of externally funded researchers had money\navailable at the time their manuscript was accepted for pub-\nlication. This was because the project accounts were closed\nbefore they should be published, or--if the project was still\nrunning--sufficient funds for publishing were not allocated.\nThe conclusion was that the author payment would probably\nprevent research from being published.\nGraczyski and Moses (2004) have the same doubt that\nplanning and budgeting should be able to predict the\nresources required for publication. Sometimes, a promising\nproject may not carry enough useful knowledge and thus\nmay not utilize the funds allocated for publishing, while\nother projects and highly productive researchers could pro-\nduce a large series of interesting articles. Neither research\ncouncils nor, for that matter, university departments can pre-\ndict researchers' future production capability.\nSeveral studies have been conducted on researchers' atti-\ntudes toward Open Access. Unfortunately, most are based on\nextremely low response rates, so their results are not statisti-\ncally valid, and therefore they will not be mentioned here.\nSolomon and Bj\u00f6rk (2012a) show how researchers spe-\ncifically funded their APC in various disciplines (Table 1).\nTheir survey shows a big difference in the authors'\nopportunities. Research council funding is more common in\nthe life sciences and physical sciences than in the social sci-\nences and humanities (the same conclusion was reached by\nbusiness and economics pay for publishing, whereas 10%\ngot the publisher to waive the charges.\nArticles in the best journals were often funded by research\ncouncil's funds or with the support of institutions. By con-\ntrast, the proportion of self-payers was greater in lower-\nranked journals with a lower rate of APC. This suggests that\nif you have funds from a research council, you can publish in\nthe best journals, and if you do not have such funds, you have\nto choose a cheaper journal.\nIt should be noted that the study has only involved\nresearchers who could raise funds. When the authors were\nasked about the maximum APC, they will pay, on average,\n$649. One must consider that the amount would have been\nmuch lower if also the researchers who had not published\nwere asked.\nFor comparison, Halsted (2003) believes that it would be\nimpossible for poorer researchers to finance an APC of\n$1,500; although even researchers employed by U.S. govern-\nment institutions would not be able to obtain a grant of this\nsize.\nResearchers from poor countries have often had to finance\ntheir research themselves; in fact, the entire 39% of research\nis self-funded, including 14% of the research is published\nafter remission of APC compared with, surprisingly, a\nrespective 11% and 12% in more affluent countries (Solomon\nLiyanage and Raina MacIntyre's (2006) study of spon-\nsorship and payment of APC showed a clear link between\nindustry funding and type of published research. They found\nthat the payment model would certainly affect the published\nresearch nature, when the author payment favored strong\norganizations, industry sponsored research, and prosperous\ncountries.\nThe majority of the published research from universities\nis basically not financed by external funds. According to\nKing and Tenopir (2004), the universities funded $30 billion\nof the research that led to the publication, with $5.8 billion\nTable 1.

Especially, important\nbasic research is not funded by external funds (Schroter, Tite,\n& Smith, 2005). The publishing model could also cause\nproblems in countries with little public funding.

These researchers \"without a research institution\"\nare not employed at an institution that expects research from\nthem. They either have no work (i.e., they are unemployed)\nor they work in an institution where research is not expected\nof them.\nThere is a great interest in research due to its social value.\nHowever, the statistical reports do not include researchers\noutside research institutions. Most countries use the OECD\ndefinitions, as described in the Frascati Manual (OECD,\nmanuals recognizes the existence of researchers outside\ninstitutions. The statistics are imperfect. Only an empirical\ninvestigation can shed light on this phenomenon and its\nextent.\nTo judge the impact of researchers not having support\nfrom a research institution, this study investigates publishers'\npolicy of compensating for missing funding by giving the\nauthors a waiver (see Table 2).\nAnalysis of Journals\nTo identify researchers without connection with a research\ninstitution, Danish scientific journals were reviewed for a\nsingle year. All issues of each of the journals were obtained\nand analyzed. For each article, the author(s) were identified,\nand their employment situation was subsequently studied.\nThe study was limited to include only articles from Danish\nresearchers. This was convenient, as it is assumed to be eas-\nier to identify Danes. Danish research institutions have very\ndetailed information about their employees not found at all\nuniversities and institutions worldwide.\nDanish journals are defined as journals published in\nDenmark and/or with a high percent of Danish authors--on\naverage, more than 50% Danish authors. They are often pub-\nlished in Danish, but they also have an increasing number of\narticles in English. It would not have been feasible to per-\nform the same intense analysis with international journals.\nThe number of journals would have been very large, and\neach journal would have had a very small proportion of\nDanish researchers.\nThe year 2010 was chosen because it is very close to the\npresent, and therefore gives a picture of the current situation.\nAt the same time, it is assumed that the various databases and\nwebsites are reasonably updated, so that information about\nmost of the 2010 magazines was available when the study\nwas conducted.\nThe contents of 110 journals were examined, resulting in\nthe identification of 2,221 scientists who were authors of\n1,386 articles (see Table 3). The analyzed journals are all of\nthe highest scientific quality as they are included in the list of\napproved professional journals published by the Danish\nAgency for Science, Technology, and Innovation under the\nMinistry of Higher Education and Science. This list is pro-\nduced by the country's leading researchers to give an indica-\ntion of the distribution of research funds. The list covers the\nbest research journals in the world as a resource for research-\ners seeking to publish in quality publications. The list for\nOf the 208 identified Danish journals on the list, a little\nmore than half were investigated. To make the work manage-\nable, only those journals that allowed easy access for the\nevaluation and within a reasonable time were selected. A few\njournals did not publish issues in 2010 and several had no\nDanish authors. Priority was given to the remaining journals,\nand journals were selected that had been identified by\nBurchardt's (2007a) work and the inventory of Danish jour-\nnals (Burchardt, 2007b) as journals with the highest scien-\ntific quality.\nThe journals included a variety of publishing models,\nincluding subscriber-based journals and Gold Open Access\ncompletely sponsored by institutions; only the APC-funded\njournal model was not represented.\nIt was decided to include only authors of genuine research\npapers. This apparently clear concept appeared in the real\nworld to be more complicated, because it was necessary to\njudge whether a contribution was an article. The journals\nthemselves did not always mention whether a contribution\nwas a peer-reviewed article or a less valuable writing. There\nis a subjective estimate underlying the assessment, and\nalthough the author of the study is a long-standing editor, it\nrequired a closer reading of both the article and often another\nsubstance in the journal to determine whether a contribution\nrose up to the level of quality as an article in the particular\nacademic field should have.\nThe Author's Real Affiliation\nOften, journals give an indication of the article authors'posi-\ntion and institutional affiliation. This information was widely\nused in the study. Frequently, the information was checked\ndue to the long publishing process, which in some cases\nshowed that an alleged employment at the time of publica-\ntion was incorrect. Following the assessment of people's\nBurchardt 5\nrelationships, journal publishing should be considered as a\ntypically long process. In general, publication of a manu-\nscript is often a year long, from its first time submission to its\nacceptance. If the author was employed at the time of filing\nin December 2008, this appointment could have expired\nwhen the article was accepted and published in the spring of\nTo control this information, this study used the Danish\nNational Research Database that is based on information\nfrom universities. This database was supplemented by virtu-\nally all local databases from the universities. In total, they\nprovided information on 55% of the researchers.\nFor practical reasons, the employment situation of these\nmore than 1,000 people has not been further investigated. It\nis assumed that when they are included in a university data-\nbase, they have had a more or less permanent attachment to\nthe institution. Sample checks have shown some examples of\n\"researchers outside research institutions\" among those who\nare registered as affiliated with a university, but the number\nis considered so small that it would not affect the main result.\nThis is specifically a portion of students who are registered\nas employees, and at the same time, administrative staff and\nothers without proper research duties were included in the\ndatabases as well.\nWhere the biographical information in a journal did not\nshow an association with a research institution at a univer-\nsity, private company, or another organization and no univer-\nsity was listed as the researcher's place of employment, it\nwas presumed that there was no such connection; a link to a\nTable 2.

In these cases, the authors were unem-\nployed, students, retired, or employed at an institution with-\nout research duties; their placement between the categories\nwas performed to the best estimate.\nThe researchers' employment statuses were identified\nthrough various sources. In this phase, the Internet was an\ninvaluable source, where especially LinkedIn, Facebook,\nand personal websites were seen as credible sources. In these\nsocial networking sites, friends and acquaintances would\nquickly reveal obvious misinformation, and thus the margin\nof errors was assumed to be minimal. The information was\noften outdated, but it was generally easy to identify informa-\nSome cases were supplemented by information obtained\nfrom the authors themselves or from the journal their article\nwas published in.\nA general problem around many of the researchers was\ninvestigating whether they had a reasonably close connec-\ntion with a research institution. Should a temporary teacher\nwith a few hours of training per year be regarded as a univer-\nsity employee? What affiliations did a lecturer with a pri-\nvately owned company have?\nIn principle, temporary teachers are not paid for research,\nand should therefore not be included in the measure of\nresearchers at universities. As mentioned, information from\nthe universities' own databases was used, and part-time\nteachers were often erroneously included in the inventory of\nuniversity-based researchers.\nGenerally, the persons associations with the labor market\nin 2010 were studied, and if they were deemed to have at\nleast half-time employment at a research institution, they\nwere included. There were many doubts, and generally, the\nassessment was conservative.\nInvestigation of the Publishers' Waiver Policy\nA supplementary investigation was conducted to speculate\nthe actual situation for individual researchers to have their\narticles published without having to pay the APC.\nThe world's most important publishers with businesses\nbased on APC-financed publishing were asked in the spring\nof 2013. A standard mail was sent to all the publishers with\nquestions about how the publisher would handle an applica-\ntion. A specification of different situations for researchers\nwas included. Some of the publishers did not respond, and\ntherefore their responses were collected from information on\ntheir websites.\nThe selection of the 27 largest publishers (see Table 2) was\nbased on the study conducted by Solomon and Bj\u00f6rk (2012b).\nResults\nThe examination of the Danish journals revealed a number of\nresearchers outside research institutions. Based on close\nexamination, these researchers were divided into various cat-\negories. The study will analyze these groups and what drives\ntheir research (see Table 4).\nThe Retired\nPensioners represent 7% of those without an institution.\nThey are scientists of their own volition, often without any\nreward or hope of future personal benefit. The pensioners'\nshare seems to be a substantial part, but if the figure is put up\nto the total number of pensioners, there is actually a remark-\nably small number of people conducting research in their\nretirement age. The number is still so high that one can only\nsay that these retirees make a significant contribution to\nresearch.\nPensioners can be divided into two groups. The research-\ners in the largest group were employed as scientists in their\npast work, and they still care about their research areas.\nThe Unemployed\nThe professionals are clearly the majority in this group, com-\npared with the self-taught. The unemployed are virtually all\nresearchers or future researchers.\nThe groups' share is just less than 8%. The percentage is\nprobably somewhat higher, because it is not desirable to be\nknown as unemployed, so researchers often indicate a differ-\nent employment situation, if the opportunity is available. The\nunemployed provide a significant contribution of relevant\nresearch for society. Their proportion fits nicely into the\noverall unemployment rate, which at that time, according to\nIn a dynamic labor market for researchers, greater periods\nof unemployment from a job occur when a research project\nends before the next one begins, so these unemployment\nrates may be natural. Mobility, especially for the highly edu-\ncated, is remarkably high. Graversen (2002) indicates that\n30% of researchers at public research institutions change\njobs every year.\nThe Students\nOne of the major groups is students who publish the results\nthey collected during their studies. Fifteen percent of\nBurchardt 7\nresearchers without institutions fall into this category. Of\nthese, the vast majority is PhD students, but students at lower\nlevels also publish research findings.\nThe number of students publishing is not particularly high\ncompared with the approximately 6,000 current PhD stu-\ndents, of whom 2,000 graduate each year. Their research is\nstill so large that it is a community resource of significant\nsize and value.\nIt was difficult to determine whether a student's article\nwas submitted for publication while he was still a student or\nwhether it was submitted after the final exam. Nevertheless,\nwe note that research institutions mostly do not recognize\nstudent research. Only a small number of students are con-\nsidered participants in their institution's research, and there-\nfore they are recorded in the databases of research from the\ninstitution in the annual report or otherwise.\nEmployees of Non-Research Institutions\nThe largest group of researchers outside research institutions\ncomprises those at the many private and public institutions.\nSeventy percent of researchers without institutions are found\nin this very diverse group. There are employees of both large/\nsmall and private/public companies, and with many different\ntypes of contracts.\nApproximately, one fourth of the researchers in this group\nown their own firms. These are typical consulting firms\nwhere the holder delivers services. Research is not primarily\nconducted for benefits, but the holder occasionally works\nclosely with researchers and sometimes conducts research in\nthis context. For example, there are several journalists who\nprovide consulting services with communication functions\nfor clients. The consultant then uses his acquired knowledge\nto write a scientific article. These companies, especially,\nneed to show \"seriousness,\" and it cannot be excluded that an\nacquired advertising effect helps to explain the owner's\ninterest in publishing.\nA portion of the employee's research is unrelated to the\ncompany's activities. This research is the employee's own\nresearch agenda. It may, for example, be a bank agent pro-\nviding historical literature. The company draws only limited\nusefulness from the research, and activities are assumed to\nbe performed at the employee's leisure.\nIn the remaining companies, the research topics are partly\nor wholly related to the company's activities. An employee\ncan conduct his research because it allows him to gain insight\ninto topics he deals with at work, and he may even be given\ntime to conduct the research during work hours.\nMuch research deals with the institution's primary activ-\nity. The starting point is the daily practice where experience\nis summarized in a scientific article. It could be a judge in a\ncourt in Greenland who writes an article on the evolution of\nthe Greenland justice, or the bank manager in a large bank\nwho contributes with an article on current monetary and\ncredit developments in the crisis.\nPublishers' Waiver Policy\nThe statement from the world's 27 largest Open Access pub-\nlishers reveals through our questionnaires that only four will\nautomatically waive the APC for authors from the poorest\ndeveloping countries, as identified in the World Bank classifi-\ncation of countries. Half of the publishers indicate that you can\napply to have the APC waived. No publisher automatically\ngives a waiver to the unemployed, pensioners, and so on.\nThere is no transparency about the number of applications,\nand the publisher's policy can be changed without the public's\nawareness. One might assume that the proportion of refusals\nwould be high in areas with many poor scholars. Several pub-\nlishers claim no connection between the editorial office and\nthe people judging the waiving. However, in a questionnaire\nresponse, one publisher wrote that it \"gives discount according\nto the quality of the paper and the academic background of the\nauthor, rather than the country of the author.\" For this com-\npany, it is business; they award discounts on low-quality arti-\ncles from rich countries but refuse to support articles of the\nsame quality from low-income countries.\nThe publishers'secrets about their administration of waiv-\ners suggest that it is not possible to examine to what extent\npublishers have exempted writers from paying APC, but it is\nassumed to be a relatively small portion; thus, PLoS should\npercent is the level Copernicus Publications supposedly sets\naside in the budget for subsidies, and 13% is the number\nobtained from a sample of journals (Salomon & Bj\u00f6rk,\nDiscussion\nToday, sustainable publishing houses manage quality publi-\ncations based on APC financing. Even the largest commer-\ncial publishers have come to stay, and it will be interesting to\nfollow where the levels of APC will stabilize.\nIt seems that OpenAccess is here to stay, as Solomon (2013)\nstates, \"It enjoys broad-based support and it is easy to sell polit-\nically\" (p.28). Much of the development is due to public poli-\ntics. Different initiatives have, in recent years, deemed the\nmarket forces ineffective. So far, public research councils\nrequire fast OpenAccess, and thereby indirectly direct research\nfunds to replace the existing subscription revenue, even though\none could imagine that the traditionally independent universi-\nties would oppose similar reductions in research funding in the\norder of, say, 2% to 5% to finance the APC.\nThe business model is certainly mature. Perhaps it is\napproaching the soaring upward curve, as found in tradi-\ntional innovation processes, as Solomon and Bj\u00f6rk (2012a)\npredict. They estimate, however, that the precondition is that\nresearchers do not oppose payment: \"Author attitudes toward\npaying the required APCs and their ability to obtain funding,\nbalanced against the quality of the service they experience\nwill determine . . . the future\" (p. 105).\n8 SAGE Open\nTable 5. Potential Loss of Research.\nResearch financed by Which researchers will be affected\nFunds The productive, the delayed\nUniversities Students, young, innovative/controversial, temporary employees, employed at less wealthy\nuniversities\nPrivate companies Research without commercial interest\nIndependent researchers Most\nNote. The table indicates the different types of researchers with potential problems in paying the APC for publishing. APC = article processing charge.\nThis claim can be accepted only if researchers' resistance\nat the same time has a political expression. If researchers--\neven in large numbers--simply fail to publish in author-\nfinanced journals, this publishing model could easily\ncontinue with great success. If the poorest, say, 40% of sci-\nentists could not pay, would the APC-based publishing still\nbe a commercial success, where the 60% pay a contribution\nso high that the journals can afford to compensate around\n10% of poor researchers publishing?\nIn particular, the questionnaire responses indicate that\nresearchers without funds cannot be sure of having their\nresearch published in an author-paid journal. They might\napply to some publishers, but half of the publishers do not\nwaive the APC at all. Only four publishers provide automatic\nsupport for researchers in poor countries.\nThe problem with the developing countries few resources\nfor subscription-based journals attempted remedies in the\nform of adoption of schemes such as the Health InterNetwork\nAccess to Research Initiative (HINARI) project of the World\nHealth Organization (WHO), where publishers deliver mag-\nazines for free or at very reduced prices for countries with a\nminimal per capita income (SQW, 2004). It is debatable\nwhether publishers will have the same opportunity to refrain\nfrom APC revenue. The lower income countries have notori-\nously very few resources to pay for subscriptions, while pub-\nlishers do not lose anything by providing free digital access.\nIn contrast, the publishers have unfunded costs if they have\nto waive an APC.\nThere are probably very few articles from the \"low-\nincome economy\" countries because they barely reach 0.53%\nof the world's publications, according to a count for 2009\nfrom the statistics released by the National Science Board\n(2012). More significant is that the second-largest publisher,\nPLoS, automatically charges a reduced fee for low-income\ncountries such as India, Pakistan, and others whose scientific\nproduction is much greater.\nFor the Gold Open Access publishing model, however, one\nshould consider that these companies mostly publish journals\nin the richest areas of science. An automatic rule for compen-\nsation may not be feasible in less wealthy areas of research.\nIf the author-paid publishing model were dominant, its\nbuilt-in system failures would mean less published research.\nEven if countermeasures were to be implemented, as dis-\ncussed later, a large proportion of research would probably\nnot be published.\nIn general, the author-paid model discriminates against all\nauthors with little access to funding. This will certainly affect\nthe publishing by researchers without a research institution\nbehind them. This group is of special interest because its\nmembers probably can no longer have their research pub-\nlished in Gold OpenAccess journals, as there is no institution\nto pay for them. Very few parishes or high schools will pay\nfor their employees (e.g., priest, teacher) to publish research.\nIt is obvious that it would be unthinkable for most retired\npeople, the unemployed, or students themselves to pay for\nhaving their research published. Just the payment for two\narticles in top journals in one year would be a financial strain\nfor most (Table 5).\nThe research shows that around 30% of authors in Danish\njournals are without a research institution behind them. The\nresult is based on statistics for one single year, 2010, but\nnothing indicates a difference from other years. Some indi-\nvidual journals have a very different publishing profile every\nyear, but with many journals in the sample this should be of\nminor importance. The largest journals are in medicine,\nwhich does not have these shifts in editorial practice.\nThe sample did not include all the Danish journals, but\nnothing indicates that the missing journals should have quite\nanother profile.\nThe interpretation of the status of each researcher is based\non qualitative judgments, and this method obviously does not\nyield a 100% accurate result. Furthermore, as mentioned, this\nstudy used information from the universities, where the infor-\nmation was known to include researchers with only a very\nweak relation to the university; the universities would certainly\nnot pay for all those researchers to publish if they were asked.\nGenerally, the uncertainty was relatively high for which\ngroup a researcher belonged to (\"students,\" \"unemployed,\"\n\"retired,\" or \"employed in an institution without research\nsupport\"). The greatest uncertainty existed in the distribution\nof employment types in self-owned firms, and public or pri-\nvate institutions. The single calculated percentages should be\ntreated with caution. However, there was reasonable cer-\ntainty of whether a person was at a research institution.\nThere is a possible recent development that can explain\nsome of the phenomenon of researchers without institutions.\nThe labor market is changing rapidly, and many more\nemployees have a very loose connection with their work-\nplace. In the new networked economy, researchers can work\nfor several institutions. Simultaneously, increased mobility\nBurchardt 9\nimplies that researchers often have only a few years at a\nresearch institution, when the duration of many grants is just\n1 to 3 years, and then the researcher is often transferred to\nanother institute.\nThe development is similar for students. They are forced\nto work in international, cross-institutional cooperation, and\nas a result, they fail to form a strong connection with any\nsingle institution.\nThe study is, to a large extent, based on such qualitative\njudgments and has the normal problems that occur within\nthis tradition of research. In spite of the known problem that\npeople provide false statements, at this instance claiming that\nthey have a connection with a research institution, the study\nattempted to control these statements through different meth-\nods and sources.\nProbably, the percentage of researchers without a research\ninstitution is larger than the mentioned 30%, but the number\nitself is not that important. The phenomenon of a large\namount of research not being published is the most important\nmessage of the study.\nThe percentage of researchers in non-Danish journals\nwho are without an institution has not been investigated.\nRandom selections of those journals have shown the same\nkind of authors. Probably, the percentage of such authors in\nnationally and regionally oriented journals is larger than in\ninternational ones. One could imagine that the regional/\nnational journals have better contact with and knowledge of\nall potential authors, and therefore can include experience\nfrom researchers outside the traditional research institutions;\nfurther studies should investigate this distribution. This study\nhas shown the existence of a potential problem.\nNot all researchers outside research institutions would\nhave problems with the APC-based publishing model. Some\ncan have their institution pay for them. In some cases, a com-\npany might pay the fee for publishing when it will directly\nbenefit from an employee's published research. One must\nassume that the work is often performed during working\nhours and with the institution's consent. The institution may\nhave two quite different interests in allowing employees' to\nconduct research. It may be that the research will help to\ndevelop knowledge about the area, and thereby indirectly\nrenew the institution. This is the case with the Greenland\nlegal system, and probably also in part with the bank man-\nager's contribution. Another large institution-related interest\nbehind scientific activity lies in public relations. It is certain\nthat the bank director's article shows the bank's seriousness\nin having a scientific paper accepted and helps to promote\nthe bank as one of the country's leading financial institu-\ntions. The article should be read by journalists and should\nhighlight the institution.\nThe gain for a company should be very visible, as an APC\nfor most firms is a significant and extraneous amount, but\nthis is estimated to be a possibility only for a minor percent-\nage of the authors.\nThe problem with lost research from this group is not the\nonly consequence of the publishing model. As shown in the\nliterature, there would also be a loss of university research\nfrom less wealthy universities and research institutions and,\nof course, typically from researchers in a weak power situa-\ntion. Young people would find it difficult to break through,\nthe growing number of researchers with a non-permanent\nrelation to an institution would have problems with the mod-\nern co-operative networks working on cross-words without\nbelonging to a single institution, and finally innovative and\ncontroversial research would probably find it difficult to\npenetrate.\nIt is feared that under the new Open Access publishing\nsystem, students and part-time employees whose research is\ncurrently part of universities' official statistics would no lon-\nger be considered as a part of the university's research staff if\nthe university pays for their research. Publication of an arti-\ncle from a student is going to compete with the head of\ndepartment's trip abroad, so to speak.\nEven funded research will be difficult to publish.Although\nscientists should be better able to manage their budgeting\nthan when Schroter et al. (2006) conducted their study, there\nwill still be a problem for the very productive researchers\nwith late manuscripts (which is not very uncommon).\nIf the author-paid publishing model just gets a fair spread,\nthere will, for most researchers, no longer be the freedom to\nchoose the best journals for their articles. The best journals\nwould often also be the most desirable but with a high level\nof the APC. Researchers would find themselves with limited\nresources. The implication for researchers basically is a loss\nof academic freedom. They will be forced to publish in jour-\nnals that do not treat their manuscripts optimally. The fin-\nished articles, thus, may have lower quality than articles\npublished under the previous subscription-based model,\nwhere top journals printed all the best manuscripts.\nIt is quite certain that there must be sharp adjustments\nbefore the author-paid publishing model can cater to all\nrequirements in the scientific world. Establishing funds to\ncompensate is one solution, but this would necessitate new\nroutines and decision-making processes. This would affect\nall researchers. Only extremely rich project researchers\nwould be able to send their manuscripts to all journals,\nincluding the best and most expensive. The new funds would\nprobably be limited, so priorities would have to be set.\nUniversities are interested in supporting their researchers'\npublishing, and local university publishing funds are proba-\nble to appear in the coming years. Universities compete with\neach other for positions in the various rankings, and here the\ntotal impact factor is an important parameter. It will initially\nbe seen at universities with a high proportion of scientific,\ntechnical and medical (STM) research, where one can use\nthe Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports and similar\nmeasuring tools that cannot be used in book-oriented areas\nsuch as humanities and social sciences (HSS).\nPower relations at universities and similar research insti-\ntutions are also certainly changing. It is no longer (only) the\nacademic norms, habits, and good practice in the scientific\nworld that will be responsible, but now (paying\nfor) publishing will be determined by economics, which is\ncontrolled in a hierarchical system. The decision on publish-\ning will be taken by intruders.\nResearchers with no institutional affiliation will be in the\nworst situation. There will possibly be general funding\nopportunities established where one can apply, but the same\nproblem with unauthorized decision makers also will exist.\nFurthermore, publishers also will be interested in support-\ning researchers without funding so they do not miss good\nmanuscripts, and several have established internal funds as\nseen from the questionnaire. However, there is no assurance\nthat the best manuscripts will be selected when there alleg-\nedly is no connection between the professional assessment\nand the aid. Only researchers from the poorest countries can,\nin a few publishing houses, be sure to receive support.\nThe problems with financing could be solved with a 100%\nautomatic funding from the (over) state/federal side\nwould allow all items to be funded, and no authors, institu-\ntions, or research councils would be burdened with paying. It\nwould also make it easier for publishers who only had to\nsend bills to one place. This idealistic approach is unfortu-\nnately not probable. It can be assumed that the brute market\npower will make a new publishing world with a privileged\ngroup of researchers at rich institutions and/or within rich\nresearch areas that can publish in the world's top--and APC-\nfinanced--journals. A large group of \"proletarian\" research-\ners had to publish in free, lower quality journals that were not\noptimal for their manuscripts. Their chances of receiving\nexternal funds will be reduced compared with the more rec-\nognized researchers in the privileged group. The polarization\ngap will continue to grow.\nConclusion and Perspectives\nThe study shows that APC-financed publishing is a commer-\ncial success already covering more than half of all the pub-\nlished Open Access articles. This model can, due to political\nsupport, be the dominant publishing form and probably have\na monopoly on publishing within many scientific areas.\nUnfortunately, it has a type of built-in system failure that\nprevents research from being published. The study shows\nthat up to 30% of Danish researchers in Danish journals\nwould have problems having their research published in\nAPC-based journals, because they have no research institu-\ntion behind them to pay. Other studies have shown that many\nother researchers risk not having their research published\neven when they have an affiliation to a research institution.\nIt would be difficult to specify the size of the lost research,\nbut without further research in this area, no one knows if\nthere will be a loss of 5%, 25%, or 40%. Without counterac-\ntion, there will surely be a considerable loss of societal value.\nThis is the visible drawback. In addition, there is an invis-\nible change in the nature of the research world itself when we\nno more have the principle that all quality manuscripts are\npublished in the best journals. There is a danger that\nintruders to academic quality will decide whether an article\nis published. Another danger is polarization among the group\nof researchers between lucky star researchers at rich institu-\ntions and a proletariat of researchers without accesses to the\nbest journals, and thereby the necessary reputation behind\nfurther financing of their research.\nIn view of the large potential drawbacks, there is actually\nvery little research in this area. One can understand that com-\nmercial companies exploit revenue opportunities in a new\nform of publishing without considering in detail the societal\nimplications. The same indifference could seem surprising\nfor politicians and public administrators.\nThe development in this area needs to be carefully sur-\nveyed. Continued research should discuss compensations\nthat have no side effects on the researchers' world and the\nquality of published material. Probably, it should be investi-\ngated how less harmful Open Access publishing models like\nthe Green Open Access or central-funded journals could\nserve an alternative.\nThe area needs a high priority. If it is true that a very\nlarge number of researchers stand outside a potential domi-\nnating publishing model and the quality of their published\nresearch will deteriorate, it will not only be a problem for\nindividual researchers but also indirectly for the world\neconomy.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBergstrom, T., & Bergstrom, C.
