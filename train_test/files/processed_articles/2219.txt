The twofold purpose of this study is to describe tobacco treatment provision across a representative sample\nof U.S. facilities and to use these data to develop the brief Index of Tobacco Treatment Quality (ITTQ).\nMethods: We constructed survey items based on current tobacco treatment guidelines, existing surveys, expert\ninput, and qualitative research. We administered the survey to a stratified sample of 405 facility administrators\nselected from all 3,800 U.S. adult outpatient facilities listed in the SAMHSA Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment\nServices. We constructed the ITTQ with a subset of 7 items that have the strongest clinical evidence for smoking\ncessation.\nResults: Most facilities (87.7%) reported that a majority of their clients were asked if they smoke cigarettes. Nearly\nhalf of facilities (48.6%) reported that a majority of their smoking clients were advised to quit. Fewer (23.3%)\nreported that a majority of their smoking clients received tobacco treatment counseling and even fewer facilities\n(18.3%) reported a majority of their smoking clients were advised to use quit smoking medications. The median facility\nITTQ score was 2.57 (on a scale of 1\u00ad5) and the ITTQ displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .844).\nMoreover, the ITTQ had substantial test-retest reliability (.856), and ordinal confirmatory factor analysis found that our\none-factor model for ITTQ fit the data very well with a CFI of 0.997 and an RMSEA of 0.042.\nConclusions: The ITTQ is a brief and reliable tool for measuring tobacco treatment quality in substance abuse\ntreatment facilities. Given the clear-cut room for improvement in tobacco treatment, the ITTQ could be an important\ntool for quality improvement by identifying service levels, facilitating goal setting, and measuring change.\n",

People with mental illness or\nsubstance abuse problems consume nearly half (44%) of\nall cigarettes smoked in the U.S. [1]. Drug treatment\npatients are interested in quitting smoking, and quitting\nsmoking does not adversely affect short-term drug use\noutcomes [2-15]. Indeed, quitting smoking in the first\nyear of drug treatment predicts better long-term\nsubstance abuse outcomes [16].\nU.S. Public Health Service (PHS) tobacco treatment\nguidelines recommend that high quality, evidence-based\ncare include the following: a) all smokers be offered treat-\nment, b) patients unwilling to quit be provided with brief\nintervention to build motivation, and c) patients willing to\nquit be offered evidence-based treatment [17]. The highest\nabstinence rates are achieved when pharmacotherapy is\n* Correspondence: krichter@kumc.edu\n1Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Kansas\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2013 Cupertino et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Office-based\nintervention should follow five major steps (The \"5 A's\"):\nAsk, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange follow-up. The\nguidelines also recommend that office-based systems\nidentify, track, and follow-up with smokers at every visit\nand remind providers to intervene with every smoker.\nFinally, substance abuse treatment facilities should adhere\nto treatment guidelines for the general population and\nshould incorporate new interventions, that are effective\nfor those in drug treatment, as new treatments become\navailable.\nTo date, the prevalence and quality of tobacco treat-\nment in drug treatment has been poorly described. In\n1998 the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service\nAdministration's (SAMHSA's) Uniform Facility Data Set\nsurvey found that only 20% of U.S. substance abuse\ntreatment facilities offered any smoking cessation\ndrug abuse treatment facilities found that 54% \"offered\nclients help quitting smoking,\" but only 10% had any\nformal group or individual therapy dedicated to smoking\ncessation and fewer than 1% of facilities offered quit\nsmoking medications [20]. Friedmann et al. found that\nsomewhat more U.S. facilities provide formal counseling\ncolleagues (2005) estimated that Australian substance\nabuse treatment programs provide brief advice to quit to\n36% of clients who smoke; education about the risks of\nsmoking to 39%, counseling to quit to 26%, and quit\nsmoking medications to 15% [22]. Knudsen and colleagues\nsurveyed U.S. counselors about the frequency with which\nthey provide five brief behavioral interventions for tobacco\nuse (0 = never, 5 = always); the interventions included\nassessing current tobacco use, assessing past tobacco use,\nadvising tobacco users to quit, assessing willingness to\nquit, and using brief intervention to increase motivation\nto quit [23]. They found that counselors on average\nprovided interventions infrequently, with a mean scale\nThree recent studies examined the effects of a 2008\nNew York State (NYS) policy change that required all\npublicly funded drug treatment facilities to offer tobacco\ndependence treatment to clients. In a survey of staff and\nclients from a random sample of 10 programs conducted\nbefore and one year after policy implementation,\nGuydish and colleagues found that client smoking preva-\nimplementation of tobacco treatment services differed\nby facility type [24]. Clients in outpatient facilities\nreported no pre-policy to post-policy change in the\namount of tobacco treatment services they received.\nThose in residential treatment received less services after\nthe change took effect. Clients in methadone treatment\nreported receiving more services post-implementation.\nEby and colleagues surveyed 147 clinicians associated\nwith 13 facilities immediately before and one year after\nthe NYS policy went into effect [25]. They found that\nthe manner in which the new policies were implemented\nin each facility predicted staff perceptions of how fairly\nthe change occurred. Perceived fairness was in turn pre-\ndictive of staff provision of tobacco treatment, psycho-\nlogical strain, and behavioral strain. Last, Brown and\ncolleagues summarized state records and surveyed a ran-\ndomly selected sample of directors of 285 facilities 3 years\nbefore and 9\u00ad12 months after policy implementation [26].\nCompared to before the policy, at post-assessment a\ngreater proportion of administrators reported they \"always\nor formally\" screened clients for tobacco use; also, they\nreported a greater number of tobacco services were\navailable for clients. State discharge data on medica-\ntions administered during treatment found a significant\nincrease in the percentage of clients receiving nicotine\nreplacement therapy, from 3.0% before implementation\nto 6.3% after implementation.\nThese studies suggest that treatment practices vary\ngreatly, are far from routine, and are of poor quality. For\nexample, although quit smoking medications are known\nto double quit rates, few clinics offer or recommend them.\nMoreover, no comprehensive measures of tobacco treat-\nment quality exist \u00ad none of the studies measured all PHS\nguideline recommended elements of evidence-based care.\nOnly one study assessed whether facilities provided motiv-\national interventions to unmotivated smokers [27] and\nseveral failed to assess whether cessation medications\nwere recommended or provided [19,23]. Moreover, the\nNYS studies suggest that policy change can increase im-\nplementation of treatment services but may increase strain\non staff if implemented poorly.\nDespite the low provision of tobacco treatment in drug\ntreatment facilities, societal trends are creating new in-\ncentives for treating tobacco dependence in drug treat-\nment. Staff attitudes toward nicotine dependence\ntreatment appear to be changing; surveys conducted in\npatients to quit smoking compared to surveys conducted\nchanges in hospital tobacco policy, state laws, and local\nordinances forced drug abuse treatment facilities to\nrestrict indoor smoking and consider treating tobacco\nuse [29]. Major organizations now recommend incorpor-\nating tobacco treatment into addictions treatment\n[30,31], and two states--New Jersey and New York--\nhave launched major initiatives to incorporate tobacco\ntreatment into drug treatment.\nResearch on tobacco treatment in drug treatment is in\nits infancy \u00ad the types of services offered have not been\nwell described, no conceptual models for quality of care\nhave been developed, and measures of services and\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/8/1/13\npatient outcomes are lacking. Although few programs\noffer formal services, many more will likely begin to\ntreat nicotine dependence as external forces and patient\ndemand for services increases. In the absence of clear\ncriteria and measures of quality of care, programs may\nadopt services based on cost and convenience rather\nthan efficacy [32]. It is important to develop a set of\nmeasures that capture how tobacco services are deliv-\nered, evaluate these practices, and ultimately disseminate\neffective practices throughout the treatment community.\nThe purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to describe\ntobacco treatment provision across a representative\nsample of U.S. outpatient substance abuse treatment\nfacilities, and 2) to develop and describe a brief index\nof tobacco treatment quality that assesses the extent to\nwhich facilities provide guideline-based treatment for\ntobacco dependence.\nMethods\nSample\nTo obtain a representative sample of all current out-\npatient U.S. drug treatment facilities for adults, we de-\nrived our sampling frame from SAMHSA's Inventory of\nSubstance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), a con-\ntinuously updated, comprehensive listing of all known\nsubstance abuse treatment facilities in the United States\nApplied Studies provided a download of descriptive data\non all facilities in the I-SATS in 2008. These descriptive\ndata are collected by the annual National Survey of Sub-\nstance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), which\nrecently had begun to collect data on whether facilities\nprovide nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) [34]. There\nwere 3,800 outpatient, adult facilities in the I-SATS sam-\nple. Based on a confidence interval of 95% and a margin\nof error of 5%, we calculated we should collect data from\n400 facilities to accurately describe services provided by\nU.S. facilities [35]. Deriving our sample from the I-SATS\nenabled us to determine the representativeness of our\nfinal sample, because we could use descriptive data from\nthe N-SSATS to compare our survey sample to non-\nparticipating facilities (see Measures and Results, below).\nWe stratified all 3,800 facilities by three characteristics\nthat have consistently been associated with the likelihood\nof providing tobacco treatment services [21,29]. These\nthree characteristics are Ownership (profit or non-profit),\nNicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) provision (yes/no)\nand whether or not facilities provide methadone treatment\n(yes/no) (Table 1). To achieve a final sample that mirrored\nthe U.S. population of facilities, we pre-determined the\nnumber of facilities required to represent each strata\nwithin our sample (N = 400) and recruited from facilities\nin each cell until all strata were filled.\nRecruitment\nWe recruited facilities and conducted surveys between\nOur study biostatistician (BG) stratified the facilities\nusing data from the N-SSATS. He then randomly ordered\nthe list of facilities within each strata and printed separate\ncontact lists for each strata. Research assistants mailed out\ninvitation letters to all facilities within each strata. The let-\nter included a number for facilities to call to either a) par-\nticipate in the study or b) opt out of the study. The letters\nalso noted that a trained research assistant might call a\nfacility at a later date to further describe the study and\npersonally invite facilities to participate. Two weeks after\nletters were mailed a research assistant contacted facilities\nto invite them to participate, collect verbal consent and\nconduct surveys. Study staff called down strata lists until\neach strata was filled.\nOne person in a leadership position (clinic director,\nmedical director, counseling supervisor, head nurse, or\nowner) from each facility completed the survey by phone,\nfax, email, or mail, according to responder preference.\nParticipants were reimbursed $20.00 for their time.\nIt would have been ideal to interview multiple staff in\neach facility, or to collect data from facility treatment\nrecords. However, resources did not permit this intensity\nof data collection in enough facilities to obtain a repre-\nsentative sample of U.S. facilities. There are several\nnational panel surveys that collect data from 1\u00ad2 per-\nsons at each facility. These include the National Drug\nAbuse Treatment System Survey (NDATSS), otherwise\nknown as the Outpatient Drug Abuse Treatment Studies\n(ODATS), which collected data from a program director\ninterview, a clinical supervisor interview, or both [36].\nAlso, the National Treatment Center Study [37]\nattempted to collect data from a program administrator\nand a lead clinical supervisor at each participating site.\nSome questions were directed at administrators, and\nsome at clinical supervisors, so in many instances indi-\nvidual respondents were asked to report on the types\nand extent of services provided across their entire faci-\nlity. Last, N-SSATS collects a single survey from facil-\nities and provides a snapshot of the nature and extent\nof services provided at all U.S. facilities on one given\nday [38]. Hence, a number of surveys collect data\nfrom individual representatives on the type and extent\nof services provided in their facilities. We kept our\nsurvey narrow--focused on practices related to tobacco\ntreatment--in order to increase the likelihood that respon-\ndents could respond reliably and accurately.\nTo conduct the test-retest analysis, a consecutive sam-\nple of 40 survey participants were invited to take part in\na test\u00adretest reliability sub-study of the ITTQ. Partici-\npants received an additional $20 for returning the second\nsurvey. Test-retest was conducted over a 2- to 4-week\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/8/1/13\ntimeframe. The University of Kansas Medical Center Ethics\nCommittee (IRB# 10979) approved all study procedures.\nMeasures\nTo assess treatment provision we developed the Index of\nTobacco Treatment Quality (ITTQ) using the following\napproach. First, we used as broad \"domains\" of treat-\nment the 5 A's from the PHS Guideline for Treating\nTobacco Use and Dependence [39]. Based on this frame-\nwork, we developed a broad list of items within each do-\nmain based on current guidelines, existing studies, and\noriginal qualitative research conducted in facilities\n[40,41]. We refined or discarded items that were not\nconceptually related to each of the 5 A's. We shared our\nlist of measures with 10 experts in providing tobacco\ntreatment in drug treatment facilities, recruited from the\nAssociation for the Treatment of Tobacco Use and\nDependence (ATTUD; www.attud.org). They rated items\nin terms of their importance for treating tobacco de-\npendence and ability to discriminate between facilities\nthat provide high versus low quality services. We refined\nthe draft instrument based on expert advice, strength of\nassociation with smoking cessation outcomes in the\ngeneral population, and other considerations such as\nfeasibility and survey length.\nFor each item, survey participants were asked \"How\nmany of your (clients/your clients who smoke) received\n. . .(name service).\" Response categories were in the\nform of a Likert-type scale that was anchored to the per-\ncentage of smokers who were provided the service. These\nincluded Almost None (5% or fewer); Few (~25%); About\nFor example, as research assistants administered surveys,\nthey would read the question, then the response categories\nand their associated patient percentages: \"How many of\nyour current tobacco using clients were assessed for their\nreadiness to stop using tobacco? Almost None--5% or\nfewer; About Half--about 50%....\"\nIt is important to note that we opted to ask respon-\ndents what proportion of their current clients who smoke\nreceived each service, instead of how frequently the facil-\nity provided the services. The latter is the more common\nmethod for assessing tobacco service provision--surveys\noften ask providers if they \"routinely\" provide one of a\nlist of services. However, how respondents interpret\n\"routinely\" can be highly subjective. We opted to ask re-\nspondents to estimate the proportion of their current,\nsmoking clients that received each service in order to\nguide them to anchor their response to a concrete num-\nber of clients who received services. This figure is readily\nverifiable through record reviews, which a future study\ncould pursue to validate these measures. The Healthcare\nEffectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) includes\nmeasures of the percentage of smokers who were advised\nto quit or to whom providers recommended medications\nor quit methods in the past year [42]. In order to re-\nduce recall bias, we crafted somewhat different mea-\nsures that asked about treatment of current clients,\nrather than clients seen in the past year. In addition,\nwe developed new items to collect data on additional\npractices such as screening for smoking status, assess-\nment of readiness to quit, and other services.\nWe assessed whether facilities had a specific location in\ntheir treatment files to record smoking status (Yes/No).\nWe also used a scale to assess the intensity of tobacco\ntreatment by assessing how often staff provide counseling\nto clients to help them quit using tobacco (1 = Only\nwhen a client specifically requests treatment; 2 = Part of\none session; 3 = An entire session; 4 = More than one ses-\nsion; 5 = Four or more sessions /It is integrated into all\naspects of treatment).\nTo describe facility representatives completing the sur-\nvey, we collected gender, smoking status, and job title.\nSmoking status was assessed by the following item:\n\"What best describes your current tobacco use status?\"\n(Current regular tobacco user; former regular tobacco\nuser; never used tobacco regularly). We used N-SSATS\ndata, imported into our final database by unique\nfacility-level identification numbers, to describe facility\ncharacteristics.\nWe selected a subset of 7 items to form the final\nIndex of Tobacco Treatment Quality. Six items repre-\nsented the PHS guideline recommended services with\n\"A\" level of evidence for efficacy in smoking cessation.\nThe 7th item was the scale of treatment intensity.\nEach facility's score on all 7 items was summed and\nthen divided by 7 to yield a final score ranging be-\ntween 1 and 5. A score of 1 represents facilities in\nwhich almost no clients received any services and 5\nrepresents facilities in which almost all clients received\nall services.\nAnalyses\nWe compared our sample to non-participating facilities\nin the U.S. to assess representativeness based on selected\nvariables from the 2008 N-SSATS: geographic identifiers\n(urban or rural), ownership (for profit and not-for\nprofit), affiliation (federal agency, religious organization\nor hospital), provision of nicotine replacement therapy,\navailability of opioid treatment, program for DUI/DWI/\nother offenders, program/group for criminal justice cli-\nents, facility size, licensure (state, mental health depart-\nment, state health department, hospital authority or\nother state agency), and accreditation. We used descrip-\ntive statistics to display the number and percentage of\nfacilities that reported that \"many\" to \"almost all\" of\ntheir smoking clients received each service. We used the\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/8/1/13\nchi-square and the Student's t-tests to examine the\nsignificance of differences.\nAfter selecting the 7 items that formed the final ITTQ,\nwe calculated test\u00adretest reliability. To do so, intraclass\ncorrelation coefficients (ICCs) were computed for the\ntwo administrations of the ITTQ. We report the ICC as\na Kappa statistic for the final ITTQ and the 7 items that\ncomprise it, using Shrout's adjectives and cutoff values\nThe interrelationship of ITTQ and its 7 items was ana-\nlyzed by ordinal confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Or-\ndinal CFA is a generalization of Rasch models [44]. The\nordinal CFA analysis was conducted by Lavaan package\nmodel, we used a one factor model and treated the re-\nsponse of each item as an ordinal variable. The model fit\nwas evaluated by two statistical fit indexes: Comparative\nFit Index (CFI > .90) and Root Mean Square Error of\nApproximation (RMSEA < .08) [45]. The composite reli-\nability was calculated with the output obtained by ordinal\nconfirmatory factor analysis [46]. Our interpretation of\nreliability follows Shrout's guidelines (see above).\nFinally, we calculated the mean, median, and standard\ndeviation of the ITTQ across all facilities. We computed\nCronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency of the\nITTQ [47]. To depict the distribution of scores we graphed\nthe frequencies of the ITTQ scores of all facilities. To fur-\nther describe the index, we summarize ITTQ scores by our\noriginal stratification of types of facilities, as described in\nTable 1. SPSS 18.0 was used for all data analyses. Statistical\nsignificance was set at  = 0.05 for all tests.\nResults\nThe 405 facilities within our eight strata had a similar\ndistribution as those found in the overall facility popula-\ntion in the U.S. (Table 1). Of respondents, two-thirds\nwere female and approximately half (51%) were current\nor former smokers. Responders held various roles in the\nprogram; clinic directors (59%), owner (12%), head\ncounselor (8%), and other (21%).\nStudy sample versus non-participating facilities\nStudy facilities were similar to U.S. facilities by most\nmeasures of comparison. Approximately half (48%) of\nfacilities were privately owned and only 14% provided\nnicotine replacement therapy (Table 2). Most facilities in\nour sample did not offer nicotine replacement therapy\nnor methadone treatment. Most were not-for profit and\nfew (10%) were located in a hospital. Two-thirds (66%)\nof the facilities had less than 100 clients. The average\nnumber of smokers was 75% and almost a quarter of re-\nspondents (23%) stated that their facility was mandated\nto provide tobacco treatment. Our sample had small but\nsignificant differences from U.S. substance abuse out-\npatient treatment facilities on 4 of 18 variables. Facilities\nin our sample were more likely to provide nicotine re-\nplacement, more likely to be rural, more likely to be cer-\ntified by a mental health department, and less likely to\nbe certified or licensed by a state substance abuse treat-\nment facility.\nTobacco treatment services\nWithin our sample, most facilities (87.7%) reported that\nmany/almost all of their clients were asked if they smoke\ncigarettes (Table 3). Nearly half (48.6%) reported that\nmany/almost all of their smoking clients were advised to\nquit. Some (38.1%) facilities reported many/almost all of\ntheir smoking clients were asked if they were ready to\nquit. Fewer (23.3%) reported that many/almost all of\ntheir smoking clients received tobacco treatment coun-\nseling and even fewer facilities (18.3%) reported a majority\nof their clients were advised to use quit smoking medica-\ntions to quit. Few (24.3%) facilities routinely reported\nmany/almost all clients receive motivational counseling to\nhelp them become more motivated to quit.\nTable 1 Stratification of sample and comparison to remaining facilities\nCell description Non-participating N = 3366 (%) Survey sample N = 405 (%)\n*NRT = Nicotine Replacement Therapy.\n** Compared to all U.S. facilities, facilities in our sample were more likely to provide nicotine replacement, more likely to be rural, more likely to be certified by a\nmental health department, and less likely to be certified or licensed by a state substance abuse treatment facility.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/8/1/13\nMost facilities (84.7%) reported they had a specific\nlocation in their treatment files to record smoking status\n(data not shown).

For this reason, the median score\n(2.57) is a better summary of the overall trend in the\ndata. Cronbach's alpha for the ITTQ was .844, indicating\ngood internal consistency between index items. The ITTQ\nscore exhibited marked differences by facility type\n(Table 4). Nonprofit facilities that offered NRT and metha-\ndone treatment had the highest mean ITTQ score (3.98).\nFor-profit facilities that offered neither NRT nor metha-\ndone treatment had the lowest mean ITTQ score (2.40).\nDiscussion\nThe ITTQ is a brief and reliable tool for measuring tobacco\ntreatment quality in substance abuse treatment facilities. It\nhas very good test-retest reliability. Moreover, ordinal CFA\nfound the ITTQ score is a good summary of each facility's\nstanding on 7 evidence-based treatment practices. It is\nsensitive to high as well as low levels of tobacco treatment,\nand discriminates between different types of facilities. Our\ndevelopment sample was representative of most U.S. drug\ntreatment facilities, which lends confidence to the use of\nthe ITTQ as a benchmark for tracking the prevalence and\nquality of treatment provision in the future. Descriptive\ndata from the survey suggest that most facilities identify\nsmokers but do not provide evidence-based tobacco\ntreatment.\nFindings from our overall survey accord with prior stud-\nies. The great majority of facilities routinely collect smok-\ning status, many facilities provide brief advice to quit,\nsome provide counseling, but few provide or recommend\nis important to note that our sample was, compared to\nfacilities not participating in our survey, more likely to\nprovide NRT. Although the difference was not large (6.3%\nversus 14.4%), it was significant and suggests that our\nsample may be somewhat more predisposed toward pro-\nviding tobacco treatment, and the real prevalence of\nservices is somewhat lower. The overall low prevalence of\nmedication use in facilities may be due to the fact that\nmany drug treatment facilities do not have prescribers on\nstaff, counseling staff do not have the license to prescribe\nmedications, and staff in traditionally \"chemical free\" facil-\nities might be reluctant to recommend any form of medi-\ncation, even over-the-counter aids.\nThe ITTQ could be a useful tool for quality improve-\nment. It should, however, be subjected to validation\nagainst clinical records and patient reports to ensure it\nmeasures the true level of service provision. Moreover, it\nshould be evaluated before and after clinical practice\nchanges to assess its sensitivity to changes in the quan-\ntity and quality of services provided. Should it prove to\nbe valid and sensitive, individual facilities or groups of\nfacilities could use the ITTQ to identify their current\nquality score and set goals for quality improvement. Be-\ncause the response categories are anchored to the num-\nber of clients receiving services, it could be converted to\na chart-based survey, in which measures are derived\nfrom treatment data as opposed to self-report. This fea-\nture would be useful in settings that use paper or elec-\ntronic health records [48], the latter of which could be\ndesigned to collect these measures and generate auto-\nmatic reports. Because the current median ITTQ score\nis below the mid-range of the scale, it is likely the ITTQ\nwill be able to detect increasing rates of treatment\nprovision as facilities adopt new treatment practices.\nStudy limitations include factors common to survey\nresearch. The sample included only outpatient facilities\nand findings may not be applicable to inpatient facilities.\nOur facility sample differed significantly from non-\nresponding clinics on 4/18 facility characteristics, which\nindicates our sample was somewhat different from all\nadult outpatient facilities. The most important of these\ndifferences was the relatively higher prevalence of NRT\nprovision among sample facilities, which suggests that\nour findings may be somewhat optimistic in terms of the\nlevel of tobacco treatment. We asked one person to\nrespond on behalf of each facility: the findings' accuracy\ndepends on how familiar respondents were with facility\nFrequency of Facilities with ITTQ Score\nITTQ Score\nFigure 2 Frequencies of ITTQ Scores in 405 U.S. Substance\nAbuse Treatment Facilities.\nTable 4 Mean ITTQ score by type of facility\nCell description Mean ITTQ Confidence\ninterval\n*NRT = Nicotine Replacement Therapy.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/8/1/13\nservices. Respondents included only owners or top-level\nadministrators: counselors and supervisors, as frontline\nworkers, may have different perspectives on the extent\nof tobacco cessation treatment. Our surveys were self-\nreport and hence subject to social desirability bias. To\nassess the validity of the ITTQ, future studies should\nvalidate it against clinical records or other forms of\ntreatment documentation.\nThe study also had several strengths. Our sample size\nwas robust. By using a sampling frame linked to facility\ncharacteristics supplied by SAMHSA, we were able to\ncompare our sample with non-participating facilities.\nWe constructed our survey based on treatment guide-\nlines, existing surveys, and expert advice. Hence the sur-\nvey was designed to have content validity, as it measured\naspects of care supported by evidence-based treatment\nguidelines. Moreover, it was judged to have face validity\nby our team of experts. The final instrument included all\nrecommended elements of evidence-based tobacco treat-\nment. Response categories were anchored to numbers of\nclients treated and may represent closer estimates of\nactual provider behavior compared to prior surveys.\nLast, test-retest and ordinal CFA suggest the survey is\nreliable and a good summary score for facility perform-\nance of evidence based tobacco treatment. The ITTQ\ndiscriminated between our different strata of facilities\nand confirmed the findings of other studies--which sug-\ngests it is not only a brief and but also a valid measure\nof tobacco treatment.\nConclusions\nOffering tobacco treatment to drug treatment clients\ncould enhance treatment outcomes and reduce long-term\nmorbidity and mortality. Brief and valid indices such as\nthe ITTQ are important tools for quality assessment and\nquality improvement. Should comparisons with treatment\ncharts and patient reports of services further validate the\nITTQ, it could serve as an outcome measure for interven-\ntion trials designed to enhance adoption of tobacco treat-\nment in drug treatment facilities.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors have no competing interests to declare.\nAuthors' contributions\nAPC helped to design the study, oversee data collection, analyze findings,\nand created the first draft of the report.
