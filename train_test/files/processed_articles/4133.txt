    "abstract": "Abstract. When making a saccadic eye movement to a peripheral target, a simultaneous stimulus\nonset at central fixation generally increases saccadic latency, while offsets reduce latency (`gap\neffect'). Visual onsets remote from fixation also increase latency (`remote distractor effect'); however,\nthe influence of remote visual offsets is less clear. Previous studies, which used a search task,\nfound that remote offsets either facilitated, inhibited, or did nothing to saccade latencies towards\na peripheral target. It cannot be excluded, however, that the target selection process in such search\ntasks influenced the results. We therefore simplified the task and asked participants to make eye\nmovements to a predictable target. Simultaneously with target onset, either one or multiple remote\nstimulus onsets and offsets were presented. It was found that peripheral onsets increased saccade\nlatencies, but offsets did not influence the initiation of a saccade to the target. Moreover, the number\nof onsets and offsets did not affect the results. These results suggest that earlier effects of remote\nstimulus offsets and of the number of remote distractor onsets reside in the target identification\nprocess of the visual search task rather than the competition between possible saccade goals. The\nresults are discussed in the context of models of saccade target selection.\n",

Moreover, the offset of\na fixation stimulus has been shown to increase the number of so-called `express saccades',\nwhich have a short latency around 100 ms (Fischer and Boch 1983; Fischer and Weber\n1993). The reduction in latency with fixation offsets (`gap effect') has been attributed to\nthe disappearance of the stimulus acting as a warning signal, especially when presented\nslightly before target onset, by providing a temporal cue about the onset of the visual target\n(Reuter-Lorenz et al 1995; Ross and Ross 1980). The offset of a visual fixation stimulus is\nalso thought to reduce activity in neurons involved in maintaining fixation (Munoz and\nWurtz 1993a, 1993b). The reduction of activation at fixation is expected to result in a faster\ninitiation of a saccade to a target, both because of a reduction of lateral interactions between\nthe activity at fixation and at the target position, allowing for target activity to reach a critical\nthreshold earlier (Trappenberg et al 2001), and because fixation is released even in the\nabsence of lateral inhibition, with the consequence that fixation activity drops below a\ncritical threshold more quickly, allowing for a faster onset of the saccade (Findlay and Walker\n1999). By contrast, saccade latency is increased when a visual onset appears remote from\nthe target location, with the greatest increase observed for onsets occurring around the\ntime the target is presented [Walker et al (1995); however, see Bompas and Sumner (2009)].\nThis so-called `remote distractor effect' (RDE) appears to be an automatic process, as it also\noccurs in situations where the target location is known in advance and, as a consequence, the\n84 F Hermens, R Walker\nsaccade planning process does not involve discriminating between the target and distractors\nGiven these results, the question arises whether the offset of distractors remote from the\nsaccade target will produce a similar facilitation effect as observed for visual offsets at central\nfixation, or whether, instead, they increase latencies, just like remote distractor onsets. Faster\nresponses could be expected, as there is no a priori reason why the offset of a peripheral\nstimulus would not provide a temporal cue to indicate the onset of the target and would\nnot lead to a reduction of competition in the oculomotor map. Furthermore, it has been\nsuggested that the inhibitory influence of fixation neurons, thought to be involved in the\ngap effect, extends beyond the immediate fixation region to at least 10 degrees from fixation\ncould have similar effects as stimulus offsets at fixation. In fact, evidence for a facilitation\nof saccadic responses in the presence of irrelevant peripheral offsets was obtained in a\nstudy comparing the effects of either one or seven offsets on goal-directed saccades (Todd\nand van Gelder 1979). Even though the target stimulus could be presented at only one of\ntwo possible locations in both conditions, the additional six irrelevant offsets resulted in a\ndecrease of saccadic latencies to the target (see also, Rolfs and Vitu 2007). In addition, the\noffset of an attended peripheral stimulus, located away from a central fixation stimulus,\nhas been shown to facilitate the production of short latency `express saccades' (Braun and\nBreitmeyer 1988; Mayfrank et al 1986). The observed reduction in latency and increase in the\nfrequency of express saccades are consistent with remote visual offsets acting as a temporal\ncue and reducing fixation-related activity which, otherwise, would have inhibited saccade\ninitiation.\nStudies investigating the influence of distractor onsets and offsets in `oculomotor capture'\nparadigms have, however, produced conflicting findings regarding the effects of distractor\noffsets. In such paradigms, the focus is not on whether irrelevant stimuli increase or reduce\nsaccade latencies, but instead, whether stimuli unrelated to the task `capture the eyes', ie\ninduce an eye movement to the distractor stimulus rather than the target. Typically, a search\nparadigm is used, in which participants have to locate a target among a set of distractors.\nFor example, Boot et al (2005) investigated oculomotor capture by task-irrelevant onsets\nand offsets when participants searched for a target letter among an array of distractors.\nSimultaneously with target onset, a new letter was presented or one of the already present\ndistractors was removed. Whereas the appearing distractor captured the eyes in about 30% of\nthe trials, no such oculomotor capture occurred for disappearing distractor items. Moreover,\nsaccades to the target, when the eye was not captured by the distractor, were delayed for\ndistractor onsets, but not for offsets. By contrast, similar, strong effects of distractor onsets\nand offsets were found in a search task in which participants were required to make an eye\nmovement to a target that changed contrast (Ludwig et al 2008). Compared with baseline, in\nwhich no distractor was present, larger numbers of incorrect initial saccades were observed\nboth to onsets and offsets, in addition to longer saccadic latencies to the target on trials\nwhere the distractor was successfully ignored. To summarise, remote offsets have either\nbeen shown to reduce latencies (Todd and van Gelder 1979; Rolfs and Vitu 2007), to increase\nStudies investigating the effects of remote stimulus offsets so far have relied on saccade\ntasks in which the target had to be located among a set of distractors. In contrast, studies\ninvestigating the effects of remote distractor onsets have shown robust influences on latency\nalso under conditions in which there is a clearly defined saccade goal (Edelman and Xu\n2009; Walker et al 1997). The question arises whether the effects of remote offsets are\nrestricted to a saccade selection task, or whether they also occur when the target is highly\nOnsets and offsets and saccade programming 85\npredictable, just as in the RDE. We investigated this issue by presenting remote visual\ndistractor onsets and offsets in a remote distractor paradigm with a fixed target location.\nParticipants were presented with a predictable target to which they had to make an eye\nmovement. Simultaneously with target presentation, one or more distractor stimuli appeared\nor disappeared from the screen.\nBesides comparing onsets and offsets, the experiment also investigated whether the\nnumber of distractors influences the size of the RDE. Previous research found that when the\nnumber of irrelevant distractor onsets in a visual search task is increased, saccadic latencies\nto the target become longer (McSorley and Findlay 2003). However, it is not clear whether this\neffect of the number of distractors is due to increased uncertainty about the target location,\nor whether the additional distractors impose stronger inhibition on target-related signals in\nthe saccade motor map. By varying the number of distractors for a predictable saccade target,\nit can be established whether more distractors automatically result in stronger inhibition, or\nwhether these distractors need to be possible saccade goals for the effect to occur.\nTwelve participants (1 male, 11 female, age range 18\u00ad40) took part in the experiment. Two\nof the participants were the authors, whereas the others were students at Royal Holloway,\nUniversity of London, naive to the purpose of the experiment, who participated for course\ncredit. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Before the experiment,\nparticipants were informed about the general purpose of the experiment after which\nthey signed a consent form. The study was approved by the Royal Holloway Psychology\nDepartment's local ethics committee.\nA 2400 AMD Athlon PC and the experimental builder software package (SR Research Osgood,\nON, Canada) presented the stimuli on a 21 inch CRT screen with a refresh rate of 100 Hz. Eye\nmovements were recorded with an Eyelink II (SR Research Osgood, ON, Canada) video-based\neye tracker in pupil only mode at 500 Hz. Eye movements of the right eye were analysed.\nFigure 1a illustrates the stimulus sequence (in reverse contrast), showing, in this particular\nexample, a trial with the target appearing on the left together with three distractor onsets or\noffsets. Illustrations of target screens for other numbers of onset and offset distractors are\nshown in the figure 1b. Stimuli were presented in white on a black background. On onset\ntrials (figure 1a, top-left), the fixation cross (0.3 deg of visual angle in width and height) was\npresented in isolation and, after a variable delay (between 1200 and 1600 ms), the target (a\ntriangle of 0.4 deg in width and height) appeared at a distance of 5.7 deg from the centre\nof the screen. Simultaneously with the target, one, two, or three distractors (filled circles\nof 0.4 deg in diameter) appeared, also at 5.7 deg from the centre of the screen, at any of\nfour positions (left, right, above, or below fixation) not occupied by the target. In the offset\ncondition, three distractors were presented simultaneously with the fixation symbol and one\nor more disappeared when the target was presented (figure 1a, top-right). A blank screen\npresented for 1000 ms separated the trials.\nIn half of the trials, the distractors appeared together with the target (onset trials), and in\nthe other half of the trials, the distractors were presented together with the fixation cross,\nbut they were removed from the screen at the moment the target appeared (offset trials).\nThe number of distractors that could appear or disappear was equal to zero, one, two, or\n86 F Hermens, R Walker\nFigure 1.

In the onset condition, a fixation symbol, presented in isolation,\nwas followed by a predictable saccade target (the triangle on the left) and one, two, or three distractor\nstimuli (filled circles).

In the case of one or two appearing or disappearing distractors, the position of the\ndistractors was varied across conditions such that each position was occupied equally often.\nIn half of the trials, the target appeared on the left of fixation; in the other half, on the right of\nfixation. Each combination of trial type (onset, offset), number of appearing or disappearing\ndistractors (zero, one, two, or three), and target location (left, right) was presented three\ntimes per block. The order of the trial types and the number of appearing or disappearing\ndistractors was randomised. The direction of the target (left or right), however, was kept\nconstant during each half of the block. Each participant performed three blocks, resulting in\nnine repeated measurements per stimulus combination per participant.\nParticipants were tested individually. They were seated at a distance of 57 cm from the\ncomputer screen with their head position restrained by a combined forehead-and-chin rest.\nThey were instructed to look at the fixation cross in the centre of the screen until the onset of\nthe target (triangle) stimulus at a predefined location left or right of fixation.\nOnsets and offsets and saccade programming 87\nBefore each experimental block, the nine-point calibration procedure of the Eyelink II\nsystem was performed, in which participants were asked to fixate each of the calibration\ndots presented in sequence on the computer screen. The calibration was repeated until the\nrecorded eye positions were aligned to the three-by-three grid on which the calibration points\nwere presented. The three experimental blocks were preceded by a practice block of twelve\ntrials. In the first half of each block the target always appeared on one side of fixation (left or\nright), and in the other half of the block on the other side. The side on which the target was\ngoing to appear was indicated before each half of the block by a text message on the screen,\nafter which a drift correction was performed, in which participants looked at a centrally\npresented dot and pressed the spacebar of the computer keyboard to correct for influences\nof small head movements on the recorded eye position. Blocks (practice and experimental)\nwere separated by a short break. The experiment took about 20 mins to complete.\nTrials with first saccades in the opposite direction of the target, with a first saccade amplitude\nof less than 2 deg, of more than 8 deg (overshoots) and with a vertical deviation of more\nthan 2 deg were excluded from the data analysis as well as trials in which the first saccade\ncontained a blink and saccades with response times faster than 80 ms (anticipations) and\nslower than two times the standard deviation above the mean. These criteria led to the\nfor too slow response times, 5.10% for too short and 2.37% for too long saccade amplitudes;\ncategories not mutually exclusive). In only 2.49% of the trials, the saccade was excluded\nuniquely because it was in the wrong direction (either it was in the opposite direction or\nit deviated too much from the horizontal). Visual inspection showed that most of these\nsaccades were made by a small number of participants and that direction errors were mostly\ndue to the vertical component of the saccade being slightly above threshold. Moreover, if a\nsaccade was directed towards one of the remaining three directions (eg leftward, upward, or\ndownward, for a rightward target), only in about half of the cases (0.75% of all trials) it was\ntargeted at a distractor onset or offset, whereas in the other cases the direction seemed to be\nunrelated to stimulus presentation. This suggests that oculomotor capture occurred only\nsporadically.\nFigure 2 shows the saccadic latencies to the target as a function of the number of distractor\nonsets (green circles) and offsets (red diamonds). For onsets, longer latencies were found\nwhen one or more distractors were presented, compared with the no-distractor baseline\ncondition (number of distractors = 0). For offsets, no differences were found between the\nconditions.

These distributions were obtained by sliding a `window' of 100 ms\n88 F Hermens, R Walker\nFigure 2.

Error bars show the standard error of the mean across 12 participants.\nacross the time line in steps of 2 ms and by determining the average number of observed\nsaccades latencies within the window. In the middle two plots (figure 3b), the difference of the\ndistributions between the distractor conditions and the respective baseline conditions (no\ndistractor for onsets, all distractors remaining for offsets) is shown. For both distractor onsets\nand offsets, a reduction in the number of faster saccades (around 120\u00ad160 ms) appears to\noccur, indicated by the shift of the distribution towards higher values in the top two plots\nand the dip in the middle two plots of figure 3. Although both onset and offset distractors\nshow a shift towards longer latencies in the conditions with distractors, the inhibition of\nshort latency saccades appears to be much more pronounced for onsets than for offsets.\nThis observation is confirmed by an analysis of the Vincentiles (Ratcliff 1979), which were\ncomputed for each participant separately and then averaged. When the Vincentiles for the\nno-distractor and distractor conditions are compared (figure 3c), a clear shift towards higher\nvalues is found for distractor onsets, exceeding the size of the 95% confidence intervals\n(horizontal and vertical lines around the data points). For offsets, no such shift is observed.\n3 Discussion\nThe present results demonstrate that when the saccade target location is known in advance,\nan RDE for stimulus onsets occurs, resulting in a slower initiation of eye movements to\nthe target in the presence of a distractor, an effect that mainly affected the short latency\nsaccades (Buonocore and McIntosh 2008; Walker et al 1997). By contrast, peripheral offsets\ndid not increase or decrease latencies compared with the single target situation. Furthermore,\nsingle distractor onsets were equally disruptive to target-directed saccades as were multiple\ndistractors. Our results agree with earlier findings by Boot et al (2005), but are in contrast\nshowed that distractor offsets can influence saccadic latencies. They are also inconsistent\nwith the results by McSorley and Findlay (2003), who did find an effect of the number of\nOnsets and offsets and saccade programming 89\nFigure 3.

To align the distributions across participants, the individual mean response\ntime for each condition was subtracted from each of the response times in that condition for that\nparticipant. The data were then pooled across participants, and the overall mean across participants\nwas added to restore the original mean response time for each of the conditions. The response time\ndistributions were obtained by sliding a window (100 ms wide) across the time line and by counting\nthe number of saccade latencies within the window.

Our observations confirm the different roles of onsets and offsets and of\nirrelevant stimuli at fixation and those in the periphery for oculomotor preparation.\nThe present findings have implications for models of saccade target selection (eg Findlay\nand Walker 1999; Trappenberg et al 2001). Most models assume that possible saccade goals\nare represented in an oculomotor map, consisting of a layer of neurons each coding a possible\nsaccade target location. When a stimulus is presented, the location in the map associated with\na response to that location is activated, preparing the system for a saccade to the visual onset.\nThe intention to shift gaze to a particular target results in top-down enhancement of target-\nrelated activity and the inhibition of nontarget activity. Moreover, when multiple stimuli are\npresent, lateral inhibition operates between populations of neurons coding for competing\nsaccade goals to ensure that only one saccade goal is represented at the moment the decision\nis made to initiate a saccade. Although all models assume some sort of oculomotor map,\nthere are differences. For example, models differ in their assumptions on the dimensionality\nneurons (Trappenberg et al 2001; Ludwig et al 2007), or single neurons coding for target and\ndistractors, as in rise-to-threshold models (eg Carpenter and Williams 1995). They also differ\nin their assumption on what triggers the saccade, being either the saccade target neuron\net al 2007; Trappenberg et al 2001), or fixation-related activity dropping below threshold\n(Findlay and Walker 1999). Other differences include the extent of lateral inhibition between\nneurons (short-range or long-range), whether saccades are made to the maximum peak of\nactivation or a weighted average, and whether a winner-take-all criterion is applied.\nIt has been proposed that distractor onsets can exert an influence on saccade initiation\nin two ways (Cruickshank and McSorley 2009; Walker et al 1997). The first involves a\ndirect interaction between target-related and distractor-related activity operating via long-\nrange (intercollicular) interactions (Trappenberg et al 2001). The second possibility is that\ndistractors indirectly influence saccade initiation by influencing fixation activity, which then\ninfluences target activity, for which shorter range connections would suffice (Findlay and\nWalker 1999). For distractor onsets, evidence was obtained that the second process (involving\nfixation activity) dominates the influence of distractors on saccade latencies (Cruickshank\nand McSorley 2009; Walker et al 1997). Our results suggest that such processes are not evoked\nby stimulus offsets and are therefore unique to newly appearing stimuli.\nThe lack of an effect of remote distractor offsets can be understood as follows. The\ninitial onset of the stimulus array (containing distractors and a fixation point) results in the\nautomatic activation of neurons in the oculomotor map. However, activity at the distractor\nsites may be suppressed because of the instruction to maintain fixation rather than to saccade\ntowards one of the distractors. In this respect, remote offset distractors differ from those\npresented at fixation, as in the gap effect, for which activation can be assumed to have\nremained (in order to maintain fixation). When the target appears following the fixation\nforeperiod, activity at the distractor sites has been suppressed to baseline, and therefore a\nreduction of activity, as in the gap effect, is no longer possible. As a consequence, saccade\nlatencies will not be influenced by the offset of the remote distractors.\nAn alternative explanation involving top-down effects is also possible. Remote offsets\nmay result in a slower initiation of saccades towards the target only when the target is also\ndefined by an offset.(2) Such a prediction would be consistent with the contingent capture\nhypothesis, which states that capture of attention is contingent on the top-down settings of\n(1) The choice of a lower dimensionality of the map is mostly for practical purposes, ie to reduce the\ncomputational complexity of the simulations.\n(2) The authors thank Casimir Ludwig for suggesting this alternative explanation.\nOnsets and offsets and saccade programming 91\nthe observer [eg when the observer is looking for a red target, only red distractors will have an\neffect (for a review of such effects see Theeuwes et al 2010)]. Following this hypothesis, onset\ndistractors in our study had an effect because the target was defined as a stimulus onset. If it\ncould be demonstrated that remote offset distractors affect saccades to target offsets, while\nremote onsets do not influence such saccades, this would provide further support for the\nrole of top-down information in oculomotor programming (Born and Kerzel 2009).\nThe question remains why discrepancies have been found among the effects of distractor\noffsets in the different studies. The findings from the present RDE study and the oculomotor\ncapture study of Boot et al (2005) are similar in that offsets had no effect on saccade latencies.\nBy contrast, Ludwig et al (2008) reported similar effects of onsets and offsets. This difference\nin results between studies could relate to differences in the relative strengths of the target-\nrelated and distractor-related activity (see also Born and Kerzel 2008). In the current study,\ntargets were defined by a sudden onset, which might have provided a relatively strong signal\nin the oculomotor map. Moreover, target position was known in advance, which could have\nled to some advance activation at the site where the target was expected to appear. Similarly,\nBoot et al used a colour change to indicate the saccade target, which might have resulted in a\nstronger activation in the oculomotor map than the contrast changes used by Ludwig et al\n(2008), where distractor offsets mainly affected saccade planning when the target contrast\nchange was small. The relatively strong target signals in the present study and Boot et al\nmight have been immune to offsets, assuming that they have weaker effects than onsets. In\ncontrast, for weak contrast changes, the target signals in Ludwig et al could be influenced by\nthe offset signals. This explanation would also account for Boot et al's finding that partial\nonsets did not result in slower saccade latencies, possibly because the weak signals from the\npartial distractor onset were not able to compete with the strong signal from the target. Note,\nhowever, that this does not explain why Ludwig et al (2008) did not find any quantitative\ndifferences between the effects of distractor onset and offsets.\nThe difference between the present results and those by Todd and van Gelder (1979) and\nRolfs and Vitu (2007), who reported faster response times with distractor offsets, could be\nrelated to the choice aspect involved in the latter two studies. Because participants had to\ndecide at the moment the target was presented where to look (eg to the near or the far target),\ndistractor offsets might have aided the choice, because they removed stimuli that could\nhave been possible targets and therefore might have interfered with the selection process.\nMoreover, the choice aspect in these studies resulted in relatively long response times,\ncompared with those in the present study. A possibility is, therefore, that latency facilitation\neffects were not produced by offsets in the present study, simply because participants were\nalready making very fast responses, which could have excluded the possibility to respond\neven faster (ie a floor effect may have occurred). Furthermore, a warning effect from the\ndistractor offsets might have been absent because target and distractors were presented\nsimultaneously, leaving insufficient time to process the distractor offsets for them to act as a\ntemporal cue. Note, however, that such explanations are difficult to reconcile with the results\nby Ludwig et al (2008), who showed a general increase in response times due to distractor\noffsets.\nIn the present study the number of distractor onsets had no effect, in contrast with\nfindings from an earlier study by McSorley and Findlay (2003), who noted such an effect.\nThis difference suggests that the origin of the effect of number of distractors in McSorley\nand Findlay (2003) resides in the search task that participants performed, which required\na decision process to determine where the target was located. The present results suggest\nthat the automatic activation of the oculomotor map following the sudden appearance of\nmultiple distractors influences activity coding for the target to the same extent as for a single\n92 F Hermens, R Walker\ndistractor. The implication that the distractor effects are relatively immune to the distribution\nand strength of activity in the oculomotor map remote from the target and from fixation\nagrees with findings showing relatively weak effects of distractor contrast [Born and Kerzel\n(2008); however, see Bompas and Sumner (2009)] on the remote distractor effect as well as\nweak effects of the size and contrast of a distractor (Hermens and Walker forthcoming) on\nsaccade trajectories towards a peripheral target.\nThe effects of remote distractors on goal-directed saccade initiation may be related to\nanother inhibitory effect observed on saccade latency termed saccadic inhibition (Reingold\nand Stampe 2002, 2004). Studies of saccadic inhibition have shown that the onset of a visual\ndistractor results in the temporary suppression of saccades around 70\u00ad100 ms after distractor\nMoreover, the inhibitory influence of remote distractors and the saccadic inhibition effect\nhave both been related to inhibitory processes operating in oculomotor structures such as\nthe intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (Reingold and Stampe 2002; Walker et al\n1997). An examination of latency distributions for our data shows a similar reduction in the\nnumber of short latency saccades, although maximum inhibition of saccadic latencies seems\nto occur slightly later than in earlier studies (however, see Walker et al 1995). This reduction\nin the number of faster saccades appears to be present both for onsets and offsets, but is\nmuch more pronounced for onset distractors. Future work should establish whether the\nobserved reduction of fast saccadic latencies with offsets is genuine by testing offset and\nno-offset conditions across many trials for each participant.\nBecause the influence of distractor onsets and offsets was only tested for a simultaneous\npresentation of target and distractors, the possibility cannot be excluded that distractor\noffsets affect saccadic latencies at a different temporal interval than that optimal for distractor\nonsets (Walker et al 1997). Possibly, offsets need more time to be processed and therefore\nonly affect saccade target selection at a longer stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between\ntarget and distractor. Moreover, the SOA with strongest interference from the distractor(s) on\nthe target could vary across participants (Bompas and Sumner 2009). Similarly, increases\nin the number of distractor onsets could possibly have an effect if, simultaneously with the\nincrease in their number, the interval between the target and the distractor is increased.\nTherefore, to exclude the possibility that distractor offsets, and the number of onsets, have\nno influence on saccade initiation at any target-distractor onset asynchrony, a range of SOAs\nshould be tested. However, our results do show that peripheral onsets and offsets differ,\neither in their timing, or in their strength of interference, and that the effects of peripheral\noffsets are different from those of offsets that occur at central fixation.\nis a Postdoctoral Fellow of the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen) and member of a\nresearch group supported by a Methusalem grant by the Flemish Government (METH/08/02).\nReferences\nArai K, Keller E L, 2005 \"A model of the saccade-generating system that accounts for trajectory varia-\nBompas A, Sumner P, 2009 \"Temporal dynamics of saccadic distraction\" Journal of Vision 9 1\u00ad14\nBoot W R, Kramer A F, Peterson M S, 2005 \"Oculomotor consequences of abrupt object onsets and\noffsets: Onsets dominate oculomotor capture\" Perception and Psychophysics 67 910\u00ad928\nBorn S, Kerzel D, 2008 \"Influence of target and distractor contrast on the remote distractor effect\"\nOnsets and offsets and saccade programming 93\nBorn S, Kerzel D, 2009 \"Congruency effects in the remote distractor paradigm: Evidence for top-\nBraun D, Breitmeyer B G, 1988 \"Relationship between directed visual attention and saccadic reac-\nBuonocore A, McIntosh R D, 2008 \"Saccadic inhibition underlies the remote distractor effect\" Exper-\nCarpenter R H S, Williams M L L, 1995 \"Neural computation of log likelihood in the control of\nCruickshank A G, McSorley E, 2009 \"Involuntary inhibition of movement initiation alters oculomo-\nDorris M C, Olivier E, Munoz D P, 2007 \"Competitive integration of visual and preparatory signals\nEdelman J A, Xu K Z, 2009 \"The inhibition of voluntary saccadic eye movement commands by abrupt\nFindlay J M, Walker R, 1999 \"A model of saccade generation based on parallel processing and\nFischer B, Boch R, 1983 \"Saccadic eye movements after extremely short reaction times in the\nFischer B, Weber H, 1993 \"Express Saccades and Visual Attention\" Behavioral and Brain Sciences 16\nGandhi N J, Keller E L, 1999 \"Comparison of saccades perturbed by stimulation of the rostral\nsuperior colliculus, the caudal superior colliculus, and the omnipause region\" Journal of Neu-\nGodijn R, Theeuwes J, 2002 \"Programming of exogenous and endogenous saccades: Evidence for a\ncompetitive integration model\" Journal of Experimental Psychology Human Perception & Perfor-\nGodijn R, Theeuwes J, 2004 \"The relationship between inhibition of return and saccade trajectory\ndeviations\" Journal of Experimental Psychology Human Perception & Performance 30 538\u00ad554\nHermens F, Walker R, forthcoming \"Gaze and arrow distractors influence saccade trajectories simi-\nlarly\" Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology\nLudwig C J H, Mildinhall J W, Gilchrist I D, 2007 \"A population coding account for systematic varia-\nLudwig C J H, Ranson A, Gilchrist I D, 2008 \"Oculomotor capture by transient events: A comparison\nMayfrank L, Mobashery M, Kimmig H, Fischer B, 1986 \"The role of fixation and visual attention in\nthe occurrence of express saccades in man\" European Archives of Psychiatry and Neurological\nMcSorley E, Findlay J M, 2003 \"Saccade target selection in visual search.
