As such, neighborhoods are where the nation's\nracial and economic cleavages are most visibly \"etched in place\" (Sampson 2012:19).\nNeighborhood conditions historically have been particularly harsh for African\nAmericans, a legacy of disadvantage that continues today as black-white inequality\nin neighborhood conditions notably exceeds black-white economic inequality at the\nindividual or household level (Logan 2002, 2011). Rapid growth in Hispanic and Asian\nmetropolitan populations--fueled by a combination of immigration, youthful age\nstructures, and natural increase--has only intensified interest in neighborhood inequal-\nity. Our objective in this study is to investigate change since 1980 in the relative\neconomic qualities of the neighborhoods where America's four major racial/ethnic\ngroups--Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians--live.\nBy examining change in racial inequality at the neighborhood level, this study fills\nan important gap in our knowledge about racial stratification in America. Despite broad\nconsensus among social scientists that inequality in neighborhood environments pro-\nduces inequality of opportunity for members of different racial and ethnic groups, we\nhave surprisingly little quantitative evidence on how fast racial neighborhood\ninequality has been changing in the United States, and why. Only a few studies,\nsuch as Timberlake (2002), have examined change in the distribution of racial\ngroups across all types of metropolitan neighborhoods (not just poor neighbor-\nhoods), and none of these studies have used the most statistically appropriate\nindexes of inequality, as we explain subsequently.\nIn this article, we describe change in racial neighborhood inequality in American\nmetropolitan areas since 1980, the first year for which we have adequate census data for\nHispanics. Our findings are based on a standard measure of inequality, the Gini index.\nBecause the trends we uncover have gone largely unnoticed--and in some instances\nare contrary to conventional wisdom--we focus first on describing the contours of the\nchange in racial neighborhood inequality. Our aim in the first part of this article is to\npresent the most complete picture to date of change in the relative neighborhood\nenvironments of whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians over the past three\ndecades in America. Then in the second part of this article we report findings\nfrom metropolitan fixed-effects regression models designed to account for the\nchange we observe. Why has racial neighborhood inequality declined faster in\nsome metropolitan areas than in others?\nRacial Neighborhood Inequality: What It Is and Why It Matters\nBy racial neighborhood inequality, we mean economic inequality: that is, disparity in\nthe poverty rates and average incomes of the neighborhoods where different racial and\n1 The four groups accounted for more than 97 % of the U.S. population in 2010. Although the term \"Hispanic\"\nis most often considered an ethnic designation, for simplicity we refer to whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians\nas racial groups. \"Asian\" includes Pacific Islanders. The excluded populations are non-Hispanics who\nindicated that they are of more than one race (1.9 % of the U.S. population in 2010), American Indian or\nAlaska natives (0.7 %), and non-Hispanics who indicated \"some other race\" (0.2 %).\nG. Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell\nethnic groups live, reflecting the fact that racial and ethnic groups are unevenly\ndistributed across rich and poor neighborhoods. In America, racial differences in\nhousehold income account for only part of this disparity; many middle-class blacks,\nfor example, reside in poor neighborhoods or in places surrounded by poor neighbor-\nracial inequality at the neighborhood level from racial differences in poverty and\nincome at the individual or household level.\nIt is also important to distinguish racial neighborhood inequality from racial\nresidential segregation. Residential segregation refers to unevenness in the\ndistribution of groups across neighborhoods. Although racial neighborhood\ninequality requires residential segregation--that is, racial groups can be uneven-\nly distributed across rich and poor neighborhoods only if groups are unevenly\ndistributed across neighborhoods--segregation does not preordain inequality.\nBecause studies of residential segregation show only that racial neighborhood\ninequality is possible--and not how large it is--the extensive literature on\nresidential segregation alone is insufficient to draw conclusions about trends\nin racial neighborhood inequality. As Alba et al. (2008:14) noted, \"While\nsegregation indices can inform us about the extent to which members of\ndifferent groups live in different neighborhoods, they cannot tell us directly\nabout the `qualities' of the neighborhoods in which group members reside.\" If\nwe agree that segregation matters largely because it contributes to the relative\nadvantages and disadvantages of racial and ethnic groups (Cutler and Glaeser\ninsufficient. The crucial issue is racial differences in living conditions and life\nchances, not residential segregation per se.\nRacial neighborhood inequality is particularly critical in America because\npoorer neighborhoods typically have significantly poorer social services,\nschools, and social environments, as well as less green space, higher crime\nrates, and more noise and congestion (Reardon and Bischoff 2011; Sampson\net al. 1999). In terms of day-to-day existence, then, racial neighborhood in-\nequality implies a lower quality of life for the average minority versus the\naverage white, which might be one reason that African Americans in the United\nStates report lower levels of happiness (Firebaugh and Schroeder 2009; Yang\n2008). In addition, recent evidence suggests that prolonged exposure to poor\nneighborhood environments adversely affects one's life chances along several\npoverty environments encourage youth to pursue criminal careers. We should be\nconcerned about racial neighborhood inequality, then, because it is consequen-\ntial for the future as well as the present, serving as a wellspring for racial\ndisparities in life chances now and in the days to come (Harding 2003;\nThe present study is particularly timely because racial neighborhood inequal-\nity in America--although much discussed--rarely is measured directly.\nConsequently, we have much evidence that minorities live in poorer neighbor-\nhoods in America but relatively imprecise estimates of the degree of the\ninequality, and even less precise estimates of how it has been changing.\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nEvidence Bearing on Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nMany studies have documented the overrepresentation of minorities in poor neighbor-\nand Denton 1993). Supporting evidence comes from different disciplines and starting\npoints. Research by urban planners and health policy researchers has found unevenness\nin the \"geography of opportunity\" of different racial and ethnic groups with respect to\nhousing choice (de Souza Briggs 2005; Osypuk et al. 2009). Research by sociologists\nand other social scientists focusing on locational attainment (Alba and Logan 1991;\npoverty in urban areas (de Souza Briggs and Keys 2009; Quillian 2003; Timberlake\n2007; Timberlake and Iceland 2007) has also pointed to racial disparities in neighbor-\nhood environments.\nDespite the enormity of this literature, we found only three studies (Osypuk et al.\nhood inequality directly. Osypuk et al. (2009) found that racial neighborhood inequality\nis positively associated with residential segregation across the 100 largest U.S. metro-\npolitan areas in 2000. Timberlake (2002) found much lower neighborhood inequality\nfor Asians versus whites than for Hispanics versus whites or for blacks versus whites.\nIn a follow-up study, Timberlake and Iceland (2007) found that although blacks\nremained the most residentially disadvantaged group in 2000, they exhibited the\nHowever, none of these pioneering studies employed a standard measure of inequal-\nity. At a minimum, we want a measure of inequality that meets the usual requirements\nfor inequality indexes (Allison 1978): the measure should be scale invariant, yielding\nthe same value whether income units are given in dollars or in any other currency;\nshould obey the principle of transfers so that transfers of income from richer to poorer\nunits reduce the index, and transfers in the other direction increase the index; and\nshould be compositionally invariant, meaning that the measure is not sensitive to\nchanges in the relative sizes of groups--this property is important in the current study\nbecause of the rapidly changing racial composition of many areas in America (Lee et al.\n2014). We also want an index that can measure segregation as well as inequality,\npermitting a transparent estimate of the effect of racial residential segregation on racial\nneighborhood inequality in our regression analyses. Finally, we want a measure that is\ncommonly used so that we can easily compare racial neighborhood inequality\nwith other types of inequality. The Gini index is the natural choice because it is\ncommonly used, is scale invariant, obeys the principle of transfers, has proper-\nties that are well established, is compositionally invariant (Reardon and\nFirebaugh 2002), and measures segregation as well as inequality (Duncan and\nand using a regression model to determine the predictors of racial neighborhood inequality in 2000 and its\nG.

The inequality measures used in prior studies fail\nto satisfy all these criteria (see the appendix).\nData\nUsing decennial census counts, we assess the residential circumstances of the four\nprincipal racial/ethnic groups in America: (1) non-Hispanic whites, (2) non-Hispanic\nblacks, (3) non-Hispanic Asians and Pacific Islanders, and (4) Hispanics of any race.\nRecent decades have seen momentous change in the composition of the U.S. popula-\nto 16.3 % of the U.S. population, and Asians increased from 1.5 % to 4.8 % (Gibson\nmuch less is known about what shifts have occurred in the economic environments\nwhere whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians live.\nWe use census-defined tracts as our measure of neighborhoods.

These tract data\ncome from the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (Logan et al. 2014) and a GeoLytics\ndatabase that provides estimates for untracted areas in 1980 (GeoLytics 2004). We\ninclude all metropolitan areas in the United States, thus capturing 77 % of the total U.S.\n3 To ensure that the trends we observe are based\non a consistent set of boundaries, we standardize the pre-2010 census tracts to 2010\nboundaries. We exclude tracts where more than 25 % of the residents live in group\nquarters (e.g., prisons), yielding a consistent set of 57,370 neighborhoods for each year.\nTo test the robustness of our results, we repeated our analyses using 2000 census tract\nboundaries (from GeoLytics 2004, 2011a, b). Our conclusions are the same whether we\nuse the 2000 or 2010 boundaries, as well as whether we include or exclude the areas\nTo calculate racial neighborhood inequality, we need to know both the racial\ncomposition of neighborhoods and their economic conditions.

We use the OMB\nDecember 2009 update of metropolitan definitions: http://www.census.gov/population/metro/files/lists/2009/\nList1.txt.\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nand upper incomes as well. Thus, by comparing results for the two measures, we can\ndetermine whether racial differences in neighborhood environments are greater at the\nlower end of the income distribution or at the middle and upper ends of the distribution.\nNote also that the ACS data set we use to measure neighborhood poverty rate and\nour findings include the effects of the 2008 Great Recession on racial neighborhood\ninequality in America.\nFigure 1 (poverty-based inequality) and Fig. 2 (income-based inequality) display\ndifferences in the distributions of whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian\nAmericans across rich and poor neighborhoods in metropolitan America by depicting\nhow much better off, or worse off, a group's neighborhood conditions are compared\nwith metropolitan residents who are not members of the group (the nonfocal popula-\ntion). If whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians were distributed proportionately over\nrich and poor neighborhoods, all four groups would lie on the line of equality in the\ngraphs: that is, 10 % of each group would reside in the bottom 10 % of neighborhoods,\n20 % of each group would reside in the bottom 20 % of neighborhoods, and so on. That\nis not what we find. In 1980 and in 2010, the curves for whites were well above the line\nof equality, reflecting whites' greater concentration in richer-than-average neighbor-\nhoods; the curves for blacks and Hispanics, on the other hand, were well below the line,\nreflecting the greater concentration of blacks and Hispanics in poorer-than-average\nneighborhoods. In Fig. 1, the curve for Asians closely hugs the line of equality in 1980,\nindicating that Asians were the most typical Americans in 1980 in terms of the poverty\nrates of the neighborhoods where they resided. The curve for Asians lies above the line\nof equality in 2010, indicating that by 2010 Asians tended to live in neighborhoods\nwith lower-than-average poverty rates.\nThe greater the difference between the curves and the 45-degree line of equality, the\ngreater the degree of racial neighborhood inequality. Clearly, whites tend to live in more\neconomically advantaged neighborhoods than African Americans and Hispanics.\nFigures 1 and 2 nonetheless reveal a substantial narrowing of the racial neighborhood\ndisparities since 1980. For both poverty-based and income-based neighborhood in-\nequality, the curves for whites, blacks, and Hispanics were notably closer to the line of\nmetropolitan census tracts from poorest to richest and calculated the cumulative percentage of our four focal\npopulations (whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians) and their complements (e.g., nonwhites) across the tracts.\nThen we plotted the results in a graph where the x-axis is cumulative percentage of the focal group (e.g.,\nwhites) and the y-axis is the cumulative percentage of the remainder of the metropolitan population, the non-\nfocal population (e.g., nonwhites). In Fig. 1, then, the point (50, 8) on the curve for blacks in 1980 tells us that\nonly 8 % of nonblacks lived in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was as high as, or higher than, it was in\nthe average (50th percentile) neighborhood where blacks lived in 1980. Thus 92 % of nonblack Americans\nlived in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was lower than in the average neighborhood where\nblacks lived. Likewise, the point (9, 50) on the curve for whites tells us that only 9 % of whites lived\nwhere the poverty rate was as high as, or higher than, it was in the average neighborhood where\nnonwhites lived, so 91 % of whites lived where poverty was lower than in the average neighborhood\nwhere nonwhites lived. In short, the racial disparities in neighborhood conditions in 1980 were huge.\nG. Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell\nto the line of equality represents reduction in relative neighborhood disadvan-\ntage. For whites, convergence to the line of equality represents reduction in\nrelative neighborhood advantage. The neighborhoods where blacks and whites\nlive and where Hispanics and whites live have become more alike economically\nAsians also are converging with whites, but the details differ. Rather than residing in\ntypical American neighborhoods, as they did in 1980, Asian Americans now live in\nwealthier-than-average neighborhoods that are more similar to whites' neighborhoods,\nparticularly with respect to median household income. Thus instead of converging\ntoward the line of equality, as is the case for the black and Hispanic curves, the Asian\ncurve has expanded above the line, indicating an increase in residential advantage for\nAsians relative to other Americans.\nShare of Nonfocal Population (%)\nShare of Focal Population (%)\nWhite\nAsian\nHispanic\nBlack\nPoorest tracts Richest tracts\nShare of Nonfocal Population (%)\nShare of Focal Population (%)\nWhite\nAsian\nHispanic\nBlack\nRichest tracts\nPoorest tracts\nFig. 1 Narrowing of poverty-based racial neighborhood inequality in the United States, 1980\u00ad2010\nShare of Nonfocal Population (%)\nShare of Focal Population (%)\nWhite\nAsian\nHispanic\nBlack\nShare of Nonfocal Population (%)\nShare of Focal Population (%)\nWhite\nAsian\nHispanic\nBlack\nPoorest tracts Richest tracts Poorest tracts Richest tracts\nFig. 2 Narrowing of income-based racial neighborhood inequality in the United States, 1980\u00ad2010\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nIn short, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans all gained on whites\nfrom 1980 to 2010, so change in racial neighborhood inequality over that period is a\nstory of declining white relative advantage. The proximate causes are improved\nneighborhood conditions for blacks along with greater deterioration in neigh-\nborhood conditions for whites than for Hispanics and Asians. In 1980, one-half\nof blacks lived in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was greater than 21.8\n%, and the other half where the rate was less than 21.8 % (Fig. 3). Contrast\nthis with the situation for whites in 1980, when one-half lived in neighborhoods\nwhere the poverty rate was less than 6.9 %. The black-white difference\nincreasing to 8.6 % for whites and declining to 18.9 % for blacks. Although\nthe difference that remains is pronounced, the point we want to underscore here\nis that the reduction in black-white neighborhood inequality is due both to\nhigher poverty rates in the neighborhoods where whites live and to lower rates\nin the neighborhoods where blacks live.\nThe average neighborhood where Hispanics live had a higher poverty rate in\nwhites (13 % vs. 25 % for whites), resulting in a modest reduction in Hispanic-\nwhite neighborhood inequality. Median neighborhood poverty rate increased\nthat by 2010 the median poverty rate was about the same in the neighborhoods\nof Asians and of whites (Fig. 3).\nWhen Did the Narrowing Occur?\nAs Fig. 3 suggests, the narrowing of racial neighborhood inequality in America\nneighborhood conditions improved for blacks and deteriorated faster for whites\nthan for Hispanics and Asians.

Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell\n5 Figure 4 shows that the difference between Asians and whites,\nwhich was modest in 1980, had largely disappeared by 2010. In the remainder of this\narticle, then, we focus on disparities for African Americans and Hispanics.\nFigure 4 reveals five critical facts about black-white and Hispanic-white neighbor-\nhood inequality in America. First, the degree of neighborhood inequality in 1980 was\nsevere, especially for blacks (the black-white Gini was .69 based on poverty and .62\nbased on income).6 Second, black-white neighborhood inequality showed a sizable\ninequality declined by nearly 40 %, and income-based neighborhood inequality de-\nclined by nearly 30 %, in the average metropolitan area over the period.\nThird, for both blacks and Hispanics, poverty-based neighborhood inequality de-\nclined more than income-based inequality, indicating that the disparities in neighbor-\nhood conditions for blacks and Hispanics vis-\u00e0-vis whites narrowed more in terms of\npoverty rate than in terms of average neighborhood income. Apparently, convergence\nin the distribution of racial groups across poorer and richer neighborhoods was more\npronounced at the lower end of the neighborhood income continuum.\nFourth, black-white neighborhood inequality declined much faster than Hispanic-\nwhite inequality. For both poverty-based and income-based neighborhood inequality,\nthe Gini coefficients in 1980 were one-third greater for blacks and whites than for\n5 The Gini coefficient is a function of the area between the group curves and the line of equality (Gini 1912,\n1921). Gini coefficients range from 0 to 1 in absolute value, with a value of 0 indicating no difference in the\neconomic conditions of neighborhoods for the groups being compared, and a value of 1 indicating that all\nmembers of the advantaged group live in richer neighborhoods than all members of the disadvantaged group\n(complete neighborhood inequality). The Gini values in Fig. 4 are weighted by size of the minority population\nso that metropolitan areas with larger minority populations are given more weight.\nBlack-White\nPoverty RNI\nBlack-White\nIncome RNI\nHispanic-White Hispanic-White\nPoverty RNI Income RNI\nAsian-White\nPoverty RNI\nAsian-White\nIncome RNI\nGini Value\nFig. 4 Change in black-white, Hispanic-white, and Asian-white neighborhood inequality in the average U.S.\n6 As a point of reference, the estimated Gini values for income inequality in the United States are .51 for pretax\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nHispanics and whites. By 2010, black-white and Hispanic-white neighborhood inequal-\nity was virtually the same when we average the metro-level Gini values. This does not\nnecessarily mean that Hispanics reside in neighborhoods as poor as those where blacks\nreside given that the comparison here is between blacks and whites who live in the\nsame area with Hispanics and whites who live in the same metropolitan area, and\nHispanics might be concentrated in metropolitan areas where whites tend to be more\naffluent than in the metropolitan areas where blacks live. When we adjust for regional\ndifferences in the affluence of whites by ignoring metropolitan boundaries, we find that,\nas of 2010, blacks still lived in poorer neighborhoods than Hispanics, but the differ-\nences are small (Fig. 5). Importantly, then, black-Hispanic neighborhood disparities\nhave narrowed greatly since 1980. If these trends continue, Hispanics will reside in\npoorer neighborhoods than African Americans in the near future.\nFinally, Fig. 4 shows that racial neighborhood inequality declined the most during\nthe 1980s and the 2000s. This is true for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian\nAmericans. The narrowing of racial neighborhood inequality during the 2000s, the\ndecade that included the Great Recession, is attributable largely to a near-doubling of\nthe number of whites living in \"poverty areas\" (i.e., census tracts with poverty rates\npercentage of poor whites living in poverty areas jumped from about 25 % to about 38 %.\nAs a result, the number of whites living in poverty areas grew from 3.8 million to 7.5\nmillion (Bishaw 2014). Because the percentage of poor nonwhites living in poverty areas\n7 The decline is not due to measurement error in the ACS data for 2010. Our cross checks of similar data in the\nACS and decennial census data revealed virtually identical results. For example, the decennial census and the\nACS both collected data on homeownership at the tract level, and the Gini for black versus nonblack\nownership across tracts was .312 based on the decennial census and .310 based on ACS data.\nShare of Hispanic Population (%)\nShare of Black Population (%)\nPoverty\nIncome\nPoorest tracts Richest tracts\nFig. 5 Lorenz curves showing little difference in the poverty rates and median incomes of the neighborhoods\nwhere Hispanics and blacks live\nG. Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell\nincreased much less over this period (Bishaw 2014), the residents of high poverty areas\nThe increasing racial diversity of poor areas--poor whites living with poor minori-\nties--is notable in light of recent evidence of a growing income divide among America's\nneighborhoods (Massey et al. 2009; Reardon and Bischoff 2011). Perhaps the reduction\nin racial neighborhood inequality has been driven partly by the increasing economic\nsegregation of America's neighborhoods as middle-income blacks and Hispanics are\nless likely, and poor whites are more likely, to live in poor neighborhoods. To investigate\nthis idea, among others, we regress our measures of racial neighborhood inequality at the\nmetropolitan level on metropolitan characteristics that are likely to be associated with an\narea's level of inequality. We now describe the model we use.\nAccounting for the Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nThe Three Pillars of Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nTo reveal the characteristics of metropolitan areas that are associated with the greater\ndecline in some metropolitan areas than in others, we perform a series of regression\nbegin by noting that racial neighborhood inequality in America rests on three pillars. The\nfirst pillar is difference in the racial composition of neighborhoods: racial residential\nsegregation. The second pillar is difference in the average incomes in neighborhoods:\nneighborhood income segregation. Racial neighborhood economic inequality would be\nimpossible if all neighborhoods were the same economically. The third pillar is racial\nincome inequality at the household level. Blacks and Hispanics live in poorer neighbor-\nhoods in part because of their lower incomes (Clark 1986; Firebaugh and Farrell 2011).\nWe theorize that racial neighborhood inequality has changed because of change in\neach of the three pillars. Residential segregation has declined, although much faster for\nblacks and whites than for Hispanics and whites, which could account for the faster\ndecline in black-white neighborhood inequality than in Hispanic-white neighborhood\ninequality. Racial income inequality was U-shaped over this period, with census\ndata showing that median household income grew faster for Hispanics and\nHispanics and blacks than for whites from 2000 to 2010. This U-shaped pattern in\nrelative incomes for the United States as a whole masks differences across metropolitan\nareas, and we expect to find that racial neighborhood inequality declined faster in areas\nwhere minorities gained on whites economically than in areas where they did not.\nThe effect of change in neighborhood income segregation is harder to predict\nbecause of the possibility of compensating effects. After differences in household\nincome are adjusted for, blacks and Hispanics tend to live in much poorer neighbor-\nhoods than whites. Sharkey (2014) found, for example, that the average black house-\nhold with annual earnings of $100,000 lives in a more disadvantaged neighborhood\nand Ovadia 2009). Thus, in tightening the link between household income and\nneighborhood income, rising income segregation could \"squeeze out\" some of the\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nneighborhood underplacement of minorities and overplacement of whites by reducing\nthe proportion of middle-class blacks and Hispanics in poor neighborhoods and\nincreasing the proportion of poor whites in poor neighborhoods.8 On the other hand,\nto the extent that rising income segregation is due to widening differences in average\nincomes across neighborhoods as opposed to narrowing income variance within\nneighborhoods, growing income segregation might increase racial neighborhood\ninequality by magnifying the effect of the income advantage of whites. If the two\neffects are offsetting, rising neighborhood income segregation might have little net\neffect on racial neighborhood inequality.\nIn short, we predict that racial neighborhood inequality declined the most in\nmetropolitan areas where residential segregation declined the most and where minor-\nities gained the most on whites economically. We speculate that the effect of change in\nincome segregation will be modest because of the (possibly) opposing effects of\ndeclining within-neighborhood and increasing between-neighborhood income vari-\nance. To test these predictions, we estimated the following fixed-effects model for\ndenote metropolitan area and time, respectively:\n\u00bc \n\u00fe \nResSegjt\n\u00fe \nEconDisadvjt\n\u00fe \nIncomeSegjt\n\u00fe Yeart\n\u00fe Sizejt\n\u00fe Metroj\n\u00fe\nX\nk\n\nk\nZ jtk\n\u00fe jt\nEquation (1) is designed to test our central idea that racial neighborhood inequality is\nrooted in racial segregation, racial inequality, and neighborhood income segregation. The\nequation states that racial neighborhood inequality (RNI) for a given metropolitan area is\ndetermined by the three pillars of racial neighborhood inequality--level of racial residen-\ntial segregation, degree of minorities' economic disadvantage, and income segregation of\nthe area's neighborhoods--as well as by other economic and demographic features of the\narea. The year dummy variables (Year) capture secular trends that are not accounted for by\nother variables in the model, and Size (measured by log of population) captures the effect\nof unaccounted-for differences between larger and smaller metropolitan areas.\nBy using a metropolitan fixed-effects model (Metroj\n), we eliminate the confounding\neffects of stable unmeasured characteristics of metropolitan areas that have constant\neffects over time (Allison 2005). These include potentially important confounders--\nsuch as topography, culture, and region of the country--that vary from area to area but\nare stable (or relatively so) over time. To control for pertinent characteristics that change\nover time, the Z term includes census measures of an area's economic and demographic\ncharacteristics (e.g., overall poverty rate, proportion foreign-born). Because it is reason-\nable to assume that neighborhood change is more likely where many people are moving\nin or out and where new neighborhoods are sprouting up, we include variables designed\nto capture change in population composition or in housing stock (e.g., rate of new\n8 Quillian (2012) found that concentrated poverty among blacks and Hispanics in America is due largely to the\npoverty of their other-race neighbors: for example, middle-class blacks living beside poor nonblacks.

We measure both using the Gini\nindex.\n9 We use the minority/white poverty ratio to measure degree of minority economic\ndisadvantage in our models of poverty-based racial neighborhood inequality and the ratio\nof white/minority average household income10 to measure minority disadvantage in our\nmodels of income-based racial neighborhood inequality. For both ratios, higher values\nindicate greater economic disadvantage for the minority group, implying a positive\ncoefficient given that we expect racial neighborhood inequality to be the greatest in areas\nwhere minorities are the most greatly disadvantaged.

Controlling for\npopulation size nonetheless does not solve the issue of whether, for areas with the\nsame total population, analyses of racial neighborhood inequality should give more\nweight to the area with more minority residents. Our solution is to compare results for\nalternative weighting schemes: (a) all 366 metropolitan areas, not weighted by the\nminority group of interest; (b) same as (a), but restricted to areas where the minority\npopulation of interest exceeds 10,000; and (c) all areas, weighted by size of the\nminority group of interest. We report results for each of the weighting schemes.\nFindings\nTable 1 presents the estimated effects of the three pillar variables and population size,\nwith and without the control variables. The findings are clear. Change in black-white\nand Hispanic-white neighborhood inequality from 1980 to 2010 was driven by change\nin residential segregation and by change in minority economic disadvantage. The effect\nof residential segregation is especially large, with regression coefficients approaching\nor exceeding 1.0. Because segregation and inequality are both measured in Gini units,\nthis result indicates that a decline in racial neighborhood segregation is associated with\na commensurate decline in racial neighborhood inequality. Also noteworthy is that the\neffects are as large for Hispanics as they are for African Americans.\n9 We use Duncan and Duncan's (1955) formula for calculating the Gini based on the difference in two\ncumulative distributions. For residential income segregation, we calculate the Gini from the cumulative\ndistributions of population and income across the 57,370 neighborhoods, where the neighborhoods are\narranged from poorest to richest on the basis of median income. In the case of residential segregation from\nwhites, we order neighborhoods on the basis of minority composition (e.g., from neighborhoods with highest\n% black to those with lowest % black), and calculate the Gini from the cumulative distribution of the minority\ngroup across the neighborhoods compared with the cumulative distribution of whites across the\nneighborhoods.\n10 We substitute family income for household income in 1980 because household income was not broken\ndown by race in the 1980 census.

The N > 10,000 analysis is restricted to areas where the relevant\nminority population was greater than 10,000 (for at least two of the four census years, because metropolitan fixed-\neffects estimates are based on change within metropolitan areas). Racial neighborhood inequality, residential\nsegregation, and neighborhood income segregation are measured using the Gini index. Minority economic\ndisadvantage is measured as the minority/white ratio of poverty rates in the case of poverty-based neighborhood\ninequality and as the white/minority ratio of average incomes in the case of income-based neighborhood inequality.\na Random-effects estimation yields similar results.\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nThe findings are also very robust. The coefficients for residential segregation and\nminority economic disadvantage change very little when we add control variables,\nindicating that the observed effects of changing residential segregation and changing\nminority disadvantage are not attributable to their correlations with changes in other\nmetropolitan characteristics. Moreover, we find consistent results for residential segre-\ngation and minority disadvantage whether or not we weight areas by size of minority\npopulation: all 24 of the coefficients for residential segregation, and 21 of the 24\ncoefficients for minority disadvantage, are positive and statistically significant.\nAs predicted, then, racial neighborhood inequality has declined with declining racial\nsegregation and with declining economic disadvantage for minority populations. With\nregard to residential income segregation--the theorized third pillar of racial neighbor-\nhood inequality--the coefficients are either positive or not statistically significant.\nThus, we find no evidence for the \"squeeze hypothesis\" that rising income segregation\nin the United States has depressed racial neighborhood inequality by elevating the\nimportance of income, and reducing the importance of race, as the basis for sorting\nhouseholds into neighborhoods.\nFinally, it is noteworthy that a relatively simple model--the three pillar variables,\npopulation size, and dummy variables for year--does a good job of explaining why racial\nneighborhood inequality changed more in some metropolitan areas than in others.\n(Random-effects estimation (not shown) yields even stronger results.) The 14 control\nvariables do not add much to the explained variance, nor do they materially affect the\nestimates for residential segregation and minority disadvantage, as we have noted. Our\nresults for the control variables (see Table 2 in the appendix) indicate that, all other things\nbeing equal, poverty-based black-white neighborhood inequality diminished when pro-\nportion poor declined and when proportion Hispanic and proportion foreign-born grew. In\nthe case of income-based black-white neighborhood inequality, only two control vari-\nables--proportion foreign-born and unemployment rate--had significant effects. For\nHispanics, both poverty-based and income-based neighborhood inequality with whites\ntended to be reduced by growth in proportion homeowners and in proportion elderly and\nby reductions in average income, proportion black, and proportion suburban (other things\nbeing equal). In addition, poverty-based (but not income-based) Hispanic-white neigh-\nborhood inequality was affected by change in an area's poverty rate, proportion Hispanic,\nand proportion foreign-born (see Table 2 in the appendix for complete results).\nLimitations\nWe began this study by examining trends in racial neighborhood inequality for all 366\nU.S. metropolitan areas. We found that from 1980 to 2010, black-white neighborhood\ninequality declined much faster than Hispanic-white or Asian-white neighborhood\ninequality. Because neighborhood segregation also declined faster for blacks and whites\nthan for the other dyads, this finding suggests that change in residential segregation\nplayed an important role in reducing racial neighborhood inequality. Our regression\nresults indeed confirm a strong link between segregation and inequality. For both black-\nwhite inequality and Hispanic-white inequality, declines in segregation within a metro-\npolitan area were associated with comparable declines in neighborhood inequality.\nAlthough our findings reveal important new information about racial neighborhood\ninequality in America, there are limitations to what our data and model can investigate.\nG. Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell\nIn particular, by focusing on change in segregation and inequality within metropolitan\nareas, our fixed-effects analysis does not address the question of how migration across\nregions and metropolitan areas has affected racial neighborhood inequality for the\nnation as a whole--an important issue in light of the \"new faces in new places\"\n2013). From the fixed-effects regressions, we observe a virtual one-to-one correspon-\ndence (in Gini units) between change in segregation and change in inequality within\nmetropolitan areas. For metropolitan America as whole, however, the decline in Gini\ninequality exceeded the decline in Gini segregation. Presumably this is due, at least in\npart, to migration patterns across regions and metropolitan areas. We leave that question\nfor future research.\nMoreover, with tract-level data, we cannot directly examine change in the race-\nspecific association between household socioeconomic status (SES) and neighborhood\neconomic conditions. Because blacks and Hispanics very often live in much poorer\nneighborhoods than whites and Asians with similar incomes, we might expect racial\nneighborhood inequality to diminish as income becomes more decisive in determining\none's neighborhood. Yet we find no evidence that rising income segregation has reduced\nracial neighborhood inequality net of residential segregation and other neighborhood\ncharacteristics. If the growing income segregation of neighborhoods in America has\nnarrowed income differences within neighborhoods--so that neighbors tend to be more\nsimilar in terms of income--then this narrowing apparently either has not materially\nboosted the proportion of affluent blacks and Hispanics in affluent neighborhoods or of\npoor whites and Asians in poor neighborhoods, or its effect has been muted by other\nconsequences of rising income segregation. A full account of how rising income\nsegregation affects racial neighborhood inequality must await more targeted investiga-\ntions of the issue based on merged household- and neighborhood-level data.\nDiscussion\nA long-standing feature of American society is that whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians\ntend to live in different residential areas. Because this separation of groups remains high\nand is thought to have harmful consequences for minorities, residential segregation has\nbeen the subject of much research. However, separate is not necessarily unequal, and it is\nracial inequality in neighborhood environments, and the consequences of that inequality,\nthat we should ultimately be most concerned about. It is well established that residence in a\npoor neighborhood is associated with heightened exposure to various social ills (such as\ncrime) and reduced access to resources and services (such as good medical facilities and\nschools). As a result, racial inequality at the neighborhood level likely serves as the origin\nof many other types of racial disparities in American society by limiting the access of\ndisadvantaged minorities to jobs, education, healthcare, and beneficial social networks.\nAlthough concerns about racial neighborhood inequality are not new (Du Bois 1899;\nMyrdal 1944), we know much more about change in residential segregation than we do\nabout change in racial neighborhood inequality, in part because racial neighborhood\ninequality has not been measured with a standard inequality index.\nUsing the Gini index of inequality, we find that racial neighborhood inequality is\nvery large and pervasive in America's metropolitan areas. We also find that it has\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\nbecome less relatively advantaged, and blacks in particular have become less relatively\ndisadvantaged. In 1980, blacks lived in the poorest neighborhoods by far, followed by\nHispanics and then Asians. Over the next 30 years, neighborhood conditions improved\nfor all three minority groups relative to whites, with blacks exhibiting the greatest\nimprovement. By 2010, although black metropolitan residents continued to live in the\nmost-disadvantaged neighborhoods, on average, neighborhood poverty rates and me-\ndian incomes were much more similar for blacks and Hispanics than in 1980. Whites in\n2010 were no longer unambiguously the most advantaged group in terms of residential\neconomic environment: by 2010, Asians in many metropolitan areas resided in neigh-\nborhoods with lower poverty rates and higher median incomes than the neighborhoods\nwhere whites resided. Interestingly, income-based inequality declined more slowly than\npoverty-based inequality, perhaps indicating that the racial concentration of affluence is\nharder to reduce than the racial concentration of poverty.\noccurred between 2000 and 2010. At first blush, this recent reduction in black-white\nracial neighborhood inequality is surprising in light of evidence that the Great\nRecession had the most damaging effects on housing for African Americans (Hall\nproportion of majority-black neighborhoods experiencing what Freeman and Cai\n(2015) called a \"white invasion\" (an increase in the white population exceeding 5 %\nof the total tract population) was greater from 2000 to 2010 than in the two previous\ndecades combined (Freeman and Cai 2015). Moreover, virtually all the reduction in\nblack hypersegregation over the 30-year period occurred since 2000, with the number\nof hypersegregated metropolitan areas in America declining by more than one-third\nthat from 1970 to 2009, the highest proportion of minority neighborhoods experienced\n\"socioeconomic ascent\" after 2000. Our finding of a substantial decline in black-white\nneighborhood inequality after 2000 is also less surprising in light of the near-doubling\ncombined with the growing number of middle-class African Americans who have\nAfter documenting the decline in black-white neighborhood inequality between\n1980 and 2010, we used metropolitan fixed-effects regression to isolate the key drivers\nof the decline. The regression results contribute to knowledge about racial neighbor-\nhood inequality in three ways. First, the analyses reveal a very tight association\nbetween change in racial neighborhood inequality and change in racial residential\nsegregation across U.S. metropolitan areas, with coefficients that approach or exceed\n1.0 for the effect of segregation. As Massey and Denton (1993) insisted more than two\ndecades ago, residential segregation serves as the foundation for black-white disparities\nin neighborhood economic conditions in America. Thus, when black-white segregation\ndeclines, we expect black-white neighborhood inequality to decline as well. Second, we\ndiscover that the association between neighborhood segregation and racial neighbor-\nhood inequality applies to neighborhood income as well as to neighborhood poverty.\nPrior research has focused on the effect of residential segregation on neighborhood\npoverty. Third, we find that the association between neighborhood segregation and\nneighborhood inequality is as strong for Hispanics and whites as it is for blacks and\nG. Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell\nwhites. Apparently, Hispanic-white neighborhood inequality is determined by the same\nforces as black-white neighborhood inequality, so Hispanic-white neighborhood in-\nequality has declined more slowly than black-white neighborhood inequality largely\nbecause the decline in Hispanic-white segregation has lagged greatly behind the decline\nin black-white segregation.\nThe Divergence That Remains\nmetropolitan area declined by nearly 40 % based on neighborhood poverty and by\nnearly 30 % based on neighborhood median income. Despite this impressive reduction\nin black-white--and, to a lesser extent, in Hispanic-white--neighborhood inequality,\nlarge differences remain. To emphasize that point, we conclude by presenting the black-\nwhite and Hispanic-white Lorenz curves for neighborhood inequality in 2010. Figure 6\nshows the Lorenz curves for poverty-based and income-based black-white and\nHispanic-white neighborhood inequality in 2010 for U.S. metropolitan areas as a\nwhole, ignoring metropolitan boundaries. (Unlike Figs. 1 and 2, where blacks are\ncompared with nonblacks and Hispanics are compared with non-Hispanics, Fig. 6\ncompares blacks with whites and Hispanics with whites.) From these curves, we see\nthe disparity that remains in the poverty rates and median household incomes of the\nneighborhoods where whites live versus where Hispanics live and where blacks live.\nFor example, the poverty-based Lorenz curve for Hispanics and whites includes the\nneighborhoods where the poverty rate is lower than in the average (50th percentile)\nneighborhood where Hispanics live.\nThe disparity in neighborhood economic conditions is slightly greater for blacks\nversus whites: 84 % of whites live in neighborhoods where the poverty rate is lower\nthan in the average neighborhood where blacks live. Even poor whites often fail to\nexperience the levels of neighborhood disadvantage that are experienced by many\nShare of White Population (%)\nBlack-white\nHispanic-white\nPoverty\nShare of White Population (%)\nShare of Black (or Hispanic) Population (%)\nBlack-white\nHispanic-white\nIncome\nPoorest tracts Richest tracts Poorest tracts Richest tracts\nShare of Black (or Hispanic) Population (%)\nFig. 6 Lorenz curves for U.S. metropolitan areas showing black-white and Hispanic-white neighborhood\nSizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality\ndisparities in neighborhood economic conditions remain large and consequential.
