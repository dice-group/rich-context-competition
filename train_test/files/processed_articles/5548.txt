    "abstract": "Abstract\nOne of the most widely used instruments for the measurement of impulsivity is the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). The\nshort form of the BIS-11, the BIS-15, consists of 15 items representing the three subscales Attentional, Motor, and Non-Planning\nImpulsivity. In the current study, retest-reliabilities of BIS-15 scores were examined. Female university students completed\nthe BIS-15 at the beginning of the first (n = 133) and second (n = 120) semesters. Half-year retest-reliability was r\ntt\nthe BIS-15 total score and ranged between r\ntt\n= .61 and .78 for the subscales. Considering the long time span of almost half\na year between measurements, the total score of the BIS-15 has high retest-reliability and, thus, measures impulsivity as a\nstable personality trait.\n",

A total score and three sub-\nscale scores can be calculated, representing Non-Planning\nImpulsivity (i.e., lack of future orientation or forethought),\nMotor Impulsivity (i.e., acting without thinking), and\nAttentional Impulsivity (i.e., inability to focus attention or\nconcentrate; Patton et al., 1995; but note that many studies\nfailed to replicate this three-factorial structure; cf.\nVasconcelos, Malloy-Diniz, & Correa, 2012).\nwhich consists of 15 items only, and each subscale contains\n5 items. Scores of the BIS-15 are highly correlated with the\nfull version, suggesting that it may be used as an alternative\nto the full version without losing a significant amount of\ninformation (Spinella, 2007). Psychometric properties such\nas factor structure, internal consistency, and validity could be\nreplicated in German and Spanish (Meule, V\u00f6gele, & K\u00fcbler,\n2011; Orozco-Cabal, Rodr\u00edguez, Herin, Gempeler, & Uribe,\nImpulsivity is supposed to be a stable personality trait,\nparticularly when it is measured with self-report question-\nnaires. Accordingly, for the BIS-11, high 1-month retest-\nreliability has been reported for the total scale (r\ntt\nvalues were somewhat lower for the subscales (r\ntt\nStanford et al., 2009). To date, retest-reliability has not been\ninvestigated using the BIS-15, and, thus, the aim of the pres-\nent study was to examine retest-reliability for this short ver-\nsion. Moreover, we used a longer time span (almost half a\nyear) than previous studies on the BIS-11 (Stanford et al.,\n2009) to get a more appropriate indication for the assumption\nthat impulsivity is a stable trait.\nMethod\nThis study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki as revised in 2008.

One hundred twenty participants completed those\nmeasures again at the beginning of the second semester.\nParticipants received either course credits or 7,-  for com-\npensation.

Pearson correlation coefficients\nwere calculated for BIS-15 subscale and total scores between\nthe two measurements to evaluate retest-reliability.

Overall, values were comparable with those reported\nfor 1-month retest-reliability of the BIS-11 (Stanford et al.,\n2009). A general rule of thumb is that retest-reliability is\nacceptable or high at r\ntt\nwere below .80 in the current study, we would nonetheless\nargue that at least the total score of the BIS-15 has high retest-\nreliability, considering the long time span of almost half a year\nbetween the two measurements.

The atten-\ntional impulsivity subscale showed the lowest internal consis-\ntency and retest-reliability. This is in line with observations that\nthis subscale appears to be the most unstable one in studies, in\nwhich the factor structure of the BIS-11 was examined\n(Vasconcelos et al., 2012). Nevertheless, correlation coefficients\nwere still higher than .60, indicating large-sized correlation\nInterpretation of the current findings is limited by the\nfact that only female university students were investigated.\nFuture studies may investigate other samples such as men\nor individuals with lower education or higher age to reveal\nwhether the BIS-15 also has high retest-reliability in these\npopulations. For example, impulsivity has been found to\ndecline with age (Steinberg et al., 2008), and, thus, retest-\nreliability would probably be lower in samples with wider\nage range or when retest-reliability would be examined for\nseveral years. Other avenues for future research may be to\nexamine whether BIS-15 scores are sensitive to treatment\nin mental disorders that are marked by high impulsivity\nsuch as borderline personality disorder, attention deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disor-\nder, obesity, or substance use disorders (Guerrieri,\nalthough impulsivity appears to be a stable trait in non-\nclinical samples, it may be modifiable (Guerrieri,\nNederkoorn, & Jansen, 2012; Guerrieri, Nederkoorn,\nand scores may decrease in the course of psychotherapy in\nclinical samples.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe authors received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nB\u00fchner, M.
