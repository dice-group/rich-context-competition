Although\nthe correlation among overweight, low self-esteem, and\ndepression is well known, social isolation among over-\nweight children and adolescents has not been studied.\nObjective: To investigate social networks of over-\nweight and normal-weight adolescents in a large, nation-\nally representative sample.\nDesign: Cross-sectional, nationally representative co-\nhort study.\nyears who were enrolled in the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health, of which a 1:5 subsample\nwas selected for detailed in-home assessment, including\nweight was defined according to body mass index (95th\npercentile for age and sex).\nMain Outcome Measures: This analysis focuses on\nthe number of friendship nominations each adolescent\nreceived from other adolescents. The number of friend-\nship nominations and other social network measures were\ncalculated using statistical software.\nResults: Overweight adolescents were more likely to be\nsocially isolated and to be peripheral to social networks\nthan were normal-weight adolescents. Although over-\nweight adolescents listed similar numbers of friends as\nnormal-weight adolescents, overweight adolescents re-\nceived significantly fewer friendship nominations from\nothers than were received by normal-weight adoles-\ncents (mean [SE] number of friendship nominations, 3.39\nwere also more likely to receive no friendship nomina-\ntions than were normal-weight adolescents (odds ratio,\nvision viewing (P.001), increased levels of sports par-\nticipation (P.001), and increased participation in school\nclubs (P.001) were associated with significantly more\nfriendship nominations and higher network centrality\nscores among both overweight and normal-weight ado-\nlescents.\nConclusions: Many overweight adolescents are so-\ncially marginalized. Such isolation may aggravate the so-\ncial and emotional consequences of overweight in this\nage group.\nThere is no doubt that obesity is an undesirable\nstate of existence for a child. It is even more\nundesirable for an adolescent, for whom even\nmild degrees of overweight may act as a\ndamaging barrier in a society obsessed with\nslimness.\nThe professional community is concerned with\nthe medical concomitants of obesity, but the\npsychological and social perils are at least as\nimportant to those afflicted by the problem.\nThe reason is clear; society does not tolerate\nexcess weight.

Many studies find that overweight\nadolescents have higher prevalence of depressive symp-\ntoms8 and lower self-esteem than are found among their\nnormal-weight peers.9-11 However, other studies report\nnormal levels of self-esteem.12,13 Differences in age, race,\nand income among studies may account for the discrep-\nant findings. For instance, low self-esteem is not char-\nacteristic of obese, inner-city, African American chil-\ndren14 or obese preschool children.15 Analysis of the data\nfrom the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth indi-\ncates that early adolescence is a critical time for the de-\nvelopment of low self-esteem in overweight children.16\nOther data indirectly reflect the strong stigma as-\nsociated with overweight during childhood and adoles-\ncence.17 Studies of children as young as 6 years find that\noverweight individuals are likely to be described in de-\nrogatory terms.18,19 The studies performed by Richard-\ndren are ranked by other children as the least-desirable\nfriends. Childhood and adolescent overweight is associ-\nated with adverse social and economic status in subse-\nquent adulthood, with particularly strong effects re-\nported among women. Gortmaker and colleagues21 found\nthat adolescent girls who were overweight in 1981 had\nlower earnings, were less likely to be married, and were\nmore likely to be in poverty than were otherwise com-\nparable nonoverweight peers.\nFriendship is an essential vehicle for the social and\npsychological development of adolescents.22-24 Given the\nimportance of peer appearance norms, body image, and\nphysical fitness to social and emotional development,\noverweight may have lasting implications for child de-\nvelopment and adolescent well-being. Yet few studies pro-\nvide concrete measures to scrutinize the social implica-\ntions of overweight for individuals' friendship ties and\nrelationships with school peers.\nTo understand the extent that overweight adoles-\ncents may be isolated or socially marginalized in rela-\ntionships with school peers, we analyzed data from the\nNational Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth). We explored the social marginalization of over-\nweight adolescents, as measured by the most detailed avail-\nable nationally representative data set, to explore social\nconnections among more than 20000 high school stu-\ndents for whom biometric data could be obtained.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe study population consisted of 7th to 12th grade adoles-\ncents enrolled in wave 1 of Add Health. Add Health is a feder-\nally funded study designed to assess the health status of ado-\nlescents and explore causes of health-related behaviors. A novel\nfeature of Add Health is the collection of detailed friendship\nnetwork data. These data provide direct assessment of an in-\ndividual respondent's social standing with her school peers. Re-\nstricted data were obtained by arrangement with Add Health\nafter approval from the University of Medicine and Dentistry\nof New Jersey Institutional Review Board.\nThe primary sample frame for Add Health was the Qual-\nity Education Data database, which is thought to be the most\ncomprehensive list of high schools available. The sample high\nschools were selected systematically, with selection probabili-\nties proportional to the school's enrollment. Before sampling,\nthe schools were sorted by size, school type (public, paro-\nchial, private), census region, level of urbanicity, and percent-\nage of white students. Detailed sampling procedures are de-\nscribed elsewhere.25 All students who completed an in-school\nquestionnaire (n=90118), plus those who did not complete the\nquestionnaire but were listed on the school roster, were eli-\ngible for 1:5 random selection for an in-home evaluation. These\ndata include a broad range of information regarding family in-\ncome, household composition, academic achievement, and the\npresence of other health-related medical conditions.\nComplete demographic data were available for more than\n90% of the resulting sample. Special oversamples included Af-\nrican Americans and Hispanics and a subset of schools from\nwhich all enrolled students were selected. Demographic de-\ntails of the cohort are shown in Table 1. The weighted in-\nmate a nationally representative, probability-based survey of\nadolescents in grades 7 through 12.\nOVERWEIGHT\nSelf-reported weight and height were obtained from the in-\ncan, 10871 non-Hispanic white). Previous research has vali-\ndated self-reported weights and heights as an indicator of\noverweight in adolescents.26 Within this specific study, there\nwas more than 95% concordance of overweight status using both\ncalculated and measured weights and heights.27 Overweight was\ndefined as a body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in\nkilograms divided by the square of height in meters) greater\nthan the 95th percentile for age and sex (n=1852) derived from\nthe most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics growth curves.28 This defi-\nnition is in accordance with recommendations of the expert panel\non childhood obesity.29\nA unique aspect of Add Health is the mapping of social net-\nworks using data from all (responding) students who at-\ntended participating schools (n=90118). Each participating stu-\ndent designated his or her 5 best male friends and 5 best female\nfriends. This study design allows investigators to explore the\ninterplay between individual characteristics and the social struc-\nture of the school within which the student is enrolled. Add\nHealth data include the identification number of students iden-\nTable 1.

Using matrix programs (PAJEK, available on\nthe Internet at http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek; and\nSAS IML, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) the connections and re-\nlationships between each student were determined (Figure 1).\nSocial network data were available for more than three quar-\nters (77%) of adolescents with weight and height data. Figure\n1 demonstrates a social network of one of the schools with com-\nplete friendship data in the Add Health study.\nFor each adolescent, the number of friendship nomina-\ntions from other students was identified (in-degree measure), as\nwas the total number of friends and friends of friends (extended\nnetwork). The group of adolescents who received the most nomi-\nnations for friend and best friend were considered the most popu-\nlar. Reciprocity represented the likelihood that an individual who\nwas nominated as best friend also returned the nomination.\nWe also explore the centrality of Add Health respondents\nin their social networks, as captured by the Bonacich mea-\nsure.30,31 In brief, these centrality measures compare an indi-\nvidual's popularity to that of individuals with whom he or she\nis connected. Individuals who have fewer friends than do oth-\ners in their friendship networks would have low centrality scores.\nWe use centrality measure based on the in-degree social\nnetwork. In-degree measures rely on friendship ties reported\nby others rather than those identified by self-report. Previous\nresearch identifies in-degree centrality as superior to out-\ndegree measures in obtaining accurate descriptions of friend-\nship and advice networks.32 In-degree measures are also de-\nsigned to capture observed differences in social ties and\nreciprocity among unpopular, average, and popular adoles-\ncents that do not arise in self-reported out-degree measures\namong the same respondents.33\nThe completeness of friendship nomination data and BMI data\ndiffered across race/ethnic groups. However, these differences\nwere small and not likely to influence outcome. Overall, friend-\nship nomination data were available for 77% of adolescents with\ncalculated BMI z scores (Hispanic, 74.6%; African American,\n80.2%; white, 76.3%). Similarly, although there were signifi-\ncant sex differences in those with (male, 48%) and without (male,\n51%) friendship data, these differences were also relatively small.\nThere were no significant differences in BMI z scores or obe-\nsity prevalence in those with and without friendship nomina-\nFriendship networks were generated using PAJEK and SAS IML\nstatistical software.34 Because the survey oversampled African\nAmericans and Hispanics, we used Add Health sample weights\nto provide prevalence estimates corresponding to a national rep-\nresentative sample as recommended.34 SEs were adjusted to ac-\ncount for school-wide clustering using Stata statistical soft-\nware version 7.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex). Differences\nin proportions were compared by the 2 test. Multivariate analy-\nsis, accounting for the weighted and stratified nature of Add\nHealth, was used for continuous variables.\nFigure 1.

Overweight adolescents were significantly more\nlikely than normal-weight peers to receive no friendship\nweight respondents as best friends were less likely to re-\nciprocate the nomination than identified best friends of\nnormal-weight adolescents (Tables 2 and 3).\nWe found similar patterns using more global net-\nwork measures. Bonacich centrality scores, which mea-\nsure an adolescent's connection to highly nominated peers,\nwere significantly lower for overweight adolescents than\nfor normal-weight adolescents (Tables 2 and 3). The Free-\nman betweenness measure of the extent to which social\nties pass through an individual also indicates that over-\nweight respondents are significantly less likely to play\nan \"intermediary\" role between well-connected adoles-\ncentscomparedwithnormal-weightadolescents(P=.004).\nSelf-reported out-degree network measures ap-\npeared to overstate the social connectedness of over-\nweight adolescents, as reported by peers. Normal-\nweight respondents reported the same mean number of\nfriendship ties about others (4.58) as others reported about\nthem (4.79). Overweight respondents provided signifi-\ncantly more nominations of others (4.29) than they re-\nceived (3.39). Controlling for ethnicity, sex, parental edu-\ncation, family income, school size, and mean school\nnetwork density, overweight adolescents received fewer\nfriendship nominations than did otherwise comparable\nnormal-weight peers who reported the same number of\nout-degree friendship ties (P.001).\nWe also examined race/ethnic variation in our main\nresults, with group-specific results provided for the 3 larg-\nest race/ethnic groups: Non-Hispanic white (non-\nTable 2.

Within our stratified multivariate\nanalysis, overweight respondents received significantly\nfewer friendship nominations in 4 of the 6 examined sub-\ngroups, with the strongest results found among non-\nHispanic whites of both sexes and among young His-\npanic men. Point estimates were notably smaller among\nAfrican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites even\nafter controlling for confounding factors.\nAside from overweight, several covariates were sig-\nnificantly associated with friendship nominations\n(Figure 3). Decreased hours of television viewing\nand increased participation in school clubs (P.001) were\nassociated with significantly more friendship nomina-\ntions among both overweight and normal-weight adoles-\ncents.Althoughtheeffectsofsportsparticipationwerestron-\ngest among normal-weight respondents, an overweight\nrespondentwhoparticipatedinsports5timesperweeknev-\nerthelessreceivedapproximatelythesamenumberoffriend-\nship nominations as a normal-weight adolescent who did\nnot participate in such activities.\nMultivariate analysis also confirmed the relation-\nship between overweight and decreased friendship nomi-\nnations (Table 5). We found a robust association be-\ntween overweight and in-degree social ties. Our point\nestimates were significant and stable across a range of\nspecifications. In model 1, we examine unadjusted dif-\nferences, finding a mean social penalty of 1.17 nomina-\ntions among boys and 1.61 among girls. In model 2, we\ncontrol for standard sociodemographic factors and find\nvirtually identical point estimates among boys and de-\ncreased point estimates among girls.\nBecause overweight might reflect sedentary life-\nstyle factors associated with social marginalization, we\ncontrol in model 3 for television watching, club partici-\npation, and sports. (Note that if overweight contributes\nto increased sedentary activity, model 3 would, in prin-\nciple, understate the impact of overweight on social ties.)\nTable 4.

All rights reserved.\nAs shown, inclusion of lifestyle factors had little impact\non our results.\nSchools may systematically differ in social network\ncharacteristics based on school size (which alters possi-\nbilities for social connections), region, economic, or cul-\ntural factors. If such variation is correlated with over-\nweight prevalence, these patterns could produce a\nspurious correlation between overweight and social ties.\nTo examine this possibility, we included school size and\nschool-specific network density as covariates in the same\nregressions. Inclusion of these effects had a negligible im-\npact on our results for boys and led to slightly stronger\nestimated overweight effects among girls.\nFinally, the relationship between overweight and de-\ncreased friendship nominations was seen across almost\nall schools studied; overweight adolescents had fewer\nfriendship nominations than did normal-weight adoles-\nfriendship network data. In addition, other chronic child-\nhood health conditions (eg, asthma, migraine head-\naches, and chronic abdominal pain), in contrast to over-\nweight status, were not associated with decreased\nfriendship nominations or with decreased network cen-\ntrality (Table 6).\nCOMMENT\nManyoverweightadolescentboysandgirlsaresociallymar-\nginalized among their peers. Controlling for other fac-\ntors, overweight respondents received fewer friendship\nnominations than their normal-weight peers. Over-\nweight respondents were less central to their social net-\nworksandhadfewerfriendshiptiesthanotherswithwhom\nthey were connected. Overweight respondents were more\nlikely to receive no friendship nominations than were their\nnormal-weight peers. The contrasts in friendship ties be-\ntween overweight and normal-weight adolescents match\noverall patterns identified by others to distinguish popu-\nlar and unpopular children in social network data.23\nOverall, the relationship between overweight and so-\ncial isolation was moderate in strength; most over-\nweight respondents had at least one friendship nomina-\ntion, and more than one-quarter had 5 or more friendship\nnominations. Although the quality of friendships could\nnot be assessed, lower rates of reciprocity of best friend\nnominations among overweight respondents provide one\nsuggestive indication that friendship ties involving over-\nweight children may also be weaker.\nIn addition to our main results, we found notewor-\nthy differences across the 6 race/ethnic and sex categories\nexplored.Socialmarginalizationofoverweightchildrenap-\npears most pronounced among non-Hispanic whites, with\nthelargestpointestimatesamongyoungwomen.Wefound\nsmaller effects among both African Americans and His-\npanics, a result consistent with other research that sug-\ngests racial/ethnic differences in the emotional and social\nAlthough overweight adolescents appear more so-\ncially marginalized than other respondents, our multi-\nvariate analysis suggests that increased participation in\ncollective activities is associated with improved social ties.\nIn every subgroup examined, overweight young men and\nwomen who participated in sports and club activities and\nwho spent fewer hours watching television displayed\ngreater friendship attachments than their otherwise com-\nparable overweight peers.\nWe hypothesize that social marginalization of over-\nweight individuals contributes to reduced self-esteem and\nincreased depressive symptoms among overweight ado-\nlescents. Previous studies have documented that adoles-\ncent intimacy and friendships are important determi-\nnants of anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and overall\nmental health.19 Such patterns may also be especially im-\nportant when viewed in light of widespread interest in\n\"social capital\" and the growing literature highlighting\nthe role of informal ties and \"contact networks\" in shap-\ning economic status,27 educational attainment,28 job seek-\nminished social capital available to overweight children\nand adolescents, captured by social network measures,\nmay therefore contribute to the reduced social status and\neconomic well-being of overweight adults.\nFrom a methodologic perspective, the unique de-\nsign of Add Health allows scrutiny of social patterns that\nwould otherwise go undetected in analyses based solely\non self-report. Self-reported friendship ties by over-\nweight adolescents significantly exceed the number of\nfriendship ties to the same adolescents, as reported by oth-\ners. The desire to provide socially desired responses pro-\nvides one possible explanation for these discordant pat-\nterns. The Add Health survey design may encourage\nrespondents to list 5 friends, even if the actual number of\nfriends is greater or smaller than this number. Respon-\ndents may also misperceive others' views of friendship ties.\nCross-sectional studies such as this one also cannot\nunpack the causal direction of the linkage between over-\nweight and social ties. Both overweight and social margin-\nalization may be correlated with other, unmeasured vari-\nables that play a strong causal role. Instrumental variable\nmethods may help to clarify these relationships.27 From a\nclinical perspective, our results underscore that over-\nTable 6.
