    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn some democratic contexts, there is a strong aversion to the directive, individualistic and\nmasculine expressions of leadership that have come to dominate the study of political leadership.\nSuch leadership is antithetical to consensus democracies in parts of continental Europe, where the\nantipathy to leadership has linguistic, institutional as well as cultural dimensions. Political-admin-\nistrative and socio-cultural contexts in these countries provide little room for heroic expressions\nof leadership. Consequently, alternative forms of leadership and associated vocabularies have\ndeveloped that carry profound practical relevance but that have remained underexplored.\nBased on an in-depth mixed-methods study, this article presents the Dutch mayoralty as an\ninsightful and exemplary case of what can be called `bridging-and-bonding leadership'; it provides\na clear illustration of how understandings of democratic leadership can deviate from the dominant\nparadigm and of how leading in a consensus context brings about unique practical challenges for\noffice holders. The analysis shows that the important leadership task of democratic guardianship\nthat is performed by Dutch mayors is in danger of being overlooked by scholars of political\nleadership, as are consensus-oriented leadership roles in other parts of the world. For that\nreason, a recalibration of the leadership concept is needed, developing an increased theoretical\nsensitivity towards the non-decisive and process-oriented aspects of the leadership phenomenon.\nThis article specifies how the future study of leadership, as a part of the change that is advocated,\ncan benefit from adopting additional languages of leadership.\n",

Although the phenom-\nenon of leadership does exist also in the Netherlands, it is preferably not referred to by use of\nthe word `leadership' (`t Hart and Ten Hooven, 2004). Some leading Dutch scholars even\nadvocate doing away with the use of the word altogether:\nWe should do away with the term `leadership' . . . In the same way as there are places that are\nguilty \u00ad Auschwitz, Sobibor, the Killing Fields of Cambodja \u00ad, there are also words that are\nguilty. . . . One could be inclined to suggest that these words are simply just that: words, but that\nwould be very nai\u00a8ve. Words are not guttural sound or printed letters. Words are parts of sen-\ntences, and sentences, in turn, are parts of thoughts and of nutty ideas (Zijderveld, 2010).\nIn the Netherlands, there is thus an important linguistic dimension to the aversion to lead-\nership that is prevalent in both the political and the societal cultures (Hendriks, 2010).\nFor the Dutch, the very word `leadership' produces controversy and abhorrence, as the\nlinguistic interpretation of the concept is one that reminds of the deconstructive role of a\nFu\u00a8hrer, and the concept is being perceived as being the opposite of democracy (De Beus,\n2006; see also Kane and Patapan, 2012). Because of these history-laden connotations, the\nword is preferably avoided in the Netherlands, as it sometimes is in other continental\nFor cases where politicians and scholars cannot avoid the use of the leadership concept\naltogether, they have developed an almost euphemistic vocabulary of leadership that uses\nphrases such as `small-l leadership', `facilitative leadership' or `connecting leadership' to\ndescribe the nature of political leadership in the Netherlands (Noordergraaf, 2006; `t Hart\nand Ten Hooven, 2004). In fact, the Dutch word `leiderschap' is often put into contrast with\nthe English word `leadership' to highlight the alleged differences between the two concep-\ntions of the leadership phenomenon (Hendriks and Tops, 2000). The Dutch discourse of\nleadership, thus, is one of caution.\nThere is also an important cultural dimension to the aversion to leadership in the\nNetherlands. Language and culture being inseparable (Jepson, 2010: 428), the cultural\nand linguistic dimensions are, of course, closely related, but they point to subtly dif-\nferent phenomena. It is not only the vocabulary of leadership that is approached with\ncaution in the Netherlands, it is also its expressions in practice (Andeweg, 2000;\nLijphart, 1999). The Dutch tend to dislike strong personalities (Hendriks and Tops,\n2000) and traditionally have an aversion to notions of headship and followership (De\nBeus, 2006). The country is not used to cherishing `great leaders', and frontrunners\nusually are not granted much room to manoeuvre (Cerfontaine, 2005). Rather than as\n`messiahs', leaders are seen as people that one needs to be suspicious of, or as passers-\nby at best (`t Hart, 2000; see also Judd, 2000). The `coincidental' leaders that happen to\nbe in office, then, are strictly scrutinized (Frissen, 2009). The fact that leadership, and\nespecially strong, directive leadership, is generally mistrusted in the Netherlands, shows\nin the country's relatively low score on Hofstede's (2001) `power distance' dimension\nand especially also the `masculinity' dimension of culture. It is this make-up of the\nDutch culture that makes showing leadership very difficult (Cerfontaine, 2005; `t Hart,\nThe aversion to leadership in the Netherlands is also rooted in the county's laws and\ninstitutions, which aim to avoid concentrations of power as much as possible (`t Hart, 2005).\nChecks and balances have been institutionalized throughout the political system, as well as\ncountervailing powers and barriers to institutional change. These have been very important\nin blocking the introduction of more powerful individuals into the Dutch consensus-oriented\nsystem (Geurtz, 2012). There is, thus, also an important institutional dimension to the aver-\nsion to leadership.\nOne of the main checks on empowered individualistic political leadership is the legal\nprinciple of collegiality. By law, the local and national executive boards are collegial\nbodies, which means that their members collectively share responsibility and accountability\nfor the board's decisions. Another powerful check on individualistic political leadership is\nthat the Netherlands knows no directly elected executives at any level of government.\nThrough such mechanisms, an intentional `leadership vacuum' was created that has rendered\nstrong leadership almost absent and even counteracts it (`t Hart, 2000).\nTaken together, these three aversions constrain executive decisiveness to the extent that in\nthe Netherlands, as well as in other consensus democracies, leadership is not of the same\nkind as the phenomenon that is described by traditional Anglo notions of leadership. Rather\nthan being of the strong and decisive type, leadership in the consensus democracies is of the\nbridging-and-bonding type. Drawing on work by Putnam (2000), this concept, as developed\nby Hendriks and Karsten (2014), emphasizes in particular the relational aspect of leadership\nin bringing people together across societal and institutional boundaries.\nContextualizing the aversion to leadership in the Netherlands\nThe explanation for the multidimensional aversion to leadership in the Netherlands is at\nleast twofold. First, there is the historical background to approaching leadership with such\ncaution. In further historicizing the institutional, cultural and linguistic dimensions just\nmentioned, we should emphasize the history of state formation in the Netherlands \u00ad the\ncherished (his)story of a freedom-loving, highly decentralized, republic of semi-autonomous\nprovinces and towns, breaking away from power-centralizing Habsburgian rule in the 16th\nand 17th century (Schama, 1987). For centuries, the idea of monarchy, let alone absolute\nmonarchy, was done away with, until its reappearance as a highly constrained and increas-\ningly ceremonial monarchy in the 19th century. With the Netherlands being situated largely\nbelow sea level, the Dutch had to synchronise widely dispersed efforts in collaborative\narrangements, which developed bottom up, gelling separate water boards in an integrated\ntry, hemmed in between physically more forceful countries, the Netherlands cultivated prag-\nmatic skills of negotiation, mediation and diplomacy: elements of soft power rather than\nhard power (Nye, 2004). For many, however, the aversion to leadership is most prominently\nlinked to the dubious role of strong leadership \u00ad the Leiter- or Fu\u00a8hrerprinzip \u00ad in the Second\nWorld War and the horrors that came out of that (De Beus, 2006). In an attempt to explain\nwhy there is a `lack of leadership' in the Netherlands, some scholars add the questionable\nrole that a number of leading men in the Netherlands played when they collaborated with the\noccupying forces during the war (e.g., Kellerman, 2014). Although we do not necessarily\nagree with this line of reasoning, it is certainly the case that leadership in the Netherlands\njust after the Second World War was particularly pragmatic and technocratic, rather than\nvisionary and decisive. This not only facilitated the swift uptake of New Public\nManagement-style managerialism in the 1990s (Hendriks and Tops, 2003), but also had a\nprofound impact on how the Dutch understand leadership today (Hendriks, 2010; `t Hart\nSecond, there are socio-political reasons that connect to the `consociational' governance\ntradition of the Netherlands. Traditionally, Dutch society was characterized by high levels of\nsocial segmentation and by a situation of coinciding political, religious, economic, social,\nand cultural cleavages (Andeweg, 2000; Lijphart, 1999). These produced a number of strong\nsubcultures, or `pillars', that each had its own political, social and economic networks.\nThe so-called `pillarization' of society produced a high risk of political conflict, but the\nDutch managed to minimize such risks and to achieve high levels of cooperation between\nthe pillars. This result was arrived at through a process of seeking compromises between the\nThe high level of cooperation was facilitated by a process of depoliticization, that is defining\nissues as technical problems rather than as ideological conflicts (Hendriks, 2010).\nTo the extent that there was room for leadership in this governance model, it was a\nfunction of collective entities (Gronn, 2009). It was a form of shared, non-political leadership\nthat left very little room for the individualistic forms of leadership that are typical of the\nAnglo-centric tradition (Gladdish, 1991; Lijphart, 1968). In fact, whereas Margaret Thatcher\nfamously claimed that consensus was the antithesis of leadership (`t Hart, 2005), in the\nNetherlands reaching consensus was the ultimate expression of what passed as leadership.\nAlthough the pillars have nowadays disintegrated to a large extent, both culturally and\ninstitutionally, there is still a deep-seated tradition of power-sharing and consensual leader-\nship preserved in the Dutch governance model that results from its consociational past.\nAt the same time, it should be recognized that more recently the Netherlands, like many\nother countries in Europe, has witnessed the rise of a call for stronger leadership (SCP, 2011;\nsee also Hendriks and Karsten, 2014). Scholars have signalled a tendency in Europe to break\naway from more collective and consensual forms of leadership: more and more powers are\nbeing vested in the executive branch of government, also in the hands of individual execu-\nAlthough this does raise questions as to whether there is still such a big difference between\nthe Anglo-American and the continental traditions of leadership, there are good reasons to\nbelieve so. First, the studies showing that there is a call for leadership among citizens are not\nuncontroversial. Some of the survey questions that support the leadership-call claim are, for\nexample being criticized for being double-barrelled, which makes it difficult to reliably inter-\npret the data (Hendriks et al., 2012). Second, figures show that the call for stronger leader-\nindeed a noticeable call for leadership, it is often qualified as being `ambiguous' (Karsten,\n2013) or `dubious' (Frissen, 2009). Rather than as a genuine desire for decisive leaders, the\ncall of leadership is seen as the unsolicited result of a feeling of confusion (`t Hart, 2005).\nThis is because citizens express a demand for administrative decisiveness, but at the same\ntime want their leaders to be highly responsive to their interests. Citizens seem to call for\nstronger leadership, but whereas this is an essential part of strong leadership not for the kind\nof directive leadership that acts against their wishes (Karsten, 2013; see also Dunn, 1999; see\nalso Kane and Patapan, 2012). It might thus be that, rather than a call for heroic forms of\nleadership, we are witnessing an inarticulate call for responsiveness and good governance. In\nany case, the consensual style of decision-making is still highly valued in consensus democ-\nracies, as is the type of leadership that accompanies it (Hendriks, 2010).\nLeadership in a consensus democracy:\nThe typical case of the Dutch mayor\nAlthough other examples are available throughout the world, one of the clearest illustrations\nof what leadership in a consensus democracy amounts to is provided by the Dutch mayor-\nalty. It is also one of the clearest illustrations of how an understanding of leadership can\ndeviate from the still-dominant Anglo-centric notion of leadership. Notwithstanding the\nwelcome rise of non-traditional and more critical leadership studies, which place high\nvalue on the relational and collective nature of leadership, also in Anglo contexts (e.g.,\nwithin mainstream leadership literature to rely on a model of political leaders as `visionary\nvides an insightful and exemplary case of some of the less well-recognized aspects of political\nleadership in consensus democracies (Hendriks and Karsten, 2014). It is striking to see the\nextent to which local leadership in the Dutch context deviates from the heroic understanding\nof mayoral leadership that has recently come to predominate the worldwide debate on local\nand even global governance, most prominently in the work of Barber (2013).\nWhereas Barber, in his seminal book If mayors ruled the world, describes a type of lead-\nership that might, as he claims, be particularly authoritative and effective in many circum-\nstances, it does not correspond very well to the type of mayoral leadership that can be\nobserved in a consensus democracy like the Netherlands. Whereas Barber champions\nmayors for exhibiting a non-partisan and pragmatic styles of governance, the types of\nmayors that he discusses are typically institutionally strong and wilful mayors that have a\npersonal-political, though not necessarily party-political, profile. They tend to be people of\nambitious vision who are not afraid to get their hands dirty. On the view of Barber, it is their\neffectiveness in realizing certain policy goals that sets them apart from the allegedly dys-\nfunctional nation state.\nTo illustrate the focus on results and output-legitimacy, Barber (2013: 87) quotes Mayor\nNutter of Philadelphia: `You have to perform, you have to get things done . . . You either fill\npotholes, or don't . . .'. According to Barber (2013: 88): the `can-do thinking' of mayors\nworldwide demands a strong personality marked by both hubris and humour, a pragmatic\napproach to governing, personal engagement, and commitment to the city.\nThe current study is not claiming that Barber's analysis of these executives fails to provide\nvaluable insights into local leadership, but rather that it provides insufficient insight into\nalternative types of leadership that carry considerable relevance for the wider debate on what\nis political leadership in a democratic context (Kane and Patapan, 2014; Teles, 2015). Dutch\nmayors play a fundamentally different role in local governance than Barber's mayors, the\nanalysis of which requires a different understanding of what leadership is and also requires a\ndifferent vocabulary. Mayors in consensus democracies do not show decide-and-accomplish\nleadership like, for example, former NYC-mayor Bloomberg (Barber, 2013: 25\u00ad28), but\nbridging-and-bonding leadership, and in the particular case of the Dutch mayor `democratic\nguardianship'. This leadership role is seen to be crucial for the authority and effectiveness of\nDutch mayors, not only in the past but also nowadays (Karsten et al., 2014). A clear illus-\ntration is provided by former Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen after the assassination of prom-\ninent publicist Theo van Gogh in 2004. Through his bridging-and-bonding leadership Cohen\nfamously managed to `keep things together' (Hajer, 2009). The nature of Dutch mayoral\nleadership challenges some of the existing conceptions of what the role of local leaders is.\nIn support of some of the more critical leadership scholars, we signal a need for a recali-\nMethods. This article presents the results of an extensive mixed-methods study on the state of\nthe Dutch mayoral office. Between September and November 2013, a web-based survey was\nconducted. The survey was sent out by e-mail to all 405 Dutch mayors on our behalf by the\nDutch Association of Mayors. After three reminders, 243 Dutch mayors (60 percent of the\npopulation) had completed the questionnaire. An analysis of the responses shows that the\nsample is representative of the population of Dutch mayors in terms of gender, party-political\nmembership, municipal size and the ratio of sitting mayors to acting mayors.1 In addition, 12\nsemi-structured interviews with selected mayors were conducted for our study and the authors\nshadowed individual mayors for a total of four days and attended eight additional meetings\nfor participatory observation. Further, the nature of mayoral leadership was discussed in four\nfocus groups, in which a total of 24 mayors and seven other political-administrative actors\nparticipated. Also, using the lexical analysis software tools Textstatt and WordSmith, a\ncomputerized text analysis was conducted of 202 job vacancy texts for Dutch mayors that\nwere published since the introduction of a new nationwide toolkit for drafting those.2\nLeadership and guardianship: The Dutch mayor\nAs we have argued, the Dutch mayoral office is an insightful case of non-Anglo leadership\nthat reinforces existing doubts regarding mainstream leadership studies' preoccupation with\nindividualist and visionary approaches to leadership (Collinson, 2014; Gronn, 2009; Teles,\n2015). There are at least two dimensions to the particularity of the Dutch mayoralty. The\nfirst is the statutory position of the Dutch mayor. The second is the leadership role that the\nDutch mayor takes up in local government in practice. These two dimensions will be dis-\ncussed separately in this section, followed by a characterization of the leadership role of the\nDutch mayor in terms of `democratic guardianship'.\nThe statutory position of the Dutch mayor. Especially when compared to most of their\nEuropean colleagues, seen from an institutional perspective, Dutch mayors are rather\nweak leaders (Ba\n\u00a8 ck et al., 2006). Dutch mayors have few executive tasks and responsibilities.\nIn the Netherlands, powers that in other countries usually rest with mayors individually are\nvested in the Board of Mayor and Aldermen. This executive board operates as a formal\ncollective decision-making body, which means that mayors have very little individual deci-\nsion-making power. In case of conflict, mayors have the deciding vote, but this right is\nalmost never exercised because mayors are expected to follow the lead of the majority of\nthe board or of the responsible alderman (Karsten et al., 2014). Further, for the execution of\nmost of their tasks, Dutch mayors greatly depend on the political support of the popularly\nelected municipal council. Mayors stand fully accountable to the council, and the impor-\ntance of this accountability relationship has substantially increased over the last decades.\nThis has led to a significant weakening in the mayor's statutory position (Karsten et al.,\n2013). Dutch mayors do have some executive capabilities that stem from their legal respon-\nsibility for the police and public safety, but also in this this respect they are fully accountable\nto the municipal council. The Dutch mayor is, thus, surrounded by a strong set of checks and\nbalances that leave little room for directive and individualistic leadership.\nIn addition, what is highly unique about the statutory position of the Dutch mayor and what\nis also a strongly non-Anglo characteristic of the Dutch mayoral office is that Dutch mayors,\nunlike most other world mayors, are not directly or indirectly elected. In contrast, Dutch mayors\nare appointed by central government (Schaap et al., 2009). This `Crown appointment' is one of\nthe strongest expressions of the fact that Dutch mayors are expected to adopt a non-political\nstance. It expresses the fact that Dutch mayors are positioned to operate relatively autono-\nmously and at a distance from the political goings-on. Although the influence of the municipal\ncouncil on the selection of the mayor in the complex selection procedure is substantial, the\nCrown appointment mirrors the image of an independent and non-political mayor that exercises\nlittle individualistic leadership, particularly not political and decisive leadership.\nAlthough Barber (2013: 98), in his discussion of mayoral leadership, does touch upon the\nunique selection procedure of Dutch mayors and also discusses some of its consequences for\nthe role of the mayor, his account does not fully grasp the unique character of the Dutch\nmayoral subtype, which cannot justifiably be equated with Barber's archetypal and typically\nAnglo-American mayor. Barber rightfully champions the pragmatism of Dutch mayor's such\nas Van der Laan (Amsterdam) and Aboutaleb (Rotterdam), but at the same time overlooks\nimportant aspects of their weak statutory position and especially the fact that they are not\ndecide-and-accomplish types of mayors. These mayors do not lead in the same way as many\nother world mayors do, at least in part as a consequence of how they are positioned in an\ninstitutional sense (Hajer, 2009). In addition, their pragmatism is not of the same kind as the\n`achieving' kind that Barber and others applaud mayors for and that is typical for his Anglo-\ncentric notion of leadership. Whereas Dutch mayors, from an Anglo-inspired perspective on\nleadership, might be viewed as non-leaders, they actually perform crucial leadership roles in\nlocal government in the way that we will elaborate on in the next section.\nThe role of the Dutch mayor in local government. The fact that heroic interpretations of the\nleadership concept do not fit with the leadership role of Dutch mayors becomes especially\nclear when we look at what the role of Dutch mayors is in practice. Whereas eminent\nleadership scholars see `developing strategic policy direction' as one of the core leadership\nit is exactly this task that may be the least accurate description of the role that mayors play in\nDutch local government.\nWhen asked what they see as their most important day-to-day activities in relation to both\nthe representative municipal council and the executive board, which are both chaired by the\nmayor, Dutch mayors report that `giving policy direction' is the least important activity\n(Tables 1 and 2). Less content-driven and more process-oriented tasks such as quality con-\ntrol of the decision-making process are seen as more important.\nPaired t-tests show that there are substantial differences in the perceived importance of\nmayors' activities in the representative municipal council and in the executive board.\nMayors' roles in giving policy direction (t \u00bc 7.94; p < 0.001), overseeing the quality of the\nconflict (t \u00bc 2.82; p \u00bc 0.005) are statistically significantly more important in their contact\nwith the executive board than in their contact with the representative council. These differ-\nences can be explained by the fact that the mayor is a non-member chair of the municipal\ncouncil, but a full-member chair of the executive board. In contrast, these being legally\ndefined responsibilities of the mayor, safeguarding integrity (t \u00bc \u00c02.40; p \u00bc 0.017) and\nrendering account (t \u00bc \u00c06.58; p < 0.001) are statistically more important in relation to the\nmunicipal council. Effect sizes range from small to medium \u00ad Cohen's d ranges between 0.135\np \u00bc 0.178) show no statistically significant differences. Although the leadership role of the\nDutch mayor, thus, is more prominent in the executive board than in the representative\ncouncil, it is more process-oriented than content-driven in both cases.\nThese survey results are corroborated by interviews, focus-group discussions and parti-\ncipatory observations. Dutch mayors report that one of the first things they learn after\nbecoming mayor is to `sit on their hands' and to not have an opinion. The following\nquote from a mayor gives a clear illustration:\nAs a mayor I've learned not to act. I don't do anything anymore. What I've come to understand\nin 16 years of being a mayor, is that it is not about what I think as a person, about my opinions,\nTable 2.

Instead, it's all\nabout my social skills and about bringing people together.\nGenerally, the municipal council does quickly blow the whistle on mayors who do attempt to\ndevelop their own political vision in the same way as their fellow members on the executive\nboard. And to the extent that providing guidance is an important task for Dutch mayors as\nindicated by the survey results, focus group discussions and interviews indicate that, rather\nthan taking the substantive lead in developing a strategic vision, Dutch mayors push the\nprocess of vision-making as `social integrators' (Contractor et al., 2012). Rather than of the\nindividualist and visionary kind, mayors' involvement in the political decision-making is of a\nparticularly facilitative and collective kind. This is because the Dutch local political culture\nleaves little room for mayors to single-handedly develop strategic policy direction. During one\nobserved meeting a local council member stated: `A real mayor does not propose solutions'.\nRather, she expected the mayor to follow in the footsteps of the municipal council. In another\nmeeting, an alderman argued: `Mayors should not take up a position in substantive debates\naround any policy issue, certainly not outside of the board of mayors and aldermen. And\nvoicing a political opinion outside of city hall is absolutely not done.'\nWe believe that such expectations are typical for the Dutch consensus-oriented context\nand are antithetical to the expectations that many local political leaders face in Anglo-\nAmerican contexts. At the very least, they are contradictory to the decide-and-accomplish\nexpectations that many Anglo-American scholars place on local political leaders\n(e.g., Barber, 2013; Giuliani, 2002). The recent introduction of stronger, directly elected\nexecutive mayors in many European counties other than the Netherlands has reinforced\nthese expectations (Steyvers et al., 2008; Elcock, 2008). In that sense, the Dutch mayoralty\nmay bear some resemblance to the older, largely ceremonial role of the English Lord Mayor\nor that of the Irish `Cathaoirleach'. At the same time, the Dutch mayor does have substan-\ntially more executive responsibilities than the latter.\nAlso in relation to society, Dutch mayors cannot be described as typically strong, decide-\nand-accomplish leaders in the Anglo-American sense of the word. When asked how mayors\nsee their role in relation to society, Dutch mayors report that they identify most with being a\n`first citizen', `liaison' and `representative' (Table 3). Mayors see themselves acting primarily\nas a non-partisan and non-political `burgervader' (literally: `father of the citizens'), that is\nsort of a quasi-monarchal figure who looks after citizens in an enlightened-paternalist way.\nThe second most important role for the Dutch mayor is that of `verbinder', or liaison,\nmeaning a person who brings together people and who establishes and maintains good\nworking relations between them (Svara, 1987). This role emphasis is also typical for\nDutch mayors in their role as chairmen of the municipal council and the executive board\n(Karsten et al., 2014). Thirdly, Dutch mayors see themselves as the spokesmen for their\nmunicipalities, again in a non-partisan and non-political way. Ninety percent of the mayors\nwho participated in our study selected one of these three roles as their primary role emphasis\nout of the eight roles offered in the survey. If we also include their secondary role emphasis\nthis figure rises to 98 percent. This paints a clear picture of the Dutch mayors as a non-\npolitical, non-partisan actor who acts as a bridging-and-bonding leader (Denters, 2006).\nThis finding is supported by the fact that, in contrast, the visionary role is seen as being of\nlow importance for Dutch mayors; only 1.2 percent of the office holders see this as their most\nimportant role out of the eight roles offered in the survey. In addition, contrary to what was\nexpected, mayors rarely saw themselves in the role of ombudsperson, despite this role being\ntraditionally linked to the Dutch mayoralty and also to the office of the mayor in other\ncountries (Kj\u00e6r, 2015; Klinkers et al., 1982). The participants in the focus groups explained\nthis finding by arguing that an ombudsperson generally has to form a judgment in a conflict,\nwhereas a mayor should remain impartial at all times, which also fits nicely with the non-\ndecision-making role of the Dutch mayor. In focus-group discussions, mayors also expressed\ndoubts about their role as a `moral leaders', not because they did not see themselves as\nproviding moral guidance, but mainly because of their aversion to the language of leader-\nship. These discussions, again, underline the linguistic dimension there is to the aversion to\nthe leadership principle in the Netherlands. Admittedly, standard deviations and interquar-\ntile ranges show that the uniformity in mayors' opinions is lowest as regards the moral\nleadership role, indicating the existence of substantial differences in opinion. Some\nmayors, thus, are more inclined to see themselves as moral leaders. Several other roles\nincluded in our survey show considerable dispersion too, but the overall picture of a brid-\nging-and-bonding rather than visionary leader is a quite clear one.\nIn our survey, when asked about the sources of authority Dutch mayors draw from when\nperforming their roles as an office holder, the office holders indicated that they see their\n`position above and between political parties' as the most important source of their political\nauthority. More than two-thirds of our respondents included this particular authority source\nin their personal top five, out of the fourteen plausible sources offered, and more than\n20 percent saw it as their most important source of authority. The phrase `above and\nbetween political parties' is typically Dutch, and is one of the prime examples of the\nunique Dutch vocabulary of political leadership. It is hard to translate its full meaning to\nEnglish. By approximation, what this phrase signals is mayors' all important independence\nfrom party politics and their non-involvement in political decision-making.\nDutch mayors' desire to adopt a non-political stance, that is act as politically independent\nliaisons rather than as strong local leaders, also because the socio-political context expects them\nto do so, produces the paradoxical situation where 99 percent of all Dutch mayors are members\nof political parties but many of them are very wary of being labeled as a representative of a\nparticular political party (Karsten et al., 2014). Out of the fourteen plausible sources offered,\npolitical party membership is seen to be the least important authority source for Dutch mayors.\nIt is included in their personal top five by only 4.53 percent of mayors, and then only as fourth of\nTable 3.

The following quote of Amsterdam mayor Van der Laan gives a clear\nillustration of mayors' wariness towards being seen as a party-political figure: `As long as I'm a\nmayor, I [will act as if I] have no affiliation with any political party' (cited in Cohen, 2013: 23).\nThis view expresses the widely shared conviction that Dutch mayors should try to avoid taking\nsides at all costs, as this is crucial to their ability to exercise bridging-and-bonding leadership.\nThe language of Dutch mayoral leadership. As discussed above, there is also an important\nlinguistic dimension to mayors' aversion to the notion of leadership. When describing their\nactivities in relation to both the administration and society in focus-group discussions and\ninterviews, Dutch mayors frequently used rather awkward alternatives for the word\n`leiderschap' that sometimes not even exist in the Dutch language. One of these is `begelei-\nderschap' (Karsten et al., 2014), which translates best to `guiding leadership'. In one of the\nfocus groups, a mayor expressed his heart-felt discomfort with being called a `leading figure'\nin local government and euphemistically described the role he played in local government\nusing a sports metaphor: `being on the sidelines, but not off side'.\nOur lexical analysis shows that when the verb `to lead' occurs in job vacancy text for\nmayors, it is most often used in the formal and neutral meaning of chairing the municipal\ncouncil and the executive board. The words `leadership' in the meaning of being a fron-\ntrunner, or lexical variants thereof, occurs in only 9 percent of the job vacancy texts. Hence,\nsome municipal councils express a desire for a powerful and decisive figure, but this is only\nthe case in 18 out of 202 vacancies. By comparison, the word `begeleiderschap', which counts\nas a softened alternative to the word `leadership', occurs in 11 percent of the vacancy texts.\nThus, when seeking for a new mayor, municipal councils are hesitant to use the word\n`leadership' in the heroic meaning of the word and frequently use consensus-oriented alter-\nnatives that describe the guiding role that the Dutch mayor has.\nThe language of Dutch mayoral leadership is riddled with softened terms for different\nleadership roles that avoid the word `leadership' itself, such as `burgervader' (first citizen,\n`pater civitas'), `primus inter pares' (first among equals), `oliemannetje' (catalyst), and `pro-\ncesbegeleider' (process manager). Other terms associated with the Dutch mayoralty do\ninclude linguistic variants of the word `leadership', but use softening adjectives such as\n`slow leadership'. Expressing the same idea, one of the official training courses for Dutch\nmayors is entitled `invisible leadership' and educates mayors in their bridging-and-bonding\nleadership role as it is performed `behind the scenes' (Dutch Association of Mayors, 2015).\nThe leadership dilemma for Dutch mayors. The linguistic aspect of the aversion to leadership\nis just one expression of the paradoxical leadership expectations that Dutch mayors are faced\nwith and that may be typical of democratic leadership as such, and of bridging-and-bonding\ntypes of leadership in particular: Dutch mayors are expected to provide guidance, but not to\nlead from the front (see also Kane and Patapan, 2012). To repeat, they are expected to\ndevelop a political vision and to give policy direction but at the same time they are deemed to\nnot take the substantive lead and to take a non-political stance. The following quote from a\nmayor also gives a clear illustration:\nMany municipal councils, like mine, have asked their mayors to develop a strategic vision for the\nmunicipality. But, when push comes to shove, they do not like the mayor taking the lead. Some\npeople even say that the mayor is the best-paid civil servant of the municipality, but then one\nthat cannot do anything. Some mayors feel deeply frustrated with this [paradox].\nWhat Ruscio (2008) describes as the `leadership dilemma' is thus particularly acute for Dutch\nmayors. They are forced to avoid the language of leadership and the presumption of preva-\nlence, while they face expectations to provide headship and guidance at the same time.\nTo honour these paradoxical leadership expectations, Dutch mayors can best operate\nbehind the scenes. Rather than proposing solutions themselves, for example they are\nbetter off `continually asking the right questions', as one mayor expressed his thoughts in\nan interview.\n`Democratic guardianship': A characterisation of Dutch mayoral leadership\nIn reaction to the above, one possible response could be: `If Dutch mayors are not called\nleaders and cannot act as frontrunners, then maybe they are not leaders'. Such a rejoinder,\nhowever, does not do justice to the crucial role that Dutch mayors play in local government\nand that clearly is a practice of leadership, but maybe not of the decisive and individualistic\nThe practice of leadership as it is enacted by the Dutch mayor is one where the `leader'\nplays a crucial role in producing good governance (Kane and Patapan, 2014; Rhodes and\n`t Hart, 2014). Dutch mayors increasingly take up a role of guardians of local democratic\nprocesses and of the quality of local decision-making (Karsten et al., 2014). In our survey,\nmayors report that their most important day-to-day activities in relation to both the muni-\ncipal council and the executive board are `safeguarding the quality of local decision-making'\nand `safeguarding the ethics and integrity of the local administration' (Tables 1 and 2). One\nof the ways in which mayors execute this role is by organizing and institutionalizing reflective\nprocesses. They, for example organize reflective sessions with councilors on the culture of\nethics within the local administration (Karsten et al., 2014). Scholars such as Heifetz (1994)\nrecognize the crucial importance of such a leadership role in public as well as private\norganizations. National law has attributed to the Dutch mayor some formal responsibilities\nin this field, but this leadership role of the mayor is also deeply ingrained in the local\nadministrative culture in the Netherlands. The mayoral office is traditionally associated\nwith values such as integrity, impartiality and procedural justice, which is believed to be\nan important base for the authority of its holders (Karsten et al., 2014).\nTypical for the role of Dutch mayors is that they have been assigned a more explicit\nformal responsibility to `advance the ethics and integrity of the local administration' in 2016,\nwhile this is not accompanied by any formal powers. The successful fulfilment of this new\nresponsibility is, therefore, fully dependent on the informal authority of Dutch mayors. Such\na practice, on the one hand, mirrors the weakness of the statutory position of the Dutch\nmayor and, at the same time, shows the legislator's trust in the mayors' ability to act as\ninformal leaders behind the scenes.\nBecause of their unique role in local government, Dutch mayors typically care more about\n`process values' \u00ad procedural fairness, transparency and responsiveness \u00ad than about `sub-\nstantive values' (Bobrow and Dryzek, 1987). Their role is to bring people together and to unite\nthem over fair democratic processes, with mayors being the politically independent guardians\nof those. This is also why Barber's emphasis on the getting-things-done attitude of mayors\ndoes not very accurately represent the nature of mayoral leadership in the Dutch context.\nThere are, are of course, many alternative notions of leadership that can be very useful in\nanalyzing leadership phenomena that are similar to the role that is executed by the Dutch\nmayor. We, however, would like to argue that most of these conceptions, some of which\nhave become very popular among scholars when describing the transformation of contem-\nporary local political leadership, miss out on important aspects of the role of the Dutch\nmayor too. The cherished facilitative-leadership concept, for example, ascribes an important\ndirection-providing role to leaders that Dutch mayors lack notably (Greasley and Stoker,\n2008). Likewise, neither the `laissez faire leadership' concept (Bass and Bass, 2008) nor the\n`servant leadership' concept (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006) are very well applicable in the\nDutch context since the Dutch mayoralty does have its own agenda. Mayoral leadership in\nthe Netherlands is neither a follower-serving nor value-neutral type of leadership. `Being\npolitically independent is not the same as being neutral', a clerk illustrated this point in an\nobserved meeting. Instead, Dutch mayors do actively strive for realizing valued outcomes,\nbut these should be perceived in terms of process values rather than in terms of substantive\nvalues. Then again, the ethical-leadership concept is too narrow to capture all the different\naspects of the role that Dutch mayors play in monitoring the democratic process.\nCollective understandings of leadership, such as the shared-leadership concept, may be\nmore suitable for developing our understanding of leadership in consensus democracies (for\nan overview, see Contractor et al., 2012). Some of these, however, focus primarily on the\nwho-question of leadership (e.g. Gronn, 2009). The case of the Dutch mayor, however, draws\nparticular attention to the what-question of leadership (what do leaders do?) since it high-\nlights the importance of an alternative leadership task, that is guardianship, which is under-\nexplored in the mainstream political leadership literature. We believe, therefore, that a more\nsuitable alternative conception of leadership is required to accurately describe the leadership\nrole of the Dutch mayor, for which we propose the term `democratic guardianship'.\nWe recognize that the concept of `democratic guardianship' is in some ways paradoxical.\nDrawing from the seminal work of Dahl (1989) one might argue that the role of the guar-\ndian, with supposedly superior knowledge and virtue, is antithetical to democracy. We\nbelieve, though, that the case of the Dutch mayor shows that democratic guardianship is\na real and valued possibility in practice (see also Kane and Patapan, 2014; Teles, 2015).\nIt can even be argued that some of the essentially non-democratic characteristics of the\nDutch mayoral office, the role of the Crown in the selection of mayors in particular, make an\nimportant contribution to making democratic guardianship possible in practice. This is\nbecause the growing influence of the directly elected municipal council on the selection of\nthe Dutch mayor has politicized the mayoral office and has made mayors more vulnerable to\npolitical processes. These developments has caused tensions within in the mayoral office that\nhamper office holders' abilities to act as democratic guardians because they harm their poli-\ntical independence (Karsten et al., 2013). In contrast, at least in a symbolic way, the Crown\nappointment reaffirms the independence of Dutch mayors from party politics, which is an\nimportant source of authority for them in acting as a democratic guardian (Karsten et al.,\n2014). This is not to say, though, that the necessary political authority and institutional\nindependence that support the democratic guardianship cannot be achieved by other means.\nOther expressions of bridging-and-bonding leadership\nIn support of other more critical leadership scholars (e.g., Collinson, 2014; Schedlitzki and\nEdwards, 2014), the aim of this article is to give in-depth insight into an alternative to the\nheroic \u00ad wilful, decisive, rather masculine \u00ad perspective on political leadership. We have\nhighlighted the Dutch mayoralty as a clearly contrasting case of bridging-and-bonding\nleadership that is consonant with consensus democracy. We dubbed its specific type of\nleadership `democratic guardianship'. There are, however, also other empirical expressions\nof bridging-and-bonding leadership in the context of consensus democracy, albeit of a some-\nwhat different form. In the scope of this article, there is no room for additional in-depth\ntreatment, but we will briefly present two other empirical variants, as these are insightful\nnational and supra-national examples that complement the sub-national case of the mayor-\nalty: the presidents of Switzerland and the European Council.\nThe President of the Swiss Confederation operates in an institutional context which\nLijphart (1999), in his seminal book Patterns of democracy, categorized as a strong expres-\nsion of consensus democracy. The logic of power-sharing and power-dispersal dominates the\nentire system; it even incites and supports the well-developed referendum culture in\nSwitzerland (Linder, 2010; Papadopoulos, 2001). In the Swiss system, compromising and\ncoalition building among political rivals has been institutionally fixed. The desire to maintain\nsolidarity in diversity has led to the creation of an intimate complex of consultation, accom-\nmodation and integration. The distribution of seats in the federal executive between the four\ndominant political parties, for example follows a standard formula \u00ad 2:2:2:1.\nThe Swiss federal executive works on a strictly collegial, power-sharing and equalizing\nbasis. The seven-member Federal Council is viewed as the collective head of state. Formally,\nthere is a Swiss President who chairs the Federal Council, but (s)he is typically the primus\ninter pares, not vested with any special powers or prerogatives. The Presidency \u00ad and even\nthe Vice-Presidency \u00ad is kept in check by a system of annual rotation. Every year another\ncouncillor serves as the acting President. As such, the President of the Swiss Confederation\nhas a rather weak position (Kriesi and Trechsel, 2008: 69\u00ad80). Its institutional set-up is\nfunctional in bridging and bonding the linguistic, social and political sub communities\nthat make up the divided Alpine country, not in producing executive leadership of the\ndecide-and-accomplish type which is deemed `strong' in the traditional Anglo-centric\ninterpretation.\nThe European Union is also an institutional system in which power is distributed and must\nbe shared. There are a great number of mechanisms aiming to prevent smaller countries from\nbeing overpowered by bigger countries or substantial minorities from being drowned out by\nsimple numerical majorities. Compared to the early days of the European Union, the unani-\nmity requirements have been toned down, but in the present-day European Union governing\npower remains a fragmented commodity. Therefore, in Lijphart's (1999) distinction between\nmajoritarian and consensus democracy, the European Union is clearly positioned on the\nconsensual side. Owing to its modus operandi, the EU is considered by many as a distant\nand expertocratic system of governance, which tends to be multi-actor and multi-level in a way\nthat obscures the distribution of responsibility and accountability (Scharpf, 1999). In a\nfamous quip, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is believed to have said: `Who\ndo I call if I want to speak to Europe?', signalling a perceived lack of EU leadership.\nThe current Presidency of the European Council must be understood against this back-\ndrop. In 2014, Donald Tusk, former prime-minister of Poland, succeeded Herman van\nRompuy, who had served as the European Council's first President between 2009 and\n2014. From the beginning, the Anglo-American press has derisively pictured the EC\nPresident as a sorry figure: not popularly elected, but appointed by, and thus dependent\non, the chiefs of the national governments of the member state, the German chancellor and\nthe French president in particular; not forceful or charismatic \u00ad while Tony Blair was\navailable, the first President appointed to set the tone was Herman van Rompuy, well-\nrespected in Belgium (itself a consensus democracy in the extreme) but little-known\nbeyond. Reality is more nuanced. The EC Presidency is not as powerful as its American or\nFrench counterparts, but it is not as nominal as the Swiss version either. It lies somewhere in\nbetween, at best playing a role as bridge-builder, connecting actor or `political plumber' \u00ad to\nrepeat a phrase used by Van Rompuy. In terms of leadership, such a role is more facilitative\nthan decisive, but certainly not irrelevant or ineffective. In the fragmented reality of\nEuropean politics, the EC Presidency plays a crucial role in the getting together of the\nacts and tendencies of various powerful others (Van Esch, 2016).\nThese additional examples show that bridging-and-bonding leadership - as opposed to\ndecide-and-accomplish leadership - is not confined to the particular case of the Dutch\nmayor. It can be found at (supra)national levels of governing beyond the particular\nDutch context.\nConclusion and discussion\nWe have argued in this article that the traditional Anglo-centric notions of decisive leader-\nship, which, notwithstanding the welcome rise of more critical conceptions, continue to\ndominate the study of political leadership, do not adequately capture crucial aspects of\nthe bridging-and-bonding type of leadership that is more common in consensus democracies\nin significant parts of continental Europe. Democratic theory suggests that the supportive\ncontext of consensualism is even more widely dispersed, with the European Rhineland as\nperhaps the best-known but certainly not the only breading ground: important parts of Asia\nand Africa are also sensitive to an alternative, bridging-and-bonding understanding of\nThe case of the Dutch mayor provides us with a theoretically and empirically salient\nalternative to decide-and-accomplish leadership in the form of `democratic guardianship'.\nDutch mayors show how deliberately not giving substantive policy direction and adopting a\nnon-political stance can be crucial aspects of effective leadership. In addition, the Dutch\nmayoralty shows that monitoring the quality of local decision-making and safeguarding the\nethics and integrity of the local administration can be important leadership roles in a demo-\ncratic context. Such roles cannot be captured accurately when using the English language of\nstrong leadership (Jepson, 2010; Teles, 2015). This language is not particularly sensitive to\nthe process-oriented aspects of important leadership roles in consensus democracies.\nThis decide-and-accomplish bias in studying leadership sometimes leads to undesirable\nmisunderstandings about the role of leaders in a consensus context, for example, them being\ndescribed as `non-leaders' (e.g., Hayward, 2008; Kellerman, 2014), whereas they perform\nvaluable but underexplored leadership tasks (Van Esch, 2016). Further, some of the pivotal\nguardianship roles that leaders play in consensus democracies have not yet gained a promi-\nnent place in the established literature on leadership tasks. We believe that there is plenty of\nroom to increase the `theoretical sensitivity' towards such phenomena (Tummers and\nKarsten, 2012). This, in turn, can improve leadership studies' abilities to help leaders in\nconsensus democracies, and indeed elsewhere, deal with some of the unique challenges that\nthey face on a day-to-day basis.\nIn our understanding of Dutch mayoral leaders, we join a growing body of literature now\nemerging from Anglo contexts that challenges the heroic notion of leadership and that\nhighlights the collective, non-decisive aspect of leadership (e.g., Collinson, 2014; Gronn,\n2009; Schedlitzki and Edwards, 2014). At the same time, we believe that this strand of\nresearch can be further developed by studying the specific democratic leadership functions\nthat frontrunners fulfil in consensus democracies because these tend to remain undertheor-\nOne of the reasons for the existing mismatch between leadership theory and practice is\nthat the international language of leadership encounters active resistance when it is used in a\nconsensus context. Again, the Dutch mayoralty provides an insightful case because it is has\ndeveloped a language of leadership that bypasses the word `leadership' without necessarily\nrejecting the leadership phenomenon altogether. Rather, it has redefined some of the core\nleadership tasks, changing the focus from substantive values to process values.\nWhat is required, therefore, is more than rhetorical innovation alone. It is also a recali-\nbration of the leadership concept itself, as to give more room to bridging-and-bonding and\nprocess-oriented forms of leadership in addition to its already well-covered decide-and-\naccomplish expressions. In this article, we have suggested that in the case of the Dutch\nmayor the term `democratic guardianship' provides a viable and acceptable alternative.\nThis concept adequately captures Dutch mayors' practical ability to usefully unite guardian-\nship and the democratic ethos in the function of good local governance. In one dominant\nstrand of democratic theory, this might seem a paradoxical concept, as it essentially holds\nguardianship to be at odds with democracy (Dahl, 1989). The study of leadership in con-\nsensus democracies, thus, also requires a recalibration of some of the theory of democratic\nleadership (Hendriks and Karsten, 2014).\nWhile emphasizing theoretical relevance of the case, we fully recognize that the Dutch\nmayor is only one particular example of a bridging-and-bonding leader out of the many\nthat are available. Within the confines of this article, we could provide brief additional dis-\ncussions of just a few. Further exploration is required of how the different expressions of\nbridging-and-bonding leadership compare in different contexts (see also Contractor et al.,\n2012). As it is, the Dutch mayoralty already poses considerable challenges to the current\nAnglo-centric debate on global governance, in which mayors are ascribed a decisive role.\nAdditional research could also usefully answer remaining questions about (a) the proliferation\nof bridging-and-bonding types of leadership in different democratic contexts, (b) how brid-\nging-and-bonding leadership interacts with the ambiguous call for stronger, individualistic,\ndecide-and-accomplish leadership it is facing, and (c) what good governance practices thrive\nunder the guidance of bridging-and-bonding leadership in different cultural and institutional\ncontexts and (d) what democratic guardianship implies in various democratic contexts.\nAlthough our analysis of the Dutch mayoral office provides only a starting point for this\nline of research, it does already clearly underline the need for broadening our conceptions of\nleadership beyond the traditionally heroic notions and for developing additional languages of\nleadership, some of which may even want to avoid of the word `leadership' itself.\n"
