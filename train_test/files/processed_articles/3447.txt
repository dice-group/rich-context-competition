Inclusion criteria were: age between 40\u00ad70 years\nold, previous diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and\nhypertension, and office systolic blood pressure (BP) \n130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP  80 mmHg. We excluded\npatients with secondary hypertension, resistant hyper-\ntension, insulin therapy, Stage 4 or 5 of chronic renal dis-\nease, previous myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular\naccident, history of transient ischemic attack, heart failure\nStage C or D, atrial fibrillation, malignant ventricular\narrhythmias, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease,\nretinopathy with visual loss, nephrotic syndrome and\nsymptomatic neuro-pathy. All patients accepted by written\ninformed consent. The hospital ethics committee approved\nStudy design\nThe study was a randomized, open label, clinical trial with\ntwo treatment arms (Figure 1). In Visit 1, all patients were\nrolled over for amlodipine 5 mg once a day (q.d.). After 6\nweeks (Visit 2), we conducted BP measurements, and tests\nto evaluate vascular stiffness and endothelial function.\nFigure 1. Flowchart of participants throughout the study. BP, blood pressure.\nVenous blood was sampled for the biochemistry and\nC-reactive protein (CRP) assays.\nPatients with systolic BP  130 mmHg and/or diastolic\nBP  80 mmHg were randomized to benazepril 10 mg q.d.\nor losartan 50 mg q.d. Patients were randomized by the\nmethod of `randomly permuted blocks'. The randomiza-\ntion was not stratified and was done by an independent\ninvestigator. Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals to\nadjust BP (Visit 3 and Visit 4). We titrated the benazepril to\n20 mg q.d. and losartan to 100 mg q.d., for those patients\n25 mg q.d. was added, if necessary, to control BP. In\nVisit 5 (at 12 weeks) study patients had repeats of the\nvascular tests, laboratory assays and BP measurement.\nHypoglycemic drugs dosages were rigorously maintained\nthroughout the study. We checked adherence each visit, by\ntablet counting. We considered patients had good compli-\nance when they had taken more than 80% of expected drug\ndoses for the study period.\nBlood pressure measurement\nOffice BP was obtained using an electronic device (model\nHEM-705CP, Omron Healthcare, Lake Forest, IL, USA)\nand an appropriate-sized cuff. Before measurement,\npatients were seated for 30 min and refrained from smok-\ning and caffeine ingestion. Three readings were done 1\nmin apart and the average of these measurements was\ndefined as the patient BP.\nAssays\nFasting venous blood was collected to measure total cho-\nlesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (HDL-C), glucose, glycated hemoglobin (by\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), creati-\nnine (by an enzymatic method) and uric acid. The low-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was calculated\nby the Friedewald formula. The glomerular filtration rate\nwas estimated (eGFR) by modified Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease (MDRD) study equation (Equation 1):\nWe also measured CRP by nephelometry (BN II, Siemens\nAG, Munich, Germany), and morning urinary spot albumin\nand creatinine by nephelometry (Immage, Beckman Coulter,\nFullerton, CA, USA). The lower detection limit for CRP\nwas 0.02 mg/dL. Values for microalbuminuria were consid-\nered normal, if up to 30 mg/g creatinine.\nVascular tests\nAll vascular tests were performed in the morning, in the\nsupine position, after a minimum of 10 min rest in a quiet,\ntemperature-controlled room. Patients were requested to\nfast; and to abstain from tea, coffee, alcohol and smoking\nfor 12 h. The study and other morning medication were to\nbe taken 1\u00ad2 hours before measurements. The vascular\nequipment operator was blinded to the patients' treatment.\nBrachial flow-mediated vasodilation\nImaging studies were performed according to recent guide-\nlines.16,17 Endothelial-dependent (flow-mediated) vasodila-\ntion was measured using a 10 MHz high-resolution\nultrasound (Vivid 3, General Electric Healthcare,\nMilwaukee, WI, USA). Vessel diameters were analyzed on\nfrozen longitudinal images over the right brachial artery,\n2\u00ad5 cm above the antecubital fossa. Three measurements\nwere taken for three cardiac cycles at the end of diastole\n(R wave on the electrocardiogram (EKG)), and then the\nmean was calculated. Ischemia was induced by inflating\nthe cuff 50 mmHg above the patient's systolic BP, for 5\nmin. The maximal vessel diameter was recorded at 30, 60\nand 90 seconds after cuff release; and we expressed the\npercentage of change over to basal diameter as FMD.\nPulse wave velocity\nPulse waves were obtained using a Complior SP device\n(Alam Medical, Vincennes, France), with transducers\nplaced in the regions of the right carotid artery, right radial\nartery (crPWV), and right femoral artery (cfPWV).18 Two\nmeasurements were made: The mean was used for analysis.\nWhen the difference was > 0.5 m/s, a third measurement\nwas made: That median was then considered for analysis.\nDetermination of central aortic pressure\nPulse waves of the right radial artery were obtained using an\napplanation tonometer (model SPC-301-Millar Instruments,\nHouston, TX, USA), calibrated according to the brachial\nartery pressure. Pulse wave analysis was performed to obtain\ncentral aortic pressures and other hemodynamic parameters,\nusing the SphygmoCor system (Atcor Medical, Sydney,\nAustralia). The system's software calculates the central sys-\ntolic BP, central pulse pressure (PP), augmentation pressure\n(AP) and both augmentation index (AIx) andAIx adjusted to\nheart rate (HR) of 75 beats per minute (AIx@HR75). AIx\nrepresents the percentage of central pulse pressure caused by\nthe early return of the reflected wave in the aortic root and it\nis calculated using a validated mathematical transfer func-\ntion. Two measurements were made, and when differences\nwere > 10%, a third measurement was made. The mean of\nthe measurements was used for analysis.\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as median (interquartile range (IQR))\nfor numerical variables and frequency distribution for\n970 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\ncategorical variables, unless otherwise specified. The\nMann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests were used to\ncompare, respectively, the numerical and categorical\nvariables between groups; and the Wilcoxon signed-rank\ntest was used to compare variables before and after treat-\nment. We used previous studies of FMD in similar popu-\nlations to estimate sample size.19 Assuming an alpha\nerror of 5% and a standard deviation (SD) of 3.5%, we\nhad 14 patients in each group with 80% power to detect\na 4% difference in FMD between groups, by the end of\nthe study. We used Statistica 12 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK,\nUSA) for database management and statistical analysis.\nResults\nStudy cohort\nA total of 47 patients were included and 30 of these were\nrandomized to treatment arms (Figure 1): 14 to the\nbenazepril group and 16 to the losartan group.

Some recent studies, con-\ntradicting initial reports, suggest that angiotensin-2\nreceptors might contribute to vascular fibrosis.22 We\ndesigned this trial to compare the effects of benazepril and\nlosartan, an ACEi and an ARB, respectively, on endothe-\nlial function and vascular stiffness, in patients with Type 2\ndiabetes mellitus and hypertension. Our findings sug-\ngested that hypertensive diabetic patients using benazepril\nhave a greater reduction in CRP and a slight improvement\nin flow-mediated vasodilation than have those taking\nlosartan. Moreover, these effects occurred despite similar\nBP reduction.\nCRP is an important inflammatory biomarker in ath-\nerosclerosis and is related to leukocyte adhesion mole-\ncules, tissue factors and monocyte recruitment to the\narterial wall.21 Moreover, it has prognostic significance:\nHigher levels are related to worse cardiovascular out-\ncomes.23 Rosei et al.24 compared candesartan and enal-\napril in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes\nmellitus. These authors find no statistical difference in\nCRP concentration between ACEi and ARB. Likewise,\nSchram et al.25 do not observe differences when\nTable 2.

Koulouris et\nal.26 observe that both ramipril and telmisartan lead to a\nreduction in CRP, but there was no difference among\nthese drugs.\nTo our knowledge, the present study was the first one to\nshow a greater reduction of CRP with ACEi, when com-\npared to ARB. We suppose that this finding may be related\nDuring clinical consultation, we tried to exclude other\npotential causes of an elevated CRP, such as infections and\nrheumatic diseases. In addition, we looked for use of sali-\ncylic acid and statins, which were the same between\ngroups. The elevated baseline CRP in both groups may\nhave facilitated showing even small differences in the\neffects of ACEi and ARB.\nImpaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation is a pre-\ndictor of cardiovascular events, according to studies in\npopulation-based adults27,28; and it is related to atheroscle-\nrosis risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mel-\nlitus.29 Three recent meta-analyses with hypertensive\npatients show that both ACEi and ARB improve FMD,\nwhen compared to placebo or no treatment, but there is no\ndifference among them.13\u00ad15 Eight trials compare ACEi to\nARB, but only one shows a higher FMD response with\nACEi.14,30 There were no head-to-head comparisons of\nACEi and ARB in diabetic patients.\nFlammer et al.19 observe that losartan is better than ate-\nnolol in improving FMD, in hypertensive diabetic patients.\nYilmaz et al.31 report that valsartan and valsartan plus\namlodipine obtain higher FMD than amlodipine mono-\ntherapy, in a similar population. Three trials of ACEi ver-\nsus placebo or no treatment have failed to show significant\nFMD improvement in mixed populations that included\ndiabetic patients.32\u00ad34 To date, there has been no rand-\nomized trial concerning the effects of ACEi on FMD,\nexclusively in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our\nresults suggested that there might be an improvement in\nbrachial FMD with benazepril use, an effect not observed\nin the losartan group.\nArterial stiffness is recognized as a predictor of\nincreased cardiovascular risk and PWV is considered the\ngold standard procedure to measure it. A meta-analysis\nshows that an increase in PWV by 1 m/s corresponds to a\n15% increase in cardiovascular mortality.35 Shahin et\nal.36 carried out a meta-analysis to study the effects of\nACEi on PWV and they conclude that these drugs reduce\nPWV by 1.69 m/s, when compared to placebo. Most stud-\nies are able to demonstrate that ARB reduces PWV, when\ncompared to placebo.37\u00ad39 Moreover, the effects of ACEi\nand ARB on arterial stiffness seem to be independent of\nBP reduction40; however, only four trials compare ACEi\nto ARB and they do not find any difference in PWV\nstudies include diabetic patients. Our study was the first\none to compare ACEi and ARB on PWV in diabetic\npatients and it showed there was no difference in this\nparameter.\nCentral pressure waveform methods analyze the inter-\naction between arterial wall properties and the left ventri-\ncle. Some authors propose them as prognostic indexes of\nobserve that ACEi reduces AIx, when compared with\nother antihypertensive drugs. There are also reports of\nOnly one trial compares ACEi to ARB: These drugs have\nthe same effect on AIx,39 although it did not include dia-\nbetic patients. In our study, central systolic BP, central\npulse pressure, AP and AIx were also similar in both\ngroups.\nThis trial had some important limitations. First, despite\nrandomization, the ACEi group had a lower baseline FMD.\nWe do not know if this influenced a better FMD response in\nthis group. Second, despite statistical power calculation,\nour sample size was small and so these findings should be\nconfirmed in trials including more patients, as small differ-\nences in PWV and central pressure waveform analysis\ncould be missed. Regarding PWV, 12 weeks could also be\na short time to observe antihypertensive drugs' effect on\narterial stiffness.\nConclusions\nIn summary, taking benazepril led to lower CRP and a\nslightly higher FMD response, when compared to losartan\nin hypertensive diabetic patients with BP not controlled by\namlodipine. Most hypertension guidelines recommend\nACEi or ARB as first-line therapy in diabetic patients with\nhigh BP; however, the mechanism of action of these drugs\ndiffer, and this may have laboratory and clinical conse-\nquences. Future clinical trials with a head-to-head com-\nparison and larger samples are necessary, to elucidate\nwhether the differences between ACEi and ARB have\nprognostic relevance.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Brazilian agencies CNPQ\n(National Council for Research and Technology, grant\nReferences\n1.
