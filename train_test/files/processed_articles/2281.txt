Tob Control\n Introduction Mentholated cigarettes are at least as\ndangerous to an individual's health as non-mentholated\nvarieties. The addition of menthol to cigarettes reduces\nperceived harshness of smoke, which can facilitate\ninitiation. Here, we examine correlates of menthol use,\nnational trends in smoking menthol and non-menthol\ncigarettes, and brand preferences over time.\nMethods We estimated menthol cigarette use during\nold from the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health.\nWe adjusted self-reported menthol status for selected\nbrands that were either exclusively menthol or non-\nmenthol, based on sales data. Data were weighted to\nprovide national estimates.\nResults Among cigarette smokers, menthol cigarette\nmenthol use was associated with being younger, female\nand of non-Caucasian race/ethnicity. Among all\nadolescents, the percentage who smoked non-menthol\nsmoking rates remained constant; among all young\nadults, the percentage who smoked non-menthol\ncigarettes also declined, while menthol smoking rates\nincreased. The use of Camel menthol and Marlboro\nmenthol increased among adolescent and young adult\nsmokers, particularly non-Hispanic Caucasians, during\nthe study period.\nConclusions Young people are heavy consumers\nof mentholated cigarettes. Progress in reducing youth\nsmoking has likely been attenuated by the sale and\nmarketing of mentholated cigarettes, including emerging\nvarieties of established youth brands. This study should\ninform the Food and Drug Administration regarding the\npotential public health impact of a menthol ban.\nINTRODUCTION\nSmokers of mentholated cigarettes are just as likely\nto experience premature morbidity and mortality as\nsmokers of non-mentholated varieties,1 even\nthough menthol smokers smoke fewer cigarettes\nper day than do smokers of non-mentholated\nbrands.2 3 The cooling properties and flavour of\nmenthol make these cigarettes less harsh to smoke,4\nwhich can facilitate the transition from experimen-\ntation to more regular use and addiction.5 6\nConsistent with evidence that young smokers\nprefer flavoured cigarettes,7 studies of adolescent\nand adult smokers find the highest prevalences of\nmenthol cigarette use among 12\u00ad17-year-old\nsmokers compared to older smokers and among\nmiddle school smokers when compared with high\nschool smokers.5 8\u00ad10 A recent National Survey on\nDrug Use and Health (NSDUH) report on menthol\nsmoking showed that trends in past month menthol\nMenthol cigarette use appears to be more common\namong more recent initiates, suggesting a role as a\nstarter product for youth.4 5 11 Menthol may facili-\ntate nicotine addiction. Several studies report\nincreased nicotine dependence among adolescent\nmenthol smokers compared to non-menthol\nincrease oral absorption of nicotine in an animal\nTobacco Control Act16 gives the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) authority to issue tobacco\nproduct standards if deemed `appropriate for the\nprotection of public health'.16 The Act required the\nFDA to ban fruit, candy, or clove characterising fla-\nvourings in cigarettes in September 2009 to reduce\nyouth smoking initiation.17 The Act did not ban\nmenthol flavourings at that time. Rather, it directed\nthe FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory\nCommittee (TPSAC) to review the scientific evi-\ndence on the impact of the use of menthol in cigar-\nettes on the public health, including such use\namong children, African\u00adAmericans, Hispanics and\nother racial and ethnic minorities. TPSAC con-\ncluded in its July 2011 report that `removal of\nmenthol cigarettes from the marketplace would\nbenefit public health in the USA'.18 TPSAC's con-\nclusions were based in part on analyses of 2004\u00ad\ndata to examine correlates of menthol use, trends\nin the prevalence of smoking menthol and non-\nmenthol cigarettes in the USA, and changes in pref-\nerence for various mentholated brands across sub-\ngroups and with increased precision.\nMETHODS\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health\nThe NSDUH is a nationally representative survey\nthat assesses tobacco, alcohol and drug use beha-\nviours in the US civilian, non-institutionalised popu-\nlation that is 12 years old. It is administered to a\nsample of the US population living in households.\nRespondents include residents of non-institutional\ngroup quarters, such as college students living in\ndormitories, civilians residing on military bases, and\npersons living in group homes, shelters and rooming\nhouses. The NSDUH is sponsored by the Substance\nEditor's choice\nScan to access more\nfree content\nResearch paper\ngroup.bmj.com\nhttp://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/\nDownloaded from\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nCross-sectional surveys administered annually from 2004 to\n2010 were used to estimate the prevalence of menthol use\namong current smokers and among the entire population.\nNSDUH respondents are selected using a multistage probability\nsample. Most interviews are conducted in the respondents'\nhomes by trained interviewers. To decrease misclassification bias,\ndrug use questions--including tobacco questions--are adminis-\ntered by audio computer-assisted self-interviews (A-CASI). The\nCurrent cigarette smoking in the NSDUH was assessed by\nasking respondents who had ever smoked whether they had\nsmoked part or all of a cigarette in the previous 30 days. Those\nwho responded affirmatively were subsequently asked to report\nthe brand of cigarettes they smoked most often. They were able\nto select and verify their usual brand from 2 lists with a total of\nOnce respondents selected and verified one of the brands on the\nscreen, they were subsequently asked, `Were the <CIGFILL>\ncigarettes you smoked during the past 30 days menthol?' (Note:\n`<CIGFILL>' was replaced by the computer programme with\nthe name of the brand the respondent had previously reported\nand verified as having smoked most often.) Approximately 95%\nof smokers selected a brand from the lists offered. The remain-\ning 5% were asked, `Were the cigarettes you smoked during the\npast 30 days menthol?'\nPrior research has demonstrated under-reporting of menthol\nstatus of exclusively menthol brands (eg, Newport, Salem), par-\nticularly among adolescent smokers.2 5 21 This has been raised\nas a particular concern for estimates of menthol use among\nyoung Black smokers.21 Because of concerns about misclassifica-\ntion, especially among adolescents (see online supplementary\ntables S1 and S2), we used sales data22 to classify major brands\nfor which at least 99% of sales were menthol or non-menthol.\nSales data were incorporated for 2008 grocery, drug and mer-\nand convenience stores, as well (see supplementary Appendix).\nIncorporating a method of Hersey and colleagues,5 if a respond-\nent reported usually smoking Newport and also reported on the\nmenthol question that the usual brand was non-menthol, the\nrespondent's response to the menthol variable question was\nrecoded as menthol. A similar adjustment was made for exclu-\nsively non-mentholated brands. All results reported here use this\nadjustment process. We note that the overall prevalence trends\nobserved here were also observed with unadjusted data.11\nStatistical analyses\nWe used SAS V\n.9.2 for all analyses. The SAS survey procedures\ntook into account NSDUH's complex survey design. Survey\nweights were used to adjust for different probabilities of selec-\ntion and for non-response, producing estimates representative of\nthe US population. Due to small cell sizes, we restricted some of\nour analyses to the three largest racial/ethnic groups:\nnon-Hispanic Caucasian, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic.\nwho were aged 12 years and older to assess patterns of menthol\nuse among smokers by age, gender, race/ethnicity, household\nincome and the number of days smoked during the previous\n30 days. Differences in point estimates were assessed using non-\noverlapping CIs. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to\nassess patterns of use in a multivariable model.\nolder to estimate the prevalence of smoking menthol and non-\nmenthol cigarettes in the US population. These estimates were\nage group by gender and race/ethnicity. The significance of the\ntime trends was tested using a t test of the slope coefficients.\nThis was performed separately for menthol and non-menthol\ntrend lines. The difference between menthol and non-menthol\ntime trends was estimated by including an interaction term in\nthe model. The interaction term enabled us to estimate separate\nslopes for menthol and non-menthol trend lines. We tested the\nsignificance of the interaction coefficient using a t test of the\ninteraction coefficient.\nWe also compared data on 43 616 smokers surveyed during\nence. Our intention in this analysis was to contrast the 3 earliest\nyears of the study with the 3 latest years. Including data from\n2007 would have resulted in an unbalanced analysis.\nDifferences in use of various brands over time were tested using\nthe z test of two independent binomial proportions.\nA note on terminology\nBelow we refer to persons aged 12\u00ad17 years old as adolescents,\nadults. We refer to non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects as\nCaucasians, non-Hispanic Black subjects as Blacks and\nnon-Hispanic Asian subjects as Asians.\nAdditional details on the methods used and results are pre-\nsented in the online supplementary appendix.\nRESULTS\nAge differences in menthol cigarette use among current\ncigarette smokers\nTable 1 presents overall and age-specific data on the use of men-\ngender, race/ethnicity, household income and the number of days\nsmoked during the previous 30 days. Menthol use was most preva-\nlent among adolescent smokers overall (56.7%, representing 1.2\nmillion smokers) and consistently high across all subgroups exam-\nined. Prevalence of menthol use was next highest among young\nadult smokers overall (45.0%, representing 5.2 million smokers)\nand in most subcategories.

Although an age gradient was not observed among\nBlack smokers, young Black smokers were more likely than\nthose in other racial/ethnic groups to smoke menthol cigarettes.\nPreference for menthol cigarettes by young people likely occurs\nbecause of marketing practices24\u00ad27 and product formulation.28\nAnalyses of tobacco industry documents confirm that young\nsmokers may pursue mentholated brands for anticipated pleas-\nure and may experience more pleasure and less harshness from\nmentholated brands than from non-mentholated varieties.26\nOur data, which include the 12\u00ad15-year-old age category,\ncontrol for household income and adjust for misclassification of\nmenthol status, expand the knowledge base on this topic.\nSecondly, differential progress has been observed, with the\nprevalence of smoking non-mentholated cigarettes declining\nrelatively more rapidly than that of mentholated cigarettes.\nIncreasing use of menthol relative to non-menthol cigarettes\namong adolescent and young adult Caucasians and young adult\nHispanics is especially concerning, given the large numbers of\nyoung people in each of these racial/ethnic groups. Increased\nuptake of menthol cigarettes may have contributed to the\nslowing of the decline of adolescent smoking that has occurred\nFinally, there have been increases in use of several major\nmenthol cigarette brands overall and specifically, among youth\nsignificant declines in Salem cigarette use across all age groups\nhave been countered by dramatic increases in the use of Camel\nmenthol, Marlboro menthol and Newport cigarettes. For\nexample, among adolescents, Camel menthol use increased by\n4.4% points and Marlboro menthol use increased by 5.5%\npoints during the study period. It is important to note that\nMarlboro and Camel made stronger gains in the adolescent and\nyoung adult markets, particularly so in Caucasians and\nHispanics, than Newport. This is consistent with evidence from\ntobacco industry documents showing that several major tobacco\ncompanies manipulated the levels of menthol in certain cigarette\nbrands to be closer to the low menthol levels in Newport and to\ntarget younger smokers.28 Increased use of several menthol\nbrands among young smokers have also been influenced by the\nintroduction of new products, including Marlboro Milds\nthe impact of menthol marketing efforts that have been targeted\nto African\u00adAmericans and women,31\u00ad34 including the marketing\nof Camel No. 9 which was shown to target adolescent girls.35\nGiven high rates of internet and social media use among adoles-\ntobacco marketing may also play an important role in use of\nparticular brands among young smokers.39 40 We believe it is\nimportant for the FDA to monitor cigarette marketing for all\nbrands targeted to all demographic subgroups via channels such\nas magazines, social media, the internet and direct mail, with\nparticular attention to differentiating specific brand characteris-\ntics such as menthol.41\nKahnert and colleagues at the German Cancer Research\nCenter have documented the recent spread, to at least 38 coun-\ntries, of cigarette brands with menthol capsules in the filters.42\nThese new products enable users to change the flavour during\nthe smoking process from regular to menthol. Their marketing\ntargets young people. Tobacco companies involved include\nBritish American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International, Philip\nMorris and RJ Reynolds, and in the US, these products are mar-\nketed as `Camel Crush' and `Marlboro NXT'. In July 2013, the\nEuropean Union moved to ban menthol and flavoured cigar-\nettes; while the FDA has already banned flavoured cigarettes, it\nrecently called for more scientific information prior to deciding\non a menthol ban.\nThis study is limited in several ways. First, the definition of\nmenthol use is based on brand preference. We did not estimate\nthe number of mentholated and non-mentholated cigarettes\nsmoked during a period of time by each smoker. Rather, we esti-\nmate the menthol status of the brand smoked most often.\nConsistent with our findings, market share of menthol increased\nduring the study period.43 Second, we measured prevalence of\nuse and not incidence of initiation. However, prevalence in\nyoung people is largely driven by initiation rather than migra-\ntion, cessation, or death. Third, we did not assess sales data\nprior to 2008. Nevertheless, brands such as Kool, Newport and\nSalem have long been classified as mentholated brands.22\nFinally, our data (table 1) indicate that the use of menthol cigar-\nettes among older smokers was less common than among ado-\nlescent and young adult smokers. It is impossible to discern\nsmokers switched away from menthol cigarettes as they aged.\nThe findings might simply indicate higher rates of menthol use\namong more recent birth cohorts.

The trend analyses reported here raise\nimportant concerns about the deleterious effects of the sale and\nmarketing of mentholated cigarettes on progress in reducing\nyouth smoking.

Concerns about menthol cigarette use in the USA have\npreviously focused on Blacks, who primarily have smoked\nNewport cigarettes in most recent years.2 The data presented\nhere also raise concerns about the increasing use of Camel\nmenthol and Marlboro menthol cigarettes among Caucasian\nand Hispanic youths. Data from this study should be used to\ninform the FDA's decision-making processes regarding the\npotential public health impact of a menthol ban and to raise\nconcern in multiple countries about the marketing of menthol-\nated cigarettes, particularly to young people.\nWhat this paper adds\n This study provides more precision than previous research on\nthe use of mentholated cigarettes among young people. In\nthe multivariable model, menthol use was found to be most\nmultivariable analysis also controlled for household income,\ntaking socioeconomic status into account.\n Previous work addressed trends in the percentage of\ncigarette smokers who smoked menthol cigarettes. This\nwork presents trends in smoking menthol and non-menthol\ncigarettes among all persons (not just cigarette smokers) in\neach of the demographic categories examined, permitting\nthe conclusion that non-menthol cigarette use is declining\nmore rapidly than menthol cigarette use.\n Finally, the paper documents the rise of Camel Menthol and\nMarlboro Menthol brands among young people, particularly\nCaucasians and Hispanics. The information presented here\nshould be useful to the US Food and Drug Administration\nand also to many other countries, where menthol cigarettes\nare being marketed to young people.\nAuthor affiliations\n1Department of Community Health and Health Behavior, School of Public Health\nand Health Professions, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York,\nBuffalo, New York, USA\n2The Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at Legacy,\nWashington, District of Columbia, USA\n3Department of Health, Behavior and Society, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School\nof Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA\n4Biostatistics, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n5Department of Research and Evaluation, Legacy, Washington, District of Columbia,\nUSA\n6Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Lombardi\nComprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, District of Columbia, USA\nCorrection notice This article has been corrected since it was published Online\nFirst.
