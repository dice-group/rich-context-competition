    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent studies have found mixed results regarding the association between leukocyte telomere\nlength (LTL)--thought to be a marker of cellular aging--and all-cause mortality. Some studies have\nreported a significant inverse relationship, but others have not, perhaps in part owing to insufficient\npower. We examine the relationship using data from a nationally representative sample of older\nTaiwanese (54+ in 2000), which is larger (n = 942) than most previous studies, and which includes\ncomprehensive information on potential confounders including white blood cell distribution and\ninflammatory markers. Results from a Cox hazards model demonstrate a small, but significant,\nassociation between LTL and mortality that is independent of age, sex, and lifestyle factors. White\nblood cell distribution, especially the proportion of neutrophils, is an important predictor of LTL;\nhowever, the association between LTL and mortality changes little controlling for white blood cell\ndistribution. In contrast, the association between LTL and mortality weakens considerably (by\n48%) after adjustment for inflammatory markers and homocysteine. Our results suggest that the\nrelationship between short telomeres and mortality is tied to inflammation and homocysteine.\nLongitudinal studies are needed to explore bidirectional influences resulting from the fact that\ninflammation leads to shorter leukocyte telomeres, which in turn results in senescence, which\nexacerbates inflammation.\n",

Cell senes-\ncence is believed to contribute to aging (3), which has led to the\nhypothesis that telomere shortening has a causal effect on mortal-\nity. Alternatively, shorter telomeres might be simply an indicator of\nother processes that affect aging and mortality. Scientists generally\nagree that shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with\nolder age, male sex, Caucasian race, and possibly atherosclerosis\n(4,5). However, there is controversy regarding the association of LTL\nwith other diseases of aging and with mortality, and the crucial ques-\ntion of whether shortening of the telomeres is a cause or a symptom\nof aging remains unanswered.\nWe have identified 13 studies that investigated the relation-\nship between LTL and all-cause mortality in population-based\nsamples: five found a significant inverse relationship (longer LTL\nwas associated with lower mortality) (6\u00ad10); the other eight did\nnot (11\u00ad18). Among three other studies based on twin samples,\nonly one found a significant inverse association (19\u00ad21). Given\nthe substantial variation in LTL between individuals of similar age\nand health status, a large sample is required to draw meaningful\nconclusions (22). Only 5 of these 16 studies comprised at least\nthese five reported a significant inverse association between LTL\nand mortality.\nThe extent of adjustment for potential confounders also varied\nconsiderably across the 16 studies. Many factors can influence both\nLTL and mortality (Figure 1), confounding the association between\nLTL and mortality and contributing to misleading results. The most\nconsistent predictors of LTL are age, sex, and race (5). Other fac-\ntors that have been shown, albeit inconsistently, to influence LTL\ninclude lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity, alcohol\nconsumption, psychological stress, and socioeconomic status, as\nwell as biological factors (eg, obesity, hypertension, cholesterol) and\ninflammatory markers (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6] and C-reactive pro-\ntein [CRP]) (5). The mechanisms that link these factors with LTL\nare complex and not completely understood. As shown in Figure 1,\ntelomeres shorten because of cell replication and oxidative stress,\ntwo biological processes that are direct consequences of chronic\ninflammation (23). Thus, factors that lead to chronic inflammation,\nsuch as obesity and smoking, could indirectly cause telomere short-\nening. Importantly, however, telomere shortening can also cause\ninflammation via the induction of senescence. Cells with critically\nshort telomeres enter senescence, a state of permanent replication\narrest in which cells secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines,\nchemokines, growth factors, and proteases known as the senescence-\nassociated secretory phenotype (3). Thus, the relationship between\ninflammation and LTL is likely to be bidirectional: telomere short-\nening leads to inflammation via the senescence-associated secretory\nphenotype, and chronic inflammation contributes to further tel-\nomere shortening via oxidative damage and faster turnover of leu-\nkocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. Lifestyle and biological health\nrisk factors could contribute to this deleterious cycle at different lev-\nels (eg, producing chronic inflammation or oxidative stress) that are\ndirectly or indirectly linked to telomere shortening. However, these\nfactors may also affect aging and mortality via alternative pathways\nindependent of telomere shortening. For example, lifestyle factors\ncan lead to chronic systemic low-grade inflammation and, in turn,\noxidative stress, both of which can\u00adindependently of their effects\non telomeres\u00adproduce metabolic syndrome, deoxyribonucleic acid\ndamage, and endothelial dysfunction that contribute to cardiovascu-\nlar disease and other diseases of aging (24\u00ad26).\nThus, adjusting for confounders is fundamental to understanding\nthe true association between LTL and mortality. Only 5 of the prior 16\nphysical activity, obesity, alcohol use, socioeconomic status, inflamma-\ntion, glucose, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Because inflam-\nmation may be a consequence of telomere shortening, controlling for\ninflammation may lead to an underestimate of the overall effect of\nLTL on mortality. On the other hand, failure to control for inflam-\nmation may result in an overestimate of the effect of LTL because of\nconfounding.\nThe distribution of leukocyte (white blood cell [WBC]) subtypes\nmay affect LTL because LTL measurement is essentially a weighted\naverage across a mix of different cell types. Although highly corre-\nlated, different WBC subsets have different telomere lengths (27\u00ad29).\nThe distribution of WBC subsets varies with age and other factors\nsuch as the presence of acute infection or underlying disease. Thus,\ndifferences in the distribution of WBC subtypes could confound the\nresults. For example, someone who is ill is likely to have a very high\nproportion of neutrophils. Because neutrophils tend to have longer\nFigure 1. Conceptual model for the study of leukocyte telomere length and mortality.

Yet,\ndespite longer LTL, s/he may have a higher risk of mortality owing\nto underlying illness that increases the risk of death even while it\ninflates LTL (via its effect on the WBC distribution). None of the\nprior population-based studies adjusted for the distribution of WBC\nsubtypes as a potential confounder.\nIn this study, we use data from a nationally representative sam-\nple of older Taiwanese to investigate the association between LTL\nand all-cause mortality. This dataset offers a large sample with a\nof whom died over 11 years. We control for the distribution of WBC\nsubtypes (ie, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils,\nbasophils) as well as other potential confounders including demo-\ngraphic characteristics, lifestyle and biological health risk factors,\nand inflammatory markers. We have made a comprehensive effort\nto identify the possible biological associations between these factors,\ntelomere length, and mortality, as represented in Figure 1. This inte-\ngrative approach coupled with rigorous modeling has allowed us to\ndetermine the main predictors of LTL and to analyze and interpret\ntheir confounding influences on the association between LTL and\nmortality.\nMethods\nData\nThe 2000 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study com-\nprises a nationally representative sample of persons 54 and older in\nTaiwan, selected randomly using a multistage sampling design with\noversampling of older persons (71+) and urban residents (30). In\n1,023 of whom also completed a physical examination. Exam par-\nticipants did not differ significantly from nonparticipants in ways\nlikely to introduce serious bias (31). Details regarding response rates\nare provided elsewhere (30). The study protocol was approved by\nhuman subjects committees in Taiwan and at Georgetown University\nand Princeton University.\nOn a scheduled day several weeks after a household interview,\nparticipants collected a 12-hour overnight urine sample (7 pm to 7\nam), fasted overnight, and visited a nearby hospital the following\nmorning where medical personnel drew a blood specimen and took\nblood pressure and anthropometric measurements. Compliance was\nextremely high: 96% fasted overnight and provided a urine speci-\nmen deemed suitable for analysis.\nSurvival status was ascertained by linkage to the Death\nCertificate file maintained by the Taiwan Department of Health and\nto the Household Registration file maintained by the Ministry of the\nInterior. After excluding 47 respondents who were missing LTL and\nanother 34 individuals with missing data for a covariate, the analysis\nsample comprised 942 respondents (322 of whom died by December\nMeasures\nAverage LTL\nLeukocyte deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted by Union Clinical\nLaboratories (in Taiwan) using trimethyl ammonium bromide salts\n(dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and cetyl-trimethyl-ammo-\nnium bromide). LTL, represented by the telomere-to-single copy gene\n(T/S) ratio, was measured at the University of Washington, using\nquantitative polymerase chain reaction with a few modifications\nfrom the method originally developed by Cawthon (32,33) (see\nSupplementary Material for details).\nPotential confounders\nWe adjusted for a range of potential confounders that prior stud-\nies suggest affect LTL and are likely to affect mortality. These con-\nfounders (shown in bold italics in Figure 1) can be divided into four\ncategories: demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, inflam-\nmatory markers, and other biological parameters. Demographic\ncharacteristics included age and sex. Lifestyle factors comprised\nsmoking history, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and educa-\ntional attainment. Inflammatory markers included WBC count and\ndistribution, IL-6, CRP, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1\n(sICAM-1), and soluble E-selectin. We adjusted for the distribution\nof WBC subtypes using the percentages of monocytes, neutrophils,\nbasophils, and eosinophils; % lymphocytes served as the reference\ngroup. IL-6 had an extremely skewed distribution; log-transformed\nvalues improved model fit. The remaining biological parameters\nincluded obesity, pulse pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,\nglucose metabolism, homocysteine, and insulin-like growth factor\n1 (IGF-1). Obesity was measured by body mass index and a quad-\nratic term was included to allow for the well-established nonlinear\nassociation with mortality (34). Pulse pressure was measured as the\ndifference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and glucose\nmetabolism as the level of glycosylated hemoglobin. Homocysteine\nis a nonprotein -amino acid found in blood that is an indicator\nof cardiovascular disease (35). IGF-1 promotes proliferation, cell\ngrowth, and survival. Low levels of IGF-1 are associated with short\ntelomeres and with age-related diseases (36,37).\nAnalytical Strategy\nIn the initial stage of analysis, we examined the predictors of LTL\nwith four nested linear regression models. First, we adjusted for sex,\nage, and, in order to compensate for the sampling design, urban resi-\ndence. Next, we added the distribution of WBC subtypes. Third, we\nadded education and smoking history, which we consider to be exog-\nenous predictors (ie, unlikely to be a consequence of LTL). Finally,\nwe added the remaining behavioral and biological measures, which\nmay be endogenous (eg, both a cause or consequence of LTL owing\nto the fact that short telomeres lead to inflammation and illness that,\nin turn, affect behavior and biomarker levels). Although lifestyle fac-\ntors are likely to influence LTL via their effects on inflammation and\nother biological processes (as shown in Figure 1), it is impossible to\nestablish the causal direction in a cross-sectional study. For example,\nsick people are less likely to exercise and may abstain from alco-\nhol consumption because of their illness. These effects can inflate\nthe apparent association between behavior and mortality. Thus, we\nadd potentially endogenous confounders to the model last because\nthe inclusion of endogenous variables would bias the coefficients\n(including the one for LTL).\nIn the second stage, we examined survival as a function of LTL.\nFirst, we calculated survival curves by long versus short LTL, split\nat the median. Next, we estimated a Cox hazards model with age\nas the \"clock\" to predict age-specific death rates adjusted for poten-\ntial confounders. This modeling approach allows the underlying\nbaseline hazard over age to assume whatever functional form best\nfits the data (ie, the log hazard is not constrained to be linear over\nage). Because age is likely to be a stronger predictor of mortality\nthan duration of study, this model is superior to the conventional\napproach, which includes a control for age and uses duration of\nstudy as the time metric. Initial tests (data not shown) showed no\nsignificant evidence that the age slope of mortality varied by sex.\nHowever, because there was evidence of nonproportional hazards\nfor education (ie, the association with mortality was attenuated at\nolder ages), we modeled education as a linear function of age. The\nmodels were fit in five stages: the first four models follow the same\nstrategy described above for models predicting LTL; a fifth model\ndemonstrates that changes in the coefficient for LTL are attribut-\nable primarily to selected covariates. That is, because we observed\nan attenuation in the coefficient for LTL in model 4, we estimated\nmodel 5 to demonstrate the minimal set of confounders that account\nfor the attenuation.\nThe analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 (38). In all models,\nwe used the robust estimator of variance to correct standard errors\nfor clustering by primary sampling unit. In order to compare effect\nsize across predictors, we standardized (mean = 0 and SD = 1) each\nof the continuous measures prior to fitting the models.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics are shown in Supplementary Table S1.\nAs expected, LTL declines with age (correlation coefficient r = -.20,\np < .001, two sided, Supplementary Figure S1a). The distribution of\nWBC subtypes also varies by age: % neutrophils increases with age\n(r = .19, p < .001, two sided, Supplementary Figure S1b), whereas\n% lymphocytes declines with age (r = -.20, p < .001, two sided,\nSupplementary Figure S1c). Granulocytes (ie, neutrophils, basophils,\nand eosinophils) have longer telomeres than lymphocytes, particularly\nat older ages (28). Therefore, the shift to a higher proportion of neu-\ntrophils at older ages could attenuate the age-related decline in LTL.\nTable 1 shows the results from models predicting LTL. As\nexpected, LTL declines with age ( = -0.19, 95% confidence interval\nbution (Model 2), the age-related decline becomes slightly stronger\nated with longer LTL, whereas higher % eosinophils is associated\nwith shorter LTL. After adjustment for all covariates (Model 4), the\nsignificant predictors of LTL are age, neutrophils, and levels of IL-6.\nThe survival curves for the top versus bottom half of the LTL\ndistribution are presented in Supplementary Figure S2. Individuals\nwith longer LTL show a survival advantage relative to those with\nTable 2 shows hazard ratios (HRs) from models predicting age-\nspecific death rates. In the model that adjusts only for age, sex, and\nurban residence (Model 1),we find an inverse association between LTL\nment for WBC distribution (Model 2), the HR for LTL barely changes.\nInclusion of education and smoking history has no discernable influ-\nence on the coefficient for LTL (Model 3).Yet, with the addition of the\nremaining covariates (Model 4), the HR for LTL weakens (HR = 0.93,\ncompared with Model 2 (ie, the coefficient--which is the log of the\nattenuation is almost entirely attributable to the addition of inflam-\nmatory markers (particularly IL-6 and sICAM-1) and homocysteine:\nA comparison of Model 5 with Model 2 reveals that the addition of\nonly four variables (WBC count, IL-6, sICAM-1, and homocysteine)\nyields the same HR for LTL as in Model 4, which includes all the\ncovariates. Furthermore, by comparing Model 4 with Model 5, we can\ndeduce that adding the remaining variables has no effect on the HR\nfor LTL, even though some of those covariates (eg, body mass index,\nglycosylated hemoglobin) significantly predict mortality.\nWe find no evidence that the results are sensitive to the exclu-\nsion of outliers on the biomarker measures or to the specification for\nWBC distribution (see Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the\nassociation between LTL and mortality does not vary significantly\nby sex, age, or duration of study.\nDiscussion\nOur goal was to evaluate the strength of association between tel-\nomere length and mortality in a large cohort with long follow-up\nafter controlling for potential confounders including WBC distribu-\ntion and inflammatory markers. We found that shorter telomeres\nwere associated with mortality independent of age, sex, education,\nand smoking history, although the magnitude of the effect was\nsmall (ie, 12% reduction in the mortality hazard per SD of LTL).\nThe fact that we are able to detect such a small effect demonstrates\nthat the study has sufficient statistical power. While WBC distribu-\ntion, especially the proportion of neutrophils, was associated with\nLTL, the association between LTL and mortality changed little with\nadjustment for WBC distribution. Similarly, the relationship between\nshorter telomeres and mortality was independent of other factors\nincluding exercise, alcohol consumption, body mass index, high-\ndensity lipoprotein, glycosylated hemoglobin, pulse pressure, and\nIGF-1. However, the association weakened considerably (by 48%)\nafter controlling for inflammatory markers (particularly IL-6 and\nsICAM-1) and homocysteine.\nThe potential of LTL as a biomarker of aging has been the focus\nof heated debate (4,5). Discrepancies between studies are typically\nattributed to differences in techniques for measuring telomere length\nand lack of statistical power. Another fundamental reason for dis-\ncrepancy is the issue of confounding. LTL is the result of multiple\nenvironmental and biological factors that affect the individual (23).\nTwo prominent biological factors that influence average LTL are the\ndistribution of WBC subsets and the levels of inflammatory mark-\ners. While the association of LTL with inflammatory markers has\nbeen previously explored (39), the role of WBC distribution has been\nignored until recently (40).\nThe WBC distribution is a potential confounder of the asso-\nciations between LTL and aging outcomes because different WBC\ntypes have different telomere lengths and their distribution varies\nwith age, disease, and other factors. Granulocytes, which comprise\nmostly neutrophils, have longer telomeres than lymphocytes and a\nslower rate of telomere shortening (28). Moreover, their percentage\nincreases with age, as observed here, most likely due to a decrease\nof lymphopoiesis in the elderly (41). We find that higher % neutro-\nphils--and to some extent lower % eosinophils--are associated with\nlonger telomeres and, in the presence of controls for these factors,\nthe association between age and LTL increases slightly. Nevertheless,\ncontrolling for WBC distribution has little effect on the association\nbetween LTL and mortality, indicating that the association of shorter\ntelomeres with mortality is independent of the aging-related changes\nin WBC distribution. This result is consistent with a recent study of\ntelomere length in centenarians and their offspring (40).\nIn contrast, the relationship between LTL and mortality was\nattenuated after adjustment for inflammatory markers (eg, IL-6\nand slCAM-1) and homocysteine. Only 2 of the 16 population-\nbased studies that analyzed the association between LTL and\nTable 1.

So, this is a standardized coefficient (To create the quadratic term for\nBMI, we squared the standardized values for BMI.).\nTable 2.

Fitzpatrick and colleagues (9)\ncontrolled for IL-6 and CRP; Weischer and colleagues (7) con-\ntrolled for CRP only. Both studies found a significant association\nbetween LTL and mortality even after adjusting for inflamma-\ntion. The study of LTL in centenarians and their offspring also\nreported a relationship between LTL and survival after adjustment\nfor inflammatory and immune markers (IL-6, CRP, molar ratio of\nIGF-1 to IGF-binding protein 3, and cytomegalovirus serostatus),\nin addition to % lymphocytes (40). Attenuation of the association\nof LTL with mortality in our study but not in others may stem\nfrom our inclusion of several biomarkers (homocysteine, sICAM-\n1, and WBC count) that were not included in previous research.\nOur study highlights the importance of controlling for a compre-\nhensive set of confounders, especially markers of inflammation,\nand shows limited utility of LTL as a biomarker of aging, given\nthe small effect of shorter telomeres on mortality and its further\nattenuation with inflammation.\nThere are two possible explanations for the role of inflamma-\ntion and homocysteine in attenuating the relationship of LTL to\nmortality. On one hand, inflammation and homocysteine may be\nconfounders that influence both LTL and mortality (ie, the apparent\neffect of LTL on mortality may be partly spurious). On the other\nhand, they may mediate the link between LTL and mortality. The\nprevalent view in the literature supports the first scenario because\nchronic inflammation, which is a well-known feature of aging and\na predictor of early mortality (42), causes telomere shortening via\nan increase in leukocyte turnover and the production of oxida-\ntive stress, which directly accelerates telomere attrition (23). The\nalternative view, however, is also plausible because critically short\ntelomeres lead to replicative senescence, which induces chronic\ninflammation through the senescence-associated secretory pheno-\ntype (43). In the context of the immune system, senescent T cells,\nwhich accumulate in the elderly, have been well characterized. These\ncells have short telomeres, produce proinflammatory cytokines, and\nmay contribute to many age-related pathologies (44).\nThis problem of bidirectionality has largely been ignored in the\nliterature. Cross-sectional studies, such as this one, cannot distin-\nguish between the two potential effects. Thus, longitudinal studies\nshould be conducted to test whether inflammation predicts subse-\nquent changes in LTL over time and whether LTL predicts subse-\nquent changes in inflammation. However, if both prove true, then it\nwill be difficult to separate the two pathways.\nThe main strengths of this study are the large, nationally rep-\nresentative sample with long follow-up; the comprehensive set of\ncovariates; the rigorous measurement of LTL by quantitative poly-\nmerase chain reaction using appropriate controls and periodical\nreproducibility experiments; and the detailed statistical analysis,\nwhich used a hazard model that treats age rather than duration\nof study as the \"clock,\" tested sensitivity to the exclusion of outli-\ners and to specification of neutrophils, and reflected an integrative\ninterpretation of the processes depicted in Figure 1. The main weak-\nnesses include one-time biomarker measurements; limited number\nof deaths for cause-specific analyses; and lack of telomere measure-\nments by WBC type.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that shorter telomeres pre-\ndict mortality independently of the distribution of WBC, but this\nassociation is tied to inflammation. The complex pathways linking\nshort telomeres, senescence, and inflammation may underlie current\ncontroversies regarding the role of LTL as a biomarker of aging. The\nconceptual framework presented here could help to design and inter-\npret future studies that assess the role of LTL in aging and mortality.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplementary material can be found at: http://biomedgerontology.\noxfordjournals.org/\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute on Aging (grant\nShriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nHealth.
