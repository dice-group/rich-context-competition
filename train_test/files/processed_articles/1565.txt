This\npotentially affects 40 million adults in the United States.\nMethods: We used the same cross-sectional data on urinary arsenic\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to assess this\nevidence.\nResults: As in the earlier study, we found an odds ratio (OR) near 1.0\nfor diabetes, comparing the 80th versus 20th percentiles of urinary total\nincreased to above 3.0 when urinary arsenobetaine was added to the\nlogistic risk model. However, this high OR was a statistical artifact\nbecause arsenobetaine, which is ingested from fish and is essentially\nnontoxic, is a part of measured total urinary arsenic. These 2 variables\nare highly correlated (correlation  0.80). Because arsenobetaine is a\npart of total arsenic, it should first be subtracted from total arsenic rather\nthan being added to the statistical model. Doing so yields an OR of 1.15\nConclusion: These findings show no evidence of increased risk of\ndiabetes with arsenic exposure in this dataset. This underscores the\nimportance of valid statistical techniques and careful consideration\nof scientific plausibility when investigating low-concentration\nchemical exposures.\nArsenic is found in the environment in 2 general forms:\ninorganic and organic. Inorganic arsenic causes cancers\nof the lung, bladder, and skin, as well as skin lesions,\ncardiovascular diseases, and reproductive effects.1 Tens of\nmillions of people worldwide are exposed to inorganic ar-\nsenic, mostly from naturally contaminated drinking water.2 In\nthe United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has\nestimated that 25% of all public water systems have arsenic\nconcentrations between 5 and 10 g/L, with most of the\nremaining systems having lower concentrations.3 Inorganic\narsenic in the environment exists in 2 different valence states:\narsenous acid and arsenic acid. The metabolic pathway of\ningested arsenous acid and arsenic acid in humans is meth-\nylation, first to monomethylarsonic acid and then to dimethy-\nlarsonic acid,4 although the ability of people to do this varies\nwidely.5 Inorganic arsenic and its metabolites are excreted in\nthe urine, and the sum of their urinary concentrations is\ncommonly used to assess inorganic arsenic exposure.1\nExposure to organic arsenic comes primarily through\nthe consumption of seafood, and these forms are rapidly\nexcreted and believed to be nontoxic.6,7 The most common\nform of organic arsenic found in seafood and in human\nurine is arsenobetaine, although other organic arsenic com-\npounds (including arsenocholine and other arsenosugars)\nare also present.\nSeveral studies in populations exposed to high concentra-\ntions of inorganic arsenic in drinking water (mostly above 500\ng/L) have reported associations between these exposures and type\n2 diabetes mellitus (eTable; http://links.lww.com/EDE/A333).8\nCurrently, there is no clear evidence that this association also\noccurs at lower concentrations such as those commonly found\nin the United States. Recently, a published study reported an\nsubjects at the 80th percentile of urinary total arsenic con-\ncentrations compared with those at the 20th percentile.9\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), which is designed to provide a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of all noninstitutionalized people in the\nUnited States.

This finding was reported by\nmajor news outlets, including CNN, US News and World\nReport, and USA Today.10\u00ad12 However, if this result is not\ncorrect, then scientific attention, research resources, and public\nhealth concern could be inappropriately diverted from other,\nmore important issues.\nAnalyses of the health effects of inorganic arsenic using\nthat most subjects have very low urinary levels of inorganic\narsenic. Another complicating factor is the presence of uri-\nnary arsenobetaine and other nontoxic organic forms of\narsenic. In the aforementioned analysis of the NHANES\npeople with recent seafood consumption, and by calculating\nORs for type 2 diabetes mellitus and total urinary arsenic\n(organic  inorganic forms) using logistic regression models\nthat included arsenobetaine and mercury (another indicator of\nseafood consumption). This method could lead to an impor-\ntant error: arsenobetaine is a part of total arsenic and these 2\nvariables are highly correlated. Entering 2 highly correlated\nvariables into the same regression model can cause unstable\nresults and lead to incorrect conclusions.13\u00ad15 To avoid this\nproblem, we obtained an estimate of inorganic arsenic expo-\nsure by subtracting arsenobetaine from total arsenic. This\nmethod directly removes any effects that may be caused by\nthe most common form of organic arsenic. It also prevents\naberrant findings that may result from entering both total\narsenic and one of its major components (arsenobetaine) into\nthe same logistic regression model.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThe data for this study were obtained from NHANES\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and involving\n10,122 people who were selected using a multistage proba-\nlevels of total arsenic and various forms of inorganic and\norganic arsenic were analyzed in a representative one-third\nsubsample (n  2673) of subjects aged 6 years and older. The\nCenter for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.\nExclusion Criteria\nFor our study, the following exclusion criteria were\napplied. First, since our focus was on type 2 diabetes mellitus\n(which more commonly affects adults) we excluded 1062\nsubjects under the age of 20. Second, we excluded 584\nsubjects who did not fast for 8\u00ad24 hours before blood\ncollection, 38 women who were pregnant, and 34 subjects\nmissing arsenic speciation data. Third, we excluded 24 sub-\njects without serum glucose measurements and without a\nself-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fourth, we\nexcluded 133 subjects who reported seafood consumption in\ntheir first-day dietary survey, to reduce the contribution of\norganic arsenic in fish to total urine arsenic concentrations.\nThree subjects who had urinary arsenobetaine levels greater\nthan total arsenic levels were excluded as this would have\ncaused negative values for our estimates of inorganic arsenic.\nFinally, in the adjusted logistic regression analysis, 12 addi-\ntional people were excluded because of missing data on\ncovariates. These are the same exclusion criteria as in the\nprevious analysis9 except that we did not remove the 4\nsubjects with missing data on glycated hemoglobin (because\nwe did not analyze this variable), but we removed 3 addi-\ntional people with seafood consumption due to slight differ-\nences in how seafood was defined.\nLaboratory Analysis\nThe methods used to collect and perform all laboratory\nanalyses are detailed elsewhere.17 Briefly, spot urine samples\nwere collected from all subjects, and shipped on dry ice and\nstored frozen at 70\u00b0C.18 Total urine arsenic concentrations\nwere measured at the National Center for Environmental Health,\nusing inductively coupled-plasma dynamic reaction cell-mass\nspectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS) on a PerkinElmer ELAN DRC\nPlus or ELAN DRC II ICP-MS (PerkinElmer SCIEX, Concord,\nON, Canada). The concentrations of speciated arsenic were\ndetermined using high-performance liquid chromatography to\nseparate the species and ICP-DRC-MS for detection. The inter-\nassay coefficient of variation for bench quality control sam-\nples run throughout the study was 9.2% for total arsenic for\nlots with a mean total arsenic of 8.15 g/L. The interassay\ncoefficients of variation for bench quality control samples\nwith a mean arsenobetaine of 4.87 g/L and samples with a\ntotal arsenic, 1.2 for arsenous acid, 1.0 for arsenic acid, 0.4\nfor arsenobetaine, 0.6 for arsenocholine, 1.7 for dimethylar-\nsonic acid, and 0.9 for monomethylarsonic acid. Urinary\ncreatinine concentrations were measured using a Jaffe\n\u00b4 rate\nreaction and a CX3 analyzer (Beckman Instruments Inc,\nBrea, CA). Serum cotinine was measured using an isotope-\ndilution-high-performance liquid chromatography or at-\nmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spec-\ntrometric method, and serum glucose was measured using\na Beckman Synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter Inc, Fuller-\nton, CA).\nOther Data\nNHANES questionnaire data included self-reported in-\nformation on sociodemographic variables and on medical and\nsmoking history. Diet information was collected using a\n24-hour dietary recall, and seafood was defined as any food\nitem containing fish or shellfish. We defined people with type\n2 diabetes mellitus as those who reported they had been told\nby a health care professional that they had diabetes or who\nreported taking insulin or diabetic pills. Subjects who had a\nfasting serum glucose greater than 125 mg/dL were also\ndefined as having type 2 diabetes mellitus.21 This was the\nsame definition used in the earlier report.9\nStatistical Analysis\nBecause many subjects had levels of arsenous acid,\narsenic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid below detection\nlimits, the concentration of inorganic arsenic and its metab-\nolites was estimated by subtracting the concentration of the\nmeasured forms of organic arsenic (arsenobetaine and arseno-\ncholine) from the concentration of total arsenic. Earlier stud-\nies have shown that arsenobetaine makes up the majority of\norganic arsenic in most common seafood (the primary source\nof human exposure) and the majority of organic arsenic\nInitially, analyses were conducted of the relationship\nbetween diabetes mellitus and individual variables, including\ntotal arsenic, arsenobetaine, dimethylarsonic acid, estimated\ninorganic arsenic, and other factors that might be related to\ndiabetes or arsenic exposure. Similar analyses were done to\nassess the association between these variables and other\nfactors that may be related to diabetes or arsenic exposure.\nUsing logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs)\nand their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for type 2 diabetes\nmellitus and total arsenic, arsenobetaine, dimethylarsonic\nacid, and estimated inorganic arsenic. Variables were not\nlogarithm transformed because logistic regression does not\nrequire that the independent variables be normally distrib-\nuted, and logarithmic values may distort dose-response rela-\ntionships. As is standard in NHANES, the concentrations of\ntotal arsenic and arsenobetaine below the detection limit were\nassigned a value of the detection limit divided by the square\nroot of two. Assigning these a value of zero had little impact\non our results. Only 13 people had detectable levels of\narsenocholine, and so levels below detection were assigned a\nvalue of zero. We calculated unadjusted ORs and also ORs\nadjusted for potential confounding variables. These variables\nincluded age (years), sex, race (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican-American, other), education (high\nschool, finished high school, high school), body mass index\n(BMI; kg/m2), serum cotinine (ng/mL), urine albumin (g/\nmL), blood mercury (g/L), urinary creatinine (mg/dl), and\nthe use of blood pressure medications (current use self-\nreported as yes or no). We chose these variables because they\nhave been associated with the risks of diabetes or other\narsenic-related diseases, or with urinary concentrations of\nglucose or arsenic in other studies.1,23 Age, BMI, blood\nmercury, urinary creatinine, urinary albumin, and serum co-\ntinine were entered as continuous variables. Entering these as\ncategorical variables had little impact on results. Blood mer-\ncury and urine albumin had little effect and were removed\nfrom the final analyses. In the past, dividing urinary arsenic\nconcentration by urinary creatinine concentration was a com-\nmon way of adjusting for urine dilution.24 However, this can\nhave undesirable consequences, especially if creatinine is\nrelated to the outcome of interest. Because patients with\ndiabetes have lower creatinine levels than nondiabetics,24 we\ndid not use this adjustment. We initially entered creatinine as\na continuous variable in the logistic regression models but did\nnot include it in the final results since it had little effect on our\nfindings. This is consistent with several previous studies\nshowing that creatinine adjustment does not improve arsenic\nexposure estimates25\u00ad27 (creatinine-adjusted results are avail-\nable at: http://asrg.berkeley.edu/research.html).\nOdds ratios for the associations between type 2 diabetes\nmellitus and total arsenic, arsenobetaine, dimethylarsonic acid,\nand estimated inorganic arsenic were calculated for each tertile\nor quintile using the lowest tertile or quintile as the reference.\nThe previous analysis of these data9 calculated odds ratios using\nmodel-predicted odds at specific urinary arsenic levels. For\nexample, the odds ratio for the 80th versus 20th percentiles\nwas calculated as the odds predicted for a urine arsenic level\nat the 80th percentile cut-off point divided by the odds\npredicted for an arsenic level at the 20th percentile cut-off\npoint. We chose to base our comparison on actual arsenic\nexposure categories (eg, we compare the odds in all subjects\nabove the 80th percentile to the odds in all subjects below the\n20th percentile) because this allows presentation of easily\ninterpreted 2  2 table data and the development of odds\nratios based on actual data rather than model predictions.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver-\nsion 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and were done with\nand without incorporating the NHANES sampling weights.\nThese weights are used to produce unbiased national esti-\nmates, and reflect the unequal probabilities of selection,\nnonresponse adjustments, and adjustments to independent\npopulation controls.28 These weights had little effect on our\nresults. The results we present here are calculated without\nweights, because our goal was not to produce nationally\nrepresentative estimates of population characteristics but\nrather to assess a possible causal association.\nRESULTS\nOf the 2673 people with urine arsenic data in NHANES\ntotal of 98 met our criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus: 77 had\na self-reported diagnosis of diabetes and 21 were categorized\nas having diabetes based on their fasting serum glucose\nmeasurement. Of the 795 subjects, the percentage with levels\nbelow detection were: arsenous acid, 96%; arsenic acid, 93%;\ndimethylarsonic acid, 15%; monomethylarsonic acid, 65%;\narsenobetaine, 33%; and arsenocholine, 98%.\nTable 1 shows the number of people with and without\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus, and the means of the forms of\nEpidemiology \u00b7 Volume 20, Number 6, November 2009 Diabetes and Low Inorganic Arsenic Exposure\narsenic by age, sex, race, education, BMI, use of blood\npressure medication, and serum cotinine.

These levels are\nsupplemental table reviewing this previous research is avail-\nable at: http://asrg.berkeley.edu/.) The relatively modest rel-\native risks seen in these high exposure studies suggest that if\narsenic did increase the risk of diabetes mellitus at common\nUnited States exposure levels (ie, water concentrations less\nthan 10 g/L), this effect would be undetectable in epidemi-\nologic studies. Identifying associations where relative risks\nare expected to be low requires very large studies for ade-\nquate statistical power. It also requires very accurate data on\nexposure and potential confounders, which are more likely to\nhave important effects on study results and conclusions when\nrelative risks are low than when they are high.36 Because of\nthese issues, identifying an association between arsenic and\ndiabetes mellitus in a general low-exposure population is\nlikely not possible, even if the association were real.\ndata to investigate the health effects of arsenic is that only a\nsingle spot urine sample was collected from each subject.\nUrinary arsenic levels can vary over time within an individual\nif that person consumes water from different sources with\ndifferent arsenic concentrations. This is especially important\nin diseases such as diabetes, which may take years to develop.\nThe use of a single urine sample would lead to misclassifi-\ncation of arsenic exposure in some subjects. Similar bias\ncould also occur from inaccuracies in diagnosing diabetes,\nincluding errors in self-reported diagnoses or day-to-day\nvariability in serum glucose. Because information about dia-\nbetes and arsenic exposure were collected similarly in all\nindividuals, the resulting bias from these factors is most\nlikely nondifferential and thus toward the null. The use of\ncross-sectional data also raises questions about the temporal\nrelationship between diabetes and urinary arsenic, although\nwe are not aware of any data suggesting that diabetes causes\na change in arsenic excretion. In contrast, past studies linking\nhigh levels of arsenic and diabetes, in which arsenic exposure\nwas estimated mostly by using drinking water concentrations\nrather than urine, provide a fairly substantial body of evi-\ndence for the temporal relationship of high levels of arsenic\ningestion resulting in an increased prevalence of diabetes.\nInaccuracies may have also been introduced by the fact\nthat many subjects had levels of inorganic arsenic metabolites\nbelow detection. It is possible that our method of subtracting\narsenobetaine and arsenocholine from total arsenic to esti-\nmate inorganic arsenic did not remove all forms of organic\narsenic in some individuals. However, most evidence sug-\ngests that the remaining amount of organic arsenic is likely to\nbe small. Some types of seafood contain arsenosugars that are\ndistinct from arsenobetaine and arsenocholine, and some of\nthese are metabolized to dimethylarsonic acid in humans, but\nthese types of seafood (mussels, clams, seaweed, algae) are\nlikely eaten only rarely and only by a relatively small per-\ncentage of the general NHANES population. Thus, the effect\nof these on our results is likely to be small. Most evidence\nsuggests that arsenobetaine accounts for most of the organic\ntaine is excreted mostly unchanged in human urine and is the\nmost common organic form of arsenic in background samples\nof human urine.\nWe assessed the possibility that our estimate of inor-\nganic arsenic was inaccurate due to the presence of unac-\ncounted-for forms of organic arsenic, by calculating the\npercentage of total arsenic that was present as arsenous acid,\narsenic acid, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsonic acid,\ntrimethylarsine oxide, arsenobetaine, and arsenocholine. Ini-\ntially, in subjects who had levels of these metabolites below\ndetection, we assigned values that were at the level of\ndetection divided by the square root of 2. When this was\ndone, the sum of the individual inorganic and organic metab-\nolites was on average greater than 100% of the concentration\nof total arsenic. If measurements below detection are set at\nzero, this percentage averaged 75% (52% inorganic forms\nand 23% organic forms).\nThe finding that arsenobetaine adjustment causes a\nlarge change in the diabetes OR for total arsenic is consistent\nwith the R2 values for these variables. The R2 values we\ncalculated show that arsenobetaine accounts for 64% of the\nvariance in total arsenic but only 24% of the variance in our\nestimate of inorganic arsenic. The correlation between our\nestimate of inorganic arsenic and arsenobetaine is probably\nTABLE 3.

A\ncorrect analysis of the data shows there is no evidence of\nincreased diabetes prevalence with increasing urinary inor-\nganic arsenic in this dataset.\nIn summary, our analysis did not produce evidence that\nthe low levels of arsenic exposure commonly found in the\nUnited States are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThis result is consistent with previous studies on arsenic and\ndiabetes, which show mostly modest increases in relative risk\nat exposure levels that are much higher than found in our\nstudy.
