Current estimates suggest\ncurrently in methadone treatment (Fiellin, O'Connor,\nChawarski, Pakes, Pantalon, & Schottenfeld, 2001).\nNearly 10% of clients in methadone treatment are over\nthe age of 50, and more than one-third more are\nbetween the ages of 40 and 49 (U. S. Department of\nThe aging opiate-addicted cohort from the 1970s is\naltering the demographic characteristics of individuals\nin need of services for heroin addiction (Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n[SAMHSA], 2002) and will potentially put a strain on\nthe resources of treatment and clinical programs\n(Patterson & Jeste, 1999). As opiate-addicted individ-\nuals age, health problems may be exacerbated by age-\nrelated illness, social isolation, and general physical\ndecline and may require specialized medical ap-\nproaches. Understanding the service needs of this aging\npopulation of methadone clients will be critical in\neffectively serving this vulnerable older population.\nLimited research exists on the well-being of older\nindividuals addicted to opiates, and virtually no\nresearch specifically addresses the well-being of older\nmethadone clients. In a 33-year follow-up of male\nnarcotic addicts with a mean age of 57.4, Hser,\nHoffman, Grella, and Anglin (2001) identified high\nrates of health and mental health problems. Heroin\nabstinence was a particularly important factor in\ndetermining whether or not a respondent had a mental\nhealth problem.\nWhereas scant specific research on older heroin\naddicts and methadone clients exists, the aging and\nsubstance abuse literature provides important insights\ninto key variables for those individuals who are\nattempting to remain drug-free. For instance, sub-\nstance-abuse researchers identified retention in treat-\nment as being related to positive social support systems\nand lower levels of stress among some substance\nabusers (Dobkin, DeCivita, Paraherakis, & Gill, 2002;\nGainey, Wells, Hawkins, & Catalano, 1993). Yet, the\n1School of Social Work, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nAddress correspondence to Daniel Rosen, School of Social Work,\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2117 Cathedral of Learning, Pittsburgh, PA,\nspecific role of social support for addicted individuals is\nnotwellunderstood,andempiricalassessmentsinvolving\ndrug-addicted clients are scarce (Anderson, Dimidjian,\nEven after controlling for income and education,\nAfrican Americans appear to be less likely to use mental\nhealth and substance-abuse services than Whites\n(Snowden, 1999). Other studies of African Americans\nin methadone treatment reveal that African American\npatients are more likely to receive lower dosages of\nmethadone than their White counterparts (D'Aunno &\nPollack, 2002). Despite these variances by race, most\nresearch on the service needs of individuals addicted to\nheroin focuses on White men while ignoring racial and\nResearch on older methadone clients may provide\nuseful insight into other vulnerable aging populations\n(i.e., individuals with human immunodeficiency virus\n[HIV] or mental health disorders) who also will face\nage-related challenges. Previous studies on HIV con-\ncerns for injection drug users over the age of 50 have\nbeen funded by the National Institute on Aging and the\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (Anderson & Levy,\nexamined drug use in people over the age of 50\nidentified the relationship between aging, drug use, and\nfuture treatment needs.\nGiven the dearth of empirical evidence about the\nneeds and well-being of older methadone clients, the\ngrowing size of the population, and the potential\nimpact on service systems, the overall aims of this study\nare threefold: (a) to describe the life stressors of,\nexposure to illegal drug use of, and use of illegal drugs\nby older methadone clients; (b) to examine gender and\nracial differences in life stressors, exposure to illegal\ndrug use, and illegal drug use of these clients; and (c) to\nexamine the relationship between life stressors and\nexposure to illegal drug use in a methadone client's\nability to remain abstinent from illegal drug use.\nDesign and Methods\nSample\nThis analysis is a review of administrative data of\nclients at a methadone clinic in a small industrial city in\nthe midwestern United States. This study focuses on\na specific subsample of the larger administrative data\nsample. It focuses on a subsample of African American\nand White clients over the age of 50. Caseworkers\nconducted interviews in September 2002 as part of\na monthly assessment. The final sample size was 143.\nThe current analysis includes all study-eligible cases.\nThe sample was restricted to African American and\nWhite clients as the methadone clinic serves only these\npopulations. All respondents in the study were English\nspeaking. The decision to limit the sample to clients\nover the age of 50 was driven by an emerging body of\nresearch that focuses on this age range of illicit drug use\nin later life (Gfroerer, Penne, Pemberton, & Folsom,\nDemographic characteristics of the sample reveal\nof 50 and 60. Over two-thirds of the sample is male\n(69.9%), and slightly more than half the sample\nMeasures\nDemographic Variables.--Respondent's age, gen-\nder, and race were sociodemographic control variables\nused in the multivariate analysis.\nLife Stressors.--Variables that indicate economic\nwell-being and living situations were specified as life\nstressors. Economic well-being included whether a re-\nspondent was currently employed or receiving public\nassistance. Employment was defined as working either\nfull or part time at the time of the interview. Public\nassistance receipt was defined as currently receiving\nSocial Security Insurance or Social Security Disability\nor General Assistance. Unemployed clients who were\ncurrently looking for work at the time of the interview\nwere also considered to have a life stressor. Life\nstressors related to living situations included whether\na client was either temporarily staying with someone\nelse, living in a halfway house, or in a residential\ntreatment program.\nExposure to Drug Use in Social Networks and\nNeighborhoods.--Exposure to drug use referred to a\nclientwho hadeitheraromanticpartneror anonromantic\nadult member of the household who was involved with\nillicit drugs. Involvement with illicit drugs is defined as\nhaving a romantic partner or an adult member of the\nhousehold who is either currently abusing illegal drugs\nand/or currently in need of drug treatment. Clients also\nidentified whether or not they were currently living in\na place with either frequent or very frequent drug abuse or\ntrafficking. In addition, a dichotomous variable that\nreferred to any exposure to illegal drug use, which\nincluded a romantic partner and/or adult member of the\nhousehold with the above-mentioned substance abuse\nproblems and living in a neighborhood with drug abuse/\ntrafficking, was created.\nIllegal Drug Use in the Last Month.--The\nmethadone clinic conducted monthly urine tests to\nexamine whether or not a client had remained abstinent\nfrom illegal drug use in the last month. The results\nfrom these urine tests were coded ``0'' for no drug use\ndetected in the last month and ``1'' for the presence of\nbenzodiazepines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, or\nother illegal substances in the last month.\nAnalyses\nThe initial research question for this study examines\nthe demographic factors, life stressors, and exposure to\nillegal drugs and their relationship to an older\nmethadone client's ability to remain abstinent from\nillegal drug use (based on the results from monthly\nurine tests). Data were analyzed by using SPSS 11.0\n(Chicago, IL). Descriptive analyses were used to\npresent differences by both gender and race on the\nindependent variables. v2 tests were used for all\ncomparisons. A logistic regression was employed to\ntest the relationship between life stressors and a re-\nspondent's ability to remain abstinent from illegal drug\nuse in the previous month. The multivariate model\nadds in each of the independent variables related to life\nstressors (the various life stressors and exposure to\ndrug use) to determine which variables show statistical\nsignificance when controlling for demographic factors.\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive characteristics of\na sample of older methadone clients by both gender\nand race. Over three-fourths (84.6%) of the respond-\nents are between the ages of 50 and 60 years. Slightly\nmore than half (55.2%) of the respondents are African\nAmerican, and over two-thirds (69.9%) are men.\nRoughly one-third (30.1%) of the older methadone\nclients over the age of 50 had a positive urine drug\nscreen test in the last month.\nAlthough analyses by gender need to be interpreted\nwith some restraint, owing to the small number of\nwomen in some of the cells, there are some interesting\ndifferences that require further exploration. Women\nreceive public assistance than men. In addition, women\nwere nearly three times as likely (9.3% vs. 3.0%) to\nhave an adult member of their household in need of\ndrug treatment.\nThe cohort of respondents who were over the age of\n60 had three and a half times more African Americans\nthan Whites (22.8% vs. 6.3%). White respondents were\nmore likely (9.4% vs. 1.3%) to have an adult member\nof the household in need of drug treatment than\nAfrican American respondents. In addition, Whites had\nsignificantly higher rates of any drug exposure than\nTable 2 presents a logistic regression model of the\nassociation among demographic variables, life stressors,\nexposure to illegal drugs, and remaining abstinent from\nillegal drug use in the last month for methadone clients\nover the age of 50. A dichotomous variable was created\nfor exposure to illegal drug use that included respond-\nents who had a significant other who was abusing illegal\nsubstances or in need of drug treatment, an adult mem-\nber of their household in need of drug treatment, or\nliving in a neighborhood with drug sales. In this model,\nCharacteristic\nOverall\nSample\nMen\nWomen\nAfrican\nAmerican\nWhite\nLife stressors\nDrug exposure\nNote: Values are percentages.\naProbabilities for Fischer exact test are reported owing to expected cell frequencies of ,5.\nbPositive screen for any use of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, or other illegal substance.\nSignificant difference\nexposure to illegal drugs was significantly associated\nwith having used illegal drugs in the last month. Finan-\ncial life stressors and living in an unstable environment\nwere not significantly associated with illegal drug use in\nthe last month; nor was race or gender. Specific items in\nthe dichotomous variable for exposure to illegal drugs\nwere also tested individually, and none was found to be\nsignificant (analysis not reported).\nDiscussion\nThe findings in this article illuminate the challenges\nthat older methadone clients face as they age. These\nresults indicate that exposure to illegal drugs in\na respondent's social network and neighborhood is\nsignificantly related to older methadone clients using\nillegal drugs in the previous month. They also suggest\nthat for this older cohort of methadone clients, there\nare important racial and gender differences. For\ninstance, future research will need to fully explore the\nimpact that intimates (significant others and adult\nmembers of the household) play in a methadone client's\nability to remain abstinent.\nThese findings have important implications for\npolicy initiatives and funding of opiate addiction\nprograms at both the federal and the state levels. The\ndata indicate that as this population ages, there is still\na relatively high rate of drug usage, with nearly one-\nthird of older clients using illegal drugs in the last\nmonth. The increased service needs of an aging opiate-\naddicted population will place a financial strain on\nexisting resources. Funding programs that are directed\nto this aging population may help to decrease overall\nexpenditures in the health and mental health field for\nseniors addicted to opiates by allowing them to receive\ncare in appropriate settings.\nThere is also the potential that future research about\nthe lives of older methadone clients will help in the in-\ntervention and treatment strategies of younger opiate-\naddicted individuals. Heroin addiction and its effect on\none's lifestyle can have a devastating impact on an\nindividual's health and, in many cases, can be fatal.\nUnderstanding the pathways that allow opiate-addicted\nindividuals to enter old age may provide insight into\nstrategies for intervening with younger addicts.\nHistorically, the lives of older methadone clients\nhave remained relatively hidden. Yet, older methadone\nclients may also provide useful insight into other\nvulnerable aging populations (i.e., individuals with\nHIV or mental health problems) who will face\nadditional challenges as they age. Findings on the\nrelationship between exposure to illegal drug use in\none's social network and neighborhood are similar to\ninitial observations that physical locations and social\ncircumstances within which people interact can pro-\nmote or discourage HIV risk behaviors (Schensul, Levy,\nin this article indicate that future research and\ninterventions for this population will need to consider\nthe interaction between behaviors and settings of long-\nterm opiate addiction.\nThe limits of administrative data were present in\nthis review, including the inability to generalize from\nthe data and the omission of key variables. Future\nresearch with this population will benefit from the use\nof age-appropriate measures for social support and\nevaluation of life stressors for an older population.\nMore extensive questions regarding social support and\nthe continuum of support that is available may be\nimportant factors to consider in evaluating an older\nmethadone client's ability to remain abstinent from\nillegal drug use.\nReferences\nAnderson, C.
