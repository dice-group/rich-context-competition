Establishing a position in\nthe social hierarchy of peers and forming supportive social alliances represent key\ndevelopmental tasks during this period. In meeting these challenges, children are\ncommonly confronted with conflict, competition, and expressions of anger, hostility,\nrejection, and aggression (Rubin, Bukowski, and Laursen, 2009). Exposure to interpersonal\nconflict in some form is virtually universal, but a substantial proportion of youth also\nexperience more pervasive and intense threats, including bullying, physical assault, or\nwide-spread peer rejection (Bierman, 2004; Nansel et al., 2001). These peer relationship\nproblems have been implicated in the development of a wide range of psychopathology\nsymptoms, including internalizing and externalizing problems, poor academic achievement,\nSocial defense\nsubstance use, and even suicide (Parker, Rubin, Erath, Wojslawowicz, and Buskirk, 2006).\nPublic recognition of the mental health risk posed by peer relationship problems is evident\nin the ubiquity of programs aimed at reducing bullying, victimization, and violence in\ntoday's schools (Ttofi and Farrington, 2011).\nHowever, a disproportionate amount of theoretical and empirical effort has been\ndirected towards identifying characteristics of the broader social context (e.g., rejection,\nvictimization) as precursors to adjustment problems, resulting in a significant gap in our\nunderstanding of the ways in which children contend with these challenges. The strategies\nchildren use to protect themselves when faced with peer threat may elucidate why and how\nthese agonic peer climates contribute to psychopathology, helping to increase the\nspecificity with which we can identify the children at greatest risk and develop more\nefficient and effective intervention strategies.\nIn the following paper, we attempt to address this gap by outlining our working\ntranslation of the evolutionary developmental reformulation of emotional security theory\n(EST-R; Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007) to the study of peer relationships. Our model is\ndesigned to build on the tremendous progress made in studying peer relationships and\npsychopathology. Developmental researchers have made great strides in identifying the\nconstitutional and interpersonal origins of problematic social behavior (e.g., aggression,\nwithdrawal) and in advancing an understanding of the ways children contribute to their\nown social experiences (Beirman, 2004; Little, Henrich, Jones, and Hawley, 2003; Parker\net al., 2006; Rubin, Coplan, and Bowker, 2009; Rudolph, Abaied, Flynn, Sugimura, and\nAgoston, 2011). Despite these advances, conceptual and empirical progress has frequently\nbeen restricted to relatively narrow subsets of behavior or phenomena. Without a common\nlanguage and guiding framework, focusing on limited substantive areas or subsamples of\nthe population runs the risk of generating isolated, disparate findings that offer little basis\nfor comparison. Accordingly, a significant gap in the literature is the paucity of mid-level\ntheories that serve as potentially useful frameworks for organizing research on children's\ncoping with peer threat. Although our conceptual application to peer relationships is still in\nits early stages, our goal is to use EST-R as a base for developing a mid-level theory in\nevolutionary developmental psychology that generates precise hypotheses and research\ndirections in the study of peer relationships and psychopathology.\nWe draw on EST-R, in part, because it offers a complementary alternative to\nprevailing methods that emphasize form (morphology) over function in determining the\ndevelopmental meaning and consequences of behavior. These approaches rely on the\nimplicit, top-down assignment of behavioral forms as either \"healthy\" or \"pathological\"\nbased on intuitive experience and common wisdom (Stump, Ratliff, Wu, and Hawley,\n2009). Efforts to delineate the origins and correlates of these \"healthy\" and \"pathological\"\nforms of behavior then become myopically focused on pre-existing lexicons of inherently\npositive and negative contributing factors. Within the peer literature, this is exemplified by\nearly designations of aggressive behavior as \"socially incompetent,\" followed by a history\nof searching for its \"adverse\" precursors and \"pathological\" sequelae.\nIn contrast, a theoretical approach balancing both form and function accepts that the\nsame behavior may serve different functions within different contexts (Stump et al., 2009).\nFor example, contemporary developmental conceptualizations now distinguish between\naggressive behavior that serves to increase access to and control over resources in the peer\ngroup (i.e., proactive) (Little et al., 2003). Integrating function stimulated new questions\nSocial defense\nand resulted in the identification of a significant subgroup of children and teens who are\nboth highly aggressive and evidencing above-average social and psychological adjustment\n(Hawley, 2011; Hawley, Little, and Rodkin, 2007). By drawing on the principles of\nevolutionary developmental psychology (EDP; Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2002), EST-R\nprovides a unique opportunity to move beyond standard models linking \"incompetent\"\ninterpersonal experiences and \"pathological\" behavior towards a broader understanding of\nthe processes that serve to sustain these associations within the population despite the\nsubstantial consequences for the mental health of children.\nThe evolutionary-developmental foundations of EST-R\nConsistent with the principles of evolutionary developmental psychology, EST-R is\npredicated on the assumption that the brains and bodies of contemporary humans were\nshaped by natural selection. Accordingly, accurately predicting the developmental\nprecursors and sequelae associated with a particular pattern of behavior requires taking into\naccount its phylogenetic origin and adaptive function, as well as its proximate cause and\nontogenetic history (Hawley, 2011). Elucidating developmental processes is also prioritized\nin evolutionary developmental psychology based on the assumption that stage-specific\nadaptations are commonly designed to provide a fitness advantage within the unique social\necology of a particular development period (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2011).\nIn advancing the objectives of this overarching perspective, our model relies heavily\non the conceptualization of behavioral systems for achieving an understanding of the\nevolved psychobiological structures and implicit algorithms that direct the behavioral\nstrategies humans use in meeting developmental challenges (e.g., Mikulincer and Shaver,\n2006). In accordance with this approach, much of human behavior is posited to be\norganized by a limited set of primitive, species-typical, and goal-directed behavioral\nsystems (Bowlby, 1969; Novak and Pel\u00e1ez, 2004). Each system consists of an integrated\nset of affective, psychological, and physiological processes. Together, these form unique\npsychobiological modules, each with a distinct ultimate function, proximate organizing\ngoal, and repertoire of behavioral strategies (see Table 1; Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007).\nUltimate function refers to the broad adaptive advantage the system conferred in promoting\nsurvival and reproduction throughout our history as a species. The proximate function (or\nproximate organizing goal) describes the objective of the module in regulating the\norganism-environment relationship to support the ultimate function. Behavioral strategies\nrefer to the systems' response set, or specific action tendencies that can be flexibly used to\nachieve the proximate function.\nAccording to behavioral systems conceptualizations, the relative influence of these\nsystems as organizers of organismic functioning varies over time based on the salience of\nspecific, proximate functions. Thus, organisms are constantly managing the allocation of\nlimited time, energy, and biological resources towards various fitness goals (Del Giudice\nand Belsky, 2011). Decisions to allocate resources towards a particular behavioral system\nand its proximate goal are driven by automatic, evolved algorithms for calculating the net\nfitness gain of prioritizing the function of one system relative to the others. Consistent with\nevolutionary emotion theories, emotions are proposed to play a central, adaptive role in this\nprocess by highlighting fitness-relevant stimuli in the environment and motivating\npsychological and behavioral responses (Nesse, 1990; Panskepp, 1998). Current ecological\nconditions, ontogenetic history, developmental stage, and inherited dispositions may all\nSocial defense\ninfluence the cost/benefit ratio of adopting a particular strategy.\nIn examining the behavioral systems in Table 1, a primary premise of our\nconceptualization is that children's coping with agonic peer relationships is largely\norganized around the social defense system (SDS). Thus, in the next section, we describe\nthe basic operation of the SDS within EST-R before proceeding into the novel implications\nof the theory for understanding individual differences in how children cope with peer\nthreat.\nTable 1.

In emotion-laden and stressful interpersonal contexts, preserving a sense of\nsafety and security is posited to be a primary psychological goal for all children (Davies\nand Sturge-Apple, 2007). The central tenet of EST-R is that this goal is served, in large\npart, by the social defense system (SDS). Consistent with early ethological descriptions of\nthe \"fear/wariness system\" (e.g., Bowlby, 1969; Harlow and Harlow, 1965), the SDS is\nposited to have evolved due to the high cost of intragroup conflict and competition.\nPhenotypic responses to interpersonal hostility were adaptive if they served to reduce the\nlikelihood of both physical harm and damage to one's social status. Over time, natural\nselection sculpted the SDS into a system capable of organizing complex, integrated patterns\nof emotion, information processing, and behavior to efficiently defuse and avoid\nUpon interpreting environmental cues as signaling the likelihood of impending\ninterpersonal threat, the SDS elicits fear, vigilance, and arousal. Fearful emotion serves to\nmotivate and manage the selection of a relevant behavioral response from among a large\nrepertoire of defense tactics designed to defuse interpersonal threat. These include\nfight/flight, social de-escalation, appeasing, camouflaging, and defeat (Davies, Cicchetti,\nthe functioning of the SDS is proposed to be reflected in the propensity of individuals to:\n(a) develop increasingly efficient and elaborated psychological and behavioral strategies for\ncoping with threat based on their experiential history, and (b) draw on existing strategies as\nguides for interpreting and responding to subsequent interpersonal events (Davies and\nSturge-Apple, 2007). Thus, EST-R predicts that the SDS will evidence modest to moderate\nfunctional stability over time.\nWhat constitutes threat?\nDirect physical or psychological attacks, loss of social standing, defection of allies,\nand group exclusion represent particularly potent threats to individual fitness (Sloman and\nGilbert, 2000). According to EST-R, the SDS is exclusively attuned to environmental\nstimuli signaling the potential for physical or psychological harm, restrictions on the\nindividual's access to resources (i.e., toys, materials, food, privileged play space; affiliative\ninteractions), or attempts to undermine their social standing (Davies, Martin, and Cicchetti,\n2012). These include expressions of anger and hostility (e.g., facial expressions, loud angry\nnoises/yelling, fast approach or quick movements, looming, dominant posturing, verbal\naggression) and social exclusion (e.g., turning away, ignoring, supplanting, relational\naggression) (Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007; \u00d6hman and Mineka, 2001). In applying EST-\nR to the peer group, we expect the SDS to be salient in contexts of (a) overt expressions of\npeer hostility, physical, verbal, or relational aggression, anger, and frustration, (b) non-\nverbal supplanting (i.e., taking over a privileged play space, blocking access to privileged\nspace or toy), and (c) rejection (i.e., ignoring a play bid, refusing to allow the target child to\njoin the group). Hostility and rejection may be expressed through facial expressions,\ndominant posture or gestures, acts (e.g., hitting, pushing, forcefully taking object), facial\nexpressions of disgust or disdain (e.g., eye rolling; exasperated sighs), or physically turning\nSocial defense\naway.\nThe importance of threat and its psychological meaning for the child will vary as a\nfunction of the threat signal's proximity, valence, intensity, and whether cues signal direct\nor peripheral threat (Nesse, 2005). Therefore, the SDS should, on average, have the greatest\ninfluence on a child's behavior when the potential for threat is imminent and unambiguous,\nsuch as when an angry peer is standing over the child with an arm raised as if to hit\nhim/her. In contrast, witnessing a heated exchange between two peers on the other side of\nthe room may result in a modest social defense response (perhaps momentary arousal or\nunease), but is unlikely to outweigh the strength of the affiliative system to the point of\ndistracting the child from the pleasure and communion of an ongoing game with friends.\nThe degree of reactivity a child expresses relative to the intensity of threat cues in the\nenvironment represents an important clue as to the salience and sensitivity of the SDS in\norganizing their behavior.\nIndividual differences in social defense\nEST-R asserts that preserving a sense of safety and security is a fundamental human\nmotivation across contexts (Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007). Throughout our history as a\nspecies, a substantial proportion of the human population has and continues to develop\nwithin dangerous, hostile, and unpredictable social environments (Crittenden, 1999). When\nfaced with frequent interpersonal hostility and failure in intra-group competition for\nresources, the long-term adaptive benefits of retaining privileged status and alliances within\nthe social group may be regularly outweighed by concerns for immediate physical or\npsychological danger. In these contexts, adaptive advantage is gained by individuals who\nare able to minimize the costs of conflict and defeat by adopting a \"better-safe-than-sorry\"\nstrategy of investing substantial psychobiological resources in recognizing, monitoring, and\nmanaging potential threats (Davies, Sturge-Apple, and Martin, 2013; Woody and\nSzechtman, 2011). These hypersensitive, or \"insecure,\" forms of social defense functioning\nare proposed to share in common several core features, including heightened vigilance and\narousal in response to perceptions of threat, a tendency to attribute hostile intent, and biased\nexpectations of danger from the social world (Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007).\nConsistent with evolutionary developmental models (e.g., Bjorklund and Pelligrini,\n2011), we propose that recurring ecological niches characterized by specific profiles of\nsocial threat and opportunity put selective pressure on the evolution of a limited number of\nprototypical social defense strategies, or specialized social defense phenotypes, that could\nbe flexibly adopted depending on salient characteristics of the social environment during\nontogenetic development. Drawing on EST-R, we specifically propose that these patterns\ncan be parsimoniously captured by four prototypic strategies: Secure, Mobilizing-insecure,\nDominant-insecure, and Demobilizing-insecure. Each strategy is distinguished by its\nunique proximate function in defusing and avoiding conspecific threat within a particular\nsocial ecological niche. In the following section, we apply this model to children's\nresponses to threat in the peer group, outlining, in detail, each strategy's (a) distinct\naffective and behavioral profile, (b) the social-ecological niche to which it is adaptive, (c)\ntemperamental precursors that serve as dispositional biases towards its particular niche, and\n(d) its long-term developmental costs and advantages (see Table 2) (Davies and Sturge-\nApple, 2007; Davies and Martin, in press).\nSocial defense\nTable 2.

Although\nmanaging interpersonal threat remains an important goal throughout the life span, juvenility\nis regarded as a sensitive period due to its significance in establishing harmonious peer\nrelationships and social standing in extrafamilial hierarchies (Del Giudice, Angeleri, and\nThe Structure and Functional Utility of the Social Defense Profiles\nSecure\nIn accordance with EST-R, the external goal of the SDS in defusing threat is\nadaptive for all individuals faced with conflict and hostility. Thus, rather than reflecting the\nabsence of SDS responding altogether, a secure profile is characterized by a fully\noperational SDS that, on average, assumes low saliency relative to other behavioral\nsystems. This is manifested in well-regulated and fluid defensive responses to direct social\nthreats. Fluidity is reflected in a balanced appraisal of the social environment and the\nflexible use of defense strategies to match proximate contextual cues (Davies and Sturge-\nApple, 2007). Security has been described as an overarching \"safety\" orientation, reflecting\na relative balance between security (inhibitory) and other (approach) goals in the\nexpectation that social threats are limited and manageable (Gilbert, 1993). The secure\nstrategy functions to maintain an open orientation towards opportunities in the environment\nby restricting social defense saliency to instances of clear and direct threat. When threats do\ninevitably arise, secure children are still expected to experience mild-to-moderate negative\naffect and arousal.\nThe identification of a secure profile does not rely on or preclude the use of any\nspecific SDS behavior. Accordingly, secure children may exhibit some aggression,\nwithdrawal, immaturity, or other behaviors traditionally considered \"socially incompetent.\"\nHowever, these should be integrated within a broader profile characterized by (a) a\nrelatively high threshold for threat detection, (b) circumscribed operation of the SDS as an\norganizer of behavior in contexts of imminent and unambiguous threats, (c) a relatively\nquick return to normal activities following resolution of the threat, and (d) an over-arching\nprioritization of behavioral systems organizing approach and resource-control (e.g.,\nexploratory, affiliation, dominance) (see Table 1).\nThe secure profile represents an optimally adaptive social defense strategy within\nresource-rich, predictable, and benign ecological niches (Davies and Martin, 2013). Thus,\nsecurity is proposed to emerge within contexts that provide consistent psychological and\nemotional support, predictable rules for accessing resources, and relatively harmonious\nrelationships. Translated to peer relationships, security should co-occur with general\nacceptance by the larger peer network and opportunities to access resources within peer\ninteractions (e.g., friendships, preferred play partners). Any experiences as targets or\nvictims of hostility are further postulated to be limited in frequency and restricted to\nspecific contexts or individuals (e.g., a bully or \"enemy\"). Likewise, high effortful control,\nlow impulsivity, and a high threshold of sensitivity to discomfort are temperamental\ncharacteristics that may bias the individual towards adopting a secure strategy. For\nexample, effortful control and low impulsivity reflect the early-emerging ability to regulate\nbehaviors in an organized, planful way, limiting the primacy of reflexive, automatic\nSocial defense\nresponses. This temperamental profile helps to guide the expression of SDS responses\ntowards forms that generally stay within the guidelines of social norms for \"appropriate\nbehavior.\" In addition, temperamental tendencies to withstand and weather discomfort may\ntranslate into a higher tolerance for uncomfortable peer situations.\nThe behavioral manifestations of SDS security (e.g., well-regulated affect, open\nattention to social cues, low expectancies of future threat) tend to be attractive to peers\n(Bierman, 2004). Thus, we predict that security will be associated with more prosocial\nbehavior and play bids from peers relative to children adopting insecure SDS strategies.\nMoreover, under expectations that immediate survival and access to resources are\npredictably ensured, adopting a secure profile frees up limited psychobiological resources\nto be allocated towards other adaptive goals. In this way, security influences children's\nbroader psychological adjustment indirectly, by allowing for the elaboration of the\nbehavioral systems that organize problem-solving (e.g., exploration), social skills,\ncooperation (e.g., affiliation), empathy, and prosocial orientations towards others in need\n(e.g., caregiving) (Davies et al., 2013; Davies and Martin, in press). These skills, then, are\nproposed to mediate associations between SDS security and individuals' adjustment (e.g.,\nsocial status, popularity, acceptance) (Bierman, 2004; Rubin et al., 2009). Over time, these\nfactors are likely to support relatively low levels of psychopathology and adjustment\ndifficulties. However, because any selective allocation of resources towards a particular\ngoal produces a fitness trade-off (Bjorklund and Pelligrini, 2011; Hawley, 2011), greater\nsecurity is proposed to confer some developmental costs. By minimizing distribution of\nresources towards elaborating the SDS, secure children are proposed to be relatively poor at\ndetecting emerging threats and malevolent intent in others. The rosy view of interpersonal\nrelationships developed within benign, harmonious environments may manifest in naivety\nand gullibility when secure children are faced with more stressful contexts.\nMoreover, adopting a secure SDS strategy does not preclude children from adopting\nwhat would be regarded as an \"undesirable\" behavioral profile from a public health\nperspective. Each behavioral system is likely to have evolved alternative phenotypic\nvariants, all of which come with a unique balance of developmental costs and benefits. For\nexample, we propose that a significant subgroup of secure children will differentially\nallocate reserve psychobiological resources towards prioritizing dominance goals. The\ndominance system functions to increase status and access to resources by eliminating and\nintimidating adversaries (see Table 1). Therefore, individuals with highly salient and\ndeveloped dominance systems are proposed to evidence certain core characteristics to\nsupport this resource-control function (i.e., heightened sensitivity to status threats and\nreward, insensitivity to punishment, suppressed vulnerable affect, high rates of aggression,\nboldness), but lack the vigilance to threat, reactivity, and hostile attribution biases\ncharacteristic of a hypersensitive SDS (Davies and Martin, in press; Dixon, 1998). This\ndistinction between dominant-secure (i.e., high-dominance system salience, low SDS\nsalience) and dominant-insecure (i.e., high-dominance, high-SDS) is supported, in part, by\nthe distinction in the developmental literature between proactive and reactive aggressors\n(e.g., Little et al., 2003; Vitaro, Brendgen, and Tremblay, 2002). Thus, security should not\nbe misconstrued as a catch-all or blanket category for \"competence\" or \"benevolence,\" but\nrather a more precisely defined relative paucity of alarm, apprehension, and fear.\nSocial defense\nMobilizing-insecure\nIn contrast to the SDS's relatively low salience in the secure profile, a mobilizing-\ninsecure strategy is characterized by hyperactivation of the SDS, as reflected in\ncomprehensive mobilization of psychobiological resources towards monitoring and\ndefending against threat. The function of mobilization is to defuse or avoid threat in a\nmanner that sustains heightened arousal and attention to both threat and opportunity within\nthe environment. This serves to maximize the individual's access to resources (e.g.,\ncooperative interaction opportunities, play materials) in the social network over time\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, the mobilizing pattern utilizes a strategy of\n\"dutiful subordination\" that permits avoidance of direct harm and social exclusion while\nalso maintaining proximity to dominant group members (Trower, Gilbert, and Sherling,\n1990). Although mobilizing patterns may be manifested in a variety of tactics, including\nflight (e.g., running away), avoidance (e.g., warily watching dominant group members,\nhovering around play groups), and aggressive-fight behaviors, common trademark signs of\nmobilization consist of exaggerated displays of vulnerability, blatant and unvarnished\nforms of distress and fear, and immaturity. Thus, their active fight/flight behaviors may be\nfrequently interspersed with affected expressions (e.g., loud sighs, dramatic whining,\nemphasizing their plight) and exaggerated coy or ingratiating behaviors (e.g., reassurance-\nseeking; overly bright smiles) (Davies et al., 2013; Gilbert, 2001). Together, this pattern\nserves to de-escalate heightened interpersonal tensions by calming or appeasing dominant-\nstatus individuals while also fostering continued attention and focus from social group\nmembers (Davies and Martin, in press).\nThe prolonged, widespread pattern of heightened arousal and reactivity reflected in\na mobilizing-insecure profile is proposed to emerge from a history of contending with\nrecurrent hostile threats interspersed with experiences that serve to maintain children's\nemotional and psychological involvement in the group (Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007).\nTranslated to the peer setting, interpersonal threat is likely to be evidenced by repeated\nrejection, exclusion, hostility, and/or victimization from a number of peers. Although these\nagonic peer experiences may naturally engender withdrawal from the social network,\nspecific interpersonal and intrapersonal conditions counteract this tendency and serve to\ncollectively immerse children in threatening social networks.\nAt the interpersonal level, mobilizers' persistent investment in the social group and\nattraction to dominant-status individuals are posited to develop when children (a) are able\nto garner some degree of support and resources within limited subsystems of the peer social\nhierarchy (e.g., a friend) or (b) experience blurred relationship boundaries characterized by\nvolatile bouts of hostility (e.g., relational aggression, psychological control) that are\nirregularly or conditionally punctuated with some peer support (e.g., maintaining a \"toady\"\nrelationship with a higher-status peer). At the intrapersonal level, mobilizing is supported\nby a mix of dispositional characteristics. On the one hand, high perceptual sensitivity, low\ntolerance for discomfort, and poor effortful control are likely to increase aversive\nresponding to conflict with peers. On the other hand, traditionally \"positive\" characteristics,\nsuch as a high sensitivity to rewards and pleasure, serve to incentivize mobilizers'\nimmersion in the social group despite the hostile climate (Davies and Martin, 2013).\nIn contrast to a secure profile, the hypersensitivity and prolonged activation of the\nSDS system characterizing the mobilizing-insecure strategy reflects a substantial\nSocial defense\ninvestment in defense that is likely to deplete resources that could potentially be devoted to\nother behavioral systems. Consequently, mobilizers are predicted to exhibit some degree of\nimpairment in social skills, problem-solving, and prosocial orientations relative to the\nsecure profile. Furthermore, although acute awareness of signs of threat, preoccupation\nwith the analysis of one's own behavior in social contexts, and the reflexive adoption of\nvulnerable, submissive, and appeasing behaviors are adaptive in reducing harm within\ncontexts of interpersonal threat, they also increase the risk for long-term difficulties\ncharacterized by anxiety problems, attention difficulties, and borderline personality\nsymptoms (e.g., unstable sense of self, interpersonal dependency, emotional lability)\n(Gilbert, 2001; Jensen et al., 1997). However, in spite of its developmental disadvantages, a\nmobilizing-insecure profile is also proposed to confer a unique portfolio of relative\nstrengths. We specifically hypothesize that their relatively strong motivation to participate\nin interpersonal relationships will engender a broader personality profile characterized by\nmoderate levels of communion, social interest, proclivity towards empathic responding,\nand openness to intimacy.\nDominant-insecure\nDominant-insecure tendencies consist of efforts to directly defeat threat through\naggressive and intimidating \"fight\" patterns (Dixon, 1998; Hilburn-Cobb, 2004). Although\nthe dominant profile of social defense utilizes psychobiological pathways shared with the\ndominance system (see Table 1), dominant-insecure behaviors are still primarily organized\nby the SDS, and thus characterized by heightened distress, wariness, and arousal in\nresponse to perceived threats. Nevertheless, these are substantially outweighed by displays\nof overt, dysregulated anger and aggression, hostility, and loss of control as the child\nattempts to minimize the appearance of vulnerability and susceptibility to defeat through\nreactively attacking and intimidating peers. Evolutionary models of defensive aggression\nsuggest that this insecure fight pattern is supported by an underlying affective and cognitive\nstrategy characterized by downplaying the meaning of interpersonal relationships (e.g.,\nhostile representations, high self-regard) and minimizing the subjective experience of\n\"vulnerable\" emotions (e.g., fear, sadness, empathy) to allow the individual to overcome\nfear-based flight instincts and to focus anger and arousal towards enacting aggression (e.g.,\nThe dominant-insecure profile is posited to develop within social niches\ncharacterized by experiences with interpersonal antagonism, high social detachment, and\ninconsistent or indistinct power hierarchies. Histories of exposure to interpersonal threat are\nlikely to breed vigilance and anxiety in subsequent social contexts, whereas disengagement\nand an ill-defined social structure serve to limit internal and external guidelines for\naccessing group resources and reduce the deleterious consequences for violating rules of\nconduct (Hawley et al., 2007). These ecological features are proposed to engender\ntrademark features of dominance, including (a) \"analgesic\" responses to stress\ncharacterized by attempts to reduce the experience and appearance of anxiety in response to\nthreat, (b) efforts to downplay the significance of social relationships, and (c) direct,\naggressive behavior. Therefore, chaotic environments exhibiting a pattern of blurred social\nstructures and roles in the peer group, peer hostility and aggression, unclear rules for\naccessing resources, interpersonal indifference, and inconsistent discipline for behavioral\ninfractions are proposed to be particularly potent precursors to dominant profiles.\nSocial defense\nFurthermore, a temperamental configuration of high sensitivity to pleasure, low\nsensitivity to punishment, and impulsivity may increase the likelihood of success in\nblunting vulnerable affect (i.e., fear, sadness, empathy) and enacting bold, domineering\nstrategies (Korte, Koolhaas, Wingfield, and McEwen, 2005). Indirect evidence from the\nprimate literature lends some support for these associations. For example, instability in the\nsocial hierarchy of non-human primates predicts increased levels of intra-group aggressive\nbehavior, with subordinate individuals more likely to aggress against dominant-status\nThe tendency of dominant-insecure children to blunt the experience of vulnerable\nemotions and devalue close relationships is particularly likely to take a toll on the operation\nof the affiliative and caregiving systems. Phenotypical products of disruption in these two\nbehavioral systems are likely to include hostile views of the social world, interpersonal\ndisenfranchisement, lack of sympathy, and rigid, reflexive use of aggressive behaviors. As\nthe dominant-insecure strategy coalesces into a hallmark personality profile of hostility and\ncallousness, we hypothesize that these children will be at greatest risk for developing\nconduct problems, delinquency, and antisocial symptomatology (Davies and Martin, 2013;\nFailure to elaborate and master affiliative and caregiving strategies may also reduce\ndominant-insecure children's opportunities to affiliate with peers. Thus, over longer\nperiods, dominant-insecure children may also evidence a high risk for atypical depression\ncharacterized by high levels of fatigue, sleepiness, and lethargy (Korte et al., 2005). This\nhypothesis is supported, in part, by evidence that reactive forms of aggression often\nprecede both peer rejection and depression (Bierman, 2004; Vitaro et al., 2002).\nNevertheless, the developmental landscape is not uniformly bleak for children with\ndominant-insecure profiles. Dominant strategies can also serve to foster self-regard,\nconfidence, agency, and a bold readiness to experience novelty and challenge (Korte et al.,\nDemobilizing-insecure\nThe final SDS pattern is conceptualized as a \"last resort\" or \"involuntary defeat\"\nstrategy that emerges from the chronic hyperactivation of the SDS when alternative\nstrategies to reduce the experience of interpersonal threat have repeatedly failed (Sloman\nand Gilbert, 2000). This demobilizing-insecure profile is characterized by patterns of\nsubmissive (e.g., downward gaze, postural slumping, lethargy, anhedonia), appeasing (e.g.,\ncoy, ingratiating behavior), and camouflaging (e.g., freezing, subtle withdrawal, silence)\nAlthough conventional mental health models commonly view the distress,\nimpairment, and dampened motivation accompanying demobilization as broadly\nmaladaptive, this \"lay-low' strategy is functional within highly oppressive social networks\nby reducing the child's salience as a target of interpersonal aggression and signaling to\nhostile conspecifics that they pose no threat to the existing hierarchy and distribution of\nresources (Gilbert, 2001). Particularly when conditions signal a scarcity of resources and no\nopportunities to escape, the benefits of gaining resources, forming alliances, or achieving\ngreater standing are far outweighed by the immediate risk of evoking the ire and hostility of\naggressive dominants (Bracha, 2004). In support of its functional utility, research has\nobserved a similar pattern of demobilization exhibited by nonhuman primates who faced\nSocial defense\nintense conspecific hostility and subordinate status (Honess and Marin, 2006).\nThe lay-low function of demobilization is proposed to be commonly expressed in\none of two primary forms: one characterized primarily by camouflaging behaviors and the\nother by dysphoria and defeat (Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007). Both forms share an\nunderlying vigilance and sensitivity to threat, heightened anxiety and arousal, and\ninhibition of fight and flight inclinations (Davies and Martin, in press). In its camouflaging\nform, the proximate function of concealment from hostile or high-status peers is achieved\nthrough behaviors that inhibit external expressions of distress. Although this strategy tends\nto be successful in hiding distress from adults and peers in natural settings, trained\nobservers recognize camouflaging by their postural tension, freezing, subtle withdrawal\n(e.g., getting quiet, avoiding eye contact), reflexive and wooden affirmations, reduced play\nand exploration, and retreat to an internal locus of attention. The alternative form of\ndemobilization is expressed in a more widespread dampening of social and mastery\nmotivations, resulting in a behavioral pattern characterized by dysphoria, fatigue,\nanhedonia, downtrodden behaviors, sulking, and unoccupied behavior (e.g., staring\nblankly; wandering with no specific purpose) (Davies and Martin, in press; Gilbert, 1993;\nSloman and Gilbert, 2000). Following from its function in avoiding notice, children\nadopting either form of demobilization are expected to evidence high levels of social\ndisengagement, withdrawal, and submissive forms of appeasing behavior (i.e., standing\nwith head down).\nAs a last resort strategy, the demobilizing profile is proposed to emerge from a\nprotracted history of contending with recurrent hostile threats without ample opportunity to\npsychologically disengage or escape (Sloman, Price, Gilbert, and Gardner, 2004).\nTranslated to the peer group, demobilization is likely associated with widespread exclusion,\nvictimization, and rejection from peers coupled with a \"lack of opportunities for solace\"\nmanifested in extremely limited experiences with prosocial and cooperative interactions,\nlittle or no social support, and minimal friendships that are highly unstable and poor in\nquality (e.g., hostile, controlling). Moreover, a constitutional profile of high sensitivity to\npunishment, wariness of novelty, and low sensitivity to pleasure is likely to support the\ntrademark forms of demobilization, including disengagement, inhibition of exploration, and\ndysphoria. Likewise, the skillful ability to down-regulate overt expressions of distress is\nproposed to be rooted in relatively intact or even exceptional capacities for effortful control\nChildren adopting a demobilizing-insecure strategy are predicted to bear the most\nsignificant long-term mental and physical health burdens of any of SDS strategy. Given its\nstriking resemblance to diagnostic criteria for depression and anxiety disorders,\ndemobilizing is a likely risk factor for internalizing symptoms. Significant reductions in\nmotivation in conjunction with rumination, anxiety, and dysphoria are also likely to\nsubstantially tax the functioning of affiliation, exploratory, and caregiving systems. As a\nresult, we propose that demobilizing tendencies should be associated with serious\nimpairments in social skills, prosocial behavior, agency, and problem-solving abilities\n(Davies and Sturge-Apple, 2007; Sloman and Gilbert, 2000). By the same token, it is\nimportant to note that demobilizing patterns may confer some developmental advantages\nbeyond its proximate function in reducing threat. Minimizing escalation of conflict and\naggression in the peer group may serve as a protective factor for the development of\ndisruptive, risky, and oppositional behavior problems. Moreover, in its milder forms, the\nSocial defense\nunderlying dispositional components of a demobilizing profile may have persisted across\nevolution by promoting a sensitive, receptive, and reflective orientation toward the\nenvironment, greater inhibitory control, and adaptability to change (Sih et al., 2004;\ndemobilizing is proposed to be associated with a complex combination of developmental\ncosts and benefits.\nFuture Directions\nAs a first foray into translating EST-R to peer relationships, several major areas\nremain in need of further elaboration. In the next section, we highlight what we consider to\nbe critical next steps in fine-tuning a theory of social defense in contests of peer adversity.\nWe follow this with an overview of the methodological and conceptual tools required to\ntest the predictions we've outlined in this manuscript.\nSubstantive research directions\nSex differences in SDS functioning. Although sex differences in SDS functioning\nhave yet to receive systematic attention, there are strong reasons to expect sex to influence\nthe ways in which children defend against peer threat. Research has identified consistent\nsex differences in children's peer relationships and social behavior (Rose and Rudolph,\n2006), many of which appear to emerge and become stable during the juvenile period (Del\nGiudice et al., 2009). Males and females may be uniquely sensitive to particular contextual\ncues for threat. For example, male juveniles have been shown to demonstrate more concern\nfor social dominance and group-level competition, whereas females appear to be more\nsensitive to perturbations in group cohesion, stability, and the formation of reciprocal\nalliances (Tamashiro, Nguyen, and Sakai, 2005).\nSex may also influence the SDS at a neuroendocrine level, contributing to sex-typed\ndifferences in the likelihood of adopting a particular social defense strategy (Crick and\nZahn-Waxler, 2003). For example, when faced with pervasive interpersonal threat, males'\nhigher testosterone levels may support reactive, aggressive tendencies that contribute to a\ndominant-insecure strategy. Conversely, females with higher levels of the hormone\noxytocin may be more likely to develop behavioral strategies that allow them to maintain\nsocial ties in the face of threat, potentially increasing their likelihood of exhibiting a\nmobilizing-insecure profile.\nExternal social pressures may also contribute to the predicted population differences\nin the proportion of males and females adopting each SDS strategy. According to the\n\"gender intensification hypothesis,\" biologically-organized differences in the physical\nattributes of boys and girls precipitate socialization pressures to conform to traditional sex\nroles characterized by greater agentic traits for males and more communal traits by females\n(Davies and Lindsay, 2004). Thus, research on sex differences in children's social behavior\ncollectively highlights the possibility of sex serving not only as a predictor of social\ndefense functioning, but also as a moderator of both the precursors and sequelae of\nchildren's social defense patterns.\nSDS functioning in developmental context. Although we focus on the juvenile\nperiod here, understanding how maturational processes may alter the operation of the SDS\nacross development remains an important research direction. Within evolutionary\nSocial defense\ndevelopmental psychology frameworks (Bjorklund and Pellegrini, 2011; Del Giudice, Ellis,\nand Shirtcliff, 2011; West-Eberhardt, 2003), heightened neurobiological plasticity and\nchanges in cognitive and regulatory skills within specific developmental periods are posited\nto serve an adaptive function in allowing individuals to recalibrate behavioral systems\naccording to changes in local environmental cues and conditions. Consequently, we\npropose that developmental windows within early childhood and adolescence,\ncharacterized by heightened sensitivity and responsivity to configurations of interpersonal\nthreat, will evidence significant changes in the adoption of SDS strategies. For example, the\npreschool period in early childhood includes the emergence of social perspective-taking\nabilities that may support increasingly complex recognition and interpretation of social\ninteractions and motivations (Konner, 2010). As children begin to utilize these newfound\nskills in interacting with non-familial peers for the first time, discontinuity in adopting a\nparticular social defense strategy may be especially prevalent.\nCorresponding biological changes during these periods are also proposed to\ncontribute to changes in the functioning of multiple behavioral systems. For example, with\nthe onset of puberty and reproductive maturity in adolescence, increasing prominence of\nthe sexual system may magnify the sex differences in SDS functioning expected to emerge\nin juvenility (Ellis et al., 2012; Hawley, 2011). Puberty is specifically associated with\nincreases in the enactment of social dominance and physical risk-taking behaviors as ways\nof displaying competency and maturity (Ellis et al., 2012). The resulting valuation of\naccentuating bold behaviors while minimizing signs of weakness may increase the\nlikelihood of boys transitioning from the exaggerated displays of vulnerability evident in a\nmobilizing pattern of defense towards a risky dominant strategy for contending with peer\nthreat.\nSDS functioning and histories of interpersonal experience. The temporal patterning\nof children's exposure to interpersonal adversity is likely to have a significant impact on\nthe adoption of SDS profiles in peer settings. Prolonged and pervasive exposure to threat is\nproposed to increase children's tendencies to adopt a highly stable and specialized strategy\nfor defending against threat. EST-R proposes that early experiences in the family may serve\nas the first developmental crucible for catalyzing stable patterns of social defense.\nThis premise is supported, in part, by anthropological and archeological evidence\nthat early human societies consisted of small, highly interdependent clans (e.g., Davis and\nDaly, 1997). Within this tightly knit social environment, early family experiences provided\na dependable source of information about contemporaneous and future conditions, threats,\nand opportunities within the broader social group. Thus, the evolution of sensitive periods\nto early conditions in the family are likely to have served a selective advantage as a training\nground for meeting adaptive challenges within the broader clan or social network. Given\nthe resulting tendency for children to utilize sensorimotor patterns of processing and\nresponding to threat in the family as a guide to contending with subsequent challenges in\nthe peer group, modest to moderate continuity in SDS patterns across time and context is\nHowever, it is unlikely that each SDS pattern will evidence similar degrees of\ntemporal and contextual stability. For example, demobilizing strategies are proposed to\ndevelop from prolonged histories of intense interpersonal adversity and threat without\nrespite or opportunity for escape. Because the substantial resources necessary to maintain a\nhighly plastic SDS that is sensitive to both threats and rewards in the environment is\nSocial defense\nincreasingly unnecessary in highly agonic contexts, the repeated sampling of threatening\ncues in the environment is proposed to trigger a shift in resources toward a more intractable\ndefensive approach of threat avoidance. As a result, children who have committed to the\nlast resort demobilizing strategy are expected to experience particularly pronounced\ndifficulties in reclaiming any prior plasticity in their social defense strategies, even in the\ncontext of subsequent environmental changes toward more balanced exposure to rewards\nand threats.\nConversely, other SDS strategies may evidence significantly greater plasticity,\nespecially during social transitions and upheavals (Davies and Martin, 2013). For example,\nthe transition to preschool may be a particularly challenging time in early childhood, as\nchildren seek to negotiate relationships with unfamiliar peers while conforming to new\nclassroom rules and regulations. Faced with this novel environment, mobilizing-insecure\nstrategies may offer children an opportunity to adapt to subsequent changes in the balance\nof reward and risk by insuring that they remain vigilant to both social threat and\nopportunity.\nMethodological and conceptual tools for facilitating future research\nTests of our model of peer threat will require a fundamental shift away from\nprevailing approaches for conceptualizing and assessing children's coping in the context of\npeer relationships. Variable-based methods for differentiating groups of children based on\ngeneral physical or social attributes cannot capture the organization of multiple behaviors\nthat are designed to fulfill specific proximate functions. Although existing assessments of\nsocial behavior and peer status have significantly advanced the literature (Bierman, 2004;\nRubin et al., 2009), commonly used procedures that aim to capture functioning collectively\nover a wide array of situations fail to capture (a) children's nuanced profiles of behavior\nwithin the well-defined contexts of peer threat and challenge, (b) the specific functional\nutility of behavioral patterns in negotiating the organism-environment relationship resulting\nin fitness advantages (e.g., laying low to reduce salience as targets of hostility), or (c) the\nconfiguration of developmental costs and benefits of coping patterns. Therefore, as outlined\nin the remaining sections, our social defense model will require a relatively novel set of\nconceptual and methodological approaches for generating and testing research questions.\nThe context of assessment. Because the SDS is uniquely designed to process and\nrespond to threat, assessing social defense profiles will require careful, direct observation\nof children's behavior within well-defined contexts of peer threat. Based on organizational\napproaches to ethological assessment (Bowlby, 1969), deciphering a child's SDS strategy\ndepends, in part, on the form and nature of their patterns of responding relative to\nfluctuations in the strength and intensity of threats within the local environment. Whereas\nall children are expected to respond to direct, intense threats with wariness, distress, and\ndefensive behavior, children adopting one of the three insecure (i.e., hyperactivated) social\ndefense strategies are expected to respond with an incommensurate degree of reactivity\neven in the context of modest, indirect, and ambiguous threat signals. Accordingly,\nmaximizing validity of the assessment of social defense profiles will require the use of\ntrained observers who are capable of carefully evaluating children's reactions to a broad\nsampling of both direct (aimed at the target child) and indirect (not aimed at the target\nchild) experiences with interpersonal threat of varying intensity.\nWhile observing on-going fluctuations in the strength and intensity of threatening\nSocial defense\nevents, observers should execute caution in interpreting children's reactions to direct,\nintense threats (e.g., direct physical aggression), as even entrained patterns of social\ndefense may break down under conditions of severe distress. Instead, coders should more\nheavily weight children's behaviors during and directly following modest-to-moderate\nlevels of threat in the environment (e.g., two peers have a heated argument near, but not\ninvolving, the target child; a peer takes the target child's toy without asking). Moreover,\nbecause our theory is designed to examine how children defend against interpersonal threat\nand conflict, children's behavior under benign or harmonious peer conditions should be\nlargely ignored.\nA person-based approach. Existing approaches for assessing peer functioning\ncommonly rely on frequency counts or ratings of the overt form (i.e., morphology) of\nchildren's behaviors, either in isolation or as broader aggregates based on correlations\nbetween ratings in the sample as a whole. In contrast, our evolutionary approach\nspecifically proposes that each SDS profile is defined by a unique pattern of\ninterrelationships between behaviors that cannot be captured by either a myopic focus on\nsingle, discrete behaviors or by a sample-wide composite of multiple behaviors. For\nexample, whereas aggression and expressions of vulnerability are predicted to be strongly\npositively correlated for mobilizing children, dominant-insecure children are theorized to\nevidence relatively low levels of vulnerability in the context of high levels of aggression.\nConsidering the four patterns of social defense in relation to sociometric peer status\n(e.g., Bierman, 2004; Newcomb, Bukowski, and Pattee, 1993) provides another illustrative\nexample of the uniqueness of EST-R in relation to existing constructs in the peer literature.\nA cursory comparison of the approaches might raise the possibility that insecure profiles\nare simply markers for rejected status, whereas secure children will be disproportionately\noverrepresented in the \"popular\" category. Although we propose that there will be lawful\ninterrelationships between children's social defense profiles and their peer standing, a more\nsystematic analysis of the two classes of constructs demonstrates that they are distinct.\nWe maintain that many insecure children will not fall within the \"rejected\"\ncategory, and a substantial proportion of children assigned to categories of social standing\nconsidered to be \"negative\" (e.g., controversial, neglected) may be secure. For example,\nalthough mobilizers tend to exhibit qualities that might reduce their attractiveness as play\npartners (e.g., dysregulation, immaturity), they also exhibit characteristics that may garner\npositive attention from others (e.g., dutiful subordination, social interest). Therefore,\nalthough mobilizing children may be at risk for experiencing lower social standing in the\npeer group, we predict that they exhibit considerable heterogeneity in status across the\naverage, controversial, and rejected status groups.\nLikewise, secure children may be disproportionately less likely to be labeled as\nrejected, given predictions that security tends to emerge from relatively benign and\nharmonious interpersonal histories. However, the value of security in garnering peer liking\nnominations is proposed to be relatively constrained to conditions of threat. We expect\nsecure children to be just as likely to be assigned to traditionally \"positive\" (i.e., average,\npopular) and \"negative\" (i.e., controversial, neglected) status groups depending on the\nstrategies they adopt to meet non-defensive goals (e.g., resource-control). For example,\nmaintaining composure in the face of threat may allow children to enlist the dominance\nsystem and enact bold, aggressive, and competitive strategies in contexts of resource\ncontrol (see Table 1). Depending on the degree to which children are able to achieve goals\nSocial defense\nin the affiliative system, these children may fall within popular or controversial status\ncategories (Davies and Martin, in press; Hawley et al., 2007). Consequently, although the\nways children cope with peer threat may have important links with their peer standing,\nthere is not predicted to be a one-to-one correspondence between social defense profiles\nand status in the peer network.\nConsistent with a person-based approach, our evolutionary model of social defense\nrequires a switch to assessing how variables relate to one another within a person\n(Magnusson, 1998). From this perspective, individual differences are based on the degree\nto which children's profiles of behavior resemble prototypical patterns of social defense.\nExisting person-based methodological (e.g., q-sort methodologies, higher-order patterns of\ncoding) and analytic (e.g., latent class analysis) strategies will likely continue to be\nvaluable tools for capturing social defense behaviors. Likewise, we are in the early stages\nof devising and testing the viability of training observers to evaluate the degree to which\nchildren's functionally organized responses to peer threats capture each of the four SDS\nA balanced analysis of developmental costs and benefits. Consistent with the\nevolutionary-developmental perspective (Ellis and Bjorklund, 2012), our framework is\ndesigned to move beyond the traditional \"mental-health model\" for evaluating behavior\nbased on social norms for \"desirable\" and \"undesirable\" forms. Evolutionary frameworks\nspecifically eschew the approach of drawing on widely shared ideas about what is \"good\"\nor \"bad\" for development in determining whether a particular outcome reflects a \"deficit\"\nor \"impairment\" (Ellis and Bjorklund, 2012). Rather than focusing exclusively on the form\nof behavior, our model relies on both form and function to determine whether the behaviors\norganized to meet a specific proximate goal confer a fitness advantage. As a consequence,\nevolutionary frameworks offer a more balanced consideration of both the costs and benefits\nof adopting a particular SDS strategy (Hawley, 2011). Although it may be tempting, based\non psychological tradition, to predict maladaptive consequences for insecure strategies and\nbeneficial implications for security, a comparable priority should be given to identifying\nthe adaptive advantages gained by adopting specific insecure profiles and the long-term\ncosts associated with being secure.\nIn magnifying the significance of these research directions, the objective of\nidentifying distinctive portfolios of strengths and weaknesses associated with specific SDS\nprofiles may prove to be very useful in advancing clinical practice and public policy\ninitiatives. For example, children with mobilizing tendencies are proposed to exhibit a\nunique assortment of advantages and disadvantages characterized by high levels of\ncommunion and interest in social connection, but relatively poor social skills, difficulty\nregulating affect, and limited friendship networks. Therefore, they may disproportionately\nbenefit from an intervention program with a relatively heavy emphasis on social skills\nexercises, emotion regulation training, and pairing with a competent peer. Conversely,\nchildren exhibiting a dominant-insecure profile are proposed to benefit from their bold and\nagentic approach to the world, but also exhibit a tendency towards callousness,\ndownplaying interpersonal relationships, and blunting vulnerable affect. In this context,\ndominant-insecure children are unlikely to benefit from treatment programs designed to\nincrease empathy or punish antisocial behaviors. Rather, an approach providing privileges\nor physical rewards for displaying prosocial behavior may be especially useful. Although\nthe clinical and policy implications of the SDS framework are ultimately predicated on\nSocial defense\nobtaining additional empirical support for our hypotheses, the balanced analysis of\ndevelopmental capacities within the evolutionary developmental perspective has the\npotential to inform new directions for reducing mental health problems.\nConclusion\nOnly time will tell whether our predictions and interpretations of EST-R will prove\nto be an adequate representation of children's adaptations to peer threat. Nevertheless, even\nas a conceptual first step, we believe EST-R has a lot to offer in fostering novel research\ndirections and redefining how we think about children's behavior within peer contexts.\nGiven the importance of peer relationships for mental health and adjustment, we hope that\nresearchers are excited by the potential of evolutionary developmental psychology to move\nthe field forward. Understanding how natural selection has shaped human development\nbetter equips us all to manage the contexts in which we raise, teach, and socialize children\nin ways that work with, rather than against, our adaptive goals and towards developing\nmore efficient, effective, and sensitive policies to reduce the costs of child\npsychopathology.\nReferences\nBierman, K.
