These adolescents were consecutive\ncommunity-based treatment programs in the Drug Abuse\nTreatment Outcome Studies for Adolescents. Included\nmissions to 9 outpatient drug-free programs, and 457 ad-\nmissions to 6 short-term inpatient programs.\nResults: Adolescents in treatment typically had mul-\ntiple problems (eg, 58.4% of them were involved in the\nlegal system, and 63.0% met diagnostic criteria for a men-\ntal disorder). Nevertheless, less than half (43.8%) of all\npatients reported weekly marijuana use in the year fol-\nlowing treatment (dropping from 80.4% in the year be-\nfore admission). Similarly, there were decreases in heavy\nditionally, patients reported better psychological adjust-\nmentandschoolperformanceaftertreatment.Longer stays\nin treatment were positively associated with several fa-\nvorable outcomes, although length of time in treatment\nwas generally short.\nConclusions: Substance abuse treatment for adoles-\ncents is effective in achieving many important behav-\nioral and psychological improvements. Strategies spe-\ncific to adolescents to improve their treatment retention\nand completion are needed to maximize the therapeutic\nbenefits of drug treatment.\nIN RECENT YEARS, increased con-\ncern about alcohol and drug use\namong youths has resulted in an\nincrease in the number of alco-\nhol and drug treatment pro-\ngrams for adolescents.1,2 Still, relatively\nlittle research has focused on the effec-\ntiveness of treatment for adolescent alco-\nhol and drug abuse, and most literature on\ntreatment outcomehasbeenbasedonadult\npatients.2,3 Most earlier large-scale evalu-\nation studies have focused primarily on\nadults and have included only small\nsamples of adolescents. The few treat-\nment outcome studies on adolescents of-\nfer mixed results.2 The large-scale evalu-\nation studies have generally reported less\nfavorable outcomes among adolescents\nthan adult patients.4-6 For example, ado-\nlescents interviewed 1 year after treat-\nment in the Treatment Outcome Prospec-\ntive Study (TOPS) showed favorable\nreductions in drug use and criminal ac-\nyouths still reported daily use of mari-\njuana and heavy use of alcohol following\nTOPS treatment.5 The Services Research\nOutcomes Study7 compared adolescents'\nbehaviors during the 5-year period be-\nfore treatment and the 5 years after treat-\nment, and found that alcohol use in-\ncreased by 13%, and rates of crack use were\napproximately doubled. Results from other\nsmall-scale evaluation studies8-10 of ado-\nlescent treatment have similarly sug-\ngested that although there is a reduction\nof use after treatment, a large proportion\nof adolescents return to drug and alcohol\nAdolescents go through distinctive\ndevelopmental stages; therefore, their sub-\nstance abuse patterns12-14 and the factors\ninfluencing their use may differ from those\nof adults. Thus, they may require differ-\nent types of treatment strategies.

Although the study originally included patients\nand programs in Miami, Fla, and New York, NY, they were\nexcluded from the present study because of the adminis-\ntrative and logistical problem of implementing follow-up\ninterviews. The cities selected for participation in DATOS-A\nwere limited to those in which DATOS adult data collec-\ntion was being conducted. In these locations, programs re-\ncruited for DATOS-A were providers specializing in ado-\nlescent treatment that were judged to be stable community-\nbased organizations. No programs selected to participate\nrefused. Treatment modalities included residential (RES)\nprograms, outpatient drug-free (ODF) programs, and short-\nterm inpatient (STI) programs. These adolescents were as-\nsessed at intake and targeted for 1-year posttreatment in-\nterviews. The present analysis included 1167 adolescents\nwho completed the follow-up interviews (ie, a 67.3% in-\nterview completion rate).\nPARTICIPANTS\nThe focus of the present study was on 1167 adolescent pa-\ntients (from 23 programs) who completed both the intake\nassessment and the 1-year follow-up interviews.

Al-\nthough the field research team attributed the attrition mainly\nto logistical and resource constraints, careful examination\nof its effect was deemed necessary to rule out any system-\natic bias. We compared the subjects without follow-up in-\nterviews with those who completed follow-up interviews\nand did not find any differences in age, use of drugs (eg,\nmarijuana, alcohol, cocaine, or other illicit drugs), or en-\nrollment in school. The 2 samples also did not differ in treat-\nment retention in STI or ODF programs, but patients in\nRES programs who completed follow-up stayed in treat-\nment significantly longer than those without follow-up\nfollow-up sample had a higher proportion of female (31.5%)\nandwhite(66.2%)participantsandlowerproportionsofblack\n(18.3%) and Hispanic (9.3%) participants compared with\nQuestionnaires completed by the program directors and\ncounseling supervisors provided the description of treat-\nment protocols, policies, and staff at participating DATOS-A\nfacilities.\nResidential treatment programs included traditional,\nmodified, and short-term therapeutic community pro-\ngrams, as well as other types of RES programs. The pro-\ngrams provided residential living, education and coun-\nseling sessions, and interventions designed to resocialize\npatients. One half of the RES programs provided group\nsessions almost daily, and 87.5% provided individual\ncounseling sessions at least once per week. One half of\nthe RES programs placed great emphasis on family\ntherapy. Planned or recommended duration of stay\nranged from 3 to 12 months (median, 5 months).\nOutpatient drug-free programs included regular and in-\ntensive day treatment. Services included counseling ses-\nsions, education, and skills training. About 78% of the pro-\ngrams provided group sessions 3 or more times per week,\n55.6% of the programs had individual sessions once per\nweek, and an additional 22.2% of programs had indi-\nvidual sessions 2 to 3 times per week.

Planned\nduration of stay ranged from 5 to 35 days (median, 18 days).\nPatients were typically referred for continued outpatient\ntreatment at discharge.\nAll programs were primarily drug treatment pro-\ngrams, as opposed to alcohol-only treatment programs, and\nmost had a mixture of funding from both public and pri-\nvate sources.

Eight indicators were\nscored to reflect \"problems\" in these domains. The pa-\ntient problem severity index is the sum of the presence of\nthese 8 problems (range, 0-8); the index was further clas-\nof severity. The indicators were multiple drug use (use of\n3 drugs during the year before treatment), dependence\non alcohol or any drug (by DSM-III-R criteria16), mental dis-\norder (conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-\norder, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, or major depres-\nsive disorder, using DSM-III-R criteria), criminal\ninvolvement, unstable living arrangement, family alcohol\nand other drug (AOD) problems, deviant reference group,\nand academic failure prior to DATOS-A treatment. Pa-\ntients were considered criminally active if they were on pro-\nbation or parole, awaiting trial or had a case pending at in-\ntake, or reported a period of weekly involvement in illegal\nactivities during the past year. The unstable living arrange-\nment scale ranged from 0 to 9 (with a greater value indi-\ncating greater instability) and was the summed presence\nof the following conditions: receiving supplemental secu-\nrity income (0=no; 1=yes), not having adequate food or\nshelter(0=no;1=yes),livinginanunstableresidence(range,\n1-3; 1=house or condominium; 2=mobile home, apart-\nment, or other multiple family building; 3=hotel, board-\ning house, homeless shelter), number of places lived (range,\n1-3), and not living with parents (0=no, 1=yes). The scale\nfor family AOD problems had a range of 0 to 5, with 5 be-\ning the most problematic, and is the summed presence of\nAOD problems among the adolescent's mother, father, moth-\ner's relatives, father's relatives, and sisters or brothers. Scores\non the deviant reference group ranged between 0 and 12\n(with a greater value indicating greater severity) by count-\ning the number of family members and friends who used\ndrugs, drank alcohol heavily, had been arrested, or were\njailed. An academic failure scale (range, 0-9, with a greater\nvalue indicating greater failure) considered repeating grades\n(range, 0-2; 0=no, 1=once, 2=more than once); being sus-\npended (range 0-2; 0=no, 1=once, 2=more than once) or\nexpelled (range, 0-2; 0=no, 1=once, 2=more than once);\nskipping school (0=no, 1=yes); and whether first expul-\nolder), or truancy occurred prior to age 15 years (0=younger\nthan 15 years, 1=15 years or older). Most problem indi-\ncators were dichotomous variables, and a median split was\nused for those with continuous scales (ie, unstable living\narrangement, family AOD problems, deviant reference\ngroup, and academic failure).\nTreatment Retention\nTreatment retention was defined as the number of days be-\ntween DATOS-A program admission and discharge.\nPatients in each modality were classified as having short-\nterm or long-term retention. For RES and ODF programs,\nthe retention threshold for the long-term groups was set\nat 90 days, and for STI programs, the threshold was 21 days.\nEspecially for RES and ODF, these retention thresholds have\nbeen demonstrated to be predictive of positive outcomes\nstayed in treatment for at least 90 days as did 27.1% of the\nODF sample, and 63.7% of the patients in STI programs\nexceeded the 21-day criterion.\nOutcome Measures\nOutcome measures included drug-use patterns, psycho-\nlogical adjustment, criminal involvement, and school per-\nformance. For each type of drug, respondents were asked\nabout their average use during a specific time frame (eg,\n12 months before treatment admission or before the fol-\nlow-up interview), and there were 8 response categories\n(ranging from \"not used at all\" and \"less than once a month,\"\nto \"daily or almost every day\" and \"4 or more times a day\").\nMeasures of drug use included any use of marijuana; weekly\n(once per week or more frequently) use of marijuana; heavy\ndrinking (5 drinks in a single sitting at least once per\nweek); any use of hallucinogens, cocaine, or other stimu-\nlants; and use of any illicit drug excluding marijuana. Mea-\nsures of psychological adjustment included any suicidal\nthoughts, hostility (a subscale of a 90-item Symptoms\nChecklist; Cronbach =.88),19 and self-esteem (Cron-\nbach =.89).20 Measures of school performance included\nschool attendance (currently in school) and grades (among\nthose in school). Measures of criminal activities included\nengagement in illegal acts and arrest. All variables were re-\npeated measures for the year prior to and the year follow-\ning treatment, permitting pretreatment and posttreatment\ncomparisons.\nUrine specimens collected from the randomly se-\nlected subsample of 249 respondents during the fol-\nlow-up interviews were tested for 8 categories of drugs (am-\nphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids,\ncocaine metabolite, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine).\nPositive rates were 35.7% for marijuana, 2.8% for cocaine,\nand less than 1% for the remaining drugs. Comparing self-\nreports with urine results, underreporting of marijuana use\nwas about 13% among those who denied use in the previ-\nANALYSES\nWe provided descriptive statistics to characterize patient\npretreatment characteristics. A series of statistical tests\n(analysis of variance [ANOVA] for continuous depen-\ndent variables and 2 tests for categorical variables) was\nconducted to test the effect of modality. Repeated-\nmeasures ANOVAs were conducted to examine the pre-\ntreatment and posttreatment differences in key out-\ncomes (controlling for modality). Logistic regression\nanalyses were conducted to determine the effects of\ntreatment length (short-term vs long-term) on posttreat-\nment outcomes, controlling for pretreatment severity\n(low, medium, and high) and modality (RES, ODF, and\nSTI programs).

Treat-\nment programs included in DATOS-A were community\nprograms specifically intended to treat adolescents with\ndrug problems. This article reports results of an assess-\nment of treatment outcomes among adolescent patients\nparticipating in DATOS-A. The study addressed 3 key\nresearch questions: (1) What were the patterns of drug\nuse and other problem behaviors of these adolescents\nbefore they entered the DATOS-A treatment programs?\n(2) Were there changes in their drug use and other\nproblem behaviors after treatment? (3) Was the length\nof stay in treatment related to their posttreatment out-\ncomes?\nRESULTS\nThe average patient in DATOS-A was aged 15 to 16 years,\nand was in trouble with the law (ie, 58.4% were on pa-\nrole, probation, or awaiting trial) (Table 1).

Sources of referral also reflected significant dif-\nferences by modality, with referral by family or friends\nto ODF programs being the highest (54.8%), compared\ngrams. Referral by the legal system to RES programs was\nto ODF programs.\nMany of the patients were polydrug users (25.4%\nused 3 drugs), dependent on alcohol or other drugs ac-\ncording to DSM-III-R criteria (73.0% of participants; with\ncohol, and cocaine, respectively), diagnosed as having a\nduct disorder, 12.3% had attention-deficit/hyper-\nactivity disorder, 15.0% had a depressive disorder, 1.9%\nhad overanxious disorder, and 1.9% had panic disor-\nder), and most patients were criminally active (67.2%).\nMore than one quarter (27.9%) of participants had a his-\ntory of prior drug treatment, with the highest rates be-\ngrams, and the lowest among patients in ODF programs\nOverall, there were significant improvements in drug use,\npsychological adjustment, school performance, and crimi-\nnal activity during the year after treatment, compared with\nthe year before treatment (Table 2).

Legal involvement referred to any involvement with the legal system (eg, in jail or detention, probation, parole, case pending). Unstable living\narrangement scale (range, 0-9, with 9 being most unstable) considered the presence of the following conditions: receiving Supplemental Security Income, without\nadequate food/shelter, in unstable residence, number of places lived, and not living with parents. Family AOD problems score (range, 0-5, with 5 being most\nproblematic) was the summed presence of AOD problems among mother, father, mother's relatives, father's relatives, and sisters or brothers. Deviant reference\ngroup score (range, 0-12, with 12 being most deviant) counted the number of family members and friends who used drugs, drank alcohol heavily, had been\narrested, or entered jail. Academic failure (range, 0-9, with 9 indicating a greater failure) considered repeating grades, being suspended or expelled, skipping\nschool, and whether first expulsion, suspension, or truancy occurred prior to age 15 years.

Less than half (43.8%) returned to regu-\nlar (at least weekly) marijuana use, and there were\nsignificant reductions in criminality, heavy drinking, and\nuse of other illicit drugs. Additionally, these adolescent\npatients showed significant improvement in psychologi-\ncal adjustment and were doing better in school after treat-\nment. These improvements were observed across the 3\nmodalities of treatment programs.\nIt should be emphasized that the improvements\nachieved following treatment are particularly impres-\nsive in light of the following considerations. First, these\nadolescents typically displayed multiple problems (eg,\npolydrug use, mental disorders, criminal involvement,\nunstable living arrangements, family drug-use prob-\nlems, deviant reference groups, and academic failure).\nTherefore, treating these adolescents represents a con-\nsiderable challenge. Second, reductions in alcohol and\ndrug use and other problem behaviors observed in the\npresent study were consistent and significant, with few\nexceptions. The marked reductions in marijuana and al-\ncohol use (the major drugs of abuse for this population)\nand illegal activities are particularly encouraging in the\ncontext of these adolescents' developmental stages. Many\nsurveys of the general population21,22 have reported that\nthere is an acceleration in alcohol and drug use during\nadolescence. Thus, the reversal of this trend among treated\nadolescents in the present study supports the effective-\nness of treatment for this group.\nThe present study also reveals several findings that are\nconsistentwiththoseintheadultliterature.Patientsinpro-\ngramsofdifferentmodalitiesseemedtoreflectdifferentlev-\nels of problem severity (eg, patients in RES programs were\nthe most troubled, with criminal justice activities and re-\nferrals, school difficulties, and peer deviance). Hence, the\nvarious modalities are differentially employed by referral\nsources and, therefore, are dealing with somewhat differ-\nent patient populations. Thus, adolescents may require dif-\nfering strategies to achieve resolution of those problems.\nThepresentstudyalsoconfirmedthefindingsofpriorstud-\nies on adults,17-24 showing that patients who stayed in treat-\nment longer were more likely to have more favorable out-\ncomes, even when patient problem severity and modality\nwere statistically controlled.\nThe findings of the present study also suggest ways\nto further improve treatment outcomes among adoles-\ncents. Despite important improvements in drug use and\nother measures, many adolescents were still engaging in\ncocaine, 42.2% used illicit drugs other than marijuana, and\n52.8% committed crimes) during the year after treatment.\nTheseresultswerelargelyassociatedwiththegenerallyshort\nlengths of stay among adolescents in DATOS-A treatment\nprograms (ie, almost three quarters of patients in ODF pro-\ngrams stayed less than 3 months). Thus, strategies spe-\ncific to adolescents are needed to improve retention and\ncompletion of drug treatment by adolescent patients in or-\nder to maximize therapeutic benefits.25 Additionally, as we\nhave discussed earlier, many of these adolescents were\ntroubled by multiple problems. While this is comparable\nto findings for adult drug users, the timely resolution of\ntheseproblemsmaybeevenmorecriticaltosuccessfultreat-\nmentforadolescents,consideringtheirdevelopmentalpro-\ncess. Failure to address adolescents' drug use and related\nproblems in the context of the additional need to com-\nplete stage-appropriate developmental tasks can delay or\nfrustrate adolescents' capacity to assume behaviors criti-\ncal to responsible adulthood. A large body of research has\ndemonstrated that drug use and other antisocial behav-\niors initiated in adolescence are frequently maintained\nthroughyoungadulthood.26-31 Howtoeffectivelyassistado-\nlescent patients to address the multiple problems in their\nlives, especially those involving their close family mem-\nbers or friends, represents a continuing challenge to the\ntreatment field.\nNational multisite and multimodality naturalistic\nevaluations such as the DATOS-A effort have the advan-\ntage of representing patients and services in the real world,\nthereby strengthening the external validity of research\nfindings and enhancing the generalizability of find-\nings.17,18 The limitations of such research are that nei-\nther treatment modalities nor types of programs that pa-\ntients enter are controlled. The DATOS-A sample of\nprograms was purposive, intending to represent stable\nprograms of specific types operating in the communi-\nties, rather than designed to be representative of all ado-\nlescent treatment programs. Thus, the study results may\nnot be generalizable to programs that are not similar to\nthose that participated in DATOS-A. Other limitations\ninclude the following: a 33% loss of sample at 1 year of\nposttreatment follow-up; the fact that study results are\nmostly based on self-report; and the fact that treatment\neffects may be somewhat inflated, particularly for pa-\ntients in RES programs because those patients lost to fol-\nlow-up seemed to have shorter lengths of stay in treat-\nment than those who completed follow-up interviews.\nNevertheless, naturalistic studies such as DATOS-A that\nroutinely monitor and evaluate typical treatment pro-\ngrams for adolescent patients who abuse drugs are needed.\nThey provide the information necessary for developing\nstrategies that improve treatment and treatment poli-\ncies. The present DATOS-A study makes an important\ncontribution to our understanding of adolescents' drug\nuse and their outcomes in drug treatment. The results\nof the present study further underscore the importance\nof evaluations of adolescent treatment that consider ado-\nlescent-specific issues such as different patterns of alco-\nhol and drug use; the roles of family, school, and peers;\ndevelopmental processes; and the types of treatment ado-\nlescent patients are referred to.\nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) as part of a\nCooperative Agreement on DATOS.
