    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Recent Medicare buy-in proposals agree on setting eligibility at age\nsixty-two but disagree on linking eligibility to loss of employer insurance or ability\nto pay. We examine arguments for targeting incremental coverage for older\nAmericans in these ways. While access to retiree health insurance is declining,\nwe question whether targeting loss of employer insurance can address many\nolder Americans' insurance problems. Furthermore, focusing on persons ages\nsixty-two to sixty-four misses a large group of persons in poor health with limited\nresources. Efforts to improve coverage for older Americans should consider\ntrade-offs between defining eligibility by age versus ability to pay.\nIn each of the last three years of his presidency, Bill\nClinton proposed in his State of the Union message to allow\nolder Americans to buy into Medicare when they reach age\nsixty-two. Until the third year, when Clinton introduced a general\n25 percent tax credit to defray buy-in costs, the plan conspicuously\navoided government subsidies. All buy-in costs were to be borne by\nenrollees. Even in its final iteration, the Clinton plan makes no\nspecial provision for those who cannot pay for insurance. However,\nClinton does explicitly target \"displaced workers\" for assistance,\nallowing people who lost their jobs and insurance because of plant\nclosings, company relocations, slack work, or the elimination of\ntheir positions to buy into Medicare at their own expense after age\nfifty-five. The final version of the Clinton plan also includes a general\ntax credit to help former employees exercise their right to extend\nemployer insurance for eighteen months under the Consolidated\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).1\nAnother Medicare buy-in proposal, developed by Pamela Loprest\n\u00a92001 ProjectHOPE\u00adThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nDennis Shea and Pamela Short are professors of health policy and administration, and\nPaige Powell is a doctoral candidate in the same department at the Pennsylvania State\nUniversity.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nM E D I C A R E B U Y - I N\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In contrast to the Clinton plan, the\nLoprest-Moon proposal is specifically designed with subsidies ac-\ncording to ability to pay (with free enrollment for the poor and\nreduced premiums up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level).\nThere are no provisions in this plan for people who lose their jobs or\nemployer coverage.2\nThere seems to be agreement on setting the minimum eligibility\nage at sixty-two for a Medicare buy-in but considerable disagree-\nment on linking eligibility to the loss of employer coverage or ability\nto pay. Here we examine the arguments for and against targeting\nassistance for older Americans in each of these ways.\nOur findings rely on analysis of data from the March 1999 Current\nHealth and Retirement Survey (HRS). The surveys provide comple-\nmentary information. The CPS offers a recent, cross-sectional look\nat the insurance, employment, income, and health status of the\npopulation nearing age sixty-five. The HRS, although less recent,\nprovides information about changes in insurance, employment, as-\nsets, and income as persons approach age sixty-five.3 All differences\ndiscussed in the text are significant at the p < .05 level or better.\nCoverage Patterns By Age\nThere are good reasons for targeting the 62\u00ad64 age group, since\naccess to employer insurance is reduced as people approach age\nsixty-five and retire. Consequently, older Americans rely most heav-\nily on individual insurance, which is expensive and limited for peo-\nple with serious health problems. Furthermore, because average\nhealth expenses increase sharply with age (by 50 percent from the\ndata from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey), the group closest\nto age sixty-five faces the greatest risk of being uninsured and being\ncharged the highest premiums in the individual market.\nDespite these concerns, we do not find marked differences in\ncoverage by age that would require policymakers to draw the line at\nage sixty-two. Retirement from full-time work peaks at age sixty-\ntwo, when older Americans become eligible for Social Security (Ex-\nhibit 1). However, in contrast with retirement rates, the disenroll-\nment rate from employer insurance across older age groups is flat.\nThis may partly be the result of lower retirement rates among persons\nwho would not be covered by employer insurance if they retired.4\nn Job-based insurance. Overall enrollment in employer insur-\nance declines well before age sixty-two (Exhibit 2). Although en-\nrollment in employer insurance in our 1998 data fell still farther\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In addition, the gap in employer insurance\namong those ages 62\u00ad64 was filled by increased individual insurance.\nAs a result, new policies that focus on persons ages 62\u00ad64 may\nmiss a large number of older persons who would benefit from cover-\nage reforms. Little more than a quarter of the 1998 uninsured popu-\nlation ages 55\u00ad64 were age sixty-two or older (about 0.9 million out\nof 3.4 million), and fewer than a third of the individually insured in\nthis age group were age sixty-two or older (about 0.5 million out of\nThese patterns raise additional issues about targeting the loss of\nemployer insurance. Partly because people retire only if they have\nretiree benefits, the percentage of persons losing employer insur-\nance is relatively small (Exhibit 1). In the early 1990s employers\ncontinued to cover more than four of every five insured persons who\nquit working in their fifties and early sixties (HRS data not shown).\nThe differences we found in employer insurance by age still imply\nthat many older Americans successfully negotiate employment tran-\nsitions with their insurance intact, but access to the benefits that\nallow this transition is declining. However, since recent data sug-\ngest that access to retiree coverage declined by more than 10 percent\nto lose coverage at retirement in the future.5\nRelatively few of the uninsured or individually insured at older\nages are people who recently lost employer insurance. In the early\nwithout coverage for two years or more.6 More recent data also\nindicate that more than half of uninsured persons ages 50\u00ad64 have\nbeen uninsured for three or more years.7 Employers covered fewer\nthan one of every five uninsured persons in the HRS within the\npreceding two years. After age sixty-two, more uninsured were re-\ncent disenrollees from individual insurance (19 percent) than from\nemployer insurance (15 percent), and people who bought individual\ninsurance after age sixty-two were more likely to have been unin-\nsured than to have lost employer insurance.8\nn Policy implications. These statistics imply that offering rela-\ntively short-term coverage extensions to people who lose employer\ninsurance, such as through COBRA or a Medicare buy-in, will miss\nmost of the uninsured and individually insured. Providing long-term\naccess to Medicare, beginning at a much earlier age than sixty-two,\ncould eventually fill the gaps between employer insurance and\nMedicare for most people. However, such a policy would initially\nmiss people who had already lost employer coverage. Even in the\nlong run, focusing on people who leave employer insurance after age\nfifty-five still misses a relatively large number of people in their early\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Accord-\ning to HRS data on persons ages 53\u00ad63 (not shown), more than\npercent of the long-term uninsured, who made up two-thirds of the\nAbility To Pay And Health Insurance Reforms\nInsuring people who are close to age sixty-five is expensive, even\nthrough a Medicare buy-in. Analyses of Medicare buy-in proposals\nAmericans with incomes at 200 percent of poverty who had no\nassets would have to spend about 20 percent of their resources, and\nthose at the poverty line would have to spend more than one-third of\ntheir resources, on a Medicare buy-in premium. Thus, people with\nlimited resources are unlikely to participate without assistance.\nReforms that do not consider ability to pay will exacerbate the\nexisting economic disparities among older Americans. Coverage\npatterns vary more widely by income than by any other factor (Ex-\nhibit 3). The uninsured percentage in 1998 was more than four times\nhigher and employer coverage four times lower for people below\npoverty than for people above 300 percent of poverty. Despite high\npremiums, the poor enroll in individual insurance at almost twice\nthe rate as do those with incomes over 300 percent of poverty.\nFurthermore, because the uninsured and individually insured are\nconcentrated at lower income levels, strategies that do not subsidize\nolder Americans with limited economic resources are likely to miss\na large percentage of the group who would benefit. If one considers\nn Assessing financial status. While they point to economic\ndisparities, statistics relating insurance status to current income\nprobably understate the ability of some older Americans to pay for\ninsurance. Because many people in this age group have already re-\ntired, current income may not be a good measure of economic status\nor ability to pay. Even if there were agreement on targeting by ability\nto pay, designing a consistent and accurate means test is challenging.\nTo explore this issue, we examine prior income and assets of\npersons who turned age sixty-two between the first two waves of\nthe HRS. Thirty-seven percent of such persons with incomes below\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nM E D I C A R E B U Y - I N\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This means that many persons ages 62\u00ad64 who would\nqualify for free coverage under income-based subsidies would not\nhave qualified for subsidies before turning sixty-two.\nBecause enrollment in individual insurance is a sign of economic\nadvantage, the individually insured with low incomes are even more\nlikely than the uninsured to be better off. Considering the entire age\ncohort covered by the HRS (data not shown), where the sample size\nis sufficient to make these estimates, 60 percent of the individually\npoverty in 1991, while almost two-thirds of the uninsured in poverty\nindividually insured between 100 and 200 percent of poverty were\ntwice as likely as the uninsured in the same income range to have\nthese patterns, methods used to determine ability to pay may differ-\nentially affect these two key groups.\nPercentage Distribution Of Americans Ages Fifty To Sixty-Four, By Insurance Status\nAge\nEmployment status\nFull time/full year\nPart time/full year\nFull time/part year\nPart time/part year\nRetired\nOther\nAnnual income\nBelow poverty\nSelf-reported health status\nExcellent\nVery good\nGood\nFair\nPoor\nWork disability\nLimited and not working\nLimited and working\nNot limited\nSOURCE: Current Population Survey, March 1999.\nNOTES: Subgroup percentages may not sum to 100 percent because of rounding.

Three groups would primarily benefit. First, about 350,000\npersons with individual insurance above 200 percent of poverty\nmight participate in a Medicare buy-in if its premium were lower\nthan their current private premium. This would depend on adminis-\ntrative costs, adverse selection, and other factors.\nIn addition, 190,000 individually insured persons with incomes\nbelow 200 percent of poverty might also benefit from a Medicare\nbuy-in. They have shown their willingness to buy insurance, and the\nbuy-in might offer a cost advantage over their current coverage.\nthan 200 percent of poverty might also benefit from an unsubsidized\nMedicare buy-in. These people arguably have the means to pay for\nhealth insurance. Lower premiums and the elimination of health-\nrelated coverage limitations through a Medicare buy-in might en-\ncourage them to enroll. Given the cost of the unsubsidized Medicare\nbuy-in premium, it is unlikely that many uninsured persons below\n200 percent of poverty would participate.\nThere are several important differences in the characteristics of\nthe three groups most likely to benefit from such a buy-in (Exhibit\n5). While more than half of the individually insured with incomes\ngood health, almost one-third of those with incomes below 200\npercent of poverty were in fair or poor health. The health of the\nuninsured above 200 percent of poverty most closely resembled that\nBelow poverty\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nM E D I C A R E B U Y - I N\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Persons in both\nwhile just 22 percent of the individually insured under 200 percent\nof poverty worked.\nAdding income-related subsidies to a program for people ages\n62\u00ad64, similar to those proposed by Loprest and Moon, would en-\ncourage participation by uninsured persons below 200 percent of\npoverty. In most respects, the nearly 500,000 uninsured persons\nwith incomes below 200 percent of poverty were similar to the\nindividually insured at the same income level (Exhibit 5).\nExtending eligibility to a younger age group, such as those ages\n55\u00ad61, would greatly expand the size of the program. An additional\n3.6 million uninsured or individually insured persons were in this\nage group in 1998.

The higher-income\ngroups in both age groups in Exhibit 5 have similar characteristics.\nA program with income-related subsidies that included the\nyounger age group would enhance participation among those below\n200 percent of poverty. The health of those with low incomes in this\nage group was similar to the health of those in the older age group\nwith the same insurance and income. While low-income persons\nage 55\u00ad61 were more likely than their older counterparts to be work-\ning, they were also more likely to be poor.\nA program that considered the larger age group (ages 55\u00ad64) but\nrestricted eligibility to persons with incomes below 200 percent of\npoverty, similar to recent expansions of children's health insurance,\nwould target almost 2.5 million persons. As noted above, low-\nincome persons ages 55\u00ad61 were in as poor health as and had lower\nincomes than low-income persons ages 62\u00ad64. The poor health of\nthis low-income group would result in much higher premiums com-\npared with programs that offered broader eligibility.\nDiscussion\nOur results shed light on the merits of targeting assistance for older\nAmericans by age, income, and access to employer insurance. Our\nfindings raise several questions about each approach.\nn Targeting those who lose employer insurance. The steady\nerosion of employer coverage as people approach age sixty-five\nmeans that a program targeting the loss of this coverage would reach\nrelatively few persons in the short run. Few currently uninsured or\nindividually insured persons have a recent history of disenrolling\nfrom employer insurance. In addition, many older Americans retire\nbefore age sixty-five without loss of employer insurance, so target-\ning this group may crowd out current private arrangements. Finally,\ntargeting those who lose employer insurance helps people who are\neconomically better off than people excluded by that strategy.\nOn the other hand, the current high rate of employer insurance\namong retirees occurs partly because many people only retire if they\nwill have insurance afterwards. If retiree health benefits continue to\ndecline, some of these persons could pay for their own insurance at\nlittle cost to the government if given access to group insurance or\nMedicare. Furthermore, focusing on the loss of employer coverage,\nas the Clinton plan does, may avoid crowding out private insurance.\nWhether it is better to proceed with a relatively low cost program\nthat targets the upper middle class or a potentially more costly\nprogram for the lower middle class is an ongoing debate.\nn Targeting according to age. Our results suggest that age\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ J a n u a r y / F e b r u a r y 2 0 0 1\nM E D I C A R E B U Y - I N\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Coverage changes steadily through-\nout the years approaching age sixty-five, rather than precipitously at\nage sixty-two. Consequently, policies directed at persons ages\n62\u00ad64 miss many older Americans who could benefit from access to\ngroup insurance. In particular, it misses a large number of uninsured\npoverty who are in as poor health as and have even lower incomes\nOne problem with a lower eligibility age is the likely effect on\nearlier retirement.12 Many policy analysts recommend incentives for\nlonger work lives as the baby boomers approach retirement. Target-\ning people at younger ages runs counter to current trends in Social\nSecurity and raises further questions about the ability to fund health\nand income security programs for future generations.\nn Focusing on the poor. Focusing reforms on adults with lim-\nited economic resources is consistent with current incremental ex-\npansions targeted at the parents of children eligible for Medicaid or\nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).13 Although\ntargeting by ability to pay is difficult, the connection between abil-\nity to pay and insurance is dramatic in this age group. Furthermore,\npersons below 200 percent of poverty, particularly the uninsured,\nface more health problems than do others at the same age.\nn Asset testing. To be fair and reliable, means testing during\nearly retirement might involve repeated or complicated income and\nasset tests. In addition to the administrative expense, asset testing\npenalizes persons who chose to save more during their working\nyears. Ideally, for persons in this age group, eligibility should be\nbased on some longer-term measure of productivity and earning\ncapacity. Such a test could be devised by considering lifetime earn-\nings data already compiled by the Social Security Administration.14\nIn addition to the administrative challenges, a means-tested pro-\ngram, especially one that targeted persons ages 55\u00ad64, would re-\nquire large subsidies because of low incomes and poor health in this\nage group. Funding from general tax revenues or the current surplus\nwould have to be identified. The costs of such an expansion could be\n\"Focusing only on persons ages sixty-two to sixty-four misses a\ngroup with significant health problems and limited resources.\"\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 0 , N u m b e r 1\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Policies that merely allow older Americans to\nbuy into Medicare without income-related subsidies will not ad-\ndress the insurance problems of those with limited economic re-\nsources in this age group. At the same time, subsidies for older\nAmericans who lack access to group coverage are likely to be expen-\nsive, because of the high health care costs and lack of economic\nresources in this age group. As a result, limiting the program by age\nis probably necessary to limit program costs.\nHowever, focusing only on persons ages sixty-two to sixty-four\nmisses an important group of older Americans with significant\nhealth problems and limited economic resources who also need ac-\ncess to more affordable insurance. While a program open to every-\none ages fifty-five to sixty-four might be too costly, a means-tested\nprogram that extended below age sixty-two could benefit a segment\nof the population that has a genuine need for assistance. Since\npolicymakers have some flexibility in choosing an age cutoff that is\neither older or younger than sixty-two, efforts to improve health\ninsurance for older Americans should give more careful considera-\ntion to the trade-offs between defining eligibility by age versus abil-\nity to pay. In the spirit of incremental reform, initial eligibility for a\nMedicare buy-in could be expanded over time by relaxing the means\ntest or lowering the age threshold, so that more older Americans\ncould benefit from Medicare.\nThis research was supported by a grant from the Commonwealth Fund.
