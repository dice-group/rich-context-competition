APACHE II scores were determined\nduring the first 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit. Plasma copeptin, CRP and\nprocalcitonin were quantified at admission, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h.

Survivors (n \u00bc 15) had significantly lower APACHE II scores and\ncopeptin, CRP and procalcitonin concentrations than nonsurvivors (n \u00bc 26). APACHE II score,\ncopeptin at 72 h, CRP at 48 h and procalcitonin at 24 h were independent risk factors for death.\nConclusion: Plasma copeptin, CRP and procalcitonin concentrations were positively correlated\nwith APACHE II score in patients with sepsis, and reflected disease severity.\n",

The Acute Physiology and\nChronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)\nis the standard method for evaluating\nsepsis,2 but other diagnostic and prognostic\nbiomarkers are being investigated.\nCopeptin, a short peptide derived from\na preprohormone consisting of vasopressin,\nneurophysin II and copeptin, is one possible\nsepsis biomarker. Vasopressin is released on\nexposure to stress such as severe infection\nand sepsis, but its small molecular size\nand short half-life make detection impracti-\ncal.3 Copeptin is a useful surrogate for\nvasopressin because it is stable in plasma\nand is released in similar quantities.4 Plasma\ncopeptin concentrations were found to be\nsignificantly higher in patients with septic\nshock than in healthy control subjects\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-\nphase protein synthesized by the liver in\nresponse to inflammation. Normal plasma\nCRP concentrations (<8 mg/l) rise signifi-\ncantly during the early phase of sepsis.6\nProcalcitonin is a 116 amino acid precursor\nof calcitonin. Plasma procalcitonin concen-\ntrations are below the limits of detection in\nhealthy individuals (0.5 ng/ml), and can\nrise to 1000 ng/ml in severe bacterial infec-\ntion or sepsis.7 Procalcitonin has a half-life\nare correlated with severity of sepsis in\npatients in the intensive care unit (ICU).9\nThe aim of this study was to determine\nplasma concentrations of copeptin, CRP and\nprocalcitonin in patients with sepsis, and\nevaluate their correlations with APACHE II\nscores. The diagnostic and prognostic value\nof these biomarkers is discussed.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective study included patients\nwith sepsis who were treated in the ICU of\nDalian Medical University First Hospital,\nDalian, Liaoning, China between May 2012\naccording to guidelines of the Surviving\nwere: (i) cardiovascular disease (e.g. acute\ncoronary syndrome, rheumatic heart dis-\nease, congenital heart disease); (ii) multiple\ntrauma with injury severity score >15; (iii)\nheart failure; (iv) death within 72 h of\nadmission; (v) incomplete clinical data.\nThis study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of DaLian Medical University\nFirst Hospital, and written informed con-\nsent was obtained from each patient or their\nnext-of-kin.\nData collection\nVenous blood (10 ml) was collected on admis-\nadmission. Uncoagulated blood was centri-\nresulting plasma was analysed. Copeptin,\nCRP and procalcitonin were quantified\nusing enzyme linked immunosorbent assay\nkits (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame,\nCA, USA; Roche, Basel, Switzerland; and\nBRAHMS Diagostica GmbH, Germany,\nrespectively), according to the manufacturers'\ninstructions. APACHE II scores were\nassigned, based on the most pessimistic clin-\nical and laboratory data obtained during the\nfirst 24h following admission. Patients were\nfollowed-up for 28 days after admission, and\nthe 28-day mortality rate was calculated.\nStatistical analyses\nContinuous data were expressed as\nmean\u00c6 SD and compared using Kruskal\u00ad\nWallis or Mann\u00adWhitney U-test. Categorical\ndata were expressed as n (%) and compared\nusing 2-test. Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient was used to evaluate associa-\ntions between APACHE II score and\nplasma concentrations of copeptin, CRP\nand procalcitonin. Prognostic factors were\nanalysed using multivariate logistic regres-\nsion analysis. Receiver operating characteris-\ntic (ROC) curves of copeptin, CRP and\nprocalcitonin were generated and the area\nunder the curve (AUC) was calculated. All\nstatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5. P-values <0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nrespectively (P < 0.05). The mean APACHE\nII score was significantly higher in patients\nwho died within 28 days of admission\n(n \u00bc 26) compared with survivors (n \u00bc 15;\nThere were significant positive correl-\nations between APACHE II score and\nplasma copeptin, CRP and procalcitonin\nconcentrations at all timepoints (Table 1).\nData regarding plasma concentrations of\ncopeptin, CRP and procalcitonin in patients\nstratified according to APACHE II scores\nare given in Table 2.

Serum cortisol concentrations\nhave been shown to reflect an individual's\nstress levels and can be used to predict the\noutcome of patients with sepsis or pneumo-\nnia.11 Copeptin concentrations provide a\nmore accurate reflection of stress severity\nthan cortisol levels.12\nCopeptin concentration can independ-\nently predict the survival of critically ill\npatients with haemorrhagic and septic\nshock,13 and is significantly elevated in\npatients with lower respiratory tract infec-\ntions compared with healthy controls.14\nAdditionally, copeptin concentration has\nbeen shown to be associated with the\nseverity of pneumonia, as based on a pneu-\nmonia severity index. Plasma copeptin\nconcentrations increased significantly with\nhigher APACHE II scores in the present\nstudy, reflecting the severity of sepsis.\nIn addition, plasma copeptin concentrations\nwere significantly higher in patients who\ndied within 28 days of admission than in\npatients who survived. In accordance\nshowed that plasma copeptin could be used\nto evaluate the severity of sepsis. In add-\nition, the present finding that elevated\ncopeptin concentration at 72 h after admis-\nsion was associated with increased mortality\nsuggests that this parameter could be used to\npredict sepsis-related patient death.\nElevated CRP concentrations represent\nan acute-phase response to acute tissue\ninjuries such as those produced by surgery,\ninfection or acute inflammation, and signify\nthe body's attempt to neutralize the in-\nflammatory agent and promote healing of\nTable 2.

Plasma CRP concentrations were\npositively correlated with APACHE II\nscores and reflected the severity of sepsis in\nthe present study, in accordance with the\nfindings of others.21\nAnimal studies indicate that procalcito-\nnin plays a pathophysiological role in the\ndevelopment of severe sepsis and is asso-\nciated with mortality. Treatment with pro-\ncalcitonin was shown to double the death\nrate in animals,21 whereas injection with\nan antiprocalcitonin antibody increased\nthe survival of animals with sepsis.21\u00ad24\nProcalcitonin is an accurate biomarker\nfor severe infection,25,26 and for the diagno-\nsis of bacterial sepsis and bacteraemia.27\nProcalcitonin concentration has also been\nused to guide the empirical antibiotic treat-\nment of sepsis patients,28 and, in accordance\nwith our findings, is known to reflect\nthe severity of infection as well as\nhaving prognostic implications for crit-\nically ill patients.29 An advantage of\nprocalcitonin over other biomarkers is that\nits production is not significantly affected by\nnonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory\nOur study has several limitations. The\nsample size was small and caution should\nbe used when interpreting the results. In\nFigure 1. Receiver operating characteristic curves for plasma concentrations of copeptin, procalcitonin\n(PTC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in predicting survival of patients with sepsis. Times shown are after\nadmission to intensive care unit\naddition, copeptin concentrations at 72 h\nafter admission were a less-useful predictive\nfactor for death compared with procalcito-\nnin at 24 h, since patients may have already\ndied by 72 h after admission.\nIn conclusion, plasma copeptin, CRP and\nprocalcitonin concentrations were positively\ncorrelated with APACHE II score in\npatients with sepsis, and therefore reflected\ndisease severity. APACHE II score, copep-\ntin concentration at 72 h, CRP concentra-\ntion at 48 h and procalcitonin concentration\nat 24 h were independent risk factors for\ndeath in patients with sepsis.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
