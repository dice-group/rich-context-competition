    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aimed to test the reliability and validity of a Norwegian measure of adolescents' intentions to be physically active\nafter graduation (the Intention to be Physically Active After Graduation [IPAG] Questionnaire). The development of IPAG\ninvolved a translation and back-translation procedure and a test\u00adretest study, performed on 105 adolescents (M age = 17.1,\nSD = 0.6) from three different high schools in Kristiansand, Norway. The four IPAG items loaded on one single factor,\ndemonstrating acceptable factor loadings (.68-.90) and acceptable Cronbach's alpha values (.84 and .84) in both the test and\nretest assessment. IPAG correlated positively with a measure of attitudes toward physical activity (.61-.71) and a measure of\nparticipants' intentions to be physically active next month (.77-.82), supporting both construct validity and criterion-related\nvalidity of the IPAG-Questionnaire. Acceptable reliability and validity of IPAG was found, which supports the use of this\ninstrument in future research.\n",

In this sense, intention to be physically\nactive should predict future physical activity participation.\nThe World Health Organization (2004) states that \"physical\nactivity is a fundamental means of improving the physical\nand mental health of individuals\" (p. 3). However, inactivity\nlevels are rising in many countries, increasing the prevalence\nof non-communicable diseases, and thus negatively affecting\nthe general population health (World Health Organization,\n2004). Interventions aiming to reverse this trend might ben-\nefit from valid measures of intentions to engage in future\nphysical activity.\nAccording to the TPB, peoples intentions to engage in\nfuture physical activity is the most important predictor of sub-\nsequent physical activity behavior (Ajzen, 1991), and the rela-\ntionship between intention and behavior is well acknowledged\ntion\u00adbehavior relationship is well established, both theoreti-\nMcEachan, Conner, Taylor, & Lawton, 2011). Indeed, de\nBruijn and van den Putte (2012) have argued that intention is\na necessary predictor of exercise behavior (see Erdvik,\n\u00d8verby, & Haugen, 2014, for more information regarding\nthe intention\u00adbehavior relationship). Research on the\nIntentions to be Physically Active After Graduation (IPAG)\nQuestionnaire may therefore be of high relevance with\nrespect to the development of future Norwegian interven-\ntions targeting adolescent's physical activity behavior, allow-\ning not only for the assessment of the intervention programs'\nability to influence on adolescents' physical activity behav-\nior but also its ability to positively influence physically\nactive adolescents who are at risk of taking on a physically\ninactive lifestyle. Based on the former, measuring adoles-\ncents' intentions to be active might help professionals and\nacademics in identifying groups that are at risk for taking on\na physically inactive lifestyle.\n1Hedmark University College, Elverum, Norway\n2University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nIrina Burchard Erdvik, Faculty of Public Health, Department of Sports and\nElverum, Norway.\nEmail: irina.erdvik@hihm.no\nTranslating, Reliability Testing, and\nValidating a Norwegian Questionnaire\nto Assess Adolescents' Intentions to\nbe Physically Active After High School\nGraduation\nIrina Burchard Erdvik1, Nina Cecilie \u00d8verby2,\nand Tommy Haugen2\n Keywords\ntest\u00adretest, validation, intention, physical activity\n2 SAGE Open\nThe purpose of this study was to translate, test the reliabil-\nity, and validate a Norwegian version of a questionnaire\nassessing students' intentions to be physically active after\ngraduation. The IPAG-Questionnaire was originally devel-\noped for use in a study by Hein, M\u00fc\u00fcr, and Koka (2004) on\n14- to 18-year-old adolescents, and has since been translated\ninto Spanish (Moreno, Moreno, & Cervell\u00f3, 2007) and used\nin previous studies on Spanish adolescents (also called the\n\"Intention to be Physically Active Scale\" [IPAS]; Almagro,\nS\u00e1enz-L\u00f3pez, & Moreno, 2010; Moreno-Murcia, Hu\u00e9scar\nHern\u00e1ndez, & Cervell\u00f3, 2012). The herein validated IPAG\nmeasure has also been used in Norwegian research by Erdvik\net al. (2014) assessing the contribution of self-determined\nmotivation in physical education to adolescents' intentions to\nbe physically activity after graduation. However, the IPAG-\nQuestionnaire has to the best of our knowledge not been vali-\ndated for Norwegian adolescents. Research articles regarding\nother Norwegian instruments assessing physical activity\nintentions have to our knowledge not been published, and\nhave consequently not been made accessible to the research\ncommunity. In addition, compared with other measures of\nphysical activity intention (e.g., Escart\u00ed & Guti\u00e9rrez, 2001;\nHagger, Chatzisarantis, & Biddle, 2002; Ommundsen, unpub-\nlished data), the IPAG-Questionnaire measures intentions in a\nmore distant future. One may also argue that the time per-\nspective found in the IPAG-Questionnaire (i.e., intention to\nbe physically active after graduation) makes IPAG qualita-\ntively different from other instruments. This difference may\nalso contribute to making IPAG a potentially useful instru-\nment in intervention studies aiming for long-term effects.\nTo make the IPAG-Questionnaire accessible for the use in\na Norwegian setting, this study involved translation, reliabil-\nity testing, and validation of IPAG. A translation back-\ntranslation of the IPAG items was therefore performed,\nbefore the instrument was subject to a test\u00adretest procedure\nfor the assessment of reliability, criterion-related validity,\nand construct validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSecond-year students attending three different high schools in\nKristiansand, Norway, were invited to take part in the study,\nwhich was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data\nServices (NSD). The data collection took place in the months\nof November and December 2012. Informed consent was\ngiven by participants prior to responding to the question-\nnaire, and the participants were free to withdraw from the\nstudy at any time. One hundred fifty-two second-year high\nschool students participated in the test\u00adretest study, of which\n0.6) provided complete responses in both test and retest pro-\ncedure, forming the basis for subsequent reliability and\nvalidity testing.\nInstruments\nDevelopment of the IPAG-Questionnaire. The four items of the\nIPAG-Questionnaire were translated into Norwegian using\nthe method of forward and back-translation, following the\nguidelines proposed by Kvamme et al. (1998). The questions\nwere translated from their original English format producing\ntwo separate Norwegian versions: one proposed by the first\nauthor, another by a bilingual British colleague working at\nthe Institute of Foreign Languages and Translation. Bearing\nelements of the two separate translations in mind, the transla-\ntions were then merged to produce one single Norwegian\nversion. The bilingual associate professor translated the Nor-\nwegian version back into English and assisted comparing the\nback-translated items with the four original English ques-\ntionnaire items to ensure that the correct meaning of the con-\ntent was retained. Through this process, the Norwegian items\nwere changed to better reflect nuances in the English word-\ning and subsequent understanding (see Table 1).\nThe IPAG-Questionnaire consists of four questions con-\ncerning students' intentions to be physically active after\ngraduation. Students reported their intentions to be active\nafter graduation on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored from\n(1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. Students were\nasked to consider the following statements: (1) \"I'm inter-\nested in developing my physical fitness\"; (2) \"Outside PE\nlessons, I like to do sport\"; (3) \"After graduation, I would\nlike to take part in sport club training\"; (4) \"After graduation,\nI would like to be physically active.\" The mean score of the\nfour items was derived into an index representing respond-\nTable 1.

Original version of the IPAG-Questionnaire is derived from Hein, M\u00fc\u00fcr, and Koka (2004). IPAG = Intention to be Physically Active After\nGraduation.\nErdvik et al. 3\nBecause Russel and Bobko (1992) recommend the use of\n7-point Likert-type scales over 5-point scales and Dawes\n(2008) argues that changing scale format does not necessar-\nily destroy the comparability of historical data, IPAG was\nvalidated on a 7-point Likert-type scale.\nAttitudes.A questionnaire assessing attitudes toward physi-\ncal activity was included in the test\u00adretest questionnaire.\nThis questionnaire asks for respondents' attitudes toward\nphysical activity and was derived from research by Lorent-\nzen (2007). The questionnaire was based on the following\nstatements (originally in Norwegian): \"Being regularly phys-\nically active, the next month will to me be [sic]\": (1) \"stupid\"\nto (7) \"wise,\" (1) \"harmful\" to (7) \"valuable\" [sic], (1) \"use-\nless\" to (7) \"useful,\" (1) \"wrong\" to (7) \"right,\" (1) \"trouble-\nsome\" to (7) \"easy,\" (1) \"unpleasant\" to (7) \"pleasant,\" (1)\n\"bad\" to (7) \"good,\" (1) \"boring\" to (7) \"interesting.\" One\nrepresented the most negative attitude and seven the most\npositive. As in the study by Lorentzen (2007), no definition\nof regular physical activity was given.\nIntention to be Physically Active Next Month (INM-Q).A six-\nitem questionnaire measuring adolescents' intentions to be\nphysically active next month (INM-Q) was also included in\nthe test\u00adretest questionnaire. This instrument was derived\nfrom research by Ommundsen (unpublished data). All ques-\ntions were anchored on a 7-point Likert-type scale, of which\nfour were anchored from (1) \"no, absolutely not\" to (7) \"yes,\nabsolutely\" (e.g., \"I intend to be regularly physically active\nwithin the next month\"), whereas the two last items were\nanchored (1) \"very unlikely\" to (7) \"very likely\" (e.g., \"How\nlikely is it that you will be regularly physically active during\nthe next month?\"). The INM-Q has been validated for use by\nOmmundsen (unpublished data) who reported a Cronbach's\nalpha of .95 for the six-item subscale.\nRespondents were also asked to report age and gender\n(boy/girl) as a demographic data.\nProcedure\nThis study involved a test\u00adretest procedure for the validation\nof the IPAG-Questionnaire. Physical activity intentions were\nconsidered to be relative stable and, for the validation the\nIPAG-Questionnaire, adolescents' were thus asked to answer\nthe same questions two times with 1 week between test and\nretest. The test\u00adretest procedure allowed for the calculation\nof test\u00adretest reliability coefficients for each of the four sin-\ngle items comprising the IPAG-Questionnaire. Single items\nwere considered ordinal data and indexes were considered\ninterval data.\nStatistical Analyses\nSeveral statistical analyses were performed to assess the reli-\nability and validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire. Whereas test\nand retest measures concerning the complete IPAG-\nQuestionnaire was considered continuous and normally dis-\ntributed, data on each single item constituting the\nIPAG-Questionnaire was considered ordinal (categories\nfrom 1 to 7). Consequently, test\u00adretest correlations and\npaired difference tests between single items were assessed\nthrough non-parametric analyses (Spearman's rank correla-\ntion and Wilcoxon-signed ranks test), and test\u00adretest mea-\nsures concerning the complete IPAG index were assessed\nthrough parametric analyses (Pearson's correlation and\npaired sample t test).\nIn an attempt to embed the measure of adolescents' inten-\ntions to be physically active after graduation in a nomologi-\ncal network (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955), the survey also\nassessed other constructs which were thought to be related to\nthe IPAG-Questionnaire. Based on the measured constructs,\ncriterion-related and construct validity of the IPAG-\nQuestionnaire were examined. Criterion-related validity\nmay, according to DeVellis (2012), be assessed through the\ninvestigation of empirical association between a measure\nand some criterion. Consequently, a measure of intention to\nbe physically active next month (INM-Q; Ommundsen,\nunpublished data) was used as a criterion for the validation\nof the IPAG-Questionnaire. As the two questionnaires mea-\nsuring physical activity intentions (IPAG and INM-Q) were\nassumed to measure the somewhat same characteristics, the\nINM-Q was theoretically assumed to be positively related to\nthe IPAG-Questionnaire without sharing a large degree of\nvariance. According to DeVellis (2012), a measures con-\nstruct validity is reflected in \"the extent to which a measure\n`behaves' the way that the construct it purports to measure\nshould behave with regard to established measures of other\nIPAG was assessed in this study through the comparison of\nadolescents'attitudes toward physical activity with scores on\nthe IPAG-Questionnaire. According to the TPB (Ajzen,\ncontrol and social norms regarding physical activity) are\namong the most important predictors of intention to be phys-\nically active. Thus, there should be a positive relationship\nbetween participants' attitudes toward physical activity and\ntheir intentions to be physically active after graduation.\nCriterion-related validity and construct validity were deter-\nmined through the assessment of differences in mean between\nIPAG and the two other measured constructs. The test\u00adretest\ncorrelation between items and potential statistically significant\ndifferences between the test and retest assessment regarding\nthe same items were assessed using Wilcoxon-signed rank\ntest. Furthermore, the subscale total from test and retest were\nassessed by comparing the mean and standard deviation from\nthe test- and retest-assessments, and correlating test and retest\nvalues. A paired t test was utilized to ensure that there was no\nstatistically significant difference between data from the two\nmeasurement procedures. Furthermore, psychometric proper-\nties of the IPAG-Questionnaire were assessed through\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 4.

The IPAG-\nQuestionnaire utilized in this study represents a Norwegian\nversion of the scale developed by Hein and colleagues (2004,\nsee Table 1). Research results provided preliminary evidence\nforsoundpsychometricpropertiesoftheIPAG-Questionnaire.\nResults from the present test\u00adretest analyses, which were\nperformed on high school students (age 16-18 years), indi-\ncate that participants' test and retest responses were consis-\ntent.

This is\nbecause of limitations related to test\u00adretest reliability testing\nof questionnaires, like the potential for learning, carryover\neffects and recall effects (Allen &Yen, 1979; Marx, Menezes,\nHorovitz, Jones, & Warren, 2003). According to Marx et al.\n(2003), most researchers have chosen a time interval between\ntest and retest ranging from 2 days to 2 weeks. This time\nframe is generally perceived to be a reasonable compromise\nin avoiding both the recollection bias and actual changes in\nthe empirically measured phenomenon (Marx et al., 2003).\nThe reliability of a measure may appear low if the time inter-\nval between assessments is relatively long, and the socio-\npsychological construct is unstable (Allen & Yen, 1979). The\nmeasure of adolescents' intentions to be physically active\nnext month was considered less stable than the measure of\nintention to be physically active after graduation. The longer\ntime interval between the two assessments, the more changes\none need to expect in subsequent answers (Allen & Yen,\n1979). Hence, in an attempt to strengthen the reliability of\nthe present study, the retest assessment was performed the\nweek following the test-assessment. However, whether the\nherein chosen time interval is too short or too long is difficult\nto determine. Nevertheless, considering that the IPAG-\nQuestionnaire measures intentions in a more distant future,\nconsiderable change from 1 week to another was not\nexpected.\nThe study results revealed a strong correlation between\nIPAG and Lorentzen's (2007) measure of adolescents' atti-\ntudes toward physical activity (test = .61, retest = .71). This\nindicates that respondents who intend to be more physically\nactive after graduation also possess more positive attitudes\ntoward physical activity. However, the IPAG-Questionnaire\nappears to correlate even stronger with the INM-\nQuestionnaire by Ommundsen (unpublished data; test = .77,\nretest = .82), showing that intention to be physically active\nnext month is strongly associated with adolescents' inten-\ntions to be physically active after graduation. Altogether,\nthese findings support both construct validity and criterion-\nrelated validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire and strengthens\nthe assumption that the questionnaire is adequate for measur-\ning adolescents' intentions to be physically active after\ngraduation.\nHowever it should be noted that, despite researchers\nacknowledging intention as a predictor of behavior (Webb &\nSheeran, 2006), it is still not completely clear to which degree\nintention to be physically active after graduation has the abil-\nity to predict future behavior. It has been identified that 24%\nto 60% of reported intentions are followed by behavior, with\nthe occurrence of physical activity behavior being dramati-\ncally lower in the group of non-intenders than in the group of\nintenders (de Bruijn & van den Putte, 2012; Rhodes,\ntion may be considered a prerequisite of exercise behavior,\nphysical activity intentions among youth should be consid-\nered relevant in a public health perspective. However, it\nshould be noted that assessing the predictive validity of IPAG\nhas not been of focus in the present study and longitudinal\nresearch is necessary to further determine the predictive abil-\nity of the IPAG-Questionnaire and similar instruments.\nAnother limitation in this study is related to the criterion-\nrelated validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire being determined\nthrough comparison with an unpublished intention measure,\nbecause this was the only identified Norwegian measure of\nphysical activity intentions. The current study also has lim-\nited information about participants with regards to relevant\nbackground information such as demographics and physical\nactivity level. Moreover, the sample only consists of 105\nseventeen-year-old adolescents from one medium-sized city\nin Norway. These limitations should be considered when\ninterpreting the findings from this work, and future research\nwould do well to further explore the validity of the\nIPAG-Questionnaire.\nConclusion\nThis aim of this study was to assess the reliability and valid-\nity of four questionnaire items originally developed by Hein\net al. (2004) for the measurement of students'intentions to be\nphysically active after graduation. The IPAG-Questionnaire\nappears to be acceptable for use among Norwegian adoles-\ncents in the age of 16 to 18 years. The reliability and validity\nof the questionnaire was supported and it seems reasonable\nto justify the use of this instrument in future research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAjzen, I.
