Nilay Kafali, PhD; Zimin Liu, MA; Chang Shu, BS;\nMichael Flores, MPH\nIMPORTANCE Significant progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use\nin the United States. However, tobacco cessation efforts have focused on the general\npopulation rather than individuals with mental illness, who demonstrate greater rates of\ntobacco use and nicotine dependence.\nOBJECTIVES To assess whether declines in tobacco use have been realized among individuals\nwith mental illness and examine the association between mental health treatment and\nsmoking cessation.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Use of nationally representative surveys of\nnoninstitutionalized US residents to compare trends in smoking rates between adults with\nand without mental illness and across multiple disorders (2004-2011 Medical Expenditure\nPanel Survey [MEPS]) and to compare rates of smoking cessation among adults with mental\nillness who did and did not receive mental health treatment (2009-2011 National Survey of\nDrug Use and Health [NSDUH]).The MEPS sample included 32 156 respondents with mental\nillness (operationalized as reporting severe psychological distress, probable depression, or\nreceiving treatment for mental illness) and 133 113 without mental illness. The NSDUH sample\nincluded 14 057 lifetime smokers with mental illness.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Current smoking status (primary analysis; MEPS sample)\nand smoking cessation, operationalized as a lifetime smoker who did not smoke in the last 30\ndays (secondary analysis; NSDUH sample).\nRESULTS Adjusted smoking rates declined significantly among individuals without mental\n0.7%-3.9%) (P = .005).

This\nsuggests that tobacco control policies and cessation interventions targeting the general\npopulation have not worked as effectively for persons with mental illness.\nSupplemental content at\njama.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Harvard Medical\nSchool/Cambridge Health Alliance,\nDepartment of Psychiatry,\nCambridge, Massachusetts (Cook,\nWayne, Kafali); College of Economics\nand Management, Southwest\nUniversity, Chongqing, People's\nRepublic of China (Liu); Harvard\nSchool of Public Health, Department\nof Epidemiology, Boston,\nMassachusetts (Shu); Brown\nUniversity, Providence, Rhode Island\n(Flores).\nCorresponding Author: Benjamin\nL\u00ea Cook, PhD, MPH, Center for\nMulticultural Mental Health, 120\nBeacon St, Fourth Floor, Somerville,\nMA (bcook@cha.harvard.edu).\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n \nDownloaded From: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Analyses were con-\nducted using Stata release 12.0.16 The study was approved by\nthe Cambridge Health alliance institutional review board; the\nrequirement for informed consent was waived.\nOur dependent variable was current smoker status,\ndetermined by the response to the question \"Do you cur-\nrently smoke?\" We considered individuals to have a mental\nhealth disorder or substance use disorder (referred to herein\nas \"mental illness\") if (1) during the survey year they made\nan outpatient visit to a primary care professional or special-\nist, linked to the behavioral health International Classifica-\nprescription drug fill for a behavioral health disorder17; (2)\nthey scored more than 12 (possible scores, 0-24) on the\nKessler 6-Item Psychological Distress Scale (K-6), a criterion\npredictive of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (Fourth Edition) mental disorder and severe\nimpairment18; or (3) they scored more than 2 (possible\nscores, 0-6) on the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2)\ndepression symptom checklist, a sensitive (93%) and some-\nwhat specific (75%) indicator for any depressive disorder.19\nWe additionally measured smoking trends defining mental\nillness, using only criterion 1 and using only criteria 2 and 3.\nAdditionally, we assessed smoking rates among those receiv-\ning treatment for episodic mood disorder (ICD-9 code 296) or\nneurotic/anxiety disorders (ICD-9 code 300).\nTo address missing data in variables other than current\nsmoking in the MEPS (less than 1% missing on K-6, PHQ-2, and\nsocioeconomicstatusvariables),weimplementedmultipleim-\nputation methods using the mi procedure in Stata.

An individual was defined as a quitter\nor former smoker if he or she was a lifetime smoker and had\nillness was determined using a prediction formula developed\nby the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration31 to identify any mental illness; severity\n(mild, moderate, serious) of mental illness was determined\nby combining data from the K-6 and the World Health\nOrganization\u00adDisability Assessment Schedule impairment\nscale.

The mechanisms that support persistently\nhigher rates of smoking among individuals with mental ill-\nness are complex and remain understudied.32 Patients with\nmental illness may attribute greater benefits and reward value\nto smoking compared with patients without psychiatric\ndisorders33 or may experience more difficult life circum-\nstances, higher negative affect, or a relative lack of alterna-\ntive rewards.32,34 Identifying new interventions to address\nmechanisms specific to this population should be a priority for\ntobacco control policy.\nWe found higher rates of smoking among individuals with\npsychological distress or probable depression compared with\nthose receiving treatment for a mental health diagnosis. This\ndisparity may be explained, in part, by compositional differ-\nences between these groups. Compared with the group receiv-\ning treatment, the population screened as having psychologi-\ncal distress or probable depression was more likely to be\nunemployed men with lower income and education--all risk\nfactors for tobacco use.35\nMental illness not only is an independent risk factor for\nsmoking but is associated with a number of smoking-related\nrisk factors, including higher poverty, lower education, and\nlower employment (Table 1). Because of these associations,\nthe provision of care to an individual diagnosed with mental\nillness should be seen as an opportunity for smoking pre-\nvention or cessation treatment. For many individuals\nreceiving mental health treatment, interactions with mental\nhealth professionals (eg, psychologists, psychiatrists, men-\ntal health counselors) are their only access to preventive\nhealth counseling. Effective tobacco cessation treatments,12\ninterventions that integrate mental health and substance\nabuse treatment,13 and nicotine replacement therapies are\nnow readily available and can dovetail easily with psychoso-\ncial treatments and prescription of psychotropic medica-\ntions.\nOur supplementary analysis found that individuals receiv-\ning mental health treatment are not only less likely to smoke\nbut are more likely to quit, even after adjustment for mental\nhealth and sociodemographic factors.

First, our findings are\ning among the general population was relatively small, so that\ncould be incorporated into the analysis. It is possible that the\ndivergence in trends between individuals with and without\nmental illness is a recent phenomenon. Second, the MEPS does\nnotcontainstructureddiagnosticinstrumentstoidentifymen-\ntalillness.Usingavailablemeasures,weidentifieda15%preva-\nlenceofmentalillness,considerablylowerthanthe26%preva-\nlence of any 12-month Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders (Fourth Edition) disorder using structured di-\nthe K-6 and PHQ-2 criteria to determine mental illness raises\nthe possibility that mentally ill individuals with low levels of\ndistress and depressive symptoms may be underrepre-\nsented, and smoking rates for the mentally ill may thus be un-\nderestimated. Including individuals receiving any psycho-\ntherapy or with filled prescriptions for any psychotropic drug\nmay alternately miscategorize individuals with no or sub-\nthreshold mental health disorder. Significantly, the identi-\nfied trends were similar for both populations as well as within\nspecific disorders.\nThird, the MEPS excludes persons with mental illness who\nare institutionalized, potentially underestimating the overall\nprevalence of smoking in the US population. Fourth, the\nsupplementary NSDUH analysis does not allow for a causal de-\ntermination of whether smoking cessation was influenced by\nmental health treatment, and it is possible that respondents\nquit tobacco use before mental health treatment was initi-\nated. Interpretation of these findings should not rule out the\npossibility of reverse causality (individuals are more likely to\ninitiate mental health care after quitting) or the possibility that\nunobserved variables explain the strong relationship be-\ntween treatment and cessation.\nDespite these limitations, our findings provide evidence\nof diverging trends in smoking rates among individuals with\nand without mental illness, and the findings remain robust to\na number of different definitions of mental illness and among\nindividuals receiving treatment for neurotic/anxiety and epi-\nsodic mood disorders. Our analyses also identify that men-\ntally ill lifetime smokers receiving mental health treatment\nwere more likely to have quit smoking than their counter-\nparts not receiving treatment.\nConclusions\nviduals with mental illness was significantly less than among\nthose without mental illness, although quit rates were greater\namong those receiving mental health treatment. This sug-\ngests that tobacco control policies and cessation interven-\ntions targeting the general population have not worked as ef-\nfectively for those with mental illness.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Cook had full access to\nall of the data in the study and takes responsibility\nfor the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the\ndata analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Cook, Wayne, Liu, Flores.\nAcquisition of data: Cook.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Cook, Wayne,\nKafali, Liu, Shu.\nDrafting of the manuscript: All authors.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: Cook, Wayne, Kafali, Shu.\nStatistical analysis: Cook, Kafali, Liu, Shu.\nObtained funding: Cook.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Cook,\nKafali, Shu, Flores.\nStudy supervision: Cook.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have\ncompleted and submitted the ICMJE Form for\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and\nnone were reported.\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) grant\nand the William F.
