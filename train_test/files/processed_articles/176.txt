The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of sociodemographic, health behavior, chronic\ndisease, and impairment factors and their impact on difficulty in lower body function among two age-cohorts (51-61 and\n71-81 years) of Mexican Americans,  .\n1993 baseline Assets and Health Dynamics Study, respectively, were used to estimate prevalence. Multiple linear\nregression of the 4-item lower body difficulty scale (alpha = .80) was used to estimate the direct effects of the risk factors\nwithin the age-cohort and ethnicity groups.\nResults.. Overall, the risk factors are more prevalent among both minority groups and the older age-cohort. Lower body\ndeficits are particularly high among Mexican Americans and the younger age-cohort of African Americans. The impact of\nrisk factors does not vary much by ethnicity or age-cohort. Female gender, pain, arthritis, and heart and lung disease are\nthe major risk factors, and they account for about one-third of the variance in lower body difficulty for each group.\nConclusions. Efforts to prevent or reduce lower body difficulty should pay particular attention to pain, arthritis, and\nheart and lung disease. The central role of sociodemographic and behavioral factors in chronic disease argues for their\ncontinued inclusion in disability modeling and prevention.\nIMPROVING the health and functional status of minority\nracial and ethnic populations depends on the identification\nof modifiable risk factors and their prevalence, as well as a\ngreater understanding of the outcome-specific impacts of\nthese risk factors (1). For the two largest minority ethnic\npopulations, Mexican Americans and African Americans,\nthree conditions have constrained efforts to establish the\nprevalence and impact of such risk factors. First, datasets\nwith adequate samples of older African Americans and/or\nMexican Americans, and information on modifiable risk\nfactors (e.g., behaviors and diseases) and functional status,\nhave been relatively rare. Second, generalizations from the\nlimited data that do exist are tenuous because the prevalence\nand impact of risk factors within minority ethnic populations\nvary by age-cohort (1). And third, the majority of studies\nthat have addressed the prevalence or impact of risk factors\namong older African Americans or Mexican Americans\nhave been limited to ADL-based indicators of functional\nThis latter problem warrants further discussion because it\nhas broad implications for modeling functional status. Fig-\nure 1 shows a model of the relative location of ceiling effects\nfor self-report and performance-based measures of func-\ntional status. Although we have drawn upon recent theoreti-\ncal and empirical studies (7-11) in the development of this\nmodel, the location of ceiling effects for the various types of\nmeasures is speculative. For simplicity, consider functional\nstatus as a continuum ranging from poor to excellent. Basic\nactivities of daily living (ADL) measures, whether perfor-\nmance-based or self-report, only identify a small percentage\nof community-dwelling adults near the poor end of the\ncontinuum. For them the optimal time for the prevention of\noverall functional decline may have passed. By comparison,\ninstrumental ADL measures are capable of capturing per-\nsons who are farther removed from the poor end of the\ncontinuum, but still fall well short of being identified at the\nearly stages of the disability process. In contrast, lower body\nmeasures are capable of capturing functional difficulty well\nprior to ADL disability (7,12). Because performance-based\nassessments of lower body function (i.e., strength, stamina,\nand balance) are relatively more precise than performance-\nbased assessments of ADLs or IADLS, the distance on the\ncontinuum between lower body self-report and perfor-\nmance-based assessments is greater than that between ADL\nor IADL self-report and performance-based assessments.\nImportantly, self-reports of lower body function are highly\ncorrelated with performance-based assessments (13), and\nlower body function is possibly the most influential dimen-\nIn the following sections we estimate and compare the\nprevalence of risk factors for lower body difficulty among\none sample of Mexican Americans (n = 506), African\nand another sample of Mexican Americans (n = 140),\nSelf-Report\nADL IADL Lower Body\nPoor --\nFunctional\nStatus\nADL IADL Lower Body\n\u00b7 Excellent\nFunctional\nStatus\nPerformance-Based\nFigure 1.

The data for the younger age-cohort are from the\n1992 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) baseline inter-\nviews, and the data for the older age-cohort are from the\n1993 Asset and Health Dynamics Study (AHEAD) baseline\ninterviews. In addition to comparing the prevalence of so-\nciodemographic, health behavior, chronic disease, and\nphysical and cognitive impairment risk factors, the associa-\ntions of these factors with self-reported difficulty in lower\nbody functional status are compared across the age-cohort\nand ethnic groups.\nMETHODS\nData. -- The 1992 HRS and the AHEAD were conducted\nby the Institute for Survey Research (ISR) at the University\nof Michigan for the National Institute on Aging. Seventy\nthousand households obtained through an area probability\nsample were screened for age-eligible persons (51 to 61\nyears old for the HRS, and 70 years or older for the\nAHEAD). All age-eligible persons residing in the household\nwere selected for the HRS. In the AHEAD, if more than one\nage-eligible individual was residing in the household, one\nindividual was randomly selected. In both the HRS and the\nAHEAD, spouses were interviewed regardless of age.\nCensus tracts containing a high density of African Ameri-\ncans or Mexican Americans were oversampled 2:1 in the\nHRS and 1.8:1 in the AHEAD. All households within the\nhigh-density census tracts that were identified as having an\nage-eligible respondent were selected, except in the HRS,\nwhere only households with an age-eligible Mexican Ameri-\ncan resident were selected from the high-density Mexican\nAmerican census tracts. Finally, one-half of the AHEAD\nrespondents who were aged 80 years and older were iden-\ntified using the Master Enrollment File maintained by the\nHealth Care Financing Administration.\nResponse rates were approximately 80% for the AHEAD\nand 82% for the HRS. Interviews lasted an average of one\nhour per respondent. Our analyses were restricted to self-\nrespondents because of the subjective nature of many of the\nmeasures. The overall proxy response rates were 5% in the\nHRS and 10% in the AHEAD. Mean lower body scores (see\nbelow) did not differ for self- and proxy respondents in the\ndents, respectively, in the AHEAD. A previous report\nshowed that analyses restricted to Mexican American, Afri-\ncan American, and White self-respondents in the AHEAD\nwere not biased from those including proxy respondents\nthe AHEAD.\nMeasures. -- Our selection of independent variables was\nguided in part by recent conceptual models of disability\ngraphic characteristics affect the practice of health behav-\niors, the prevalence of chronic disease and physical and\ncognitive impairments, and, finally, difficulty in lower body\nfunction. The practice of health behaviors affects the preva-\nlence of chronic disease, impairment, and lower body dif-\nficulty. Chronic disease affects impairments and lower body\nfunction, and, finally, impairments affect lower body func-\ntion. Factors that are hypothesized to have an association\nwith lower body function in these conceptual models, or that\nhave been shown in existing empirical reports to have an\nassociation, and that were available in both the HRS and\nAHEAD, were included as independent variables in the\nanalyses. Additionally, sociodemographic factors that differ\nmarkedly across age-cohort or ethnicity groups (e.g., region\nof residence and marital status) were included as indepen-\ndent variables in the analyses.\nFollowing the causal sequence of the model, measures of\nsociodemographic characteristics are presented and dis-\ncussed first, followed by health behaviors, chronic disease,\nphysical and cognitive impairments, and lower body func-\ntion. Many of the coding schemes are evident in Table 1 and\nare not detailed here. The sociodemographic measures in-\nclude age, gender, Southern geographic residence, propor-\ntion of life spent in the U.S., language of interview, marital\nstatus, working status over the past two years, education,\nhousehold income, and net worth. With the use of bracketing\ntechniques, income and net worth data were ascertained for\napproximately 80 to 85% in both surveys. ISR-imputed\nvalues were used for missing income and net worth data.\nBecause income and net worth were dichotomized at\n$10,000 or less for this article (representing the approximate\nyearly earnings from one full-time, minimum wage job), the\nimplications of imputation are minimized.\nHealth behaviors are reflected by sets of dummy variables\nfor the percent of ideal body mass (underweight [90% or\nless], normal, and obese [140% or more]), smoking status\n(current, former, or never), and a dichotomous indicator for\none or more alcoholic drinks per day. Markers for high blood\npressure, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart problems, and\nstroke were based on positive responses to the question,\n\"Has a doctor ever told you that you have/had . . . ?\"\nIndications of arthritis or rheumatism were based on positive\nresponses to the question, \"During the last 12 months, have\nyou seen a doctor specifically for arthritis or rheumatism?\"\nPsychiatric problems were based on positive responses to the\nquestion,' 'Have you had any emotional, nervous, or psychi-\natric problems over the past 12 months?\" Diabetes or high\nblood sugar was captured by positive responses to the ques-\ntion, \"Do you have diabetes now?\" Because these disease\nindicators rely on health care provider contact, they are\ngenerally specific, but not sensitive.\nPhysical and cognitive impairments are measured several\nways. Vision and hearing are self-rated with the use of\nglasses, contacts, or hearing aids, with responses dichoto-\nmized to fair/poor vs all other. Self-reported memory is\nsimilarly coded. Immediate word recall score (percent cor-\nrect out of 10 [AHEAD] or 20 [HRS]) provides a more\nobjective test of memory. Pain was captured through posi-\ntive responses to the question, \"Are you often troubled with\npain?\" Experimental studies demonstrate that such self-\nreports of pain are reliable (16).\nThe dependent variable, lower body difficulty, is the sum\nof scores from four items: walking several blocks, climbing\none flight of stairs, pulling or pushing heavy objects, and\ncarrying 10 pounds. These items have been shown to form a\nunidimensional scale that has racially and ethnically invari-\nant measurement properties in the AHEAD (12), the Longi-\ntudinal Study of Aging (17), and the National Long-Term\nCare Survey (18). The stem for these items in the HRS is\n\"How difficult is it for you to . . . ?\" Responses of a little,\nsome, or a lot of difficulty, or that the respondent couldn't or\ndoesn't do any particular item were coded one, with all other\nresponses coded zero. The stem for these items in the\nAHEAD is, \"Do you have any difficulty . . . ?\" Responses\nof yes, don't do, and can't do were coded one. Cronbach's\nalpha for the scale ranged from .79 to .83 for each of the\nethnic by age-cohort groups.\nAnalyses. -- Sociodemographic characteristics are pre-\nsented first, followed by the prevalence of health behaviors,\nchronic disease, physical and cognitive impairments, and\nlower body difficulty among Mexican Americans, African\nAmericans, and Whites for each age cohort. The results of\nmultiple linear regression of the sociodemographic charac-\nteristics, health behaviors, chronic disease, and physical and\ncognitive impairments on lower body function are then\nreported for each age-cohort by ethnic group. Statistically\nsignificant differences between the partial regression coef-\nficients of the age-cohort by ethnicity groups are determined\nusing /-tests. Standard errors for the compared coefficients\nare pooled and weighted by sample size (19). To adjust for\nmultiple hypothesis testing and to focus on substantive\nsignificance, only statistically significant differences where\nthe confidence intervals of the two coefficients do not over-\nlap are discussed.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the prevalence of risk factors for each\nage-cohort by ethnicity group, with statistically significant\ndifferences identified in the three right-hand columns. The\nethnic comparisons within the younger age-cohort are con-\nsidered first, followed by the ethnic comparisons within the\nolder age cohort, concluding with the age-cohort compari-\nsons within each ethnic group.\nEthnicity differences within the 51- to 61-year-old age-\ncohort. -- In the younger cohort, African Americans were\nnearly twice as likely as Mexican Americans or Whites to\nhave been widowed or divorced. Low income and net worth\nwere approximately three times more prevalent among Afri-\ncan and Mexican Americans compared to Whites. Educa-\ntional attainment and having private health insurance were\nhighest for Whites and lowest for Mexican Americans.\nAfrican Americans were most likely to be current smokers,\nbut Whites were more likely to be former smokers. Mexican\nand African Americans were substantially more likely to be\nobese than Whites.\nSignificant differences in the prevalence of most diseases\nwere apparent. African Americans report the highest preva-\nlence of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis,\nbut Whites report having more cancer and chronic lung\ndisease. With the possible exception of diabetes, the preva-\nlence of chronic disease does not appear high for Mexican\nAmericans relative to Whites. Nonetheless, Mexican Ameri-\ncans report impairments (e.g., having fair or poor eyesight,\nTable 1.

Mexican and African Americans have poorer imme-\ndiate word recall and lower body function scores than\nWhites.\nEthnicity differences within the 71- to 81-year-old age-\ncohort. -- Similar ethnic differences were found in the older\nage-cohort. African Americans experienced widowhood the\nmost, but were only more likely than Whites to have experi-\nenced divorce. Mexican Americans were three times more\nlikely than Whites to have low income and net worth, while\nAfrican Americans were more than twice as likely as Whites\nto have low income or net worth. Mexican Americans had the\nlowest educational attainment, and Whites had the highest.\nBeing on Medicaid was much more common among Mexican\nand African Americans than among Whites. The reverse was\ntrue for having private insurance. Whites were least likely to\nbe obese, and most likely to be underweight. Whites were also\nmost likely to have one or more drinks per day.\nWith regard to disease and impairment, Whites were least\nlikely to report having diabetes or arthritis, but most likely to\nreport having cancer. African Americans were most likely to\nreport having high blood pressure, while Mexican Americans\nwere most likely to report having had emotional, nervous, or\npsychiatric problems. Reports of having fair or poor eyesight,\nhearing, and memory, and trouble with pain, were more\ncommon among Mexican Americans than Whites, and, with\nthe exception of eyesight, than African Americans as well.\nWhites reported better perceived eyesight and memory, and\nimmediate word recall than either Mexican or African Ameri-\ncans. Whites also reported better lower body function, while\nMexican Americans reported the worst.\nAge-cohorts within ethnicity. -- Widowhood rates were\nhigher among the older age-cohort, but divorce rates were\nlower. Labor force participation was also lower among the\nolder age-cohort. The older age-cohort had at least twice the\nrate of low income, and the same or lower rate of low net\nworth. Educational attainment was also lower within the\nolder age-cohort, and the percent on Medicaid was substan-\ntially greater.\nObesity was considerably less frequent in the older age-\ncohort for African Americans and Whites, and the rate of\ncurrent smoking and alcohol use was less frequent in the\nolder age-cohort for all three ethnic groups. Excluding\npsychological problems and arthritis, diseases were gener-\nally more prevalent within the older age-cohorts. With the\nexception of pain, all impairments were more common in the\nolder age-cohort of each ethnic group. Lower body function\nis worse in the older age-cohort for Mexican Americans and\nWhites, but not African Americans.\nTable 2 presents the results of the multivariable linear\nregression of the lower body difficulty scores for each age-\ncohort by ethnic group.

The Mexican American model can not\nbe directly compared to the African American or White\nmodels because the relatively small sample size among the\nolder Mexican American age-cohort posed a degrees of\nfreedom constraint. This was resolved by first estimating\nstep-wise regression models for Mexican Americans, and\nincluding in the final common Mexican American model any\nrisk factors significant for either Mexican American age-\ncohort.\nRegression analysis among Mexican Americans. -- Being\nfemale, on Medicaid, and often troubled with pain are\npositively associated with lower body difficulty in both\nMexican American age-cohorts. For the older age-cohort,\nthe only additional significant risk factor was having been\ninterviewed in Spanish. For the younger age-cohort, being\nwidowed or divorced, having lung disease, heart disease,\narthritis, and reporting fair or poor eyesight and memory are\nalso positively associated with lower body difficulty. Al-\nthough some of the parameter estimates for the Mexican\nAmerican age-cohorts are statistically significantly differ-\nent, all of their confidence intervals overlap (i.e., meet our\nconservative test of equivalence).\nRegression analysis among African Americans. -- It is\napparent that being female, having low income, being on\nMedicaid, having diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis,\ntrouble with pain, and fair or poor self-rated memory are all\npositively associated with lower body difficulty for both\nAfrican American age-cohorts. No additional effects are\nsignificant in the older age-cohort. For the younger age-\ncohort, however, current smoking, lung disease, psycholog-\nical problems, and fair or poor eyesight are also positively\nassociated with lower body difficulty. Again, although some\nof the parameter estimates for the African American age-\ncohorts are statistically significantly different, all of their\nconfidence intervals overlap.\nRegression analysis among Whites. -- Numerous signi-\nficant associations emerge because of the large sample sizes\nof Whites. Therefore, we restrict the discussion to associa-\ntions that are significant at the .01 level or beyond, and\nwhere confidence intervals do not overlap. Greater age,\nbeing female, having low net worth, obesity, currently\nsmoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, lung dis-\nease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, fair or poor eyesight,\ntrouble with pain, and fair or poor perceived memory were\nall positively associated with lower body difficulty in both\nage-cohorts. For the older age-cohort, the only additional\nassociations (inverse) involved having worked in the past 2\nyears and immediate word recall score. For the younger age-\ncohort, additional positive associations involved low in-\ncome, being on Medicaid, and having psychological prob-\nlems, while having private insurance was negatively\nassociated with lower body difficulty. The confidence inter-\nvals for the parameter estimates for working, private health\ninsurance, arthritis, and trouble with pain do not overlap.\nPrivate health insurance and pain had stronger associations\nfor the younger age-cohort, while working in the past 2 years\nand having arthritis had stronger associations for the older\nage-cohort.\nAfrican American vs White comparisons. -- All of the\nconfidence intervals for the parameter estimates overlap in\nthe younger age-cohort. For the older age-cohort, even\nthough immediate word recall was not significant among\nAfrican Americans, the negative association of immediate\nword recall with lower body difficulty was sufficiently\nstrong among Whites that the confidence intervals did not\noverlap.\nDISCUSSION\nBefore a general discussion of the findings, it is necessary\nto highlight a couple of limitations to the data and analyses\nreported here. First, because several of the independent\nvariables used in these analyses are not available for respon-\ndents who required a proxy, it is not possible to demonstrate\nthat the type and impact of risk factors is consistent for self-\nand proxy respondents. Thus, our findings apply only to\nself-respondents. Second, although the few existing assess-\nments of the validity of self-reports of disease have not found\nracial differences (20,21), the majority of the HRS and\nAHEAD questions about disease rely on a doctor having told\nthe respondent that he or she has the disease. Thus, the\nprevalence of chronic disease may be underestimated among\nthe younger age-cohort of Mexican and African Americans\nwho have lower rates of insurance coverage. The relatively\nhigh proportion of Mexican and African American respon-\ndents with less than $10,000 in income suggests that, in the\nabsence of insurance, access would be anything but routine.\nMoreover, for Mexican Americans, chronic disease may be\nunderreported due to the prevalence of monolingual immi-\ngrants (46% and 74% in the younger and older age-cohorts,\nrespectively). The Spanish translation of the protocol is\naccurate, but it does not address the problem that when\nmonolingual adults visit a physician, a third party is gener-\nally necessary for translation. The substantial import of the\nSpanish-interview indicator for lower body difficulty scores\nin the older age-cohort of Mexican Americans is suggestive\nof reporting differences, but could also represent unmea-\nsured cultural factors (e.g., diet). A similar association\nbetween language of interview and health has recently been\nreported among Mexican American children (22).\nConsistent with other reports (1), functional status does not\nvary much by age-cohort among African Americans. This is\nnot true for Whites or Mexican Americans, where the older\nage-cohort has substantially poorer functional status. We also\nfound considerable racial and age-cohort differences in the\nprevalence of sociodemographic, behavioral, chronic disease,\nand impairment risk factors for lower body difficulty. How-\never, few substantial age-cohort or ethnicity differences in the\nrisk factor estimates were found. Indeed, of 136 pairs of\nregression coefficients, the confidence intervals of all but five\noverlapped. Four of those that did not overlap involved\nWhites, where the sample sizes were very large. Therefore,\nage-cohort and ethnicity differences in lower body function do\nnot appear to result from differences in either the type or\nimpact of risk factors. Whether the differential prevalence of\nrisk factors accounts for ethnicity differences in lower body\nfunction is an important issue, but one that we have not\nspecifically addressed here. Previous reports have indicated\nthat a majority of the African American disadvantage in\ndisability can generally be accounted for by differences in the\nprevalence of poverty and low education (23). In pooled,\nhierarchical analyses not shown, we also found that lower\nrates of family income, net worth, and years of education\naccounted for the majority of Mexican and African American\ndisadvantages in lower body function.\nStandardized regression coefficients (not shown) indicate\nthat the risk factors with the strongest and most consistent\nassociations with lower body function across the age-cohort\nand ethnicity groups are: being female; having arthritis,\nheart disease, or lung disease; and being bothered by pain.\nPrevious studies have also found these five variables to be\namong the central risk factors of lower body disability\n(8,24-26). In analyses not shown, these five variables ac-\ncounted for at least three-fourths of the variance explained\nby the lower body function models of Table 2, with pain\nhaving the greatest effect. Both arthritis and pain are com-\nmon complaints among all age-cohort and ethnicity groups\n(see Table 1), but are particularly common among Mexican\nand African Americans, who have substantially lower levels\nof educational attainment. Ironically, the vast majority of\nextant research on the management of arthritic mechanics\nand pain has been carried out on well-educated Whites (27).\nThus, arthritis self-help materials and classes (28) have been\ngeared to the least needy population: well-educated Whites.\nAccordingly, a thorough review of cultural and educational\ndifferences and their implications for the treatment and\nmanagement of arthritic mechanics and pain is warranted.\nThe fact that medical conditions and pain have the largest\nassociation with lower body disability should not detract\nfrom interest in the social and behavioral factors that precede\nmedical conditions and impairment in conceptual models of\ndisability. While the sociodemographic and behavioral risk\nfactors do not appear to have substantial proximal effects on\ndisability, their proximal effects on chronic disease are well\nestablished (29). Regular physical activity, for example, has\nbeen shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease\nwithin one year of adoption (30), and has been shown to be\nan effective approach to maintaining joint function and\nmanaging pain among arthritic older adults (26). With re-\ndisease, smoking cessation also represents an indirect path to\nthe prevention of lower body difficulty. Because risk-\nreduction is closely associated with total years smoked and\nyears since quitting, this may be a more powerful prevention\ntool in younger age-cohorts (31). Chronic disease and dis-\nability prevention will require a focus on not just behavioral\nfactors, but behavioral factors in social and cultural contexts\n(32). Thus, the continued inclusion of sociodemographic\nand behavioral risk factors in empirical and certainly con-\nceptual models of disability is not only appropriate, but\ncritical to disability prevention.\n"
