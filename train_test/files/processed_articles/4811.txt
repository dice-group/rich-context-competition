A\nstrong consciousness for the need of free and compulsory Primary Education in India was highly moved by enactment of the\nCompulsory Education Act in 1870 in England. Education has been formally recognized as a human right since the adoption\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948. This has since then been reaffirmed in numerous global\nhuman rights treaties. Ultimately, universalization of elementary education has been one of the most important goals of\neducational development in India since independence.

This article attempts to delve into the checkered history of\ndevelopment of the free and compulsory primary education in India under the British Raj. The history of compulsory and\nfree primary education during the British Rule in India is an uphill journey replete with suggestions, advocacies, demands,\nexperimentations, attempts, promises, and movements within legislative framework. The British rulers adopted a good\nnumber of policies on education, but these were framed in tune with the needs of the colonial power. Consequently,\ncompulsory and free primary education remained an unfulfilled dream during the British Raj, in spite of the stirring efforts\nof the Indians.\n",

The English East India Company ultimately\nestablished their rule in India. Although this Company came\nto India as traders, they shifted their vision from economics\nto administrative control of India with the rise of Robert\nClive and his victory at the Battle of Plassey2 in 1757\n(Riddick, 2006). Later, they had become rulers and adminis-\ntrators and policy makers in the landscape of economy, pol-\nity, and education in India. However, one should not suppose\nthat there had been no educational system before the coming\nof the East India Company. When the British came to India\nand were gradually establishing themselves in Bengal, they\nmet such a system (Ghosh, 1989). Education is no exotic in\nIndia.

Before the British developed a new\nscheme of education in India, both the Hindus and the\nMuslims had their own systems of education. Both the sys-\ntems went into oblivion gradually and suffered a setback\nbecause of political turmoil and lack of a strong centralized\npolitical authority and want of suitable patronage (Purkait,\n1992). The Tols and Madrassas were the highest seminaries\nof learning meant for the specialists.

(p. 3)\nLet us now see how the checkered history of the free and com-\npulsory primary education in India under the British Raj5 was.\nMethodology of the Study\nThe study being historical in nature involves documentary\nanalysis. The study has been developed by exploring and\nanalyzing comprehensively huge qualitative data obtained\nfrom both primary and secondary sources.\nParliamentary Recognition of the Right\nof Education in India\nAlthough the East India Company was established as early as\nyears of its existence (Nurullah & Naik, 1951). For the first\ntime, the Company paid attention to educational matters by\nthe Charter Act of 1698, which mandated it to maintain\npriests and schools in its garrisons. However, these provi-\nsions were intended for the children of the Company's\nEuropean servants than for the Indians. The development of\nmodern system of education in India under the aegis of the\nCompany began actually with the CharterAct of 1813, which\ndirected through the Section 43 that\na sum of not less than one lakh of rupees in each year shall be set\napart and applied to the revival and improvement of literature\nand the encouragement of the learned natives of India, and for\nthe introduction and promotion of a knowledge of the sciences\namong the inhabitants of the British territories in India. (Sharp,\nNurullah and Naik (1951) rightly stated that\n. . . the education of the Indian people was definitely included\nwithin the duties of the Company; . . . thereby laying the\nfoundation of the modern educational system. (p. 82)\ntance when one remembers that in those days education\nwas not a state's responsibility in England, and except\nScotland, no public money was spent on elementary educa-\nlegislative admission of the right of education in India in\nthe public revenues (Misra, 1989). However, the Charter\nAct made it compulsory on the part of the East India\nCompany to extend education in India; it laid the base of\nstate system of education in India.\nThe Earliest Suggestion\nThe history of universal compulsory primary education\ncan be traced back to the year, 1938. Although no solid\nefforts were made till the beginning of the 20th century, the\nearliest attempt during British rule for enforcing compul-\nsory primary education was undertaken by William Adam\ninquired into the state of vernacular education in Bengal,\nBihar, and Orissa. In the third Report, Adam submitted his\nscheme for the improvement of vernacular education.\nAdam considered it impossible to introduce compulsory\neducation at that time for more than one reason. He stated\nit in his report in the following words:\nThe next form in which Government influence may be conceived\nto be employed for the promotion of education is by making it\ncompulsory and enacting that every village should have a\nschool. I hope the time will come when every village shall have\na school, but the period has not yet arrived when this obligation\nThe General Committee of Public Instruction (GCPI) found\nAdam's scheme impractical and too expensive and above all\nopposed to the idea of filtrating education from the upper and\nmiddle classes to the masses and, ultimately, the government\nrejected the proposal.\nCaptain Wingate, the Revenue Survey\nProposal\nA more direct suggestion toward the demand of compul-\nsory education came from Captain Wingate, the Revenue\nSurvey Commissioner in Bombay. In 1852, Captain\nWingate when called upon by Government of Bombay to\ngive his views on a proposal to levy a local fund on land\nrevenue, recommended the levy of such cess and sug-\ngested that a part of it should be devoted to providing\ncompulsory education to the sons of agriculturists. These\nproposals did not find favor with other officers most of\nwhom opposed it tooth and nail (Aggarwal, 2002; Pathania\n& Pathania, 2006). Professor J. P. Naik opined that the\nmain flaw in the proposal is its uncritical optimism. It was\nobviously impossible to finance compulsory primary edu-\ncation out of the proceeds of the Local Fund Cess only\nMr. T. C. Hope, Educational Inspector\nRecommendation\nShortly afterward in 1858, Mr. T. C. Hope, the educational\ninspector of Gujarat proposed that a law should be passed\nempowering the inhabitants of any local area to tax them-\nselves for the establishment of schools (Mukerji, 1964). Mr.\nT. C. Hope opposed the voluntary system of school expan-\nsion and pressed for an enactment to authorize the levy of a\ncompulsory educational rate (Government of Bombay,\n1859). The Report of the Director of Public Instruction,\nMr. T. C. Hope about the state of education during 1857 to\nthat the \"partially self-supporting\" or persuading system, as a\nmeasure for national education, has proved a total failure . . . the\nbest substitute appears to be a legislative enactment, to be ready\napplied, from year to year, to such villages as are judged to be\nready for Government schools, and throwing the entire cost of\nthe maintenance of the latter on the people themselves.\nBut this proposal was also turned down as premature. Thus,\nearlier suggestions or schemes for introducing compulsory\nprimary education under the British Raj came from William\nAdam, Captain Wingate, and T. C. Hope. But all the sugges-\ntions were considered either premature or impractical.\nIndian Education Commission (Hunter\nDemand\nWith the enforcement of Compulsory Education Act in\nEngland in 1870, a demand was raised in India to provide\nsimilar facilities in its colonies (Juneja, 2003).\nConsequently, a vigorous demand for laws to be made to\nmake 4 years of primary education compulsory was made\nby Dadabhai Naoroji and Jyotiba Phule from Bombay\nPresidency in their evidences before the Indian Education\nCommission, 1882, which agreed to their reason for claim\nand stated that\nwhile every branch of education can justly claim the fostering\ncare of the state, it is desirable, in the present circumstances to\ndeclare the elementary, education of the masses, its provision,\nextension and improvement, to be that part of the educational\nsystem to which the strenuous efforts of the State should now be\ndirected. (Hunter Commission, p. 586)\nDadabhai Naoroji in his evidence before the Hunter\nCommission put forward the demand that 4 years of compul-\nsory education should be provided to all children (UNESCO,\n1984). Jotirao also pointed out in his representation to the\nEducation Commission,\nThere is little doubt that primary education among the masses in\nthis Presidency has been very much neglected . . . Government\ncollect a special cess for educational purpose, and it is to be\nregretted that this fund is not spent for the purposes for which it\nis collected . . . I think primary education of the masses should\nbe made compulsory up to a certain age, say at least 12 years.\nIn the big volume of its report, which runs well over 739\npages, there is no mention of compulsory education at all.\nThe principle of compulsion is referred to only in page num-\nber 558, where the Commission observes, \"One witness\nadvocates compulsory primary education for the city of\nmended that the management of primary schools was to be\nentrusted to the newly established local self-government\nboards. Lord Ripon was satisfied with the very recommenda-\ntion of the Commission. State's financial allocation for mak-\ning primary education universal was reduced and even\ngradually withdrawn under this policy of local self-govern-\nment introduced in India by Lord Ripon. But newly estab-\nlished local and municipal boards had little resources to take\nup this burden. Ultimately, we observed that\n. . . the Commission did not recommend making elementary\neducation compulsory, nor did they recommend making free. But\nthey asked the local authorities to admit ascertain portion of pupils\nas free students on the ground of poverty in all schools managed\nEstablishment of Indian National\nMovement\nThe report of the Indian Education Commission paved the\nway for the organized agitation for the introduction of com-\npulsory education. Since 1880, a number of Indian leaders\nbegan stressing the need of education for all. The establish-\nment of the Indian National Congress in 1885 further\nstrengthened the movement (Mukerji, 1964). In the Calcutta\nCongress of 1906, it was declared that it is the birthright of\nthe people of India to get proper education. The Resolutions\nadopted by the 22nd Indian National Congress, held at\nout that \"Government should take immediate steps for (i)\nmaking primary education free and gradually compulsory all\nover the country\" (Report of the Twenty-Second Indian\nNational Congress, 1907, p. iii). The movement thus initiated\nAttempts of Sir Sahaji Rao Gaikwad of\nBaroda--The First Experimentation\nUltimately, credit goes to the notable Indian prince Sir Sahaji\nRao Gaikwad of Baroda. He achieved what the British\n4 SAGE Open\nGovernment found impossible. That is why Gopal Krishna\nGokhale pointed out at the time of introducing the Bill on\nWithin the borders of India itself, the Maharaja of Baroda has set\nan event of enthusiasm in the cause of education . . . His highness\nbegan his first experiment in the matter of introducing\ncompulsory and free education into his State eighteen years ago\nin ten villages at the Amreli Taluka. After watching the\nexperiment for eight years, it was extended to the whole taluka\ncompulsory and free throughout the State for boys between the\nages of 6 and 12, and for girls between the ages of 6 and 10.\nFor his greatest and remarkable contribution to the cause of\ncompulsory education, he was often regarded as the \"Prince\namong the Educators and an Educator among the princes.\"\nThe first organized attempt to introduce compulsory primary\neducation in British India was, however, made in Bombay\nunder Sir Ibrahim Rahimtoola and Sir Chimanlal Setalwad.\nAs a result of their agitation, the Government of Bombay\nappointed a Committee in 1906 to examine the feasibility of\nintroducing compulsory education in the city of Bombay.\nBut unfortunately, this committee came to the conclusion\nthat the time was not ripe for the introduction of compulsory\nAttempts of Gopal Krishna Gokhale\nLegislative Framework\nDuring the days of Swadeshi Movement,7 an extensive agita-\ntion was launched for spreading education among the masses.\nOn the contrary, a new political awakening emerged and it\nstrongly had drawn the attention of the country to the needs\nof mass education. Even after 150 years of British Raj, only\nabout 6% of the people had reached the level of literacy. This\nproduced a surge of criticism from all corners against the\nexisting system of education. Such criticisms found expres-\nsion in a constructive manner in the attempts of the late\nGopal Krishna Gokhale to force the government of the coun-\ntry to accept the principle of compulsory and free primary\neducation (Basu, 1992). The first definite and vocal demand\nfor the introduction of compulsory primary education was\nmade by Shri Gopal Krishna Gokhale, the veteran Indian\nnationalist leader (Mukerji, 1964). He was also an active\nmember of the Indian National Congress and he became a\nnonofficial member representing the Bombay Presidency in\nthe British Imperial Legislative Council8 in 1902. He made\nvaliant efforts to make the government accept the necessity\nof compulsory primary education. The attempt of Maharaja\nSayaji Rao Gaikwad of Baroda inspired Mr. Gokhale. On\nImperial Legislative Council, recommended that\na beginning be made in the direction of making elementary\neducation free and compulsory throughout the country, and that\na mixed commission of officials and non-officials be appointed\nGokhale submitted nine practical proposals to the consider-\nation of this Council. He proposed\nThat following the example of the Act of 1870, we should pass\nan Act conferring powers upon local bodies to make elementary\neducation compulsory in their areas.\nthat compulsion should be only for boys and not for girls.\nthat the period of compulsion should be between 6 years and 10\nyears,\nIn any area where 33 per cent of the male population is already\nat school, there this principle of compulsion should be applied.\nthat wherever compulsory education is introduced, it should be\ngratuitous,\nthat the extra cost should be divided between the Government\nand the local bodies in the proportion of 2 to 1.\nthat there should now be a separate Secretary for Education in\nthe Home Department . . . a Member in separate charge of\neducation will be included in the Executive Council.\nthat education should now be a divided head instead of its being\na purely Provincial head . . . Education should therefore be a\ndivided charge and there should be a definite programme before\nthe Government, just as there is a programme for railways,\nwhich should be carried out steadily year by year.\nthat a statement describing the progress of education from year\nto year should be published with the annual Financial Statement.\nThe resolution was withdrawn on an assurance from the gov-\nernment that the whole problem would receive official atten-\ntion. Although the government rejected most of the proposals\nof Mr. Gokhale, in the same year (1910) the Government of\nIndia created a separate Department of Education in charge of\na Member of the Executive Council and asked it to devise\nschemes for the extension of primary education (Sen, 1941).\nThegovernment,however,sooncreatedaseparateDepartment\nof Education and began to publish annual reviews of educa-\ntional progress, but they ignored the principal part of the reso-\nlution on the ground that education was wholly the purview\nof the provincial governments (Kamat, 1970). Meanwhile, his\nplea for the introduction compulsory education drew wide\npublic attention.Almost single-handedly, he had succeeded in\nmaking elementary education in India a live issue (Dasgupta,\n1993). However, by introduction of this resolution, Gokhale\nsucceeded in putting the case for compulsory education on\nthe national agenda. If Gopal Krishna Gokhale would have\nbeen alive today, he would have been the happiest person to\nsee his dream of \"Right to Education\" for the children of the\ncountry come true. It was he who, a 100 years ago, urged the\nImperial Legislative Assembly confer such a right on Indian\nchildren. That goal has been realized a century later\nintroduced in the same Council a small private bill \"to make\nbetter provision for the extension of elementary education in\nintroductory speech, he pointed out all facts and figures\nabout other countries for comparison and made out a cogent\ncase for what he called a \"cautious measure.\" He made a\ntouching appeal to the officialdom,\nMy Lord, if the history of elementary education throughout the\nworld establishes one fact more clearly than another, it is this,\nthat without a resort to compulsion no State can ensure a general\nMr. Gokhale also spoke that\nnone is greater than this task of promoting the universal diffusion\nof education in the land, bringing by its means a ray of light, a\ntouch of refinement, a glow of hope into lives that sadly need\nThe bill had been drafted more or less on lines put forward\nby him in the preceding year, at the time of the debate on his\nresolution (Sen, 1941). The demands made in the bill were,\nhowever, more modest enough and humble than the resolu-\ntions placed before. The Act was to be in the nature of a per-\nmissive legislation. Mr. Gokhale attached the greatest\nimportance to the bill was that relating to \"the gradual intro-\nduction of the principle of compulsion into the system of\nelementary education in the country\" (Natesan, 1920, p.\ndemanded stating that\na local body might, with the previous sanction of the Provincial\nGovernment, make primary education compulsory in its area\nprovided that thirty-three per cent of boys and girls in that area\nwere already under instruction (showing thereby that there was\nsufficient demand for primary education).\nEven then compulsion would be only for boys between the ages\nof six and ten, and girls were not to be included at all.\nAnd the expenses were to be shared by the local bodies and\nthe Provincial Governments in the ratio of one to two.\nThe bill was framed on the model of Compulsory Education\nreferred to a Select Committee of 15 members of the Council\nfor detailed examination of the clauses. This time he also\nurged that where education was to be made compulsory, it\nshould be free (Sen, 1941). He emphatically urged that \". . .\nunless there was an Act to this effect, the local bodies would\nbe powerless to introduce compulsory education\" (Siqueira,\nbreak through the government opposition. All the govern-\nment members as well as some nonofficial members voted\nagainst the bill and it was thrown out, 38 members voting\nwas not prepared to accept even these modest proposals and,\nby virtue of their statutory brute majority, the fate of the bill\nwas of course sealed (Kamat, 1970). The bill was rejected on\nthe ground that it was unnecessary, premature, unworkable,\nand so on. While rejecting Gokhale's Bill, however, the\nGovernment of India promised more grants to local bodies\nfor the encouragement of primary education and urged the\nprovincial government to pay more attention to this subject.\nMost of the educated people in India began to realize the\nnecessity of free and compulsory education . . . the move-\nment for elementary education advanced rapidly in the coun-\ntry. In newly created N.W.

I make no complaint. I shall not even feel depressed . . .\nWe, of the present generation of India can only hope to serve our\ncountry by our failures. The men and women who will be\nprivileged to serve her by their successes, will come later.\nThus, a glorious chapter in the history of the fight for com-\npulsory primary education in India under the British rule\nended. However, Gokhale failed; but he failed gloriously.\nHe, though defeated, fought heroically for several years.\nAfter all, it was really a heroic failure.\nCommitments and Promises\nAlthough Mr. Gokhale's attempts on 3 successive years to\ncompel the government to pass an education bill had failed,\nthe possibility of extension of the primary education in India\ngained a momentum when His Most Gracious Imperial\nMajesty the King Emperor, George V, in replying to the\naddress of the Calcutta University during his visit to India,\nIt is my wish that there may be spread over the land a network of\nschools and colleges, from which will go forth loyal and manly\n6 SAGE Open\nand useful citizens, able to hold their own in industries and\nagriculture and all the vocations in life.

It is through education that my wish will be fulfilled, and\nthe cause of education in India will ever be very close to my\nHis Majesty's statement, together with the attempts of Mr.\nGokhale, forced the Government to pay more attention on\nprimary education. The Indian Educational Policy, 1913,\nmade a significant statement on the compulsory and free\neducation in the words that\nFor financial and administrative reasons of decisive weight the\nGovernment of India has refused to recognise the principle of\ncompulsory education; but they desire the widest possible\nextension of primary education on a voluntary basis, regards\nfree elementary education the time has not yet arrived . . . in\nprovinces elementary education is already free and in the\nmajority of provinces liberal provision is already made for\ngiving free elementary instruction to those boys whose parents\ncannot afford to pay fees.

Charity entails no goal, nor a mini-\nmum requirement. A duty has both (Naik, 1943).\nSuccessful Attempt of Shri Vithalbhai\nPatel--Leading to the Enactment of\nFirst Law\nSoon after the demise of Gokhale in 1915, the campaign for\ncompulsory primary education was again started by the late\nShri Vithalbhai Patel. Mr. Patel introduced in 1917 a Bill in\nthe Bombay Legislative Council for permitting municipali-\nties to introduce compulsion in municipal areas of the\nProvince of Bombay. This Bill received the ascent of the\nGovernor-General on February 5, 1918, and the Bombay\nPrimary Education (District Municipalities) Act of 1918\ncame into effect. Mr. Vithalbhai Patel was thus the main\narchitect of getting the first Act on Compulsory Primary\nEducation in British India passed by the Bombay Legislative\nCouncil. This is popularly known as the Patel Act, after its\nmover. What Gokhale tried to achieve for the entire country,\nShri Vithalbhai Patel particularly achieved for Bombay. In\n1917, he moved a bill in the Bombay Provincial Legislature\nfor introducing compulsory education in the municipal areas\n(excepting Bombay City) of the state. It was broadly based\non Gokhale's bill with two exceptions: (a) the scope was\nrestricted to municipal areas only, as Gokhale's bill was criti-\ncized on the ground that rural areas were not ripe for compul-\nsion, and (b) it did not prescribe any definite financial\nundertaking on the government which was left free to give or\nnot to give a grant-in-aid. Gokhale had, however, insisted\nthat government should bear two thirds of the entire expendi-\nture on compulsory education (Mukerji, 1964). However, the\nPatel Act awakened nationwide interest in the need of com-\npulsory primary education.\nCompulsory Education in British India,\nCompulsion\nThe passing of the Government of India Act, 1919, ushered\nin an era of rapid expansion of elementary education as this\nAct passed education for the first time in the hands of Indian\nministers. The Montagu\u00adChelmsford Constitutional Reforms\nintroduced diarchy or double rule in provincial administra-\ntion. Under the diarchical form of government in India, edu-\ncation of Indian children became a \"transferred\" subject, but\nfinance remained a \"reserved\" subject. Under the reformed\nconstitution, the Indian ministers enjoyed certain powers\nspecially in the matter of legislation; but the purse strings\nwere held by the executive councillors and the governor\nUnder these circumstances, bills for introducing compul-\nsory education were presented before every provincial legis-\nlature and soon they were passed and placed on the statute\nbooks of the country. The Montagu\u00adChelmsford reforms\nmarked the end of direct colonial responsibility for education\nunder British India. Professor Nalini Juneja (2003) recorded\nCompulsory Education Act on its Statute Book. Thus, the\nnewly elected legislatures replied to the defeat of Mr.\ncompulsory education in British India may rightly be\nregarded as the bloom--period of compulsion. Table 1 gives\ndetailed information regarding them.\nThe following statistics in Table 2 tell the tale of achieve-\nments in terms of number of areas under compulsion in the\nHowever, owing to the Montagu\u00adChelmsford Reforms,\nIndian ministers were unable to effect any major changes\nin education because finance, a reserved subject, was under\nthe control of the English councillors. Financial difficul-\nties prevented the provincial governments from taking up\nambitious schemes of educational expansion or improve-\nment. Consequently, progress of Compulsory Education\nAct occurred in terms of legislatures. The progress of com-\npulsion just before the last decade from the attainment of\nindependence of the country may also be easily clear from\nencouraging. This system of governance was later on ended\nwith the introduction of provincial autonomy in 1937 through\nthe Government of India Act of 1935. With the introduction\nof provincial autonomy, the Indian National Congress\nassumed the office in seven provinces out of 11. The educa-\ntion ministers under provincial autonomy could command\nfar larger resources than the ministers under diarchy ever did.\nAlthough detailed plans for comprehensive expansion of\nelementary education were developed, the implementation\nwas restricted because of the occurrence of the Second World\nWar.\nWardha Scheme of Basic Education,\nThe majority of Indian leaders were highly dissatisfied with\nthe progress and the nature of the system of education preva-\nlent in the country. In 1937, Gandhiji published in the Harijan\na series of articles discussing his educational ideals. He\nwanted his scheme of education to be self-supporting,\nbecause he felt that true education should always stands on\nEducational Conference was called at Wardha under the\npresidentship of Mahatmaji shortly after his articles on edu-\ncational ideas appeared in the Harijan. The conference then\nappointed a committee with Dr. Zakir Husain as its chairman\nto prepare a tentative scheme and syllabus in the light of the\nresolutions passed in the conference. The report of the com-\nmittee was published under the title \"Basic National\nEducation\" in 1938 and it is popularly known as the Wardha\nScheme, because it is closely associated with Wardha. The\nscheme fervently mentioned a plan of 7-year (7-14) course of\nfree and compulsory education. In 1938, this new system of\neducation was put into practice in the six major Congress\nprovinces, namely, Bombay, United Provinces (U.P.), Central\nProvinces (C.P.), Madras, Bihar, and Orissa (Mukerji, 1951).\nThe Central Advisory Board of Education was quick to\nsee the great merit of the Wardha Scheme and appointed\nthe Wardha Education Committee of Central Advisory\nBoard of Education in January 1938 under the chairman-\nship of Shri B. G. Kher to examine its possibilities. The\nKher Committee accepted the principle of education\nthrough activity and recommended that the age range of\nowing to the outbreak of the World War II, and as a protest\nagainst the government's policy of compelling India to\nparticipate in War, Congress ministries tendered resigna-\ntions.

However, the Wardha Scheme of Mahatma Gandhi\nstrengthened the hope for the enforcement of free compul-\nsory education in the country. This was also an effort\ntoward the universalization of primary education in British\nIndia.\nNationwide Plan\nThe need for providing India with a system of education in\napproximation to those available in other civilized countries\ndrew the serious attention of leading educationists of the\ncountry during the last decade. Sir John Sargent, the then\neducational adviser with the Government of India, was asked\nby the Reconstruction Committee of the Viceroy's Executive\nCouncil to prepare a memorandum on Post-War Educational\nDevelopment in India (Mukerji, 1951). The Report on Post-\nWar Educational Development in India, approved by the\nCentral Advisory Board of Education in 1944, visualized a\nnational educational system. The Report begins with the\nwords \"Upon the education of the people of this country, the\nfate of this country depends\" (Government of India, 1944, p.\n6). These words contain a universal demand. It remarkably\nprovides for universal, compulsory, and free primary or\n\"Basic\" education for all children between the ages of 6 and\n14 under the following two heads:\n1. Free and compulsory junior basic education of 5\nyears for all children in the age group 6 to 11; and\n2. Compulsory senior basic education of 3 years for\nfour fifths of the children in the age group 11 to 14.\nThe Sargent Plan also concluded that\na system of universal, compulsory and free education for all\nboys and girls between the ages of six and fourteen should be\nintroduced as speedily as possible though in view of the practical\ndifficulty of recruiting the requisite supply, of trained teachers it\nmay not be possible to complete it in less than forty years.\nThe Report of the Kher Committee,\nHowever, soon after the attainment of independence, the\nproblem of evolving a national system of education was\ntaken up for consideration. At that time, there was a general\nfeeling in the country that the broad policies recommended\nby the Sargent Report were sound and acceptable, but the\nperiod covered by it was too long. A committee was, there-\nfore, appointed, under the chairmanship of the late Shri B. G.\nKher, to consider the extent to which the proposals of the\nSargent Report needed modifications from this point of view\nand also to suggest the manner in which funds required for\nthe program should be raised (Government of India, 1965).\nThe Report of the Committee on the Ways and Means of\nFinancing Educational Development in India, 1950, accepted\nthe program of universal, compulsory, and free basic educa-\ntion as proposed in the Plan itself but reduced the time span,\nstating universal compulsory education in the age group 6 to\nprovided for the age group 6 to 11 in two Five-Year Plans and\nthat for the age group 11 to 14 in the Third Five-Year Plan.\nThe Committee also recommended that\nthe Provinces should aim at introducing universal compulsory\neducation for the children of 6-11 age--group within a period of\nten years but if financial conditions compel, the programme may\nbe extended over a large period but in no circumstances should\nThis recommendation ultimately shaped the foundation of\nArticle 45 under the Directive Principles of the Constitution\nin free India, mandating that\nState shall endeavour to provide within a period of ten years\nfrom the commencement of this Constitution for free and\ncompulsory education for all children until they complete the\nEver since, efforts were being made toward the movement\ndiscourse on the right to free and compulsory education from\nDirective Principle to Fundamental Right in the postconstitu-\ntional era. Thus, a universal system of free and compulsory\nprimary education remained a mere dream of our education-\nists and nation builders till 1947 under the British Raj. Table\n4 shows areas brought under the compulsory primary educa-\nThis table also shows that compulsory primary education\nhad not been introduced only in Assam, North West Frontier,\nand in Centrally Administered Areas except Delhi.\nThe total legislations on compulsory education during\npreindependence can be divided into two distinct time peri-\nods. The first period started with Gokhale's Bill in 1911 in\nthe Imperial Legislative Council, which though rejected,\nprovided the genesis for legislation on compulsory education\ntransfer of education to Indian ministers. With this transfer,\nthe second phase in the history of compulsory education in\nIndia began. The Compulsory Education Acts that were\npassed during these two phases are presented in Table 5.\nIt is clear that there has been no dearth of legislations to\nmake education free and compulsory in India before the\nattainment of independence. Besides these acts, which were\npassed by the British India, many princely states, such as\nBaroda, Travancore, Manipur, and so forth, had taken the lead\nand initiative to provide compulsory education through legis-\nlative measures. Nearly every province passed a compulsory\neducation act but these remained largely inoperative, mainly\nbecause local bodies were not willingly to levy special taxes\nto finance primary education. Under the British Raj, educa-\ntion was served to the Indians in the interest of their colonial\npower. However, the demands, efforts, and struggles by our\nIndians for making education free and compulsory before\nindependence have definitely established a sound foundation\nthat has shown a right direction during the postindependence\nperiod. Consequent upon the continued efforts of the leaders,\nthe Government of independent India kept the provision of\nfree and compulsory education to all children in the\nConstitution of India.\nConclusion\nIndia was under the British Raj for more than two centuries,\nbefore the attainment of freedom in 1947. During the first\nphase of the East India Company rule, Westernized system of\neducation for Indian subjects was not under the purview of\nthe Company's original policy as its main object was trade. It\ntook no educational ventures for nearly 100 years of its\nCompany embarked on its political career in India, there was\nno education system organized and supported by the state\nin the Charter a clause that made it \"not obligatory but law-\nful\" for the Governor-General in Council to set apart for edu-\ncation a sum of not less than 1 lakh of rupees. This clause\nwas the first legislative admission of the right of education to\nparticipate in the public revenues of India. Till 1823, the\nCompany did little for education as it was more interested in\nwars, treaties, and settlement of debts than in establishing\nschools. Ultimately, Lord Macaulay, in his Minutes of\nFebruary 2, 1835, instituted an education policy in support of\nthe British Raj by establishing the hegemonic influence of\nEnglish as medium of colonial \"instruction\" to \"form a class\nwho may be interpreters between us and the millions whom\nwe govern--a class of persons Indian in blood and colour,\nbut English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect\"\nan act of disinterested magnanimity. It would lead to the sta-\nbility and permanence of the British Raj. The real motive\nbehind the Macaulay system of education was to produce\npersonnel for employment in the newly set up Revenue and\nPublic Works Departments of the Provinces. The educational\npolicy laid down in 1835, and reaffirmed in the Wood's\nEducational Despatch in 1854, was on the whole adhered to\nWood's Despatch led to the rapid Westernization of the edu-\ncational system in India. The indigenous system gradually\ngave place to the Western system of education and private\nIndian effort also gradually appeared in the field. During the\nthe recommendations of the Indian Education Commission,\nthe responsibility for primary education was transferred to\nlocal bodies. But due to the absence of funds from\nGovernment, sufficient progress could not be made. The\nlocal bodies too could not vigorously levy an education cess\nfor fear of displeasing their electorate, and demand for more\nmoney for the expansion of primary education could not be\nProvince\nAge group under\ncompulsion\nAreas with boys only under\ncompulsion\nAreas with girls only under\ncompulsion\nNumber of towns\nand cities\nNumber of\nvillages\nNumber of towns\nand cities\nNumber of\nvillages\naIntroduced only in Ward No. 9 of Calcutta Corporation.\nbIn 11 of these towns, certain wards are under compulsion.\ncA few wards only are under compulsion.\ndNine out of 12 wards of Old Delhi Municipal Committee are under compulsion.\nmet (Dayal, 1955). The laissez-faire policy, enunciated by\nthe Indian Education Commission (1882), had led to the rise\nof numerous privately managed schools and colleges (Basu,\n1982). The reforms envisaged by Lord Curzon did not\nattempt any reorganization of the primary education system\nor suggest any concrete program for the solution of the\nimmense problem of illiteracy. Curzon justified the increase\nof official control over education in the name of quality and\nefficiency but actually sought to restrict education and disci-\npline the educated mind toward loyalty to the government.\nThe nationalist mind saw in Curzon's policies an attempt to\nstrengthen imperialism and sabotage development of nation-\nActually, the demand for free and compulsory primary\neducation in India under the British Raj started formally just\nafter the passing of the Compulsory Education Acts in\nand Jyotiba Phule from Bombay Presidency, in their evi-\ndence, placed an emphatic demand for 4 years of compulsory\nprimary education before the Hunter Commission, 1882.\nSince then, our Indians took the baton. What Gokhale failed\nto achieve for the whole of India, Shri Vithalbhai Patel\nachieved, at least in theory, for Bombay. Gokhale's defeat\nshaped the demand for free and compulsory primary educa-\ntion into a national one. Since the end of direct colonial\nresponsibility for education after the passing of the\nGovernment of India Act, 1919, the Indians got ample scope\nfor passing Compulsory Education Acts in most of the prov-\ninces. Although the introduction of compulsion in all the\nActs was left to the discretion of the local bodies, they were\nhardly ready to court unpopularity by levying any additional\ncess. With the existing provincial resources of income, the\nActs could have little more than symbolic value (Dayal,\n1955). Local option in the matter of compulsion was respon-\nsible for inaction. In the Report, Hartog Committee aptly\nopined that the responsibility for mass education rests pri-\nmarily with the state and the provision of educational facili-\nties for all classes of the community and for all areas should\nnot be left entirely to the mercy of local authorities, who may\nbe unwilling, either for political or other reasons, to initiate\nschemes by which compulsion may be financed, or who,\nowing to the backwardness of the area or the people, may be\nunable to devise suitable measures for compulsion on their\nown initiative (Government of India, 1929). The Montford\nReforms gave only a semblance of power to the provincial\nministers of education who could do little beyond making\npaper schemes. Indian ministers had no control over impor-\ntant departments like finance. The principle of compulsion\nwas theoretically accepted in almost all the provinces and\nCompulsory Education Acts passed everywhere. But as the\nS. No. Title of the Act Year of passing\n1.

U.P. = United Provinces.\nlocal authorities, who were mainly responsible for Primary\nEducation, were unwilling to carry out the policy of compul-\nsion for more than one reason, the Compulsory Education\nActs generally remained a dead letter (Dayal, 1955). It can\nbe claimed that only the concept of compulsory elementary\neducation came to be accepted in theory and was incorpo-\nrated in the laws of the land, especially after the transfer of\neducation to Indian control in 1921 but financial difficulties\nprevented the Indians from taking up ambitious schemes of\nimplementation or improvement. At last, the Sargent Plan,\n1944, proposed that the universal compulsory and free edu-\ncation of 8 years was not possible to achieve in a time frame\nof less than 40 years due to paucity of trained teachers, finan-\ncial burden, and ever-increasing number of children.\nAlthough the Kher Committee, 1950, after the attainment of\ncation remained an unfulfilled dream during the British Raj,\nin spite of the stirring efforts of the nationalist leaders, edu-\ncationists, and politicians. Colonial interests or power within\nthe educational policies in British India in the form of hidden\nagenda was the key barrier to the fulfillment of the demand\nof Indians. Right or demand for the free and compulsory edu-\ncation for Indian children under the British Raj was consis-\ntently denied and it has also been consistently delayed in free\nIndia. The colonial power shaped and guided the educational\npolicy and the educational institutions promoted the needs of\nthe colonizer, ignoring the aspirations of the colonized. The\nneeds of the colonial powers always determined the develop-\nment of education system in British India. Despite many rec-\nommendations and suggestions for free and compulsory\nprimary education, colonial government always left the issue\nunder either local self-governments or the private enterprises\nand philanthropic efforts. The passage to free and compul-\nsory education in India ultimately arrives at its final destina-\ntion when it became a justifiable fundamental right in the\ndred years since Gokhale introduced his private Bill in the\nImperialAssembly, seventy one years since Mahatma Gandhi\ngave the call for universal education in 1937; sixty one years\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
