No\u00ebl-Miller 1\n Introduction\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic has had a devastating impact on the mortality and life\nexpectancy of communities in which prevalence remains high (Boerma, Nunn, and\nWhitworth 1998; Ainsworth and Over 1997; Nicoll, Timaeus, Kigadye, Walraven, and\nKillewo 1994). Despite the difficulty of accurately measuring deaths from AIDS, the\nmortality and life expectancy consequences of the epidemic have dominated\ndemographic research on the topic. This paper considers a perspective that has so far\nreceived much less attention from the research community by focusing on the\nrelationship between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and childbearing. I examine whether and\nhow rural Malawians alter their childbearing as a consequence of concern about the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic in a setting where an estimated 16% of the adult population carries\nThe present research is embedded in a larger debate, which opposes two\ncompeting ideas for the childbearing effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. On one hand,\nresearchers have raised the possibility that men and women at high risk of becoming\ninfected with HIV or already infected may attempt to increase their pace of childbearing\n(Temmerman et al. 1994; Gregson 1994). This hypothesis is based on the defining role\nplayed by reproduction in shaping adult personal and social identities, particularly in\nthe African context. The speculation has been that upon becoming aware of a\nheightened risk of infection, individuals would attempt `to accomplish unmet\nreproductive goals, knowing that they will not live a normal life span' (Setel 1995:\nAbstract). However, interest has also been expressed for the idea that the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic will exert a downward pressure on childbearing as individuals faced with the\ndisease opt to reduce their fertility out of fear for a possible transmission of the virus\nand concern for their children's future care (Gregson, Zhuwau, Anderson, and\nChandiwana 1997; Aka-Dago-Akribi, Desgrees Du Lou, Msellati, Dossou, and\nKaona 2000). Under a `natural fertility regime' where childbearing is assumed non-\nvolitional and conscious control of fertility does not exist, explanations for the fertility\nreducing effect of HIV/AIDS rely on the classical proximate determinants, primarily\ncoital frequency.\nThis debate is relevant insofar as it points to one of the three broader theoretical\npathways for a relation between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and childbearing (Note 2),\nnamely individual behavioral changes. Childbearing and the HIV/AIDS epidemic may\nfor instance be related through insurance and replacement strategies, a delayed age at\nmarriage or start of sexual activity, increases in divorce or separation rates,\nmodifications in levels of condom use and increased abstention from sex, all resulting\nfrom the fear of infection (Zaba and Gregson 1998). The second theoretical pathway is\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 321\nthrough biological determinants. There exists convincing evidence based on population\nsurveys that those who are sero-positive are less likely to bear children than those who\ndeterminants include increased partner mortality, increased menstrual disorders,\ndecreased production of spermatozoa and reduced coital frequency due to decreased\nlibido (Zaba and Gregson 1998). Finally, changes in the age structure at the population\nlevel due to excess mortality among high-risk groups can potentially add to the\nchildbearing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Zaba and Gregson 1998).\nCharacteristics of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on childbearing have a\nnumber of consequences for comprehending aggregate demographic trends in affected\nareas. Particularly, knowledge of the childbearing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is\nimportant because of the latter's close relationship to the rate of population growth. A\nchange in the population age structure due to age-selective mortality of individuals in\ntheir reproductive years is likely to result in a slight initial decline in the crude birth rate\n(assuming that the proportional decline in the number of births is greater than the\nproportional decline in the total number of person years lived). However, this trend will\nbe sustained in the long run only if reductions in the underlying total fertility rates are\nalso sustained. In addition, childbearing changes due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic are\nlikely to influence the process of fertility transition and to complicate our\nconceptualization of it (Caldwell, Caldwell, and Quiggin 1989).\nThis paper explores the implications of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on individual\nchildbearing. The dataset on which this research is based does not contain information\non HIV status or on AIDS deaths. Nonetheless, the respondents are well aware of the\nepidemic: most are familiar with the symptoms of AIDS, know someone who has died\nof AIDS (i.e. with these symptoms), are aware of how HIV is transmitted, and know\ntheir own behavior and enough about their spouse's behavior to understand whether or\nnot they are at risk (Watkins 2003; Smith and Watkins 2003; Smith this issue; Zulu and\nChepngeno this issue; Schatz 2002). As I show later, when asked whether they were\nworried that they might `catch AIDS' (the distinction between HIV and AIDS is blurred\nin the rural Malawian context) only a small fraction of all respondents reported that they\nwere not worried at all, and nearly two thirds said they were `worried a lot'. Some of\nthose who are worried may well be infected: since few are tested for HIV, however,\nthey do not have clinical confirmation. Others, infected or not, may perceive they are\nalready infected, either as a result of their own sexual behavior or what they know or\nsuspect about their spouse. They may also perceive that they are at great risk of\ninfection and death in the future. And still others perceive that they are not at risk,\nperhaps because they have not themselves engaged in extramarital sex and believe their\nhusband has been faithful. It is reasonable to hypothesize that these differences in worry\nwould have an effect on childbearing (for a similar argument that perceptions of levels\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n322 http://www.demographic-research.org\nof child mortality rather than the actual levels are primary in influencing childbearing,\nThe following sections summarize the evidence to date for the interaction between\nHIV/AIDS and childbearing and propose a methodology for analyzing the association\nbetween individual childbearing and heightened concern about HIV infection and AIDS\ndeath in rural Malawi. I conclude with a discussion of my results.\n2. What do we know about the association between HIV/AIDS and\nchildbearing?\nThe now emerging body of literature exploring the childbearing effects of the\nHIV/AIDS epidemic has most commonly been summarized according to the basic\ndistinctions in interactive pathways already mentioned: effects of the epidemic (1) at the\nindividual biological level, (2) at the individual behavioral level and (3) at the\ncompositional level (UN Population Division 2002). In the following review of the\nliterature I adopt a similar approach while distinguishing between individual biological\nand individual behavioral mechanisms through which the HIV/AIDS epidemic might\naffect fertility. I also distinguish between studies in which HIV status is known to\nresearchers only, those in which HIV status is also known to respondents, and those in\nwhich HIV status is known to neither researcher nor respondent.\nIt is important to know that overall, there is little empirical evidence on the impact\nof heightened mortality from AIDS on childbearing in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact,\ndemographic modelers of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic have too commonly\nassumed no childbearing response to HIV/AIDS. For instance, a report titled The AIDS\nEpidemic and its Demographic Consequences (UN and WHO 1991) presents seven\nmathematical models for the demographic consequences of the spread of the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic, none of which include a fertility response.\nBiological mechanisms are thought to account for most of the fertility effect of\nHIV/AIDS on already infected individuals. In a review of the evidence for the fertility\nimpact of the epidemic in Uganda, Zambia and Tanzania, Zaba and Gregson (1998)\nconclude that in non-contracepting populations, the fertility of HIV-infected women is\nsubstantially lower than that of HIV-negative women. From the studies reviewed\n(Carpenter et al. 1997; Gray et al. 1998; Fylkesnes, Ndhlovu, Kasumba, Musonda, and\nSichone 1998), the authors estimate a 25-40% loss in fertility among infected women\nand a reduction of approximately 0.4% in the total fertility rate with each percentage\npoint increase in female HIV prevalence figures. Similar results were found by other\nresearchers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Ryder et al. 1991), in Uganda\n(Sewankamboo et al. 1995) and in Rwanda (Allen et al. 1993). In addition, they find\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 323\nthat the fertility of HIV-positive women varies with age: young HIV-positive women\ndo not seem to experience any loss in fertility and the reduction in cumulated fertility\nbecomes more severe as women age. An interesting result of this research points to the\nprimary role of fetal losses through miscarriages, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths\nresulting from infection with HIV and co-infection with other sexually transmitted\ndiseases (STDs), particularly syphilis (Bracher and Santow 2001; Gregson et al. 1997;\nDe Cock, Zadi, and Adjorlolo 1994; Langstone et al. 1995). Moreover, HIV-infected\nwomen typically experience reductions in their sexual drive as well as reductions in\nfecundability and a possible decrease in the production of spermatozoa or damage to\nsperm morphology and function in their infected male partners (Gray et al. 1998;\nCrittenden, Handelsman, and Stewart 1992; Krieger et al. 1991; Gresenguet, Belec,\nWhile researchers recognize biological effects as being primarily responsible for\nreduced fertility among HIV infected individuals, there remains some uncertainty\nregarding possible confounding behavioral effects (Zaba and Gregson 1998). The bulk\nof the research on the childbearing-related behavioral effects of HIV infection reflects\nthe basic fact that in sub-Saharan Africa, most who do become aware of their\nseropositive status will do so late in the progression of AIDS symptoms. They are thus\nnot likely to remain well long enough to significantly alter their childbearing-related\nbehavior. By and large, the research supports the hypothesis that childbearing-related\nbehavior of HIV infected individuals does not depend on their knowledge of being\nseropositive (Heyward et al. 1993). A number of studies have found that condom use\nfor instance is not altered after individuals become aware of their HIV infection (Lutalo\nAkribi and colleagues (1999) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire concludes that HIV positive women who\nare aware of their condition report no intention of modifying their sexual behavior.\nFinally, there exists no convincing evidence that periods of breastfeeding and of post-\npartum abstinence are modified by the awareness of an HIV positive status. Because of\nthe difficulties associated with measuring direct behavioral changes due to an HIV\npositive status, researchers have focused their attention on variations in childbearing\nintentions. This segment of the literature reports on the ambiguity in changes of\nchildbearing desires that accompany knowledge of one's HIV positive condition. The\nstudy by Aka-Dago-Akribi and colleagues (1999) is partially representative of a small\nset of studies highlighting women's desire to continue childbearing after they are\nRutenberg et al. 2000). In this study, a pregnancy was thought to symbolize a woman's\nown health or at least her capacity to bear a healthy child (Ankrah 1991). Fear of\nabandonment by husband and community was frequently cited as a motivation for\navoiding any suspicion of HIV infection (Maman 1999). Even among HIV-discordant\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n324 http://www.demographic-research.org\ncouples in which both partners were aware of each other's status, couples chose to have\nmore children, despite the risk of transmission to the uninfected partner and the child, in\norder to avoid the danger of rejection by the community (Aka-Dago-Akribi et al. 1999).\nHowever, more common are studies which report on the negative or inexistent effects\nof the HIV/AIDS epidemic on childbearing desires (Gregson et al. 1997; Setel 1995;\nsummarize the main motivations for desiring fewer children as being related to fears\nthat continued reproduction will worsen one's health and that the virus will be\ntransmitted to the child. Additional worries have to do with parents' ability to insure\nchildren's social and material well-being once they are no longer able to care for them\nWhile the studies of differences in fertility between those who are aware of their\nHIV positive status and known to be so by the analyst versus those who are HIV\nnegative provide us with important background, it is particularly important to explore\nfertility and HIV/AIDS in contexts where sero-status is not known to the researcher and\nis unlikely to be known to the respondent--the typical situation in sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn these contexts, although they may not know this with certainty, most individuals are\nHIV-negative and thus remain exposed to the risk of contracting the virus, therefore\npotentially experiencing some degree of worry associated with this risk.\nSeveral studies have suggested that even in areas where HIV prevalence is\nrelatively high and individuals perceive a high risk of infection, such as Tanzania,\nsocial and economic forces remained the primary motivation for continued childbearing\n(Setel 1995). In Zimbabwe, where HIV prevalence is also relatively high, empirical\nfindings do not support the idea that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been leading to an\nacceleration of childbearing. Gregson and colleagues (1997) found that close to half of\ntheir respondents opted for delaying their next pregnancy because of HIV/AIDS and in\norder to facilitate the body's recovery from previous childbearing (a behavior not\nnecessarily related to HIV/AIDS).\nRegarding the sexual exposure of non-infected individuals researchers have\nfocused on issues of formation and dissolution of marital or stable unions. While\ncontradictory results have been found for the effects of the epidemic on the timing of\nmarriage, the bulk of the empirical evidence is in support of a postponement of age at\nmarriage due to the fear of engaging in sexual activity and possibly contracting HIV\n(Asiimwe-Okiror et al. 1997; Mukiza-Gapere and Ntozi 1995). A competing hypothesis\nwhich has received less support points to the possibility of earlier marriage with the\nintent of reducing risks of HIV transmission due to pre-marital sexual promiscuity. This\nis primarily because marriage is not generally perceived as a reliable guarantee of\nsexual fidelity, particularly by women. Both the hypothesis that separation or divorce\nwould be used as protection against an infected partner or avoided as part of a trend\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 325\ntowards more fidelity and stability have been raised, but research on this topic remains\ninconclusive (Mukiza-Gapere and Ntozi 1995). However, some agreement seems to\nhave been reached that the epidemic is exerting downward pressure on probabilities of\nremarriage following either widowhood or divorce, due to fears that the new spouse\nIn addition, there exists very limited and disputed evidence of a decline in extra-\nmarital sexual activity and changes in contraceptive use due to the threat of HIV\ninfection (Ng'weshemi et al. 1996). In spite of the methodological difficulties associated\nwith attributing condom use to the threat of HIV infection alone, researchers have\nestablished a link between self-evaluation of the risk of infection or HIV/AIDS\nawareness and increased condom use (Gregson et al. 1997; Lutalo et al. 2000; Agha\nestablished since, as Gregson and others find, increased condom use could partially be\nin replacement of previously preferred contraceptive methods and/or limited only to\n3. Data source and context\nThe present analysis is based on the ongoing Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change\nProject's (MDICP) longitudinal dataset collected by Watkins and collaborators from the\nthe ways in which social networks change beliefs and behavior regarding childbearing,\nfamily planning and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in rural Malawi (Watkins et al. 2003). The\nproject is based on the idea that social interaction and ideational diffusion are important\ndeterminants of reproductive attitudes and behavior.\nThe study took place in three rural Traditional Authorities (local administrative\nunits) of Malawi: (1) Rumphi district, located in the Northern part of the country, (2)\nBalaka district, located in the Southern region and (3) Mchinji District, situated in the\nCentral part of the country. The rural districts were selected with the aim of overlapping\nwith the sites of several previous surveys in order to insure comparability over time. In\neach Traditional Authority, villages were randomly selected and exhaustive listings of\nall households in these villages were established. From these households, eligible\nfemale respondents and their husbands or partners were randomly selected.\nThe MDICP interviewed ever-married women of childbearing age (15-49) and\ntheir husbands or partners divided equally across the three regions. This analysis\nfocuses solely on the 1200 female respondents of the study who were interviewed both\nin the first data collection round (Malawi 1) and in the second data collection round\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n326 http://www.demographic-research.org\n(Malawi 2). The data were obtained in face-to-face interviews conducted by Malawian\ninterviewers in the home of the respondent. Interviewers used paper questionnaires\nadministered in the language in which the respondent felt the most comfortable\nanswering. For further information on the characteristics distinguishing the rural\ncommunities where the data were collected as well as aspects of sample selection and\ndata quality, the reader is referred to the introduction to this volume.\n4. Methods and models\nI use conditional probabilities and multivariate ordered cumulative logit regression to\nestimate the relationship between worry regarding HIV/AIDS and the number of\nchildren born to a respondent between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.\nThe number of children that were born to a woman between rounds of data\ncollection was determined by using the woman's responses to the following question\nasked in both surveys: \"Can you give me the total number of children you have given\nbirth to?\". The number of births between 1998 and 2001 was obtained by subtracting\nthe figure indicated in Malawi 1 from that indicated in Malawi 2. Because this process\nproduced unrealistically high and low values (Note 4), I opted for limiting the possible\nrange for the number of births to values between 0-3 and set all other data points to\nmissing (the frequency missing was 172 or 14.3% of the sample). In other words, a\nwoman was `permitted' to have had from no to three additional children between data\ncollection rounds (Note 5). Table 1 summarizes the distribution of the sample according\nto the respondent's number of births between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.\nTable 1: Sample distribution of respondents by number of births between Malawi\nThe measure of the explanatory variable of key interest, i.e. a respondents concern\nregarding HIV/AIDS, was obtained by using the answers to the question `How worried\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 327\nare you that you might catch AIDS' posed in Malawi 1. The respondent was given a\nchoice between four possible answers: `not worried at all', `worried a little', `worried a\nlot' and `don't know'. Table 2 presents the sample distribution according to the\nresponses that were obtained for this question in Malawi 1. Six respondents did not\nprovide an answer (0.5% of the sample).\nTable 2: Sample distribution of respondents by degree of worry about HIV\ninfection in Malawi 1.\nDegree of Worry Number of women Percent\nThe first three options in the table above were transformed into a set of dummy\nvariables and the `not worried at all' option was set as the reference category.\nThree important notes must be made regarding the respondent's reported level of\nconcern relative to HIV/AIDS. First, this is a worry variable and not a risk variable\n(Note 6). In the 2001 MDICP round of data collection, respondents were asked about\ntheir risk: how likely they thought it was that they were already infected with HIV.\nThose who responded that it was not likely, were further asked how likely they thought\nit was that they would be infected in the future i.e. their worry regarding HIV infection.\nThe questions about risk were closely related to the questions about worry. `Worry' is\npreferable here because it is a more emotional concept, and thus arguably closer to the\nemotions and psychological factors that would lead women to delay, or hurry up\nchildbearing. Second, a caveat must be made regarding the issue of reliability of the\nrespondents' answers. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, virtually all questions related\nto HIV/AIDS are bound to suffer from misreporting. Third, for reasons of simplicity,\nintensities of concern regarding a possible HIV infection are assumed to be independent\nof childbearing between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.\nTables 3 and 4 present proportions having a given number of births between 1998\nand 2001 by age of the respondent in 1998 and proportions reporting a given degree of\nworry in 1998 by age of the respondent in 1998 respectively. These proportions are\nobtained by using a sub-sample of 1021 respondents with data on all three of the age,\nnumber of births and worry regarding HIV infection variables.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n328 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 3: Proportions of women having a given number of births between 1998 and\nTable 4: Proportions of women reporting a given degree of worry in 1998 by age\nThe data reported in Table 3 indicates that the number of births obtained between\nMalawi 1 and Malawi 2 varies with age. Specifically, the number of births obtained\nbetween 1998 and 2001 is inversely related to age such that the older the respondent,\nthe larger the probability of having had no additional children between both rounds of\ndata collection.\nTable 4 on the other hand displays strong intensities of worry across all ages. The\nproportion having some level of worry fluctuates roughly between 81% and 85% across\nthe four age groups, indicating that only a minority of women are not worried at all. In\naddition, it seems to be the case that with increasing age low intensities of worry evolve\ninto higher levels of worry.\ndegree of worry about HIV/AIDS by age category. It presents estimates of the\nconditional probability of having a given number of births for each age group. The\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 329\nprobabilities reported are conditional on a particular worry level. The age variable is\nchosen here as a control because it appeared as important in determining a woman's\nadditional number of births in the preliminary analyses just presented.\non a degree of worry regarding HIV/AIDS infection, by age of the\nrespondent.\nConditional probability that respondent's number of births between 1998 and 2001 is:\nIf the hypothesis of increased childbearing were to be supported by the analysis of\nconditional probabilities, one would expect to see a decrease in the conditional\nprobability of having no children as worry about HIV/AIDS increases. On the other\nhand, if the hypothesis of reduced childbearing were to be confirmed, one would expect\nto find that the conditional probability of having zero births increases with the level of\nworry.\nAn analysis of the conditional probabilities presented in Table 5 indicates that\ndifferent intensities of worry are associated with different probabilities of having a\ngiven fertility outcome between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. Generally speaking, the data\nseems to support the hypothesis of a reduced number of births with increased worry.\nParticularly in the age ranges 25-34 and 35-44, the conditional probability of having no\nbirths increases as the level of worry increases. Conversely, the conditional\nprobabilities of having 1, 2 or 3 births tend to decrease with increases in the degree of\nconcern. These results seem to indicate that, particularly between ages 25 and 44,\nhigher worry regarding HIV/AIDS is associated with lower probabilities of having\nadditional children between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. It must also be noted that the\nreduction in childbearing associated with relatively high levels of worry seems to be\nvery strong. In the middle age groups, movement from `no worry at all' to `worried a\nlot' results in a 25-30% decrease in the conditional probability of having at least one\nchild, a strikingly strong effect.\nThe conditional probabilities displayed in the 15-24 age panel of Table 5 carry a\nvery different message. While worry seems to be negatively associated with the number\nof births occurring to older women during 1998-2001, it does not seem to matter to the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n330 http://www.demographic-research.org\nfertility outcome of women in this youngest age group. Conditional probabilities of\nhaving had no children between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 remain roughly constant across\nall degrees of the worry condition, suggesting that the reduction in childbearing\nassociated with increased worry is not characteristic of this youngest group. This result\nmay at least partially be explained by the existence of powerful childbearing promoting\nsocial and personal demands on women at lower parity.\nFinally, I should note that, given the small sample size of the 45+ age group, I\nhave chosen to ignore the results in the corresponding age panel, but have displayed\nthem here for completeness.\nTable 5 should not be taken as definite evidence for a causal relation between\nintensity of worry regarding HIV infection and number of births in the interval between\nMalawi 1 and Malawi 2. Both `childbearing' and `worry' may be associated because of\ntheir common link to another trait of the respondent which is not considered in this\nanalysis, for instance the behavior of the husband. Women suspicious of their husband\nengaging in extra-marital sex might be subject to higher worry of contracting the HIV\nvirus. At the same time they might experience a lower frequency of intercourse due to\nreduced sexual interest in them, which would explain their lower fertility.\nIn the following paragraphs of this paper, I use multivariate ordered cumulative\nlogit regression to model the association of worry about the HIV/AIDS epidemic with\nthe number of births during 1998-2001 with an aim to confirm the preliminary evidence\nin support of the childbearing-reducing hypothesis.\nTable 6 presents the results of the regression analysis. The dependent variable is\nthe number of births obtained between 1998 and 2001. Seven models are displayed,\neach one controlling for an additional set of factors derived from standard theoretical\nunderstandings of the determinants of fertility. All control variables are Malawi 1\nvariables since the models measure the effect of characteristics present in Malawi 1 on\nsubsequent childbearing. The figures reported in Table 6 are odds ratios modeled over\nthe higher end of the 0-3 scale for the potential number of births obtained between 1998\nModel 1 displays exclusively the variables of interest, namely the worry variables.\nWhile this model undoubtedly suffers from omitted variable bias (Note 7) it, however,\nprovides results consistent with those previously obtained.

In addition, as previously predicted, the reduction in between-surveys\nfertility associated with worry is fairly large. For any dividing point we choose on the\n0-3 scale for the possible number of children born to a respondent between Malawi 1\nabove versus being below that dividing point for individuals reporting moderate or high\nlevels of worry as compared to individuals reporting no worry at all. The reported p-\nvalue for the chi-square test of the proportional odds assumption (i.e. the restriction\nimposed on the data in order to fit a cumulative ordered multinomial logit model)\nsupports the assumption that the effect of worry on the logit is identical, regardless of\nthe point of dichotomization.\nSubsequent models attempt to control for potential additional confounding effects\non the number of births between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. Model 2 controls for a\nwoman's exposure to the risk of pregnancy by using a linear form of the age variable\n(Note 8), the woman's parity, an indicator that she was married or in a stable\nrelationship in both Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 and an indicator that her husband or partner\nwas present in both Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. The last two variables serve as a rough\nproxy for exposure during the interval. The significance, signs and the order of\nmagnitude of the worry variables are conserved in Model 2. Except for `husband\npresent in both data collection rounds', all of the controls for exposure to the risk of\npregnancy seem to affect the number of births obtained between 1998 and 2001. The\neffect of age is consistent with the results of Table 3 and of the analysis of conditional\nprobabilities.\nModel 3 controls for social and cultural variables including religion, tribe and\nregion. However, due to high correlation between these variables, I choose to retain\nonly the religion variables. Indeed, roughly speaking, the Southern region consists of\nfive ethnic groups, the two predominant ones being the Yao and the Chewa. Most\ninhabitants of this part of the country are Moslem and/or practice indigenous religions.\nThe central part of Malawi is populated mainly by Chewa who practice a wider range of\nreligions, including Catholicism. Finally, Northern Malawians tend to be Tumbuka and\ntypically practice Protestantism. Table A1 (Appendix A) presents a correlation matrix\nfor the religion and tribe variables. The results of Model 3 show that the Moslem\nvariable is highly significant and has a strong positive effect on the number of births\nbetween surveys. In this model, the coefficients on the worry variables remain\nsignificant and retain their negative sign. Note, however, that Model 3 presents a\nnoticeably stronger effect of `being very worried' (45.5% reduction in the odds of being\nat the higher end of the scale for the number of births versus being at the lower end of\nthe scale) than of `being a little worried' (35.4% reduction).\nModel 4 controls for the educational experience and the opportunity cost of a\nwoman's time by including a variable tracking whether she ever attended school.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 333\nSchool attendance has a negative effect on the odds of having a higher number of births\nversus having a lower number of births, but is not significant. The coefficients of the\nworry variables remain virtually identical to those in Model 3.\nModel 5 controls for the effect of family planning by including variables for the\ngeneral usage in the woman's community and for a woman's usage in Malawi 1. Again,\nthis last variable was the best available proxy for usage during the interval. As would\nhave been expected, women using family planning in 1998 experienced a reduction (-\n11.5%) in the odds of having a relatively large number of births between surveys versus\nhaving a relatively small number of births between surveys. Importantly, while both the\nworry variables have retained their sign and their magnitude, only the `very worried\nvariable' remains marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value 0.06).\nModel 6 controls for the availability of and integration in HIV/AIDS social\nnetworks. The MDICP dataset contains information on whether or not the respondent\nhas talked with her husband or partner about HIV and on the number of people she has\n`chatted with about HIV'. In addition, I create an HIV/AIDS network index which\ntracks the number of positive responses to questions inquiring whether the respondent\nhas ever a) heard a talk at the clinic/hospital about protection against HIV/AIDS, b)\nheard a radio program about protection against HIV/AIDS, and c) been visited by health\npersonnel in her home with information about protection against HIV/AIDS. Because\nthe AIDS network index is strongly correlated with the `talked with husband about\nHIV' variable (see Table A2 in Appendix A), I drop the latter variable in Model 6. The\ncontrol variables introduced in this model do not seem to have much of an effect on the\nnumber of births Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. In addition, the `very worried' variable\nremains strongly associated with a reduction in the odds of being at the higher end of\nthe number of births scale as opposed to being at the lower end of this scale (37.1%\nreduction) and is marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value 0.06). On the other\nhand, the `worried a little' variable remains statistically insignificant with, however, a\nrelatively large magnitude.\nModel 7 is the full model. In addition to the classical control variables previously\nintroduced, it takes into account a woman's income and her household's asset value.\nBesides variables tracking whether or not the respondent earns some income and is\nfinancially independent, I create an index for the household's asset value. This items\nindex is a count of the number of positive responses to a series of questions inquiring\nwhether the household possess a bed with mattress, a radio, a bicycle, a pit latrine and a\nparaffin lamp. Once again, the effect of these control variables is not statistically\nsignificant. Nevertheless, the `very worried' and the `worried a little' variables of\ninterest have retained their magnitude and sign characteristics in this last model. Higher\nintensities of worry are associated with strong decreases in the odds of having a larger\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n334 http://www.demographic-research.org\nbirths in the same time frame (the decrease in the odds is 28.7% and 38.9% for the\n`worried a little' and `worried a lot' variables respectively). Finally, while the `worried\na little' variable does not reach statistical significance, the `very worried' variable is\nmarginally significant at the 0.05 level with a p-value of exactly 0.05.\nThe results just presented are at least partially confirmed when the worry and\nchildbearing variables are modified or measured in a slightly different fashion. Table 7\npresents odds ratios obtained from fitting multivariate ordered cumulative logit\nregressions (Models A and B) and logistic regression (Model C) to three different\nmodels where such alternative measures of worry and childbearing are considered. For\nall three of these models, the control variables are identical to those considered in\nModel 7 (see Table 6). Models A and B in Table 7 also retain the outcome variable\nconsidered so far, i.e. the number of births obtained between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.\nModel A considers the association between a dichotomized version of the worry\nvariable and the number of births between survey rounds. In this model, the worry\nvariable, thus opposes `no worry' to `some worry'. The results indicate that `some\nworry' is associated with a 36.8% decrease in the odds of having a relatively large\nnumber of children in 1998-2001 versus having a relatively small number of children in\nthat interval. Again, this coefficient is marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value\n0.05). Model A thus provides some support for the results obtained using the original\nset of worry variables (see Model 7, Table 6).\nModel B measures a woman's worry through her level of concern regarding her\nhusband's extra-marital relationships. Dummy variables were created tracking whether\nthe woman: a) knows, b) suspects, c) can't know and d) does not think that her husband\nhas sexual relations with other women. The last variable (`does not think that her\nhusband has sexual relations with other women') is used as a reference category.\nInterestingly, knowing, suspecting and not being able to know that one's husband has\nsexual relationships with other women are all associated with a negative effect on the\nodds of being at the higher end of the number of births scale versus being at the lower\n`suspect' and `not able to know' variables respectively). However, none of these three\nvariables appears to be significant. The finding that the `know' variable is of a smaller\nmagnitude than the suspect variable is not contradictory with the hypothesis that high\nlevels of worry negatively influence the number of births between Malawi 1 and\nMalawi 2. In fact, knowing that one's husband has sexual relations with other women is\nnot necessarily synonymous to being worried about HIV/AIDS since these sexual\npartners are likely to be trusted co-wives. On the other hand, the finding that the\n`suspect' variable matters relatively more indicates that less legitimate extra-marital\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 335\nTable 7: Multivariate ordered cumulative logit regression (Models A and B) and\nlogistic regression (Model C) of various measurements of the number of\nbirths obtained between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 on alternative measures\nof worry, Odds Ratios.\nModel A\na\nModel B\nb\nModel C\nc\nWorry variables (Model A)\nNot worried at all ---\nWorry variables (Model B)\nKnows that husband has sex with other women 0.839\nSuspects that husband has sex with other women 0.702\nCan't know whether husband has sex with other women 0.909\nDoes not think that husband has sex with other women ---\nWorry variables (Model C)\nNot worried at all ---\nExposure to the risk of pregnancy\nSocial and cultural characteristics\nProtestant / other religion --- --- ---\nEducation level & opportunity cost of time\nUsage of family planning\nHIV/AIDS social networks\nWoman's income & household's asset value\n--- Reference category\na In Model A worry is measured as a dichotomous variable opposing `some worry' to `no worry'.

The outcome variable\nis the number of births obtained between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.\nc In Model C worry is measured with the original worry variables (see Table 6). The estimated outcome variable is a dummy variable\ntracking whether or not the respondent has had at least one birth since Malawi 1. The model predicts a value of 1 on the dummy\nvariable (i.e. the respondent had a child since Malawi 1)\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n336 http://www.demographic-research.org\nsexual relationships, -- which are likely to involve unknown and mistrusted women and\nare thus potentially more worrisome to the wife--, have a greater effect on the number\nof births obtained between data collection rounds.\nFinally, a third model (Model C) measured a woman's between-survey\nchildbearing based on retrospective estimates of the timing of her latest birth. Using the\nMalawi 2 question: `When was your last child born' I created a dummy variable\ntracking whether or not the respondent had had at least one birth since Malawi 1. In\nModel C I revert back to the original measurement of a woman's level of worry. The\nresults of Model C indicate that women who were moderately worried in 1998 had\n28.7% lower odds of having at least one child between surveys (note that the coefficient\nis not statistically significant). Similarly, being very worried in 1998 is associated with\na reduction of 38.9% in the odds of having had at least one birth between Malawi 1 and\nMalawi 2. This effect is marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value 0.05). In sum,\nthe direction of the relationship between worry and between-survey childbearing in\nModel C is again consistent with the hypothesis of reduced childbearing in the presence\nof concern regarding HIV infection elicited by previous results.\n5. Discussion: Pathways for the association between HIV/AIDS\nworry and childbearing\nTwo main results emerge from this study. First, rural Malawian women's chances\nof having had a given number of births between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 are related to\ntheir worry regarding a possible HIV infection. In accordance with the expectations of\nthe hypothesis of reduced childbearing in the presence of fears related to the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic, I have found some evidence suggesting that women who are worried about\nHIV infection have smaller odds of having a relatively large number of births between\ndata collection rounds as compared to women who reported no worry. This finding is\nparticularly true in the case of women who indicated strong levels of concern regarding\ntheir future HIV status. The present research does not provide any support for the\nhypothesis of increased childbearing in the presence of worry regarding HIV infection.\nSecond, the finding that moderate and high levels of worry seem to be associated\nwith reductions in childbearing should be differentiated by age. Women in the 15-24\nage range seem to be less subject to the childbearing depressing effect of increased\nworry regarding HIV/AIDS than women in the older age categories. An ordered\nmultinomial logit regression of the number of births between 1998 and 2001 on worry\ndifferentiating by age reveals that young women's worry is associated with increases in\nthe odds of having a relatively large number of between-survey births while older\nwomen's worry is associated with a decrease in the same odds (results not shown). I\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 337\nhave speculated that a possible explanation lies in the presence of strong childbearing\npromoting social norms and personal behavior among women in their early years of\nchildbearing. It is possible that such fertility enhancing forces might include the desire\nfor children, the socially defining role of motherhood or the inability to resist a\npartner's desire for children (Acsadi and Johnson-Acsadi 1990).\nGiven the current state of knowledge on the relationship between worry regarding\nHIV infection and childbearing, it is difficult to make conclusive remarks on the\nmechanisms underlying the reduction in childbearing associated with concern for a\npossible HIV infection. More research is needed in order to explore the channels\nthrough which worry affects childbearing and to establish its direct as well as indirect\ninfluences on the underlying proximate determinants of fertility.\nAmong all proximate determinants of fertility, concern regarding future HIV\ninfection is most likely to lead to a lowered frequency of intercourse while individuals\nattempt to protect themselves against the virus. The MDICP datasets did not collect\ninformation that would allow me to specifically test this hypothesis. However, some\ninsight can be gained from assuming that women's suspicion regarding their husband's\nextra-marital sexual relations serves as a predictor of their frequency of intercourse.\nWhile such an assumption ignores issues of distribution of power and social pressures\nin the decision to engage in sexual activity, suspicion that one's husband is unfaithful\ncan nevertheless be thought of as a reasonable rough proxy for frequency of intercourse\nfor the purpose of this preliminary analysis. Only 14% of those respondents interviewed\nin Malawi 1 who indicated not being worried about a possible HIV infection also\nreported knowing or suspecting that their husbands were sexually unfaithful. On the\nother hand, 30% of respondents with some concern that they may become infected with\nHIV in the future indicated that they suspected or knew their husbands to have extra-\nmarital sexual relations. This data thus seems to indicate an association between worry\nregarding HIV infection and knowledge or suspicion of one's husband's extra-marital\naffairs which is consistent with the hypothesis of reduced frequency of intercourse in\nthe presence of concern for becoming infected with HIV.\nOther proximate determinants likely to mediate the relationship between worry\nregarding HIV infection and childbearing include the use of contraceptives, particularly\ncondoms. Indeed, as the effects of the AIDS epidemic become increasingly recognized\nand as individuals take advice from public education campaigns, increases in the use of\ncondoms are likely to be observed (Agha 2001; Glor and Severy 1990). Establishing the\nlink between condom use and childbearing is, however, a delicate matter, since those\nmost receptive to warnings about the risks of HIV infection may also be those who have\nearlier accepted advice regarding the desirability of family planning and births\nlimitation. In addition, a possible pathway for the effect of worry regarding HIV\ninfection on childbearing points to an increased number of induced abortions. This\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n338 http://www.demographic-research.org\nhypothesis is built on the fairly common assumption that aborted fetuses are not\nreported as children ever born. Increased occurrences of abortions could be related to\nfear that the infant will be infected or that the mother and/or relatives will be unable to\nprovide adequately for the child. Finally, although the MDICP interviewed only ever\nmarried women, it is also possible that among non-married women, high intensities of\nworry would result in diminished exposure to the risk of pregnancy through reductions\nin the proportions of women every marrying. There is evidence that some women will\nrespond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by remaining single (Barnett and Blaikie 1992).\nHowever, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on decisions to\nmarry from that of further socio-economic development.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 339\nNotes\n1. UNAIDS estimated to 800,000 the number of people living with the HIV virus in\nthe same date (for further information, see\nhttp://www.unaids.org/epidemic_update/report/Final_Table_Eng_Xcel.xls).\n2. It is possible that even a substantial HIV/AIDS impact would be difficult to\ndistinguish from other influences on childbearing such as urbanization, education,\neconomic development and changes in gender roles (Notestein 1953; Thompson\n1930). These processes are also liable to interact with the HIV/AIDS epidemic in\ndetermining the nature of childbearing-related behavioral changes.\n3. The data can be found on the internet at the following address:\nhttp://www.ssc.upenn.edu/Social_Networks/. Additional information regarding the\ndataset can be found at the same address.\n4. The original dataset that I used to generate the number of births between Malawi 1\nand Malawi 2 was not purged of its implausible or improbable responses. In other\nwords, unrealistic figures for the `number of children ever given birth to' were not\ncleaned, set as missing or imputed by the survey team who collected and coded the\ndata. On the basis of this original dataset, about 14% of figures that I obtained for\nthe number of births between 1998 and 2001 were judged unrealistic. I checked the\npaper questionnaires in order to confirm that these unrealistic figures were not the\nresult of coding or programming errors.\npossible. Therefore, the lower boundary for the between survey childbearing range\nwas set to 0. In the approximately 36 months between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2,\nwomen were `permitted' 3 children at most. This slightly liberal figure was chosen\ntaking into account periods of temporary sterility in the form of post-partum\namenorrhea and the possibility of a woman giving birth to twins or to triplets. All\nvalues obtained from the original (raw) dataset which were outside the 0-3 range\nwere set to missing. No imputation technique was used to remedy the missing data\nproblem created by forcing the number of births to a 0-3 range. I made this\ndecision in order to avoid attributing a more or less arbitrary value of replacement\nto a deleted data point.\n6. Unfortunately, the 1998 round of data collection did not ask respondents about\ntheir HIV/AIDS risk (i.e. their probability of currently being infected with HIV).\nHowever, the topic was explored in Malawi 2.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n340 http://www.demographic-research.org\n7. Omitted variable bias refers to a model misspecification error whereby variables\nare excluded from the model, although they should in reality be included. It can\npotentially have fairly serious consequences since the coefficients are no longer\nguaranteed to be unbiased.\n8. Non-linear forms of the age variables were tested for. They were, however, not\nretained as they appeared not to be significant.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 10\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 341\nReferences\nAcsadi, G.
