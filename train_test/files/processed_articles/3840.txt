Functional D2 receptors activate an intracellular\nsignalling pathway that includes a cAMP-independent\nroute involving Akt/GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). To\ninvestigate the Akt/GSK3 response to the seldom-studied\nD2S receptor, we established a rat D2S receptor-expressing\ncell line [HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293/rD2S]. We\nbromocriptine and quinpirole significantly induced Akt and\nGSK3 phosphorylation, as well as ERK1/2 (extracellular-\nsignal-regulated kinase 1/2) activation. The D2S receptor-\ninduced Akt signals were profoundly inhibited by the\ninternalization blockers monodansyl cadaverine and con-\ncanavalin A. Activation of the D2S receptor in HEK-293/\nrD2S cells appeared to trigger Akt/phospho-Akt transloca-\ntion to the cell membrane. In addition to our cell culture\nexperiments, we studied D2 receptor-dependent Akt in vivo\nby systemic administration of the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole.\nThe results show that quinpirole evoked Akt-Ser473\nphosphorylation in the ventral striatum.

DA effects are executed through action\non membrane-bound receptors that belong to a G-protein-\ncoupled receptor family (Tan et al., 2003). There are two\ndistinct classes of DA receptors, namely the D1-like (D1 and\nD5) and D2-like (D2, D3 and D4) receptors (De Mei et al.,\n2009). Compounds which act on the D2-like receptor have\nbeen used clinically to ameliorate symptoms of certain DA-\ndependent disorders. Examples include anti-psychotics (D2\nantagonist) or medications for treating Parkinson's disease\n(D2 and D3 agonists).

The receptors contain two alternatively spliced\nisoforms that differ in 29 amino acids in the region of the\nthird cytoplasmic loop (Dal et al., 1989; Montmayeur et al.,\n1991). The long isoform D2L receptors are more abundant\nthan short isoform D2S receptors in most brain regions\nreceptor knockout mice have demonstrated distinct roles for\n2003). The D2L receptor is considered to be a post-synaptic\nreceptor in the striatum regulating DARPP-32 (DA- and\ncAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa), an essential\nsignal mediator in striatal MSNs (medium spiny neurons). On\nthe other hand, the D2S receptor acts as pre-synaptic\nautoreceptor that negatively regulates the phosphorylation/\nactivation (Ser40) of tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting\nenzyme in DA synthesis or DA release from the pre-synaptic\nnerve terminals (Lindgren et al., 2003). Despite the difference\nin pre- compared with post-synaptic localization, treatment\nwith a D2 agonist resulted in a similar inhibition of adenylate\ncyclase activity by both isoforms. This effect is possibly due to\nsimilar extracellular binding domains and conserved coupling\nwith Gi\n/Go\nprotein. Many Go/Gi\n-coupled receptors are known\nto activate MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases),\nincluding ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), JNK\nactivation by either D2L or D2S receptor stimulation has been\nwidely reported, but it appears to be mediated through\ndifferent signalling routes. Specifically, D2L receptor activa-\ntion recruits c-Src to transactivate the PDGF (platelet-derived\ngrowth factor) receptor and downstream Ras/Raf/MEK\n(MAPK/ERK kinase)/ERK signalling cascade, whereas D2S\nreceptor activation may trigger receptor internalization and\nsubsequent b-arrestin/dynamin-dependent Raf/MEK/ERK sig-\nMoreover, previous reports have demonstrated that DA D2\nreceptors initiate a cAMP-independent pathway by promo-\nting an association of signalling complex containing Akt (also\nknown as protein kinase B), PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A)\nThe discovery of this novel D2 receptor-mediated signalling\npathway is particularly important since modulation of Akt\nsignal by D2 receptor could provide the cellular mechanism of\npsychostimulant-triggered mania/psychosis, as well as the\nSeveral previous studies using D2 receptor (mostly D2L)-\ntransfected cell lines or primary neural cultures demonstrated\nthat D2 activation preferentially promotes Akt phosphoryla-\ntion/activation and phosphorylation/inactivation of its sub-\nstrate GSK (glycogen synthase kinase) 3b (Kihara et al., 2002;\nsignificance of this D2-receptor-activated Akt/GSK3 signal-\nling has been extensively discussed with regard to cell survival\nor neuroprotection against oxidative stress (Kihara et al.,\nthat DA D2S receptors act as autoreceptors located in pre-\nsynaptic DA neurons (Nishi et al., 1997), D2S-receptor-\nmediated survival signalling could significantly effect the\nviability of DA neurons upon neural insult, including in\npathological processes such as Parkinson's disease and/or\ndrug addiction. Surprisingly, DA D2S-receptor-mediated Akt/\nGSK3 signalling has seldom been explored. In order to\nunderstand the significance of Akt underlying the D2S re-\nceptor and its role in vivo, we asked (i) whether the DA D2S\nreceptor, expressed in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293/\nrD2S cells, could provoke Akt/GSK3 signalling and (ii) how Akt\nsignalling in the nucleus accumbens is involved in D2/D3\nagonist-induced behavioural activation. We found in trans-\nfected HEK-293/rD2S cells that stimulation of the D2S\nreceptor leads to dual activation of ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK3b\nsignals. Furthermore, both signals were inhibited by pre-\ntreatment with an internalization blocker. Importantly, we\ndemonstrated that behavioural activation evoked by systemic\ntreatment with the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole could be\neffectively suppressed by intra-accumbens administration of\na PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor, providing direct\nevidence that the D2/D3 receptor positively regulates PI3K/\nAkt signalling.\nChemicals and antibodies\nBromocriptine, quinpirole, racropride, (2)sulpride and MDC\n(monodansylcadaverine) were obtained from Sigma.

Although\nD2S stimulation also induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in\nHEK-293/rD2S cells, there does not appear to be signal\ncross-talk between ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK3. Interestingly, we\nfound that systemic quinpirole administration in rats not\nonly induced activation of locomotion and stereotypy, but\nenhanced Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation/activation in the\nventral striatum. When PI3K inhibitor was administered\nspecifically to the nucleus accumbens-shell, systemic\nquinpirole-induced behavioural activation was significantly\nsuppressed. Both in vitro and in vivo results from the\npresent study suggest a positive role of the DA D2 receptor\nin Akt/PKB activation.\nDA D2 receptors are differentially spliced to create two\nisoforms differing by 29 amino acids in the 3rd intracellular\ndomain, namely the D2L and D2S receptors. Specific ablation\nof D2L receptor in D2L2/2 mice, thereby preserving the D2S\nreceptor, results in a D2-agonist-mediated decrease in\ntyrosine hydroxylase Ser40 phosphorylation in the substantia\nnigra, demonstrating a pre-synaptic nature of D2S auto-\nreceptor (Lindgren et al., 2003). It is of note that D2L-\nknockout mice retain locomotor and reward response to\ncocaine (Welter et al., 2007), suggesting that D2S-receptor-\nmediated intracellular events are critical in determining the\nbehavioural phenotypes of drug addiction. Therefore it is\nimportant to explore D2S-receptor-mediated signalling, in\nparticular the unexamined Akt/GSK3 pathway that was\nreported to be coupled with the D2L receptor and plays an\nessential role in psychiatric disorders (Nair and Olanow, 2008;\nclearly demonstrates that D2S receptor activation could\ndually induce ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK3 phosphorylation, wherein\na significant amount of bromocriptine-induced phospho-Akt-\nSer473 could be reduced by the internalization blockers MDC,\nwhich prevents clathrin association (Ray and Samanta, 1996),\nor ConA, which blocks receptor clustering (Pippig et al.,\nreceptor appears to activate ERK1/2 phosphorylation via\nclathrin-mediated endocytosis in a b-arrestin- and dynamin-\ndependent manner (Kim et al., 2004). On the other hand, D2L-\nevoked ERK1/2 signalling requires PDGF receptor and/or EGF\n(epidermal growth factor) receptor transactivation, inde-\npendent of b-arrestin-mediated D2L receptor internalization\ninduced ERK1/2 activity could be partly suppressed by ConA is\ncomparable with the observation by Kim et al. (2004) but, to\nsome degree, in contrast with a report by Quan et al. (2008).\nIn the latter study, the authors exclude the role of b-arrestin,\nbut show Gi2\nprotein involvement in D2S-mediated ERK\nactivation. Our results reveal the existence of both inter-\nnalization-dependent (40% inhibition by ConA but no\ninhibition by MDC) and -independent pathways underlying\nFigure 4 Time-course effect of D2S-receptor-induced ERK1/2 phosphor-\nCells were serum-starved overnight and incubated with bromocriptine\nlevels, normalized to b-actin and are presented as means\u00a1S.E.M. from at\nleast three independent experiments. *P,0.05, **P,0.01, compared with the\ncorresponding no drug treatment groups (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's\npost-hoc test).\nH.-T Chen and others\n378 E 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nFigure 5 Effect of MEK and PI3K inhibitors and internalization blockers on D2S-receptor-evoked Akt or ERK1/2 phosphorylation in\nthe internalization blockers MDC (30 mM) or ConA (250 mg/ml) or the D2 antagonist raclopride (100 mM) for 30 min prior to\nbromocriptine (10 mM) administration for 15 min.

Furthermore, the\nobservation that bromocriptine provoked Akt/phospho-Akt\ntranslocation to the cell membrane not only relates to a\nsimilar observation regarding D2L receptor activation (Nair\net al., 2003), but also demonstrates that the D2S receptor\ncould initiate a PI3K-dependent Akt/GSK3 signal since\nactivation of PI3K would recruit Akt to the plasma\nmembrane (Alessi et al., 1997). To date, the subcellular\nlocalization of Akt seems to be different among various cell\nunderlying mechanism for this difference is not known. The\nresults of the present study also revealed that endogenous\nAkt aggregated in the centrosomes and was found to\ndiffusely stain nucleus and cytoplasm in HEK-293/rD2S\ncells. It was reported that phospho-Akt localizes to the\ncentrosomes in HEK-293 and HeLa cells, and is responsible\nfor GSK-3 phosphorylation at the centrosome during\nmitosis (Wakefield et al., 2003). Furthermore, during early\ndevelopment of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo, Akt\nis able to regulate centrosome migration and spindle\norientation (Buttrick et al., 2008). Whether D2S-receptor-\nmobilized Akt would participate in mitosis requires further\ninvestigation.\nIn contrast with most in vitro observations that the D2\nreceptor positively regulates Akt and GSK phosphorylation,\nsome studies have indicated that in vivo D2-like receptor\n(D2/D3) activation appears to cause an inhibition of Akt\nand GSK3 phosphorylation, hence resulting in an activation\nparticular after prolonged stimulation by non-selective DA\nreceptor agonists such as amphetamine or apomorphine. In\nthe present study, we attempt to circumvent the profound\nsystemic effect of signal blockers by locally injecting PI3K\ninhibitor into the nucleus accumbens-shell before systemic\nchallenge with quinpirole. The results demonstrate that\ninhibition of Akt activity in the nucleus accumbens-shell\ntotally suppressed the D2/D3-agonist-induced behavioural\neffect. This result can be confirmed by biochemical analyses,\ni.e. Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation increased in the ventral\nstriatum after quinpirole injection, indicating a similar\nregulation of in vivo D2-like receptors on the Akt signal as\nobserved in vitro. We speculate that the discrepancy\nbetween the results of the present study and Beaulieu\nthe tissues analysed, i.e. we used ventral striatum (contain-\ning D2S/D2L and D3) whereas Beaulieu et al. used whole\nstriatum (D2L dominant). Secondly, we systemically treated\nrat with a specific D2 agonist, but added Akt blocker locally\ninto nucleus accumbens, whereas Beaulieu et al. analysed\ntheir samples with a non-selective amphetamine or\napomorphine injection. In a recent report, METH (meth-\namphetamine) challenge in METH-sensitized animals\nresulted in an enhanced phospho-Akt response in the\nstriatum (Pogorelov et al., 2011), indicating a more dynamic\nnature of Akt regulation upon indirect or non-specific DA\nagonist treatment.\nIn conclusion, in the present paper we report that DA D2S\nreceptors are functionally associated with Akt/GSK signal-\nling and require receptor internalization for this activation.\nThis finding suggests that D2S receptors function as a pre-\nsynaptic autoreceptor localized in both nerve terminals and\nFigure 6 Effect of systemic quinpirole administration on Akt-Ser473\nphosphorylation\nAnimals were systemically injected with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline\n(vehicle) and killed at designated times. The levels of Akt-Ser473\nphosphorylation in the ventral striatum were quantified by Western blotting.\nSince time-matched vehicle-treated controls show no difference, data were\npooled (n54 per group) and are presented as means\u00a1S.E.M. from four\nindependent experiments. *P,0.001 compared with the vehicle control.\nH.-T Chen and others\n380 E 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nsoma which offers protection to the DA neurons. Since the\nextracellular ligand-binding domains are quite similar\nbetween D2S and D2L receptors, it is difficult to determine\nthe pre-synaptic role in vivo. Our in vivo data indicates\nthat D2-like receptor-mediated Akt signalling is similar to\nprior in vitro studies, and is consistent with behavioural\nobservations using drug manipulation in the nucleus\naccumbens-shell. Although we conclude that D2/D3 recep-\ntor activation leads to GSK3 inactivation in the ventral\nstriatum, the behavioural impact of local modulation of the\nAkt/GSK3 response in the nucleus accumbens is likely to be\nquite different from the behavioural outcome generated\nfrom modulating the whole motor and/or rewarding\ncircuitry. Conditional knockout or overexpression of D2\nreceptor or Akt/GSK3 in specific brain regions should help\nresolve this discrepancy.\n"
