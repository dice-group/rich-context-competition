    "abstract": "Abstract\nGiving birth at a young age and being a victim of intimate partner violence are adversities that affect the life course of\nwomen. However, some young mothers overcome these adversities and cope well, showing a dynamic resilience pathway.\nIn this qualitative exploratory study, we examined a purposive sample of 10 resilient mothers who gave birth as adolescents\nin a situation of intimate partner violence. Their stories were gathered from individual in-depth interviews and on-site\nparticipatory observations. Data were collected and analyzed simultaneously, according to grounded theory. Inspired by\nMasten and Monn's integrated framework of resilience, the resilience pathway of the participating mothers began with the\noccurrence of the adversities addressed in this study, namely, early pregnancy combined with intimate partner violence. To\novercome these adversities, the participants deployed several protective processes: (a) establishing their maternal identity\nand the creation of a bond with the child as a turning point, (b) taking an active stance to respond to victimization, and (c)\nacting proactively and adjusting to motherhood. Promotive processes, positive adaptation indicators, and risks to positive\nadaptation complete the proposed resilience pathway. The results lead to the conclusion that increased recognition of the\nchallenges that these young mothers face and greater emphasis on the importance of their social surroundings to support\nthese protective processes would support them in their transition to motherhood and promote their well-being and that of\ntheir children.\n",

It is now well recognized that IPV during pregnancy\nmay produce serious adversities and numerous negative\nhealth effects for both mothers and babies, including low\ninfant birth weight, higher prematurity rates, low maternal\nweight gain, miscarriage, placental abruption, injuries, and\ninfections,amongothers(Chambliss,2008;Coker,Sanderson,\n& Dong, 2004; Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, & Lozano,\nconsequences of violence during pregnancy are not restricted\nto a woman's physical health. There are also consequences\nfor her mental health, social environment, and life course.\nPossible adverse mental health effects include depression,\nstress, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sui-\ncide attempts. In addition, due to IPV, some mothers may find\nit more difficult to form an attachment to their child, or they\nmight experience breastfeeding problems (Campbell, Garcia-\nEarly pregnancy, for its part, has been linked to a number\nof social, educational, and economic consequences\n(Lachance, Burrus, & Richmond Scott, 2012). Although the\nresults are inconsistent in terms of the nature and extent of\nthe consequences for women, there is general consensus that\nbecoming a parent at a young age can limit educational\nattainment, increase the probability of being welfare-depen-\ndent, and substantially lower personal and family income\nlater in life (Boden, Fergusson, & Horwood, 2008). Studies\nshow that many young mothers become isolated when they\nexperience violence, suffer depression, and have less contact\nwith their social networks (Kulkarni, 2009; Sussex &\nCorcoran, 2005). Yet, some young mothers challenge the\nassumptions of hardship, poverty, and limited parental\ncapacities that are often associated with this situation. They\nuse various protective mechanisms as well as coping and\nadaptive strategies that are thought to contribute to\nresilience.\nFor decades, scholars in various disciplines have used a\nvariety of theoretical perspectives to examine how some\npeople have managed to escape the harmful effects of severe\nadversity, cope well, and bounce back or even thrive\nsense, resilience refers to \"the capacity of a dynamic system\nto adapt successfully to disturbances that threaten its func-\ntheoretical models and evidence on resilience increased,\nthere were calls for context- and culture-dependent research\nand theorization as well as more integrated frameworks\nRecently, Masten and Monn (2015) proposed an integrated\ntheoretical framework for child and family resilience. It con-\ntains five core components that allow viewing resilience\nfrom the perspective of contemporary developmental sys-\ntems theory (Masten, 2014), which assumes that many sys-\ntems interact or co-act to shape the course of development.\nThese components (Masten & Monn, 2015) are (a) defini-\ntions of positive adaptation (for a person, a family, or any\nother system) and the scalability of adaptive functioning\nacross system levels, (b) a clear description of the pathways\nof adaptive function over time and their interplay, (c) the\nidentification of promotive processes for adaptive develop-\nment and the processes by which these effects spread across\nsystems, (d) the identification of various risks to positive\nadaptation or development and of the processes by which\nrisk spreads across systems, and (e) the identification of pro-\ntective processes that prevent or mitigate the adverse effects\nof adversity and the identification of processes by which pro-\ntective influences spread across systems.\nResilience in the Context of IPV and\nEarly Pregnancy\nIn the context of IPV and pregnancy, specific events, called\npivotal moments or turning points, may help women reject\nviolence in their intimate relationships. Examples of these\nevents are threats to their children's safety, changes in the\nfrequency or severity of violence, or improved access to nec-\nessary resources (Bhandari, Bullock, Anderson, Danis, &\nKoepsell, Kernick, & Holt, 2006). Other factors are related\nto women's decisions to end the relationship, the two most\nconsistent predictors being low-relationship commitment\nand economic independence (Koepsell et\nAccording to Bach, Weinzimmer, and Bhandari's (2013)\nstudy, pregnancy may increase women's self-esteem and\nagency, which would help them end a relationship. This con-\ncurs with another study that found that pregnancy could\nfacilitate a woman's decision to leave a relationship if she\nfelt that her child was in danger. Furthermore, the fear of\nbeing murdered and plans for the future can motivate women\nto leave a relationship, even when her partner's manipulation\nand coercion make it difficult (Moe, 2009).\nDifferent resilience processes have emerged from studies\nof combined pregnancy, violence, and young age. In her\nstudy of urban low-income mothers-to-be, Lutz (2005)\ndeveloped a theory on double binding in these women. She\ndefines the processes that women undergo to bond with their\nbaby and navigate the relationship with their abusive partner.\nThe majority of the mothers she interviewed were hesitant to\nreport the violence they experienced for fear of public scru-\ntiny and stigmatization. To maintain their public image, they\nL\u00e9vesque and Chamberland 3\nadopted different strategies that allowed them to present a\npositive image of a pregnant woman in a healthy relation-\nship. Consequently, they were living \"parallel lives\" (Lutz,\n2005). The interwoven and sometimes contradictory pro-\ncesses that these women experienced were categorized into\nfive phases that ultimately ended in a decision to stay (or not)\nin the abusive relationship (Lutz, 2005).\nBhandari's qualitative study in rural, low-income preg-\nnant women demonstrates not only some of the negative con-\nsequences of IPV on self-image, such as feelings of shame\nand worthlessness, but also that IPV did not affect maternal\nidentity. However, the decision to leave an abusive partner to\nprotect an unborn fetus as well as other children contributed\npositively to the representation of a good mother (Bhandari\net\nal., 2011). A minority of women in Bhandari and col-\nleagues' (2011) study pursued an abusive relationship, partly\ndue to their desire for their children to have a father figure.\ners found that adult (mainly parental) guidance, material sup-\nport, and a safe environment can help young mothers\nmaintain safety in a romantic relationship (Kulkarni, 2006).\nLutz, Kulkarni, and Bhandari's study indicates that end-\ning an abusive relationship during the perinatal period\nrequires a complex decision that is influenced by numerous\nfactors. They also highlight the dynamic nature of this deci-\nsion process and situate it within a larger social and cultural\ncontext. However, whereas risk factors such as physical and\nsocial isolation, lack of access to resources, poverty, and\npatriarchy, along with the consequences, have been well doc-\numented, a deeper understanding of how women cope in\nthese circumstances is needed (Bhandari etal., 2011). To bet-\nter examine the processes involved in coping with violence\nduring the perinatal period, the present study aimed to\nexplore resilience and IPV in early motherhood, defined as\noccurring before the age of 20. A constructivist posture was\nadopted, using qualitative research methods that included\nindividual interviews and on-site observations. Qualitative\nresearch is a useful and appropriate way to derive explana-\ntions from individually reported experiences (Willig, 2001).\nIt contributes to the knowledge by presenting qualitative\nfindings on resilience pathways, and more specifically, it\naims to answer the following question: How do women giv-\ning birth in a context of dual adversity, namely, young moth-\nerhood and IPV, overcome these adversities? A better\nunderstanding of resilience and coping with IPV during the\nperinatal period would have implications for practices and\npolicies designed to support young mothers.\nMethod\nData Collection\nFrench-speaking mothers living in the Montr\u00e9al metropoli-\ntan area (Canada) were interviewed individually in this\nexploratory study. The participants (a) were older than 18\nyears at the time of the interview, (b) had given birth to their\nfirst child before turning 20, (c) had been in a violent rela-\ntionship, and (d) had a positive self-assessment of overcom-\ning adversity (e.g., they felt that their mental and physical\nwell-being was satisfactory, and they were comfortable in\ntheir role as a mother). A semi-structured interview guide\nwas used, containing 16 open-ended questions covering\nthemes such as the participant's representation of her inti-\nmate relationship, her pregnancy, the violence she had expe-\nrienced, her coping skills, her social environment, her future\ngoals, and the advice she would give to someone else in her\nsituation. The guide could be adapted to the participant's\nstory. Changes were also made during the data collection\nperiod to capture relevant aspects that emerged from the\ninterviews. The participants were encouraged to share as\nmuch as possible about their background, situation, and\nexperiences. These data were complemented by on-site\nobservations (Beaud & Weber, 2003), whereby the researcher\nparticipated in two community groups of young mothers (4\nmonths with the first group, 5 months with the second; 2\ndays per week at each site) to identify the various sources of\nadversity that these women had faced and to gain a better\nunderstanding of their realities. The study sites were organi-\nzations that provide services to either young parents or spe-\ncifically to young mothers. The services included, but were\nnot limited to, counseling, support group meetings, educa-\ntional activities on various topics, on-site babysitting, and\nreferrals to external organizations for specific needs. The\nfirst author (S.L.) participated in the groups as a member,\nusing overt participant observation, and kept a daily logbook\nof observations, comments, and questions following on-site\nobservations to help contextualize certain events and percep-\ntions (Miles, Huberman, & Saldana, 2014).\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited via referrals by a counselor at the\ncommunity organization they were attending. The counsel-\nors acted as intermediaries between the researchers and par-\nticipants. They were responsible for informing eligible\nmothers about the study and transferring their coordinates to\nthe research team if they were interested in participating. We\nwere not informed about potential participants who chose\nnot to participate in this study. This recruitment procedure,\nwhich was specified by the ethics committee, had the advan-\ntage of maintaining regular contact between the participants\nand counselors, who were familiar with the various situa-\ntions of the mothers in their organizations and had the clini-\ncal expertise to identify mothers who were doing well. The\nfirst author held individual telephone conversations with\npotential participants prior to the interviews to explain the\nstudy goals, describe the discussion topics, and confirm the\npresence of IPV, measured by the Revised Conflict Tactics\nScale (CTS2; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman,\n4 SAGE Open\n1996). Interviews were conducted at a location selected by\nthe participant, with options including the site of the partici-\npant's organization, home, or a restaurant near her home.\nInterviews lasted from 45 to 90 min.All participants received\na monetary compensation of C$20, and child care was pro-\nvided if needed. Verbal and written consent was obtained\nbefore the interview. Participants'accounts were recorded on\naudiotape with their permission, and pseudonyms were\nassigned. This study was approved by the ethics committee\nof the University of Montr\u00e9al, Faculty of Medicine.\nData Analysis\nThe data analysis was based on grounded theory, which\nenables inductive identification of social processes and tra-\njectories (Darvill, Skirton, & Farrand, 2010; Glaser &\nStrauss, 1967). In accordance with grounded theory princi-\nlected and analyzed simultaneously. Thus, once an interview\nwas completed, it was transcribed and reviewed for accuracy\nand completeness (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Data collection\nfrom individual interviews ceased and saturation was consid-\nered achieved when themes were repeated and no new mate-\nrial emerged from the interviews (Morse, 1995). First, the\ntranscripts were read (and re-read) for contextual meaning,\nand the material was coded. Codes were created inductively\nto reflect participants' experiences (Glaser & Strauss, 1967),\nsorted by category, and examined in different contexts. As\nmore interviews were added, the initially developed provi-\nsional thematic coding scheme was refined. The first author\nperformed all the coding, and a second author and a qualita-\ntive expert reviewed a portion of the analyses for discrepan-\ncies. Coding issues were resolved by negotiated consensus\nand discussion (Bradley, Curry, & Devers, 2007). All analy-\nses were performed with NVivo. After preliminary analyses,\nwe consulted some of the participants about our findings in a\ngroup meeting. They were invited to comment on whether\nour interpretations accurately represented their pathways\n(Miles etal., 2014). Their feedback proved helpful, as they\nclarified some of the results of the preliminary analysis and\nconfirmed others.\nDemographic Characteristics and Pregnancy\nThe participants had given birth to their first child at from age\n15 to 19. For all but one participant, the romantic relationship\nduring the pregnancy was described as \"important.\" For\nmany, the father of their child was their first boyfriend: They\nhad been dating from a few weeks to about 3 years before\nthey became pregnant. From their testimonies, it was appar-\nent that they had all been strongly committed to the relation-\nship with the father of their child. There was a range of family\nhistories across mothers, and many reported troublesome\nevents in their family sphere, such as violence between par-\nents, mental health problems, drug abuse, separation or\ndivorce, or frequent moving. Overall, their academic back-\ngrounds were similar: They had average grades and were\nmore or less invested or interested in school. The majority did\nnot want to pursue post-secondary education. When their\npregnancy was confirmed, very few participants had well-\ndefined educational or career aspirations. At the time of data\ncollection, participants were from 18 to 33 years old, with\nyears. Six of the 10 mothers had left their abusive partner,\nwhereas four had chosen to pursue the relationship.\nCircumstances surrounding the participants' pregnancies\nvaried from a total absence of contraception to a planned\npregnancy. At one extreme, Aliz\u00e9e was shocked by her preg-\nnancy: \"It was definitely not planned. We were immature; we\ndidn't use any protection. We knew the risk was there but we\ndidn't care I guess.\"At the other end of the spectrum, we find\nMarie-Sophie, whose pregnancy was fully planned, as a way\nto escape from parental authority and live with her\nboyfriend:\nFor us, it was planned. Hum . . . we were going out together and\nmy mother decided to move to another city. It would have been\nquite far. So, we decided that I would get pregnant and we would\nlive together.\nMost of the participants fell somewhere between these two\nextremes.\nResults\nInspired by Masten and Monn's (2015) integrated frame-\nwork of resilience, the resilience pathway of the participating\nmothers was represented schematically (Figure 1), based on\nan analysis of their life course and their accounts. The path-\nway begins with the occurrence of the adversities addressed\nin this study, namely, early pregnancy combined with IPV.\nThis is followed by the deployment of protective processes\nthat enabled the participants to overcome these adversities.\nThese protective processes were (a) maternal identity and the\ncreation of a bond with the child as a turning point, (b) taking\nan active stance to respond to victimization, and (c) proactiv-\nity and adjustment to motherhood. Promotive processes,\npositive adaptation indicators, and risks to positive adapta-\ntion complete the proposed resilience pathway.\nEach component is discussed in detail below. A conscious\nchoice was made to avoid quantifying the data in terms of\nfrequency. However, in certain situations, the singularity of\nsome participants' trajectories is noted. All participants are\nrepresented by pseudonyms.\nPerceptions of Adversity\nThis study originally assumed that early pregnancy and IPV\nwould constitute two simultaneously occurring sources of\nadversity. The results for early pregnancy show that\nL\u00e9vesque and Chamberland 5\nmotherhood was central for these women, surpassing all\nother aspects of their lives (professional, social, marital, per-\nsonal). Furthermore, all participants agreed that IPV was a\nsource of adversity, even if they had difficulty identifying the\nviolent attitudes and actions associated with this term. Thus,\nalthough the maternal role was perceived as a difficult\nchoice, it was assumed, and the IPV situation was viewed as\na situation from which they could hardly escape. However,\nthe majority of participants (n = 8) did not consider early\nmotherhood as a source of adversity in, and of, itself. For\nsome, it was simply the normal way of things, being the main\nmodel in their social and family environment. For others, it\nwas a response to a lack of career plans or academic goals, as\nit gave their life purpose. Pregnancy was also the result of\nnot knowing what lay ahead or an expression of a desire to\nlet life decide, as illustrated by Shany's comment:\nAt that time, I think it was really to give my life a certain\ndirection. It clearly was that. I've always loved children, but . . .\nit really was the idea that at last, I would do something with my\nlife. It was selfish, just to get me anchored somewhere. You have\na child, you don't have a choice but to become a mother. In a way,\nwe are proud to be mothers. It really was to find myself. (Shany)\nThe participants pointed out that maternity is not easy and\nthat it requires a lot of learning, but they did not necessarily\nlink these challenges to age. For example, during the on-site\nobservations, they often talked about their child's develop-\nment, how it was within normal expectations for a growing\nchild. Many of them pointed out that their child was\nfollowing a regular psychosocial and physical development\ntrend, meaning that they were doing their job correctly as\nmothers and were therefore not different from, or less com-\npetent than, older mothers. The participants also stated that\nwhat defines a good mother is not her age, but instead the\nskills and attitudes she deploys when caring for her child. In\nmany informal discussions during the on-site observations,\nthe participants talked about the inadequate parenting skills\nof older mothers that they knew. They also mentioned exam-\nples of young mothers with great parenting skills, the advan-\ntages of being younger for bonding with children and\nunderstanding them better, and so on. However, the two old-\nest participants, with longer delays between giving birth and\nbeing interviewed, presented early pregnancy as an adver-\nsity. Their comments about the role that young age played in\ntheir trajectory were more nuanced. For them, being a young\nfirst-time mother increased their vulnerability and made it\nmore difficult for them to leave their abusive partner and take\non single motherhood. Without exception, all the participants\nfelt that their intimate relationship constituted a source of\nadversity. Whether due to control, threats, fearful atmo-\nsphere, repeated absences, or physical abuse, they consid-\nered their relationship to be adverse and linked to negative\nimpacts on their lives and their maternal identity.\nProtective Processes\nAccording to Masten and Monn (2015), protective processes\nare factors that can be distinguished from promotive factors\nby their special role in facilitating adaptation in situations of\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the resilience pathway in a context of early pregnancy and intimate partner violence.\n6 SAGE Open\nadversity or crisis. Three main protective processes can be\ndrawn from the participants' accounts: (a) maternal identity\nand the creation of a bond with the child as a turning point,\n(b) taking an active stance to respond to victimization, and\n(c) proactivity and adjustment to maternity. Maternal identity\nconsolidation and creation of a bond with the child occur\nfirst, whereas the last two occur more or less simultaneously,\nand not necessarily in a defined order. In this perspective,\nidentity and bonding can be regarded as a turning point in the\nresilience pathway of young mothers who are victims of\nviolence.\nMaternal identity and the creation of a bond with their\nchild. Pregnancy and childbirth changed the life trajectory of\nthe participants. Some tried to change their lifestyle and situ-\nation as soon as they knew they were pregnant. For others,\nchanges came when the baby arrived. Maternity brought an\nawareness of the impact of all their actions and decisions on\nanother person's life. As one participant stated, \"When your\nbaby arrives, I don't know, you feel more mature, more\nresponsible. You have someone to care for. You can't leave\nhim there and go to Timbuktu.\"\nThe interviews indicated that confirmation of pregnancy\nplanted the seeds for change and that the birth of the child\ncombined with the creation of a bond with that child consoli-\ndated the desire to improve the situation. Whereas the time\nrequired to create an affective bond with the baby differed\nacross participants, the analysis results showed that the\nawareness of that special bond motivated them to mobilize\nthemselves, take on a positive parental role, and establish a\nviolence-free environment. The affective attachment to their\nbaby seemed to be based in part on their recognition of the\nchild's needs and of their own physical and emotional capac-\nities to meet those needs. As such, their maternal identity, in\nthe sense of the generated purpose and value, became central\nto their self-representation.\nSetting limits:Taking an active stance within an adverse relation-\nship. These resilient women were aware of the negative con-\nsequences of their romantic relationship: They knew that\ncertain aspects could cause harm, to either themselves or\ntheir child. Impelled by this awareness, they used strategies\nthat enabled them to meet their need for a safer environment\nin which they could raise their child. Although not all of\nthem used the word \"violent\" to describe their relationship,\nthe descriptions were unambiguous:\nSo he tried to hit me but hit the wall besides me instead.\nAfterwards, he took his steel cap boot and knocked my friend\nover. He was . . . for him, there was nothing wrong in the way he\nwas behaving. . . . He didn't hit me afterwards, but you know the\nsigns were there. I was now dumb, couldn't do anything right,\ndidn't know how to take care of my baby, I was incapable of\ncleaning the house . . . Suppers, they were never good. (\u00c9lizabeth)\nHowever, the participants did not all react the same way\nto their relational situation. The analyses revealed four types\nof coping strategies: (a) defense strategies, (b) couples ther-\napy, (c) ultimatum linked to specific expectations, and (d)\nending the relationship. These strategies were neither mutu-\nally exclusive, nor were they necessarily implemented imme-\ndiately after the baby's birth. Concretely, some participants\n(n = 3) developed defense strategies to reduce the harm\ncaused by their partner and the relationship. One participant\nbegan therapy with her partner with the goal of developing a\nmore egalitarian, control-free relationship. Another gave her\npartner a firm ultimatum regarding his attitudes and behav-\niors: If he changed, and those changes were maintained over\ntime, they would pursue the relationship. Most participants\n(n = 6) chose to end the relationship:\nIt started like that; he called me names and put me down. Once\nagain, I froze and stayed inside for another whole month without\ngoing out or calling anyone. . . . I talked about it with X\n[counselor] and she was aware of the situation. She would come\nto my place for visits. She came for 3 or 4 months. And one day,\nI got up early in the morning, put all my belongings in a bag and\nleft. From one day to another. (\u00c9lizabeth)\nAll the participants' responses were characterized by major\nhesitation before ending the relationship for good. Indeed,\nthe analyses revealed much back and forth, which can be\nattributed to two main motivations. First, there was a shared\nperception that early motherhood is judged more negatively\nwhen the mother is a single parent. For a large portion of our\nsample, the mother's and spouse's identities had to be com-\nbined so that the early parenthood would have legitimacy\nand credibility. They felt more respected as a young mother\nwhen they were in a relationship with the child's father.\nTherefore, many participants chose to maintain their rela-\ntionship even if it was unsatisfactory or did not meet their\nexpectations. Similarly, most were strongly invested in the\ntwo-parent family ideal. All participants had a strong desire\nto form a united family, with the exception of one, who had\nwanted the father absent from their lives from the very begin-\nning of her pregnancy. The second motivation for pursuing\nthe relationship was a desire to maintain a united family for\nthe sake of the child's well-being. Another common element\nfor many was the guilt they felt about their decision to split\nup the family, which consequently deprived their child of his\nor her father's daily presence. (For a more detailed descrip-\ntion of the challenges that IPV imposes on early motherhood,\nBecause for me not having a father growing up, I so wanted my\ndaughter to have a father by her side. I really wanted him to play\nthe part, to be a dad. . . . In my head, it was always with the idea\nthat my two daughters would have their father. Mommy and\ndaddy in the same house. I tried until the end. Until the end, I\nkept trying. (Shany)\nL\u00e9vesque and Chamberland 7\nI was more . . . cause I felt I had to be a family. In my family's\neyes, for my son. And for J, cause that's what he wanted. I just\ndid it for those reasons. (Louise)\nProactivity and adjustment to maternity.Incidentally, becom-\ning a mother brings many other major changes to a teenag-\ner's life. One of the most significant may be the transition\nfrom the \"I rely on someone\" to \"someone relies on me\" sta-\ntus. When pregnancy was confirmed, the participants were\nnot financially, materially, or personally prepared for parent-\nhood. However, the interview analysis shows that they mobi-\nlized their external resources proactively and searched for\nnew ones to help them overcome obstacles that they might\nencounter when they became mothers. As one participant\nputs it,\nYou have a goal; you're going to find what you need to achieve\nit. You can do it; you've taken the trouble to find the resources\nyou need. To accomplish your goal. But it's . . . going out and\nfinding the resources. (Mimi)\nThese resources varied across participants and could include\nfinancial resources or material goods to prepare for the\nbaby's arrival, information and education about parenting,\nhousing information, referral or access to public or coopera-\ntive housing or a more suitable apartment, educational and\nprofessional counseling, and ways to break social isolation\nand meet other new mothers. Family and social surroundings\nwere important resources for the participants. Even if their\nfamily was not always supportive of the pregnancy at the\nbeginning, they provided much-needed help when the baby\narrived.\nMy mother helped me leave. She's the one who found the\napartment. If I hadn't found a landlord who helped me find\nfurniture in the first two weeks, and if I hadn't found a person at\nthe health center who was really concerned about my case, . . .\nI'm not sure I would've been able to get through it all.\n(Marie-Sophie)\nThis mobilization was driven by their desire to create a\nlife setting that was better suited for maternity. Furthermore,\nthe participants underscored the importance of establishing a\nlife situation that was better suited for maternity and of creat-\ning an enjoyable life for their child. When asked about their\nmotivations to make changes to their lives, the majority\ntalked about their child's well-being and taking responsibil-\nity for their children. As Shany puts it, \"I want my daughters\nto be at peace, happy, and fulfilled. It's the only thing that I\nwant. It's by showing them, by doing it myself. By being a\nrole model for them.\" To create that life setting, many par-\nticipants had to end relationships with family, friends, and\ncolleagues that they felt were toxic and had to create new\nsocial networks with people who shared the same values or\nlifestyle. Others had to end a habit that was unsuitable for\nmaternity, such as drug or alcohol consumption. Many also\nhad to establish a healthier lifestyle, for example, with a\nmore regular schedule. Creating these healthy life settings\nrequired a capacity to discern what was adequate and what\nwas not. Their inner strength also helped them make choices\nand stay committed to them. As one participant explained,\nMe, I stood my ground until the end and got rid of the people\nwho were harmful for me. What good was it to have them around\nme? . . . I think it's normal that you do some \"cleaning-up\" of the\npeople around you. Not keep all your friends. . . . All the people\nwho were doing drugs for the kick and doing it every day, I\nflushed them out of my life. (Louise)\nPromotive Processes\nPromotive processes are factors and processes associated\nwith adaptive success, independent of risk or adversity expo-\nsure, in that an interaction with risk is not necessary. Using\nthe past to go forward by (re)investing skills and knowledge\ngained through previous experiences is a major process in the\nresilience pathway of the participants. As shown in Table 1,\nthe participants had experienced many adversities before\ngiving birth to their child. To overcome these previous expe-\nriences, they had to mobilize inner strength, draw on external\nresources, and make changes to central aspects of their lives.\nThey gained strength by going through these processes, nota-\nbly by acquiring knowledge and skills and reinvesting them\nto cope with new adversities. For example, for Shany, the\nvarious obstacles she encountered growing up gave her a\nstrong sense of self and an unwavering resolve. Aliz\u00e9e's life\nexperiences were more helpful than any school lessons:\nusing what she learned helped her avoid bad choices later on.\nBecause Marie-Sophie moved frequently as a child, she had\nto deal with family instability: These experiences enabled\nher to develop good adaptation skills. Meanwhile, Mimi\nspoke about her strong character, which helped her cope with\n\"what others think.\" Elizabeth, who as a child was aban-\ndoned by her parents, had struggled for several years to make\na living for herself and her younger sister. She developed\nautonomy, organization, and problem-solving skills, which\nshe identified as useful in her current situation. Faced with\nthe adversity of IPV, Elizabeth explained how she recalled\nactions and events from her past to help her in times of doubt:\nIt was hard. Yes. At the apartment, I kept saying to myself: have\nI done the right thing? I had a house, a backyard . . . But I had no\nfuture because I was constantly controlled. It's not normal to\nlive like that and I wasn't happy either. When I was in doubt, I\nwould tell myself that it will go away with time. But I know that\nI will overcome it, because I have been through it. . . . You know,\nI have overcome obstacles worse than what I have to go through\ntoday. (\u00c9lizabeth)\nAnother promotive process is the capacity to reflect on\nand recognize the positive effects of change. An important\nTable 1.
