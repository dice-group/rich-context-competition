However,\nthe numbers of women on which estimates in this younger age stratum are based is low, point-\ning to the need for more information about vertebral deformity during middle age.[8\u00ad13, 16]\nA better understanding of the prevalence of vertebral deformity in mid-life women is rele-\nvant to osteoporosis prevention efforts. Those with a prevalent deformity are about 5 times\nmore likely to sustain an incident deformity over the course of one year and are also at double\nthe risk of having other minimal-trauma fractures.[17] Asymptomatic vertebral deformities do\ncount as prior fragility fractures in the FRAX1 tool, the most commonly-used method of esti-\nmating absolute risk of future fractures (http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX). Vertebral deformities\nwere also enrollment criteria and a primary endpoint for most randomized trials of osteoporo-\nsis therapies. Because the majority of vertebral fractures are asymptomatic, there is a growing\ninterest in clinical use of vertebral morphometry assessment as part of DXA measurement to\nimprove fracture risk stratification.[6] However, the cost-effectivenessof such a screening\nstrategy depends on the prevalence of vertebral deformity in the population and the effective-\nness of the screening assessment tool.\nPrevalent and Incident Vertebral Deformity in Midlife Women\non the SWAN web site: http://www.swanstudy.org/\nswan-research/data-access/.\nFunding: The Study of Women's Health Across the\nNation (SWAN) has grant support from the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH), DHHS, through\nthe National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National\nInstitute of Nursing Research (NINR) and the NIH\nOffice of Research on Women's Health (ORWH)\nsolely the responsibility of the authors and does\nnot necessarily represent the official views of the\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nTo contribute to the scant knowledge of the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for verte-\nbral deformities in middle-aged women, and to gauge the performance of DXA-based VM\nscreening in large, community based sample, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation\n(SWAN) conducted a vertebral morphometrystudy, the primary aims of which were to: 1) esti-\nmate prevalence and incidence of vertebral deformities in the SWAN sample; 2) explore\nwhether prevalence and incidence varied by selected characteristics such as age or bone mineral\ndensity(BMD).\nMethods\nStudy sample\nThe study sample is derived from the bone study component of the Study Women's Health\nAcross the Nation (SWAN) [Fig 1]. The parent study, SWAN, is a multi-site, community-based,\nlongitudinal cohort study of the MT.[18] SWAN eligibility criteria were: age at cohort between\n42 and 52 years, intact uterus and at least one intact ovary, not using hormone therapy at the\nstart of SWAN, at least one menstrual period in the 3 months before screening, and self-identifi-\ncation as a member of one of 5 eligible ethnic/racialgroups. SWAN participants were enrolled at\n7 sites: Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Newark and Oakland (N = 3302). All\nsites enrolled White women; Boston, Chicago, Detroit, and Pittsburgh enrolled Black women\nand the remaining 3 sites enrolled Japanese, Hispanic and Chinese women, respectively. The\nSWAN bone study took place at 5 sites (Chicago and Newark did not participate); thus, the maxi-\nmum number of potential enrollees in the bone study was 2413. Of these, 2365 women enrolled\nand 1430 remained in the bone cohort at SWAN follow-up visit 8, when the vertebral morphom-\netry initial assessment began. We acquired initial (prevalent) vertebral morphometrymeasure-\nobtained over the course of 4 calendar years, all were baseline vertebral morphometryscans. To\nassess incidence, we acquired a second vertebral morphometryscan during SWAN follow-up\nments (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA). During visits 8 through 10, 1446 women had an initial,\nusable, vertebral morphometryscan; this is the cross-sectionalsample. Of the baseline sample,\n1108 (76%) had a usable follow-up exam; these women comprise the longitudinal sample.\nOutcome\nLateral vertebral morphometryscans were read by a single expert research radiologist based at\nSynarc, Inc., using the Genant semi-quantitative method (Synarc, Inc., San Francisco, CA).[5,19]\nStarting with T4 and proceeding to L4, the radiologist first assessed whether each vertebral level\nwas evaluable; for evaluable levels, she assigned each level a semi-quantitative fracture grade (SQ\nGrade); SQ grade is done by visual inspection,without direct vertebral measurement. Grade 0 is\nnormal, no deformity. Grade 1 is mildly deformed (approximately 20\u00ad25% reduction in anterior,\nmiddle, and/or posterior height and a reduction of area 10\u00ad20%). Grade 2 is moderately deformed\nseverely deformed (approximately 40% reduction in any height and area). If a given vertebral\nlevel could not be evaluated, the radiologist reported the reason(s) such as: level not in scan, poor\nsignal to noise ratio or overlying ribs (more than one reason could be cited for each level).\nParticipant Characteristics\nStandardized questionnaires assessed the following characteristics, of interest: age (years), edu-\ncation level (less than high school [HS], HS, more than HS, college, or more than college), self-\nPrevalent and Incident Vertebral Deformity in Midlife Women\ndefined race (Black, Chinese, Japanese or White), menstrually-definedMT stage (premeno-\npausal [regular menses], early perimenopausal [menses within the prior 3 months but less pre-\ndictable], late perimenopausal [at least 3 months but less than 12 consecutive months of\namenorrhea], postmenopausal [12 or more months without menses]), surgically postmeno-\npausal [bilateral oophorectomy with our without hysterectomy prior to menopause], number\nof months since final menstrual period (FMP [postmenopausal women only]), current hor-\nmone therapy use (yes/no), or use of osteoporosis medication (yes/no). FMP date was the\nmonth and year at which 12 months of amenorrhea commenced or the date of surgery in\nthe case of surgical menopause. We measured weight (kilograms) and height (meters) using\ncalibrated scales and stadiometers; body mass index (BMI, [weight in kilograms/(height in\nmeters) 2]) was calculated. Because vertebral morphometry baseline years varied, we drew\ninformation about baseline characteristics from the SWAN visit at which the initial VM was\nFig 1. Baseline and follow-up sample derivation.\nPrevalent and Incident Vertebral Deformity in Midlife Women\ndone. We used each participant's initial spine and femoral neck BMD (i.e., first one done in\nSWAN) as the BMD exposures, to avoid false elevation of spine BMD values by vertebral defor-\nmity. To define never-users of major bone active medications (hormone therapy or osteoporo-\nsis medications) we considered all SWAN visits, from parent study baseline through the\nsecond VM ascertainment visit.\nData Analysis\nWe computed the number of evaluable vertebral bodies at each spinal level. We employed sim-\nple linear regression to test whether the number of spinal levels visualized varied by BMI. Base-\nline frequencies of vertebral deformities were tabulated by spinal level and by deformity grade;\nun-evaluable levels were coded as no deformity present. We calculated the prevalence of any\nvertebral deformity (SQ grade ! 1) as a proportion ([number of participants with any defor-\nmity/ baseline sample size]\u00c3100); 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were computed. We estimated\nprevalence for the entire sample and stratified by selected participant characteristics. For bivar-\niate analyses, tertile cut-points for BMI and BMD were defined separately for each racial group\nbecause distributions of these characteristics differ greatly by ethnic/racial group.[20] Preva-\nlence estimates by the presence or absence of each characteristic were compared using Chi-\nsquare test or Fisher's exact test. We calculated incident deformity (any increase in SQ grade)\nper person year (PY) of observation,standardized to 1000 person-years; we also computed\nincidence rates stratified by age at baseline <55 years or !55 years. Among participants who\nexperienceda deformity, the exact date of deformity occurrence was unknowable; we therefore\ncensored their person-time at the midpoint of their observation period. We constructed multi-\nvariable regression models to examine the relations between prevalent deformity and BMD,\nrace, age, BMI, and MT stage; covariates were included a priori based on prior literature.\n[1,2,21] We ran separate models for spine and femoral neck BMD. All analyses were done\nusing SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). P values less than or equal to 0.05 were consid-\nered statistically significant; we did not adjust for multiple comparisons.\nResults\nnese and 684 White. At baseline, mean age was 54 years (standard deviation, [SD] 2.7 years)\nand average BMI was 28 kg/m2 (SD, 6.8 kg/m2). The percentages of women who were premen-\nopausal, early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, naturally menopausal, or surgically\npostmenopausal were 1%, 15%, 9%, 64%, and 8% respectively;3% of the sample had an unde-\nterminable menopause stage. At vertebral morphometry baseline, 10% of women were using\nhormone therapy and 6% were taking a prescription medication for osteoporosis. Since the\nbeginning of SWAN, 39% had ever used hormones and 8% had ever used osteoporosis medica-\ntions; 5% of women had ever used both hormones and osteoporosis medications.\nAs expected, the most cranial portion of the VM image produced the lowest proportions of\nreadable vertebrae: considering levels T4 through T6, between 43% and 63% of vertebral bodies\ncould be evaluated [Table 1]. The commonest reasons for unreadable levels were: level not in\nscan, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and overlying ribs (data not shown). A greater amount of soft\ntissue thickness deteriorates signal-to-noise ratio; congruently, simple linear regression demon-\nstrated that greater BMI was associated with lesser number of readable vertebral levels (B =\npants had 2 deformities and 1 had 3 deformities [Table 1]. Two-thirds of the deformities were\nGrade 1. The vertebral levels most affected by prevalent deformities were T11 through L2.\nPrevalent and Incident Vertebral Deformity in Midlife Women\nIn the entire vertebral morphometry baseline sample of 1446 women, there were 46 with a\nvertebral deformity, resulting in a prevalence of 3.2% (95% CI, 2.3, 4.1). In the age range repre-\nsented (49\u00ad62), prevalence estimates did not vary significantly by age greater than or less than\n55 years (prevalence estimates 3.3% and 3.0%, respectively, p = 0.81).Bivariate analyses of char-\nacteristics potentially associated with prevalent deformity were restricted to the sub-sample of\n824 women who had not taken bone active medications since SWAN baseline (hormone ther-\napy and/or osteoporosis treatments). There were 27 women with a prevalent deformity in this\nsub-group [Table 2]. There was a trend towards greater prevalence with older age (p = 0.06)\nand longer time since FMP (0.09). Vertebral deformity also appeared to be least prevalent in\nBlack women, but there was not a statistically significant difference in prevalence among racial\ngroups (p = 0.63). In bivariate analyses, other characteristics examined were not statistically\nsignificantly related to prevalence of deformity.\nThe relations between prevalent deformity and BMD, race, age, BMI, and MT stage were\nexamined in multivariable analyses; separate models used LS BMD [Table 3] or FN BMD\n[Table 4] as predictors. LS BMD was strongly, independently, related to prevalent deformity:\nthe relative odds of deformity increased by 61% per SD decrement in SWAN baseline BMD\n(p = 0.02). We also observedan age effect, with the relative odds of deformity increasing by\n21% per year increment in age (p = 0.02). The model using FN BMD as the bone density expo-\nsure revealed results similar to those of the LS model. There was a higher prevalence of defor-\nmity in relation to lower FN BMD; for each standard deviation decrement in FN BMD, the\nrelative odds of deformity were 67% higher (p = 0.04). And, the relative odds of deformity\nclimbed by 20% per greater year of age (p = 0.02). In both models, greater BMI was marginally\nstatistically significantly associated with higher odds of deformity, with a relative increase of\n5% per standard deviation increment in BMI (p = 0.06 in FN model).\nTable 1.

In SWAN, DXA's ability to successfully image cranial-most vertebral levels proved lim-\nited: between 40% and 60% of vertebral bodies were unreadable as vertebral levels ascended\nfrom T6 to T4. With greater BMI, the number of readable vertebrae diminished.\nIn multivariable analyses, for each year increment in age, the relative odds of fracture\nincreased by 20% and each standard deviation decrement in LS or FN BMD was associated\nwith a relative increment in the odds of vertebral deformity of 60% and 67%, respectively. Each\nstandard deviation increment in BMI was marginally statistically associated with a relative\nincrease in the odds of deformity of 5%. The rarity of incident deformities in this sample pre-\ncluded analysis of their risk factors.\nTable 3.

Because we used DXA, vertebral deformity in this study is likely underestimated,\nparticularly grade 1 (which constituted about 2/3 of the deformities in SWAN) and those\noccurringin the more cranial thoracic levels. A validation study in 161 postmenopausal\nwomen that compared deformity readings using Hologic 4500A DXA technology to radio-\ngraphs (the gold standard) reported that DXA was 68% sensitive to the presence of any defor-\nmity and that sensitivity rose to 77% when only deformities of grade 2 or more were\nconsidered.[22] False negative vertebral morphometry readings using DXA are partly attribut-\nable to difficulty visualizing levels above T7: in the same validation, adequate visualization\nthrough T4 was only achievable in 71% of cases, whereas in 96% of instances levels up to T7\nwere well-imaged. Of vertebral deformities diagnosed by radiographs, 11% were in levels not\nascertainedby DXA.[22] To our knowledge, SWAN is the first large, longitudinal US cohort to\nuse DXA for vertebral morphometry readings and only one of three cohort studies to have\ndone so.[8,12] Of the other two, the Japanese Population-based Osteoporosis (JPOS) Cohort\nStudy did not report the frequency of unreadable levels while the Troms\u00f8 Study successfully\nimaged greater than 95% of vertebral bodies at all levels except for the most cranial, T4, which\nhad an 81% readability rate.[8,12] Tromso study's high imaging success rate compared to\nSWAN's may reflect Troms\u00f8's average BMI, which was one unit lower than that of SWAN.\nThus, there is a trade-off between DXA's attributes for epidemiologicalstudies (low cost, high\naccessibility, low radiation and, consequently, the capacity for repeated examinations) vs. its\nlower imaging success rate and sensitivity when compared with X-rays. Whether other large\nstudies' experiences with DXA VM assessment will be more like SWAN's or Troms\u00f8's awaits\nelucidation.\nTable 4.

Prevalence estimates in the 50\u00ad59 year old age category ranged from 2.7% to approx-\nimately 12% but most samples sizes in this age stratum were between 100 and 200 in size.\n[8,11,23] Table 5 also illustrates that deformity prevalence is sensitive to the reading method:\nin 2 studies that read radiographs using 2 distinct methods, the Eastell criteria resulted in 50 to\n100 percent higher values than did the Black or the McCloskey criteria.[11,24]\nIn the models that examined the relations between LS or FN BMD to deformities, we found\nthat lesser LS and FN BMD were independently, statistically significantly associated with\ngreater risk of prevalent deformity. The similarity of risk gradients evident at the spine and hip\nsites may appear to contradict prior work that finds a substantively lower gradient of fracture\nrisk conferred by spine compared to hip bone density.[25] However, LS BMD in our middle-\naged sample is likely to be less confounded by the age-related, pervasive degenerative disease\nartifacts that degrade our ability to read a true BMD signal.[26\u00ad28] We previously reported\nthat LS but not FN BMD predicted fracture during the menopausal transition.[29]\nThat higher BMI is related to slightly greater risk of prevalent deformity may at first seem\ncounterintuitive, as greater BMI is generally regarded as fracture-preventive due to its associa-\ntion with higher BMD.[30\u00ad32] However, when viewed from an integrated bone strength per-\nspective, there is a pleiotropic effect of obesity: greater BMI increases BMD but not enough to\ncompensate for the increased load on the bone.[33] Thus, adjustment for BMD (the protection\npathway) exposes the deleterious pathway from BMI to vertebral deformity (which is likely to\nbe related to the increased load); additionally, this effect is likely underestimated, because\nhigher BMI resulted in fewer number of readable vertebral levels and likely a systematic under-\nestimation of deformities.\nThe principal strengths of this study consist of its sample size of 1446 mid-life women,\nincluding women of 4 races; to our knowledge this the first vertebral deformity study with\nthese attributes. Our large sample allowed SWAN to: 1) estimate prevalent vertebral deformity\nin women aged 50\u00ad60 years (prior studies, reviewed in Table 5, had smaller samples in this age\nrange and either did not calculate CI's or had broader ones); and 2) to examine risk factors for\nfracture in this young age range. This study augments the research community's relatively lim-\nited experience using DXA-based vertebral morphometry in a large cohort.[8,12] We used\nBMD values from the initial SWAN scans; while this does not guarantee that spine BMD was\nnot falsely elevated by prevalent deformity or degenerative disease, it substantially reduces its\nlikelihood.One limitation of the SWAN vertebral morphometry study is sub-optimal ascer-\ntainment of cranial vertebral levels; however, this is expected constraint of the technique, as\nreported in the VM validation[19]. Nonetheless, we do not believe that there is a substantial\nnegative bias in our estimates of deformity because prevalence surveys, in which vertebral frac-\ntures were measured by standard x-rays, report that fractures at the levels of T4, T5 and T6 are\nvery rare. [9,10,12] A second limitation is the small number of prevalent and incident deformi-\nties, which constrain our ability to perform relational analysis of factors related to them; this\nlimitation is inherent in the age range of our sample. Our multivariable analyses could only be\ndone cross-sectionally, as there were too few incident deformities to support models.\nConclusion\nUsing DXA-based vertebral morphometry, we found that the prevalence of vertebral deformity\nin women aged 50\u00ad60 years enrolled in SWAN was low, at 3.5%, and the majority of deformi-\nties were grade 1. In cross-sectional analyses, lower bone density at both the LS and FN was\nPrevalent and Incident Vertebral Deformity in Midlife Women\nTable 5.
