Whereas women's helping is\nmore often directed towards kin and friends, men are more generous in interactions with\nstrangers, for instance, in bystander helping, acts of public charity, and public good provision\ndifficult to explain with traditional evolutionary theories such as kin selection and reciprocal\npossibility that men's generosity serves as a signal to attract mates.\nThis hypothesis stems from an integration of costly signaling and sexual selection theory\n(Darwin, 1871; Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997). Costly signaling theory suggests that particular traits\nevolve because they convey useful information to others about an individual's qualities; the\ncostlier the trait, the more reliable the signal-- hence these traits are labeled as \"handicaps\"\n(Grafen, 1990). An example of a handicap might be public generosity as it provides important\ninformation to others about the individual's quality.\nShowing off\nSexual selection theory suggests that human males and females might differ in what\nevolved differences in parental investment (Bateman, 1948), men place more emphasis on\nfertility cues in choosing sexual mates (e.g., youthfulness, physical attractiveness), whereas\nwomen place a stronger emphasis on cues indicating the likely provision of resources and\nrelationship commitment (Buss, 1989; Kenrick and Keefe, 1992). If women are relatively more\nconcerned about these cues, this, in turn, selects for traits in men that convey these qualities to\nmembers of the opposite sex. Since females consider kindness and helpfulness important\nindicators of male attractiveness (Miller, 2007), we predict that men might strategically use a\npublic display of generosity to show off their quality as a potential mate.\nThis show-off hypothesis of male generosity is consistent with field data. For instance,\namong hunter-gatherer societies, men who regularly provide large animal meat have more sexual\npartners (Hawkes, 1993; Hawkes and Bliege Bird, 2002). It has been suggested, that in\nrestaurants, groups of men leave much better tips for waitresses than groups of women and men\non dates with women leave especially good tips (Miller, 2000). When in the presence of a\nfemale, men also donate more money to panhandlers (Goldberg, 1995), and act heroically to help\nstrangers in emergencies (Griskevicius et al., 2007; Latan\u00e9, 1970). Finally, recent data from wild\nchimpanzee populations suggest that males use food-sharing to show-off to sexually receptive\nCurrently, however, this hypothesis has not been tested with humans under carefully\ncontrolled experimental conditions. Hence, this research provides the first empirical\ndemonstration of the show off hypothesis of men's generosity as a mate signal. Men and women\nwere asked what percentage of earned money they would be willing to donate to charity whilst\nbeing observed by a confederate who is either a member of the same sex or opposite sex (we\nincluded a no observer condition as control). Our prediction is that compared to other conditions,\nonly men will increase generosity when being observed by an (attractive) member of the\nopposite sex.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Design\nNinety students (45 female, 45 male) with a mean age of 22 years were recruited via the\nuniversity research participation scheme at the University of Kent. Participants were tested\nindependently in experimental cubicles, each containing a desk, chair and computer. A 2 (sex) x\n3 (audience) between-subjects design was employed with participants randomly allocated to\nexperimental conditions. The dependent variable, altruism, was measured through the percentage\nof earned money participants donated to charity. We tested whether charity donations would\ndiffer between the sexes under three different audience conditions: whilst being observed by a\nconfederate who was either a member of the opposite sex or same sex as the participant (i.e., a\nno observer condition served as control). In the observer conditions, the confederate sat\napproximately three feet away from the participant in their cubicle where they could see both the\nparticipant and the computer screen, see figure 1.\nShowing off\nFigure 1. Example of observer participant set-up in the experimental cubical.\nObservers\nWe recruited a male and female confederate to assist with the experiment. To examine if\naltruism is a mate signal we required our confederates to be considered as potential mates,\ntherefore, we recruited two observers that were regarded as physically attractive. We advertised\nin the University of Kent's drama department for confederates to act as observers. Ten female\nand eight male Drama students replied and agreed to have their photograph taken and rated. On a\nscale from 1-6 (1 = not very attractive, 6 = very attractive), 10 male students rated the female\nphotographs and another 10 female students the male photographs. We recruited the female (M =\nfor the experiment.\nProcedure\nParticipants arrived at the experiment individually. They were asked to enter the cubical\n(a closed room containing two chairs, a desk and a computer) and to take a seat at the computer.\nIn the observer conditions, an observer was sitting in cubical as the participant entered and\nremained present throughout the experimental games and charity donation. The experimenter\ngave no explanation for the presence of the observer but stated that participants would be fully\ndebriefed at the end of the study. Participants were asked not to interact with the observer;\nshould they have any problems with the study they were asked to leave the cubical and find the\nexperimenter. Once the participant was seated, the experimenter gave them the opportunity to\nask any questions and checked that they were happy to continue. The experimenter then left the\ncubical and told the participant to follow on screen instructions at their own pace. On screen\nShowing off\ninstructions explained to participants that they were about to play a number of experimental\ngames in which they could earn up to \u00a324 (approximately US$48). Although financial\nconstraints meant that only six participants could receive the money earned throughout the\nexperiment, participants were aware that the money they were playing with was real, that they\ncould be one of the six people chosen at random and therefore the money they earned could be\ntheirs.\nOn completion of these games participants were asked if they would like to donate a\npercentage of their earnings to charity. Since the money participants chose to donate was earned\nrather than given to them free by the experimenter, any donations to charity were considered\ncostly. To control for differences in earnings, financial totals were not revealed to participants\nprior to the charity question. As some charities could appeal to some people more strongly than\nothers, the charity's name, NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; a\nUK child charity), was only revealed after they made a donation.\nAfter making their donation, in the observer conditions the on screen computer\ninstructions told the observer to leave the room. Participants were then asked several questions in\nprivate. In observer conditions questions included rating the sexual attractiveness of their\nobserver and their self-rated attractiveness on a scale from 1-7 (1 = not attractive at all; 7 =\nextremely attractive). In addition, participants were asked to state their sexual orientation.\nFinally, they were debriefed and dismissed. At the end of the study six people selected at random\nreceived the money that they earned throughout the experimental games minus the charity\ndonation; these charity donations were given to the NSPCC.\nResults\nTo test our hypothesis we compared the sex differences in charity contributions between\nthe opposite sex condition, the same sex condition and no observer condition. Because our\nhypothesis concerned altruism as heterosexual mate signal, participants who indicated\nthemselves to be homosexual (N = 5) were excluded from further data analyses.\nBoth males and females rated their opposite sex observer as highly attractive. On a scale\nfrom 1-7 (1 = not attractive at all; 7 = extremely attractive), males gave the opposite sex\nobserver (female) a mean attractive rating of 5.13 (SD = 1.13), whereas females gave the male\nAs predicted, we found that only men significantly differed in their charity contribution\nconsiderably more in the opposite sex condition (M = 57.00, SD = 28.83) than the no observer\nConversely, female contributions did not significantly vary across the three audience\nTo confirm this, a comparison of male and female donations shows that males were more\ngenerous than females in the presence of an opposite sex observer (Males M = 57.00, SD = 28.83\nShowing off\nfemale donations did not significantly differ in the same sex (Males: M = 28.67, SD = 28.06 vs.\n2 = .02. The means are displayed in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Comparing males and females donations to charity across the three observer\nconditions.\nAre these generous activities influenced by perceptions of sexual attractiveness? As\nexpected, we found a positive correlation between generosity and the perceived sexual\nattractiveness of the observer (1 = not attractive at all; 7 = extremely attractive) in the opposite\nsex condition and, importantly, only for male participants, r(15) = .46, p < .05, not for females,\nr(15) = .03, p = .46. In addition, we found a relationship between self rated attractiveness and\ndonation to charity for both men and women in the opposite sex condition. Men and women who\nself-rated their own attractiveness as average or lower (four or less on a rating scale from 1-7; 1\n= not attractive at all; 7 = extremely attractive) were considerably more generous than those who\nUnfortunately, the numbers per condition were too small to conduct any meaningful statistical\ntests.\nShowing off\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of the show off hypothesis\nfor men's generosity. Whereas female generosity was not influenced by the sex or presence of an\nobserver, male generosity was. Men acted more generously in the presence of an attractive\nmember of the opposite sex than in the presence of a same sex observer or no observer. In the\nopposite sex condition men donated over half (57%) of the earnings to charity. We interpret this\nas evidence that men's generosity may be a mating tactic. This interpretation is consistent with\nmany observed sex differences in human generosity. Whereas women are more helpful in caring\nand nurturing situations, men engage in more conspicuous helping acts, such as hunting,\nbystander helping, group defense, and public philanthropy (Hawkes, 1993; Kelly and Dunbar,\nand the larger the third-party benefits, the larger the potential audience for these signals (Bliege\nWhat exactly does male generosity signal? The literature has put forward two rival\nhypotheses (Kelly and Dunbar, 2001; Miller, 2000). The good gene hypothesis suggests that\nmen's generosity signals their underlying genetic qualities, whereas the caring hypothesis\nsuggests the willingness to share resources. Our findings suggest that men who consider\nthemselves physically less attractive are more generous. Perhaps, then, generosity is a mating\nstrategy for men who cannot offer traits signaling good gene quality such as physical\nattractiveness or bodily symmetry (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Waynforth and Dunbar,\n1995). That the same effect was also found for women suggests that more research is needed to\nexplain the relationship between own attractiveness and altruism in potential mate situations.\nWe should note a potential limitation of the experiment. Generosity was displayed\nthrough monetary contributions only and this was deemed suitable for a student sample for\nwhich money is a scarce resource. But do our findings generalize to other populations and other\nacts of helping? We think they do. Across human societies, very public acts of generosity, such\nas philanthropy, bystander intervention, and heroism at war, are primarily male activities (Miller,\n2000; Van Vugt et al., 2007). Anthropological studies have found numerous examples of male\ngenerosity to impress females such as big game hunting and feasting and there is some evidence\nthat such displays increase male reproductive success (Bliege Bird and Smith, 2005; Chagnon,\nThis experiment suggests that men may show off altruism as part of a mating strategy. It\nremains to be seen if and when women find altruistic men sexually more attractive.\nReferences\nBliege Bird, R., and Smith, E.A. (2005).
