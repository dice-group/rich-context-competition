    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn 1996, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated the development of the Medicare\nHealth Outcomes Survey (HOS). It is the first national survey to measure the quality of life and functional\nhealth status of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care. The program seeks to gather valid and\nreliable health status data in Medicare managed care for use in quality improvement activities, public\nreporting, plan accountability and improving health outcomes based on competition. The context that led\nto the development of the HOS was formed by the convergence of the following factors: 1) a recognized\nneed to monitor the performance of managed care plans, 2) technical expertise and advancement in the\nareas of quality measurement and health outcomes assessment, 3) the existence of a tested functional\nhealth status assessment tool (SF-36\u00ae)1, which was valid for an elderly population, 4) CMS leadership, and\n5) political interest in quality improvement.\nSince 1998, there have been six baseline surveys and four follow up surveys. CMS, working with its\npartners, performs the following tasks as part of the HOS program: 1) Supports the technical/scientific\ndevelopment of the HOS measure, 2) Certifies survey vendors, 3) Collects Health Plan Employer Data and\nInformation Set(HEDIS\u00ae)2 HOS data, 4) Cleans, scores, and disseminates annual rounds of HOS data,\npublic use files and reports to CMS, Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), Medicare+Choice\nOrganizations (M+COs), and other stakeholders, 5) Trains M+COs and QIOs in the use of functional\nstatus measures and best practices for improving care, 6) Provides technical assistance to CMS, QIOs,\nM+COs and other data users, and 7) Conducts analyses using HOS data to support CMS and HHS\npriorities.\nCMS has recently sponsored an evaluation of the HOS program, which will provide the information\nnecessary to enhance the future administration of the program. Information collected to date reveals that\nthe HOS program is a valuable tool that provides a rich set of data that is useful for quality monitoring and\nimprovement efforts. To enhance the future of the HOS program, many stakeholders recommend the\nimplementation of incentives to encourage the use of the data, while others identify the need to monitor\nthe health status of plan disenrollees.\nOverall, the HOS program represents an important vehicle for collecting outcomes data from Medicare\nbeneficiaries. The new Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (2003)\nmandates the collection and use of data for quality, outcomes measurement, program administration, and\nfacilitating consumer choice. Consequently, it is important that the HOS program effectively meet this\nmandate.\nThis article is available from: http://www.hqlo.com/content/2/1/33\n\u00a9 2004 Jones et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

At present, 5.3 mil-\nlion beneficiaries receive care in these settings, of whom\n4.6 million are enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans (since\nrenamed Medicare Advantage plans, effective January 1,\n2006). The number enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans\nrecent passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug,\nImprovement and Modernization Act [1]. Thus, an esti-\nmated 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will receive\ncare in managed care settings by 2010. The quality of care\nprovided in managed care settings is a critical and growing\nissue.\nA managed care organization's ability to provide quality\nhealth care is particularly important to the Medicare pro-\ngram. Medicare provides services to 34.6 million elderly\nand six million younger beneficiaries with disabilities [1].\nA substantial share of beneficiaries are poor, with 40 per-\ncent having incomes of 200 percent of the federal poverty\nlevel or lower. Chronic conditions are prevalent, with 57\npercent of non-institutionalized beneficiaries self report-\ning arthritis, 55 percent reporting hypertension and 37\npercent reporting heart disease [2]. More than one-third\nneed assistance with at least one activity of daily living [3],\nwhile 28 percent self reports their health status as fair or\npoor [2]. Thus, Medicare enrollees are often those vulner-\nable to problems with quality in managed care settings [4-\nCMS's current vision involves enhancing \"quality and effi-\nciency in an evolving health care system\" [8]. Some of\nCMS's specific goals include securing and enhancing\nhealth and satisfaction, creating a system of high quality\ncare, and providing guidance for the overall health care\nmarket to improve beneficiaries' health [8]. CMS has\nmade considerable progress in becoming a value-based\npurchaser of health care by pursuing high quality care for\nbeneficiaries at a reasonable cost. Value-based purchasing\nincludes several strategies directed at improving the qual-\nity of care, encouraging the efficient use of resources, and\nimproving information to beneficiaries to assist them in\nmaking choices. Performance measurement is a critical\ncomponent for all these purchasing strategies.\nIn 1996, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ini-\ntiated the Medicare HOS program. The Medicare HOS is a\nsurvey that measures a health plan's ability to maintain or\nimprove the physical and mental health of its Medicare\nbeneficiaries over time. It is the first national survey to\nmeasure the health related quality of life and functional\nhealth status of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in man-\naged care [9]. The HOS consists of the SF-36\u00ae, questions\nconcerning Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)3, chronic\nhealth conditions, demographics, and survey administra-\ntion. The use of the HOS to collect health outcomes data\nmirrors a national trend in quality improvement activities\nto utilize outcome-based measures of quality. The goal of\nthe HOS has been to gather valid and reliable health sta-\ntus data in Medicare managed care for use in quality\nimprovement activities, public reporting, plan accounta-\nbility and improving health outcomes based on competi-\ntion [10]. The HOS has the potential of becoming a model\nof government leadership in our nation's quest to\nimprove the quality of health care for all Americans.\nCMS has sponsored a program evaluation of the HOS, a\nCAHPS\u00ae-HOS Integration study, and analytical studies of\nthe HOS data. The results of these studies will provide\nCMS the information it needs to improve the future\nadministration of HOS. The current evaluation of HOS,\nwhich will conclude in Fall 2004, includes three compo-\nnents: 1) a description of the context of HOS develop-\nment, 2) an examination of the HOS instrument and\noperational protocols, and 3) an assessment of the policy\nissues concerning the utility of HOS data. The contextual\nanalysis presented here is one component of the total\nevaluation.\nThis paper explores the historical context that led to the\ndevelopment and implementation of the HOS program; it\nalso describes the HOS and examines its administration,\nits role and function within CMS, and the direction that\nthe program may take in the future. The information for\nthis paper was obtained through a review of the published\nhealth services literature, national reports, unpublished\nCMS documents and reports, and interviews with key\nCMS staff members (current and former), HOS partners,\nand Technical Expert Panel (TEP) members.\nBackground\nled to heightened interest in establishing effective mecha-\nnisms for measuring and, ultimately, ensuring quality in\nhealth care. Following Donabedian's widely recognized\nparadigm (1988), a variety of methods for defining and\nmeasuring health care quality have evolved [11]. From the\nuse of process and structural measures of care, to the use\nof more quality of life and functional health outcomes-\nbased measures, evaluators have sought to develop and\nimplement the most effective methods for assessing\nhealth care quality and performance.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nDuring the time of HOS development, there was an\nincreased interest in measuring outcomes of health care.\nThe use of outcome measures in quality improvement\nefforts stems, in part, from a desire to focus on the impact\nexperience of patients should be the ultimate source of\ndefining quality. Berwick views the purpose of the U.S.\nhealth care system as enhancing the functioning and\nhealth status of citizens by decreasing the burden resulting\nnotes that one of the motivations to pursue functional sta-\ntus assessment from the beginning was to try to inject\nawareness of outcomes into the medical system. There\nwas an interest in moving the focus from \"treating dis-\neases\" to \"treating patients. [14]\"\nTraditional health outcome measures have included phys-\niologic measures as well as mortality. More recently, a\nvariety of tools to measure additional dimensions of\nhealth and well being of importance to individuals have\nbeen developed [15][16]. As described by Bierman and\ncolleagues, \"health status measures assess the net effect of\none or all health problems and treatments on multiple\ndomains of health\" [15]. Those health status measures\nthat are generic should consider function across a number\nof domains as well as be applicable to various health\nCMS activities\nCMS like other large purchasers wanted to establish a\nmanner in which to measure the quality that managed\ncare organizations were providing their beneficiaries.\nAccording to the 1998 President's Advisory Commission\non Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care\nIndustry Report, a key element of improving health care\nquality is the Nation's ability to measure the quality of\ncare and provide easily understood, comparable informa-\ntion on the performance of the industry [17].\nMany process and clinical care performance measures\nexisted in the 1990s; however, noticeably lacking were\nappropriate measures of health outcomes. The Office of\nreleased reports encouraging CMS to adopt an outcomes-\nbased performance assessment model that emphasizes\nthe use of outcome-oriented performance data [18-20]. It\nwas felt that an emphasis on the use of outcomes-oriented\nperformance data would be consistent with the goals of\nvalue-based purchasing [21]. Stevic commented, \"In the\nhealth care industry, everyone was frustrated with meas-\nurement. We had been doing measurement for a long\ntime....we were doing a lot of process measures and no\none was satisfied that we had the right informa-\ntion....[22]\" According to Jencks, \"CMS needed to develop\nan appropriate health outcome measure because one did\nnot already exist and there was not likely to be one devel-\noped by someone other than CMS in the near term\" [23].\nIn 1996, CMS decided to partner with NCQA to develop a\nfunctional health status assessment tool to be used as a\nhealth plan performance measure for Medicare beneficiar-\nies. The Medicare HOS was created to provide health out-\ncomes data as a performance measure of Medicare\nmanaged care plans. To justify the emphasis on Medicare\nenrollees in managed care, NCQA representatives indi-\ncated that \"the focus has been on managed care because\nthe accountability movement started with managed care.\nManaged care was promoting itself as an accountable\nentity that would lead to better care outcomes and the\ngovernment wanted to show that managed care was valu-\nable..... Also, people thought managed care would grow in\nMedicare\" [9].\nAccording to Kang, functional health status was selected\nas CMS's outcome measure of choice because it was of\ngreatest interest to Medicare beneficiaries [24]. Paul stated\nthat \"the decision to use functional health status was the\nright one [25]. It reflects the agency's strategic objective of\nbeing patient-centered\" [25]. Additionally, there was evi-\ndence that complex issues such as chronic illness, co-mor-\nbidity, and functional impairment are particular\nproblems among the elderly and present distinct chal-\nlenges to this population. It was believed that a functional\nstatus measure was an important outcome of care, due to\nthe complexities involved in the health of older adults,\nand because of the growing concern about how managed\ncare would affect these conditions and this population's\nsubsequent functional status [15].\nHaffer maintains that, \"During the Clinton administra-\ntion, the agency thought of itself as a beneficiary-centered,\nvalue-based purchaser of services, and tried to do things to\nmeasure the value we [CMS] were getting for the services\nwe [CMS] were purchasing on behalf of the beneficiaries.\nThese performance measures filled a need because we\n[CMS] could now look at what we [CMS] were spending\nand compare plans based on standardized, scientifically\nsaid that quality of care is a complex concept and meas-\nures such as the HOS examine an important dimension of\nquality of care for Medicare beneficiaries [15].\nAlthough the planning and development of the HOS\ngave the HOS a clear mandate. Among its requirements\nwas the establishment of quality requirements for health\nplans enrolling Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\nAccording to the legislation, performance measurement\nreporting requirements for Medicare managed care are\nauthorized to promote quality improvement. Section\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n1851 (d) (4)(D)(iii) of Title XVIII of the Social Security\nAct (the Act) authorizes CMS to review the quality of care\nprovided to people with Medicare. Section 1876 (I) of the\nAct sets several criteria for managed care contracts. These\nstatutorily mandated provisions have been implemented\nmanaged care plan must have an effective procedure to\ndevelop, compile, evaluate, and report to CMS, to its\nenrollees, and to the general public, developments in the\nhealth status of its enrollees to the extent practical.\nCMS established a technical expert panel (TEP) to guide\nthe development, implementation and operations of the\nHOS [8]. The TEP recommended that the HOS become a\ncomponent of Medicare HEDIS\u00ae and that the SF-36\u00ae be\nused as the foundation of the measure. The SF-36\u00ae, a phys-\nical and mental health status measure, was used in the\nMedical Outcomes Study (MOS) [7] and has a history of\nuse in estimating relative disease burden for numerous\nconditions [27]. The SF-36\u00ae has been used in both specific\npopulations such as the elderly and disabled, as well as in\nthe general population [10]. ]. The tool has been used to\ndetermine the effectiveness of various treatments such as\nhip and knee replacement and heart valve surgery\n[28][29], as well as the burden of various illnesses such as\ncancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS on populations [27].\nCommenting on the reason the SF-36\u00ae was chosen for the\nHOS, Ware [30] noted that the SF-36\u00ae was the most widely\nused health status measure at the time [of HOS develop-\nment]...and was found to be reliable and valid for use\nwith the elderly and other demographic groups. The SF-\n36\u00ae had good psychometric properties and had been peer-\nreviewed. Additionally, both a user's manual and norma-\ntive SF-36\u00ae data were available.\nAlthough the most widely used generic health status\nmeasure at the time of developing the HOS instrument,\ndebate existed about its use with elderly individuals [31-\ntical and psychometric issues that can differentially affect\nthe performance of generic health status tools in cross-sec-\ntional and longitudinal studies of elderly persons, includ-\ning mode-of-administration effects, floor and ceiling\neffects, and score stability versus internal consistency\"\n[16]. Two additional issues are relevant for longitudinal\nstudies \u00ad selective mortality and proxy reports [16]. Beir-\nman and colleagues (2001) raise similar concerns related\nto administration and survey response [15]. For example,\nwhile the SF-36\u00ae takes approximately ten minutes to com-\nplete, it likely takes longer for participants with less than\na high school education [16], older participants [6] and\nparticipants with cognitive impairment [34]. However,\nthe previously mentioned issues are not specific to the SF-\n36\u00ae, and does not seem to rise to the level unacceptability\nissues will be important to address in the broader HOS\nevaluation, discussed below.\nThe HOS program\nCMS, responsible for leadership, oversight, coordination,\nand successful implementation of the national Medicare\nHOS Program (formerly the Health of Seniors Survey),\nformed partnerships with organizations that had skills\nand experience in the areas of health outcomes and per-\nformance measurement. The team of HOS partners and\ntechnical experts are described in Tables 1 and 2.\nThe instrument\nThe HOS is based on a longitudinal cohort research\ndesign, in which a baseline and 2-year follow-up surveys\nare administered to a sample of beneficiaries in each plan.\nThe survey is primarily a mailed questionnaire that is sent\nto selected participants, with a series of reminder post-\ncards and telephone interviews among non-respondents\nand incomplete survey respondents in efforts to increase\nthe survey response rate4. The HOS survey instrument\nconsists of three primary components: 1) the SF-36\u00ae, 2)\ncase-mix and risk-adjustment questions, and 3) demo-\ngraphic and other questions required by the 1997 Bal-\nanced Budget Act [9]. The SF-36\u00ae, as previously noted, is a\nmultipurpose short-form general health survey, which\nprovides eight scale scores of physical and mental health\nattributes, as well as two summary measures of physical\nand mental health status, the Physical Component Sum-\nmary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS),\nboth of which are weighted combinations of all eight scale\nThe responses to the SF-36\u00ae are scored as eight Likert\nscales, summarized using standard weights, and then\nnormed using 1998 US general population data to pro-\nduce the PCS and MCS scales (see both the SF-36\u00ae Health\nSurvey Manual and Interpretation Guide and SF-36\u00ae Phys-\nical and Mental Health Summary Scales: A Manual for\nUsers of Version 1 for details) [40][35]. Each beneficiary\nwho remains in the health plan in which he or she was\noriginally sampled is measured twice, at baseline and\nagain at follow-up; thus, the beneficiary serves as his/her\nown control. All respondents who die during the two-year\nfollow-up period also are included in the follow-up anal-\nysis. Because there are many differences among individual\nsurvey respondents based on age and initial health status,\nfor example, the mortality results and PCS and MCS two-\nyear change scores are risk-adjusted5. Thus, plan-to-plan\ncomparisons of health outcomes are adjusted for differ-\nences in case-mix, using available data on characteristics\nsuch as chronic conditions, age, ethnicity, gender, and\neducation, among others.

However, the effect of plan\nattrition over time on plan performance of remaining\nplans is unclear. Additionally, the majority of plans show\nno change in performance over the two year period,\nsuggesting that the SF-36\u00ae may not sufficiently discrimi-\nnate differences in plan performance.\nBecause of the HOS, QIOs and health plans have data that\nthey may use to identify opportunities to improve the\nquality of care provided to their Medicare populations. In\naddition, they are regularly provided information and\neducation on intervention strategies that may lead to\nmeasurable improvements in health care quality.\nHOS data are also used as part of CMS's Health Plan Man-\nagement System (HPMS), a system of process and out-\ncomes health plan performance measures. These\nmeasures are composite scores derived from HEDIS\u00ae,\nConsumer Assessment of Health Plans Study (CAHPS\u00ae),10\nHOS and disenrollment data, and are used by CMS to\nrank plans [36]. To develop a plan composite score, the\npercentile ranks for each reported HEDIS\u00ae, HOS, CAHPS\u00ae\nand disenrollment indicator are averaged. Those plans\ndeviating substantially from the mean are considered\neither high or low overall performers based on the\nnational comparison group. By comparing their compos-\nite scores against those of others on individual indicators,\nhealth care organizations are able to better assess how\nthey compare with a national sample of their peers. The\nformation of this scale may represent an interim step in\nthe development of a score card that could be used by\nCMS, managed care plans, and others to assess health\nplan performance.\nHOS data may facilitate identification of beneficiaries at\nrisk of declining physical and mental functioning. For\nexample, Bierman and Clancy (2001) identified chronic\nconditions that lead to poor physical functioning and\nmental functioning among elderly women in Medicare\nmanaged care plans using HOS data [37]. These condi-\ntions include, for example, arthritis, coronary artery dis-\nease, diabetes, and reported feelings of depression or\nsadness [37]. Using HOS data, they examined the extent\nto which women of lower socioeconomic status and/or\nracial/ethnic minorities were disproportionately affected\nby these conditions. They suggest that HOS data can assist\nin addressing these disparities.\nFurther, the HOS has provided CMS the ability to use\nhealth outcomes data for payment adjustments. CMS is\nnow using the ADL data from the HOS to calculate a\nfrailty adjustor to set payment for Social Health Mainte-\nnance Organizations. A variant of the HOS, the Program\nof All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) Health Survey,\nis being used to calculate a frailty adjustor for PACE plans\nand for demonstrations that target frail Medicare benefici-\nHOS data have also been used in research. To date, eleven\nresearch reports have been made available on the Medi-\ncare HOS website, covering topics such as how perform-\nance measurement results are calculated, and the health\nstatus of younger individuals with disabilities enrolled in\nM+C plans. These reports are available at http://\nwww.cms.hhs.gov/surveys/hos/hosresearch.asp. The HOS\nwebsite also includes a list of publications appearing in\nscientific journals.\nResearchers have used HOS data to examine the func-\ntional status of chronically ill Medicare managed care\nenrollees to assess the need for disease management pro-\ngrams. A study also reviewed the disease management\ndemonstration projects sponsored by CMS, and discussed\nhow such interventions may help enhance the functional\nstatus of chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries over time.\nThrough exploring the change in SF-36\u00ae scores over time,\nit has been found that the presence of chronic disease has\na negative impact on both physical and mental health of\nenrollees over a two year period [26].

However, once a disease has surfaced, there\nmust be interventions in place to manage the disease.\nResults from the HOS data indicate that opportunities\nexist to enhance health outcomes in this population [15].\nEfforts by CMS, such as the incorporation of guidelines\ninto HOS documents encouraging the use of evidence-\nbased interventions to prevent and manage chronic\nillness, convey CMS's goal of helping plans use HOS data\nto improve the health and functional status of enrollees\nThe HOS has also been used as a vehicle to explore emerg-\ning and/or geriatric quality care related health issues and\nconcerns. The HOS instruments have included questions\nconcerning health services utilization, retirement commu-\nnity living, smoking frequency and cessation, healthy\ndays, management of urinary incontinence, among others\n[10]. The healthy days questions from the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Sur-\nveillance System (BRFSS) were added to allow a link\nbetween HOS and BRFSS results, facilitating comparison\nacross federal initiatives. The management of urinary\nincontinence questions were added in 2003 as a new\nHEDIS\u00ae measure [10].\nMedicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and\nImprovement, and Modernization Act of 2003, provides\nHOS a clear mandate and focus. Specifically, Section 722\nspecifies requirements for CMS and Medicare Advantage\n(MA) organizations that must be undertaken to pursue\nquality health care for Medicare beneficiaries. Section 722\nrequires that each MA organization comply with the\nfollowing:\n1. Have an ongoing quality improvement program for the\npurpose of improving the care provided to enrollees in\neach MA plan offered by such organizations.\n2. Have a chronic care improvement program, which con-\nsist of having a method of monitoring and identifying\nenrollees with multiple or sufficiently severe chronic con-\nditions that meet established criteria.\n3. Provide for collection, analysis, and reporting of meas-\nures of health outcomes and other indices of quality [42].\nIt also requires CMS to establish appropriate regulatory\nrequirements for the following:\n1. The collection, analysis, and reporting of data that per-\nmits the measurement of health outcomes and other indi-\nces of quality for MA organizations; and,\n2. Dictates that no new quality, outcomes, and beneficiary\nsatisfaction data to facilitate consumer choice and pro-\ngram administration shall be collected that were not col-\nlected by CMS as of November 1, 2003. However, CMS\nmay only change the types of data that are required to be\nsubmitted by MA(s) after submitting to Congress a report\non the reasons for such changes that was prepared in\nconsultation with MA organizations and private accredit-\nThe HOS is now the only approved patient-based health\noutcomes measure for MA quality improvement and per-\nformance monitoring. In addition, HOS provides MA\norganizations data that they can use as a means of identi-\nfying and monitoring enrollees with chronic conditions as\npart of their chronic care quality improvement programs.\nUsing HOS data in this manner however, may be limited\nto some extent by the underlying sampling strategy, which\nwas designed as a simple random sample with each MA\norganization as the unit of analysis. Given the restriction\nimposed by the new legislation concerning the develop-\nment of new measures, HOS will likely be CMS's primary\nhealth outcomes measure of MA plans for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nConclusion\nArticles and studies published to date suggest that CMS's\nleadership and innovation with respect to the develop-\nment of the HOS represented an important initial step\ntoward the development of one major component of an\ninformation infrastructure needed to monitor and\nimprove the quality of health care. Now fully developed,\nHOS's data and administration are under study. Inter-\nviews with HOS partners and stakeholders have revealed\nthat the majority feel that the HOS provides a rich and\nunique set of valid, reliable, and actionable data. How-\never, interviewees have offered some additional recom-\nmendations to improve the HOS, which include: 1)\ntracking the health status of plan disenrollees, and 2) cre-\nating greater incentives for plans and QIOs to use the HOS\ndata.\nCMS values programs and measurement tools that facili-\ntate improvements in health care for its beneficiaries. The\nMedicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Moderni-\nzation Act of 2003 mandate the measurement of health\noutcomes and restrict the development of new measures.\nConsequently, HOS is CMS's primary vehicle to collect\noutcomes data, particularly patient-based functional\nhealth status measures. The evaluation of the efficacy of\nthe HOS program will provide CMS with essential infor-\nmation to improve the HOS and to determine the best\nway for HOS to effectively meet this new legislative\nmandate.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nEndnote\n1.
