Environmental Influences\nPurpose: Rising rates of physical inactivity and obesity in the United States highlight the critical need to identify contexts and settings\nthat are conducive to the promotion of recreational physical activity. The current study investigated whether the intensity and duration\nof sports and exercise bouts differ across physical and social environments as reported in a nationally representative time use survey of\nU.S. adults. Methods: From the American Time Use Survey (years 2003\u00ad2006), adult participants (ages Q21 yr) who reported at least\none bout of sports or exercise on the previous day were selected (N = 7700). For each exercise bout, respondents reported the activity\ntype, its duration (in minutes), its location (e.g., outdoors, home, work, health club/gym), and with whom it occurred (e.g., alone, family\nmembers, coworkers, friends/acquaintances). Sample-weighted logistic and linear regression analyses examined differences in intensity\nexpressed as METs (moderate, 3.0\u00ad6.0 METs; vigorous, 96.0 METs) and in duration of exercise bouts across environments. Results:\nVigorous-intensity exercise was more likely when the bout occurred alone as compared with other social situations (P values G 0.001)\nand when at a gym/health club and at home as compared with outdoors (P values G 0.001). For both moderate and vigorous activities,\nexercise bouts were shorter when exercising alone versus with family members, friends/acquaintances, or multiple categories (P values G\n0.001). Mean duration of exercise bouts was greater when exercising outdoors than when exercising at home, work, or at gym/health\nclub (P values G 0.001). Conclusions: Nationally representative time use data for U.S. adults suggest that the intensity and duration of\nexercise bouts are differentially affected by social contexts and physical settings.

For example, a\nhome-based exercise program for obese women had a\ngreater impact on long-term exercise participation, adher-\nence, and weight loss compared with a group-based\nprogram held at a clinic facility (25). Also, older adults\nparticipating in an overground walking training program\nhad more favorable attitudes and found exercise more\nenjoyable compared with a treadmill training group (21). In\na study using experience sampling, children reported more\nintense physical activity when they were with their peers\nand close friends (30). Research comparing self-selected\nactivity intensities of various tasks found differences\nbetween home and laboratory settings (44). Taken together,\nthis evidence suggests that physical activity performance\nvaries across contexts. However, the ability to draw\nmeaningful conclusions from this research is limited by\nthe focus on only a small number of settings and use of\nnonrepresentative samples.\nTime use studies offer a novel approach to overcoming\nchallenges associated with studying the effects of different\nenvironments on physical activity. Time use surveys\nsequentially assess the type and duration of all activities\nthat a person performs across the day (using diary or short-\nterm recall) and are commonly used by sociologists and\neconomists to describe human behavior patterns (5,18,32).\nAn advantage of time use survey methodology is that\nexposure to and use of environments can be temporally\nlinked to specific behaviors (i.e., the interview assesses\nwhere and with whom behavior occurs throughout the day).\nThe American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which uses a\nnationally representative U.S. sample, has been recently\nused to study walking behaviors (37) and demographic and\ntemporal patterns in the use of social and physical environ-\nments for sports and exercise (12).\nThe current study used data from the ATUS to examine\nwhether the intensity and duration of sports and exercise\nbouts performed by U.S. adults differ across social and\nphysical environments. Several hypotheses were tested.\nFirst, on the basis of the evidence showing a favorable\nimpact of social interactions on physical activity intensity\n(30) and adherence (9), it was hypothesized that the\nintensity and duration of exercise bouts occurring with\nfriends/acquaintances, family members, or coworkers would\nbe greater than exercise occurring alone. Second, prior\nresearch suggests that people often prefer to exercise\noutdoors (42) and that there is a positive association\nbetween time spent outdoors and overall physical activity\nlevel (21). Therefore, it was hypothesized that outdoor\nenvironments would have a favorable impact on exercise\nperformance. We expected that exercise occurring outdoors\nwould be greater in intensity and duration than exercise\noccurring in any other physical environments. We took an\nexploratory approach to comparing exercise intensity and\nduration among bouts performed with family, friends/\nacquaintances, and coworkers as well as among bouts\nperformed at home, at work, and at a gym/health club,\nmainly due to a lack of prior research on these contexts.\nMETHODS\nATUS procedures. The ATUS is sponsored by the\nBureau of Labor and Statistics and conducted by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau (http://www.bls.gov/tus/). It uses a strati-\nfied, three-stage survey design to measure time use patterns\nin a nationally representative sample of individuals (ages 15\nyr and older). To obtain reliable estimates and adequate\nsample size, the survey oversampled weekend days and\nsome demographic groups (e.g., households with Hispanics\nor non-Hispanic Blacks, households with children). Within\neach selected household, a telephone interview was\nconducted with a single randomly chosen individual to\nassess time use on the previous day. The reporting day was\nrandomly preassigned to the household. To encourage\nhouseholds without a telephone to call to complete the\nsurvey, they received a $40 debit card in the mail. The\nATUS, which is collected through the Census Bureau, does\nnot release identifiable participant information to the public\nand is not subject to institutional review board approval.\nAuthorization to collect the ATUS is granted by the U.S.\nOffice of Management and Budget.\nTrained ATUS interviewers used a Computer-Assisted\nTelephone Interviewing system to pose a series of stan-\ndardized questions designed to lead the respondent through\nthe recall of the previous day. Respondents were asked to\nsequentially describe each activity and its duration for the\n24-h period beginning at 4:00 a.m. Follow-up questions\nassessed where and with whom each activity occurred. Each\ninterview lasted approximately 15 to 20 min.\nStudy sample. To obtain reliable estimates of activity\nacross different times of the day and days of the week, data\nstudy. Only respondents aged Q21 yr and reporting at least\none bout of sports or exercise were included in the analyses.\nData treatment. ATUS interviewers at the telephone\ncenter assigned a six-digit classification code to each\nactivity (31). The present study focused on activities coded\nas participating in sports, exercise, or recreation (General\nActivity Category) within sports, exercise, and recreation\n(Major Activity Category). Walking (for exercise) and\nhiking fell into this categorization scheme. Other walking\nor biking activities coded under traveling (General Activity\nCategory), household, nonhousehold (Major Activity Cate-\ngory), or volunteer activities (Major Activity Category)\nwere not examined in this study. Likewise, moderate-\nintensity physical activities performed for nonrecreational\npurposes (e.g., transportation, occupation, household\nchores) were not included in these analyses.\nENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EXERCISE Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.\nActivity intensity expressed in METs was calculated\nusing a scheme that links the ATUS variables to the\nCompendium of Physical Activities (1,38) (http://riskfactor.\ncancer.gov/tools/atus-met/). Activity intensity levels were\nbased on classifications used by the CDC/ACSM (25)\nFollow-up interview questions assessed the social and\nphysical environments of each activity. After the activity\nwas reported, respondents were asked, ``Who was with you/\nWho accompanied you?'' Interviewers coded responses into\n22 different categories. Responses were given more than\none category code if a heterogeneous group was reported.\nBefore data analyses, this variable was recoded into four\ngeneral categories representing the overarching type of\nsocial companion: Alone, Family (e.g., household children,\nparents, siblings), Friends/Acquaintances (e.g., friends,\nneighbors, acquaintances, other nonhousehold children, other\nnonhousehold adults), and Coworkers. A fifth general\nsubgroup called Multiple categories was created, which\nencompassed responses reporting social companions from\nmore than one of the other four general categories.\nTo assess the physical environment of the activity,\nrespondents were asked, ``Where were you while you were\n[activity]?'' The responses were coded by the interviewers\ninto 26 different categories including travel modes. Before\ndata analyses, less common locations for exercise, such as\nsomeone else's house, school, and place of worship, as well\nas locations coded as other place and unspecified place,\nwere combined to create an overall Other/unspecified\ncategory. Exercise and sports reported in unusual or\nillogical locations (e.g., grocery store, library, restaurant/\nbar, bank) (G3%) and sedentary travel modes (e.g., car/\ntruck/motorcycle, bus, subway/train, boat/ferry, other mode\nof transportation, unspecified mode of transportation)\n(G2%) were not included in the analyses. Therefore, the\nresulting physical environment variable consisted of five\nlevels: Outdoors, Home, Work, Gym/health club, and\nOther/unspecified.\nTemporal and demographic variables were also recoded.\nBefore data analyses, a season variable was created by\nrecoding the interview date as follows: fall (September 21\nSeptember 20), and target days were coded as weekday or\nweekend day. Each activity was coded for the time of day\ncompleted was recoded into the following categories: less\nthan high school, high school graduate, some college,\ngraduate of 4-yr college or greater. Race/ethnicity was\nrecoded as non-Hispanic white only, non-Hispanic black\nonly, Hispanic only/Hispanic mixed, Asian/Pacific Islander\nonly, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and non-Hispanic\nmixed.\nStatistical analyses. Because of the complex sam-\npling design of the ATUS, statistical analyses were\nconducted using SUDAAN 9.0 (RTI International, Re-\nsearch Triangle Park, NC). ATUS sample weights were\napplied to all statistical analyses to reduce bias in producing\nU.S. population estimates as a result of differential\nsampling and response rates across subpopulations and\ndays of the week. For all analyses, the Fay replicate weight\nmethod was used to estimate SE that accounted for the\ncomplex sample design (41). This method for variance\nestimation used replicate weights provided by survey\nadministrators of the ATUS, with an adjustment factor that\nwas set to Fayadj\n= 0.3. Sample weights across the years\nanalyses accounted for nonindependence of observations\nfor individuals reporting more than one exercise bout per\nday through the replicate weight method of variance\nSample-weighted estimates for the proportion of sports\nand exercise bouts that were of moderate and vigorous\nintensity were generated. Logistic regression analyses were\nsubsequently used to test whether the type of social and\nphysical environment predicted the likelihood that a sport or\nexercise bout was of vigorous (compared with moderate)\nintensity. Multiple regression analyses were used to es-\ntimate whether bout duration (in minutes) differed by type\nof social and physical environment. For the logistic and\nmultiple regression models testing social environments,\nalone was designated as the reference group. Planned\ncontrasts comparing family members, coworkers, and\nfriends/acquaintances were tested using the ``Effects''\nstatement. Outdoors was designated the reference group\nfor the models testing physical environments. Differences in\nsports and exercise intensity and duration among the home,\nwork, and gym/health club were tested with planned\ncontrasts. The multiple regression analyses testing differ-\nences in the duration of sports and exercise bouts examined\nmoderate- and vigorous-intensity activities separately. All\nof the models adjusted for sex, age, education level, and\nrace/ethnicity. Temporal variables such as season, day of\nthe week, and time of day were also statistically controlled\nbecause they could hypothetically influence both the\nenvironment in which a behavior is performed and the\nintensity and duration of that behavior. Predicted marginal\nproportions (for dichotomous outcomes [moderate vs\nvigorous intensity]) and predicted marginal means (for\ncontinuous outcomes [minutes]) were calculated from the\nlogistic and multiple regressions, respectively. These pre-\ndictions are standardized values that adjust for all of the\nother covariates in the model (19).\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics.

Time use data offer a\nnovel research strategy to examine context-specific exercise\nbehaviors. Results showed that social company and phys-\nical location were differentially associated with exercise\nintensity and duration. These findings contribute to a\ngrowing body of work examining the role that social\ncontexts and physical settings may play in shaping exercise\nbehaviors.\nResults from the current study are consistent with\nbehavior setting theory, which suggests that behavior is\nimpacted by characteristics of the immediate context in\nwhich it occurs (4). There is emerging support for the\nnotion that microcontextual factors, such as with whom and\nwhere a person is located, influence characteristics of the\nhealth behavior taking place in that environment (39). This\nmicrocontextual approach is supported by calls for research\non context-specific behaviors and behavior-specific aspects\nof the environment relevant to physical activity (29).\nOverall, findings suggest that sports and exercise behaviors\ncan take on different characteristics depending on the\nmicrocontext in which they take place.\nThe results suggest that exercising alone has a beneficial\nimpact on bout intensity and an unfavorable effect on bout\nduration. In contrast to children, who were found to engage\nin more intense physical activities when in the presence of\nothers compared with when they were alone (30), exercise\namong adults in the current study was significantly more\nlikely to reach a vigorous intensity when performed alone.\nA potential explanation for this finding is that high-intensity\nactivities, such as speed and endurance training, are simply\nless feasible when occurring with family members or other\ngroups with mixed ages and activity levels. The decreased\nFIGURE 2--Predicted marginal means for duration (in min) of\nmoderate (A) and vigorous (B) exercise bouts by physical environment.\nExamples of other/unspecified locations are someone else's house,\nschool, and place of worship.

Another possible reason is that\nthe goal of successfully completing the exercise task at a\ndesired intensity level is more salient during solitary bouts\ncompared with bouts performed with others, which could\nalso have process-oriented social or entertainment objec-\ntives. The unfavorable effect of exercising alone on bout\nduration, however, is consistent with a large body of work\nemphasizing the advantages of social support and peer\nsome evidence to suggest that exercising with other people\nis more enjoyable, pleasant, or entertaining than exercising\nalone (10,11), which could result in longer sessions. Also\npossible is that the cooperative or competitive nature of\nengaging in sports and exercise with other people has a\npositive impact on enjoyment and performance (13,34).\nExercise occurring with people coming from multiple\ncategories is performed with more than one other person.\nThe added element of this group dynamic may further\naccount for its beneficial impact on bout duration. Taken\ntogether, results from the current study show that social\nenvironments can have different implications for exercise\nintensity and duration.\nDifferential findings also emerged for the effect of the\nphysical environment on exercise intensity and duration.\nThe greater likelihood of vigorous activity occurring at a\nhealth club/gym and at home may be due to the increased\navailability of cardiovascular and strengthening equipment\nat these locations. These results diverge from studies on\nchildren, which suggest that activity intensity is higher\noutdoors than inside their home (3), and may indicate age\ndifferences in preferences for types of vigorous activity\n(e.g., adults prefer indoor treadmill running, whereas\nchildren prefer outdoor sports). Yet, this hypothesis has\nnot been tested. The fact that exercise sessions taking place\nin outdoor and other/unspecified locations persisted longer,\nhowever, may reflect unique features of those settings. For\nexample, a few studies suggest that exercising outdoors and\nin natural settings is perceived to be more pleasant than\nexercising in artificial environments (6,44). The ATUS was\nnot specifically designed to study exercise environments\nin-depth, and therefore, a substantial number of physical\nlocations have been coded as other/unspecified. Some of\nthese activities took place at someone else's house, school,\nor a place of worship. Unfortunately, we are unable to infer\nmuch about the remainder of the locations included in this\ncategory, but they may consist of recreational facilities such\nas ice/roller skating rinks, climbing walls, obstacle courses,\nor other places not included in the general ATUS coding\nschema. Distinctive characteristics of these settings, such as\nthe availability of specialized and/or novel equipment,\ncould account for in the extended exercise bouts taking\nplace in those settings.\nOverall, these findings provide evidence supporting the\nexistence of distinct typologies of context-specific exercise\nbehaviors. Some environments may be more conducive to\nhigher-intensity activities, whereas others are more condu-\ncive to activities that are longer in duration. The prioritiza-\ntion of intensity or duration for an activity bout could vary\non the basis of contextual factors. Specifically, when people\nare exercising in the company of others or outdoors, fun and\nenjoyment might be important. In this case, people might\nprioritize activity duration over intensity. In contrast, when\npeople exercise alone, especially in a health club (where\nthere is training equipment and help from professional\ntrainers) or at home (if they own exercise equipment), the\nprimary goal could be to engage in high-intensity exercise\nto improve fitness. Prioritizing intensity in health clubs and\nat home might naturally result in shorter exercise bouts.\nThese results shed light on the larger issue of environment\u00ad\nbehavior specificity that has been receiving growing\nattention (23,29). The choice of settings for specific\nprograms may need to take into account individual differ-\nences and whether increasing the intensity or duration of\nactivity (or both) is the overall objective for the program.\nUsing the ATUS to examine differences in the intensity\nand duration of sports and exercise bouts across environ-\nments offers several strengths. First, because the ATUS\nrelied on short-term recall of activities and their environ-\nments, the data may be less vulnerable to recall errors than\ntypical self-report assessments of physical activity, which\nask respondents to recall activities over longer periods (15).\nSecond, physical activity is only one of the many daily\nactivities assessed in the ATUS. Thus, physical activity\nreporting in the ATUS may be less influenced by social\ndesirability reporting bias. In addition, reporting time use\nchronologically across the day can provide temporal and\ncontextual cues that may help to improve the accuracy of\nactivity recall (16). Lastly, after applying the appropriate\npopulation weights, information reported on the ATUS is\nnationally representative and, therefore, describes sports\nand exercise performed by U.S. adults on any given day.\nThere are a few limitations to this study, however. First,\nthe ATUS is a cross-sectional study and therefore, we need\nto exert caution in making causal interpretations of the\nfindings. Second, the ``other/unspecified'' category within\nthe physical environment variable is quite large and\nheterogeneous because the ATUS was not specifically\ndesigned to measure physical activity environments. Third,\ndespite efforts taken by the ATUS developers to standardize\nresponse explanations and coding (31), respondents may\nhave experienced some confusion and ambiguity with\nregards to how to report certain environments such as\nexercising outdoors when at work. Also, 24-h recall time\nuse surveys describe the average behavior of a group (e.g.,\nproportion of individuals reporting physical activity) on any\ngiven day. They are not intended to estimate an individual's\nusual behavior (i.e., average daily physical activity level),\nwhich can vary from day to day. Furthermore, it is possible\nthat the threshold levels for moderate and vigorous activity\n(3.0 and 6.0 METs, respectively) do not accurately reflect\nENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON EXERCISE Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise\nd\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

Lastly, the current\nstudy focused only on recreational sports and exercise. The\nanalyses did not include activities performed for the purpose\nof transportation, work, or household chores.\nIn summary, research using a nationally representative\ntime use survey of U.S. adults found that the intensity and\nduration of sports and exercise bouts differ across social and\nphysical environments. However, the effect of context was\nnot consistent for intensity and duration. Therefore, the\nchoice of settings for specific exercise programs may need\nto take into account whether increasing the intensity or\nduration of exercise takes priority. Overall, results support\nthe existence of context-specific exercise behaviors.\nThe first author was supported by the Cancer Prevention Fellowship\nProgram, Office of Preventive Oncology, National Cancer Institute,\nNational Institutes of Health during the preparation of this article.\nWe would like to thank the ATUS staff at the U.S. Bureau of\nLabor and Statistics for their technical assistance with this project.\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the\nauthors and not necessarily those of the Department of Health and\nHuman Services, the National Institutes of Health, or the National\nCancer Institute.
