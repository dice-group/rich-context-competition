It adds the col-\nlection of biomarkers and performance assessments to the Taiwan Longitudinal Study of\nAging (TLSA), a nationally representative study of adults aged 60 and over, including the\ninstitutionalized population. The TLSA began in 1989, with follow-ups approximately\nSEBAS, based on a sub-sample of respondents from the 1999 TLSA, was conducted in\n2000. A total of 1023 respondents completed both a face-to-face home interview and,\nseveral weeks later, a hospital-based physical examination. In addition to a 12-h\n(7 pm\u00ad7 am) urine specimen collected the night before and a fasting blood specimen col-\nlected during the examination, trained staff measured blood pressure, height, weight\nand waist and hip circumferences. A second wave of SEBAS was conducted in 2006\nusing a similar protocol to SEBAS 2000, but with the addition of performance assess-\nments conducted by the interviewers at the end of the home interview. Both waves of\nSEBAS also included measures of health status (physical, emotional, cognitive), health\nbehaviours, social relationships and exposure to stressors. The SEBAS data, which are\npublicly available at [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/3792/version/\n5], allow researchers to explore the relationships among life challenges, the social envir-\nonment and health and to examine the antecedents, correlates and consequences of\nchange in biological measures and health.\nV\nC The Author 2014; all rights reserved.

The\nSocial Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study\n(SEBAS) in Taiwan was initially developed to explore how\nunderstanding the relationships among life challenges, the\nsocial environment and health can be enhanced by examin-\ning biological markers of health and stress. Incorporating\nbiological data into large-scale social surveys not only ex-\npands the range and depth of research topics that can be\npursued, but can also enhance study findings based solely\non self-reported data (which may suffer from misreporting)\nor on smaller clinical studies that are often not generaliz-\nable to the larger population.1\nSpecific aims of the initial study included: (i) investigat-\ning the extent to which biological markers of stress and\nchronic illness are related to reports of life events; (ii)\nexamining the extent to which biological markers help to\nexplain variation in health across social hierarchies and\nnetworks; and (iii) exploring the associations among the\nbiological markers, data from physicians' examinations\nand self-reported health status, and their links to survival.\nWith the addition of longitudinal data, the goals of the\nproject have expanded to understanding the antecedents,\ncorrelates and consequences of levels and changes in biolo-\ngical measures, health and survival.\nWho is in the cohort?\nSEBAS is an extension of the Taiwan Longitudinal Study\nof Aging (TLSA: also called the Survey of Health and\nLiving Status of the Near Elderly and Elderly). Here we\ngive a brief summary of the survey design and protocol;\nmore detailed information is provided elsewhere.2 The\nTLSA began in 1989 with follow-ups approximately every\n3 years; younger refresher cohorts were added in 1996 and\ntive, including the institutionalized population, and com-\nA three-stage sampling design that mirrored the original\nTLSA design was used to select from the respondents who\nwere interviewed in 1999 a national sub-sample for the\nSEBAS 2000 cohort. Two visits were made to the SEBAS\nrespondents' homes between July and December 2000: one\nto administer a face-to-face questionnaire and the second,\nseveral weeks later, to deliver urine collection containers\nand make final arrangements for a hospital examination\nthe following morning. As shown in Figure 1, 1497 per-\nsons (92% of those eligible) were interviewed in their\nthe physical examination, which was generally equivalent\nto an annual physical examination offered by the national\nhealth insurance programme.\nTable 1 shows that respondents participating in the\n2000 hospital examination were younger, more likely to be\nmale, and better educated than those who did not partici-\npate. Compared with non-participants, examination par-\nticipants were also less likely to report difficulty with any\nactivity of daily living (ADL), which was not surprising\ngiven that respondents with serious health conditions were\nineligible for the examination. The distribution by self-\nassessed health status suggests that respondents at both ex-\ntremes were less likely to participate in the examination:\nthose who reported being in poor/not-so-good and those\nwho reported excellent health were under-represented\namong participants. As a result of these offsetting influ-\nences, the mean self-reported health status for participants\nKey Messages\n\u00b7 By combining self-reported information with clinical data, assays from blood and urine specimens, and performance\nassessments, SEBAS allows researchers to elaborate the relationships among the social environment, life challenges\nand health in an older population and to examine how biological markers of stress and health enhance our under-\nstanding of these relationships.\n\u00b7 SEBAS data show that higher socioeconomic status, more contact with friends, greater participation in social activ-\nities, and religious involvement are all associated with lower physiological dysregulation and better health, but family\nsocial ties reveal little, if any, association with physiological dysregulation or cognitive function.\n\u00b7 Findings based on SEBAS data provide only modest support for the theory of allostatic load, showing a weak associ-\nation between exposure to stress and physiological dysregulation.\n\u00b7 Biomarkers derived from blood and urine specimens, especially markers of inflammation, improve morbidity and\nmortality prediction compared with self-reports alone, as do interviewer-administered performance assessments\n(e.g. peak expiratory flow and grip strength).\nand non-participants was the same (3.1 on a five-point\nscale where 5 \u00bc excellent, P 0.84 based on a t test).\nHow often have they been followed-up?\nA follow-up study was fielded between August 2006 and\nthe end of January 2007, using a protocol similar to the\nspondents who had completed both the home interview\nand the health examination in 2000 as well as a refresher\ncomprised a representative cross-section of the Taiwanese\npopulation aged 53 and older.\nof those interviewed) participated in the physical examin-\nation.

Compared with those interviewed, dece-\ndents were less educated, whereas those lost to follow-up\nwere more educated.\nWhat has been measured?\nThe SEBAS 2000 in-home interview was conducted by a\nlocal public health nurse and lasted for 1 h on average.2 In\n2006, trained interviewers conducted the in-home inter-\nview and administered a new module of health assess-\nments, which included in-home measurement of blood\npressure (in addition to the measurements in hospital) and\na set of performance-based tests (i.e. grip strength, lung\ncapacity, walking speed and chair stands). Together, the\n2006 in-home interview and health assessments took about\nTable 3 summarizes the data collected during the home\ninterview; Table 4 summarizes the clinical health indica-\ntors derived from the physical examination and the blood\nand urine samples. Comparisons of the laboratory assay re-\nsults for duplicate specimens sent to the laboratory in\nTaiwan (Union Clinical Laboratory) indicate high intra-\nlaboratory correlations (>\u00bc 0.9) for most markers tested,\nwith a few notable exceptions (e.g. IGF-1, sICAM-1).\nBased on comparisons with results from a laboratory in the\nUSA (Quest Diagnostics), inter-laboratory correlations\nwere also generally high (>\u00bc 0.9), but in some cases (e.g.\natinine and urinary cortisol in 2006), the correlations were\nSEBAS User's Guide.2 Unless otherwise noted, measures\nExam Participation Exam Participation\nHome\nInterview\nNon-\nParticipants\nParticipants\nP-value\ndifferencea\nHome\nInterview\nNon-\nParticipants\nParticipants\nP-value\ndifferencea\nAge (years)\nEducation\nSelf-assessed health status\naChi-square test for differences by whether participated in the physical examination.\nbOther ethnicities include Fukienese, Hakka and Aboriginal.\ncADL (Activities of Daily Living) include: bathing, dressing, eating, getting out of bed, moving about the house and using the toilet.\nwere collected in both waves of SEBAS.

Respondents were\nasked to place themselves on the ladder according to where\nthey thought they belonged in the hierarchy. The 2000\nSEBAS contained a second measure that asked respondents\nto rank themselves in their communities rather than in\nAs a complement to the simple self-rated health ques-\ntion, which is widely used and has been shown to be a\ngood predictor of mortality, questions in the 2006 SEBAS\nasked the interviewer and the examining physician to as-\nsess the respondent's health on the same five-point scale\n(excellent, good, average, not so good and poor). In an\nanalysis of how well these questions predicted 5-year sur-\nvival, two unexpected findings emerged: (i) physicians' rat-\nings were weak predictors of survival; and (ii) interviewer\nratings were more powerful predictors of survival than\nself-ratings.5 The results suggest that including a simple\nquestion at the end of face-to-face interviews, asking inter-\nviewers to provide an assessment of the respondents' over-\nall health, may be a powerful and inexpensive addition to\nhousehold surveys. Testing in other socio-cultural settings\nis needed to further evaluate the utility of such a measure.\nAlso in 2006, selected items from the Pittsburgh Sleep\nQuality Index (PSQI)6 were added to the survey. Three of\nthe seven components of the PSQI were included in full\n(subjective sleep quality, sleep duration and habitual sleep\nefficiency). SEBAS included one of two items from each of\ntwo other components (sleep latency, daytime dysfunc-\ntion). Items from the remaining two components (sleeping\ndisturbances, use of sleeping medication) were excluded.\nWhat has been found?\nSEBAS has spurred more than 70 publications, primarily in\nsocial science, health and epidemiology journals. Analyses\nusing the SEBAS data have covered a range of substantive\nand methodological questions; we highlight a few here. For\na list of SEBAS-based publications, see [http://cph.george\ntown.edu/taiwan.html#2].\nTesting the allostatic load framework\nThe theory underlying allostatic load implies that the ex-\nperience or perception of repeated stressful situations can\ncause dysregulation in multiple physiological systems\nwhich, in turn, can lead to poor health outcomes.7\nNumerous SEBAS analyses have tested hypotheses based\non the theory of allostatic load. In general these studies\nfind, at most, only modest links between stress and physio-\nlogical dysregulation.8\u00ad13 Thus, based on the measures of\nstressful experience and biomarkers typically included in\nlarge-scale biosocial surveys, SEBAS data have provided\nlittle evidence to support the allostatic load framework.\nVariables Interviewed (N \u00bc 757) LFUa (N \u00bc 89) Died before survey (N \u00bc 177) P-value differenceb\nAge (years)\nEducation\naLFU, lost to follow-up\nbChi-square test for differences by whether participated in the physical examination.\ncOther ethnicities include Fukienese, Hakka, and Aboriginal.\ndADL (activities of daily living) include: bathing, dressing, eating, getting out of bed, moving about the house and using the toilet.\nStronger relationships might have emerged if SEBAS con-\ntained more detailed measures of lifetime exposure and re-\nsponse to stressors or more comprehensive measures of\nbiological risk. A comparative study between Taiwan, the\nUSA and Russia suggests that the connection between per-\nceived stress and physiological dysregulation is stronger in\nRussia than in the USA or Taiwan.14 The expected associ-\nation was observed in Muscovites of both sexes, who also\nreported the highest levels of perceived stress among the\nthree populations, but not in the Taiwanese, who reported\nthe lowest levels of perceived stress. This finding raises the\npossibility that the adverse effects of perceived stress on\nbiomarkers become evident only when the level of stress\nreaches some threshold.\nIs the blood worth the toil, tears and sweat?\nIn light of the cost, complex logistics and considerable re-\nspondent burden imposed by adding biomarkers to large-\nscale surveys, a number of analyses using SEBAS data have\nexplored whether biomarkers offer incremental value be-\nyond self-reported measures, which are easier to collect\nTable 3.

Results demonstrate\nthat biomarkers improve mortality prediction compared\nwith self-reports alone, but a collection of individual\nmarkers performs better than a conventional biomarker\nsummary score (see Figure 2).15 That study also suggests\nthat collecting a second round of biological measures may\nimprove mortality prediction compared with one-time\nmeasurement, although the incremental gain may be\nsmall.15 Another study shows that interviewer-administered\nperformance assessments, particularly peak expiratory flow\nand grip strength, also predict mortality above and beyond\nself-reported physical functioning.16 Such tests are less inva-\nsive than collection of biofluids (and may be less expensive),\nbut might be equally powerful in predicting downstream\nhealth and mortality.\nIn a related line of research, analyses of SEBAS data\nshow that some biomarkers have greater prognostic power\nthan others. For instance, with the exception of DHEAS,\nneuroendocrine markers (i.e. stress hormones) make little\ncontribution to predicting mortality, whereas inflamma-\ntory markers yield the most prognostic value.15 These re-\nsults bolster earlier findings suggesting that inflammatory\nmarkers have greater power than standard clinical (i.e. car-\ndiovascular and metabolic) measures for predicting sur-\nvival.17,18 Inflammatory markers also account for a higher\nproportion of sex differences in life expectancy at older\nages than standard clinical markers, although no marker\ncomes close to smoking in this regard.18\nSocial environment, biomarkers, and health\nAdditional SEBAS-based analyses show that the social en-\nvironment, encompassing position in social hierarchy as\nwell as linkages within social networks and support\nTable 4.

For instance, contact\nwith friends, participation in social activities and/or reli-\ngious involvement are associated with lower levels of allo-\neven though the extended family system and filial piety\nplay important roles in Taiwanese society,21 family social\nties reveal little, if any, association with physiological dys-\nregulation12 or cognitive function.19 The SEBAS data re-\nveal weak and inconsistent associations between social\nrelationship indicators and inflammatory markers.22\nOther analyses have focused on the relationships among\nposition in the social hierarchy, biological markers and\nhealth. These studies show the expected inverse relation-\nship between education, income and health23 and that\nhigher perceived social position is associated with better\nhealth, even after controlling for objective measures of\nSES.24,25 The use of cross-sectional data, however, may\noverestimate the relationship between subjective social sta-\ntus and health because the relationship between perceived\nsocial status and subsequent health is greatly attenuated\nwhen controlling for baseline health.25\nAn ongoing discussion in the literature concerns how\n`SES gets under the skin' to affect health. In this regard,\nSEBAS data have been used to examine whether biological\nmarkers mediate the relationship between SES and health:\nseveral studies indicate that biomarkers have accounted for\nonly a small part of the social disparities in health in\nsimilar analysis of education, biomarkers and health in\nRussia reveals exceptionally large social disparities in\nhealth among Muscovites; biomarkers account for a larger\nshare of those disparities than in some countries that have\nWhat are the main strengths and\nweaknesses?\nPerhaps the most notable strength of the data is the detail\nand breadth of the available indicators related to health,\nthe social environment and life challenges. First, as seen in\nTable 4, the data contain an unusually large array of biolo-\ngical markers, including several genetic markers. Current\nwork includes assays for additional genes and single nu-\ncleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); the public-use data file\nwill be updated for these markers when the work is com-\nplete. Second, self-reported measures cover: multiple di-\nmensions of health status (physical, emotional and\nFigure 2. AUC improvements over baseline model from models predicting 5-year mortality as a function of self-reported indicators and biomarkers.\nIn addition to age, the baseline model controls for sex, ethnicity (Mainlander vs Taiwanese), urban residence, education, social integration and per-\nceived availability of social support. The self-reported health indicators include global self-assessed health, an index of mobility limitations, history of\ndiabetes, history of cancer, number of hospitalizations in the past 12 months and smoking status. The biomarkers comprise eight standard cardiovas-\ncular/metabolic risk factors, four inflammatory markers, four neuroendocrine markers and three other markers that do not represent a common biolo-\ngical subsystem. The biomarker summary score counts the number of markers (out of 19) for which the respondent exhibits a high-risk level, which\nis defined by established cutoffs for the standard cardiovascular/metabolic factors and C-reactive protein (CRP) and by the high-risk quartile for the re-\nmaining markers.

Third, interviewer-administered health assessments\noffer yet another method for evaluating the respondent's\nhealth. Fourth, the data include high quality information\nfor determining survival status. Finally, SEBAS includes in-\ndicators of both objective and subjective socioeconomic\nstatus, social relationships and exposure to stressors rang-\ning from daily hassles to trauma.\nOther strengths include: a relatively large, nationally\nrepresentative sample; an age range that includes persons\nas young as 53; high participation rates; and longitudinal\nfollow-up with low loss to follow-up. Nonetheless, the\ndata also have limitations. As with any study of an older\npopulation, those who died at relatively early ages are not\nrepresented; yet, the proportion of the Taiwanese popula-\nso, surveying people in middle or older ages limits our abil-\nity to obtain reliable information about events that\noccurred much earlier in life (e.g. childhood). In addition,\nthe subset of respondents for whom longitudinal bio-\nmarker data are available is much smaller than the sample\nof respondents interviewed in either wave (N \u00bc 639 partici-\nFigure 1). Lastly, as with other general surveys of health\nand ageing, in order to obtain breadth of information,\nSEBAS must sacrifice depth of detail collected about any\nparticular area. For instance, psychologists might mourn\nthe limited data on personality, whereas others might pine\nfor more detailed economic or contextual measures.\nCan I get hold of the data? Where can I find\nout more?\nThe data and documentation are maintained and distrib-\nuted by the National Archive of Computerized Data on\nAging (NACDA) within the Inter-university Consortium of\nPolitical and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA (persistent URL: http://\nwww.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/3792/ver\nsion/5).
