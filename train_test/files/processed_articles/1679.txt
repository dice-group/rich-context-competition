Twins ranged in age from 45 to 89 years. Quantita-\ntive genetic analysis of four measures of olfactory functioning indicated moderate heritability for odor identifica-\ntion and perceived intensity and nonsignificant heritability for odor detection and perceived pleasantness.\nBivariate analyses revealed that the relationship between odor identification and measures of verbal ability was\nprimarily genetically mediated. The results provided further support for the hypothesis that odor identification\nand verbal ability in general tap the same cognitive domain (Larsson, 1997).\nOST research in cognitive psychology has concen-\ntrated on visual and, to some extent, auditory presen-\ntation of information. Over the past decade, however, a\ngrowing body of research has focused on the perceptual and\ncognitive components of the sense of smell. Individuals dif-\nfer in their ability to detect odors (Van Toller, Dodd, & Bill-\nFurthermore, there are significant age differences in these\nabilities, as well as in recognition memory for odors over\nvarious delay intervals (for a review, see Larsson, 1997).\nThe nature of these individual differences and age differ-\nences has yet to be explained. The primary objective of the\npresent investigation was to apply quantitative genetic\nmethods to individual differences in olfactory functioning\nin a sample of healthy older adults.\nOlfactory Functioning\nOne method for investigating individual differences in\nvarious olfactory functions is the twin study. Comparing the\nsimilarity of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) pairs\nallows researchers to determine the extent to which the vari-\nance in a trait (e.g., odor detection) arises from genetic or\nenvironmental factors. Previous twin studies of olfactory\nfunctioning have focused primarily on detection of individ-\nual odors. Several twin and family studies have demon-\nstrated a genetic basis for specific anosmias, the inability to\ndetect a certain odor (Amoore & Steinle, 1991; Whissell-\nonstrated that the specific anosmia to androstenone, a ste-\nroid metabolite produced by many mammals, has a signifi-\ncant genetic component.\nIn contrast, few twin studies have investigated genetic\nand environmental influences on variation in olfactory func-\ntioning in the normal range. Hubert, Fabsitz, Feinleib, and\nBrown (1980) found no evidence for heritability of olfac-\ntory sensitivity to three odorants: acetic acid (pungent),\nisobutric acid (sweaty), and cyclohexanone (camphora-\nceous). Although MZ correlations were not significantly\ngreater than DZ correlations for any of the odorants, the\ndata for acetic acid were suggestive. Using a different set of\nodorants, Gross-Isseroff, Ophir, Bartana, Voet, and Lancet\n(1992) found significantly greater MZ than DZ similarity\nfor androstenone and isoamyl acetate (banana) but not for\ncitral (lemon) or eugenol (cloves). Finally, Segal, Topolski,\nWilson, Brown, and Araki (1995) reported no difference in\nMZ and DZ twin correlations for detection of a single odor-\nant (phenyl ethyl alcohol). Thus, the evidence for genetic\nand environmental influences on odor detection is inconsis-\ntent across odorants.\nMeasures of odor detection (can you smell it?) princi-\npally reflect sensory processes, whereas measures of odor\nidentification (what is it?) reflect both sensory and cognitive\nprocesses (Wijk & Cain, 1994). In an important departure\nfrom previous investigations, Segal and colleagues (1995)\nalso reported twin correlations for performance on an odor\nidentification task. Segal and her colleagues administered\nthe University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test\n(UPSIT) to 45 MZ pairs and 37 DZ pairs ranging in age\nfrom 11 to 83 years. The UPSIT is a standardized test of\nodor identification that requires participants to label 40\nodorants presented in a multiple-choice format (Doty, Sha-\nsignificantly greater than the DZ correlation of .15; how-\never, the results are suggestive of a genetic contribution to\nodor identification.\nOne advantage of scales like the UPSIT is the increase in\nreliable variance that results from summing performance\nacross several items. In a twin study, the result is increased\npower to detect genetic influences. Previous twin studies of\nodor detection have produced results that vary widely;\nM\ntherefore, in the present investigation we chose to summa-\nrize responses across six odorants to create scales. The first\ngoal of the investigation was to examine genetic and envi-\nronmental contributions to individual differences on four\nmeasures of olfactory functioning: odor detection, odor\nidentification, perceived pleasantness, and perceived inten-\nsity of the olfactory information. Perception of pleasantness\nand intensity are classic components of investigations of ol-\nfactory functioning (e.g., Doty, Orndorff, Leyden, & Klig-\nGilbert, 1989); however, to date these variables have not\nbeen included in a twin study of olfactory functioning.\nRelationship With Cognitive Abilities\nOdor identification marks the point at which the bottom-\nup process of sensory functioning and the top-down process\nof cognitive abilities intersect (Richardson & Zucco, 1989).\nAccording to Schab (1991), odor identification is a semantic\nmemory task: The participant is required to access the ap-\npropriate label for the odorant. In contrast, odor recognition\ntaps episodic memory: Participants are presented with a set\nof odorants and later asked to decide which test odorants\nwere presented before. Investigations of odor recognition\nmemory grew out of an interest in the ability of certain\nodors to evoke vivid memories. Marked age differences in\nepisodic odor recognition memory have been demonstrated\n(Larsson, 1997). Evidence has suggested that the age differ-\nences in odor recognition result in large part from age dif-\nferences in cognitive abilities, specifically semantic mem-\nory. In two separate studies, Larsson and B\u00e4ckman (1993,\n1997) demonstrated that age-related differences in odor rec-\nognition memory were eliminated when odor identification\n(a semantic memory task) was statistically controlled.\nOdor identification may play a fundamental role in olfac-\ntory functioning and odor memory. Little evidence exists,\nhowever, about the relationship between odor identification\nand measures of cognitive abilities. Research has indicated\nthat sensory deficits alone cannot explain age differences in\nphy, Cain, Gilmore, & Skinner, 1991). For example, even\nafter screening participants to ensure equivalent perfor-\nmance on measures of odor sensitivity, Schemper and col-\nleagues (1981) still found age differences in the ability to\nidentify a set of 40 odorants. Consequently, cognitive fac-\ntors must play a role (Richardson & Zucco, 1989; Schab,\nnificant correlations between odor identification and cogni-\ntive abilities--particularly those cognitive measures with a\nstrong verbal component.\nThe second goal of the present investigation was an ex-\namination of the nature of the relationship between odor\nidentification and cognitive abilities. In the present analysis,\nquantitative genetic methods were used to determine the rel-\native contribution of age, genes, and environments to the re-\nlationship between olfactory functioning and cognition. The\ncorrelation could arise from a variety of genetic and envi-\nronmental influences. If, for example, the genetic influences\non odor identification and cognition were correlated, one\ncould conclude that the association arises through a geneti-\ncally influenced mechanism, such as that influencing verbal\nfunctioning. If, however, only the environmental influences\non odor identification and cognition were correlated, this\nwould suggest that something in the environment had pro-\nduced the relationship. The environmental effect could be\nshared by family members, for example, when parents pro-\nvide an intellectually stimulating rearing. In contrast, the\nenvironmental effect could be specific to an individual, such\nas lifestyle variables or a neurological trauma affecting both\nodor identification and cognitive ability. Thus, not only the\nexistence of the relationship between odor identification\nand cognition but also potential mechanisms producing this\nrelationship can be investigated. Understanding the nature\nof the correlation between odor identification and cognition\nwill improve understanding of the nature of age differences\nin olfactory functioning.\nIn sum, our goals in the present investigation were two-\nfold. First, we used univariate quantitative genetic analysis\nto determine genetic and environmental influences on four\nmeasures of olfactory functioning. Second, we used bivari-\nate quantitative genetic analysis to determine the contribu-\ntions of age, genes, and environment to the correlation be-\ntween olfactory functioning and cognitive measures. To\naddress these goals, data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin\nStudy of Aging (SATSA; Pedersen et al., 1991) were ana-\nlyzed. A Swedish version of the National Geographic Smell\ntwin pairs ranging in age from 45 to 89 years.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nAscertainment procedures for SATSA have been de-\nscribed previously (Pedersen et al., 1991). In brief, the sam-\nple is a subset of twins from the population-based Swedish\nTwin Registry (Cederl\u00f6f & Lorich, 1978). The base popula-\ntion of twins consists of all pairs of twins who indicated that\nthey had been separated before the age of 11 and reared\napart and a sample of twins reared together, matched on the\nbasis of gender and date and county of birth (Pedersen, Fri-\nberg, Floderus-Myrhed, McClearn, & Plomin, 1984). Al-\nthough twins were labeled reared apart if they were sepa-\nrated by age 11, the distribution of age at separation is\nhighly skewed. Fifty-two percent of the reared-apart twins\nwere separated before age 1 year, 69% by age 2 years, and\nmin, Nesselroade, and McClearn (1992) found little or no\neffect of either age of separation or correlated rearing envi-\nronments on twin similarity for cognitive abilities for the\nreared-apart SATSA twins. Twins were first mailed ques-\ntionnaires, and a sample of those pairs in which both twins\nresponded was invited to participate in an examination of\ncognitive abilities, which occurred in person. In-person test-\ning took place in a location convenient to the twins, such as\ndistrict nurses' offices, health-care schools, and long-term\ncare clinics (Pedersen et al., 1991). Testing was completed\nduring a 4-hr visit that involved cognitive testing and a\nhealth examination.\nDemographic characteristics of the sample for the present\nanalyses are presented in Table 1. Zygosity was determined\non the basis of serological assay. The sample included 31\npairs of monozygotic twins reared apart (MZA), 55 pairs of\nmonozygotic twins reared together (MZT), 72 pairs of dizy-\ngotic twins reared apart (DZA), and 69 pairs of dizygotic\ntwins reared together (DZT). Participants ranged in age\nfrom 45 to 89 years. There were significant differences in\nthe gender distribution between zygosity groups, 2(3, N \nproximately half the respondents were women. With 68%\nfemale pairs, the gender distribution of DZA pairs more\nnearly matched the demographic characteristics of this age\nrange. Education was rated on a 4-point scale, and the aver-\nage education score fell between 1 and 2, where 1 indicated\ncompletion of elementary education and 2 indicated com-\npletion of vocational high school. Participants were asked to\nrate their general health on a scale ranging from 1 (good) to\n3 (bad). Use of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes was included in\nthe calculation of packyears (Kendler, Karkowski, & Peder-\nsen, 1999). Cigars and pipes were converted to cigarette\nequivalents (e.g., 1 cigar  4 cigarettes). There were no sig-\nnificant differences in mean age, mean education, mean\nself-rated health, or mean packyears between zygosity\ngroups.\nMeasures\nOlfactory measures.--Twins participating in SATSA\nwere mailed a series of questionnaires in 1990 assessing\nhealth, personality, and lifestyle variables, including smok-\ning behavior. At that time, twins received a Swedish version\nof the National Geographic Smell Survey (Wysocki & Gil-\nbert, 1989). In the Swedish version, a translation of the\nquestions was attached to the original National Geographic\nscratch-and-sniff forms. The Smell Survey was mailed to\nreturned from pairs in which both twins participated. The\nsurvey included a set of six microencapsulated odorants\nchosen to represent a range of pleasantness, familiarity, and\nfood relatedness. Two odorants were food related: isoamyl\nacetate, a banana- or pearlike fruity odor, and eugenol, a\nmajor component of clove oil. A pleasant, nonfood aroma\nwas provided by synthetic rose. A mixture of mercaptans\n(sulfurous compounds added to natural gas as a warning\nodor) provided an unpleasant, nonfood odor. The two final\nodors were musk related. Androstenone is a volatile steroid\nmetabolite produced by many mammals; it can smell of ei-\nther musk or urine. Galaxolide is a synthetic musk widely\nused in commercial perfumes.\nRespondents were asked to scratch and sniff a panel con-\ntaining each odorant and answer several questions, includ-\ning \"Did you smell something (yes or no)?\" \"Did it smell\ngood or bad?\" \"How intense is this odor?\" The questions\nconcerning perceived pleasantness and perceived intensity\nwere answered on a 5-point scale ranging from good to bad\nand from weak to strong, respectively. Respondents were\nalso asked to identify the odorant by responding to the ques-\ntion \"Which word best describes this odor?\" Response op-\ntions were floral, musk, urine, foul, ink, spice, wood, fruit,\nburnt, sweet, and other (if other, what?). The descriptors\nwere chosen to provide generic-level, nonoverlapping des-\nignations of odor quality (Russell and colleagues, 1993;\nWysocki & Gilbert, 1989). Odor identification was scored\nby using the standard answers identified by Wysocki and\nGilbert (1989). If respondents provided a veridical label for\nthe odorant, their responses were counted as correct. Also, if\na participant emitted a near-miss label such as banana candy\nfor amyl acetate, it was coded as correct. If respondents de-\ntected an odorant but proved unable to identify it, then their\nidentification responses were scored as incorrect. Data for\neach question were summarized across odorants to obtain\nfour measures: number of odorants detected (odor detec-\ntion), number of odorants correctly identified (odor identifi-\ncation), mean perceived pleasantness, and mean perceived\nintensity.\nCognitive measures.--The SATSA cognitive test bat-\ntery includes 11 cognitive measures drawn from various\nsources and chosen to assess four areas of cognitive ability\n(Pedersen et al., 1992). Verbal ability is tapped by tests of\nInformation, Synonyms, and Analogies. Figure Logic,\nBlock Design, and Card Rotations assess spatial abilities.\nMemory tests include Digit Span, Thurstone's Picture\nMemory, and Names and Faces. Finally, perceptual speed is\nmeasured by Digit Symbol and Figure Identification. Reli-\nabilities for these tests range from .82 to .96. A measure of\ngeneral cognitive ability was also created by obtaining indi-\nviduals' scores on the first principal component of all the\nmeasures (as in Pedersen et al., 1992). All measures loaded\nhigher than .50 on the first principal component, which ac-\ncounted for 48% of the total variance.\nStatistical Method\nThe basic assumptions underlying the twin design are\nthat (a) the shared environmental factors that produce simi-\nlarities among twin pairs are the same for the MZ and DZ\ntwin pairs, (b) there is no assortative mating on the traits of\ninterest, and (c) there are no nonadditive genetic effects.\nPrevious research with SATSA data have indicated that\nthese assumptions are not violated in that sample (Pedersen\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics of the Sample\nCharacteristic M SD M SD M SD M SD\nNotes: MZA  monozygotic twins reared apart, DZA  dizygotic twins\nreared apart, MZT  MZ twins reared together, DZT  DZ twins reared to-\ngether. Education was rated on a scale ranging from 1 (elementary school) to 4\n(university or higher). Self-rated health was rated on a scale ranging from 1\n(good) to 3 (bad). Perceived pleasantness ranged from 1 (good) to 5 (bad). Per-\nceived intensity ranged from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong).\net al., 1992). When these assumptions are met, the total\nvariance in a trait is typically divided into three compo-\nnents: genetic effects, shared environmental effects, and\nnonshared environmental effects. Shared environmental\nfactors make family members more similar to each other,\nwhereas nonshared environmental factors make family\nmembers less similar to each other. When the sample in-\ncludes twins reared together and twins reared apart, how-\never, the rearing environment can be modeled more pre-\ncisely. We can differentiate between rearing environmental\neffects and the effects of environmental factors that happen\nto be correlated for twins regardless of their rearing status.\nIn the current analyses, then, the total variance was divided\ninto components explained by four separate influences: ad-\nditive genetic effects (Va), correlated environmental effects\n(Vc), shared rearing environmental effects (Vs), and non-\nshared environmental effects including error (Vns). The\nphenotypic covariance between twins, assuming the four\ncomponents of variance are uncorrelated, can be expressed\nas in the following equations for monozygotic twins reared\ntogether (MZT), monozygotic twin reared apart (MZA),\ndizygotic twins reared together (DZT), and dizygotic twin\nreared apart (DZA):\nwhere covMZT represents the covariance between MZT\ntwins. MZ twins share all their genetic material; thus, they\nhave all of their genetic variance in common. DZ twins\nshare, on average, one half of their segregating genes so that\nthey have only half of their genetic variance in common.\nCorrelated environmental effects add to the similarity of all\ntwin pairs regardless of rearing status or zygosity. Twins\nreared in the same household will have in common all of the\nrearing environmental variance, whereas twins reared apart\nshare no rearing environmental variance. The covariance\nbetween the nonshared environmental factors for any two\nindividuals is, by definition, zero, thus the Vns term is not\nincluded in the covariance equations.\nBy fitting structural models to the observed MZA, MZT,\nDZA, and DZT covariance matrices, we can estimate the\nproportion of total phenotypic variance accounted for by the\nvariance in genetic factors (i.e., heritability), shared envi-\nronment factors, correlated environment factors, and non-\nshared environment factors, respectively. Covariance matri-\nces were subjected to multivariate model fitting procedures,\nusing LISREL 8 (J\u00f6reskog & S\u00f6rbom, 1993). Tests of sub-\nsets of the structural model were conducted to determine\nwhether the fit of the model to the data was significantly re-\nduced when one or more of the paths was removed from the\nmodel (Neale, Heath, Hewitt, Eaves, & Fulker, 1989). Sig-\nnificant reduction in model fit is indicated by a significant\nchange in chi-square value.\nTo investigate the relationship between olfactory func-\ntioning and cognitive abilities, a standard Cholesky bivari-\nate model (Neale & Cardon, 1992) was implemented. As\nshown in Figure 1, the model includes genetic, correlated\nenvironmental, shared rearing environmental, and non-\ncovMZT Va Vc Vs\ncovMZA Va\n= Vc\n/ Va Vc Vs\n/ Va Vc,\n+\n=\n+ +\n=\n+\n+ +\n=\nshared environmental influences on cognitive ability and\nseparate genetic and environmental influences specific to\nolfactory functioning. The diagonal paths from the genetic\nand environmental influences for cognitive ability to olfac-\ntory functioning generate the Cholesky decomposition of\nthe correlation between olfactory functioning and cognitive\nfunctioning. Paths from the latent age variable to both cog-\nnitive and olfactory functioning allow for the estimation of\nage variance in both traits. In total, the model permits the\nestimation of age, genetic, and environmental components\nof the correlation between cognitive ability and olfactory\nfunctioning.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Statistics\nMean performance on the four measures of olfactory\nfunctioning is presented in Table 1. There were no signifi-\ncant differences in the measures between zygosity groups.\nThe mean number of odorants detected by respondents was\nage of 2.49 (SD  1.11) of the odorants. In their analysis of\nthe 1.2 million responses to the National Geographic Smell\nSurvey, Wysocki and Gilbert (1989) reported that respon-\ndents between the ages of 40 and 80 correctly identified be-\ntween 2 and 3 odorants. Perceived pleasantness in the\ngraphic sample, mean perceived intensity ranged from 3.2\nPerceived intensity is an idiosyncratic measure. Minor dif-\nferences between the National Geographic sample and the\nSATSA sample may result from cultural differences (e.g.,\nBarber, 1997), variations in the actual strength of the odor-\nants due to aging of the test forms, or random error.\nAll variables were corrected for the effect of sex and\nsmoking history by regressing the variables on sex and\npackyears and then using the residual score for subsequent\nanalyses. In their analysis of these data, Larsson and associ-\nates (2000) found no reliable influence of sex on the olfac-\nFigure 1. Cholesky bivariate path diagram.

In the cal-\nculation of phenotypic and intraclass correlations, variables\nwere corrected for the effects of age, as well. Age was in-\ncorporated in the quantitative genetic model; therefore, for\nthe genetic analyses, variables were corrected for sex and\npackyears only. Two types of quantitative genetic analyses\nwere conducted: univariate analysis of olfactory functioning\nand bivariate analysis of the relationship between olfactory\nfunctioning and cognitive abilities.\nUnivariate Analysis\nThe first step in the univariate genetic analysis was to ex-\namine the intraclass correlations, which are presented in Ta-\nble 2. If the MZ twin correlation is greater than the DZ twin\ncorrelation, then genetic effects are indicated. If the DZ cor-\nrelation is greater than half the MZ correlation, then corre-\nlated environmental effects are indicated. If correlations for\ntwins reared together are greater than correlations for twins\nreared apart, then rearing environmental effects are indi-\ncated. Examination of the correlations presented in Table 2\nindicated some evidence for genetic effects on all four mea-\nsures of olfactory functioning. In each case, the MZ correla-\ntion was greater than the DZ correlation. Only three of the\ncorrelations were significantly greater than zero, however,\nand the difference between MZ and DZ correlations did not\nattain significance. The pattern of correlations provided lit-\ntle evidence of rearing environment or correlated environ-\nment effects.\nPatterns evident in the intraclass correlations were further\nexamined through quantitative genetic analysis of the co-\nvariance matrices, and the results are presented in Figure 2.\nThe total variance in each measure of olfactory functioning\nwas divided into variance explained by age, genetic factors,\nshared rearing environmental factors, and nonshared envi-\nronmental factors. Correlated environmental effects did not\ncontribute to the variance in any of the measures of olfac-\ntory functioning. Age accounted for only 1% of the variance\nin odor identification and perceived pleasantness. Age ex-\nplained 2% of the variance in perceived intensity. The influ-\nence of genetic factors was modest for all four measures of\nolfactory functioning, ranging from 14% for odor detection\nto 29% for odor identification.\nAfter correcting for age variance, the heritabilities for the\nfour measures of olfactory functioning were .14 for odor de-\ntection, .29 for odor identification, .17 for perceived pleas-\nantness, and .25 for perceived intensity. Dropping the ge-\nnetic parameter from the quantitative genetic model and\nassessing the change in model fit tested the significance of\nthe heritability estimates. Results indicated significant heri-\na marginally significant heritability for perceived intensity,\nand perceived pleasantness failed to attain significance.\nBivariate Analysis\nWe began the bivariate analysis by examining the pheno-\ntypic correlations between the four measures of olfactory\nfunctioning and the 12 cognitive measures included in\nSATSA, presented in Table 3. Both olfactory functioning\nand cognitive measures were corrected for age, sex, and\npackyears. Of the 10 correlations that attained significance\nat the .05 level, 8 involved odor identification. For the most\npart, odor identification correlated with those cognitive\nTable 2. Twin Intraclass Correlations\nNotes: Variables were corrected for age, sex, and packyears.

Total variance in odor de-\ntection, odor identification, perceived pleasantness, and perceived in-\ntensity has been divided into age, genetic (G), shared rearing envi-\nronment (Es), and nonshared environment (Ens) components.\nTable 3. Phenotypic Correlations Between the Cognitive Variables\nand the Measures of Olfactory Functioning\nOlfactory Functioning\nCognitive Measures\nNumber\nDetected\nNumber\nIdentified\nMean\nPleasantness\nMean\nIntensity\nNote: Variables were corrected for age, sex, and packyears.\nmeasures having a strong verbal component: Information,\nSynonyms, Analogies, and Thurstone's Picture Memory.\nUsing principal-components analysis, these four measures\nwere combined into a verbal factor. The cognitive measures\nwere corrected for age and packyears before being entered\ninto the principal-components analysis. The analysis re-\nsulted in a single factor that explained 62% of the total vari-\nance. Factor loadings for the four cognitive measures were\nand .64 for Thurstone's Picture Memory. The correlations\nbetween the verbal factor and the four measures of olfactory\nfunctioning are also presented in Table 3. As expected, the\nverbal factor was strongly correlated with odor identifica-\ntion. In addition, there was a modest correlation between the\nverbal factor and perceived pleasantness.\nThe next step was to examine the cross-twin, cross-trait\ncorrelations between odor identification and the relevant\ncognitive measures. A cross-twin, cross-trait correlation is\nthe correlation of Trait 1 (odor identification) in Twin A\nwith Trait 2 (cognitive ability) in Twin B. The same logic\nused in the examination of univariate intraclass twin corre-\nlations was applied to the examination of the bivariate\ncross-twin, cross-trait correlations presented in Table 4. For\nexample, if the MZ cross-twin correlation is greater than the\nDZ cross-twin correlation, then there is evidence for genetic\nmediation of the correlation between the two traits. The pat-\ntern of cross-twin correlations for Synonyms, Analogies,\nthe verbal factor, and to some extent general cognitive abil-\nity suggest a genetic contribution to the phenotypic correla-\ntion. The pattern of correlations found for the other cogni-\ntive measures was unclear.\nThe quantitative genetic model presented in Figure 1 was\nfit to the bivariate covariance matrices, and the results are\npresented in Figure 3. The correlations between odor identi-\nfication and the relevant cognitive measures were divided\ninto contributions by age, genetic factors, shared rearing en-\nviromental factors, and nonshared environmental factors.\nThe univariate analysis provided no evidence for an influ-\nence of correlated environment on odor identification;\ntherefore, the correlated environmental component could\nnot logically contribute to the correlation between odor\nidentification and the cognitive measures. As a conse-\nquence, the diagonal path from the correlated environmental\ncomponent for cognition to olfactory functioning (see Fig-\nure 1) was not included in the model. Results indicated that\nage made a minimal contribution to the correlation for only\nfive of the variables: Analogies, Digit Symbol, Block De-\nsign, Digit Span, and Thurstone's Picture Memory. The cor-\nrelations between odor identification and all but two of the\ncognitive measures arose primarily from genetic factors.\nThe two exceptions were Information and Digit Span. The\ncorrelation between odor identification and Information re-\nsulted entirely from environmental factors, and the correla-\ntion between odor identification and Digit Span resulted\nfrom both genetic and environmental factors.\nThe correlations between odor identification and the two\nsummary cognitive measures, general cognitive ability and\nthe verbal factor, were primarily genetically mediated. Fur-\nthermore, in the bivariate path model including either gen-\neral cognitive ability or the verbal factor, all of the genetic\nvariance on odor identification came through the cognitive\nmeasure. In other words, there was no genetic variance for\nodor identification that was independent of genetic variance\nfor the cognitive measures.\nDISCUSSION\nThe goals of the present investigation were a univariate\ngenetic analysis of olfactory functioning and a bivariate ge-\nnetic analysis of the relationship between olfactory and cog-\nnitive functioning. The univariate analysis indicated at most\nmoderate heritability for odor identification (.29) and per-\nceived intensity (.25). Similarly, the twin correlations re-\nported by Segal and colleagues (1995) suggested a heritabil-\nity of approximately .30 for odor identification.

It appears that\nthere is little change in the heritability of odor identification\nthroughout the adult lifespan; however, more data are\nneeded to verify this conclusion. Longitudinal twin data on\nolfactory functioning would provide the most accurate in-\nvestigation of possible age trends in genetic influences on\nolfactory functioning. In the absence of longitudinal data,\ntwin data on odor identification in middle adulthood would\nallow us to test the hypothesis that heritability of odor iden-\ntification is stable across several age cohorts in adulthood.\nHeritability estimates for odor detection and perceived\npleasantness, in contrast to those for odor identification,\nfailed to attain significance in the present study. Measures\nof perceived pleasantness attempt to assess the idiosyncratic\nhedonic experience of olfactory functioning. It is not sur-\nprising, then, that most of the variance in perceived pleas-\nantness can be attributed to nonshared environmental influ-\nences. The absence of significant genetic variance for odor\ndetection is more difficult to interpret. The evidence for ge-\nnetic and environmental influences on odor detection from\nprevious studies was inconsistent across odorants. In the\npresent investigation, odor detection performance was summed\nacross six odorants commonly used in investigations of ol-\nfactory functioning. However, participants detected on\naverage five of the six odorants. Consequently, the total\nvariance in odor detection performance may have been re-\nstricted, diminishing our power to detect significant genetic\nvariance. A more powerful assessment of odor detection\nwould involve administration of increasing concentrations\nof the test odorants. Segal and colleagues (1995) used this\nmethod to assess detection of a single odorant and found no\ndifference in MZ and DZ correlations. Replication of their\nstudy, incorporating detection of several odorants, might\nprovide sufficient power to detect reliable genetic influ-\nences on odor detection.\nThe majority of the variance in olfactory functioning in\nthe second half of the lifespan was explained by environ-\nmental factors, predominantly nonshared environmental\nfactors. Although the data were corrected for the effects of\nsmoking--one possible nonshared environmental influence\non olfactory functioning--many other potential environ-\nmental factors have been proposed. Diseases such as central\nnervous system disorders, diabetes, stroke, and epilepsy\nmay affect olfactory functioning (Murphy, 1999; Savic,\nanalysis of data from SATSA, Larsson and associates\n(2000) found that central nervous system disorders were re-\nliably related to impairments in odor detection, and epilepsy\nwas associated with impaired odor identification. Lifestyle\nfactors may also be a source of nonshared environmental in-\nfluences. Corwin, Loury, and Gilbert (1995) reported that\nolfactory functioning was significantly affected by occupa-\ntional experience. Factory workers demonstrated signifi-\ncantly impaired odor detection and lower self-ratings of ol-\nfactory ability as compared with office workers and those in\nother occupations.\nInvestigation of the relationship between cognitive abili-\nties and olfactory functioning indicated strong positive cor-\nrelations between measures of verbal ability and odor iden-\ntification (Larsson et al., 2000). The specificity of this\nrelationship was indicated by the absence of significant cor-\nrelations for other measures of cognitive abilities (spatial\nabilities, short-term memory) and other measures of olfac-\ntory functioning (odor detection, perceived pleasantness,\nand perceived intensity). A significant correlation between\nDigit Symbol and odor identification was also found. Al-\nthough the relationship between perceptual speed and odor\nidentification may not be readily apparent, research has in-\ndicated that the olfactory system is extremely slow relative\nto other sensory modalities (Herz & Engen, 1996; Laing &\nMacLeod, 1992). Thus, faster perceptual speed may result\nin better performance on measures of olfactory functioning.\nAlternatively, perceptual speed may influence olfactory\nfunctioning indirectly, through verbal ability. Evidence sug-\ngests that perceptual speed mediates much of the age-related\nConsequently, the correlation between Digit Symbol and\nodor identification may reflect the underlying relationships\nbetween perceptual speed and verbal ability and between\nverbal ability and olfactory functioning.\nBivariate quantitative genetic analysis indicated that the\nrelationship between odor identification and cognitive abil-\nity was primarily genetically mediated. Indeed, all of the ge-\nnetic influences on odor identification could be attributed to\ngenetic influences on verbal ability. The strong genetic me-\ndiation of the correlation between odor identification and\nverbal ability provides additional support for the hypothesis\nthat odor identification and verbal ability in general tap the\nsame cognitive domain (Larsson, 1997). The hypothesis is\nfurther supported by the finding of Larsson and associates\n(2000) that verbal ability remained a significant predictor\nfor odor identification performance after statistical control\nof the effects of chronological age, sex, education, and glo-\nbal cognitive functioning. Results of the regression analysis\n(Larsson et al., 2000) and the quantitative genetic analysis\nreported here indicate the pivotal role played by verbal abil-\nity in successful odor identification.\nIn addition, the results of the present analyses provide\nsome insight into the nature of age differences in olfactory\nfunctioning. Odor identification reflects the combination of\nthe bottom-up process of sensory functioning and the top-\ndown process of cognitive abilities (Richardson & Zucco,\n1989). Univariate and bivariate quantitative genetic analy-\nses reported here suggest the possibility that genetic influ-\nences on odor identification result from genetic effects on\nthe top-down, or cognitive, component of the process. In\ncontrast, environmental influences may act on the bottom-\nup, or sensory, component of the process. Therefore, de-\nclines in sensory functioning, per se, likely result from the\naccumulated effects of nonshared environmental influences,\nsuch as health or lifestyle variables. Declines in the cogni-\ntive component of performance on some olfactory measures\nmay reflect genetically influenced cognitive decline. Mean\ndeclines in cognitive ability can result from genetic factors,\neven if (as our data suggest) the heritability of odor identifi-\ncation remains stable. The genetic influence is on the rate of\nchange. Analyses of longitudinal twin data from SATSA,\nfor example, indicated a significant genetic influence on the\nrate of decline in performance on measures of verbal ability\n(Reynolds, Gatz, & Pedersen, 1998). Further research will\nbe required to verify the differing impact of genetic and en-\nvironmental influences on the components of olfactory\nfunctioning. In addition, it will be valuable to determine\nhow olfactory functioning at one point in time is related to\ncognitive decline and the extent to which genes mediate that\nassociation.\n"
