The high prevalence of\nobesity in the United States (3) has led to concern about the\npotential effect of alcohol on dietary intake. However, little is\nknown about diets of drinkers on days that they drink because\nsuitable population-level epidemiologic data have not been\navailable to explore the relation.\nWhether alcohol is associated with same-day diet is an im-\nportant and considerably different question than that posed by\nprevious epidemiologic studies (4\u00ad14) and a clinical trial (15)\nthat investigated whether usual alcohol consumption averaged\nover days to a year was associated with diet. Same-day effects of\nalcohol on diet are biologically plausible. Alcohol acutely sup-\npresses fatty acid oxidation, increases short-term thermogenesis,\nand affects food-related hormones and neurotransmitters in-\ncluding leptin, serotonin, and neuropeptide Y (16). In terms of\npublic health messages, same-day associations between alcohol\nand diet could be useful targets for efforts to improve dietary\nintake.\nSeveral human experimental studies have reported that\nmoderate alcohol consumption increased same-day nonalcohol\nenergy intake (4, 16\u00ad22). These studies typically administered an\nalcohol preload before or with lunch. Food intake was imme-\ndiately stimulated, and the effect lasted w1\u00ad2 h. In 2 studies\n(17, 18), energy intake was not sufficiently reduced during the\nremainder of the day to completely compensate for the excess\nalcohol and food consumed; however, in one study (17), excess\nenergy intake was compensated for by a reduced intake on the\nsubsequent day. These experimental studies provided little in-\nformation about the association of alcohol with nutrient or food-\ngroup intakes because food choices were limited, and it was not\ntheir purpose.\nIt would be possible to compare dietary intake on drinking\ncompared with nondrinking days within individuals in the US\npopulation if an epidemiologic study included repeated measures\nof alcohol and diet. The advantage of repeated measures is that\neach person acts as his or her own control (ie, each person is\nmatched to himself or herself), which removes confounding as\na result of individual-level characteristics both observable (eg,\ndemographics and lifestyle) and unobservable (eg, genetics and\n1 From the Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research, National\nInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (RAB and TJ), the Division of\nCancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Biostatistics Branch, National Cancer\nInstitute (BIG), NIH, Bethesda, MD; the CSR Inc, Arlington, VA (CMC);\nand the Department of Family, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences, Queens\nCollege of the City University of New York, Flushing, NY (AKK).\n2 Computerprogramming and data analysis by CSR Inc (CMC) were funded\nof the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n3 Address correspondence to RA Breslow, Division of Epidemiology and\nPrevention Research, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,\nmail.nih.gov.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nSupplemental Material can be found at:\nrecalls that were obtained generally 3\u00ad10 d apart and provided\nan opportunity for such an analysis. We used these recalls to\nexamine diets of 1864 current drinkers who consumed alcohol\non one of the 24-h recalls but not the other.\nSurvey\nOur study used combined data from NHANES conducted in\nconducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, is\na continuing cross-sectional nationally representative survey of\nthe health and nutrition of the US noninstitutionalized civilian\npopulation (23). NHANES uses a complex, stratified, multistage\nprobability sample design. The survey includes an in-person\nvisit to a mobile exam center (MEC) where participants receive\na health examination and are asked interviewer-administered\nquestions on several topics including alcohol use and dietary\nintake. Unweighted response rates for the MEC sample were\nAlcohol consumption assessment\nDuring the MEC visit, adults aged $20 y are asked about\nusual alcohol consumption over their lifetime as follows: \"In any\none year, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcoholic\nbeverage?\"; \"In your entire life, have you had at least 12 drinks\nof any type of alcoholic beverage?\"; \"In the past 12 months, how\noften did you drink any type of alcoholic beverage?\"; and \"In\nthe past 12 months, on those days that you drank alcoholic\nbeverages, on the average how many drinks did you have?\" (27).\nIndividuals were considered current drinkers if they consumed\n$12 drinks in their entire life and drank on $1 d in the past\nyear. In women, light drinking was defined as #3 drinks/wk,\nmoderate drinking was defined as .3\u00ad7 drinks/wk, and heavier\ndrinking was defined as .7 drinks/wk; in men, corresponding\nDietary assessment\nThe MEC visit includes an interviewer-administered dietary\nrecall that uses the USDA Automated Multiple-Pass Method (28)\nto estimate all foods and beverages (including alcohol) consumed\nduring the 24-h period before the interview (midnight to midnight)\n(29). On completion of the recall, participants are scheduled for\na second recall to be administered by telephone 3\u00ad10 d later on\na different day of the week. Intakes available from recalls include\ntotal energy, total protein, total carbohydrate, total fat, saturated,\nmonounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, dietary fiber, calcium,\npotassium, sodium, and alcohol. We estimated energy from\nalcohol as\nWe estimated nonalcohol energy in alcoholic beverages as\nfollows: we identified all alcoholic beverages by using USDA\nused in cooking)], determined the total energy contribution of\neach, and subtracted energy from alcohol.\nThe 24-h recall data were used to estimate intakes of\nMyPyramid food groups by merging the data with the USDA\nMyPyramid Equivalents Database, which specifies food groups\non the basis of US Dietary Guidelines (30, 31). The MyPyramid\nEquivalents Database contains 32 major food groups (eg, total\ngrain and total vegetables) and subgroups (eg, whole grains); we\nreduced the number to 21 by retaining all major groups and\ncombining several subgroups on the basis of their nutritional\ncharacteristics.\nDietary outcomes\nOur dependent variables of interest were intakes of total energy,\nnonalcohol energy, macronutrients [total protein, total carbo-\nhydrate, total fat, and subtypes (saturated, monounsaturated,\nand polyunsaturated fats)], dietary fiber, and calcium as well as\nintakes of potassium and sodium. When energy intakes were\ncalculated, we used the following definitions:\nAlcohol = ethanol \u00f02\u00de\nAlcoholic beverages \u00bc ethanol \u00fe naturally occurring\nmacronutrients in the beverage \u00f0eg; carbohydrates in beer\u00de\n\u00fe mixers \u00f03\u00de\nTotal nonalcohol energy \u00bc total energy\n2 energy from ethanol\nStudy design and sample\nThe study used a repeated-measures analysis to estimate\nwithin-individual changes in dietary and nutrient intakes of\ncurrent drinkers who consumed alcohol on one dietary recall day\n(drinking day) but not the other (nondrinking day).\nTo obtain an appropriate sample, we first identified all re-\nspondents who completed MEC interviews in NHANES 2003\u00ad\ncompleted interviews, we excluded 14,133 individuals who were\n,20 y of age followed by 116 individuals who were breast-\nwhose diet recalls on both days were not reliable or not avail-\nindividuals who were not current drinkers in the past year or\nwhose drinking status was unknown.

The season was considered by using 6-mo segments,\nwhich was the only variable available in the dataset.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were weighted by 2-d dietary recall sample\nweights. All analyses were sex specific. For demographic, life-\nstyle, and dietary recall characteristics, unadjusted percentage\ndistributions with 95% CIs were calculated. For dietary intake\nanalyses, multiple linear regression models estimated within-\nindividual differences in energy, nutrient, and food-group intakes\nbetween drinking and nondrinking days by regressing each day\ndietary variable on dummy variables for the recall day of the\nweek, a dummy variable for recall order (day 1 recall compared\nwith day 2 recall), and a separate fixed effect for each person in\nthe sample, which controlled for person-level characteristics such\nas demographic, lifestyle, and genetic characteristics. The season\nof MEC exam was not informative and, therefore, not included in\nmodels. Interactions between variables were estimated and tested\nby including product terms between variables in regression models.\nInteractions with BMI (in kg/m2) and marital status were con-\nsidered; few interactions were shown, and no interactions were\nparticularly strong. The survey-adjusted Wald's F test was used to\ntest hypotheses.

Both sexes had less-healthy\ndiets on drinking days; however, men's diets appeared to be\npoorer than women's diets.\nOur finding that men consumed excess nonalcohol energy on\ndrinking days is consistent with results from several experimental\nstudies (4, 17\u00ad22). Our finding that women did not consume\nexcess nonalcohol energy on drinking days could have been due\nto a number of factors including their lower total energy intake,\nlower consumption of alcohol, or greater dietary vigilance. Also,\nthe experimental studies were mostly conducted in men, al-\nthough one study that included women (21) reported a positive\neffect in both sexes.\nWe showed that nutrient intakes differed on drinking and\nnondrinking days. The most striking findings were w9\u00ad10%\nhigher drinking day intakes of total protein, total fat, saturated\nfat, and protein in men and w7\u00ad8% higher drinking day intakes\nof total fat, monounsaturated fat, and potassium and an 11%\nhigher intake of polyunsaturated fat in women. Higher intakes of\ntotal fat and saturated fat are of particular concern in terms of\ndietary recommendations.\nOur examination of food-group intakes showed changes in\nfoods reported on drinking days. Men consumed more from the\nmeat, poultry, and fish group, particularly more meat. Men also\nconsumed more discretionary oil and solid fat and white potatoes\nand less fruit. Although men consumed less milk, their total milk-\ngroup (milk, yogurt, and cheese) intake was unchanged, which\nsuggested the substitution of milk for other dairy products on\ndrinking days. Food selections of women on drinking days were\nalso remarkable for more discretionary oil and solid fat and fewer\nproducts from the milk, yogurt, and cheese group, particularly\nmilk. We note that women's reduced consumption of milk\nshould have been reflected in lower intakes of calcium, but this\nwas not the case. This finding may be explained by the low\namounts of milk (,1 cup) women consumed on both drinking\nand nondrinking days. Although food-group data are derived\nand, therefore, less precise than nutrient data, they have public\nhealth benefits regarding potential messages to moderate drinkers\nabout eating behaviors on drinking days. Our sample consisted\nalmost entirely of moderate drinkers.\nOur study used a matched design, and the results were not\ndirectly comparable to those of other epidemiologic studies. We\nexamined diets of individual drinkers on a single day on which\nthey drank compared with a single day on which they did not. It\nwas a within-individual study that used repeated measures with\ndetailed 24-h data for each day. In contrast, previous epidemi-\nologic studies (4\u00ad14) and a clinical trial (15) generally obtained\nestimates whereby alcohol and/or diet were averaged over\na period of time, which reflected usual intakes. The majority of\nstudies showed no association between alcohol consumption\nand higher absolute intakes of total nonalcohol energy with the\nexception of a U-shaped association in women in one study (5)\nand a linear trend across drinking levels in men in another study\n(10). The general lack of association was likely because of\ncompensation over the long term (4).\nStrengths of our study were that we examined within-individual\ndietary differences on a drinking compared with nondrinking day.\nOur repeated-measures design virtually eliminated individual-level\nconfounding, which is a problematic issue in most epidemiologic\nstudies. It was necessary to control only for the effects of the dietary\nrecall administration (order and day of the week). Our study used\na large national sample that was primarily comprised of light to\nmoderate drinkers, who constitute the majority of drinkers, which\nincreased its generalizability.\nLimitations included that drinking was more likely to be\nreported on the first dietary recall and on weekends. The first\nrecall was more likely to occur on a weekend, possibly because\nindividuals considered MEC visits most convenient at that time.\nHowever, all analyses were controlled for the order of dietary\nrecall. All analyses were also controlled for the day of the week.\nNevertheless, we could not dismiss the possibility of residual\nconfounding. We note that our purpose was to describe cross-\nsectional associations between alcohol and dietary intakes on the\nday in which alcohol was consumed. We make no claims about\ncause and effect. Future studies might consider approaches to\nuntangle the complex effects of alcohol on drinking day dietary\nintake from correlations on the basis of weekend and weekday\ndrinking (32), social activity (33), or other relevant factors. We\ncompressed the USDA MyPyramid food groups from 32 to 21 to\nincrease the statistical power. This alteration may have limited\nour ability to determine certain differences (eg, between types of\nfats). Our study did not address dietary intake according to\ndrinking levels because of its matched design.\nIn conclusion, we showed that diets of current drinkers were\npoorer on a day they consumed alcohol than on a day they did not.\nTargeting drinking days to improve dietary intake may prove\na useful public health strategy.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--RAB, CMC, and BIG:\nanalyzed data; RAB: wrote the manuscript and had primary responsibility\nfor the final content of the manuscript; and all authors: designed the research,\nprovided critical input in the writing of the manuscript, and read and ap-\nproved the final manuscript.
