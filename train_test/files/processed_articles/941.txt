Keith, PhD1\nPurpose: We investigated whether health status (i.e., need\ncharacteristics) and financial resources (i.e., enabling\ncharacteristics) were important predictors of two types of\nfunctional adaptations among elderly adults: home modi-\nfications such as putting nonslip tape on rugs or installing\nmore telephones and use of equipment for mobility or ac-\ntivities of daily living (ADLs) such as canes or walkers.\nDesign and Methods: Participants were identified from\nthe National Survey of Self-Care and Aging (n  3,485),\na nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized\nU.S. adults aged 65 and older. Need and enabling char-\nacteristics were used to predict home modifications and\nequipment use in multinomial logistic analysis, controlling\nfor predisposing characteristics. Results: Although sev-\neral health-status (need) variables had significant, direct\neffects on functional adaptations, the effects of ADL limi-\ntations were diminished at higher levels of impairment.\nAmong the financial (enabling) variables, subjective income\nmeasures and supplemental insurance had significant, di-\nrect effects on functional adaptations. Implications:\nPromotion of functional adaptations among elderly peo-\nple may benefit from both a proactive approach that tar-\ngets elders with few limitations and a consideration of\nfinancial factors in addition to health status.\nKey Words: Elderly adults, Disability, Functional\nadaptations\nThe significance of the aging of the U.S. popula-\ntion has been stated repeatedly. It is estimated that\nby the year 2030, the number of older Americans\nwill nearly double, and older adults will make up\nabout 20% of the entire U.S. population (Abeles,\nGift, & Ory, 1994, p. 1). Such a demographic trend\nbrings with it many issues and challenges for health\nand health care; although people are living longer,\nthey are also living with more chronic health condi-\ntions and disabilities (Zimmer & Chappell, 1994).\nThese developments have implications for both the\nformal health care system, such as increased ambu-\nlatory health care and short-term hospitalization\n(Weiss & Lonnquist, 2000), and informal health\ncare, such as increased provision of elderly care by\nadult children and greater use of home health care\nservices.\nAlthough overall chronic disability among older\nage groups has decreased in the last few decades\ndisability and maintenance of functional indepen-\ndence among elderly adults remain salient issues be-\ncause of the growing proportion of older age groups.\nIncreasingly, research has emphasized the impor-\ntance of health promotion (Nicholas, 1993) and\nmaintenance of functional independence (Zimmer &\nChappell, 1994) in older adults. Informal health care\npractices have increasingly been cited as a way of\nmaintaining health and functioning among elders\nwhile simultaneously reducing medical expenditures\n(Edwardson, Dean, & Brauer, 1995; Jirovec &\nIn this study, we examined a specific type of infor-\nmal care based on one of the three domains concep-\ntualized by the Self-Care Assessment of Community-\nBased Elderly Study (DeFriese, Konrad, Woomert,\nfunctional adaptations that promote functional capa-\nbility, including home modifications and equipment\nuse for mobility or activities of daily living (ADLs).\nWe focus on the importance of health status and\nfinancial resources (i.e., need and enabling character-\nistics) in determining the practice of home modifica-\ntions and equipment use for mobility or ADLs.\nBuilding on the health behavior model (HBM), we\nhypothesized that poor health and physical limita-\nWe thank two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and\nsuggestions on earlier versions of this paper.\nAddress correspondence to Kathleen M.

More importantly, we hypothe-\nsized that income and health insurance have positive\neffects on the practice of functional adaptations, as\nthese financial resources can enable elders to make\nadaptations.\nElderly persons often experience decreases in func-\ntional ability and greater difficulty in performing ev-\neryday tasks (Verbrugge, Rennert, & Madans,\n1997). The importance of functional adaptations in\nmoderating this increasing difficulty has been stated\nfrequently. For instance, Manton, Corder, and Stal-\ndependence on equipment, both by itself and in com-\nbination with personal assistance, increased, whereas\ninstitutionalization rates were stable, and mortality\nand chronic disability prevalence rates declined.\nThey concluded that incentives for equipment use\namong elderly people can increase their social auton-\nomy. Similarly, use of equipment assistance has been\nshown to be effective for reducing and resolving lim-\nitations, and, compared with personal assistance\nfrom others, allows elders to maintain a greater sense\nof self-sufficiency (Verbrugge et al., 1997). The bene-\nfits of functional adaptations are not only realized at\nthe individual level, but have also been shown to af-\nfect medical expenditures. In a recent study, Stearns\nand colleagues (2000) found that certain lifestyle\npractices and functional adaptations among elderly\nadults were associated with reductions in Medicare\nexpenditures.\nIn sum, functional adaptations are related to many\npositive outcomes for seniors, as well as concomitant\nreductions in health care expenditures and less need\nfor institutionalization. Thus, research has begun to\nfocus on social factors associated with the likelihood\nof using adaptations such as assistive devices (Gitlin,\nSchemm, Landsberg, & Burgh, 1996; Mann, Hurren,\nZimmer & Chappell, 1994), home modifications,\nand personal assistance from others (Kincade Nor-\nthese studies are informative, more research is\nneeded to increase our understanding of patterns of\nfunctional-adaptation use. Knowledge about these\npatterns can help inform interventions and education\naimed at increasing functional ability and indepen-\ndence among elderly people.\nNeed and Enabling Characteristics\nA conceptual model is valuable for developing an\nunderstanding of the social patterns linked to the use\nof functional adaptations. Andersen's (1968) HBM,\ndeveloped to help explain trends in health services\nuse, has been applied to several facets of informal\n2000). Initial attempts have shown that the behav-\nioral model is useful for studying the use of assistive\ndevices among elderly adults (Gitlin et al., 1996;\nUnder the behavioral model, predisposing charac-\nteristics are factors existing prior to the onset of ill-\nness that may contribute to an individual's propen-\nsity to use health services, enabling characteristics\nrefer to individual resources (income, health insur-\nance status) and community resources that allow in-\ndividuals to access services, and need characteristics\nrefer to both perceived and evaluated health status\nThis study builds on growing research using the\nbehavioral model to examine trends in informal\nhealth practices. We focused specifically on the im-\nportance of health status and financial resources (i.e.,\nneed and enabling characteristics) in predicting the\nuse of functional adaptations. We chose to concen-\ntrate on need and enabling characteristics for two\nreasons. First, past research has found support for\nthe additive hypothesis which states that increased\nneed translates into increased use of adaptations\n(Gitlin et al., 1996; Hartke, Prohaska, & Furner,\nadaptations or devices may be costly and may not be\ncovered by Medicare. Whereas other studies focusing\non functional adaptations as an outcome have used\nincome level as a predictor (Hartke et al., 1998; Kin-\ncade Norburn et al., 1995; Zimmer & Chappell,\n1994), it has typically been included as a demo-\ngraphic control measure. We sought to explore the\nenabling role of financial factors in more depth by\nincluding not only an objective income measure, but\nalso several subjective measures relating to respon-\ndents' perceptions of income sufficiency. Addition-\nally, we examined the potential enabling role of sup-\nplemental health insurance for elders who want or\nneed to implement functional adaptations. This ex-\npanded examination of enabling characteristics builds\non intriguing new research showing that extraindi-\nvidual factors such as access to care and health insur-\nance are associated with greater odds of survival and\nreduced likelihood of transitioning from indepen-\ndence to disability among Medicare beneficiaries\n(Porell & Miltiades, 2001). We are building on this\nnew research studying the effects of extraindividual\nenabling factors and making a significant innovation\nin that our outcome of interest is use of functional\nadaptations instead of functional ability.\nAs stated, our hypotheses were that (a) poor\nhealth and physical limitations have positive effects\non the practice of functional adaptations because\nthey reflect a necessity for such adaptations and (b)\nincome and health insurance have positive effects on\nthe practice of functional adaptations because they\ncan enable elders to make adaptations.\nMethods\nData\nThe data for this study are derived from the Na-\ntional Survey of Self-Care and Aging: Baseline,\nstratified random sample of noninstitutionalized\nMedicare beneficiaries 65 years of age and older,\n26  \ndrawn from 50 primary sampling units (38 urban\nand 12 rural) was obtained. The sample was strati-\nfied by gender and age in the final stages, with over-\nsampling of the oldest old (85 years old and older) to\nfacilitate subgroup analysis, and was selected pro-\nportional to the urban/rural distribution of the el-\nderly population. This sample is unique in that it is\nrepresentative of the total noninstitutionalized elderly\npopulation of Medicare beneficiaries in the contigu-\nous United States (Kincade Norburn et al., 1995).\nQuestions pertained to the type and extent of self-\ncare behaviors for ADLs, management of chronic con-\nditions (through self-care activities, equipment use, and\nenvironmental modifications), medical self-care for\nacute conditions, and health promotion/disease pre-\nvention. Social support, health services use, and socio-\ndemographic/economic variables were also included.\nDependent Variable Measures\nHome Modifications.--Respondents were asked about\nchanges that they may have made to their homes in\nthe last 12 months. Changes included rearranging\nfurniture, keeping things within easy reach, and in-\nstalling more telephones. Although we considered\ncoding this measure dichotomously (used any home\nmodifications vs. used none), preliminary results\nshowed that there were substantial differences be-\ntween elders who used different numbers of modifi-\ncations. To capture these differences, we used multi-\nnomial logistic regression (see analysis section) to\ncontrast those using one, two, and three or more\nmodifications with those using zero modifications.\nThe average number of home modifications made\nEquipment Use for Mobility or ADLs.\n-- Respondents\nwere asked whether they had used 20 types of equip-\nment for mobility or ADLs in the past 12 months, in-\ncluding lighter weight housecleaning equipment,\nbath stools, canes, and walkers. As with home modi-\nfications, there were differences in elders who used\ndifferent numbers of equipment types. This measure\nwas thus coded into the same categories as home\nmodifications. The average number of equipment\nIndependent Measures\nTable 1 details the means, standard deviations,\nand coded values for the independent measures.\nPredisposing Characteristics.--Because our focus is\non health status (need characteristics) and financial re-\nsources (enabling characteristics), predisposing charac-\nteristics were primarily used to control for confound-\ning, although we do briefly discuss their effects and the\nmagnitude of their explanatory power. Both demo-\ngraphic and social structural predisposing characteris-\ntics were used. Demographic variables included age\n(continuous), and gender (dichotomous). Social struc-\ntural predisposing characteristics included race, retire-\nment status, education, and living alone. All of these\nvariables were measured dichotomously. There was\nnot an adequate representation of minority elders\nto include multiple racial/ethnic categories. African\nAmericans composed about 5% of the sample; Ameri-\ncan Indians, 0.1%; Asians or Pacific Islanders, 0.3%;\nand Hispanics, 3.4%. Therefore, race was coded as ei-\nminorities as the reference group. Retirement status\nwas measured as being completely retired or still work-\ning in some capacity, and education was measured as\nhaving at least a high school education or having less\nthan a high school education. Living situation was in-\ncluded because it may affect an older person's informal\nhealth behavior (Wolinsky & Johnson, 1991).\nEnabling Characteristics.--The enabling character-\nistics included five indicators of financial status--\n1989 family income, whether the respondent receives\nany income in addition to Social Security, how well\nincome takes care of basic needs, whether the re-\nspondent has enough to buy little extras, and whether\nthe respondent has supplemental health insurance.\nIncome was measured using categories that ranged\nTable 1.

Be-\ncause of a high number of missing cases on income\n(about 20%), missing values were replaced with the\nmean value for the entire sample. Sensitivity testing\nwas conducted by running statistical models first us-\ning income with the mean replacing missing values\nand second replacing missing income with means\ncomputed on the basis of gender, education, and\nrace. There were no significant differences between\nmodels. The three additional income variables were\nincluded to give a more expanded picture of the role\nfinancial resources, as well as individuals' percep-\ntions of the adequacy of their resources, play in de-\ntermining functional adaptations. Income in addition\nto Social Security was a dichotomous measure, as\nwas having enough to buy little extras. The measure\nfor how well income takes care of basic needs was\nordinal, with responses poorly, fairly well, and very\nwell. Supplemental health insurance was measured\ndichotomously, and referred to health insurance that\nrespondents possess in addition to Medicare. In addi-\ntion to these individual enabling characteristics, one\ncommunity-enabling characteristic, rural residence,\nwas included as a dichotomous measure.\nNeed Characteristics.--Need characteristics are an\nimportant component of the behavioral model; for a\nperson to seek care, she or he must first have or per-\nceive some medical need. This study used one ques-\ntion on perceived health status, \"How is your health\nat the present time?\" with responses of 1  excellent,\n2  very good, 3  good, 4  fair, and 5  poor.\nThree ADL-limitation measures were used as objec-\ntive indicators of health status: basic (BADL), mobil-\nity (MADL), and instrumental (IADL). BADLs in-\ncluded eating, dressing, bathing, and maintaining\ncontinence; MADLs included getting to the toilet,\ntransferring from bed or chairs, getting outside, and\nwalking; and IADLs included using a telephone,\nmanaging money, preparing meals, doing light house-\nwork, shopping, and doing heavy housework.\nChronic conditions were also used as an objective\nmeasure of need. This item was measured through\ntwo series of questions. Respondents were first asked\nif they had experienced several conditions in the past\nyear: arthritis/rheumatism, diabetes, asthma/emphy-\nsema/bronchitis, gastric/peptic ulcers, and anemia.\nSecond, respondents were asked if they had ever ex-\nperienced any of the following conditions: osteoporo-\nsis, a broken hip, hypertension, coronary heart disease/\nangina pectoris/heart attack, stroke, cancer, glaucoma,\nand cataracts. A sum of the total illnesses each re-\nspondent had experienced was created through these\nitems, with possible values ranging from 0 to 13. Be-\ncause only about 11% of cases reported five or more\nof these, chronic conditions were recoded into the\nfour, and 5  five or more.\nAs other researchers have noted, some overlap\namong the components of the behavioral model can\nbe expected. If independent variables are correlated\nat the .85 level or higher, however, they are redun-\ndant and should not be included in the same analysis\n(Kline, 1998). To test for possible multicollinearity,\nwe examined bivariate correlations among all inde-\npendent variables, and none of the correlations\nreached the .85 level. Although this method cannot\ncompletely rule out multicollinearity, it did suggest\nthat multicollinearity was not present.\nAnalysis\nMultinomial logistic regression was used to exam-\nine both functional adaptations. This type of analysis\nhas the capacity to analyze outcomes with more than\ntwo discrete categories and describes the odds of re-\nsponse in one category instead of another (Agresti,\ngories, J  1 regression equations are estimated. In\nthis case, the number of categories for each outcome\nvariable was four, so three regression equations were\nestimated (displayed in the columns of Tables 2 and\n3). We used SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) which is\ncapable of fitting all three equations simultaneously.\nIn multinomial logistic analysis, each response cat-\negory is paired with a baseline or reference category,\nwhich in this case was elders who used zero home\nmodifications and zero equipment types, respec-\ntively. Every other category was compared to the ref-\nerence category. The results thus show the odds of\nresponse in the one category compared with the zero\ncategory (Equation 1), the odds of response in the\ntwo category compared with the zero category\n(Equation 2), and the odds of response in the three or\nmore category compared with the zero category\n(Equation 3; Agresti, 1996). Interpretation may be\ndone through odds ratios (exp{}) or by convert-\ning coefficients into a percentage change in odds\nin the equation comparing those who used one ver-\nsus zero home modifications could be interpreted in\ntwo ways: a one-unit increase in the independent\nvariable multiplies the odds of using one home modi-\nfication instead of zero by 1.28 (exp{.25}). Or, a one-\nunit increase in the independent variable increases\nthe odds of using one home modification instead of\nterpretation used is a matter of preference, and we\nuse both types in discussing results.\nThe Nagelkereke pseudo R2 was used to estimate\nthe amount of variance in home modifications and\nequipment use explained by the predictors. This\nmeasure is an adjusted version of the Cox and Snell\nR2, which is based on the log likelihood for the fitted\nmodel compared with the log likelihood for the null\nmodel (with no predictors). Although the Cox and\nSnell R2 has a maximum value of less than 1, even\nfor a perfect model, the Nagelkerke R2 adjusts the\nscale of the statistic to cover the full range from 0 to\n1 (Nagelkerke, 1991). Separate hierarchical analysis\nwas also conducted to determine the relative impor-\ntance of predisposing, enabling, and need character-\nistics in explaining each outcome variable. Although\nthe results of the hierarchical analyses are not shown,\nthey are discussed in the context of other findings.\n28  \nWhereas our first hypothesis states that poor\nhealth is directly related to functional adaptations,\nonce a certain level of need is reached, this relation-\nship may diminish. For example, if a person is bed-\nridden, she or he may be less likely to use adapta-\ntions compared with someone who simply has\ntrouble moving about, reaching items on shelves, and\nso on. Put simply, it is possible that the direct effect\nof poor health is more pronounced for those with\nbetter health and less pronounced for those with\nTable 2.

Thus, we conducted separate analyses\nto test whether an inverted -shaped relationship ex-\nisted between need characteristics and each outcome.\nThis was done by separately entering quadratic terms\n(e.g., BADLS  BADLS) for each need characteristic\ninto the analysis for home adaptations and equip-\nment use, respectively. Quadratic terms show whether\nthe effects of a variable are constant or whether they\nchange across levels of that variable. These results,\ntoo, are not shown but are discussed.\nResults\nHome Modifications\nThe multinomial logistic results for home modifi-\ncations are shown in Table 2. Older age was associ-\nated with increased odds of using two instead of zero\nmodifications in Equation 2, but did not have a sig-\nnificant effect in Equations 1 or 3. There were sig-\nnificant gender differences in Equations 2 and 3;\nwomen were more likely to use modifications. For\ninstance, in Equation 3, being female increased the\nodds of using three or more modifications instead of\nzero by 87%. Living alone was significant only in\nEquation 3. Living alone increased the odds of using\nthree or more instead of zero modifications by 64%.\nIn the hierarchical analysis, predisposing characteris-\ntics explained 7% of the variance in home modifica-\nThe effects of the enabling characteristics in Table\n2 are interesting as well as somewhat counterintui-\ntive. Household income had a significant negative ef-\nfect in Equation 2. That is, higher household incomes\ndecreased the odds of making home modifications.\nThis is the opposite of what we expected. Two other\nincome-related variables, however, were significant\nand positive. Those who believed their income took\ncare of their basic needs had higher odds of using\nmodifications (Equation 3), as did those who had\nenough income to buy little extras (Equation 1).\nThese results seem contradictory. It may be that the\nactual level of household income is less important\nthan respondents' perceptions of the adequacy of\ntheir income; the perceived measures had much more\nsubstantial effects (more robust coefficients) than did\nhousehold income. Additionally, given that the sur-\nvey concerned only the past 12 months, it is possible\nthat those with adequate income were able to imple-\nment adaptations earlier.\nSupplemental insurance had significant positive ef-\nfects on home modifications in Equations 1 and 3,\nlending further support to the enabling role of finan-\ncially related resources. In Equation 3, being a rural\nresident increased the odds of using three or more\nversus zero modifications by 46%. Although several\nenabling characteristics had significant and robust ef-\nfects on home modifications, in hierarchical analysis\nenabling characteristics explained only about 2% of\nthe variance in home modifications over and above\nthat explained by predisposing characteristics (Na-\ngelkerke R2  .088). Thus, enabling characteristics as\na whole did not add substantial explanatory power.\nThis is consistent, however, with past research using\nthe HBM; enabling characteristics typically explain\nonly a small proportion of health behaviors (Ander-\nThe results for the need characteristics show that\nchronic conditions, perceived health, and MADL limi-\ntations were significant for all numbers of home modi-\nfications. In Equation 3, a one-unit increase in chronic\nconditions multiplies the odds of using three or more\nmodifications instead of zero by 1.17; a one-unit in-\ncrease in poor perceived health (e.g., from fair to poor)\nmultiplies the odds of using three or more modifica-\ntions instead of none by 1.31; and a one-unit increase\nin MADL limitations multiplies the odds of using three\nor more home modifications instead of none by 1.68.\nSimilarly, IADL limitations had significant positive ef-\nfects in Equations 2 and 3. In addition, need character-\nistics were very important in predicting use of home\nmodifications; in hierarchical analysis the explained\nvariance rose from about 9% to 24% (Nagelkerke\nR2  .236) when need characteristics were added to\npredisposing and enabling characteristics.\nIn the separate analysis to test whether the effects\nof need characteristics were linear, we found that\nBADL, IADL, and MADL limitations actually had\ninverted -shaped effects. Quadratic terms for these\nADL measures (e.g., ADLs  ADLs) were statisti-\ncally significant and negative, whereas the nonqua-\ndratic terms (e.g., ADLs) remained significant and\npositive. Thus, the direct effects of these ADL limita-\ntions on home modifications were diminished at higher\nlevels of limitation.\nEquipment Use for Mobility or ADL\nTable 3 details the multinomial regression results\nfor equipment use. Age and gender had significant ef-\nfects regardless of the number of equipment types.\nOlder age was associated with increased odds of\nequipment use, as was female gender. Education and\nretirement status were significant in Equation 1.\nHaving at least a high school education decreased the\nodds of using one versus zero equipment types by\n20%, and being completely retired increased the\nodds of using one versus zero equipment types by\n43%. In hierarchical analysis, predisposing charac-\nteristics accounted for about 12% of the variance in\nThe effects of enabling characteristics on equip-\nment use were similar to those for home modifica-\ntions. Whereas household income was significant\nand negative (Equation 3), having income in addition\nto Social Security had positive effects and was signif-\nicant across equations. Again, differences in the mag-\nnitude of the effects are worth noting. In Equation 3,\nfor example, a one-unit increase in household in-\ncome decreased the odds of using three instead of\nzero equipment types by only 7%, compared with a\n55% increase in odds caused by having income in\naddition to Social Security. Furthermore, having sup-\nplemental health insurance appears to act as an im-\n30  \nportant enabling characteristic for the use of equip-\nment. In Equation 3, for example, possessing insurance\nin addition to Medicare multiplied the odds of using\nassistive equipment by 1.76. Similar results between\nhome modifications and equipment use emerged\nwith regard to explanatory power. Enabling charac-\nteristics explained only 2% of the variance in equip-\nment use over and above that explained by predis-\nposing characteristics (Nagelkerke R2  .136).\nAs with home modifications, the importance of\nneed characteristics for equipment use is clear.\nChronic conditions, BADL limitations, IADL limita-\ntions, and MADL limitations all had significant posi-\ntive effects in at least two equations. Furthermore, in\nhierarchical analysis need characteristics accounted\nfor an additional 15% of the variance in equipment\nuse beyond that explained by predisposing and en-\nabling characteristics combined (Nagelkerke R2 \n.294). Similar to the findings for home modifica-\ntions, two need characteristics, MADL and IADL\nlimitations, had inverted -shaped effects. Thus, the\ndirect effects of these ADL measures on equipment\nuse were diminished at higher levels of limitation.\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the correlates of functional\nadaptations among older adults in the context of the\nHBM. Specifically, we sought to explore the impact\nof health status and financial resources on functional\nadaptations, with the rationale that poor health ne-\ncessitates adaptations, whereas financial resources\nenable one to make adaptations. In this section, we\ndiscuss some limitations of the data set used in this\nstudy, as well as the implications of our findings for\nfuture research and for programs aimed at promot-\ning positive health behaviors such as functional ad-\naptations among elders.\nConsiderable support was found for our first hy-\npothesis that poor health and physical limitations\nhave positive effects on the practice of functional ad-\naptations. Many health-related variables (i.e., need\ncharacteristics) are important in predicting functional\nadaptations, including chronic conditions, perceived\nhealth, and MADL limitations for home modifications\nand chronic conditions, IADL limitations, and MADL\nlimitations for equipment use. Moreover, a sizeable\nportion of variance in functional adaptations is ex-\nplained by these need characteristics, as is in keeping\nwith past research using the behavioral model.\nAlthough our findings lend credence to the addi-\ntive hypothesis that increased need translates into in-\ncreased use of adaptations (Gitlin et al., 1996;\nthey also inform this hypothesis by showing that the\neffect of need is not linear, but diminishes at higher\nlevels of impairment. That is, whereas the effects of\nADL limitations on functional adaptations remain\npositive, these effects are more substantial for elders\nwith less disability and less substantial for elders\nwith more disability. From a public health perspec-\ntive, these findings can inform efforts to increase\nfunctional independence among seniors through the\nuse of home modifications and/or equipment use.\nSpecifically, promotion of functional adaptations\nmay benefit from using a proactive approach and\ntargeting those who have few or no limitations, as\nthese lifestyle changes may help seniors adapt to ad-\nditional limitations in the future.\nEnabling characteristics such as health insurance\nand income did not add substantially to the ex-\nplained variance in either type of functional adapta-\ntion. This, however, is consistent with the findings of\npast research using the behavioral model. That is, en-\nabling characteristics typically do not account for\nmuch of the variance in health behaviors. In addi-\ntion, although some findings are counterintuitive, the\neffects of income and health insurance on functional\nadaptations are intriguing and offer some support\nfor our second hypothesis that enabling characteris-\ntics have positive effects on the practice of functional\nadaptations. For both home modifications and\nequipment use, household income had significant\nnegative effects in one equation, whereas other in-\ncome-related factors (income takes care of basic\nneeds, have enough to buy little extras, and income\nin addition to Social Security) had significant positive\neffects. The magnitude of the household income ef-\nfects, however, is much smaller than that of the other\nincome-related variables. As noted, the effect of\nmore subjective income measures, such as a belief\nthat income takes care of basic needs, may be more\nimportant than actual income level. There are other\npossibilities as well. For example, gender may inter-\nact with income. That is, older women are more\nlikely to use adaptations and have lower incomes\nthan older men do. Conversely, older men are less\nlikely to use adaptations and have higher incomes\nthan older women do. We tested an interaction be-\ntween gender and income, however, and none of the\nresults were statistically significant. It is also possible\nthat older men, who have higher incomes and are\nmore likely to have a spouse that is still living, have\nless need for adaptations because they get help from\ntheir spouses. This could contribute to the negative\nrelationship we found between income and adapta-\ntions. Most likely, the relationships are complex and\npotentially involve multiple factors such as age, gen-\nder, marital status, living arrangements, and finan-\ncial resources. Further research is needed to explore\nthe relationship between household income and\nfunctional adaptations in more depth.\nSupplemental insurance does appear to act as an\nenabling factor for both home modifications and\nequipment use, although for home modifications the\nrelationship is not consistent across equations. This\ncould be due to the fact that some home modifications\nare easily made at no cost, such as rearranging furni-\nture or moving items to lower shelves, whereas equip-\nment must almost always be purchased, and is more\noften covered by health insurance. These results build\non recent findings on the role of supplementary health\ninsurance in decreasing the likelihood of becoming\nADL disabled and improving survival outcomes\namong Medicare beneficiaries (Porell & Miltiades,\n2001). Supplemental health insurance appears to act\nas an enabling factor not only with regard to health\nand disability status, but also with regard to adapta-\ntions that can increase independence among elders.\nSome limitations of this study are worth noting.\nFirst, the amount of missing data on the income vari-\nable is high, and although we strove to handle this\nproblem in a methodologically sound way, we can-\nnot conclude that we fully solved this problem. It\nmay be that some of the contrasting findings on ob-\njective and perceived financial measures are due to\nthe large amount of missing data on income. In addi-\ntion, some limitations arise from the fact that sec-\nondary data were used. For instance, there are inde-\npendent measures included in other studies that use\nthe HBM that were not available in the present data,\nsuch as health beliefs, attitudes toward health ser-\nvices, price of health services, and provider-to-popu-\nlation ratios. If we were to design a study with newly\ncollected data, we would include the complete set of\nindependent measures associated with the HBM.\nSimilarly, the data used in this study are cross-sec-\ntional, and thus provide only a \"snapshot\" of statis-\ntical relationships. Furthermore, it is possible that\nsome functional adaptations were made prior to the\n12-month period respondents were asked about and\nwere thus missed in this study. For these reasons, we\nfeel longitudinal investigations have great potential\nfor shedding more light on the complex factors relat-\ning to functional adaptations and how these affect\nhealth and functioning among elderly people.\nThe findings of this study have several important\nimplications for public health and future research.\nFirst, considering that the effects of ADL impair-\nments on home modifications and equipment use are\ndiminished at higher levels of impairment, promo-\ntion of functional adaptations may benefit from tar-\ngeting elders who have few or no limitations. With\nthis type of proactive approach, elders may imple-\nment or be aware of functional adaptations that can\nhelp them cope with additional limitations in the fu-\nture. Second, given our provocative findings on the\neffects of financial enabling characteristics, we sug-\ngest that future research continue to explore how\nboth objective and subjective economic resources in-\nfluence the use of functional adaptations among el-\nders. In particular, because Medicare Part B helps pay\nfor certain types of medically necessary equipment, fu-\nture research should examine to what extent this cov-\nerage removes financial barriers and enables individu-\nals to implement assistive equipment adaptations.\nFinally, programs aimed at promotion of functional\nadaptations to improve the quality of life among el-\nders will likely be more effective if financial factors as\nwell as level of need are taken into consideration.\nReferences\nAbeles, R.
