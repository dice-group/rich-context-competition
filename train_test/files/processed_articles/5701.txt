The most prominent\nattempt to document and explain these similarities is Joseph Campbell's The Hero\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nwith a Thousand Faces (1936). Campbell's work differs in detail from other notable\nattempts to define universal features of heroes (e.g., Dundes, 1980; Fontenrose, 1959;\nmuch the same: wherever you travel in the world's folk literatures, heroes will share\ncertain predictable patterns of characteristics; while the details of heroes \"faces\" may\nchange as the investigator crosses geographical, ethnic, cultural and chronological\nborders, certain details of the hero's life and challenges are everywhere the same.\nHowever, in contrast to the many determined efforts to generalize about heroes,\nscholars have expended little effort generalizing about cross-cultural features of\nheroines. A review of almost 2,000 publications on women and folklore featured not\na single concerted attempt to define cross-cultural features of heroines (De Caro,\n1983), and we are aware of none that have been published since.\nThe present article, based on a quantitative content analysis of folk tales from 48\nculture areas around the world, represents the first systematic attempt to identify and\nexplain cross-cultural trends in the characterization of heroines.\nA Word on Terminology\nFirst, the lack of preexisting cross-cultural studies of common traits of heroines is not\ndue to simple, sexist disregard. In fact, a great deal has been written about female\nThe paucity of attempts to generalize about cross-cultural aspects of heroines stems,\nin large part, from the difficulty of identifying and defining a \"type\" of heroine\ndistinctly enough for cross-cultural analysis (see Ragan, 1998 on the difficulties of\ndevising a suitable definition of the heroine). Heroines are not merely heroes with\nsome different body parts; as we shall see later in the paper, there is a distinct scarcity\nof female characters that are heroic in the same sense we usually associate with male\nheroes. Therefore, in order to avoid sticky problems of definition, and in order to\nattain a large and diverse sample, this study defines the term \"heroine\" in its most\ngeneric sense, as any main female protagonist. As we employ the term, there is\nabsolutely no connotation of special grandeur, virtue, nobility, or courage.\nThe term \"literary universal\" must also be defined. The first property of a literary\nuniversal is that the putative feature need not appear in every literary work nor must it\nappear in all the world's literary traditions. An absolute universal is one that applies\nacross all literary works and traditions. This is a special, and perhaps rare\nphenomenon, which likely applies mainly at the highest levels of abstraction (e.g.,\n\"all peoples have literature,\" \"all literature is focused on conflict,\" \"all peoples have\ncreation myths,\" etc.). This article seeks to document features of the characterization\nof female protagonists that are statistical, not absolute, universals. These are features\nof characterization which recur at rates significantly greater than would be predicted\nby chance, and which cannot be convincingly attributed solely to diffusion (see\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nProblems with Previous Attempts to Define Literary Universals\nWhile there is, at present, a resurgence of interest in the subject of literary\nhave, over the last several decades, viewed the very concept of universals with deep\nsuspicion. This is in stark contrast to a long and prominent universalist tradition that\nargued for distinct regularities in literatures across geographical locations, historical\nepochs, and levels of cultural complexity. There are both ideological and practical\nreasons for this state of affairs. We will address only practical reasons, given that\nideological reasons have been ably discussed by other authors (e.g., Appiah 1992;\nLiterary scholars have found it easy to dismiss the concept of literary\nuniversals largely because the most prominent research in the field has been rife with\ntheoretical and methodological flaws, and thus vulnerable to devastating skeptical\ncritique (see Cook, 1976; Jobling, 2001). However, the failures in previous attempts\nto define literary universals may be attributable less to the absence of common\naspects of world literatures than to widespread use of weak theory and methods.\nPrior to the twentieth century universalist claims were based on commonsense claims\nconcerning universal properties of human psychology. For instance, the nineteenth-\ncentury anthropologist Edward Tylor wrote:\nThe treatment of similar myths from different regions, by arranging\nthem in large compared groups, makes it possible to trace in\nmythology the operation of imaginative processes recurring with the\nevident regularity of mental law; and thus stories of which a single\ninstance would have been a mere isolated curiosity, take their place\namong well-marked and consistent structures of the human mind\nIn the twentieth century, however, psychoanalysis emerged as an explicit and\nsystematic theory of human psychology that attempted to codify and explain the\nprovenance of the universal \"mental law(s)\" taken for granted by the likes of Tylor.\nPsychoanalysis became both the map and the legend for the 20th century's most\nprominent universalists: the map that indicated where to look for universals; the\nlegend that revealed how to interpret what was found. Thus the most widely known\nattempts to systematically define literary universals are heir to the shortcomings of\npsychoanalysis, and have often been guilty of implausible attempts to cram stories\ninto Freudian or Jungian molds. In addition to theoretical weaknesses, previous\nattempts to define literary universals lacked methodological rigor. Conclusions were\nnot based on statistical analyses of representative samples of texts but on highly\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nimpressionistic \"readings\" of handpicked texts, typically over-representing circum-\nThe research presented in this article represents an attempt to improve upon\nprevious research in literary universals by applying theory and methods that have\ninvigorated the search for, and interpretation of, universals in other fields. By\napplying scientific methods of data acquisition and analysis an attempt is made to\navoid (insofar as is possible) some of the problems of subjectivity, selection, and\nconfirmation bias characteristic of previous attempts. By taking evolutionary theories\nof human behavior and psychology as map and legend for this exploration, an attempt\nis made to identify universals that prove more durable and reliable than those based\non psychoanalytic theory and looser methodology.\nExpectations\nThis research seeks universal patterns in dimensions of female protagonist\ncharacterization where evolutionary theory and research suggests one should find\nthem. The expectations of this study were as follows. On the basis of kin selection\ntheory (Hamilton, 1964) it was expected that female protagonists would devote\nsubstantial effort to assisting their kin, especially their close kin, relative to non-kin\nand distant kin. On the basis of research into human mate preferences inspired by\nsexual selection theory, it was predicted that female characters, relative to their male\ncounterparts, would place greater emphasis on a potential mate's wealth, status, and\nkindness (a potential signaller of commitment) than on his physical attractiveness\n(Buss, 1989). On the flip side, given the heavy emphasis males place on the\nattractiveness of potential mates in world cultures, it was expected that there would\nbe markedly greater emphasis on the physical attractiveness of female characters\nrelative to male characters. On the basis of Darwin-Trivers sexual selection theory\n(Darwin, 1871; Trivers, 1972), it was predicted that female protagonists would be\nidentified as less \"active,\" less \"courageous,\" and less likely to be defined as\n\"physically heroic\" than their male counterparts. This is because sexual selection\ntheory predicts that, in most sexually reproducing animals, males will be more prone\nto risk taking behavior in the competition for mates; males' higher likelihood both of\nreproducing prolifically and dying without issue gives them positive and negative\nincentives to compete intensely and riskily for mates, and for the social status and\nresources required to attract and retain them (for reviews of sexual selection literature\nsee Anderson, 1994; Miller, 1999). Finally, it was expected that one side effect of the\nhigher activity, courage, and heroism ratings of males characters would be an\nabundance of male main characters relative to female main characters. It was\nassumed that active characters (as well as the courageous and physically heroic)\nwould be more compelling than passive characters, and thus more likely to play\ncentral roles in narratives. While some of these expectations may seem obvious on\nthe basis of commonsense, they are at odds with the dominant humanities models,\nwhich predict strong inter-cultural variability given the basically arbitrary nature of\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nhuman social and gender arrangements.\nData and Methods\nFolk tale collections were chosen so as to maximize the geographical\nvariability of the sample as well as variability in levels of cultural complexity.\nSpecialized collections focusing on specific themes, plots, or character types (e.g.,\nHopi Trickster Tales, Hero Tales of the South Slavs) were rejected in favor of generic\ncollections (Hopi Folk Tales, Traditional Tales of the South Slavs). All collections\nwere of traditional tales, originally transmitted through the oral tradition. In all, the\nstudy includes tales from 48 different culture areas from all inhabited continents,\nvarying widely in ecology, geographic location, racial and ethnic composition,\npolitical systems, religious beliefs, and levels of cultural complexity. All non-English\ntales had been translated into English, and the sample ran the gamut from polished\nfairy tales to literal transcriptions of tales told in traditional contexts. A list of the\ncollections and tales coded can be accessed at this URL or by contacting the lead\nauthor: http://www.science.mcmaster.ca/psychology/ehb/gottschall(folktales).pdf.\nOnce suitable collections were identified, each data collector (10 female and 5\nmale undergraduates at St. Lawrence University) scanned the thirty longest tales from\neach of 3 culture areas. (Several researchers were responsible for tales from four\nculture areas. They volunteered to code collections of tales that only arrived through\ninterlibrary loan after the main portion of the study had been completed.) The coders\nwere participants in a seminar focusing on content analysis methodology and the\ndepiction of female characters in world folk tales. Coders were told that the study's\naim was to determine whether or not there were cross-cultural patterns in the\ndepiction of female characters. They were told that either finding--either of\nprevailing cross-cultural regularity or of prevailing variability--would be an\nimportant contribution. They were not made aware of the specific theory-derived\nexpectations.\nThe thirty longest tales were chosen, rather than a random selection, to ensure a\nsample consisting of long, information-rich tales rather than short, information-poor\ntales. Since the emphasis of the inquiry was on the attributes of female characters,\neach of 1,440 tales was then scanned for the presence of a main female protagonist or\na main female antagonist. A protagonist was defined as a character who plays a\ncentral role in the action and who the audience is led to root predominantly for rather\nthan predominantly against. An antagonist was defined as a character who plays a\ncentral role in the action, who acts as an obstacle to the goals of the protagonist(s),\nand who the audience is led to root predominantly against rather than predominantly\nfor. Any tale containing one or both of these character types was flagged for coding.\nThis sampling procedure likely introduced some biases into the sample that will be\ndiscussed in the results section.\nA coding form was developed to collect data on the main characters of all\nflagged tales (see appendix 1). While male characters were not the main targets of\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nthe study, coding forms were also filled out for all main male protagonists and\nantagonists in order to provide a yardstick for measuring the characteristics of the\nfemales. Information was gathered on female antagonists for the same reason. In all,\nresearchers completed 1,307 coding forms on 658 different tales. Of the completed\nfemale antagonists, and 150 for male antagonists.\nData analysis is reported for the sample as a whole and for each of 6\ngeographical regions: 1) the circum-Mediterranean, 2) East Eurasia, 3) North\nAmerica, 4) South America, 5) Africa, and 6) the Insular Pacific combined with\nSouth East Asia and the Pacific Rim (see appendix 2). Where possible our division\nof culture areas into geographical regions follows Murdock's precedent (1957, 1981),\nalthough it diverges in two significant ways. First, the analysis makes up for a\nshortfall of tales in Murdock's Insular Pacific region and a glut of tales in his East\nEurasian region by grouping several culture areas in South East Asia and the Pacific\nRim with tales from the Insular Pacific. Second, East African tales were grouped\nwith Africa rather than with circum-Mediterranean tales. These divergences from\nMurdock result from the necessity of establishing regional samples of roughly\nequivalent size.\nThe sample was also divided into two broad levels of cultural complexity.\nThe first level consists of tales that circulated primarily in unassimilated band and\ntribal societies, though the tales may have only been written down after assimilation.\nThe second level consists of tales that, while they may have originated in non-state\nsocieties, circulated for long periods in preindustrial state societies. Since the line\nbetween these categories can be fine, tales from culture areas that could not be\nconfidently placed in one of these two categories were excluded from the calculation.\nFinally, because a prominent claim of feminist scholars of folk and fairy tales,\nis that patterns of characterization in European folk and fairy tales are the result of the\npatriarchal biases of male editors and collectors (for a survey of these claims see\nHaase, 2000; for a disconfirming test of these claims see Gottschall, in press), sub-\nanalyses were performed for male-edited collections versus female-edited collections,\nand for data gathered by female coders versus data gathered by male coders. While\nthere is variation across male and female editors and coders, this variation is not\nalways in a predictable direction and it is consistent with natural variations across\ncollections and cultures. In no case did results for male or female coders and editors\nviolate the general patterns apparent in the other samples (for a report of these results\nsee Gottschall, in press).\nContent analysis of literary works presents special challenges to reliability\nassessment due to the length and complexity of the works and the time consuming\nnature of the coding (for further discussion see Gottschall, in press). The following\nwere undertaken to promote inter-coder reliability: we developed a coding question\nthat was as uncomplicated as possible, we devised simple coding instructions, and we\nprepared a coding dictionary with definitions of all potentially ambiguous terms.\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nFinally, inter-coder reliability was assessed in two formal tests. The first test assessed\nthe coders' agreement in scanning the same assortment of 23 culturally diverse tales\nfor the presence of a main female protagonist or a main female antagonist. The\nsecond test assessed agreement in coding an assortment of 11 culturally diverse tales\npreviously identified as containing either a main female protagonist or antagonist.\nMost content analysis practitioners strive for reliability rates of 80% or better, and\nconsider 70% to be the minimum level of adequacy (Krippendorff 1980; Neuendorf\nvariables discussed in this paper, agreement ranged from 75-94% with an average\nagreement of 88% (see results section for percent agreement on all variables). These\nrates of reliability were nearly identical to those produced by 12 coders in a different\nstudy who applied the same coding question to a western literature sample (see\nGottschall, Martin, Quish, and Rea, 2004). This approach, in which reliability ratings\nare established prior to actual coding rather than having multiple coders read and\ncode all or some fraction of the different works, is well established in content analysis\nand is discussed as an option in books on, and practical guides to, the subject. The\nadvantage of this approach is that is allows the compilation of the largest data sets,\nthough some content analysts argue that it does so at the cost of some degree of\nprecision in reliability reporting (for discussion of different methods of reliability\nWe acknowledge that the relatively small number of tales examined in our\nreliability assessment influences confidence in the reliability of our overall results.\nAt the same time, however, we believe that confidence in our results should also be\ninfluenced, in a positive way, by the fact that 15 na\u00efve coders, working in isolation\nfrom one another, all found the same general patterns of female versus male\ncharacterization in their individual collections. While the degree of confidence\ngenerated by this fact cannot be expressed quantitatively, such regularity would not\nbe anticipated in the output of unreliable coders.\nResults: The Heroine's Face\nThis study was designed in hopes of producing an empirically sound\ncomposite of some broad lineaments that are relatively constant in the heroine's\nthousand faces. Analysis of data reveals salient trends of female protagonist\ncharacterization across the sample in parameters associated with age, levels of\nphysical attractiveness, frequency of representation as the main character, marital\nstatus, mating preferences, motivation, level of activity, personality descriptors,\npropensity for physical heroism, and patterns of altruism.\nFrequency of representation as the main character\nAcross subsamples female protagonists were significantly under-represented\nas main characters. The representation of female protagonist main characters was\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nestimated in two ways. The first estimation was reached by subtracting the number of\ntales with female protagonist main characters in the sample from the total number of\ntales scanned (all pertinent questions from the coding form are listed in appendix 1).\nOverall, male main characters outnumbered female main characters by a factor of\nthree (inter-coder reliability 81%). However, this method may overestimate\nsomewhat the representation of male protagonist main characters because it does not\naccount for tales where main characters (like animals, plants, or forces of nature) may\nbe represented as unsexed. In the second estimation, the senior author analyzed the\ntables of contents of all collections utilized in the study, determining the relative\npercentages of titles referring to male main characters versus female main characters.\nAny title that did not communicate definite information as to the sex of the tale's\nmain character was excluded from the calculation. Overall, male main characters\noutnumbered female main characters by more than 2 to 1. However, this method of\nestimation likely underestimates the representation of male main characters because it\ndoes not account for the fact that most folk tales featuring anthropomorphized\nanimals or forces of nature sex them as male. As indicated in Table 1, the results of\nboth analyses (the first somewhat aggressive, the second somewhat conservative)\nconfirm that female protagonist main characters are significantly under-represented in\nthe samples.\nTable 1: Percentage of male and female main characters: two methods of estimation\nEstimation 1 Estimation 2\nMale Female Z-Score Male Female Z-Score\nN is number of story characters * indicates p < .05 ** indicates p < .001\n(See Appendix for listing of cultures in each region and level of cultural complexity)\nAs stark as the discrepancies are, the likelihood exists that, due to the\nparticular sampling methodology we employed, our figures significantly overestimate\nthe representation of female main characters. This is because all tales coded were\nfirst pre-selected for the presence of prominent female characters. A sample that was\nnot thus presorted would likely have an even more extreme imbalance between main\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nmale and female characters.\nThese results have recently been replicated in computerized content analyses\nof a (different) culturally and geographically diverse sample of 43 collections of\nfolktales from around the world. It was discovered that, in these collections, male\nsubject pronouns (he, him, himself, etc.) outnumbered their female equivalents by a\nratio of 3:1, and that clearly male terms (man, boy, uncle, etc.) outnumbered their\nfemale equivalents by roughly the same margin (Gottschall, Callanan, Casamento et\nal., 2004.). Together with the results of the present study, these findings suggest that\nan under-representation of prominent female folk tale characters is statistically, and\nperhaps absolutely, universal in world folk literatures.\nAge\nYoung, reproductive aged women are vastly over-represented in the ranks of\nfemale protagonists (inter-coder reliability 75%). Across subsamples an\noverwhelming majority of female protagonists were identified either as sexually\nmature teenagers or as twenty to twenty-nine year olds; just 8% were identified as\nforty or older. This is in stark contrast to the depiction of female antagonists, 40% of\nwhom were identified as forty or older (see Table 2). Incidentally, male protagonists,\nthough rated slightly older than female protagonists overall, demonstrated exactly the\nsame pattern: the antagonists are significantly older than the protagonists.\nTable 2: Percentage of female protagonists and antagonists falling in given age\ncategories\nSexually Mature Teen or Twenties Forty or Older\nFemale Female Female Female\nProtagonist Antagonist Z-Score Protagonist Antagonist Z-Score\nN is number of story characters * indicates p < .05 ** indicates p < .001\n(See Appendix for listing of cultures in each region and level of cultural complexity)\nWe did not predict the age discrepancies in the portrayal of antagonists and\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nprotagonists of both sexes and will not speculate here about its root causes. What\nseems clear, however, is that the youthfulness of protagonists is connected to the\nprominent role of marriage in the tales.\nMarriage and mating preferences\nWhile there was significant variability across sub-samples, the majorities of\nmale and female protagonists were unmarried at the beginning of their tales (77%\nmale; 78% female) and, of these characters, most were married by the end (64%\nfemale; 64% male). Fewer previously unmarried antagonists succeeded in marrying\nby the end of their tales, but the percentage was still substantial (33% female; 22%\nmale). Thus a large proportion of folk tales dwell on the process of attracting and\nsecuring mates. As a result, the tales convey information regarding the attributes\ncharacters from the world's folk tale traditions value in potential mates. Consistent\nwith expectations, female protagonists were rated as placing the highest premium on\na potential mate's kindness (a potential signaller of commitment), followed by his\nwealth and social status. In contrast, while male characters were also attracted to\nkindness, they were far more likely to be rated as placing a premium on the physical\nattractiveness of potential partners, and placed markedly less emphasis on wealth and\nstatus (see Table 3) (for further discussion of mate preferences in the tales see\nGottschall, Martin, Rea, and Quish, 2004). Inter-coder reliability for the marital\nstatus variables were, respectively, 89% and 86%; reliability for the mate preferences\nTable 3: Percentage of male and female characters identified as placing primary\nemphasis on given mate preference criteria\nPhysical attractiveness Wealth/Status Kindness\nMale Female Z-Score Male Female Z-Score Male Female Z-Score\nN is number of story characters * indicates p < .05 ** indicates p < .001\n(See Appendix for listing of cultures in each region and level of cultural complexity)\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nLevel of physical attractiveness\nConsistent with expectations, when information was available regarding a\nfemale protagonist's physical appearance, they were almost universally described as\nphysically attractive (results are based on explicit judgments of narrators and\ncharacters, not on individual coder preferences). In fact, the appearance of a female\nprotagonist explicitly defined as physically unattractive was a true statistical\nanomaly: just eight of 1,440 tales included a main female protagonist explicitly\ndefined as unattractive. While male protagonists were also overwhelmingly more\nlikely to be defined as physically attractive than unattractive, information on this\nfactor was much less likely to be conveyed if the character was male. Overall, 50%\nof tales featuring female protagonists contained explicit information on their physical\nattractiveness versus just 21% for male protagonists. Further, when there was\ninformation available on a character's physical attractiveness, there were\napproximately 50% more references per tale to female physical attractiveness than\nmale. The female protagonist's physical attractiveness was also emphasized\nsignificantly more than that of the female antagonist.\nTable 4: Physical attractiveness of male and female protagonists\nPercent with information on\nAttractiveness\nPercent attractive Average references to\nattractiveness per tale\nMale Female Z-Score Male Female Z-Score Male Female T-Stat\nCircum-\nPreindustrial\nN is number of story characters * indicates p < .05 ** indicates p < .001\n***sample size too small to calculate significance\nX is number of references to attractiveness per sub-sample\n(See Appendix for listing of cultures in each region and level of cultural complexity)\nOverall, in cases where information was conveyed on physical appearance, just 69%\nof female antagonists were defined as physically attractive. Moreover, as with male\nprotagonists, information on physical attractiveness was conveyed less frequently\n(23% of tales) and less repetitively (three times fewer references per tale) for the\nfemale antagonist. There was least emphasis on the attractiveness of male\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nantagonists. As a whole and across subsamples there was, then, an intense emphasis\non the physical attractiveness of female protagonists relative to other character types.\nInter-coder reliability for the attractiveness variable was 89%.\nRatings of activity, heroism, and courage\nConsistent with expectations, the data reveal that female protagonists pursue\ntheir goals differently than male protagonists. While 74% of male protagonists were\ndefined as actively pursuing their goals, just 50% of female protagonists were defined\nas active (inter-coder reliability 94%); the remaining male and female protagonists\nwere defined as passive (see Table 5). Characters were identified as active if they\ntook steps to personally resolve their problems and accomplish their goals.\nCharacters were identified as passive if they simply endured their problems, taking\nlittle or no action to resolve their problems or accomplish their goals.\nTable 5: Personality descriptors of male and female protagonists\nActive Courageous Heroic\nMale Female Z-Score Male Female Z-Score Male Female Z-Score\nCircum-\nPreindustrial\nN is number of story characters * indicates p < .05 ** indicates p < .001\n(See Appendix for listing of cultures in each region and level of cultural complexity)\nFemale protagonists were also far less likely than male protagonists to be\ndefined as physically heroic or to be defined as possessing courage as their main trait\nof character (inter-coder reliability 84%). It is important to note that this finding does\nnot imply that female protagonists were uncourageous, just that courage was less\nlikely to be their most distinctive trait of character. Similarly, this finding leaves\nopen the possibility that female characters expressed heroism in ways not entailing\nphysical hardihood or risk. It would be interesting to compare characters using\ndifferent definitions of heroism (e.g., moral heroism) and activity/passivity.\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nPatterns of altruism\nAcross subsamples female protagonists expend significant amounts of energy\non behalf of other people: family, friends, and communities as a whole (inter-coder\nreliability 75%). In contrast to antagonists who were rarely motivated to help persons\nother than themselves (13% female, 5% male), 42% of female protagonists were\nprimarily motivated to help persons other than themselves. Most of this energy was\nexpended on behalf of kin (69%). Moreover, as predicted, energy expended on\nbehalf of kin was not disseminated randomly but was directed overwhelming (91%)\non behalf of family members in the following categories: mates, children, siblings,\nand parents. The remaining 9% of effort is expended on behalf of kin in the\ncategories of niece/nephew(s), aunt/uncle(s), cousin(s), grandparent(s), step-\nrelation(s), in-law(s), and family as a whole (inter-coder reliability 77%). Exactly\nthis same pattern of altruism, where aid is primarily extended to those with the closest\ngenetic relationships, applies to the kin-directed efforts of male protagonists as well\nas to antagonists of both sexes.\nSummary, the Heroine's Face\nThis composite of the heroine's face does not exhaust its subtleties, but is an\neffort to lay down, in broad brush-strokes, some main lineaments that consistently\napply to female folk tale protagonists more than to other character types. It must be\nstrongly emphasized that this composite portrait represents only a rough sketch, with\nindividual storytellers filling in detail, color, and shading in accord with their\nindividual temperaments and socio-cultural contexts. Moreover, the following\ncharacterization does not apply to every female protagonist in the sample nor can it\nbe argued, since statistically meaningful analyses of individual cultures could not be\nperformed, that it prevails in every tradition; the characterization applies across the\nsix large geographical regions, across the two levels of cultural complexity, and\nregardless of the sex of the coders or collection editors. These characteristics recur at\nrates greater than would be predicted by chance and therefore meet the definition of\nstatistical universals.\nThe vast majority of female protagonists are unmarried women at peak\nreproductive age. When physical descriptions are provided, they are almost\nuniversally beautiful, and this beauty is often stressed repetitively. In comparison to\nher male counterpart, the female protagonist places greater emphasis on a potential\nmate's kindness and control of social and material resources, and less emphasis on\nphysical attractiveness. She achieves her goals through different means than the\nmale protagonist: she is less likely to actively pursue her goals and she is less likely\nto achieve them in ways requiring conspicuous courage or physical heroism. She is\nsolicitous of her family's well being, devoting much energy to promote the welfare of\nher close kin.\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\nDiscussion\nOur results suggest that evolutionary theory can be a map and legend (though\nnot the only one) for the study of narrative universals--a guide that points the way to\nuniversals and helps us interpret them. The results of this research, revealing salient\npatterns of characterization in world folk tales, are inconsistent with theories of\n\"hard\" social constructivism and consistent with a growing body of theory and\nresearch in evolutionary psychology and a nexus of closely related fields. It should\nbe stressed that, while similar patterns of characterization emerged across\nsubsamples, different regions often demonstrated strong variation on given measures.\nSome of this variation may be attributable to random drift in relatively small samples.\nHowever, these findings are also compatible with the foundational prediction of\nevolutionary psychology that patterns of human behavior will vary significantly with\ndifferent social and physical environments within the constraints of universal human\nnature.\nThis explanation is not different, in principal, from a common line of\nexplanation in past universalist literary scholarship, here articulated by Kluckhohn:\n\"The mere recurrence of certain motifs in varied areas separated geographically and\nhistorically tells us something about the human psyche. It suggests that the\ninteraction of a certain kind of biological apparatus in a certain kind of physical world\nwith some inevitables of the human condition brings about some regularities in the\nThis study could not guard absolutely against the possibility of cross-cultural\ndiffusion. Indeed, it is likely that in neighboring regions significant cross-cultural\nsharing did occur. However, the geographical, cultural, and historical breadth of the\nsample represents an attempt to minimize the possibility of diffusion adequately\naccounting for the trends. Further, even in the unlikely event that these trends result\nsolely from cross-cultural sharing, this explanation would not explain why stories are\nso \"viral\" and why, in all cultures, certain story types find human minds to be such\nsusceptible hosts. In other words, even if folk tale universals did result only from\ndiffusion (and most experts stress that they do not, see Propp, 1968; Thompson,\nthe hypothesis that these images have a special congeniality for the human mind\"\nThe results of this research have relevance to literary scholars and to human\nscientists using evolutionary theory to map the contours of human nature. For the\nformer community, this study provides a theoretical and methodological model for a\nsustained and systematic research program in literary universals; this program can\nbring some of the same system and vigor to literary studies that the study of\nuniversals has brought to the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, anthropology,\npsychology, and behavioral biology. For the latter community, world literature can\nserve as a vast, varied repository of potentially quantifiable information about human\nbeings and their societies. A carefully compiled sample of traditional folk tales can\nThe Heroine with a Thousand Faces\ngain evolutionary researchers a precious window into the mindsets and life ways of\nthe very groups of people they most want to study and upon whom they have the\nmost difficulty gathering reliable data: traditional peoples living in preindustrial\nsocieties.\nReferences\nAnderson, M.
