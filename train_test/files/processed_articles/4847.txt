Focusing on\nthe Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues\nthat this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied\npublics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating\nknowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should\nbreak the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data\nabout public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by\napplying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermedi-\naries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to\nbecome an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic\ntechnologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open\ndata activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help\nto understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business.\n",

If we understand agency as `the longer\nprocesses of action based on reflection, giving an\naccount of what one has done, even more basically,\nmaking sense of the world so as to act within it'\nwe can make sense of our world and our own actions\nare crucial for our capacity to act with agency. With the\nexpansion of the Internet, social media, and Big Data\ntechnologies, we can currently observe a number of\nfundamental transformations of knowledge production\nand distribution that raise urgent questions about\npublic agency. To date, however, questions about\nagency have been `obscured by unnecessarily\ngeneralised readings' (Couldry and Powell, 2014: 1) of\nthe supposed power of the new technologies. For this\nreason, Couldry and Powell (2014) recently called for\n`social analytics' as a new research paradigm in relation\nto Big Data.1 They stress that agency is still relevant\nand that we should study new forms of reflexive agency\nin increasingly datafied societies.

On the one\nhand, the practices and imaginaries of open data activ-\nists are centered around the distribution and use of data\nand thus linked to datafication, the ubiquitous quanti-\nfication of social life (Mayer-Scho\n\u00a8 nberger and Cukier,\nexpression. Big Data `reframes key questions about the\nconstitution of knowledge' (Boyd and Crawford, 2012:\n665) and raises concerns about the agency of publics.\nAs Couldry and Powell (2014: 4) note, Big Data tech-\nnologies and the growing relevance of algorithms may\ndisconnect `system and experience' because the traces of\ndata people leave behind are often unconscious and not\nmeaningful to them, and the insights generated by com-\npanies or governments are not, or only partially,\n`folded back into the experience of everyday life'. The\ncomprehensive surveillance of online activities made\npossible by Big Data technologies thus might impede\nour potential to act in an agentic manner. On the other\nhand, open data activists apply practices and values\nfrom open source culture to the creation and use of\ndata. This links them to other initiatives rooted in\nopen source culture, like Open Access, Wikipedia,\nWikileaks, Anonymous or Creative Commons (Beyer,\ndatafication, these phenomena raise fundamental ques-\ntions about `the nature of knowledge and expertise,\nhow information is organized and evaluated, and who\nhowever, open source culture is associated with a trans-\nparent and collaborative form of governance that might\nsupport agency. As Raymond (2001) famously pointed\nout when he contrasted the `bazaar model' of open\nsource with the `cathedral approach', open source cul-\nture is fundamentally concerned with the rights to\naccess and distribute knowledge. Open source is based\nlaboration, granting access to the source code of soft-\nware and incorporating contributions from potentially\neveryone.

To address these questions, I will present key\nfindings from a study on the Open Knowledge\nFoundation Germany (OKF DE), a not-for-profit\norganization and one of the most influential and visible\nactors in the German open data movement.2 First, I\nwill address how we can trace the influence of open\nsource culture on open data activists. This will be the\nfoundation for the following analysis, in which I will\nshow how open data activists modulate open source\npractices by applying them to data. Inspired by the\nsocial analytics approach, this analysis will ask, first,\nwhat their practices and imaginaries tell us about the\nconditions under which datafication might support the\nagency of publics and, second, how datafication sup-\nports the agency of activists themselves. In the conclu-\nsion, I will reflect on the broader relevance of this type\nof activism for the ongoing datafication of social life.\nTracing the influence of open source\nculture on open data activists\nIt is generally acknowledged that activism around open\ndata is rooted in hacking culture (cf. Bates, 2012;\nopen source culture as one of the most prominent\ngenres of hacking (Coleman and Golub, 2008).\nHowever, while this connection is frequently pointed\nout, it is rarely examined in more detail. Authors usu-\nally refer to a set of broad ethical commitments taken\ndirectly from traditional hacker culture. These ethical\ncommitments have been famously described by Levy\n(1984) as follows: access to computer technology and\ninformation should be free, centralized forms of power\nare rejected in favor of decentralization, hackers adhere\nto a meritocratic culture of technological excellence in\nwhich the hacker should only be judged by his or her\ncode, and the belief that computers can create a `better\nworld'. While these principles are indeed relevant, we\nrun the risk of oversimplifying the relationship between\nopen data activism and open source culture if we solely\nfrequent reference to Levy's account is problematic\nbecause it `whitewashes' the diversity among hackers.\nWhile hackers share some technical and ethical com-\nmitments (for which Levy's description is still useful),\nhacker culture should not be treated as a `singular code\n2 Big Data & Society\nformulated by some homogeneous group called hackers\nbut instead as a composite of distinct yet connected\nTo develop a more nuanced and differentiated picture\nof how open data activists draw from open source cul-\nture, we can turn to research on its broader cultural sig-\nnificance and influence beyond software development.\nParticularly helpful here is an approach developed by\nKelty (2008). While most attempts to grasp this phenom-\nenon are primarily interested in making generaliza-\ntions--for example by asking whether diverse\ninitiatives rooted in open source culture are forming a\ncoherent movement with a political project (cf. Beyer,\nKrikorian, 2010) or how the organizational features of\nopen source software development can be generalized\nand applied to new domains (cf. Demil and Lecocq,\ndeveloped a model that can be used to trace the influence\nof open source culture for specific cases. In his study of\nthe cultural significance of free software,3 Kelty suggests\nthat open source advocates associate with each other not\njust through a set of ethical commitments, but through a\nrange of key practices and social imaginaries (Taylor,\n2004). He understands open source as an experimental\nsystem made up of five key practices or `components':\nsharing source code, defining openness, writing copy-\nright licenses, coordinating collaborations, and forming\na movement. Understood in this way, open source\nbecomes `a system of thresholds, not of classification'\nWithin each component are a range of differences in\npractice, from conventional to experimental. At the\ncenter, so to speak, are the most common and accepted\nversions of a practice; at the edges are more unusual or\nDue to their flexibility, these components are not\nexclusive to the development of software: each of\nthese practices can be adapted or `modulated' to\napply them to other domains. Therefore, Kelty (2008:\n246) calls initiatives like Wikipedia or Creative\nCommons modulations of open source that emerge\n`out of a direct engagement with and exploration of\nFree Software' and are `committed to experimenting\nwith the given practices of Free Software'. Creative\nCommons, for example, paralleled some of the work\nof the Free Software Foundation in a different context\n`sharing source code' by applying it to `content', it is\nwriting copyright licenses for this new type of `source\ncode', and it has become a movement as well.\nTo trace the influence of open source culture, Kelty\ntemplate that interacts with other forms of knowledge\nmanagement: `Where the practices match, no change\noccurs, and where they don't, it is the reorientation\nof knowledge and power'. Therefore, the proliferation\nof open source culture can be described as the prolifer-\nation and modulation of its key practices in order\nto alter the means of knowledge production and circu-\nlation. Tracing the influence of open source culture\non open data activists then comes down to a set of\nspecific questions: Which practices are modulated?\nHow are they modulated? How does this change the\ndomain to which they are applied? Answering these\nquestions will help us to grasp how activists try to\napply the more transparent and collaborative forms\nof governance associated with open source to politics,\nand how this might support the agency of datafied\npublics.\nPractices and imaginaries of open data\nactivists4\nThe following analysis is based on 10 semi-structured\ninterviews with members of the OKF DE core team\n(including the chairman and founder, main developers,\ncommittee members and project managers) and a con-\ntent analysis of nine relevant documents that were\nselected using a theoretical sampling, for example self-\nportraying descriptions from the official homepage. The\ndata was collected in three rounds between September\ntheory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). I will\nstructure the presentation of the findings in a way\nthat shows how one modulation of open source culture\nleads activists to other, subsequent adaptations and\ninterpretations.\n1. By regarding data as a prerequisite for generating\nknowledge, activists transform the sharing of\nsource code to include the sharing of raw data.\nSharing raw data would allow others to make their\nown interpretation of it and generate their own\nknowledge, which represents a `democratization of\ninformation' for activists.\n2. Seeing information as a necessary precondition for\npolitical participation, activists connect this idea to\nan open and flexible form of representative democ-\nracy by applying the open source model of partici-\npation (the `bazaar model') to political participation,\nwhich should lead to more participation of citizens\nin political decision-making processes and more\nactive and engaged local communities.\n3. A third set of practices refers to activists' acknow-\nledgment that raw data needs to be `refined' to create\nknowledge for citizens, which is why they seek to\ncreate, and become, `data intermediaries' for the\npublic. This leads them to a special interest in\njournalism.\nIn the following, I explain each of these modulations\nand their implications in more detail.\nRaw data as source code\nThe overall mission of the Open Knowledge Foundation is\nalready implicated in its name. The organization adapts a\nhierarchical understanding of the relationship between data,\ninformation, and knowledge that is common in knowledge\nmanagement literature (Tuomi, 1999). According to this\nmodel, (raw) data are understood as symbols that have\nnot been interpreted; data becomes information when it is\nstructured and put into context; and information\nbecomes knowledge when it is interpreted, meaningful,\nand actionable. As the OKF explains, open knowledge\n`is what open data becomes when it's useful, usable and\nused' (Open Knowledge, n.d. a). With its name, the\nOKF thus indicates that it aims at spreading not just\nopen data, but open knowledge. However, data is seen\nas a prerequisite for generating knowledge. This hier-\narchical understanding leads activists to the first and\nmost fundamental modulation of open source culture:\nto conceive raw data as source code that should be\nshared openly to allow others to interpret it and to\ngenerate their own knowledge from it.\nImplicit here is that activists do not simply modulate\nthe practice of sharing source code by replacing code\nwith data. They also adapt the metaphors and concepts\nbehind this practice. To execute human-readable source\ncode on a computer, it has to be translated into binary\ninstructions that are only readable by machines. These\nbinary instructions cannot be retranslated back into the\nsource code from which they have been generated.\nHaving only the binary code without the source code\n(which is the case for most proprietary software) means\nthat it is not possible to understand or modify the `inner\nworkings' of the software. Similarly, open data activists\ntreat raw data as source code and interpretations--or\nknowledge--as binary code. As one activist explains,\nraw data `is not really neutral' but it allows more inter-\npretation than a `summary or a press conference'\n(Interview: Developer 1).5 That is because summaries\nare already interpretations of raw data. Only offering\nan interpretation of raw data without allowing access to\nit would make it difficult for others to understand how\nthis interpretation was developed. Governments would\nthen maintain a `monopoly of interpretation'. Sharing\nraw data makes the process of interpreting it transpar-\nent and breaks governments' monopoly, which means\nthat everybody could make his or her own interpret-\nation of the data that governments use to make and\njustify their decisions--allowing people to examine\nbiases in government's data collection and interpret-\nation. For activists, open data therefore represents a\ndemocratization of interpretation or--as they put\nit--a `democratization of information' (Interview:\nChairman & Founder).\nIt is interesting to contrast the notion of `raw data'\ndeveloped by activists with the way the term is used in\ndiscussions about Big Data. `Raw data is an oxymoron'\n(Gitelman, 2013) is one of the most common critiques\nof Big Data advocates' belief in `objective quantifica-\ntruth, objectivity, and accuracy' (Boyd and Crawford,\nis always prefigured through gathering mechanisms\nhas to be interpreted to make it meaningful and action-\nable, a process guided by specific interests and ration-\nalities and not something that can be considered as\nobjective. Essentially, this questions whether something\nlike `raw' data actually exists when we understand it as\nsomething `pure' beyond human influence. However,\nmembers of the OKF DE adapt a different understand-\ning of `raw' data. For them, `raw' simply means `as\ncollected'. Accordingly, sharing data in `raw'\nform--`as collected'--is not about revealing an\nunbiased and objective truth, but about making the\nbiases of this data transparent and allowing `more inter-\npretation of truth' (Interview: Chairman & Founder).\nUsing this understanding as a basis, members of the\nOKF DE are also concerned with the conditions that\nmust be met to ensure this type of transparency,\ni.e. with the way raw data has to be provided to fulfill\ntheir vision of a democratization of information. This\nleads them to another modulation of open source prac-\ntices: defining openness. More specifically, they define\nboth the legal and technical characteristics of openness\nin relation to data in order to delineate open data from\n`closed' data. For legal openness, the OKF developed\nthe international Open Definition (Open Knowledge,\nn.d. b), according to which data is `open' when it can\nbe accessed, modified and shared by anyone for any pur-\npose without restrictions. Technical openness is about\nensuring that these rights can be exercised without too\nmuch effort. Key here are the principles developed by the\nSunlight Foundation (2010) and the rating system devel-\noped by Tim Berners-Lee (2010). According to these\nguidelines, datasets should be complete, released in a\ntimely fashion, accessible, machine readable, and avail-\nable in open formats. While activists acknowledge that\npersonal data and data crucial to security should not be\nmade available in this way, they suggest that these legal\nand technical conditions are necessary to effectively\nbreak the interpretative monopoly of governments.\nGiven the importance of knowledge for agency, this\ntype of transparency has the potential to support the\n4 Big Data & Society\nagency of datafied publics. As activists acknowledge\nthemselves, however, the mere provision of raw data\nis insufficient and only represents `the first step'\n(Interview: Chairman & Founder). As I will explain\nin the following sections, this provision should go\nalong with more continuous and flexible forms of par-\nticipation and `data intermediaries' that make raw data\naccessible to the public.\nData and democracy\nThe democratization of information described above is\nnot regarded as an end in itself by activists. Ultimately,\nthis form of transparency is taken as a means through\nwhich `the people should be considered again as the\nsovereign' (Interview: Project Manager 1). Even\nthough they do not explicitly talk about agency them-\nselves, activists' articulations of their broader aims are\ninteresting for understanding how and under what con-\nditions the democratization of information they envi-\nsion could support the agency of datafied publics. The\noverall `vision' of OKF DE members is essentially a\nvision of citizen empowerment: sharing raw data\nshould help citizens to better understand and control\ntheir governments and to be more active and engaged in\ntheir local communities.\nThis means that more possibilities for citizens to par-\nticipate in political decision-making processes is a\nmajor goal for members of the OKF DE: `to partici-\npate, people need information' (Interview: Project\nManager 2). In this respect, they regard themselves as\npart of an `Internet generation' that is not content with\nperiodic voting: `[I want] a higher degree of participa-\ntion . . . a more continuous form of participation'\n(Interview: Committee member). This does not, how-\never, necessarily translate into a demand for more\ndirect democracy. Instead, the open source model of\nparticipation is taken as a paradigm:\nWhat is powerful about open source development is\nthat people can elect themselves as participants. I\nmean people can find my project and then decide for\nthemselves to participate in its development and con-\ntribute to it. I think this model of self-selective partici-\npation is extremely powerful and I believe it can be\napplied to politics. (Interview: Developer 1)\nThis means that everybody who wants to participate\nin the decision-making process of a particular issue\nshould have the opportunity to do so in a meaningful\nway. Here, activists explicitly modulate another prac-\ntice from open source culture: coordinating collabor-\nations, the organization of open source projects\n(Kelty, 2008, ch. 7). As mentioned above, this organ-\nizational model has been described as the `bazaar\nmodel' (Raymond, 2001) because it encourages and\nincorporates contributions from potentially everyone.\nJust as there is not one standard model for coordinating\ncollaborations in open source--larger and more well-\nknown projects like the Linux kernel, the Apache ser-\nvers, or the Debian project have all developed distinct\norganizational models over time (Coleman, 2013;\nscribing a specific model of participation. For them,\napplying the bazaar model of open source to govern-\nance is first and foremost about experimentation. There\nwill not be `this one solution that you just need to\napply. I think public authorities will need to have the\ncourage to experiment' (Interview: Chairman &\nFounder). This illustrates that more participation is\nnot seen as a natural outcome of open data. Activists\nargue that it requires a cultural change within public\ninstitutions: a change towards a `beta culture' that is\nwilling to experiment and risk failure (Schwegmann,\n2012), and a more collaborative and less authoritative\nrelationship with citizens. Public institutions, it is\nargued, should promote the use of data and actively\ninclude citizens in decision-making processes: `It is\nnot just about opening data. . .but also about invest-\nments from public institutions to ensure that this data\nis used' (Interview: Committee member). Activists\nthink that this cultural change will mainly happen at\na local level, where issues are `closer' to the people and\ninstitutions can experiment with `less resources'\n(Interview: Chairman & Founder).\nTaken together, the way activists apply the open\nsource model of participation to governance results\nin a notion of a more open and flexible form of repre-\nsentative democracy. `Open' refers to a higher degree of\ntransparency (by sharing raw data) and the openness of\npolitical decision-making processes for public participa-\ntion. `Flexible' means that activists think that the inclu-\nsion and coordination of citizens' voluntary, `self-\nselective participation' should be adapted to the issue\nat hand and to the local context. At the same time,\nactivists do not question representative democracy as\nsuch and are rather skeptical about elements of direct\ndemocracy, e.g. referendums: `I don't know if direct\ndemocracy is always the right answer . . . but\nI definitely want more mechanisms to involve people\nmore often' (Interview: Chairman & Founder). From\nthe perspective of democratic theory, they negotiate\nbetween representative models of democracy--in\nwhich participation is mainly limited to periodic voting\n--and direct models of democracy, where entire elect-\norates vote on certain proposals. This is similar to\nBarber's (2004) model of `strong democracy', a more\nexplicit attempt to develop an alternative to represen-\ntative and direct democracy. Put briefly, strong democ-\nracy is based on a `creative consensus' that is meant to\nrecognize the diversity of interests and `is premised on\ncitizens' active and perennial participation in the trans-\nformation of conflict through the creation of common\nconsciousness and political judgment' (Barber, 2004:\n224). Similarly, the diverse and flexible modes of orga-\nnizing voluntary participation envisioned by OKF DE\nmembers require the active involvement of citizens and\nimply a consensus building process that is `creative' in\nnegotiating diverse interests and in its organization.\nWe can summarize the ideas and aims of open data\nactivists described thus far to articulate--as an inter-\nmediary result--a first proposal about the conditions\nthat must be met to support the agency of datafied\npublics: the transparency created through the sharing\nof raw data should be accompanied by a cultural\nchange within public institutions to support voluntary\nand flexible forms of participation similar to those\nfound in open source projects. As I will detail in the\nnext section, activists not only emphasize the import-\nance of public institutions, but also of other intermedi-\naries to facilitate this participation.\nCreating empowering intermediaries:\nComplementing or replacing journalism?\nEven though the idea behind the democratization of\ninformation is to potentially allow everybody to inter-\npret raw data, activists are well aware that the average\ncitizen does not have the time and expert knowledge to\ndo so. They recognize that their vision of empowerment\nthrough open data can only be realized with intermedi-\naries that make raw data accessible to the public.6\nDifferent to the modulations discussed above, this is\nnot directly reflected by open source culture.\nHowever, it emerged out of activists' engagement,\nexploration, and modulation of open source, i.e. of\nmodulating the sharing of source code to include the\nsharing of raw data and of using the open source model\nof participation as a paradigm for political participa-\ntion. Because activists realize the importance of suitable\nintermediaries for their goals, they actively seek to\n`create' them--which makes this aspect also interesting\nfor understanding how datafication supports the\nagency of activists themselves.\nIn terms of agency, more interesting than the basic\n"
