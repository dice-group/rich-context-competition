Fifty-two percent of adults reported taking a\ndietary supplement in the past month; 35% took a multivitamin/multimineral. Vitamin C, vitamin E, B-complex\nvitamins, calcium, and calcium-containing antacids were taken by more than 5% of adults. In bivariate analyses,\nfemale gender, older age, more education, non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, any physical activity, normal/\nunderweight, more frequent wine or distilled spirit consumption, former smoking, and excellent/very good self-\nreported health were associated with greater use of any supplement and of multivitamin/multiminerals; in\nmultivariable comparisons, the latter three characteristics were not associated with supplement use. Most\nsupplements were taken daily and for at least 2 years. Forty-seven percent of adult supplement users took just\none supplement; 55% of women and 63% of adults aged 60 years took more than one. These findings suggest\nthat, to minimize possible spurious associations, epidemiologic studies of diet, demography, or lifestyle and\nhealth take dietary supplement use into account because of 1) supplements' large contribution to nutrient intake\nand 2) differential use of supplements by demographic and lifestyle characteristics.\nadult; antacids; dietary supplements; health surveys; minerals; nutrition surveys; vitamins\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; OR, odds ratio; UL, Upper\nIntake Levels.\nThe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of\n1994 (1) assured consumer access to a wide range of dietary\nsupplements. Dietary supplements of all varieties are now\nmarketed in the United States, including single-ingredient\nproducts and various combinations of vitamins, minerals,\nbotanicals, and other constituents.

This paper presents\nuse of any dietary supplement, and of specific vitamin and\nmineral supplements for the US population aged 20 years or\nolder, and on associations of use with select demographic\nand lifestyle characteristics.\nThe NHANES survey\nNHANES is designed to monitor the health and nutritional\nstatus of the US population (4). A nationally representative\nsample of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population is\nselected using a complex, stratified, multistage probability\ncluster sampling design. Selected population subgroups of\nparticular interest are oversampled to obtain sufficient\nnumbers to reliably estimate health and nutrition parameters.\nlow incomes, African Americans, Mexican Americans,\nadolescents, people 60 years of age or older, and pregnant\nwomen.

Many questions\nincluded numerous blood biochemistries, body composition,\naudiometry, oral health, vision, cardiovascular fitness, and a\nphysician's examination (5). Additional details about the\nmethods and measures, including the exact wording of ques-\ntions, are available on the Internet (4\u00ad8). The NHANES\nolder.

Body mass index\nwas calculated from self-reported height and weight (kilo-\ngrams/meters squared). Measured height and weight were\navailable; however, analytic results were nearly identical to\nthose from self-report, so the latter were used to maintain\nconsistency with other variables and the larger sample size.\nClassifications of body mass index were <25.0 (normal or\n(9). Pregnant women were asked to report their prepreg-\nnancy weight. Physical activity referred to self-report of\nvigorous activity causing heavy sweating or a large increase\nin breathing or heart rate and of moderate activity causing\nlight sweating or a slight-to-moderate increase in breathing\nor heart rate for at least 10 minutes in the past month. Any\nreport of vigorous activity was classified as vigorous, a\nreport of moderate but no vigorous activity was classified as\nmoderate, and a report of neither was classified as no phys-\nical activity.\nDietary supplement data collection\nDietary supplement intake was assessed by asking partici-\npants whether they had taken any vitamins, minerals, or\nother dietary supplements, including prescription supple-\nments, in the last month. They were shown a card with exam-\nples of many types of supplements (Appendix table 1).\nInterviewers asked to see participants' supplement\ncontainers, and they recorded the name and manufacturer of\neach supplement from the label. If the container was not seen\n(22 percent of the time), the interviewer asked for the exact\nname of the product or, if not known, the supplement type,\nfor example, multivitamin, vitamin C. Participants were\nasked how long they had been taking this product, how\noften, and how much they took. Information on as many as\n20 supplements could be recorded. Antacids were recorded\nseparately unless the participant reported using them as a\ncalcium supplement. Methods are described in more detail\nData preparation\nTrained NHANES nutritionists matched reported supple-\nments and antacids to known products (7). The supplements\nand calcium-containing antacids were then categorized by\nNHANES nutritionists (Appendix table 2).\nDietary supplement use prevalence was estimated using\nsampling weights for each person to account for differential\nprobabilities of selection and nonresponse. Sample weights\nwere poststratified to US Census Bureau estimates of the\npopulation to yield representative estimates (10, 11).\nBecause only interview data were used in these analyses,\ninterview weights were used.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SAS for\nWindows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and\nSUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina). Standard errors for preva-\nlence were calculated by using the delete 1 jackknife method\n(10, 12), partitioning the sample into 52 sampling units and\nforming 52 replicates deleting one unit at a time. Differences\nbetween prevalence rates were assessed with two-sided t\ntests. Because of the numerous comparisons possible, only\ndifferences of p < 0.005 are noted. Prevalence estimates and\ncomparisons of the number, frequency, and duration of\nsupplements taken were based on the sample of all 4,862\nadults aged 20 years or older for whom dietary supplement\ndata were available.\nMultivariable logistic regression was undertaken to assess\nassociations of supplement use with demographic and life-\nstyle characteristics of interest while simultaneously\naccounting for the other characteristics. Each demographic/\nlifestyle characteristic included in the logistic regression\nmodel was associated with the prevalence of at least two\nsupplement types in pairwise comparisons. Trend was\nassessed by assigning integer scores to variables with at least\nthree hierarchical categories and then treating them as\ncontinuous, assuming a linear relation. Geometric means of\nthe number of supplements taken were used to account for\nthe skewed distribution. Logistic regression was based on\nthe smaller sample of the 4,453 participants with complete\ndata for all variables that were included in the regression\nmodel.\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of supplement use\nFifty-two percent of adults in our study (47 percent of\nmen, 57 percent of women) had taken a dietary supplement\nin the previous month (table 1). Most commonly reported\nwere multivitamin/multiminerals (35 percent), usually a\nstandard or senior formula, and vitamins E and C (12\u00ad13\npercent). Ten percent reported taking calcium supple-\nments, which increased to nearly 25 percent when\ncalcium-containing antacids not recorded as dietary\nsupplements were included. Use of B-complex vitamins\nwas reported by 5 percent. Other vitamin or mineral\nsupplements for which prevalence rates were greater than\n1 percent are presented in table 1. Those for which the\nrates were 1 percent or less, not presented in any table,\nincluded potassium, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, beta-\ncarotene, molybdenum, magnesium, multiminerals,\nvitamin B6\n, and vitamin K.\nBivariate analysis\nComparisons of use of specific supplement types by demo-\ngraphic/lifestyle characteristics (tables 1 and 2) revealed a\nnumber of consistent patterns. Use of any supplement and the\nmost commonly taken supplements was usually higher for\nwomen than for men, for participants aged 60 years or older\nversus 20\u00ad39 years, for non-Hispanic Whites versus non-\nHispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans, for participants\nwith more than a high school education versus less, for those\nreporting moderate versus no physical activity, and for former\nversus current smokers (p < 0.005 for all comparisons except\nB-complex vitamins).

Particu-\nlarly high were positive associations of older age with vitamin\nE (odds ratio (OR) = 9.1, 95 percent confidence interval (CI):\nhigher education with B-complex vitamin use (OR = 5.1, 95\npercent CI: 2.9, 9.2), and female gender with calcium use\nicans and non-Hispanic Blacks were less likely than non-\nHispanic Whites to take supplements. Particularly low was\nnon-Hispanic Blacks' use of calcium and combined calcium/\npercent CI: 0.3, 0.7). There was no association of B-complex\nvitamin supplements with race/ethnicity. More frequent wine\nintake was positively associated with use of any supplement\nand multivitamin/multiminerals, vitamin C, and vitamin E but\nnot of calcium, combined calcium/antacids, or B-complex\nvitamins. Increasing body mass index was associated with less\nuse of any supplement and multivitamin/multimineral supple-\nments and with greater combined calcium/antacid use, but not\nwith other supplement types. Compared with never smokers,\ncurrent smokers were less likely to take vitamin E or calcium.\nIn multivariable analyses, poor self-reported health was asso-\nciated only with greater B-complex vitamin use.\nDetails of supplement use\nForty-seven percent of supplement users took only one\nsupplement (table 4); only 5 percent took more than six (data\nnot shown). More men than women took just one supplement (p\n< 0.01), but the mean number taken was similar (p = 0.06). Use\nof only one supplement decreased with age (p < 0.001), mean\nnumber increased with age (p < 0.01), and older people took\nmore supplements than younger ones did (p < 0.001). Only two\nparticipants reported taking the maximum of 20 supplements.\nAt least 89 percent of the four most common supplement\ntypes were taken 30 times a month or more; B-complex vita-\nmins and combined calcium/antacids use was less frequent\n(table 5). Over half of the users of each type except multivi-\ntamin/multiminerals had taken them for 2 years or more;\nover a fifth of vitamin C, vitamin E, and calcium/antacid\nusers had taken them for at least 10 years.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevalence of dietary supplement use\nnationally representative data available on comprehensive\ndietary supplement use. They indicate that over half of US\nadults aged 20 years or older took at least one dietary supple-\nment some time during the preceding month. The most\ncommonly used supplements were multivitamin/multimin-\nerals (35 percent), vitamin C, vitamin E, and calcium.\nSupplements of other nutrients of interest in relation to\nhealth, such as selenium, folic acid, beta-carotene, zinc, and\nfrom previous NHANES surveys, which used similar meth-\nodology, suggests that supplement use has increased. Results\n(13). Prevalence rates for adults were 35 percent in the\nSecond NHANES survey and 23 percent in the First\nNHANES survey (14, 15).

Other studies (19, 20) have used a\nprocedure similar to the NHANES method as their reference\nmethod to assess validity of self-reported dietary supplement\nuse by questionnaire or via a telephone interview. Addition-\nally, NHANES supplement data are categorized by nutrition-\nists based on standardized classification rules regarding the\nproduct name and ingredients. Such a labor-intensive proce-\ndure is important for accurate data collection and categoriza-\ntion. Other collection procedures cannot be assumed to\nachieve this quality of data. To our knowledge, validity of\nself-report of supplements by type, a commonly used\nmethod (3, 16\u00ad18), has not been assessed. As supplements\nbecome more complex, containing a variety of ingredients,\nself-categorization may become more problematic,\nincreasing the need for validation studies of such methods.\nSome limitations of the NHANES data are the short\nreferent time frame of the past month, which is used to\nincrease accuracy of self-report and for comparability with\nother NHANES data that use this time frame. However,\nresults are difficult to compare with studies that assess\nannual supplement use, especially for supplements used for\na short term as medications. Additionally, because the data\nare cross-sectional, analyses of supplement use with the\nmany health conditions measured in NHANES cannot\npresume any causality, only a concurrent or subsequent asso-\nciation. While recording of the supplement name from the\nlabel is a strength compared with many other studies, it is\nstill subject to some error. Capture of the label image would\nimprove data collection. Additionally, analytic verification\nof the supplement's actual ingredient content would be\nrequired to accurately depict nutrient content.\nImplications of findings for nutrient intake\nThe high prevalence of daily multivitamin/multimineral\nsuggests adequate intake of a large number of important vita-\nmins and minerals by a sizable proportion of US adults.\nHowever, some supplements list nutrients at levels at or\nabove the Upper Intake Levels (UL) set by the National\nAcademy of Sciences (21). Most multivitamin/multimineral\nlabels listed nutrients below the UL; however, some listed\namounts at or above the UL for niacin, magnesium, zinc,\niron, folate, vitamin B6\n, vitamin C, and vitamin A. On some\nB-complex vitamin labels, niacin and B6\nexceeded the UL.\nSome single- or double-nutrient supplements, such as\nvitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6\n, iron, zinc, and calcium\nplus magnesium, listed amounts at or near the UL. Addition-\nally, a person taking several magnesium-containing antacids\ncould be at risk of exceeding the UL for magnesium. While\nTABLE 3.

Importantly, intake of calcium\nantacids is sometimes greater in population groups with\nlower calcium supplement use. For example, when antacids\nwere included, obese people, current smokers, beer drinkers,\nand more frequent distilled spirit consumers were as likely as\nother population groups to take supplemental calcium.\nantacid. Thus, although on average an antacid tablet may\nprovide less calcium than a calcium supplement, and usage\npatterns may differ (e.g., antacids taken intermittently but\nperhaps several times per day vs. daily calcium supplement\nuse), these data show that calcium-containing antacid intake\nis important to consider when assessing total calcium intake.\nCurrent interest in the associations of calcium intake with a\nvariety of chronic diseases (22\u00ad28) underscores the impor-\ntance of accurate total calcium intake assessment.\nTABLE 3.

For\nsurveys that cannot collect data in as much detail as\nNHANES can, it may help reduce such misreporting to\ninstruct participants to include prescription supplements and\nexclude sports and other fortified drinks and foods or, if time\npermits, to ask about these separately, before supplements.\nImplications of findings for study analysis\nBecause these data come from a survey that yields a\nnationally representative sample and calculates respondent\nsampling weights to account for nonresponse and other\nselection factors, the results provide estimates of dietary\nsupplement use in the past month for the total US civilian\nnoninstitutionalized population and by various demographic\nand lifestyle characteristics. The associations observed can\nbe used to inform the design, analysis, and interpretation of\nnonrepresentative studies of supplement use. For example,\nfor the most commonly used supplements and for any\nsupplement use, bivariate results (tables 1 and 2) show that\nolder age, higher educational level, physical activity, race/\nethnicity, and never smoking were associated with higher\nuse of all of these supplement types, while other lifestyle/\ndemographic characteristics were associated with only some\nsupplement types. With multivariable control (table 3), some\nassociations were no longer evident, such as those of race/\nethnicity with B-complex vitamins and calcium, smoking\nwith all supplement types except vitamin E and calcium, and\nphysical exercise with vitamin C. These findings suggest\nthat the prevalence rates for specific supplements from\nnonrepresentative populations could be biased differentially\nfor different supplement types as well as for total supplement\nuse.\nAdditionally, the associations found between supplement\nuse and demographic/lifestyle characteristics stress the diffi-\nculty in interpreting results of observational studies of these\ncharacteristics or of dietary supplement use with health.\nStatistical associations between health conditions and\nsupplement use or demographic/lifestyle characteristics may\nresult from confounding rather than reflect a true biologic\nassociation. The high prevalence of supplement use and the\nstrength of some of the associations with demographic/life-\nstyle variables seen in our analyses suggest including all of\nthese variables in studies of nutrient intake, demographics,\nand lifestyle with health.\nREFERENCES\nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.\ntion Business Journal.
