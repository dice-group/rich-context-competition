Baker1\n1Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.\n2Case Western University, Cleveland, Ohio.\nObjectives. This study analyzed whether socioeconomic status in older middle age continues to be associated with\n10-year survival after data are controlled for baseline health status.\nMethods. We confirmed deaths through 2002 for 9,759 participants in the Health and Retirement Study, aged 51 to\n61 in 1992. We used discrete time survival models to examine hazard ratios over 10 years of follow-up. We examined\nassociations of demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status measures before and after adjustment by health\nstatus and behavioral risk factors.\nResults. The 10-year mortality rate was 10.9%, ranging from 4.7% for respondents reporting excellent health to 35.8%\nfor those reporting poor health at baseline. Lower levels of education, income, and wealth were strongly associated with\nhigher mortality risk after we controlled for just demographic characteristics. After further adjustment for health status and\nbehavioral risk factors, only household income remained significant.\nDiscussion. Baseline health by age 50 is an important pathway in the association between midlife socioeconomic status\nand mortality risk to age 70. The continuing effect of low household income on mortality risk was concentrated among\nrespondents reporting excellent to good health at baseline. Socioeconomic disparities in middle-age health continue to\nlimit disability-free life expectancy at older ages.\nOLDER Americans are living longer, more disability-free\nlives. Americans aged 45 and older have accounted for\ntwo thirds of the overall increase in U.S. life expectancy since\nthe benefits of the compression of morbidity and increased life\nexpectancy in America are very unevenly distributed by social\nclass. Especially among older Americans, the gradient of health\nstatus and survival outcomes across educational, occupational,\nincome, and wealth inequalities may explain much of the more\nhighly publicized racial disparities in health. Despite overall\nimprovement, socioeconomic inequalities in disability-free life\nexpectancy in the United States have widened over the past 20\nyears (Schoeni, Martin, Andreski, & Freedman, 2005; Singh &\nIn interpreting these trends, social epidemiologists have\nbegun to construct what Alwin and Wray described as a life-\nspan developmental perspective on the relationship of socio-\neconomic status (SES) to health (Alwin & Wray, 2005). This\napproach emphasizes the particular timing across the life span\nof economic, social, and psychological exposure pathways,\nrelated to social status, that affect population health and\nmortality across generations. Within just the past few years, this\ntheoretical framework has produced a wave of studies\ndocumenting the enduring effects of early life social status on\nadult health and life expectancy. This literature has ranged from\nthe effects of parental social class and birth weight, to early\nchildhood exposures, to cognitive or physical deprivation\n(Barker, Osmond, Forsen, Kajantie, & Eriksson, 2005; Batty,\nDer, Macintyre, & Deary, 2006; Galobardes, Lynch, & Davey\nKaufman, 2005). Researchers now know that by young adult-\nhood, there are already very substantial SES differences in both\ntraditional cardiovascular disease risk and inflammatory bio-\nmarkers (Banks, Marmot, Oldfield, & Smith, 2006; Koster\nHowever, the specific effects of SES in later life on older age\nhealth and mortality remain controversial (Hoffman, 2005).\nThis is, in part, because none of the landmark cohort studies\nthat originally documented the association of SES with mor-\ntality among older Americans included or controlled for base-\nline health in midlife. Most commonly, these studies relied\nexclusively on educational attainment as a marker for social\nstatus or, more rarely, household income or wealth. Midlife\nSES measures were then associated with mortality over highly\nvariable follow-up periods (Backlund, Sorlie, & Johnson, 1999;\nBond Huie, Krueger, Rogers, & Hummer, 2003; Daly, Duncan,\nMcDonough, & Williams, 2002; Liao, McGee, Kaufman,\nSorlie, Backlund, & Keller, 1995; Wong, Shapiro, Boscardin, &\nEttner, 2002). However, none of these studies included detailed\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2007 by The Gerontological Society of America\nmeasures of midlife health and were thus unable to directly\nassess the potential confounding of SES with health at midlife\ncohort inception. As a result, this literature captured the entire\ncumulative effect of social status on mortality occurring across\nthe entire life course, including long before baseline SES data\nwere collected.\nResearchers' new understanding of the health effects of\nchildhood social status, as well as the growing awareness of the\nimportance of early-life subclinical disease progression, have\nraised questions about the extent to which traditional midlife\nSES measures indeed remain independent predictors of mor-\ntality after data are controlled for health conditions already\nembodied by age 50 (Krieger, 2005). It may be that social and\neconomic inequalities have already taken their toll by older mid-\ndle age. Health status may already be so well established across\nthe socioeconomic gradient by middle age, and poor health\nalready so confounded with low SES, that individuals' social\nposition matters little by older middle age (J. P. Smith, 1998).\nFrom a life-span developmental perspective, another major\nweakness of the historic literature on midlife SES and mortality\nis that by middle age, factors such as education, income, and\nwealth may operate very differently for individuals already at\ndifferent levels of baseline health. Educational disparities have\noften been the sole measure of SES in mortality studies,\nespecially after education was included in U.S. death certificate\ndata. However, education effects on health can operate through\nmany facets of cumulative economic opportunity, for example,\nexposure to occupational risk factors or the availability of\nhealth insurance and preventive care from secure employment.\nEducational differences in social networks, community influ-\nences, individual self-efficacy, and other protective psycho-\nsocial attributes are also closely linked to the prevalence of\nbehavioral risk factors over many years of adulthood (Wray,\nData from the Americans' Changing Lives Study and other\nstudies have indicated that although education is strongly\nassociated with the onset of functional disability, only income\nremains associated with progression of functional impairment\nat older ages (House, Lantz, & Herd, 2005; Zimmer & House,\n2003). Researchers have very rarely studied health disparities\nrelated to the distribution of household wealth, but have found\nthem to be strongly associated with mortality (Bond Huie et al.,\nincidence of symptomatic chronic conditions increases dramat-\nically, persons with higher levels of income and wealth may be\nmore successful at self-management and engaging social\nsupport, have better access to higher quality medical care,\nand have a more comfortable retirement lifestyle, all of which\nmay serve to limit disease progression (Goldman & Smith,\neven this apparent association of older middle-age SES with\nmortality has yet to be tested when controlling for baseline\nhealth status.\nThe present study describes all-cause mortality over\na 10-year follow-up period, using data from 9,759 participants\nin the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), aged 51 to 61 in\n1992, with mortality follow-up across five biannual survey\nwaves through 2002. Findings from discrete time survival\nmodels address the question of the relative association of\nall-cause mortality risk with individuals' years of school\ncompleted, household income, and net assets (wealth) after\nthe data were controlled for respondents' demographic\ncharacteristics. We then tested these associations after further\ncontrolling for baseline health status and behavioral risk factors.\nThe results provide insight into the extent to which the well-\nknown association of SES with mortality is primarily due to\nearlier life effects on health status and behaviors versus\nongoing exposure to economic and social inequality during\nolder middle age itself.\nMETHODS\nData Source\nThe HRS, a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of\nU.S. households, uses a multistage area probability design. The\nstudy population consists of noninstitutionalized adults living\nbased the data used here on face-to-face interviews conducted\nfollow-up over 5 consecutive waves. Mortality was determined\nthrough matching to the National Death Index or from\ninformation from household members through 2002. HRS\ntracking studies have indicated a 98.8% validation of deaths\nwith essentially zero false positives. HRS data are publicly\navailable and can be found at http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/.\nThe Northwestern University Institutional Review Board ruled\nthe study exempt.\nSES Measures\nWe fixed years of school completed as reported in 1992 and\ngrouped education levels as 0 to 8 years, 9 to 11 years, high\nschool graduate (or General Equivalency Diploma), and more\nthan 12 years. We analyzed time-varying values for household\nincome and household wealth measures using data from each\nsurvival through 2002. We computed an income-to-needs ratio\npoverty guideline for a given household size; we categorized\ngreater than or equal to 5.0 at each wave. We imputed missing\ndata for survivors by forward replacement of INR level. RAND\ninvestigators calculated household wealth, which represented\nthe net value of all assets (including primary residence, other\nreal estate, businesses, individual retirement accounts and\nKeogh accounts, stocks and bonds, pensions, and checking\nand savings accounts) minus debts (St. Clair et al., 2006). We\ndivided wealth into three categories: less than 20th percentile\nEducation, income, and wealth were only weakly correlated\nwith one another at 1992 categorical levels; the highest cor-\nrelation was between levels of household income and house-\nhold wealth (r \u00bc .46). This relative lack of correlation\nreinforced the importance of analyzing separate SES effects\nduring older middle age (Braveman et al., 2005).\nHealth Status Measures\nAll health status measures were time-varying values with\nforward imputation of missing data for survivors through 2000.\nSelf-reported overall health was measured in five categories:\nexcellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. The number of\nchronic conditions included self-reported hypertension, dia-\nbetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, arthritis,\nstroke, or visual difficulties and ranged from 0 to 8. We em-\npirically merged the small group of respondents reporting four\nor more chronic conditions into a single highest severity\ncategory. Physical impairment was measured by difficulties in\nclimbing stairs and walking various distances; pushing, pulling,\nand stretching; and performing activities of daily living such as\nbathing, eating, and dressing, without help. We summed each\nitem rated as a physical impairment or difficulty across nine\nHRS questions, with a maximum score of 9 difficulties\n(Feinglass et al., 2005). We empirically grouped the small\nnumber of respondents with five or more difficulties into\na single high disability category.\nSample Demographic Characteristics\nstatus categories included married, divorced or separated,\nwidowed, or never married. Race and ethnicity were catego-\nrized as White, Black, English-speaking Hispanic, or Spanish-\nspeaking Hispanic, due to well-known differences in health and\naccess to health care between these groups. We dichotomized\nparents' mean age at death by whether respondents' parents'\naverage age at death was 75 years or older, versus younger than\nseparate models for men and women indicated that the only\nsignificant difference was higher male mortality for persons\nwho were separated or divorced, and higher female mortality\namong those who were widowed at baseline. All data presented\nhere therefore combined male and female respondents while\ncontrolling for gender as an indicator variable.\nHealth Insurance\nPrevious HRS studies have shown that lack of health\ninsurance is associated with forgone preventive services and\nmajor declines in health and mortality (Ayanian, Weissman,\nSchneider, Ginsburg, & Zaslavsky, 2000; Baker, Sudano, Albert,\nZaslavsky, Meara, & Ayanian, 2004). However, because in-\nsurance status is so confounded by baseline health and SES\nin this cohort, we did not include it in the mortality models\npresented below. Large numbers of HRS respondents gained\nand lost health insurance coverage over the 10-year follow-up\nperiod. This volume of insurance status transitions, particularly\namong the previously uninsured who became disabled and\ntransitioned to public insurance before death, represented\na formidable methodological challenge beyond the scope of\nthis investigation.\nBehavioral Risk Factors\nBehavioral risk factors were both correlated with SES and, in\nthe cases of sedentary activity or being underweight, linked to\nhealth status. Smoking status in 1992 was categorized as never\nsmoked, previous smoker, or current smoker. Body mass index\nwas calculated by weight in kilograms divided by height in\nmeters squared, within four categories: underweight (, 18.5\nactivity level in 1992 from several questions about weekly or\nmonthly light and vigorous leisure time exercise and heavy\nhousework, including ``walking, dancing, gardening, golfing, or\nbowling.'' Vigorous exercise included ``aerobics, running, swim-\nming, or bicycling.'' We scaled these items using previously\npublished methods (Feinglass et al., 2005) to approximate the\nSurgeon General report categories of met recommendations\n( 30 min/day of moderate activity on  5 days/week or  20\nmin of vigorous activity on  3 days/week), insufficient (less\nthan recommended but some physical activity), and inactive\n(engaged in leisure time physical activity fewer than three times\nper month). We found that measures of alcohol consumption\nand dependence were not associated with mortality risk in\nmultivariate models and therefore do not include them here.\nStatistical Analysis and Discrete Interval\nSurvival Models\nWe analyzed data using the Stata 9.0 (StataCorp, College\nStation, TX) complex survey design module. We performed\nbivariate analyses of 10-year survivors versus decedents by risk\nfactor (Table 1) using chi0square tests with person-level\nanalytic weights. Because HRS mortality data are publicly\nreported only by biannual survey waves, we used survival anal-\nysis for discrete data, an analog of the Cox proportional hazard\nmodel for continuous data (Prentice & Gloeckler, 1978). These\nanalyses model the discrete hazard rate, which is the probability\nof dying in each subsequent wave given a person's risk factor\nprofile at the previous interview. We estimated a discrete\nhazards model, which accounts for repeated measures on the\nsame individual and does not require a proportional hazard\nassumption, using SAS Proc GenMod (SAS Institute, Carey,\nNC) to fit a generalized linear model with a complementary\nlog log link. To account for the complex sampling design, we\nestimated variance using balanced repeated replication, a form\nof bootstrapping (Korn, 1999). We report results as hazard\nratios with 95% confidence intervals.\nWe present three sequential analyses to estimate the separate\nand joint associations of baseline health and SES measures with\nthe likelihood of death through 2002. We estimated an initial\nmodel to measure the association of SES measures and demo-\ngraphic factors only, beginning with education, and adding\nincome and then wealth (Model 1). Results from this model\napproximated the many previously published studies of cumu-\nlative SES effects on mortality that did not control for baseline\nhealth. We then estimated a second model (Model 2) for de-\nmographic characteristics, health status, and SES measures\ncombined, testing whether SES factors remained significant after\ninclusion of time-varying baseline health measures. Finally,\na third model (Model 3) added behavioral risk factors to assess\nany further effects on the significance of SES measures.\nRESULTS\nBivariate Associations With 10-Year Mortality\nparticipants was 10.9%, reflecting a 13.1% rate for men and an\nHealth and Retirement Study\nVariable\nEstimated Percent of\nPercent Died,\nDemographics\nGender*\nRace/ethnicity*\nParents' age at death*\nSocioeconomic status\nEducation*\nHigh school graduate or General\nBaseline health\n(Table 1 continues)\n8.9% rate for women. Biannual death rates grew from approx-\nprovides bivariate associations of 1992 demographic, SES,\nbaseline health, and behavioral measures with cumulative\n10-year mortality. There were statistically significant differ-\nences in 10-year death rates for all measures.\nHigher mortality was associated with older age, male gender,\nnot being currently married at baseline, and having parents\nwhose average age at death was less than 75 years old.\nAlthough Blacks had higher 10-year mortality (17.6%) than\nWhites, Spanish-speaking Hispanics had the lowest mortality,\nfollowed by English-speaking Hispanics, another demonstra-\ntion of the Hispanic paradox (Palloni & Arias, 2004). Bivariate\ndifferences in mortality are graded across all SES and baseline\nhealth comparisons in Table 1 with differences significant at\nthe p , .0001 level. Higher mortality was also associated with\nbeing a current smoker, being underweight (often related to\nillness), and being physically inactive (which also may have\nbeen a proxy for baseline health). Respondents who reported\nbeing overweight or obese had better 10-year mortality than\nnormal-weight respondents.\nModel 1 Results for SES Measures\nThe final three columns of Table 1 present discrete time\nsurvival model results, beginning with demographic and SES\nmeasures in Model 1. Older age; male gender; being separated,\ndivorced, or widowed; and having parents who died at less than\n75 years old were all significantly associated with mortality.\nHispanics had significantly lower mortality than Whites, and\nBlack respondents no longer had significantly higher mortality\nthan Whites after adjustment for SES. Lower levels of\neducational attainment, although initially significantly associ-\nated with higher mortality risk, became nonsignificant when\nfirst income and then wealth were entered into sequential\nmodels (data not shown). Individuals of lower income levels all\nhad significantly higher mortality with hazard ratios only\nmodestly attenuated when wealth was included, and respon-\ndents from lower wealth households also had a higher mortality\nrisk net of income.\nModel 2 and Model 3 Results for SES,\nHealth Status, and Behavioral Risk Factors\nModel 2 in Table 1 presents results after including baseline\nhealth with SES measures in the same model. Education and\nwealth became nonsignificant, and only the lowest two income\ncategories remained significantly different after inclusion of\nhealth status measures. As expected, time-varying self-reported\noverall health proved to be a dynamic evaluation, with\nrespondents reporting poor health almost 6 times as likely to\nsubsequently die as those reporting excellent health. As\ncompared to those with zero chronic conditions or functional\ndifficulties, having two or more conditions or impairments was\nassociated with progressively greater mortality risk.\nThese results suggest the extent to which baseline health and\nSES were already confounded at cohort inception in 1992.\nMore than 40% of respondents in the lowest INR and education\ncategories reported fair or poor health, more than double the\noverall rate. Not only did individuals reporting excellent health\nat baseline have the lowest 10-year mortality (4.7%), but the\nvast majority (58.2%) of those in excellent health also lived in\nthe highest INR households. Respondents in poor health in\nprovided a stark contrast. More than half of this high-risk group\nwere from the lowest INR households. The primary influence of\nbaseline health was illustrated by the fact that respondents in\nfair to poor health in 1992 were at least twice as likely to die as\nrespondents in good, very good, or excellent health across all\nSES strata.\nModel 3 added 1992 smoking, body mass index, and physical\nactivity measures. Respondents who were inactive, smoked, or\nwere underweight were at significantly higher risk. Although\nthere was only very modest change in the effects of baseline\nHealth and Retirement Study (Continued)\nVariable\nEstimated Percent of\nPercent Died,\nBehavioral risk factors\nNotes: N \u00bc 9,759 survey-weighted respondents from the Health and Retirement Study.\naDemographic characteristics, education, income, and wealth.\nbDemographic characteristics, baseline health, socioeconomic status measures.\ncDemographic characteristics, baseline health, socioeconomic status measures, and behavioral risk factors.\n*p , .0001, mortality rate risk factor categorical comparison to reference group.\nhealth variables, addition of behavioral risk factors further\nattenuated the effects of being separated or divorced, widowed,\nand English-speaking Hispanic to nonsignificance. Hazard ratios\nfor income levels changed little between Models 2 and 3.\nDISCUSSION\nOur primary question was whether SES measures continued\nto be associated with mortality after data were controlled for\nbaseline health status, given that middle-age health is such\na powerful predictor of life expectancy. As confirmed by the\nresults presented here, baseline health in older middle age\nmediates much of the relationship between SES and mortality\nto about age 70. After the inclusion of both baseline health and\nbehavioral risk factors, SES measures like education and wealth\nwere no longer significantly associated with mortality risk.\nHowever, household income, although attenuated, remained\nsignificant.\nDecreasing Health Inequalities in Older Age?\nThese findings are relevant to the debate about the apparent\nreduction of SES differences in health at older ages. There\nhas been relatively little empirical support for the selective\nmortality hypothesis, which asserts that lower SES individuals\ndie earlier, thus survivors from lower SES backgrounds are com-\nparatively healthier in older age (Beckett, 2000). However, re-\nsearchers have suggested that more equal access to health care,\ngiven near-universal Medicare coverage, and the importance of\nSocial Security income in eliminating poverty among the elderly\npopulation, may have reduced health disparities among more\nrecent cohorts of older Americans (House et al., 2005).\nIn one of the only attempts to directly address the con-\nfounding of SES measures with baseline health in the older\nAmerican population, Hoffmann (2005) analyzed 8-year all-\ncause mortality for White adults aged 59 to 107 belonging to\na merged cohort from the HRS and the Study of Asset and\nHealth Dynamics. Interaction effects in this study indicated that\nonce individuals were in poor health, there were few sub-\nsequent SES differences in older age mortality, and that SES\nfactors primarily influenced mortality rates for older adults in\nexcellent to good health at baseline. Post hoc analyses of our\ndata (not shown) confirmed Hoffman's analysis: The lowest\nlevels of household income were only significantly associated\nwith mortality for respondents reporting excellent to good\nhealth at baseline. As health status generally deteriorates with\nage, social disparities in mortality appear to converge. Thus, the\nweakened association between some SES measures (particu-\nlarly education) and mortality after age 65 may be related to the\noverwhelming influence of the increasing proportion of all\nindividuals in poor baseline health, with transitions from\nserious chronic illness to death being more biologically than\nsocially driven at older ages.\nAssociation of Education, Household Income, and\nWealth With Mortality Risk\nEducation, or years of school completed, is probably the\nmost frequently used SES measure in analyses of social\ndeterminants of health in the United States. Schooling can\ntranslate into quality of job opportunities and income, fewer\nrisky behaviors, and availability of social support and high-\nquality medical care. This is what Ross and Wu (1996) termed\neducation's cumulative advantage, which they found tends to\nincrease health disparities with age. Cognitive ability, or intel-\nligence test score measures, are also closely bound up with\nchildhood educational experience. Childhood learning disabil-\nities (Noble & McCandliss, 2005) and low health literacy\n(Baker et al., 2002) appear to have substantial independent\neffects on older age health and mortality (Batty & Deary, 2004).\nThis has led some to call for using education as a cardiovascular\nrisk factor equal to the widely utilized traditional clinical mea-\nIn this study, years of school completed had a clear mono-\ntonic relationship with mortality risk, even after the inclusion\nof income and wealth (Model 4). However, education failed\nto predict mortality at all after the data were controlled for\nbaseline health. This is not unexpected (Davey Smith, Hart,\net al., 1998). With few exceptions (Winkleby, Jatulis, Frank, &\nFortmann, 1992), studies that have reported significant\nmortality differences by educational level failed to include\nuse multivariable economic and social measures, almost all\nfound that after adjustment, education is only weakly or\nnonsignificantly associated with later life mortality (Daly et al.,\nfindings presented here confirm those from the Americans'\nChanging Lives Study and other studies that education\ninfluences the onset, but not the progression, of chronic\nconditions (House et al., 2005). These findings run counter to\nwidely held beliefs about the superior importance of education\nover race and income in predicting adult health and life\nexpectancy (Kolata, 2007). Finally, an important additional\nproblem for evaluating educational attainment is that schooling\nquality varies so greatly across the United States and across\ngenerations that it may be a poor proxy for directly measured\nadult health literacy (Baker et al., 2002).\nHousehold income at the individual or community level also\nhas a well-known association with Americans' health and life\nexpectancy (Davey Smith, Neaton, Wentworth, Stamler, &\nStamler, 1998; Krieger, Chen, Waterman, Rehkopf, &\nSubramanian, 2005; Shishehbor, Litaker, Pothier, & Lauer,\n2006). However, several important caveats remain when\nconsidering how income may directly affect health and\nmortality. Among the older middle-aged adults in the HRS,\nemployment status is closely tied to household income. Of the\nhalf were in the highest INR category and only 10% in the\nlowest. By contrast, more than one third of those respondents\nwho reported being unemployed due to disability or just being\nunemployed were in the lowest INR category. Employment or\nretirement status is obviously related to chronic health problems\nfor many. Thus, some of the continuing effect of household\nincome in our models undoubtedly represents reverse con-\nfounding with conditions acquired earlier in life that caused\npremature disability, unemployment, or retirement.\nAs indicated by the changing associations of car ownership\nand employment status with postretirement mortality in the\nWhitehall Study (Marmot & Shipley, 1996), it is likely that\nhigher household wealth becomes increasingly protective\nrelative to employment income and occupational status as\nretirement (including early retirement) becomes common for\nthis age group. The association of household wealth with\n10-year mortality in the HRS was initially very significant,\nreflecting a crude death rate of 19.4% for those with less than\nthe 20th percentile of net assets as compared to 7.3% for those\nabove the 60% percentile of wealth. This association was\ngreatly reduced by the inclusion of baseline health in Model\n2 and, unlike income, much further reduced with the inclusion\nof behavioral risk factors in Model 3. This latter finding may\nbe related to the large baseline differences between lowest\nand highest wealth category respondents in current smoking\nBehavioral Risk Factors and the Association of\nSES With Mortality\nOur findings replicate U.S. (Lantz et al., 1998) and British\nstudies (Marmot, 2006) in demonstrating that SES differences\nin mortality remain independent of the distribution of\nbehavioral risks; inclusion of these factors had little effect on\nSES mortality risk ratios. However, it is important to note that\nsmoking and physical activity are strongly patterned across the\nSES gradient and are thus really an integral part of SES\ndisparities in health (Barbeau, Krieger, & Soobader, 2004;\nRichardson, Kriska, Lantz, & Hayward, 2004). Nevertheless, it\nis striking that smoking and leisure time physical activity risks\nhad little effect on the association of household income and\nmortality.\nAn anomalous, but not unprecedented (Lantz et al., 1998),\nfinding was that respondents who were overweight and obese at\nbaseline did not have an elevated relative risk of mortality.\nSubanalysis (results not shown) of the obese subgroup revealed\nthat these individuals were significantly more likely to be\nyounger (less than 56 years old) and less likely to be current\nsmokers, both of which confer a mortality advantage. The\nresults of a recent National Health Interview Survey follow-up\nstudy of individuals aged 18 to 64 years old showed that the\nbody mass index associated with the lowest mortality is actually\naround 26 or 27 (which would have traditionally been\nconsidered overweight) for both sexes combined, and that\nonly beyond a body mass index of 27 does mortality start to\nincrease appreciably (Gronniger, 2006). It would be surprising,\nhowever, if the effects of obesity did not have an independent\neffect on mortality rates above and beyond prevalence of\nspecific chronic conditions over a longer follow-up period\nLimitations\nPerhaps the most important limitation to these findings is that\nthe HRS provides no estimates for traditional clinical mortality\nrisk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. This may\nhave led to underestimation of the true effects of unreported\nconditions. Other research has indicated that traditional clinical\nrisk factors add little prognostic power once populations are\nstratified by SES characteristics, but this remains to be studied\nShipley, & Rose, 1990). Our models also could not separately\nanalyze the effects of other potentially significant measures of\nSES, such as childhood SES, occupational job strain, or\nenvironmental health exposures. We did not directly examine\nthe potentially large number of interactions between the SES\nand baseline health variables. Although important to flesh out\nand clarify the data presented here, this investigation was far\ntoo great in scope to present here. Finally, the HRS does not\ninclude institutionalized persons, which may have slightly\nbiased the results.\nFuture Epidemiologic Surveillance of SES Disparities\nUncertainty about concurrent versus historical effects of\neconomic and social inequality is inevitable given major\ndemographic shifts as a new generation of Americans ages.\nSuch changes include the huge historical increase in college\neducation of both men and women entering older middle age,\nlarge shifts in the American workforce, changes in diet and\nexercise patterns, and the notable increases in life expectancy\nfor the oldest old Americans. These changes alone make it\ndifficult to extrapolate to contemporary American society\nfindings from older cohort studies of social determinants of\nhealth. Although expensive to field, additional population-\nbased, prospective longitudinal studies with more sophisticated\nSES indicators are essential to public health surveillance in an\nera of increasing social and economic inequality.\n"
