Ecological correlates measured\nlongitudinally included demographic characteristics obtained by maternal report, home environment quality obtained by\nobservation and maternal report, and proximal child experience factors obtained by observation, maternal report and child\nreport.\nResults: Four patterns of overweight were found: never overweight, overweight beginning at preschool age, overweight\nbeginning in elementary school, and return to normal weight after being overweight at preschool age. The weight status groups\ndiffered on home environment quality and proximal child experience factors but not on demographics. Children overweight at\npreschool had less sensitive mothers than never overweight children. Children overweight at school age had fewer opportunities\nfor productive activity at home than did never overweight children. School-age overweight children also watched the most TV\nafter school. Multivariate logistic regression analyses further indicated the significance to children's weight status of proximal\nchild experience variables. Less physically active children and those who watched more television after school were more likely\nto become overweight. Results did not vary by child sex.\nConclusion: The results support the idea that childhood overweight is multiply determined. The one potentially important and\nchangeable factor identified as a target for intervention centers on how children spend their time, especially their after-school\ntime. Children who are more physically active and spend less time watching TV after school are less likely to become overweight\nKeywords: children; growth patterns; ecological framework; environment; television watching; physical activity\nIntroduction\nConcern over the rapid increase in childhood obesity in the\nUS has been widely expressed in the medical literature,1,2 the\nsocial policy arena3,4 and the popular press.5,6 The rapidity\nwith which overweight has become a major health concern\nsuggests that the driving factors are environmental and\nbehavioral as well as genetic.1 A constellation of social\nCorrespondence: Dr M O'Brien, Department of Human Development &\nFamily Studies, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, 1000 Spring\nE-mail: m_obrien@uncg.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nchanges, including the rise in the use of preprepared and fast\nfood7,8 as well as soft drinks,7 the decline in everyday activity\nsuch as walking to school,9 the extensive availability of\ncomputers and videogames,10,11 and increased amount of\ntelevision viewing,12 has been linked to the increase in\nobesity among children and youth. It is also known,\nhowever, that family demographic factors such as ethnicity\nand income are related to overweight in both children and\nadults13 and that children who receive less positive parent-\ning are more likely to become overweight.14\u00ad16\nThe NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Devel-\nopment (SECCYD) is one of very few longitudinal databases\navailable that allow examination of the large number of\ndemographic, family and environmental factors that have\nbeen proposed as influences on the development of obesity\nin children and adolescents. The children in the NICHD\nlocations across the country, were born in 1991. Thus, they\nhave grown up during a period of time that has been termed\nan `obesity epidemic'17 when the prevalence of obesity in US\nchildren has nearly tripled.13,18 Furthermore, growth data have\nbeen collected on this cohort from birth through age 12, and\nextensive observational and questionnaire data are available\nto be examined as potential correlates of patterns of growth.\nTherefore, this cohort provides us with an opportunity to\nexamine demographic, family and experiential correlates of\npatterns of development of overweight over time.\nChildhood obesity is defined by age, height and gender\npercentile distributions that were developed during the 1970s,\nwell before the onset of increasing rates of obesity in US\nchildren.19 According to the standards of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) and terminology\nproposed by the Institute of Medicine,2 children are considered\nat risk for obesity if their body mass index (BMI) is equal to or\ngreater than the 85th percentile and obese if their BMI is equal\nto or greater than the 95th percentile. Data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Studies (NHANES) from\nchildren remained fairly stable at around 5% from the early\nIn the present study, we use an ecological framework based\non the model described by Sallis and Owen20 to investigate\ncorrelates of overweight in childhood. From an ecological\nperspective, health-related behavior is seen to be influenced\nby factors operating concurrently at different levels: socio-\ncultural, intra- and inter-personal and environmental. The\nsociocultural level is represented in the present analyses by\ndemographic factors \u00ad family income, education levels,\nethnicity, family structure and child sex. The intra- and\ninter-personal level is represented by aspects of the child's\nhome environment that are known to relate broadly to\noverall well-being \u00ad maternal psychological health and\nparenting quality. The environmental level is represented\nby proximal factors in the child's past or current experience\nthat have the potential to link directly to the balance\nbetween energy intake and energy expenditure \u00ad center-based\nchild care, level of physical activity, time spent watching\ntelevision, and the safety of the child's neighborhood.\nBy including all these aspects in a single study, it is possible\nto examine the relative importance of each ecological level.\nFor example, sociocultural or demographic characteristics of\nfamilies that have been linked to childhood obesity may, in\nfact, operate through family processes or through the day-\nto-day experiences of children. It may also be that family\nprocesses or environments that tend to lead to overweight in\none group of children \u00ad boys, for example \u00ad may not play the\nsame role for another group \u00ad in this case, girls.\nThe primary goal of the study was to examine links\nbetween these three levels of ecological covariates and\npatterns of growth indexed by BMI measured from age 2 to\nage 12. Both prior research on the development of obesity21\nand a previous report of children's growth in this study\ncohort22 suggest that children who become overweight during\nthe preschool period are at particular risk for obesity through-\nout childhood. Thus, we divided the total study sample into\noverweight pattern groups based on the age at which children\nmoved above the 85% percentile cutoff for overweight and the\npersistence of overweight after that time. We then examined\ndemographic characteristics of children and their families, the\nquality of children's home environments, and more proximal\nchild experience factors expected to be related to energy\nexpenditure in order to identify variables that differentiated\nthese groups. Of particular interest from the viewpoint of\npotential intervention approaches were comparisons between\nchildren who never became overweight and children who did,\nas these can suggest contextual factors that may help to\nprevent weight gain in childhood.\nOur hypotheses, based on prior literature, were: (a)\nchildren from ethnic minority families, single-parent\nfamilies, and families with low education levels will be more\nheavily represented in the overweight groups rather than the\nalways normal weight group; (b) with demographic factors\ncontrolled, children whose mothers are less sensitive and\nmore strict and controlling and whose homes provide less\ncognitive stimulation and opportunities for positive, pro-\nductive activity are more likely to become overweight; and\n(c) proximal child experiences \u00ad especially those involving\nmore physical activity and less sedentary activity \u00ad are linked\nto a lower likelihood of becoming overweight. To determine\nwhether covariates of weight status groups differed by\ngender, we also examined interactions between child sex\nand the parenting and proximal child experience factors.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants for the study were recruited in 1991 from\ndesignated hospitals at 10 data collection sites: Little Rock,\nAR; Irvine, CA; Lawrence, KS; Boston, MA; Philadelphia and\nEcology of childhood overweight\nM O'Brien et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nPittsburgh, PA; Charlottesville, VA; Seattle, WA; Hickory and\nMorganton, NC; and Madison, WI. A total of 1364 families\nwith healthy newborns were enrolled. Recruitment and\nselection procedures are described in detail in several\npublications23 and on the study website (http://secc.rti.org).\nOf the initial pool of 3015 eligible mothers contacted at 2\nhome visit and became study participants. These 1364\nfamilies were very similar to the eligible hospital sample on\nmajor demographic characteristics (years of maternal educa-\ntion, ethnicity and presence of partner in home). The\nresulting sample was diverse, including 24% ethnic minority\nchildren (13% African American, 6% Hispanic, 2% Asian or\nNative American, and 3% who reported Other), 11% mothers\nwho had not completed high school, and 14% single-parent\nmothers. Mothers had an average of 14.4 years of education,\nand 51.7% of the children were boys. Eligibility require-\nments specified that mothers be 18 years or older, English-\nspeaking, and not have known or acknowledged substance\nabuse, and that infants not be hospitalized at birth for more\nthan 7 days nor have any obvious disabilities. This had the\neffect of screening out very low birth weight, premature or\nsick infants.\nbeen retained in the sample. In the analyses describing\nlongitudinal patterns of growth, 960 children who had\nheight and weight data at any point between 2 and 12 years\nwere included.

Mothers were interviewed at home\nwhen infants were 1 month-old. When children were 6, 15,\n24, 36 and 54 months old and in first, third and fifth grade,\nwe assessed the home and family environment, and begin-\nning at 15 months we also brought children to the lab where\nmeasures of height and weight were collected along with\nother observational and questionnaire measures. At each age\nbefore school entry, we observed children's child care\nenvironments and obtained data on their hours in non-\nmaternal care, and in grades 1, 3 and 5 we observed children\nat school. When children were in grades 3, 5 and 6, their\nphysical activity was monitored for 1 week. Complete\ndescriptions of the data collection procedures used can be\nfound in the Manuals of Operation for the NICHD Study of\nEarly Child Care, which are available at http://secc.rti.org.\nMeasures\nHeight and weight. Standardized procedures were used to\nwhen children were in first, third, fifth and sixth grades.\nHeight was measured with children standing with shoes off,\nfeet together, and their backs to a calibrated 7-foot measur-\ning stick fastened to a wall. Height was measured to the\nnearest 1/8 inch (0.32 cm) and recorded two times. If the\nfirst two height measures differed by more than 1/4 inch\n(0.64 cm), two more height measurements were taken.\nWeight was measured using a physician's two-beam scale.\nScales were calibrated monthly using certified calibration\nweights. Weight was measured with children in minimal\nclothing (i.e., no shoes, no outer layers of clothing and other\nitems that could add weight such as belts, keys or watches).\nAs with height, weight was measured twice, each time to the\nnearest 1/4 pound (0.1 kg). If the two weight measurements\ndiffered by more than 4 ounces, two more measurements\nwere taken. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by\nheight (m) squared.\nDemographic characteristics. Child gender and ethnicity\nwere recorded at 1 month. In this study, ethnicity was\nrecoded as white/nonwhite because the numbers within\nindividual ethnic minority groups were not large enough to\nallow analyses of the groups separately. Maternal education\nin years was obtained by interview at 1 month. Family\nincome was reported by mothers at each major data\ncollection time point, and an income-to-needs ratio was\ncalculated by dividing income by the poverty level for that\nfamily size. The average family income-to-needs ratio from\n6 months after the child's birth through either 54 months\nor sixth grade was used in analyses. Partner status (resident\nhusband or partner vs no resident partner) was obtained by\nmaternal interview during telephone calls or in-person\ninterviews at every age; the proportion of times the child\nwas living in a two-parent home was used in analyses.\nHome environment characteristics. The quality of children's\nhome environments was indexed by maternal psychological\nwell-being and observed and reported parenting practices.\nMean scores across relevant time periods were used in\nanalyses.\nMaternal depression Maternal depressive symptoms were\nmeasured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies \u00ad\nand at first, third, fifth and sixth grades.

Items included the availability to the\nchild of books, games and sports equipment and whether the\nchild has been to a museum, a performance or a sports event\nin the last year. The HOME Inventory is an observational and\ninterview measure that captures a picture of the child's\nexperiences at home. Observers were trained and certified\non the use of the measure by experienced interviewers at\none site. The subscale included 20 items at 6 and 15 months,\nMaternal sensitivity Mother\u00adchild interaction was video-\ntaped in semistructured 15-min observations using age-\nmonths and at first, third and fifth grades.26 Videotapes were\ncoded by raters who were unaware of other information\nabout the families. Inter-coder reliability was determined by\nindependent coding of 20% of the tapes at each assessment\nperiod. Inter-coder reliability was calculated as the intraclass\nsensitivity ratings used in the present study. A maternal\nsensitivity composite variable was constructed at each age.\nAt 6, 15 and 24 months, maternal sensitivity was calculated\nas the sum of four-point ratings of sensitivity to non-distress,\npositive regard and intrusiveness (reversed). At 36 and 54\nmonths and at first, third and fifth grade, seven-point ratings\nof supportive presence, respect for autonomy and hostility\n(reversed) were combined (a40.70 at every age). Total scores\nwere transformed into z-scores for analysis. Correlations\nControlling parenting At 54 months and again at first and\nthird grade, mothers completed the Raising Children Check-\nlist,28 which assesses three types of parenting strategies\ncontrolling, responsive and lax. Only the controlling-\nparenting score is used in this report. The items in this scale\ninclude indicators of parental expectations for obedience\nand respect for parental authority (`Do you expect your child\nto obey the first time you say something?'). At 54 months\nand first grade, the scores were the mean of responses to six\nitems on the questionnaire, with higher scores reflecting\ngreater parental control. Internal reliability (Cronbach's a)\nthe measure was the mean of responses to nine items,\nproportionally weighted and somewhat overlapping with\nitems included at earlier ages (Cronbach's a \u00bc 0.075).

When measures were administered at more than\none time point, the mean across time was used in analyses.\nChild care history Almost all the children in the sample\nexperienced some non-parental child care before starting\nschool. Because center-based child care is the type of care\nthat is most different from at-home care, and because it is\nlikely that larger groups of children are more active than\nchildren playing alone or in dyads, we used the proportion\nof time children spent in center-based care to examine the\npotential relation between child care experience and the\ndevelopment of obesity. At 3- to 6-month intervals from 6 to\n54 months, mothers were asked about the type of child care\ntheir child was receiving. The proportion of time points (out\nof 16) the mother reported the child to be attending center-\nbased care was used in analyses.\nReported activity level in the preschool period At 54 months,\nmothers completed a reduced version of the Child Behavior\nQuestionnaire,29 a parent-report measure of child tempera-\nment. The 10-item activity level subscale (Cronbach's\na \u00bc 0.070) was used in this study; higher scores indicate\nhigher levels of gross motor activity.\nMonitored physical activity The amount of physical activity\neach child engaged in across a typical week was measured\nwhen the children were in third, fifth and sixth grades using\nan accelerometer (Computer Science Application \u00ad The CSA\naccelerometer Computer Science and Applications, Inc.,\nShalimar, FL, USA) that provides a continuous recording of\nminute-by-minute movement counts. Participants were\nasked to wear the monitor on a belt around the waist during\nwaking hours for 7 days, including both two weekends and\nfive weekdays, excluding showering, bathing, water sports or\ncontact sports, in order to obtain as reliable an estimate of\nusual physical activity as possible. Following earlier research\non monitored physical activity,30 the index of activity used\nin the present study was the mean percentage of time\nchildren spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity\n(MVPA). Correlations across time points ranged from 0.35 to\nTime in school physical education classes At third, fourth,\nfifth and sixth grades, teachers were asked to report the\nweekly minutes children spent in physical education (PE)\nclasses. Correlations across grades ranged from 0.14 to 0.51.\nEcology of childhood overweight\nM O'Brien et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nAfter-school activities At third, fourth and fifth grades\nchildren were interviewed by phone using a guided recall\nformat31 to describe their activities from school dismissal\nintervals per interview to obtain comparable time estimates\nfor all children. From these interviews, the number of after-\nschool intervals children spent engaged in physical activities\nor sports was obtained. Interviewer reliability was assessed\nby calculating agreement between interviewers and a master\ncoder for audiotaped interviews; agreement on coding\ncategories for children's activities ranged from 91 to 100%.\nTelevision watching Two different measures of children's\ntime spent watching television were used. At 36 months,\nmothers completed a Television Viewing Questionnaire\ndeveloped for this study in which they estimated the amount\nof time children were awake and in a room where the\ntelevision was turned on for two weekdays and both\nweekend days in a typical week. The average for the two\nweekdays was multiplied by 3 and added to the total\nreported time to obtain a measure of the hours per week a\nchild was exposed to television. At third, fourth and fifth\ngrades the after-school activities interview (described above)\nwas used to obtain the child's own report of television\nwatching after school. Correlations of the number of\nintervals spent watching TV across time points ranged from\nNeighborhood safety At first, third and fifth grades,\nmothers completed the Neighborhood Questionnaire32 in-\ncluding five items describing their perceptions of the safety\nof the neighborhood in which the family lived. Cronbach's a\nAnalyses\nLatent transition analysis (LTA)33,34 was used to define\npatterns of moving into and out of overweight status\n(BMIX85%) between ages 2 and 12 years. After groups were\ncreated, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was\nused to examine differences across all four groups, and a\nseries of logistic regression analyses were conducted to\nidentify covariates from three levels of analysis \u00ad demo-\ngraphic characteristics, quality of parenting, and proximal\nenvironmental factors \u00ad that discriminated between specific\nweight status groups.\nResults\nPatterns of overweight\nThe proportion of the sample that was overweight\n(BMI485%) increased with child age. At 24 months, approxi-\nmately 15% of the sample was considered overweight; this\nat fifth and sixth grades.\nFor the LTA defining groups based on patterns of the\ndevelopment of overweight, children who had data at any of\nthe data collection points (n \u00bc 960) were included, and the\nanalysis controlled for whether or not children had entered\npuberty at age 11 or 12. This analysis initially resulted in\nfurther collapsed by age periods to create five groups: (a) the\nat all ages; (b) the `preschool overweight' group (n \u00bc 183,\nremained overweight; (c) the `elementary overweight' group\nand remained overweight; (d) the `return to normal weight'\ngroup (n \u00bc 71, 7.4%) experienced at least one overweight\nperiod between 24 and 54 months, but then returned to a\nnormal weight status and remained so for at least three\nmeasurement periods; and (e) the `variable' group (n \u00bc 35,\n3.6%) moved between normal and overweight status in\nno discernable pattern. These `variable' children were not\nincluded in any additional analyses.\nBefore conducting analyses to address the key questions\nof interest, we examined whether there were differences in\nweight status group membership as a function of data\ncollection site and child sex. No differences were found,\nand therefore analyses include both boys and girls.\nDescriptive data on group differences\nMeans for demographic characteristics, home environment\nvariables and proximal child experience factors by weight\nstatus group are shown in Table 1. Multivariate analysis of\neach set of variables showed significant weight status group\ndifferences for home environment variables (F (12,\ngraphics.\nWithin the set of home environment variables, univariate\nanalyses indicated that both the Opportunities for Produc-\nP \u00bc 0.004) differed significantly by group. Children who first\nbecame overweight in elementary school had fewer oppor-\ntunities for productive activity at home than did children\nwho were never overweight, and children who first became\noverweight at preschool age and remained overweight\nthereafter had less sensitive mothers than the children who\nwere never overweight. There were no group differences\nin maternal depressive symptoms or mothers' reported con-\ntrolling parenting. Within the set of child experience factors\nthought to have relatively direct effects on children's weight,\nonly time spent watching television after school significantly\nChildren who became overweight in elementary school\nEcology of childhood overweight\nM O'Brien et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nwatched more TV during their after-school time than the\nchildren who never became overweight.\nDifferentiating weight status groups\nLogistic regression analyses were used for multivariate\nexamination of covariates in three planned comparisons:\nnever vs ever overweight, never vs elementary overweight\nand never vs preschool overweight. (The return to normal\nand variable groups were too small to be included in these\nanalyses.) For each comparison, hierarchical models were\ntested in which demographic characteristics were entered in\nthe first block, home environment variables in the second\nblock, and proximal child experience factors in the third\nblock. To determine whether covariates of overweight group\nstatus differed for boys and girls in the sample, we\nalso entered interactions between child sex and each of the\nhome environment and child experience covariates. Of\nthe 36 interactions tested, only two were significant\nthese few interactions reflected no consistent pattern. Given\nthe low frequency of significant results relative to the\nnumber of tests run, the interactions were not interpreted\nfurther. Results of the logistic regression analyses are shown\nNever overweight vs ever overweight Results of the analysis\ncomparing children who were never overweight vs those\nwho became overweight at any point and remained so until\nage 12 indicated that the block of proximal child experience\nvariables significantly differentiated the groups above and\nbeyond demographic characteristics and home environment\nfactors. As shown in Table 2, the amount of physical activity\nchildren engaged in and the time they spent watching\ntelevision after school were the factors that differentiated the\nchildren who became overweight at any point from those\nwho did not. Children who were more active between third\nand sixth grade were more likely to be in the `never\noverweight' weight status group, whereas children who\nwatched more TV after school between third and sixth grade\nwere more likely to be in the `overweight' group. The full\nmodel accounted for approximately 6% of the total variance.\nNever overweight vs elementary overweight Results of the\nanalysis comparing children who were never overweight\nwith those who first became overweight in the elementary\nschool years (Table 2) showed a marginally significant effect\nfor the block of variables representing the home environ-\nment. Within that block, maternal reports of controlling\nparenting practices differentiated the children who became\noverweight from those who did not. For every one-\npoint increase in mothers' reported controlling parenting,\nchildren were 2.6 times more likely to become overweight.\nThe block of proximal child experience variables also\nsignificantly differentiated these groups. Child-reported TV\nwatching after school was the single factor that most clearly\nseparated the groups, with children watching more TV being\nsignificantly more likely to be in the overweight group.\nTable 1 Means (s.d.) for demographic characteristics, quality of parenting, and proximal environmental factors by weight status group\nNever overweight\nPreschool overweight\nElementary overweight\nReturn to normal weight\nM s.d.

None of the\ncovariate blocks contributed significantly to differentiating\nthe groups, and the overall model accounted for only 3% of\nthe total variance.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to examine, concurrently, a\nrange of ecologically relevant factors that have been\nproposed to relate to excessive weight gain in childhood.\nThe longitudinal nature of the data available allowed us\nto make comparisons across four groups of children: those\nwho were never overweight up to age 12, those who became\noverweight during the preschool years and remained so to\nage 12, those who first became overweight in the elementary\nschool years, and those who were overweight before school\nage but returned to normal weight thereafter.\nWhen these four groups were compared on demographic,\nhome environment, and proximal child experience factors,\nhome environment and proximal child experience factors\nboth differentiated the groups. Follow-up univariate tests\nindicated that children who first became overweight in\npreschool differed from the never overweight group in the\namount of sensitivity their mothers showed in interaction\nwith them. Observed sensitivity in interaction with the child\nmay be a marker for mothers who are also more involved\nwith their preschool-age children, engage in activities with\nthem, and eat meals together as a family, thus promoting\nchildren's overall health and well-being. Sensitivity may\nalso be a characteristic of mothers who are more attuned to\nchildren's nutritional needs and more likely to provide a\nhealthful diet during the preschool period, when children\nare not yet selecting their own snack foods.\nChildren who first became overweight during the elemen-\ntary school years differed from other groups in two respects.\nTheir home environments provided fewer opportunities for\nproductive activity than the `never overweight' group, and\nthey spent more of their after-school time watching\ntelevision. These findings suggest the possibility of a pattern\nin which children who have few toys or adult-structured\nactivities to engage them at home tend to rely on television\nto fill their time, and such a pattern would be highly likely to\nresult in an overweight child.\nThe fact that the groups did not differ on demographic\nvariables contrasts with other research on childhood over-\nweight,3 indicating that family background characteristics\nsuch as ethnicity and income tend to be linked to overweight\nTable 2 Logistic regression analyses differentiating the never overweight from the ever overweight and the elementary overweight groups\nNever overweight vs ever overweight (n \u00bc 653) Never overweight vs elementary overweight (n \u00bc 486)\nba Odds ratio R2 total (df)b Sig.

Perhaps childhood overweight has become more\npervasive and now affects all social classes. Further research\nis needed to examine the distribution of overweight\nin children nationally and temporal changes in that\ndistribution.\nThe overweight groups were also compared with the never\noverweight group using logistic regression analyses that\nallowed a multivariate approach. Although the factors\nexamined in these analyses are those highlighted by many\nother researchers as important in the development of\nchildhood obesity,33,35,36 we did not find that the full model\naccounted for much of the variance between groups. Some\nsets of variables appeared to be more important in differ-\nentiating certain groups. Proximal child experience factors \u00ad\nespecially activity and TV watching \u00ad reliably differentiated\nchildren who were never overweight from those who became\noverweight at some point before age 12. It is not surprising to\nfind that children who are more active and who watch less\ntelevision are also less likely to be overweight; however, prior\nresults examining these factors have not yielded consistent\nfindings.3 Thus, these results add to the growing literature\nsupporting a focus on the balance between active and\nsedentary pursuits in interventions designed to prevent\nBy contrast, the quality of the child's home environment,\nparticularly the presence of controlling parents, differen-\ntiated the children who became overweight in elementary\nschool from those who did not. In an earlier study using the\nNICHD SECCYD data set, Rhee et al.39 reported a link\nbetween parenting style in the preschool years and child\noverweight status at first grade. Mothers who were highly\nsensitive and who held high expectations for child self-\ncontrol were least likely to have overweight children 2 years\nlater. These earlier findings, specific to the preschool-first\ngrade period, show results similar to those found in the\npresent study across a longer time frame. The results of both\nstudies indicate the need for more research into family\nprocesses associated with childhood obesity.\nOne strength of the present study is the wide range of\necologically relevant variables studied over time in terms of\nfamily, school and after-school characteristics. The study is\nunique in that it includes children from 10 locations around\nthe US growing up in the early 1990s, at the beginning of the\nrise in childhood obesity. In addition, the findings are based\non longitudinal data, with height and weight measured\nfrequently across the children's first 12 years. The limitations\nof the study include the fact that ethnic minority groups are\nnot well enough represented in the sample to allow separate\nanalyses for African American or Hispanic children. Sec-\nondly, although growth was thoroughly studied, no other\nanthropometric measures of adiposity, such as skin-fold\nmeasurements or waist circumference, were obtained at all\ndata points. As BMI does not directly measure body fat, it is\nrecognized as a practical surrogate for adiposity.40 We did not\nhave access to parental weight data or to dietary intake of the\nchildren; thus, neither genetic factors nor the role of energy\nintake could be examined. Finally, the measure of physical\nactivity excluded periods of time when children participated\nin highly active sports or swimming and therefore under-\nestimated activity in some children.\nThe results of this study support the idea that overweight\nis multiply determined. We did not find one single factor\nthat was consistently linked to overweight status. This result\nis not surprising given the many societal and life-style\nchanges that have occurred during the period of increasing\nobesity in the US population. The present study is correla-\ntional in nature and therefore the factors identified as related\nto overweight cannot be interpreted as causal.

Children who were more\nphysically active and spent less time watching TV after\nschool were less likely to be overweight by age 12. From our\nresults, it is not possible to determine the direction of this\neffect; overweight children may prefer more sedentary\nactivity. Still, these findings suggest that parents might\nconsider the nature of the after-school arrangements they\nmake for their children and select those that emphasize\nactive play and exercise rather than sedentary activity.\nFurthermore, educators and recreation specialists who\norganize and manage after-school programs might take note\nof these results in selecting activities.\nIt is clear from the patterns of overweight among children\nin this sample that intervention to prevent obesity needs to\nbegin early. More than twice as many overweight preschoo-\nlers remained in that category until age 12 as returned to\nnormal weight once they reached school age. These findings\nsupport and extend those from an earlier study with this\nsame sample showing that the risk of overweight at age 12\nwas increased fivefold for children who attained the 85th\npercentile for BMI during the preschool period compared to\nchildren who never crossed into the `at-risk' BMI category\nin preschool.22 Even though effect sizes of the covariates\nstudied are relatively small, these small effects, noted among\nfamilies who were not selected because of their involvement\nin intervention programs, suggest that the contextual\nfactors examined here may be contributing to a population\nshift in body weight. Professionals and parents who are\naware of the likely persistence of overweight from early\nchildhood onward would do well to take steps to reduce\nenergy intake and increase energy output in all young\nchildren, and especially when children show disproportional\ngains in weight. Efforts to keep children's weight within\nnormal limits need to be maintained throughout children's\ngrowing years.\n"
