Identified stressors\nare mostly emotional, such as the death of a relative or a\nquarrel, but can also be physical, such as the use of cocaine\nor a subarachnoid haemorrhage.2 The complete pathophys-\niology of TS is unknown, but the leading hypothesis is that\noverstimulation of the myocardium by catecholamines\nelicited by a stressful trigger leads to the development of\nsevere contractile dysfunction, resulting in the characteristic\nImpact of long-term stress in Takotsubo\nsyndrome: Experience of patients\nSara Wallstr\u00f6m1,2, Kerstin Ulin1,2, Sylvia M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e41,\n Keywords\nTakotsubo syndrome, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress, gender theory, phenomenological hermeneutics,\nqualitative method\n1Institute of Health and Care Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy,\nUniversity of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden\n2University of Gothenburg Centre for Person-Centred Care,\nSahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden\n3Department of Cardiology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital,\nGothenburg, Sweden\n4Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy,\nUniversity of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden\nCorresponding author:\nSara Wallstr\u00f6m, Institute of Health and Care Sciences, Sahlgrenska\nSweden.\nEmail: sara.wallstrom@gu.se\nOriginal Article\napical akinesia in the left ventricular muscle.3 In the acute\nphase, TS mimics myocardial infarction and it is thought\nthat 1\u00ad2% of all patients with the clinical symptoms of a\nmyocardial infarction actually have TS. The mean age\nrange of patients with TS is between 58 and 75 and about\n90% of cases occur in women.2 The large discrepancy in\nthe prevalence of TS between men and women has long\nbeen established,2,4,5 but explanations of this are contradic-\ntory and no clear pathophysiological explanation has been\nestablished.6\u00ad8 Stress events are a common part of everyday\nlife9 and most people are not affected by TS, so these alone\ncannot explain the syndrome, although there are factors\nthat may make some people more susceptible to a stress\ntrigger. Risk factors such as hormonal processes, endothe-\nlial dysfunction, genetic factors and a lifetime prevalence\nof depression have been suggested.10\nThe concept of stress is not always clearly defined and\nthe term is commonly used to describe both stressors and\nthe response to stressors.11 Selye12 defined stress as a non-\nspecific response of the body to any demand placed on it;\nhe assumed that all positive and negative things that create\na stress reaction are stressors and that the body's response\nto different stressors is the same.12 Another widely used\ndefinition is that by Lazarus and Folkman,13 who viewed\nstress as a relationship between a person and the environ-\nment that taxes or exceeds the person's resources and\nendangers their well-being.13 A distinction is often made\nbetween acute stress, such as an earthquake or the sudden\ndeath of a relative, and long-term or chronic stress, such as\ncaring for a sick loved one or stress at work.11 In medical\nresearch, the concept has been adopted as a basis for exam-\nining the role of psychological factors in the causation and\nprogression of disease.9 In this study, stress is defined as a\ntaxing environment or event. The reaction of the body to\nthis environment or event is defined as the stress response.\nDespite the strong connection between acute stress and\nTS, there is a lack of research on how patients perceive\ntheir life situation before the onset of TS and whether they\nare subject to long-term stress. The aim of the study was to\ndescribe and interpret patients' narratives about long-term\nstress experienced before the onset of TS.\nMethods\nDesign\nTo fulfil the aim of this study, we chose a qualitative\nmethod, namely phenomenological hermeneutics, with an\nexplorative design. Narrative interviews were used to gain\nknowledge about the informants' personal experiences.\nThe phenomenological hermeneutical method was devel-\noped to explore lived experience, which made it suitable\nParticipants and settings\nParticipants were selected after coronary angiography and\nthe following inclusion criteria were used: (a) an established\ndiagnosis of TS according to the Gothenburg criteria,15\nwhich are used in the participating hospitals in Western\nSweden, in the previous six months; (b) being physically\nand mentally capable of participating; and (c) able to speak\nSwedish. A strategic sample was used to include partici-\npants of both sexes and of a wide age range. Twenty-five\npatients were asked to participate, either at hospital or\nby telephone after discharge; three declined, two were\nexcluded because no narrative could be obtained, and\none was excluded because she was not diagnosed with TS.\nThe remaining 19 participants were included in this study.\nThe characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors of these\npatients are described in Table 1; there was no difference\nbetween the men and women.\nEthical considerations\nThe study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review\nBoard of the University of Gothenburg (Application\nthe Declaration of Helsinki.16 Informed consent was\nobtained from each participant.\nData collection\nseven during hospital admission and 12 after discharge.\nIn two cases, a face-to-face meeting could not be arranged\nand the interviews were conducted over the phone. Data\nwere collected through narrative interviews, which lasted\nfor 15\u00ad120 minutes and were recorded and transcribed\nverbatim, resulting in rich descriptions. In total, the tran-\nInterpretation of data\nBy analysing the narratives in the form of text, it is possi-\nble to take part in other peoples' experiences, which are\notherwise personal. The phenomenological hermeneutic\napproach has been developed over the last two decades to\nprovide a structured and comprehensive way of interpreting\nTable 1.

It draws on both phenomenology\nand hermeneutics. From phenomenology, it takes its focus\non essential meaning and emphasizes that preconceptions\nshould be restrained. From hermeneutics, it takes the tra-\ndition of interpretation because phenomena conveyed\nthrough text cannot be understood without interpretation.\nThe analysis entails a circular stepwise process, back and\nforth between understanding and explaining the text. It\nconsists of three intertwined phases: na\u00efve reading, struc-\ntural analysis and interpretation of the whole.14\nNa\u00efve reading and structural analysis. In the na\u00efve reading,\nthe text is read through and an impression of the meaning\nof the text is formed. In the structural analysis, the text is\ndivided into meaning units; those parts of the text that are\nnot relevant to the aim are considered, but are not included\nin the analysis. The meaning units are abstracted and\nformed into sub-themes. The sub-themes are formed into\nthemes and possibly a main theme. The whole process of\nanalysis is a dialectical movement between focusing on the\nindividual parts and the overall impression of the text. The\nstructural analysis is a validation of the na\u00efve reading;\nit may be in concordance with it, but it may also reveal\nnew aspects of what was initially formulated as a guess or\nidea of what the text is about (i.e. na\u00efve reading). Several\nstructural analyses may be performed to explore aspects of\nInterpretation of the whole. In the final part of the analysis,\nthe pre-understanding, na\u00efve reading and structural analysis\nare taken into consideration when interpreting the overall\nmeaning of the text. To achieve a more profound under-\nstanding of the text, theoretical literature is consulted and\nreflected upon simultaneously with the interpretation of\nthe text.14 For this study, gender theory was chosen and\nthe interpretation of the whole has, in this paper, been\ncombined with the discussion.\nFindings\nThe first impression of the text was that, in patients\nwhere a stress trigger had occurred, this trigger was not\nexperienced as traumatic or very stressful. Instead, the\ninterviewees reported being subjected to low intensity\nstress for a long time before the onset of TS and they expe-\nrienced this as more burdensome. All of the interviewees\ndescribed that the circumstances had been present for a\nlong time and most described situations dating back years\nor even decades. Furthermore, the na\u00efve reading revealed\nthat the interviewees worried a lot, both about practical\nthings and for the people around them. The interviewees\ndid not seem at peace with their situation in life or how\ntheir life had turned out.\nThe structural analysis confirmed the first impressions\nof the na\u00efve reading that long-term stress was more bur-\ndensome for the interviewees than stress triggers. For this\nreason, the structural analysis focused on the meaning of\nliving under long-term stressful circumstances and not an\neventual stress trigger. The analysis represents the body of\ntext as a whole and every one of the 19 interviews is repre-\nsented in all of the themes.An overview of the main theme,\nthemes and sub-themes can be found in Table 2.\nWorn down to the bone\nThe analysis revealed the presence of a stressful life situ-\nation long before the onset of TS. This situation was\ncharacterized by feelings of injustice and powerlessness\nto change the situation. The interviewees felt that there\nwas no possible way to act that could ease their burden.\nFeelings of injustice regarding the situation and other peo-\nple's behaviour were present. Moreover, mistrust in other\npeoples'ability to perform tasks and take responsibility led\nto a constant state of readiness to help relieve other peo-\nples' worries and problems. Despite this, the interviewees\nwanted to be able to trust other people, to relax and not be\nconstantly ready to act. Continual dwelling on the past, on\nthe unsatisfying situation and worrying about the future\nrendered a barrier to living in the present. In addition, feel-\nings of inner stress, loneliness, not feeling part of a wider\ncontext and a feeling of being misunderstood were present\nat the same time as the interviewees built walls around\nthemselves and did not ask for help. The hopelessness\nand lack of power over the situation wore down personal\nTable 2.

This was a prolonged process that slowly peeled\naway individuals' resources until they balanced on the\nverge of illness. These experiences were the result of a\ncombined burden and not tied to specific events: `Yes,\ntired and weak as if I can't fight anymore' (patient 3).\nEverlasting responsibilities.The interviewees felt a need to\nprotect, help and worry about others: `I probably worry a\nlot and I should sort of protect our daughter' (patient 15).\nInstead of burdening others with their own problems, the\ninterviewees chose to keep them to themselves. For exam-\nple, one interviewee did not tell their family about a long\nperiod of illness. Moreover, a strong fa\u00e7ade and always\nbeing there for others was also important. Having lots of\nresponsibility was experienced as both a burden and enjoy-\nable in the sense that it entailed appreciation from others,\nwhich was desired. Busyness was a wanted burden because\nit provided the satisfaction of being needed and asked\nto help, but it was a burden when the influx of tasks and\nresponsibilities could not be controlled \u00ad for example, by\ncaring for a dependent family member. Furthermore, others\nalways asked for help with new tasks, such as painting,\ncleaning or watching children: `And it fell on me to prepare\nit. As it usually does. Partly I want to make the food and I\nfind it fun'(patient 2). Satisfaction was also found in being\nproficient, with the concomitant assumption that everyone\nelse should be equally proficient and active. When people\nwere not, or were less concerned with details, the inter-\nviewees found this irritating. Their activity made them feel\ndifferent from other people and not totally accepted. This,\ntogether with the influx of eternal responsibilities, culmi-\nnated in a sense of powerlessness.\nRecurring injustice. Not having needs met led to feelings of\nloneliness and abandonment. Furthermore, the interviewees\nreported receiving less appreciation than they thought they\ndeserved, and feeling that when appreciation was given it\nwas too little, too late. Living in an unhealthy relationship\nwas one circumstance where needs were not meet. Inter-\nviewees gave a lot of themselves and were disappointed\nthat others did not appreciate that they did not want to spend\nall their time servicing others \u00ad for example, by helping\nwith choirs. To be hardworking and attentive was consid-\nered a virtue and this was expected from others. When\nthese standards were not lived up to, it was a disappoint-\nment to not get the same consideration in return. The inter-\nviewees felt that others should notice their needs and that\ntheir own responsibility in asking for and receiving help\nand support was lost, which resulted in a sense of power-\nlessness: `I expect it to be in order when I come to do\nthings because I always leave everything in order ... I\ndon't understand why I waste energy on it because I know\nit won't be in order' (patient 17). To always be considerate\nto others and not receive the same in return was seen as a\ngreat injustice. Having to live with recurrent conflicts that\ncould not be avoided was one example. This frustration to\nnot be able to influence the situation led to feelings of\npowerlessness, hopelessness and injustice: `No, he sold\neverything online. I called the police ... I called the insur-\nance agency, nobody does anything' (patient 18). Remem-\nbrance of events in the past that had led to disappointment\nresulted in feelings of sadness over how things turned out.\nThe interviewees had always worked hard and done the\nright thing, but they were still not rewarded. They had\nexperienced a lack of control over these events and they\nwere stained by unjust treatment. The choice to keep things\nactive by dwelling on the past, which could not be accepted,\nmade it impossible to live in the present and find peace:\n`Yes, I became so sad in a way that I hadn't done, taken\ncare of it before' (patient 7).\nPerpetual uncertainty.This theme is characterized by a\nsense of powerlessness over the situation, which was seen\nas static and impossible to change. Endurance of the situa-\ntion was a survival mechanism and a way of diminishing\nthe situation. The acceptance of the life situation and the\nsense of powerlessness became an almost self-imposed\ninability to change the life situation. The interviewees\noften diminished the severity of their problems. One way\nof maintaining a capacity of endurance was to try to turn\nevery situation into something positive, even though there\nwas nothing positive in the situation. One interviewee said\nthat a positive thing that came out of their daughter falling\nill was that they could help her. The diminishment of\nproblems and always trying to see the positive aspect of\nsituations were survival mechanisms to gain some control\nover the situation and to facilitate endurance. Furthermore,\nit was very important to be appropriate and keep up appear-\nances. Things should be done in the correct way and a\nfeeling of doing things a little better than other people was\napparent. Help was not asked for because the interviewees\ndid not want to complain or be bothersome. Moreover,\nasking for help may have resulted in refusal, which was\nfeared: `I tinker a lot, it must be in a certain order, place\ndemands on myself. Actually perfect' (patient 13). An\ninner insecurity or fear of being insufficient was almost\nconstantly present. This worrying was not directed towards\nanything specific. Instead, some interviewees described it\nas part of their personality. If one worrying thing was\nresolved, it was immediately replaced by something new:\n`I stress myself when it's something even though I don't\nneed to do it I do it internally and it's tiresome. Why do\nyou do that? I wish I could be calm' (patient 11).\nInterpretation of the whole and\ndiscussion\nThe analysis of the text showed that the interviewees lived\nunder stressful circumstances long before the onset of TS.\nThese stressful life circumstances were characterized by\nexperiences of everlasting demands and responsibilities,\nbeing unjustly treated, not getting what they were entitled\nto, and not being able to control or get out of the situation.\nLong-term stress before the onset of TS has also been\nfound in previous studies. Kastaun et al.17 showed that\npatients with TS had had more stressful life events, such as\nabuse, severe injury or spousal loss, than both patients\nwith myocardial infarction and healthy controls. A higher\nfrequency of long-term stress \u00ad for example, recurrent\nconflicts or a dependent family member \u00ad than patients\nwith myocardial infarction was also found by Delmas\net al.18 The findings in our study show that the same or\nsimilar situations \u00ad unhealthy relationships, a dependent\nfamily member or recurrent conflicts \u00ad led to long-term\nstress that wore down the resources of the interviewees.\nThe presence of long-term stressful circumstances is in\nagreement with a previous interview study.19 Our findings,\ntogether with the previously reported studies, give a clear\nindication that the patients' life situation was perceived as\nstressful in agreement with the definition of Lazarus and\nFolkman13 and should therefore create biological responses\nto the taxing environment.12 Moreover, the connection\nbetween long-term stress and heart disease, primarily car-\ndiovascular, is long established.11,20 Psychosocial stress,\nsuch as described in this study, leads both to an increased\nrisk of myocardial infarction20 and a poorer prognosis after\nan infarction.21 Long-term stress should be considered a\nrisk factor for TS.\nTo examine the sex discrepancy in the prevalence of TS\nfurther and to gain an understanding of why the interview-\nees may be exposed to long-term stress, our findings were\nanalysed from a gender theory perspective. Gender theory\ndoes not view disease as a passive unfolding of biology,\nbut instead tries to understand how culture and social\nstructures affect the biological body and therefore contrib-\nute to disease.22 The different life circumstances, such as\ndifferent amounts of long-term stress, of women and men\ntake their toll on the human body and, at least partly, deter-\nmine what diseases people are affected by,23 which is in\nline with the described definition of stress.12,13 For exam-\nple, although men have a shorter life expectancy, women\nreport more strain and psychological symptoms, such as\nstress.9 The intrinsic power gradient in the gender structure\nof society \u00ad in which women as a group have less power,\ncontrol and influence over their situation and life than men\nas a group \u00ad is thought to be one reason that mental illness\nis more prevalent in women than in men. This is a social\nstructure, which we are all co-creators of and which is not\nthe result of individual actions.22\nTo gain a more complete explanation of how inequality\nis structured and reproduced in formally and judicially\nequal societies, we can use love as an analytical tool.\nAccording to J\u00f3nasd\u00f3ttir,24 the dominating form of socio-\nsexual relations is love power, generally given voluntarily\nby women and exploited by men. Men gain access to the\nresources, care and love of women without returning these\nresources. This happens under stipulations that make\nwomen incapable of building emotional reserves and\nauthoritative social powers. This is possible as a result of\nthe different stipulations for women and men. Women\nneed to love and be loved to be socio-existentially con-\nfirmed \u00ad that is, to become a person. However, women do\nnot fully control how and under which conditions they\nmay legitimately use their capacities. The consequence of\nthis exploitation is an exhaustion of capacities.24\nThe findings from this study are concordant with gen-\nder theory22 and the theoretical writing of J\u00f3nasd\u00f3ttir.24\nBoth the female and male interviewees adopted or were\nassigned female roles, such as taking care of and worrying\nabout others, organizing and being responsible for their\nhome life. The findings showed that the interviewees gave\na lot of themselves and did not feel that they received the\nsame in return. They also needed to be busy, helpful and\nnot be cumbrous to feel confirmed and validated as per-\nsons. J\u00f3nasd\u00f3ttir24 writes that women need to love to be\nconfirmed; the interviewees needed to help and protect \u00ad\nthat is, love \u00ad others to feel accepted. Moreover, the intrin-\nsic power gradient in gender structure is evident in these\nfindings. The interviewees could not control the stipula-\ntions of how and when they assisted others, which was\nfrustrating. The findings show that the interviewees did\nnot fully feel a part of society, which was also described by\nJ\u00f3nasd\u00f3ttir.24 Furthermore, the interviewees felt trapped\nand that they could not change their circumstances. These\ncircumstances slowly drained the interviewees of power\nand resources and carved away their resilience. Living\nunder these circumstances wore the interviewees down to\nthe degree that they felt their capacity was exhausted and\nthe smallest stressor could tip them over the edge.\nFurther research is needed to investigate whether there\nis a higher prevalence of stress among patients affected by\nTS than among patients with other heart diseases or the\ngeneral population. This could be achieved by using ques-\ntionnaires. A sense of coherence, depression and anxiety\nare other aspects that may influence the perception of\nstress and could therefore give further insights if they were\ninvestigated.\nAccording to Lincoln and Guba,25 the trustworthiness\nof qualitative studies consists of four parts: credibility,\ndependability, confirmability and transferability. One sin-\ngle truth is not sought in phenomenological hermeneutics\nbecause there is always more than one way of interpreting\nthe text.26 However, not all possible interpretations are\nequally probable. The timing of the interviews in relation\nto the onset of TS can be seen as a limitation. This could\nhave caused some recall bias, but because the primary\nfocus of the study was how the interviewees lived long\nterm before the onset of TS, this was not considered to be\na major drawback. Some of the narratives described events\nthat happened years or, in some cases, decades, before the\ninterview, so a couple of months of lag from the diagnosis\nof TS to the interview probably did not greatly affect the\nparticipants' memory. The analysis of the text was dis-\ncussed by SW, KU, SM and IE until agreement was met to\nguarantee as truthful and reproducible an interpretation as\npossible. The first interview was conducted by IE and\nthe remaining by SW. IE has long experience of clinical\ncardiac care, whereas SW has none. This was assumed to\noffer a more unbiased interview process. Transferability is\nalways a delicate matter in qualitative studies.\nA second limitation of the study was the sample size\ncompared with quantitative studies. Nineteen interviews\nare considered to be a large sample for a qualitative study\nand the great mass of text is an indicator of rich interviews.\nIn addition, only two men were included. Although more\nmen would have been desirable, the sex distribution of the\nparticipants is in line of that of the disease.2 Given the rela-\ntively large sample size, the large body of text and the\ndiversity in the age of the interviewees, the findings should\nbe transferable to other settings when the few narratives\nfrom men are taken into account.\nConclusions and clinical implications\nThese findings indicate that stressful circumstances, such\nas gender structures in society and the entailing social\nroles, may cause vulnerability. This vulnerability, in turn,\ncontributes to an increased susceptibility to acute psycho-\nlogical or physical stressors, which triggers TS. This\nstudy showed that long-term exposure to stress could be\nan important predictor of why a minority of people are\naffected by TS following an acute stressor.\nIn conclusion, this study indicates that prolonged per-\nceived psychosocial stress is a component in the onset\nof TS. Prolonged psychosocial stress, enhanced by the\nidentities ascribed by society's gender structure, wears\ndown defences and creates vulnerability to an acute\nstressor. The acute stressor is not the sole cause of TS, but\nrather the `last straw that breaks the camel's back'.\nImplications for Practice\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Long-term stress was present long before onset\nof Takotsubo syndrome, which may have worn\ndown the defences of the interviewees and\ncaused a vulnerability to this syndrome.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Gender structure and its division of labour\nmeans that women and men are exposed to\ndifferent types of strains \u00ad for example, stress\n\u00ad which take their toll on the body.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Health care professionals need to be aware\nthat the gender structure in society may influ-\nence health.\n"
