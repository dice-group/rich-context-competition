Many authors also believe that it would be good to\nfind a compromise between these two ideals.

This article presents a proposal which seeks\nto combine elements of all three options.\nIn brief, I propose a form of mixed-member electoral\nsystem in which voters elect two types of legislators, only\none of which possesses the right to dismiss the cabinet in a\nno-confidence vote.

In the so-called \"majoritarian\" ideal,\nvoters can make a clear choice between two parties, one of\nwhich forms a stable majority cabinet that can be held\nresponsible for its performance in office (Powell, 2000). In\nterms of voter support, however, this model is only majori-\ntarian in a perfect \"Duvergerian\" equilibrium; that is, when\nvoters are deterred from voting for third candidates, poten-\ntial third candidates are deterred from entering the competi-\ntion and the same two-party system exists in every district.\nReal-world versions of this vision, often based on plurality\nrule (first-past-the-post), typically allow a minority of vot-\ners to rule over a majority. In UK parliamentary elections,\nfor example, which follow first-past-the-post rule, a party\ncan win only 36.8 percent of the vote, as the Conservative\nThe proportional vision has a commonsensical version\nthat focuses on the ideal of proportional representation\n(PR) combined with legislative majority rule. This combi-\nnation is much more likely to empower an actual majority\nvision goes further, though, and also requires that parlia-\nmentary parties have proportional influence on legislation.\nHe sketches two different specifications of this idea\n(Ganghof, 2015). One is super-majoritarian in that parties\nform oversized portfolio or legislative coalitions. The other\nis majoritarian in that different minimal-winning coalitions\nProportional influence then means that all parties get some\ninfluence on at least some issues. It is this latter version of\nthe proportional vision on which I focus here (see also\nExisting compromise designs\nIn purely parliamentary systems the obvious starting point\nfor a compromise between the majoritarian and propor-\ntional ideals is the electoral system. For instance, if parties\nin a proportional system are induced to form two compet-\ning pre-electoral coalitions, voters can then elect a party\nthat represents their views and more or less directly select\none of two cabinets. Mixed-member proportional (MMP)\nsystems and systems with a majority bonus can be inter-\npreted in terms of this type of balancing (Shugart, 2001).\nHowever, the degree of (mechanical) proportionality is\ntypically limited in this approach, because a very high\nnumber of parties and a multi-dimensional structure of\nparty positions make the formation of two comprehensive\npre-election blocs less likely (Ganghof et al., 2015).\nMoreover, recent elections in MMPcountries like Germany\nshow that limited departures from pure proportionality\nsuch as a five percent legal threshold of representation\nmight not be sufficient to achieve the goals of the \"majori-\ntarian\" vision (see below).\nPresidential systems might also achieve a compromise.\nThe popular election of a fixed-term president is inherently\ndisproportional and virtually guarantees that voters will be\nable to identify cabinet alternatives as well as ensures cabi-\nnet stability (Cheibub, 2009). The legislature, on the other\nhand, can be elected proportionally to fairly represent the\nposition of the (issue-specific) median voter (Colomer and\nNegretto, 2005). The downside of presidentialism, how-\never, is its negative effect on the programmatic capacities\nof political parties (Samuels and Shugart, 2010). Due to the\ninstitutional separation between the legislature and the pop-\nularly elected executive, a party loses control over its presi-\ndential candidate and \u00ad if the candidate is successful \u00ad over\nthe elected president. Hence, while the legislature may be\nproportionally elected, the parties therein might not have\nthe capacity to deliver programmatic representation.\nThis problem of presidentialism can be avoided by shift-\ning the locus of power separation into the legislature. In\nAustralia, in particular, we find bicameral systems in which\nthe upper house has the same democratic legitimacy as the\nlower house, as well as an absolute veto over legislation,\nbut no right to dismiss the cabinet. This renders it possible\nto make the lower house a \"majoritarian\" confidence cham-\nber and the institutionally separated upper house a propor-\ntional legislature (Ganghof, 2014). However, this model\ndoes also have some downsides. Since lower house mem-\nbers in Australia are elected in single-member districts\n(based on alternative vote (AV) systems), single-party\nmajorities at the national or state levels are far from guaran-\nteed. Moreover, bicameralism implies that overall propor-\ntionality may be limited by a small size of the upper house.\nThird, if the upper house is used for PR, its capacity to\ndeliver territorial representation tends to be reduced.\nThe proposal\nMy proposal modifies the Australian solution by combin-\ning it with a mixed-member electoral system.2 The idea is\nto make the confidence-conferring, majoritarian part of\nthe legislature not a separate chamber but a differentiated\nchamber within a highly proportional legislature (see\nFigure 1). What the proposed system shares with\nAustralian bicameralism is that the cabinet survives inde-\npendently from one of two equally legitimate parts of the\nlegislature. I therefore refer to it as \"semi-parliamentary\"\nVoting rules\nThere is one district for the entire parliament and voters\nhave one vote to choose between party lists. They can rank\nas many lists as they like in order of preference. Their votes\nare counted twice. First, voters' first preferences determine\nthe proportional composition of parliament \u00ad with no or\nonly a low legal threshold. Second, voters' rankings are\nused to determine the two parties with the greatest support,\nbased on a modified AV system. The parties with the least\nfirst-place votes are iteratively eliminated, and their votes\nare transferred to each voter's second-most preferred party,\nthird-most preferred party, and so on. In contrast to a nor-\nmal AV system, the process does not stop when one party\nhas received more than 50 percent of the votes, but contin-\nues until all but two parties are eliminated. Only these two\ntop parties receive \"confidence seats\" in proportion to their\nfinal vote shares in the AV contest. One of these two parties\ngets all of the seats it receives based on the proportional\ncount as confidence seats and thereby determines the size\nof the \"confidence chamber\".\nTable 1 illustrates the procedure with a fictitious exam-\nple of a 100-member legislature. The first column shows\neight parties A to H, the second column their proportionally\nallocated seats. After the elimination of all but the top two\nparties, the winning party B has gained 57 percent of the\nvotes, the runner-up A 43 percent. Given its proportional\nvote share of first preferences, B gets 23 seats overall, all of\nwhich are \"confidence seats\". A's confidence seats are\ndetermined based on its two-party vote share, so that it gets\ncomprises 40 members.4 In order to maintain proportional-\nity in the legislature, parties receive top-up seats. For par-\nties C to H, all of their seats are top-up seats. Party A, the\nopposition party in the confidence chamber, receives both\nconfidence and top-up seats.5\nThe system allows voters to confer two mandates. With\ntheir first preferences they confer a mandate on the fairly\ndetermined legislative majority, which might change from\nissue to issue. Analytically, we may think of this as a man-\ndate for the issue-specific median party. However, not all\nvoters engage in pure proximity voting, so that the median\nparty in parliament does not necessarily represent the\nmedian voter. In any case, the moral legitimacy of the leg-\nislative mandate does not depend on spatial preference\nlocations, but on the fairness (proportionality) of the\nprocedure and ultimately on the value of political equality\nBased on voters' fuller preference rankings, a mandate\nto form the cabinet is conferred to the winner of the AV\ncontest. Given the fairness argument for PR, the moral\nlegitimacy of this additional contest must largely be based\non instrumental considerations, such as facilitating issue-\nspecific decision-making (Ward and Weale, 2010) or\nachieving accountability (Powell, 2000). The voting\nmethod for the confidence chamber should, nevertheless,\nbe as fair as practically feasible. AV is preferable to plural-\nity rule in that no votes are wasted and the winner com-\nmands an absolute majority of the votes in the final count.\nI do not have the space to systematically compare AV to\nalternatives such as approval voting, the Coombs rule or the\nBorda count, but want to highlight three attractive proper-\nties of AV: first, a party with an absolute majority of first-\npreferences votes will always be selected as the winner;\nsecond, voters can submit incomplete preference rankings\nwithout being discriminated against (cf. Emerson, 2013);\nand third, a manipulation of the outcome via strategic vot-\ning would require a rather high level of sophistication\nThe proposed system also aims at combining different\nideals of accountability. First, the prime minister and the\ncabinet are accountable to the majority in the confidence\nchambers. If the AV contest selected the government with-\nout giving the strongest opposition party seats in the confi-\ndence chamber, the governing party's control over the\ncabinet would be reduced (as it is in a presidential system).\nWith the presence of the opposition party, the cabinet's\nposition cannot move too far away from its party without\nrisking defections and a successful no-confidence vote.\nSecond, the legislature as a whole is also charged with the\ntask of controlling the cabinet. Since this cabinet is likely to\nhave minority status in the legislature, this task can be more\nmeaningfully pursued than in the pure majoritarian vision\n(Stone, 2008). Third, relatively pure PR allows for the easy\nentry of new parties, which provides a way to keep all\nexisting parliamentary parties accountable (McGann,\nOne concern about the proposed system should be men-\ntioned. The proliferation of small parties may be greater\nthan under a pure PR parliamentary system, everything else\nbeing equal, because voters can use their second preference\nto choose the cabinet. It would, therefore, be possible that a\nrather small (centrist) party can form the government. In\nthe example in Table 1, the winning party B is only the\nsecond-largest party in the proportional vote. I have argued\nthat this is justifiable, since the winning party (1) needs\nabsolute majority support in the final count of the AV con-\ntest and (2) must build majority coalitions in the propor-\ntional parliament to pass legislation. If voters themselves\ndo not come to see it this way, though, perceived legitimacy\nmay suffer. This is an important point for further\nFigure 1. A proportional, semi-parliamentary system.\nSource: own composition.\n- - >: confidence authority; : election.\n4 Research and Politics \nconsideration. Note, however, that if this were indeed a\nproblem, it would be possible to choose a higher legal\nthreshold for the proportional count. A semi-parliamentary\nsystem is more flexible than a pure parliamentary system in\nthat it sets two distinct thresholds (cf. Ganghof, 2016): in\nthis case, a legal threshold of representation for the propor-\ntional count and an implicit threshold of confidence author-\nity in the AV contest.\nInter-institutional rules\nFrom the perspective of legislative decision-making, one\nmight hope that the outcome of the AV contest is centrist, so\nthat cabinet's policy position is identical or close to that of\nthe median legislative party on the most important issue\ndimension(s). This would likely make it easier for the cabinet\nto win the majority support of the proportional parliament at\nlarge to pass legislation. A centrist outcome is far from guar-\nanteed, however. For one thing, even in a one-dimensional\nspace and with pure proximity voting, the outcome of theAV\ncontest may systematically diverge from the median voter\n(McGann et al., 2002). For another, complications like mul-\ntidimensionality, party identification, valence advantages,\ncandidate characteristics or directional voting might all con-\ntribute to (moderately) non-centrist cabinets (McDonald\net al., 2012). This outcome might be desirable, if the majori-\ntarian vision is meant to give voters a clear choice between\nalternatives. Yet it also implies that the two mandates can\nconflict. I will briefly sketch institutional rules that might\ncontribute to achieving a reasonable balance between them,\nbut other solutions also exist (Stone, 2008).\nThe legislature as a whole and the confidence chamber\nshould both have the right to initiate and amend legisla-\ntion. The legislature must certainly possess a veto over all\n(non-budgetary) legislation. It might be denied a veto\nover the annual budget, as this veto could be turned into a\nde facto no-confidence vote. This problem should not be\noverstated, however, because the opposition party in the\nconfidence chamber is unlikely to have a majority in the\nproportional legislature. Most upper houses in Australia\ndo possess a budget veto: the Australian Senate as well as\nthe Legislative Councils in South Australia, Western\nAustralia and Tasmania.6\nThe confidence chamber, and hence the cabinet, might\nalso be given a veto over legislation to protect its core pro-\ngram \u00ad as is, of course, the case for the lower houses in\nAustralian bicameralism. However, it is not entirely clear\nthat this is necessary. Given the PR-based legitimacy of an\nissue-specific legislative majority, we might want the gov-\nernment to take its preferences into account. A partial sub-\nstituteforthecabinet'svetopowercouldbeits(unavoidable)\ndissolution power. If the cabinet loses confidence in the\nconfidence chamber and no new cabinet can be formed\n(which is likely), the entire parliament has to be dissolved\nand new elections held. This implies that the cabinet can\nvirtually always threaten to dissolve the entire parliament if\nlegislation is passed \u00ad or vetoed \u00ad in ways that undermine\nits core program. This dissolution threat allows the cabinet\nto defend its policies against the median parliamentary\nparty, if public opinion is favorable to these policies (Becher\nOf course, veto and dissolution powers are blunt instru-\nments to solve a conflict of mandates. A complementary\nrule would be to allow the cabinet (or its majority in the\nconfidence chamber) to refer only the conflicted issue\nback to the voters.An analogous solution has been adopted\nin New South Wales, where a popular referendum, initi-\nated by the lower house, is the only way to resolve bicam-\neral deadlock on a particular bill. If the cabinet is given a\nveto over legislation, the legislative majority should prob-\nably also be able to initiate a referendum on a deadlocked\nproposal. Giving both agents this power would give\ngreater bargaining strength to whichever agent's position\nis deemed closer to the issue-specific median voter. Given\nthe inherent uncertainty of a referendum, both agents\nwould generally have strong incentives to compromise\nand avoid the referendum.\nAn illustration\nGermany has a parliamentary system with a MMP electoral\nsystem and a five percent legal threshold of representation.\nTable 1. A semi-parliamentary system with a 100-member legislature.\nParty Seats based on primary votes Final top party vote share Confidence seats Legislative top-up seats\nIn the past, this system balanced elements of the two visions\nreasonably well (Shugart, 2001). It limited the number of\nparties and helped to organize them into two competing\nblocs, while also achieving a high degree of empirical pro-\nportionality. Moreover, it allowed party elites to generally\navoid Grand Coalitions of the major parties. Recently,\nthough, elections have failed to approximate either of the\ntwo visions.\nConsider the latest federal election of 2013 (Poguntke\nand von Dem Berge, 2014). Figure 2 shows parties' prefer-\nences in two dimensions based on the 2014 Chapel Hill sur-\nvey. The boldfaced labels indicate parties that gained\nparliamentary representation; parties with less than two\npercent of the vote are excluded. Almost 17 percent of the\nGerman voters wasted their votes by selecting parties that\ndid not pass the threshold. The most important of these par-\nties were the Liberals (FDP), the Euro-skeptic Alternative\nfor Germany (AfD) and the Pirate Party.7 Despite this sub-\nstantial disproportionality, though, crucial goals of the\nmajoritarian vision were not achieved. Voters could not\nidentify competing cabinet options before the election, as\nthere were no broad pre-electoral alliances. The election\nresulted in a Grand Coalition of Christian and Social\nDemocrats, controlling 80 percent of the seats in Bundestag;\nthis was the second Grand Coalition in the last three federal\nelections. The opposition currently exists only on the left\nand does not represent a feasible alternative government.\nWith the system proposed here, the five percent thresh-\nold could have been abolished or significantly reduced.\nThis would have led to a fairer and more multidimensional\nrepresentation of voter preferences in the legislative pro-\ncess. The AfD would have represented the Euro-skeptic\nposition on the right (on the EU dimension not shown in the\nFigure), the Liberals would have stood for the combination\nof economic and social liberalism. At the same time, voters\ncould have directly chosen a stable one-party cabinet. The\nChristian Democrats (CDU/CSU) would probably have\nwon the AV contest. They could thus have governed with\nflexible, issue-specific majorities. Where the CDU was not\nthe issue-specific median party, the party that was could\nhave initiated policy change against the government or\nvetoed legislation.\nIn the particular example, the proposed system would\nprobably have reduced the bargaining strength of the\nSocial Democrats, who would likely have lost their veto\nplayer status as a cabinet party. But this is not due to any\nsystematic bias. To the contrary, Germany's Social\nDemocrats seem disadvantaged under the current system,\nbecause a center-left portfolio coalition that includes the\nLeft Party is opposed by important parts of both parties.\nSocial Democrats have thus been torn between the incen-\ntive to capture the median voter and the effort to maintain\na leftist profile in order to limit electoral losses and facili-\ntate a center-left portfolio coalition. This sort of asymmet-\nric coordination failure would be less consequential in the\nproposed system. Since the Social Democrats would not\nneed a coalition partner to get into office, they would be\nfree to pursue an office-oriented strategy of median cap-\nture; and if they did win office, the Left Party would be\nfree to support a Social Democratic cabinet on a selective,\nissue-specific basis.\nPrima facie, it might seem that the proposed system\nwould be unstable, as the opposition parties could coordi-\nnate to change it (if constitutional amendment rules and\ntheir combined seat share allow this). However, a party like\nthe Social Democrats might well prefer the chance of form-\ning a one-party government some of the time to being a\njunior cabinet party most of the time; and the smaller oppo-\nsition parties might benefit from greater issue-specific leg-\nislative influence without having to assume responsibility\nfor the entire government program. Stability would also\nincrease if voters came to value the system and threatened\nto sanction reforms.\nConclusion\nIt might seem unlikely that established democracies would\nconsider the kind of system proposed here, but this should\nnot keep us from further analyzing its positive and norma-\ntive advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, elements of\nsuch a system might be worth considering in efforts to\ndemocratize complex systems like the European Union.\nGiven the partisan fragmentation of the European\nParliament, a purely parliamentary system of government\nwould be unlikely to give European voters a clear choice\nbetween alternative mandates. It is more likely to lead to a\npermanent Grand Coalition. This is partly why the direct\nelection of a European president often appears to be the\nonly viable path to meaningful democratization (cf. Hix,\nNote: See text; numbers in parentheses are vote and seat shares,\nrespectively. Vote share is the list vote (\"Zweitstimme\").\n6 Research and Politics \nhave a strongly negative long-term effect on the emergence\nof programmatic European parties \u00ad and thus on the EU's\noverall democratic capacity. If we want to give European\nvoters a clear choice without undermining programmatic\nparties and PR, adequately Europeanized elements of the\nsemi-parliamentary system proposed here might be worth\nconsidering. But this is the topic for another paper.\n"
