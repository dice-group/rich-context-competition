With\norganizational learning as analytical lens, we discern two process patterns: \"drifting\" starts with an emphasis\non experiential learning and shifts later to cognitive search; \"leaping,\" in contrast, starts with an emphasis\non cognitive search and shifts later to experiential learning. Both drifting and leaping can result in radical\nbusiness model innovations, while their occurrence depends on whether a new business model takes off\nfrom an existing model and when it goes into operation.

A BM defines how an organization creates\nand appropriates value and thereby captures essential features of how companies conduct their\nCorresponding author:\nHans Berends, Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, VU University Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, 1081\nHV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nEmail: j.j.berends@vu.nl\nArticle\nbusiness (Zott et al., 2011). Innovative BMs constitute significant sources of competitive advan-\ntage and firm performance (Casadesus-Masanell and Zhu, 2013; Desyllas and Sako, 2013; Zott and\nAmit, 2007), so organizations are motivated to innovate BMs by making fundamental changes in\nthe way they create and appropriate value.\nDespite the attractiveness of BM innovation, its pursuit faces substantial challenges and is prone\nto failure (Pauwels and Weiss, 2008). Difficulties arise due to uncertainty about the effectiveness\nof new BMs (Andries and Debackere, 2007) and the complexity of those models, as configurations\nof interdependent BM components (Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013; Klang et al., 2014).\nInteractions among components make the development of an effective configuration more difficult\nbecause none of the components can be considered in isolation, and their possible interactions\nincrease the number of effects to take into account (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000), especially under\nuncertainty, when those interactions remain unknown.\nFurther complications arise for established firms that develop their new BM in parallel with an\nexisting one (Mezger, 2014). BM innovation in established firms may draw on components of an\nexisting configuration to create synergies (Kim and Min, 2015; Markides and Charitou, 2004), but\nit also may suffer from forces of inertia acting on its components, as well as potential conflicts\nbetween old and new BMs (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000). These\nchallenges raise questions about how established firms might still find ways to pursue BM\ninnovation.\nSo far though, the process of BM innovation in established firms has received insufficient\nresearch attention (Arend, 2013; Demil et al., 2015). Publications that have attended to the process\ndimensions of BM innovation offer conflicting assumptions and findings: some emphasize the\ndesign of BMs (e.g. Chatterjee, 2013; Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), others emphasize emergent,\niterative processes such as trial-and-error learning and experimentation (Dmitriev et al., 2014;\nMcGrath, 2010; Sosna et al., 2010) or suggest that design may be followed by refinement or adjust-\nment after the BM has been implemented (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Demil and Lecocq, 2010;\nLehoux et al., 2014). Moreover, only few studies provide comparative investigations of BM inno-\nvation in the specific context of established firms (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Mezger, 2014; S\u00e1nchez\nand Ricart, 2010). In particular, we lack insight into how the specific challenges for established\nfirms affect the process of innovation as it unfolds over time.\nThe question that we address in this article is the following: How do business model innovation\nprocesses unfold over time in established organizations? To answer this question, we investigated\nmultiple cases (Eisenhardt, 1989) using a process research approach to trace trajectories of BM\ninnovation in established firms (Langley, 1999; Pettigrew, 1990). We considered BM innovation\nrelative to a firm's existing BM(s) (e.g. Massa and Tucci, 2014) and we studied four cases in which\nestablished firms added a new BM to existing one(s). We use organizational learning theory as an\nanalytical lens (Levitt and March, 1988) because several authors have referred to innovation in\ngeneral (e.g. Garud and Van de Ven, 1992), and BM innovation in particular (e.g. Mezger, 2014;\nSosna et al., 2010) as a learning process. Moreover, we draw on the distinction between cognitive\nsearch and experiential modes of organizational learning, which have been used before to investi-\ngate dynamics in complex systems of interdependent components (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000).\nWe contribute to literature on BMs in several ways. First, we advance the BM concept by argu-\ning that it has both cognitive and action dimensions, which form a generative duality. Second, we\nprovide systematic insights into the processes of BM innovation in established organizations,\nwhich involve multiple learning mechanisms. This integrates and extends prior studies that suggest\nsingle modes of learning and shows the distinct and complementary contributions of cognitive\nsearch and experiential learning mechanisms. Third, we show that these mechanisms combine into\ntwo distinct patterns that either start from cognitive search and shift to experiential learning (which\nwe label \"leaping\") or else start with experiential learning and move to cognitive search (which we\nlabel \"drifting\"). The drifting pattern differs from dominant conceptions of BM innovation and\nshows that a process that starts incrementally can also lead to radical BM innovation. We find that\ndifferences between the leaping and drifting patterns depend on the degree to which a BM innova-\ntion trajectory can take off from an existing BM configuration and whether the BM can go into\noperation early. Finally, we explain how the relation of new BMs to existing BMs of established\norganizations affects the BM innovation process.\nTheoretical background\nBusiness models\nA common feature of BM conceptualizations is that they consider BMs as configurations of multi-\nple components (Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013; Morris et al., 2005). Researchers use vari-\nous labels to characterize BM components (Zott et al., 2011). Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010)\npropose a widely used, detailed framework: A value proposition is the core component; activities,\nresources, partnerships, and cost structure are the components needed for value creation; and cus-\ntomer segments, customer relationships, distribution channels, and revenue streams define how\nvalue gets delivered and how some of that value may be captured. This conceptualization is used\nin several academic studies (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Ghezzi, 2013), and the components can be\nmapped onto other frameworks (Morris et al., 2005; Zott et al., 2011), so it represents a good\nchoice for our analysis.\nAs a configuration of components, a BM involves interdependent strategic decisions. The effec-\ntiveness of any set of BM components depends heavily on the interactions among those compo-\nnents, as was evident in the example of Polaroid shifting from instant printing photography to\ndigital photography, without changing its revenue model (Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000). This charac-\nteristic of BMs--namely, that they feature interdependent components--relates them to broader\nmanagement literature that considers combinations of interdependent decision variables (Billinger\net al., 2014; Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000), which may display complementarities (Milgrom and\nRoberts, 1995) or \"fit\" (Siggelkow, 2001). When a BM achieves fit, it consists of a coherent set of\nreinforcing choices (Morris et al., 2005). Mismatches instead occur when BM components have\nadverse or conflicting implications for other components (Lehoux et al., 2014).\nThe configurational nature of BMs complicates the process of BM innovation because the\nunderlying interactions among BM components may be hard to predict and difficult to change over\ntime (Demil and Lecocq, 2010). BM innovation involves changes in multiple components, and the\neventual outcomes depend on the interactions between all components involved. This adds to the\nuncertainty associated with BM innovation, making it hard to predict a priori whether a particular\nIn established firms that pursue a new BM alongside an existing one, the existing configuration\nof components may help or hinder the establishment of new BMs. A new BM might have synergy\nwith the existing model, when the old and the new models share some components, such as tech-\nexisting configuration may also create cognitive inertia because existing BMs shape managerial\nthinking and distort perceptions of novel opportunities (Cavalcante et al., 2011; Tripsas and Gavetti,\n2000). Existing configurations also create structural barriers when new uses of components con-\nflict with the relations of those components embedded in the existing configuration (Chesbrough,\n2010). The associated conflicts of interest may create internal resistance (e.g. Chesbrough and\nBM innovation and organizational learning\nTo better understand the process of BM innovation, we use organizational learning as a theoretical\nlens, so that we can leverage a fundamental duality. That is, BMs have been conceptualized as both\ncognitive artifacts and patterns of action (Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010; Massa and Tucci,\n2014). On the one hand, BMs have been viewed as a cognitive phenomenon (Furnari, 2015;\nand Spicer, 2010), cognitive instruments (Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013), heuristics\n(Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002), logics (Teece, 2010), and blueprints (Osterwalder and\nPigneur, 2010). These views assert that BMs exist in a cognitive domain. On the other hand, the\nconcept of BMs is used to refer to what organizations do, such that they have been defined as activ-\nity systems (Zott and Amit, 2010), sets of routines (Winter and Szulanski, 2001), or patterns of\naction (Brousseau and Penard, 2007). We use this duality of representation (cognition) and reality\n(action) as key to understand the process of BM innovation by drawing on literature on organiza-\ntional learning.\nCognition and action iterate in processes of organizational learning (Fiol and Lyles, 1985). We\ndraw on the distinction between two basic modes of organizational learning: cognitive search and\nexperiential learning (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000; Levitt and March, 1988). In cognitive search,\naction follows cognition; in experiential learning, cognition follows action (Gavetti and Levinthal,\n2000). We use this organizational learning lens to investigate how BM innovation comes about\nthrough interactions between cognition and action.\nExisting literature on how to generate BM innovation can also be categorized according to these\ntwo modes. Cognitive search refers to a forward-looking process: a cognitive representation is\nused to create and select alternatives according to their consequences. Some studies emphasize the\nprimacy of the cognitive domain in BM innovation (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Furnari, 2015).Aspara\net al.'s (2011) historical study of Nokia, for example, describes how top managers' cognitions of\nchange in the corporate environment informed their search for and decisions about changes to the\ncomposition of Nokia's businesses and their value-creating linkages. Moreover, several normative\nmodels for designing BMs have been presented that emphasize forward-looking analytical pro-\ncesses suggesting that BMs have to be conceived first, then put into action (Chatterjee, 2013;\nExperiential learning instead is backward looking. The basic process of experiential learning is\nthat past experiences get encoded in routinized actions, such that successful actions are retained,\nand failures are abandoned (Levitt and March, 1988). Indeed, others have described BM innova-\ntion as a process that emerges primarily from the domain of action, captured in concepts such as\nand-error learning (Mezger, 2014; Sosna et al., 2010). In experiential learning, the relation between\ncognition and action is reversed: action and its effects are the sources of learning. Thus, both cogni-\ntive search and experiential learning involve action and cognition, but in opposite sequences.\nExperiential learning and cognitive search bring about different dynamics in configurations of\ninterdependent components. A basic assumption is that complex interactions among components\nyield \"rugged\" performance landscapes, in which particular combinations form \"local peaks\"\n(Levinthal, 1997), depending on the extent and type of interactions (Rivkin and Siggelkow, 2007).\nMost research on learning processes in these rugged landscapes focuses on experiential learning\n(Billinger et al., 2014), which is characterized by local search as it responds to outcomes of nearby\nalternatives (Cyert and March, 1963). Especially when complex interactions create local peaks,\nexperiential learning may become trapped in one part of the landscape, even if other areas would\noffer better outcomes (Levinthal, 1997).\nIn contrast, cognitive representations may help make long jumps to distant parts of the land-\nscape (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000). Through cognitive search, actors can play around with more\nelements than would be available to them through experiential learning, such that they come up\nwith different solutions and outcomes. Cognitive search can be enabled by analogical reasoning\nrepresentations are always simplified (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000; Gavetti and Rivkin, 2007).\nEspecially in uncertain conditions, the effectiveness of strategic search and planning is limited by\nunforeseen contingencies and changes, both within the firm and in its external environment\nTo advance theoretical understanding of BM innovation processes, we investigate the contribu-\ntions and interactions of both cognitive search and experiential learning. Both modes of learning\nhave been identified in the BM innovation literature (Martins et al., 2015), and we seek to deter-\nmine how they combine and interact in BM innovation processes. Initial theoretical explorations\noffer a foundation by analyzing the interaction of cognition and action over time (Gavetti and\nLevinthal, 2000; Gavetti and Rivkin, 2007). We specify our research question accordingly: How do\nBM innovation processes in established organizations progress through cognitive search and expe-\nriential learning over time?\nMethods\nOur research aim is best characterized as theory elaboration (Vaughan, 1992) with regard to inno-\nvation in BMs. Theory elaboration means that our study builds on pre-existing models and concep-\ntual ideas and aims to refine concepts, relations, and their explanatory limits (Lee et al., 1999).\nTheory elaboration deploys procedures similar to theory generation (Eisenhardt and Graebner,\n2007; Locke, 2001) and requires a similar open research attitude to avoid premature closure\nTo answer our research question, we adopt a process research approach and investigate how BM\ninnovation is realized through sequences of events (Langley, 1999; Tsoukas and Chia, 2002). We\ndeployed longitudinal studies to depict the evolution of actual processes in their natural environ-\nment. Furthermore, our open and iterative approach to data collection and analysis enables us to\nexplore and refine our conceptualization of process dynamics (Strauss, 1987).\nThe study follows replication logic, investigating multiple independent BM innovation\ntrajectories to seek potential corroboration of the findings (Yin, 2008). We used a purposeful\nsampling strategy to select information-rich cases that can reveal insights into issues of impor-\ntance to the inquiry (Patton, 2002). We focused on BMs rather than firms and used BM innovation\ntrajectories as primary unit of analysis. We selected cases that shared similar features, as that\nallows for meaningful comparison in cross-case analysis and increases the likelihood that simi-\nlarities and differences between cases have theoretical significance (Gerring, 2007). Specifically,\nwe selected cases that met the following criteria: (1) The BM that resulted from the trajectory\nhad to be new to the firm, so that BM innovation was both strongly present and transparently\nobservable (Pettigrew, 1990); (2) The trajectory also had to be relatively new for its sector and\ntherefore a challenging endeavor, with much uncertainty and limited opportunities to imitate\nother firms (Rivkin, 2000); (3) The initiatives had to be undertaken by established firms, which\nhad at least one working BM; (4) The trajectories had to be technology intensive to limit variety\namong the cases (Gerring, 2007); and (5) BM innovation had to be recently realized, and firms\nhad to approve the non-anonymous disclosure of findings to increase the data collection reliability\n(Gibbert, Ruigrok & Wicki 2008). We gained in-depth access to four cases that met these crite-\nria, which we introduce below.\nPhenom was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize a new tabletop scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM), later labeled \"Phenom.\" This trajectory was executed by FEI (established in\n1971; 1700 employees), which was the first organization to introduce such a tabletop SEM. While\nFEI usually focused on increasing performance levels of electron microscopy, the new microscope\ninstead filled the performance gap between optical microscopes and low-end electron microscopes\nthat were on the market at that time. While it started as a product development trajectory, it eventu-\nally required changes in most of the other BM components, including customer relationships,\npartnerships, and cost structures, due to interdependencies between components. The initiative was\nspun off in the end due to the lack of synergy with FEI's main BM.\nExhibits.nl was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize a portfolio of custom-made exhib-\nits as standardized exhibits, sold via the Internet, starting in 2005. This new BM was developed by\nBruns (established in 1963; 70 employees), which mainly focused on creating one-of-a-kind sys-\ntems for museums and exhibitions before. For Bruns, all the components of the new \"Exhibits.nl\"\nBM changed compared to the old BM. The main changes were in the value proposition, new cus-\ntomer segments, and revenue model, triggering related adaptations in the other BM components.\nThis new model was initiated because management wanted to differentiate, to spread risk, and\nreuse exhibit designs that were developed in one-of-a-kind projects. Bruns was first among its\ncompetitors to offer both custom-made and standardized exhibits.\nMiPlaza was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize a bundle of research services of\nties were internally oriented and fenced off from the outside world. With this new initiative, even-\ntually labeled \"MiPlaza,\" Philips opened up its research facilities to others--a major step for a\ntechnology-based firm. Several support departments of Philips' central research and development\n(R&D) organization started offering research services such as analysis, measurement, and proto-\ntyping and consulting services to outside parties such as R&D labs of multinationals and start-ups\nto generate new revenues using Philips' research support infrastructure. In the end, all the BM\ncomponents were changed. Initial adaptations in the value proposition, activities, resources, and\ncustomers triggered changes in interdependent components such as the development of alternative\ncustomer relationships and new partnerships. Philips has been considered as a frontrunner in the\nuse of such open BMs (Chesbrough and Garman, 2009).\nWaste no more was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize high-quality recycled\nmaterials and facilitate closed loops, thereby coupling supply and demand of materials for cus-\ntomers. This new BM was developed by waste management company Van Gansewinkel (estab-\nlished 1964; 5800 employees). BM innovation started with the renewal of activities, resources,\nand revenue streams, which gradually led to necessary changes in other components such as\ncustomer relationships and partnerships. This initiative was regarded as a means to escape com-\nmoditization of the waste management market and generate new revenue streams. The innova-\ntive nature of Van Gansewinkel's approach has been acknowledged in a Nature article (Wise\nSo, these BM innovation trajectories were similar on key dimensions: they resulted in a BM that\nwas new to the firm and relatively new to its sector, which was operated within an established firm\nbesides an existing BM or a portfolio of BMs, with a significant role for technology. Yet, the cases\nalso differed. As a consequence of the selection criterion that the new BM had to be new relative\nto its sector, it was impossible to have cases from the same sector. Moreover, the companies in\nwhich the BM innovation trajectories were embedded had different sizes, with potential differ-\nences in scope of the existing BM portfolio. This variety adds to the robustness of findings\n(Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007), but also opens up the possibility of alternative explanations, to\nwhich we will return in the Discussion section.\nData collection\nOur data collection focused on tracking changes in BM components and their interdependen-\ncies during the new model's first years of development. Interviews were our primary data\nsource, which we triangulated with archival data to enhance validity (Jick, 1979; Yin, 2008).\nWe began by interviewing informants who played a central role in the development of the new\nbusiness, according to suggestions from industry contacts and media coverage of the initiatives.\nThen, we applied snowball sampling to identify additional interviewees, following the sugges-\ntions made in the initial interviews (Patton, 2002). We sought interviewees with multiple back-\ngrounds and perspectives, including managers, employees, and external stakeholders involved\nin the BM innovation trajectory. Interviewing multiple informants mitigated the potential biases\nof any individual respondent because the information could be corroborated by several sources\n(Gibbert et al., 2008). At least three sources of information contributed to each episode that we\nanalyzed. In total, we interviewed 39 respondents, some of them twice (see Table 1). The inter-\nviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim (except for a few interviews at one organization\nwhere some interviewees chose not to allow recording; two interviewers took notes at those\ninterviews, which were transcribed within 24hours). The interviews were conducted in 2011\nThe interviews were semi-structured by a protocol to enhance reliability (Yin, 2008). They typi-\ncally started with a question asking interviewees to explain their personal background, position,\nand history in the organization. Then they recounted the history of the BM innovation trajectory as\nit unfolded over time. During this explanation, we frequently prompted interviewees for further\ndetails. In particular, we ensured that they discussed all developments and changes in the BM com-\nponents, including the value proposition, customer segments, distribution channels, customer rela-\ntionships, revenue streams, activities, resources, partnerships, and cost structures (Osterwalder and\nPigneur, 2010). Some interviewees used the term \"BM\" explicitly to discuss how the business\ninitiative differed from their existing business. In other interviews, we prompted respondents to\nspecify any differences regarding specific components of their pre-existing BM and how and why\nthese differences arose. Our questions aimed to uncover concrete events, factual data, and actual\nbehavior, which help increase reporting accuracy (Huber and Power, 1985). Later interviews were\naided by an emerging timeline, so that interview time could be used effectively to fill gaps in our\nunderstanding and validate earlier accounts.\nWe triangulated these interview data with both internal and external archival data (see Table 1),\nsuch as business plans, presentations, annual reports, company brochures, press releases, media\narticles, and public interviews about the new BM, its host organization, or direct competitors (Jick,\n1979). These sources of data helped specify and verify dates of events and develop a reliable chro-\nnology of the BM innovation trajectory. The same documents also helped us prepare for inter-\nviews, in that they provided background and in-depth insights. Overall, the combination of\ninterview and archival data enabled a rich, reliable understanding of the BM innovation\ntrajectories.\nData analysis\nThe first step in our analysis involved within-case analyses to develop comprehensive case narra-\ntives (Eisenhardt, 1989; Langley, 1999). These case descriptions contained the original BM(s) of\nthe organization and the development of the new BM. Both were described according to the BM\ncomponents identified by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010), whose conceptualization offers an\neffective tool for communicating with practitioners. Moreover, the initial case descriptions\nTable 1.

We sent each case description to key\ninformants at the pertinent organization to check for validity (Gibbert et al., 2008). Their feedback\nresulted in minor revisions to the case narratives.\nAs the second step in the within-case analysis, we analyzed BM innovation trajectories as\nsequences of learning episodes, similar to Bingham and Davis (2012). We identified distinct learn-\ning episodes in the case histories as embedded unit of analysis (Yin, 2008), which formed the basis\nfor further process analyses (Langley, 1999; Poole et al., 2000). Learning episodes involved a\ncoherent set of actions, analyses, reflections, or proposals that resulted in, or were based on,\nincreased understanding. Moreover, episodes had to be significant to the development of the new\nBM, such that they affected the direction and progress of the trajectory. Some unfolded as longer\nterm trends; for these episodes, we dated the moment they first emerged. The resulting sequences,\nwhich included between 9 and 31 episodes each, mapped the evolution of the new BM. We main-\ntained the chain of evidence to ensure construct validity (Yin, 2008); for each episode, we noted\nrelevant data sources, and we coded interview segments pertaining to each episode in qualitative\ndata analysis software.\nIn the third step, we operationalized the two basic types of organizational learning by distin-\nguishing specific learning mechanisms. The identification of mechanisms was based on the itera-\ntive combination of prior literature and our empirical data. Using open, inductive analysis as\ncomplement to previous theory enables \"extending and refining ... existing theoretical categories\nand relationships\" (Locke, 2001: 103). We systematically compared episodes and discussed them\nin the research team (Strauss, 1987) and related these episodes where possible to learning mecha-\nnisms known from literature without restricting ourselves to a predefined set of categories. This\nprocess resulted in a framework of four mechanisms used by the established organizations to\ndevelop and refine new BM configurations. Table 2 contains the coding scheme, including the defi-\nnitions of the mechanisms, empirical indicators for each mechanism, and illustrative quotes. More\nquotes related to the different mechanisms appear in Appendix 1.\nTwo mechanisms are characterized primarily by cognitive search: conceptualization and crea-\ntion. Conceptualization refers to the development of concepts, ideas, and analyses for one or more\nBM components and their interactions, without actually changing or creating any of the compo-\nnents. Conceptualization may occur before any aspect of the BM gets implemented. As such, it has\nbeen described as \"learning-before-doing\" by Pisano (1994). Conceptualization may also concern\nthe reconceptualization of existing operations, as reinterpretation of past and present can be a key\nlearning process (Hernes and Irgens, 2013). Creation refers in this study to the actual realization of\nnew BM components or a new, essential part of components, primarily informed by preceding\nanalyses of components and the interactions among them. While it shares with conceptualization\nthat it is rooted in cognitive search, creation means that ideas are also implemented in reality. As\nsuch, it relates to what Miner and Mezias (1996) call \"generative learning.\" Creation primarily\nrelies on cognitive search through the ideation and analysis of BM components and their relation\nwith other components.\nTwo other mechanisms characterize experiential learning: adaptation and experimentation.\nAdaptation means changing BM components and their interactions according to experiences gath-\nered while the BM was in operation. The adaptation of BM components can be more or less radical,\nin reaction to misfits or (partly) positive outcomes. It covers what others have called trial-and-error\nlearning (Bingham and Davis, 2012; Sosna et al., 2010). Experimentation, or experimental learn-\ning (Bingham and Davis, 2012), entails purposeful actions to learn: planning, designing, and exe-\ncuting relatively controlled situations to develop new knowledge and validate existing forms.\nSimilar to adaptation, experimentation relies on learning from experience, but experimental learn-\ning differs because it only concerns experiences that are intentionally evoked with learning as main\npurpose.\nTable 2.

(Continued)\nThe fourth step in the analysis involved coding all learning episodes with this set of mecha-\nnisms, as well as coding the BM component(s) in each of the four trajectories. Coding the dis-\ntinct episodes required understanding of prior developments in the case history (Pettigrew, 1990)\nand the use of multiple data sources (Pratt, 2009). This holistic understanding was aided by\nintegrating interpretations of multiple researchers. Coding was performed by two members of\nthe research team who had been involved in data collection and at least one additional researcher,\nwho was more distant and could serve as a \"devil's advocate\" and challenge interpretations\n(Nemeth et al., 2001). These analytical steps involved iterations, and the final coding process\nresulted in some refinements to the prior identification of learning episodes in the BM innova-\ntion trajectories.\nAs the final step in the analysis, we compared the four learning trajectories to gain insights into\nhow BM innovation trajectories unfold over time. We first compared the distribution of dominant\nmechanisms in the episodes over the BM innovation trajectories. Next, we compared the four BM\ninnovation trajectories for continuity and change in the learning mechanisms, grouped into the two\noverarching learning modes. This step led to the identification of two main patterns, each of which\nfits two cases. Finally, we explained both patterns according to the specific conditions of the BM\ninnovation trajectories.\nFindings\nLearning trajectories in the BM innovation process\nThe four BM innovation trajectories consisted of multiple episodes (42 in total), characterized by\na multitude of dynamics. Appendix 1 contains for each BM innovation trajectory the key episodes\nin chronological order. These episodes map the evolution of the new BM, and for each episode,\nwe identified which learning mechanism dominated. Although highlighting a single mechanism\nin each episode meant abstracting away from some of the complexities in the case histories, it also\nenabled a better view of the overall trajectory. For each episode, Appendix 1 also indicates the\nBM component(s) addressed in that episode and the interactions between these components as\nchanges unfolded, together with illustrative quotes. Appendix 2 gives for each innovation trajec-\ntory an overview of the original BM that was most related to the new BM at the start of the tra-\njectory, and, at the right-hand side of the table, the final BM components at the end of the BM\ninnovation trajectory. The tables summarize for each learning episode the BM components that\nevolved during that episode. Appendix 2 shows that many BM components evolved several times\nover the innovation trajectory, indicating processual relationships across episodes. Appendix 2\nalso indicates that multiple BM components are touched upon in individual episode due to inter-\nactions between these components. These interactions are further explained for each episode in\nAppendix 1.\nPatterns emerge when we shift attention from episodes to the full trajectories. We find two dis-\ntinct patterns that characterize learning trajectories according to cognitive search and experiential\nlearning: two of the four trajectories--FEI's Phenom and Bruns'Exhibits.nl--initially emphasized\ncognitive search mechanisms (conceptualization and creation), then shifted to experiential learning\nmechanisms (adaptation and experimentation), but the other two cases--Philips' MiPlaza and Van\nGansewinkel's \"Waste no More\"--initially emphasized learning from experiences and only later\nshifted more toward cognitive search.\nPattern 1: from cognitive search to experiential learning\nFEI's Phenom and Bruns' Exhibits.nl trajectories began with emphasis on cognitive search. The\nPhenom trajectory started as a product development activity but turned into a radically different\nBM, which eventually spun off (similar to cases described by Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002).\nAs Appendix 2 shows, all its BM components changed over time. For a long time, the core value\nproposition of FEI had been to offer high-end SEM systems, incorporating the latest developments\nto increase image quality on sub-micron and atomic levels. Customers included leading research\ninstitutes, universities, national laboratories, and industrial companies, which employ dedicated\nmicroscopists for research and development.\nBy 1995, the company had pushed the boundaries of miniaturization and developed an electron\nmicroscopy column about the size of a cigar. After a failed application in the semiconductor indus-\ntry, around 2003\u00ad2004, FEI began to conceptualize an easy-to-use, tabletop SEM. This trajectory\ncontinued with creation processes, as researchers worked to realize breakthroughs deemed neces-\nsary to develop a relatively inexpensive, usable system around the small column. Partial success\nspurred multiple episodes of conceptualization and creation, in which FEI started to develop a\nbusiness plan, analyzed pricing and potential customers, and formulated a tentative value proposi-\ntion, such that the tabletop concept might fill the gap between optical and electron microscopy.\nThese BM components and interactions were designed on the basis of collected information,\nincluding interviews with about 35 potential customers. Early in 2005, FEI articulated a product\nconcept, called Phenom, and a business owner and developer were appointed to manage the devel-\nopment of the concept, as well as its introduction into the market.\nMeanwhile, top managers at FEI also started arguing that a low-cost SEM did not really fit\nFEI's culture. To be manufactured, Phenom would require operations vastly different from FEI's\ntraditional BM of highly customized, low-volume production, shifting to much more cost-efficient,\nmid-volume production. Early in 2005, FEI's business developer contacted a consortium of small\nsuppliers that had joined forces in an effort to become knowledge-intensive system suppliers\n(Table 4, episode 4). The consortium previously had approached FEI seeking actual projects to\nwork on, and Phenom offered a mutually beneficial opportunity. Several consortium members\nagreed to co-invest under a risk\u00adreward model to help develop the tabletop SEM. This unantici-\npated partnership could solve both FEI's financing and culture problems, while the suppliers gained\nan opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities.\nAfter this period of predominantly cognitive search, the Phenom trajectory entered several epi-\nsodes of experimentation and adaptation that moved it further beyond product development into\nBM innovation. In 2006, the team at FEI was ready to test a prototype of the new tabletop SEM as\nwell as the associated value proposition of the BM. In an experimental setup with defined customer\nsegments, FEI approached potential users to test the value proposition of a beta version.\nThe product's market launch triggered several episodes, from which the Phenom team learned\nand engaged in adaptation and experimentation. The Phenom microscope was introduced in\nGermany in October 2006, then in the United States in June 2007. However, it failed to meet sales\ntargets: instead of 2500 systems, only a few hundred systems had shipped by the end of 2008. The\ndevelopment of this new market appeared harder than anticipated because of FEI's inexperience\nselling the system, as well as the emerging global financial crisis. Team members learned that FEI's\ndistribution structure and sales approach, which were leveraged from the traditional business to the\nnew BM, were better suited for selling large, complex microscopes than tabletop microscopes.\nBecause Phenom was not profitable and did not fit the existing FEI sales organization, FEI spun\noff Phenom in a structure in which FEI and the supplier partners remained shareholders. Thus,\noverall, the Phenom case started with conceptualization and creation episodes and turned more\ntoward experimentation and adaptation in the second half of the trajectory.\nBruns' Exhibits.nl trajectory displayed a similar shift from cognitive search to experiential\nlearning. Initially, Bruns developed tailor-made, interactive exhibits for large museums, science\ncenters, visitor centers, and traveling exhibitions, mainly in Western Europe. It worked closely\nwith clients and was paid on a project basis. The new BM trajectory was initiated in 2006, when\nsenior management began looking for ways to increase income predictability, noting the severe\nrisk of large, one-of-a-kind projects. They also wanted to leverage their excess manufacturing\ncapacity in their low season and reuse designs. In early conceptualization and creation episodes in\n2006 and 2007, Bruns conceived a new BM, later named Exhibits.nl. Instead of offering tailor-\nmade, interactive exhibits, Exhibits.nl would provide standardized, economically priced, shock-\nproof exhibits, purchased online, with limited after-sales service. Bruns analyzed the kind of\ncustomers that might value such standardized exhibits (e.g. smaller museums and science centers)\nand which of its existing exhibits might be standardized (with a fee paid to the original client). It\ndeveloped a website and a stand at an annual trade fair as sales channels and then created a partner-\nship with a design agency to enhance redesign capabilities. The BM went into operation in 2007,\nfollowed by several episodes of adaptation to develop it further. For example, in 2007, much of the\ninterest for Bruns' new value proposition originated from emerging economies in the Middle East,\nSouth America, and Asia, according to website data. Therefore, it shifted its attention to these parts\nof the world, enabled by the transactional customer relationships it established through its new,\nweb-enabled BM, which did not require much interaction or after-sales service. Bruns also learned\nthat it did not need the design agency with which it had initiated Exhibits.nl, leading to the dissolu-\ntion of this partnership, but it required intensified marketing efforts. So, whereas cognitive search\ndominated in the early episodes, experiential learning came to the fore in the later episodes.\nPattern 2: from experiential learning to cognitive search\nTwo other trajectories display a different pattern. Philips' MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's \"Waste\nno More\" emphasized experiential learning, rather than cognitive search, in the early phases. Both\nstarted with a reconceptualization of an existing situation, followed by a period dominated by\nexperiential learning. Cognitive search intensified only in the later phases.\nThe MiPlaza trajectory at Philips began with the recognition that selling research support ser-\nvices represented a business opportunity, in an episode of conceptualization. In the early 2000s, as\nopen innovation became a buzzword, Philips opened its research campus and embraced a strategy\nof open innovation. It reinterpreted existing activities, such as incidental provisions of research\nservices to spin-offs and other interconnected companies, as manifestations of an open innovation\nparadigm. Acts initially performed as a favor to old colleagues and friends became viewed as a\nnovel BM, already in operation in an embryonic form. Therefore, Philips officially opened a new\nclean room and related research services for outside companies and research institutes under the\nname MiPlaza in June 2004. Shortly thereafter, Philips' MiPlaza trajectory featured several epi-\nsodes of adapting BM components and their interactions, triggered by the growing business and\nbroadening client base. Specifically, Philips initiated partnerships with equipment manufacturers,\ndeveloped additional resources, and strengthened customer relationships.\nAfter these episodes, its cognitive search intensified and became dominant. In 2006, MiPlaza's\nsenior management realized that the current model was too loosely defined, which led them to\ninitiate a \"One MiPlaza\" change program, based on an analysis of MiPlaza's current situation. On\nthe basis of this analysis, the company conceptualized several changes to BM components and\ndeveloped a change plan. This change plan then triggered three creation episodes in 2008 that\nstrengthened MiPlaza's value proposition and customer relationships, while also developing new\nresources and activities, such as a \"process house\" and ongoing process analysis. The MiPlaza\ntrajectory thus started with reconceptualization of existing activities, followed by several episodes\nof adaptation, and turned to an emphasis on conceptualization and creation in later episodes.\nSimilarly, Van Gansewinkel's \"Waste no More\" trajectory displayed a broad shift from experien-\ntial learning to cognitive search. It also started with reconceptualization. Van Gansewinkel already\nhad a small recycling operation, able to offer raw materials such as glass that was regarded as a by-\nproduct of the company's core service, namely, collecting and processing customer waste. Rising\nraw materials prices led it to review its activities in a new light. Inspired by a high-profile television\ndocumentary \"Waste Equals Food,\" Van Gansewinkel employees came to see their existing opera-\ntions as a materials supplier BM that could compete in the raw materials market. Thus, they appreci-\nated existing raw materials activities and strengthened their importance. The documentary features\nDr. Michael Braungart of the Environmental Protection Encouraging Agency (EPEA), a German\nnon-profit institute, promoting a \"cradle-to-cradle\" philosophy. To accelerate its transformation,\nVan Gansewinkel enthusiasts created a collaboration with EPEA. The subsequent episodes were\nhighly experiential, such that employees experimented with projects and adapted the structure to\ncontrol the projects. In later phases, Van Gansewinkel's \"Waste no More\" trajectory showed several\nepisodes of cognitive search, using conceptualization to strengthen the BM as material supplier and\ncreation to develop resources and systematize activities. Experiential learning thus was stronger in\nthe early episodes, but the use of cognitive search dominated in the later ones.\nComparison of patterns\nIn this section, we explain the contrasting sequences of learning mechanisms in the BM innovation\ntrajectories and label the two types of trajectories as \"leaping\" and \"drifting.\" We characterize the\ntrajectories that started from cognitive search and moved to experiential learning as \"leaping\"\nbecause they only leveraged a limited number of resources from the traditional business and mainly\nstart with the conceptualization and creation of new BM components, thereby distancing from the\nexisting model right from the start, only to shift to experiential learning after going into operation.\nWe characterize the trajectories that relied mainly on experiential learning initially and moved later\nto cognitive search as \"drifting\" because they gradually drift from the original model while being\nin operation and shift to cognitive search to systematize the model when scaling up later in the\nprocess. Below, we first explain the differences in the first parts of the trajectories and then analyze\nthe shift that occurs in both patterns. Table 3 provides an overview of the differences between these\ntwo types of trajectories.\nA key difference between the initiation of the patterns concerns the relationship with the exist-\ning businesses that the organizations had in operation: drifting originates from an existing BM\nconfiguration, whereas leaping mainly starts by developing new interdependent BM components.\nThe two trajectories that we label as drifting\u00adPhilips' MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's \"Waste no\nmore\"\u00adoriginated from ongoing business. Through reconceptualization, they regarded their ongo-\ning business in a new light, shifting attention to alternative value propositions that could sprout\nfrom their existing business activities. When Philips' R&D organization shifted from an internal\nprovider of research services to providing services to external clients, it used most of the BM con-\nfiguration that was already in place (e.g. resources, activities, and relations with external parties),\nalthough some of those components changed substantially later on. Similarly, Van Gansewinkel\nworked with existing clients, customer relationships, channels, activities, and resources to develop\nits new value proposition. In this drifting process, the role of some of these components changed.\nNotably, customers of waste collection services were reframed in the new BM as suppliers of raw\nmaterials. Although Philips' MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's \"Waste no More\" moved far away\nfrom the existing BM over time, they took off from an existing, ongoing BM, thereby starting BM\ninnovation \"on the fly.\"\nIn contrast, the trajectories at Bruns (Exhibits.nl) and FEI (Phenom), which we label as \"leap-\ning,\" mainly started with the offline development of several new BM components, including the\nproducts that the BMs evolved from and the channels to bring the products to new customers. BM\ninnovation in Bruns' Exhibits.nl and FEI's Phenom constituted more de novo developments.\nRelatedly, the patterns show different moments of going into operation: drifting trajectories are\nin operation early and leaping trajectories are in operation relatively late. When BM innovation can\ntake off from ongoing business, a firm can operationalize an integral BM early, as was the case in\nPhilips'MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's \"Waste no More\" trajectories. BM development thus took\nplace in the midst of ongoing operations for clients. In contrast, in FEI's Phenom and Bruns'\nExhibits.nl trajectories, BM components were developed first, which were put into operation later.\nThese cases had to deal with the sequential dependence of the development of BM components:\nThe realization of one component may be necessary before other elements can be realized (S\u00e1nchez\nand Ricart, 2010). For example, for FEI's Phenom, the technology had to be developed first to be\nsure that technological resources could support the imagined value proposition. Then, the founda-\ntions of other components needed to be developed, such as exploring distribution partnerships\nbefore going into operation. For Bruns, developing a partnership with a design agency to realize\nthe look and feel of the business was a prerequisite before it could develop the website for Exhibits.nl.\nThese sequences of developing individual BM components implied a later moment of going into\noperation.\nIt is easy to see how the sequence of learning processes is influenced by the degree to which\nthe new BM develops from existing business and by the moment of going into operation. Taking\noff from existing business allows going in operation early and that enables learning about a\nfunctioning BM from experience. All cases include episodes of adaptation to unexpected problems\nor opportunities, which led to further development of the BMs. The earlier a BM is in operation,\nthe sooner such adaptive learning is possible. The trajectories that started with reconceptualization\nof existing activities for novel BMs thus enabled earlier experiential learning. In contrast, the other\ntrajectories did not originate from ongoing business and went in operation later and therefore relied\nmore on cognitive search initially.\nThe second part of the explanation of the two patterns centers on the opposite shifts in learning\nmode that occurred roughly halfway along the trajectories: from experiential learning to cognitive\nsearch in the drifting pattern and from cognitive search to experiential learning in the leaping pat-\ntern. These shifts have different triggers.\nThe drifting pattern shifts from experiential learning to cognitive search when scaling up the\nBM. In Van Gansewinkel's \"Waste no More\" trajectory, the shift occurred in episode 6. In episodes\n3 and 4, Van Gansewinkel experimented with a new value proposition, and in episode 5, they\nadapted their organizational structure to further develop new activities. After experimental projects\nhad been undertaken, Van Gansewinkel decided to scale up this new BM as exemplary for a new\nidentity. This triggered episodes of cognitive search to systematically advance the BM. In particu-\nlar, episode 8 concerned a systematic analysis of the markets that would be attractive for the firm's\nnew identity as a materials supplier, sharpening the value proposition for customer segments, and\nfurther specification of the revenue model and cost structure to make the new BM financially via-\nble. Episode 9 further crystallized the internal activities and resources required for a full-scale BM.\nSimilarly, after Philips' MiPlaza BM had been in operation for some time, the decision to scale\nup around episode 6 triggered a shift from predominantly experiential learning to predominantly\ncognitive search. This was enabled by the organizational allocation of responsibility for the new\nactivities in episode 5. The decision to scale up the BM created the need to analyze customer needs\nmore rigorously, to determine training demands, design a \"process house\" to formalize internal\nbusiness processes in pursuit of formal certification, and strengthen customer relationships in the\nfollowing episodes.\nTable 3.

Such\nexperiential learning regarding few components occurred against the backdrop of the overall con-\nfiguration, like varying a single parameter in a system while keeping the other parameters stable.\nScaling up required more systematic conceptualizations and analyses, and later cognitive search\nmechanisms dealt with the interaction of more BM components and thus a larger search space.\nThe leaping pattern makes the opposite shift, from cognitive search to experiential learning,\ntriggered by the new BM going into operation, which occurred in episode 6 of Bruns' Exhibits.nl\ntrajectory and at episode 9 of the FEI's Phenom trajectory. Going into operation spurred more\nexperiential learning episodes prompted by misfits among initial BM components that emerged\nduring actual operation. For example, late in its trajectory, FEI recognized that the sales channels\nand customer relationships that were leveraged from the existing business did not fit the novel BM\nfor the Phenom microscope. Bruns (Exhibits.nl) only realized that its partnership with the design\nagency (which owned 50% of the business) was of limited value after its BM had been in full\noperation for several years.\nThe leaping pattern is also different in terms of the number of components and interactions per\nepisode. The early cognitive search episodes in Bruns' Exhibits.nl and FEI's Phenom trajectories\nthat occurred when the BMs were not yet in operation for clients involved multiple BM compo-\nnents, configuring the BM as interacting variables. While a larger number of BM components as\nwell as their interactions are considered initially in the leaping pattern, during actual operation, it\nshifts to the fine-tuning of specific components.\nDiscussion\nOur study responds to recent calls for research to enhance theoretical understanding of the pro-\ncesses of BM innovation in established firms (Arend, 2013; Demil et al., 2015; Massa and Tucci,\n2014). We find a \"drifting\" pattern that originates from an existing BM configuration, goes early\ninto operation, emphasizes experiential learning in early phases, and shifts to cognitive search\nwhen an organization aims to scale up the BM. In contrast, a \"leaping\" pattern is mainly initiated\nby developing new BM components, goes into operation relatively late, focuses initially on cogni-\ntive search, and shifts to experiential learning after the BM goes in operation. Our findings offer\nseveral specific contributions to literature on BM innovation and organizational learning.\nFirst, we advance the BM concept by detailing how its cognition and action dimensions form a\ngenerative duality. This duality can go unnoticed if BMs are in full operation and cognitive repre-\nsentations resemble the manifest operational reality. In the process of BM innovation, though,\ndifferences exist between cognition and action, which make that a BM cannot be reduced to either\nof these dimensions.ABM is more than what an organization does because current actions may not\nyet reflect a BM as conceived, and ongoing activities can be interpreted in multiple ways as dem-\nonstrated by the reconceptualizations that initiated BM innovations at Van Gansewinkel and\nPhilips. Nor can a BM be reduced to a cognitive representation though because interdependencies\namong components may be only partially conceived, and understanding of a model may rely on it\nbeing embedded in practice. Thus, whereas some researchers emphasize BMs as patterns of action\n(e.g. Winter and Szulanski, 2001; Zott andAmit, 2010) and others consider them cognitive artifacts\n(e.g. Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013; Martins et al., 2015), we argue that a BM cannot be\nreduced to either organizational actions or cognitive representations but should be understood as a\nduality. Moreover, the duality of these two dimensions makes BMs inherently dynamic and genera-\ntive. This generative duality reflects the generative dynamics of organizational routines as general\npatterns and specific actions (Feldman and Pentland, 2003). In BM innovation, cognition and\naction interact over time to generate new configurations: Actions get reinterpreted, new ideas are\nimplemented and examined in action, and new patterns of action result in experiences that lead to\naltered conceptualizations of actual and possible business activities. Understanding these dynam-\nics requires attention to both dimensions of BMs' dual nature.\nSecond, we show that BM innovation emerges through combinations of different learning mech-\nanisms\u00adeach involving a different interaction of cognition and action. Prior studies tend to use sin-\ngle process characterizations, focusing on either cognitive search by emphasizing BM design (e.g.\nOsterwalder and Pigneur, 2010) or experiential processes such as experimentation (McGrath, 2010)\nor trial-and-error learning (Sosna et al., 2010). We show that BM innovation processes cannot be\ncaptured with a single mechanism because they involve multiple, contrasting mechanisms in a series\nof episodes. Each learning episode concerns a subset of BM components and the complete configu-\nration of components develops across multiple episodes (see also Cortimiglia et al., 2015).\nIn all trajectories, both cognitive search and experiential learning appeared necessary\u00adalbeit in\ndifferent sequences. Our findings corroborate the assumption in simulation studies that experiential\nlearning typically involves a more limited set of decision parameters than cognitive search, as it is\neasier to manipulate variables in thought than in reality (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000). Experiential\nlearning mechanisms address a few BM components, improving their fit in an integral BM. Cognitive\nsearch mechanisms address more BM components at the same time and are thereby more concerned\nwith the overall configuration of components and their interdependencies. Thus, our findings show\nthe distinct, complementary contributions of cognitive search and experiential learning to deal with\nthe configurational complexity of BMs. This also implies that our findings do not just resemble the\ndistinction between emergent and deliberate strategy formation (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985)\nbecause all trajectories involve emergence and deliberation, albeit in different sequences.\nThird, we identify two process patterns, which we labeled leaping and drifting, with contrasting\nsequences of cognitive search and experiential learning. The leaping pattern moves from cognitive\nsearch to experiential learning. In these trajectories, the BM components and their interdependen-\ncies are considered and created upfront. A shift occurs when the BM goes into operation, after\nwhich experiential learning helps fine-tune any specific components that do not fit within the con-\nfiguration. This sequence corresponds to those who argue that fine-tuning or adaptation may be\nneeded after designed BMs are implemented (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Lehoux et al., 2014).\nThe drifting pattern is an alternative trajectory that is not explicitly considered in current literature.\nThis pattern, in which emphasis shifts from experiential learning to cognitive search, seems typical\nfor established firms because it originates from ongoing business activities. The pattern poses two\npuzzles, though. First, it seems surprising that experiential learning enables substantial divergence\nfrom the initial BM because existing theory suggests that experiential learning cannot escape a local\npeak (Levinthal, 1997) and that \"revolutionary\" approaches are asked for BM innovation (Arend,\n2013: 394). A key lies in the use of reconceptualization to initiate BM change. Reinterpreting a cur-\nrent configuration, inspired by the concept of \"open innovation\" by Philips' MiPlaza and \"cradle-to-\ncradle\"byVanGansewinkel,changestheperformancelandscape.Seeninanewlight,thecontributions\nof the components to BM performance and their interdependencies change, and the existing configu-\nration no longer offers a local optimum. Moreover, both companies had less stringent demands on\nprofitability in this period of experiential learning, thereby also reducing the \"pull\" of a prior local\noptimum. Changes in individual components triggered changes in interdependent components\nthrough experiential learning, prompting a greater drift away from the prior equilibrium. Thus, even\nthough drifting takes off from ongoing business, it allows to deviate radically from it in the end.\nAnother surprising observation is that the drifting trajectories, which emphasize experiential\nlearning in the early episodes, also feature a notable shift to cognitive search later in\ntheir trajectories. This shift toward cognitive search has not been documented by those who have\nemphasized the experiential nature of BM innovation (e.g. McGrath, 2010; Sosna et al., 2010).After\nadaptation and experimentation with core components (e.g. value proposition, customer segments)\nshowed promising results, the organizations aimed to scale up their new BM operations and thus had\nto deal with new interdependencies. Minimal experimentation could tolerate inconsistencies; scal-\ning up required more thorough alignment of all BM components. Thus, the organizational actors\nused cognitive search to align a larger set of BM components systematically and as a coherent\nconfiguration.\nOverall, this pattern resonates with recent studies of organizational change that document that\nincremental changes may culminate into radical change (Girod and Whittington, 2015; Plowman\net al., 2007). Besides revealing a similar phenomenon for BM innovation, we specify that drifting\nfrom an existing BM through subsequent emergent processes may be followed by a more system-\natic analytical approach to consolidate the new BM as a radical departure from the past. These\nfindings suggest that drifting can be used by incumbent firms to overcome barriers for BM innova-\ntion (Chesbrough, 2010) as the initial reconceptualization addresses cognitive constraints upfront\nand the gradual process makes it easier to legitimize the ultimately radical BM change.\nFourth, our study contributes to the literature on synergies between different BMs of one firm.\nPrior literature suggests that when established firms add new BMs and operate multiple BMs simul-\ntaneously, they are more successful if the models are connected (Casadesus-Masanell and Tarzijan,\nreuse of components in both patterns. Synergies occurred most immediately in the drifting pattern,\nwhere linkages between old and new resulted from reconceptualizations of a significant part of the\nexisting business as a new BM, such that familiar components gained new meaning.\nLiterature mostly assumes that the synergies become enacted whenever a certain component of\none BM can be directly reused in the other BM that the firm employs, for example, when certain\nresources can be shared (e.g. Markides and Charitou, 2004). However, in two cases, we observed\nan indirect reuse, when a certain component of the old BM (i.e. customer segment) became a dif-\nferent component in the new BM (i.e. partners). Moreover, we observed that adaptation frequently\noccurred when direct reuse of a BM component resulted in misfits instead of synergy. Adaptation\nof BM components helped to resolve such conflicts between the old and the new BM. We observed\nthat the drifting pattern allowed firms to identify such lack of synergy earlier in the process.\nAlthough it might be argued that a broader BM portfolio, like Philips had, increases options for\nreuse and synergy, this did not appear decisive for the nature of BM innovation trajectories, as we\nfind a similar \"drifting\" pattern in one of the other firms with only one main BM (i.e. Van\nGansewinkel). This indicates that the number of BMs in a portfolio does not explain much of our\nfindings. More broadly, size does not appear to differentiate between the two patterns. The two\ncompanies that are smaller in size in terms of employees, FEI and Bruns, displayed the leaping\npattern, whereas the bigger firms displayed the drifting pattern. However, this association is likely\nto be accidental and not causal because existing theory suggests that if size would have an effect,\nit would point in the opposite direction: prior research found that smaller firms tend to use more\nemergent and less planned approaches than large firms (e.g. Berends et al., 2014), whereas in the\npresent study, the two bigger firms started in a more emergent way.\nBoundary conditions, limitations, and further research\nSeveral boundary conditions and limitations of our study deserve to be mentioned and addressed\nin future research. We investigated four cases that were similar in several ways, which invites\nadditional studies of BM innovation trajectories in other settings. In particular, our findings refer\nto BM innovations that were new for their sectors, which imply extensive learning in these trajec-\ntories. The process of BM innovation may differ when a BM follows a recipe or existing exemplar\n(Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010). Learning trajectories may be less complex in such situations,\nand followers'approaches may involve more learning from external sources, whereas the cases we\nstudied drew primarily on their own analyses and experiences. Our findings also pertain to cases in\nwhich new BMs complement existing BMs instead of substituting for them. The dynamics may\ndiffer when a new BM needs to replace an old one (Kim and Min, 2015) because the competition\nfor attention and resources may strengthen the role of inertia.\nThe organizations that executed the BM innovation trajectories were regarded mostly as a whole,\nignoring any intra-organizational social dynamics and micro-institutional effects. Any innovation\neffort that deviates from an organization's existing businesses likely faces internal resistance, dealing\nwith which requires leadership (Chesbrough, 2007) and political maneuvering (Van Dijk et al., 2011).\nWhile drifting may potentially help alleviate some of the resistance, additional research is needed to\ninvestigate how intra-organizational dynamics shape BM learning processes. Finally, we did not\ninclude performance as a variable in our analysis. We only selected BM innovations that came to frui-\ntion, without differentiating their ultimate contributions to firm performance. To extend this study,\nresearchers should investigate the performance consequences of different learning trajectories.\nConclusion\nBM innovation is a complex process in which action and cognition intertwine. It is not a two-step\nprocess of conception and execution, in which a BM is developed first as a cognitive representation\nand then implemented in reality later. Instead, it is a multi-step, multi-mechanism learning process\nthat can occur through \"drifting\" and \"leaping\" patterns. In addition to considering which BM will\nbe most effective, organizations therefore should consider how they can arrange an effective learn-\ning process to reach a novel BM.\n"
