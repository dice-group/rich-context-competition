Its validity deter-\nmines the usefulness of death certificate data for exploring\nthe association between socioeconomic position and\nmortality [1]. Although education is likely to be more\naccurately reported than measures such as income, some\nevidence from Western studies suggests inconsistencies\ncan occur between education reported in health surveys\nand that subsequently recorded on death certificates [2-4].\nIn a study by Lerchen and colleagues, a considerable gap\nwas found between education reported in health inter-\nview data and education reported in subsequent follow-\nup interviews from surviving spouses after death [5]. Con-\ntradictory results have also been shown in other studies,\nwith some demonstrating a tendency for education to be\nreported at a higher level on death certificates than at\nbaseline health survey, [2,3] while other studies showed\nthis was not true [1].\nIn addition, the reliability of reported education between\ninterview survey and death certificate data may vary with\ndecedent's gender, age, and educational level [3]. Educa-\ntion can be reported less accurately for female decedents\nsince they are less likely than males to have surviving\nspouses and are more likely to die at an older age [3]. The\noverstatement of education was more common among\nthose decedents who, according to health survey data, had\na lower education level [3]. However, in a later study,\nRosamond and colleagues reported that death certificate\neducation level had substantial validity and that misclas-\nsification was similar in both genders [1]. Reports have\nshown that overstatement bias was more pronounced in\nolder than younger decedents [2]. Apart from these stud-\nies, little has been published on the validity and reliability\nof education between health survey data and death certif-\nicate data.\nEducation is known as a socioeconomic position indica-\ntor that is less likely to change over time than occupation\nand income [4]. As a result, misclassification of education\nmay not vary with the length of time between acquisition\nof health survey and death certificate data. However, no\nstudies have proven this. In addition, little is known about\nthe misclassification of education by cause of death.\nRecently, several studies have been conducted to examine\neducational inequalities in mortality with use of census\nand death certificate data in South Korea [6-8]. For exam-\nple, in prior studies we presented age-, gender-, and cause-\nspecific mortality inequalities by education [6] and exam-\nined trends in mortality inequalities by education [7].\nHowever, the possibility of numerator-denominator bias\n[9] could not be excluded in these studies since unlinked\ndata were used [6,7]. If education levels of the census were\nmore inflated than those of death certificate data, exagger-\nated educational mortality differentials could be made.\nSon claimed that the reliability of education level between\nsurvey and death certificate data can be poor [10]. A prior\nKorean study examined the reliability of reported educa-\ntion level between survey and death certificate data [11].\nHowever, due to the small number of deaths, a more\ndetailed analysis by covariates such as cause of death and\nduration between health survey and death was not possi-\nble and the validity (sensitivity and specificity) of each\neducational category was not examined. Information on\ngender, age, and cause-specific level of validity is useful to\nassess any bias in the gender, age, and cause-specific mag-\nnitude of socioeconomic mortality inequalities measured\nwith census and death certificated data. Therefore, the\npurpose of this study was to compare education level\nrecorded on death certificates with that reported before\ndeath in a nationally representative cohort of participants\nin the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) of South Korea. Specifically, we examined the\ndifference in the magnitude of validity and reliability for\neducational attainment according to gender, age group,\nduration between health survey and death, educational\ncategory, and cause of death.\nMethods\nThe Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical\nCenter, Seoul, approved this study. The health survey data\nducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs.\nInformation was collected from a stratified multistage\nprobability sample of South Korean households repre-\nsenting the civilian, non-institutionalized population\ninformation on education level was obtained from an\nadult household member. For each family member, the\nhighest education completed was reported. This data con-\ntained unique 13-digit personal identification numbers\nthat were individually linked to mortality data from the\nKorean National Statistical Office. By law, all Korean\ndeaths must be reported to the Korea National Statistical\nOffice. We identified deaths that occurred in the years\nity follow-up was 7.1 years. Similar to that in NHANES,\nlevels of education reported on death certificates were\ndetermined by the highest level of education completed.\nThe information on education was based on reports from\nthe decedent's kin.\nCovariates considered in our analyses were gender, age,\nduration between survey and death, and cause of death.\nDuration between health survey and death was grouped\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nallocate samples equally into groups. Causes of death\nwere coded according to the 10th revision of the Interna-\ntional Classification of Disease (ICD-10) and grouped as\nFor our analysis, we first compared education level\nbetween NHANES data and death certificate data and cal-\nculated the proportion of concordant and discordant\npairs. Then we determined sensitivity and specificity of\neducation in death certificate using the standard method,\n[13] with education reported in NHANES considered the\ngold standard. Sensitivity and specificity by cause of death\nwere not presented due to the small size of each education\ngroup. We also estimated the agreement rates of education\nlevel between NHANES data and death certificate data.\nOverstatement and understatement rates were calculated.\nOverstatement refers to the inflated education level\nrecorded in death certificates compared with that in\nNHANES, while understatement means the reverse. Con-\nfidence intervals (CI) for sensitivity, specificity, agreement\nrates, overstatement rates and understatement rates were\ncalculated by asymptotic method. For these analyses, edu-\ncation data from death certificates and NHANES were cat-\negorized into five levels (college or higher, high school,\nmiddle school, elementary school and no education) and\nthree levels (college or higher, high and middle school,\nelementary school or less). This was consistent with cate-\ngorizations used in prior two studies [6,7]. Finally, after\nadjusting for all covariates, we estimated odds ratios with\n95% CI for agreement in educational attainment when\nfive and three educational groups were used. All statistical\nanalyses were performed with SAS statistical software.\nResults\nUnique personal identification numbers of 12,801 sub-\nthe 2001 NHANES) were linked to mortality information.\nboth the death certificate and NHANES. One decedent\nhad no education information in the NHANES and\nanother decedent's education was not recorded in the\ndeath certificate. Of the 511 participants included in our\nwere aged 65+. The mean age of subjects was 66.4 years\nyears (SD 16.3) for those with college education or higher\nto 75.8 years (SD 9.2) for those with no education. A\nmarked gender difference in education was also found\nno education recorded in the NHANES. While the propor-\ntion of those having college or higher education only\nreached 2.3% (n = 5) for women, the proportion for men\nTable 1 shows the cross-classification of education level\nby death certificate and the adult household member's\nreport at baseline visit in the NHANES of South Korea. For\nInconsistencies were most common when education was\nreported as middle school in NHANES. Of 54 participants\nwhose education was reported as middle school in\nNHANES, only 25 (46.3%) were recorded as having mid-\ndle school education in death certificate data.\nTable 2 presents the sensitivity and specificity of educa-\ntion in death certificate when education level derived\nfrom the health survey was considered as the gold stand-\nTable 1: Comparison of education level between Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and death\ncertificate data among 513 decedents\nEducation recorded\non death certificate\nCollege or higher High school Middle school Elementary school No education Unknown Total\nNote: The denominator for the calculation is the number of deaths classified by level of education noted on the NHANES survey, so that the\ncolumn percentages add to 100%.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nard. The sensitivity and specificity of the death certificate\nin classifying a decedent as having college or higher edu-\ncation, the sensitivity was poor. While the level of sensitiv-\nity for high and middle school was greater in men than\nwomen, this pattern could not be generalized to other\neducational groups. A very low sensitivity (0.20) for mid-\ndle school in women was based on the small sample\nnumber (n = 5). With the exception of high school, the\nsensitivity of education for ages 65+ was similar to that for\nages 20\u00ad64. In addition, the magnitude of sensitivity and\nspecificity did not vary with the length of time between\nacquisition of health survey and death certificate data.\nTable 3 shows the overall agreement rate, overstatement\nrate and understatement rates with 95% CI. When educa-\ntion level was categorized into five groups (college or\nhigher, high school, middle school, elementary school,\nand no education), the overall agreement rate was 70.7%\nrate for education did not vary with gender, age, and dura-\ntion between health survey and death. This was generally\ntrue for cause specific analyses. The overstatement rate\ntended to be greater than the understatement rate. The\neducation level of 87 (17.0%) subjects was reported as\ngreater in death certificate than NHANES data while 63\n(12.3%) subjects were recorded with lower education in\ndeath certificate data than in NHANES data. This was true\nTable 2: Sensitivity, specificity and their 95% confidence intervals (CI)* of education level recorded in death certificates using\neducation reported in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of South Korea as the gold standard (N = 511)\nEducation N Sensitivity (95% CI) N Specificity (95% CI) N Sensitivity (95% CI) N Specificity (95% CI)\nAll subjects\nMen Women\nDuration between health survey and death, 3.4 years or\nless\nDuration between health survey and death, 3.5\u00ad7.1 years\n*Confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity were calculated by asymptotic method.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfor both gender, age and causes of death except for exter-\nnal causes. Meanwhile, the understatement rate for exter-\nnal causes tended to be greater than the rates for other\nthree broad causes. When educational level was grouped\ninto five categories, understatement rate for external\ncauses was 20% while understatement rates for other\nbroad causes were about 10%. Based on logistic analysis\nwhen the educational level was grouped into three catego-\nries, odds ratio of understatement for external causes (ref-\nAs presented in Table 3, the magnitude of reliability\nincreased as the number of educational groups decreased.\nWhen the education level was categorized into three\ngroups (college or higher, high and middle school, ele-\nmentary school or less), the overall agreement rates was\neducation, overstatement and understatement rates\ndiminished and there was no marked evidence of educa-\ntion inflation in death certificate data compared with\nhealth survey.\nTable 4 presents odds ratio (95% CI) of agreement when\nfive and three educational groups were used to assess\nagreement. When five educational groups were used, the\nmiddle and elementary school education groups showed\na significantly smaller likelihood of agreement after\nadjusting for gender, age (10-year age), duration between\nhealth survey and death, and cause of death. However,\nthis was not true when assessing agreement with three\neducational groups. No significant difference in odds ratio\nwas found for gender, age, duration between health sur-\nvey and deaths, and cause of death, likely in part due to\nsmall sample size.\nDiscussion\nResults of this study showed that the proportion of deaths\nwithout recorded education was very low, only one of 513\nTable 3: Agreement rate (%), overstatement* rate (%), understatement* rate (%), and their 95% confidence intervals (CI)* for\neducation level by gender, age, and cause of death: Reliability between Korea National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data\nand death certificate data\nNo. of subjects Agreement rate (95% CI) Overstatement rate (95% CI) Understatement rate (95% CI)\nFive educational groups (college or higher, high school, middle school, elementary school, no education)\nGender\nAge groups\nDuration between health survey and death\nCause of death\nThree educational groups (college or higher, high and middle school, elementary school or less)\nGender\nAge groups\nDuration between health survey and death\nCause of death\n*Overstatement refers to the inflated educational level recorded in death certificate compared with that in NHANES, while understatement means\nthe reverse.

According to death certificate data covering\nall South Koreans, the rate of failure to report the\ndecedent's educational attainment was 0.3% for men and\nKorean death certification system where any vague or\nmissing item on the death certificate is further clarified by\nthe Korea National Statistical Office via telephone [6].\nThis low percentage of missing education information in\nSouth Korean death certificate data could provide a great\npotential to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in mor-\ntality.\nDirect comparison of the validity and reliability level\nfound in this study with prior reports in other countries\nmay be problematic because of differences in age distribu-\ntion and educational categories used. Factors associated\nwith participation to health survey may also affect the\noverall validity and reliability. Nevertheless, we may con-\nclude that this study showed a similar or higher level of\nvalidity and reliability in education information than in\nWestern studies. For example, the agreement rate for three\neducational groups (less than high school graduate, high\nschool graduate, and greater than high school education)\nin a prior study was 84% [1]. Results of this study showed\nan agreement rate of 88.9% for the same categories. A\nprior study presented a sensitivity of 0.85 for college or\nhigher education, [2] which is similar to what was found\nin this study (0.84). It should be noted that in prior stud-\nies, a substantial number of subjects with missing educa-\ntion information (15%\u00ad27%) were found but were\neliminated from analyses that reported the agreement rate\nand sensitivity [1,2].\nDespite the relatively high level for overall validity and\nreliability, low sensitivity and agreement rates were found\nin this study for participants with middle school educa-\ntion. After adjusting for covariates, middle and elementary\nschool education groups were less concordantly recorded\nin death certificate data. One possible explanation for this\nmay be related to historical changes in the education sys-\ntem in South Korea. During Japanese colonial occupation\nKorea could not establish a nationwide educational cur-\nriculum [14]. An education system divided by elementary\nschool (6 years), middle school (3 years), and high school\n(3 years) began in 1954 when the Ministry of Education\nof Korea first introduced an official nationwide curricu-\nlum. Various types of educational attainment, which are\ndifficult to group into the categories used in this study,\nwould be inevitable among decedents whose childhood\nand adolescent education was achieved before the mod-\nern South Korean educational system was established.\nDifficulties in determining one's educational level have\nalso remained in vital statistic records. For example, mid-\ndle and high school levels were grouped as one category\nin early 1990s death certificate data [7]. However, when\nmiddle school and elementary school education were col-\nTable 4: Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of agreement in education level (N = 511)\nOR (95% CI) of agreement for\nfive educational groups\nOR (95% CI) of agreement\nfor three educational groups\nGender\nAge groups\nDuration between health survey and deaths\nEducation in health survey\nCause of death\nNote: all variables were entered into logistic models simultaneously.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nlapsed into high school and no education respectively,\nstatistically significant differences in agreement of educa-\ntion did not appear.\nIt was hypothesized that male decedents' education\nwould be more accurately reported by surviving female\nspouses than female decedents' due to the gender gap in\nlife expectancy [3]. However, this study showed that the\nagreement rate of education for women was generally\ngreater than that for men. Statistically significant gender\ndifferences in odds of agreement were found for both edu-\ncational categories (five and three groups) when only the\ngender variable was entered into logistic model (data not\nshown). In South Korea a woman's death is more fre-\nquently reported by her children, who may know more\nabout her education than other informants. The widow's\ncognitive or communication problems may lower the\nagreement rate of male decedents' education. However,\nthe comparison of accuracy level between widow's report-\ning (for male decedents' education) and children's report-\ning (for female decedents' education) needs to be further\nexplored. If a woman's informants were uncertain as to\nwhich education levels she achieved, it might be difficult\nto accurately deduce and report the actual education level.\nHowever, in this study reports of women's education in\nthe NHANES were concentrated around the \"no educa-\ntion\" level (67.9%). The simplicity of a woman's educa-\ntion might help informants for death certification to\nreport education information accurately. Based on logistic\nmodel, significantly greater odds ratios of agreement for\nwomen compared with men became insignificant after\nadjusting for education (data not shown).\nAlthough the magnitude of overall agreement rate for\neducation did not vary with causes of death, understate-\nment rate for external causes tended to be greater than the\nrates for other broad causes. Higher understatement rate\nfor external causes was mainly due to stigmatized causes\nof death rather than other external causes such as trans-\nport accident. Understatement rate for suicide (n = 17)\nwas 35.3% (n = 6) while the rate for transport accident (n\n= 24) was 8.3% (n = 2). Logistic analysis presented a\ngreater odds ratio of understatement for suicide (data not\nshown). This suggests that a considerable understatement\nfor education may occur in stigmatized causes of death.\nOverstatement and understatement of education by\ndescendants may vary with regions with different cultural\nbackground. Results of this study showed a tendency for\ninflation of education when grouped into five categories\nbut did not reveal any evidence of inflation when educa-\ntion was collapsed into three categories. These findings\nagree with prior US studies where inflation was found in\nsix educational groups [3] but did not appear in collapsed\neducational groups [1]. Thus, when using unlinked data a\nmore collapsed categorization of education would pro-\nduce a more valid result on estimating mortality inequal-\nity. However, as the sensitivity of college or higher\neducation was generally greater than that of no education\nand the pattern did not vary with covariates, it can be sug-\ngested that educational mortality differentials between no\neducation and college or higher education in the previous\nstudy [6] were underestimated. Indeed, several longitudi-\nnal mortality follow-up studies presented a substantial\ndifference in mortality by education in South Korea\n[15,16]. Given that the level of agreement did not signifi-\ncantly vary with cause of death, cause-specific analysis\nmay not result in biased results. However, a more col-\nlapsed categorization in education would be recom-\nmended especially when a more definitive conclusion\nregarding educational mortality inequality is required.\nConclusion\nThe low percentage of missing education information in\nSouth Korean death certificate data could provide a great\npotential to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in mor-\ntality. Despite the relatively high level for overall validity\nand reliability, a more collapsed categorization of educa-\ntion would produce a more valid result on estimating\nmortality inequality when using unlinked data.\nList of abbreviations\nCI, confidence intervals; NHANES, National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey of South Korea; SD, stand-\nard deviation.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nYHK conceived and designed the study with advice from\nHRK and JWL.
