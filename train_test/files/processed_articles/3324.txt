    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study is a report on modifications and pilot testing of a measurement tool to predict Pap testing based on the Interaction\nModel of Client Health Behavior. Women have been found to avoid routine cervical cancer screening (CCS) due to personal\ninfluencing factors. For this study, the Pap Smear Belief Questionnaire (PSBQ) was modified by adding items and evaluated\nthrough content validity index (CVI = .89) and cognitive interviews (think-aloud protocol), resulting in a 31-item instrument\nwith four subscales (Benefits, Barriers, Vulnerability, Experiences). Pilot testing the modified PSBQ was conducted at a local\nagency. Fifty-three women completed and returned the PSBQ, which had good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha\ncoefficient of .81 (Benefits  = .51; Barriers  = .85; Vulnerability  = .78; Experiences  = .87). Test\u00adretest reliability of the\n31-item PSBQ was also good (.878). Univariate logistic regression indicated that the only significant predictor of seeking/\navoiding routine screening by women's background characteristics was social influence (p = .04). Subscales found to be\nsignificant predictors in Pap testing were Barriers (p = .003) and Gynecological Exam Experiences (p = .04). The refined 31-\nitem PSBQ has good psychometric data supporting its use in predicting CCS. However, this research should be replicated in\na larger sample enabling further validity and reliability testing of the PSBQ. Understanding women's attitudes toward CCS will\nhelp health care providers, who deal with gynecological health, develop more effective screening programs and interventions\nfacilitating better experiences for women contributing to an increase in routine screening.\n",

This is particularly troubling because cervical\ncancer is preventable with routine Pap tests (American\nCancer Society [ACS], 2013). In general, most women are\naware of the Pap test and of the benefits of routine cervical\ncancer screening (CCS; Hawkins, Cooper, Saraiya, Gelb, &\nPolonec, 2011). Yet, many women fail to obtain screening.\nAmong those with advanced stage cervical cancer, most had\neither never been screened or failed to obtain routine screen-\ning (ACS, 2013). Understanding the barriers to routine\nscreening is essential to improved rates of adherence to CCS.\nFrequently cited barriers associated with women not get-\nting routine screening are being uninsured, poor, and having\nless education (Bazargan, Bazargan, Farooq, & Baker, 2004;\nBehbakht, Lynch, Teal, Degeest, & Massad, 2004). To the\nextent that these resource-related factors (e.g., income,\ninsurance coverage) predict avoidance or lack of CCS, it\nbecomes obvious we must increase access to services and\navailability of screening to improve routine screening.\nFurthermore, however, it is important that we gain a better\nunderstanding of the factors that contribute to avoidance of\nCCS in women who have access to health care but avoid\nscreening despite these resources. In previous qualitative\nresearch on attitudes toward CCS (Ackerson, 2010;\nAckerson, Pohl, & Low, 2008), some participants chose not\nto get a Pap test even though they had available resources\n(i.e., access to care, insurance coverage). In these small\nqualitative studies, personal barriers (including negative\nemotions) emerged as the most powerful factor related to\navoidance of routine screening. We propose that these other\nbarriers, particularly those relating to personal history, will\npredict avoidance behavior in this sample of women with\naccess to health care. A better understanding of these spe-\ncific barriers contributing to avoidance in this population is\n1Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, USA\n2Cleveland State University, OH, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKelly Ackerson, Associate Professor, Bronson School of Nursing,\nWestern Michigan University, 1903 West Michigan Avenue, Kalamazoo,\nEmail: kelly.ackerson@wmich.edu\nModifying and Pilot Testing the Pap\nSmear Belief Questionnaire\nKelly Ackerson1, Lisa Stines Doane2, Robert McNutt1,\nand Yuanyuan Shao1\n Keywords\nnursing, behavioral sciences, psychology, social sciences, disparities, education, measurement and scaling methods, research\nmethods, reliability and validity\n2 SAGE Open\nessential, so that relevant intervention models can be devel-\noped to address the core barriers, above and beyond the\nobvious need to increase access to services for a broad range\nof women. To this end, it is necessary to have a measure of\nthe social and emotional barriers to CCS that may be modi-\nfiable in intervention approaches.\nThe Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior\n(IMCHB; Cox, 1982) is a useful guiding framework to\nexplore the factors that influence women to obtain (or avoid)\nCCS, particularly among those who otherwise have access\nto health care in general (Ackerson, 2012; Ackerson et al.,\n2008). The IMCHB assumes that each client is a unique and\nactive dynamic agent who has both the desire and the ability\nto make informed decisions regarding their health care\n(Cox, 1982). The model assumes that the decisional process\nrelative to health behavior for each individual is driven by\nthe interaction of the element of client singularity (unique\nclient characteristics) and client\u00adprovider interaction (inter-\nvention) to produce the client health outcome or behavior\n(seeking or avoiding routine CCS). This model is a flexible\nmodel, where the researcher can select all or portions of the\nmodel based on the purpose of the study.Abel and Chambers\n(2004) used two elements of the IMCHB (client singularity\nand health outcome) to guide their study, which addressed\nsexual health among Hispanic women. Whereas Wagner,\nBear, and Davidson (2011) applied all three elements of the\nmodel (client singularity, client\u00adprovider interaction, and\nclient health outcome) exploring postpartum women's satis-\nfaction with the educational intervention they received.\nHowever, outside of the principal investigator's (PI's) stud-\nies, no other published studies have used the IMCHB to\naddress CCS.\nOf interest for this study are the elements of client singu-\nlarity and health outcome. The first element includes back-\nground characteristics such as demographic variables (age,\nrace/ethnicity, history of last Pap test), social influences that\nmay promote or discourage health preventive behavior\n(mother, family members, health care provider, media, oth-\ners), previous health care experiences (gynecological\nexam--Pap test and pelvic), and environmental resources\n(income, education, insurance availability). The client sin-\ngularity element also includes a range of dynamic variables,\nsuch as cognitive appraisal (beliefs about the benefits and\nbarriers to CCS, perceptions of vulnerability to cervical can-\ncer), affective response (emotional reactions to an event\nsuch as previous screening/health care interactions), and\nmotivation (a process that causes action and involves social,\nemotional response and cognitive forces). In addition, we\nincluded a history of interpersonal trauma (IPT; sexual and/\nor physical abuse), which has emerged in our qualitative\nresearch as a strong potential predictor of CCS behavior\nincluded in client singularity are believed to interact to pro-\nduce a specific health behavior (i.e., seeking or avoiding\nPap tests).\nTherefore, understanding how personal influencing fac-\ntors contribute to screening behavior will help health care\nproviders develop more effective interventions. The aim of\nthis study was to modify and pilot test the Pap Smear Belief\nQuestionnaire (PSBQ), determine its psychometric proper-\nties and its predictive validity related to Pap test avoidance.\nMethod\nParticipants\nStudy participants were female employees of a not-for-profit\ncontinuum of care facility located in Michigan, employed in\na wide range of positions (e.g., administrative, nursing, nurs-\ning assistants, housekeeping, clerical, kitchen services,\nmaintenance, environmental, and entry level). This facility\nwas selected because they employ a large number of people,\nmost of them are women, with diversity in education and\nincome.\nProcedures\nPrior to conducting this study (instrument modification and\npilot testing the PSBQ), approval was obtained from the PI's\nuniversity institutional review board. Women below age 21,\nolder than 70, and those who had a hysterectomy were ineli-\ngible to participate because they fall outside of recommended\nscreening guidelines (American College of Obstetricians and\nInstrument\nData collected included a series of demographic questions\nand background characteristic questionnaire and the PSBQ.\nBackground characteristics were addressed with 11 ques-\ntions related to an individual's demographics, environmental\nresources, social influences related to Pap testing, personal\nhistory of CCS behavior, and history of IPT. Although CCS\nguidelines have been modified in recent years, at the time the\ncurrent study was conducted (March 2011), recommended\nguidelines for routine Pap testing were every 2 years for\nwomen between ages 21 and 29, and every 3 years for women\nbetween ages 30 and 65/70 for those with three previous nor-\nmal tests (ACOG, 2009), and thus these criteria were used to\ndetermine whether a woman was adherent to CCS.\nSteps in Instrument Refinement\nThe PSBQ was developed and tested in a previous study\nusing nursing students and included 17 items with three\nsubscales--Benefits, Barriers, and Vulnerability\n(Ackerson, Zielinski, & Patel, 2014). Internal consistency\nBarriers .86, and Vulnerability .81). In the present study,\nbased on the PI's previous qualitative research (Ackerson,\nAckerson et al. 3\nwere added to the PSBQ: 2 items addressing the benefits of\nscreening, 3 items addressing vulnerability, and a new sub-\nscale addressing the gynecological exam experience\nThe newly developed experience subscale, which con-\nsisted of six items, was distributed to five professional\nexperts in women's health and IPT. Only three of the five\nresponded, a sufficient number to conduct a content validity\nindex (CVI; Polit & Beck, 2010). The experts were instructed\nto consider each of the experience subscale items and to\nselect only one of four different responses (1 = not relevant;\n2 = somewhat relevant; 3 = quite relevant; and 4 = very rel-\nevant), which, in their opinion, best represents their own\njudgment regarding each of the respective items. In addition,\nthey were encouraged to respond to an open-ended question:\n\"Are there content areas relevant to women's experiences\nwith the Pap smear and pelvic exam that is missing?\" Two of\nthe experts fully agreed on five of the items being very rele-\nvant. One expert agreed that two items were very relevant,\nthree items were quite relevant, and one item was not rele-\nvant. The one item deemed somewhat relevant by one expert\nand not relevant by another was \"I only want to see female\nproviders.\" A comment was made that there could be many\nreasons beyond the pelvic exam as to why someone would\nprefer a female provider. From the open-ended questions,\none expert recommended three additional questions. These\nquestions were as follows: (a) \"I do not trust health care pro-\nviders\"; (b) I feel like I am being violated when the provider\ndoes not explain to me what they are doing during the female\nexam\"; and (c) \"When the provider rushes through the female\nexam it makes me feel on edge.\" These questions were con-\nsidered and believed to more accurately describe women's\nconcerns and were subsequently added to the subscale. The\nitem \"I only want to see female providers\" was not deleted\nfrom the scale, since through prior qualitative research\n(Ackerson, 2012), provider's gender was a very important\nissue among participants and deemed important. The sub-\nscale's CVI was calculated to be .89, which is considered\nsufficient (Polit & Beck, 2010). Finally, a sample of women\nbetween ages 21 and 70 who self-reported a history of IPT\nwas recruited from a local agency to participate in cognitive\ninterviews.\nCognitive interviews (think-aloud protocol; Pett, Lackey,\nmethod used to collect data about cognitive processes, such\nas thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. For this\nportion of the project, women who self-identified as having a\nhistory of IPT were considered experts to evaluate the ques-\ntionnaire and acceptability of the experience items.\nVerbal and written instructions were provided to the\nwomen by the PI on how to \"think aloud.\" The think-aloud\nprotocol (Willis, 1999) was conducted through verbal report-\ning of the participant's thought processes during the task of\nresponding to the items on the questionnaire.\nTen individual interviews were completed. Among these 10\ninterviews, no refinements, modifications, or new questions\nwere suggested. Based on the cognitive interviews, no cogni-\ntive problems were identified, indicating that the women\nunderstood and accurately interpreted the experience questions\nand the remainder of the questions in the instrument. Only one\nchange was made to an item on the Benefits scale after one\nparticipant suggested that \"People doing Pap smears are rude to\nwomen\" should be revised to simply read \"People doing Pap\nsmears are rude,\" as men cannot receive a Pap test.\nThe final version of the PSBQ has 31 items in four sub-\nscales that address the elements of client singularity (previous\nhealthcareexperience,cognitiveappraisal,affectiveresponse):\nBenefits (7 items: early detection, treatment effectiveness,\npeace of mind), Barriers (9 items: fear of finding something\nwrong and being afraid of not understanding what will be\ndone, embarrassment, knowledge of where to access, time\nconstraints, remembering to schedule, more important life\nissues, and too old to need a Pap), Vulnerability (2 items: risk\n[personal and family], taking care of health by exercising and\neating right, and using protection with sex), and Experience (9\nitems: Pap and pelvic exam, provider approach and gender\npreference, unwanted memories and feelings). Items are\nanswered on a Likert-type scale from 1 = strongly disagree to\n5 = strongly agree, with potential scores for the entire scale\nThe scale has positively and negatively worded items.\nData Collection\nTo conduct an ethical, non-coercive sampling, all employees\n(female and male) of the health care agency received the\nPSBQ in their mailbox. Male employees were instructed to\neither return the questionnaire indicating their gender, or dis-\ncard. The female employees who chose to participate were\nasked to select a six-digit code to put on each questionnaire\nto connect their responses from Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2).\nThe initial questionnaire (T1), including the PSBQ and\ndemographic and personal history questions, was accompa-\nnied by a letter introducing the study letting them know their\nemployer had no affiliation with this study and would never\nknow who participated, requesting that they return the com-\npleted questionnaire within 1 week, and a stamped pre-\naddressed return envelope. Reminder postcards were placed\nin all of the employee mailboxes after the first week. At T2\n(2 weeks post), participants completed only the PSBQ.\nInformed consent was provided to potential participants and\nwas assumed with return of the completed questionnaire.\nParticipants received no compensation.\nData Analysis\nData were analyzed using R Statistical Package Version\n4 SAGE Open\nbeliefs in women who seek or avoid routine Pap testing, par-\nticipants were placed in one of two groups (Routine/Non-\nRoutine) based on their response to the question regarding\nwhen they had their last Pap test. Univariate logistic regres-\nsions (Kutner, Neter, Nachtsheim, & Li, 2004) were con-\nducted to examine if any of the background characteristics\nand PSBQ subscales were significant predictors of seeking\n(Routine) or avoiding (Non-Routine) CCS. Temporal stabil-\nity was assessed through test\u00adretest reliability with an intra-\nclass correlation and construct validity through known-group\ntechnique with independent-sample t test. All negatively\nworded items were reverse coded prior to analysis.\nSignificance was set at p = .05 across analyses.\nAfter running the univariate statistics, we decided to\ndichotomize variables associated with some of the back-\nground characteristics due to low cell sizes in certain catego-\n>US$30,000; educational attainment to  high school (or\ngeneral education diploma [GED]) or >high school; insur-\nance availability to yes/no; and age at first intercourse to <18\nyears of age or 18 years of age.\nResults\nSixty-five questionnaires were returned for T1 (16% response\nrate), with 53 meeting eligibility for participation (6 were\neliminated due to male gender, 2 women were below 21 years\nof age, and 4 reported having had a hysterectomy). Nineteen\nquestionnaires were returned for T2 (36% response rate). For\nthe current study, the PSBQ had good internal consistency,\nwith a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .81. Subscale alphas\nwere generally good to acceptable with Barriers  = .85,\nVulnerability  = .78, and Experiences  = .87, with only the\nBenefits subscale having a poor internal consistency ( =\n.51). Reliability of the Benefit subscale decreased in this\nstudy from the previous study (Ackerson et al., 2014). An\nexplanation for this may be that this sample was more homo-\ngeneous in their beliefs about the benefits of screening, or the\ntwo items that were added affected reliability estimates.\nThese items may be addressing factors other than benefits of\nscreening. Test\u00adretest reliability of the 31-item PSBQ was\nconducted and found to be very good (.823). Range of scores\non the PSBQ in the current study was 93 to 138, with higher\nscores representing more positive attitudes toward screening.\nConstruct Validity Through Known-Group\nTechnique\nPlacing the participants in one of two groups allowed the\nopportunity to use a contrasting or known-group approach to\nvalidity (Polit & Beck, 2010). If the PSBQ 31 is a valid mea-\nsure, then the non-routine participants should exhibit signifi-\ncantly lower scores reflecting more negative attitudes.\nIndependent t tests were conducted to compare the mean\nPSBQ 31 between the non-routine and routine groups. The\nnon-routine group of women had significantly lower scores\nences in the between-groups total was moderate (2 = .13).\nThe guidelines (proposed by Cohen, 1988) for interpreting\nthe effect size value are as follows: .01 = small effect, .06 =\nmoderate effect, .14 = large effect (Pallant, 2005). This dem-\nonstrates that the PSBQ had statistically significant moderate\neffects using the known-groups technique; women who\navoid routine Pap testing would be predicted to have more\nnegative attitudes toward Pap testing and cervical cancer\nthan those women who obtain routine Pap tests.\nThe demographic profile of the 53 respondents is pre-\nsented in Table 2. Eighty-one percent (n = 43) indicated hav-\ning a Pap test within the previous 3 years. Women ranged in\nless (53%). Most were educated, with 91% of the sample\nreporting having some college or a college degree. Most\nwomen were covered by medical insurance (89%). Thirty-\none percent of the sample reported a history of sexual trauma\nand 24% had experienced physical trauma.\nResults of the univariate logistic regression indicated that\nthe only significant predictor of seeking/avoiding routine\nscreening by women's background characteristics was social\ninfluence (p = .04; odds ratio [OR] = 5.83), although insur-\nance availability was marginally significant (p = .06; see\nTable 2). A majority of the routine group were socially influ-\nenced to value CCS by their mothers and health care provid-\ners, whereas a majority of the non-routine group reported\nbeing influenced by no one. The subscales found to be sig-\nnificant predictors in Pap testing were Barriers to Screening\nsee Table 1).\nTable 1.

In particu-\nlar, two subscales from the measure were particularly strong\npredictors of CCS attendance: Barriers and Previous Exam\nExperiences. The results of this study provide further\nunderstanding of women's personal characteristics, as well\nas their attitudes and beliefs about CCS that relate to avoid-\ning routine CCS, even in the context of availability of health\ncare. It is relevant to note that a substantial portion of women\nin this sample avoid CCS, despite having insurance cover-\nage. Furthermore, women who seek CCS and women who\navoid CCS both recognized that there were benefits to\nTable 2.

Thus, both basic knowledge of the ben-\nefits of CCS and having insurance (thus access) seem to be\ninadequate to promote screening behavior. Despite the fact\nthat this was a reasonably well-educated sample of women,\nmisinformation about cervical cancer and Pap tests was prev-\nalent. Many women reported feeling that they were not vul-\nnerable to cervical cancer and thus did not believe testing\nwas necessary (in both the routine and non-routine CCS\ngroups). However, the source of this perceived invulnerabil-\nity may be different for the two groups: The routine group\nmay feel that they are not vulnerable to cervical cancer\nbecause they obtain routine screenings. However, women\nwho avoid routine screening may lack knowledge about\nscreening, or be misinformed regarding cervical cancer risks.\nThis may, in turn, perpetuate a belief of invulnerability,\nthereby contributing to avoidance behavior. This information\nis important, particularly in the context of our finding that the\nwomen who do not seek routine screening generally report\nno other support or encouragement from their social resources\nto influence screening behavior. Not only can social supports\nbe utilized to encourage screening behavior, but perhaps\nthese same social influences could also be used to share cor-\nrective health information that might influence women to\nseek routine CCS.\nIndeed, women who were socially influenced to value and\nreceive a Pap test were more than 5 times more likely to\nreceive routine screening, compared with women who had no\nsocial influences. Specifically, women in this study were\nencouraged to obtain screening primarily by their mothers and\nhealth care providers, which helps illuminate the importance\nof highly influential others in contributing to screening behav-\nior. Interventions to boost seeking and adherence to CCS\nguidelines, then, may be made more effective by incorporating\nthe support of these others to encourage women's screening.\nThis is particularly salient, given the finding that women who\navoid screening had no major social influences that encour-\naged CCS. Approximately 58% of the routine group indicated\nthat they were socially influenced to value routine CCS either\nwhereas 50% of the non-routine group reported that no one\ninfluenced them. These findings are similar to previous\nresearch, which found that women who avoid routine screen-\ning were not socially influenced by any important individual\nin their life and did not receive adequate information to make\na well-informed decision regarding CCS (Ackerson, 2010,\nresearch has found some mixed results as to the power of\nhealth care provider influence at promoting Pap testing (Fatone\nsuggest that providers play an important role. The influence of\nhealth care providers may interact with the quality of a wom-\nan's relationship with her provider, relationship stability, and\nfactors such as rapport and trust. It is also possible that even\nwhen women who avoid CCS recognize the value of such pre-\nventive health care, other factors including negative previous\nexam experiences are more salient and may have a greater\nimpact on their screening behavior.\nWomen's perceptions of barriers to routine screening and\na negative history of gynecological exam experiences may\ndirectly contribute to avoidance. In this study, the non-rou-\ntine group perceived more personal barriers. Perceived bar-\nriers to obtaining routine Pap tests are both system barriers\nand individual barriers. System barriers such as time, access,\nand how women are treated at the time of the exam are\nimportant to address and can be modified in the health care\nsetting or through social endeavors, such as the Affordable\nCare Act. Insurance availability was marginally significant\namong this group of women (most of them were insured).\nHaving insurance is a well-known predictor of CCS, and\nwomen without health insurance are less likely to receive\nroutine screening (Fedewa et al., 2012). However, even\ninsured women are vulnerable to screening avoidance, par-\nticularly when they have low income and higher copays.\nMaking gynecological visits more accessible and conve-\nnient for women (evening visits and weekends, especially\nfor women who may not be able to take time off from work)\nis one way to reduce this perceived barrier. In addition,\nchanging how Pap tests are delivered by making sure pro-\nviders are trained to deliver the exam in a sensitive manner\nis one way to address a system-level barrier that will, of\ncourse, help put women at ease. This modification also has\nthe potential to influence individual-level barriers that pre-\nvent women from seeking screening, as it is likely to make\nwomen feel more knowledgeable, less embarrassed, and\nbuild trust with their provider.\nIndeed, individual barriers, such as fear and embarrass-\nment, are not uncommon in the research literature associ-\nated with avoidance behavior (Guilfoyle, Franco, & Gorin,\nriers are difficult to overcome and, just as they are likely to\nbe related to a complex range of factors including previous\npersonal and health care experiences, interventions address-\ning these internal barriers will require a multifaceted\napproach. A positive interaction between the woman and her\nprovider is necessary. A provider who explains what will be\ndone at the time of the gynecological exam may promote\nincrease in knowledge, reduce fear and anxiety of the\nunknown, and help promote feelings that the screening test\nis important, thus increasing the likelihood of routine\nscreening.\nSome research indicates that women avoid CCS because\nthey are afraid something abnormal will be found, and they\nwould prefer ignorance rather than the negative screening\nresult (Ackerson & Preston, 2009). This avoidance too is\nlikely an emotional response to the anxiety associated with the\nuncertainty or threat (abnormal cervical cells vs. normal cells).\nAs women in the current study in large part believed that they\nwere not vulnerable to cervical cancer, screening avoidance\nmay have been related to fear of this threat. This anxiety-\nrelated barrier to screening may also relate to previous\nAckerson et al. 7\nnegative exam experiences (e.g., excessive worry over an\nabnormal test result) and/or may contribute to their lack of\ntrust in providers (e.g., \"Doctors only give bad news\").\nMany women perceive the gynecological exam to be an\nuncomfortable procedure that has the potential to make an\nindividual feel vulnerable and embarrassed. Factors that may\ncontribute to negative perceptions of or experiences with Pap\ntesting include providers who are not sensitive to a woman's\nindividual needs, who are not \"present\" at that visit, or who\ndo not treat the woman with respect. Providers who fail to\nprovide clear verbal communication about the Pap procedure\nor who approached the exam in a hurried manner may exac-\nerbate these negative feelings (Ackerson, 2012). These nega-\ntive emotions related to the screening may be even more\nsubstantial for women with a history of sexual or physical\nabuse or assault. Women with these histories may avoid\nscreening due to the physical nature of the exam, which may\nserve as a reminder of the traumatic event for some women.\nAlthough the difference was not statistically significant in\nour sample, it is important to note that 50% of the non-rou-\ntine group reported having a history of interpersonal violence\n(compared with only 32% of routine group), thus it is possi-\nble that the study may have been underpowered to find this\neffect due to the small sample size.\nStrengths and Limitations\nThe current study has important strengths and some limita-\ntions. This study is among the first of which we are aware to\nutilize a multidimensional theoretical model to explore a\nrange of factors contributing to seeking/avoiding routine\nscreening behavior. The sample, which represented a wide\nrange of working women, adds a valuable contribution to this\nliterature, which has often examined CCS behavior in more\ndiscrete samples (e.g., low-income, uninsured women).\nBecause participants were selected from one large workplace,\nhowever, it is possible that the findings might not be represen-\ntative of working women or women with access to health care\nin general. The low response rate may reflect a response bias,\nthus results should be interpreted with some caution, although\nother factors may have also played a role, for example, some\nemployees may work outside of the office, thus not have had\naccess to the survey in their mailbox during the open time\nperiod for response submission. Because of the small sample\nsize, factor analysis could not be conducted, which is another\nprocedure to help validate measurement tools. To conduct a\nfactor analysis with a 31-item scale, it is recommended that\nthere be at least 10 to 15 participants for each item (Pett et al.,\nto 480 participants. In addition, as this was a pilot study, we\nshould have included some open-ended questions at the end\nof the instrument asking for any comments they wish to make\nabout the instrument. Overall, however, the current study\noffers important insights into factors contributing to screen-\ning/avoidance, which may help future efforts develop\nin-clinic or community-based interventions to promote\nscreening behavior.\nImplications for Practice\nDespite the ample scientific evidence that routine Pap tests\ndecrease cervical cancer, some women still avoid routine\nscreening. This research should be replicated in a larger,\nmore socioeconomically and educationally diverse sample\nto better understand background characteristics and experi-\nences that influence routine screening behavior in a wider\nrange of women. In addition, a larger sample will enable\nfurther validity and reliability testing of the PSBQ, that is,\nfactor analysis. Further research should be conducted evalu-\nating how providers describe the interaction between them-\nselves and their client. It is important to obtain not only the\nclient's perspective, but the provider's as well at the time or\nsoon after the interaction occurs. Understanding any differ-\nences in perceptions (client's and provider's) associated\nwith the interaction (Pap test and pelvic exam) may lend to\nimproved communication techniques, exam approach,\naffective support, which has the potential to contribute to\nbetter care and client satisfaction. Understanding women's\nattitudes toward CCS will help health care providers, who\ndeal with gynecological health, develop more effective\nscreening programs and interventions, thus facilitating a\nbetter experience for women and contributing to an increase\nin routine screening.\nConclusion\nImproving rates of adherence to routine Pap testing is a mul-\ntifaceted and complicated public health problem. Personal\nbarriers contributing to avoidance behavior may need to be\naddressed individually and through community- or family-\nbased interventions directed at women who avoid or are at\nrisk of avoiding routine screening. We also need to address\nthe ways in which health care providers educate and interact\nwith women, and ensure that Pap testing is both encouraged\nand approached in a careful and sensitive way. Future out-\nreach efforts must include components designed to address\nwomen's emotional experiences and the emotional factors\nthat related to screening avoidance. If we can predict the\nnegative emotions elicited by the exam in some women, we\ncan develop public health interventions that will be sensitive\nand responsive to women at greatest risk for avoiding future\nscreenings.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\n8 SAGE Open\nReferences\nAbel, E., & Chambers, K.
