A\nnomadic tribe, the Keriyans, live in the center of the\nTaklamakan Desert along the seasonal Keriya River. This is\none of the most harsh, hot and arid areas in the world with\nan annual rainfall of less than 20 mm and temperature highs\nof between 50-60\u00b0C. In a sense, the Keriyans offer some\nimportant advantages for scientific research since they are\nalmost entirely secluded from the world due to undevel-\noped traffic, the monotone nature of genetic background\ndue to less communication with others and low education,\nand the economic blockade due to their nomadic lifestyle.\nThey survive on meat products and desert sap seepage, and\nlive in tribe-dominated familial clusters, which yield close\nmarital relationships. Therefore, the Keriyans are a clan-\nnish tribe with their own characteristics, for example in\nterms of lifestyle, marriage, diet and drinking-water. In the\npresent study, we aimed to explore the traditional risk fac-\ntors of hypertension in the Taklimakan Desert of Xinjiang\nProvince as well as the association of hypertension with\ntheir diet and water quality.\nMethods\nThe protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang\nMedical University and Hetian Region Government.\nInformed written consent for participation in the study was\nobtained from each participant.\nStudy population\nWe conducted medical surveys in the Keriyan Village\nical surveys were conducted in the Keriyan Village in\nArea epidemiological research on\nhypertension risk factors of Keriyans\nin the Taklimakan Desert\nHaitao Cao1, Zuheng Cheng2, Fenghui Chen3 and Zhijian Ding1\n Keywords\nKeriyans, epidemiology, hypertension, water quality, diet\n1Cardiology Department,The No. 2 People's Hospital of Changzhou,\nChina\n2Cardiology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang\nMedical University, China\n3National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Chinese Academy of\nMedical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, China\nCorresponding author:\nHaitao Cao, Cardiology Department, The No. 2 People's Hospital of\nChangzhou, China.\nOriginal Article\n602 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)\nSeptember 2005, i.e., Phase I.

At present, most people think Keriyans are\nrelated to the Uighurs, but this remains to be confirmed.\nQuestionnaire survey\nThe standardized methods of the World Health Organization\n(WHO) MONICA project were used to collect information\non anthropometry (body height, weight, waist and hip cir-\ncumference abdominal perimeter) and lifestyle habits\n(including 24 h diet recall). Other measurements included\nblood pressure, an electrocardiograph and an echocardio-\ngram. Cigarette smoking was defined as smoking at least\none cigarette per day for one year or more. According the\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\n(NIAAA) criteria, alcohol drinking was defined as drinking\nat least 8 g alcohol per week.\nPhysical examination and sample collection\nBody height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure\nwere checked. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as\nmass in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.\nEthylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA)-blood samples\nwere obtained after a fasting period. Blood electrolyte, glu-\ncose, cholesterol, renal and liver functions and a serum iron\nassay were determined by use of an automatic biochemical\nanalyzer in the central laboratory of the First Affiliated\nHospital of Xinjiang Medical University. Fasting plasma\nglucose was detected by a Glucorder Analyzer (Roche).\nCollection and analysis of water samples\nLocal drinking water samples in the Taklimakan Desert and\nYutian country were collected according to the standard crite-\nria for drinking water, as stipulated by the People's Republic\nof China in July 2007.

Univariate analy-\nsis indicated that age, gender, alcohol drinking, overweight\nand obesity, waist circumference, low LDLC, high plasma\nglucose levels, high salt intake and high fat intake served as\nthe hypertension risk factors of Keriyans population in this\nstudy. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analy-\nsis showed that age, gender, waist circumference, high\nplasma glucose levels and a high salt intake were signifi-\ncantly associated with hypertension for Keriyans popula-\ntion (Table 2),but also were significantly associated with\nhypertension for Yutian population except waist (Table 3).\nTable 1.

In\nthe univariate analysis, no significant associations were\nnoted for energy, fat, carbohydrate, prandial fiber, protein,\ncholesterol, vitamin A, aneurin, riboflavin, nicotinic acid,\nvitamin C and E, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, iron,\nzinc, selenium, manganese and copper. Calcium, sodium,\nsalt intake were risk factors with hypertension. In the multi-\nvariate unconditional regression analysis salt intake, ribofla-\nvin, calcium and sodium were positive associated with\nhypertension, whereas nicotinic acid showed negative asso-\nciations. Stepwise logistic stepwise regression analysis\nincorporating the nutriment of significance showed that salt\nintake (odds ratio (OR)=1.724) and sodium intake\n(OR=1.002) as the risk factors showed significant and posi-\ntive associations with hypertension. And for Yutian popula-\ntion, this analysis showed that sodium intake (OR=1.001) as\nthe risk factors with hypertension (Table 4).\nCorrelation analysis of the water samples indicated that\nthe coefficients were significant at 0.05 level with hyper-\ntension and showed a positive correlation for water\ncalcium(r=0.642), Negative associations were found for\n(r=0.710). No statistically significant difference was\nobserved for water hardness, manganese, copper and iron.\nDiscussion\nThe Keriyans have adapted to the extreme hot and arid\nenvironment in the Taklimakan Desert. They hardly sweat\nor feel thirsty even when they graze their livestock in the\ndesert at about 50\u00ad60\u00b0C during the day. It is speculated that\nthey have a special fitness index, acid-base and electrolyte\nbalance regulation system or genetic basis for this. The\nKeriyans are isolated from the rest of the world because\ntheir environment is inaccessible for the others. Moreover,\nthey are generally married within their community and\nrarely marry anyone else from the outside world. Thus, the\ncharacteristics of the Keriyans result from gene-environment\ninteraction. The Keriyans live in a different way from the\ncontrol group. They have two meals a day with low calorie\nintake but they consume much energy when they graze\nlivestock among the sparse Populus euphratica trees and\nsand dunes. The Keriyans are seldom fat and the incidence\nrate of hypertension, diabetes is very low according to our\nsurvey.\nFirst, soil salt is the main seasoning for Keriyans, who\nconsume low levels of sodium in diet. It is estimated that\nthe average salt intake (\u00b1SD) among adult Keriyans is\nmmol; thereof intake of less than 100 mmol accounts for\n58.5%. In contrast, among Yutian adults the average salt\ng (p<0.001), as well as the average sodium intake at\nEvidence is mounting to suggest that the dietary intake\nof potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium are closely\nassociated with blood pressure variation. The aborigines on\nthe Pacific Islands have been accustomed to a virtually no-\nsalt diet, and there are almost no hypertension cases\nreported.3 In contrast, the average salt intake among resi-\ndents in Hokkaido reaches as high as 15-20 g per day, even\n26-55 g per day, which results in a high incidence of hyper-\ntension (84%).4 Experimental animal studies also support\nthe notion that high sodium intake can accelerate the devel-\nopment of hypertension and vascular damage.5,6 Secondly,\nthe drinking water of the Keriyans is from the sap seepage,\nwhich contains high levels of magnesium (119.23 mg/l)\nwhen compared with the standard threshold (20-30 mg/l),\nwhile the calcium content is relatively lower than the stand-\nOur correlation analysis indicated that the calcium con-\ntent of the water was associated with the hypertension\ndetection rate in a positive manner, while for magnesium in\na negative manner, which could lend some support for the\nantagonistic action of calcium and magnesium in blood\npressure regulation. However, in general, the drinking\nwater in the Taklimakan Desert is characterized by high\nmagnesium content, in line with the low detection rate of\nhypertension in this study. We thus speculate that the low\nincidence of hypertension among Keriyans might be attrib-\nuted to their drinking water. Since the establishment of the\nTongguzbasti village in 1990 in Hetian City, modern ways\nare gradually infiltrating this previously closed region and,\naccordingly, the incidence of hypertension might increase\nand so need periodic follow-ups. It is reported that calcium\nTable 4. Multivariate regression analysis of hypertension with age, high glucose and salt intake in \"desert men\" andYutian\npopulations.\nGroups Variables Coefficient Standard error Wald value p OR 95% CI\ncontent in drinking water is positively related to systolic\nblood pressure and has also served as a risk factor for car-\ndiovascular diseases.7 In 1999, Yang and Chiu documented\nthat there is a significant protective effect of magnesium\nintake from drinking water on the risk of hypertension,8\nwhich leads to the speculation that magnesium plays an\nimportant role in blood pressure regulation. The potential\nmechanisms for magnesium to lower blood pressure might\nbe (a) the dilatation of renal vessels; (b) the acceleration of\nprostaglandin release; (c) the stimulation of sodium pump-\ning and adenosine kinase, which is increased in case of\nmagnesium loss; (d) the regulation by renin of magnesium\ncan make the blood vessels constricted. On the other hand,\nmagnesium excess can dilate the vascular smooth muscular\nor block ganglions, which can dilate the peripheral vessels,\nand hence lower blood pressure.8 Magnesium is involved in\nin a variety of physiological processes of the vascular tis-\nsues, and is related closely to blood pressure regulation. In\nthe peripheral vasculature, magnesium and calcium are\ninvolved in regulation via neurohumoral effects, the kid-\nConclusion\nCorrelation analysis indicated that age, hyperglycemia and\nsalt consumption were correlated with Keriyans' hyperten-\nsion risk factors, which leads to the speculation that the\nwater of the desert area which is characterized by low cal-\ncium and high magnesium might account for the low inci-\ndence of hypertension in Keriyans. The Keriyans live a\ndifferent lifestyle from the controls. They have a low calo-\nrie intake but they expend much energy. They consume\nsignificantly lower levels of sodium than other groups. We\nspeculate that low salt intake is the most important factor\nof the low incidence of hypertension and low calcium and\nhigh magnesium levels in water might be another reasons\nfor the low incidence of hypertension in Keriyans.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic\nstudy of hypertension risk factors in the Keriyans in\nTaklimakan Desert. Our results may be helpful to study\nmechanisms of how people adapt to the extreme hot and\narid environment.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nFunding\nThis work was financially supported by the National\nReferences\n1.
