    "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Much of the inequality literature has focused on national inequality, but\nlocal inequality is also important. Crime rates are higher in more unequal cities; people\nin unequal cities are more likely to say that they are unhappy. There is a negative\nassociation between local inequality and the growth of city-level income and population,\nonce we control for the initial distribution of skills. High levels of mobility across cities\nmean that city-level inequality should not be studied with the same analytical tools\nused to understand national inequality, and policy approaches need to reflect the urban\ncontext. Urban inequality reflects the choices of more and less skilled people to live\ntogether in particular areas. City-level skill inequality can explain about one-third of\nthe variation in city-level income inequality, while skill inequality is itself explained by\nhistorical schooling patterns and immigration. Local income also reflects the substantial\ndifferences in the returns to skill across, which are related to local industrial patterns.\nThe inequality of cities may be as important as the inequality of countries.\nThe connection between crime and inequality is as strong within urban areas\nas it is across countries (Daly, Wilson, and Vasdev, 2001; Fajnzylber, Lederman,\nand Loayza, 2002). Envy is more likely to be directed toward near neighbors,\nthan geographically dispersed compatriots (Luttmer, 2005). Inequality within\ncities seems as likely to generate political uprisings as inequality across large\ngeographic units. Yet almost all of the economic research on inequality has\nfocused on countries rather than cities.\nMoreover, there are many reasons to think that inequality within cities\nis quite different than inequality within countries. The ready movement of\n*The authors thank the Taubman Center for State and Local Government for financial\nsupport.\npeople across space within a nation means that the inequality of a particular\nplace is likely to reflect the selection of skilled and unskilled workers into that\nplace. Easy mobility across city boundaries means that redistributive policies\nthat would lead to a more equal society if applied at the national level may\nlead to disastrous results at the city level. City-specific redistribution may lead\nto an exodus of the wealthy and an influx of the poor that leaves the city\nimpoverished.\nIn this paper, we look at the causes and consequences of urban inequality.\nAmerica is, on the whole, relatively unequal for a developed country (Alesina\nand Glaeser, 2004), but there are some areas within the United States that\nare a lot more equal than others. While Manhattan is the physical embodi-\nment of big-city inequality and has a Gini coefficient of 0.6, the Gini coeffi-\ncient of Kendall County, Illinois is only about one-half that amount. Kendall\nis a small but rapidly growing county on the outskirts of the Chicago area\nthat combines agriculture with a growing presence of middle-income subur-\nthe measurement of inequality across metropolitan areas.\nParadoxically, local inequality is actually the inverse of area-level income\nsegregation. Holding national inequality constant, local inequality falls as peo-\nple are stratified across space so that rich live with rich and poor live with poor.\nA perfectly integrated society, where rich and poor were evenly distributed\nacross space, would have highly unequal metropolitan areas that mirror the\nentire U.S. income distribution.\nIn Section 3, we find that almost one-third of the variance in income\ninequality across space can be explained by differences in the skill distribution\nacross metropolitan areas. Places with abundant college graduates and high\nschool dropouts are areas that are particularly unequal. One-half of the\nvariation in income inequality can be explained by the occupation-based\ninequality. Traditional economic models try to explain the location of skilled\nand unskilled workers with differences in the returns to skill and differences\nin amenities (Dahl, 2002). We accept this framework, but empirically, we find\nthat history and immigration seem to be the most important determinants of\ninequality today.\nSixty percent of the heterogeneity in skills across larger metropolitan areas\ncan be explained by the share of high school dropouts in the area in 1940 and the\nshare of the population that is Hispanic. Long-standing historical tendencies\nare highly correlated with the location of high school dropouts and the location\nof Hispanic immigrants today. Historical skill patterns also play a huge role in\nthe current location of college graduates (Moretti, 2004), and explain much of\nthe distribution of skills across space.\nMetropolitan inequality also reflects differences in the returns to skill. A\nmodified Gini coefficient that holds the skill composition of each area constant,\nbut allows the returns to skill to vary, can explain 50 percent of the varia-\ntion in the actual Gini coefficient across metropolitan areas. The correlation\nbetween the raw Gini coefficient at the metropolitan area level and the esti-\nmated returns to a college degree in that area is 73 percent.\nWe do not fully understand why some places reward skill so much more\nstrongly than others. In our data, the most powerful correlate of the returns to\nhaving a college degree is the share of population with college degrees, but that\nfact provides more confusion than clarity. The correlation could reflect skilled\npeople moving to areas where there are large returns to skill. Alternatively, it\nmight reflect human capital spillovers that cause the returns to skill to rise.\nHopefully, future research will help us better understand the differences in the\nreturns to skill across metropolitan areas.\nIn Section 4 of this paper, we turn to the consequences of local inequal-\nity. We find a significant negative correlation between local economic growth\nand income inequality once we control for other initial conditions, such as the\ninitial distribution of skills and temperature. Places with unequal skills actu-\nally grow more quickly, but places with more income inequality, holding skills\nconstant, have slower income and population growth. Our data also confirm a\nrobust relationship between the murder rate and inequality. Luttmer (2005)\ndocuments that people are less happy when they live around richer people. We\nalso find people who live in more unequal countries report themselves to be less\nhappy.\nIn Section 5, we discuss the policy issues surrounding local inequality. Even\nif we accept that local inequality has some unattractive consequences, the con-\nsequences of reducing local inequality, holding national inequality fixed, are\nquite unclear. Reducing local inequality, leaving the national skill distribu-\ntion untouched, implies increased segregation of the rich and the poor. Local\nredistribution may just increase that segregation. Section 6 concludes.\nIn the analysis that follows, we will use metropolitan areas as our ge-\nographic unit and the Gini coefficient as our measure of income inequality.\nMetropolitan areas are defined as multicounty agglomerations that surround\na city with a \"core urban area\" of over 50,000 people. Metropolitan areas have\nthe advantage of at least approximating local labor markets, and they are large\nenough to provide a certain measure of statistical precision. The disadvantage\nof using these areas is that they do not correspond to natural political units,\nwhich makes them awkward units for analyzing or discussing public policy.\nWe have chosen to use Primary, rather than Consolidated, metropolitan\nareas, which are somewhat smaller units. This decision allows us to work with\nmore observations, and it picks up variation within massive agglomerations,\nbut it also creates some mismeasurement because occasionally, the residents\nof one area work in another.\nMuch of the data for this paper come from the 5 percent integrated public-\n2008). In most cases, we restrict ourselves to total household income, which\nmeans that we are not treating single people differently from married people.\nWe focus on pretax income inequality.1 A particular problem with using Census\ndata to measure income inequality is that incomes in the 2000 Census are top-\nthe income top-code, but recognize that this is understating the true degree of\nincome inequality.\nWe use the Gini coefficient as our measure of inequality, mainly because it\nis the ubiquitous standard in the inequality literature. Many policy discussions\nof inequality focus on poverty, and reducing poverty levels is a natural topic of\npolicy attention. Yet this essay is focused on extremes at both the upper and\nlower levels of the income distribution, and the Gini coefficient captures that\nheterogeneity. The Gini coefficient is defined as 1 - 1\n^\ny y\n(1 - F(y))2 dy, where\n^\ny is the mean income in the sample and F(y) is the share of the population\nwith income levels less than y. This measure has the interpretation as the area\nbetween the 45 curve (which indicates perfect equality) and the Lorenz curve.2\nThe Gini coefficient has the advantage of being invariant with respect to\nscale, so that larger areas or richer areas do not necessarily have larger or\nsmaller Gini coefficients. Moreover, a 10 percent increase in everyone's income\nwill not impact the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient also always rises when\nincome is transferred from a poorer person to a richer person. One standard\ncriticism of the Gini coefficient is that the average Gini coefficient of a number\nof areas will not equal the Gini coefficient calculated for those areas all together.\nThere are several plausible alternatives such as the variance of in-\ncome within an area (\ny\n(y - ^\ny)2 dF(y)) or the coefficient of variation\n^\ny y\n(y - ^\ny)2 dF(y)). The coefficient of variation, unlike the variance, will not\nincrease or decrease if all incomes are scaled up or down by the same per-\ncentage amount. A final type of measure is the difference in income between\nindividuals in different places of the income distribution, for example the dif-\npercentiles of the income distribution. We calculate these differences using the\nlogarithm of income.\nUsing the 2000 Census 5 percent microsample, we calculate these five\ndifferent income inequality measures at the metropolitan area level: (1) the\nGini coefficient using household income, (2) the variance of household income,\n(3) the coefficient of variation of household income, (4) the income difference\n1Our income measures, like many in this literature, exclude nonincome returns from capital\nownership, like the flow of services associated with owning a home.\n2If we let p denote F(y), i.e., the share of the population earning less than y, then the Lorenz\ncurve plots the share of national income going to individuals earning less than F-1(p) as a function\nof p, i.e., 1\n^\nf (y)y dy.\nbetween the 90th and 10th percentiles of the household income distribution,\ncalculated as the difference in the logs of these numbers, and (5) the income\ndifference between the log 75th and 25th percentiles of the household income\ndistribution. Table 1 shows the correlation between our five measures as well\nas the correlation between these measures and the logarithm of both median\nfamily income in the area and population size.\nThe most reassuring fact in the table is that these income measures have\na fairly high correlation. For example, the correlation coefficient between the\nGini coefficient and the coefficient of variation is 92 percent. The correlation\nbetween the Gini coefficient and the 90\u00ad10 percentile income difference is 91\npercent. The variance is less correlated with these other measures because it is\nhighly correlated with the mean level of income in the area. In general, these\ndifferent measures give us a similar picture of which metropolitan areas within\nthe United States are most unequal.\nWe are interested not only in the stability of income inequality between\ndifferent measures, but also in the stability of income inequality over time.\nOverall, the correlation between the Gini coefficient in 1980 and the Gini coef-\nficient in 2006 is 0.58, which suggests neither extreme permanence nor enor-\nmous change in the rankings. Places that had an unusually high level of income\ninequality in 1980 revert slightly to mean and have relatively less inequality\ntoday. As the Gini coefficient in 1980 increases by 0.1, the growth in the Gini\ncoefficient over the next 26 years falls by 0.03. Some of the impermanence (and\nmean reversion) surely reflects measurement error in the Gini coefficient.\nthe most equal metropolitan areas 25 years ago with the Appleton-Oshkosh-\nNeenah MSA's Gini coefficient of 0.33, and Gainesville, Florida, was the most\nunequal metropolitan area with a Gini coefficient of 0.45. Two very poor Texas\nareas (Brownsville and McAllen) had the next highest levels of inequality. Wis-\nconsin still has the country's most equal metropolitan area in 2006 (Sheboygan\nwith coefficient of 0.38), but even it is substantially less equal than the most\negalitarian places were 25 years ago. New Haven-Bridgeport-Stamford, with\nits combination of inner-city poverty and hedge-fund entrepreneurs, is now the\nmost unequal metropolitan area in the country with a Gini coefficient of 0.54.\nWhile the counties of New York (Manhattan), Fairfield, Connecticut, and\nOrleans Parish, Louisiana, when taken by themselves have higher Gini coeffi-\ncients than the New Haven-Bridgeport-Stamford metropolitan statistical area,\nthere are no other metropolitan areas that are even close to that Connecticut\narea in income inequality. The next three most unequal areas are Gainesville,\nFlorida; Athens, Georgia; and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Inequality shows up both\nin America's richest metropolitan areas, like New Haven, and in some of its\npoorer areas.\nThe inequality of the New Haven-Bridgeport-Stamford metropolitan sta-\ntistical area, and its wealth, reflects its place as a part of the extremely produc-\ntive greater New York area. This area has attracted some of the wealthiest\nworkers in the region, some of whom continue to work in Manhattan,\nTABLE 1: Table of Correlations Between Income Inequality Measures for 2000\nCoefficient of Difference of the Difference of the Log of\nVariance of the Variation Log of Income for Log of Income for Median\nGini Household of Household the 90th and the the 75th and the Family Log of\nCoefficient Income Income 10th Percentiles 25th Percentiles Income Population\nGini coefficient 1\nVariance of household\nincome\nCoefficient of the\nvariation of household\nincome\nDifference of the log of\nincome for the 90th and\nthe 10th percentiles\nDifference of the log of\nincome for the 75th and\nthe 25th percentiles\nLog of median family\nincome\nSource: The Gini coefficient, variance of household income, the coefficient of the variation of household income, the difference of the log of\nincome for the 90th and 10th percentiles, and the difference of the log of income for the 75th and 25th percentiles are calculated using the 5 percent\nIntegrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) for 2000, at usa.ipums.org. Median family income and population are from the 2000 Census.\nand some of whom now work in Greenwich or other suburban areas.\nThe area also contains some older industrial areas that remain extremely\npoor.\nIn 1980, there was a strong -59 percent correlation coefficient between\nmetropolitan area income and inequality. Today, the correlation coefficient is\n-14 percent. Twenty-five years ago, inequality was strongly associated with\npoverty. Today, the correlation is much weaker because there has been an\nexplosion of earnings among the richest Americans, which has made wealthy\nplaces more unequal as well. Some of this change may reflect changing top\ncoding, but it surely also reflects the enormous gains in wealth at the top end\nof the income distribution over the past 25 years in wealthy cities like San\nFrancisco.\nWhile the link between average income and inequality is becoming weaker,\nthe link between area population and inequality is becoming stronger. In 1980,\nthe raw correlation between population and the Gini coefficient was essen-\nwith area population. Regressions (1) and (2) in Table 2 show bivariate regres-\nsions where the Gini coefficient is regressed on contemporaneous income and\nbetween average income and the Gini coefficient fell by more than 40 percent\nand the connection between area population and the Gini coefficient increased\nby roughly the same percentage.\nIn 2000, the most equal Census divisions were the Great Plains and the\nleast equal divisions were the South and the New England (Gini coefficient av-\nerages of 0.457 and 0.46, respectively). These cross-division differences seemed\nrelatively small, not particularly stable and not particularly permanent over\ntime. For these reasons, we directed our focus on more local variables, such as\nthe distribution of skills, rather than more regional variables, such as market\npotential.\nDoes nominal income inequality imply inequality of real incomes or of\nconsumption? Prices differ across metropolitan areas, but if prices were the\nsame for every type of person in every area, then prices should not impact\ninequality, at least as measured by the coefficient of variation or the Gini\ncoefficient. However, as suggested by Broda and Romalis (2008), prices may be\nquite different for people at different places in the income distribution. New\nYork may be much more expensive for a relatively rich person than it is for a\nrelatively poor person. Indeed, the very fact that poor people continue to live in\nNew York suggests that the area may not be as expensive for them as average\nprices would indicate.\nThis issue could be addressed by developing different price indices for peo-\nple at different levels of the income distribution in different metropolitan areas,\nbut that is far beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, we have undertaken the\nfar simpler task of asking about the inequality of consumption of one important\ngood: housing. If places with more rich people are expensive places for the rich\nTABLE 2: Causes of Urban Inequality\nincome)\ncollege\nContinued\nTABLE 2: Continued\nShare of labor force in\nNotes: Standard errors in brackets.

We start\nwith a national housing price regression, where the logarithm of housing price\nis regressed on the characteristics of every household. Because of the limited\nnumber of housing characteristic data available from the Census microsample,\nwe instead use data for 46 of the largest metropolitan areas from the American\nacteristics include interior square footage, exterior square footage, the number\nof bathrooms, the number of bedrooms, and several other features. We then use\nthis regression to form a predicted housing price measure for every household.\nEssentially, we are using a hedonic regression to create a housing price index\nthat enables us to aggregate across different housing characteristics.\nWe use this housing consumption measure to calculate a Gini coeffi-\ncient of housing consumption for every metropolitan area. Figure 1 shows the\n38 percent correlation between this housing consumption Gini coefficient and\nour income Gini coefficient. More unequal incomes also have more unequal\nhousing consumption, but in general housing consumption inequality is much\nless than income inequality and housing consumption inequality is particu-\nlarly below income inequality in places with large amounts of income inequal-\nity. The mean housing consumption Gini coefficient is 0.29, much lower than\n0.45, which is the mean of the household income Gini for this subsample of\nWhile some of this difference can be attributed to measurement error,\nsince our hedonic regression omits many key housing attributes, this result\nstill suggests that places with highly unequal income levels have less housing\nconsumption inequality than one might expect. This fact does not prove that\nprices are largely offsetting incomes, but heterogeneity in local prices that\nimpact rich and poor people differently may be important, and measuring these\nprices and their impact is yet another interesting topic for future research.\nThe typical economic approach to earnings is to assume that they reflect\nthe interaction of human capital and the returns to human capital (e.g., Katz\nand Murphy, 1992). Indeed, human capital is often defined as including ev-\nerything that goes into earnings, in which case the relationship is essentially\ntautological. If human capital is reduced to being a scalar, h, then the wage\nassociated with each value of h is wi\n(h) where i represents each place. If the\ndensity of population in each area with human capital level h is gi\n(h), then\nthe average earnings in a locality is equal to\nh\nwi\n(h)gi\n(h) dh.

The Gini\ncoefficient is 1 - 1\n^\nyi\ny\ni\n(y)))2 dy, and if h is distributed uniformly on\nthe interval [^\nhi\n, ^\nhi\n] then the Gini coefficient is 1 - (i\n+i\n^\nhi\n)\n, which\nis a function of both the distribution of skills and the returns to skill.\nThe inequality of after-tax, after-redistribution earnings will then also be\naffected by the progressivity of the tax rate and the state of the social safety net.\nWe will turn to the heterogeneity in welfare payments later, but our primary\nfocus is on the dispersion of before-tax earnings. We will begin by discussing\nthe role that heterogeneous human capital plays in explaining the differences\nin inequality across space and the causes of that heterogeneous human capital.\nWe will then turn to differential returns to human capital and governmental\nafter-tax redistribution.\nHuman Capital Heterogeneity and Income Inequality Across Areas\nTo assess the role that human capital plays in explaining income inequality\nacross areas, we will take two complementary approaches. First, we will simply\nregress the Gini coefficient on measures of human capital. Second, we will\ncreate Gini coefficients for each metropolitan area based on the observable\nmeasures of human capital and national wage regressions. Both measures are\ncompromised by the fact that our measures of human capital are coarse. They\ncapture only the years of formal schooling and years of experience. True human\ncapital would include many more subtle factors, such as the quality of schooling\nand of experience.\nIn regression (3) of Table 2, we examine the relationship between the Gini\ncoefficient in 2000 and two primary measures of human capital in the same\nyear: the share of adults with college degrees and the share of adults who are\nhigh school graduates. We continue to control for area population and area\nincome. Both of these variables are extremely significant and they increase\nthe amount of variance explained (i.e., R2) from 15 percent to 49 percent. As\nsuch, more than one-third of the heterogeneity in income inequality across\nmetropolitan areas can be explained by these two basic measures of human\ncapital.\nThe coefficients are also large in magnitude. As the share of college grad-\nuates increases by 10 percent, the Gini coefficient rises by 0.031, a little more\nthan one standard deviation. As the share of high school graduates increases\nby 10 percent, the Gini coefficient drops by 0.018, about two-thirds of a stan-\ndard deviation. While it may be surprising that even such crude proxies for\nheterogeneity in the human capital distribution can do so well at explaining\nthe income distribution, this fact illustrates that much of inequality within an\narea reflects the heterogeneity of skills within that area.\nOne concern about results such as these is that perhaps the inequality of\nhuman capital within an area is itself an endogenous response to changes in\nthe returns to skill. If places that have high returns to having a college degree\nattract people with college degrees, then controlling for the skill distribution in\nthis way may also end up controlling for the returns to skill. After all, economic\ntheory predicts that college graduates should go to places where the returns\nto being a college graduate are higher. Of course, this cannot explain why\ninequality is higher where there are more high school dropouts, but it is still\nworth taking the endogeneity of skills seriously.\nOne approach to this endogeneity is to look at long-standing historical skill\npatterns. We only have data on the share of the population with high school and\ncollege degrees going back to 1940. In regression (4), we show the results using\nthose variables instead of contemporaneous college and high school graduation\nlevels. We continue to control for contemporaneous income and population, but\nthe results are unchanged if we remove those controls. Human capital levels in\n1940 are still strongly correlated with inequality today. The overall R2 declines\nto 32 percent, but these historical variables incrementally explain more than\n15 percent of the variation in the Gini coefficient.\nThe coefficient on the high school graduation rate in 1940 is quite close to\nthe coefficient on 2000 high school graduation. The coefficient on the college\ngraduation rate is more than three times higher using the older data. However,\nthe variation in the college graduation rate is much smaller in 1940, so a one\nstandard deviation increase in the college graduation rate has about the same\ngraduation rates have such a strong impact on modern inequality is that they\nstrongly predict the growth in college graduation rates after that point.\nIn the fifth regression, we go back even further and look at 19th century\nmeasures of human capital. We do not have measures of human capital in the\nadult population, but we do have enrollment rates for high schools and colleges\nduring this time period, which are found in historical Census data.4 The coef-\nficients on these enrollment rates are not, therefore, particularly comparable\nwith the coefficients on population-based skill measures in regressions (3) and\n(4). Unfortunately, we also lose over 70 metropolitan areas by using this histori-\ncal data. Nonetheless, in regression (5), we find that the share of the population\nenrolled in college in 1850 is a quite solid predictor of income inequality today.\nHigh school enrollment rates also continue to negatively predict inequality.\nIn this case, the incremental R2 created by those two variables when com-\npared to regression (2) is quite modest (5 percent). Still, we are impressed by the\nability of 150-year-old educational variables, measuring something quite dif-\nferent from modern skill levels, to explain anything. The coefficient on college\nenrollment in 1850 is quite large, but again this needs to be considered together\nwith the extremely small level of variation in this variable across space. These\nresults continue to suggest to us that historical patterns of human capital play\nsome role in explaining income inequality today.\nIn the sixth regression, we add two more historical measures of human\ncapital: (1) the share of the population that is illiterate in 1850 and (2) the\nshare of the population that was enslaved in that year. We interpret both\nmeasures as proxies for human capital deprivation. Learning to read is an\nobvious measure of human capital. Slave owners often opposed education\nfor their slaves. Indeed, during the century after emancipation, the former\nslave areas continued to provide particularly poor education for African Ameri-\ncans. Both illiteracy and slavery in 1850, help predict inequality today. Adding\nthese variables increases the R2 of the regression to 26 percent, an additional\n6 percent.\nAnother way of looking at the impact of human capital is to ask whether\nhuman capital in 1980 is associated with growth in inequality after that year.\nIn Table 3, we regress the Gini coefficient in the year 2006, calculated using\nthe American Community Survey (ACS), on the Gini coefficient in the year\n1980 and other controls. Though the ACS has a smaller sample size than the\nTABLE 3: Changes in Inequality over Time\nNotes: Standard errors in brackets. Significant at 5 percent, significant at 1 percent.\nSource: The Gini coefficient for 2006 is from the American Community Survey, 2006. The\nGini coefficient for 1980 is calculated using the 5 percent Integrated Public Use Microdata Series\nperiod of change by 30 percent. Regression (1) can be interpreted as a growth\nregression since we are asking about the determinants of inequality today,\nholding past inequality constant. The coefficient of 0.79 on the Gini coefficient\nthis could be the result of measurement error. The coefficients on income and\npopulation tell us that income inequality has been rising both in bigger areas\nand in richer areas.\nIn regression (2), we include our controls for human capital in 1980. Again,\nthere is a strong positive association between college graduation rates in 1980\nand inequality today. Places with more highly skilled people in 1980 have\nbecome more unequal over time, which presumably reflects both the rise in\nthe returns to skill and the tendency of skilled people to move to more skilled\nareas, which we will discus later. Places with more college dropouts have also\nbecome more unequal over time. Not only do contemporaneous skill levels\npredict inequality, but inequality of skills in 1980 predicts an increase in income\ninequality since then.\nWe now turn to our second means of assessing the importance of skill dis-\ntributions in explaining the inequality of income. In this approach, we calculate\nonly the income inequality from males between the ages of 25 and 55. To keep\nsample sizes up, we look only at the 102 metropolitan areas with more than\n500,000 people. We use only workers with positive earnings, and we use only\nlabor market income. We calculate three Gini coefficients. First, we calculate\nthe standard Gini coefficient using the earnings from these workers, and there\nis a 74 percent correlation between this Gini coefficient and our household\nincome Gini coefficient among these 102 metropolitan areas.\nWe then compare this Gini coefficient for male workers with Gini coef-\nficients based entirely on the human capital of these workers, by which we\nmean age and years of schooling. To calculate these \"human capital only\" Gini\ncoefficients, we use a nationwide earning regression to predict earnings for\neveryone in the sample. By using these predicted earnings rather than true\nearnings, we can isolate the impact of the level of human capital in an area\nwhile abstracting away from the differential returns to schooling. We calculate\nthe Gini coefficient based on these predicted earnings, and there is a 57 percent\ncorrelation between the two Gini coefficients.\nOur Gini coefficient based only on human capital explains about 33 percent\nof the variation in overall income inequality among working-age males. This\nis a considerable amount of explanatory power, but it still leaves plenty to be\nexplained. Another way of looking at the data is to note that the average Gini\ncoefficient calculated with human capital only is one-half the size of the Gini\ncoefficient calculated using true income. As such, human capital gets you some,\nbut far from all, of the way toward explaining the amount of income inequality.5\nOne reason why these human capital-based measures are failing to more\nfully explain actual income inequality might be that our human capital mea-\nsures are so coarse. Occupations may provide us with a richer means of measur-\ning individual-level human capital. As such, we created a third Gini coefficient\nusing the same sample but including occupation dummies in our wage regres-\nsions. These dummies are then used, along with years of schooling and age,\nto predict wages, and these predicted wages are used to calculate a local Gini\ncoefficient. The mean of this occupation-based Gini coefficient is about half-way\nbetween the Gini coefficient with just education and age and the Gini coeffi-\ncient of true income. If we accept that occupation is a measure of skills, then\nthis measure goes much more of the way toward explaining income inequality\nacross areas.\nFigure 2 shows the 86 percent correlation between this occupation-based\nGini coefficient and the true income Gini coefficient. The occupation-based\nindex has the ability to explain 73 percent of the variation in the true income\nGini coefficient. There are two interpretations of this finding. First, occupation\nmay be proxying for income more than human capital and therefore should\nnot be used as a control in the regression. Second, occupation may indeed be\na better measure of human capital. There is surely some truth in both views,\nbut we can draw the conclusion from this section that heterogeneity in human\ncapital across space can explain a considerable amount of the heterogeneity in\nincome inequality across space.\n5This work parallels the work of Combes, Duranton, and Gobillon (2008) on sorting by skill\nacross French areas. Like them, we find that sorting by skill matters, but in our case, we are\nfocused on the distribution of earnings within area, rather than the mean earnings of an area.\nAtlanta\nBaltimore\nBaton Rouge\nBoston\nChicago\nGary\nHouston\nLas Vegas\nLos Angeles\nMcAllen\nMobile\nNew Haven\nNew York\nOrange County\nPhiladelphia\nRochester\nSalt Lake City\nSan Francisco\nSan Jose\nScranton\nSeattle\nWashington DC\nWest Palm Beach\nYoungstown\nHuman Capital Only Gini Coefficient Using Occupation, 2000\nSource: Gini coefficients are calculated using the 5 percent Integrated Public Use Microdata\nSeries (IPUMS) for 2000, at usa.ipums.org.\nFIGURE 2: Gini Coefficient and Human Capital Only Gini Coeff. Using\nThe Causes of Human Capital Inequality\nWhy are the levels of human capital so different in different places? One\ntheory is that current human capital levels reflect long-standing education\npolicies formed over the last 200 years; Goldin and Katz (2008) provide a rich\ndescription of this history. Urban economists who emphasize people's location\ndecisions will tend to focus on differences in economic productivity and differ-\nences in amenities that motivate migration (e.g., Dahl, 2002). According to this\nview, areas that specialize in industries that are particularly good for low- or\nhigh-skill workers should disproportionately attract those workers. Of course,\nthis theory just pushes the puzzle one step backward. A more complete expla-\nnation for heterogeneity in skills would also explain why different industries\nare located in different places. In some cases, like cities with ports or coal\nmines, there are exogenous factors that explain industrial location, but observ-\nable variables tend to only explain a modest amount of industrial concentration\nAlternatively, amenities may draw high-skill workers to a particular loca-\ntion. For example, if there is some amenity that is particularly desirable and in\nparticularly short supply, then we would expect rich people to locate in places\nwith that amenity. This can certainly explain why there are so many rich people\nin Paris (Brueckner, Thisse, and Zenou, 1999) or on the Riviera. Alternatively,\nthere can be other amenities, such as access to public transportation, which\nmight draw poor people disproportionately to a given area.\nWhile the economic framework that emphasizes rational location choice\ncertainly has some ability to explain the distribution of skilled people across\nspace, many of the current skill patterns appear to be determined by long-\nstanding historical skill patterns, as discussed above. For example, there is a\n73 percent correlation between the share of adults with college degrees in the\ncollege share of the population in 1940 is able to explain more than 50 percent\nof the variation in the college share today, which suggests the enormous power\nof historical forces in shaping the skill composition of cities today.\nWe also run a regression that shows that skill growth is strongly predicted\nby the initial skill level. As the 1940 share of the adult population with college\ndegrees increased by 5 percent, the growth rate in the share of the population\nthere being mean reversion in this variable, there has been a tendency of skill\ngrowth to be concentrated in places that began with more skills (Berry and\nThe relationship between today and the past is much weaker at the bottom\nend of the skill distribution. There is a 45 percent correlation between the share\nof the adult population who did not have a high school degree in 1940 and the\nshare of the adult population without a high school degree in 2000. In this case,\nthe 1940 variable can only explain one-fifth of the variation in the high school\ndropout rate today. Figure 3 shows a number of places, such as Miami and\nMcAllen, Texas, which have particularly large high school dropout rates today\nrelative to their historical levels. Older variables, such as the percentage of the\npopulation enslaved in 1850, can explain about one-tenth of the variation in\nthe high school dropout rate today.\nThese outliers suggest that immigration, particularly from Latin America,\nis also associated with a heavy concentration of less skilled workers. There is\na 57 percent correlation between the share of the population that is Hispanic\nand the share of the population without a high school degree in 2000. Together,\nthe Hispanic share today and the dropout rate in 1940 can explain 61 percent\nof the variation in the dropout rate today. The Hispanic share is particularly\nhigh in Florida, Texas, and California, which are three states that were once\npart of the Spanish Empire and which are geographically close to Mexico and\nother countries in Latin America. The correlation between Hispanic share and\nMSAs latitude is -36 percent, reinforcing this point. Once again, history seems\nto play a large role in explaining the current skill distribution.\nBy contrast, the evidence supporting the importance of the traditional\neconomic explanations of the location of talent is much weaker. For example,\nthere is little evidence that highly skilled people have moved to areas with\nparticularly pleasant temperatures. There is no robust association between\nJanuary temperature and the share of the population with college degrees.\nBrownsville\nFort Walton Beach\nHouma\nIowa City\nJacksonville NC\nLaredo\nLincoln\nLos Angeles\nMcAllen\nMiami\nOdessa\nSource: Share of adult high school dropouts in 2000 is from the 2000 Census, and share of\nadult high school dropouts in 1940 is from Haines, M.R., ICPSR study number 2896. Historical,\nFIGURE 3: Relationship Between Share of Adult HS Dropouts, 2000 and\nHigh July temperatures are associated with fewer college graduates, but even\nthis effect is quite modest. July temperatures can explain only 6.5 percent of\nthe variation in the share of the population with college degrees.\nvide theory and evidence supporting the view that less skilled people live in\nthe centers of metropolitan areas because of access to public transportation.\nCars are expensive, and poorer people prefer the time-intensive, lower-cost al-\nternative of buses and subways. Can access to public transportation explain\nthe location of less skilled people across areas? No. There is virtually no corre-\nlation across metropolitan areas between the share of the population without\nhigh school degrees and the share of the population that takes public trans-\nportation. This absence of correlation is particularly surprising since the poor\ngenerally take public transit more, which would yield a positive relationship\nbetween less skilled people and public transit, even if the poor didn't move\nacross metropolitan areas in response to public transit access.\nAlternatively, people of different skill levels may be drawn to particu-\nlar areas because of skill-specific economic opportunities. Silicon Valley has a\nbooming computer industry, and it attracts extremely highly skilled engineers.\nNew York City attracts smart people to work in finance. Certainly, there is a\nstrong correlation between the skill level of an area and the skill orientation of\nranked industries by the share of the workers in that industry in the nation\nwith a college degree. They then calculated the share of a metropolitan area's\nemployment that was in the top 25 percent industries ranked by human capital\nand in the bottom 25 percent of industries ranked by human capital.\nThere is a 79 percent correlation between this measure of high-skilled in-\ndustries and the share of the population with college degrees, and a 49 percent\ncorrelation between the share of the adult population without a college degree\nand the measure of low-skill industries. Certainly, there is a robust relationship\nbetween the skill orientation of the industries in an area and the skill distribu-\ntion of the area. But which way does the causality run? Are skilled industries\nmoving into an area because there are an abundance of skilled workers, or are\nskilled workers moving to areas because of skill-oriented industries?\nWhile surely both phenomena occur, we think that the evidence supports\nthe view that industries are responding to the area's skill distribution more\nthan the view that the skill distribution is responding to the area's industries\nmix. For example, the share of the population with college degrees in 1940\ncan explain 35 percent of the variation in the skill mix of industries today. By\ncontrast, the skill composition of the industries in the metropolitan area in\n1980 can only explain 7 percent of the variation in growth of the population\nwith college degrees since that date. The complex two-sided nature of this\nrelationship makes it difficult to accurately assess the direction of causality,\nbut there are reasons to think that much of the industrial mix in the area is\nactually responding to the skill distribution.\nOne variable that seems more plausibly predetermined is the concentra-\ntion in manufacturing during the first half of the 20th century. The location\nof factories does not seem likely to be particularly driven by the presence of\nhighly skilled workers 100 years ago. Yet an industrial orientation, as late\nas 1950, is negatively correlated with the share of the population with col-\nlege degrees today, perhaps because those manufacturing cities tended not to\nreinvent themselves as centers of idea-oriented industries or perhaps because\nmanufacturing employers were less disposed toward high schools earlier in the\ncentury (Goldin and Katz, 2008). As the share of the workforce in manufactur-\ning in 1950 increases by 10 percent, the share of the population with college\ndegrees drops by about 1 percent. This may explain why, as shown in Table 2,\nRegression (7), manufacturing in 1950 is negatively associated with inequality\ntoday.\nThese industrial measures are essentially proxies for differential returns\nto human capital across metropolitan areas. Using wage regressions, we are\nable to estimate such differential returns directly by running regressions of the\nform\nLog(Wage) = MSA\n+ BA\nMSA\n BAGrad + HS\nMSA\n HSGrad + OtherControls,\nAnn Arbor\nBakersfield\nBaton Rouge\nGary\nHouston\nLas Vegas\nMcAllen\nMiami\nMobile\nNew Haven\nNew York\nRaleigh\nRiverside\nSalt Lake City\nSan Francisco\nSan Jose\nSeattle\nStockton\nTacoma\nWashington DC\nSource: Data is calculated using the 5 percent Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)\nFIGURE 4: Returns to College and the Percentage of Residents with College\nwhere MSA\nis an area-specific intercept, BA\nMSA\nis an area-specific return to\nhaving a college degree and HS\nMSA\nis an area-specific return to having a high\nschool diploma. This regression estimates a differential return to different\nlevels of schooling for each metropolitan area. We estimate this regression only\nfor prime age males, and include controls for experience. As we control for a\nmetropolitan area-fixed effect, we do not also control for area-level controls,\nnot do we interact any area-level characteristics with the education variables,\nsince we are estimating a distinct return to education for each metropolitan\narea. In a second stage, we will then correlate these estimated coefficients with\narea-level controls, such as education and density. We focus only on those areas\nwith more than 500,000 people so that the returns to schooling are estimated\nwith reasonable precision.\nFigure 4 shows the 24 percent correlation between our estimate of BA\nMSA\nand\nthe share of the adult population with college degrees in the 102 metropolitan\nareas in our sample with more than 500,000 people.6 One interpretation of\nthis fact is that skilled people are moving to places where the skill levels are\n6We also examined the correlation between this estimated coefficient and the logarithm of\narea density. We found that the coefficient was slightly stronger in dense areas, but that controlling\nhigher. A second interpretation is that agglomerations of skilled people raise\nthe returns to skill. Any interpretation of this relationship is compromised\nfurther by the fact that an abundance of skilled people would normally reduce\nthe returns to skill in a typical model of labor demand. Still, this does suggest\nthat highly skilled people are living in places where the returns to skill are\nhigher.\nDifferential Returns to Human Capital\nThe fact that the returns to human capital differ across space can also\npotentially explain the inequality that we see across metropolitan areas. As\nthe formula discussed above illustrates, pretax income inequality will reflect\nboth differences in the distribution of skills and differences in the returns to\nthose skills. Certainly, the framework predicts a strong link between places\nwith higher returns to college and income inequality.\nThere is a 73 percent correlation between our estimated return to a college\npeople. The measured return to a college degree is much better at explaining\narea inequality than the number of people with college degrees. Of course,\nthese returns are directly based on the same income data that are being used\nto generate the Gini coefficient. Still, this finding seems to confirm the view that\nheterogeneity in returns to skill can help us to explain differences in income\ninequality across space.\nTo look at this further, we again calculate Gini coefficients for each\nmetropolitan area using wage regressions. However, in this case, we allow\nthe coefficients on skills to differ across metropolitan areas as shown in\nequation (1) above. We again run these regressions only for prime-aged males.\nWe then use these regressions to predict the amount of inequality in an area if\nthe skill distribution of the area were the same as the skill distribution in the\ncountry as a whole. When we calculated Gini coefficients using wage regres-\nsions above, we were calculating local Gini coefficients based only on differences\nin the skill composition, holding the returns to skill constant across space. Now,\nwe calculate Gini coefficients holding the skill composition constant, but allow-\ning the returns to skill to differ across space.\nFigure 5 shows the 71 percent correlation between these predicted wage\nGini coefficients and actual Gini coefficients in our sample of prime-age males\nacross metropolitan areas with more than 500,000 people. The relationship is\ntighter than it was when we looked at Gini coefficients that assumed a constant\nreturn to skill. Moreover, this Gini coefficient holding the skill composition\nconstant explains 50 percent of the variation in the actual Gini coefficient,\nwhereas our constant return to skills Gini explained only 33 percent of the\ndifference. We interpret these results as suggesting that differential measured\nreturns to human capital can explain area-level income inequality somewhat\nfor density did little to the estimated relationship between this coefficient and the share of the\npopulation with college degrees.\nBoston\nFresno Houston\nJersey City\nLas Vegas\nLos Angeles\nMcAllen\nMiami\nNew Haven\nNew York\nOrange County\nRaleigh\nRiverside\nSan Francisco\nSan Jose\nSeattle\nTacoma\nWashington DC\nYoungstown\nGini Coeff.

As in Combes, Duranton,\nand Gobillon (2008), \"sorting matters,\" but so do differences in the returns to\nskill.\nOne potential concern with interpreting these results is that measured\nreturns to human capital may not be measuring higher returns to human\ncapital, but instead measuring high levels of true human capital associated\nwith each coarse category of observed human capital. For example, if people\nwith college degrees in some areas went to higher quality schools or have had\nbetter work experience, then this would cause the measured return to a college\neducation to increase, even if the true returns to human capital were constant\nacross space. We have no way of dealing with this hypothesis, and we will\ncontinue referring to the measured returns to human capital as the returns to\nhuman capital, understanding that it can also reflect other things.\nWhile differences in the returns to skill do seem to explain a significant\namount of the differences in inequality, we do not know what explains differ-\nences in returns to skill across space. For example, the positive correlation\nbetween the share of the population with college degrees and returns to skill\nmight suggest that being around other skilled people increases the returns\nto being skilled. Alternatively, Beaudry, Doms, and Lewis (2006) suggest that\nplaces with abundant skilled workers invested in computerization, which then\nhad the effect of raising the returns to skill. While we are certainly sympa-\nthetic to these interpretations, it is hard to distinguish between this view and\nthe view that more skilled people are moving to areas where the returns to\nskill are higher.\nMoreover, the share of the population with college degrees in 1940 does\nlittle to explain the returns to college today. If we thought that higher returns to\nskill reflected the power of agglomerations of skilled people, then an abundance\nof skills in 1940, which predicts skills today, should also predict higher returns\nto college today. This is not the case, as we find only a 5 percent correlation\nbetween the share of the population with a college degree in 1940 and our\nmeasure of the return to a college degree. Instead, a higher return to college\ntoday is strongly associated with recent growth in the share of the population\nwith college degrees. The correlation between our return to college measure\nand the change in the proportion of the adult population with college degrees\nis 26 percent. These facts support the idea that skilled people are moving to\nareas where the returns to skill are higher.\nOther variables also do a relatively poor job of explaining the returns to\nskill. For example, our measure of skill-intensive industries does not explain the\nreturns to skills. The places with the highest returns to skill are usual suspects.\nThe financial agglomeration in Southwestern Connecticut and the technology\nagglomeration in San Francisco Bay have very high returns to human capital.\nBut there are also areas, like Houston and Birmingham that are more of a\nsurprise.7\nWe calculate a 34 percent correlation between our estimated returns to\ncollege and the share of workers in finance among the 102 cities in our sample\nreturns to college and the share of workers in the computer industry among\nthe same sample of cities, again lending support to the results of Beaudry\net al. (2006) show a link between computerization and inequality.9 A related\nand interesting hypothesis is that wage inequality is linked to the former\nconcentration of low-skilled workers in routine tasks that have now been made\nStill, we are much more confident that differences in the returns to skill\ncan explain a significant amount of income inequality across metropolitan areas\nthan we are in explaining why areas have such different returns to human capi-\ntal. A number of recent papers,like Autor and Dorn (2007); Black, Kolesnikova,\nto this question, but it remains a pressing topic for future research.\n7Like Black, Kolesnikova, and Taylor (2007), we find a modest positive relationship between\ncost of living and returns to college.\n8\"Finance\" is defined using IPUMS 2000 Occupation Codes for the 5 percent sample at\n9\"Computers\" is also defined using IPUMS 2000 Occupation Codes for the 5 percent sample\nAt the national level, income inequality has been linked to low levels of\neconomic growth, perhaps because inequality leads to political strife (Alesina\nnot the same thing as national inequality. No one should be surprised if the\npolitical and economic effects of inequality are different at the local level. After\nall, local political outcomes are far more constrained by state constitutions and\neasy outmigration.\nMore generally, local inequality, as opposed to local poverty, is not necessar-\nily a bad thing. If people of different income levels mix throughout the country,\nthen local inequality will be higher than if people segregate into homogenous,\nstratified communities. A large number of studies suggest economic mixing,\ni.e., local inequality, benefits the less fortunate by giving them more successful\nsuggest that the wealthy develop empathy for the poor through spatial prox-\nimity (Glaeser, 2000). Egalitarians can simultaneously hope for policies that\nwould reduce inequality at the national level, such as increasing the schooling\nlevels for the least fortunate, while opposing policies that would reduce local\nincome inequality by moving rich people away from poor people.\nPersson and Tabellini (1994) found a strong negative relationship between\nnational income inequality and economic growth. Some facts about urban\ngrowth are quite similar to facts about country growth. For example, schooling\npredicts growth at both the country and the city level. Does the connection\nbetween inequality and growth carry over to the metropolitan level?\nIn Table 4, we look at the relationship between inequality and growth\nacross our sample of metropolitan areas. We use 1980 as our start date and look\nat the growth of both income and population after that year. While country-level\nregressions typically look only at income growth, city-level growth regressions\nlook at population and income (and sometimes housing values as well), since\nincreases in productivity should show up both in higher wages and in more\npeople moving to an area.\nThe first regression of Table 4 shows that the raw relationship between\nincome inequality and local area growth is positive. Places with more inequality\nhave been gaining population. However, as the second regression in Table 4\nshows, this result is not robust to including a number of other city-level controls,\nsuch as human capital variables and January temperature. With these controls,\ninequality has a significant negative effect on area population growth. The next\ntwo regressions in Table 4 show the relationship between inequality and area\nincome growth. After including area-level controls, inequality has a significant\nnegative impact on income growth. The coefficients here should be interpreted\nwhile keeping in mind the relatively low level of variation in the 1980 Gini\nvariable. Going all the way from the bottom of the inequality distribution at\n0.33, to the top of the distribution at 0.45, would cause population growth to\nfall by about 1 standard deviation.\nTABLE 4: Consequences of Urban Inequality\nincome)\nwith BA\nwith HS\nNotes: Standard errors in brackets. Significant at 5 percent, significant at 1 percent.\nSource: The Gini coefficient for 1980 is calculated using the 5 percent Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) for 1980, at\nusa.ipums.org. Other 1980 variables are from the 1980 Census. January temperatures are from the 1994 County and City Data Book from\nthe U.S. Census.\nThese results do suggest that income inequality is only negatively corre-\nlated with area growth once we control for skills. Increases in the skill dis-\ntribution that make a place more unequal by increasing the share of highly\neducated citizens are associated with increased, not decreased, growth. How-\never, growth of both income and population was lower in places where the\nincome distribution is particularly unequal, holding skills constant.\nA second adverse consequence of inequality at the country level is the\nconnection between inequality and crime (Fajnzylber et al., 2002). These results\nhave also been found at the metropolitan area level (Daly et al., 2001). We\nduplicate them here.\nIn regression (5) of Table 4, we show the strong positive relationship be-\ntween income inequality and murder rates across metropolitan areas. We focus\non murder rates because they are the most serious crime outcome and the\noutcome that is least likely to be impacted by reporting differences across ar-\neas. There is a 35 percent correlation between homicide rates and the Gini\ncoefficient across metropolitan areas. Regression (6) of Table 4 shows that the\ninequality\u00adcrime relationship is robust to a number of other controls.\nWhy do murder rates increase with inequality? One view is that inequality\nis just proxying for poverty, but both at the country and city level, the impact\nof inequality on crime survives controls for the mean income level and the\npoverty rate. A second explanation is that inequality leads to less focus on\nproviding community-wide public goods, like policing. A third explanation is\nthat inequality breeds resentment, which then shows up in higher murder\nrates.\nAll of these explanations remain speculation, but there is some evidence\nthat links unhappiness to envying richer neighbors. Luttmer (2005) looks at\nthe self-reported happiness of individuals as a function of the wealth of their\nneighbors. He finds that people who have richer peers are more likely to say\nthat they are unhappy. The existence of envy can, under some conditions, sug-\ngest that sorting by income is preferable to highly unequal areas.10 Luttmer's\nevidence suggests the importance of thinking about inequality at the local\nlevel.\nWe find a -47 percent correlation between the Gini coefficient and the av-\nerage self-reported happiness in the metropolitan area taken from the General\nSocial Survey. These happiness data span the last 25 years, and they represent\nthe share of people who say that they are very happy. Inequality can explain\n22 percent of the variation in this unhappiness measure, and this result is\nrobust to a reasonable number of other controls such as average area income\nand population size.\n10We have also looked at whether there is a correlation between income inequality and racial\nsegregation, using dissimilarity measures of segregation (see Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor, 1999 for\ndetails of the measure). We find no evidence of any such connection.\nWhile the primary theme of this paper is that inequality should be studied\nat the local as well as at the national level, there are good reasons to think that\nnational governments are better suited toward addressing the problems of\ninequality than local governments. A long tradition of urban analysis suggests\nthat localities have a very limited ability to make society more equal (Peterson,\n1981). The ability of wealthy people to flee is just too great.\nInequality differs greatly across nations and much of that heterogeneity\nhas been associated with different national policies (Glaeser, 2005). For exam-\nple, many European countries have set up welfare states that engage in much\nmore redistribution than the United States (Alesina and Glaeser, 2004). If the\nnational government takes money from the rich and gives it to the poor, then\ninequality will fall. The costs of such policies, reduced effort and savings and\ninnovation, may make redistribution unattractive, but there is no question that\nnations are capable of significantly reducing inequality.\nLocalities, however, face a far more mobile tax base. When a city raises the\nlocal tax rate in order to pay for a local welfare state, then the rich can flee.\nGenerous welfare payments will attract the poor. At the extreme, attempts\nby cities to run local welfare states can actually reduce the local resources\navailable to the poor by increasing the segregation of rich and poor. Of course,\nmobility is not perfect and places do manage to redistribute something locally,\nyet their ability to engage in redistribution is certainly limited by free migration\nacross cities.\nMany economics papers have documented that the poor move in response to\ngenerous local welfare policies. Borjas (1999) shows that more generous welfare\npolicies across states attracted less skilled immigrants, especially to California.\nBlank (1988) finds that generous welfare payments impact the location decision\nof unmarried women with children. East St. Louis, which is within the St.\nLouis metropolitan area, but which sits on the more generous Illinois side of\nthe Mississippi river is something of a natural experiment. The city has long\nbeen one of the poorest areas in the United States, which illustrates the ability\nof generous welfare payments to attract the poor.\nThere is also evidence that the rich respond to local tax rates and pub-\nlic goods that cater to their own interests. In many American metropolitan\nareas, the rich have fled central cities and moved to suburbs that have less\nredistribution and better schools. Haughwout et al. (2004) argue that cities can\nactually lose revenue by raising taxes because the rich find it so easy to emi-\ngrate. Similarly, Feldstein and Wrobel (1998) find that states cannot effectively\nredistribute income at all because of the mobility of the rich.\nThis evidence does not imply that localities can not reduce inequality,\nbut instead that localities cannot reduce inequality by redistributing income.\nLocalities can reduce income inequality by inducing the rich to leave. This can\nresult in a more homogenous community, albeit one that is much poorer. Of\ncourse, few places would actually want to increase equality by driving away\ntheir richest taxpayers. This emigration could in fact hurt the poorest people\nin the city by reducing employment opportunities.\nLocalities can also impact redistribution through education policy. How-\never, some investments in education may well increase local inequality. When\nwe regress the area Gini coefficient on Moretti's (2004) land-grant college vari-\nable, we find that inequality is higher in places with a land-grant college,\ncontrolling for area population, income, and the share of adults who are high\nschool dropouts. This effect disappears when we control for share of adults with\ncollege degrees, which implies that this variable (weakly) increases inequality\nbecause it increases the share of more skilled people.\nPresumably, reducing local inequality requires investing disproportion-\nately in schools that cater to the less fortunate. We find a modest negative re-\nlationship between current high school enrollment rates and inequality when\nwe control for area income and area population. This result may reflect the\ntendency of poverty to lead to low enrollment rates or the tendency of middle\nincome people to move to areas with fewer dropouts or the ability of high school\ngraduation to reduce inequality. We will not try to distinguish these hypotheses\nbut just point out that correlations of this form suggest that education policy\ncan surely impact inequality, both by its direct effect on the skill distribution\nand by shifting migration patterns.\nWhile it might be beneficial to reduce inequality by improving the educa-\ntion of the less fortunate, local governments have again only a limited ability to\nmake the nationwide skill distribution more equal. Areas with many poor par-\nents have fewer resources with which to educate their children. These places\nnot only have lower tax revenues, holding everything else constant, but they\nalso have less parental human capital on which to draw. The long-noted power\nof peers means that places with lower initial skill distributions inevitably have\ndifficulty creating first-rate public schools.\nFinally, even if one accepts egalitarian ideas that inequality is itself a\nbad thing, it certainly does not follow that reducing local inequality is clearly\ndesirable, if national inequality were kept constant. Would it be sensible for\nnational government policies to artificially segregate rich people into some\ncities and poor people into others? Such segregationist policies would increase\nequality at the lower level, but it is hard to see how they would increase\nlocal welfare levels. Some of our regressions have suggested that localities will\ngrow more quickly and have less crime if they are more equal, but even these\nresults must be treated gingerly. National policies that created equality by\nremoving high-skill, high-earnings workers from power areas would also be\nlikely to reduce the economic performance of those areas. Policies that reduce\nthe numbers of poor people by eliminating urban attributes that attract those\npeople, like low-cost housing, would also have negative consequences, most\nnotably the destruction of a valuable asset that is providing some benefit for\nthe least fortunate members of society.\nThe bulk of the research on inequality has focused on inequality at the\nnation level. Yet most people live in cities and their experience of inequality\nis shaped by their local environment. This fact implies the need to research\ninequality in cities as well as inequality in countries.\nIn this essay, we have reviewed the economic causes of metropolitan-area\nincome inequality. Differences in income inequality across areas can be ex-\nplained well by both differences in the skill distribution and differences in the\nreturns to skill. If anything, differences in the returns to skill appear to be more\nimportant in explaining the variation in the Gini coefficient across American\nmetropolitan areas. Differences in the skill distribution can be well explained\nby historical tendencies toward having more skilled people and by immigration\npatterns. Differences in the returns to skill are far more difficult to explain,\nbut today the returns to a college degree are highest in areas that specialize in\nfinance or computing.\nThere are some negative correlates of area-level inequality. More un-\nequal places have higher murder rates, and people say that they are less\nhappy. Though the raw correlation between area-level inequality and popula-\ntion growth is positive, more unequal places grow more slowly once we control\nfor the skill distribution in an area.\nArea-level income inequality does not create the same policy implications\nas national income inequality. At the nation level, an egalitarian, Rawlsian\nsocial welfare function implies the need to reduce income inequality. However,\negalitarianism does not provide the same implications about local inequality.\nShuffling people across the country in a way that creates more homogeneity at\nthe local level would not seem like a natural means of increasing social welfare\ngiven standard social welfare functions. Instead, such functions would instead\npush toward a focus on policies like human capital development that would\npromote equality nationwide.\nREFERENCES\nAlesina, A. and E.L. Glaeser. 2004.
