We offer a model in which a bank issues covered bonds backed by a pool of\nassets that is bankruptcy remote and replenished following losses.

Despite their longevity as a financial instrument, there has been no\ntheoretical analysis of covered bonds.

A bank issues covered bonds\nby ring-fencing, or encumbering, high-quality assets into a bankruptcy-remote cover-pool,\nwhich remains on the balance sheet. The cover pool is also dynamically replenished --\nnon-performing asset are replaced with performing ones of equivalent value and quality\nto maintain the requisite collateralization. Covered bond holders are also protected by\ndual recourse. If the value of the cover pool is insufficient to meet repayments, they have\nclaims to the unencumbered assets of an equal seniority to unsecured creditors.\nResults\nThese institutional features make covered bonds safe assets for investors and a cheap\nsource of funding for banks. At the same time, they asymmetrically shift risks onto un-\nsecured creditors, which can heighten bank fragility and increase the cost of unsecured\nfunding. We show that a bank's usage of covered bonds balances this trade-off between\nprofitability and fragility, and derive several testable implications about asset encum-\nbrance. We also obtain normative results about covered bond usage in the context of\nguaranteed unsecured debt. Such schemes usually apply to retail deposits, but were also\nextended to unsecured wholesale debt during the global financial crisis. The privately\noptimal level of covered bond usage and bank fragility are excessive because the banker\ndoes not internalize the effect of encumbrance on the cost of providing the guarantee. We\nstudy three forms of regulation aimed at curbing excessive asset encumbrance by banks.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nFragestellung\nObwohl gedeckte Schuldverschreibungen seit dem sp\u00a8\naten 18.

These are claims on orig-\ninating banks, collateralized by a pool of mortgages that remain on the balance sheet.\nThis cover pool is ring-fenced, or encumbered, and therefore is bankruptcy remote. The\ncover pool is also dynamically replenished -- non-performing assets are replaced with per-\nforming ones of equivalent value and quality to maintain the requisite collateralization.1\nThese institutional features incentivize banks to underwrite mortgages carefully, avoiding\nsome of the pitfalls associated with the originate-to-distribute model (Bernanke, 2009;\nKeys, Mukherjee, Seru, and Vig, 2010; Purnanandam, 2011). Indeed, covered bonds are\nperceived as a safe asset by investors, since there are no recorded instances of default\nsince their introduction in the eighteenth century.2\nDespite their longevity as a financial instrument, there has been no theoretical analy-\nsis of covered bonds. Moreover, policymakers have become increasingly concerned about\nthe financial stability implications of the collateralization of bank balance sheets (CGFS,\n2013). In response, several jurisdictions have introduced measures to restrict asset en-\ncumbrance.3 Our paper addresses these issues by offering a positive analysis of how asset\nencumbrance affects bank fragility, and contributes to the normative debate on prudential\nregulation.\nIn our model, a banker seeks funding to finance profitable investment opportunities.\nThe banker has access to secured and unsecured debt markets, each with its own dis-\ntinct investor clienteles. Debt is issued in two stages. First, building on Rochet and\nVives (2004), the banker attracts unsecured debt from risk-neutral investors by offering\ndemandable-debt. The banker invests these proceeds and its own funds. Second, the\nbanker attracts secured debt from infinitely risk-averse investors, reflecting the highly\nrestrictive mandates of pension funds and other large institutional investors. The banker\nissues covered bonds by encumbering, or ring-fencing, a fraction of existing assets into\nthe cover pool that remains on its balance sheet. The cover pool is bankruptcy remote\nand the returns on its assets back the covered bond. The banker invests these additional\nfunds raised from covered bond issuance.\nThe banker is subject to a balance sheet shock that has knock-on effects. First, since\n1Covered bond holders are also protected by dual recourse. If the value of the cover pool is insufficient,\ncovered bond holders have a claim of the shortfall on unencumbered assets that is of equal seniority to\nunsecured creditors. For institutional details on covered bonds, see Schwarcz (2011).\n2Covered bonds have been a cornerstone of bank funding in Europe for over two centuries. They are\nespecially important in Germany, where the Pfandbrief system was established by Frederick the Great\nin 1769 following the Seven Years War, and in Denmark following the Great Fire of Copenhagen in 1795.\n3These comprise limits on encumbrance (Australia, New Zealand), ceilings on the amount of se-\ncured funding by banks (Canada, US), and including encumbrance levels in deposit insurance premiums\n(Canada).\nthe cover pool is dynamically replenished, the banker replaces any non-performing assets\nin the cover pool with performing unencumbered assets. This maintains the value of\nthe cover pool, but at the expense of the remainder of the balance sheet. Second, since\npremature liquidation is costly, the rollover decisions of unsecured creditors constitute a\ncoordination problem that can lead to multiple equilibria (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983). To\nuniquely pin down behavior, we use a global games approach (Carlsson and van Damme,\nthe balance sheet shock informs the decision on whether to roll over unsecured debt. An\nunsecured debt run occurs if and only if the balance sheet shock is sufficiently high relative\nto the value of unencumbered assets. We link the incidence of ex-post runs to the banker's\nex-ante issuance of covered bonds, and also solve for the unique face values of secured and\nunsecured debt.4\nOur analysis suggests that covered bonds may not be the panacea that the proponents\nof such instruments might hope for. We highlight two opposing balance sheet effects\nof asset encumbrance and covered bond issuance. The first is a bank funding channel:\ngreater covered bond issuance allows the banker to make additional profitable investments,\nwhich increases the expected equity value and reduces the potential for a run. The\nsecond is a risk-concentration channel: as more bonds are issued, the balance sheet shock\nis asymmetrically concentrated on unsecured creditors, exacerbating rollover risk and\nincreasing the incidence of an unsecured debt run. The optimal level of asset encumbrance\nbalances these two effects.\nCovered bonds are safe assets for risk-averse investors and a stable and cheap source of\nbank funding. These results stem from two institutional features. The first feature is the\nreplenishment of cover pool assets that protects covered bond holders from the balance\nsheet shock. The second feature is the bankruptcy-remoteness of the cover pool, whereby\ncovered bond holders do not suffer a dilution of their claims in bankruptcy.5 At the same\ntime, these features make unsecured debt more risky. Risk-neutral investors who hold\nunsecured debt suffer the full extent of the balance sheet shock, and can only lay claim to\nunencumbered assets in bankruptcy. As a result, bank fragility and the cost of unsecured\ndebt are higher.\nWe study the normative implications of asset encumbrance when a proportion of un-\nsecured debt is guaranteed. Such schemes usually apply to retail deposits, but were\nalso extended to unsecured wholesale debt during the global financial crisis.6 Assuming\na deep-pocketed guarantor, a guarantee reduces both the rollover risk and the cost of\nunsecured funding, since the guarantor pays in bankruptcy. As a result, the privately\noptimal amount of encumbrance increases in the coverage of the guarantee. However, by\nencumbering assets, the banker shifts risks to the guarantor. Since the banker does not\n4Our approach sidesteps Modigliani and Miller (1958). Costly liquidation of investment drives a wedge\nbetween debt and equity, and we assume that secured and unsecured debt markets are segmented.\n5We also show that dual recourse is never called upon in equilibrium, since infinitely risk-averse\ninvestors evaluate holding a covered bond at the largest possible balance sheet shock. This result is\nconsistent with the finding of Wandschneider (2014), who notes that dual recourse has never been called\nupon in practice.\n6Between 2007 and 2011, many countries enacted special arrangements for banks to have new and ex-\nisting wholesale bank funding guaranteed by the government until market conditions normalized. Recent\nanalyses of the interplay between government guarantees and financial stability include K\u00a8\nonig, Anand,\ninternalize the impact of encumbrance on the cost of the guarantee, the privately optimal\nlevels of encumbrance and bank fragility are excessive. The extent of these excesses in-\ncreases in guarantee coverage and in the dead-weight loss of raising the funds that back\nthe guarantee (for instance, distortionary taxes).\nOur welfare criterion is constrained efficiency. A social planner chooses the amount of\nasset encumbrance that maximizes the expected payoffs net of the expected cost of the\nguarantee, taking the rollover risk of unsecured debt and the face values of guaranteed\nand non-guaranteed unsecured debt as given. We study three tools of prudential regu-\nlation, namely: (i) a limit on asset encumbrance; (ii) a minimum capital requirement;\nand (iii) a surcharge for asset encumbrance that is paid to a deposit insurance fund or\nas a contribution to a bailout fund. Several jurisdictions introduced regulations aimed at\ncurbing excessive encumbrance -- for example, limits on encumbrance in Australia and\nNew Zealand, ceilings on the amount of secured funding in Canada and the United States,\nand an inclusion of encumbrance levels in deposit insurance premiums in Canada.\nOur results suggest that imposing either a limit on encumbrance or a minimum capi-\ntal requirement will induce the banker to choose the constrained efficient level of encum-\nbrance, which induces the constrained efficient level of fragility. The unweighted capital\nratio is given by the banker's own funds divided by total assets. A minimum capital ratio\neffectively limits the amount of secured-debt-funded investment, because more encum-\nbrance lowers the capital ratio. Therefore, a floor on the capital ratio effectively becomes\na bound on encumbrance. Finally, a surcharge for encumbrance reduces unencumbered\nassets and increases fragility, which induces the banker to reduce the level of encumbrance.\nHowever, if the surcharge schedule is continuous, the banker still pays a positive surcharge\nto encumber the constrained efficient level, which exacerbates fragility. Thus, constrained\nefficiency requires the surcharge schedule to have a large discontinuity at the constrained\nefficient level of encumbrance.\nOur model offers several testable implications about asset encumbrance and the re-\nliance on collateralized funding by banks.7 In line with the trade-off between profitability\nand fragility, higher liquidation values and cheaper unsecured debt reduce the rollover risk\nof unsecured funding, which lowers fragility and thus raises encumbrance levels. In con-\ntrast, greater conservatism in unsecured debt markets increases fragility and thus reduces\nencumbrance. A lower outside option of investors, perhaps because of lower competition\nor unconventional monetary policy, increases the bank funding channel and encumbrance.\nHigher risks to a bank's balance sheet increase fragility and therefore reduce encum-\nbrance. Under mild conditions on parameters or distributional assumptions about the\nshock, encumbrance levels are higher for better-capitalized banks and for more-profitable\ninvestments.\nAlthough we focus on covered bonds, our analysis is also relevant to other forms of\nsecured funding. Central to our model is the interaction between the rollover risk of\nunsecured debt, the bankruptcy-remoteness of the cover pool, and the replenishment of\n7The existing literature on covered bonds is empirical. Carbo-Valverde, Rosen, and Rodriguez-\nFernandez (2011) examine the extent to which covered bonds are a substitute for mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Prokopczuk and Vonhoff (2012) and Prokopczuk, Siewert, and Vonhoff (2013) study how\nmarket liquidity and asset quality affect the pricing of covered bonds. Beirne, Dalitz, Ejsing, Grothe,\nManganelli, Monar, Sahel, Susec, Tapking, and Vong (2011) empirically examine the effectiveness of the\nissuance of various bonds by European banks.\nassets backing secured debt. A similar interaction may be found for term repos, where safe\nharbor arrangements ensure the bankruptcy-remoteness of collateral (Goralnik, 2012), and\nthe replenishment of asset pool occurs via the creditor's right to ask for a substitution\nof collateral or via variation margins. Credit card asset-backed securities also feature\nbankruptcy-remoteness and the replenishment of asset pools (Furletti, 2002).\nAn important contribution to the literature on bank funding is Greenbaum and Thakor\n(1987). They study the choice between deposit funding (on-balance-sheet) versus secu-\nritized funding (off-balance-sheet). Borrowers effectively choose the funding mode by\nsignalling the private information about the quality of their projects. Higher-quality\nprojects are securitized, while lower-quality projects remain on the bank's balance sheet\nand are funded with deposits. Prudential regulation, for example the pricing of deposit\ninsurance premiums and capital requirements, is shown to influence the relative appeal\nof deposit funding.\nMore recent work has begun to examine the interplay between secured and unsecured\nfunding. Gai, Haldane, Kapadia, and Nelson (2013) and Eisenbach, Keister, McAndrews,\nand Yorulmazer (2014) adopt a balance sheet approach to examine the financial stability\nimplications of alternative funding structures. Eisenbach et al. (2014) highlight some of\nthe ex-post balance sheet dynamics associated with asset encumbrance and collateralized\nfunding in the context of exogenous creditor behavior. Using global games techniques to\ndescribe endogenous creditor behavior, Gai et al. (2013) study how a bank's liquidity and\nsolvency risks change with the composition of funding and show how \"dashes for collateral\"\nby short-term secured creditors can occur. In contrast, we explore the additional balance\nsheet dynamics of ex-post replenishment of the asset pool, endogenize the banker's ex-\nante encumbrance choice, and determine the cost of secured and unsecured funding. Our\npaper also has points of contact with Matta and Perotti (2015), who study the role played\nby safe harbor provisions for repos in exacerbating funding liquidity risk.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets out the model. Section 3 studies the\nrollover decision of unsecured creditors, and solves for the equilibrium in the secured and\nunsecured funding markets. Section 4 introduces guarantees for unsecured funding and\nstudies the private incentives to shift risk to a guarantor, such as a deposit insurance\nfund. We examine how prudential safeguards can mitigate such risk shifting. Section 5\nconcludes.\nThere are three dates, t = 0, 1, 2, and three agents \u00ad a banker and two segmented clienteles\nof wholesale investors. The banker is risk-neutral and consumes at t = 2. The first\nclientele of mass one is risk-neutral and indifferent between consuming at t = 1 and\nt = 2. By contrast, the second clientele of mass  is infinitely risk-averse and consumes\nat t = 2. This clientele may be thought of as pension funds or other large institutional\ninvestors, reflecting their mandates for high-quality and safe assets. All investors have a\nunit endowment at t = 0 and access to safe storage that yields r  1 at t = 2.\nAt t = 0, the banker has its own funds E0\nand seeks additional funding from investors\nto finance profitable and high-quality investments. Each investment matures at t = 2\nand its return is R > r. As in Diamond and Rajan (2001), the sale of investments yields\na fraction   (0, 1) of the return at maturity, where R < r. This cost reflects effi-\nciency losses as asset ownership is transferred from skilled bankers to relatively unskilled\ninvestors.\nThere are two rounds of funding at t = 0. In the first, the unsecured funding round,\nrisk-neutral investors place their endowment with the banker to receive a demandable debt\nclaim as in Rochet and Vives (2004). Unsecured debt, D0\n 1, can be withdrawn at t = 1\nor rolled over until t = 2. This rollover decision is taken by a group of professional fund\nmanagers, indexed by i  [0, 1]. They face strategic complementarity in their decisions,\nwhereby an individual manager's incentive to roll over increases in the proportion of\nmanagers who roll over. The relative cost to managers of rolling over, 0 <  < 1, plays\nan important role in this decision.8 The higher  is, the more conservative managers are,\nand the less likely that unsecured debt is rolled over. The face value of unsecured debt\nis independent of the withdrawal date, Du\n R. The banker invests the proceeds and its\nown funds.\nIn the second round, the secured funding round, the banker can attract covered bond\nfunding from risk-averse investors by pledging high-quality assets. Specifically, the banker\nencumbers, or ring-fences, a fraction 0    1 of existing assets and places them in the\ncover pool \u00ad a bankruptcy remote vehicle on the bank's balance sheet. The level of asset\nencumbrance is publicly observed at t = 1. We denote by B0\n 0 the total amount of\ncovered bond funding raised, and by Db\n R the face value of a covered bond at t = 2.\nTable 1 shows the bank's balance sheet at t = 0, once all wholesale funding is raised and\nthe investment is made.\nAssets Liabilities\n(cover pool) (1 + E0\n(unencumbered assets) (1 - )(1 + E0\nTable 1: Balance sheet at t = 0\nA defining feature of covered bonds is the dynamic replenishment of the cover pool\nafter an adverse shock. Replenishment requires the banker to maintain the value of the\ncover pool at all dates, replacing non-performing assets in the cover pool with performing\nunencumbered assets. Covered bond holders are thus protected and effectively become\nsenior debt holders. But replenishment is detrimental to unsecured debt holders, since\nthe entire shock is concentrated on them. We suppose that the balance sheet of the bank\nis subject to a shock S  0 at t = 2. The shock has a continuous probability density\nfunction f(S) > 0 and a cumulative distribution function F(S), where f (S)  0, so that\nsmall shocks are more likely than larges ones. The banker observes the shock at t = 1 and\nreplenishes the cover pool. Table 2 shows the balance sheet at t = 2 for a small shock,\nS > 0, when all unsecured debt is rolled over at t = 1. The value of bank equity at t = 2\nis denoted by E(S).\n8Rochet and Vives (2004) argue that the decisions of managers are governed by their compensation.\nIn the case of a bankruptcy, a manager's relative compensation from rolling over is negative, -c < 0.\nOtherwise, the relative compensation is positive, b > 0. The conservativeness   c\nb+c\nsummarizes these\nparameters.\nAssets Liabilities\n(cover pool) R(1 + E0\nDb\n(unencumbered assets) R (1 - )(1 + E0\n- S Du\nE(S)\nTable 2: Balance sheet at t = 2 after a small shock\nAnother important feature of covered bonds is dual recourse. Under bankruptcy, the\nbank is closed and covered bond holders receive the market value of the cover pool,\n), at t = 2. If, however, this is insufficient to meet their claims, worth Db\nin total, then each covered bond holder has a claim on the bank's unencumbered assets\nfor the residual amount, Db\n, at t = 2, with equal seniority to unsecured debt\nholders.\nIf a proportion  [0, 1] of unsecured debt is not rolled over at t = 1, the banker\nsells an amount Du\nR\nin order to meet withdrawals. Owing to partial liquidation and the\nbalance sheet shock, the value of unencumbered assets at the final date is R (1 - )(1 +\n- Du\nR\n- Du\n\n- S. Since the banker must service\nthe remaining proportion (1 - ) of unsecured debt, with face value Du\n, along with the\nresidual claims of covered bond holders, as required by dual recourse, bankruptcy occurs\nat t = 2 if\n- S -\nDu\n\n< (1 - )Du\n+ Db\nIf the shock were common knowledge, the rollover behavior of fund managers would\nbe characterized by multiple equilibria, as illustrated in Figure 1.

We assume that the banker\nis well-capitalized, E0\n, so no run occurs absent a shock, S > 0. Likewise,\nif = 0, bankruptcy occurs whenever the shock is larger than an upper bound S \nDb\n) - Du\n. For S > S, it is a dominant\nstrategy for fund managers not to roll over. Since 0 < S < S <  for any funding\nchoices, both dominance regions are well defined.\n- Shock S\nLiquid Liquid / Bankrupt Bankrupt\nRoll over Multiple equilibria Withdraw\nFigure 1: Tripartite classification of the shock\nUnlike the banker, wholesale investors cannot observe the shock before it materializes.\nHowever, fund managers receive a noisy private signal, xi\n, about the shock at t = 1 upon\nwhich they base their rollover decisions. Specifically, they receive the signal xi\n S + i\n,\nwhere i\nis idiosyncratic noise drawn from a continuous distribution G with support [- , ],\nfor > 0. The idiosyncratic noise is independent of the shock and is independently and\nidentically distributed across fund managers. Such incomplete information facilitates a\nunique solution to the coordination game between fund managers (Morris and Shin, 2003).\nTable 3 summarizes the timeline of events.\n1.

We start by analyzing the rollover decisions of fund\nmanagers at t = 1, for a given amount and face value of funding and level of asset encum-\nbrance. Next, we study the optimal choices of the banker at t = 0. In the secured funding\nround, the banker chooses the amount of covered bond funding, B0\n, the level of asset\nencumbrance, , and the face value of covered bonds, Db\n, to maximize the expected value\nof bank equity, subject to the participation constraint of infinitely risk-averse investors.\nIn the unsecured funding round, the banker chooses the face value of unsecured funding,\nDu\n, to maximize the expected value of equity, subject to the participation constraint of\nrisk-neutral investors.\n3.1 Rollover risk of unsecured debt\nUnder imperfect information about the shock, there is a unique Bayesian equilibrium in\neach unsecured debt rollover subgame at t = 1 summarized in Proposition 1. In what\nfollows, we consider the limit case of vanishing private noise,  0.\nProposition 1. Bankruptcy threshold. There exists a unique Bayesian equilibrium\nin each unsecured debt rollover subgame. It is characterized by a bankruptcy threshold\n) - Du\nDb\n)  S , S , (2)\n\n\n. Fund managers roll over unsecured debt if and only\nif S  S such that bankruptcy occurs if and only if S > S.\nProof See Appendix A.\nCoordination failure in the unsecured funding market is measured by -1. It increases\nin the conservativeness of fund managers and decreases in the liquidation value of assets.\nIn the former case, more conservative managers choose to roll over less often and cause\ncostly liquidation. In the latter case, higher liquidation values decrease the strategic\ncomplementarity among fund managers.\nCorollary 1 summarizes the partial impact of funding choices on the bankruptcy thresh-\nold.\nCorollary 1. The bankruptcy threshold S decreases in asset encumbrance and the face\nvalue of secured and unsecured funding but increases in the amount of covered bond fund-\ning:\nS\n\nS\nDb\nS\nDu\nS\n= R-Db\nProof See Appendix A.\nThe intuition is as follows. First, greater asset encumbrance reduces both the amount\nof unencumbered assets available to meet withdrawals by fund managers and the net claim\nof covered bond holders under dual recourse. The overall effect of greater encumbrance\nis that fund managers withdraw deposits for a larger range of shocks. Second, more\ncostly secured funding raises the dual recourse claims of covered bond holders. It induces\nwithdrawals of unsecured debt at t = 1 to prevent a dilution of their claims. Third, more\ncostly unsecured funding exacerbates the degree of strategic complementarity among fund\nmanagers, which induces them to withdraw unsecured debt more often. Fourth, more\nsecured funding increases both the amount of unencumbered assets and the claims of\ncovered bond holders under dual recourse. The former effect dominates since Db\n R.\n3.2 Secured funding and asset encumbrance\nWe derive the banker's objective function in the secured round of funding, taking as\ngiven the face value of unsecured funding. For values of the shock below the bankruptcy\nthreshold, S  S, the equity value is positive and equal to the value of investments net of\nthe shock and total debt repayments to investors, E(S) = R(1+E0\nDb\n-Du\n>\n0. For shocks above the threshold, the value of equity is zero because of limited liability.\nWe derive the participation constraint of infinitely risk-averse investors. The expected\nutility from holding a covered bond is no smaller than the return on storage. Each\ncovered bond has face value Db\n, backed by an equal share of the liquidated cover pool,\n, along with dual recourse on the bank's unencumbered assets in bankruptcy. If\nthe shock wipes out unencumbered assets, S > Smax\n)], bankruptcy\noccurs and dual recourse has zero value. However, covered bonds remain safe because of\nbankruptcy-remoteness.9 Taken together, the banker's problem in the secured funding\n9In general, the value of the covered bond to an infinitely risk-averse investor is\nmin\nS\nDb\n, R\nDb\nDb\n+ (1 - (S))Du\n) - S -\n(S)Du\n\n,\nwhere (S) = IS>S\n.

This result is\nconsistent with Wandschneider (2014), who notes that the dual recourse clause has never\nbeen invoked in the history of covered bonds.\nLemma 1. Bank funding channel. If risk-averse investors are abundant,   , the\nface value of covered bonds is D\nb\n= r and its issuance volume is B\n)z,\nwhere the relative return is z  R r.\nProof See Appendix B.\nLemma 1 states the bank funding channel. Encumbering more assets allows the banker\nto issue more covered bonds. As more secured funding is attracted, the banker expands\nits balance sheet via more investment and increases its expected equity value. By encum-\nbering all existing assets, the banker can, at most, issue   z(1+E0\n) of covered bonds.\nIf the mass of risk-averse investors exceeds , then the total issuance volume is absorbed.\nLemma 2. Risk concentration channel. Encumbering more assets increases fragility:\ndS\nd\n=\nS\n\n+\nS\nB\ndB\nd\nProof See Appendix B.\nLemma 2 states the risk-concentration channel. Issuing covered bonds concentrates\nthe shock on unsecured debt holders. Dynamic replenishment of the cover pool makes\ncovered bonds effectively senior to unsecured debt. While greater asset encumbrance\nleads to more secured funding that increases unencumbered assets, the effect of dynamic\nreplenishment dominates because of over-collateralization. Therefore, the net effect of\ngreater asset encumbrance is a higher incidence of unsecured debt runs on the bank\n(higher bank fragility).\nAs Figure 2 illustrates, the banker's optimal choice of asset encumbrance takes both\nthe bank funding and the risk-concentration channels into account.\nProposition 2. Optimal asset encumbrance. There exists a unique privately optimal\nlevel of asset encumbrance   [0, 1]. There exist unique bounds on investment profitabil-\nity R and R such that the encumbrance level is interior for R < R < R and implicitly\ngiven by:\nF (S ())\nf (S ())\n=\n\nLevel of Asset Encumbrance \nExpected Equity Value \nFigure 2: Expected value of equity as a function of the level of asset encumbrance. In\nbalance sheet shock follows an exponential distribution with rate  = 1.1.\nProof See Appendix C.\nTo obtain an interior solution, we require two conditions. First, the expected profit\nfunction satisfies d\n> 0, whereby the banker is strictly better off encumbering some\nassets. This condition yields the lower bound on asset profitability R. Second, the\nexpected profit function satisfies d\n< 0, whereby the banker is strictly better off\nnot encumbering all assets. This condition yields the upper bound on asset profitability\nR.\nFocusing on the interior solution, Proposition 3 describes how the privately optimal\nlevel of asset encumbrance varies with parameters and the face value of unsecured funding.\nProposition 3. Determinants of asset encumbrance. The privately optimal level of\nasset encumbrance  increases in the liquidation value . It decreases in the conservatism\nof fund managers , the return on storage r, and the face value of unsecured funding Du\n.\nIf the return on storage satisfies r < r, then  increases in initial bank capital E0\nand in\ninvestment profitability R. If the shock distribution F stochastically dominates F according\nto the reverse hazard rate, the corresponding levels of asset encumbrance satisfy   .\nProof See Appendix D.\nThese results highlight the trade-off between profitability and fragility associated with\nasset encumbrance. A higher liquidation value lowers the degree of strategic complemen-\ntarity among fund managers, for any given level of encumbrance. Withdrawals by some\nmanagers, and the resulting liquidation of assets, cause less damage to others. Therefore,\nthe bank is less fragile and bankruptcy occurs for a smaller range of shocks. As a result,\nthe banker encumbers more assets to increase investment and its expected equity value.\nOverall, there are fewer but more-liquid unencumbered assets on the bank's balance sheet.\nBy the same logic, a decrease in the face value of unsecured debt increases the level of\nasset encumbrance.\nAs the degree of conservatism increases, fund managers roll over less often and the\nbank is more fragile, for any given level of encumbrance. The banker responds to height-\nened fragility in a precautionary manner by reducing the level of encumbrance. It forgoes\nprofitable investment via the issuance of covered bonds, in return for more stable unse-\ncured debt. A higher outside option for investors increases the face value of covered bonds\nand correspondingly decreases their issuance volume, which reduces unencumbered assets\nand heightens fragility, for any given level of encumbrance. As before, the banker re-\nsponds by reducing encumbrance. Similarly, a more favorable distribution of the balance\nsheet shock, F, reduces fragility for a given encumbrance level and induces the banker to\nencumber more.\nAn increase in initial bank capital has the following effects. First, greater capital\nallows the banker to scale up its balance sheet, encumber more assets, and issue more\ncovered bonds. Second, greater capital also allows for the absorption of higher losses,\nwhich has two opposing effects. On the one hand, this reduces bank fragility and induces\ngreater asset encumbrance. On the other hand, the expected equity value is lower, which\nreduces encumbrance. If the return on storage is sufficiently low relative to the return on\ninvestment, the bank funding channel is sufficiently strong and the banker unambiguously\nencumbers more assets. Likewise, an increase in investment profitability leads to a similar\nambiguous effect on the privately optimal level of asset encumbrance. The same sufficient\ncondition on the upper bound of the return on storage arises. Tighter predictions on how\nprivate choices of asset encumbrance vary with bank capital and investment profitability\ncan be obtained for specific distributions of the balance sheet shock.\nCorollary 2. Uniform shock distribution. Suppose the shock is uniformly distributed,\n+ )]. If interior, the privately optimal level of asset encumbrance is\n =\n) (z - 1) - ( - 1 +  (z - )) Du\nwhich ambiguously increases in initial bank capital and in investment profitability.\nProof See Appendix D.\n3.3 Unsecured funding\nHaving established the equilibrium in the secured funding round, we turn to the unsecured\nfunding round. We solve for the equilibrium face value of unsecured funding.\nFigure 3 shows how the repayment of unsecured debt depends on the size of the shock.\nIf the bank is solvent, S < S  S(), unsecured debt holders receive the promised\npayment Du\n. For intermediate shocks, they receive an equal share of the liquidated\nunencumbered assets. Investors receive zero by limited liability for a large shock, S >\nS\nmax\n Smax\n)[1-(1-z)]. In sum, for small and intermediate shocks,\nthe unsecured debt claim pays min Du\n,  S\nmax\n- S .\nIn the unsecured funding round, the banker sets the face value of unsecured debt Du\nto\nmaximize its expected value of equity, subject to the participation of risk-neutral investors.\nThe expected equity value decreases in the face value of unsecured debt, d() dDu\n=\n-F(S) - f(S))E(S)) < 0. Hence, the banker chooses the smallest face value\n- Shock S\nmax\nFull Default\nPartial Default\nFull repayment\nFigure 3: The size of the shock determines the payment to unsecured debt holders.\nconsistent with satisfying the participation constraint of risk-neutral investors:\nr = F(S)D\nu\n+ \nS\nmax\nS\n[S\nmax\n- S] dF(S)  V (D\nu\nwhere V (Du\n) is the value of the unsecured debt claim when the face value is Du\n.\nProposition 4. Unsecured funding. There exists a unique face value of unsecured\ndebt, D\nu\n> r, if the investment return is sufficiently low, R  ~\nR, and if investors always\naccept unsecured debt when promised the investment return.\nProof See Appendix E.\nThe first sufficient condition, R  ~\nR, ensures that the value of the debt claim increases\nin the face value of unsecured debt, dV\ndDu\n> 0, so, at most, one solution D\nu\nexists. The\nsecond sufficient condition ensures the existence of D\nu\n. Since V (Du\n= r) < r, a solution\nD\nu\nexists if risk-neutral investors accept unsecured debt when promised the investment\nreturn, V (Du\n= R) > r. Since default occurs with positive probability, the face value is\nD\nu\n> r.\nCorollary 3. Secured funding is cheaper than unsecured funding, D\nb\n= r < D\nu\n.\nCorollary 3 follows immediately from comparing the results of Proposition 4 and\nLemma 1. While dynamic replenishment and bankruptcy-remoteness make covered bonds\na cheap source of funding, these features also make unsecured funding more costly.\nProposition 5. Tail risk and unsecured funding costs. Consider two distributions,\nF and ^\nF. If ^\nF first-order stochastically dominates F in that ^\nF(S) = F(S) for S \n+ ) - r and ^\nF(S) < F(S) for R(1 + E0\n+ ) - r < S < R(1 + E0\n+ ), then\n^\nD\nu\n< D\nu\n.\nProof See Appendix F.\nProposition 5 links tail risk to the face value of unsecured funding. Both distributions,\nF and ^\nF, assign the same probability to small and intermediate shocks, S  R(1+E0\n+)-\nr > S, so the privately optimal encumbrance choice is the same, ^\n = . However,\nthese distributions differ for large shocks, which are less likely under ^\nF than under F\n(lower tail risk). Under ^\nF, unencumbered assets have a higher expected liquidation value\nin bankruptcy, inducing risk-neutral investors to accept a lower face value of unsecured\ndebt.\n4 Public Guarantees\nIn many jurisdictions, unsecured debt holders enjoy the benefits of explicit (or perhaps\nimplicit) public guarantee schemes. Such schemes, which usually apply to retail deposits,\noften extend to unsecured wholesale depositors during times of crisis. But deposit insur-\nance schemes do not typically incorporate the effects of collateralized bank balance sheets.\nA bank with a large deposit base may, therefore, find it optimal to issue secured funding\nin order to shift risks to the deposit guarantee scheme. Guaranteed unsecured debt hold-\ners do not factor in the consequences of increased asset encumbrance and the benefits of\npublic guarantees are externalized. As a result, prudential safeguards are required to limit\nexcessive encumbrance and bank fragility. These safeguards include caps on asset encum-\nbrance (Australia and New Zealand), ceilings on the amount of secured funding (Canada\nand the United States), and the inclusion of encumbrance levels in deposit insurance\npremiums (Canada).\nOur model provides a natural framework with which to examine these normative issues.\nWe focus on the secured funding round at t = 0 and show how prudential safeguards -- a\ncap on asset encumbrance or, equivalently, on covered bond issuance; a surcharge for asset\nencumbrance; and minimum capital requirements -- establish constrained efficiency.\nLet a fraction 0 < m < 1 of unsecured debt be guaranteed and the guarantor (e.g., the\ngovernment) be deep-pocketed. Guaranteed debt holders have no need to withdraw at\nt = 1. If Dg\ndenotes the face value of guaranteed debt, the bankruptcy condition becomes\n-S-\n\n+mDg\n+ Db\n) .\nThe value of unencumbered assets at t = 2 is again the left-hand side of equation (8). At\nt = 1, a fraction of the (1-m) non-guaranteed unsecured debt is withdrawn, resulting in\ncostly liquidation. Therefore, guarantees reduce the amount of liquidation that the banker\nhas to make in order to meet interim-date withdrawals. The remaining non-guaranteed\nunsecured debt is rolled over, so the banker at t = 2 must meet these, (1 - )(1 - m)Du\n,\nalong with guaranteed unsecured claims, mDg\n, and the claims of covered bond holders due\nto dual recourse. Applying the global games method, the bankruptcy threshold changes\nto\nS\nm\n] - mDg\n- (1 - m)Du\n- Db\nWe assume that the face value of non-guaranteed unsecured debt exceeds that of\nguaranteed unsecured debt, Du\n Dg\n> Dg\n, and the bankruptcy\nthreshold increases in the coverage of the guarantee, S\nm\nm > 0. This reduction in the\nincidence of runs is a consequence of the lower cost and greater stability of guaranteed\nfunding, since guaranteed unsecured funding is not associated with rollover risk,  > 1.\nThe equilibrium in the secured funding market at t = 0 yields D\nb\n= r and B\n=\n), as before. The risk-concentration channel remains unchanged, dS\nm\nd =\n) < 0. In establishing the privately optimal choice of asset encumbrance,\n10While this result arises endogenously at the unsecured funding round, our focus on the secured\nfunding round keeps the normative analysis simple and offers sharp predictions.\n\nm\n, the banker ignores the guarantee cost but takes into account the stabilizing influence\nof guaranteed unsecured debt on rollover behavior. The banker's problem can be reduced\nto:\nmax\n\nm\n F(S\nm\n)(1 + (z - 1)) - mDg\n- (1 - m)Du\n-\nS\nm\nSdF(S)\ns.t. S\nm\n) [1 -  (1 - z)] - mDg\n- (1 - m)Du\nProposition 6 states the privately optimal choice of asset encumbrance with public guar-\nantees. We focus on the interior solution, which arises under similar constraints on in-\nvestment profitability as in Proposition 2.\nProposition 6. Public guarantees and the privately optimal encumbrance level.\nThere exists a unique privately optimal level of asset encumbrance with public guarantees.\nAn interior solution \nm\n (0, 1) is implicitly given by:\nm\n(\nm\n))\nf(S\nm\n(\nm\n))\n=\n+ \nm\nAn increase in the coverage of the guarantee induces greater asset encumbrance, d\nm\ndm\nProof See Appendix G.\nThe intuition for Proposition 6 relates to the cost and stability of funding. For any\ngiven level of encumbrance, as the fraction of guaranteed unsecured debt increases, there\nis less rollover risk, and the bankruptcy threshold S\nm\nincreases, which reduces the range\nof shocks to which the bank is susceptible. Consequently, the banker encumbers more\nassets in order to expand its balance sheet and to increase the expected value of bank\nequity.\nUnlike the banker, the planner accounts for the expected costs of guaranteeing a\nfraction m of unsecured debt, denoted by C. Suppose that guaranteed debt is senior to\nnon-guaranteed claims. In bankruptcy, the value of unencumbered assets is (Smax\n- S).\nSince the face value of guaranteed debt is mDg\n, the bank has sufficient resources to service\nguaranteed debt as long as (Smax\n- S)  mDg\n. We can express this condition as an\nupper bound on the balance sheet shock, S  Smax\n- mDg\n\n.11 Partial default, and thus\ncosts to the guarantor, occur for Smax\n- mDg\n/ < S  Smax\n. Full default occurs for\nlarger shocks, Smax\n< S. Taken together, the expected cost to the guarantor is:\nC \nSmax\nSmax-mDg\n\nmDg\n-  Smax\n- S dF(S) + mDg\n\nSmax\nLemma 3. Guarantee cost. The expected cost to the guarantor increases in both the\nlevel of asset encumbrance and in the fraction of guaranteed unsecured debt; it is also\n11To ensure that the guarantor always repays guaranteed debt if solvent, we impose Smax\n- mDg\n\n> S\nm\n,\nfor which an upper bound on the fraction of guaranteed debt, m < m  +(1-)\nweakly convex in the level of encumbrance and has a positive cross-derivative:\nC\n\nC\nm\nm\nProof See Appendix H.\nLemma 3 summarizes the key features of the cost of guaranteeing unsecured debt.\nFirst, as more assets are encumbered, the upper bound Smax\ndecreases, so the guarantor\npays out for a larger range of shocks. Second, an increase in the fraction of guaranteed\ndebt has two effects: (i) a decrease in the lower bound Smax\n- mDg\n\nand thereby an increase\nin the range of shocks over which the guarantee is paid; and (ii) an increase in the coverage\nof the guarantee. Third, greater coverage increases the expected costs of the guarantee.\nThe planner chooses the level of asset encumbrance to maximize the expected equity\nof the banker net of the expected costs of the guarantor (investors break even). Formally,\nthe constrained efficient level of asset encumbrance, P\n, solves the planner's problem:\nmax\n\nW  m\ns.t. S\nm\n) [1 -  (1 - z)] - mDg\n- (1 - m)Du\n,\nwhere   0 measures the dead-weight loss of raising the funds to back the guarantee,\nfor example, due to distortionary taxation. We again focus on interior solutions.\nProposition 7. Public guarantees and constrained inefficiency. The privately\noptimal level of asset encumbrance is excessive, \nm\n> P\n. This gap increases in the\ncoverage of the guarantee, d(\nm\n-\nP\n)\ndm\n> 0, and in the dead-weight loss, d(\nm\n-P )\nd\nprivately optimal level of bank fragility is excessive, S\nm\n S\nm\n(\nm\n) < S\nm\n(P\n)  SP\n, and\nthe gap increases in the coverage of the guarantee, d(SP -S\nm\n)\ndm\n> 0 and in the dead-weight\nloss, d(SP -S\nm\n)\nd\nProof See Appendix I.\nThe expected cost of the guarantee drives a wedge between the privately optimal\nand constrained efficient levels of asset encumbrance. Greater coverage makes a larger\nproportion of unsecured bank funding cheap and stable, pushing up the privately optimal\nlevel of encumbrance. However, the expected cost of the guarantee also increases, so the\nwedge increases in coverage. Moreover, a higher dead-weight loss of the funds that back\nthe guarantee reduces the constrained efficient level of encumbrance without affecting the\nprivately optimal level. Finally, the excessive fragility of the bank and the associated\ncomparative statics are a direct consequence, since a higher level of encumbrance leads to\nmore fragility.\nProposition 7 clarifies why policy-makers (e.g., CGFS, 2013) have emphasized the\nimportance of prudential safeguards to mitigate the risks of heavy asset encumbrance. In\nwhat follows, we consider three schemes that a regulator can introduce before the secured\nfunding round at t = 0 in order to influence the banker's choice of asset encumbrance.\nThese include (i) caps on asset encumbrance (or, equivalently, on covered bond issuance);\n(ii) minimum capital requirements; and (iii) surcharges based on asset encumbrance. Let\n\nm\ndenote the constrained privately optimal level of asset encumbrance.\nWe start with the cap on asset encumbrance. The formal constrained problem for the\nbanker is given in (10) with the additional constraint of an encumbrance limit,   .\nProposition 8. Caps on asset encumbrance. A cap on asset encumbrance  <\n  P\nattains the constrained efficient allocation (P\n, SP\n) as the constrained private\noptimum.\nProof See Appendix J.\nThe privately optimal level of encumbrance is constrained efficient, \nm\n= P\n, which\nalso results in a constrained efficient level of bank fragility, S\nm\n= SP\n. Intuitively, the\nbank funding channel still dominates the risk-concentration channel at  = P\n, so the\nbanker wishes to encumber more assets but is limited by the regulatory cap, as shown in\nm\nP\n= m\nLevel of Asset Encumbrance \nExpected Equity Value m\nWelfare m\nFigure 4: Expected value of equity and welfare as functions of the level of asset encum-\nbrance. In this example, we set R = 1.1, r = 1, E0\nDu\n= 1.0,  = 0.01 and the shock follows an exponential distribution with\nSecond, we consider minimum capital requirements. Let e denote the bank's un-\nweighted capital ratio at t = 0. It is given by the ratio of the bank's own funds, E0\n,\nand its total assets, 1 + E0\n. Using the equilibrium relation B0\n),\nwe can express the bank's capital ratio as a function of its asset encumbrance level and\nparameters:\ne() \nwhereby greater asset encumbrance expands the balance sheet with debt-funded invest-\nment and therefore strictly decreases the capital ratio, de\ne\nProposition 9. Minimum capital requirements. A minimum capital ratio, e() \ne  e(P\n), attains the constrained efficient allocation as the constrained private optimum.\nProof See Appendix J.\nEncumbering more assets attracts more covered bond funding and thus allows the\nbanker to invest more, for a constant amount of initial capital. Therefore, by imposing a\nlower bound e on the bank's capital ratio, the regulator indirectly influences the privately\nchosen level of asset encumbrance. In particular, setting e  e(P\n), the constrained\nefficient level of asset encumbrance is achieved, also resulting in the constrained efficient\nlevel of bank fragility. In sum, if appropriately tailored, both a cap on asset encumbrance\nand a minimum capital ratio attain the constrained efficient level of asset encumbrance\nand bank fragility. This equivalence result requires encumbered assets to have positive\nrisk weights. If encumbered assets had zero risk weights, however, the capital ratio would\nbe insensitive to encumbrance.\nThird, we consider the surcharge for encumbering assets () paid by the banker at\nt = 0. This surcharge is similar to the deposit insurance premium paid to a deposit insur-\nance fund. We consider schedules for which there is no surcharge without encumbrance,\n(0) = 0, and where the surcharge is weakly increasing in the level of asset encumbrance,\n\n 0. In contrast with the two previous regulatory tools, no additional constraint is\nadded to the banker's problem, but the objective function and the bankruptcy threshold\nchange:\nmax\n\nm\n)(1 + (z - 1)) - () - mDg\n- (1 - m)Du\n-\nS\nm\nSdF(S)\ns.t. S\nm\n)(1 - (1 - z)) - ()] - mDg\n- (1 - m)Du\nSince asset encumbrance surcharges impose a private cost on the banker, they may\nbe a useful tool to curb the private incentives to excessively encumber assets. But there\nmay be a tension between attaining the constrained efficient levels of encumbrance and\nfragility. Since surcharges reduce unencumbered assets, a higher surcharge can heighten\nbank fragility. Proposition 10 states two results about the design of asset encumbrance\nsurcharges.\nProposition 10. Asset encumbrance surcharge. There exists no continuous schedule\nof asset encumbrance surcharges that attains constrained efficiency. However, a schedule\nthat is discontinuous at P\ncan attain constrained efficiency.\nProof See Appendix J.\nOur first result suggests that surcharge schedules that are continuous, for example,\nlinear in the level of asset encumbrance, cannot attain constrained efficiency. Intuitively,\nthe surcharge must be sufficiently large for high levels of encumbrance,  > P\n, to deter\nexcessive encumbrance and obtain the constrained efficient level of encumbrance. By\ncontinuity, the surcharge is also positive at P\n. But this reduces unencumbered assets,\nheightens rollover risk, and adds to bank fragility. In other words, a continuous surcharge\nschedule can attain the constrained efficient level of asset encumbrance, but leads to\nexcessive fragility.\nOur second result suggests that constrained efficiency can be attained if the schedule of\nasset encumbrance surcharges has a discontinuity at P\n. Consider the following example.\nNo surcharge is applied as long as the level of asset encumbrance is less than P\n. The bank\ncan encumber assets up to the constrained efficient level without generating excessive\nfragility. To encumber assets beyond P\n, however, the surcharge is so high that all\nunencumbered assets are wiped out. An unsecured debt run would follow, leading to\nbankruptcy where the bank's equity value is zero. As a result, the bank always chooses\na level of encumbrance \nm\n P\n. Since the bank funding channel again dominates the\nrisk-concentration channel for any   [0, P\n], the banker's constrained privately optimal\nchoice of asset encumbrance is \nm\n= P\nand results in the constrained efficient level of\nbank fragility. An example of a discontinuous surcharge schedule that achieves constrained\nefficiency is:\n+ )I>P\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper presents a model of bank funding with covered bonds and explores some im-\nplications for financial stability. To date, there has been no theoretical analysis of covered\nbonds and our work fills that gap. We find that asset encumbrance has two distinct\nbalance sheet effects. First, covered bond issuance funds more profitable investment and\nincreases the expected value of bank equity (bank funding channel). Second, because\nof dynamic replenishment of the cover pool, balance sheet shocks are asymmetrically\nshifted to unsecured debt holders, resulting in greater fragility (risk-concentration chan-\nnel). The bank's choice of asset encumbrance balances this trade-off between profitability\nand fragility.\nCovered bonds are safe assets and a cheap source of bank funding, but they exacerbate\nthe riskiness and fragility of unsecured debt and render it more costly. This is a conse-\nquence of the replenishment and bankruptcy-remoteness of the cover pool that protects\ncovered bond holders from balance sheet shocks and the dilution of their claims on cover\npool assets in bankruptcy. Financial stability implications arise from the interaction of\nthe rollover risk of unsecured debt and these two features of secured debt. Similar insights\nmay apply to term repos, where safe harbor arrangements ensure bankruptcy-remoteness\nand the right to substitute collateral or variation margins is economically similar to re-\nplenishment.\nWe derive normative implications about asset encumbrance in the context of guaran-\nteed unsecured debt. The privately optimal level of encumbrance and bank fragility are\nexcessive because the banker does not internalize the effect of encumbrance on the cost\nof providing the guarantee. Absent prudential safeguards, banks have strong incentives\nto issue covered bonds in order to shift risk to the guarantor. Accordingly, proposals that\nemphasize covered bonds as a means of reviving mortgage finance need to be accompanied\nby prudential regulation.\nWe study three forms of regulation aimed at curbing excessive asset encumbrance\nby banks. First, a limit on the level of asset encumbrance may be imposed to restore\nconstrained efficiency. This is consistent with measures taken in some jurisdictions such\nas Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Second, since a bank's capital\nratio is typically sensitive to the level of encumbrance, minimum capital requirements can\nbe used to the same effect. Finally, we consider a surcharge for asset encumbrance paid\nto a deposit insurance fund or a contribution to a bailout fund. Our results suggest that\na surcharge schedule has to be discontinuous in the level of asset encumbrance in order\nto restore constrained efficiency.\nOur model generalizes to other settings. In practice, the mix of assets that back cov-\nered bonds are often heterogeneous, including mortgages and public debt. Following a\nbalance sheet shock, the replenishment of the cover pool not only affects the amount of un-\nencumbered assets, but also its risk profile. Since lower-risk assets would be swapped into\nthe asset pool first, the risk-concentration effect would be exacerbated, raising fragility\nand reducing asset encumbrance. If investment was subject to decreasing marginal re-\nturns, the bank funding channel of asset encumbrance would be attenuated, reducing the\nincentives to issue covered bonds. Even with constant returns as in our model, however,\nthe risk-concentration effect limits the private incentives to encumber assets.\nFinally, our model assumes that the guarantor of the bank's unsecured debt is deep-\npocketed and always willing to pay. Doubts about the regulator in this regard could\nheighten the bank's fragility. This, in turn, may reduce the incentives of the bank to\nencumber assets and issue covered bonds. We leave a full treatment of this case for future\nwork.\nA Proof of Proposition 1\nIn each rollover subgame, it is sufficient to establish the existence of a unique Bayesian\nequilibrium in threshold strategies for sufficiently precise private information. Morris and\nShin (2003) show that only threshold strategies survive the iterated deletion of strictly\ndominated strategies; see also Frankel, Morris, and Pauzner (2003). Specifically, we con-\nsider the limiting case of vanishing private noise,  0. Each fund manager i uses a\nthreshold strategy, whereby unsecured debt is rolled over if and only if the private signal\nsuggests that the balance sheet shock is small, xi\n< x. Hence, for a given realization\nS  [S, S], the proportion of fund managers who do not roll over debt is:\nS, x = Prob xi\n> x S = Prob ( i\nA critical mass condition states that bankruptcy occurs when the balance sheet shock\nequals a threshold S, where the proportion of managers not rolling over is evaluated at\nS:\n) -S - S, x\nDu\n\n= 1- S, x Du\nDb\n)\nThe posterior distribution of the balance sheet shock conditional on the private signal is\nderived using Bayes' rule. The indifference condition states that the manager who receives\nthe critical signal xi\n= x is indifferent between rolling and not rolling over unsecured\ndebt:\n = Pr (S < S|xi\nUsing the definition of the private signal xj\n= S + j\nof the indifferent fund manager,\nwe can state the conditional probability as follows:\n1 -  = Pr (S  S|xi\n= x) = Pr (S  S|xi\n= x = S + j\n= Pr (x - j\n S) = Pr ( j\n x - S) = G x - S (21)\nThe indifference condition implies that x-S = G-1 1- . Inserting the indifference\ncondition into S, x , the proportion of managers who do not roll over when the balance\nsheet shock is at the critical level S is perceived by the indifferent manager to be:\nS, xi\nTherefore, the bankruptcy threshold S stated in Proposition 1 follows. For vanishing\nprivate noise, the signal threshold also converges to this value, x  S, allowing us\nto concentrate solely on the bankruptcy threshold. The partial derivatives of S are\nimmediate.\nB Proof of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2\nWe prove that B\nD\nb\nand D\nb\n= r in any equilibrium. We also derive the\ntotal effect of asset encumbrance on the bankruptcy threshold. We guess and verify that\nD\nb\n< R. The partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to B0\nand Db\nare\n\n= (R - Db\n\nDb\nwhere the equity value at S is E(S) = ( - 1)Du\nWe prove B\nD\nb\nby contradiction. First, suppose that D\nb\nB\n.\nBecause of bankruptcy remoteness, infinitely risk-averse investors value the covered bond\nB\n, but the claims from dual recourse are worthless since bankruptcy\noccurs with positive probability. This violates the supposed optimality of D\nb\n, since low-\nering the face value would raise the objective function ( \nDb\n< 0) without affecting the\nconstraint. Contradiction. Thus, D\nb\nB\n. Second, suppose D\nb\nB\n.\nInfinitely risk-averse investors value the covered bond claim at Db\nsince the bank is solvent\nwith positive probability. This violates the supposed optimality of B\n, since raising the\nissuance volume of covered bonds would raise the objective function ( \n> 0) without\naffecting the constraint. Contradiction. Thus, D\nb\nB\n. Taken together, we have\nB\nD\nb\n. Thus, the problem of the banker reduces to\nmax\n) - Du\n-\nS\nSdF(S)\nS = S(, B0\n) - Du\nr \n)\n.\nSince (,B0)\n\n> 0, the participation constraint of risk-averse investors\nbinds in equilibrium, B\n), which yields D\nb\n= r < R, verifying the\nsupposition. This link between the encumbrance level and the amount of covered bond\nfunding constitutes the bank funding channel. As a result, the bankruptcy threshold\nbecomes S() = R(1+E0\nr\n)]-Du\n. The total effect of encumbrance on this\nthreshold is dS()\nd\nr\n< 0, which constitutes the risk concentration\nchannel.\nC Proof of Proposition 2\nThis proof continues from the proof of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. Using D\nb\n= r and\nB\n=  R\nr\n), we obtain at a simple unconstrained optimization problem in which\nboth the risk concentration and the bank funding channels are taken into account:\nmax\nR\nr\n-\nS()\nSdF(S)\nR\nr\n- Du\n.\nUsing the risk concentration channel, the first and second derivative of the objective\nfunction value with respect to the level of asset encumbrance are:\n)\nd\nd\n F(S)\nR\nr\nR\nr\n)\n\ndS()\nd\n\nR\nr\nR\nr\nf (S())E(S())\nR\nr\nThe sign of the second-order derivative is ensured by f  0 and R < r. Therefore, the\nobjective function is globally concave and there exists at most one solution. If a solution\nexists, it is a (global) maximum. By continuity of the objective function , and the closed\nset [0, 1] over which the banker maximizes, a solution  exists. This establishes the\nexistence and uniqueness of a global maximum. We use the notation d\nd\n \netc.\nWe next study whether this solution is interior. First, we require  > 0.

Since the bankruptcy threshold S\ndecreases in asset encumbrance  (Lemma 2), the left-hand side in condition (31) is smaller\nthan the left-hand side in condition (30). Moreover, the right-hand side in condition (31)\nis larger than the right-hand side in condition (30) because of the additional term. As a\nresult, R > R, which justifies our labels. In sum,   (0, 1) for any R  R, R .\nD Proof of Proposition 3 and Corollary 2\nWe compute comparative statics of  with respect to y  {R, , , r, E0\n, Du\n} and the\ndistribution of the balance sheet shock. We focus on intermediate investment profitability,\nR  R, R , in order to guarantee an interior solution   (0, 1). The implicit function\ntheorem yields d\ndy\n= -y\n\n. To derive the partial derivatives, we use the bankruptcy\nthreshold in equation (26) together with the derivative of the expected profit with respect\nto asset encumbrance, \nFirst, we report the partial derivatives of the threshold S  S(), where the\nrelative return is z = R\nr\n:\nS\n\nS\nDu\nS\nR\nS\n\n= -\n\nS\nr\nS\nS\n\n= Rz +\nDu\nSecond, we report the partial derivatives of the implicit function defined by \n\n= ((z - 1)f(S) - (1 - z)E(S)f (S))\nS\n\nDu\n\n= [(1 - )f(S) - (1 - z)f (S)E(S)]\nS\n\nr\n= -\nR\n[F(S) + f (S)E(S)] + (z - 1)f(S)\nS\nr\n-(1 - z)f (S)E(S)\nS\nr\n\n= (z - 1)F(S) + (z - 1)f(S)\nS\n\n-(1 - z)f (S)\nS\n\n) +\nDu\nThird, by the implicit function theorem, we obtain the first four comparative statics\nreported in Proposition 3: d\nd\nd\ndr\n< 0, and d\ndDu\nFourth, suppose that the balance sheet shock distribution F stochastically dominates\nthe distribution F according to the reverse hazard rate.

Since \n\n< 0, it follows that the privately optimal levels of encumbrance satisfies   .\nFinally, we consider the comparative statics of the privately optimal level of asset\nencumbrance with respect to initial bank capital and investment profitability:\nS\nR\n=\n\nr\n+f(S) (z - 1)\nS\nR\n+\n\nr\n) .\nSince f (S)  0, a sufficient condition for E0\n\nLet the two roots be z1\nsuch that g(z) > 0 for z < z1\nand z > z2\n.

The first-order condition of the privately\noptimal level of asset encumbrance is linear. Rewriting yields the expression stated in\nCorollary 2, and differentiation with respect to E0\nyields\nd\n=\nsince the numerator is unambiguously positive and the denominator is positive between\n\n\n, which includes the full support of the relative return.\nSimilarly,\nd\ndR\n=\nwhich is unambiguously positive for the same reason.\nE Proof of Proposition 4\nThe equilibrium face value of unsecured debt D\nu\nis implicitly defined by the binding\nparticipation constraint of risk-neutral investors, V (D\nu\n) = r. The proof of existence and\nuniqueness of D\nu\nis in four steps. First, for any given Du\n, the value of the unsecured debt\nclaim decreases in the level of asset encumbrance:\nV\n\n= Du\n[1 - ]f(S)\ndS\nd\nS\nmax\nS\nIntuitively, more asset encumbrance reduces both the pool of unencumbered assets and\nthe range of balance sheet shocks for which unsecured debt holders are repaid in full, so\nthe overall effect on the value of the unsecured debt claim is negative.\nSecond, risk-neutral investors never accept a debt claim with face value Du\n= r:\nV (Du\n= r) = rF(S) + \nS\nmax\nS\n(S\nmax\n< r F(S) + [F(S\nmax\nThird, the value of the unsecured debt claim changes with its face value according to\ndV\ndDu\n= V\n\n\nDu\n+ V\nDu\n, where S\nDu\n= - and\nV\nDu\n= F(S) - (1 - )Du\n= f(S)\n+ (1 - )R] - (1 - )Du\nwhere we used the first-order condition for . Since the indirect effect via  is positive,\nV\n\n\nDu\n> 0, and since (1-)Rf(S)  0, a sufficient condition for dV\ndDu\n> 0 is that the\nterm multiplying f(S)Du\nis non-negative, -(1 - ) + 1-z\n( - 1)  0. Rewriting\nyields an upper bound on investment profitability relative to the return on storage:\nz  z \n\nwhich can be written as R  ~\nR. This condition ensures the monotonicity of the unsecured\ndebt claim in its face value, dV\ndDu\n> 0, and suffices for uniqueness of D\nu\n(if it exists).\nFourth, existence requires that risk-neutral investors accept the debt claim for a feasi-\nble face value. Since the banker can promise at most Du\n= R, we require V (Du\n= R) > r\nbecause of monotonicity. Since S(R) = R[(1 + E0\nr < RF(S(R)) + \nS\nmax\nS(R)\n(S\nmax\nSince greater asset encumbrance dilutes the unsecured debt claim, as shown in the first\npoint, a sufficient condition in terms of exogenous parameters of the model can be obtained\nby evaluating this inequality at  = 1:\n)z - ]) + \n)z - ] - S)dF(S). (57)\nThis condition suffices for the existence of D\nu\n.

By Proposition 2, which defines the privately optimal level of\nasset encumbrance,  = ^\n because both F and ^\nF are identical for any S < \nS. Thus,\nthe difference in distribution affects the value of the unsecured debt claim only via the\nliquidation value in bankruptcy, but not via changes in asset encumbrance. Next, observe\nthat V (Du\n| ^\nF) > V (Du\n|F), for any given Du\n, because of the lower tail risk under ^\nF.\nSince risk-neutral investors always receive their outside option in expectation, we have\nV ( ^\nD\nu\n| ^\nF) = r = V (D\nu\n|F). Since dV\ndDu\n> 0 as showed before, it follows that ^\nD\nu\n< D\nu\n.\nG Proof of Proposition 6\nThe first-order condition is a straightforward extension of the model without public guar-\nantees and follows directly from the problem in (10). The comparative static d\nm\ndm\nfollows from the implicit function theorem, since d\nm\ndm\n= -m\n\n> 0. The sign arises\nfrom f  0, S\nm\n S\nm\n(\nm\n), S\nm\n\nm\nm\n= Du\n- Dg\nm\n+ \nm\n) > 0 as well as\n\nm\n)(1 - z)f (S\nm\n) - (z - 1) + 1 -  f(S\nm\nm\n) f(S\nm\n)(z - 1)(Du\n- Dg\n) - (1 - z) f (S\nm\n)E(S\nm\n) [Du\n- Dg\n]\n- f(S\nm\nH Proof of Lemma 3\nThe partial derivatives of the expected cost to the guarantor with respect to the level of\nasset encumbrance and the coverage of the guarantee are:\nC\n\n C\n) F Smax\n- F Smax\n-\nmDg\n\n C\n- f Smax\n-\nmDg\n\nC\nm\n Cm\n= Dg\n1 - F Smax\n-\nmDg\n\nm\n Cm\n)Dg\nf Smax\n-\nmDg\n\nI Proof of Proposition 7\nAs for preliminaries, we have W\n \n< 0 and [0, 1] is a closed set, so there\nexists a unique global welfare maximum at the constrained efficient level of encumbrance,\nP\n. If interior, this level solves the first-order condition \n(P\n) = (1 + )C\n(P\n). The\nassociated level of fragility is SP\n S\nm\n(P\n).\nTo establish constrained inefficiency of the privately optimal level of asset encum-\nbrance, note that W\n(\nm\n; m) = -C\n(\nm\n; m) < 0. Since P\nsolves W\n(P\nand the objective function of the planner is globally concave, W\n< 0, it follows that\nP\n< \nm\n.\nWe turn to the comparative statics of the gap between the privately optimal and\nconstrained efficient encumbrance levels. Since W\n= -C\nd\n= - W\nW\n< 0 by the\nimplicit function theorem (IFT), which yields the second comparative static, d(\nm\n-P )\nd\n(\nm\nis independent of ). Similarly, the first comparative static obtains if dP\ndm\n< d\nm\ndm\n. Let\nWm\n m\n- Cm\n. By the IFT for both P\nand \nm\n, this inequality requires -Wm\nW\n<\n-m\n\n -m-(1+)Cm\n< -m\n\n Cm\n\n< m\nC\n, which always holds.\nTurning to bank fragility, excessive fragility and the comparative statics of the bank-\nruptcy threshold w.r.t. guarantee coverage arise from \nm\n> P\n, d(\nm\n-P )\ndm\ndS\nm\nd\n< 0. Similarly, the comparative static on the dead-weight loss follows from dP\nd\nand d\nm\nd\nJ Proof of Propositions 8 \u00ad 10\nWe consider the cap on asset encumbrance and Proposition 8 first. From Proposition 7,\nwe know that the bank's unconstrained choice of asset encumbrance, \nm\n, is greater than\nthe constrained efficient level, P\n. Moreover, because of the global concavity of , \nfor  < \nm\n. Therefore, introducing the constraint   P\ninto the bank's program at the\nsecured funding round at t = 0 implies that the constraint will always bind, \nm\n= P\n.\nSecond, we consider a minimum capital requirement and Proposition 9. The mini-\nmum capital ratio, e()  e  E0\n, can be re-written as a cap on the level of\nasset encumbrance,   P\n. As before, introducing a minimum capital ratio as an addi-\ntional constraint in the bank's program at the secured funding round yields constrained\nefficiency.\nThird, we consider the encumbrance surcharge and Proposition 10. We show by contra-\ndiction that there exists no continuous schedule of asset encumbrance surcharge. Suppose\nsuch a schedule exists and call it ~\n. To ensure that the constrained privately optimal\nlevel of asset encumbrance does not exceed P\n, it must be true that ~\n() > 0 for any\n > P\n. (Intuitively, the surcharge is high enough to prevent the banker from increasing\nthe asset encumbrance level beyond P\n, as is optimal without constraint; see Propositions\n6 and 7.) By continuity, ~\n(P\n) > 0. Using the expression for the bankruptcy threshold\nin (16), we obtain S\nm\n(P\n) < SP\n, contradicting the supposed constrained efficiency of the\nschedule ~\n.\nFinally, we show by example that there exists a schedule that is sufficiently discontin-\nuous at P\nand attains constraint efficiency. Consider the example in the main text, ^\n.\nThe surcharge wipes out all unencumbered assets if  > P\nis chosen, but does not affect\nthe problem if   P\n. Therefore, we can effectively write the discontinuous schedule\nof asset encumbrance surcharges as a constraint   P\non the banker's problem. We\nhave already shown that this constraint attains constrained efficiency, which concludes\nthe proof.\nReferences\nAllen, F., E. Carletti, I. Goldstein, and A. Leonello (2015).
