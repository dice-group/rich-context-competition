Results revealed few differences across conditions, and\nreliability coefficients and predictive validity estimates were similar to those typically obtained using standard, multiple-item\nquestionnaires.The DAS is therefore supported as a consistent and efficacious method for measuring personality traits with\nsingle items.\n",

These studies, among others (e.g., Barrett &\nPaltiel, 1996), have shown that single-item measures are an\neffective alternative to traditional multiple-item measures\nthat also carry with them the benefits of ease and brevity of\nadministration.\nGrice, Mignogna, and Badzinsky (2011) recently intro-\nduced the Dynamic Analog Scale (DAS) as a flexible and\ngeneric technique that is computer administered and can be\nused to measure individual differences on psychological\nconstructs with a single item. Initial results have shown that\nthe DAS is capable of yielding data with psychometric prop-\nerties similar to those of multiple-item questionnaires. Figure\n1 shows a screenshot of an example DAS for the bipolar con-\nstruct \"agreeable vs. disagreeable\" generated by the Idiogrid\ncomputer program (Grice, 2002). Instructions on how to rate\nthe individuals are included on the top left of the screen.\nParticipants simply click the names/labels of the individuals\nto be rated and drag and drop them anywhere along the verti-\ncal continuous rating scale. Once a name has been placed on\nthe scale, it can be moved around, placed at the same point on\nthe scale as another individual (e.g., see \"Adam\" and \"Ben\"\nin Figure 1), or removed from the scale if the participant is\nunsure of where to rate a particular individual (e.g., see\n\"Sara\" in Figure 1). This particular scale is anchored by the\nterms \"The Most Extreme A-1 Person Imaginable\" to \"The\nMost Extreme 1-A Person Imaginable,\" which have been\ncreated and defined by the researcher.\nThe definitions for the anchors of the DAS, located on the\nleft side of the screen (below the instructions), are written by\nthe researcher based on theory. In this example, the anchors\nfor the Big Five traits are generic labels (e.g., A-1 vs. 1-A for\nagreeable vs. disagreeable), intended to reduce the likelihood\nof respondents relying on their own idiosyncratic definitions\nof the trait terms. The individuals to be rated are either elic-\nited from the participant to fit a particular role description or\nincluded in the list by the researcher. These can include any-\none of interest, such as individuals from the respondent's life\n(e.g., friend, significant other, relatives), various selves (e.g.,\nactual self, ideal self), reference individuals (e.g., the typical\ncollege student), or other figures (e.g., public figures, fic-\ntional characters).\nBeyond traditional analog or multipoint scales, the DAS\ncontains several characteristics that serve as extensions of\nrecent research on single-item measures. First, using the\nDAS, respondents rate multiple people simultaneously and\n1Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nErika A.

Grice1\n Keywords\nDynamic Analog Scale, Big Five Model, personality measurement, traits\n2 SAGE Open\ncan move people around during the rating process, creating a\n\"social network\" for the respondent to rate himself or herself\nwithin (Denissen, Geenen, Selfhout, & Van Aken, 2008). In\naddition, the researcher clearly defines each pole of the con-\nstruct and provides these definitions to the respondent as the\nbasis for which the bipolar construct should be understood\n(Woods & Hampson, 2005). Moreover, each pole of the con-\nstruct is anchored by extreme terms, so as to reduce the like-\nlihood of individual differences in how the scale endpoints\nare interpreted (Bartoshuk et al., 2002).\nIn an initial study of the validity of the DAS, Grice et al.\n(2011) found that the DAS was just as efficacious as a stan-\ndard multiple-item questionnaire measuring the same person-\nality traits in predicting behavioral acts, self-esteem, general\naffect, and religiosity. Moreover, they reported favorable\nimmediate and approximate 2-week test\u00adretest reliability coef-\nficients for the DAS.\nIn the current study, we more thoroughly evaluated the\nproperties of the DAS as a single-item technique for measur-\ning individual differences using the Big Five personality traits.\nIn addition to examining the immediate test\u00adretest reliability\nof the DAS, we also examined its predictive validity regard-\ning a number of well-known consequential outcomes related\nto human personality. The particular criteria (volunteerism,\nreligiosity, affect, and drinking behaviors) were chosen from\na recent review article (see Ozer & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2006) that\nshowed how well the Big Five personality traits predicted a\nvariety of consequential outcomes. Moreover, using a com-\nplex study design, we examined the potential influence of (a)\nmodifying the social context component in the rating process\nand (b) modifying the descriptive trait definitions used by\nGrice et al. (2011) to reduce the social desirability of the trait\npoles.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 250 undergraduate students volunteered to par-\nticipate in exchange for course credit.

Determined by the group\nto which participants were assigned, they received one of two\nversions of the Big Five bipolar trait descriptions (the OCEAN\nor the ABCDE) when completing the DAS.\nFigure 1. Example Dynamic Analog Scale for the agreeable versus disagreeable trait\nBrown and Grice 3\nThe OCEAN is the set of original descriptions used by\nGrice et al. (2011) to define each pole of the Big Five\ntraits (i.e., Open-Minded/Close-Minded, Conscientious/\nUnconscientious, Extraverted/Introverted, Agreeable/\nDisagreeable, and Emotionally Stable/Emotionally Unstable).\nThese descriptions were slightly modified in this study,\nhowever, by concealing the trait names using a generic label\nconsisting of a capital letter either preceded or followed by\nthe number \"1.\" This change was made to reduce the desir-\nability of either pole as a result of individuals' prior knowl-\nedge of the Big Five trait names. The descriptions were also\nmodified to be more gender neutral to reduce the influence of\ngenderstereotyping.Withthesechangesinmind,Extraversion\n(E-1),forexample,wasdescribedindistinctiontoIntroversion\nAn E-1 person is someone who tends to direct his or\nher energy toward the external world rather than to the\ninner world of ideas. Consequently, when presented\nwith a new situation or unfamiliar activity, E-1s tend\nto jump right in without much hesitation. For instance,\nan E-1 attending a Yoga class for the first time with a\nfriend would not hesitate to join in the exercises, or an\nE-1 visiting a sports bar for the first time would not feel\nuncomfortable in such a novel setting. E-1s, thus, tend\nto be seen as energetic and tend to seek out activities\nthat involve other people. They also tend to be talkative,\neven in large groups of people, and they can sometimes\nappear to be aggressive when interacting with other\npeople, even strangers.\nThe ABCDE is similar to the OCEAN, except that the\ngeneric labels were made more ambiguous to reduce the\nlikelihood that the traits could be guessed from the familiar\nOCEAN acronym. Instead, the letters A, B, C, D, and E\nreplaced O, C, E, A, and N, respectively (i.e., A instead of O,\nB instead of C, C instead of E, etc.). Moreover, the descrip-\ntions were modified to further neutralize the traits by explic-\nitly adding strengths and weaknesses to each pole. For\nexample, the Extraversion description was modified to read\nas follows:\nA C-1 person is someone who tends to direct his or her\nenergy toward the external world rather than to the\ninner world of ideas. Consequently, when presented\nwith a new situation or unfamiliar activity, C-1s tend\nto jump right in without much hesitation. For instance,\na C-1 attending a Yoga class for the first time with a\nfriend would not hesitate to join in the exercises, or a\nC-1 visiting a sports bar for the first time would not\nfeel uncomfortable in such a novel setting. C-1s, thus,\ntend to be seen as energetic and tend to seek out\nactivities that involve other people. C-1s' strengths are\nthat they tend to be relaxed in novel situations and\nthey can have large social networks. With regard to\nweaknesses, C-1s may be too greatly influenced by\ntheir surroundings, and they tend to develop fewer\ntruly intimate relationships.\nSimilarly,theIntroversiondescription(1-C)includedstrengths\nand weaknesses.\nDAS. The DAS was administered using Idiogrid Version\ntaneously rated individuals on a scale ranging from -200 to\nresolution, thus represented a quasi-continuous scale. Par-\nticipants completed five scales anchored by the Big Five trait\npoles. For example, one scale asked the participant to simul-\ntaneously rate individuals on a continuous scale ranging\nfrom 1-C (Introversion) to C-1 (Extraversion). All partici-\npants (simultaneously) rated their actual self, and, depending\non the experimental group to which they were assigned, may\nhave rated their ideal self and 10 other individuals whom they\nnamed (see below). The descriptions they were provided\non the Big Five bipolar trait descriptions (i.e., OCEAN or\nABCDE) were typed next to the respective scale to serve as a\nreminder of what the generic labels stood for. Ratings were\nstored in a two-dimensional matrix for analysis.\nVolunteerism Questionnaire (VQ). The VQ consists of three\nyes-or-no items that ask participants if they have ever volun-\nteered in the past, if they are currently volunteering, and if\nthey plan to volunteer in the future. For each question that is\nanswered with a \"yes,\" participants are asked to list each\nvolunteering activity, approximate dates, and how they got\ninvolved. This questionnaire was adapted from Carlo, Okun,\nKnight, and de Guzman (2005). For the current study, only the\nquantity of volunteer activities per question was analyzed.\nReligious Orientation Scale (ROS). The ROS (Allport & Ross,\npractices. Participants indicate the degree to which they agree\nwith each item using a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from\n\"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\"). Internal Religiosity\nand External Religiosity scores are computed, ranging from\nreported to have adequate psychometric properties for research\n(Hill & Hood, 1999). For the current study, average scores\nwere computed for each of the subscales as a means of deal-\ning with missing data (<1% missing). In addition, one item\nwas dropped from the analyses due to a typographical error\nthat rendered the item ambiguous.\nPositive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). On the\nPANAS, participants use a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging\nfrom \"very slightly or not at all\" to \"extremely\") to indicate\nhow they feel day to day (e.g., \"distressed,\" \"excited,\" \"enthu-\nsiastic,\"\"irritable\").Positiveand NegativeAffect scores are com-\nputed, ranging from 10 to 50. The PANAS has been reported\nto yield highly reliable and highly valid data (Watson, Clark, &\nTellegen, 1988). For the current study, average scores were\ncomputed for each of the subscales as a means of dealing\nwith missing data (<1% missing).\n4 SAGE Open\nDaily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ). The DDQ (Dimeff,\nBaer, Kivlahan & Marlatt, 1999) asks participants to self-\nreport the number of alcoholic drinks they consume and the\nnumber of hours within which the drinks are consumed each\nday during a typical week. Participants also self-report on\ntheir age, gender, weight, height, type of housing, fraternity/\nsorority involvement, employment, and university enrollment.\nThe DDQ was adapted from the Drinking Practices Question-\nnaire (Cahalan, Cisin, & Crossley, 1969), with which it cor-\nrelates moderately.\nDrinking Frequency-Quantity Questionnaire (DFQQ).TheDFQQ\n(Dimeff et al., 1999) is a three-item, multiple-choice question-\nnaire that asks about drinking behaviors during a typical\nmonth. For example, ranging from 1 = no drinks to 11 = 19 or\nmore, participants are asked to report the most alcohol con-\nsumed on one occasion over the past month and how many\ndrinks they typically consume on the weekend. Ranging from\n1 = I do not drink to 6 = once a day or more, participants are\nasked to report how often they drank during the previous\nmonth.\nProcedure\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of five groups:\n29 females). Table 1 summarizes the groups. All participants\nrated their actual selves using their respective set of Big Five\ntrait definitions (i.e., the OCEAN or the ABCDE). Participants\nin the Ideal OCEAN-10 and OCEAN-10 groups both received\nthe OCEAN Big Five trait definitions, whereas those in the\nIdeal ABCDE-10, Ideal ABCDE, and ABCDE groups received\nthe ABCDE trait definitions. With regard to the other rated\ntargets, participants in the Ideal OCEAN-10, Ideal ABCDE-\n10, and Ideal ABCDE groups rated their ideal selves, and\nparticipants in the Ideal OCEAN-10, OCEAN-10, and Ideal\nABCDE-10 groups named 10 additional people to be rated.\nFor those groups who were asked to rate 10 additional peo-\nple (see Table 1), participants were asked to write the first name\nor role title (e.g., \"mom\" or \"coach\") of one individual whom\nthey know personally who fits the description of each pole of\nthe trait definitions (i.e., 10 total).Also, they were asked to write\na brief description as to why the elicited individual fits that par-\nticular description (e.g., \"He can't stand being alone\" or \"She\nloves being the center of attention\" for an extraverted person).\nEach of the elicited individuals served as a \"marker person\" (see\nGrice, Jackson, & McDaniel, 2006) for each pole of the Big\nFive traits and also provided researchers the opportunity to\nensure the participants truly understood the descriptions.\nParticipants worked in small groups of up to four indi-\nviduals at computer stations separated by divider panels.\nParticipantsreceivedindividualinstructionsfromthe researcher,\ncould work at their own pace, and were blind to the other\nconditions. On arrival, all participants filled out basic demo-\ngraphic information and were then given the Big Five bipo-\nlar trait descriptions for their respective group (i.e., Ideal\nOCEAN-10 and OCEAN-10 participants were given the\nOCEAN; Ideal ABCDE-10, Ideal ABCDE, and ABCDE par-\nticipants were given the ABCDE). Participants were given as\nmuch time as they needed to thoroughly read through each\ndescription. During this time, participants in those groups\nasked to rate 10 additional people elicited the names of these\n\"marker people\" for each trait pole. Next, participants\nwatched a short video demonstrating how to rate individuals\nusing the DAS. After completing the DAS, participants filled\nout the remaining inventories (including the VQ, ROS,\nPANAS, DDQ, and the DFQQ). Finally, participants com-\npleted the DAS a second time, rating the same individuals on\nthe same five constructs as they had previously.\nResults\nConsistency of the DAS\nThe participants' self-ratings were consistent across the two\nadministrations of the DAS, with all Pearson product\u00ad\nmoment correlation coefficients greater than .70 (Median =\n.83). Table 2 summarizes the correlation coefficients for\neach of the five groups (Ideal OCEAN-10, OCEAN-10, etc.).\nOverall consistency of each participant's responses between\nthe first and second administrations of the DAS could also\nbe computed using Slater's General Degree of Correlation2\n(see Grice, 2002) because each participant rated the same\nindividuals on the same constructs for both grids in all but the\nABCDE group. The obtained correlation for each participant\ntypically ranges in value from 0 to 1 (although in rare cases\nthe observed value can fall outside of this range), with\nhigher values indicating higher levels of overall consistency\nbetween the two grids. Median correlations for each group\nTable 1.

The mean\nactual self ratings from each of the five conditions were com-\npared using one-way ANOVAs on each of the Big Five per-\nsonality traits. The results indicated that, across the five\nconditions, the participants' self-ratings did not differ signifi-\ncantly from one another on any of the Big Five traits (all Fs\nfor the actual self ratings for each trait by group. For neu-\nroticism (bolded in Table 3), results from Tukey's HSD post\nhoc analysis revealed that those individuals who read the\nmodified trait definitions (including strengths and weak-\nnesses) and who also rated their ideal self and 10 other indi-\nviduals (i.e., those individuals in the Ideal ABCDE-10\ncondition) rated their actual self as more emotionally unsta-\nble than those individuals who read the original trait defini-\ntions (i.e., conditions Ideal OCEAN-10 and OCEAN-10).4\nRegression Analyses\nMultiple regression analyses were conducted to test the\nunique predictive capacity of the Big Five traits using the\nexternal criteria (volunteerism, religiosity, affect, and drinking\nbehaviors) as the dependant variables.5 Because a major aim\nof the current research was to investigate any differences that\nmay arise as a result of the five groups, each of the models\nwas evaluated for each group separately. To determine\nwhether significant differences existed between the groups,\nthe obtained Multiple R values were subjected to Fisher's\nwell-known formula for comparing two independent correla-\ntions.6 Beyond merely noting the statistical significance of\nthese comparisons, what is truly of interest here is the magni-\ntude discrepancies of each pair of R2 values.

Moreover, the\nanalyses for the three drinking behavior\u00addependent variables\nyielded Multiple R values that were not significantly differ-\nent between any of the five groups (all zs < 1.38).\nThe pattern of predictive values across groups was exam-\nined by comparing each group's R2 values for each of the\n10 external criteria to the 10 R2 values in each other group\n(e.g., the R2 values for Ideal OCEAN-10 were compared with\nthe R2 values for OCEAN-10) using the Gower similarity\ncoefficient (Barrett, 2010b)--a coefficient that indicates the\nmagnitude of similarity between pairs of observations. From\nthe Gower coefficient matrix in Table 5, it can be seen that the\nfive conditions yielded highly similar R2 values, with a mean\nsimilarity of 92% between the pairs of observations (SD =\nFurthermore, bootstrapping (Barrett, 2010a), generating\n10,000 Gower coefficients, revealed that obtaining a Gower\ncoefficient equal to or greater than the lowest observed Gower\ncoefficient (.90) was highly unlikely to occur by chance alone\nDiscussion\nThe results from this study support the use of the DAS as a\nmeans for measuring individual differences in personality\ntraits with a single item. Participants were highly consistent\nbetween the first and second administrations of the DAS in\nterms of their actual self ratings and their grids overall.\nMoreover, participants who were asked to rate 10 additional\nindividuals consistently rated these \"marker people\" (see\nGrice et al., 2006) on the appropriate trait pole for which\nthey were elicited (95.78% of the time for Ideal OCEAN-\n10). Furthermore, the standard deviations were large enough\nto show that participants were using the full length of the\nscale range, showing some variability in their ratings\nbetween themselves as well as the other individuals that\nwere rated. All this suggests that the participants understood\nBrown and Grice 7\nTable 4. Regression Analyses Predicting External Criteria From the Big Five DAS Constructs\nGroup\nCriteria Ideal OCEAN-10 OCEAN-10 Ideal ABCDE-10 Ideal ABCDE ABCDE\n(continued)\n8 SAGE Open\nthe procedures and were able to complete them appropri-\nately, with ease and in a timely manner.\nFurthermore, a primary aim of the current study was to\naddress (a) the impact of rating only oneself versus oneself\nalong with other individuals (by varying the social network of\nthe five groups) and (b) the issue of social desirability that is\noften present in rating oneself on the Big Five traits, a notion\nthat is supported by B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m's (2007) recent higher-\norder factor analysis of the Big Five factors. The modified\ndefinitions were designed to include strengths and weaknesses\n(i.e., adaptive and maladaptive qualities) of both poles of each\ntrait, so as to neutralize them to a degree and reduce the social\ndesirability in rating oneself on one pole over the other.\nStatistical analyses revealed that, across the five condi-\ntions, the mean rating of participants' actual selves were not\nsignificantly different from one another for any of the Big\nFive traits, except for neuroticism. For neuroticism, those\nparticipants in the Ideal ABCDE-10 group tended to rate\nthemselves as significantly more emotionally unstable than\nthose individuals in the Ideal OCEAN-10 and the OCEAN-10\ngroups, but not significantly different from the Ideal ABCDE\nand ABCDE groups. Interestingly, all three conditions with the\nmodified trait definitions had a positive mean neuroticism\nscore, whereas the two conditions with the original trait defini-\ntions had mean neuroticism scores in the opposite direction\n(i.e., negative). This unusual finding was replicated in another\nsample of individuals using the modified trait definitions.\nThese findings suggest that, at least for neuroticism, adding\nstrengths and weaknesses to each pole (i.e., emotional sta-\nbility and emotional instability) may have had the desired\neffect of reducing the social desirability of rating oneself as\nemotionally stable. Of less importance was the social context\nwithin which participants rated themselves. In other words,\nthe finding appears to be linked more so to the trait definitions\nthey were given, rather than to whether they were asked to rate\ntheir ideal self or other individuals in addition to their actual\nself. One avenue for future research would be to investigate\nthis finding further with neuroticism as well as the other traits\nto potentially reduce the influence of social desirability of a\nparticular pole on participants' responses.\nAs evaluating the predictive validity of single-item mea-\nsures is an essential step in assessing their efficacy (Burisch,\n1997), multiple regression analyses were conducted for each\ngroup. Although the regression models were arguably under-\npowered and most were nonsignificant, the primary interest\nin these analyses was not the statistical significance of the\nmodels. Rather, the discrepancies of the R2 values between\nthe five groups were the primary concern here. With one\nexception, there were no differences between the five groups\nin how well the outcomes (volunteerism, religiosity, affect,\nGroup\nCriteria Ideal OCEAN-10 OCEAN-10 Ideal ABCDE-10 Ideal ABCDE ABCDE\nNote: DAS = Dynamic Analog Scale.

Gower Similarity Coefficients for R2 Values by Group\nNote: All values p < .001, two-tailed.\nBrown and Grice 9\nand drinking behavior) were predicted; and the Gower coef-\nficients indicated that the R2 values were highly consistent\nacross the five groups. These results suggest that, on the\nwhole, modifying the trait definitions by adding strengths and\nweaknesses and modifying the social network within which\nparticipants rated their actual selves did not significantly\naffect how the consequential outcomes were predicted.\nFurthermore, the DAS yielded results comparable with\nthose typically obtained by studies that use more traditional\nmultiple-item measures of the Big Five (such as the BFQ and\nNEO) in predicting such consequential outcomes as past vol-\nunteerism, external religiosity, and positive and negative\naffect (see Ozer & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2006). For example, in\ntheir meta-analysis examining personality as a correlate of\nsubjective well-being, DeNeve and Cooper (1998) found\nthat negative affect correlates .05 with openness to experi-\nence, -.10 with conscientiousness, -.07 with extraversion,\n-.13 with agreeableness, and .23 with neuroticism. Results\nfrom the DAS, across the five groups, similarly showed that\nnegative affect correlates -.01 with openness to experience,\nwith agreeableness, and .28 with neuroticism. The magnitudes\nof the effect sizes were thus entirely consistent with those\nobtained in other studies using common multiple-item mea-\nresults consequently indicate that the DAS is just as effective\nas more traditional techniques in predicting consequential\noutcomes. The results also serve as a reminder, however, that\ntrait psychologists often deal in small effect sizes when dis-\ncussing predictive validity.\nDespite that neither technique--the DAS nor multiple-\nitem questionnaires--appears to be superior to the other,\nthere are some aspects of the DAS that distinguish it from\nthe more conventional methods. The DAS is a simple rat-\ning technique that is completed in a timely manner, and it\naffords the researcher more control over the rating process\nthrough a variety of channels. First, rather than relying on\nthe assumption that all participants will understand an item in\nthe intended manner, the researcher is capable of clearly defin-\ning the subtleties of a particular construct to better ensure that\nthe construct is understood in its intended manner. Second, the\nresearcher is able to manipulate labels for the pole anchors.\nFor example, recent research has used such anchors as \"exces-\nsively extraverted\" and \"excessively conscientious\" to inves-\ntigate personality disorders as extreme manifestations of\ndimensional personality traits (Mullins-Sweatt, Jamerson,\nSamuel, Olson, & Widiger, 2006). Third, the researcher is\ncapable of creating the participants' reference group during\nthe rating process by deciding the number of additional peo-\nple to be rated and who these individuals will be. This also\nprovides intriguing data (other than only the actual self) that\ncould be analyzed without participants being asked to com-\nplete the same measure separately for each target individual.\nLast, participants reported enjoying the interactive nature of\nthe DAS and the ability to rate multiple people simultane-\nously. This is an important consideration, particularly when\nparticipants are asked to complete multiple questionnaires\nor the same questionnaire multiple times for different people\n(e.g., actual self and ideal self).\nIn sum, the DAS has been evaluated as a single-item tech-\nnique for measuring the Big Five personality traits in this study\nas well as the two studies reported in Grice et al. (2011). The\noverarching conclusion to be drawn from these investigations\nis that multiple items may not be necessary when measuring\nhuman personality traits--they can be measured just as well\nwith only one item, and the DAS is a feasible approach for\ndoing so. Using a single item, the DAS yields reliability and\nvalidity coefficients equal to those obtained using multiple\nitems. Coupled with the benefits of only using one item (e.g.,\nmore control over defining the item, brevity and simplicity\nof the task), it stands to reason that single-item measurement is\nat least as valuable as multiple-item measurement. Given the\namount of success that other researchers (e.g., Barrett & Paltiel,\nhave had in measuring other constructs with a single item, it\nshould come as no surprise that personality traits can also be mea-\nsured using one item just as effectively as using multiple items.\n"
