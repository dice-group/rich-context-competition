Costs for fatal falls came from Incidence and\neconomic burden of injuries in the United States; costs for non-fatal falls were based on claims from the\n1998 and 1999 Medicare fee-for-service 5% Standard Analytical Files. A case crossover approach was\nused to compare the monthly costs before and after the fall.\ninjuries. Direct medical costs totaled $0.2 billion dollars for fatal and $19 billion dollars for non-fatal\ninjuries. Of the non-fatal injury costs, 63% ($12 billion) were for hospitalizations, 21% ($4 billion) were for\nemergency department visits, and 16% ($3 billion) were for treatment in outpatient settings. Medical\nexpenditures for women, who comprised 58% of the older adult population, were 2\u00ad3 times higher than\nfor men for all medical treatment settings. Fractures accounted for just 35% of non-fatal injuries but 61% of\ncosts.\nConclusions: Fall related injuries among older adults, especially among older women, are associated with\nsubstantial economic costs. Implementing effective intervention strategies could appreciably decrease the\nincidence and healthcare costs of these injuries.\nFall related injuries are a serious public health issue\namong people aged >65 years in developed countries.1\u00ad3\nMore than a third of older adults fall each year4 5 and\n10% to 20% of falls cause serious injuries such as fractures or\nhead traumas.6 Non-fatal fall injuries are associated with\nconsiderable morbidity including decreased functioning and\nloss of independence7 as well as significant use of healthcare\nStates died as a result of falls,10 1.67 million older adults were\ntreated in emergency departments (EDs) for fall related\nvast majority of these falls (.99.9%) were unintentional.10 In\na study comparing medical expenditures for 18 leading\nmedical diagnoses for older adults, ``injuries and poisoning''\nranked seventh (after circulatory diseases, nervous system\ndisorders, mental disorders, respiratory diseases, digestive\ndiseases, and neoplasms.)11\nA number of previous studies in the US have estimated the\nmedical costs associated with older adult falls. Two studies\ncalculated only the costs for hospitalized fall injuries,6 8 one\nincluded costs for combined treatment settings within a\nlimited geographic area,12 and others examined the costs for\ntwo types of fall injuries--osteoporotic fractures13 and hip\nfractures.14 One study assessed national costs of fatal and\nreported that direct medical costs and productivity losses\nIn addition to being dated, these studies were limited by\nthe populations they included, the modeling techniques used\nto estimate unit medical costs, and the degree to which they\nwere able to stratify costs by key injury characteristics. This\nstudy provides estimates of the costs of fatal and non-fatal\nfalls in persons aged >65 years using recent data to assess\nthe incidence and medical costs of falls stratified by age, sex,\nbody region, type of injury, and treatment setting.\nMETHODS\nIncidence and cost estimates were derived from a number of\ndifferent data sources because no single nationally represen-\ntative data set would allow us to estimate fatal and non-fatal\nfall incidence and direct medical costs. A complete descrip-\ntion of the methodology to assess incidence and costs of fatal\nfalls is provided by Finkelstein et al.16 A short summary of this\nmethodology follows.\nFatal falls\nIncidence data for fatal fall injuries in 2000 were obtained\nfrom the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital\nStatistics System (NVSS). We computed unit medical costs\nseparately for five places of death identified in the NVSS\ndata: death-on-scene/at home, death-on-arrival to the hospi-\ntal, death at the ED, death at the hospital after inpatient\nadmission, and death at a nursing home. Depending on the\nplace of death, the medical costs incurred could include\ncoroner/medical (C/ME), medical transport, ED, inpatient\nhospital, and nursing home charges.\nAll fatalities were assigned C/ME costs of $530.17 Deaths on\narrival to the hospital, in the ED, or after admission also were\nassigned the cost of one-way transport ($212) which was\nbased on average ambulance transport costs for injury victims\nfound in the 1999 Medicare 5% sample. For deaths on arrival\nor in the ED, we also added average costs for injury fatalities\nNebraska, New Hampshire, and South Carolina ED discharge\ndata.

HCUP-NIS includes discharge abstracts for 7.45\nmillion inpatient stays from approximately 1000 hospitals.\nFor all inpatient facility estimates from HCUP-NIS, we first\nmultiplied the estimates by cost-to-charge ratios provided by\nthe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and then\nadjusted for non-facility services\u00ad\u00adsuch as professional\nservices used while in the hospital but not included in the\nadmissions billing (for example, surgeon, anesthesia, physi-\ncal therapy). (See Finkelstein et al17 for a complete description\nof all adjustments.) For deaths that occurred in nursing\nhomes, we included the transport and C/ME costs plus the\nadjusted HCUP-NIS cost for an acute care hospitalization\nwith live discharge for those with the same injury diagnosis,\nplus the average cost of nursing home care computed from\nNon-fatal falls\nNon-fatal fall injury incidence included injuries that resulted\nin hospitalization with survival to discharge and injuries that\nreceived medical attention without hospitalization. The latter\ncategory included injuries that resulted in an ED visit, an\noffice based visit, or a hospital outpatient visit. Fall injuries\nthat did not receive medical attention were excluded from\nthis analysis.\nWe estimated the incidence of non-fatal injuries that\nresulted in medical treatment using the 1999 Medical\nExpenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for office based and\noutpatient visits. This is a nationally representative survey of\nthe US civilian, non-institutionalized population that quan-\ntifies the use of health services for approximately 25 000\nindividuals. We used the 2000 HCUP-NIS for hospitalizations\nand included records that indicated a live discharge and an\ninjury diagnosis in any of the first three diagnosis fields, and\nused the 2001 National Electronic Injury Surveillance\nSystem\u00adAll Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) for ED visits.\nNEISS-AIP collects detailed ED injury data from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of 66 hospitals. MEPS, HCUP-NIS, and\nNEISS-AIP include weights that were applied to generate\nnationally representative estimates. We limited our sample to\nthose aged >65 years.\nNon-fatal medical costs were based on claims data from\nAnalytical Files that covered services for about four million\nMedicare enrollees. The claims contained detailed payment\ninformation for all covered services for hospital inpatient,\noutpatient, skilled nursing, home health, hospice, physicians/\nsupplier services, and durable medical equipment. Our\nsample was restricted to beneficiaries aged >65 years. We\nMedicare HMO because Medicare does not collect informa-\ntion on the number, nature, or costs of their medical visits, as\nwell as people who did not have complete coverage for both\nphysician and hospital services for the full period of analysis.\nThese exclusions assured that we had complete claims for the\nremaining sample. We further excluded anyone who had any\ninjury related visit during the first three months of 1998 as\nthese may have been for follow up treatment of injuries that\noccurred in 1997. Finally, we selected the fall related E-codes\nfall related injuries.\nWe used a case crossover approach (previously described\nelsewhere)18 and compared the monthly costs in the\n12 months before and in the 12 months after the fall. This\napproach is a modification of the matched case control design\nin which each case acts as his or her own control. Because the\nfallers comprised their own comparison group, it was not\nnecessary to control for demographic characteristics or for the\ncosts associated with treating coexisting health conditions.\nTable 1 Incidence and costs of fatal fall injuries by sex, age, body region, and type of\nIncidence,\nCost (millions),\nAge (years)\nSex\nBody region\nType of injury\n*Column totals may differ slightly due to rounding.\n\u00c0Other region includes injuries of the upper extremity, vertebral column, spinal cord, and systemic/late effects.\n`Other type includes dislocation, strain/sprain, amputation, blood vessel, crushing, burns, and nerves.\nCosts of fatal and non-fatal falls 291\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nEach person had 24 observations, one for each month of the\ntwo-year period. We used a generalized linear regression\nmodel to estimate the monthly fall injury cost and summed\nthe resulting estimates to compute costs for 12 months for\nthose injured in the analysis year. We included a variance\ncorrection to account for clustering within individuals across\nmonths. Estimates were computed for total costs and costs\nstratified by age, sex, body region, and type of injury.\nRESULTS\nFatal falls\nincurred an estimated cost of $179 million. Both the\nincidence and medical costs increased with age and were\nnearly 20% higher for women than for men (table 1). The age\nspecific costs differed for men and women. For people aged\nwomen were similar ($32 million v $32 million). For people\naged 85 and older, men's costs remained essentially\nunchanged ($31 million) while women's costs increased\nWhen analyzed by body region, traumatic brain injuries\n(TBI) and injuries of the lower extremities were the most\nfrequent and costly injuries; these accounted for 78% of\nfatalities and 79% of costs. Two types of injuries, fractures\nand internal injuries, were responsible for 70% of fatal\ninjuries and almost three quarters (73%) of injury costs.\nHowever, 25% of fatal injury costs were attributed to\nunspecified types of injuries.\nThe pattern for fatality rates differed from that seen for\nincidence and costs. For all three age groups, the rates for\nmen exceeded those for women. Although rates for both men\nand women increased with age, the relative rate (RR = rate\nfor men/rate for women) was highest for those aged 65\u00ad74\nand lowest for those aged >85 (RR = 1.1).\nNon-fatal falls\nNon-fatal injury rates, like fatality rates, increased with age\nfor both men and women. However, women's rates exceeded\nmen's in each age group. The RR (rate for women/rate for\nwhat higher for those aged 74\u00ad84 (RR = 1.5), and highest for\nThere were an estimated 2.6 million non-fatal fall injuries\nwith a total annual cost of $19 billion (table 2). Although the\nincidence of non-fatal falls varied little by age, the costs\nthe same. Women made up 58% of older adults19 while the\nincidence of fall injuries among women was 2.3 times higher\nand the cost was 2.8 times higher than for men. Among\nwomen, the incidence of injuries increased 40% from ages\ndoubled ($3 billion to $6 billion.) However, from ages 75\u00ad84\nto ages >85, the incidence of fall injuries decreased 14% (from\n0.7 million to 0.6 million) while costs did not change. In\ncontrast, men had no increase in incidence from ages 65\u00ad74\nages >85, both the incidence and costs decreased.\nThe most frequent non-fatal injuries were those to the\nlower and upper extremities. Although the number of injuries\nwas similar, lower extremity injuries accounted for almost\nhalf (48%) of direct medical costs while injuries of the upper\nextremities were responsible for 13%. Fractures were both the\nmost frequent and expensive type of injury--accounting for\nTable 2 Incidence and costs of non-fatal fall injuries by sex, age, body region, and type\nIncidence (millions)\u00c0,\nn = 2.6 Incidence (%)\nCost (billions)\u00c0,\nAge (years)\nSex\nBody region\nType of injury\n*Column totals may differ slightly due to rounding.\n\u00c0Incidence and cost totals may differ because some categorical estimates were based on small numbers.\n`Other region includes injuries of the upper extremity, vertebral column, spinal cord, and systemic/late effects.\n1Other type includes amputation, blood vessel, crushing, burns, nerves, and systemic/late effects.\n292 Stevens, Corso, Finkelstein, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\njust over a third of all non-fatal injuries and 61% of costs. The\nsecond most frequent type was superficial injuries/contu-\nsions. Fractures and superficial injuries combined were\nresponsible for three quarters of non-fatal fall injury costs.\nMedical costs varied by treatment setting (table 3).\nHospitalized injuries were the most costly, followed by\ninjuries treated in EDs and in outpatient settings (outpatient\nclinics and doctors' offices). The highest percentage of\nhospitalization costs was for people aged 75\u00ad84; the highest\npercentage of ED treatment costs was for people aged >85.\nDirect medical expenditures for women, who made up 58% of\nthe older population, were 2\u00ad3 times higher than for men for\nall treatment settings. Women aged >85 accounted for 6% of\nthe older population and incurred 33% of the total fall injury\ncosts.\nWhen examined by body region, lower extremity injuries\nwere responsible for the majority (62%) of hospitalization\ncosts and the largest proportion (28%) of outpatient costs. In\ncontrast, injuries to the torso and upper extremities were the\nmost costly injuries treated in EDs. Among the different types\nof injuries, fractures accounted for 80% of hospitalization\ncosts and almost a third of outpatient costs while superficial\ninjuries/contusions were responsible for about a third of ED\ncosts.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study provides national estimates of the incidence and\ndirect medical costs associated with fall related injuries\ninjuries. Estimated direct medical costs for these injuries\ntotaled $0.2 billion dollars for fatal and $19 billion dollars for\nnon-fatal falls. By comparison, largely omitting nursing\nhome costs and looking just at the medical costs traceable\ndirectly to falls without fully capturing the costs of\ncomplications using the case crossover method, Finkelstein\net al16 estimated medical costs at $12.8 billion for the same\ncases analyzed here. One study found that 12% of older\nadults who fell subsequently required long term nursing\nhome care.20 Hip fractures are especially traumatic. Older\nadults who survive hip fracture often experience significant\ndisability and loss of independence.21 22 After hospitalization,\nmany hip fracture patients are discharged to nursing homes\nwhere up to 25% of these formerly independent older adults\nremain for at least a year.23\nOur findings are more similar to those reported by\nEnglander and colleagues15 who estimated the direct costs\ndollars). A recent study using 1997 MEPS data estimated the\ncost of fall related injuries among non-institutionalized older\nbased on a sample of 4000 seniors, used self-reported falls\ndata which often are underestimated.25 In addition, this study\nexcluded hospital patients and nursing home residents who\nare at much higher risk of sustaining fall related injuries than\nare community dwelling seniors.26\nInternational studies underscore the substantial economic\nburden caused by fall related injuries, regardless of the\nmedical care system. A recent study reported that, in 1999,\nED and hospital care for fall related injuries among people\naged >60 cost the United Kingdom almost \u00a31 billion (US$1.9\nbillion)3 A Western Australia study estimated ED treated and\nhospitalized fall injuries among people aged >65 cost the\nCost estimates differed by treatment settings. Of the direct\nmedical costs for non-fatal injuries, almost two thirds were\nfor injuries that required hospitalization, one fifth for injuries\ntreated in EDs, and one eighth for injuries treated in\noutpatient settings. Twelve billion dollars, or 61%, was for\ntreatment of fractures. This is similar to a study that used\nTable 3 Costs (in billions) of nonfatal fall injuries by sex, body region, and type of injury,\nHospital\nEmergency\ndepartment\n($4\u00c0) Cost (%)\nOutpatient &\nMD's office\n($3\u00c0) Cost (%)\nAge (years)\nSex\nBody region\nType of injury\n*Column totals may differ slightly due to rounding.\n\u00c0Cost totals may differ because some categorical estimates were based on small numbers.\n`Other region includes injuries of the upper extremity, vertebral column, spinal cord, and systemic/late effects.\n1Other type includes amputation, blood vessel, crushing, burns, nerves, and systemic/late effects.\nCosts of fatal and non-fatal falls 293\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nclaims were for fractures.27 These injuries accounted for 80%\nof hospitalization costs, 27% of ED costs, and 32% of\noutpatient costs.\nMedical expenditures for women, who made up 58% of the\nolder population,19 were 2\u00ad3 times higher than for men for all\ntreatment settings. It is likely that this difference represented\ntreatment costs for osteoporotic fractures, principally hip\nfractures. Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease that causes\nbones to become porous and susceptible to fracture and it\ndisproportionably affects older women.28 Women sustain hip\nfractures at a significantly higher rate than men29 30 and\ntreatment typically includes surgery and hospitalization,\nfrequently followed by nursing home admission and exten-\nsive rehabilitation.31 Although we could not identify specific\nkinds of fractures (the type of fracture is incompletely coded\nfor fatalities and ICD-9 coding is not included in NEISS-AIP),\nfor osteoporotic fractures were for hip fractures.32\nFalls are the most common mechanism of TBI33 and are the\nleading cause of hospital admissions for TBI.34 If a fall related\nhead injury occurs, older adults are particularly susceptible to\nintracranial hemorrhage, especially if they are taking anti-\ncoagulants.35 TBI accounted for almost half of fatal falls and\nassociated costs. Fatality rates from TBI are highest among\nthe oldest old, those aged >85.36 To reduce these serious and\noften fatal injuries, it is essential that we implement fall\ninterventions.\nInjuries to internal organs were responsible for 28% of\ndeaths and 29% of medical costs for fatal falls. The high\nprevalence of this type of fall related injury has not been\nreported previously. Additional research is needed to clarify\nwhy older adults are at risk of dying from these types of\ninjuries and how such fatalities could be prevented.\nAlthough the estimated economic impact is substantial,\ndirect medical costs do not fully portray the financial burden\nof fall related injuries. Our data did not permit us to estimate\nthe costs associated with lost wages and housework for the\ninjured or their informal caregivers, or for non-medical\nexpenditures (for example, wheelchair ramps), insurance\nclaims processing costs, reduced quality of life, and decreased\nfunctional capacity of many older adults who sustained fall\nrelated injuries.\nThis analysis has a number of limitations. We derived the\nincidence and cost estimates from different data sources\nwhich adds uncertainty to the total cost estimates. This was\nnecessary because no single nationally representative data set\nwould allow us to estimate detailed fatal and non-fatal\nincidence and costs. For example, Medicare data exclude\nthose in Medicare HMOs and therefore could not be used to\nestimate injury incidence. Our analysis quantified costs for\n12 months post injury. However, without additional analyses\nwe could not identify which services were responsible for the\nincrease in costs. Finally, most of the data sources were\nsubject to some reporting and measurement errors which\nincreased the lack of precision around the estimates, may\nhave introduced some additional bias, and precluded\ncomputation of standard errors.\nThe magnitude of this economic burden underscores the\nneed to implement cost effective intervention strategies. A\nrecent meta-analysis of the intervention literature found that\nfall prevention programs, analyzed as a group, effectively\nreduced the risk of falling by 11%,37 and a systematic review\nreported that multicomponent interventions for community\ndwelling seniors reduced fall risk 27%.38 Among people at\nhigh risk (for example, those who have fallen at least once\nbefore), clinical assessment combined with individualized fall\nrisk reduction and patient follow up was effective, lowering\nAmong community dwelling older adults, the risk of falling\nis 3\u00ad4 times higher among people with muscle weakness or\ngait and balance disorders.39 40 The most effective single\nintervention was exercise which, overall, lowered the risk of\nincluded Tai Chi,41 42 balance and gait training, and strength\nBecause falls are frequently the result of interactions\nbetween individuals and their environments, effective multi-\ncomponent interventions generally address multiple risk\nfactors.46 These might include risk factor screening; exercise\nor physical therapy to improve gait, balance and strength;\nmedication management (which involves reducing the\nnumber of medications, especially psychoactive medica-\ntions); education about fall risk factors; referrals to health-\ncare providers for treatment of chronic conditions; vision\nassessment and correction; and home hazard reduction.47\u00ad51\nImplications for prevention\nOur results show that fall related injuries among older adults,\nespecially among older women, are associated with sub-\nstantial economic costs that are borne by individuals, society,\nand the medical care system. Although research has\nidentified interventions that can reduce fall related injuries,\nimplementation remains limited. Additional efforts are\nneeded to successfully disseminate cost effective fall preven-\ntion programs, and to promote widespread adoption at the\nlocal level. By employing effective interventions, we can\nappreciably decrease the incidence of fall related injuries,\nimprove the health and quality of life of older adults, and\nsignificantly reduce healthcare costs.\n"
