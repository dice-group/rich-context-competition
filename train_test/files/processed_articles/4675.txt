Ganciclovir treatment during prenatal\nmice selectively killed cells with shared S-phase vulner-\nability and targeted expression of a GPT [golli promoter\ntransgene; GPT linked to HSV-TK (herpes simplex virus-\nthymidine kinase), t-eGFP and lacZ reporters] localized in\nPP neurons and their intermediate progenitor neuroblasts.\nThe volume, area and thickness of the pallium were\nmeasured in an E12\u00adP4 (postnatal age 4) longitudinal study\nwith comparisons between ablated (HSV-TK+/0) and control\n(HSV-TK0/0) littermates. The extent of ablations was also\nsystematically varied, and the effect on physical growth\nwas assessed in an E18 cross-sectional study. The\nmorphological evidence obtained in the present study\nsupports the conclusion that genetically targeted ablations\ndelay the settlement of the principal PP neurons of the\ndorsal pallium. This leads to progressive and substantial\nreductions of growth, despite compensatory responses that\nrapidly replace the ablated cells. These growth defects\noriginate from inductive cellular interactions in the\nproliferative matrix of the ventricular zone of the pallium,\nbut are amplified by subsequent morphogenic and trophic\ncellular interactions. The defects persist during the course\nof prenatal and postnatal development to demonstrate a\nconstrained dose\u00adresponse relationship with the extent of\nspecific killing of GPT neurons. The defects propagate\nsimultaneously in both the horizontal and vertical\ncytoarchitectural dimensions of the developing pallium,\nan outcome that produces a localized shortfall of volume in\nthe telencephalic vesicles.\n",

Our\nrecent investigations address these issues by a powerful\ncombination of molecular biological and neurochemical\nmethods for the specific identification and reasonably\nselective ablation of the principal PP neurons in transgenic\n2007). The proximal GPT (golli promoter transgene) of the\nMBP (myelin basic protein) gene exhibits early and restricted\nexpression in cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and sensory\nganglia. It can drive the expression of useful reporter genes,\nincluding HSV-TK (herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase), for\nthe structural identification of the principal PP neurons and\ntheir neuroblasts (hereafter referred to collectively as GPT\ncells). The GPT neurons match the morphological properties of\nthe principal PP neurons because they proliferate from GPT-\nexpressing intermediate progenitors confined to the dorsal\npallial VZ (ventricular zone), undergo radial migration with a\nneurogenetic pattern of `outside-in' settlement in the\nmarginal and mantle zones, emit the earliest corticofugal\npioneer axons and tend to show shorter periods of survival\nthan cortical plate neurons.\nWhen GPT drives the co-expression of HSV-TK, the prodrug\nganciclovir can be converted into toxic nucleotide analogues\nthat disrupt DNA synthesis in genetically targeted GPT\nprogenitors. This initiates apoptosis in their daughter\nGPT cells (neurons and/or neuroblasts), which complete\nmitotic division after shared S-phase vulnerability (Moolten,\ntransient and additive killing of as much as 90% of the\nnormal complement of GPT cells. As shown in the initial\nqualitative survey of the ablation phenotype, the developing\npallium presents a wide array of cell disarrangements that\neventually result in retarded vertical growth and mild\ndyslamination, early defects that may be exacerbated by\nlate-onset hydrocephalus (Xie et al., 2002). A subsequent\nquantitative analysis reveals the remarkable reorganization of\npallial GPT neurons and neuroblasts in the ablation\nphenotype, which responds to their induced apoptosis by\ncompensatory reconstitution of VZ progenitors, delayed\nsettlement of GPT replacement neurons with a near-normal\nrestoration of their total complement and failed emission of\npioneer corticofugal axons (Xie et al., 2009). We now deploy a\nquantitative analysis of the large-scale regional organization\nof the pallium in the ablation phenotype, in order to test the\nhypothesis that the ablation of GPT cells impairs vertical, but\nnot horizontal, growth within the pallium and its neocortical\nderivative. The developmental expansion of the pallium and\nits parts is compared in time series between littermate control\nand genetically targeted mice with equivalent exposures to\nganciclovir during the early fetal period of generation of GPT\ncells. For the first time, the number of ganciclovir treatments\nand the ages at ganciclovir exposure are also varied\nsystematically to determine whether the phenotypic growth\ndefects of the ablation exhibit a dose\u00adresponse relationship\nwith the extent of specific GPT cell killing.\nMany of the methods used here were described fully in\nJacobs et al., 2007). New observations were obtained from\nrandomly selected from 24 timed pregnancies [day of\nmating5E0.5 (embryonic age 0.5; as defined by common\nuse; technically, mice at ages greater than E7 are fetuses\nbecause the heart displays co-ordinated contraction), day of\nbirth5P1 (postnatal age 1)]. Data from males and females\nwere equivalent and pooled. Mice were housed in the UCLA\nSchool of Medicine vivarium, and procedures were conducted\nas per the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory\nAnimals.\nGeneration and ablation of transgenic mice\nEstablishment and histological identification of\ngenotypes\nTransgenic genotypes were produced using the proximal GPT for\nthe MBP gene to drive expression of linked, non-native reporter\ntransgenes for HSV-TK and lacZ galactosidase (lacZ; Landry et al.,\nmice was a fragment containing 1.1 kb upstream of the golli\ntranscription start site plus 0.2 kb downstream into the first\nexon of the MBP gene. Only one transgenic line was studied.\nDouble transgenics were generated by crossing hemizygous\nHSV-TK and homozygous lacZ mice to produce HSV-TK+/0/lacZ+/+\n(experimental) and HSV-TK0/0/lacZ+/+ (control, wild-type) mice.\nCross-validation of genotypes by PCR\nThe GPT/HSV-TK transgene was identified in founder breeders\nand all experimental mice by PCR using the MGTB sense\nand the HSV-TK3P antisense primer 39-GTCATGCTGCCCATA-\nAGGTATCGCG. The GPT/lacZ transgene was identified in all\nmice using the MGTB sense primer and the b-galactosidase\nPCR amplification, a 25 ml reaction was assembled containing\n,\n0.2 mM dNTPs, PCR buffer (Promega) and 1.25 units of Taq\nDNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). After\ndenaturation, PCR products were analysed on 1% agarose TAE\n(Tris/acetate/EDTA) gel.

For large\nablations in the main treatment group, pregnant dams received\ntwo intraperitoneal injections of ganciclovir (20 mg/g of body\nlesion effects, pregnant dams received ganciclovir treatments\non the following schedules: three injections on E11\u00adE12, two\nE11, one injection on E12 and one injection on E11 (genotypes,\ntreatment ages and ganciclovir treatment schedules shown in\nFigure 9). Treatment age groups were selected due to positive\nexpression of HSV-TK in pallial VZ progenitors of unablated\nmice that received vehicle instead of ganciclovir on E11\u00adE12, or\nganciclovir on E14\u00adE17, had no damage. All mice were alive at\ndelivery as shown by spontaneous movement.\nHistological preparations\nTissue processing\nPregnant dams were anaesthetized with halothane and\nterminated by cervical dislocation to obtain fetal tissue on\nE12\u00ad16 and E18. Fetuses were delivered, brains dissected and\ntissues immersed in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and 4% (w/v) para-\nformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS fixative. Postpartum mice were\nanaesthetized with halothane and perfused transcardially with\nfixative to obtain tissue on P1 and P4. Tissues were immersion-\nfixed for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, cryoprotected for 24 h in 30% (w/v) sucrose,\nfrozen in OCTTM, sectioned serially at 20 mm thickness in the\ncoronal plane and mounted on subbed glass slides. The section\ninterval was 400 mm along the rostrocaudal axis of the forebrain.\nMice were terminated mainly on two age schedules designed\nto establish (i) a longitudinal time series for assessment of the\ndevelopment of the phenotypic features of the ablations and\n(ii) a late cross-sectional index age for assessment of persistent\nablation defects. For (i), mice from one small treatment group\n(two ganciclovir injections on E11) were terminated on E12\nand mice from the main treatment group (four ganciclovir\nand P4 for the time series from E12 to P4. For (ii), mice from all\ntreatment groups were terminated at E18 as the index age in\norder to obtain measurements after the substantial accumula-\ntion of growth defects, but before the later advent of\npotentially complicating processes of myelination in all mice\nand hydrocephalus in mice with severe ablations.\nlacZ b-galactosidase histochemistry\nMounted sections were treated in 0.01% sodium deoxycho-\n(pH\nincubated in X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galac-\ntoside) labelling solution [2 mM MgCl2\n16 h at 37\u00b0C followed by a PBS stop-bath. Method specificity\nof labelling of GPT neurons was confirmed by omission of X-\ngal treatment in `control' sections from each case. Labelled\nsections were used for co-localization experiments and\ncounterstained in some cases with Neutral Red (Figure 5;\nten cases), which optimized photomacroscopy, and/or Harris\nhaematoxylin (regressive method; all cases), for improved\nhigh-contrast recognition of degenerating cells, mitotic\nprofiles and pallial laminae.\nOther background materials\nAdditional serial sections were obtained from many of the\ncases and used for a variety of modern multiple labelling\nstudies included in our previous report (cf. Xie et al., 2009, for\ndetails of specimen production and measurement). LacZ-\nlabelled cells in control and ablated mice were compared for\ndetermining the impact of ganciclovir treatment on the\ndensities of GPT neurons, while pyknosis and TUNEL (terminal\ndeoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end label-\nling) labelled cells were compared for assessing the impact of\nganciclovir treatment on the densities of apoptotic cells.\nSections obtained from other control and ablated mice of\ncomparable ages were also used for double-labelling studies\nto cross-validate the developmental patterns of expression of\nlacZ and HSV-TK reporters in GPT neurons. Finally, sections\nfrom other control and ablated mice were used for double-\nlabelling studies to determine the ages when GPT neurons\nand neuroblasts were generated, as shown by incorporation\nof BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine). Data from these studies were\nused to quantitatively estimate by ablation group (but not by\ncase within each ablation group) the extent of specific cell\nkilling during the initial phase of the ablation, which divided\nablation groups on the basis of ratio instead of nominal scale\nvalues for parametric statistical analyses.\nMorphological analysis\nHistological differences were assessed by comparisons\nbetween and within genotype, treatment and age groups.\nObservations were obtained by light microscopy with bright-\nfield transmission illumination (Zeiss Ultraphot IIIB and Leica\nDMRXA microscopes). Data were recorded by analogue film\nand digital photography, as well as by camera lucida\nmapping.\nTrends observed by qualitative methods were pursued by\nquantitative measurements, mainly volumetric, horizontal\nareal and vertical linear indices of the pallium and its parts, to\nassess the statistical reliability of differences between groups.\nMeasurements were obtained bilaterally from each case in\nGrowth defects after targeted ablation of preplate neurons\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ncontrol mice). Developmental patterns of co-extensive\npallium and neocortex were bilaterally symmetric in all\ngroups, so measurements were averaged across hemispheres\nin each case. The pallium had a lateral-to-medial horizontal\nneurogenetic gradient reflected in the vertical extent and\ndensity of neocortical GPT neurons, so sampling sites for\nvertical linear indices were selected from its flat-mapped\ncentre where measurements approximated averages from\nlateral and medial limits. Lateral and medial boundaries of\nneocortex within pallium were denoted by distinct breaks in\ndensities of labelled GPT neurons near the cingulum and\nrhinal sulcus, while ventricular and pial surfaces were\nproximal and distal boundaries for volumetric and horizontal\nareal measurements (Figures 3 and 5). The laminar distri-\nbution of haematoxylin-stained cell bodies between\nventricular and pial surfaces denoted the boundaries of each\ncomponent for vertical linear measurements. Some, but not\nall, ablated mice had pallial scars, which obliterated all\nlaminar boundaries. These scars contained few if any GPT or\nnon-GPT neurons, so they were measured as a separate\npart of total values obtained for volumetric and horizontal\nareal indices. Sampling sites selected for vertical linear\nmeasurements were always in unscarred pallium to assure\nhomologous locations, well-lateral to scars, between groups.\nDesign considerations and scales of measurements\nThe logical status of variables and the nature of their\nmeasurements merited close consideration because of the\ncentral role of statistical analyses in the present study.\nDependent variables based on volume, area and thickness\nwere ratio scale measurements used to estimate the growth of\npallium. Ablation first served as a dependent variable to\nestimate the specific killing of GPT neurons during and shortly\nafter ganciclovir treatment. For convenience, independent\nvariables are denoted in italics in the remainder of this paper.\nablation was used subsequently as an intervening, independ-\nent variable to probe the relationship between the magnitudes\nof specific killing of GPT neurons and pallial growth.\nDepending on the requirements of statistical analyses, ablation\ncould be characterized by ratio or ordinal scale values. Age was\nan independent variable tested for the influence on the\ngeneration of ablations and pallial growth. It was characterized\nby ratio scale measurements.\nVolumetric measurements\nThe series of sections from each case was drawn by camera\ngroups; 64 zoom objective, NA (numerical aperature)50.09] or\nFigure 3). The boundaries of the pallium with neocortex on\neach tissue section, including scars when present, were marked,\nbased on microscopic observations of lacZ and haematoxylin-\nstained cells, and then measured bilaterally by planimetry\n(Teledyne Post planimeter; Figure 5, lines A-A9-B9-B). Areal\nvalues were expanded by section interval to estimate total\nvolume, scar volume (when present) and unscarred volume of\npallium, with a shrinkage correction of 10% in each of the\nthree measured dimensions. Values were averaged across\ncerebral hemispheres for each case and then averaged\nacross cases for each genotype, treatment and termination\nage group. Grouped data for each time series were compared\nstatistically, mainly by two-way ANOVAs and pairwise Student's\nt tests with fixed values of Pa\n(probability of type I error) ,0.01\nand ,0.05 respectively [one-tailed tests; the latter demon-\nstrated graphically by non-overlapping means\u00a1S.E.M.\n(X\u00a1S.E.M.)] as the criteria of reliable differences between\ngroups (Ferguson, 1971; UCLA Statistics Online Computational\nResource). The volumes of VZ/SVZ [the combined VZ and SVZ\n(subventricular zone)], which incorporated the pallial proliferat-\nive matrices, were measured and compared in the same fashion.\nPallial volume was further divided in each case in order to\nuncover regional differences in growth. For lateral versus me-\ndial comparisons, the boundary between the lateral and\nmedial pallium was the dorsomedial peak of neocortex. This\nlandmark had a relatively fixed position throughout develop-\nment, and was associated with scars, when present, in ablated\nmice. For anterior versus posterior comparisons, the boundary\nbetween the anterior and the posterior pallium was a midsection\nin each series. This boundary varied with age, had no surface\nlandmark and was often associated with the midpoint of scars in\nablated mice. The time series of grouped data were compared\nstatistically by three-way ANOVAs and pairwise Student's t tests\nwith fixed values of Pa\ntailed tests) as the criteria of reliable differences between groups\nFor brevity, only the decisions based on these analyses, with\nranges of statistical values and their appropriate degrees of\nfreedom (df), are detailed below.\nHorizontal areal measurements\nThe length of the pial boundary of the pallium associated\nwith neocortex was measured on each camera lucida drawing\nfrom the series of sections obtained from each case (Alvin\nPlan Measure; Figure 5, lines A-A9). Linear values were\nexpanded by section interval to estimate pallial total area,\nscar area (when present) and unscarred area, with a shrinkage\ncorrection of 10% in each of the two measured dimensions.\nValues were averaged across cerebral hemispheres for each\ncase and then averaged across cases for each genotype,\ntreatment and termination age group. Grouped data for each\ntime series were compared statistically, as detailed above. VZ/\nSVZ areas were measured and compared in the same fashion\nusing the length of the ventricular boundary of the pallium\nunderlying neocortex (Figure 5, lines B-B9).\nVertical thickness measurements\nThe thicknesses of the pallium and its laminar components\nwere measured by direct microscopic observations of a\nR Fisher and Y-Y Xie\n260 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nsampling line placed between, and orthogonal to, the pial and\nive, NA50.65) of a midsection in the series obtained from\neach case (Figure 5, lines C-C9). Linear values were expanded\nby a shrinkage correction of 10% in the measured dimension.\nValues were averaged across cerebral hemispheres for each\ncase and then averaged across cases for each genotype,\ntreatment and termination age group. Grouped data for each\ntime series were compared statistically, as detailed above.\nCell densities were also measured in the developing laminar\ncomponents of the pallium. Intercepts of cells with nuclear\nprofiles were detected by light microscopy (640 objective,\ncomponent, cell intercepts were counted along a measurement\nline (143 mm) placed horizontally to the vertical sampling line in\na midsection from each case. Values were expanded by a\nshrinkage correction of 10% in the measured dimension, and an\nAbercrombie correction of 0.8 consistent with a 20 mm section\nthickness and an average nuclear diameter of 5 mm (Guillery,\n2002). Values were extrapolated to yield cell density per mm of\ntissue measured, averaged across cerebral hemispheres for each\ncase, and then averaged across cases for each genotype,\ntreatment and age group. Grouped data for each time series\nwere compared statistically, as detailed above.\nRESULTS\nCharacterization of ablations\nGPT cells in the dorsal pallium proved to be the exclusive\ntargets for specific killing. Neocortical GPT neurons were\nnormally generated by neuroblasts (intermediate progenitor\ncells that also expressed GPT) with restricted locations in the\ninitial ablation phenotype, as defined by transient excesses of\napoptotic GPT cells (Van Cruchten and Van den Broek, 2002;\nD'Herde et al., 2003), was observed only in experimental mice\nwith ganciclovir treatments on E11\u00adE13, in accord with a\ngenetically targeted attack on GPT intermediate progenitors.\nAll mice that met these three necessary and sufficient\nconditions had an ablation, while all mice that failed to meet\neven one condition had no ablation. Thus the occurrence of\nthe ablation phenotype was reliably determined by three\nindependent variables and/or their interactions: genotype,\nganciclovir treatment and age at treatment.\nLongitudinal comparisons of control and ablated mice\nshowed that the full expression of the pallial ablation\nphenotype was generated in three sequential phases of\napoptosis and accumulation of GPT neurons (Xie et al., 2009).\nThe first phase of massive early\u00adonset apoptosis in the\nventricular and mantle zones occurred during and shortly\nafter ganciclovir treatments on E11\u00adE13, coincident with\nsuppressed accumulation of GPT neurons in the mantle zone.\nA second phase of middle-onset apoptosis restored normal\nbackground levels of cell death on E14\u00adE16, coincident with\nreconstitution of the VZ and replacement of GPT neurons in\nthe mantle zone. The third phase of late-onset apoptosis\nresumed moderately elevated levels of cell death, coincident\nwith slow dissolution of GPT neurons in the mantle zone after\nE16. Growth defects, which were inherent to the full ablation\nphenotype, began in the first phase and progressed\nthereafter. They involved both GPT and non-GPT cells.\nThe effective combinations of genotype, ganciclovir\ntreatment and age at treatment had a dose\u00adresponse\nrelationship with the initial, transient reductions of pallial\nGPT neurons, concomitant with their specific killing, in\nablated mice (Xie et al., 2009). Treatments at 12 h intervals\nproduced additive serial ablations. Each treatment reduced the\naccumulation of viable GPT neurons in the subsequent 12 h\nperiod to 10% of GPT neurons normally generated by the cohort\nof GPT neuroblasts available at the beginning of the period,\nas shown by BrdU incorporation (i.e. at this stage of the\nablation phenotype, the principal constraint on the extent of\nspecific killing was the number of vulnerable target cells\npresent at the age of ganciclovir exposure). As shown by\npyknosis and TUNEL, the simultaneous accumulation of killed\ncells doubled the proportion of `missing' GPT cells\ngenetically targeted ablation was a selective attack on GPT\nintermediate progenitors, which gave rise by asymmetric cell\ndivision to daughter GPT neuroblasts and GPT neurons\n2008). As derivative values calculated from these observa-\ntions, ablated mice with two E11 treatments and E12\ntermination had a predicted 90% reduction of GPT neurons\ntreatments and E13 termination had a predicted 90%\nreduction of GPT neurons normally present on E13. Ablated\ncomplement of GPT neurons normally present on E14 (after\nproliferative exhaustion of normal GPT neuroblasts on E13).\nFor the longitudinal study, data were pooled and ablated mice\nat all termination ages were considered to have minimum\npermanent 81% reductions of original (but not replacement\nor permanent total) complements of GPT neurons. For the\ncross-sectional study, permanent reductions of original\ncomplements of GPT neurons in ablation groups were: 81%\ntreatment) and 9% (two E13 treatments). The derivative\npredictions were cross-validated by direct observations from\nfour key groups of mice. Average densities of GPT neurons\nwere expanded by volumes of unscarred neocortex and then\ncompared between control and ablated mice terminated at\nages during and shortly after ganciclovir treatment. After two\nganciclovir treatments on E11, ablated mice terminated on\nGrowth defects after targeted ablation of preplate neurons\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nE12 had an 84% reduction in the complement of GPT neurons\nablated mice terminated on E13 had an 83% reduction in the\ncomplement of GPT neurons normally present on E13. After\nhad a 56% reduction due to replacement of GPT neurons\nkilled on E11, absence of GPT neurons killed on E12 (45%) and\ndelayed settlement of GPT neurons normally generated on E13\n(10%). After two treatments on E12, ablated mice terminated\non E14 had a 54% reduction due to unablated GPT neurons\ngenerated on E11, absence of GPT neurons killed on E12 (45%)\nand delayed settlement of GPT neurons normally generated on\nE13 (10%). Minor differences between predicted and observed\nneuron reductions at 24 h after the end of ganciclovir\ntreatments were due to misclassification of cells in early\nstages of apoptosis. By E14, most of the specifically killed\napoptotic cells were cleared from the pallium.\nLongitudinal study of growth reduction in the\ndorsal pallium of ablated mice\nThe most important results of the present paper are shown in\nFigures 1(A)\u00ad1(C), where pallial volume, area (at the pial\nsurface) and thickness were plotted against age groups and\ncompared between ablation groups in the longitudinal study.\nTwo-way ANOVAs demonstrated the overall statistical\n,0.01) main effects, and the ablation6age\narea and thickness between E12 and P4. Growth of all\ndependent variables occurred as an additive function of age\nin control and ablated mice, regardless of the source of\nvolume and area measurements in total (scarred plus\nunscarred) or unscarred pallium (Figures 1A and 1B). Within\nthe additive function of age in ablated mice, pallial growth\nwas also progressively reduced regardless of scar inclusion.\nGraphic comparisons at each age level showed statistically\nreliable differences between control and ablated mice for the\ncumulative growth of all three dependent variables on and\nPa\n,0.05). No reliable differences were obtained between\ncerebral hemispheres on any of these measurements.\nThe graphs also demonstrate that statistical requirements\nof homogeneity of variance and linearity were fulfilled for all\ndependent variables in the tested study period. Thus ANOVA\ncoefficients of determination for volume (control versus\nablated total pallium R250.82; control versus ablated\nunscarred pallium R250.79) represented the total propor-\ntions of variance due to ablation and age main effects, and\nthe ablation6age interaction. Slightly greater R2 values\nwere obtained for surface area (control versus ablated total\npallium R250.89; control versus ablated unscarred pal-\nlium R250.85) and thickness (control versus ablated pallium\nR250.91). These robust values revealed the sufficiency of a\nlinear model with two main effects to account for the\ndifferences observed between the groups.\nThe trends for all three dependent variables had early\ndeflections (`hinge regions') that reflected stalled growth, but\nnot tissue loss, in the ablated pallium between E11 and E13,\ncoincident with the first phase of apoptosis associated with\nthe specific killing of GPT neurons (Figure 1). Late deflections\nreflected a second period of stalled growth of volume and\narea in the ablated pallium between E15 and E16, near the\nclose of the second phase of suppressed apoptosis associated\nwith the restoration of GPT neurons. The relatively small scale\nof these deflections did not hamper linear regression of\ndependent variables with age, which generated predicted E11\n`pretreatment' values and slopes, a useful single-value\nindicator of growth rate.\nQuantitative volume defects\nmeasured cumulative growth of 2796% (calculated from P4\u00ad\nE12/E12 values; Figure 1A). Volume was reliably correlated\nwith age (Pearson product\u00admoment correlation coefficient\n,0.05) with a growth rate (identical with\nthe slope of the linear regression equation) of 1.10 mm3/day.\nPallial total volume in ablated mice increased from\nmeasured cumulative growth of 1856%. The total volume was\ngrowth rate of 0.52 mm3/day, less than half of the control\npredicted E11 control value) yielded a cumulative growth of\n1856% in ablated mice. At P4, the predicted total volume in\nablated mice was 52% of the control value, similar to an\nobserved reduction to 53% (i.e. a 47% growth shortfall).\nPallial unscarred volume in ablated mice increased from\nmeasured cumulative growth of 1528%.

Within spatial constraints (i.e.\npallium developed as a curved, truncated, conical hemisec-\ntion, not a flat, semicircular plate), volume was an\napproximate product of surface area and thickness.

It is notoriously difficult for human observers to\nassess numerical magnitudes of volume differences based\nsolely on visual inspection, but pallial volume in each series\nfor both groups clearly increased with age. Furthermore,\npallial volume in each series from a control mouse was\ngreater than the volume from an ablated mouse of the same\nage. Finally, pallial surface area and thickness varied in\nassociation with pallial total volume throughout the\ncomposite, so representative observations were congruent\nwith quantitative measurements. The reconstructions also\nindicated that same-age control and ablated mice could not\nbe reliably distinguished by simple visual comparisons of\nvolumes occupied by telencephalic hemispheres. Ablated mice\nshowed no gross microcephaly or microtelencephaly, even\nthough relative volumes of lateral ventricles increased after\nE18 as a sign of progressive hydrocephalus.\nFigure 4 is a composite of average surface area measure-\nments reconstructed from control and ablated mice from\nE12\u00adP4. Mapped measurements from serial sections were\ncentred and aligned on the dorsomedial peaks of the pallium.\nThis protocol did not accurately reflect the posterior\ndivergence of supratentorial portions of telencephalic vesicles\nfrom the midline (Valverde, 1998), but it better represented\nthe narrow alignment of scars, when present, between medial\nand lateral pallial divisions. Pallial superficial (pial) and deep\n(ventricular) areas were aligned and superimposed, with scars\ndesignated in ablated mice. In flat maps, pallial areas\nincreased with age in both groups, although the extent of\ngrowth was reduced in the ablated group. Once more, graphic\nresults agreed with quantitative measurements. They clearly\nshowed the spatial association between scars and the central\nregion of the pallial VZ in ablated mice, with gross expansion\nof the VZ after E18, and scars after P1.\nSerial section and flat map reconstructions allowed\njudicious selection of representative sections for tests of\nadditional, perhaps more efficient, measurements.

Pallial areas outlined in control mice were greater\nthan areas outlined in same-age ablated mice. Pallial lengths at\nthe pial surfaces in control mice were greater than lengths in\nablated mice. Pallial thicknesses in control mice were greater\nthan thicknesses in ablated mice. Taken together, these\nmacroscopic results corresponded to the results of quantitative\nmeasurements. But these specimens also uncovered the\ndistribution and density of GPT neurons within the pallium,\nshown here during their second phase of replacement and\napparent excess density when viewed next to same-age control\ntissue. This pallial pattern of replacement GPT neurons\npresented a second paradox because, compared with E14 control\nmice, the average measured density of GPT neurons/mm3 of\npallium was only 17% greater, and the total complement of\npallial GPT neurons was 57% less, in E14 ablated mice.

Thickness increased with age for all\nlaminae in control and ablated mice except the VZ/SVZ, where\nthickness increased then decreased with age due to early\nelaboration and subsequent exhaustion of the proliferative\nmatrix (Figure 6A). Growth of the thickness of all laminae was\nprogressively reduced in ablated mice. Relative magnitudes of\ndifferences of laminar thickness between control and ablated\nmice were always least in the marginal zone, and greatest in\nthe IZ after E18. Most trends for laminar thickness had\nsignificant departures from the linearity assumption used by\nANOVA models. The model was robust with regard to such\nviolations, and its results were, for the most part, validated\ngraphically by reliable differences between same-age control\nand ablated mice. Yet, such non-linear trends precluded\ncomparisons of ANOVA coefficients of determination and\ngrowth rates obtained by linear regression.\nDefective laminar growth was associated with increased\ncell density in the unscarred pallium of ablated mice. Within\nthe neocortex proper (PP/SP, CP/P and CP/D), the majority\nof the cells were neurons derived from the underlying VZ/SVZ\nfor the E12\u00adP4 study period.

GPT is unusual for its early and\ncontinued expression during cell lineage progression from\nneuroblast to neuron stages (and its absence in other\npreceding or concurrent precursors invulnerable to the\npresent genetically targeted ablation), as well as its wide\nhorizontal extent in the pallial proliferative matrix (Osheroff\nmodern view of one of the largest structural components in\nmammalian brain consistent with the organizational scheme\nmolecular marker characterizes the most dynamic phase of\npallial morphogenesis in mice, but may not be strictly\ncomparable with earlier reports based on different criteria for\nanatomical boundaries.

The subsequent, comparable peak values dem-\nonstrate a near-normal restoration of GPT neurons tightly\npacked into an unscarred pallium of reduced size in ablated\nmice. The ablation is remarkable because the targeted cell\npopulation is transiently reduced, but not permanently\nsuppressed.\nThe evidence obtained by the present study proves beyond\nreasonable doubt that genetically targeted ablation of GPT\ncells results in progressive and substantial reductions of\npallial growth in prenatal mice, despite compensatory\nGrowth defects after targeted ablation of preplate neurons\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nresponses that rapidly replace the ablated cells (Xie et al.,\n2009). Furthermore, these growth defects originate from\nthe proliferative matrix of the pallial VZ, in accord with the\nrationale of the mechanism of action of the genetically\ndefects accumulate during prenatal and postnatal development\nin a constrained dose\u00adresponse relationship with the extent of\nspecific killing of GPT neurons, concordant with the\npurported specificity of action of the genetically targeted\nprincipal PP neurons, and developmental delays caused by\ntheir early, specific killing and regeneration trigger a cascade\nof subsequent defects in PP, immature and mature stages of\nneocortex, the main derivative of the proliferative matrix\nof the pallial VZ (Bayer and Altman, 1991). These defects\nuncover biologically significant aspects of neocortical\nmorphogenesis (determinants of organic growth and form)\nthat are often neglected or inadequately characterized\nThe hypothesis that the ablation of GPT cells impairs\nvertical, but not horizontal, growth within the pallium and its\nneocortical part must be rejected. The evidence obtained by\nthis investigation proves beyond reasonable doubt that\ngrowth falters in the horizontal surface area at both the\npial and ventricular borders (as well as in the vertical\nthickness) of the pallium in ablated mice. Simultaneous\ngrowth defects in both the horizontal and vertical cytoarch-\nitectural dimensions combine to produce a localized shortfall\nof dorsal pallial volume in the telencephalic vesicles. These\nfindings expand and explain ambiguous, less detailed signs of\nimpaired forebrain growth reported after ablation of GPT\npurportedly with spared progenitors (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993).\nThree aspects of the present study are unusual and merit\nfurther attention.\nDetection of organic growth defects after\ngenetically targeted ablation\nModern combinations of molecular biology and neurochem-\nistry such as genetically targeted ablation can provide a\ngenuine experimental `dissection' of embryological develop-\nment through the selective elimination or enhancement of its\nexperiments are predicated on the subsequent, accurate\nrecognition of alterations in phenotype. In practice, large-\nscale organic differences in structural phenotype can be\ndifficult to identify and thus may be overlooked even by\nexperienced investigators. As shown here, cursory examina-\ntion is inadequate if it leads to paradoxical and potentially\nmisleading results. We resort to antique, but not antiquated,\nmethods of macroscopic morphometry from haematoxylin-\ncounterstained serial section reconstructions to solve this\nproblem by detection of pallial growth defects, and their\nplace within a developing organic context, in ablated mice.\nSerial section reconstructions at appropriate low magnifi-\ncations allow all aspects of an organ to be viewed\nsimultaneously and as a whole. Structural differences greater\nthan 20\u00ad25% are usually needed for immediate recognition\nof revised phenotype. Instead, barely perceptible growth\ndefects of less than 10% are evenly distributed across all\nthree spatial dimensions of the ablated telencephalic vesicle.\nSuch a widespread distribution of defects sustains the\nco-ordination of telencephalic and neurocranial growth, a\npivotal outcome for successful prenatal development and live\nbirth of ablated mice. Nevertheless, mapping and measure-\nment reveal more substantial differences limited to the dorsal\npallial part of the telencephalic vesicle. The volume, area and\nthickness of control pallium have distinct growth rates\nand levels of cumulative physical growth due to the different\nspatial dimensions that contribute to each dependent\nvariable. These indices retain distinct, but suppressed, growth\nrates and levels of cumulative physical growth in ablated\nunscarred pallium. All three dependent variables have\ncomparable growth defects relative to their physical\nmagnitude despite measurement by independent means.\nThis normalization for spatial dimensional scaling uncovers\na common shortfall of growth, approx. 50% of its potential in\ncontrol pallium, which propagates simultaneously as hori-\nzontal and vertical defects in ablated pallium, as shown by\nhigh intercorrelations of its volume, area and thickness.\nIn control mice, short-lived GPT intermediate progenitor\ncells in the pallial VZ are the exclusive source of its GPT\nradially in an `outside-in' pattern and settle as the principal\nconstituent neurons of PP neocortex. Between E13 and E15,\nthey are infiltrated and dispersed by proximal, inverted\nsettlement of early cortical plate neurons (destined for layers\nV and VI) to form trilaminar immature neocortex. By E16,\nphysical separation of principal PP neurons settled in\nmarginal zone versus cortical plate (i.e. true cleavage)\nproceeds with distal, inverted settlement of cortical plate\nneurons (destined for layers II\u00adIV) to form hexalaminar\nmice, cellular lamination is normally ordered in PP, immature\nand mature stages of neocortex. Dyslamination consists of\nhorizontal and vertical growth defects distributed across all\nlaminae, which are characteristically thin, densely cellular and\nobscurely bordered by projection axons and afferent terminal\nfields. The delayed settlement and tight packing of a near-\nnormal complement of GPT neurons into this smaller ablated\nneocortex merely emphasize the presence of the middle\nlamina of principal PP neurons as usually found during its\nSimilar growth defects, with thin lamination and tight cell\npacking, are also distributed across the subcortical laminae of\npallium.\nGrowth defects in the pallial VZ precede and are highly\nintercorrelated with subsequent growth defects in more distal\npallial laminae. During the first phase of ablation, VZ growth\nR Fisher and Y-Y Xie\n276 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nstalls due to ganciclovir-induced cell killing, which evokes a\nprofound structural reorganization of new GPT cells and\nmitotic precursors in pallial VZ. As dying cells down-size the\noriginal periventricular mitotic array, newly generated\nmitotic cells reconstitute as a paraventricular mitotic array\n(e.g. a thickened, porous plate akin to later-formed SVZ;\nhorizontal and vertical compaction, the reconstituted matrix\nincreases cell density in the VZ, with a concomitant increase\nin proliferative output sufficient to compensate for killed GPT\ncells during the second phase of the ablation. The\nreconstituted matrix maintains the normal sequence of\ngeneration for PP, proximal and distal cortical plate neurons,\nand replenishes by de novo proliferation the normal\ncomplement of GPT neurons. The compensatory response is\nnecessary for the resumption of pallial growth, which\nindicates that principal PP neurons are essential building\nblocks for the physical foundation of the neocortical\nassembly (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993). The subsequent cost of\ngrowth reduction indicates that the VZ proliferative matrix\nencodes, at least in part, the physical dimensions of the\npallium (Rakic, 2005). The original VZ template is reduced by\nspecific cell killing in ablated mice. The `gathering up' of\nthe reconstituted matrix limits the outward spread of the\nregenerated VZ template, diminishes the mobility of precursor\nand progenitor cells within it and translates into a horizontal\ngrowth defect in the somatic compartment of its neocortical\nderivatives (Walsh and Cepko, 1993). Concurrent destruction\nof radial fibres contributes to horizontal and vertical growth\ndefects in the somatic and neuropil tissue compartments.\nDying GPT neuroblasts lose their radial fibres. RC2-immuno-\nreactive radial fibres, believed to originate from neuronal\nprecursors but not intermediate progenitors at this stage of\nMolyneaux et al., 2007), are then grossly reduced as\nganciclovir-invulnerable, non-GPT-expressing precursors are\nrecruited toward production of GPT neuroblasts. The\ndecimation and disarray of the radial fibre network impair\nthe distal disaggregation of settling neurons and reduce their\nmigratory trajectory, but do not block radial migration or\nalter the normal settlement sequences of PP and cortical\nplate neurons.\nInteraction of development and genetically\ntargeted ablation in growth defects\nIf the only effect of genetically targeted ablation is\npermanent elimination of principal PP neurons, then pallial\ngrowth defects at P4 should be negligible because principal\nPP neurons normally account for only 1\u00ad2% of neocortical\nneurons at that age. Instead, the pattern of substantial,\nprogressive reduction of growth in the ablated pallium\nindicates that the initial defect introduced by the specific\nkilling of GPT cells is amplified by subsequent, faulty cellular\ninteractions. Large-scale biological processes such as assem-\nbly of mammalian neocortex are obviously the developmental\nproduct of many concerted factors (Waddington, 1956; Debat\ninteraction in a robust, two-factor statistical model to\nrepresent their cumulative effect. However, a stereotyped\nsequence of faulty, interrelated cellular interactions, where\neach step contributes to the composite interaction, is also\nbeginning to emerge. The natural occurrence of both the\ncomposite interaction and the sequence of its component\ncellular interactions is best observed during the in situ\ndevelopment of whole brain, since many of the component\ncellular interactions may be unavailable or inoperative in\nmore restricted cell and tissue models.\nAs outlined above, specific killing of GPT cells produces\nonly a few immediate changes, which occur mainly in pallial\nVZ. Excess dying GPT cells are temporarily stranded there, and\ntheir radial fibres are destroyed. These abnormal circum-\nstances down-size and decelerate horizontal and vertical pallial\ngrowth within somatic and neuropil tissue compartments.\nOf greater importance, they also initiate a maturational delay\nfor the settlement of principal PP neurons and introduce\na morphogenetic discontinuity into the radial fibre network.\nTheir destructive impact persists in the statistical model as the\nablation main effect, which subtracts across age groups from\nconstructive development normally represented by the age\nmain effect.\nThe ablation main effect triggers subsequent defects of\ninductive, morphogenic and tropic cellular interactions\n(Edelman, 1988), which join the composite ablation6age\ninteraction that increasingly subtracts between age groups\nfrom the age main effect. The earliest fault in the sequence is\nthe distortion of a close-proximity, inductive interaction\nbetween dying GPT cells and non-GPT precursors in the VZ,\nwhich accelerates and prolongs precursor differentiation\ntoward an intermediate progenitor, replacement GPT neuro-\nblasts. This compensatory recruitment is accompanied by\nfaulty morphogenic interactions that reconstitute the VZ\nproliferative array and further disrupt the radial fibre\nand vertical growth arises from the restriction of the\nreplacement VZ template, and the constriction of its physical\ntranslation into neocortex, as mediated by replacement PP\nneurons. The onset of these faults, and the ablation main\neffect, coincide with and are reflected by the early E12\u00adE13\ngrowth deflection.\nA faulty morphogenic interaction next takes place, most\nlikely between the degenerated radial fibre network and the\ndelayed replacement GPT neurons, which then fail to emit\nlong projection axons (Xie et al., 2009). These pioneer axons\nnormally guide neocortical penetration of long afferent,\nparticularly thalamocortical, axons (Molnar and Blakemore,\n2007). In their absence, thalamocortical projections, most\nnotably `specific' thalamic relay connections for sensory\nsystems, do not penetrate neocortical targets in an orderly\nfashion to elaborate characteristic terminal fields, usually\ninitiated in immature neocortex (Auladell et al., 2000;\nGrowth defects after targeted ablation of preplate neurons\nE 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nLopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003). The onset of this defect\ncoincides with and is reflected by the late E15\u00adE16 growth\ndeflection. The defect also extends to include associational\nand commissural corticocortical projections. Reduction of\nhorizontal and vertical growth arises from the decreased\nfrequency of axons in the neuropil tissue compartment and\nfibre tracts.\nA faulty trophic interaction then occurs between the\nimpoverished terminal fields of long axonal projections and\nneurons in mature neocortex, which curtail the outgrowth\nand branching of their dendrites and local axonal collaterals\nand vertical growth arises from the decreased frequency of\nneuronal processes in the neuropil tissue compartment. A\nfinal faulty trophic interaction proceeds between the\ninadequate synaptic connectivity conveyed by axons (afferent\nprojection and local fibers) and neocortical neurons, which\naccelerates the pace of neuronal apoptosis and reduces\ngrowth in the somatic and neuropil tissue compartments\nduring the third phase of the ablation (Cowan et al., 1984; Xie\naccompanied by gross neuronal degeneration in subcortical\nsites, such as claustrum, normally predominated by reciprocal\nconnections with neocortex.\nThis is not a full and exhaustive account of all abnormal\ncellular interactions that can take place in the ablated\npallium, where the normal pattern of gradual, smooth and\nlinear physical growth is largely maintained but progressively\ndecelerated.

In ablated forebrain, sequential cellular interactions\nunderlie a constructive compensation that sustains pallial\ndevelopment, but sets in motion destructive consequences\nthat limit its long-term success. In any event, the pathogenic\namplification achieved by composite interaction shows that\neven modest delays of 24\u00ad48 h in the settlement of principal\nPP neurons can lead to many, if not all, of the same\ndevastating structural defects claimed to be due to their\nselective, permanent elimination (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993).\nPersistence of growth defects after genetically\ntargeted ablation\nSpecifically killed GPT cells are clearly the nexus and\nintervening variable between experimental conditions (geno-\ntype, ganciclovir treatment and age at ganciclovir treatment)\nthat cause genetically targeted ablation and its long-term\npreviously uncharted, immediate dose\u00adresponse relationship\nbetween the ablation conditions and killed GPT neurons.\nContingent on this outcome, a subsequent dose\u00adresponse\nrelationship unfolds between killed GPT neurons and\npersistent pallial growth defects. Both dose\u00adresponse rela-\ntionships are important demonstrations of the specificity of\nthe genetically targeted ablation. However, the second\nrelationship is technically constrained in at least three\nrespects.\nFirst, values for the independent variable, killed GPT\nneurons, are derived as a constant for each ablation group,\nnot measured for each case within a group (although such\nobservations prove to be feasible, and consistent with derived\npredicted values). In view of this limitation, all between-case,\nwithin-group variance of dependent variables is currently\nincluded in statistical error terms. This conservative solution\nunderestimates the variance that should properly be\nattributed to killed GPT neurons. It also precludes multiple\nregression and factor analyses.\nSecondly, the trigger episodes for the killing of GPT\nneurons are superimposed on normal morphogenetic pro-\ncesses, which require time to marshal the combination of\nconstructive and destructive recovery mechanisms that lead\nto continued development and persistent, progressive growth\ndefects. Extension of the post-ablation survival period allows\nthe amplification of growth defects through sequential\ndevelopmental interactions, but their increasing complexity\ntends to dilute the dose\u00adresponse relationship between killed\nGPT neurons and growth defects. The step-like, stochastic\nclustering of outcomes for ablation groups with different\nlevels of killed GPT cells suggests that some faulty cellular\ninteractions do not contribute significantly to growth defects\nunless a minimum level of prior damage is attained (e.g. a\nthreshold effect), while some faulty cellular interactions fail\ncompletely if a minimum level of prior damage is surpassed\n(e.g. a ceiling effect). Thus it is reasonable to propose that the\n`severe ablation' cluster represents the full expression of\nthe true ablation phenotype, while the `mild ablation' cluster\nrepresents an intermediate version of the same ablation\nphenotype.\nThirdly, the genetically targeted ablation used in our\nlongitudinal studies is actually a serial lesion of GPT cells\nrelated to each ganciclovir treatment, which further\ncontributes to the clustered outcomes of different ablation\ngroups (Finger et al., 1973). The sequence and timing of\nepisodic killing of GPT neurons recruit distinct levels of de-\nfective interactions. GPT intermediate progenitors have a\nshort cell cycle of approx. 10 h and generate six to seven\ncohorts of GPT neurons over a period of approx. 72 h (Xie\net al., 2009). Killing of two or more consecutive, early cohorts\nof GPT neurons (36\u00ad81% losses of original complement), with\nminimum delays of 24 h for settlement of replacements, yields\nthe catastrophic outcome of groups in the severe ablation\ncluster. In contrast, killing of a single early cohort of\nGPT neurons (18% loss) or two non-consecutive cohorts\nof GPT neurons (41% loss), with a minimum delay of 12 h for\nsettlement of replacements, yields the survivable outcome of\ngroups in the mild ablation cluster. Groups in the severe\nablation cluster have impaired pioneer axons and afferent\nprojections, which appear to be largely intact in groups in the\nmild ablation cluster. This difference suggests that cellular\ninteractions underlying the outgrowth of sufficient pioneer\naxons for afferent guidance can tolerate short, but not long,\nR Fisher and Y-Y Xie\n278 E 2010 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\ndelays of settlement of replacement GPT neurons, which\nconstitute the permissive benefit actually obtained from the\nplasticity of precursors in the ablated VZ. The killing of two\nconsecutive, late cohorts of GPT neurons on E13 (9% loss)\nleads to a mild ablation outcome because cellular interactions\nunderlying the outgrowth of sufficient pioneer axons occur\nmostly before the cells are attacked.\nWe focus on the unscarred pallium of ablated mice because\nit retains sufficient structural integrity to preserve at least\nsome functional role in neural processing and transmission.\nYet, the pallium of severely ablated mice often has a second\nstructural component composed of scar tissue. As shown\npreviously (Xie et al., 2009) and now in extensive maps of the\nablated neocortical surface, these scars arise as a product of\nnon-specific bystander killing related to the early, avascular\narrangement of a limited site marking the pallial boundaries\nof distribution for the anterior and middle cerebral arteries\n(Marin-Padilla, 1985). Scars, when present, do not alter the\nconclusions of the present study, since measurements based\non total pallium (scarred plus unscarred tissue) and unscarred\npallium yield consistent and comparable results. However,\nscars exhibit a low level of growth distinct from adjacent\nunscarred tissue. They fill a benign but non-essential gap in\nthe development of ablated pallium until the late advent of\nhydrocephalus, after which the cellular fabric of both scarred\nand unscarred tissue is so compromised as to be unable to\nresist extreme thinning and ultimately fatal disruption (Xie\nTaken together, the new evidence shows that genetically\ntargeted ablations of the principal PP neurons can cost up to\nhalf of the growth potential of the dorsal pallium in mice, a\nspecies with modest neocortical evolution. It is certain that\nsuch losses produce significant functional impairments\nconsistent with the principle of mass action and the high\ndegree of cytoarchitectural organization normally achieved in\nof neurological seizures is not surprising due to the global\ndistribution, symmetric localization and insular nature of\nimpoverished synaptic connectivity in the ablated neocortical\nphenotype (Cepeda et al., 2010). Because of the extensive\nevolutionary elaboration of neocortex, a structural loss in\nhumans comparable with the severe ablation phenotype is\nlikely to result in gross microtelencephaly, with marginal\nchances for fetal survival to birth (Jones, 1997; Striedter,\n2005). However, structural loss in humans comparable with\nthe mild ablation intermediate phenotype is more likely to\nresult in survival. If asymmetrically biased to locations in one\nhemisphere, such mild forms of damage could distort the\nradial fibre network and contribute to the laminar alteration\nof cell density, neuronal disarray and pyramidal neuron\nmisorientation found in clinical cases of (neo)cortical\ndysplasia associated with intractable pediatric epilepsy\n(Andre et al., 2007). It has not escaped our notice that such\nearly defects are unpromising candidates for amelioration by\nstem cell replacement therapies, since even modest delays of\nsettlement of well-sited, intrinsically generated replacements\nfor principal PP neurons, derived from the same cell lineage\nas the original killed cells, lead to faulty cellular interactions\nand progressive growth defects in a comparable neocortical\nphenotype now characterized after genetically targeted\nablation.\n"
