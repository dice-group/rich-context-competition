In keeping with asset theory, liquid assets and\nfamilial assistance can help offset post-assault expenses and facilitate access to services. Homeownership, meanwhile, appears\nto have mixed effects on survivors' economic well-being. These findings suggest that the economic costs of sexual violence\ncan burden survivors with fewer financial resources more heavily than those who own significant assets. As such, these\nfindings shift the focus toward a dimension of inequality in recovery from sexual violence that is often overlooked in research\nand that may have implications for public policy and victim services.\n",

After enduring a violent\nrape, her performance at work suffered, and she lost her job.\nUnable to work due to trauma, Lil'Miss used her \"three to four\nthousand dollars\" in savings to support herself for a year and a\nhalf until she was able to work again. She also relied on her\nbrother and a close friend for financial assistance when money\ngrew short during her long recovery. As Lil' Miss' story sug-\ngests, sexual assault often triggers increased expenses (Miller,\nand decreased earnings for survivors (Macmillan, 2000). Lil'\nMiss' experience also illustrates how assets, such as savings\nand financial assistance from family and friends, can help sur-\nvivors to weather economic difficulties in the wake of sexual\nassault. Research in the field of asset development suggests\nthat modest financial assets can stabilize households facing\nadverse financial events of this kind (Sherraden, 1991).\nHowever, few studies have empirically examined whether\nfinancial assets play a role in recovery from sexual violence,\nand qualitative research on this issue is particularly scarce.\nTo address this gap in the literature, this study uses asset\ntheory and analysis of 27 in-depth interviews with sexual\nassault survivors and rape crisis service providers to examine\nhow access to assets can impact survivors' economic and\noverall well-being. Three types of asset are considered: liq-\nuid assets, financial assistance from family or friends, and\nhomeownership. This exploratory research makes two\ncontributions to the field's understanding of sexual assault\nand recovery. First, this study suggests that financial and\nfamilial assets can help to buffer the financial costs of sexual\nviolence and facilitate access to services. Second, by high-\nlighting the potential value of assets for survivors, the find-\nings suggest that the negative economic consequences of\nsexual violence may burden survivors with fewer financial\nresources more heavily than those who own significant\nassets.As such, these findings shift the focus toward a dimen-\nsion of inequality in recovery from sexual violence that is\noften overlooked in research and that may have important\nimplications for public policy and victim services.\nSexual violence can take many forms, including rape,\nattempted rape, and unwanted sexual contact or threats. In this\narticle, the terms sexual violence and sexual assault are used\ninterchangeably to refer to this inclusive definition of rape and\nother sexually violent experiences. The present study focuses\non isolated sexual violence, which is defined as sexual violence\nthat is not part of a pattern of abuse by an intimate partner.

Loya1\n Keywords\nsexual assault, rape, assets, economic wellbeing, recovery from sexual violence\n2 SAGE Open\nEconomic Impact of Sexual Violence\nResearchers have documented a range of economic impacts\nof sexual violence, including increased expenses and effects\non employment and earnings. First, Miller and colleagues\n(1996) estimated that each rape or sexual assault (excluding\n(e.g., lost productivity, medical care, police services) and\nStatistics, 2015; for state-level estimates, see also Post,\nMezey, Maxwell, & Wibert, 2002). Notably, survivors are\noften personally responsible for a share of these expenses,\nincluding the costs of medical and mental health care and\nlost wages (Chrisler & Ferguson, 2006). In addition, there is\nevidence that some sexual assault survivors need to move\nresidences (Elklit & Shevlin, 2009), which may trigger hous-\ning-related costs such as the security deposit and first and\nlast months' rent.\nSecond, sexual violence can affect survivors' employ-\nment and reduce their lifetime earnings. Survivors of sexual\nviolence often require time off from work (Tjaden &\nThoennes, 2006) and suffer from higher rates of unemploy-\nmentcomparedwithnon-victims(Byrne,Resnick,Kilpatrick,\nnumerous negative employment consequences of isolated\nsexual assault--including unpaid time off, diminished per-\nformance, job loss, and inability to work--all of which can\nlead to lower earnings. Similarly, MacMillan (2000) found\nthat sexual victimization during adolescence can diminish\nsurvivors' educational and occupational attainment, leading\nto lower earnings in adulthood.\nThese economic consequences of sexual assault are sim-\nilar to the negative financial effects of intimate partner vio-\nlence (IPV), which can include physical or sexual violence,\ncontrol tactics, and economic abuse (Adams, Tolman,\nBybee, Sullivan, & Kennedy, 2012; Browne, Salomon, &\nfield, there is also evidence that financial stability and\nhomeownership are associated with lower rates of violence\n(Benson, Fox, DeMaris, & Van Wyk, 2003; Brownridge,\n2000), suggesting that asset ownership may be a protective\nfactor against IPV. In recent years, policymakers and ser-\nvice providers have developed asset building and financial\neducation programs for IPV survivors, with the goals of\nincreasing their financial independence, self-esteem, and\n& Schnabel, 2007). This research and practice may have\nimplications for survivors of sexual violence outside the\ncontext of IPV; yet few researchers have considered the\nrelationship between assets and non-IPV sexual violence.\nThus, it is worth considering whether access to financial\nassets can buffer the economic impacts of isolated sexual\nviolence, including non-IPV sexual assault.\nAsset Theory and Related Literature\nAsset theory contends that asset ownership can play a crucial\nrole in cushioning economic shocks such as job loss, divorce,\nor unanticipated medical bills (Sherraden, 1991). This cush-\nioning can mean the difference between long-term economic\nstability and the cyclical revisiting of poverty. Asset theory\nalso suggests that asset ownership is associated with psycho-\nlogical and physical benefits and that it can have a transfor-\nmative effect on a family's class status. Although prior asset\nresearch has not addressed sexual assault as a cause of eco-\nnomic shocks, the research outlined above demonstrates that\nsuch violence may indeed trigger unanticipated expenses and\nlost wages. Thus, the principles of asset theory suggest that\nassets may play an important role in survivors' recovery\nfrom sexual violence.\nAssets may be tangible possessions (e.g., savings, real\nestate) or intangible resources (e.g., social and human capi-\noffer many benefits that income does not:\nWealth can be transferred to others, can generate income\n(through interest, capital gains, and rent, for example), can be\nused as collateral for loans and provides the ability to weather\ncommon financial crises, such as spells of unemployment or\nillness, in which income is temporarily disrupted. (p. 112)\nThe children and other kin of asset owners benefit from\ntheir relatives' wealth via financial support, gifts, and inheri-\nShapiro, 2004). Similarly, social capital--one's social net-\nwork--can also be an asset. For example, in times of need,\nrather than relying on public benefits and charities, those\nwith strong social networks can turn to friends and relatives\nfor emergency housing or help paying bills (Edin & Lein,\nWhile it is intuitive that those with greater resources are\nbetter positioned to recover from economic challenges,\nresearch suggests that even in relatively small amounts,\nassets can significantly improve a household's financial sta-\nbility in the face of adverse events. For instance, researchers\ndefine asset-poverty as having inadequate liquid assets to\nsupport one's household for 3 months at the federal poverty\nlevel. To be above the asset\u00adpoverty threshold (\"asset-own-\nthat asset owners are less likely to experience material hard-\nship following an economic shock than are asset-poor house-\nholds. For example, asset owners who experience involuntary\njob loss are much less likely to face food insecurity as a\nresult, in part because they can spend their assets to maintain\ntheir former level of consumption (see also Keating, 2012).\nImportantly, McKernan and colleagues also found that assets\nhave the largest protective effects for families in the two\nlower thirds of the income distribution, even though they\nown significantly smaller dollar amounts than the top third.\nTo the extent that sexual violence creates economic shocks,\nassets may help cushion such adverse financial effects even\nfor low-income survivors.\nIn addition to providing a cushion in the case of financial\nemergencies, asset ownership is associated with improved\nhealth and well-being for individuals, families, and neigh-\nborhoods. The beneficial byproducts of asset ownership,\nknown as asset effects, include improved life satisfaction, a\ngreater sense of control over one's life, increased future ori-\nentation, children's improved educational performance, and\nbetter health (Moore et al., 2001; Page-Adams, Scanlon,\nHomeownership is also associated with lower rates of IPV\nThe literature on assets and isolated sexual violence is\nlimited. Loya (2014b) makes a theoretical argument that\nasset ownership may be both a protective factor for sexual\nviolence and help survivors to recover because women can\nleverage their assets to increase safety and to access support-\nive services. Similarly, Myhill and Allen (2002) found that\nthe prevalence of rape among British women living in owner-\noccupied housing is half that of women in the private rental\nsector and one quarter that of public housing residents. This\nmay suggest that homeownership has a protective effect\nagainst rape, as with IPV. However, these differences may\nalso be explained by other housing or neighborhood charac-\nteristics, such as crime rates, social norms, or police atten-\nassociation between social support and improved recovery\nfrom rape, but researchers have not considered financial\nassistance from family and friends as a type of social sup-\nport. At present, no empirical research has examined whether\nasset effects extend to the well-being or recovery of sexual\nassault survivors. The present exploratory study begins to\naddress a gap in the literature by considering whether and\nhow asset ownership affects sexual assault survivors' well-\nbeing during recovery.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe data for this study are drawn from in-depth, semi-struc-\ntured interviews with 18 rape crisis service providers and 9\nsexual assault survivors. These two groups of participants\noffer distinct and valuable perspectives on the research ques-\ntion. Through their experience helping survivors overcome\nvarious post-assault barriers, rape crisis service providers\nhave access to a wealth of knowledge about the needs of\nsexual assault survivors during recovery. Importantly, rape\ncrisis service providers can offer information about patterns\nthey have observed among the many survivors with whom\nthey have worked over time. As a key feature of assets is\ntheir ability to prevent financial strain, service providers are\nwell situated to detect such effects by comparing among their\nclients. Sexual assault survivors can speak to the economic\nimpact of sexual violence in their own lives and whether\nassets played a role in their recovery. This sampling strategy\nallows for triangulation among different types of providers\nas well as between providers' and survivors' perspectives\nI used a purposive sampling technique to recruit service\nprovider participants in two metropolitan areas in a north-\neastern state. The sampling objective was to interview pro-\nviders from a range of locations in the rape crisis service\nnetwork so that respondents could speak to the experiences\nof survivors who enter the service system at various points,\nseeking a variety of services. I identified rape crisis agencies\nthrough referrals from the Department of Public Health and\nthe state's largest rape crisis center. I recruited providers who\nhad worked directly with survivors of isolated sexual assault\nand who reported having knowledge of the economic dimen-\nsion of sexual violence for their clients. While some provid-\ners worked with survivors of multiple kinds of violence (IPV,\nchild sexual abuse, and isolated sexual assault), the inter-\nviews focused on the impact of sexual violence that was not\npart of a pattern of abuse.\nI interviewed 18 service providers from seven agencies,\nas noted in Table 1. Within each of these agencies, I inter-\nviewed a director plus one to three staff members from each\ndepartment or specialty area, depending on the size of their\nstaff and scope of their services. Agencies offering more ser-\nvices are more heavily represented in the sample. Providers\nincluded lawyers, counselors, advocates, administrators, and\nthose holding dual roles. Providers had an average of 10.5\nyears of experience in the rape crisis field, with a range of 16\nmonths to 20 years. The majority of provider participants\n(15) were White, which generally reflected the demograph-\nics of their agencies. The providers served survivors at all\nstages of recovery, from immediately post-assault to decades\nlater, so participants offered various perspectives on the\nrecovery trajectory.\nI used a convenience sampling technique to recruit survi-\nvor participants. I posted flyers at local service provider\nagencies, college campuses, and a women's community cen-\nter. The Department of Public Health sent an e-mail\nannouncement to its statewide listserv, and rape crisis agency\nvolunteers and staff disseminated the announcement to their\nnetworks as well. I recruited survivors who were age 18 or\nolder and self-identified as victims or survivors of isolated\nsexual assault, using the study's definition: rape, attempted\nrape, or other unwanted sexual contact or threats since the\nage of 12, which is not part of a pattern of abuse. Note that\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

In addition, while members of the sample may have\nalso experienced a pattern of IPV or child abuse, the inter-\nviews focused on the isolated sexual assault(s) each survivor\nhad experienced since the age of 12. This age threshold was\nbased on the criteria used by the state's largest rape crisis\ncenter, which offers services to survivors age 12 or over and\nrefers younger victims to a child-specific service provider.At\nleast 1 year must have lapsed since the survivor's most recent\nsexual assault, with no upper time limit. This way, different\nsurvivors could speak about both their long- and short-term\nexperiences of recovery.\nI conducted interviews with 10 female survivors, 1 of\nwhom was excluded from the final sample because she\nviewed her rape as part of a pattern of abuse by an intimate\npartner. The survivors' basic demographic information is\nnoted in Table 2. At the time of the interview, survivors'\nincome levels ranged from less than US$15,000 to more than\nfrom 1 to 4 persons, with a mean of 2.4. Eight of the 9 survi-\nvors had been raped, while the 9th experienced a non-rape\nsexual assault. The mean number of lifetime sexual assaults\nwas four. Most of the assault incidents were committed by\npeople known to the survivors (acquaintances, intimates, or\nfamily members), but about half of the participants (5) had\nbeen assaulted by strangers. Survivors were between 18 and\n32 years old (with a mean of 24) at the time of their most\nrecent assault. The mean number of years since the most\nrecent assault was 17, with a range of 2 to 31. To ensure con-\nfidentiality, pseudonyms are used for survivors, and identify-\ning details have been changed or omitted.\nData Collection and Analysis\nAll interviews were conducted by the author and followed an\ninterview schedule that was developed as part of a larger\nproject examining the impact of sexual assault on survivors'\nfinancial well-being. In the interviews, participants answered\nquestions about what expenses arose in the wake of sexual\nviolence and how survivors paid for these costs. Drawing on\nShapiro's (2004) qualitative approach to the study of asset\nownership, I also asked participants whether they (or their\nclients) had access to three major types of assets: (a) liquid\nassets, (b) financial assistance from family or friends, and (c)\nhomeownership. Those who reported that they (or their cli-\nents) had access to assets were also asked whether and how\neach type of asset affected the survivor's experience post-\nassault. Survivors who had experienced multiple isolated\nsexual assaults were asked about the role of assets in recov-\nery from each assault. Providers and survivors were asked\nquestions on the same topics, with the exception of informa-\ntion related to personal experiences with sexual violence and\ncertain demographic items. Interviews were conducted in\nperson at a location of the participant's choosing or by phone\nbetween January and July of 2011. The interviews lasted\nTable 1.

Using Atlas.ti software, I coded the data on both a\npriori expectations (derived from the literature) and ideas\nthat emerged from participants'stories.Apriori codes include\nasset type, asset amount, and asset effect (an asset's reported\nimpact on the survivor's ability to cover new expenses,\nafford services, or endure an economic shock). Examples of\ninductive codes include assets improving survivors' flexibil-\nity with work and homeownership as a double-edged sword.\nNext, I analyzed the data by asset type and identified differ-\nent themes for liquid assets, familial assistance, and home-\nownership. Finally, I examined the coded data for\ntriangulation or divergence among various types of providers\nand between providers and survivors. In general, there was a\nhigh degree of consistency between the groups' responses.\nThe analysis was verified at each stage using peer examina-\nAlthough the small sample size limits the generalizability of\nthese findings, the rich data offer insight into the roles of\nfinancial and familial assets in recovery from sexual\nviolence.\nFindings: The Role of Assets in\nRecovery From Sexual Violence\nreported that assets--liquid assets, familial financial assis-\ntance, or homeownership--have a positive impact on some\naspect of survivors' post-assault well-being. However, the\nthree asset types seem to affect survivors' well-being differ-\nently. The data suggest that liquid assets and familial finan-\ncial assistance can help survivors to weather economic\nshocks and boost their sense of control and security, while\nhomeownership can have mixed effects on survivors' eco-\nnomic and overall well-being.\nLiquid Assets\nRespondents consistently reported that survivors benefit\nfrom access to liquid assets, which include savings, stocks,\nand bonds. Most providers (11 of 18) reported that their cli-\nents had drawn upon liquid assets during recovery, and about\nhalf of the survivors (4 of 9) had access to liquid assets\nimmediately following one of their assaults. Survivors\nreported that they owned from \"a little\" to US$50,000 at the\ntime of the assault. Although limited in number, there was\nstrong agreement among the asset owners that savings posi-\ntively impacted their recovery in ways that were consistent\nwith providers' responses. I identified three major themes\nrelated to liquid assets: These assets can (a) cushion eco-\nnomic shocks related to the assault, (b) increase survivors'\nflexibility and their access to services, and (c) help survivors\nto feel more secure.\nFirst, these data suggest that survivors can use liquid\nassets to cover their immediate expenses and cushion eco-\nnomic shocks, such as job loss and emergency expenses. For\ninstance, a lawyer (P102) described how her clients have\nused savings when their employment was disrupted:\nIf you get unemployed and if you have some savings, at least\nyou're not going to be destitute right away. It's just like that with\nany client. I mean, especially if they need time off work, they\ncan fall back on savings. Or if they get fired, if they get laid off\n[or] something, or if they quit, they have some sort of savings\nthat they can fall back on for a little while. If they don't have it,\nthen they can't necessarily focus on their emotional well-being.\nThat they have to think about how are they going to survive and\nsupport themselves and their kids?\nSimilarly, survivors who owned assets reported using\ntheir savings to get through post-assault earnings disruptions.\nFor instance, Lil' Miss, a 51-year-old survivor who was\nintroduced above, was fired from her job as a result of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related performance issues.\nShe lived off her \"three to four thousand dollars\" in savings\nfor 18 months until she could secure a new job.\nIn addition to job loss, unanticipated expenses, such as\nmedical bills, counseling fees, and moving costs, often arise\nin the wake of sexual violence. Participants consistently\nreported that survivors who own liquid assets use them to\ncover such unanticipated expenses. For instance, a lawyer\n(P110) described how savings facilitate access to services\nand allow survivors to benefit from victim compensation\nprograms, which reimburse survivors for crime-related\nexpenses:\nIf they have access to savings, it makes it much easier for them\nbecause a lot of these costs, too, you pay it up front, and then\nyou're reimbursed. So, I think the long-term effects are lessened,\nbecause they can pay it. They have the money, it's in reserve,\nthey can pay it, and then they'll get refunded or reimbursed. It\ngoes back into the savings, so over the course of a year, let's just\nsay, they're back at base level.\nIn contrast, those without savings would need to either\nincur debt to pay the up-front costs or forego services alto-\ngether. Indeed, providers reported that many of their poor,\nuninsured clients go without HIV prophylaxis because they\nexperience financial crises when ambulance bills (as high as\nUS$800) eat up income that was intended for rent and other\nnecessities. Survivors who were uninsured and had no sav-\nings post-assault also explained that they could not afford\nmedical and mental health care.\nSecond, in addition to buffering economic shocks, liquid\nassets can give survivors more options to access the services\nthey need without raising significant financial concerns.\nSavings also allow some survivors the flexibility to take time\nto recover, to focus on their emotional well-being, even to\n6 SAGE Open\nchange jobs or go back to school. For example, one coun-\nselor (P106) described how savings proved useful to a client\nwho had been assaulted in her home:\n[She] was able to move [to a new home] because she did have\nassets. It was a no-brainer. It was going to happen, and it\nhappened really quickly, and she didn't have to think twice\nabout it. And it was a huge relief. So knowing you can afford\nco-payments for mental health care. Knowing you could throw\naway every, you know, the sheet, the comforter, and the pillows\nand go out and drop a few hundred dollars for new bedding or\neven a new mattress. Knowing you could take two weeks off and\ndo nothing or go away, if you want.\nThis counselor described an array of benefits and com-\nforts her client was able to access due to her savings, includ-\ning the ability to move to a new home quickly. This stands in\nstark contrast to the challenges faced by poor and asset-poor\nsurvivors. For instance, many providers described their less\nadvantaged clients spending months on the waiting list for\nsubsidized housing.\nAnother provider, an administrator (P107), similarly com-\npared the flexibility conferred by liquid assets with the stark\nchoices faced by some asset-poor survivors:\nIt makes all the difference if they have it [savings] or if they\ndon't have it. If they have it, then they are still going to be\ndealing with all of those same issues, but they have that cushion\nthere. So if they need to leave their job and take a few months,\nthen maybe they can do that and get back up on their feet enough\nso that they can start a new job and feel comfortable doing that.\nIf they don't have that cushion, then they need to force\nthemselves to go to work when they're not feeling capable of\ndoing that. Or if they do lose their job or have to quit their job,\nthen they're definitely in danger of becoming homeless and\nincurring a lot of debt because they don't have anywhere to turn\nand any way to protect themselves and give themselves the time\nthat they need to get back on their feet.\nSurvivors' stories echoed these sentiments about how liq-\nuid assets increased their flexibility and options for recovery.\nFor instance, Lisa, a 48-year-old survivor, quit the job where\nher perpetrator worked and was subsequently unable to work\ndue to rape-related trauma. To support herself, she liquidated\nher US$50,000 in stock and sold the home she owned with\nher then-husband. These assets allowed Lisa to take a year\noff from work, then go back to college, and ultimately change\nprofessions entirely. Referring to the proceeds from her\nstocks, she explained,\nThankfully, it gave me an opportunity to go back to school . . .\nThat's in my 30s, you know, so at that point, [I was] just feeling\nas though, \"This: It's now or never. I mean, if I want a career,\nthen I've got to go back to school.\" And if I didn't have the\nsavings that I had . . . I mean really, I ended up being able to live\noff of the savings I had and live off of it for probably two and a\nhalf or three years.\nThese assets played a life-altering role in Lisa's recovery\nby opening up options for her to finish her college education\nand access a professional career. (Lisa's homeownership is\ndiscussed in detail later.) Other survivors in the sample used\ntheir assets to take time off from work, pay for counseling co-\npays, and access healing services such as yoga or massage.\nThird, participants reported that owning liquid assets can\nboost survivors' sense of control over their lives, increase\nfeelings of safety, and dispel panic about what would happen\nif they lost their employment. For instance, a counselor\n(P112) described this benefit, saying asset ownership \"affects\ntheir [survivors'] sense of safety and well-being. Okay, so, if\nyou have savings, then there's this sense like, `You're going\nto be okay,' or you have some control over the fact that\nyou're going to be okay.'\" Importantly, this counselor sug-\ngested that the value of assets goes beyond the knowledge\nthat a survivor will \"be okay,\" extending to her sense of con-\ntrol over that outcome. Similarly, another counselor (P111)\ndescribed the comfort one of her clients took in knowing that\nher savings kept her from being completely reliant on the\nincome from her job:\nIt wouldn't be the end of the world that she lost her job. She\ndoesn't have the stress about the fact that she might be too\ndepressed to go to work one day . . . There's this extra layer of\nstress that a lot of my clients get, that they start to panic around\n\"what if.\" So one of the things we work on [in counseling] is\nbeing in the present. They start to panic around, \"What if I can't\ngo to work? What if I can't do the work, what if I lose my job?\nWhat if, what if, what if?\" She doesn't have the panic about the\n\"what if.\"\nThis counselor suggested that much of the benefit of asset\nownership lies in the absence of worry about economic con-\ncerns, compared with non-owners. For this reason, service\nproviders are a useful source of data, as they may be able to\ndetect such effects through comparison among clients. For\nsurvivors, it may be more difficult to perceive such effects\nfirsthand. Indeed, a survivor's description of the effect of her\ninherited savings bears this out.\nJuana, a 28-year-old survivor, was first assaulted 5 years\nago and suffered a second assault at age 25. She first men-\ntioned her inherited savings in the context of her current\nassault-related medical bills, which exceed US$800. When I\nasked how she managed these expenses, Juana explained, \"I\nwas lucky enough that I was left some money by my grand-\nfather, so I have a little bit of a cushion that I can use. But\nanother part is I make sacrifices.\" She later explained that\nshe used this inheritance to support herself through college,\nto pay for all expenses not covered by her scholarship. Later\nin the interview, I asked Juana if these assets played any role\nin her experience following the assault. She responded,\nNot really, because they [inherited savings] weren't something\nthat I really consciously thought about, unless I was in kind of\ndire straits for money. I mean I knew it was there. I knew that's\nwhat I would use to pay my rent each month, but I didn't think\nof it as something I could use as any sort of luxury.\nFrom her response, it appears Juana did not readily recog-\nnize any additional security her savings conveyed post-\nassault. Yet, by noting that she \"knew the savings were there\"\nand that they allowed her to pay her medical bills, she implied\nthat her inheritance alleviated a potential source of stress.\nWhen viewed within the context of providers' reports and\nasset theory, Juana's story is consistent with the contention\nthat asset ownership is associated with an increased sense of\nsecurity. However, this example also demonstrates the diffi-\nculty of detecting or measuring this type of effect among sur-\nvivors and suggests the need for further research in this area.\nFinancial Assistance From Family or Friends\nThe second type of asset examined in this study is financial\nassistance from family or friends, such as providing money\nfor rent or offering a place to stay. The majority of providers\n(11 of 18) and survivors (7 of 9) affirmed the value of this\ntype of assistance. For instance, a lawyer (P100) explained\nthe manifold benefits of kin assistance for her clients:\nAny time a survivor feels like they have someone who is\nsupporting them, that's another person who can help them\nbrainstorm, another person who can sort of tap into their network\nof trying to figure out financially what to do, or it may be even\nmore tangible: Maybe it's someone they can stay with or\nsomeone who can help them this month, or whatever it is, [with]\nvery tangible things. A lot of survivors will move in with\nsomeone who believes them to [get] help.\nMany survivor participants echoed this lawyer's state-\nment, explaining that they relied heavily on family and\nfriends for shelter, food, and other financial assistance in the\naftermath of sexual violence. For instance, Brooke, a 35-year-\nold survivor, explained that she relied on the goodwill of\nfriends when she was unable to work for several years after\nbeing raped, and her family turned its back on her:\nI had friends who took me into their home and paid for--paid\nmy rent, paid for my food, took me places, basically treated me\nlike family for about 3 years. I probably would've thrown myself\noff a building if it wasn't for them.\nBrooke's statement speaks for itself as far as the impact\nthis assistance had on her life. Financial assistance also takes\nless substantial forms, including the comfort of knowing one\ncould rely on family or friends for help if funds ran short. For\ninstance, Jane, a survivor who was raped at age 22, explained,\nMy parents would have [helped me] if I needed it. They would\nhave supplemented my--what I was earning, if I needed--if I\ndidn't have enough for rent. But I was really sort of determined\nto try to--It was at a stage where I was trying to become\nindependent from them, and I was reluctant to want to ask for\nhelp. So, I tried to avoid that to the extent I could. But my--I\nmean my parents were willing and able to supplement if I needed\nit . . . You know, my dad came down to help me, and he helped\nme move.\nBy emphasizing that she knew her parents were \"willing\nand able\" to help her as needed, Jane suggests that this\nknowledge offered her comfort, even as she strove for\nindependence.\nBeyond the material benefits of such support, several pro-\nviders talked about how assistance from family and friends is\nimportant because it communicates others' belief in and sup-\nport for the survivor at this crucial moment in her or his life.\nFor example, a provider who held dual roles as a counselor\nand administrator (P109) spelled out the multifaceted value\nof familial financial assistance for survivors:\nIt provides them with money, but I also think there is this way of\npeople giving back to them. Somebody took stuff away and\nthere is this real [effect] . . . but it's [also] symbolic--seeing\nthose people are there for you when you're at your lowest point.\nSo, I think it's money, and it's really helpful. And I think it's\nalso--it probably is [as] good as any intervention. It's just like,\n\"Okay, people care enough to provide me with support.\"\nAs this provider emphasizes, economic support can repre-\nsent much more than money. Survivors benefit from both the\ndirect financial effects of such support, as well as its sym-\nbolic value.\nWhile familial financial assistance can be very important\nto survivors, many do not have access to such assistance.\nRespondents reported numerous barriers to financial sup-\nport, including relatives' inability to help, survivors' hesita-\ntion to seek assistance, and people not believing the survivor.\nFirst, a family's ability to offer financial assistance often\nhinges on their income level and asset ownership, and poorer\nfamilies simply have less to offer in this area. For example, a\nlawyer (P101) explained that unlike her middle-class clients,\nher low-income clients \"don't have family who have money,\nand they don't have friends who have money.\" Another pro-\nvider, a counselor (P106), said simply, \"If you come from\npoverty, you're not going to be able to turn to your family for\nmoney . . . And people who have families with less income\nare probably much more reticent to ask for any help.\" Lil'\nMiss, a survivor whose story is told above, may offer a help-\nful example of this. Lil' Miss grew up in a low-income com-\nmunity, and although she reported that her brother and best\nfriend would write her checks whenever she asked, she\nstruggled with homelessness and poverty for years after\ndepleting her own savings. This suggests that there were lim-\nits to the amount of help she was willing to seek or that her\nkin were able to give.\nA second barrier to seeking financial help is that survivors\nmay feel inclined to spare their families from the pain of their\n8 SAGE Open\nassault for a variety of reasons. For example, a counselor\n(P112) explained that her clients often fear that their family\nmembers \"will have a heart attack or suffer some sort of\nmental breakdown if they found out.\" Similarly, Sally, a sur-\nvivor who lost her job after being raped at age 23, explained\nthat she did not want to burden her recently divorced mother\nby asking for help:\nMy father died when I was a child, and my mother had gone\nthrough a divorce a couple of years before the assault, and so I\ndidn't really want to ask her [for financial assistance], and plus\n. . . it was really important for me to just feel like I was on my own.\nInstead of asking for financial assistance, she worked in\ntemporary jobs, earning a subsistence living for 4 years until\nshe was ready to return to full-time work.\nA third barrier is that stigma associated with sexual vio-\nlence can keep people from seeking or receiving assistance.\nIt would be one thing if they had crashed their car and needed\nhelp buying a new car. But of course when you layer on that it's\na sexual assault, there's all this stigma and shame and blame,\nand nobody wants to talk about it . . . So that many survivors will\nfeel like they can't reach out to their normal support system\nbecause of the issue.\nAs the stigma associated with rape victimization is wide-\n1999), it may serve as a significant barrier preventing survi-\nvors from seeking financial assistance from family and\nfriends. Survivors' willingness to ask for help may also\ndepend on the quality of their relationships with kin.\nA fourth and related barrier to familial assistance is when\nsurvivors'social networks do not believe or support them. For\ninstance, a lawyer (P100) described how this has affected her\nclients: \"So many of my clients do not have that option [famil-\nial financial assistance], either because they're ostracized by\ntheir family, the family knows the assailant and they believe\nhim or her, or they just don't want to tell.\" Several survivors\nin the study reported that their families and friends responded\nin this way, either not believing them or blaming them for the\nviolence. For instance, Brooke was kidnapped and raped at\nage 16 by a man she had met online. She explained that her\nfamily, friends, and community blamed her for the attack:\nWell, my mother decided that I was a pathologically lying slut.\nSo that relationship, crap as it was, was pretty much turned on its\near. My local friends, many of them didn't really want anything\nto do with me the following year, since \"pathologically lying\nslut\" went around my church youth group as well. I did pick up\nnew friends that year, but I lost contact with them almost\nimmediately.\nBrooke later dropped out of college out of fear when her\nperpetrator contacted her on campus. She was fortunate to\nmake new friends who provided her significant help until she\nwas able to support herself financially. Still, for survivors\nlike Brooke, having family and friends who do not believe\nand support them shuts the door on a potential source of\nfinancial and emotional support.\nHomeownership\nThe third type of asset considered in this study is homeowner-\nship. Ten providers offered information about the effects of\nhomeownership on survivors' economic well-being, and one\nsurvivor owned a home at the time of her assault. This low rate\nof homeownership at the time of the assault may be due in part\nto the relatively young age at which most of the survivors were\nassaulted. Survivors in this sample were between 18 and 32\nyears old at the time of their most recent sexual assault, with a\nmean age of 24, while the median age of first home purchase\nin the United States is 31 (Taylor, 2013). Despite this smaller\nsubsample, these exploratory findings may shed light on the\nrole of homeownership in recovery and help to identify areas\nfor further research. The interview data suggest that home-\nownership can have mixed effects on survivors' economic\nwell-being. Some respondents reported that homeowners can\nexperience a greater sense of stability, but many noted that\nhomeownership can be a \"double-edged sword.\"\nSix provider respondents and one survivor reported that\nhomeownership can be beneficial for survivors. However,\nthe extent to which survivors can make use of this benefit\ndepends on whether the survivor wishes to move as a result\nof the assault. First, providers noted that homeowners have\nthe freedom to make changes to their homes to feel safer in\nthe wake of violence. For example, a lawyer (P110)\nexplained, \"If they own their home, we don't have to worry\nabout working with landlords to get locks changed or any-\nthing like that. I guess they incur that expense, but at least\nwe're not negotiating.\" A second benefit of homeownership\nin these data is the potential to leverage one's equity to pur-\nchase services that enhance safety or aid with recovery. For\ninstance, a lawyer (P100) explained,\nI think the pro if it [the rape] didn't happen in the house would\nbe that you do have this asset, so that if you took out a second--I\ndon't really know that much about finances--but if you took out\na second mortgage, or if you were able to get a loan, you might\nbe able to leverage it to get some money to be able to take time\noff work or whatever it was.\nThrough home equity lines of credit, homes can function\nlike liquid assets, increasing survivors' flexibility and poten-\ntially cushioning economic shocks. However, this provider\nwent on to note that any benefits of homeownership are less-\nened if the assault occurred in the house:\nBut if happened in the house, I think it's a con because now\nyou're stuck living in your [house], and it's tainted. Maybe it's\nbeen your house for 20 years, like where you raised your family,\nand ugh, that's a mess.\nIn a similar vein, Lisa, who was introduced above, was\nthe only survivor who owned a home at the time of her\nassault. She explained that she felt compelled to move to a\nnew home after her husband raped her in the house they\nowned together:\nThere was no way I was going to stay in that house, because it\ndid happen in the house, and it happened where my stepdaughter\nheard everything. So, so, I wanted--I definitely wanted to move\nto a new [home]. This was in [a different state], and it would\nhave been very easy for the wife to keep the house. It's a super,\nsuper easy thing in the [state's] divorce court. But yeah, there\nwas no question, no question.\nAt the same time, Lisa also noted that the proceeds from\nthe sale of her home were important to her recovery. She\nexplained that she and her husband \"divided the investments\nand we sold the house. And I was able to use all of that to\nsupport myself and go to school.\" As she noted, Lisa lived on\nthe money from that home sale, along with her stocks, when\nshe quit her job and went back to college. Her college degree\nallowed her to pursue a new career as a teacher. Lisa rented a\nhome for many years, until she and her second husband pur-\nchased a home together. Lisa's experience illustrates the\npotential for homeownership to offer flexibility and security\nduring recovery, at least for a survivor who is willing and\nable to sell her home.\nHowever, seven provider participants reported that home-\nownership creates barriers for survivors in the wake of\nassault because owning a home is expensive and makes mov-\ning difficult. Many survivors wish to move for safety rea-\nsons, while others find they are no longer able to afford their\nhomes due to assault-related income disruptions. A lawyer\n(P110) explained, \"Often if they own their own home too,\nthey can't move as easily. That's their home, so if they don't\nwant to continue living there, they have to sell that home . . .\nyeah, now we're opening a big bag of worms.\" As this law-\nyer implies, selling a home is more time-consuming and\ncomplex than moving from one rental to another. The alter-\nnative process of finding a tenant and managing a rental\nproperty similarly requires time and attention, which would\nadd to a survivor's burden in the immediate aftermath of\ntrauma. Plus there is a chance that the house would not sell or\nrent, and the survivor would find herself forced to continue\nliving in a home in which she does not feel safe or which she\ncan no longer afford.\nAnother potentially negative impact of homeownership\nthat emerged from these data is the drive to keep a home that\nhas become unaffordable. For instance, a lawyer (P103)\nexplained, \"When they do [own property], it's huge. I think\nthat they don't want to lose it . . . It becomes this `die by the\nsword' type of a moment for them, even to the point of their\nown safety being jeopardized.\" This lawyer shared the case\nof an asset-poor survivor who had purchased a condominium\nusing a subsidized mortgage program. After being raped, she\ncould no longer work full time. The resulting reduction in her\nincome caused her to fall nearly US$4,000 in arrears. The\nlawyer explained that her client would likely never recover\nfinancially from this setback because she simply could not\nafford her home payments on her new part-time salary. Yet,\nthe client was doing everything in her power to keep the\nhome.\nRelatedly, an administrator (P107) noted that homeowners\nare not immune from the challenges faced by renters, such as\ndifficulty making payments when income is disrupted:\nIf the person owns their place but they still have a huge mortgage,\nI think that they fall in the same trap of \"How do I pay this\nmortgage?\" I mean, they may be able to hold onto where they're\nliving longer and not have to deal with, you know, \"What do I\ntell my landlord or don't tell my landlord?\" It's more about\npersonally how they are going to figure it out. So yeah I think it\ndoes help a little bit, but in the end if they don't have a lot of\nsavings to help them out, it might not.\nOther providers similarly talked about clients losing their\nhomes to foreclosure because their earnings decreased dra-\nmatically in the aftermath of sexual assault. These stories\nillustrate the precarious position that homeowners who are\notherwise asset-poor face when their income is disrupted.\nHaving a mortgage on a home is not enough; savings or other\nliquid assets are needed to cover housing costs in the case of\nserious income disruption.\nDiscussion\nThese findings suggest that financial assets, particularly sav-\nings and familial financial assistance, can serve as a crucial\nbridge to recovery from sexual violence by standing in for\nlost wages, covering unexpected expenses, and increasing\nflexibility. While asset theory has not previously been applied\nto isolated sexual violence, these findings are consistent with\nthe theory's central contention that assets can buffer eco-\nnomic shocks. Because sexual violence can create a wide\nrange of adverse economic events for survivors, these data\nsuggest that those with financial resources may be better sit-\nuated to recover from this trauma.\nThe idea that wealth inequalities inform rape survivors'\nexperiences contrasts with the common belief that \"sexual\nviolence does not discriminate\" (as an administrator stated in\nan interview). Advocates in the field of violence against\nwomen have long used this as an organizing idea to combat\nstigma and raise awareness that sexual and domestic vio-\nlence happen in rich and poor communities alike (Richie,\n2000). While the idea that \"rape does not discriminate\" often\nrefers to its prevalence across socioeconomic strata, this\nmessage ignores the potential for disparate effects for poor\nsurvivors. This study's findings suggest that the economic\neffects of sexual violence may weigh more heavily on\nasset-poor victims than wealthy ones. Hence, these findings\npoint to inequalities in recovery from sexual violence, which\nare often not considered in research and that can inform pub-\nlic policy and victim services. Due to the small sample size\nand exploratory nature of this study, further research is war-\nranted to gain a generalizable understanding of the roles of\nasset ownership--and asset-poverty--in recovery.\nThis study also builds upon and extends our understand-\ning of asset theory and the role of assets in recovery from\ntrauma in several ways. First, the findings suggest that liquid\nassets can buffer the economic shocks associated with sexual\nviolence and facilitate some aspects of survivors' subjective\nwell-being. Shobe and Page-Adams (2001) argue that assets\n\"provide people with otherwise unattainable opportunities to\nhope, plan, and dream about the future,\" which improves\ntheir social and economic well-being (p. 119). In contrast,\nthey argue, asset-poor people must work to make ends meet\non a \"day-to-day basis.\" Asset-poor survivors must similarly\ncope with the aftermath of assault on a day-to-day basis,\nwhich makes them more vulnerable to the financial shocks\nthat can follow rape. Those who own assets, meanwhile,\nhave the opportunities to plan for the future, to be flexible in\ntheir response to unexpected occurrences, and to take com-\nfort in the knowledge of those plans and options. By allow-\ning them to make decisions and plans, assets can increase\nsurvivors'sense of control over their lives. This sense of con-\ntrol may be particularly valuable to survivors of sexual vio-\nlence, in which the perpetrator takes away the victim's\ncontrol over her or his body (Herman, 1992). This is not to\nminimize the numerous negative effects of sexual assault for\nall survivors, asset owners or no, but rather to suggest that\nsuch ownership may facilitate recovery in important ways.\nSecond, this study's findings on the value of familial\nfinancial assistance and unequal access to such support\nextend asset theory's approach to the intra-familial transmis-\nsion of wealth. Shapiro (2004) defines transformative assets\nas inherited wealth that lifts a family beyond their own earn-\nings level, such as a single mother whose familial assistance\nallows her to live a middle-class lifestyle despite her own\nlow wages. Familial financial assistance for survivors may\nbe similarly transformative by opening options that they\ncould not otherwise afford, such as taking time off from\nwork or accessing costly medical services. In addition, just\nas Shapiro (2004) notes that White families are more likely\nto benefit from transformative assets than Black families,\ninequalities may also emerge in familial assistance for survi-\nvors. In the U.S., families'income and asset levels are highly\nunequal by race (Campbell & Kaufman, 2006; Kochhar, Fry,\n& Taylor, 2011), suggesting White families are in aggregate\nbetter situated to provide financial assistance to survivors\nthan are Black, Latino, or Native American families. This\nstudy was unable to assess the degree to which racial differ-\nences exist in familial financial assistance for sexual assault\nsurvivors, but it documented many barriers to familial finan-\ncial assistance, including poor families' limited financial\ncapacity. Future research should examine the impact of racial\nwealth inequalities on survivor outcomes.\nThird, these findings add complexity to current discus-\nsions of homeownership within the asset field. Adherents of\nasset theory report that homeownership is associated with a\nwide range of benefits to health, well-being, and safety. Yet\nin the context of sexual violence, owning one's home appears\nto be a mixed blessing. Homeowners may have the option to\nleverage their investment to increase stability, but this bene-\nfit is tempered by the possibility that a survivor may wish to\nmove from the home where the assault occurred. In addition,\nhomeowners can face the same concerns about housing\naffordability that arise for renters, but with higher stakes.\nThese findings suggest a need to turn a more nuanced lens to\nthe study of homeownership, particularly as it relates to\ntrauma and recovery.\nPolicy Recommendations\nBy noting that asset ownership can help with recovery, this\nresearch identifies a need as well as a potential solution. The\nneed I identify is that survivors of sexual violence require\neconomic resources to facilitate recovery. Existing wealth\ninequalities mean less privileged survivors may face nega-\ntive economic effects of sexual violence disproportionately,\nwhich suggests that policy intervention may be appropriate\nto create equitable outcomes. Importantly, many existing\npolicies address the economic needs of IPV survivors but\nexclude survivors of non-IPV sexual violence. If a woman\nwho is raped by her landlord or her boss deserves the same\nfinancial assistance as one who is raped by her husband, then\nexisting policies for IPV survivors need to be expanded to\ninclude all sexual assault survivors. The solutions lie not\nonly in supporting private asset ownership but also in poli-\ncies and services that can offer some of the benefits of asset\nownership to asset-poor individuals.\nFirst, IPV services often include economic components,\nsuch as financial assistance, transitional housing, and finan-\ncial literacy education (Lyon, Bradshaw, & Menard, 2012).\nYet, financial assistance services for non-IPV sexual assault\nsurvivors are not widely available, as most rape crisis centers\nlack the funding and staff to offer such services. State and\nfederal dollars should be made available to rape crisis service\nproviders to create economic stabilization funds for sexual\nassault survivors. The Office on Violence Against Women\ncould begin by funding pilot programs to identify best prac-\ntices and create a model for nationwide implementation.\nImportantly, service providers in the present study reported\nthat survivors often need relatively small amounts of assis-\ntance (approximately US$1,000) to maintain their financial\nstability and prevent homelessness. If investing this modest\nsum in survivors in the immediate aftermath of trauma could\nhelp prevent a downward spiral, this could ultimately create\nsavings for the state on homeless services, subsidized hous-\ning, and other welfare programs.\nSecond, small business development, or microenterprise,\ncan boost survivors' financial stability and empowerment.\nTailored microenterprise programs have been developed for\nIPV survivors (e.g., Pathways to Independence, The\nand such programs can provide helpful models for address-\ning the needs of isolated sexual assault survivors.\nMicroenterprise programs for sexual assault survivors should\ninclude trauma-informed and culturally sensitive training,\nmentorship, and seed money. Self-employment may be par-\nticularly appealing for survivors who have been assaulted in\nthe workplace or who have difficulty continuing their pre-\nassault careers for other reasons.\nThird, this study's findings suggest that assets can play an\nimportant role in recovery for sexual assault survivors. One\npolicy strategy for encouraging asset ownership among low-\nand moderate-income people is the Individual Development\nAccount (IDA). IDAs are savings accounts that offer matched\nfunds for asset-building purposes, such as homeownership,\npost-secondary education, or small business. Tailored IDA\nprograms should be developed for sexual assault survivors,\nsimilar to the ones that exist for IPV survivors (Sanders &\noften include financial education and a peer support struc-\nture. These elements can be designed to address common\nconcerns of sexual assault survivors, such as fostering peer-\nto-peer recovery strategies and sharing information on finan-\ncial assistance for crime victims. Beyond asset building, the\ngoals of these IDAs would be to help survivors both recover\nfrom past violence and feel safer in the future.\nConclusion\nThis exploratory study has applied the asset framework to\nrecovery from isolated sexual violence, a problem that is not\noften recognized as a source of economic concern for survi-\nvors. This study's qualitative approach allows us to learn\nfrom survivors and the people who help them about how\nfinancial resources can help to lighten the economic burden\ncaused by sexual assault. These findings suggest that liquid\nassets and familial financial assistance can help offset post-\nassault expenses and can facilitate access to resources that\nare helpful for recovery. Specifically, these types of assets\ncan stand in for lost wages and help cover new expenses that\narise as a result of the violence, such as medical fees, coun-\nseling bills, and moving costs. Both owned assets and famil-\nial financial assistance can also convey a sense of security\nand control over one's life. Homeownership, however, seems\nto have mixed effects. For some survivors, a mortgage can be\nleveraged to enhance economic stability, but for others,\nhomeownership is costly and makes moving difficult.\nSurvivors do not have equal access to financial and famil-\nial resources. Instead, unequal wealth ownership, as well as\nthe numerous barriers to familial assistance described in the\nfindings, place asset-based remedies out of reach for many\nsurvivors. These data suggest that the negative economic\nconsequences of sexual violence likely burden survivors\nwith fewer financial resources more heavily than those who\nown significant assets. Although private asset ownership\ncannot be equalized, public policies for IPV survivors can be\nexpanded to better meet the economic needs of all sexual\nassault survivors.\n"
