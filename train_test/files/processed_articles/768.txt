The purpose of the study was to examine religious attendance as a predictor of survival in older adults.\nMethods. A probability sample of 3,968 community-dwelling adults aged 64-101 years residing in the Piedmont of North\nCarolina was surveyed in 1986 as part of the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE)\nprogram of the National Institutes of Health. Attendance at religious services and a wide variety of sociodemographic and\nhealth variables were assessed at baseline. Vital status of members was then determined prospectively over the next 6 years\n(1986-1992). Time (days) to death or censoring in days was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.\nResults. During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,777 subjects (29.7%) died. Of the subjects who attended religious\nservices once a week or more in 1986 (frequent attenders), 22.9% died compared to 37.4% of those attending services less than\nonce a week (infrequent attenders). The relative hazard (RH) of dying for frequent attenders was 46% less than for infrequent\nmen (RH 0.63,95% CI 0.52--0.75).When demographics, health conditions, social connections, and health practices were con-\nConclusions. Older adults, particularly women, who attend religious services at least once a week appear to have a survival\nadvantage over those attending services less frequently.\nIN 1891, John S. Billings, then Surgeon General of the United\nStates Army, reported that religious affiliation was a factor in\nthe differential mortality he observed among social groups (1).\nNot long afterwards, Emile Durkheim in 1915 laid the founda-\ntion for such a connection by pointing out the potential health\nconsequences of weakening or absent religious ties (2). The\nmajority of studies of religion and health since Durkheim, how-\never, have been affiliational studies that have focused on the di-\netary and health practices of different religious groups [particu-\nlarly Mormons and Seventh-Day Adventists (3)].\nA number of epidemiological studies (4,5) and clinical trials\n(6,7), however, have demonstrated an association between so-\ncial support, better physical health, and longer survival. Given\nDurkheim's theories and the growing evidence suggesting a re-\nlationship between church or synagogue attendance and social\nsupport (8,9), a number of investigators have now begun exam-\nining the link between religious attendance and health (10,11).\nAttendance at religious services has been associated with higher\nlower blood pressure (18,19),fewer strokes (20), and longer sur-\nvival, even after controlling for social support in some cases. At\nleast seven studies have now examined the relationship between\nreligious attendance and mortality.\nIn 1972, Comstock and Partridge (21) first reported that fre-\nquent church attenders had lower death rates from arterioscle-\nrotic heart disease, pulmonary emphysema, cirrhosis of the\nliver, and suicide; these findings, however, were later explained\nby the fact that chronically ill persons attended church less fre-\nnity-dwelling persons aged 35-69 in the Tecumseh (Michigan)\nCommunity Health Study, House and colleagues (23) reported\nthat frequent church attendance was significantly related to sur-\nvival, but only among women after age and health factors were\ncommunity-dwelling persons (mean age 46) in the Evans\nCounty (Georgia) Cardiovascular Study for 10 years, finding\nthat involvement in church activities was also significantly re-\nlated to longer survival, but only among white males and black\nfemales once age and health factors were controlled.\nZuckerman and colleagues (25) followed 400 elderly poor resi-\ndents of New Haven, CT, for two years, finding that religious\nattendance was among the variables significantly related to\nlower mortality after sex and physical health were controlled,\nbut the effects were slightly stronger in men than in women.\nIn contrast, when Idler and Kasl (26) examined 4-year mor-\ntality rates in a sample of 2,812 community-dwelling adults aged\n65 or older in New Haven (of whom 624 had died), they found\nno association between religious attendance and mortality after\nself-rated health and other variables were controlled. Likewise,\nOxman and associates (27), examining 6-month survival in 232\nsubjects aged 55 or older following elective open heart surgery\n(of whom 21 had died), found religious attendance unrelated to\nmortality once physical health factors were controlled.\nIn the largest and best designed study to date, Strawbridge\nand colleagues (28) reported the results of a 28-year follow-up\nthe Human Population Laboratory Study of Alameda County\nthat persons who attended religious services at least once a\nweek had a significantly lower risk of dying after controlling\nfor demographic variables, health conditions, social connec-\ntions, and health practices (relative hazard [RH] 0.77). The as-\nsociation, however, weakened to nonsignificance in men when\nhealth conditions were controlled.\nThe presentstudyis uniquein several respects. Thepopulation-\nwomen) who haveexperiencedrelativelyhigh mortality(30% or\n1,177deaths)duringthe6 yearssincethecohortwasformed,thus\nprovidingsubstantialpower for examiningpredictorsof survival.\nThis is one of the largestpopulation-basedsample of elders with\nthe longest surveillance (of an elderly sample). Vital status was\ncarefully monitoredevery year, and deaths were documented by\ndeath certificates.Multiple subjectiveand objectivemeasures of\nphysicalhealth,socialsupport,andhealthpracticeswereavailable\nfor analysis, similar to those used in theAlameda County Study\n(28), after which the present study's analysisplan was modeled.\nWe hypothesizethat (a) frequent attendanceat religious services\nwillpredictlongersurvival, an effectthatwill persistaftercontrol-\nling for knownpredictors of mortality,and (b) the effects will be\ngreaterin womenthanin men (given priorresults intheliterature).\nMETHODS\nCommunity-dwellingadultsage 65 or older were sampledfor\ntheDuke University siteof the NationalInstitutes of Health-spon-\nsored Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of\nfied for the first wave of this study using a four-stage stratified\nprobabilitysampleof personsfrom fivecontiguouscounties (one\nurban and four rural) in central North Carolina.In the firststage,\n450 primary sampling units of approximately equal population\nsize were selectedfrom the surveyarea. In the second stage, one\nlisting area was selected from each sampling unit. In the third\nstage,all householdsin a listingarea wereenumerated,and a cer-\ntain number were randomly selected from this list. In the fourth\nstage,the Kishmethod (30) was used to selecta person age 65 or\nolder from each eligible household. Approximately half of the\nfinal sample came from the urban county and the rest from the\nrural counties. Because the Duke EPESE focused on ethnic dif-\nferences, black elders were oversampled (54% of sample). A\n(80% response) completed in-person interviewsin their homes.\nAfter proxy interviews were excluded, 4,000 evaluations re-\nmained;data on religiousattendancewere available for the 3,968\nsubjectswho constitutethe samplefor thisreport.\nBaseline and Follow-upInterviews\nVitalstatus.-After the initial evaluationin 1986,participants\nwere contactedfor follow-up interviewseveryyeareitherby tele-\nphone or in person. Field investigators provided continuous\nsurveillancethroughpersonal contact or proxy information, and\nconfirmed dates of death within the cohort by abstracting death\ncertificates(n=1177).Follow-uptime wascalculatedin days be-\ntween the baseline and the sixth follow-up interview, (i.e., the\nthird in-person interview, which took place in 1992).\nRespondents who were lost to follow-up prior to the sixth inter-\nwere censored, respectively,at 183days (6 months) beyond the\nlastcontactdate or at the dateof theirsixthinterview.\nReligious attendance.-Religious attendance at baseline was\nassessedby asking the question, \"Abouthow often do you go to\nreligious meetings or services?\" Response options were (a)\nnever/almost never, (b) once or twice a year, (c) every few\nmonths, (d) once or twice a month,(e)once a week,and (f) more\nthan once a week. Responses were dichotomized into less than\nonce a week (code=O) and once a week or more (codeeI); 53%\nof the sample attendedreligiousservicesat leastonce a week.\nBaseline Covariates\nCovariates were chosen because of demonstrated associa-\ntions with mortality (31-38). One objective was to follow as\nclosely as possible Strawbridge and colleagues' method of han-\ndling variables and analyzing the data so that results could be\ncompared (28). For that reason, all covariates except age were\ndichotomized.\nDemographicvariahles.-Demographic variables includedage\n(64-101 years), gender (male=O, femalee l), ethnicity(whiteeO,\nFunctioning.-Physical functioningwas measured by asking\nabout the person's ability to perform activities of daily living\n(ADLs) independently. Physical ADLs [(39) bathing, dressing,\neating, getting from bed to chair, toilet use], instrumentalADLs\n[(40) traveling, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework,\nmanaging finances],and strength/enduranceADLs [(41) able to\ndo heavy work around house, walk up and down flightof stairs,\nand walk half a mile or eight city blocks] were assessed.\nSubjects with no ADL impairment (code=O) were compared to\nthose with one or more impairedADLs (codeel).\nSelf-rated health.-Global self-rating of health (38) was\nmeasured with a single item that asked, \"Overall, how would\nyou rate your health-as excellent, good, fair, or poor?\"\nResponses were dichotomized into good or excellent (code=O)\nversusfair or poor (code=1).\nChronic conditions.-The presence or absence of eight\nchronic conditions was assessed (broken hip, cancer, diabetes,\nhearing problems, vision problems, high blood pressure, short-\nness of breath, and stroke). Subjects with no chronic conditions\n(code=O) were compared to those with one or more chronic\nconditions (code=1).\nDepression.-Depressive symptoms were assessed using the\n20-itemCenterfor Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CBS-D)\nscale(42).The itemson theCES-D werepresentedtorespondents\nin a yes-no format; positiveresponses were summed to create a\nscalerangingfrom 0 to 20.Scoresweredichotomized intodepres-\nsion absent (scores 0-8, code=O) and depression present (scores\nNegativelifeevents.-Negative lifeevents(NLEs)experienced\nduring the year prior to the baseline evaluation were recorded\n(44). Events included illness or injury requiring hospitalization,\nillness or injury preventing usual activities, divorce, death of\nspouse or child, spouse or child leavehome, close family member\nor friend die or experience seriousillness,legal trouble, retirement\nfrom work, financial change, relocation, and other stressor.\nSubjects with none of these negative life events (codeeO) were\ncompared to those experiencing one or more NLE (code=l).\nMarital status.-Subjects who were divorced, separated,\nwidowed, or single in 1986 (code-O) were compared to those\nwho were married (code= 1).\nSocial support.-Social support was assessed using four of\nthe five subscales of the Duke Social Support Index (45).\nSubscales included here were a 7-item social network subscale;\na 2-item confidant subscale (perceived presence of a confidant\nor someone to provide support in difficult times); a 2-item sub-\njective support subscale (perceived satisfaction with amount of\ncontact with friends/relatives); and a 13-item instrumental sup-\nport subscale (amount of help received). The fifth subscale, as-\nsessing social interaction, was dropped because it includes\nmembership in church-related groups that would confound the\nanalysis. Scores on these subscales were dichotomized at ap-\nproximately the midpoint of their distribution in the sample into\nlow (code=O)and high (codee l) categories.\nCigarette smoking.-Smoking was determined by the fol-\nlowing questions: \"Do you smoke cigarettes regularly now?\"\nResponse options were \"no\" (code-O) and \"yes\" (code=1).\nAlcohol consumption.-Alcohol use was determined by the\nfollowing three questions: \"Over the last month how often have\nyou had beer or ale?\"; \"Over the last month how often have you\nhad wine?\"; and \"Over the last month how often have you had\nTable1.PercentReporting FrequentReligious Attendance at Baselineby SelectedCharacteristics\nDemographics\nPhysical and Mental Health\nSocial Connections\nHealth Practices\n*OR=odds ratio; CI=confidence interval; obtained from logistic regression model with religious attendance as dependent variable, all analyses controlled for age,\nsex, race, and education (all dichotomized).\nTable2.Multivariate Sequential ModelsUsingBaselineCovariates ToCompareMortality Rates\nfor FrequentversusInfrequentAttenders of Religious ServicesDuring6Years of Follow-up\nModeland Covariates\nI.

BMI was divided into five quin-\ntiles for analysis; persons in the lower four quintiles (code=O)\nwerecomparedto thosein the upperquintile(code:1).\nMissing values at baseline.s-Covextsies with missing data at\nbaseline were handled in the following manner.

For measureswithmore than5% missingdata (11% for\nNLEsand9% forBMI),we createdimputedversions usingmore\ncomplicated stochastic regression techniques (47).\nStatistical Analysis\nTheprimaryhypothesis of the studyis toexaminereligiousat-\ntendance asa predictor of survival inolderadults. Baseline associa-\ntions betweenfrequentattendanceand covariateswere analyzed\nthroughpercentages and logisticregression models(48).Oddsra-\ntios,adjustedforthecovariates age,sex,race,andeducation, were\nobtainedusinglogisticregression withreligiousattendance as the\ndependentvariable. Theassociation betweenfrequent religious at-\ntendance andsurvival wasexamined usinga Coxproportional haz-\nardsregression model(49). Survival timewasenteredas days. The\nvalidity of theproportional hazards assumption wasexaminedand\nconfirmedbothgraphically and withthe normalscoretestof pro-\nportionality(50).Fivesequentialmodels were usedto assessthe\nrelative impactsofthecovariates on therelationship betweenatten-\ndanceandmortality. First, religious attendance wasexamined alone\nin themodel;second,demographic variables (age,gender, educa-\ntion,ethnicity) wereadded;third,physicalandmentalhealthvari-\nables(impairedfunction, chronicconditions, self-rated health,de-\npression,NLEs) were added;fourth,socialconnections(marital\nstatus,socialnetwork,supportive confidants, helpreceived) were\nadded;and fifth, healthpractices(smokingcigarettesand alcohol\nconsumption)wereadded.Becausesatisfaction withsupportand\nBMI were not related to religious attendance or mortality,they\nwerenot includedin the models.Gender differencesin outcome\nandgender-specific associations betweenattendance andmortality\nwereassessedby addinggenderby attendance interaction termsto\nthemodels.Analyseswerethenstratified by genderto obtainrela-\ntivehazardratiosand95% confidence intervals. All analyses were\ncarriedout usingthe statistical softwareSAS [SASInstituteInc.,\nRESULTS\nBaseline Associations\nTable 1 presents associations between frequent religious at-\ntendance and covariates in 1986. Frequent religious attenders\nwere more than likelyto be women, better educated,and black.\nThey were less likelythaninfrequentattendersto have impaired\nphysicalfunctioning, chronichealthconditions,fairor poor self-\nrated health, or depression. Frequentattenderswere more likely\nto be married, havelarger socialnetworks, and haveconfidants,\npersonson whom theycould dependin timesof trouble.Finally,\nfrequent attenders were less likely to smoke cigarettes (51) and\nlesslikelyto consumealcohol. Thus, at baseline,religiousatten-\nders were physically healthier, had more social support, and\nlivedhealthierlifestyles thanlessfrequentattenders.\nMortality and Survival\nFrequentreligiousattenderswere less likelyto die thaninfre-\nquent attenders during the median 2,293-day follow-up period\nMeiersurvival curvesfor frequent andinfrequent religiousatten-\ndersareplottedin Figure1.Table2 presents theresults of theCox\nproportionalhazards analyses.Withoutcontrolvariablesin the\nmodel(1), frequent religious attenders in 1986hada lowerrelative\nhazard (RH)of dying compared withinfrequentattenders (RH\nnicitywereaddedto themodel (Il),therelationship wasreduced\nslightly (RH0.59).Addinghealthconditions (ill), socialconnec-\ntions(N), andhealthpractices (V)tothemodelproducedfurther\nreductions in themagnitudeof relationship betweenreligious at-\ntendanceandsurvival, butdid noteliminate it (RH0.72,95% CI\nGender\nThe data in Table2 indicatethatthe relationshipbetweenre-\nligiousattendanceand survivaltendedto be greaterfor women\nthanfor men.Beforecontrollingforcovariates, women who at-\ntendedreligiousservicesonce a weekor more were only about\none-halfas likelyto die as womenattendingservicesless often\nconditions, social connections, and health practices were suc-\ncessivelyadded to the model, this reduced the relationship be-\ntween religious attendance and survivalfor both genders, but\nAttendance interaction term approached significance in the final\nDISCUSSION\nWeexaminedtherelationship betweenreligious attendance in\nCompared withlessfrequent attenders, persons attending religious\nservices oncea weekormoreatbaseline werephysically andmen-\ntallyhealthier, hadlargersocial support networks, hadmoreconfi-\ndantsandlivedhealthier lifestyles (lesssmoking andalcoholcon-\nsumption). By 1992, nearly one third of the sample had died\n(n=I,177).Analyses revealed thattheriskofdyingforfrequent at-\ntenders was46%lowerthanforthoseattending services lessoften.\nThisrisklessened(28%)butremainedsignificant afteradjusting\nfordemographic factors, physical andmental health conditions, so-\ncialconnections, andhealthpractices (andwasequivalent inmag-\nnitude to cigarette smoking). The association was stronger in\nwomenthaninmen(35%vs 17%), butwaspresent inbothsexes.\nOur findings replicate those of Strawbridgeand colleagues'\nStudy (28).They reported that the risk of dying was 23% less\nwe includedpersonsaged 65 yearsor older(theAlamedaStudy\nincludedonlypersonsaged 21 to 65 years),and our samplewas\ndrawn from a southeastern U.S. community.In both studies, a\nsurvivaladvantagewas found for frequent religious attenders,\nand the advantage was strongerin womenthanin men.\nMechanism ofEffect\nIf religiousattendance did impact on health, how might this\nhaveoccurred?Therearea numberofpsychosocial andbehavioral\npathwaysby whichinvolvement in a religiouscommunitycould\naffect health. First,wehaveseeninboththisstudyandothers that\nfrequent attenders have larger social networks and experience\ngreater supportthaninfrequentattenders (8,9,28).Becausefre-\nquentattenders havemorecontact withothers, theymaybe subject\nto greatersurveillance andcheckingforhealthproblems. Ifprob-\nlemsareidentified byfellow congregants, theymaybeencouraged\ntoconsult a physician andperhaps be assisted ingetting tothedoc-\ntor's office. In this way,diseasesmight be diagnosedearlierand\nhelpobtainedsooner(52). Greatsocialsupportmayalsohavedi-\nrecteffects on theimmune systemto fendoffdisease, facilitate re-\ncovery,or otherwiseextend survival(6,7). In a recent report of\n1,718 community-dwelling olderadults, interleukin-6levels (anin-\ndicator of immunesystem dysregulation) werefoundtobe signifi-\ncantlyloweramongfrequent churchattenders aftercontrolling for\nage,functional status, andchronic healthconditions (53).\nSecond,frequentreligiousattendancemay fosterattitudesof\ncompliance andcareforthephysical bodythatcarryoverintoad-\nherenceto medical treatments. Conservativereligiousattitudes\n(twothirdsofour sample wereconservative Protestants) mayfos-\ntercompliance withmedication (54),keepingofmedical appoint-\nments(55,56), orparticipation inpreventive healthservices (57).\nThird,religiousattendance is relatedto lowerratesof depres-\nsion, anxiety, and stress.A strongreligious faith reinforcedby\nactive religious participation may help persons to cope better\nwith stressors,particularly physicalhealth problemsin laterlife\n(58).Lowerrates of depression, likehigher socialsupport, may\ntranslate into stronger immune systems and better defenses\nagainst disease (59,60). Improved coping may also lead to\nfewerdirect(17) andindirect(61)self-destructive behaviors.\nFourth, as we have seen in the present study, religious in-\ntices (64), all of which may prevent physical diseases that im-\npact on mortality.Strawbridge and colleagues (28), following\ntheir sample over time, also discovered that frequent religious\nattenders were more likely than infrequent attenders to stop\nsmoking, increase exercise, and stay married to the same per-\nson. Thus, there are multiple pathways by which religious at-\ntendancemay reducemortality and enhancesurvival.\nIn spite of controlling for several of these potential mecha-\nnisms(e.g.,socialsupport, stress,depression), the effectof reli-\ngiousattendanceon survivalpersistedin both the current study\nand the Strawbridge study. One reasonfor theunexplained vari-\nanceis the use of relatively weakmeasuresto assessdepressive\nsymptoms, stress,and socialsupport. Both of thesestudies were\nlargeepidemiologicalsurveysthat necessitateda relativelysu-\nperficialassessmentof theseconstructs.For example,our mea-\nsure of stress involvednumber of stressful life events experi-\nenced during the year prior to evaluation (hardly a robust\nmeasure of current stress), and the Strawbridge study did not\nreportany directmeasureof stress. Likewise,both studiesmea-\nsured depression using a symptom checklist, which is not the\nsameas depressiondiagnosedby clinicalevaluation or by struc-\nturedpsychiatricinterview. Thus,had more in-depthpsychoso-\ncial measures been available,a greater amount of the variance\nin the attendanceeffectmighthavebeen explained.\nGender Effect\nIt is not clear why the association between religious atten-\ndance and survival shouldbe strongerin womenthan in men, a\nfinding alsoreportedby both Strawbridge and associates (28)in\ntheAlamedaCountyStudyand by Houseandcolleagues (23)in\nthe Tecumseh Community Health Study.Women, in general,\ntendto involve themselves in religious practices morethanmen.\nIn thepresentstudy, womenweremorelikelyto attendreligious\nservices frequently, and other studiesreport that they are more\nlikely than men to pray (65), say religion is important in their\nlives (65), and depend on religion as a coping behavior (66).\nThus, it is possiblethat religiousbeliefsand practicesare more\ningrained in the social and psychological lives of women, and\nthus conveygreater health effects. Strawbridgeand colleagues\n(28) point out thatgiventhe much higherproportionof widow-\nhood among older women, religious institutionsmay act to fill\nan otherwiseunmetsocialneedfor support. Likewise, Idler(67)\nstressesa generaltendency for womento seekand use socialin-\nteractionto cope with stress.None of theseexplanations,how-\never,can accountfor the equal or strongerrelationship between\nreligious attendance and survival inmenreportedby otherinves-\ntigatorsin Georgia(24)and Connecticut(25).Thus, genderdif-\nferences in the association betweenreligious attendance and sur-\nvivalremainsomewhat a mystery.\nLimitations\nWe did not include time-varying covariatesin our analyses\n(as Strawbridge and colleagues did). Thus, the impact of\nchangesin health,socialsupports,andhealthbehaviors was not\nassessed. Furthermore, we did not measure other important\nvariablesthatmighthelp to explainthe relationship betweenre-\nligious attendance and mortality, such as beliefs or attitudes\nabout the effects of religious faith on health, dietary practices,\nexercise, or level of psychosocial stress (other than number of\nNLEs, where 11% of data weremissing). Detailedclinicalmea-\nsures of physical and mental health were also lacking. Atten-\ndance at religiousservicesis also a relatively weak indicatorof\na deep, enduringreligiousfaith, as personsmay attend services\nfor reasonsotherthan religiousones.Measuresof intrinsicreli-\ngiosity (i.e., the extent to which religious beliefs and commit-\nment are the motivatingfactors in a person's life) were not ob-\ntained (68).While religiousattendanceand intrinsicreligiosity\nare related (Pearsonr=O.44, n=455),they are not the same and\nmay nothavethe samehealtheffects(69).\nFinally, over 95% of our sample were affiliated with tradi-\ntional Judeo-Christian religious groups (59% Baptist, 17%\nMethodist, 4% Presbyterian, 4% Pentecostal/Holiness, 11%\nother Protestant),and the results may only be generalizable to\npersonsfromthesereligiousbackgrounds. The studytook place\nin the Bible Belt (southeastern United States), where rates of\nreligious attendance may be higher than in other parts of the\ncountry (53% of our participants attended weekly or more\noften).Nevertheless, a recentnationalsurveyby the GallupPoll\nfound that 53% of persons aged 65 or older attendedchurch or\nsynagoguewithinthe past7 days (65).\nConclusions\nFrequentreligiousattendancehas nowbeen foundin at least\ntwo large, population-basedstudieslocated at oppositeends of\nthe United States to be associated with a reduced hazard of\ndying,particularlyamong women.Frequentreligiousattenders\nin both studiesreported greater social support,less depression,\nand better health practices (reduced smoking and alcoholcon-\nsumption), factors thatmaypreservehealthandextendsurvival.\nThese factors, however,were not sufficientto explain the rela-\ntionship between religious attendance and longer survival.\nReplication of thesefindings is neededfrom prospective studies\nthat correct for some of the methodological limitations noted\nabove. Furtherresearchis alsonecessaryto identifythe specific\npsychosocial, behavioral,and biological mechanisms by which\ninvolvement in thereligious community preventsdisease, main-\ntainshealth,or speedsrecovery.\nACKNOWLEOOMENTS\nThis research was performed pursuant to contract NO1AG-12102 with the\nNational Institute on Aging, in support of the Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (Duke University).
