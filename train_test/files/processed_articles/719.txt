Three hundred nonsmokers and 300 smok-\nyears of age in the United States were surveyed with\nrandom-digit dialing. The results of this cross-sectional\nsurvey were analyzed using logistic regression to deter-\nmine predictors of nonsmoking and intent to stop among\ncurrent smokers.\nResults. Controlling for age, ethnicity, and education,\nnonsmokers were more likely to consider smoking risky\nthan smokers (odds ratio [OR]  3.46). Nonsmokers were\ntwice as likely to consider secondhand smoke dangerous\nthan smokers (OR  1.47). Among the variables in our\nmodel, the only statistically significant predictor of plan-\nning to stop smoking or having actually stopped was\nbelieving that secondhand smoke harmed nonsmokers,\nwhich more than doubled the chances of planning to stop\nor having stopped smoking (relative risk  2.17).\nConclusions. Educating young people about the dan-\ngers of secondhand smoke and empowering nonsmokers\nto speak out should be a strong element of any tobacco\ntobacco smoke pollution, passive smoking, environmental\ntobacco smoke, smoking cessation, smoking prevention.\nABBREVIATION. OR, odds ratio.\nWhen public health professionals are design-\ning tobacco control programs, efforts de-\nsigned to prevent youth smoking or to en-\ncourage youth to stop smoking are often considered\nin competition with those designed to promote\nsmoke-free environments. The fact that secondhand\nsmoke increases the risk of death from lung cancer,\nheart disease, sudden infant death syndrome, and a\nvariety of other diseases in nonsmokers1\u00ad4 has\nproven to be a powerful justification for creation of\nsmoke-free workplaces, public places, and homes.\nonly protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke\nbut also provide environments that facilitate smok-\ning cessation among adults. Smoke-free workplaces\nreduce smoking prevalence by 20% and lead to\n20% lower consumption among continuing smok-\ners, which itself is associated with progress toward\ncessation.15 The tobacco industry has understood\nthat concern about the health effects of secondhand\nsmoke on nonsmokers undermines the social sup-\nport network for smoking.16 One econometric study\nshowed that presence of a local clean indoor air law\nwas associated with lower teen smoking.6 To date,\nhowever, no one has examined whether concern over\nthe effects of secondhand smoke on nonsmokers is a\nsimilarly powerful intervention for preventing\nsmoking among youth or encouraging cessation\namong this group. We use a cross-sectional survey of\nyouth and young adults (14 to 22 years of age) to\nsuggest that interventions designed to educate these\npeople about the dangers of secondhand smoke are\nalso a powerful message with this group.\nMETHODS\nAfter approval of the protocol by the institutional review board\nat the University of Pennsylvania, interviewers from Princeton\nSurvey Research Associates used random-digit telephone dialing\nto contact 9301 households in the continental United States from\nprovided the needed screening information to identify a person 14\nto 22 years of age. Approximately 15% of these cooperating house-\nholds contained an eligible English-speaking respondent. In\nhouseholds with more than one eligible respondent, the person\nwith the most recent birthday was selected for interviewing. Pa-\nrental consent was obtained before interviewing respondents un-\nder 16 years of age. Respondents who reported smoking any\ncigarettes in the past 30 days were defined as smokers. The final\nsample contained 300 smokers and 300 nonsmokers with a total\nresponse rate of 51%.\nThe survey data were weighted to adjust for both sample\ndesign decisions (overrepresenting smokers) and for demographic\nnonresponse. This weighting was accomplished in 2 stages. In the\nfirst stage the relative proportions of smokers and nonsmokers\nwere adjusted to correct for the fact that smokers were over-\nsampled to increase their number in the final sample for analysis.\nThe oversampling of smokers was accomplished by screening a\nlarge nationally representative sample of 14- to 22-year-olds on\nsmoking status and then conducting the full interview on all\nsmokers identified (n  300) but only a portion of the nonsmokers.\nThe weighting reflects the fact that smokers were oversampled 2.5\ntimes relative to their prevalence in the large nationally represen-\ntative sample of 14- to 22-year-olds screened on smoking status.\nThe second-stage weight involved bringing the sample of com-\npleted full interviews (after it had been adjusted to correct the\nsmoker/nonsmoker proportions) into alignment with national pa-\nrameters for sex by age, race, and region for Americans 14 through\n22 years of age living in telephone households in the continental\nUnited States. These demographic weighting parameters were\nderived from a special analysis of the most recently available\nCensus Bureau Annual Demographic File (from the March 1998\nCurrent Population Survey). The weights are derived using an\nFrom the *Institute for Health Policy Studies, Cardiovascular Research\nInstitute, and Department of Medicine, University of California, San Fran-\ncisco; and the Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania,\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania.\nReprint requests to (S.A.G.)

We included an educational variable\ncoded as 1 for respondents who were still enrolled in school or\nhigh school graduates and 0 if they had left school before com-\npleting high school. We assessed whether they considered smok-\ning dangerous with this question: \"In your opinion, is smoking\nvery risky for a person's health, somewhat risky, only a little risky,\nor not at all risky?\" and coded the responses \"somewhat risky\" or\n\"very risky\" as 1 (yes) and \"a little risky,\" \"not at all risky,\" and\n\"don't know\" as 0 (no). We assessed whether respondents con-\nsidered secondhand smoke dangerous with this question: \"True or\nfalse: each year thousands of nonsmokers die from breathing other\npeople's smoke\" and coded \"true\" as 1 (yes) and \"false,\" \"don't\nknow,\" and \"refused to answer\" as 0 (no). We defined a current\nsmoker as one who answered \"yes\" to this question: \"During the\npast 30 days have you smoked any cigarettes?\" We assessed\nwhether a respondent had stopped smoking or planned to stop\nsmoking with this question: \"Do you plan to quit smoking?\"\ncoding \"yes\" or \"already quit\" as 1 (yes) and \"no\" or \"don't\nknow\" as 0 (no).\nData were analyzed with a single logistic regression including\nall the variables using SPSS, Version 9.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).\nRESULTS\nOne half of the respondents were current smokers\nand one half were nonsmokers by design. (Of the 300\nnonsmokers, 187 had never smoked a single ciga-\nrette.) Table 1 summarizes the demographic charac-\nteristics of the sample.\nThe odds of being a nonsmoker decreased with\nage (P  .001) and increased with black ethnicity\n(P  .010) and educational status (high school grad-\nuate or respondent still in high school; P  .003;\nTable 2). Nonsmokers were more likely to consider\nsmoking risky than were smokers (odds ratio [OR] \nconsider secondhand smoke dangerous than were\nHispanic ethnicity were not significantly related to\nsmoking status.\nAmong the variables in our model, the only statis-\ntically significant predictor of planning to stop smok-\ning or having actually stopped was believing that\nsecondhand smoke harmed nonsmokers, which\nmore than doubled the chances of planning to stop or\nDISCUSSION\nThese results indicate that with teens and young\nadults, as with adults, concern with secondhand\nsmoke is a powerful deterrent against smoking and a\npowerful motivator for smoking cessation.\nIn drawing these conclusions, it is important to\nremember that these results are from a cross-sec-\ntional study, so causality should be interpreted cau-\ntiously. As with any similar statistical analysis, the\nconclusions depend on the model tested.\nNevertheless, these findings are consistent with\nthe results of longitudinal studies of similar ques-\ntions in adults5,9,13 as well as econometric studies6\nand focus-group studies of antitobacco advertising in\nteens,17 which indicate that secondhand smoke is 1 of\n3 highly effective (along with antitobacco industry\nand addiction) messages for reaching teens. Tobacco\ncontrol efforts directed at teens should have a strong\nelement designed to educate people about the dan-\ngers of secondhand smoke and the rights of non-\nsmokers. Encouraging nonsmoking teens--as well as\nadults--to object to breathing secondhand smoke\nand encouraging creation of smoke-free homes is a\nproductive tobacco control strategy for youth.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by National Cancer Institute Grant\nCA-61021, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Annen-\nberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.\nREFERENCES\n1.
