Leishmaniasis is\nendemic to many countries in Africa,\nAmerica, Asia, and Europe, but the majority\nof CL cases (> 90%) occur in Afghanistan,\nBrazil, Iran, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and\nSyria.1,2 Recently, millions of Syrians have\nentered Turkey in response to conflicts in the\nSyrian Arab Republic and are still residing\nin this country. Although refugee camps\nhave been established in many cities, includ-\ning Gaziantep, many Syrian refugees are\nalso living in other parts of Turkey.3\nThe accurate diagnosis of CL, its treat-\nment, disease prevention, strategies for its\ncontrol, and management decisions require\nthe identification of the causative species\nof the Leishmania parasite.4\u00ad6 The diagnosis\nof CL is based on clinical features\nand laboratory tests, including a direct\nparasitological examination and/or indirect\ntesting with serology and molecular diag-\nnostics.7 A universal PCR method targeting\nthe internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1)\nregion, which occurs between the genes\nproved useful in the direct diagnosis and\nidentification of the Leishmania parasite\nbecause this region is highly conserved\namong species.8\nAnthroponotic CL caused by L. tropica is\nhighly endemic in south-eastern Anatolia\nand the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean\nregions of Turkey. In south Anatolia, both\nL. infantum and L. tropica have been\nreported as the causative agents of human\nCL. Leishmania major is known to be\nendemic in the countries bordering southern\nTurkey: Syria, Iraq, and Iran.9 In Syria,\nCL has two forms: zoonotic CL caused by\nL. major and anthroponotic CL caused by\nIn this study, we identified the causative\nLeishmania species using PCR\u00adrestriction\nfragment length polymorphism (RFLP)\nand sequencing analyses of patients diag-\nnosed with CL.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nApproval for this study was obtained\nfrom the Ethics Committee of Gaziantep\nUniversity Faculty of Medicine (reference\nenrolled in the treatment program, including\ning in refugee camps and 25 Turkish citizens\n(5.5%) with a diagnosis of CL, who were\nreferred by primary and secondary health-\ncare facilities in the city of Gaziantep to the\nLeishmaniasis Detection and Treatment\nCenter established at the Department of\nDermatology and Sexually Transmitted\nDiseases in Gaziantep University Sahinbey\nResearch and Practice Hospital between\nof CL was made based on clinical features\nand microscopic \u00c6 culture methods that\ndetected the presence of amastigotes in\nsuspected CL lesions of the patients.11,12\nand four Turkish citizens) in whom promas-\ntigotes were demonstrated in culture were\nincluded in the study to detect and type the\nLeishmania parasites. The mean age of our\nyears. Culture fluids from these 100 patients\nwere analysed with PCR\u00adRFLP, and a\nsequencing analysis was also performed in\n95 of these patients to type the Leishmania\nparasite.\nSampling\nTo collect aspiration fluid from the lesion\nsites, 0.5 ml of a sterile 0.9% sodium chlor-\nide (NaCl) solution was drawn into a syr-\ninge. After the lesion site was cleaned with\n70% alcohol, the lesion was penetrated with\nthe syringe through the margin of the lesion\nclose to the intact skin. Sterile NaCl solution\nwas delivered into the lesion and the intra-\nlesional fluid was collected into the syringe.\nEk\u00b8\nThe aspiration fluid was used to inoculate\nNow\u00adMcNeal\u00adNicolle culture medium\n(Besimik Ltd, Sti, Turkey), and a portion\nof the collected sample was transferred onto\na clean slide to prepare a smear. The smear\nwas then stained with Giemsa staining solu-\ntion and examined under a light microscope\n(Olympus CX31, Tokyo, Japan) with a\n100\u00c2 objective lens. Preparations showing\namastigotes were considered to be positive\n(\u00fe) for Leishmania spp. and preparations\nwith no amastigotes were considered nega-\ntive (\u00ad) for Leishmania spp. All results were\nrecorded. The inoculated culture tubes were\nsecond day for 1 month for the presence of\npromastigotes. Promastigotes were detected\nwith a direct microscopic examination and\nGiemsa staining of the culture fluid.11 The\nsamples of culture fluid containing promas-\ntigotes were collected in sterile Eppendorf\ntubes and stored at \u00c080C until typing.\nIsolation of Leishmania DNA\nLeishmania spp. DNA was isolated from the\nculture fluids with the QIAamp DNA Mini\nKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored\nPCR\u00adRFLP analysis of ITS1 region\nThe forward primer (LITSR) 50-CTGGATC\nATTTTCCGATG-30 and reverse primer\nTT-30, specific to the ribosomal ITS1\nregion that occurs between the genes encod-\ning the small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA\nA 50 ml reaction mix was prepared in a PCR\ntube by adding 1 ml of 10 nmol forward\nmaster mix; New England Biolabs Inc.,\nUK), 13 ml of nuclease-free water, and\n10 ml of template DNA.

Its overall global prevalence\nis estimated to be around 12 million cases\nand this figure increases by 1.5\u00ad2 million\nfrom the World Health Organization\n(WHO), CL occurs in 82 countries and 1.5\nmillion new cases are recorded every year.17\nMigration, travel, and ecological changes\ncontribute to this increase. Host, parasite,\nand vector characteristics determine the\noccurrence and course of the disease.2 CL\nis highly prevalent in our neighbouring\ncountries of Iraq, Iran, and Syria and there\nare massive migratory flows into Turkey\nfrom these countries, both controlled and\nuncontrolled. According to a report issued\nby the United Nations High Commissioner\ncurrently living in Turkey. Some Syrians\nwith manifest CL have come to Turkey and\nlive in camps or various cities.3 According to\na WHO Report of 2010, Syria is one of the\ncountries most affected by CL, with more\nendemic in the Aleppo region of Syria for a\nvery long time. However, there has been a\ngradual increase in the number of cases\nreported since the 1990s, with a maximum\nthe Idlib, Hamah, and Halab Provinces.19\nAn outbreak has occurred with the current\nwar in Syria and measures to combat the\ndisease are lacking, particularly in the\nbesieged and medically underserved areas.\nNew publications from the Turkish Ministry\nof Health reveal shocking statistics. An\nThe identification of the different species\nof the Leishmania parasite is based on an\nisoenzyme analysis or molecular biological\nmethods.21 In the present study, Leishmania\npromastigotes isolated from patient samples\nwere typed with PCR\u00adRFLP and DNA\nsequencing using primers specific for the\nITS1 region. The ITS1 fragment that were\nsimilar to those obtained with standard\nLeishmania strains was chosen as the target\nfor the diagnostic PCR analysis,22 because\nITS1 of the ribosomal DNA repeat unit has\npreviously been used to distinguish Old\nWorld Leishmania species using RFLP\nand DNA sequencing.22,23 The sensitivity\nof the ITS1 analysis has been demonstrated\nand PCR\u00adRFLP with HaeIII is an efficient\ntechnique for the identification of\nLeishmania species.22\nIn patients with CL, the lesions differ\nthroughout the clinical course of the disease\nand in response to treatment, depending on\nthe causative agent. In the present study, the\nLeishmania species isolated from samples\nfrom Turkish citizens was identified as\nL. tropica. Leishmania tropica is the predom-\ninant cause of CL in the south-eastern\nAnatolia region,2 although in recent years,\nL. major and L. donovani have also been\nshown to be causative agents of CL in\nTurkey.24 Toz et al.23 examined the parasites\nin samples obtained from humans and dogs\nliving in 31 cities in Turkey, with the majority\nof samples originating from Izmir, Aydin,\nHatay, and Sanliurfa, and identified 80.43%\nof the human and canine visceral leishman-\niasis samples as L. infantum and 6.52% as L.\ntropica, and 52.46% of the CL samples as L.\nIn the present study, the Leishmania\nparasite isolated from lesions of Syrian\nrefugees was L. tropica and no other species\nwas identified. Several studies have reported\nthat the most prevalent causative agents\nof CL in Syria are L. tropica8,25 and\nL. major.26 Consistent with our findings,\nYehia et al.27 established L. tropica as the\nEk\u00b8\ncausative Leishmania species in biopsy sam-\nples isolated from lesions of Lebanese,\nSyrian, and Saudi Arabian patients with\nsuspected Leishmaniasis, using PCR\u00ad\nRFLP. In Lebanon, Saroufim et al.28 identi-\nfied L. tropica in 85% and L. major in 15%\nof Leishmania isolated from the lesions of\nSyrian refugees with CL.\nSignificant heterogeneity was observed in\nthe genetic structure of the L. tropica para-\nsite that was analysed phylogenetically in the\npresent study. Leishmania tropica is a very\nheterogeneous species and a high degree of\nintra-species polymorphism has been\ndescribed based on an isoenzyme analysis\nand other molecular methods.29,30 This gen-\netic variation may produce different pheno-\ntypes that are associated with a diversity of\nclinical manifestations and geographic dis-\ntributions.31 In their study, Ajaoud et al.32\nreported that an analysis of the ITS1\u00ad5.8S\nrRNA gene\u00adITS2 sequence in 31 specimens\nof the Phlebotomus sergenti vector showed\ngreat heterogeneity among L. tropica, segre-\ngating them into 16 haplotypes and demon-\nstrating their phylogenetic relatedness to\nIndian strains and one Moroccan strain\nisolated from a CL patient. The heterozy-\ngosity of L. tropica isolates has also been\nsuggested in a previous study.33\nSchwenkenbecher et al.34 developed 16 poly-\nmorphic microsatellite markers for the\nphylogenetic analysis of L. tropica. They\nfound a high degree of allelic heterozygosity\namong the strains, which suggested sexual\nrecombination within the species. The vari-\nations reported in the Old World Leishmania\nspecies using ITS1 PCR\u00adRFLP analyses\nrange from highest to lowest in the order:\nL. tropica > L. aethiopica > L. major > L.\ndonovani.9 Eroglu et al.35 reported that\nDNA sequencing revealed genetic variation\nin both L. infantum (variants 1\u00ad3) and\nL. tropica (variants 1\u00ad5), and suggested\nthat the increase in disease occurrence may\nbe attributable to the geographic expansion\nof the disease, changing patterns of\ninternational travel, population migrations,\nand the entry of non-immune people into\nendemic regions and of infected people into\nnon-endemic regions.\nConclusion\nThere are many diseases prevalent among the\nSyrian and Iraqi refugees fleeing the civil wars\nin their countries, primarily CL. The risk of\nepidemics is greater for anthroponotic infec-\ntions because of the transmission cycle from\ninfected human to vector to human. Infected\nmigrants may carry the disease to our region,\nparticularly Nizip and its surrounds, where\nenvironmental/climatic conditions favour the\nvector. There is also a risk that the disease will\nspread to other regions. The identification of\nthe causative Leishmania parasite in the cases\nof CL detected in our region will guide\ntreatment decisions and the implementation\nof the necessary preventive measures and\nvector control strategies.\n"
