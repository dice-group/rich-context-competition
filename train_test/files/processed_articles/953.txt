Our primary objectives were (a) to determine the relative impact of Alzheimer's disease and related de-\nmentias (ADRD), disability, and common comorbid health conditions on the cost of caring for community-dwelling el-\nderly person and (b) to determine whether ADRD serves as an effect modifier for the effect of disability and common\ncomorbidities on costs.\nMethods. Participants were drawn from community respondents to the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey. The\nauthors compared total cost of caring for persons without ADRD with that of those who had moderate and severe\nADRD. Using regression analysis, the author identified the adjusted effect of ADRD, limitations in activities of daily\nliving (ADLs), and common comorbidities on total costs.\nResults. Persons with severe ADRD had higher median total costs ($10,234) than did persons with moderate ADRD\nimportant predictor of total cost than was ADRD status in both stratified and multivariate analyses. Comorbidities such\nas heart attack, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also increased costs. Severe ADRD was an effect\nmodifier for ADL limitations, increasing the positive impact of disability on total costs among persons with severe\nADRD, but not for comorbidities.\nDiscussion. Disability, severe ADRD, and comorbidity all had independent effects that increased total costs. Thus,\nany risk adjustment procedure should account for disability and comorbidity and not just ADRD status.\nLZHEIMER'S disease and related dementias (ADRD)\nhas been estimated to be the third most expensive dis-\nease to treat in the United States; causes substantial disabil-\nity to afflicted persons; and has a major impact on family\nmembers, who often provide a substantial amount of infor-\nmal care (Ernst & Hay, 1994; Meek, McKeithan, & Schu-\ncludes the cost of formal personal health services provided\nin a variety of settings--nursing homes, hospitals, physi-\ncians' offices, and in homes--as well as informal care pro-\nvided by families and paid caregivers (Coughlin & Liu,\n1994). Prescription drugs and assistive devices such as du-\nrable medical equipment are also factors. Intangible costs\nsuch as reductions in quality of life or reduced life expect-\nancy are difficult to measure. The effect of ADRD on the cost\nof caring for elderly persons is important because of the in-\ncreasing numbers of persons diagnosed with ADRD in the\nUnited States (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1997).\nEstimates of the prevalence of ADRD vary from 2.7% to\n11.2% of the population aged 65 and older across U.S. stud-\nand a recent U.S. General Accounting Office (1997) meta-\nanalysis placed the figure at 5.7% of the population aged 65\nand older. Study populations and methods of diagnosis dif-\nfered across studies, contributing to the uncertainty, but the\nprevalence of dementia has even been found to differ within\nthe same study population when multiple diagnostic criteria\nare used (Erkinjunti et al., 1997). However, there is consen-\nsus that ADRD prevalence rises with age, making it of great\nconcern as the population of the United States continues to\nage (U.S. General Accounting Office, 1997).\nErnst and Hay (1997) reviewed the literature on the cost\nof ADRD and found that estimates varied by a factor of 4\nacross studies. They pointed out that drawing conclusive\ncost estimates from the existing literature is made difficult\nby the localized nature of many samples, differences in con-\ntrols for severity of ADRD, lack of control for other impor-\ntant patient characteristics, and uncertainty regarding the\nperiod of data collection in some studies. The clearest find-\nings from the cost literature are as follows: (a) Caregiver\ntime is a large portion of the cost of caring for persons\nwith ADRD in community settings; (b) costs rise with in-\ncreased dementia and limitations in activities of daily living\n(ADLs); and (c) the cost and distribution of cost among for-\nmal and informal care categories varies according to resi-\ndential location. Demented individuals living in nursing\nhomes tend to receive more paid caregiving and to incur\nA\nhigher total costs, whereas those living in community set-\ntings tend to cost less overall but receive a larger proportion\nof their care from informal, unpaid caregivers.\nRecently, Leon, Cheng, and Neumann (1998) found that\nmonthly total costs (formal and caregiving services) of car-\ning for a person with ADRD were lower for community res-\nidents and that increased disability was an important predic-\ntor of higher cost, in a sample that included persons from\nseveral states. Five studies have focused on the cost to the\nMedicare program of caring for persons with ADRD by\nstudying Medicare claims records (Cano, Hennessey, War-\nren, & Lubitz, 1997; Gutterman, Markowitz, Lewis, & Fil-\nTaylor & Sloan, 2000; Weiner, Powe, Weller, Shaffer, &\nAnderson, 1998). These studies showed that persons with\nADRD use more Medicare-financed care compared with\ncontrols without the disease and suggested that prior re-\nsearch based on localized samples that did not have admin-\nistrative claims data probably underestimated the magnitude\nof such care. Comparison of these studies is also made diffi-\ncult because of different controls used across studies, and\nthere is still much that is unclear about cost of care and\nADRD. Ernst and Hay (1997) pointed out in their review of\nthe literature that \"despite the studies that have been done,\nthere is clearly room for new work on AD costs, ideally\nwith national instead of small and geographically limited\nOur study was designed to provide more information on\nthe total cost of caring for elderly persons living in commu-\nnity settings, including the distribution of cost among differ-\nent types of care, by using a national sample that included\npersons over the age of 65 who lived in the community. Per-\nsons living in nursing homes were excluded from our analy-\nsis because the major cost driver of such persons' care is be-\ning in a nursing home per se, and not the mixture of\ndisabilities and/or diseases that they have. There were two\nmain goals of our study: (a) to determine the relative impact\nof ADRD, disability as measured by ADL limitations, and\ncomorbidities on the total cost of caring for elderly persons\nliving in the community, and (b) to determine whether the\npresence of ADRD serves as an effect modifier of the rela-\ntionship between disability and comorbidity on total costs.\nThese analyses are relevant to current policy discussions re-\ngarding the incremental burden on society of a rise in the\nprevalence of ADRD and help answer questions regarding\nwhether ADRD per se or comorbidity and disability are bet-\nter variables that might be used as risk adjustors for policy\npurposes.\nMETHODS\nSample\nOur sample consisted of 4,834 respondents to the com-\nmunity portion of the 1994 National Long Term Care Sur-\nvey (NLTCS), all of whom were aged 65 and older. A total\nof 1,742 were continuing respondents, meaning they re-\nnewly screened into the sample in 1994, meaning they were\naged 65 years and reported at least one limitation in an ADL\nor instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) that had\nlasted or was expected to last for at least 90 days at a\nscreener interview, and subsequently completed a full com-\nmunity interview. Another 894 respondents were given a\ncomplete community interview even though they did not re-\nport any limitations in IADLs or ADLs on a screener inter-\nview; this group was included to allow for analyses that in-\ncluded \"successful agers.\" Multivariate analysis samples\nwere reduced slightly by item nonresponse of some vari-\nables.\nMethod of Diagnosing ADRD\nWe defined persons as having ADRD if they had low\ncognition as measured by the Short Portable Mental Status\nQuestionnaire (SPMSQ; Pfeiffer, 1975). The SPMSQ \"is\nintended to offer a rapid screen for cognitive deficit in the\nResearchers have used a variety of cutoff points with the\nSPMSQ to define persons with impaired cognition, and we\nused a variant of what was suggested by Fillenbaum without\ndefining different standards for persons of different races or\neducational levels because of a relatively homogenous\nstudy sample in terms of race and because of incomplete\ndata for education. We placed all respondents into three\ngroups on the basis of their answers to the SPMSQ. Persons\nwho got zero to three items correct on the SPMSQ were\nclassified as having severe ADRD. Those who got four to\nsix items correct were classified as having moderate ADRD,\nand those who had seven or more items correct were classi-\nfied as not having ADRD. Persons who responded via a\nproxy were assigned to the severe ADRD group if the rea-\nson for a proxy response was noted as being due to cogni-\ntive limitations; when a proxy was due to other reasons, the\nperson was assigned to the \"none\" category. Descriptive\nanalyses were stratified by this variable, and ADRD status\nwas controlled for in multivariate models directly as well as\ninteracted with ADL limitations and the presence of four se-\nrious health conditions.\nDefining the Cost of ADRD\nWe took a broad perspective of cost and included costs\nthat were paid for by the Medicare program, costs paid out\nof pocket by families for items such as caregiving and pre-\nscription drugs, and costs that were not reimbursed such as\ncaregiving provided by family members. Intangible costs\nsuch as pain and suffering associated with disability were\nnot measured in this study, but we did quantify levels of dis-\nability to provide context for cost figures. The period for\nNLTCS interview. For Medicare-financed costs we identi-\nfied the services that were provided to an individual for the\nclaims. For other cost items, we annualized costs that were\nmeasured in terms of utilization in the month or week prior\nto the 1994 interview. For example, respondents reported\nthe number of hours of assistance for ADL limitations that\nthey received in the week prior to the 1994 NLTCS. We\nmultiplied this figure by 52 to obtain an estimate of the\nnumber of hours of ADL assistance that a respondent re-\nceived in the year prior to the 1994 NLTCS, which we then\nmultiplied by an hourly wage rate.\nNursing home costs.--Given that a person answered the\n1994 community NLTCS survey, it was rare that they re-\nported having been in a nursing home in the previous 365\ndays. Only 3 persons reported having spent time in a nurs-\ning home in the year prior to the 1994 NLTCS. For this rea-\nson, we did not include nursing home costs in our total costs\nestimates based on self-reports. Our Medicare costs noted\npreviously did include Medicare-financed stays in skilled\nnursing facilities.\nADL helper cost.--For community respondents, we\nused the self-reported number of hours of ADL help an indi-\nvidual reported receiving for the week prior to the 1994\nNLTCS. We multiplied this by 52 to devise an annual esti-\nmate of hours of ADL help received. We then multiplied\nthese hours by the $6.95/hr figure used by Leon and col-\nleagues (1998) to estimate the cost of caregiving for persons\nwith ADRD. When the number of hours of ADL support\nwas missing, we assigned zero ADL help hours if the per-\nsons had no ADL limitations, because in such a case they\nhad missing ADL help hours because of the skip pattern of\nthe database. If they had at least one ADL limitation, we im-\nputed the ADL help hours received if they had a missing\nvalue for this item as follows. For respondents with valid re-\nsponses for ADL hours, we estimated a median regression\nmodel with number of ADL hours in the previous week as\nthe dependent variable. The explanatory variables used\nwere number of ADL limitations, male gender, and married.\nUsing the coefficients obtained from estimating this model\non persons with valid responses, we then predicted the value\nfor number of ADL hours in the previous week for persons\nwith missing ADL hours. The predicted values ranged from\n2 hr/week to 13.5 hr/week. We then multiplied the predicted\nhours for persons with missing values by 52 to develop an\nestimate of the number of ADL support hours received in\nhad their ADL hours of help imputed in this manner.\nAssuming that the ADL hours from the week prior to the\nsurvey held constant for the entire 365-day period may have\nresulted in an overestimation of the mean and median ADL\nhelper cost and, therefore, the total annual cost of ADRD.\nWe chose this approach over projecting forward (e.g., as-\nsuming costs in the week prior to the survey held constant\nfor the 365 days after the interview) because it ensured that\nwe measured costs for the same period of time for each per-\nson, whereas going forward would have meant differential\ncost follow-up periods because of mortality. In multivariate\nanalyses, the assumption we made had no effect in deter-\nmining the relative importance of explanatory variables in\nexplaining total cost, because the annualization approach\nwe used simply multiplied a weekly cost by a constant for\neach person.\nTo provide information regarding the sensitivity of our\nfindings to these imputation methods, our data show results\nwhen all cases (including those with imputed ADL hours)\nwere used and when only cases in which no imputation was\nnecessary were used. The overall multivariate results were\nrobust and did not differ when cases with imputed ADL\nhelper hours were used.\nMedicare cost.--The amount actually paid by Medicare\nfor all services provided by Medicare for the 365 days prior\nto the 1994 interview date was measured for all respon-\ndents.\nIADL helper cost.--The approach was identical to that\nused for ADL helper cost, including the imputation of miss-\ning values for IADL helper hours among persons with some\nlimitations after those with no IADL limitations had their\nIADL helper hours set to zero. We multiplied the number of\nhours reported for the week prior to the 1994 interview by\n52 to get annual hours. The hourly price of $6.08 for IADL\nhelper hours was used following Leon and colleagues\nputed on the basis of their reported limitations in IADLs\nwith the same regression model approach that was used\nfor missing ADL hours and the same explanatory model.\nThe predicted hours of IADL support ranged from 4 to 25\nhr/week.\nPrescription costs.--Respondents were asked how many\nprescription drugs they had taken during the past month. We\nmultiplied this number by 12 to obtain the annual number of\nprescription medications being taken. We used the average\ncost per prescription medication used by Ostbye and Crosse\n(1994) to obtain annual prescription drug costs.\nControlling for Disability and Comorbidity\nA distinction should be made between the cost of caring\nfor a person with a particular condition, such as ADRD, and\nthe incremental cost that a condition such as ADRD adds\nto the total cost of caring for an individual above and beyond\nthe otherwise expected cost. We wanted to identify any ad-\nditional cost associated with having ADRD after accounting\nfor disability and comorbidities. If comorbidity and disabil-\nity are not separately accounted for, then it is likely that the\ncost effect of ADRD will be biased. Therefore, we con-\ntrolled for these factors in our multivariate models in addi-\ntion to a limited number of demographic variables.\nDisability.--Disability was measured by the number of\nlimitations in the following six ADLs: dressing, bathing,\neating, getting in and out of bed, moving around inside the\nhome, and using the toilet. A limitation meant that a person\neither needed help doing the activity or used equipment to\nhelp them do the activity. We used number of ADL limita-\ntions to stratify the sample for descriptive purposes and in-\ncluded number of ADL limitations as a linear control vari-\nable, on the basis of descriptive findings that hours of help\nand overall cost rise with increasing number of ADL limita-\ntions. We also used the number of limitations in IADLs and\nbehavioral problems, such as getting lost, forgetting to do\nimportant things, and losing one's temper frequently, to\ncharacterize the sample and illustrate differences among the\nthree ADRD groups (severe, moderate, and none). We did\nnot control for limitations in IADLs in multivariate models\nbecause of their high degree of collinearity with limitations\nin ADL.\nComorbiditiy.--The presence of certain diseases has\nbeen found in past work to be important in explaining varia-\ntions in costs of health care generally (Bass, Looman, &\nganova, & Hornbrook, 1996), and costs for caring for per-\nsons with ADRD specifically (Gutterman et al., 1999). We\nused self-reported information from the 1994 NLTCS on\nthe presence of four common conditions both to control for\nseverity of illness and to investigate whether having ADRD\naltered the total costs of caring for an individual with a par-\nticular condition given the presence of ADRD. The pres-\nence of the following four conditions was measured at the\n1994 NLTCS: heart attack, cerebrovascular event/stroke,\ncancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nFor heart attack and stroke, the survey asked whether either\nhad occurred during the past year, so a person answering yes\nexperienced this adverse health event during the period for\nwhich we measured total costs. For cancer and COPD, the\nsurvey asked whether these chronic conditions were present\nat the time of the survey, so the onset of the disease was not\nclear if they reported that they had the condition. We in-\ncluded binary variables equal to 1 if a respondent self-reported\na condition, zero otherwise. We controlled for these four\nconditions separately as well as interacted them with se-\nvere ADRD to determine whether the presence of severe\nADRD altered the total cost of caring for a person with one\nof these diseases compared with the costs of caring for a\nnondemented person with one of these conditions.\nAnalytical Methods\nFor much of our analysis, we compared persons across\nthe three ADRD groups (severe, moderate, and none), either\nin terms of disability or cost, then estimated multivariate\nmodels to more fully adjust for multiple predictors of total\ncost. For the descriptive statistical analyses, we compared\nthe median total cost of care stratified by the three ADRD\ncategories and the number of limitations in ADL, catego-\nrized as follows: no limitations, one or two limitations, three\nor four limitations, and five or six limitations. We compared\nthe median values of the total cost variable because of the\nright-skewness of the total cost of care. To determine\nwhether there were any significant differences between the\nmedian annual cost of care among the severe, moderate, and\nno ADRD groups, we conducted a nonparametric signifi-\ncance test of the null hypothesis that the sample medians in\nall three groups were equal (severe  moderate  none),\nwith the probability of equality calculated using Fisher's ex-\nact test and operationalized in Stata version 7.0 (StataCorp,\nFor the multivariate models, we used median regression\nwith bootstrapped standard errors (Chernick, 1999; Efron &\nously mentioned, the total cost of care variable displayed a\nright-skewed distribution, and for that reason we chose to\nfocus our analyses on the median. In comparison with ordi-\nnary least squares (OLS), median regression analyzes varia-\ntion in the median of the dependent variable over the inde-\npendent variables (rather than variation in the mean) and\nmedian regression fits a regression surface that minimizes\nthe sum of the absolute residuals (rather than minimizing\nthe sums of squares of the residuals). We calculated stan-\ndard errors via the bootstrap method (with 3,000 replica-\ntions) to minimize the effects of heteroskedasticity (Gould,\nof the median regression analyses, we also estimated a stan-\ndard OLS model with bootstrapped standard errors and ro-\nbust regression that downweights the importance of outliers.\nThe substantive results of the median regression did not dif-\nfer from the results of these alternative models.\nRESULTS\nPrevalence and Disability\nwith 322 persons (6.7%) having moderate ADRD. Persons\nwith severe ADRD were generally more disabled than were\npersons with moderate or no ADRD (Table 1). Persons with\n.001) and had more limitations in ADLs than did persons\nwith the highest level of cognitive awareness (2.5 limita-\ntions vs. 1.2 for persons with the highest cognition, p \n.001). They also had more limitations in IADLs and re-\nceived more hours of caregiving support for both ADL and\nIADL support. Persons who had complete data for hours of\nADL and IADL support reported more hours compared\nwith those whose hours of support had to be imputed.\nTherefore, our imputation method, although it produced a\nsimilar distribution of responses, may have underestimated\nhours of caregiving support used. Further, although the\nmean number of hours of caregiving for ADL help was at\nleast doubled among the severe ADRD group relative to the\nmoderate and no ADRD groups, the percentage of the sam-\nple receiving at least some ADL help hours was more simi-\nlar, suggesting that some severely demented community-\ndwelling persons may not have received needed services.\nSeveral behavioral items related to ADRD were more\ncommon among those classified as having severe ADRD,\nlending credence to our classification scheme. Persons with\nsevere dementia were more likely to report sometimes get-\nting lost (7.2% vs. 1.3% for those with best cognition, p \nsometimes losing their temper or having an outburst (14.2%\nvs. 8.1%, p .001). Although the percentage of respondents\nanswering affirmatively to these behavioral questions was\nnever more than one fifth of the population even among the\nsevere ADRD group, the pattern observed was consistent\nwith what would be expected if the ADRD classification re-\nliably measured dementia, namely that those with severe\nADRD were much more likely than controls to report symp-\ntoms. However, the low overall rate of reporting suggests\nsystematic underreporting, in part due to missing values that\nwe did not try to impute for these variables; missing cases\nwere noted as not having the problem in question.\nPersons with severe ADRD had median annual total costs\nthat were nearly 10 times as high as those for persons who\nshowed a similar pattern whereby mean total costs were\nhigher among the severe ADRD group compared with the\nnone group, with costs for the moderate ADRD group in be-\ntween. Item-specific costs were greater for persons with se-\nvere ADRD compared with those without ADRD for all\ncost items except prescription drugs. Thus, the level of costs\namong groups differed more than did the relative contribu-\ntion of cost items to total costs.\nCaregiving costs for both ADL and IADL limitations\nwere the largest contributors to total costs across the ADRD\ngroups, with care financed by Medicare generally the next\nlargest component of total costs. The median cost of ADL\nhelp was higher when we considered only persons with no\nmissing information compared with median costs calculated on\nComparing the median and mean item-specific costs within the\nmoderate and no ADRD strata illustrated the skewed nature\nof the cost variables; for example, the median Medicare cost\nfor persons with no ADRD was $0, whereas the mean was\nDisability, Comorbidities, and Cost\nThere was a hierarchical ordering on total cost by the\nnumber of limitations in ADLs, classified into four groups\nand stratified by ADRD status. The number of limitations in\nADLs had a stronger effect on total costs than did ADRD\nstatus. Within a given ADRD stratum, the median total\ncosts were more than 10 times greater for persons with five\nor six limitations in ADLs relative to persons with no ADL\nlimitations (Table 3). However, total costs always varied by\na factor of 5 or less when we compared severe versus no\nADRD within a given ADL limitation strata. For example,\nmedian costs were $552 for the nondemented group versus\n$2,634 for those with severe ADRD within the strata of per-\nsons who had no ADL limitations. The same comparison of\n($28,302) among persons with five or six limitations in\nADLs showed a similar relationship.\nThe presence of a serious health condition had an impact\non the total cost of caring for an individual, but the effect\nwas neither as great nor as clear as that between ADL limi-\ntations and cost (Table 4). The median total cost of caring\nfor a person with any of the four major health conditions\nhighlighted (cancer, stroke, COPD, and heart attack) was 3\u00ad4\ntimes higher when that person had severe ADRD com-\npared with no ADRD. For example, among the 223 persons\nwho experienced a stroke during the previous year, median\ncosts for those who also had severe ADRD were $17,197,\ncompared with $7,056 for those with moderate ADRD and\ntionship was shown among persons with more than one of\nthese chronic conditions as well as for persons with none of\nthem, the latter group having the lowest median total costs\nDeterminants of Adjusted Cost\nIncreased disability, comorbid health conditions, and se-\nvere ADRD were all important determinants that increased\ntotal annual costs. Each additional limitation in an ADL in-\nthose of persons with good cognition. However, the costs of\nthose with moderate ADRD did not differ from those with\ngood cognition. When an individual experienced a heart at-\ntack or stroke in the year prior to the 1994 NLTCS, or if\nthey reported a chronic lung disease at the 1994 survey,\ntheir costs were significantly higher compared with persons\nwithout these ailments. The magnitude of the effect on costs\ndiffered among the four conditions, with a recent heart at-\nPersons who reported that they had cancer at the 1994\nTable 1.

Age and race had small effects on to-\ntal cost.\nSevere ADRD not only had a direct effect on total costs,\nbut also served as an effect modifier for the impact of dis-\nability, but not for comorbid health conditions, on cost (Ta-\nble 5). The interaction of severe ADRD and the number of\nADL limitations showed an increase in total cost of $2,180\n(p  .001) for each limitation in an ADL experienced by a per-\nson who was severely demented. None of the interactions\nbetween comorbidities and severe ADRD were significant.\nThus, for these conditions severe ADRD did not serve as an\neffect modifier of cost.\nDISCUSSION\nIn some past work on the cost of ADRD, researchers have\nmeasured the cost of caring for persons with ADRD, but not\nthe cost of ADRD per se. Our approach was an attempt to\navoid misattributing cost increases to ADRD and to tease\nout other key determinants of cost. It is difficult for us to di-\nrectly compare our results with other work because the stud-\nies in question differ in many respects, most notably in\nhow ADRD was identified, the samples used (particularly\nwhether they included community and nursing home resi-\ndents), and the types of costs measured (Coughlin & Liu,\nsample we used oversampled disabled elderly persons, our\nprimary contribution is not calculation of per capita costs by\nTable 2.

Further, we\nshow that the presence of ADRD serves as an effect modi-\nfier for limitations in ADLs, a finding worthy of more\nstudy.\nDisability is a more powerful predictor of total costs than\nis ADRD severity in both descriptive and multivariate anal-\nyses. It is likely that ADRD is related to level of ADL limi-\ntations, but our study cannot shed light on any causative link\nbetween severe ADRD and disability because of our cross-\nsectional measurement of these two variables. Not surpris-\ningly, both recently occurring comorbid conditions (heart\nattack and stroke occurring within the past year) and COPD\nprevalent on the interview date increase total annual costs\namong persons who have no or moderate ADRD. We esti-\nmated the effect of these conditions on cost because they are\ncommon causes of morbidity and mortality, and as the pop-\nulation continues to age, their effect on costs both individu-\nally as well as in conjunction with ADRD will be important\ndeterminants of the overall cost of caring for community-\ndwelling elderly persons.\nWe tested whether severe ADRD serves as an effect\nmodifier of the relationship between four common health\nconditions and cost. Some past work has shown that persons\nwith ADRD receive less Medicare-financed health care\ncompared with others with similar conditions, raising the\npossibility that demented individuals receive less intensive\nformal health services as a result of their mental status (Tay-\nlor & Sloan, 2000). We do not find that this is the case, us-\ning a broader definition of costs.\nOur study replicates in a national sample what has previ-\nously been found in local samples regarding composition of\ncosts for persons with ADRD: Medicare-financed health\ncare services do not compose the majority of total costs of\ncaring for community-dwelling elderly persons: Caregiving\nservices do. Although the magnitude of such costs differs by\nADRD status, the relative composition of cost items is\nroughly the same. We find this to be true in spite of two fac-\ntors that both work in the opposite direction. First, we used\nfairly conservative hourly price estimates for caregiving\nhours taken from other studies because the self-reported in-\nformation on whether care was paid for or not, and if yes,\nhow much, is too incomplete to be reliable. The magnitude\nof the average cost estimate per person by ADRD status is\nsensitive to the hourly price used, but the multivariate work\nidentifying the relative importance of individual character-\nistics on costs is not. Second, we have fairly precise mea-\nsurement of payment by Medicare for formal health ser-\nvices because we used Medicare claims data. Other studies,\nsuch as that of Hu and colleagues (1986), for example, did\nnot use such data. The use of Medicare claims plausibly re-\nsults in a more precise estimate of cost of acute services\ncompared with estimates of such costs based on self-report,\nbut any undercounting of such costs by self-reports in past\nstudies was not sufficient to make such care a larger propor-\ntion of total costs relative to informal care in our study.\nSeveral limitations of our study should be noted. First, we\nstudied the costs of ADRD only among community-dwell-\npersons with ADRD are aged less than 65. Such persons\nTable 5.

Regression coefficients represent dollars.\nwere not included in our sample. It is likely that cost differ-\nentials between persons with and without ADRD would be\neven larger for persons aged less than 65 because the age\nimpact on morbidity strengthens with age. Second, the\nscreening procedure used in the NLTCS resulted in a more\ndisabled sample compared to the entire population aged 65\nand older making our per capita cost estimates in particular\nlikely overestimates. However, our models included more\nthan 1,700 community respondents who did not report a\nlimitation in an ADL in the 1994 NLTCS. Thus, we had a\nsubstantial amount of variation in terms of disability in the\ncommunity sample. Having more healthy elderly persons in\nour sample would likely serve to increase cost differences\nbetween persons with ADRD and the no ADRD group and\nwould likely increase the relative impact of ADRD, disabil-\nity, and comorbidities on cost. Third, our cost estimates did\nnot account for the burden on caregivers in terms of physi-\ncal and emotional strain, delay of care seeking, and reduced\nemployment, among other hardships involved in providing\ncare to demented individuals (Gwyther, 1998; Jones & Pe-\nters, 1992). Such costs are real, but they are very subjective\nfrom the standpoint of monetizing them. Fourth, our cost\naccounting approach ensured that each person had costs\nmeasured for 1 year exactly, which is good but introduces a\nsurvivor bias to the sample because costs just before death\nare generally elevated, likely causing overestimates of the\npoint estimates of median annual cost of care. The annual-\nization procedure we used should not bias the multivariate\nfindings, because multiplying a weekly cost by 52 simply\nintroduces a constant to the dependent variable for each\ncase in the study. Finally, we were not able to assess costs in\ninstitutions such as nursing homes in a similar manner to al-\nlow us to identify the effect of residential location on costs,\nor to see what factors may predict cost variation within\nnursing home.\nFurther work is needed that compares the adjusted cost of\ncaring for persons in community settings, traditional nurs-\ning homes, and other residential long-term care settings that\nare specifically designed to care for persons with ADRD.\nWork that analyzes the cost of caring for a person and also\nconsiders any treatment benefits and/or benefits to care-\ngivers would be of the most use for families who must make\ntreatment decisions as well as for clinicians and policymak-\ners who are trying to hold down costs while maintaining an\nappropriate level of care for persons with ADRD.\n"
