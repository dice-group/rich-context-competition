Kraemer\u00b6\n Key words: night eating, disordered eating, BMI, meal\npatterns\nIntroduction\nNight eating syndrome (NES)1 was introduced by\nStunkard et al. (1) to characterize a clinical disturbance\nthat seemed to have caused or contributed to the main-\ntenance of obesity in a subset of some severely obese\npatients. The defining features of NES were evening\nhyperphagia or night eating, morning anorexia, and\nsleep disturbance. After being ignored by researchers\nfor several decades, in recent years NES has become\nthe focus of increasing scientific investigation. Although\nthere is a growing literature that suggests that\nnight eating (the core behavioral symptom of NES) is\nan important clinical feature among some obese pa-\ntients, epidemiological studies have failed to show a\ncorrelation between night eating and obesity. As de-\nscribed in a comprehensive review of the literature (2),\nhowever, this research has progressed in the absence of\na uniformly accepted definition of NES or its clinical\nfeatures, and the conflicting findings in the literature\nconcerning the association between night eating and obe-\nsity may, in part, be the result of differences in the\ndefinition of NES.\nThe behavioral symptom of night eating has been\noperationalized based on how late in the day (evening or\nnight) the eating episode occurred and/or the proportion\nof total daily calories consumed during the eating epi-\nsode. As illustrated by Striegel-Moore et al. (3), who\napplied five different definitions of night eating to a large\nepidemiological sample of girls, not surprisingly the\nprevalence of night eating varied considerably depending\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

For example,\nwhen defining night eating as eating 25% or more (1) vs.\n50% or more of daily caloric intake after 7 PM (4), the\nprevalence in a large sample of 16-year-old girls was\neating as eating very late in the day (after 11 PM),\nprevalence was reduced to 14.5% (3). The study did not\nexamine whether night eating varies by day of the week\nor time of the year, yet it seems reasonable to assume that\nthe behavior is more common on weekend days than\nduring the week, and it may also be more common in the\nsummer months when many people take vacations and\nhigh school and college students have the opportunity to\nstay up later. This study also found that, with increasing\nage, night eating, especially eating very late in the day,\nbecame considerably more common and ranged from a\nolds.\nHow prevalence of night eating changes over the course\nof adulthood is unclear. For example, given the time de-\nmands of employment, it is possible that younger adults\nare more likely to eat late in the day compared with\nadults over 65 (who may no longer be working full-time\nor at all). Experts have noted that the time of day when\nthe evening meal occurs varies among cultural groups.\nFor example, Italians tend to eat dinner much later than\nAmericans, a difference that has prompted Italian obesity\nexperts to propose that a definition of night eating should\nuse a relatively late cut-off point for time of day (5). To\ndetermine more fully the demographic correlates of night\neating, studies of more diverse population samples are\nneeded.\nFinally, a critical question concerns the clinical signifi-\ncance of the behavior of night eating. Striegel-Moore et al.\n(3) did not find a significant association between night\neating and overweight among their sample of girls 9 to 19\nyears old. It is possible that the association of night eating\nand overweight may be observed in adults, yet we are not\naware of studies that have tested this relationship in a\nrepresentative community sample.\nThe present study addressed these gaps by examining the\nbehavior of night eating in two nationally representative\nsamples of adolescents and adults residing in the United\nStates. In the absence of prior data across a range of ethnic\ngroups and age groups, we did not formulate specific hy-\npotheses concerning ethnic or age group differences in the\nprevalence of night eating. Based on the well-established\nfinding that food intake varies qualitatively and quantita-\ntively between weekdays and weekend days (6), we hypoth-\nesized that night eating would be more common on Fridays\nand Saturdays compared with weekdays. We also hypothe-\nsized that night eating would occur more frequently during\nthe summer months, compared with other times of the year.\nWhether the behavior of night eating is of clinical interest\nhas not yet been established, and we did not formulate a\nspecific hypothesis concerning the association of night eat-\ning and BMI or obesity. To answer these questions, we\ncapitalized on the availability of two large public access\ndatabases, namely the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey (NHANES) III (7) and the Continuing Sur-\nvey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) (8). Each con-\ntains detailed data from a representative sample of non-\ninstitutionalized, civilian U.S. residents concerning food\nintake, including all foods and liquids consumed over a\n24-hour period, time of day of intake, and type of meal (e.g.,\ndinner).\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nDescription of the Surveys\nThe analyses used data from two surveys, the NHANES\nNHANES-III has been described elsewhere (7). Briefly,\nareas in the U.S. The sample was designed to be represen-\ntative of the non-institutionalized, civilian population of the\nU.S., covering the entire lifespan; the age range for the\nsurvey was 2 months and older. The survey data were\nparticipant was interviewed at home and asked to participate\nin a medical examination, which included measurements of\nheight and weight, and a 24-hour dietary intake recall.\nRespondents reported all foods and beverages consumed\nexcept plain drinking water (i.e., not bottled) for the previ-\nous 24-hour time period (midnight to midnight). The\npresent analysis focused on the subpopulation of NHANES-\nIII respondents who were age 13 years or older and either\nHispanic or non-Hispanic black or white. Younger children\nwere not included because it was assumed that their eating\ntimes would be determined largely by their parents. Rates of\nnight eating were not estimated for other ethnic groups\nbecause sample sizes were insufficient for statistically reli-\nable estimates.\nrespondents in 62 geographic areas in the U.S. The sample\nwas designed to be representative of the non-institutional-\nized U.S. population residing in households, covering the\nentire lifespan. The survey consisted of a sample of indi-\nadditional sample of children (age 1 to 9 years) inter-\nviewed in 1998. Each respondent was asked to complete\ntwo food intake interviews (24-hour dietary intake recalls)\nconducted 3 to 10 days apart. Participants were asked to\nreport everything eaten or drunk the previous day between\nmidnight and midnight. To maintain comparability with the\nNight Eating: Prevalence, Striegel-Moore et al.\nNHANES-III data, the present study used only the first day,\nand the analysis focused on the subpopulation of CSFII\nrespondents who were age 13 years or older and either\nHispanic or non-Hispanic black or white.\nStatistical Analysis\nThree definitions of night eating previously examined by\nStriegel-Moore et al. (3) were used: consuming 25% of\nconsuming 50% of the total daily calories between\nconsumed. Because the CSFII and NHANES-III food re-\nmidnight, night was defined as the union of two time\n(depending on the definition) to midnight.\nThe percentage of individuals who exhibited night\neating was estimated for each definition by season of the\nyear, type of day (weekend vs. weekday), age group, gen-\nder, and race/ethnicity. Due to the complex survey de-\nsigns of CSFII and NHANES-III, weighting, stratification,\nand clustering were taken into account in all statistical\nanalyses. Mean and percentage estimates were computed\nSAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Logistic regres-\nsion (PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC in SAS) was used to\nmodel variables associated with night eating. Separate mod-\nels were constructed for each survey and for each definition\nof night eating. Night eating by a given definition (1  yes;\n0  no) served as the outcome variable. The predictors were\ntype of day, season, gender, age group, race/ethnicity, and\nall possible two-way interactions among gender, age, and\nrace/ethnicity. Type of day was coded as weekday (Sunday\nthrough Thursday) or weekend day (Friday and Saturday).\nSeason was coded as winter (December through February),\nspring (March through May), summer (June through Au-\ngust), and autumn (September through November). Age was\n65 years old), and race/ethnicity was coded into three\ncategories (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nHispanic). Obesity was defined as BMI 30 for individuals\nabove age 18 years and at or above the age- and gender-\nspecific 95th percentile of BMI for adolescents. Prior to\nanalysis, all covariates were centered as recommended (9).\nTo adjust for the large number of statistical tests, a conser-\nvative level of statistical significance was adopted (p \nIt has been hypothesized that night eating is associated\nwith obesity (1). To examine this association, obesity\n(binary) and BMI (continuous) were modeled as a function\nof night eating status, controlling for age group, racial/\nethnic group, gender, and total caloric intake throughout\nthe day. Obesity was modeled using logistic regression, and\nBMI was modeled using linear regression (SAS PROC\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nEstimates of demographic characteristics based on the\ntwo surveys are described in Table 1.

Night eating by the first definition (25% kcal\nafter 7 PM) was estimated to be present in more than one-\nthird of the population. Night eating by the other two\ndefinitions (50% kcal after 7 PM and any eating after\n11 PM) was less common; the estimates indicated that fewer\nthan 13% met these definitions of night eating, regardless of\nsurvey. For all definitions of night eating, estimated rates\nwere lower in CSFII than in NHANES-III.\nCorrelates of Night Eating\nWeekdays vs. Weekend Days. Compared with CSFII, the\nfood diaries in NHANES-III more often described eating\non weekend days (36.1% of food diaries in NHANES-III\nvs. 30.7% in CSFII; Table 3), possibly resulting in the\naforementioned greater rates of night eating in NHANES-\nIII. In both surveys, there was a main effect of type of\nday for the definitions involving consuming 25% and\nTable 3, after adjusting for type of day, season, gender, age\ngroup, race/ethnicity, and all possible two-way interactions\namong gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

BMI was not\nassociated with night eating by any other definition in either\nsurvey (p  0.02). Similar models predicting the log odds of\nobesity revealed no association with night eating by any\ndefinition, regardless of survey (p  0.06) (data available\non request).\nDiscussion\nNight eating represents a necessary (but not sufficient)\nbehavioral symptom of NES, yet, to date, no uniform op-\nerational definition has been adopted in the literature. The\npresent study used three definitions commonly found in the\nliterature on NES to explore demographic correlates of this\nbehavior and its possible relation with BMI or obesity. To\nour knowledge, this represents the first attempt to examine\nthe prevalence and demographic correlates and association\nwith BMI or obesity of night eating in a representative\nsample of U.S. adolescents and adults. We found three main\nfindings across the two surveys. One, as expected, the most\ninclusive definition (consuming 25% or more after 7 PM)\nproduced the highest prevalence. Two, for the first two\ndefinitions (which differed by the amount of calories con-\nsumed after 7 PM, namely 25% vs. 50%), but not the third\ndefinition (which involved eating very late during the\nnight), day of the week mattered. And three, prevalence\nestimates varied considerably by age group, with adoles-\ncents being most likely and elderly individuals least likely\nto meet the criteria for night eating. In NHANES, but not\nCSFII, race/ethnicity moderated the relationship between\nage and night eating, with Hispanic and black elderly indi-\nviduals being especially unlikely to meet criteria compared\nwith the other age groups. Finally, gender and race/ethnicity\neffects were observed only in NHANES but not in CSFII;\nmen were more likely than women and black Americans\nmore likely than other racial/ethnic groups to meet the\ncriteria for night eating.\nOur data show that, in the U.S., eating 25% or more of\none's daily caloric intake after 7 PM is common. Quite\npossibly, in cultures where eating the evening meal occurs\nlater in the day than in the U.S., the prevalence of night\neating by this criterion would be far greater still. One\napproach to making the definition more applicable across\ndifferent cultures is to use a time of day that is so late that\nin most cultures, it can be reasonably expected to be statis-\ntically abnormal to still be eating (e.g., eating after 11 PM).\nAnother strategy that has been employed is to define night\neating as eating more than a certain proportion of one's\ndaily intake after the evening meal (for review, see ref. 2),\nbut this approach has its own disadvantage in that the\nmeaning of the evening meal may not be the same for\ndifferent people and that some may eat a considerable\namount of food over a long period of time (grazing) in the\nlate evening or at night, rather than consuming an evening\nmeal.\nAs expected, eating a considerable proportion of one's\ndaily intake after 7 PM was more commonly reported on\nweekends, rather than during weekdays, likely reflecting\nculturally normative practices of cooking more elaborate\ndinners for family or friends or going out to eat on the\nweekend, and this may mean eating later or eating more\nthan usual. Eating out, in particular, has been shown to be\ncorrelated with eating more than when eating at home\nfound to be associated with day of the week, suggesting that\ncultural practices play less of a role in eating very late in the\nevening. One obvious methodological implication of this\nfinding is that studies comparing various population groups\nneed to ensure that comparable days are used when mea-\nsuring night eating. Regarding the clinical assessment of\nfrequency of night eating, similar to the instructions em-\nployed in the assessment of overeating, where episodes of\novereating are not counted when they are culturally norma-\ntive (e.g., the Thanksgiving meal), we recommend that\ncontextual variables such as day of the week be considered.\nOur results regarding age effects extend earlier work with\na sample of adolescents, where we found that with increas-\ning age, night eating (by any definition) became increas-\ningly more common (3). In the present study, night eating\nwas most common among young adults and least common\namong the elderly. Pathology of a behavior is often defined\nin relative terms; what is developmentally expected in one\ngroup (e.g., going out late is more common in teenagers or\nyoung adults than in elderly adults) may be unusual (i.e.,\nstatistically abnormal) in another group. Whether the pa-\nthology of a behavior is clinically significant depends on its\nassociation with a meaningful validator.\nDifferent prevalence estimates by gender or ethnic group\nwere found in only one survey (NHANES-III) and, there-\nfore, need to be interpreted cautiously. These differences\nmay reflect different subcultural practices such as employ-\nment patterns (e.g., working multiple jobs, shift work, etc.)\nor different social norms about eating (e.g., weight concerns\nmay prompt women not to eat late in the day). Information\nabout education and employment status is needed to better\naccount for different prevalences. Because NHANES and\nCSFII differed in many ways, it is impossible to pinpoint\nwhy inconsistent results were found across the two surveys\nconcerning gender and race/ethnicity. The regression coef-\nficients for the gender effect were similar across surveys but\ndid not reach significance in CSFII due to larger variance\nestimates (standard errors), which might be due, in part, to\nthe smaller sample size in CSFII relative to NHANES-III.\nHowever, the regression coefficients for the effect of being\nblack in CSFII did not even approach the magnitude in\nNHANES-III, suggesting that factors other than sample size\nNight Eating: Prevalence, Striegel-Moore et al.\nmay play a role. Effects of both race/ethnicity and gender\nwarrant further investigation. Importantly, our results sug-\ngest that, for other correlates (e.g., age, time of day, or\nseason), findings were quite similar across the two surveys.\nUnexpectedly, we found a significant inverse association\nbetween night eating and BMI for the definition of eating\n25% or more after 7 PM. Individuals who reported night\neating by this definition were slightly thinner than those\nwho did not meet this night eating criterion. The analysis\nwas adjusted for total caloric intake; hence, the difference is\nnot due to night eaters consuming fewer calories in general.\nHowever, this effect was very small and was found in only\none of the two surveys. This adds to the growing evidence\nthat, in non-clinical samples (for review, see ref. 2), night\neaters are less likely than others are to be obese.\nSeveral limitations need to be considered. Because nei-\nther survey collected food diaries for consecutive days,\nnight eating was defined using single day records. Hence, it\nwas not possible to use a more restrictive definition of night\neating, requiring the behavior to occur on a recurrent basis.\nWe cannot rule out that a more regular pattern of night\neating might be associated with elevated BMI or obesity.\nAlso, the two surveys differ in several respects, suggesting\nthat greater confidence should be placed in the results that\nwere consistent across surveys. The survey data did not\npermit examining specifically whether participants experi-\nenced nocturnal eating episodes involving awakening dur-\ning the night and eating before returning to sleep, nor did\nthey include information about the participants' sleeping\npatterns or sleep disorder symptoms. A study comparing a\nsmall sample of obese individuals with NES and obese\nindividuals without NES found that nocturnal eating was\nunique to NES and concluded that NES involved distur-\nbances of sleep and eating (13). Finally, the data are cross-\nsectional, and prospective studies are needed to further\ndetermine the clinical significance of night eating.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that researchers need\nto consider day of the week, age, and possibly gender and\nrace/ethnicity when examining population differences in\nnight eating. Studies are needed to identify critical thresh-\nolds (which may well vary by culture) for determining\nclinical significance of night eating. Our cross-sectional\ndata do not support a link between the behavior of night\neating and obesity in community samples. Future studies\nneed to explore whether adding a frequency criterion (e.g.,\ntwice weekly or more) or other behavioral or affective\ncomponents to identify a syndrome of NES will result in a\nsignificant association with obesity and, if so, will identify\nthe mechanisms that mediate this association.\n"
