The most recent NHANES\nyears or older were included in this analysis.\nMain Outcome Measures Hypertension, defined as a measured blood pressure\nof 140/90 mm Hg or greater or reported use of antihypertensive medications. Hyper-\ntension awareness and treatment were assessed with standardized questions. Hyper-\ntension control was defined as treatment with antihypertensive medication and a mea-\ntension prevalence was highest in non-Hispanic blacks (33.5%), increased with age\nIn a multiple regression analysis, increasing age, increasing body mass index, and non-\nHispanic black race/ethnicity were independently associated with increased rates of\naged 60 years or older had significantly lower rates of control compared with men,\nyounger individuals, and non-Hispanic whites.\nConclusions Contrary to earlier reports, hypertension prevalence is increasing in the\nUnited States.

The third\nNHANES was conducted in 2 phases be-\nthough each of the surveys has an over-\nvey has a smaller sample size and is the\nfirst part of the continuous NHANES.14\nThis may lead to a higher SE for vari-\nvey.15 All participants provided in-\nformed consent and the data were\napproved by the Centers for Disease\nControlandPreventionInstitutionalRe-\nview Board as ensuring confidential-\nity.14 For this analysis, we included data\nonallparticipantsaged18yearsorolder.\nThis includes age, sex, and self-\nassigned race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican\nAmericans, and other racial groups, in-\ncluding non\u00adMexican American His-\npanic whites and blacks). In addition,\nbody mass index (BMI; calculated as\nweight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters) and BP mea-\nsurements and hypertension and diabe-\ntes mellitus history were included.\nA certified operator performed BP\nmeasurements using a mercury sphyg-\nmomanometer and a standardized pro-\ncedure in each survey during the home\ninterviewandduringthephysicalexami-\nnation at home or at a mobile examina-\ntion center. A cuff size appropriate for\ntheparticipant'sarmcircumferencewas\nused. Quality control was ensured by\noperator recertification, procedural\nchecklists, and data review.16,17 In the\n3BPreadingscomparedwith0.5%inthe\nsimilar number of participants in all 3\nphasesreportedthattheyhadneverhad\na BP measurement. Those interviewed\nbut not examined were not included in\nEachsurveyusedsimilarquestionsfor\nhypertension history. We considered a\nparticipant to be hypertensive if the av-\nerage systolic BP (SBP) was 140 mm Hg\nor higher or the average diastolic BP\n(DBP) was 90 mm Hg or higher or if the\nparticipant was currently receiving an-\ntihypertensive medications. The same\ncriteria were used for both diabetic and\nnondiabetic participants. Participants\nwere considered to be aware of their hy-\npertension if they answered \"yes\" to the\ninterview question \"Have you ever been\ntold by a doctor or health professional\nthat you had hypertension, also called\nhigh blood pressure?\" Participants were\nconsidered to be treated if they an-\nswered \"yes\" to the interview question\n\"Because of your high blood pressure/\nhypertension are you now taking pre-\nscribed medicine?\" Participants were\nconsidered to have their hypertension\ncontrolled if they were receiving anti-\nhypertensive medications and their av-\nerage SBP was less than 140 mm Hg and\naverage DBP was less than 90 mm Hg.\nA separate control variable was defined\nfor diabetic participants. Participants\nwere considered diabetic if they an-\nswered \"yes\" to at least 1 of these inter-\nviewquestions:\"Haveyoueverbeentold\nby a doctor that you have diabetes or\nsugar diabetes?\" or \"Are you now tak-\ninginsulin?\"or\"Areyounowtakingdia-\nbetes pills to lower blood sugar?\" Dia-\nbetic participants were considered to\nhave controlled hypertension if they\nwere receiving antihypertensive medi-\ncation and their mean BP was below the\nrecommended target. Because of the\nchange in recommendations between\ndiabetic individuals, we defined con-\ntrolinthosewithdiabetesbasedon2cri-\nteria for BP: a mean SBP of less than 140\nmm Hg and a mean DBP of less than\n90 mm Hg, and a mean SBP of less than\n130 mm Hg and a mean DBP of less than\nEach survey oversampled African\nAmericans, Mexican Americans, and\nToadjustforoversampling,specialsam-\nplingweightswereincludedinouranaly-\nsis.Theseweightsalsoadjustedfornon-\nresponse bias and poststratification\npopulation totals.20 To obtain estimates\nof the sampling errors, a Taylor linear\napproximation method and jackknife 1\nprocedures were used in each of the 3\ncomplexsampledesign,SASversion8.02\nWesVar version 4.2 (Westat Inc, Rock-\nville, Md) software were used.

Potentially, the in-\ncreased prevalence may be related to an\nincrease in BMI as well as the aging of\nthe US population. Based on an analy-\nsis of NHANES data, Flegal et al26 re-\ncently reported an increase in preva-\nlence of obesity during this same period.\nOur analysis indicates that BMI was as-\nsociatedwithhigherhypertensionpreva-\nlence after adjusting for age, sex, and\nrace/ethnicity and contributed to 2%--\nmore than half--of the 3.6% increase in\nhypertension prevalence. Therefore, the\nincreasedprevalenceofhypertensionbe-\npears to be partially related to but not\nsolely secondary to the increase in BMI.\nAlthough awareness rates remained\nunchanged, treatment and control rates\nhave each increased by approximately\nest survey, treatment and control rates\nrates observed in the Framingham data\nof hypertensive patients were treated\nand 29% had their hypertension con-\ntrolled.27 Furthermore, our analysis\nshows that, compared with younger in-\ndividuals with hypertension, older in-\ndividualswithhypertensionhavealower\nrate of control despite being equally\nlikely to be treated.

The\nincrease in hypertension prevalence in\nwomen, non-Hispanic blacks, and older\nindividuals highlights the need for in-\nterventions that would target preven-\ntion in these groups.

Al-\nthough control rates have improved\nceptably low. If the increase in hyper-\ntension control rates remains at the\ncurrent pace, the 50% target for hyper-\ntension control by 2010 will not be met.\nPrograms targeting hypertension pre-\nvention to achieve the 16% target for\nimproving awareness and treatment are\nof utmost importance for the health of\nthe US population.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design,\nanalysis and interpretation of data, and critical revi-\nsion of the manuscript for important intellectual con-\ntent: Hajjar, Kotchen.\nAcquisition of data, drafting of the manuscript, and sta-\ntistical expertise: Hajjar.\nFunding/Support: NHANES was conducted and funded\nby the National Center for Health Statistics.
