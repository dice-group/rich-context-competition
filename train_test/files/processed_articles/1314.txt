The negative social and health consequences associ-\nated with alcohol and drug disorders are well understood\nhigh rates of criminal justice involvement and violence\nThe negative correlation between religiosity (religious\nbeliefs and church attendance) and the likelihood of sub-\nstance use disorders (of both alcohol and drugs) has been\nunderlying this correlation remain poorly understood.\nEvidence does suggest that religiosity is most strongly\nassociated with the decision to use or completely abstain\nfrom alcohol or drugs, and less strongly associated with\nabuse or dependence, among those who do drink or use\ndrugs [36]. It is likely that prohibitions against the use of\nalcohol and drugs contained in some religious doctrines\nresult in lower rates of substance abuse and dependence\namong individuals that subscribe to such beliefs.\nHowever, there exists little research investigating other\nmechanisms that may also be involved. There are at least\ntwo potential mechanisms. First, it has been posited that the\ngeneral salutary effects of religion might be due to\nincreased social support [14, 47]. The increased social\nsupport afforded by religion might also influence the rela-\ntionship between religious involvement and the likelihood\nof substance use disorders [43]. In particular social support\nmight have two effects: (1) supporting social norms against\nalcohol use through stigma; and (2) providing a source of\nsocial interaction that does not involve alcohol or drugs. We\ncall this the ``social support mediation'' hypothesis. This\nhypothesis has been tested in at least three samples; two\nsamples of college students [11, 35], and the other in a\nsample of young African-American adults [6]. These stud-\nies did not find evidence for the social support hypothesis.\nA second potential mechanism is that better mental health\namong religious individuals may be a factor in their lower\nrates of substance use disorders. Individuals with mental\nhealth disorders have an increased likelihood of substance\nhealth disorders are comorbid with substance use disorders,\nthe mental health disorder typically precedes the substance\nuse disorder [28], or is often independent of the substance use\ndisorder [16]. Further, individuals who are more religious, or\nwho attend church more frequently, have generally been\nfound to have better mental health [29, 33].\nFrequency of religious attendance is often a proxy for\ndegree of religiousness; getting up on Sunday morning and\nspending that time at church instead of at the beach or\nfishing or having breakfast with friends, indicates that\nreligion is important to the person. If important, then it is\nlikely to be used when confronting psychological, social,\nand medical stressors. There is a wealth of research\nshowing better coping and less depression among those\nwho use religion to cope, both cross-sectional and longi-\ntudinal [31]. Furthermore, religious attendance has been\nshown to directly predict speed of remission from depres-\nsion among stressed adults [30]. Religious attendance is\nalso highly related with altruism, which is frequently\nrelated to lower rates of depression and other psychiatric\ndisorders [50]. Thus, mental health may mediate the rela-\ntionship between religiosity and the likelihood of having a\nsubstance use disorder. We call this the ``mental health\nmediation'' hypothesis.\nIn this paper we investigate these two potential under-\nlying mechanisms using data from the National Survey on\nNSDUH survey is ideal for this purpose. It is nationally\nrepresentative, includes DSM-IV measures of both alcohol\nabuse/dependence disorders and drug abuse/dependence\ndisorders, and contains extensive information on possible\nconfounders and mediators of the substance abuse and\nreligion relationship, such as sociodemographic factors,\nmental health status, and social support. This is important,\nas one of the criticisms of prior work on religion and health\nin general is ``the inability of studies to date to tease apart\nattendance from more general efforts to remain active in\nthe community'' [52].\nOur first goal was to estimate, with the precision that our\nextremely large sample allows, the extent to which the\nlower likelihood of substance abuse or dependence disorder\namong the religious is due to abstinence from any substance\nuse, and to what extent the lower likelihood is due to a lower\nlikelihood of a substance use disorder, given some sub-\nstance use. For example, religious people might have a\nlower likelihood of an alcohol use disorder because they are\ncompletely abstinent, or because among religious individ-\nuals who do drink, there are lower rates of alcohol use\ndisorders. Second, we investigated whether the effects of\nchurch attendance and religious beliefs on the likelihood of\nsubstance use disorder were mediated by social support\n(social support mediation hypothesis). Third, we investi-\ngated whether the lower likelihood of substance use disor-\nders among the religious is mediated by the fact that the\nreligious generally have better mental health (mental health\nmediation hypothesis). To our knowledge, these questions\nregarding possible mediators have never been empirically\ninvestigated using nationally representative data. We con-\nducted separate analyses for alcohol and drug use disorders.\nMethods\nSample\nWe utilized cross-sectional data from the 2002 NSDUH\n(n = 36,370). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health\nServices Administration conducts the NSDUH annually for\nthe primary purpose of estimating the prevalence of illicit\ndrug, alcohol, and tobacco use in the United States [54].\nOur sample included respondents age 18 and older and\nhas an average response rate of 75% [54]. The sample is\ndescribed in Table 1.\nAfter complete description of the study to the subjects,\ninformed consent to continue the interview was obtained\nverbally. (Written consent was not obtained because the\nnames of subjects are not used in the screening and inter-\nview process.) To assure confidentiality, questions about\nsubstance use, mental health problems, and treatment are\ncompleted though audio-assisted interview technology\nwhere respondents key their responses directly into a lap-\ntop computer. Remaining questions are completed through\na computer assisted in-person interview. The survey is\navailable at www.icpsr.umich.edu. Our analyses included\nall adult respondents.\nDependent variables\nPast year use of alcohol and illicit drugs\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health contains data that\nallowed us to construct binary indicators of any alcohol use\nin the past year, and any illicit drug use in the past year.\nAlcohol abuse/dependence and drug abuse/dependence\nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health is a structured\ninterview which contains items to construct DSM-IV\ndiagnoses of past year alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence,\ndrug abuse (for marijuana, hallucinogens, inhalants, tran-\nquilizers, cocaine, heroin, pain relievers, stimulants, or\nsedatives), and drug dependence for the same drugs. We\nconstructed binary indicators of whether the individual had\nan alcohol abuse/dependence disorder in the past year, or\ndrug abuse/dependence disorder in the past year.\nIndependent variables\nChurch attendance and religious beliefs\nThe independent variables in the logistic regression models\nincluded three religiosity variables. The first variable\nwas the number of times the subjects attended religious\nservices (excluding weddings and funerals) in the past year.\nVariable N % Weighted\nDemographics\nAge\nGender\nRace\nMarital status\nEducation\nIncome\nOther characteristics\nReligiosity\nNumber of religious services in past year\nMy religious beliefs are very important\nMy religious beliefs influence my decisions\nSocial support\nNumber of friends who you share personal issues/concerns with\nIn NSDUH, participants were asked how often they had\nattended religious services in the past year (0 times, 1 to 2\npublications this has often been collapsed into 0 to 24 times\nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia\nUniversity using NSDUH data compared individuals who\nnever attended religious services with those who attended\nat least weekly [44]. In this paper, we utilized categories of\nhave used in prior work with NSDUH [17, 18].\nThe other two items were Likert scale questions ``For\neach statement, please indicate whether you strongly dis-\nagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree...Your religious\nbeliefs are an important part of your life...Your religious\nbeliefs influence how you make decisions in life.'' The\nimportance of the subject's religious beliefs in his or her\nlife was dichotomized with agree and strongly agree\ncombined as one category and disagree and strongly\ndisagree as the other; subjects' responses on whether reli-\ngious beliefs influenced their decisions were similarly\ndichotomized.\nSocial support\nThe social support variables included number of friends\n(not including family members) the respondent shares\npersonal issues and concerns with (none, one, two or three,\nfour or five, and more than five), number of friends subjects\nspent time with (none, one, two or three, four or five, and\nmore than five) and number of friends who really like or\ncare about the subjects (none, one, two or three, four or\nfive, and more than five). These were coded with a series of\nindicator variables.\nMental health status\nOur measure of mental health status was based on a\nmeasure of non-specific psychological distress known as\nthe ``K6.'' The K6 was developed and validated for use in\nthe National Health Interview Survey and subsequently\nincluded in the NSDUH [24, 25]. The K6 includes six\nquestions that measure on a 0 to 4 scale how frequently\nrespondents experienced symptoms of psychological\ndistress (nervousness, hopelessness, restlessness, depres-\nsed, feeling worthless, feeling that everything is an effort)\nduring the month in the past year when they were feeling\ntheir worst emotionally. These values were summed to\nyield a score between 0 and 24 indicating the level of\npsychological distress. We categorized these values into\nthree groups with roughly equal numbers of subjects in\neach group based on its rank (0 to 1, 2 to 5, and 6 or\nmore).\nSociodemographic factors\nolder), gender, race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic\nBlack,Hispanic,and other), marital status(married, widowed,\ndivorced, or separated and never been married), education\n(less than high school, high school, some college, and college\nAnalyses\nWe first used logistic regression to regress any alcohol use\nin the past year on sociodemographic factors and the reli-\ngion variables (Table 2). We conducted a separate logistic\nregression to assess the effect of each religion variable, due\nto the multicollinearity among the three. Then, among\nindividuals who drank in the past year, we regressed the\nTable 1 continued\nVariable N % Weighted\nNumber of friends who you spent time with\nNumber of friends who really care/like about you\nScore indicating level of serious mental illness\nDependent variable\nPast year alcohol use\nPast year alcohol abuse/dependence\nPast year illicit drug use\nPast year illicit drug abuse/dependence\nbinary indicator of past year alcohol abuse/dependence on\nthe sociodemographic factors and the religion variables.\nAgain we used a separate regression for each religion\nvariable.\nTo investigate whether the relationship between any\nalcohol use and the religion variables, or between alcohol\nabuse/dependence and the religion variables among those\nwho drank, might be mediated by social support, we then\nrepeated the above models, adding the social support\nvariables (Table 3). To the extent that these added pre-\ndictors modified the magnitude of the effect of the religious\nvariables, we interpreted social support as a possible\nmediator [3].\nIn an analogous fashion we investigated mental health\nstatus as a mediator between any alcohol use and the\nreligious variables, or between alcohol abuse/dependence\nand the religious variables, among those who drank\n(Table 4).\nA parallel set of analyses was conducted for use of any\nillicit drugs, and drug abuse/dependence among those with\nany drug use (Tables 5, 6, 7). All these regression models\nwere run with survey design variables incorporated for\nstratification, clustering and weighting using Survey\nLogistic procedure in SAS version 9.2.\nTest of mediation\nAs a sensitivity analysis, and to test formally for mediation,\nwe also conducted our analyses using path analysis tech-\nniques, utilizing Mplus version 5.1. These models formally\nincorporate a direct pathway (e.g., the pathway directly\nfrom religious attendance to the alcohol or drug outcomes)\nTable 2 Effect of church attendance and religiosity on past year\nalcohol use and alcohol abuse/dependence, controlling for\nsociodemographics\nAny alcohol use Any alcohol abuse/dependence\nChurch attendance\nImportance of religion\nImportance of religion in making decisions\nTable 3 Effect of church attendance and religiosity on past year\nalcohol use and alcohol abuse/dependence controlling for sociode-\nmographics and social support\nAny alcohol use Any alcohol abuse/dependence\nChurch attendance\nImportance of religion\nImportance of religion in making decisions\nTable 4 Effect of church attendance and religiosity on past year\nalcohol use and alcohol abuse/dependence controlling for sociode-\nmographics and mental health status\nAny alcohol use Any alcohol abuse/dependence\nChurch attendance\nImportance of religion\nImportance of religion in making decisions\nTable 5 Effect of church attendance and religiosity on past year drug\nuse and drug abuse/dependence, controlling for sociodemographics\nAny drug use Any drug abuse/dependence\nChurch attendance\nImportance of religion\nImportance of religion in making decisions\nand an indirect pathway (e.g., the pathway from religious\nattendance to social support to the alcohol or drug out-\ncomes). Testing the significance of the indirect pathway\nrepresents a formal significance test of mediation effects.\nThese path models were estimated using mean and vari-\nance adjusted weighted least-squares estimator and the\nprobit link function [41].\nTo show effect sizes of religiosity on study dependent\nvariables, we present odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-\ndence intervals from the logistic regressions in the tables,\nwhile reporting significant P-values for the indirect path-\nways from the path analyses in the text. We believe ORs,\nwhich can be calculated from exponentiating logistic\nregression coefficients, are easier to interpret and give the\nreader the best sense of the magnitude of the effects of the\nindependent variables. However, we believe path tech-\nniques are the best way to formally test for mediation.\nResults\nIn NSDUH, 46% of respondents reported attending church\ntimes per year, and 30% reported attending 25 or more\ntimes per year (Table 1). Seventy-eight percent reported\nthat religious beliefs were an important part of their lives,\nand 75% reported that their religious beliefs influenced the\ndecisions they made.\nIn models that controlled for sociodemographic factors,\nbut not other covariates, the three measures of religiosity\nwere significantly associated with a lower likelihood of any\npast-year use of alcohol, and any past-year use of illicit\ndrugs (Tables 2, 5). For example, compared to those who\nattended 25 to 52 times per year, the ORs for any alcohol\nuse for those with occasional church attendance (3 to 24\ntimes per year) and infrequent church attendance (0 to 2\ntimes per year) were 2.09 and 2.29, respectively. Similarly,\nfor those who said religion was not important in their lives,\nthe odds of any alcohol use was 1.55 the odds for those\nwho reported religion was important in their lives. Mea-\nsures of religious attendance and religious beliefs were also\nsignificantly associated with a lower likelihood of abuse/\ndependence among those with any alcohol use (although\nthe magnitude of the effect was smaller than for the\nabstinence step), but religious attendance and religiosity\nwere not significantly associated with drug abuse/depen-\ndence among those who used any illicit drugs.\nThe addition of social support variables had only small\neffects on the magnitude of the church attendance and\nreligious beliefs coefficients in any of the alcohol use, drug\nuse, alcohol abuse/dependence, or drug abuse/dependence\nregressions (Tables 3, 6). However, in our path analyses\nthe indirect pathways (religiosity affecting social support,\nsocial support affecting alcohol, or drug outcome) were\nstatistically significant in the relationship between the three\nmeasures of religious attendance/religiosity and any alco-\nhol use (P \\ 0.001). In these regressions, religiosity was\nassociated with greater social support and social support\nwas positively associated with any drinking. For this rea-\nson, in the corresponding logistic regressions the magni-\ntude of the ORs actually increased (e.g., from 1.55 for\nreligion not being very important vs 1.00 for religion being\nimportant (Table 2) to 1.59 for religion not being very\nimportant vs 1.00 for religion being very important\n(Table 3) with the addition of the social support variables,\nrather than decreased as expected. Consistent with the\nrelatively small changes in the ORs we observed with the\naddition of social support variables to our logistic regres-\nsion models, the magnitudes of the indirect pathway\nregression coefficients were generally only about 10% the\nmagnitude of the direct pathway regression coefficients.\nTable 6 Effect of church attendance and religiosity on past year drug\nuse and drug abuse/dependence, controlling for sociodemographics\nand social support\nAny drug use Any drug abuse/dependence\nChurch attendance\nImportance of religion\nImportance of religion in making decisions\nTable 7 Effect of church attendance and religiosity on past year drug\nuse and drug abuse/dependence, controlling for sociodemographics\nand mental health\nAny use Any drug abuse/dependence\nChurch attendance\nImportance of religion\nImportance of religion in making decisions\nThe addition of mental health status had only small\neffects on the church attendance and religiosity coefficients\nin the alcohol use, drug use, alcohol abuse/dependence, or\ndrug/abuse dependence regressions (Tables 4, 7). However,\nwhen we tested the significance of the indirect pathway\n(e.g., religiosity influencing mental health, mental health\ninfluencing alcohol, or drug outcome), we found evidence\nfor mental health mediation in the regression of alcohol\nabuse/dependence on church attendance (P \\ 0.001), and\nthe regressions of any drug use on church attendance\n(P \\ 0.001) and any drug use on religious beliefs). These\neffects were in the direction we hypothesized, with the ORs\nfor the religion variables decreasing with the addition of the\nmental health variables. Again, the magnitude of the coef-\nficients for the indirect pathway was small compared to the\nmagnitude of the coefficients for the direct pathway.\nDiscussion\nUsing a large, nationally representative community sample,\nwe found a highly significant, negative relationship between\nreligiosity and the presence of a substance use disorder in\nthe past year. Consistent with prior research [36], our results\nstrongly suggest that the lower likelihood of substance use\ndisorder is due mainly to effects on abstinence, although the\ndecreased likelihood of a substance use disorder among\nthose who drink or use illicit drugs is not an unimportant\nfactor.\nImportantly, our multivariate models allow us to esti-\nmate the independent effects of religion, and compare the\nmagnitude of these religious effects to the effects of soci-\nodemographic factors. For example, in our analyses a\nstrong predictor of alcohol use was gender (for males,\nOR = 2.50, reference group females). For sake of space,\nsociodemographic variables were not included in our\ntables. The gender effect was similar to the magnitude of\nthe OR for any alcohol use among those who attended\nchurch 0 to 2 times per year, compared to the reference\ngroup of 25 times or more. Thus, not only is the negative\nassociation between religiosity and the likelihood of a\nsubstance use disorder significant, the magnitude of the\neffect is large.\nFurther, we found that religiosity is quite common. This\nis consistent with other national surveys that show the\nprominent role of religion in American life [13, 46]. Thus,\nthe fact that religiosity is quite common, combined with the\nfact that there is a strong negative relationship between\nreligiosity and substance abuse suggests that religion may\nplay an important role in decreasing substance abuse in the\nUnited States.\nTo our knowledge, our hypotheses had not been directly\ninvestigated previously using national data. We found little\nevidence for either our ``social support mediation''\nhypothesis or the ``mental health mediation'' hypothesis.\nThat is, in some cases the indirect pathways were statisti-\ncally significant; however, the inclusion of the mediating\nvariables to our models had only small effects on the\nmagnitude of the religion coefficients. We would note that\nthis situation, in which relatively modest effects are highly\nsignificant, is not uncommon when analyzing extremely\nlarge data sets. Further, while we expected the magnitude\nof the OR to decrease with the addition of the putative\nmediators, in some cases it increased. That is, in some\ncases, in fully specified models, the effects of religion were\neven larger than in the unadjusted models, although, again,\nthe magnitude of the change was modest.\nThis study has several important limitations. The\nNSDUH has no information on religious affiliation (e.g.,\nwhether an individual is Catholic, or Baptist, or Jewish),\nand so we were not able to investigate how this factor\ninfluenced the likelihood of a substance use disorder. We\nwould refer interested readers to an excellent study by\nMichalak on this topic [36], and note that the strength of\nthe association between religiosity and substance use dis-\norders likely differs for different religious groups. This is\nnot surprising, given the different views different reli-\ngions take on alcohol, from utilizing it in their sacraments\n(e.g., Catholics) to completely forbidding its use (e.g.,\nMormons).\nThe literature describes several dimensions of religios-\nity, such as intrinsic religiosity (intrinsic motivators for\nreligiosity, such as importance of religious beliefs) and\nextrinsic religiosity (extrinsic motivators for religiosity,\nsuch as becoming established in a community), or orga-\nnized religiosity (religious attendance and participation in\norganized social religious activities) and non-organized\nreligiosity (prayer, meditation) [1, 22, 33]. Although our\nstudy measured beliefs and attendance, NSDUH does not\nassess non-organized religiosity behaviors/indicators as\nprayer, meditation, or reading religious texts that have been\nposited elsewhere to be influential [32].\nBecause our data are cross-sectional, we can say nothing\ndirectly regarding causality, although there are three pos-\nsible causal relationships. First, religion may be a causal\nfactor in decreasing the likelihood of having a substance\nuse disorder in the past year. Second, the use of alcohol\nmay be a causal factor in decreasing religiosity and church\nattendance. In particular, if an individual is abusing sub-\nstances or is substance dependent, he or she may be less\nlikely to attend church because of feeling guilty or simply\nnot having the time to attend church because he or she is\nspending that time seeking substances or using them. This\nalternative explanation does not, however, fit as well for\nour measures of religiosity other than church attendance\n(i.e., importance of religious beliefs, influence of religious\nbeliefs on decisions, etc.). Third, there might be a common\ncausal factor, for example a personality trait or genetic\nfactor, that both increases the likelihood of substance use\nand abuse and decreases the probability of church atten-\ndance [21], such as novelty seeking [9].\nSocial support and mental health are linked, in that good\nsocial support may be associated with better mental health.\nNevertheless, we feel it makes sense to investigate these\nvariables separately. We would note that it is not unusual\nfor variables in social science investigation to be associated\nwith each other: race is linked with income and education,\neducation is linked with income, health is linked with age,\nand so on. In our opinion, there are significant differences\nbetween church attendance and social support, and even\nmore differences between social support and importance of\nreligious beliefs. Clearly, many individuals who state that\ntheir religious beliefs are important do not have good social\nsupport, and not all individuals with good social support\nare religious.\nOur cross-sectional data do not allow us to capture the\nvariability that may occur over time in both an individual's\ndrinking and drug use, and also in his or her religiosity.\nOur work suggests many areas for future research, using\nboth qualitative and quantitative techniques. In particular,\ngiven that religiosity is associated with lower rates of\nsubstance use disorders, and the magnitude of the rela-\ntionship is large, future studies are needed to investigate\nwhat the ``active ingredient'' in religion is. The use of large\nnational data sets such as in the present analysis allows us\nto investigate associations and some possible mediators,\nusing relatively crude measures. However, qualitative\nstudies might be important in disentangling these complex\nrelationships and phenomena, and provide new hypotheses\nfor future quantitative studies.\nWe also need to better understand possible moderators\nof the relationship between religiosity and alcohol and drug\noutcomes. That is, are the effects equally strong for men\nand women, or single and married individuals?\nA traditional reason for identification of risk or protec-\ntive risk factors for disease is to decrease risk factors and\npromote protective factors. However, there is no consensus\non the clinical and public policy implications of the inverse\nassociation between religiosity and substance use disor-\none key concern regarding promotion of religion as a\npossible means of decreasing substance abuse is separation\nof church and state [2], especially since many substance\nuse services are government funded. Thus, we also need\ngreater discussion of the clinical and public policy impli-\ncations, if any, of this type of work.\nIn conclusion, using data from a large, nationally rep-\nresentative survey, we have shown that religious involve-\nment is significantly associated with a lower likelihood of\nalcohol use, alcohol abuse/dependence, and drug use, and\nthe magnitude of the effects is large. These effects do not\nappear to be mediated by either social support or mental\nhealth status. Prospective studies are needed to help sort\nout causal questions in the religion-substance abuse\nrelationship.\n"
