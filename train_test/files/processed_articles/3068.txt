However, many patients are seen\nby their physicians in the afternoon. Because plasma glucose levels are higher in the\nmorning, it is unclear whether these diagnostic criteria can be applied to patients who\nare tested for diabetes in the afternoon.\nObjectives To document diurnal variation in fasting plasma glucose levels in adults\nnot known to have diabetes, and to examine the applicability to afternoon-examined\npatients of the current diagnostic criteria for diabetes.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data from the US population\u00ad\nbased Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) on par-\nticipants aged 20 years or older who had no previously diagnosed diabetes, who were\nwho fasted prior to blood sampling.\nMain Outcome Measures Fasting plasma glucose levels in morning- vs afternoon-\nexamined participants; diabetes diagnostic value for afternoon-examined participants.\nResults The morning and afternoon groups did not differ in age, body mass index,\nwaist-to-hip ratio, physical activity index, glycosylated hemoglobin level, and other fac-\ntors. Mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels were higher in the morning group (5.41\nticipants with fasting plasma glucose levels of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or greater was\nhalf that of participants examined in the morning.

There\nwas no statistically significant trend by\nage in these disease prevalence ratios\n(P.50), even though prevalence of\nboth conditions increased markedly\nwith increasing age. For example,\namong those aged 60 years or older, the\nprevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in\nmorning subjects was 7.0%; in after-\nnoon subjects, the prevalence of those\nwith fasting plasma glucose levels of 7.0\nmmol/L (126 mg/dL) or greater was\nBecause the morning and afternoon\ngroupswerevirtuallyidenticalexceptfor\nfasting plasma glucose, it would be ex-\npected that diabetes prevalence would\nalso be identical in the 2 groups. We\nused this feature to determine the glu-\ncose values that would be diagnostic for\ndiabetes and impaired fasting glucose in\nafternoonsubjects.Underthecurrentdi-\nagnostic criteria, derived from subjects\nexamined in the morning, the fasting\nplasmaglucosevaluedistinguishingdia-\nbetic from nondiabetic individuals is 7.0\nmmol/L (126 mg/dL). In NHANES III,\nthis corresponds to the 97.2th percen-\ntile of fasting plasma glucose (diabetes\nprevalence of 2.8%). For afternoon sub-\njects, the 97.2th percentile value for fast-\nmg/dL). Similarly, the diagnostic value\nfor impaired fasting glucose (6.11\nmmol/L [110 mg/dL]) in morning sub-\njects corresponded to the 89.8th per-\ncentile; this value in afternoon subjects\nAs found for glucose, mean fasting\nserum insulin and C peptide levels were\nsignificantly higher in subjects exam-\nined in the morning (61.9 pmol/L and\npared with those examined in the af-\nnmol/L) (P.001 for both analytes).\nCOMMENT\nThese data from a nationally represen-\ntativesampleofadultsdemonstratethat\nthere are clinically significant differ-\nences in fasting plasma glucose levels\nbetweensubjectsexaminedinthemorn-\ning and in the afternoon. We estimate\nthat glucose values indicating diabetes\nfor patients tested in the afternoon\nlower than the current diagnostic cri-\ngreater. If the current criterion were\nappliedtoafternoonpatients,abouthalf\nthecasesofundiagnoseddiabeteswould\nbemissedinthisgroup.Indeed,because\nof the consistent decline in fasting\nplasma glucose throughout the morn-\ning, even the difference between 8 AM\nand 10 AM glucose values can be sig-\nnificant.\nMany patients in the ambulatory care\nsetting are seen in the afternoon, and\nthese patients can be asked to fast for\nat least 4 hours before testing for dia-\nbetes. Regardless of the time of day that\npatients are tested, physicians need to\nconfirm the diagnosis by repeat test-\ning on a different day. For those ini-\ntially tested in the afternoon, a confir-\nmatory morning test may be advised.\nEarly morning rises in fasting glu-\ncose levels and insulin requirements\n(the \"dawn phenomenon\") have been\nobserved in patients with diabetes2 and\ndiabetic persons. Nocturnal eleva-\ntions in growth hormone and early\nmorning increases in cortisol secre-\ntion have been explored as contribu-\nshowing higher fasting levels of plasma\nglucose, serum insulin, and serum C\npeptide in morning subjects are con-\nsistent with the existence of a dawn phe-\nnomenon in nondiabetic subjects.\nREFERENCES\n1.
