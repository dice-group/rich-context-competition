Our covariates are\ngrouped into four categories of risk factors for smoking:\nsocioeconomic status, health care, life course and health,\nand partner and social support.

From a research perspective, there\nhas been less of an emphasis on mothers' health and health\nbehaviors during the period following the birth despite the\nfact that experts view the postpartum period as a ``life\nredefining transition'' marked by profound physiologic\nchanges in conjunction with new stressors, such as par-\nenting challenges, body-image changes, and time and role\nconflicts [1]. As a result, during the postpartum period the\nmother may focus intently on her baby's well-being while\nneglecting her own well-being. Behaviors such as alcohol\nand tobacco use suspended during pregnancy may re-\nemerge in the postpartum period [2]. Of particular interest\nare maternal health behaviors during pregnancy and post-\npartum that may not only harm the mother's health but also\nhave potentially negative effects on the health of the child.\nExposure to secondhand smoke after birth puts infants at\nrisk. Recent studies show increased emergency room visits,\nhospitalizations, and sick days due to respiratory illnesses\namong children ages 0\u00ad4 years who are exposed to sec-\nondhand smoke [3].\nR.

Perhaps as a result of the wide-\nspread discussion of the ill-effects on infant outcomes,\nmany women abstain from or decrease substance use dur-\ning pregnancy [8]. Data from the 2004 National Survey on\nDrug Use and Health [9] show significantly lower rates of\ntobacco use among pregnant women. Cigarette smoking in\nthe past month was reported by 18% of pregnant women\nin a study on lay advice regarding alcohol and tobacco use\nwith 105 low-income pregnant women who smoked prior\nto pregnancy, over half abstained from smoking one or\nmore months during their pregnancies [8].\nIf women abstain from or quit smoking during preg-\nnancy, an important maternal health question is whether\nthey resume (or begin) smoking after the birth of the child.\nIn a study on smoking relapse in postpartum women,\nresearchers found that 94% of women who quit smoking\nduring pregnancy reported that concern for the health of\ntheir unborn baby was their primary reason for quitting.\nWhile 91% stated that they intended to abstain from\nsmoking after the baby was born, by 6 months postpartum\nonly 30% of them were still non-smokers [10].\nPast studies on smoking during the time surrounding\npregnancy suggest that lower income, less education,\nWhite ethnicity, age 20\u00ad29 years, and not being married to\nthe biological father of the baby place mothers at risk [11].\nContextual factors that also play a role are alcohol con-\nsumption, not breastfeeding, number of household smok-\ners, and maternal depression. In a study by Martin et al.\n[11], women who drank one or more alcoholic drinks per\nweek were more likely to smoke, less likely to quit, and\nmore likely to relapse than women who drank less than\nthat. Women who lived with another smoker were also\nmore likely to smoke at 24 months postpartum. Mothers\nwho did not breastfeed were more than twice as likely to\nsmoke and greater than four times more likely to relapse.\nPostpartum depression was also positively correlated with\nsmoking at 24 months postpartum but was not related to\nsmoking relapse.\nAlthough research has documented factors associated\nwith maternal smoking, we need a more in-depth under-\nstanding of changes in smoking behaviors through the\npregnancy and postpartum periods. Our study adds to the\nexisting literature by including more in-depth measures of\nmaternal psychosocial factors that may contribute to post-\npartum smoking. We examine whether the risk profile for\nsmoking during pregnancy is similar to the risk profile for\nwomen who abstain from smoking during pregnancy but\nresume afterwards, or if it is possible to differentiate these\npostpartum smokers. A psychosocial framework incorpo-\nrates an individual's psychological well-being, family\nenvironment, and access to health and financial resources.\nWe include measures of the mother's mental health,\navailability of social support, and relationship status with\nher partner. We also include a religious attendance variable\nas one measure of access to social support. Greater fre-\nquency of religious service attendance has been associated\nwith lower rates of smoking [12, 13]. We differentiate\nbetween US-born and foreign-born Mexican origin women\nin addition to the more commonly analyzed categories of\nWhite, Black, and Hispanic women, as research has shown\nthat US-born and foreign-born women differ greatly in\ntheir smoking behavior [14]. Information on mother's\nhealth insurance, education, and poverty is included. The\naddition of these variables to the existing literature on\nsmoking among postpartum women can further our\nunderstanding of the psychosocial context that may predict\nwhich women are most likely to smoke during the vul-\nnerable postpartum phase.\nIn this study we take a closer look at changes in smoking\npatterns among women during pregnancy and through the\nfirst year postpartum period. We focus on the effects of\npsychosocial factors among at-risk mothers by observing a\nsample with a large number of unmarried urban mothers.\nUnmarried mothers are especially vulnerable after the birth\nof a child due to the precarious conditions often associated\nwith single parenthood. We explore what contributes to\npostpartum smoking, that is, smoking after birth, both\namong women who did not smoke during pregnancy and\nwomen who did. Given that many of these postpartum\nsmokers stopped smoking during pregnancy because of the\nhealth risks for the infant, we explore what risk factors\ncontribute to their starting smoking again with an eye\ntowards better informing postpartum maternal and child\nhealth care.\nMethods\nData\nThe data used in this study are drawn from the Fragile\nFamilies and Child Wellbeing Study conducted by\nPrinceton and Columbia Universities [15]. The Fragile\nFamilies Study is an ongoing, longitudinal, birth cohort\nstudy of children born to predominantly unmarried parents.\n4,898 births. Parents were interviewed at the time of the\nchild's birth, as well as at 1, 3, and 5 years following the\nbirth. For this study we draw on data from the birth and\n1-year follow-up interviews.\nOur analytic sample consists of 3,522 1-year postpartum\nmothers. Of the 4,898 mothers interviewed at the time of\nthe child's birth in the initial baseline sample, we excluded\nexcluded the 578 mothers who were pregnant at year 1\nbecause their smoking behavior is no longer simply post-\npartum, 193 mothers in the ``other'' race category because\nthis is an ambiguous and heterogeneous group, and 71\nmothers who smoked during pregnancy but not in the year\nafter birth, a group too small to analyze separately. We\nused Stata's multiple imputation methods to impute values\nfor 169 mothers who were missing data on one or more\nanalysis variables. Results using the multiple imputation\ntechnique did not substantively differ from results using\nlistwise deletion (results available upon request).\nVariables\nOur dependent variable is a three-category indicator of\npregnancy and postpartum smoking based on maternal self\nreports. We categorize mothers as ``non-smokers,'' ``con-\nstant smokers,'' and ``postpartum smokers'' based on\nquestions asked about smoking at birth and at the 1-year\nfollow up. At birth, mothers were asked, ``During your\npregnancy, how many cigarettes did you smoke?'' We\ncoded mothers as non-smokers during pregnancy if they\nanswered ``none,'' whereas mothers are coded as smokers\nduring pregnancy if they answered ``less than 1 pack a\nday,'' ``1 or more but less than 2 packs a day,'' or ``2 or\nmore packs a day.'' At year one, mothers were asked\nwhether they smoked cigarettes in the past month. We\ncoded mothers as non-smokers in the year after birth if they\nanswered ``no'' to this question; mothers were coded as\nsmokers in the year after birth if they answered ``yes'' to\nthis question. Thus, our three smoking categories are (a)\nnon-smokers, mothers who reported that they did not\nsmoke during pregnancy nor during the year following\nbirth, (b) constant smokers, mothers who reported smoking\nboth during pregnancy and in the year following birth; and\n(c) postpartum smokers, mothers who reported that they\ndid not smoke during pregnancy but did smoke in the year\nfollowing birth. Table 1 shows the distribution of our\nsample into these three categories: 72% of mothers were\nnon-smokers, 17% were constant smokers, and 10% were\npostpartum smokers.\nOur covariates are grouped into four categories com-\nprising mothers' psychosocial factors: socioeconomic sta-\ntus, health care, life course and health, and partner and\nsocial support. Socioeconomic status variables include\nmother's race/ethnicity, education, and household poverty\nstatus. Based on mothers' self-reports of their race, eth-\nnicity, and nativity at baseline, we categorized mothers as\nUS-born Mexican-origin, foreign-born Mexican-origin,\nnon-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and other His-\npanic. Mother's education is categorized as less than high\nschool, a high school degree or its equivalent or some\ncollege or higher. Household income-to-poverty ratios\nwere constructed by comparing the mother's reported\nannual household income to federal poverty guidelines that\nvary according to household composition (number of\nchildren and adults). We distinguish between households\nbelow the federal poverty level ($17,050 for a family of\n300% percent of the federal poverty level, and households\nwith incomes greater than 300% of the federal poverty\nlevel.\nWe include two measures of access to and use of health\ncare, which were taken from the baseline survey. The first\nis the mother's health insurance coverage, a bivariate\nindicator distinguishing between private coverage and\npublic or no health insurance coverage. We group public\nand no health insurance coverage together because very\nfew mothers in our sample reported no health insurance,\nmost likely because those who were uninsured were\nenrolled in Medicaid during pregnancy or at the time of\nlabor. The second is the trimester when the mother began\nprenatal care, which distinguishes between the first tri-\nmester or other (including no prenatal care).\nLife course and health variables include mother's age,\nparity, mental health problem, parenting stress, and\nbreastfeeding. Mother's age at the time of the child's birth\nis coded as a dummy variable to indicate mothers who are\nless than 25 years old. We incorporate a measure of par-\nenting stress that identifies mothers who report that they\n``strongly agree'' that they feel trapped by their responsi-\nbilities as a parent, find that taking care of their children is\nmuch more work than pleasure, or often feel tired, worn\nout, or exhausted from raising a family. We also include an\nindicator to identify mothers who report that they were\ndiagnosed with or prescribed medicine for a mental health\nproblem within the last year. Finally, we include an indi-\ncator of whether mothers breastfed for at least 5 months.\nPartner and social support measures capture the level of\nsupport from the father as well as support from other\nsources. The first is the mother's relationship status with\nthe baby's father at baseline, which distinguishes between\nmarried, cohabiting, dating, and other status (including\nfriends but not romantic, hardly talk, and unknown fathers)\nparents. We also include a dummy for whether the father\nsuggested an abortion, based on mothers' reports, which\nmay capture the father's support of the mother and the\nchild [16]. A third indicator of social support is the father's\nstatus as a smoker. We use data from father reports at\nbaseline and year one about their smoking status. Fathers\nare defined as smokers if they report smoking at baseline or\nyear one. Because a substantial portion (24% of our sam-\nple) of fathers was not interviewed, we also include a\ndummy variable to indicate whether the father data are\nTable 1 Percent distributions and cross-tabulations of smoking status\nPercent distribution of\ncharacteristics for full\nsample of mothers\nCross-tabulations of smoking status by maternal characteristics (rows total to 100%)\nNon-smoker Constant smoker Postpartum smoker\nSocioeconomic status\nMother's race/ethnicity ***\nMother's education***\nPoverty***\nHealth care\nPrenatal care***\nHealth insurance coverage***\nLife course and health\nMother's age***\nParity***\nMental health problem***\nParenting stress**\nBreastfed at least 5 months***\nPartner and social support\nParent's relationship status***\nFather's smoking status***\nmissing. A non-father measure of social support is the\nmother's level of religious service attendance, under the\nassumption that frequent attendance at religious services\nprovides mothers with social networks and psychosocial\nsupport. We distinguish between mothers who attend reli-\ngious services once or more per week, mothers who attend\nless than once per week, and mothers who never attend.\nAnalysis\nWe begin by describing the sample characteristics and\ncomparing the rate of constant, postpartum and non-\nsmoking for each category of our predictor variables. Then\nwe use multinomial logistic regression to predict the risk of\nbeing a constant or resumer smoker relative to non-smok-\ning for each set of predictor variables. Four models sepa-\nrately test the combined effects of each set of predictor\nvariables, and a fifth model includes all variables, in order\nto assess the importance of each set of factors in explaining\nmaternal smoking behavior. We used Stata/SE version 11\nsoftware (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) for all\nstatistical analyses.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the sample distributions of the socioeco-\nnomic, healthcare, life course and health, and partner and\nsocial support measures used in this study (see column 1),\nas well as the bivariate distributions of smoking status by\nmothers' characteristics (see columns 2\u00ad4). All variables\nincluded in our analysis are significantly associated with\nsmoking status, based on chi-square tests of equal distri-\nbutions. That is, the distribution of smoking status for\nmothers defined by the different characteristics identified in\nthe table is significantly different from the distribution that\nwould be expected if smoking were independent of these\ncharacteristics. In general, the table shows that mothers\nwith greater disadvantage--i.e., younger mothers who have\nless education, who live in households below the poverty\nlevel, who receive late or no prenatal care, who have public\nor no health insurance, who have a mental health problem,\nwho report parenting stress, who did not breastfeed, who\nare unmarried, whose partners smoke, who do not attend\nreligious services, and whose partners suggested an abor-\ntion--are more likely to be constant or postpartum smokers\nthan mothers who fall in the more advantaged categories\nacross these characteristics.\nOne exception to this general rule is race/ethnicity.\nMirroring the national pattern, the highest rates of constant\nsmoking are among the generally more advantaged non-\nHispanic white women. Non-Hispanic black women have\nlower rates of smoking than non-Hispanic white women,\nand rates of smoking are even lower among Hispanic\nwomen.\nTable 1 also shows a second predominant pattern with\nseveral interesting exceptions. For most women, constant\nsmoking is more prevalent than postpartum smoking.\nAmong all mothers in the sample, for example, 17% are\nconstant smokers, and 10% are postpartum smokers. This\npattern is true for white women, black women, and\nregardless of education level, poverty status, prenatal care,\nTable 1 continued\nPercent distribution of\ncharacteristics for full\nsample of mothers\nCross-tabulations of smoking status by maternal characteristics (rows total to 100%)\nNon-smoker Constant smoker Postpartum smoker\nReligious attendance***\nFather suggested abortion**\nNon-smokers did not smoke during pregnancy nor during the year following birth; constant smokers smoked both during pregnancy and in the\nyear following birth, and postpartum smokers did not smoke during pregnancy but smoked in the year following birth\nSource: Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study\n** P \\ 0.01; *** P \\ 0.001, on the basis of v2 tests, that the distribution of smoking status is random across variable categories, using the\nsample with complete data\nhealth insurance coverage, age, parity, mental health, par-\nenting stress, father's smoking status, religious attendance,\nand whether the father suggested an abortion.\nHowever, the pattern of constant and postpartum\nsmoking is different for Hispanic mothers, for mothers who\nbreastfeed for at least 5 months, and for married mothers,\namong whom postpartum smoking is more common than\nconstant smoking. About one in ten US-born Mexican\u00ad\nAmerican and other Hispanic women are constant smokers,\nbut 15% of these women are postpartum smokers. Foreign-\nborn Mexican\u00adAmerican women have very low rates of\nsmoking overall, but as with US-born Mexican\u00adAmerican\nand other Hispanic women, they are more likely to be\npostpartum than constant smokers (4 vs. 1.5%). Among\nmarried mothers and those who breastfed for at least\n5 months, about 8% are postpartum smokers, whereas only\n6% of married mothers and 7% of mothers who breastfed\nfor at least 5 months are constant smokers. Although the\nrate of postpartum smoking among married mothers and\nlong-term breastfeeders is not substantially higher than the\nrate of constant smoking, and it is lower than the rate of\npostpartum smoking among unmarried and short-term or\nnon-breastfeeders, the important point is that the pattern is\ndifferent. This different pattern may point to women who\nare effectively ``reached'' by health messages regarding\nsmoking during pregnancy, and who adjust their behavior\naccordingly (i.e., stop smoking) during pregnancy, but not\nnecessarily afterwards.\nA final pattern to note in Table 1 is that constant\nsmoking varies more with socioeconomic and psychosocial\nfactors than does postpartum smoking. For example, 9.6%\nof mothers with a college education are constant smokers,\ncompared to 23.1% of mothers with less than a high school\neducation, a more than 100% difference. By comparison,\n8.4% of mothers with a college education are postpartum\nsmokers, compared to 12.8% of mothers with a less than\nhigh school education, a 50% difference. Similarly, the rate\nof constant smoking is twice as high for mothers who are\nbelow the poverty line versus 300% above the poverty line,\nwho have public versus private insurance, and who never\nattend church versus attend weekly, and it is more than\nthree times as high for mothers who are not in a romantic\nrelationship with the infant's father (versus married) and\nwhose infant's father smokes (versus doesn't smoke). By\ncomparison, with the exception of fathers who smoke (in\nwhich case the difference is over 100%), the difference in\nrates of postpartum smoking across these same categories\nare never greater than 50%. This is the first piece of evi-\ndence that the profile of constant smokers is easier to\nidentify than the profile of resumer, or postpartum,\nsmokers.\nTable 2 shows results from multinomial logistic\nregression equations predicting constant and postpartum\nsmoking relative to non-smoking. In Models 1 through four\nwe examine the effects of each separate set of variables on\nsmoking. The associations correspond to those reported in\nTable 1, and in Models 1\u00ad4 they are almost all statistically\nsignificant. In Model 5, which includes all variables, pov-\nerty is no longer significantly or substantially associated\nwith smoking. This suggests that the distribution and\nassociation of other factors--health care, life course and\nhealth, and partner and social support--with smoking sta-\ntus explains the higher risk of smoking among impover-\nished mothers.\nAll models show a similar pattern of stronger and more\nstatistically significant associations for constant smoking\nthan for postpartum smoking, the second piece of evidence\nthat the profile of constant smokers is more easily identi-\nfiable. For example, less than high school education is\nassociated with a four-fold increase in the risk of constant\nsmoking relative to non-smoking, compared to a 94%\nincrease in the risk of postpartum smoking relative to non-\nsmoking. In the full model, all but four measures have\nstatistically significant associations with constant-smoking,\nwhereas fewer than half of all measures are statistically\nsignificantly associated with postpartum smoking.\nConclusions\nThe results of our study suggest that among postpartum\nmothers, there is a much clearer risk profile for constant\nsmokers (those who smoked during pregnancy and con-\ntinued to smoke at 1 year postpartum) than there is for\nmothers who did not smoke during pregnancy but became\npostpartum smokers. Disadvantage in terms of the various\npsychosocial factors we measured, including measures of\nsocioeconomic status, health care, life course and maternal\nhealth, and partner and social support, was more predictive\nof constant smoking than of postpartum smoking. The\nprevalence of constant smoking is nearly universally higher\nthan the prevalence of postpartum smoking. In other words,\npost-partum smokers--mothers who abstain from smoking\nduring pregnancy but begin or resume smoking in the post-\npartum period--are less common and harder to identify\nthan mothers who smoke during and after pregnancy.\nPsychosocial factors have a strong effect in predicting\nsmoking that persists through pregnancy and the post-\npartum period. Mothers diagnosed with or prescribed\nmedication for a mental health problem within the previous\nyear are more likely to smoke during pregnancy and con-\ntinue to do so after childbirth. Mothers who report high\nlevels of parenting stress are also more likely to be constant\nsmokers, but the relationship is explained by socioeco-\nnomic standing, health status, and access to social support.\nMothers who are not married and mothers who never\nTable 2 Relative risk ratios from multinomial logistic regressions of constant and postpartum smoking compared to non-smoking\nConstant Postpartum Constant Postpartum Constant Postpartum Constant Postpartum Constant Postpartum\nSocioeconomic status\nMother's race/ethnicity (ref = Non-Hispanic White)\nMother's education (ref = some college or higher)\nHealth care\nLife course and health\nPartner and social support\nParent's relationship status (ref = married)\nFather's smoking status (ref = doesn't smoke)\nReligious attendance (ref = 1?/week)\nModels 1 through 5 represent four separate regression equations for each set of variables in our model and a final full model which includes all the variables\nSource: Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study\nattend church, suggesting less access to social support, also\nhave a higher likelihood of constant smoking. Finally,\nmothers are more likely to be constant smokers if the\nbaby's father is also a smoker. While these factors play a\nrole for mothers who smoke during the postpartum period\nbut did not smoke during pregnancy, the relationship is\nmuch weaker.\nAnother important finding of the study concerns racial\nand ethnic patterns in the trajectory of maternal smoking.\nOverall, slightly over a quarter of mothers smoked fol-\nlowing the birth of the child. As expected, mothers who\nsmoked during the pregnancy also tend to continue\nsmoking after their child's birth. Sixty percent of the\npostpartum smokers had smoked during their pregnancy,\nwhile 40% of the mothers who smoked during the post-\npartum period had not smoked during the pregnancy.\nHispanic mothers, however, showed a reversal in this\npattern. Hispanic mothers are more likely to be postpartum\nsmokers than they are to be constant smokers, in contrast to\nWhite and Black women who are more likely to have\nsmoked throughout their pregnancies. This is important\nbecause it appears that the low smoking rates among this\npopulation, which are so closely associated with healthier\nbirth outcomes [17], may be eroded subsequent to the birth\nof their child.\nThe results can be interpreted two ways. One is that it is\neasier to identify or predict who will be a constant smoker\nand thus target interventions for these more entrenched\nsmokers. On the other hand, it seems more difficult to\nidentify who is at risk for postpartum smoking and thus we\nmay miss an opportunity to intervene during this key per-\niod, while mothers are likely to be in contact with the\npediatric health care system. Furthermore, Hispanic\nwomen, married women, and women who breastfeed for at\nleast 5 months are more likely to smoke during the post-\npartum period in spite of having refrained from smoking\nduring pregnancy. This suggests that the mitigating effects\nof prenatal care, social support, and cultural factors on\nsmoking abstention during pregnancy may not extend as\neasily to the postpartum period. Healthcare providers may\nneed to provide ongoing education and support for this\nparticular group of women, in addition to women who\nengage in the more deleterious behavior of smoking both\nduring and after pregnancy.\nAlthough the study uncovers patterns not previously\nobserved, we recognize some important data limitations.\nFirst, our study is based on maternal self-reports of\nsmoking behaviors. The rate in our study of 18.8% prenatal\nsmoking is higher than the 9\u00ad17% range based on national\nestimates [18], at least suggesting that the usual pattern of\nunderreporting smoking is not a concern among this sam-\nple of predominantly unmarried, urban mothers. Maternal\nself-reports of smoking in the Fragile Families data used in\nthis study are comparable to data obtained from the sup-\nplemental medical records gathered at delivery from the\nmothers in the Fragile Families sample [19]. However, a\nrecent study comparing data gathered at two different times\nshowed that maternal reports can vary significantly\ndepending on when the question is asked. Allen and col-\nlaborators [20] compared data from birth certificates based\non maternal medical records and information obtained\nfrom the mother at delivery and a self-administered ques-\ntionnaire mailed approximately 2\u00ad3 months after delivery\nto a subsample of mothers from the birth certificates. The\nauthors estimated that prenatal smoking may be as much as\n31% higher than what is reported at delivery.\nSecond, we do not have information on pre-pregnancy\nsmoking. Thus, we do not know if mothers who did not\nsmoke during pregnancy but do so afterwards are resuming\nprevious smoking behavior or beginning to smoke for the\nfirst time in the postpartum period. We also do not know if\nmothers who smoked throughout the pregnancy and\nbeyond had a history of smoking prior to their pregnancy.\nFinally, because our focus is on disadvantaged, mostly\nunmarried mothers, comparisons with married and gener-\nally more advantaged women are necessary to determine\npatterns in the general population. In spite of these limi-\ntations, the study allows us to explore risk factors previ-\nously unavailable in the study of postpartum smoking.\nClearly, maternal and child health are closely inter-\ntwined, and thus a healthy pregnancy is of great concern\nfor the health of newborns. Indeed, our findings show that\nthe incidence of smoking among pregnant women is well\nHowever, the significance of the mother's health beyond\nthe pregnancy period should not be overlooked. A number\nof researchers have suggested the need for maternal health\ncare to extend beyond the traditional 6 week mark [1, 22,\n23]. Such an approach would allow health care providers\nthe opportunity to implement health promotion strategies\nand interventions to improve women's overall health and\naddress continuing morbidities [22].\n"
