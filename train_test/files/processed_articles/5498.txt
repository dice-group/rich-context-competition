    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhile literature has displayed a link between psychological well-being (i.e. depression, hopelessness, and life satisfaction)\nand health-risk behaviors (i.e. smoking, drinking, suicide, and physical inactivity), the mechanisms underlying this\nrelationship have received little empirical attention. This study examines the mediation effects of social support (from\nfamily, friends, and significant others) that accounted for the link. Participants were 2023 university students (47.7%\nmale). Structural equation modeling showed partial mediation effect of social support between psychological well-being\nand health-risk behaviors. In particular, social support from family and friends jointly mediated about 80percent of the\neffect of life satisfaction and hopelessness on drinking. These results offered novel evidence that helps improve theorizing\nthe mechanisms of the relationship between psychological well-being and health-risk behaviors. They also highlighted the\npotential benefits of social support for university students to help them stay healthy. The implications of these results\nare discussed.\n",

About 21\npercent of\nfreshmen (Wong et al., 2006) experience some degree of\ndepression, and 38percent of university students report feel-\ning hopeless (American College Health Association, 2006).\nThe potential negative outcomes of psychological problems\namong university students have been well documented (e.g.\nHefner and Eisenberg, 2009). For example, depressed indi-\nviduals are at least 20 times more likely to commit suicide\nthan the general population (L\u00e9pine and Briley, 2011).\nNegative psychological well-being is a global public con-\ncern (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2010;\nCapron and Schmidt, 2012), and, hence, research has been\ncalled for greater understanding of their correlates (e.g.\nPsychological well-being and health-risk\nbehaviors\nAn extensive body of literature demonstrates that mental\nhealth problems in early adulthood are associated with sub-\nstance use, suicide, and physical inactivity. For instance,\nlife satisfaction is widely evidenced to be negatively linked\nwith smoking, drinking, suicide, and physical inactivity\namong university students in different cultures (e.g. Grant\net al., 2009).

Good mental health, such as low rates of hope-\nlessness (Merkas and Brajsa-Zganec, 2011), depression\n(Lakey and Orehek, 2011), and high life satisfaction\n(Proctor et al., 2009), has been linked to social support.\nSocial support has also been studied as a protective factor\nagainst health-risk behaviors, such as smoking and drink-\nRecently, there is a growing interest in studying the mediat-\ning role of social support (e.g. Eather et al., 2013; Zhao\nfound that the relationship between depression and sports\nparticipation was mediated by social support. They con-\ncluded that depressive symptoms could possibly function\nto decrease social support from peers and family members,\nwhich, in turn, lowers an individual's motivation to partici-\npate in physical activity. Hence, it is possible that psycho-\nlogical well-being influences health-risk behaviors through\nits effect on social support.\nWhen examining the impact of social support, it is\nimportant to take diverse social agents into account (Rueger\net al., 2010). Family as the primary and first source of sup-\nport is not only associated with greater life satisfaction\n(Nickerson and Nagle, 2004), lower depression (Rueger\nlinked with a lower level of health-risk behaviors, for\ninstance, tobacco and alcohol use (Allahverdipour et al.,\net al., 2006), and physical inactivity (Kim and Cardinal,\nHowever, friends and significant others play a more\ninfluential role during young adulthood than during adoles-\ncence (Fatoba and Bzdzikot, 2015; Pugliese and Okun,\n2014). Young adults spend more time with their peers and\ndepend less on family emotionally and financially (Arnett,\n2000). They start exploring extra-familial influences during\ncollege years (Windle, 2000). Therefore, it is advocated to\nexamine the influence of support from different social\nagents for a better understanding of the support processes\nin the development of health-risk behaviors among young\nadults.\nThe influence of social support from friends has been\nshown in different domains, including psychological well-\nbeing (Sheets and Mohr, 2009), physical activity (Pugliese\nand Okun, 2014), and health-risk behaviors (Kristj\u00e1nsson\net al., 2010). However, literature displays mixed results of\nfriends' support. Some studies demonstrated that peer sup-\nport was positively related to involvement in health-risk\nbehaviors and negative mental well-being (e.g. Walsh et al.,\n2010). On the other hand, some studies exhibited that\nhigher support from friends was associated with positive\npsychological well-being (Sheets and Mohr, 2009) and bet-\nter psychological adaptation when facing stressful life\nOne possible explanation for these mixed results comes\nfrom the measurement strategy for assessing social support\nfrom friends. Some studies examined social support from\npeers (friends) without distinguishing significant others (e.g.\nclose/best friends or romantic partners) from general friends\n(peers) (Pugliese and Okun, 2014); whereas, other studies\ndistinguished significant others from friends (Malinauskas,\nclose friends from classmates (Fatoba and Bzdzikot, 2015). In\nparticular, Rueger et al. (2010) found that support from gen-\neral peers, but not close friend support, had negative associa-\ntions with depression. Perhaps, differentiating significant\nothers from friends provides a clearer understanding of the\nimpact from different social agents. Thus, research assessing\nthe distinctive contributions of support from friends and sig-\nnificant others is warranted.\nThis study\nThis study aimed to understand more the mechanisms under-\nlying the relationship between psychological well-being and\nhealth-risk behaviors by (1) assessing the mediating role of\nsocial support from family, friends, and significant others in\nthe relationship between psychological well-being (i.e.\ndepression, hopelessness, and life satisfaction) and unhealthy\nbehaviors (i.e. smoking, drinking, suicidal thoughts, and\nphysical inactivity) and (2) comparing the relative influences\nof the three types of social agents as mediators. Based on the\nrelevant literature, two hypotheses were proposed:\nHypothesis 1. Social support from the three agents\nwould mediate the relationship between psychological\nwell-being and health-risk behaviors.\nHypothesis 2. The effects of social support would vary\nwith different social agents.\nMethods\nParticipants and procedures\nPrior to data collection, ethical approval was obtained from\nthe University Review Board. Formal consent was obtained\nLai and Ma 3\nfrom the participants or the parents of the participants\nbelow age 18. Their participations were not compensated.\nParticipants were recruited from a local university in 2014\nstandard deviation=1.29years. Demographic information\nof the participants is presented in Supplementary Table 1. A\nquestionnaire, including relevant measures, was distributed\nto and completed by each participant within 15minutes.\nMeasures\nLife satisfaction.Life satisfaction was measured using the\n5-item Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener et al.,\n1985). The Chinese version has good validity and reliabil-\nity (e.g. Ma and Shek, 2013). The response options ranged\nfrom 0=not present to 5=constantly present over the past\nmonth. In this study, the total scores ranged from 0 to 25,\nand the mean scores of the five items ranged from 0 to 5.\nHopelessness. Hopelessness was measured by the Chinese\nversion of 5-item Hopelessness Scale (Shek, 1993), which\nhas been used in many studies in Chinese contexts (e.g.\nto 5=constantly present over the past month, was used to\nyield a total scale score ranging from 0 to 25 and a mean\nscore ranging from 0 to 5.\nDepression.\nDepressive symptoms were measured by\nPatient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al.,\n1999). The scale has been validated in the Chinese popula-\ntion (Yu et al., 2012). The response options ranged from\n0=not at all to 3=nearly every day. In this study, the total\nscores ranged from 0 to 27, and the mean scores of the nine\nitems ranged from 0 to 3.\nPerceived social support.Perceived social support was\nassessed using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived\nSocial Support (MSPSS; Zimet et al., 1988). This scale\nconsists of 12 items that measure perceived social support\nfrom three sources: family (e.g. \"My family really tries to\nhelp me\"), friends (e.g. \"I can count on my friends when\nthings go wrong\"), and significant others (e.g. \"I have a\nspecial person who is a real source of comfort to me\"). The\nMSPSS has good psychometric properties (Chou, 2012;\nZimet et al., 1988). A 4-point scale, where 1=strongly disa-\ngree and 4\n=\nstrongly agree, was used with a higher score\nreflecting a greater level of perceived social support (range\nof scores is presented in Table 1).\nSmoking and drinking.Smoking and drinking behaviors\nwere measured by two separate questions that were used in\nprior studies (e.g. Shek and Yu, 2012). The participants\nwere invited to indicate the frequency of using different\ntypes of substances (i.e. tobacco and alcohol) in the last\nmonths. The response options ranged from 0\n=\nnever in\nmy lifetime to 6=more than five times per week and yielded\na score ranging from 0 to 6.\nSuicidal thoughts.Having suicidal thoughts was measured\nby one question. The participants were invited to indicate\nthe frequency of having suicidal thoughts in the last\nmonths to assess whether the participants had seriously\nconsidered committing suicide. This question was adopted\nfrom the Suicidal Behavior Scale, which was demonstrated\nto be valid and reliable (Law and Shek, 2013). The response\noptions were the same as in the question about smoking and\nyielded a score ranging from 0 to 5.\nPhysical inactivity level. Physical activity level was measured\nvia one question. This question assessed participants' fre-\nquency of participation in moderate to vigorous physical\nactivities, such as swimming and cycling, in the previous\nweek. The response options ranged from 0=never to 7=over\nseven times per week (one time equaled to at least 30min-\nutes) and yielded a score ranging from 0 to 7.\nDemographic information (covariates).Participants were\ninvited to indicate their gender, their place of birth, their\nyear of birth, and the academic year they are in. These char-\nacteristics were included as previous studies showed that\nthese demographic characteristics were associated with\npsychological well-being and health-risk behaviors among\nuniversity students (e.g. Husky et al., 2008; Johnston et al.,\nStatistical analyses\nThe measurement model was tested by confirmatory factor\nanalysis (CFA) to assess the extent to which each of the\nlatent variables was represented by its indicators. The meas-\nurement model with acceptable fit was considered as the\nfinal model of each latent variable. According to each final\nmeasurement model, three indicators with the highest load-\nings were used to represent each latent variable in the later\nanalyses. Path analyses within structural equation modeling\n(SEM) were specified to test the proposed hypotheses.\nOverall model fit was evaluated based on the values of the\nchi-square goodness-of-fit statistic (2), the comparative fit\nindex (CFI), the Tucker\u00adLewis Fit Index (TLI), the root\nmean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the\nstandardized root mean square residuals (SRMR), which\nwere considered acceptable fit if CFI and TLI.90 (Bentler,\nSRMR\n<\nanalyses were performed with Mplus, version 7.31 (Muth\u00e9n\n4 Health Psychology Open \nResults\nDescriptive analyses\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics and the interrelation-\nships of the variables. Cronbach's  values were above .70,\nindicating good internal consistency of all scales tested\n(Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). Values of kurtosis and\nskewness (i.e. kurtosis\n\n7 and skewness\n\n2; West et al.,\n1995) suggested that the data of all variables were normally\ndistributed, except for smoking and suicidal thoughts. The\nlevels of depression and hopelessness were low, with the\nof life satisfaction was 3.10.\nThe prevalence of health-risk behaviors was low (see\nSupplementary Table 2(a)). Over 96percent of the respond-\nents indicated that they had never smoked, and more than\npercent indicated that they had never had suicidal\nthoughts. Of the respondents, 64.8\npercent reported that\nthey had never drunk alcohol in their life or in the past\n3months. However, while only 8.6percent of the respond-\nents met the national guidelines for physical activity\nof the participants indicated that they had not participated\nin any moderate or vigorous physical activities that last\nmore than 30minutes, in the past 7days (see Supplementary\nTable 2(b)). There were no demographic differences in hav-\ning suicidal thoughts (p\n>\n.05) as detected by Chi-square\ntest. Smoking, drinking, and meeting the national guide-\nlines for exercise were more common among males\n(p\n<\n.001). Smoking was less prevalent among students\nwho, aged 18years or below, were local or in their first year\nof university studies (p\n<\n.001). It was more common that\nstudents who were non-Chinese or aged above 18years had\ndrunk alcohol in the last 3months (p<.001).\nMeasurement model (CFA)\nAll measurement models were estimated by maximum like-\nlihood (ML). All error variances were initially set to be\nuncorrelated. Given the unfavorable fit of the initial models\nfor life satisfaction, depression, and hopelessness, item con-\ntent and modification index (MI) were examined. Error\ncovariances were sequentially set for a model re-run. The\nfinal models for each variable revealed a better fit, including\nbigger CFI, TLI and smaller RMSEA, SRMR. Two models\n(one-factor and three-factor) were run for perceived social\nsupport. The three-factor model was retained as the final\nmodel due to the design of this study and better model fit.\nSupplementary Table 3 presents all CFAmodels'fit indexes.\nStructural equation model (path analysis)\nAll structural equation models were performed with maxi-\nmum likelihood estimation robust (MLR) to non-normality\ndue to deviation from normal distribution (Finney and\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics, internal consistencies, and correlations of variables.\nSkew: skewness; Kurt: kurtosis; Others: significant others; M: mean; SD: standard deviation.\nLai and Ma 5\nDiStefano, 2006). Demographic variables: age, gender,\nplace of birth, and academic year were included as\ncovariates.\nMediation by perceived social support\nPath analysis was performed to examine the mediating\nroles of perceived social support in the relationships\nbetween psychological well-being and health-risk behav-\niors (Figure 1). Perceived social support (three factors) was\nincluded as mediators, and variables related to psychologi-\ncal well-being were included as predictors of health-risk\nbehaviors. An error covariance was set between two con-\nstructs (i.e. social support from friends and significant oth-\ners) in the final model due to the unfavorable fit of the\ninitial model. The final model had a better model fit (S-B2\nFigure 1 shows the significant standardized path coeffi-\ncients and R-square statistics. Support from family was sig-\nnificantly related to life satisfaction, hopelessness, drinking,\nand suicidal thoughts. Support from friends was significantly\nassociated with life satisfaction, depression, hopelessness,\nand drinking.

The six indirect effects had an\nestimate ranging from -.03 to .04 and magnitude ranging\nfrom 3.3 to 36.4percent (see Table 3). In particular, support\nfrom family and friends jointly mediated the effects of life\nsatisfaction on drinking (magnitude=78.8%) and the effects\nof hopelessness on drinking (magnitude\n=\nport from significant others had no significant indirect effect.\nDiscussion\nThis study attempted to examine the mediating role of per-\nceived social support in the relationship between psychologi-\ncal well-being and health-risk behaviors. As hypothesized,\nsocial support significantly mediated the link between psy-\nchological well-being and health-risk behaviors. In addition,\nthe mediating role of social support and its magnitude varied\nwith the sources of support.\nMediation by perceived social support from\nfamily\nThe result indicated that psychological well-being pre-\ndicted unhealthy behaviors through the mediating effect of\nperceived family support. In other words, individuals with\nhigher life satisfaction and lower hopelessness had the pro-\npensity to perceive more family support, which was, in\nturn, related to less smoking, drinking, and suicidal\nthoughts. This is consistent with prior research, which\nshowed the positive roles of family support in university\nstudents' alcohol use (Abar and Turrisi, 2008), cigarette\nsmoking (Allahverdipour et al., 2015), and suicidal idea-\ntion (Arria et al., 2009). This study provides evidence that\nlife satisfaction and hope do not only affect adolescents'\nperceived family support (Jiang et al., 2013; Piko and\nHamvai, 2010) but also affect young adults' perceived\nfamily support. Unexpectedly, it was found that family\nsupport did not contribute significantly to the prediction of\nphysical inactivity. Parental support has been identified as\na key correlate of adolescent's participation in physical\nactivity (Trost et al., 2003). However, there is evidence\nthat friends have more influence on university students'\nfrequency of doing exercise than family has (Okun et al.,\n2002). Therefore, it is plausible that once the other media-\ntors, such as friends support, were controlled, the predict-\ning power of family support diminished. The results\nrevealed that depression did not exert a significant effect\non family support. Although this is contrary to the correla-\ntion found in previous studies (e.g. Rueger et al., 2010),\nthis is consistent with the findings of Stice et al. (2004),\nwhich showed that depression did not predict prospective\nchange in parental support. More research is needed to\nunderstand the unclear relationship.\nMediation by perceived social support from\nfriends\nOur findings revealed that support from friends played a\nsignificant mediating role in the impact of psychological\nwell-being (i.e. depression, hopelessness, and life satis-\nfaction) on drinking and physical inactivity. This is con-\nsistent with findings of many studies that individuals with\nlower life satisfaction, higher hopelessness, and depres-\nsion generally perceive less social support from friends\nMohr, 2009). The result demonstrated that individuals\nwith more support from friends engaged in higher levels\nof physical activity and drinking. This indicates that the\npositive effect of friends support on level of physical\nactivity does not only exhibit in adolescents (Kim and\nCardinal, 2010) but also in young adults. Moreover, the\nmediating effect of support from friends on the positive\nrelation between depression and physical inactivity is\nconsistent with the findings where social support has been\nfound to be a partial mediator of the association among\nadolescents (Babiss and Gangwisch, 2009). Given that\nuniversity students perceive alcohol use as a social norm\n(Borsari and Carey, 2003) and almost half of the partici-\npants reported drinking in the past, our findings are in\nalignment with the research that links social support with\ndrinking (Taylor, 2007); peer support had positive effect\non the level of drinking when the young adult had friends\nwho drank. Our findings provide support to Hypothesis 2\nthat the support from family and friends had unique medi-\nating effects. For example, the results revealed that family\nsupport decreased alcohol consumption but friends' sup-\nport increased it (see Figure 1). Moreover, family support\nmediated more proportions of the effect (52.7%) than\nfriends' support did (29.1%) in the prediction of drinking\nby hopelessness (see Table 3).\nTable 3.

Hypothesis 1 was partially supported.\nThis is probably because most participants in this study\nwere freshmen, and the data were collected during the first\n2weeks of the first semester. A review of the literature sug-\ngested that first-year university students are generally mak-\ning a transition into new social networks when they enter\nuniversity (Brissette et al., 2002). Previous studies indi-\ncated that the significant others of an adolescent are usually\ntheir teachers (Rueger et al., 2010), close friends (Rueger\nHowever, it is common that individuals get less in touch\nwith their significant others (e.g. best/close friends) of their\npast social groups after they enter university (Cummings\ngo to different universities or when one of them goes to\nuniversity but the other one does not. Most participants\n(first-year university students) of this study might have not\nyet developed social networks with new significant others\nin their current social group or context. Hence, future\nresearch may explore the mediation using a longitudinal\ndesign.\nConclusion\nIn general, the results showed that perceived social support\nfrom family and friends partially accounted for the effects\nof psychological well-being on health-risk behaviors. In\nparticular, social support from family and friends jointly\nmediated the effects from life satisfaction to drinking and\nfrom hopelessness to drinking, explaining about 80percent\nof the effect from life satisfaction and hopelessness to\ndrinking. These findings suggest that there are other poten-\ntial mediating processes underlying the associations\nbetween psychological well-being and health-risk behav-\niors. These processes could involve factors other than social\nsupport or aspects of social support that were not examined\nin this study. For example, Uchino (2009) proposed that\nboth perceived and received social support are related to\nhealthier behavioral choices (e.g. exercising and less smok-\ning); Babiss and Gangwisch (2009) found that self-esteem\nand social support both acted as the mediators of the rela-\ntionship between depression and physical inactivity. Future\nresearch is needed to explore possible mediators to fully\nexplain these relationships.\nLimitations\nSeveral limitations should be noted. First, data were col-\nlected based on self-report measures. Other methods, such\nas focus group interview, could be useful to help under-\nstand the current findings. Second, participants were rela-\ntively homogeneous (mostly Hong Kong Chinese). Future\nstudy with students from other non-Western countries may\nhelp in the generalizability of the present findings. Finally,\nthe cross-sectional design of this study was not able to\nmake any conclusions about the causal relationships\nbetween the variables. A longitudinal design may provide\nfurther insight.\nImplications\nDespite the above limitations, our findings have theoretical\ncontributions to the literature and practical implications for\nhealth services. Theoretically, this study represents the first\nattempt to investigate the mediating roles of support from\ndifferent social agents in order to extend our understanding\nof the mechanisms between psychological well-being and\nhealth-risk behaviors among young adults. We examined\nthe mediating role of social support from a specific agent in\nrelation to support from other agents in the same model.\nThe finding that support from family and friends had unique\nmediating effects in the associations (i.e. life satisfaction\ndrinking and hopelessness drinking) offered novel evidence\nto improve the theorizing of the mechanisms of these rela-\ntions. Practically, the occurrence of multiple health-risk\nbehaviors (Barnett et al., 2014) among university students\nunderscored the importance of providing effective preven-\ntive programs and interventions. The present findings indi-\ncate that interventions should focus on only the \"helpful\"\nintervening factors for an optimal outcome. For instance, it\nwould be worthwhile to set up schemes to promote family\nsupport for helping university students stay away from\nsmoking, drinking, and suicidal thoughts; whereas, it would\nbe instrumental to provide more fitness classes and pro-\ngrams that aim to cultivate more social support from friends\nin order to increase the level of physical activity.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was supported by the Start-up Fund for New Recruits from\nthe Hong Kong Polytechnic University (account code: 1-ZE36).\nReferences\nAbar C and Turrisi R (2008) How important are parents during\nthe college years?
