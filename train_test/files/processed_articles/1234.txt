Adults with more educa-\ntion and income have a lower burden of disease, fewer phys-\nical limitations, less disability, and longer life expectancy\n(2\u00ad4). The pathophysiological mechanisms linking lower\nsocioeconomic position (SEP) to worse health, however, are\npoorly understood. Exposure to infections and inflamma-\ntion has been proposed as a potentially important determi-\nnant of chronic disease and mortality risk (5), but current\nknowledge of the socioeconomic patterning of infection\nburden in the U.S. population is limited.\nIncreasing evidence points to links between chronic dis-\nease and persistent infections including herpesviruses, Heli-\ncobacter pylori, periodontal pathogens, and hepatitis\nviruses. For example, the herpesviruses cytomegalovirus\n(CMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) have been\nlinked to cardiovascular disease, frailty, cognitive outcomes,\nand Alzheimer's disease (6\u00ad9). Infection with CMV and\nHSV-1 is common in childhood (10), with the viruses re-\nmaining latent in the host throughout the life course. The\nbacterium H. pylori can also lie dormant in the body for\ndecades until the bacteria-host equilibrium is disturbed. Be-\nsides its role in peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori has been im-\nplicated in the development of stroke and ischemic heart\ndisease through inflammatory pathways, lipid alterations,\nand homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction (11).\nHepatitis B virus (HBV), known for its role in chronic liver\ndisease, has been hypothesized to contribute to atherogenic\ndiseases via systemic effects on immune response and colo-\nnization of vascular tissues (12,13). Common periodontal\npathogens such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans\nand Porphyromonas gingivalis have also been implicated in\ncoronary heart disease and stroke and have been found in\natherosclerotic plaques (14,15). Persistent infection has also\nbeen implicated as a factor in the development of functional\nlimitations (1,5). For example, seropositivity to CMV was\nassociated with frailty in one study, and in another study,\nhigher CMV IgG antibody levels were associated with func-\nThe presence of multiple persistent infections may contrib-\nute to morbidity beyond the impact of individual infections\n(17\u00ad20). Presence of one infection might raise the risk of\nother infections or increase the deleterious effects of other\npathogens, or both. For example, work byVilkuna-Rautiainen\nand colleagues suggests that combined infection with HSV\nand periodontal bacteria may increase the risk for cardiovas-\ncular disease through decreasing levels of high-density lipo-\nprotein cholesterol more than each pathogen alone (21). From\na population perspective, burden of infection and inflamma-\ntion has been hypothesized as an explanation for cohort\nSocioeconomic and Race/Ethnic Patterns in Persistent\nInfection Burden Among U.S. Adults\nAnna Zajacova, Jennifer B. Dowd, and Allison E. Aiello\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health, University of Michigan\nSchool of Public Health, Ann Arbor.\nBackground. The pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie health disparities by socioeconomic status and race/\nethnicity are poorly understood. Promising new research suggests that the burden of persistent infection may influence\nadult disease risk and mortality. This article examines how multiple persistent infections cluster within individuals and\nhow this clustering varies by socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity in U.S. adults.\nMethods. We analyze data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (N = 19,275) for adults\naged 17\u00ad90 years. The clustering of infections within individuals is studied using tetrachoric correlations. Multiple indi-\ncator multiple cause models are used to analyze the infection burden construct as measured by seropositivity to Helico-\nbacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, and hepatitis B, focusing on the burden's distribution by\nsocioeconomic position and race/ethnicity. The results are corroborated using ordered logistic regression for a commonly\nused count index of individual infections.\nResults. Seroprevalence of individual persistent infections is positively correlated, suggesting common factors related\nto exposure or susceptibility. Education, income, and race/ethnicity are strong and significant independent predictors of\ninfection burden in U.S. adults in all models.\nConclusion. The disproportionate burden of persistent infections among disadvantaged groups across all ages may be\none biologic pathway by which low socioeconomic position is related to increased rates of morbidity and mortality in the\nUnited States.\nKey Words: Socioeconomic--Race--Ethnic--United states--Adults--Infection--Biomarkers.\nchanges in life expectancy as well as black or white differ-\nRecent research has begun addressing socioeconomic and\nrace/ethnic differences in individual infection status in the\nUnited States. Adults with less education and income, as\nwell as minorities, have been shown to have a higher preva-\nlence of hepatitis viruses, Toxoplasma gondii, H. pylori,\nin the UK found that employment grade was related to bur-\nden of infection as measured by the summed infection se-\nrostatus for three pathogens (CMV, HSV-1, and Chlamydia\npneumonia) (27). However, there is little research on the re-\nlationship between social factors and coinfection with mul-\ntiple persistent infections in the United States. Therefore, the\npurpose of this study was to investigate whether education,\nincome, and race/ethnicity are related to infection burden in\na representative sample of U.S. adults. In addition, we at-\ntempt to improve upon earlier approaches to studying burden\nof infection by constructing a novel latent variable represent-\ning multiple persistent infections within individuals.\nMethods\nSample\nThe analyses used data from the National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES) III survey conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics between 1988 and\n1994. NHANES III was a cross-sectional, stratified, multi-\nstage probability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population aged 2 months to 90 years, with an oversam-\nple of Mexican American and non-Hispanic black respon-\nrepresentative estimates. Some variables were not collected\nduring both phases; specifically, H. pylori was only measured\nonly during phase I and dental pathogens only in phase II. Data\nwere collected in household interviews, clinical examinations,\nand laboratory tests. Details of the sampling design and proto-\ncol have been previously reported (28,29). We analyzed data\nfor non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nobservations on most demographic variables, including race/\nethnicity. Education and income variables were missing in 1%\nand 10% of cases, respectively.Among the infection variables,\nthe proportion missing ranged from 14% for CMV to 21% for\nH. pylori (out of phase I respondents). Respondents with miss-\ning information on any given pathogen were excluded from\nthe corresponding pathogen-specific analyses including the\ncount index models, but they were included in the multiple\nindicator multiple cause (MIMIC) models unless all four\npathogen data points were missing. Participants missing in-\nfection data tended to be older than those with valid data but\notherwise not systematically different in key sociodemo-\ngraphic variables.\nMeasures\nLaboratory assays.--NHANES III conducted the sero-\npositivity coding. The laboratory procedures, analytical\nmethods, and quality control are described in detail in the\nNHANES III laboratory manual (30). The cut points for se-\nropositivity to each infection are based on commercially\navailable immunoassay clinical diagnostics that provide in-\nformation on IgG antibody seropositivity (HSV, H. pylori,\nCMV) and the presence of HBV core antigen as described\nin the NHANES lab manuals (30). For P. gingivalis and\nA. actinomycetemcomitans, continuous IgG antibody mea-\nsured in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU)\nvalues were provided by NHANES for each of these patho-\ngens. We used the standard cutoffs for P. gingivalis\nBurden of infection.--Helicobacter pylori, CMV, HSV-1,\nand HBV were used for the infection burden analyses. Den-\ntal pathogens were not included because they were mea-\nsured only during phase II of the survey, whereas H. pylori\nwas measured only in phase I. Due to the lack of overlap,\nwe could only include one of these. We chose H. pylori be-\ncause the number of participants who had values for H. py-\nlori contemporaneous with other pathogens (HSV, CMV,\nHBV) was more than double compared with those with den-\ntal pathogen values measured at phase II. The burden vari-\nable was constructed in two ways: (a) using confirmatory\nfactor analysis incorporated into MIMIC models and (b) as\na count index (range 0\u00ad4) where we added the seropositive\nstatus for the four infections.\nSocioeconomic position.--Education was trichotomized:\nless than high school (<12 years), high school completion\n(reference), and more than high school (>12 years). Income\ncategories were based on poverty-income ratio, the ratio of\nthe family's income to the federal poverty line for a specific\nof the poverty threshold, with middle category as reference.\nDemographic variables.--Race/ethnicity was classified\nas non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nAmerican. We adjusted for age in years, gender, census re-\ngion, rural or urban residence, marital status, foreign born,\nand household size.\nStatistical Analysis\nFirst, prevalence of individual infections by race/ethnicity\nwas compared using chi-square tests. Second, associations\namong individual infections were measured using tetra-\nchoric correlations with pairwise deletion and exact two-\nsided significance tests.\nThird, infection burden was modeled using MIMIC models,\na special case of structural equation models (31), to capture\nthe underlying clustering of these infections within individu-\nals.The MIMIC model had two components: (a) measurement\npart, where a latent variable (infection burden), was modeled\nas influencing observed indicators (individual infections), and\n(b) structural part where the latent variable was a function of\nobserved predictors (SEP and race/ethnicity). The model is\nshown schematically in Figure 3. We used a weighted least\nsquares mean and variance-adjusted estimator, optimal for\ndata with missing values and ordinal dependent variables (27).\nThis estimator allowed using data from both phases of the sur-\nvey. The fit of the model to data was evaluated by comparative\nfit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA). These two measures indicate a satisfactory fit to\nthe data if their values are above .9 and below .05, respectively.\nResults from the structural component are presented as stan-\ndardized coefficients.\nFinally, we estimated ordered logit models to test the as-\nsociation of SEP and race/ethnicity with the count infection\nburden index. These models were estimated using only data\nfrom phase I of the survey because H. pylori was not mea-\nsured during phase II. The descriptive and multivariate anal-\nyses were adjusted for sampling weights and clustering.\nand Muth\u00e9n, Los Angeles, CA).\nResults\nDescriptivestatisticsarepresentedinTable1.Non-Hispanic\nwhite adults had a lower prevalence of each persistent infec-\ntion, as well as burden of infection, compared with non-\nHispanic black or Mexican American adults. Figure 1 shows\nthe age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of each infection by race/\nethnicity and education (patterns by income were similar--\nnot shown). Black and Mexican American adults and those\nwith less education evidenced higher infection prevalence.\nTable 1.

The strongest correlations were among H. pylori,\nCMV, and HSV-1, between .42 and .46. The associations\nbetween HBV, P. gingivalis, and A. actinomycetemcomitans\nwere weaker but significant for most pairs.\nFigure 2 shows the mean level of the count infection bur-\nden ranging from 0 to 4 across age, by race/ethnicity and\neducation (results by income were similar--not shown). In-\nfection burden increased monotonically with age. In all age\ngroups, the burden was higher for those with less education\nacross all race/ethnic groups, except for the crossover\namong elderly Mexican Americans.\nResults from the MIMIC models are summarized in\nTable 3. All three models had an acceptable fit to the data\n(CFI  .90 and RMSEA  .02). The measurement compo-\nnent indicated that the latent burden construct explained a\nsignificant proportion of variance in the observed infec-\ntions. The R2 values were between .33 and .58 for H. pylori,\nCMV, and HSV-1, and .14 to .15 for HBV. All uncon-\nstrained factor loadings were reasonably high and had\np values less than .01, suggesting a strong relationship with\nthe underlying burden variable. These results corroborated\nthe correlation findings and supported the conceptualiza-\ntion of infection burden as a valid latent construct.

Both SEP and race/\nethnicity were strongly associated with the count burden in-\ndex. Individuals with less than a high school education had\nroughly 50% higher odds of having an additional infection\ncompared with high school graduates, whereas those with\npostsecondary education had 50% lower odds. Income had\nsimilar effects, whereby low income was associated with\n33% higher odds of an additional infection, and high in-\ncome with 45% lower odds, compared with the middle-\nincome group. Education and income had independent\neffects on the infection burden (model 3). Net of socioeco-\nnomic position, Mexican Americans had three to four times\nthe odds of an additional infection, and non-Hispanic black\nadults had four to five times the odds, compared with non-\nHispanic white adults. Interactions of race/ethnicity and\nSEP were not statistically significant, suggesting that the ef-\nfect of SEP was similar within the three race/ethnic groups.\nDiscussion\nThis study identified socioeconomic and racial or ethnic\ndisparities in the burden of multiple persistent infections in\na nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. The indi-\nvidual infections are positively correlated with one another,\nsuggesting a nonrandom clustering of infections within in-\ndividuals. Moreover, this clustering is systematically asso-\nciated with socioeconomic characteristics.Adults with more\neducation and income have a lower burden of persistent\ninfections throughout adulthood, and non-Hispanic white\nadults have a lower burden than minority adults. These find-\nings suggest that the burden of persistent infection may be\none pathway through which lower socioeconomic position\n\"gets under the skin\" and leads to an earlier onset of disease\nand mortality.\nOur results are consistent with recent work from the UK\nthat found occupational grade associated with pathogen bur-\nden in 451 middle-aged adults, as measured by the summed\nserostatus of CMV, HSV-1 and Chlamydia pneumoniae (27).\nOur study adds to this earlier research by investigating a\nbroader set of infections thought to be associated with\nchronic disease, a wider age range, more flexible analytic\nmethods, and two measures of socioeconomic position in a\nlarge, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.\nThe results of this study suggest that race/ethnic differ-\nences in the burden of infection are not due solely to differ-\nences in income or education. One reason for the race/ethnic\ndifferentials may be transmission dynamics, whereby\ngroups that live and work together may retain their histori-\ncally high infection rates even as socioeconomic conditions\nchange. Foreign-born Mexican Americans have higher in-\nfection rates than native-born Mexican Americans, and\nthese higher rates may increase transmission within the\nMexican American community, compared with the\nnon-Hispanic white adults. Another potential explanation is\nthat even at a given level of education or income, racial and\nethnic minorities may be subject to increased social stress\n(32). This stress may downregulate immunity, making non-\nHispanic black adults and Mexican Americans more sus-\nceptible to infections (33). Although the current data do not\nallow investigation of these hypotheses, it is a promising\ndirection for future research.\nFigure 2. Mean infection burden (0\u00ad4) by Age, Race, and Education.

In the United States, those with\nmore education were found to have significantly lower lev-\nels of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein,\ninterleukin-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1.\nThe biologic inducers of inflammation, however, are rarely\nstudied. Little is known regarding the role of persistent in-\nfections as mediators of the relationship between SEP and\ninflammation. An important next step is to test whether\nclustering of persistent infections is a source of the increased\ninflammation levels found among low-SEP adults.\nBecause timing of exposure to each infection is not avail-\nable in the NHANES data set, it is not possible to distin-\nguish whether the observed SEP and race/ethnicity patterns\nare a result of differentials in initial exposure or heightened\nsusceptibility to infections, or an interaction of the two. Sec-\nond, it is likely that there are other pathogens that could be\nadded to our burden index, including those not measured in\nNHANES III and those yet to be discovered. Nevertheless,\npathogens included in this study have been implicated in\nchronic age-related diseases and therefore likely represent\nkey infections of interest for disease disparity research (6\u00ad\n9). In addition, it is not possible to distinguish whether the\nobserved age patterns for infection burden reflect age or co-\nhort effects in this cross-sectional study. However, the avail-\nability of a wide range of persistent infections in a very\nTable 3.

Future studies are\nneeded to study infection burden as a potential mediator of\nthe SEP-health gradient. Given the growing research impli-\ncating persistent infections in an array of chronic disease\nprocesses, reducing social disparities in the burden of infec-\ntion may be an important target for reducing health dispari-\nties and enhancing health of the population.\nCorrespondence\nAddress correspondence to Allison E.
