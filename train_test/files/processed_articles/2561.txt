Using data from the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent Health, we estimate an equilibrium matching model of high school\nrelationships. Variation in gender ratios is used to uncover male and female\npreferences. Estimates from the structural model match subjective responses on\nwhether sex would occur in one's ideal relationship. The estimates show that some\nwomen would ideally not have sex, but do so out of matching concerns; the re-\nverse is true for men. Counterfactual simulations show that the matching envi-\nronment black women face is the primary driver of the large differences in sexual\nactivity among white and black women.\nKeywords.
