The behavior of the speakers in the three domains (i.e., L1, L2, and pidgin/creole languages) goes hand in\nhand with norms of historical change. That is, the two diphthongs have historically developed from the monophthongs used\nas substitutes. In addition, the centrality component in these diphthongs is a marked parameter, which is yet to be set before\nthey could be mastered. The substitutes made by the speakers of Jamaican Creole and by Arab learners are the same chosen\nby the child.\n",

Brown, 1973). Another important aim of modern linguis-\ntic theory is to come up with language universals--the prin-\nciples according to which all human beings speak a language\n(see Greenberg, 1966).Although it is important in the linguis-\ntic behavior, the domain of phonology in second/foreign lan-\nguage learning and pidgin and creole languages has received\nlittle attention compared with the other aspects of language.\nYears of investigation have revealed that child language, sec-\nond/foreign language learning, and pidgin and creole lan-\nguages are, more or less, related in terms of processing. Many\nphenomena in these fields have been shown to be similar\nWashabaugh, 1977). Moreover, research on processes of pid-\nginization and creolization has led to important advances in a\nnumber of areas of applied linguistics and theoretical linguis-\ntics (cf. Holm, 2000). In this study, the strategies used by\nSaudi learners of English, particularly with regard to the\nacquisition of the closing diphthongs // and /e/ as in home\nand lane, respectively, are compared with the process of cre-\nolization of two speakers of Broad Jamaican Creole (JC;\nBailey, 1966). The similarities between the two creole\nspeakers and Saudi learners of English will be highlighted\ndrawing on the assumption that \"the dynamics by which pid-\ngins and creoles come into being and the development of the\nL2 learner's interlanguage might be governed by the same\nfactors\" (Cook, 1993, p. 69). In other words, in both situa-\ntions, the behavior of those concerned is constrained by the\nprinciples of Universal Grammar, a genetically determined\npre-disposition for language. Furthermore, it is also assumed\nthat foreign/second language learning and historical change\nare significantly linked, in such a way that accounting for\nthese learning situations without historical explanations may\nlack credibility. Thus, another aim of this study is to see to\nwhat extent the behavior of the speakers of the Broad JC and\nSaudi learners of English exhibits facts of historical change.\nLiterature Review\nAs an interesting and promising domain of linguistic\nresearch, the comparison of non-native language acquisition\n1King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding Author:\nAhmed Mousa, Assistant Professor in Applied Linguistics, Faculty of Arts\nand Humanities, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, P.O.

This is so because researchers have\ncome to realize that to understand the behavior of early and\nlate second/foreign language learning, an appreciation of the\nprocesses involved in pidginization/depidginization, cre-\nolization/decreolization is a key issue (McLaughlin, 1987).\nFor instance, Baxter, Lucchesi, and Guimaraes (1997), in\ntheir investigation of the Brazilian spoken dialect of Helvecia,\nobserved a series of parallels with structures in early stages\nof L1 Portuguese acquisition.\nIn a comparison between the decreolization of the\nGuyanese Creole negation system and the acquisition of\nEnglish negation by Spanish speakers, Schumann (1978)\nfound that the overall movement along the linguistic contin-\nuum in the two operations involved a rule change from a\nbasilect/basilang pre-verbal negation to the target English\npost-copula auxiliary negation. Furthermore, it was observed\nthat the above rule change in the situations was accomplished\nby identical linguistic processes--the replacement of surface\nforms and the restructuring of underlying units. Likewise, in\nthe depidginization of Hawaiian Pidgin English, as reported\nby Bickerton and Odo (1976), a continuum of development\noccurs, which is similar to that witnessed in decreolization\nand second language acquisition.\nPatrick-Andre (2006) has come to the conclusion that\nmany of the features found in Haitian French-lexifier creoles\ndo occur in L2 French and other interlanguages as a result of\nL1 transfer and other acquisition processes. The investiga-\ntion includes word order within the noun phrase, pronominal\nclitics, absence of copula, grammatical gender, and verb\nmovement. The major claim of the model of creole genesis\nadvocated in the study, which he calls gradualist/second lan-\nguage acquisition, is that creole genesis does not involve any\nspecific mental processes or strategies other than those\nattested in ordinary second language acquisition. In Lefebvre,\nWhite, and Jourdan (2003), a number of second language\nresearchers and creolists engage in dialogues that focus on\nthe processes characterizing various stages of L2 acquisition\nand creole genesis, such as relexification and transfer from\nL1 and their role in the initial state. The dialogues also cover\nmorphological, phonological, semantic, and syntactic prop-\nerties of interlanguage grammar and creole grammars. Their\nfindings lend support to the view that the same processes are\nfound to shape the initial stages of the two situations.\nThe reader is reminded that we are conducting a research\non the acquisition of two closing diphthongs, namely, //\nand /e/. Hence, it will be seen whether our findings corrobo-\nrate those of the aforementioned researchers. However, a\nbrief account of diphthongs is necessary. Diphthongs are\ndescribed as combinations of two vowel sounds within a\nsingle syllable. The production of a diphthong involves the\ngliding of the speech organs from a first vocalic element (i.e.,\nstarting point) to a second differently articulated element,\nwhich constitutes the target to which the transition is made\nfor the production of the word load, which contains the clos-\ning diphthong //, as illustrated in Figure 1, for instance, the\nvowel position for the beginning of this is the one for schwa\n//; the lips may be slightly rounded anticipating the glide\ntoward the second element //, for which there is quite\nnoticeable lip-rounding. Likewise, in the production of the\nclosing diphthong /e/ as in pain, the glide begins from\nslightly below the half-close front position, with the mid\nvowel /e/ and with spread lips as illustrated in Figure 1.\nThis gymnastics has proven to be problematic in L1 (Hua\n2004), African American Vernacular English (AAVE; Bailey\nmainly concerned with the acquisition of the above closing\ndiphthongs by Arab L1 learners of English and speakers of\nThe abovementioned continuum of development is also\nreflected on in this study as will be shown in the discussion.\nIn addition, an attempt will be made to explain why errors\ntake place in the acquisition of the two diphthongs under\nstudy, with reference to historical sound change. An effort\nwill be made to illustrate the learners' deviation from native\nspeakers' norms with respect to the pronunciation of these\ndiphthongs, using the framework of Dependency Phonology\n(Anderson & Ewen, 1987). However, before we go further,\nan account of diphthongs in Arabic and in JC is worth\noutlining.\nGenerally speaking, Hejazi Arabic (like standard Arabic\nand almost most varieties of Arabic) does not have diph-\nthongs, and the diphthong-like combinations [aw] and [aj]\nare realized as [o:] and [e:], respectively, as in (1):\n1. [yo:m] day, [o:m] swimming, [be:t] house and [de:n]\nWe can argue that [aw] and [aj] in Arabic are not diph-\nthongs, based on the fact that [w] and [j] have consonantal\nstatus, as in (2):\n2.[ajn] eye versus [ajjana] \"he allocated,\" [qaws]\nbaw versus [qawwasa] \"he bent,\" [bard], cold versus\n[barrada] \"he cooled,\" and [mil] salt versus\nFigure 1. Illustration of the glides involved in // and /e/.\nNotice that the glides [w] and [j] behave exactly like other\nconsonants in that they germinate in the causative case.\nContineau (in Alaoui, 1987) considers [w] and [j] in the pre-\nvious examples as positional variants of [u] and [i], respec-\ntively. A consequence of this view is to disregard the\nconsonantal function of [w] and [j]. That is, if we follow\nContineau, we should ignore the function of glides as fully\nfledged elements of root morphemes as in such words as\n[abja] white and [waqu:d] fuel. Equally, we will have to\nignore their function as constituents in the canonical struc-\nture of Standard Arabic, according to McCarthy (1981).\nAnother counter-argument is that /i/, j and /u/, w cannot be\nvariants of the same segment because they can occur side by\nside (Trubetzkoy, 1949). Furthermore, there are minimal\npairs that indicate that /i/, j and /u/, w are different pairs.\nConsider the examples in (3):\n3.[wafij] loyal [waafi:] exhausted\n[abij] \"he who does not\" [abi:] \"my father\"\n\"tolerate humiliation\"\nThe articulation of diphthongs, then, is clearly alien to\nArab learners. Although [aw] in [jawm] day and [aj] in [bajt]\nhouse may sound similar to house and fine in English, the\narticulation of these diphthongs in the two languages is dif-\nferent, as Mitchell and El-Hassan (1989) have shown. They\nargue that the second elements in these two diphthongs are\narticulated as if they were the consonantal [j] and [w], which\nare stronger and fuller in Arabic. In English, the second ele-\nments are, however, very short.\nAs for JC, it has four diphthongs: /ai/, /ou/, /ie/, and /\nuo/. The first two, according to Cassidy and Le Page (1980)\nand Devonish and Harry (2004) (cf. table2), would approx-\nimate the vowels in the pronunciation of such English\nwords as \"mice\" and \"cow,\" respectively. The second two\n(/uo/ and /ie/), according to Cassidy and Le Page (1980)\nand Devonish and Harry (2004), involve a combination of\nthe high vowel /i/ or /u/ with the mid vowel corresponding\nto its backness or frontness (i.e., /e/ and /o/). This is dis-\nplayed in the pronunciation of /kien/ \"cane\" and /guot/\n\"goat,\" respectively.\nAccording to Devonish (2006), the reversal witnessed in\nthe Received Pronunciation (RP) closing diphthong // \"is\nsystematic and is a generalization of a very limited variation\nin normal Jamaican speech between /uo/ and /ou/ in a small\nnumber of words all of which end in /l/\" (p. 78). Specifically,\n/uol/ \"old,\" /buol/ \"bowl,\" and /kuol/ \"cold\" have /oul/, /\nboul/, and /koul/, respectively, as alternative forms.\nJC has been affected by the tendency of the phonemic\nreduction that languages with Pidgin origins had gone\nthrough (cf. Hall, 1966). The above creole diphthongs ema-\nnated from several steps of this creole development that\naffected the vowel inventory of the language. Lalla (1983)\nreports that JC had gone through three stages of change,\nwhich are instigated by the processes of the creolization of\nthe former Pidgin language. The first two stages had culmi-\nnated in the reduction of the whole vocalic system. Thus,\nduring the first stage of development, the language lost\nvowel length distinction. The second stage witnessed the\nmerging of vowels, which led to the reduction of quality\ndistinction. This is clearly noticed in that \"the distinction in\nquality between, say close and mid-close front vowel /i, /\nor close and mid-close back /u, / are not usually preserved\"\n(N\u00fdvlt, 2012, p. 29). In fact, the first element in each of the\nJamaican diphthongs is indicative of this lack of\ndistinction.\nUniversalists argue that vowels that are less common in\nthe world languages, including centralized //, //, and //,\nare generally absent in creoles (Beckford-Wassink, 1999).\nHall (1966) also suggests that less common front and back\nrounded vowels, such as /y/ and /oe/, tend to lose their front-\nness or roundness in French-based creoles. Thus, /y/ is\nreplaced by the more common/i/ or /u/ and /oe/ by the more\ncommon /e/ or /o/ in words of French origin. We take that as\nindication of the adoption of more universal vowels. One can\nsee that the above Jamaican diphthongs are clearly an illus-\ntration of this fact.\nThe third and last stage of development resulted in length-\nening and diphthongization of certain vowel phonemes of\ncreole. By way of illustration, the mid-close front /e/ and the\nmid-close back/o/ were prolonged to become /e:/ and /o:/,\nrespectively, and eventually developed the on-glides /ie/ and\npresents a list of lexical items from JC, together with the way\nthey are pronounced in RP, in which one can notice that\nJamaican speakers do not really abide by vowel quality dis-\ntinction. Table 2 illustrates two examples, one for the RP /e/\nand the other for //, and how they are realized in JC.\nAlthough some linguists argue that the diphthongs con-\ncerned are in fact monophthongs, which may have diphthon-\nclassify them with diphthongs (Alleyne, 1980; Cassidy & Le\nTable 1.

According to the researcher, \"the downgliding\ndiphthong [i.e., /ie/] displays rather slight movement down\nthe peripheral track of the left system boundary combined\nwith movement toward the centre of acoustic space.\nMonophthongal [e:] shows little movement in either F1 or\nAs for /uo/, Beckford-Wassink takes it to be\ntypically a centring or downgliding diphthong which shows a\nrise in F2 on the order of 100 Hz or more lowering in vowel\nheight accompanied by a rise in F2. The monophthongal variant\n/o:/ typically exhibits very little change in F1. (p. 157)\nInformants\nThis section details the informants who formed the sources\nof the data of this study.\nJamaican Informants\nThe informants are two speakers of what is called the Broad\nJC (Bailey, 1966) of nearly the same age. The first one, Mr.\nMike (the barber henceforth), is from Hanover in the west of\nJamaica. He migrated to Britain when he was 18 years old.\nToday, he is 61 years old. He is a barber in Moss Side,\nManchester, England. Most of his customers are West Indian,\nold and young. He uses the same language (Broad JC) at\nwork, home, and everywhere. He is always in touch with the\nWest Indian people. He has little education. He left school\nbefore the age of 18, and his reading and writing are not\nperfect.\nThe second informant, Mr. Norman (the driver hence-\nforth), is from St. Mary in the north of Jamaica. He migrated\nto Britain when he was 17. Today, he is 59 years old. He\nworked in two factories in Manchester, as a dry cleaner, and\nas a carpet fitter before he became a taxi driver, which is his\npresent job. He also studied for a while in Jamaica and took\na course in reading and writing in Manchester. This means\nthat he dealt, and is still dealing with, different people.\nAccordingly, his language is expected to be influenced more\nthan that of the first informant.\nSaudi Learners of English\nThe second category of participants in this study includes\n60 native speakers of Hejazi Urban Dialect (HUD), a vari-\nety of Arabic spoken in the urban areas of the Western\nProvince of Saudi Arabia, mainly Makkah, Madinah, and\nJeddah. They were divided into three groups, 20 in each.\nNone of them had lived in an English-speaking country\nbefore the time of study. The first group consisted of pupils\nat the third year of intermediate school. Their age ranged\nfrom 14 to 16 years. They had been studying English for 3\nyears, 4 hr a week. The second group was pupils of the third\nyear at secondary school. They were between 17 and 18\nyears of age. They had been exposed to English for 6 years\nat a frequency of 4 hr a week. The third group was univer-\nsity undergraduate students (third-year level). They studied\ndifferent subjects. They had been studying English for 9\nacademic years.\nData Collection\nRegarding Jamaican English, data were gathered in three\nways. The author once lived with his Jamaican informants\nfor 1 year and therefore was able to observe a great deal of\nthe properties of their speech. Second, he recorded their\ncasual speech with their permission. Third, in the process, he\ngave them separately a list of words and sentences carrying\nthe diphthongs under study to read. However, one fact is\nworth mentioning. Actually, it was not the intention of the\nauthor to use the Jamaican data for research. Rather, it was\nthe author's first time to hear this mode of speech as he was\nused to hearing American and British English only until he\naccidentally came across this variety. After he had left them\nback home and started teaching English, he discovered that\nhis Arab learners pronounced the above two diphthongs in\nthe same way as the two Jamaican informants. It was this\nsimilarity of behavior that instigated the present study. This\nis why we do not have a unified methodology, as the pur-\nposes of data collection in the two groups are different. Thus,\nwhen the author decided to collect data for the purpose of\nresearch, the task was more organized, and the data were\nenormous compared with the data from the Jamaican speak-\ners who were no longer in contact with the author. It is hoped\nthat the bulk of research on creole languages, the least of\nwhich are cited in this investigation, will consolidate our\narguments and make up for the paucity of data with regard to\nthe Jamaican informants. It should be mentioned that the JC\ntranscriptions in this study are based on Cassidy (1961) and\nCassidy and Le Page (1967), and the RP counterparts on\nAs for the Arab learners of English, data elicitation\ninvolved an experiment with three phases: recognition task,\nproduction task, and description of pictures. In the produc-\ntion task, a list containing 1,012 words (containing monoph-\nthongs and diphthongs) in isolation and in carrier sentences\nwas prepared and given to the learners to read. They were\ninstructed to read silently the words and sentences in ques-\ntion twice before actually reading them out. Their utterances\nwere recorded in a sound-treated room in the language labo-\nratory at the English Language Center, King Abdulaziz\nUniversity, Jeddah. Recordings of individual participants\nwere done on separate tapes. Recognition task involved two\nphases. In the first phase, a list of 172 word pairs containing\nminimal pairs and pairs of similar words were recorded by a\nnative speaker of English who worked as a professional lan-\nguage instructor. Learners had to listen to the pairs and judge\nwhether the relevant pairs consisted of similar or different\nwords. In the second phase, a list of 100 word sets, each of\nwhich contained 3 phonetically similar words, was prepared\nand recorded on a tape by a professional native speaker. The\nlist was handed out to the learners to read silently. They were\nthen instructed to listen to each set and identify the word read\nout from each group after a short interval between the sets\nand the word to identify. The learners were then presented\nwith 104 pictures and instructed to name objects and describe\nentities or sequences (events). Their utterances were recorded\nin a sound-treated room.\nTranscribing and codifying data were done by the\nresearcher himself, then checked by trained transcribers and\na phonologist at the University of Bangor, North Wales. Data\nwere coded manually to identify the diphthongs involved.\nFor reference regarding Jamaican talk of the participants,\nand Holm (2000) were consulted. As for the Arabic speakers,\nthe author referred to Basalamah (1990) and to his intuition\nas a native speaker of the dialect spoken by the Arab partici-\npants. Data were analyzed with reference to the dependency\nResults\nAlmost all participants (when speaking casually, in their\nattempt to pronounce the test words and when describing the\npictures in the case of Saudi learners) have persistently pro-\nduced /o:/ for // and /e:/ for /e/, as indicated in Tables 3\nand 4, respectively. For instance, the Saudi learners fail to\ncome up with the closing diphthong // necessary for the\nproduction of such words as home, hope, coat, rope, and so\non. Instead, they opt for the monophthong /o:/, thus behaving\nin accordance with their tendency in the production of diph-\nthong-like combination [aw] in Arabic, as mentioned\nearlier.\nThe learners also treat words such as rain, lane, train, and\nso on, which are pronounced with the diphthong /e/, in the\nsame way Arabic-speaking people treat the diphthong-like\ncombination in [aj]. That is, they produce the monophthong\n/e:/. Table 3 displays a sample of Saudi learners' pronuncia-\ntion of these English diphthongs. Thus, one would have the\nimpression of initially ascribing our learners' error in the\npronunciation of these two diphthongs to transfer from L1.\nTable 4, which contains examples of the Jamaican infor-\nmants' pronunciation of the same diphthongs, suggests that\ndespite the fact that /uo/ and /ie/ are expected to be used by\nthe two speakers as potential substitutes for the diphthongs in\nquestion (thus complying with the norm of the Broad JC), the\nspeakers opt for the same substitutes witnessed in the speech\nof Saudi learners, /o:/ and /e:/. The use of these two vowels\nby the informants may indicate that /uo/ and /ie/ are marked,\nas they require on-glides in their combination. The reader\nwill remember that these Broad JC's diphthongs are reported\nto have emerged from /o:/ and /e:/, respectively. Thus, it will\nbe significant if speakers from different linguistic back-\ngrounds and learning situations opt for the same sound sub-\nstitution. In what follows, an attempt will be made to find out\nwhether this is a uniform practice in the acquisition of the\nabove closing diphthongs.\nTable 3.

In what follows, an account of their\nbehavior is outlined.\nAlthough the Broad JC does have the back, mid-rounded\nopening diphthong /uo/ as a recent on-glide development of the\nstereotype /o:/ (Alleyne, 1980), which is pronounced in such\nwords as show, nose, boat, and so on, our informants pro-\nnounced coat, road, woe, going, and open with the latter, that is,\nwith the monophthong /o:/. An instant interpretation one can\ngive here is that our informants do not show any sign of moving\ntoward the RP norm.2 However, the use of a long vowel does, at\nleast, reflect the informants' awareness that the vowel in ques-\ntion is not simple; that is, they seem to have realized that they\nare dealing with a complex vowel. However, instead of coming\nup with the glide associated with the production of a diphthong,\nthey chose to lengthen the equivalent of the second element of\nthe diphthong concerned. In other words, this diphthong con-\nsists of two centralized vowels, a schwa // and a mid high cen-\ntralized //, and both seem to be lacking from the vocalic system\nof JC, as the predominating vowel pattern in West African lan-\nguages (which is expected to have constituted the original vowel\nsystems of the Atlantic Creoles [Holm, 2000]) does not contain\nthem. As we will explain later, the first element does not have\nany locational information. The second element, //, contains a\ncentrality component dependent on a high-rounded articulatory\nconfiguration. An explanation of why our informants chose to\nproduce the cardinal vowel /o:/ as a realization of this diphthong\nwill be given, using the principles of Dependency Phonology\nAccording to Chomsky and Halle (1968) in the standard\nmodel, a feature can either be present or absent in a feature\nmatrix describing a particular segment. That is, for each feature\nused, either (+) or (-) is assigned to it. Chomsky and Halle\n(1968) claim that the use of binary features is \"the natural way\nof indicating whether or not an item belongs to a particular cat-\negory\" (p. 297). At least two deficiencies could be detected in\nthis approach (i.e., mode of notation). On one hand, these fea-\ntures, which describe a vowel, are unordered. This indicates\nthat there is no structural relationship among them. Therefore,\nby using this mode of representation, we cannot express hierar-\nchical intrasegmental relationships that we have isolated to\naccount for our learners'and informants'behavior. On the other\nhand, if the feature matrix contains only the minus values, then\none would have the impression that either there is no phonetic\ncontent or calculate the symmetries that result from the use of\nthe plus value for the same features. Take, for example, the rep-\nresentation of [e] and [] in the standard model:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 high\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 low\nThis representation makes use of the height and lowness\nparameters, but these articulations cannot be read off directly\nfrom the representation itself. And it does not matter whether\nyou start with low or high, because no structural (hierarchi-\ncal) relationship between the features is assumed. The depen-\ndency notations, however, make use of the unary features\nwith structural relations rendering the phonetic content of the\nsegment in question, as will be seen later.\nThe same failure in the production of the relevant glide in\nthe pronunciation of the front, mid, unrounded closing diph-\nthong /e/ persists. Thus, the words lay, face, razor, and so\non are pronounced with the monophthong /e:/ by our infor-\nmants. In fact, with the exception of /a/, /a/, and //, diph-\nthongs in RP are realized as long vowels both in the speech\nof our Jamaican informants and Saudi learners. In the latter's\nspeech, words such as home, hope, both, coat, and so on\nwere all produced with the monophthong /o:/, whereas words\nsuch as rain, stain, state, train, safe, and so on were articu-\nlated with the monophthong /e:/. Perhaps it is helpful to men-\ntion that the elements of the diphthongs /e/, //, //, //,\nand /e/ are marked for these two groups. Our Arab learners\ndo not have centralized vowels or the mid high vowel in their\nvocalic system; therefore, almost all English words bearing\nthese vowels were pronounced with the nearest vowels in\ntheir phonemic inventory (cf. Mousa, 1994). Likewise, JC\ndoes not have centralized vowels, and although /e/ is part of\nits phonological system, its existence in the diphthongs /e/\nand /e/ does not seem to be helpful (cf. Table 4). In what\nfollows, the errors in the pronunciation of // and /e/ are\nillustrated using Dependency Phonology as a mode of repre-\nRP // is characterized by the fact that there is little--if\nany--tongue gesture during the production of this complex\nsegment (cf. Alaoui, 1987). This is because the schwa, the\nfirst element, is a central (neutral) configuration. The second\nelement involves the same process with little increase of lip-\nrounding as the diphthong is articulated. That is, there seems\nto be no difference of tongue position between the elements\n// and //. Because centrality as a component is not available\nin the vowel space of Hejazi Arabic (cf. Basalamah, 1990;\ndiphthong would pose a problem to our learners and that its\nlearning would take place late. Indeed, this diphthong was\npronounced as [o:] at a high error percentage (cf. Mousa,\n1994). By the same token, we can argue that this diphthong\nwill not be an easy target for speakers of JC whose vocalic\nsystem lacks the two elements that constitute it. Let us again\nconsider the phonetic content of the segment produced (i.e.,\n[o:]), to be able to compare it with //, the target. By so\ndoing, we would like to hypothesize about the strategy that\nour informants as well as our Arab learners seem to have\nresorted to, being informed by their phonological system and\ninterphonological grammar, respectively. Consider the repre-\nsentation in Figure 2.\nNotice that the element to the left of /v/ does not have any\nlocational information. The second element contains a cen-\ntrality component dependent on a high-rounded articulatory\nconfiguration. As mentioned earlier, both gestures do not\noccupy a point in the vowel space of the two groups (i.e., the\nJamaican informants and Arab learners).\nFollowing Eckman (1977), we expect our Jamaican infor-\nmants and Arab learners to replace this vowel and complex\nsegment with the closest less marked segment in their vocalic\nsystems. Thus, because the first element (i.e., the schwa) is a\nweak vowel, the substitution would be based on the second\nelement, which is a mid-high centralized rounded vowel\n(i.e., //). To keep the mid position of this diphthong, the\ncentrality component has been removed and replaced by a\nlowness component /a/, which is dependent on /u/ to yield\n//, and once this is done, we assume that the phonetic articu-\nlatory content of this vowel is mapped onto the articulatory\ncontent of the schwa. This operation would yield the vowel\n/o:/. The dependency notations in Figure 3 illustrate these\nsubstitutions.\nIt is noteworthy that a model of phonological description\nsuch as the one with the dependency notations in Figure 3,\nwhich allows componentiality, would allow the second lan-\nguage researcher or the creolist in the area of phonology to\nrelate the speaker's pronunciation in these two situations to\ngeneral principles that constitute the principles of the model\nused. For instance, the descriptions and explanations avail-\nable through standard handbooks such as Mitchell and\nEl-Hassan (1989) handle the well-known phonological phe-\nnomena in the pronunciation of Arab learners of English.\nThey outline the phonetic features of language in the native\nlanguage, comparing them with the characteristics of those\nof the target language, and then hypothesizing about predic-\ntions in the behavior of speakers. One consequence of this\npractice is that one would have the impression that the mis-\npronunciations of vowels are unrelated phenomena, in spite\nof the fact that obvious similarities in alternations in the\nstructural change of the target vowels follow from the same\nprinciple. In other words, if we go about enumerating mis-\npronunciations and assigning different descriptive labels to\nthem, we would give the impression that we are dealing with\nunrelated instantiations of behavior in pronunciation. When\nwe give a different name to a process, we tend to talk of this\nprocess as a phenomenon different from the others. We wish\nto argue that if we set off analyzing our learners' interlan-\nguage and our Jamaicans' speech in terms of the acquisition\nof parameters (in the descriptive sense), then we can easily\nrelate what would seem unrelated processes, and we would\nthereby capture the phonologically significant generaliza-\ntions about our learners' interphonological grammar and the\nphonology of the JC. To the extent that this line of argument\nis valid, we consider the lack of the centrality parameter in\nour learners' vowel space and perhaps that of the JC as the\nvariable from which the mispronunciation of the above diph-\nthongs emanates. The second principle that seems to explain\nthe mispronunciation of diphthongs is the process whereby\nthe schwa, which lacks locational information, is filled with\nthe articulatory content of the neighboring vowel together\nwith which it constitutes a diphthong. This insight is\nexpressed with a copy rule, which has been postulated above\nand which will be repeated in Figure 4.\nThis rule reads as follows: Fill the articulatory gesture of\na vowel that lacks it with the locational information of the\nFigure 2. Representation of element dependency.\nFigure 3. Display of substitutions based on dependency.\nFigure 4. Copy rule.\n8 SAGE Open\nvowel immediately preceding and following it, where  is a\nvariable ranging over loci. From this discussion of the behav-\nior of our Arab learners and our Jamaican informants as far\nas the vowel space is concerned, it emerges that only two\nprinciples can explain the fact that the above diphthongs and\ncentral vowels have not been acquired fully yet. These two\nprinciples are the centrality parameter and the copy rule.\nConcerning the alternations /e/ ~ /e:/, the first element in\nthis diphthong is, more or less, the mid high vowel /e/, such\nas the one in men, followed by a short transition into the\ndirection of the centralized vowel //. If this movement is\ncoupled with a slightly more open quality for the first ele-\nment, then the already lax vowel // is weakened. And\nbecause our learners, and perhaps our informants, cannot be\ninformed by their linguistic backgrounds to retrieve this\ndiphthong, and once the first element is tense, the // becomes\nvery likely to take on the articulatory content of the preced-\ning vowel. One can claim that the laxness in // is perceived\nas a schwa by our learners and Jamaican informants.\nEvidence for this claim can be drawn from our learners' and\ninformants' pronunciation of the words bear, pear, share,\nhair and where, prepare, and wear, respectively, in that all\nthese words are pronounced with [e:] (cf. tables 3 and 4).\nOn universal grounds, Wode (1980) notes that the open\nrising diphthongs (/a/, /a/) and the falling (//) would\nvery unlikely be replaced by L1 forms in an L2 learning situ-\nation. Furthermore, Wode (1980) has found that L2 English\ndiphthongs /e/ and // are regularly replaced by the\nmonophthongs /e/ and /o/, respectively, by speakers with dif-\nferent L1 backgrounds. Wode's observation is based on\ninvestigation of data provided by native speakers of Hindi,\n(1989) takes this fact to be due to universal typological con-\nstraints to the effect that if a language contains closing diph-\nthongs, the least marked and possibly the easiest to pronounce\nforms will be those that are maximally open to close in their\narticulation.\nOurArab learners'and Jamaican informants'performance\nwith respect to the diphthongs /a/, /a/, and // lends sup-\nport to James'assumption in that these three diphthongs have\nnot been found to pose learning problems for them. Support\nfor universal tendency of the monophthongization of these\ntwo diphthongs comes from Hyman (1975). According to\nHyman,\nPhonological rules can coalesce segments. In many languages /\na/ and /a/ are realized respectively as /e/ (or[]) and [o] or [].\nIn such cases the phonetic output is in a sense a \"blend\" of the\ntwo segments in the phonological input: the lowness of /a/\ncombined with the close tongue position of /i/ and /u/ results in\nthe mid vowels [e] and [o]. (p. 14)\nOur learners and Jamaican informants have produced the\nlong vowels (i.e., /e:/ and /o:/) because of the following con-\nsiderations. The test words we used in the experiments are\nalmost all monosyllabic, and the lengthening they produced\ncan be due either to the fact that a short vowel cannot stand\nas a nucleus of a monosyllabic word with simple coda, or\nthat this behavior has been instigated by the postulation that\nthese diphthongs are universally more marked or less easy to\npronounce. Another obstacle for the learning of /e/ (espe-\ncially in the case of ourArab learners) is that the first element\nin the diphthong /e/ has not yet been acquired fully by our\nlearners (cf. Mousa, 1994). This implies that the acquisition\nof diphthongs would have as a prerequisite the acquisition of\nelements constituting those diphthongs. We can hypothesize\nthat at this stage, the only feature that has been acquired by\nthe two groups (i.e., Arab learners and Jamaican informants)\nconcerning the diphthongs // and /e/ is duration. And the\nonly diphthongs produced relatively correctly do not involve\nthe centrality component.\nWe also take it that the centrality component is a marked\nparameter in the vowel space, compared with the lowness\nand height parameters. To the extent that this stipulation is\ncorrect, one would expect the centrality parameter to be set at\na stage succeeding the setting of the lowness and height\nparameters. Indeed, English centering diphthongs are\nacquired by Arabs at the final stage (Stage VII) in Mousa's\n(1994) study, due to their difficulty. Following Eckman\n(1977), we take it that typological markedness is a valid tech-\nnique for measuring the degree of difficulty in acquiring a\nsecond language, L1, and perhaps in the explanation of\nbehavior of pidgin and creole speakers because of the fol-\nlowing considerations. Language universals are a reflection\nof the structure of the human mind (Lenneberg, 1967).\nFurthermore, it is assumed that human beings normally learn\nto do things that are less complex before they learn to do\nthings that are more complex, but never the other way around\nMonophthongization of English diphthongs seems to be\nresorted to for two different purposes. That is, speakers of\nAAVE and the more general dialect of the Southern United\nAtlantic creoles, as indicated by Schneider (1989), seem to\npronounce such words as pride, proud, and oil without or\nwith a reduced glide as a sign of identity preserving. \"It is\npossible that there is a kind of historical connection between\nthis and the parallel reduction of diphthongs in some Atlantic\nphonetician in the Department of Language and Linguistics,\nUniversity College of North Wales at Bangor, noticed that\nour Jamaican informants produced the words name and way\nwithout any glide (i.e., with the monophthong [e:]), and the\nword house with a diphthong that was not fully rounded (i.e.,\nwith [`]). However, off-gliding in the pronunciation of\nEnglish diphthongs by L2 learners is mainly resorted to due\nto their markedness. For instance, in the pronunciation of /\n/, L2 learners seem to be unaware of the fact that the dif-\nference between the two elements of the diphthongs is insig-\nnificant, although the second element is produced with little\nincrease of lip protrusion. What they seem to be doing is start\nthe glide with a truly back vowel (Gimson, 1980), as men-\ntioned earlier. Once the schwa is absent from the vocalic sys-\ntem of our learners, its position is filled with articulatory\nfunction of the back vowel, which has been substituted for\nthe second element of //, hence conveying [o:]. In other\nwords, the use of [o:] \"shows the horizontal feature specifi-\ncation [back], as opposed to the TL specification of the initial\n(2004) reports the following Diphthong Reduction Rule in\nthe interlanguage phonology of the speakers of Hong Kong\nEnglish:\nRule 1: VVV/-- / [+ stop (+back) or + nasal].\nAccording to this rule, a diphthong is reduced to a monoph-\nthong when followed by a velar stop or a nasal, as displayed\nin the following Hong Kong English examples:\nlake  [lk]\ntake  [tk]\njoke  [k]\nsoak  [sk]\npain  [p]\nrain  [r]\nloan  [l]\nbone  [b].\nOther examples of monophthongization are also mani-\nfested by Randell (2004), regarding Finglish3 speakers. The\nwords stove, grocery, and birthday are pronounced as touvi,\nrosseri, and p\u00f6rtteri, respectively. Notice that there is no\nindication of a glide, whatsoever. Thus, so far, creole speak-\ners, speakers of AAVE, and English L2 learners are all con-\nsistent with the above monophthongization of English\ndiphthongs. In what follows, an account of the child's behav-\nior in this connection is given, thus echoing Ervin-Tripp\n(1974) and others'inquiry whether second language learning\nis like L1.\nThe same phenomenon of monophthongization of diph-\nthongs has been found to shape child language in general.\nChildren from different linguistic backgrounds tend to sim-\nplify diphthongs by reducing them into a simple vowel.\nAccording to Hua and Dodd (2000), who investigated the\nacquisition of Modern Standard Chinese, the vowel retained\nwas normally the louder and more sonorant vowel of the\ndiphthong. Thus, the children tended to produce the second\nelement of on-gliding diphthongs, for example, /ua/ as //,\nbut the first element of off-gliding diphthongs, for example,\n/ao/ was produced as [a]. They also came to the conclusion\nthat whereas simple vowels emerged early in development,\ntriphthongs and diphthongs were prone to systematic errors.\nIn acquiring Brazilian Portuguese, according to Santos\n(2007), children apply elision where adults apply diphthon-\ngization. Consider table 5 which illustrates examples from\nNotice that the child's productions do not contain glides\n(cf. table 5). In other words, what is pronounced as a diph-\nthong by adults is realized as a monophthong by children.\nSantos refers this to the fact that children use elision instead\nof diphthongization before they acquire the syllable structure\nCCV, which allows parsing of raising diphthongs such as\nthose in the examples above. Moreover, the examples above\npoint to the fact that these children have not yet mastered the\nacquisition of Sandhi processing, which Santos thinks needs\nMonophthongization of diphthongs appears to shape the\nearly stages of child phonology in many investigations, and\nthe diphthongs //and /e/ have been reported to be among\nthe most problematic diphthongs in both L1 and L2 learning.\nTable 5 provides a brief illustration of child's substitutions\nfor diphthongs is given.\nNotice that all the child's renditions of the English diph-\nthongs displayed in Table 6--except the last three--are\nmonophthongs. This monophthongization seems to be a pop-\nular strategy in dealing with diphthongs, especially those that\ncontain problematic elements. For instance, in the acquisition\nof Finnish vowel harmony (FVH), Leiwo, Kulju, and Moyama\n(2006) report that all the productions of children of 2.6 years,\nTable 5.

Consequently, these\ndiphthongs have always been replaced by back monoph-\nthongs. Likewise, some vowels appear later than others in\nEnglish L1 learning. According to Bernhardt and Stemberger\n(1998), among English vowels, the basic triangle (/i/, /a/, and\n/u/) is mastered first, followed by back and central vowels.\nThey add that the front non-low vowels (i.e., /e/, //, //) and\nr-colored vowels (//, //) are reported to be the last vowels to\nbe acquired by an English-speaking child. Thus, the child's\nrenditions of English diphthongs as monophthongs (cf. Table\n6) can be explained in terms of the markedness of their ele-\nments. In other words, the English diphthongs /e/ and //\nconsist of sounds that are acquired late in child language. The\nFinnish children's behavior with respect to the pronunciation\nof these two diphthongs lends support to Zajdo's (2002) find-\nings that Hungarian speaking children have problems with\nfront rounded vowels at ages 2.0 and 2.6.\nFurther struggle with diphthongs containing the centrality\nparameter is reported by Kehoe and Lleo (2003). With refer-\nence to Kehoe and Lleo (2003), at Stage I, when he was\n7 months, and 1 day old), Thomas--who was learning\nGerman--produced heij /has/ as [has] (meaning hot) and\nmoin /mn/ as [mn] (meaning good morning). The analy-\nsis of diphthongs produced by Thomas at Time Periods II\nand III indicated that diphthongs were produced more accu-\nrately than even long vowels. This may be taken as a cor-\nroboration of Olmsted's (1971) survey. The survey suggests\nthat full mastery of vowels--including diphthongs--will not\nbe achieved until the age of 4.\nHowever, the above substitutions of diphthongs with\nlong vowels do not downplay the fact that children are capa-\nble of producing complex vowels that are sometimes taken\nto approximate the adult targets. For instance, in addition to\ntarget-like productions ([pt\u00e6] and [pyr\u00e6]), children's\nproductions with FVH only in Leiwo et al.'s (2006) total\ndata included forms such as [p\u00e6ij\u00e6], [pip\u00e6], [p\u00e6t\u00e6], and\n[p:t\u00e6] for [p\u00f6yt\u00e4], and [p\u00f8:py], [py:py], [pij\u00e6], and\n[p:r\u00e6] for py\u00f6r\u00e4 (Leiwo et al., 2006). Notice that all these\nproductions contain diphthongs, though not the targets. This\nwould give the impression that diphthongs are acquired\ngradually. Further evidence for the gradual acquisition of\ndiphthongs comes from Garo and the English-speaking\nchild in Burling (1978) who has been reported to make the\nlast three substitutions in Table 6. That is, the two elements\nof the diphthong are pronounced but without the fusing of\nthe English nucleus whose second element is a centralized\nvowel. We take the child's response with two vowels instead\nof a monophthong as a sign of progress toward the target\ndiphthongs. We also suggest that diphthongs--including /\ne/ and //--will not be acquired authentically until their\nelements have been fully mastered. Bond, Petrosino, and\nDean (1982) traced child vowel development after the\nperiod of 17 to 29 months. They noticed a clear overlap\nbetween the vowels and imprecisely defined vowel space,\nwhich suggested inaccurate articulatory gestures during\nLinguistic Stages I and II. In other words, the vowels of\nthese early stages showed less definition in the F2 dimen-\nsion than later productions of the same vowel tokens. Their\nobservation revealed that the F1 range of early vowels was\nextensive and that later productions had considerably less\nvariability in the F1 plane. Consider Figure 5.\nNotice the clear overlap of the vowels displayed. Perhaps\nthis explains Fletcher's (1973) claim that the lips, tongue,\nand palate of the new born allow only gross phonation; 6 to\n8 more years of development are necessary for the develop-\nment of coordinated articulatory pattern. This is a clear indi-\ncation of physiological limitations in the child.\nAdults' failure to produce English diphthongs, which\ninvolve centrality parameter, can also be ascribed to the fact\nthat members of such diphthongs are yet to be produced\nauthentically. For instance, according to Bohn and Flege\nPortuguese produced an accented // in a word such as \"bet,\"\nthat was relatively higher in the acoustic vowel space and\nshort in duration. Germans also produced English /i/ and //\nhigher in the acoustic vowel space than speakers of English\nIn Bus\u00e0 (1992), native speakers of Italian have been\nreported to produce an undistinguished vowel for both /u/\nand // in food and foot, which is about as high as anAmerican\n/u/ as indicated by similar first formant frequency values,\nthough less centralized. It is more back and more rounded, as\ndisplayed by the low F2 values. Even in terms of perception,\nit is thought that acoustic vowel space indicators of tongue\nFigure 5. Vowel formants for Linguistic Stage 1.\nSource. From Bond, Petrosino, and Dean (1982).\nheight and advancement during vowel articulation are cru-\ncial for the identification of vowel (Fox, 1982). To explain\nhow such a link might manifest itself, Repp (in Fox, 1982)\nand Oden and Massaro (in Fox, 1982) refer to a prototype\nmodel of speech perception. In other words, the ideal inter-\nnalized perceptual prototype of a particular vowel, which is\ndefined in terms of features pertaining to important acoustic\ncues of the vowel in question, may be identical to the ideal-\nized acoustic/articulatory target at which a speaker aims dur-\ning the manipulation of that vowel. This might explain the\nbehavior of Saudi learners of English in Mousa (1994). The\nlearners produced the vowels /e/ as [i], // as [i], and // as\n[u]. The results of perception and production tests showed\nthat this was more or less exactly how they perceived these\nvowels. This reminds us of the phonological processes of the\ntensing of lax vowel and the merger of /// before nasals in\nAAVE. According to Bailey and Thomas (1998) and Labov\n(1972), among others, speakers of this variety of English\npronounce still, pig, pen, and again, as [stil], [pig], [pn],\nand [gin], respectively. One should not be surprised to come\nacross this development. According to Hall (1966),\nIn the earlier stages of English-based pidgins, the distinction\nbetween tense and lax vowels often disappeared, and there was\nno longer a contrast between the /i/ vowel of English beat and\nthe // vowel of bit; between /u/ in fluke and // in book; between\n/e/ in bait and / / in bet; or between // as in coat and // as in\nThe above behavior on the part of adults is expected to\nhave been instigated by the influence of an earlier linguistic\nsystem (L1 in the case of Italian, German, and Arabic speak-\ners, and substrate systems in the case of African American\nspeakers).\nThis being the case, one would like to argue that once\nnon-native speakers of English find difficulty producing sin-\ngle vowels, especially centralized ones, then it would be\nmore difficult for them to produce diphthongs containing\nthem. Indeed, diphthongs involving centrality parameters are\nreported to be most problematic for learners from different\nlinguistic backgrounds (Wode, 1980). Moreover, the learn-\ning of these diphthongs is expected to take place in stages.\nConsider table 7 which illustrates the gradual acquisition of\nthe diphthong /e/ in against reported in Mousa (1994) and\nwhich is written in the form of phonological rules. All these\nstages were observed in the speech of Arab learners of\nEnglish.\nNotice that Rules 3, 4, and 5 as is the case in table 7 are\nintrinsically ordered: 3. e  e:, 4. e:  e, and 5. e  i.\nThus, before our learners manage to produce the target\ndiphthong, their productions manifest variation, which may\nindicate the developmental aspect of their learning. This\nwould make one conclude that in both L1 and L2, the acqui-\nsition of diphthongs, especially ones that involve centrality\nparameter, is accomplished gradually. As for our Jamaican\ninformants, we can also find evidence in favor of the gradual\nproduction of diphthongs. According to phonetician Frank\nGooding, one of our informants pronounced the words name\nand way with the vowel /e/, short of /e:/, which has been used\nabundantly by both informants for the diphthong /e/.\nGooding also suggests that in their pronunciation of the\nwords house and out, the first vowel of the diphthong is not\nfully rounded. He suggests that their pronunciation would\nbest be transcribed as [h`s] and [`t] rather than RP /has/\nand /at/. Also, in the pronunciation of weir and wear, our\ninformants manifested the following variation. Although\nthey both pronounced both diphthongs as [e:] most of the\ntime, they also pronounced both words with a vowel such as\nthat found in the French words \"soeur,\" sister, \"fleur,\" flower,\nand so on, that is, [oe]. In addition, the barber also pronounced\nwear as [wi:r] and prepare as [pripi:r]. Regarding the internal\nstructure of the diphthongs in question, we mentioned earlier\nthat centralized vowels are not part of Jamaican vocalic\ninventory. However, one might argue that the mid vowel /e/,\nwhich constitutes the first element in /e/ and /e/, is a legiti-\nmate vowel in JC; therefore, these diphthongs should be\neasier to pronounce by our informants. The answer is that\ntheir pronunciation of \"correct,\" \"television,\" \"seven,\" and\nso on as [korik], [tilivin], [sivin], respectively, suggests\nthat /e/ and /i/ are merged, perhaps indicating that their\nbehavior resembles that of speakers of AAVE.\nIn a similar vein, one can also assume that our Jamaicans'\npronunciation of the diphthongs /e/ and // is influenced\nby the AAVE. In this variety of English, the second element\nof the diphthong /a/ is deleted, and the first element is typi-\ncally lengthened. Thus, words such as pie, ride, and time are\npronounced as [p:], [r:d] and [t:m], respectively (Bailey\napplies to words such as toybox [tbaks] instead of /tbaks/,\noil [] instead of [l], and cowboy [kabo] instead of\nsuch as cake and coats are pronounced with monophthongs,\nfor example, [kek] and [kot], respectively (Bailey & Thomas,\n1998). They report that this last behavior is witnessed in\nGullah and Carribean creoles, and that in the 1800s, it\noccurred in AAVE.\nThe history of English has revealed that with the excep-\ntion of //, the RP diphthongs often derive from earlier pure\nvowels (Gimson, 1980). The most significant sound change\nTable 7.

What hap-\npened was that non-low long vowels raised one height and\nhigh vowels diphthongized, as illustrated by Figure 6.\nNotice that the diphthongs // and /e/ were once pro-\nnounced as [o:] and [e:], respectively. Another fact regarding\nthe development of diphthongs from single vowels comes\nfrom the Romance languages. It is common for stressed and\nunstressed syllables to behave differently with the evolve-\nment of language. For instance, in the Romance languages,\nthe Latin vowels /e/ and /o/ have generally diphthongized in\na stressed syllable. Because stress figures in verb conjuga-\ntion, this has resulted in verbs with vowel alternation in these\nlanguages. By way of illustration, the Spanish verb \"volver\"\n(to turn) has the form \"volvi\" in the past but \"vuelvo\" in the\npresent. In Italian, the same phenomenon is observed, but\nwith the vowel /o/ alternating with /uo/, instead. Nouns also\ndo bear this fact. For example, Spanish \"ventilaci\u00f3n\" (venti-\nlation) becomes \"viento\" (wind) from Latin \"ventum\"\n(Wikipedia). In fact, today, many varieties from RP in the\nLondon area and many other regions use pure long vowels\nvarying between cardinal [o:] and cardinal [] for //, and\ncardinal [e:] and cardinal [:] for /e/ (Gimson, 1980). One\nform of the development of these two diphthongs is that the\npure vowels [:] and [:] had probably reached a quality near\ncardinal [o:] and cardinal [e:] in the 16th and 17th centuries\n(cf. Gimson, 1980, for a fuller account). The above historical\nfacts about the diphthongs in question are crucial for explain-\ning the behavior of our Jamaican informants regarding the\nproduction of these sounds. That is, Holm (2000) was quite\nright to suggest that\nin any discussion of the development of European vowels into\ntheir corresponding forms in the creoles, it should be recalled\nthat the starting point was not necessarily the same as the modern\nvowel of the standard European language, but rather the\ncorresponding vowel of the speech of the 15th to 17th centuries\n(for Portuguese and Spanish) or 17th to 18th centuries (for\nFrench, Dutch, and English). (p. 146)\nThus, one can safely assume that Jamaican informants\nmight have retained the old pronunciation (or archaic usage)\nof these diphthongs, as this is a common practice among cre-\nole speakers, regarding different aspects of language. For\ninstance, speakers of English-based Atlantic creoles use from\nas a conjunction with the temporal meaning of since, for\nexample, \"From I was a child I do that,\" which is part of both\ncreolized French, chat /sat/ (earlier pronunciation) of cat is\nused instead of today's /sa/. A third example comes from\nAnnobonese creolized Portuguese. In this creole, the word\nfor doctor is \"bab\u00e9lu\" from Portuguese \"barbeiro\" (barber).\nThis is because, in the past, barbers bled their clients\n(patients) for treatment (cf. Holm, 2000).\nMonophthongization of European diphthongs seems to\nhave always been the trend in the early creoles. Holm (2000)\ncites the following examples from S\u00e1o Tom\u00e9 creolized\nPortuguese. In this creole, the Portuguese diphthongs /ai/ and\n/oi/ are pronounced as /a/ and /o/, as in \"basu,\" under, from\nPortuguese \"debaixo\" and \"dodo,\" crazy, from (doido),\nrespectively. Hall (1966) refers this monophthongization to\nthe influence of substratum languages on the phonetics of\nthese creoles. According to Hall, many languages--includ-\ning those of Africa, China, and Melenesia--do not diphthon-\ngize the vowels /i', e', , ,/ in such words as fear, go, bait,\nand so on. Thus, neo-Melanesian, neo-Solomonic, and other\nEnglish-based pidgins and creoles normally have non-diph-\nthongized vowels.\nAfter this detailed account on the production of diph-\nthongs, especially /e/ and //, in the contexts of L1, L2,\nAAVE, historical linguistics, and creole languages, one clear\npattern is observed. That is, speakers in all these contexts\n(including native speakers of English) indicate preference\nfor monophthongization. This is the case not only for those\nwhose languages do not have the diphthongs concerned but\nalso for adult native speakers. One explanation for this ten-\ndency of monophthongization is that monophthongs require\nless gymnastics to produce than diphthongs. In other words,\nalthough the vowel substitution patterns of diphthongs are\nmore or less similar to those of long monophthongs, and\nalthough both contain two timing units, diphthongs are more\ncomplex than long vowels. Put differently, diphthongs con-\ntain two separate root nodes, whereas long vowels contain\nonly one (Fikkert, 1994), as illustrated in Figure 7.\nNotice that the second node of the diphthong is a glide\nthat is necessary for the speech organ to combine the vocalic\nelements of the diphthong, and whose absence causes hin-\ndrance in the production of the diphthong. The glide will\nalso pave for the existence of the copy rule in Figures 3 and\n4. It seems that this gymnastics, which involves the joining\nof two vocalic elements, is not part of the vocalic system of\nthe speakers, so far. Thus, the natural consequence of this\nmarked gymnastics is to simplify the task by eliminating\nthe problematic gesture in the manipulation--the glide. Our\nview on the complexity of diphthongs has been supported\nby Stokes, Lau, and Ciocca (2000) regarding the production\nFigure 6. The Great Vowel Shift of Middle English.\nof diphthongs by Cantonese-speaking children with phono-\nlogical disorders. They propose that diphthong errors arise\nas a function of both ambient frequency and feature\ncomplexity.\nConclusion\nThe output of this investigation is that to explain why L2\nlearners behave in a certain way, it is wise to look at other\nmodes of language contact, such as creole languages.\nHowever, once the two fields (i.e., L2 and creole) involve\nlanguage in the making, in that they are linguistic systems\ncomprising finite numbers of grammatical rules (like any\nnatural language) capable of being internalized and used pro-\nductively by their speakers, it is inevitable to bring in the\ndomain of child language in which an attempt is made to\ndiscover the logical problem of language learning. Our\ninvestigation has shown that the learning of the diphthongs\nunder study is more or less accomplished in the same way in\nthe three domains. For instance, speakers in the three situa-\ntions are found to simplify the two diphthongs by reducing\nthem into a simple vowel, thus eliminating the glide that\nseems to be a problematic gesture in the manipulation of a\ndiphthong. In particular, the behaviour of the two groups\n(i.e.,Arab learners of English and speakers of JC) with regard\nto the acquisition of the two diphthongs in question corrobo-\nrates that of child language, which is taken to be \"external\nevidence\" in the sense of Singh (1988). The centrality param-\neter is found to be a marked feature in these diphthongs,\nwhich need to be mastered before their production is han-\ndled. Moreover, insights from historical linguistics suggest\nthat the strategies deployed by the child acquiring mother\ntongue, L2 learners, and creole speakers are not incompatible\nwith the norms displayed in the development of natural lan-\nfound a number of similarities between the historical change\nand the line of change in language acquisition. Dickenson\nthat \"the diachronic mechanism underlying historical change\nand those active in . . . language acquisition are not only\nclosely related but also organically united\" (p. 74). In a word,\nit seems that the same factors govern the acquisition of these\ntwo diphthongs in pidgin and creole languages, as well as in\nsecond language learning.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. Wells (1982) suggests that the opening diphthongs /ie/ and /uo/\ncan be applied in such words as \"face\" and \"goat,\" to function\nas social or allophoniac variants of the monophthongs.\n2. Alleyne (1980) assumes that the above on-glide development\nof this monophthong is a positive marker of decreolization.\n3.
