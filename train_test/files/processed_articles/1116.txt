This reference links childhood and adolescent BMI cen-\ntiles to the adult BMI cut point of 30 to determine obesity preva-\nlence at wave II.32 For the young adult population at wave III\n(aged 19-26 years), we consistently use the adult BMI cut point.\nMeasures have been described in detail elsewhere.33\nHealth Care\nThe following health care measures (waves I and III) are di-\nchotomous indicators reflecting lack of care: (1) whether the\nrespondent had current health insurance; (2) whether the re-\nspondent needed but did not receive medical care in the last\nyear; (3) whether the respondent needed but could not afford\ndental or medical care last year; (4) whether the respondent\nvisited a dentist in the last year; and (5) whether the respon-\ndent had a physical examination within 2 years.\nGeneral Health\nSelf-reported health is measured as a dichotomous indicator\nindicating fair or poor relative to good or excellent health.\nAsthma (parental report in wave I and self-reported asthma di-\nagnosis in wave III) is measured as a dichotomous indicator.\nSubstance Abuse\nAll measures of substance abuse are self-reported from waves\nI and II and reflect (1) smoking at least 1 whole cigarette daily\nduring the last 30 days; (2) any use of marijuana in the past 30\ndays; (3) any use of hard drugs such as cocaine, inhalants, or\ninjected or other illegal drugs in the past 30 days in wave I, and\nany use of cocaine, injected or other illegal drugs, or crystal\nmethamphetamine in wave III; and (4) binge drinking, de-\nfined as 5 or more drinks (ie, glass of wine, can of beer, wine\ncooler, shot glass of liquor, or mixed drink) on 1 occasion dur-\ning the past year.\nReproductive Health\nOur only measure of reproductive health is self-reported STD\ndiagnosis (chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immuno-\ndeficiency virus/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and tricho-\nmoniasis for both sexes, and bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis\nfor female subjects) at waves II and III.\nMental Health\nWe have the following 2 indicators of mental health at waves I\nand III: feelings of depression (feeling depressed a lot, most,\nor all of the time last week) and suicide ideation (the respon-\ndent has seriously thought about suicide in the past 12 months).\nViolence\nExposure to violence in the past year is measured across the\nfollowing items at waves I and III: (1) victim of violence who\nhas been shot, stabbed, beat up, jumped, or threatened with a\ngun or a knife, and (2) perpetrator of a violent act who has pulled\na knife or gun on someone or shot or stabbed someone.\nRace/Ethnicity\nFive race and ethnic groups were used based on self-identified\nrace and Hispanic origin at wave III. In the largest sample, tracked\nfrom waves I through III, the sample includes non-Hispanic\nWe selected a marginal (or \"population-average\") longitudi-\nnal regression model to estimate temporal change in each health\nindicator; the hypotheses under investigation were best an-\nswered by examining the average experience of each race/\nethnic group rather than by examining person-specific vari-\nables.

We hypothesized that (1)\neach race/ethnic group experienced no change in the health in-\ndicator over time, and (2) the rate of change in the health in-\ndicator for each nonwhite race/ethnic group was equal to the\nrate of change in the health indicator for the white group. To\ndetermine if the significant differences in the trend in health\nover time could be explained by socioeconomic status (SES),\nmedian tract income and maximum parental education were\nincluded in each of the final models, but had minimal influ-\nence on estimates of variables and made no difference in the\ntests of the hypotheses. Hence, we report results for the mod-\nels that omitted these 2 covariates.\nRESULTS\nAcross all sex and race/ethnic groups, there were signifi-\ncantincreasesinhealthriskandhealthdisparitiesfromado-\nlescence into young adulthood. There were statistically sig-\nnificant increases over time in the proportion who get no\nexercise or report asthma, significant declines in breakfast\nconsumption,andsignificantincreasesforalmosteverysex\nandrace/ethnicgroupintheproportionofrespondentswho\nwere obese, needed but could not afford medical care, used\ncigarettes and marijuana, had any STDs, or reported binge\ndrinking, all indicating increasing health risk during the\ntransition from adolescence to adulthood (Table 1). Re-\nductions in risk were found in the significant declines over\ntimeacrossalmostallsexandrace/ethnicgroupsinthepro-\nportion who perceived their health as poor to fair, had feel-\nings of depression or suicidal ideation, and were a victim\nof violence. All groups (except black and Native Ameri-\ncan male subjects) had significant declines in perpetrat-\ning violent acts.\nThe race/ethnic groups shift in their position as\noccupying the best or worst ranking across the various\nhealth indicators over time. No single race/ethnic group\nconsistently occupies the best or worst ranking. The\ntendency was for Asian and non-Hispanic white sub-\njects to generally rank best across time and across mul-\ntiple domains of health risk, whereas the other minority\ngroups ranked worst (Table 2 and Table 3). How-\never, white subjects lose their favored position more\noften than other groups as they age into adulthood.\nNative American subjects tended to appear in the worst\nrankings most often, followed by non-Hispanic black\nsubjects, with Hispanic subjects in the middle range\nacross most indicators.\nSelected illustrative results are presented in Figure 1\nand Figure 2 by category of health indicator. The full\nset of figures for male and female subjects in all 20 lead-\ning health indicators can be found at http://www.cpc.unc\n.edu/projects/addhealth/findings.\nThere was a significant increase in the proportion of over-\nweight/obese adolescents and those engaging in no weekly\nphysical activity (female subjects shown in Figure 1A and\nB). The trend lines fan out, indicating increasing disparity\nin young adulthood, highest among black vs white sub-\njects. The proportion of respondents with no health insur-\nancecoverageincreasedsignificantlyformostgroups(male\nsubjects shown in Figure 1C). The proportion with the last\nphysical examination more than 2 years ago (Figure 1D)\nalso increased significantly for most male subjects, with in-\ncreases for Hispanic and Native American subjects pro-\nportionately greater than those for white subjects.\nSelf-reports of poor health (male subjects in Figure 2A)\nand feelings of depression (female subjects in Figure 2B)\ndeclined significantly as adolescents aged into young\nadulthood, and race/ethnic disparities decreased as well.\nSmoking (Figure 2C) and binge drinking (Figure 2D) in-\ncreased significantly for all groups, with increasing dis-\nparity over time and greatest disadvantage among white\nsubjects. Diagnosis of STDs increased significantly in the\ntransition to adulthood for all groups, with increasing race/\nethnic disparity over time (Figure 2E). Violence de-\nclined significantly over time for all groups, with de-\ncreasing race/ethnic disparity (Figure 2F).\nThe overall patterns of health disparities include sig-\nnificantly different trends for black relative to white fe-\nmale subjects across almost all domains. Among male sub-\njects, the black-white disparity in trends is significant for\nmore than half of the indicators. For both sexes, the white-\nHispanic disparity in health trends is significant for 35%\nof the indicators. Patterns of change in health indicators\nare similar for white and Asian subjects, and greater among\nmale than female Native American compared with white\nsubjects.\nCOMMENT\nTo our knowledge, this research is the first to present lon-\ngitudinal, nationally representative data on race/ethnic\ndisparities in leading health indicators across the tran-\nsition to adulthood. The fact that we can follow up the\nsame individuals longitudinally to examine changes in\nthese health risk behaviors, specifically the placement of\nthese changes in the context of health disparities, is a ma-\njor contribution of this research.\nFor 15 of 20 indicators, health risk increased across\nall race/ethnic groups during the transition to adult-\nhood. Relative rankings on a diverse range of health in-\ndicators (and patterns of change over time) varied by sex\nand race/ethnicity, causing disparities to fluctuate over\ntime. Asian and white subjects generally scored highest\nacross the range of health indicators; Hispanic subjects\nscored within the moderate range; and Native American\nand non-Hispanic black subjects scored the lowest. Al-\nthough white subjects had more favorable health risk in\nadolescence, they experienced the greatest decline by\nyoung adulthood.\nFor most of the health indicators showing increased\nhealth risk over time, race/ethnic disparities in these in-\ndicators also increased. Although the disparities in-\ncreased, different race/ethnic groups occupied more and\nless favored positions over time, indicating that no single\ncommon approach to reduce disparities is possible given\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

Thus, factors beyond in-\ncome and education may play a role in the cause of these\nhealth trends. Furthermore, SES may be related to the\nstarting point on our health indicators in adolescence,\nbut not to the trends in these indicators over time. It is\nalso possible that we do not capture the complexity of\nthe SES-health relationship across the transition from\nadolescence to young adulthood. For example, as\nteens leave their parental homes, they are likely to lose\nhealth insurance coverage owing to aging out of Med-\nicaid coverage or leaving their parents' health insur-\nance coverage.\nThe top 3 leading actual causes of death in the year\ninactivity, and (3) alcohol consumption.10 We found dra-\nmatic increases in behaviors related to these 3 leading\ncauses of death. As adolescents become young adults, they\nare more likely to eat fast food, get no exercise, be obese,\nand smoke cigarettes. Binge drinking (the most com-\nmon pattern of alcohol abuse40) increased among male\nand female subjects (except black and Native American\nsubjects). These findings underscore the importance of\nongoing preventive efforts related to smoking, poor diet\nand physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption early\nin the life course.\nAs adolescents aged into young adulthood, an increas-\ning proportion had no current health insurance, did not\nreceive health care when they needed it, and did not get\nregular dental or physical examinations (male but not fe-\nmale subjects, likely due to the entrance into prime child-\nbearing age). Race/ethnic disparities increased in the need\nfor but inability to afford medical care, further exacer-\nbating race/ethnic disparities in health19,20 and poten-\ntially leading to increased mortality.18\nTable 2.

Although these are\nadmittedly a broad array of health indicators that repre-\nsent several different health constructs, they are impor-\ntant indicators reflecting major health concerns in the\nUnited States at the beginning of the 21st century.8 Fur-\nthermore, the meaning of health risk may change from\nadolescence to young adulthood (eg, sexual behavior may\nbe considered more risky in adolescence than young adult-\nTable 3.

Another limitation is our use of the standard race/\nethnic categories, which may mask important race/\nethnic heterogeneity within these groups.\nOur findings indicate a strong and unprecedented de-\ncline in health during the transition to young adulthood\nin the current generation. Although we have no point of\nreference to compare these findings with those for other\ngenerations, the within-cohort trends indicate deterio-\nration in health behaviors. As this cohort is followed up\nin adulthood, the assessment of morbidity and mortal-\nity outcomes associated with this increased health risk\nwill be possible. Shifts in health profiles are part of our\nepidemiological history when, for example, during the\ndemographic transition a mortality pattern of malnutri-\ntion and infectious disease shifted to one of high preva-\nlence of chronic and degenerative diseases associated with\nurban-industrial lifestyles44 and into a period of delayed\ndegenerative diseases, a major shift in age-specific mor-\ntality patterns, and a consequent increase in life expec-\ntancy.45 Furthermore, evidence suggests that life expec-\ntancy gains have dropped in recent decades.46\nOne finding of major concern is the fact that young\nUS adults are engaging in a range of health risk behav-\niors that puts them at increased risk of future adverse\nhealth outcomes. Our findings have serious implica-\ntions for the present and future health of this genera-\ntion. We find substantial race/ethnic disparities in health\nthat vary depending on the measure. Because our find-\nings show great variability in the levels, relative rank-\nings, and changes in race/ethnic disparities, policies to\nreduce race/ethnic disparities in health require com-\npletely different actions for each health indicator. Atten-\ntion must be paid to national efforts to reduce and ame-\nliorate these preventable conditions, particularly in light\nof national health objectives for reducing race/ethnic dis-\nparities in leading health indicators.\nCorrespondence: Penny Gordon-Larsen, PhD, The Uni-\nversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Carolina Popu-\nlation Center, University Square, 123 West Franklin St,\nFunding/Support: This study was supported by grant P01\nWave of Add Health Data\nProportion Reporting\nC\nWave of Add Health Data\nD\nProportion Reporting\nA\nB\nB\nA\nH\nW\nA\nH\nW\nNA\nB\nA\nH\nW\nNA\nB\nA\nH\nW\nNA\nFigure 1.
