A high concentration of LDL cholesterol, a low\nconcentration of HDL cholesterol, and obesity in childhood all\nmay contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (2).\nAdverse lipid concentrations in adolescence have been shown to\nbe correlated with adverse lipid concentrations in early adulthood\n(3, 4) and have been hypothesized, along with obesity, to con-\ntribute to the development of atherosclerosis in children (1, 2, 5,\nAlthough childhood obesity and adverse lipid concentrations\nare risk factors for atherosclerosis, researchers have described an\nassociation between a high childhood BMI (weight in kilograms\ndivided by height in meters squared) and adverse lipid con-\ncentrations (10\u00ad16). In small longitudinal studies, as childhood\nponderosity or age-adjusted BMI increases, lipid concentrations\ntend to worsen (17, 18), and as childhood BMI decreases, lipid\nconcentrations improve (19).\nThe high prevalence of elevated BMI in US youths (20, 21) and\nthe apparent association between high BMI, adverse lipid con-\ncentrations, and atherosclerosis has raised concern regarding the\nimmediate and long-term health effects of high adiposity in\nchildhood. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has\nrecently recommended fasting lipid profile screening for youths\ncharts (22) and also recommended the pharmacologic treatment\nof children aged 8 y with LDL concentration persistently\n160 mg/dL despite diet therapy who have other risk factors,\nwhich may include BMI 95th percentile (2). Thus, a child's\nBMI, in combination with other risk factors such as a family\nhistory of cardiovascular disease or high LDL cholesterol, can\ninfluence both lipid screening and pharmacologic treatment\ndecisions.\nBMI measures body mass and does not distinguish between fat\nand lean mass. When BMI is used to estimate adiposity, it is\nassumed that, at a given height, a greater weight is associated with\nincreased fatness (23). BMI is an imperfect measure of adiposity,\nalthough children with BMI-for-age 95th percentile tend to\nhave excess body fat (24, 25). If the body fat mass has a biologic\neffect on lipid concentrations, this effect may be inadequately\nrepresented by BMI (26).\nStudies that used nationally representative data to examine the\nrelation between childhood BMI and lipid concentrations have\nbeen published (11, 26). In the current study, to examine the\n1 From the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion, Hyattsville, MD (MML, CLO, MDC, DAL, and KMF), and the Epidemic\nIntelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA\n(MML).\n2 The findings and conclusions in this manuscript are those of the authors\nand do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.\n3 Supported by the US Government.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nrelation between high adiposity and lipid concentrations more\nprecisely, the associations between body fat percentage and lipid\nconcentrations (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,\nand LDL cholesterol) were analyzed using data from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of US youths. Differences by age group,\nrace-ethnicity, and sex were tested.\nNational Center for Health Statistics of the CDC (27). The\nNHANES is a complex, multistage probability sample that is\nrepresentative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population\nand includes a home interview and standardized physical exami-\noversampled non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and\nadolescents aged 12\u00ad19 y, among other demographic groups, to\nprovide statistically reliable estimates for these groups. Race-\nethnicity was self-reported or reported by a proxy. Race-ethnicity\nwas categorized into the following 3 groups for this analysis: non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American.\nOther race-ethnic groups did not have a large enough sample size\nforseparateanalyses.Thesurveywasreviewedandapprovedbythe\nNational Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.\nWritten consent was obtained from participants aged 18 y, and\nparental consent and child assent were obtained for youths aged 7\u00ad\n17 y. These analyses used data from NHANES participants aged\nTotal analysis sample and fasting subsample\nwho did not have total body fat percentage calculated or imputed\n(n = 265), did not have lipids measured (n = 900), self-reported as\nhaving diabetes (n = 43), or were being treated with drugs that may\nhave caused secondary hypercholesterolemia such as estrogens,\nandrogens, b-blockers, carbamazepine, anabolic steroids, and\nprogestins (n = 101) were excluded from all analyses. The total\nand HDL cholesterol measures were available for these 7821\nchildren. Of the 7821 survey participants in the total analysis\nfasted for 8.5\u00ad23 h before phlebotomy in the morning examina-\ntion. Fasting LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were available for\nDXA measurement and high-adiposity definition\nWhole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans\nwere taken with a Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer\n(Hologic). Hologic software (version 8.26:a3*; Hologic) was\nused to administer all scans. Hologic Discovery software (version\n12.1; Hologic) was used to analyze scans. Participants who were\ntoo tall (.6 ft, 5 in), too heavy (.300 lbs) for the DXA table or\nwho were pregnant did not undergo a DXA scan and, thus, had\nmissing DXA data. DXA data were considered invalid if re-\nmovable or nonremovable objects were present or if there was\nan arm/leg overlap, body parts out of the DXA-table scan area,\npositioning problems, or missing limbs.\nDXA data were not missing at random (ie, heaviest partic-\nipants were more likely to have missing DXA data, and DXA data\nwere not collected for girls in 1999 because of the lack of In-\nstitutional Review Board approval). Consequently, a multiple\nimputation of missing DXA data for nonpregnant participants\naged 8 y was performed. The multiple imputation allowed for\nuncertainty because of imputation to be reflected in the analysis.\nThe NHANES has created and recommended analyzing the 5\ncompleted data files that contained both the nonmissing and\nimputed DXA data values (28, 29), which we used in our\nanalyses. Of the 7821 subjects in these analyses, DXA data were\nHighadipositywasdefinedasatotalbodyfatpercentagegreater\nthan or equal to the sex- and age-specific internal smoothed 75th\npercentile. Although there are no standard values of body fat\npercentage that are considered to represent high adiposity, body\nfatnesspercentilesfromthe75thto85thpercentilesapproximately\ncorrespond to the assumptions that obese children (95th per-\ncentile of BMI-for-age) are likely to have high adiposity, and\nnormal-weight children (,85th percentile of BMI-for-age) are\nrelatively unlikely to have high adiposity (25).\nLipid measurement and adverse lipid concentration\ndefinitions\nTotal cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were\nmeasured in the serum for NHANES participants aged 3 y. For\nparticipants with triglyceride concentrations 400 mg/dL (4.52\nmmol/L), LDL cholesterol was calculated by using Friedewald's\nequation (30). Because the distribution of triglyceride values\nwas highly skewed, log transformation was applied to tri-\nglyceride data. Triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were avail-\nable only for participants aged 12 y who reported that they had\nfasted for 8.5\u00ad23 h before a morning examination (27). Children\n,12 y of age were not asked to fast. The method for measuring\nHDL cholesterol was changed in 2003. Because of this change\nin methodology, HDL cholesterol values showed an average\nlow HDL concentrations shown in Tables 1 and 2 were\ndifferences in prevalences of low HDL concentrations between\nthe 2 time periods. The change in the methodology of HDL\nmeasurements was taken into account in the multiple linear\nregression analyses by including the survey period as a covariate\nin the models. Adverse lipid concentrations were defined as\nfollows: total cholesterol .200 mg/dL, triglycerides .150 mg/\ndL and LDL cholesterol .130 mg/dL were considered high.\nHDL cholesterol ,35 mg/dL was considered low. (2, 32)\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences in the prevalence of adverse lipid concentrations\nbetween youths with and without high adiposity were estimated\nby sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\n19 y). In youths with high adiposity, comparisons of adverse lipid\nconcentrations between sexes, race-ethnic groups, and age groups\nwere also made. Univariate comparisons were tested by using\na Student's t statistic with the appropriate number of df and\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nbased on a 2-sided P value. The Bonferroni method was used to\nadjust for multiple comparisons (33). To examine the relation\nbetween body fat percentage and lipid concentrations controlled\nfor possible confounding effects of survey period, age and race-\nethnicity, 8 lipid and sex specificmultiple linear regression models\nadjusted for the survey period (because of the change in the HDL\nmeasurement methodology), age, and race-ethnicity, were used.\nTo determine whether the relation between body fat percentage\nand lipid concentrations differed by sex, 4 lipid-specific multiple\nlinear regression models that included a variable to represent the\ninteraction between sex and body fat percentage were used. These\nmodels were adjusted for the survey period, age, race-ethnicity,\nand sex.\nData were analyzed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute) and\nSUDAAN version 10.0.0 (Research Triangle Institute) statistical\nprograms. All analyses used sample weights to account for dif-\nferential probabilities of selection into the sample, nonresponse,\nand noncoverage. For analyses that involved serum total and HDL\ncholesterol, the examination sample weight was used, and for\nanalysesthatinvolvedserumtriglycerideandLDL cholesterol, the\nmorning fasting sample weight was used (27). Statistical analyses\ntook into account the multiple imputations of body fat data by\naveragingthe5setsofimputations.Thevariationbetweenimputed\ndata sets was formally accounted for in the SEs and significance\nlevels by incorporating the between- and within-imputation var-\niances (28, 29).

In the subsample of fasting youths age 12\u00ad19 y,\n0.7%) of participants had high LDL cholesterol (Table 1).\nPrevalences of adverse lipid concentrations for different\namounts of percentage body fat for boys and girls is shown in\nFor boys, prevalences of high total cholesterol, high trigly-\ncerides, or low HDL cholesterol were significantly greater in\nthose with high adiposity than in those without high adiposity\n(P , 0.01). No difference in the prevalence of high LDL cho-\nlesterol was seen by adiposity status in boys (Table 2). For girls,\nthe prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was significantly greater\nin girls with high adiposity than in girls without high adiposity\n(P , 0.01). No differences in prevalences of high total choles-\nterol, triglycerides, or LDL cholesterol were seen by adiposity\nstatus in girls. In all 3 race-ethnic groups and youths age 12\u00ad19 y,\nthe prevalence of high total cholesterol was significantly greater\nin youths with high adiposity than in youths without high adi-\nposity. Likewise, in all 3 race-ethnic groups and all age groups,\nprevalences of low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides were\nsignificantly different between youths with and without high\nadiposity. However, the prevalence of high LDL cholesterol\ndiffered by adiposity status only in non-Hispanic blacks and did\nnot differ in either of the age groups examined (Table 2).\nMultiple linear regression showed that body fat percentage was\npositively associated with serum total cholesterol, LDL choles-\nterol, and serum triglycerides and inversely associated with HDL\ncholesterol in both boys and girls. The variance in lipid con-\ncentrations that was explained by multiple linear regression\nmodels (R2) was between 2% and 20% (Table 4). Multiple linear\nregression that used body fat mass (in kg) instead of percentage\nbody fat gave very similar results (data not shown).

These results were consistent\nwith those shown by an analysis of NHANES data that explored\nthe association between BMI and adverse lipid concentrations\nin youths (11). In our study, associations varied by sex, race-\nethnicity, and age group.

The results of our study suggested that, in 8\u00ad19-y-olds, older\nteens (aged 16\u00ad19 y) had a stronger relation between adiposity\nand HDL cholesterol than did children and adolescents.

However, Owens et al (39) reported that body fat\npercentage did not explain a significant proportion of the variation\nin lipid concentrations in an analysis restricted to obese children.\nThese studies all had very small sample sizes and limited gener-\nalizability.\nThe current study had findings similar to those of Teixeira et al\n(36), Higgins et al (37), and Steinberger et al (38), who presented\nweak correlations between percentage body fat and lipid con-\ncentrations. However, the current analyses were conducted on\na much larger probability sample of children that was nationally\nrepresentative of the US pediatric population. In addition, the\nNHANES data contained children with a wide range of body fat\npercentage.\nIt is important to note that there is no clear definition of\ntoo much body fat in children. Other studies have analyzed body\nfat percentage as a continuous variable (36, 38, 39), compared\ntertiles of body fat percentage (36), compared subjects above or\nbelow the median body fat percentage (38), have used a percentile\ncutoff (40), or have identified body fat percentage cutoffs that\nindicated adverse cardiovascular risk profiles in their population\n(37).

Although the lipid cutoffs used in this study were lower than\nthose that qualify a child for pharmacologic-treatment consider-\nation, this study showed no significant difference in the prevalence\nof high LDL cholesterol in youths with and without high adiposity\nfor non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans.\nStrengths ofthecurrent study includedtherepresentativenature\nof the sampling, the large sample size, and the use of DXA to\nmeasure percentage body fat. Limitations included the fact that\na substantial proportion of potential subjects did not have lipids\nchildren that did not have lipids measured because of a lack of\na serum sample (whowere excluded from thetotal analysis sample\nand all analyses) revealed no difference in the sex ratio or race-\nethnicity. However, children aged 8\u00ad11 y were less likely to have\nlipids measured than were adolescents aged 12\u00ad15 y or teens aged\n16\u00ad19 y. Second, the small number of children who supplied\nfasting blood samples may have decreased the power to describe\nthe relation between percentage body fat and triglycerides or LDL\ncholesterol. Third, the methodology used to measure HDL cho-\nlesterol changed during the study period and potentially affected\nthe results. However, adjustments for this change were included in\nthe analyses. Fourth, lipid concentrations have been shown to dip\nin the pubertal time period (41), whereas body fat percentages\nincrease in girls and decrease in boys during the pubertal time\nperiod (42). The pubertal stage was not measured in the NHANES\nin an effort to reflect the pubertal time period. Finally, NHANES\nhypercholesterolemia. The family history explains a large per-\ncentage of the variance in lipid concentrations (43). The inclusion\nof family history as a potential confounder in our multivariate\nmodels would have allowed us to see the variance in lipid con-\ncentrations beyond that explained by family history. Thus, the\ninclusion of family history information may have given us more\naccurate estimates (and smaller SEs of the estimates) of the as-\nsociation between lipid concentrations and body fat percentage.\nInconclusion,themajorityofyouthswithhighadiposity didnot\nhavehightotalcholesterol,LDLcholesterol,ortriglyceridesorlow\nHDL cholesterol. In youths with high adiposity, the prevalence of\nadverse lipid concentrations varied by sex, race-ethnicity, and age\ngroup. Significant associations were seen between body fat per-\ncentage and lipid concentrations. Body fat percentage explained\n2\u00ad20% of thevariation in lipid concentrations, which suggests that\nbody fat percentage is one factor that influences lipid concen-\ntrations in youths. Future analyses might focus on the analysis of\nnon-HDL lipid concentrations and include pubertal status and\nfamily history information to improve estimates of the association\nbetween lipid concentrations and body fat percentage in youths.\nWe thank Jack Yanovski of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute\nof Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, for\nhis valuable intellectual contributions to this research.
