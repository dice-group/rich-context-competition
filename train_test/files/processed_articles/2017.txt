During pregnancy, the ex-\npansion of blood volume by '35% and growth of the fetus,\nplacenta, and other maternal tissues increase the demand for iron\nfrom 1.0 to 1.5 mg/d to 5.0 mg/d in the second and third tri-\nmesters (2, 3). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-\ngists, and the Institute of Medicine recommended universal\nconsumption of prenatal supplements with iron to meet preg-\nnancy requirements and prevent anemia (4\u00ad6). Recent random-\nized controlled trials indicated that universal supplementation\nwith iron to meet pregnancy requirements can reduce risk of low\nbirth weight and preterm births (7, 8).\ntotal body iron on the basis of the ratio of soluble transferrin\nreceptor (sTfR) to serum ferritin. This quantitative estimate,\nwhich expresses total body iron on the basis of body weight,\nallows for an evaluation of the full range of iron status from\ndeficiency to excess within a population and provides information\non iron status beyond that of the ferritin model, which is tra-\nditionally used to assess the ID prevalence in the US population\n(11). Positive values of total body iron represent storage iron, and\nnegative values of total body iron indicate tissue ID. The sug-\ngested cutoff for defining ID is ,0 mg/kg (9, 10). Thus, the\nmeasure greatly enhanced the evaluation of iron status and the\nresponse to iron interventions in populations in which in-\nflammation was uncommon or had been excluded by laboratory\nscreening. Published data on the use of total body iron to assess\nthe iron status of pregnant women supported its use in this\nimportant at-risk group. For example, the pattern of total body\niron in pregnant Jamaican and Bolivian women (9) or in US\nAfrican American women (12) followed expected patterns,\nwhich provided indirect evidence that the model may be valid\nfor use in pregnancy.\nInformation on the iron status of pregnant women in the United\nStates has been limited to monitoring anemia in low-income\npregnant women or in nonrepresentative samples (7, 8, 13\u00ad18).\nHowever, an objective to monitor ID in pregnant women was\nincluded, for the first time to our knowledge, in Healthy People\n1 From the National Centers for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health\nPromotion (ZM and LMG-S), Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities\n(MEG), and Environmental Health (CMP), Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, GA; the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD (ACL and DAL); and\nthe Division of Global Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,\n2 The findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\n3 This study received no particular funding.

In this article, to our knowledge, we present the\nfirst estimates of total body iron, sTfR, and serum ferritin for\nexamined the distribution of total body iron by survey, age group,\nrace-ethnicity, trimester, parity, education, and family income.\nFurthermore, we evaluated prevalences and associations of ID on\nthe basisoftotalbodyironwiththat onthebasisofferritinorsTfR\nalone or on the basis of anemia in pregnant women.

NHANES used a stratified multistage proba-\nbility sample that was based on the selection of counties, blocks,\nhouseholds, and finally persons within households. The surveys\nwere conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics,\nCDC, via household interviews followed by standardized phy-\nsical examinations in mobile examination centers.

Urine pregnancy\ntests were administered to all female subjects aged 12\u00ad59 y.\nPregnant women in the NHANES sample fell into 2 groups (24).\nThe first group consisted of women aged 15\u00ad39 y who were\neligible to be selected for a supplemental sample of pregnant\nwomen on the basis of specific sample domain criteria related to\nrace-ethnicity, age, and a self-report of pregnancy at the time of\nthe household screening interview. The pregnancy status of the\nfirst group was confirmed at the physical examination via lab-\noratory tests.\nThe second group of pregnant women consisted of women ages\n15\u00ad39 y who may have been unaware of their pregnancy status at\nthe screening interview or who may have become pregnant in the\ntimebetweenthehouseholdinterviewandphysicalexaminationin\nthe mobile exam center and pregnant women aged ,15 or .39 y\n(eg, women who were not eligible to be selected for the supple-\nmental sample).\nWerestrictedourstudysampletopregnantwomenwhoattended\nmobile examination centers to undergo blood collection for bio-\nchemical analyses (n = 1224). We excluded pregnant women who\nwere missing serum sTfR or ferritin measurements (n = 53). Our\nnant women in our analytic sample, 919 women were part of the\nsupplemental pregnancy sample identified at the screening in-\nterview. Because the supplemental pregnancy sample was se-\nlected to be included in the survey by using predesigned\nalgorithms, valid response rates could be provided for them. The\n919 women from the supplemental sample in the current study\nrepresented 65% of the selected supplemental pregnancy sample,\n76% of the interviewed supplemental sample, and 81% of the\nexamined supplemental sample.\nLaboratory analysis and variable definition\nNational Center of Environmental Health, CDC. Methodologic\ndetails were described earlier (11). In brief, the Tina-quant sTfR\nassay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), which is an\nautomated homogeneous immunoturbidimetric assay, was per-\nformed on a Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN) (25). Because no reference range was provided\nfor sTfR concentrations in pregnant women, we used the manu-\ndefined sTfR concentrations .4.4 mg/L as a threshold for ID. The\nreference range was determined by calculating the 2.5th and\n97.5th percentiles for sTfR in 261 women who fulfilled all criteria\nfor the absence of anemia, an acute-phase response, and ID and\nwere consequently included into the reference population (25).\nSerum ferritin was measured by using 2 methods. In 2003, a\nsingle-incubation 2-site immunoradiometric assay (BioRad Lab-\noratories, Hercules, CA) was used. Thisassay was discontinuedby\n2006 by the Roche Tina-quant ferritin immunoturbidimetric assay\non the Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) (27). The\n(20, 21). Because of method differences between the BioRad and\nRoche ferritin assays, concentrations obtained for 2003 samples\nwith the BioRad assay had to be statistically adjusted to be com-\nparablewiththose obtainedfor 2004samples withtheRoche assay\nrelease by the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS by\napplying 3 piecewise linear-regression equations described in\ndetail elsewhere (26). An abnormal value for ferritin concen-\nHemoglobin was measured as part of a complete blood count in\nthe mobile examination centers with the Beckman Coulter MAXM\nhematology flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Inc, Fullerton, CA)\n(20\u00ad23). We defined anemia for pregnant women according to\nCDC thresholds (4) of a hemoglobin concentration ,110 g/L for\npregnant women in the first trimester; ,105 g/L for pregnant\nwomen in the second trimester; ,110 g/L for pregnant women in\nthe third trimester; and ,110 g/L for pregnant women in an un-\nknown trimester. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at the\nUniversity of Washington by latex-enhanced nephelometry (Dade\nBehring Inc, Deerfield, IL) (20\u00ad23). We defined signs of inflam-\nmation as abnormal CRP concentrations .5.0 mg/L (27).\nParity was based on self-report of the number of pregnancies\nthat resulted in a live birth in women aged 12 y who reported\nthat they had ever been pregnant. Parity was categorized into 0,\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nThe trimester was based on the number of months pregnant\nreported by the mother. Only female subjects who reported that\nthey were pregnant at the time of the medical examination were\nasked about their trimester. The first trimester was defined as 3\nmo pregnant, the second trimester was defined as 4\u00ad6 mo\npregnant, and the third trimester was defined as 7 mo pregnant.\nThe trimester value for women who did not know, were not\nasked, or did not report how long they had been pregnant was\ncategorized as unknown.\nRace-ethnicity was based on self-reported data. Participants\nwho reported they were of a Latino ethnicity other than Mexican\nAmerican and participants who reported they were from more\nthan one race-ethnic group were excluded from comparisons by\nrace-ethnic group because of the small sample size of these\ngroups.\nPregnant women's educational levels were based on the highest\ngrade or level of education completed (less than high school, high\nschool diploma, and more than high school). Family income was\nbased on the poverty-income ratio, which is the ratio of household\nincome to the family's appropriate poverty threshold from the US\nCensus Bureau.\nStatistical analysis\nWeplottedtheserumsTfRandferritindistributionsforpregnant\nwomen. We log transformed ferritin [ln(ferritin)] and sTfR [ln\n(sTfR)] to normalize the distributions because ferritin and sTfR\nconcentrations were positively skewed (28, 29). We described the\nserum ferritin and sTfR distributions [geometric means and 50th\n(median), 25th, and 75th percentiles].

In specific, we deleted women\nwith elevated CRP concentrations (.5 mg/L) and compared the\nprevalence of ID defined by the total body iron with those ob-\ntained in the main analyses. In addition, we evaluated the as-\nsociations of ID on the basis of total body iron and with that on\nthe basis of ferritin or sTfR alone or on the basis of anemia\noverall and by trimesters and race-ethnic groups.\nWe used SUDAAN (version 9.2; Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC) with 8-y sample weights to account\nfor the complex survey design. An 8-y weight variable was\ncreated by assigning one-half of the 4-y weight (WTMEC4YR)\nfor total body iron. We used multiple linear regression models to\ncalculate the adjusted mean total body iron and predicted mar-\nginal from multiple logistic regression models to calculate ad-\njusted ID prevalence. In our analyses, multiple comparisons were\nmade across sociodemographic characteristics in total-body iron\nindicator. The point of these analyses was not to test joint hy-\npotheses. Instead, we tested a priori expectations about total body\niron in relation to each characteristic. Thus, we set statistical\nsignificance at P , 0.05, and no adjustments were made with the\nrecognition that some of the differences in these comparisons\nmay have been due to chance (31).\nRESULTS\nproportions of US pregnant women who were Mexican Ameri-\ncan, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black, were 15.2%,\n56.3%, and 15.3%, respectively. The proportions of US pregnant\nwomen who were in their first, second, third, and unknown tri-\nmesters at the time of the medical examination were 19.1%,\nUS pregnant women had less than a high school education, 19.6%\nof US pregnant women had high school diploma, and 57.3% of\nUS pregnant women had more than high school education. For\n27.3% of US pregnant women, the family income was below the\nMeans, medians, and selected percentiles and percentages of\nabnormal values (prevalences of anemia or ID) of total body iron,\nferritin, serum sTfR, and hemoglobin for US pregnant women are\nshown in Table 1. The prevalence of ID from ferritin (25.0%)\nwas significant higher (paired t test on the difference of proba-\nbility of ID, P , 0.01) than that from sTfR (17.4%) or total body\niron (18.0%). However the prevalence of ID from sTfR and from\ntotal body iron was not statistical significant (P . 0.05). The\nprevalence of anemia was 5.4% (Table 1).\nUnadjusted and adjusted estimates for total body iron (means\nand prevalence of ID) stratified by selected characteristics are\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\npresented in Table 2.

The prevalence of ID\nhigher (unadjusted prevalence) or .5 times higher (adjusted\nprevalence) than the rate for pregnant women aged 35\u00ad49 y\n(Table 2). The distribution of total body iron by 3 age groups\npresented in Figure 1A showed a clear shift in the distribution\nbetween 35\u00ad49 y pregnant women and the other 2 age groups\niron in pregnant women 35\u00ad49 y was much flatter than in the\nother 2 age groups (Figure 1A).\nPregnant women in the first trimester had the highest mean total\nbody iron compared with that of pregnant women in the second or\nthird trimesters. The prevalence of ID in pregnant women in-\ncreased with trimester. For example, the prevalence of ID for\npregnant women in the second trimester was .2 times higher\n(both unadjusted and adjusted rates) than the rate for pregnant\nwomen in the first trimester; and the prevalence of ID for preg-\nnant women in the third trimester was .2 times higher (both\nunadjusted and adjusted rates) than the rate for pregnant women\nin the second trimester (Table 2). Not surprising, the distribution\nof total body iron among 3 trimesters in pregnant women were\nwell separated (Figure 1B) and indicated a complete shift in\nthe distribution in each trimester rather than only a shift below\nthe cutoff (,0 mg/kg). Pregnant women with parity 2 had the\nlowest mean total body iron and the highest prevalence of ID\ncompared with pregnant women with parity of 0 or 1.\nNon-Hispanic white pregnant women had a higher unadjusted\nmean total body iron than either Mexican American pregnant\nwomen or non-Hispanic black pregnant women. However, after\nthe adjustment, the mean total body iron in non-Hispanic white\npregnant women differed significantly from that in non-Hispanic\nblack pregnant women but not from that in Mexican American\npregnant women. The prevalence of ID in non-Hispanic white\npregnant women was significantly lower than the prevalence in\nMexican American pregnant women and in non-Hispanic black\npregnant women, even after the adjustment (Table 2). The dis-\ntribution of total body iron by the 3 race-ethnic groups shown in\nFigure 1C indicated that the distribution shifted to the right for\nnon-Hispanic white pregnant women and to the left for non-\nHispanic black pregnant women. The mean total body iron and\nthe prevalence of ID did not differ by educational level or family\nincome (Table 2).\nResults of the secondary analyses conducted to assess the\neffect of inflammation on study results indicated that 43.9% of the\nsample had elevated CRP concentrations (.5 mg/L). Prevalences\nof ID after excluding subjects with elevated CRP concentration\ndid not substantially differ from the results on the basis of the\nfull sample shown in Table 2.

In pregnant women who were ID as defined by total\nbody iron ,0 mg/kg, 16.2% of women were anemic as defined\nby low hemoglobin concentrations compared with 3.1% of\nwomen in those with total body iron 0 mg/kg.\nWith the use of low ferritin concentrations (,12 lg/L) to\ndefine ID, a similar pattern and prevalence of ID was observed\nby trimester and by race-ethnic group (Table 3) compared with\nthat on the basis of total body iron (Table 2). A similar pattern\nand prevalence of ID on the basis of high sTfR concentrations\n(.4.4 mg/L) by trimester and by race-ethnic group (Table 3)\nwere also observed compared with total body iron (Table 2).\nThe observed higher prevalence of an anemia pattern in\nthe third trimester also was similar to that of total body iron\n(Table 3).\nThe relation between the prevalence of anemia and total body\niron is shown in Figure 2.

In\nthe current article, to our knowledge, we present the first na-\ntionally representative data on the estimated average total body\niron and prevalence of ID on the basis of total body iron for\npregnant women in the US, which is to reflect that some of this\ndata had already been reported to HP 2010 for monitoring\npurposes. The monitoring of the iron status of pregnant women in\nprevious versions of Healthy People was restricted to anemia,\nwhich is the last stage of ID. It is important to identify and\nmonitor ID during pregnancy because anemia is caused by factors\nother than ID; anemia with but not without ID has been associated\nwith low birth weights, preterm deliveries, and perinatal mortality\n(32), and in women without anemia in early pregnancy, ran-\ndomized controlled trials suggested iron supplements were\nneeded to prevent third trimester anemia and low birth weights\nand/or preterm births (7, 8).\nWe observed that the overall prevalence of ID for US pregnant\nand '30% of women in the third trimester were iron deficient.\nThe CDC recommended universal supplementation to meet the\niron requirements of pregnancy (4). The iron intake in pregnant\nwomen during NHANES III was observed to be less than the\nestimated average requirement of 22 mg Fe/d, which led the\nInstitute of Medicine committee on Dietary Reference Intakes to\nnote the need for iron supplementation during pregnancy (6).\nThe prevalence of total body iron ,0 mg/kg in pregnantwomen\nin the current study was double the prevalence of total body iron\n,0 mg/kg that we previously reported in nonpregnant women\nand 1.3\u00ad4.9 times higher than the prevalence observed in children\nage 1\u00ad5 y (11). Prevalences of ID in pregnant women observed in\nprevious smaller studies conducted in the United States were not\ndirectly comparable with our results because the previous studies\nValues for total body iron (calculated from serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations) and iron deficiency (total body iron ,0 mg/kg) in\nUS pregnant women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999\u00ad20061\nn\nUnadjusted mean\nAdjusted mean\nUnadjusted prevalence\nAdjusted prevalence\nSurvey years mg/kg mg/kg % %\nAge\nTrimester\nParity\nRace-ethnic group\nEducation\nFamily income\n1 Within a group, values with different superscript letters were significantly different (P , 0.05, 2-tailed t test). n values were unweighted; all other\nanalyses were weighted. 95% CIs took into account the design effect. Analyses for adjusted means or prevalences were restricted to subjects with no missing\ninformation for all variables listed in the table (n = 1057). Adjusted means or prevalences took into account all sociodemographic characteristic variables listed\nin the table. For example, the adjusted mean total body iron or prevalence of iron deficiency for each age group was adjusted for the survey, race-ethnic group,\ntrimester, parity, education, and family income.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nFIGURE 1. Distributions of total body iron (calculated from serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations) in US pregnant women by age\ngroup (A), trimester (B), and race-ethnic group (C) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999\u00ad2006.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nused other approaches to define an impaired iron status, such as\nWe also showed that low total body iron was more prevalent in\nwomen in the second or third trimester, Mexican American\npregnant women, non-Hispanic black pregnant women, and\nwomen with parity 2. However, neither the mean total body\niron nor the prevalence of ID differed significantly by educa-\ntional level or family income. However, some of our results\ncannot be interpreted by sociodemographic characteristics alone\nwithout detailed information on iron intakes from diets or sup-\npregnant participants, the use of supplements that contained iron\ndiffered by race-ethnicity but not by family income (33). This\nanalysis was focused on the distribution and prevalence of ID\ndefined by total body iron with common sociodemographic\nstratification. Additional studies are needed to explore the\nrelations between total body iron and all of the behavior\ncharacteristics.\nSimilar to studies in nonpregnant women (1, 34), pregnant\nwomen who had parity 2 had a higher prevalence of ID than\npregnant women who had parity ,2. Differences by age were\nless clear and, to our knowledge, have not been previously re-\nported in US pregnant women. Older women may have better\ndiets or be more likely to consume supplements before and\nduring pregnancy (35).\nThe strengths of this study included the use of a sample drawn\nprimarily from a supplemental sample of pregnant women from\nprecise estimates of the status of pregnant women in the United\nStates. The analytic sample used in the current study also had an\nadequate sample size for a detailed analysis. Also, total body iron,\nwhich is a new suggested indicator for better assessment of iron\nstatus, was used for all estimates.\nHowever, our study also had limitations. First, total body iron\nhas only been indirectly validated for use in pregnant women\nbecause the phlebotomy study conducted to validate the model\ndid not include pregnant women (9). However, our secondary\nanalyses showed that the prevalence of anemia decreased ex-\nponentially (Figure 2) in pregnant women with greater con-\ncentrations of total-body iron stores. This suggested, as in\nanalyses in nonpregnant women (11), that total body iron\nmeasured in pregnant women might be used to determine the\nseverity of ID. Although not all anemia is due to ID, the observed\nhigher prevalence of anemia pattern in the third trimester was also\nsimilar to that of total body iron. These additional results may\nprovide indirect support for the validity of total body iron in\npregnant women. Second, sTfR concentrations from NHANES\nhad to be adjusted to be comparable with values produced by the\nFlowers sTfR assay used in the development of the total-body\niron store model (4, 28), and an adjustment factor had to be\napplied to make ferritin concentrations in 2003 comparable with\nUnadjusted prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) on the basis of low serum ferritin or high serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations and the\nunadjusted prevalence of anemia on the basis of low hemoglobin concentrations in US pregnant women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nn\nPrevalence of ID on the basis\nof low serum ferritin concentrations\nPrevalence of ID on the\nbasis of high sTfR concentrations\nPrevalence of anemia on the\nbasis of low hemoglobin concentrations\nTrimester\nRace-ethnic group\n1 n values were unweighted; all other analyses were weighted. 95% CIs took into account the design effect. Within a group, values with different\nsuperscript letters were significantly different (P , 0.05, 2-tailed t test). Abnormal values for ferritin and sTfR concentrations were ,12.0 lg/L and .4.4 mg/\nL, respectively.

Total body iron\nsTfR is soluble transferrin receptor. In calculating total body iron, we\nconverted the Roche sTfR concentration to be equivalent to the Flowers\nassay (30) used in the calculation of the total body iron model by\napplying the following conversion equation: sTfR = 1.5 \u00b7 Roche sTfR +\n0.35 mg/L (24). The unweighted sample size (n) is provided for each point.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nthose in surrounding survey years (19). Third, regression equa-\ntions used to adjust sTfR and ferritin concentrations were based\non the assumption that the assays remain stable over time. Fourth,\na nonresponse bias may have been present in the estimates\npresented in the current study. A nonresponse bias because of\na refusal to participate in the physical examinations in NHANES\nwas reduced by a nonresponse adjustment factor included in the\ncalculation of the sample weights for use with examinee data.\nApproximately 19% of the pregnant women in the analytic\nsample who were part of the supplemental sample that came to\nthe examination centers lacked usable ferritin and sTfR data, and\nthis nonresponse was not addressed by the sample-weight\nadjustments. However, previous studies have not shown that\nreweighting existing sample weights to account for this additional\nnonresponse had much effect on estimates (36, 37). Fifth, our\nresults did not take inflammation and infection into account, even\nthough pregnancy was considered an inflammatory state. How-\never, results from secondary analyses suggested that the potential\neffect of inflammation on our results was small. Specifically,\n43.9% of our sample had elevated CRP concentrations (.5 mg/L),\nbut the prevalence of ID after their exclusion was not substantially\ndifferent from the results on the basis of the entire analytic\nsample. Finally, the lack of a standard sTfR assay method and\na standard reference material will limit the use of total body iron\nin other studies.\nIn conclusion, to our knowledge, we present the first data on\ntotal-body iron distributions from a representative sample of US\npregnant women. These data fill an important need for monitoring\nthe iron status of pregnant women, which has been identified as\na public health objective in Healthy People 2010. We showed that\nID defined by total body iron ,0 mg/kg in pregnant women was\nmore prevalent than we previously reported for nonpregnant\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--ZM: had full access to all data\nin this study and was responsible for the integrity of data and accuracy of the\ndata analysis; MEC, ACL, CMP, SEC, DAL, and LMG-S: study concept and\ndesign, analysis and interpretation of data, and critical revision of the manu-\nscript; and ZM and MEC: drafting of the manuscript and statistical analysis.\nNone of the authors had a financial or personal interest in any company or\norganization connected with the research represented in the article.\nREFERENCES\n1.
