    "reduced_content": "Politicians in the United States have invoked the term \"war\" to develop national support\nfor an all-out attack on criminal behavior on at least three separate occasions sinceWorld\nWar II: the wars on crime, drugs, and terrorism. In each case, the word has been used\nas a metaphor to underscore the conviction that society is involved in a pitched battle and that\nthere is no room for acquiescence or compromise. The implications of the war metaphor or a\ndetailed examination of criminology's role in these three campaigns is beyond the scope of this\nshort introduction. However, I argue that several important similarities can be found across\nthe three major crime-related political wars of the past century and that there is at least one\nimportant difference: Academic criminology was far more engaged in the wars on crime and\ndrugs than it has been in the war on terrorism.\nWars on Crime, Drugs, and Terrorism\nEach of the three wars can be linked directly to presidential politics. Given the United States\npresident's constitutional responsibility to serve as \"commander in chief,\" the president is the\nelected official who is most likely to invoke the war metaphor and be taken seriously.The phrase\n\"war on crime\" was actually already in U.S. politics by the early 1930s when Federal Bureau\nof Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover sponsored a comic strip of the same name that was\nsyndicated in newspapers across the country (Ruth and Reitz, 2003). But it was Arizona Sena-\ntor and Presidential Nominee Barry Goldwater who elevated the war-on-crime metaphor to\nnational prominence by making it a key issue in the 1964 presidential election. Goldwater lost\nthe election but forced President-Elect Lyndon Johnson to take the issue seriously. In the fall of\n1964, Johnson tried to counter Goldwater's focus on the microlevel dynamics of crime fighting\nby arguing that crime was rooted in broad, macrolevel social problems and that warring on\npoverty really constituted warring on crime (Flamm, 2005). But a year later, Johnson dropped\nthe indirect link to poverty and instead declared a new and direct concern with the victims of\ncrime: \"I will not be satisfied until every woman and child in this Nation can walk any street,\nDirect correspondence to Gary LaFree, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742\n(e-mail: glafree@crim.umd.edu).\nCriminology & Public Policy\nenjoy any park, drive on any highway, and live in any community at any time of the day or\nnight without fear of being harmed\" (Flamm, 2005: 51). When Richard Nixon campaigned\nduring the run-up to the election of 1968, he moved the war on crime even more directly to\ncenter stage in presidential politics. At the time of his State of the Union Address in 1970,\nNixon declared that \"If there is one area where the word `war' is appropriate, it is in the fight\nAlthough the U.S. war on drugs can be traced as far back as the 1880s when the United\nStates pressed for a treaty with China that included an absolute prohibition on the shipment\nof opium between the two countries (Eddy, 2003), the modern war on drugs is usually traced\nto 1971 when President Richard Nixon declared an all-out offensive on drugs--which he re-\nAssistance Administration (DEA) was created and charged with enforcing federal drug laws.\nIn 1978, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act was amended to allow\nfor asset forfeiture--which has since been widely used in the war on drugs.\nThe war on drugs received a major boost with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. He\nresponded to perceived drug-related problems by declaring: \"The American people want their\ngovernment to get tough and go on the offensive\" (Walker, 1992: 26) and promising that police\nwould attack the drug problem \"with more ferocity than ever before\" (Donziger, 1996: 115).\nIn 1983, the Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program (DARE) was founded in Los Angeles\nand spread quickly to schools across the country. In 1985, First Lady Nancy Reagan launched\nthe widely publicized Just Say No (to drugs) campaign, promoting it through television and\nradio, popular magazines, bumper stickers, and t-shirts. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988\ncreated the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to lead the war on drugs, and\nWilliam Bennett was appointed as its first director.\nIn 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law En-\nforcement Act, which called for mandatory prison sentences of 20 years to life for some drug\noffenders and the death penalty for those who committed murder in pursuit of illegal drug\nsales. Since the early 1970s, the United States has spent vast sums of money combating drug\nuse and abuse and has created a far-flung bureaucracy to administer these programs. In addi-\ntion to agencies like the DEA and ONDCP that were created directly to combat drugs, a host\nof other agencies--including the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice,\nHomeland Security (DHS), State, Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education--received major\nbudget increases for programs tasked with the control of drugs and the treatment or punish-\nfederal spending on the drug war amounted to $12.2 billion, with the largest amounts going\nto HHS, the Department of Justice, and DHS.\nFewer than 10 days after the attacks on theWorldTrade Center and the Pentagon, President\nGeorge W. Bush declared war on \"terrorism with a global reach\" and promised that the war\nStates passed the USA Patriot Act, which provides a variety of legal tools to fight terrorism at\n LaFree\nhome and abroad. The war on terrorism rapidly took concrete policy form in the campaign to\ntopple the Taliban in Afghanistan. The invasion was preceded by an ultimatum to the Taliban\nto hand over terrorists and was at least implicitly sanctioned by the United Nations Security\nCouncil. After early successes in the Afghan campaign, the Bush administration introduced the\ndoctrine of \"preventive war,\" which suggests that the United States had the right to resort to\nforce to fight terrorists and their supporters at home and abroad, and strongly pushed the idea\nthat Iraq was the next step in the global war on terrorism (Andreani, 2004). President Bush\nclearly identified his presidency with the war on terrorism and emphasized this connection in\nhis ultimately successful election over Democratic opponent John Kerry.\nDespite obvious differences, there are several important similarities between all three of\nthese declared wars on different types of criminal behavior (Caulkins, Kleiman, and Reuter,\n2003; LaFree and Dugan, 2004). First, in all three cases, law enforcement is a necessary but\nnot a sufficient solution. Although this argument has probably been the most controversial\nfor the war on terrorism (LaFree and Hendrickson, 2007), it seems fair to conclude that most\ncommentators now imagine at least some role for law enforcement in preventing terrorism and\nresponding to terrorist attacks. Second, in all three cases, much evidence suggests that taking\na tough stand and attacking the problem aggressively does not always produce desired results.\nThird, in the case of terrorism and drugs and to some extent crime, the problem has domestic\nand transnational aspects. Fourth, in the case of terrorism and drugs and to some extent crime,\nthe problem cuts across various levels of government, agencies, disciplines, and the public and\nprivate sectors in complex ways. And finally, in all three areas, the war metaphor has produced\nsubstantial and to some extent unanticipated policy difficulties. Thus, Flamm (2005) claimed\nthat, because President Johnson promoted the war-model idea of total victory against crime, he\nset himself up for certain failure. As former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach explained,\n\"You are meant to win wars, and the War on Crime was in a sense an unwinnable war.\" Similar\narguments have been voiced in terms of the war metaphor applied to drugs (Robinson and\nHowever, ordinary street crime, drug distribution and use, and terrorism are also distinct\nin important ways, including the scope of violations (crimes and drug violations are com-\nmon, but terrorism is relatively rare); the motivations of participants (terrorists often perceive\nthemselves as altruists; common criminals and drug distributors rarely do); and organizational\nstructure (most common crimes are committed with little organized structure, whereas drug\ndistribution networks and terrorist groups vary greatly in organizational complexity). From a\nresearch standpoint, a major difference between these three types of crime is the differential\ninvolvement of academic criminology.\nAlthough criminology has been involved front and center in the war on crime and drugs,\nthus far, its connection to the war on terrorism has been modest. It is true that criminologists\nhave been making important contributions to the research literature on terrorism and responses to\nterrorism for many years.Two past presidents of the American Society of Criminology, Nicholas\nSpecial Issue Homeland Security and Terrorism\nCriminology & Public Policy\npolitical crime in the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, it is clear that the criminological study of\nterrorism has lagged far behind many other specialized branches of criminology. For example,\nin a review for this introduction, I identified only four articles dealing directly with terrorism,\nresponses to terrorism, and homeland security in Criminology from 1963 to the present (Dugan,\nNote that all four of the Criminology articles are by authors that have contributed to this issue\nof Criminology & Public Policy.\nHowever, the relatively small number of criminologists active in terrorism research has\nbegun to change in recent years. After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and especially\nafter the September 11, 2001 attacks, major federal funding became available for criminologists\nto embark on large-scale empirical work on the study of terrorism. After these events, funding\nthrough the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, terrorism research\nsolicitations by the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Administration, and\neventually the creation of the DHS opened the door for an expanded portfolio of criminological\nresearch on terrorism. More recently, terrorism research solicitations by the National Science\nFoundation, the National Institute of Justice, and the Bureau of Justice Administration along\nwith the creation of the DHS Centers of Excellence Program have strengthened support for\nsocial science studies of terrorism and responses to terrorism. The Minerva program (Wash-\nington Post, 2008), which is funded by the Department of Defense, promises to increase levels\nof support. Moreover, spurred by brutal attacks such as the Madrid and London bombings,\nfunding of social science research on terrorism and responses to terrorism has also expanded\ngreatly in Europe (Eder and Senn, 2008). To underscore the growing effect of these develop-\nments, note that all five articles on terrorism published in Criminology and the Law & Society\nReview identified above have publication dates after 1995.\nIt is of course the hope of the editors and contributors to this issue that the research reported\nhere will increase attention paid to terrorism and responses to terrorism by the criminological\nresearch community.The five articles included can be divided into the two traditional subdivisions\nof criminology, with three articles on the etiology of terrorism (LaFree, Yang, and Crenshaw;\nKelly and Damphousse; Freilich, Chermak, and Caspi) and two articles on the criminal justice\nprocessing of terrorism (Legault and Hendrickson; Useem and Clayton). All of the articles are\ngrounded in empirical data and rely extensively on criminological theories and methods to\nmake their arguments.\nCurrent Contributions\nThe Etiology of Terrorism\nLaFree, Yang, and Crenshaw (2009, this issue) examine the attack patterns of 53 foreign ter-\nrorist groups that have been identified by the U.S. State Department and other government\nsources as posing a special threat to the United States. Using newly available data on nearly\n LaFree\nfind that slightly more than 3% of attacks by these designated anti-U.S. groups were actually\ndirected at the United States. Moreover, more than 99% of attacks targeting the United States\ndid not occur on U.S. soil but were aimed at U.S. targets in other countries (e.g., embassies and\nmultinational corporations). LaFree et al. also find that more than 90% of non-U.S. attacks\nwere domestic (i.e., nationals from one country attacking targets of the same nationality in\nthe same country). The researchers apply group-based trajectory methods for the analysis--a\nmethodology which, up to this point, has been used mostly in criminology.\nThe LaFree et al. (2009) results underscore the importance of proximity for terrorist target-\ning by these foreign groups.These terrorists, like more ordinary criminals, mainly chose targets\nclose to their operational base. Given that most attacks by groups identified as threats by the\nU.S. government are in fact aimed at non-U.S. domestic targets, the authors conclude that the\nUnited States should pursue efforts to strengthen the capacity of local governments to combat\nterrorism and to communicate to other governments the understanding that groups that are\nanti-United States are primarily a threat to the countries in which they are located.\nSmith and Damphousse (2009, this issue) use open-source data on 173 terrorist perpe-\ntrated or planned incidents (55 international and 118 environmental) to contrast the lifespan\nand strategies of a U.S. eco-terrorist group with other types of terrorist groups operating in\nthe United States. Like the article by LaFree et al. (2009), Smith and Damphousse introduce a\nmethodology to the study of terrorism that has not been widely used in the past; they focus on\nexamining the lifespan of terrorist groups by measuring all major terrorist attacks attributed to\nthe group and they analyze the criminal and noncriminal precursor behavior associated with\neach known attack. Their findings suggest that there are important differences in the temporal\npatterns of terrorist groups operating in the United States. Most notably, environmental terrorist\ngroups engage in a relatively short planning cycle compared with right-wing and international\nterrorists. These conclusions suggest caution in interpreting the article by LaFree et al., which\nis limited to foreign terrorist organizations.\nSmith and Damphousse (2009) provide a detailed examination of the Family, a unique\nenvironmentally oriented terrorist group operating during a relatively long period of time.\nThis group provides an interesting contrast to other environmental groups that have been\ncharged with terrorism-related crimes in the United States. Despite important organizational\ndifferences between the Family and other environmental groups using terrorist tactics, Smith\nand Damphousse find that the underlying patterns of preparatory conduct for environmental\ngroups are strikingly similar.The authors conclude that law-enforcement agencies investigating\nenvironmental groups have relatively little time to observe and infiltrate the individual cells and\nthat, compared with other terrorist groups, environmental extremists thus far have engaged in\nattacks that are less deadly.\nLike LaFree et al. (2009) and Smith and Damphousse (2009), Freilich, Caspi, and Chermak\n(2009, this issue) rely on unclassified, open-source data. The authors examine the evolution\nof four domestic far-right racist groups: the Aryan Nations, National Alliance, Public Enemy\nNumber 1 (PEN1), and the Oklahoma Constitutional Militia (OCM). The authors compare\nSpecial Issue Homeland Security and Terrorism\nCriminology & Public Policy\nthe changes that occurred in these groups and find that they were influenced by contextual\nand organizational variables. The first three groups experienced growth and longevity because\nthey (1) had able leadership that set forth a clear ideological message and goals, (2) undertook\nconcrete actions to further their ideology and goals and had the finances necessary for this,\n(3) took advantage of political opportunities, and (4) were internally cohesive. Conversely,\nOCM's leader displayed poor judgment and the group did not set forth a coherent message,\nconduct successful actions, or take advantage of opportunities. Three groups declined because\nof organizational instability and responses by law-enforcement and non-state actors (e.g., watch\ngroups). PEN1, on the other hand, has thus far avoided organizational instability and continues\nto grow despite periodic internal debates about its mission.\nThe article by Freilich et al. (2009) suggests that law-enforcement policymakers should\nconsider how critical incidents affect a group and account for organizational variables that\ndenote the group's strength. Moreover, policymakers must engage in dynamic analyses of ter-\nrorist groups because contextual and organizational features of groups are constantly changing.\nAlthough law-enforcement (and watch-group) responses can reduce or even eliminate violent\ngroups, authorities must be conscious of possible backlash effects. By focusing on all criminal\nactivities--not just those that can be classified as terrorist--researchers and policymakers can\nprovide more sophisticated theoretical explanations for group differences and help law enforce-\nment establish priorities for responding to and preventing future terrorist activities.\nTerrorism and Criminal Justice Issues\nThe final two articles in the volume deal more directly with responses of the legal system to\nterrorism. Legault and Hendrickson (2009, this issue) provide one of the first individual-level\nstudies of terrorists and more common criminals by comparing firearm offending characteristics\nfor 336 offenders convicted of terrorism-related charges from the American Terrorism Study\nwith 923 federal felons convicted by the United States Sentencing Commission. The authors\npoint out that, although previous research describes firearm use by terrorists in the United\nStates as relatively common, there have been few systematic studies of how firearm use varies\nbetween terrorists and ordinary criminals. Legault and Hendrickson find that, compared with\nother felons, offenders charged with terrorism-related offenses were more likely to participate\nin firearm crimes.The authors recommend that official efforts to monitor weapon sales--such\nas the Brady Act--continue to include those named on the terrorist watch list and that those\nnamed on the list should be subject to additional law-enforcement scrutiny when attempting\nto purchase firearms. These efforts should be coordinated by federal law-enforcement agencies\nand should effectively use existing antiterrorism mechanisms to either block purchases or garner\nintelligence on terrorists attempting to obtain firearms.\nUseem and Clayton (2009, this issue) examine 27 medium- and high-security prisons for\nmen in 10 state departments of corrections and 1 municipal jail system during the 2006 to\n2009 calendar years. The authors interviewed a total of 210 prison officials in central offices\nof correctional systems or in separate prison facilities and 270 inmates in prison facilities. In\n LaFree\ntwo cases--the municipal jail system and a state prison system--interviews were limited to\nprison officials.\nUseem and Clayton (2009) focus on jihadi-based radicalization within prisons.Their central\nfinding is that the occurrence of radicalization in U.S. prisons has been low and the probabil-\nity for radicalization in the future is modest. The reasons for predicting a modest probability\nof this type of prison radicalization are fourfold: (1) order and stability in U.S. prisons have\nbeen achieved during the prison buildup period throughout the past four decades; (2) prison\nofficials have successfully implemented efforts to counter the importation of radicalism; (3)\ncorrectional leadership has infused antiradicalization into their agencies; and (4) inmates' low\nlevels of education decrease the appeals of jihad-style terrorism.The prison environment permits\na great deal of information to be collected on the actual and planned activities of inmates after\nthey are released. This requires attentive observation of staff, collection of information from\ninmates, and efforts at different levels of correctional agencies to assemble, collate, and assess\ninformation--much of it likely to be false but some of which will be vital.\nPolicy Essays\nIn response to the five articles in this issue, we include eight policy essays. These essays are\nextremely diverse and provide thoughtful arguments about the complexity of the challenges\nthat face policymakers in this arena. Although Banks (2009, this issue) endorses the chief con-\nclusion of the LaFree et al. (2009) article that greater international cooperation might be the\nbest counterterrorist strategy, he points out barriers to successful implementation of this policy\nand stresses that it should not occur at the expense of less domestic vigilance. Major barriers to\ninternational cooperation on counterterrorism include the absence of internationally recognized\ndefinitions of terrorism, the problem of terrorist threats faced by each country being mostly\nidiosyncratic, the enormous variation in counterterrorist resources of individual nations, and the\nwariness other countries have regarding real or perceived threats to their sovereignty implied by\nbilateral or international counterterrorist strategies. Banks' essay underscores the fundamental\npolicy dilemma posed by attacks with a small likelihood of occurrence but with the potential\nfor a catastrophic effect.\nWeinberg and Eubank (2009, this issue) address similar themes by raising the question\nof whether the relatively limited number of terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland justifies the\ngovernment's enormous outpouring of human and material resources and restrictions on civil\nliberties. These authors highlight a fundamental problem in evaluating terrorism policies that\nalso applies to crime policy more generally: Effective policies tend to undercut their rationale\nfor existing. The use of metal detectors in response to aerial hijackings in the United States\nprovides an example. Research (e.g., Dugan et al., 2005) generally supports the conclusion that\nmetal detectors greatly reduced aerial hijackings in the United States. However, an observer\nassessing the small number of aerial hijackings after the implementation of the extremely costly\nmetal detector program might ask why we would engage in such a costly program to stop a\nbehavior that is so uncommon. In other words, to address the concerns raised by Banks and by\nSpecial Issue Homeland Security and Terrorism\nCriminology & Public Policy\nWeinberg and Eubank, we must not only ask how common attacks by foreign terrorist groups\nhave been, but also how common they would have been had governments not taken action\nto counter them.\nWigle (2009, this issue) provides an extremely thoughtful examination of an operations-\nresearch approach to countering crime and terrorism. Wigle, chief of the Worldwide Incidents\nTeam at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), notes that Smith and Damphousse's\n(2009) research demonstrates that empirical studies using open-source data and relatively few\ncases can nonetheless provide extremely useful information for policymakers. Wigle points out\nthat such research could be strengthened by providing researchers with greater access to larger,\nhigher quality databases and by increasingly using automated empirical data-collection and\nanalytic methods.Wigle also provides a more general warning about the validity of open-source\ndata that applies to several articles in this issue: Journalists looking for stories will often bypass\nfrequently occurring crimes to concentrate on atypical but newsworthy events.\nWigle (2009) offers the most detailed suggestions for systematically improving the quality\nof terrorism data. For example, he provides specific suggestions for studying groups that fre-\nquently change names, sometimes align with other groups, and sometimes disperse altogether\nonly to emerge again with different personnel. Like several other policy essay authors, Wigle\nraises the issue of how to protect civil liberties and privacy while collecting useful data on ter-\nrorists and terrorist groups. Here, he suggests that having policies formulated in advance and\nmaking sure analysts are fully informed of these policies and their implications are the most\neffective strategies.\nWigle argues that law-enforcement and counterterrorism policymakers must recognize the\nvalue of social science terrorism data and do more to make data collection a requirement. He\nsees operations research as a viable way to increase capabilities and to optimize the detection\nand prevention of terrorism, and he encourages academics to work within the existing domestic\nintelligence network and especially to partner with public safety agencies, joint terrorism task\nforces, state fusion centers, and regional intelligence centers.\nPolicy essays by Berlet (2009, this issue) and Blazak (2009, this issue) deal with radicaliza-\ntion and extremism in the United States, but from very different perspectives. Berlet's central\nconcern is that law enforcement and policymakers in the United States often fail to distinguish\nradical ideas from behaviors, and he notes that little empirical evidence exists of a strong link\nbetween radical thoughts and violent acts. But Berlet sees hope in the fact that the Homegrown\nblocked by a coalition of civil liberties groups spanning the political spectrum.\nCompared with Berlet (2009), Blazak (2009) concentrates more directly on the danger of\nhate crimes and particularly on the role that U.S. prisons play in generating right-wing extrem-\nism. Although the research article by Useem and Clayton (2009) does not find strong evidence\nfor jihad-style radicalization in U.S. prisons, Blazak argues that there is much more cause for\n LaFree\n1.The details of this law can be found at govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1955.\nalarm in terms of racist prison gangs, especially from individuals incarcerated under state hate-\ncrime laws and federal civil rights laws. Berlet and Blazak--like nearly all the contributors to this\nissue--point out that thus far there is little empirical data and analysis on terrorism, including\nradicalization and political extremism in the United States.\nthoughtful, and in many ways complementary, appraisals of the connections between domestic\nterrorism in the United States, prisons, and firearms. Similar to Blazak (2009), Austin considers\nthe prevalence and threat of prisoner radicalization.After reading the Useem and Clayton (2009)\nresearch findings and policy discussion, however, Austin questions the need for and success of\ncontinued or increased law-enforcement efforts to prevent terrorist threats. He asks whether\nthe more logical policy issue posed by Useem and Clayton's research is why there has not been\nanother attack since 9/11. He encourages us not to assume that radicalization in prisons is a\nserious problem when the reported evidence contradicts such a notion; rather, Austin proposes\nthat we ask ourselves why terrorists have attacked the United States with such low frequency.\nThe final two essays (Greene, 2009; Forst, 2009) directly discuss Legault and Hendrickson\n(2009). For Greene, the strength of the Legault and Hendrickson article is that it emphasizes\nimportant differences between criminal and terrorist motivations and the implications of these\ndifferences for access to and use of handguns. Greene reminds us that critical differences exist\nbetween distinct types of terrorism and some of these differences may have serious implications\nfor firearm policies and their effectiveness. For example, compared with international terrorists,\nhomegrown terrorists likely respond much more directly to gun control laws and domestic\npolice intelligence. But Greene cautions that gun control laws by themselves are not likely to\nbe effective in stopping terrorism without more complete communication and information\nsharing between local and state government officials and those at the federal level.\nThis emphasis on the need for better communication among local, state, and federal officials\nechoes the earlier discussion by Wigle (2009). Throughout the past decade, Joint Terrorism\nTask Forces (JTTFs) have been organized as major vehicles for improving communication\nlinkages across the various levels of government. But as Greene (2009) points out, the JTTFs\nhave thus far struggled with conflicting missions and organizational cultures and a general lack\nof trust among federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies. Greene also warns against\nan overreliance on rational choice models for explaining terrorism, concluding that behavioral\nand values-based ideas about crime might ultimately be more useful for both prevention and\ninterdiction.\nCompared with Greene (2009), Forst (2009) provides a much more critical view of the\nutility of comparing firearm use by terrorists and common criminals and, more generally,\nfor the contribution of criminological research to terrorism policies. Forst claims that federal\nsentencing data are unrepresentative of firearm cases because they include many white-collar\noffenses, such as mail fraud, embezzlement, and drug trafficking. Forst points out that the\nheterogeneity of terrorism, the sometimes idiosyncratic behavior of terrorists, and the lack of\nreliable data create major barriers to researchers. That said, Forst is somewhat more optimistic\nSpecial Issue Homeland Security and Terrorism\nCriminology & Public Policy\nabout adapting crime-prevention models to terrorism. Compared with Greene, Forst sees more\npromise for routine activities theory and mentions game theory as potentially useful. Whereas\nAustin (2009) focuses on the financial costs of terrorism and the United States' responses to\nterrorism, Forst argues that criminologists could play a useful role in developing models of the\nsocial costs associated with terrorism.\nFollowing the policy essays, we conclude this issue with a thoughtful essay by Jessica Stern\n(2009, this issue), an international expert on terrorism. In particular, Stern provides useful sug-\ngestions for building on the research of LaFree,Yang, and Crenshaw (2009), Useem and Clayton\n(2009), and Legault and Hendrickson (2009). More generally, Stern emphasizes the need for\nbetter empirical data in the study of terrorism and for developing more robust partnerships\nbetween law enforcement, intelligence personnel, and academic researchers. She also stresses\nthe need to remain flexible and open in an ever-changing threat environment and suggests that\nacademic specialists could play an important role here.\nConclusions\nThe wars on crime and drugs have been around long enough to justify asking ourselves whether\nacademic criminology has had any significant effect on policy in these two areas. When we\nthink of policy with regard to crime, we most often think of the ability of research to reduce the\nbehavior in question. And in this sense, the track record of academic research in criminology\nhas not been encouraging. Certainly, the explosive growth in violent crime that plagued the\nUnited States through the early 1990s--especially its poorer central-city areas--has consider-\nably abated. Murder rates in the United States in the early 21st century are now similar to rates\nin the mid-1960s--before the crime boom began (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2008).\nHowever, many might suggest that giving academic criminology credit for these declines is\nreminiscent of the Mark Twain (1889) character who claimed credit for a solar eclipse. The\nsuccess of academic criminology in reducing drug use in the United States is likely to be an\neven tougher argument to make. In fact, it is difficult these days to find any researcher who\nseriously claims that the war on drugs has been a success from a crime-prevention standpoint\n(inter alia, see MacCoun and Reuter, 2001).\nHowever, another way of judging the effect of academic criminology on the wars on crime\nand drugs is to evaluate its success in providing objective data, evaluation, and assessment in\nareas that are often highly contentious. And here the past achievements of criminology are\nmore easily recognized. For example, criminological research in the United States has played\na major role by identifying and describing the nature of crime and drug use and evaluating\npolicies and programs aimed at combating them. Much of the most important criminologi-\ncal research in this arena has produced negative findings. Thus, despite much common sense\nto the contrary, criminological research has not supported strong and consistent connections\nbetween unemployment and crime (Blumstein and Wallman, 2006). Similarly, despite the\nimmense popularity of the DARE anti-drug program with police, school administrators, and\nthe general public, research (e.g., Robinson and Scherlen, 2007) demonstrated that it was not\n LaFree\nonly ineffective but sometimes counterproductive. In fact, an underappreciated yet extremely\nimportant role of criminological research is to provide hard evidence that few magic bullets\nexist in the realm of crime-control policy.\nThere is a troubling irony in the relative lack of empirically based criminological research\non terrorism, because compared with crime and drug use, terrorism represents a type of criminal\nbehavior for which effective policy is especially dependent on hard data and objective analysis.\nAs a result of the lack of systematic empirical research, an area that is in need of clear-eyed,\ndispassionate facts is especially susceptible to half truths and myths. Policymakers have long\nrecognized the value to democratic institutions of a free press to serve as an informed critic\nfor observing public policy and objectively reporting on its causes and consequences to an\ninformed public. As \"slow journalists,\" the role of criminologists in promoting sound policies\nfor the nation's efforts to respond to terrorism may be no less critical. To some extent at least,\ncriminology has served this watch-dog function during the wars on crime and drugs. The role\nthat criminological research will play in understanding terrorism and responses to terrorism\nremains to be seen. But certainly the type of systematic, empirically driven research represented\nby the articles in this volume is an important move in this direction.\nAnd finally, we must be careful not to overstate the similarities between the three types of\ncrime. Ordinary criminals have victims; drug dealers have willing customers; and terrorists have\nnot only victims but also audiences of supporters and would-be supporters. Compared with\nordinary crime and drug crime, terrorism is far less common and is affected by much more than\nsingle extraordinary events like the September 11 attacks. Ordinary crime is to a large extent\nlocal; drug trafficking and terrorism are more likely to cross national borders. But while drug\ntrafficking and terrorism can involve crossing national borders, the scope of border crossing\nis far greater for drug crimes than terrorism. And given the poor record of border security in\nstopping drug trafficking, the probability of success of border control for stopping the much\nless common problem of terrorism is correspondingly diminished. Ordinary crime needs little\nfinancing to flourish; drug crimes and terrorism rely on financing. But the direction of money\nflows for drug dealing and terrorism run in opposite directions: Drug king pins need to laun-\nder money produced by their retail operations; terrorism organizations need to raise money\nand safely transfer it to their operatives. Given these underlying differences, there is clearly no\nsingle set of lessons learned from the wars on crime and drugs that can universally be applied\nto the war on terrorism.\nSpecial Issue Homeland Security and Terrorism\nCriminology & Public Policy\nReferences\nAndreani, Gilles. 2004.
