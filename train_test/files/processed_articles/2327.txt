The majority of these poisonings are related to\nprescription as opposed to over-the-counter medications.\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Rising rates of poisonings in children are\nstrongly correlated with rising use of hypoglycemics,\nantihyperlipidemics, b-blockers, and opioids among adults. These\nevents are associated with considerable health care utilization, both\nin terms of emergency department visits and hospital admissions.\nabstract\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nontherapeutic medication inges-\ntions continue to be a major pediatric health problem, with recent\nincreases in ingestions despite a number of public health interven-\ntions. It is unknown how changes in adult prescription drug use relate\nto pediatric medication poisonings. The objective of the study was to\nmeasure the association between changing adult prescription drug\npatterns and pediatric medication exposures and poisonings and\nidentify high-risk classes of medications and pediatric age groups.\nMETHODS: We measured monthly pediatric exposures and poisonings\nusing the National Poison Data System and prescriptions written for\nadults using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for 2000\nthrough 2009. Associations between adult prescriptions for oral hypo-\nglycemics, antihyperlipidemics, b-blockers, and opioids and expo-\nyears were analyzed by using multiple time-series analysis.\nEmergency department visits, serious injuries, and hospitalizations\nstemming from these associations were described.\nRESULTS: Adult medication prescriptions were statistically significantly as-\nsociated with exposures and poisonings in children of all ages, with the\nstrongest association observed for opioids. Across medications, the great-\nest risk was among children 0 to 5 years old, followed by 13- to 19-year-olds.\nRates of emergency department visits were highest for events related to\nhypoglycemics (60.1%) and b-blockers (59.7%), whereas serious injuries\nand hospitalizations occurred most frequently with opioids (26.8% and\nCONCLUSIONS: Increasing adult drug prescriptions are strongly asso-\nciated with rising pediatric exposures and poisonings, particularly for\nopioids and among children 0 to 5 years old.

Although these mea-\nsures are credited in part with reducing\noverall deaths from medication poi-\nsoning in children, visits to emergency\ndepartments (EDs) for medication ex-\nposures are increasing.6 More than\nunintentional medication exposures\nand poisonings each year.6,7 Of children\npresenting to EDs, at least 12% are\nhospitalized.7,8 Exposures and poison-\nings are most frequently linked to\nprescription medications compared\nwith over-the-counter medications,\nwith children aged #5 years at par-\nticularly high risk and comprising the\nmajority of calls received by US Poison\nCenters.9,10 Many exposures among\nyounger children occur in the child's\nown home, with medications often be-\nlonging to an adult relative.11\nnumber of medication exposures and\npoisonings is again increasing among\nrates of pediatric ED visits and hospi-\ntalizations resulting from medication\nexposures and poisonings increased\nsame time, adult prescription rates\nare increasing.13 However, population\nchanges in adult medication prescrip-\ntions have not been linked with pop-\nulation changes in pediatric exposures\nand poisonings. We aimed to esti-\nmate the association of drug pre-\nscriptions in adults with patterns of\nexposures and poisonings in children,\nand any subsequent health care utili-\nzation and morbidity. In addition, we\naimed to identify high-risk classes of\nmedications and pediatric age groups\nby measuring drug- and age-specific\nassociations.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design\nWe analyzed exposures and poison-\nings reported to US Poison Centers\ncations most commonly prescribed to\nadults. Thesewere analgesics(11.4% of\nall prescriptions), antihyperlipidemics\n(6.2% of all prescriptions), antide-\npressants (4.5% of all prescriptions),\nantidiabetic agents (4.2% of all pre-\nscriptions), and b-blockers (4% of all\nwere excluded to focus on drugs that\nare primarily prescribed in adults to\navoid events related to therapeutic\nuse in children. Analgesics were also\nlimited to opioids to exclude over-the-\ncounter medications (eg, acetamino-\nphen). Finally, we limited our analysis\nto single-ingredient medications and\nexcluded nonoral medications (eg, in-\nsulin). The study was deemed exempt\nfrom review by the Institutional Review\nBoard at Boston Children's Hospital.\nPediatric Exposures and\nPoisonings\nData on pediatric exposures and\npoisonings were obtained from the\nAmerican Association of Poison Con-\ntrol Centers' National Poison Data\nSystem (NPDS). NPDS is a comprehen-\nsive data repository with information\non calls to all 57 US Poison Centers.\nDetailed information is recorded for\nevery exposure or poisoning, includ-\ning patient demographics, names of\nimplicated medications, and specifics\nsurrounding the circumstances of the\ningestion. Case follow-up is performed\nto obtain additional information on\nclinical effects, healthcare require-\nments, and medical outcome. All NPDS\nmedication implicated, clinical effects,\nand associated ED use or hospitaliza-\ncluded if the description of the expo-\nsure or poisoning indicated that the\nevent was related to a pediatric pre-\nscription, such as a parent making a\ndosing error or giving medication doses\ntoo closely together.\nAdult Drug Prescriptions\nAdult drug prescriptions were mea-\nsured using the National Ambulatory\nMedical Care Survey,15 an annual na-\ntional survey of patient visits to US\nnon\u00adfederally employed outpatient\nmedical providers conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics.\nPhysician offices are randomly chosen\nfor participation and are trained by\nNational Center for Health Statistics\nstaff on survey completion. Patient visits\nare randomly chosen in 1-week report-\ning periods to provide representative\nvisits throughout the year. Data col-\nlected include patient demographics,\ndetails of the clinical presentation, and\ncare provided, including drug therapy.\nPhysicians record up to 8 administered\ntinued at the time of the visit. These\n\"drug mentions\" provide a representa-\nidentified alldrug mentions for the drug\nclasses of interest between January 1,\npatients aged $20 years. Using the\nunique drug codes, we excluded\ncombination medications and nono-\nral formulations to match the drugs\nimplicated in exposures and poison-\nings among children.\nHealth Care Utilization and\nMorbidity Related to Exposures\nHealth care utilization is recorded in\nNPDS according to 7 levels: received no\nARTICLE\ntreatment at a health care facility,\ntreated and released, admitted to a\nnoncritical care unit, admitted to a\ncritical care unit, admitted to a psychi-\natric facility, failed to arrive at a health\ncare facility despite referral, and lost\nto follow-up.1 For our analysis, we\ncombined admissions to noncritical\ncare and critical care units and con-\nsidered failure to arrive at a health\ncare facility as lost to follow-up.\nMorbidity related to medication expo-\nsures and poisonings was measured\nusing the NPDS medical outcome cat-\negories. We combined \"moderate ef-\nfect\" (more prolonged or serious\nsymptoms that require clinical atten-\ntion), \"major effect\" (life-threatening\nsigns or symptoms or a residual dis-\nability resulting from the exposure),\nand death (fatality that was a direct\nresult of the medication exposure) and\nconsidered these outcomes as serious\ninjuries.7\nStatistical Analysis\nThe mean monthly number of expo-\nsures and poisonings related to the 4\ndrug classes of interest was calculated\nfor each of the pediatric age groups.\nSimilarly, the mean monthly number of\ndrug mentions among adults was\nmeasured for medications in these\ndrug classes. Both the number of pe-\ndiatric poisonings and of adult drug\nmentions were normalized using US\nCensus estimates to prevent con-\nfounding of the results by changes in\npopulation composition over the study\nAssociations\nTrends in pediatric exposures and\npoisonings were described by using\nmultiple time-series analysis.19 In\nprinciple, the statistical analysis in-\nvolved the specification of time-series\nmodels where exposures and poison-\nings at any given month (t) were\na function of the previous months'adult\nmentions of 1 of the 4 adult studied\nmedications (t \u00ad i) after adjusting for\nseasonality (exposure and poisoning\ntrends may vary similarly year to\nyear and month to month) and auto-\ncorrelation (measurements occurring\ncloser in time are more similar than\nthose farther apart in time). Monthly\ndummy indicators were included as\ncovariates to adjust for potential bia-\nses related to seasonality. This method\nis assumption-free, allowing season-\nality to follow nonlinear patterns.20\nNewey-West standard errors were\nused so the error variance estimates\nwould be valid under autocorrelation\nviolation of regression assumptions,\nyielding conservative estimates of the\nconfidence intervals regardless of any\nanalysis strategy produced valid esti-\nmates insensitive to possible seasonal\nand autocorrelational confounding.\nCausality\nThe causal significance of associations\nwere judged by using a Granger cau-\nsality model in which trends from the\nprevious 1 to 6 months for adult med-\nication mentions were used to predict\nexposure or poisonings after control-\nling for trends in exposure and poi-\nsoningsfromtheprevious1to6months\n(Exposure and poisonings t\n= Adult\nMentionst\u00ad1\n+Adult Mentionst-2\n. . .\n+Adult Mentionst\u00ad6\n+ Exposure and\npoisoningst\u00ad1\n+ Exposure and poison-\n. . . + Exposure and poison-\n).

Among teenagers, ingestions are\nmore likely to be intentional, including\nfor recreational purposes or with the\nintention of self-harm.1,32 As a result, the\nmorbidity and health care utilization\n(including psychiatric admissions, as\nour findings demonstrate) are higher in\nthis older patient population.1,13\nOpioid exposures far exceeded events\nrelated to the other drug classes\namong teenagers. This class of drugs\ndiffers from the others in its potential\nfor abuse.

However, the health\ncare facility utilization and medical\noutcome data provide a measure of the\nextent of serious ingestions. Because\nwe limited ourdata to single-ingredient\nmedications, we were unable to include\ncertain combination medications (eg,\nacetaminophen-hydrocodone), result-\ning in potential underestimation of the\nnumber of exposures and poisonings\nfor thedrugclassesofinterest.Itisalso\npossible that some patients ingested\n.1 medication, and we were unable to\nascertain whether the clinical effects\nexperienced were related solely to\nthe medications of interest. In addi-\ntion, it is important to note that re-\nporting to Poison Control Centers is\nvoluntary, and physicians may be more\nlikely to report exposures related to\ncertain medications. Poison center\ndata therefore provide an approxima-\ntion of real-work poisoning epidemiol-\nogy and are subject to underestimates\nof certain types of exposures. Finally,\nadditional information on the circum-\nstances surrounding ingestions is not\navailable in NPDS, and additional in-\nformation describing whose medica-\ntion was taken, why it was prescribed,\nand the person's relationship to the\nexposed child would be particularly\nuseful in developing future safety\ninterventions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe rising use of opioids, anti-\nhyperlipidemics, oral hypoglycemics,\nand b-blockers among adults is asso-\nciated with a corresponding rise in\nexposures and poisonings related to\nthese drugs in children. These events\nare associated with considerable health\ncare utilization, both in terms of ED\nvisits and hospital admissions. Our\nfindings support the need to strengthen\nintervention efforts around prescrip-\ntion drug ingestions and to develop\nprevention strategies that are both\nage- and medication-specific.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Whether in high\nschool, college, or graduate school, the percentage of students awarded the\nhighest grades continues to climb and the percentage of students awarded the\nlowest grades is quite low. Interestingly, the same might be said for the grades of\nthe educators themselves. As reported in The New York Times (March 31, 2013), in\nsome states 97% or more of public school teachers are rated effective or highly\neffective, and in some counties, 100% of teachers meet these standards. The\nsurfeit of high marks for teachers isworrisome given how much time, money, and\neffort has recently been put into developing new teacher evaluation systems in\nthe hope that the best teachers are rewarded, and the worst teachers either\nremediated or removed from their positions. Teacher evaluations now consist of\ntwo roughly equally weighted components: markers of student progress such as\nstudent test scores, and observation by a principal or other educator, using an\nobservation scale that may include 60 specific elements. In several states, two\nconsecutive low scores are grounds for automatic dismissal. Inflated scores may\nbe in part due to the reluctance of observers to give poor grades, very low\nthresholds for each standard, and changes in student testing. School districts\ncompare reported teacher evaluations and will sometimes retroactively lower\nthe threshold used to meet a standard in their district to bring their results more\nin line with the exemplary results reported in other school districts. Although my\nstudents seem quite adept at giving me remarkably pointed (and insightful)\nfeedback on my teaching, clearly, nationally a bit more work needs to be done to\nsafely, effectively, and reliably identify teachers needing remediation.\nNoted by WVR, MD\nARTICLE"
