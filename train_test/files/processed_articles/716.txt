Hospital discharge\nrates showed little consistent change during the 1970's but increased after 1979. Hospital case fatality\ndeclined during the same period. Cerebrovascular disease discharge rates were higher among older per-\nsons, men, and blacks. Hospital case fatality was higher in older persons and blacks. Rates of cerebral\narteriography and endarterectomy of vessels of the head and neck increased between 1979 and 1983.\nMethodologk problems in monitoring cerebrovascular disease trends are reviewed and recommendations\nfor future research presented.\nDEATH RATES for cerebrovascular disease have de-\nThis decline continued through 1982 (fig. 1). Several\nstudies have attributed this to declining incidence with\nlittle change in case fatality of acute stroke.34 Two\nstudies reported declines in hospitalization rate, an\nthis report, data from the National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey for a ten-year period are presented.

As pre-\nviously described, the National Hospital Discharge\nSurvey encompasses patients discharged from nonin-\nstitutional hospitals exclusive of Federal hospitals lo-\ncated in the 50 States and the District of Columbia.7'8\nIncluded in the list of eligible hospitals are those li-\ncensed hospitals with at least six beds where the aver-\nage length of stay for all patients is less than 30 days.\nHospital discharges are selected for abstracting by a\nmulti-staged sampling procedure described in detail\nelsewhere.7 From a universe of over 8,000 hospitals, a\nsample of over 500 is selected each year, of which over\n400 consent to participate and meet eligibility criteria.\nWithin hospitals, the daily listing sheet of discharges\nwas the frame from which subsamples of discharges\nwere selected. Probabilities of selection at each stage\nof sampling are known so that estimates of national\nstatistics may be obtained. Depending on the study\nprocedure agreed on with the hospital administrator,\neither hospital staffs orrepresentativesof the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS) performed the\nFrom the Office of Analysis and Epidemiology Program, National\nCenter for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Maryland.\nAddress correspondence to: R.F.

Starting in 1979 a\nmaximum of seven codes was assigned.

A modification of the\nInternational Classification of Diseases Adapted\nLess than 1 percent of the dischargerecordsfailed to\ninclude age or sex of patient. However, race was not\nstated for about 13 percent of all discharges. If the\nhospital record did not state age or sex of patient, it was\nimputed by assigning the patient age or sex consistent\nwith age or sex of other patients with the same diagnos-\ntic codes. In 1981 only, a specific race was imputed for\nthose discharges for which race was not stated on the\nmedical record face sheet.8 Race was imputed using\nboth the distribution of race in the geographic area of\nthe hospital as reported by the Bureau of Census and\ninformation on diagnosis and expected source of pay-\nment for those records for which race was imputed.\ndue to technical difficulties. Procedures for calculating\nsampling errors are described in detail elsewhere.

Be-\ncause of the much larger percent of cases with missing\nrace than for other imputed variables, caution should\nbe used in drawing conclusions from the data by race.\nHospital case fatality was computed as follows: the\nnumber of discharges with discharge status coded dead\nwas divided by the total number of discharges with\ncerebrovascular disease. This is a conservative esti-\nmate since those with discharge status coded \"nonstat-\ned\" are assumed to be alive at discharge. However, it\nincludes deaths from co-morbid conditions.\nResults\nTrends\nNo downward trends in rates of discharge of patients\nwith first-listed diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease\nappeared during this period except for persons 65 years\nwas no net change among older persons. In contrast to\nthe appearance of little change during the 1970's, a\ndefinite upward trend in rates was seen between 1979\nand 1983 for both young and old. Hospital case fatality\nrates declined over the period (fig. 3). The change was\nseen both among older and younger persons.\nSeveral technical problems complicate the inter-\npretation of these trends. In 1979, the number of ab-\nstracted diagnoses coded was increased from a maxi-\nmum of 5 to 7. In addition, the comparability ratio\n(NCHS, unpublished data).

Hospital case fatality rates, however, were\nabout 50 percent higher in persons 65 years and over as\ncompared to persons under age 65 (fig. 3).\nSex\nMen had somewhat higher cerebrovascular disease\nhospitalization rates than women in both age groups\n(fig. 2), the difference being greatest in those 45-64\nyears (sex ratio about 1.5). There were no substantial\nsex differences in trends of hospital discharge rates.\nRace\nThe age-adjusted hospital discharge rates by race\nrate for first-listed diagnoses for blacks was 1.3 times\nthat for whites. For persons over 75, there was little\nfatality was over twice as high for men and 60 percent\nhigher for women in blacks compared to whites. Over\n65, the black excess fatality was 15 percent for men\nand 27 percent for women. However, these fatality\ndata must be interpreted with caution because of the\nsmall number of blacks in the sample and resulting\nlarge standard error for subgroup estimates.\nRegion\nThroughout the period the Midwest region had the\nhighest overall discharge rates for cerebrovascular dis-\n\u00a7\ned diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease by age and sex.

No national data are\navailable that permit accurate assessment of trends in\ncerebrovascular disease prevalence, a major determi-\nnant of hospital utilization. However, data from the\nU.S. Health Interview Survey suggest an increase in\nprevalence of cerebrovascular disease reported in\nconsistent with an effect of declining national case\nfatality (fig. 3). Further studies are needed to deter-\nmine how much of the apparent discrepancy in trends\nbetween national discharge data and data from various\nlocalities is due to methodologic considerations.\nSeveral previous papers have discussed methodo-\nlogic problems in community surveillance of trends in\ncerebrovascular disease, mortality and morbidity.19\"23\nSimilar problems may affect both national and local\nstudies. These problems occur in studies regardless of\nwhether the sampling fractions of hospitals and of dis-\ncharges are 100 percent (as in many smaller studies) or\nmuch less than 100 percent (as in the National Hospital\nDischarge Survey). Cases of cerebrovascular disease\ntreated at home or in institutions cannot be detected\nwhile those dying out of hospital may be detected by\ndeath certificate.6 Estimation of acute cerebrovascular\ndisease hospitalization rates is made difficult by sever-\nal problems. Noncooperation of hospitals selected to\nbe sampled is a significant problem. For example, the\nsample of the National Hospital Discharge Survey for\nto participate and 51 were out of scope either because\nthe hospital had gone out of business or because it\nfailed to meet the definition of a short-stay hospital.8\nTo produce unbiased national estimates, an adjustment\nfor nonresponse was made as a component of the esti-\nmation procedure. There is difficulty in establishing an\naccurate sampling frame especially in retrospective\nstudies of years prior to 1979. Many hospitals have\nclosed or merged and may have changed record num-\nbering systems, making sampling difficult. New hos-\npitals have opened during the period of interest. Thus\nfrequent updating of the hospital sample universe is\nnecessary.7 Although much less in recent years, vari-\nation in hospital systems of discharge data retrieval\nmay make sampling difficult because of lacking data\non age, residence, year of discharge, discharge status\nor discharge codes in a form suitable for easy sam-\npling. Fortunately, most hospitals can provide data as\ncomputer printouts or computer tapes rather than as file\ncards or other difficult formats.\nOther problems relate to the lack of reliability of\ninformation on medical record discharge sheets. Stud-\nies by the Institute of Medicine have indicated that this\nproblem is considerable and varies greatly by dis-\ncharge diagnosis and type of data abstracted.24-26 There\nis a substantial lack of reliability in the designation of a\ndiagnosis as principal and the assumption that the first-\nlisted diagnosis is the principal is fraught with difficul-\nty. It is clearly appropriate toreportwhether first-listed\n(principal) or all-listed diagnoses is used in any pub-\nlished reports. The introduction of diagnosis-related-\ngroups and prospective payment in 1983 may affect the\nfrequency of cerebrovascular disease codes, further\ncomplicating the study of trends over time. For estima-\ntion of rates of acute thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke\nresulting from hypertension or arteriosclerosis, exactly\nclear.5'6 If resources are limited, one of the subsets of\ncodes used in two large published studies may be\nadopted.56 Separation of initial acute stroke from re-\ncurrent admissions for acute stroke or for late compli-\ncations of stroke is probably not possible based on\ninformation on the discharge sheet alone. Even using\nfirst-listed diagnosis, a single patient might be counted\nmore than once in a given year by the National Hospi-\ntal Discharge Survey, if there were multiple discharges\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nsample is finally selected, the desired charts may be\nmissing from the medical record room. Further, race\nand other important demographic or other data may be\nmissing from the face sheet (or even from the chart as a\nwhole). This is a particularly severe problem in studies\nlike the National Hospital Discharge Survey in which\nthe protocol precludes searching the body of a chart for\ninformation not listed on the discharge sheet. Such\nproblems may extend even to coding of discharge stat-\nus as alive or dead.8\nAnother problem is the validity of discharge diag-\nnoses quite apart from the reliability of their abstract-\ning and coding.21\"24 In the Nationwide Study of Stroke,\nable transient ischemic attack, 223 had old stroke and\n106 were transferred to another hospital. In a Minneso-\nta study, about half of abstracted cases met strict crite-\nria for acute stroke.6 Even studies with the resources\nneeded to attempt validation of discharges through re-\nview of hospital, clinical and laboratory data face con-\nsiderable problems in this regard. Even with detailed\nreview of medical records by trained nurses or clini-\ncians, pertinent variables in the medical history, phys-\nical examination and laboratory examination including\ncomputerized axial tomography, lumbar puncture, and\nisotopic brain scans may be inconsistently obtained or\nrecorded on substantial proportions of the cases. Fur-\nther, the development and application of diagnostic\ncriteria suitable for such a data set is problematic.5'\"\nThis is particularly true when trends over substantial\nperiods of time are assessed. Innovations in diagnostic\ntechnology make it difficult to establish the compara-\nbility of cases overtime. For example, the introduction\nof computerized axial tomography (CAT scanning) in\nthe late 1970's may have resulted in more cases being\ndiagnosed as acute stroke as compared to earlier\ntimes.3 The rate of CAT scans of the head among\npatients discharged from U.S. hospitals tripled be-\nor hemorrhages would substantially alter the case mix\nand hence the case fatality.4 This makes it difficult to\nfind a common set of criteria which can be uniformly\napplied across long periods of time. A further problem\nfor studies which attempt to approximate incidence is\nthe unknown validity and reliability of the history of\nprevious cerebrovascular disease as abstracted from\nthe hospital record.\nMuch methodologic research is needed to improve\nthe methods for monitoring trends in cerebrovascular\ndisease mortality and morbidity. Further analysis of\ndata from ongoing3'6-w and past5' '\u00b710 surveillance stud-\nies may provide much needed information. Despite\nthese problems researchers should routinely exploit\nexisting data resources such as those of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics and its National Hospital\nDischarge Survey,7'8 National Institute of Neurologi-\ncal and Communicative Disorders and Stroke,3'28 the\nCommission on Professional and Hospital Activities,\nthe Health Care Financing Administration (Medicare),\nand the Veterans Administration especially when plan-\nning epidemiologic studies. Regional or state planning\norganizations and local professional standards review\norganizations or hospital associations may also have\nvaluable data. In analysis of data and reporting of data\nfrom these sources or from special studies, researchers\nshould examine age-, sex-and race- specific data.\nTo further elucidate the causes and effects of the\ndecline in stroke mortality, simultaneous monitoring\nof stroke incidence, recurrence, prevalence and case\nfatality rates adjusted for severity is needed. Long-\nterm survivorship after acute stroke should be as-\nsessed. The few studies that have determined the prev-\nalence and incidence of cerebrovascular disease in\nblack populations have found higher prevalence and\nincidence in blacks than whites, especially among\nwomen.10-'3'M Data is lacking on trends of stroke hos-\npitalization and case fatality in the black population.\nStrategies are needed to reduce the percent of medical\nrecords with missing race and introduce better tech-\nniques for routine imputation of race in national data\nsets. Studies should also be done to determine whether\nblacks have access to diagnostic and therapeutic fa-\ncilities for cerebrovascular disease appropriate for\ntheir high incidence and mortality. Population-based\nstudies of vascular pathology of stroke in blacks com-\npared to whites are needed to confirm reports suggest-\ning that the low rates of carotid endarterectomy may be\ndue to a preponderance of intracranial occlusion in\nblacks.10'3I-n Many methodologic problems remain to\nbe solved to facilitate such research. Meanwhile ef-\nforts aimed at primary prevention of cerebrovascular\ndisease through hypertension control should be vigor-\nously continued.\nReferences\n1.
