Insomnia among\nthe elderly is an important health issue as it has been associated with a higher risk\nfor poorer overall health [3], lower quality of life [4, 5], and morbidity including\nfalls [6] and institutionalization [7], and cognitive impairment [8]. Furthermore,\nthe treatment poses a challenge especially among the elderly due to the frequent\ncoexistence of physical and mental disorders, polypharmacy, and the side effects\nof drugs commonly used to treat sleep problems [9]. Indeed, up to 90% of\ninsomnia patients have been reported to have comorbid physical and/or mental\nillnesses such as mood disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,\nInsomnia may be the result of the chronic conditions, or may be the precursor\nof the chronic conditions. Alternatively, it may share the same underlying factors\nor be an incidental condition. Insomnia subsequent to chronic conditions has\nbeen traditionally called `secondary insomnia' but due to the complexity of the\nassociation where the temporal association or causality is not always clear, the\nterm `comorbid insomnia' to denote this condition was introduced in 2005 by the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) State-of-the-Science conference statement on\nchronic insomnia [12].\nOlder adults are particularly susceptible to comorbid insomnia since the change\nin sleep architecture associated with age, specifically lighter sleep, renders them\nincreasingly vulnerable to sleep disruption caused by physical and mental illnesses\n[13]. Despite this, to date, data on comorbid sleep problems among older adults\nin low- or middle-income settings is scarce. This is an important research gap as\nthe proportion of the global population 60 years and older residing in developing\n[14]. Furthermore, there is a rapid increase in chronic diseases in developing\ncountries [15]. In addition, a progressive increase in the prevalence of sleep\nlarge multi-country study from Asia and Africa focusing on adults aged 50 years\nauthor(s) and do not necessarily represent the\nviews or policies of the World Health Organization.\nThe funders had no role in study design, data\ncollection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nChronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults\nand older reported the prevalence of severe/extreme sleep problems to be as high\nas 43.9% among Bangladeshi women, with prevalence figures higher than 25%\nobserved also in Vietnam and South Africa, suggesting that there may be an\nunder-recognized emerging global epidemic of sleep problems [17].\nThus, the aim of the current study was to assess the association between chronic\nconditions or the number of chronic conditions and sleep problems among older\nadults using nationally-representative data from nine countries which participated\nin the Collaborative Research on Ageing in Europe (COURAGE) survey (Finland,\nPoland, and Spain) and the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health\n(SAGE) survey (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa) for global\ncomparisons. We restricted the analysis to those 50 years or older as sleep\nproblems and chronic diseases are more prevalent in this age group [9, 18].\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of comorbid insomnia or sleep problems and its\nco-existing morbidity is important to guide clinicians as insufficient sleep may\nalso exacerbate the underlying condition and be affecting overall quality of life and\nwellbeing.\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from the COURAGE and SAGE studies. The SAGE dataset is\npublically available online (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/sage/en/). The details\nof the two surveys have been published elsewhere [19, 20]. At the time of the\nsurvey, countries in the COURAGE and SAGE surveys corresponded to high-, and\nlow- or middle-income countries respectively according to the World Bank\nclassification (http://data.worldbank.org/country/). Briefly, the two surveys\nfollowed the same protocol and used standardized questionnaires to collect\ninformation on health and well-being among adult populations. Nationally-\nrepresentative samples were generated by multistage clustered sampling. The\nsample consisted of non-institutionalized adults \u00a718 years of age with\noversampling of those aged\u00a750 years. The COURAGE was conducted between\nresponse rate ranged from 51% (Mexico) to 93% (China). All data were collected\nthrough face-to-face interviews and measurements by trained interviewers. If the\ninterviewer judged that the participant was unable to reply to the survey questions\ndue to limited cognitive function, a shorter questionnaire was used with a proxy\nrespondent replying on behalf of the participant. Blood pressure was measured 2\nand 3 times in the COURAGE and SAGE surveys respectively with a #1 minute\ninterval using standard protocols [21]. Height and weight were measured with the\nuse of a stadiometer and a routinely calibrated electronic weighting scale\nrespectively. Sampling weights were generated to adjust for the population\nstructure reported by the United Nations Statistical Division for the SAGE, and\nthe census of the National Institute of Statistics for the COURAGE. These weights\nwere post-stratified to weight up to the total number of individuals aged \u00a718\nChronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults\nyears in each country. Ethical approval to conduct the COURAGE and SAGE\nsurveys was obtained from local research review boards and the WHO Ethical\nReview Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nVariables\nSleep problems was assessed by the single question ``Overall in the last 30 days,\nhow much of a problem did you have with sleeping, such as falling asleep, waking\nup frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning?'' Answer\noptions were none, mild, moderate, severe, extreme/cannot do. Those who had\nsevere or extreme problems were considered to have sleep problems in keeping\nwith the approach used in a previous study from the SAGE surveys [17].\nThe self-reported diagnosis of eight chronic medical conditions [angina,\narthritis, asthma, depression, chronic lung disease, diabetes (not associated with\npregnancy), hypertension, and stroke] was based on whether the participant had\never been diagnosed to have these conditions. Body mass index (BMI) was\ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared and obesity\nwas defined as BMI\u00a730 kg/m2. We used the combined criteria for the diagnosis\nof chronic conditions with the exception of diabetes, for which no information\nother than self-report was available, and obesity. The combined criteria referred to\nself-reported diagnosis and/or diagnosis based on past-12 months symptoms with\nthe exception of hypertension which was based on blood pressure measurement,\nand stroke which was based on lifetime symptoms. The combined diagnosis\nallowed for the inclusion of those who would not have been diagnosed as having\nthe condition based on self-report alone. Although self-report of diseases has been\nshown to demonstrate good agreement with medical records in developed\ncountries [22], in settings with limited access to health care systems, under-\nreporting of diagnosis may be a problem. In the latter setting, patients may be less\naware of their illness or may only have them detected when they are severe [23].\nAs for the diagnosis based on symptoms or blood pressure measurements,\nangina was based on the algorithms of the Rose questionnaire [24], depression\nwas based on the algorithms of the DSM-IV for major depressive disorder, and\nhypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure \u00a7140 mmHg and/or\ndiastolic blood pressure \u00a790 mmHg. The symptom-based definitions for\narthritis, asthma, chronic lung disease, and stroke were based on typical clinical\nsymptoms and were identical or similar to those used in previous publications\nusing the same questionnaire [23, 25\u00ad27]. Arthritis was defined as having\nexperienced pain, aching, stiffness, or swelling in or around the joints (like arms,\nhands, legs or feet) which were not related to an injury and lasted for more than a\nmonth, and having experienced stiffness lasting for less than 30 minutes in the\njoint in the morning after getting up from bed or after a long rest of the joint\nwithout movement which goes away after exercise or movement in the joint.\nAsthma was defined as having had an attack of wheezing or whistling breathing\nand at least one of the following: attack of wheezing after stopping exercise or\nsome other physical activity; a feeling of tightness in the chest; experience of\nChronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults\nwaking up with a feeling of tightness in the chest; attack of shortness of breath\nwithout obvious cause when not exercising or doing some physical activity.\nChronic lung disease referred to having all of the following: shortness of breath at\nrest; coughing or wheezing for ten minutes or more at a time; coughing up\nsputum or phlegm for most days of the month for at least 3 months. Stroke was\ndefined as ever having suffered from sudden onset of paralysis or weakness and\nloss of sensation on one side of the body for more than 24 hours. The number of\nchronic conditions was based on the nine aforementioned chronic conditions and\nThe selection of the control variables used in the models was based on past\nhighest level of education completed (#primary, secondary,\u00a7tertiary), wealth\nquintiles based on country-specific income, marital status (currently married/\ncohabiting or not married), past-30 days alcohol consumption (no, yes), current\nsmoking status (no, yes), and physical activity levels based on the Global Physical\nActivity Questionnaire (high, moderate, low).\nStatistical analysis\nParticipants whose information was obtained through the proxy questionnaire\nwere excluded from the analysis as information on a large number of the variables\npertaining to the current analysis was not collected. Analyses were conducted\nusing the pooled sample including all countries and also by country. Country-wise\nanalyses were conducted as one of our main objectives was to assess the between-\ncountry differences in terms of the association between chronic conditions and\nsleep problems. Chronic conditions in the main text referred to those diagnosed\nby the combined criteria in all analyses with the exception of data presented in\nTable 1 where the prevalence of chronic diseases based on both the self-reported\nand the combined diagnoses are shown. Analyses based solely on self-reported\nchronic conditions are shown only in the appendix as sensitivity analysis.\nThe crude prevalence of baseline characteristics of the study sample was\ncalculated (Table 1). The age-adjusted prevalence of sleep problems and chronic\nconditions was calculated using the United Nation population pyramids for the\nyear 2010 (http://esa.un.org/wpp/Excel-Data/population.htm) as the standard\npopulation (Table 2). The difference in the prevalence of sleep problems by the\npresence or absence of the individual chronic conditions was tested by chi-\nsquared tests (Table 3). Logistic regression analyses with multiple variables were\ndone to assess the association between the chronic health conditions or the\nnumber of chronic health conditions (independent variable) and sleep problems\n(dependent variable). In the analysis assessing the association between the\nindividual chronic health conditions and sleep problems, the models were\nmutually adjusted for the nine chronic conditions in addition to age, sex,\neducation, wealth, marital status, alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical\nactivity (Table 4). The nine chronic conditions were included simultaneously in\nthe models as these conditions tend to co-occur [25], and have all been associated\nChronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults\nwith sleep problems [10, 33\u00ad46]. In the analysis on the association between the\nnumber of chronic health conditions and sleep problems, the models were\nadjusted for age, sex, education, wealth, marital status, alcohol consumption,\nsmoking, and physical activity (Table 5). A test for trend was conducted by\nincluding the number of chronic conditions in the model as a continuous\nvariable. Adjustment for country was also done for regression models that pooled\ndata of all countries by including countries as dummy variables in the models. The\nsample weighting and the complex study design were taken into account in all\nanalyses to generate nationally-representative estimates using the Stata svy\ncommand. We analyzed data with Stata version 12.1 (Stata Corp LP, College\nStation, Texas). The level of statistical significance was set at P,0.05.\nResults\nThe analytical sample size, after excluding those whose information was obtained\nby the proxy questionnaire and individuals aged,50 years, was 42116 (China\nThe baseline characteristics of the study sample are illustrated in Table 1.

Angina, chronic lung disease, and depression\nwere significantly associated with higher prevalence of sleep problems in all\nindividual countries as well. In the majority of countries, a significantly greater\nlikelihood for sleep problems was observed for all the other chronic conditions as\nwell although this association for hypertension and obesity were observed in fewer\ncountries. The associations between sleep problems and chronic conditions\nestimated by logistic regression with multiple variables are illustrated in Table 4\n(results for all covariates in the models are available in Table S1).

The\nassociation between the number of chronic conditions and sleep problems is\nshown in Table 5 (results for all covariates in the models are available in Table S2\nof the Appendix). A significant linear dose-dependent relationship between the\nnumber of chronic conditions and sleep problems was observed in all samples.\nFinally, the results of the sensitivity analyses based solely on self-reported\ndiagnoses were generally similar to the main analysis with changes in statistical\nsignificance occurring more commonly in the SAGE countries than the\nCOURAGE countries (Appendix Table S3, S4, S5). In particular, self-reported\nhypertension was associated with sleep problems in Finland, India, and Mexico\ndespite the fact that hypertension based on self-report and/or blood pressure\nmeasurement was not associated with sleep problems in any of the countries.\nDiscussion\nOur study has shown that sleep problems among older adults were common in\nmany common chronic conditions are associated with sleep problems even after\nadjustment for confounders. No distinct patterns regarding the association\nbetween sleep problems and individual chronic conditions were observed by\nregion or the level of economic development of the country. The strength of our\nstudy is the large sample size and the use of nationally-representative datasets\nfrom diverse settings. Also, our diagnostic definition incorporating symptoms or\nblood pressure measurement is likely to have reduced under-diagnosis especially\nin resource-limited settings. We also adjusted for depression which many previous\nstudies failed to do despite its strong association with sleep and physical illness\n[47]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-continent study to\nexamine the association between chronic conditions and sleep problems.\nSeveral limitations deserve mentioning before discussing the results. There are\nno standard definitions for insomnia or sleep problems in epidemiological\nresearch [48]. Although we used a single-item question to define sleep problems,\nthe question encompassed the three dimensions of insomnia (i.e. problems falling\nasleep, waking up frequently during the night, and waking up too early in the\nmorning) [49]. Also, the use of severe or extreme categories to define sleep\nproblems is likely to have improved the specificity. However, we were unable to\nconduct detailed analyses on the severity, type, or chronicity of the sleep problem\nwhich would have lead to better understanding of the association between sleep\nproblems and chronic conditions. Next, we attempted to reduce under-diagnosis\nof chronic conditions by the use of an algorithm based on symptoms but the use\nof non-validated instruments for arthritis, asthma, chronic lung diseases, and\nstroke may have lead to higher sensitivity at the expense of lower specificity.\nHowever, in order to minimize misclassification, we used algorithms based on\ncurrent clinical guidelines and reference publications [25]. Furthermore, due to\nthe high potential for under-diagnosis especially in resource-limited settings, as\nChronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults\nevidenced by a higher rate of discrepancy between the two diagnostic definitions\nespecially in the SAGE countries, we believe that this procedure was necessary and\njustifiable to address our study question. Next, due to the difficulty in\ndifferentiating chronic lung diseases such as COPD and asthma because of the\noverlapping symptoms especially among older populations [50], varying degrees\nof misclassification depending on the setting is likely to have occurred. Also, we\ndid not have information on caffeine intake or conditions such as anxiety\ndisorder, sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, migraine, restless leg syndrome, and\nneurological disorders known to be associated with sleep problems [10, 48, 51].\nThus, their independent and confounding effects remain unknown. In addition,\nsome country-wise analyses may have lacked statistical power due to small sample\nsize. Moreover, the COURAGE and the SAGE surveys were conducted in different\nsituation in some countries. Finally, because this was a cross-sectional study,\ncausality cannot be inferred.\nData from high-income countries have reported associations between sleep\nless consistent. One of the only studies from developing countries on comorbid\ninsomnia conducted in Nigeria reported a significant association between\ninsomnia and arthritis, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, asthma, but not\ndiabetes [52]. In our study, angina, arthritis, chronic lung disease, and depression\nwere significantly associated with sleep problems in the majority or all of the\ncountries studied, and significant associations between other chronic conditions\nwere also observed in fewer countries with the exception of hypertension and\nobesity.\nThe associations between sleep problems and the chronic conditions may be\nexplained by the co-existence of sleep-disordered breathing in conditions such as\nchronic lung disease, diabetes, and stroke [53, 54], or symptoms of the chronic\nconditions per se (e.g. nocturnal symptoms in asthma [38], COPD [54], and\nangina [55], and nocturia in diabetes [56]). Furthermore, recent studies have\npointed to the potential role of insomnia in the future occurrence of metabolic\nand cardiovascular diseases [43, 57, 58]. The association between arthritis and\nsleep problems may be mediated by pain [34, 35] and physical limitation [35].\nDepression is the condition most likely to co-exist with chronic insomnia [10],\nand sleep problem is one of the core symptoms of depression, which has also been\nlinked to the subsequent onset of many psychiatric disorders including depression\n[59]. Finally, these associations may also be explained by psychological distress\nand anxiety associated with these conditions [60, 61].\nAlthough the reason for between-country differences in the association between\nchronic conditions and sleep problems is unclear, one may speculate several\nreasons. First of all, the question on sleep may have been interpreted differently\nbetween countries. Secondly, the accuracy of the diagnosis of chronic medical\ncondition or its severity may have differed depending on the country.\nChronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults\nFurthermore, non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic treatment [62] for insomnia\nmay have been more common in some settings. Finally, a variety of drugs to treat\nchronic conditions, such as SSRIs and beta-blockers, may induce insomnia [10]\nand these drugs may have been more commonly prescribed in some areas.\nPreviously, treating the comorbid condition was believed to lead to the\nimprovement in sleep conditions. However, evidence is emerging that this might\nnot be the case, and that better treatment outcome may be expected if insomnia is\ntreated separately, possibly even for the underlying chronic condition [10].\nAlthough most previous clinical trials demonstrating the added benefits of\ntreating insomnia in conjunction to the co-existing morbidity are on mental\ndisorders [11], or arthritis [63, 64], sleep deprivation among those with COPD has\nbeen reported to lead to a small fall in forced expiratory volume and forced vital\ncapacity [65], and studies have also shown that short sleep may impair glucose\ntolerance among individuals with and without diabetes [66]. Furthermore, sleep\nproblems may affect immunity, inflammation or cause distress, which may\ncontribute to severity of disease [37].\nThere are currently no treatment algorithms specifically for comorbid\ninsomnia, but several treatment options for comorbid insomnia have been\nproposed and include pharmacologic, and non-pharmacologic treatments such as\ncognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene, and relaxation training [11]. In\nresource-limited settings, many of the hypnotics used in developed country\nsettings may not be available [62], and cost-effectiveness is a more crucial issue.\nIn conclusion, this study has shown that comorbid sleep problems affect\nindividuals in developing and developed countries alike. Longitudinal studies\nespecially in low- or middle-income countries, where only limited data exist [67],\nare warranted to understand the cause-and-effect relationships between chronic\nconditions and sleep problems. Medical personnel should consider the possibility\nof co-existing mental or physical conditions for patients presenting with\nsymptoms of insomnia, and for those patients with a chronic condition,\nidentifying co-existing sleep problems and treating them simultaneously may lead\nto better treatment outcome. Also, clinicians should be aware of the particularly\nhigh risk of sleep problems among those with multimorbidity. Future studies are\nneeded to elucidate the best treatment options for comorbid sleep problems\nespecially in resource-limited settings.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1.
