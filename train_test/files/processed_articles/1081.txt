Indeed, there are many similarities between the health, social,\neconomic and demographic profiles of these two groups. However, there is\nevidence that Caribbean people in the US are faring considerably better. This\npaper explores differences in the social and economic position of Black American,\nBlack Caribbean and white people in the US and Black Caribbean and white\npeople in England, how these relate to ethnic inequalities in health, and may be\nunderpinned by differences in patterns and contexts of migration. We use similar\nsurveys from the US and England to explore these questions. The US data were\ndrawn from the National Survey of American Life and the English data were\ndrawn from the Health Survey for England and a follow up study. Findings show\nthe advantaged health position of Caribbean American people in comparison\nwith both Caribbean people in England and Black American people. Multivariate\nanalyses indicate that these differences, and the differences in health between\nBlack and white people in the two countries, are a consequence of social and\neconomic inequalities.\n",

Here the findings are contested, with\nsome emphasising the genetic underpinning of such inequalities (Wild and McKeigue 1997)\nand others arguing that ethnic inequalities in health are predominantly determined by\nsocial and economic inequalities (Nazroo 1998, 2003). Regardless of the contribution of\ngenetic factors, it is clear that there is a socioeconomic patterning of the health of Black\npopulations, with higher rates of disease and poorer health related to both poorer economic\npositions and exposure to racial harassment and discrimination (Krieger et al. 1993,\nfactors are adjusted for in statistical models, differences in health between Black and white\nThe implication is that socioeconomic factors at least interact (in both a causal and\nstatistical sense) with genetic (and other) influences and, therefore, a greater understanding\nof socioeconomic inequalities and their origins will both increase our understanding of\ncausal processes and point to opportunities for the development of public-health policy.\nNevertheless, the majority of existing research has, not surprisingly, focused on proximal\ninfluences and pathways, including a mix of social, psychological, biological and genetic\nfactors \u00ad such as current socioeconomic position, experiences of racism and discrimination,\nsocial networks, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Less attention has been paid\nto the more distal processes that have led to the contemporary social and economic\nlocation of ethnic minority groups and the related ethnic patterning of health outcomes.\nThere is no certainty that the disadvantages of ethnic groups are fixed across countries,\ngenerations, or across different `Black identities' (Agyemang et al. 2005). Indeed, while\nthere are many similarities between the health, social, economic and demographic profiles\nof Black Americans in the US and Caribbean people in England, there are also marked\ndifferences in the history of these groups. While Black Americans have been resident in the\nUS since they arrived as slaves, Caribbean people arrived in England after World War II\nas labour migrants. This migration happened in the face of considerable hostility from\nsome of the English population, but at a time when the civil rights movement was emerging\nin the US, with a consequent opening up of opportunities for Black Americans. There is,\nhowever, evidence to suggest that the civil rights movement most affected those who\nsubsequently migrated into the US, rather than those who were already there (Butcher\n1994, Model 1995). Indeed, the socioeconomic profile of Caribbean people who migrated to\nthe US appears better than that of Black Americans (Foner 2005, Jackson and Antonucci\n2006). And a series of US studies that have explored race inequalities in birth outcomes by\ncountry of birth have generally found that Black women born overseas have more favourable\noutcomes than those born in the US (Cabral et al. 1990, Pallotto et al. 2000, Acevado-\nto this).\nThis points to the need to move beyond the treatment of ethnicity as an unproblematic\nvariable in health analysis, where `Caribbean', or even `Black', labels are seen as representing\nglobal uniform categories whose meaning can be assumed and for whom findings can\nbe generalised from one context or group to another (Cabral et al. 1990, Bhopal 2004,\nThe Black diaspora and health inequalities 813\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nHoward et al. 2006). Central to an understanding of socioeconomic inequalities and how\nthey relate to the ethnic patterning of health is approaching ethnicity as a social identity,\nrecognising the variable nature of such identities across contexts and generations, and the\nfactors that underpin such variability (Hall 1992). To what extent does being `Black' have\ndifferent meanings in different locations, for different Black groups, and for different\ngenerations? How does this configure social (ethnic/race) relations? And what implications\ndoes this have for health inequalities? One way forward is to consider how the pattern and\ncontext of migration has influenced the social and economic circumstances of populations\npost-migration and, consequently, health inequalities.\nInvestigating these issues in one country context \u00ad which has typically been the case,\nespecially with large population-based surveys \u00ad limits variability across social, economic\nand historical contexts, making it difficult to identify the factors that lead to positive and\nnegative outcomes for migrants. For example, the migration from the Caribbean to England\nhappened in a circumscribed period and was driven by particular economic and political\nfactors, leaving little variation in the characteristics of the migration population, the\ncircumstances into which they migrated, and their post-migration experiences. Data on\nsimilar populations who have migrated in, and to, very different circumstances provide\nthe opportunity to conduct the kinds of comparative analyses that will facilitate\ngreater understanding of how the variable patterns and contexts of migration drive ethnic\ninequalities in health. Although distal in the causal pathway, these factors remain relevant\nto contemporary migrant and post-migration populations.\nWe aim to advance this agenda by examining the patterning of ethnic inequalities in\nhealth between five ethnic groups in the US and England \u00ad Black American, Caribbean\nAmerican, white American, Caribbean English and white English \u00ad and the social and\neconomic factors that might underlie any differences in health that are observed. We\nhypothesise that differences between the three Black groups in their migration histories and\nconsequent social and economic positions will lead to differences in the health inequalities\nthey experience.\nMethods\nSurvey design\nThe analysis uses survey data from three sources, each with a probability sample design.\nUS data are from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), which was conducted in\n2001\u00ad3. Full details of the study have been reported elsewhere (Jackson et al. 2004, Jackson\nand Antonucci 2006, Heeringa et al. 2006). In brief, it is based upon an integrated\nnational household probability sample of 3,570 Black American adults and 810 co-resident\nadolescents (response rate 78%) and 891 non-Hispanic white adults (response rate 70%).\nRespondents were allocated into the Black American and Caribbean American categories if\nthey self-identified as `Black', with the Caribbean category further defined using questions\non country of ancestry. Migrants identifying as Black but not from the Caribbean were\nexcluded from the sample for this analysis (most of these were born in Africa). The Black\nAmerican and white samples were selected from geographical segments in proportion to\nthe Black American population distribution; the Caribbean sample was selected from the\nBlack American segments and from additional metropolitan segments with more than\n10 per cent Caribbean people. This makes NSAL the first national sample of people of\ndifferent race and ethnic groups who live in the same contexts and geographical areas as\n814 James Nazroo, James Jackson et al.\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nBlack Americans. This does however mean that the white sample is representative only of\nwhite people who live in areas where the density of the black population is 10 per cent or\ngreater. Interviews were conducted by ethnically matched interviewers using a standardised\nface-to-face computerised interview.\nEnglish data were drawn from the Health Survey for England (HSE) 1998 and 1999, and\na follow-up study on mental illness (EMPIRIC \u00ad Ethnic Minority Psychiatric Illness Rates\nin the Community). These studies are described in detail elsewhere (Erens and Primatesta\nabout the health of people in England that has been conducted annually since 1991. The\nHSE sampling procedures are similar to those for NSAL and are designed to select prob-\nability samples of both individuals and households, with respondents recruited from a\nsample of addresses selected from within a stratified sample of postcode sectors using\nthe Postcode Address File. Black Caribbean respondents were drawn from the 1999 HSE\n(Erens et al. 2001), which was boosted to contain greater proportions of people from ethnic\nminority groups. The white English group was drawn from the 1998 HSE (Erens and\nPrimatesta 1999), because a full interview was not administered to white informants at the\n1999 HSE. For the 1999 HSE, sampling points were identified using information from the\n1991 Census, which allowed postcode sectors to be stratified and selected on the basis of\ntheir ethnic composition. Areas with low concentrations of ethnic minority people were\nalso identified and included. Screening for non-white ethnic minority respondents in areas\nwith few ethnic minority residents was carried out using the validated focused enumeration\ntechnique (Smith and Prior 1997, Brown and Richie, 1981). Respondents were identified as\nsuitable for inclusion and allocated to an ethnic group on the basis of their responses\nto a question on their ethnic family origins, a categorisation that correlates highly with\nself-identified ethnicity (Nazroo 2001), with those identifying Caribbean origins included\nwhite English respondents (response rate 70%) and 1,217 Caribbean respondents (response\nrate estimated at 55%).\nEMPIRIC (Sproston and Nazroo 2002) was a follow-up survey of those aged 16 to 74 in\nthe 1998 (a subsample only) and 1999 HSE samples, collecting additional information on\nmental health, ethnic identity and experiences and perceptions of racism and discrimination.\nThis resulted in a sample of 753 white English respondents (response rate 71%) and 647\nCaribbean respondents (response rate 68%) for analyses involving racism variables.\nFor this paper we have altered the labelling of ethnic groups from those used in the\noriginal surveys, to clearly distinguish national origin. The labels we use are: Black American,\nCaribbean American, white American, white English, Caribbean English. In addition,\nbecause of differences in the ages covered in the different surveys, only those aged 18 to 74\nare included in the analyses we present.\nMeasures and equivalence of data items\nAlthough the US and English data collections were designed independently, similar topics\nwere covered in their questionnaires, giving the potential for a joint analysis of their data.\nThe following describes the measures that were used in the analyses presented in this paper,\nafter which we discuss issues relating to the non-equivalence of data items in the surveys.\nGeneral (self-assessed) health was established using different measures in the different\nsurveys. In NSAL, respondents were asked: `How would you rate your overall physical\nhealth at the present time? Would you say it is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?'.\nIn the HSE respondents were asked `How is your health in general? Would you say it was\nvery good, good, fair, bad or very bad?' And the HSE respondents included in EMPIRIC\nThe Black diaspora and health inequalities 815\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nwere asked: `In general, would you say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair or\npoor?' For this analysis, NSAL respondents are coded according to whether they had\nresponded `excellent', `very good' or `good', as opposed to those responding `fair' or\n`poor'. Respondents to the HSE were grouped according to whether they had responded\n`excellent' or `good', as opposed to those responding `fair', `bad' or `very bad'. The\ncomparability of these questions is explored at the end of this section of the paper.\nBoth NSAL and the HSE included questions on diagnosed conditions and, in their list\nof conditions, both included: heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and stroke. For all but\nheart disease the questions were almost identical. For heart disease, NSAL asked one\nquestion asking about `heart trouble', while the HSE had several questions covering:\nangina, heart attack, heart murmur, irregular heart rhythm and other heart trouble.\nHousehold income was collected in categories using a showcard on both sites. It was\nequivalised using the McClements scoring system, which takes account of the number of\npeople in the household (McClements 1977). A score was allocated to each household\nmember, and these were added together to produce an overall McClements score. The head\n(or first adult) of the household was given a score of 0.61, the spouse/partner of the head\nwas given a score of 0.39. Other second adults were given a score of 0.46, third adults, 0.42\nand subsequent adults, 0.36. Dependent children aged below two were given a score of\nand those aged 16 or over were given a score of 0.36. For these analyses it was assumed\nthat the respondent was the head of household and that adulthood begins at 18 years.\nEquivalised income was derived as the annual household income divided by the McClements\nscore, which was then attributed to all members of the household. Rather than attempting\ndirectly to equate US and English incomes, the equivalised income was categorised into US\nand English population specific quintiles. About 13 per cent of respondents did not report\ntheir income (ranging from 8.6 per cent in the white American group to 15.5 per cent in\nthe Black American group), so these respondents have been included as an additional\ncategory for the income variable.\nEmployment status was coded `employed or in fulltime education', `unemployed',\n`unemployed due to long term sickness', `looking after the home' and `retired'.\nDifferences in education systems between England and the US made it necessary to\nremove some of the detail contained in the country-specific education measures to create\ncomparable scales. NSAL respondents were asked how many years of education they had\ncompleted and were then asked if they had obtained a high school graduation certificate,\na college degree or certificate and if they had had any other form of schooling. HSE\nrespondents were simply asked about any qualifications gained. For these analyses,\neducational level was categorised according to the highest qualification gained: those\nwith less than a high-school certificate or A-level; those with A-levels or an American high-\nschool graduation certificate; those with higher educational qualifications, such as college\nor university degrees; and those with other types of qualifications.\nExperience of racist victimisation covered three dimensions in both sites: being\nverbally insulted, threatened or harassed; being treated unfairly at work; or being refused\nemployment. In NSAL, the questions explored whether the respondent experienced verbal\ninsults or name calling and/or was threatened or harassed `in your day-to-day life almost\neveryday, at least once a week, a few times a month, a few times a year or less than once\na year?'. These variables were combined into one measure of whether the respondent had\nexperienced either form of insult more frequently than `less than once a year' and with\nthe respondent attributing this to his/her ancestry, race or skin colour in response to a\n816 James Nazroo, James Jackson et al.\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nfollow-up question. This coding was to allow comparability with the British data, which\nasked respondents `In the last twelve months, has anyone insulted you for reasons to do with\nyour ethnicity? By insulted I mean verbally abused, threatened or been a nuisance to you.'.\nTo determine experience of discrimination in employment, respondents to NSAL were\ntold: `In the following questions we are interested in the way other people have treated you\nor your beliefs about how other people have treated you. Can you tell me if any of the\nfollowing have ever happened to you? Have you ever been unfairly denied a promotion?'.\nAnd: `For unfair reasons, have you ever not been hired for a job?'. Again only those cases\nwhere the respondent attributed the behaviour to his/her ancestry, race or skin colour were\nincluded. In EMPIRIC, respondents were asked: `Have you yourself ever been treated\nunfairly at work with regard to promotion or a move to a better position for reasons which\nyou think were to do with race, colour or your religious or ethnic background? (I don't\nmean when applying for a new job.)'. And: `Have you ever been refused a job for reasons\nwhich you think were to do with your race, colour or your religious or ethnic background?'.\nAs this description of the questions used shows, there were some differences between the\nNSAL and HSE surveys in the approach to measurement and in the wording of particular\nitems, even if there was equivalence between data items at a conceptual level. This is\nparticularly striking for our main outcome measure, general health, where the wording of\nthe question and the outcome categories differs. Fortunately, the EMPIRIC survey\nincluded a version of the general health question that was very close to the NSAL version,\nallowing a direct comparison between the different versions of the questions. Analysis of\ndata from the HSE/EMPIRIC respondents who were asked both versions of the question\nshowed that in response to the HSE question 23 per cent of the white English and 32 per\ncent of the Caribbean English samples described their health as fair, bad or very bad\n(rather than very good or good), compared with 21 per cent and 31 per cent respectively\ndescribing their health as fair or poor (rather than excellent, very good or good) in\nresponse to the EMPIRIC question. This suggests that the problems with differences in\nwording for this item did not greatly affect the findings.\nOther issues relating to the equivalence of data items that are worth highlighting at this\npoint include: heart disease being covered by several specific questions in the HSE, and one\nbroad question in NSAL, which is likely to lead to the inclusion of more cases in the HSE\ndata; the use of country specific quintiles for household income; the merging of quite\ndifferent classifications for education level, reflecting differences in the education systems;\nand the collection of similar categories of exposure to racism and discrimination, but using\nquite different questioning techniques.\nFinally, the subjective nature of the general health measure might mean that it does not\nmap onto similar health constructs in the differing national and cultural contexts in which\nwe use it, either at the level of underlying health concept or in terms of thresholds behind\nresponse options (so the threshold between, for example, `fair' and `good' might vary); and\nthat the self-reports of diagnosed disease might vary across nations, because of institutional\nvariations in opportunities for diagnosis. In both cases, the implication would be that we\ncannot use these measures to draw comparisons across the countries and groups (including\nwithin countries) that we study. We return to these important issues when we consider\npossible limitations in the discussion section of the paper.\nStatistical methods\nAnalyses of the data involve both crosstabulations and multivariate analyses using logistic\nregression. For crosstabulations we compute means (for age) and distributions. For the\nmultivariate analyses we build stepwise logistic regression models to examine the contribution\nThe Black diaspora and health inequalities 817\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nof explanatory factors to ethnic differences in our dichotomised general health outcome.\nFirst, models are adjusted for age and gender, then explanatory variables are included in a\nseries of steps, so that their impact on the odds ratios associated with ethnicity can be\nshown. Respondents who are missing on variables included in one or more steps in the\nmodel are excluded from the whole model, with the exception of those missing only on the\nincome variable (who, as we describe above, have been included as an additional category).\nThe complex survey designs for NSAL, HSE and EMPIRIC meant that the samples\nhad to be weighted to correct for the unequal probabilities of selection for different classes\nof respondents. In addition, weights were applied to adjust for the non-response to the\nNSAL and EMPIRIC surveys. For EMPIRIC, these non-response weights were obtained\nusing regression modelling based on HSE data (available for both respondents and non-\nrespondents to the follow-up) (Sproston and Nazroo 2002). For NSAL, post-stratification\nweights were applied, adjusting the weighted distribution of the sample to conform to the\nknown distribution of the population for age, region, and gender within each ethnic group\n(Heeringa et al. 2004 and 2006). In addition all standard errors and confidence intervals\nwere corrected for auto-correlation within the stratified and clustered sample design. These\nanalyses were conducted using the survey commands within Stata.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the sample stratified by ethnicity. The English ethnic\ngroups are on average older than their US counterparts. On the whole, respondents,\nparticularly in the Caribbean English group, are more likely to be female, although this is\nnot the case for the Caribbean American group. The income distributions show marked\nethnic differences, with the white groups better off than others in both the US and England\n(though the advantage is greater in the US with 27 per cent in the top income quintile\ncompared with 23 per cent of white English respondents). The Caribbean American group\nhas an income profile that is very similar to that of the white English group and that is\nmarkedly better than that of the Caribbean English and Black American groups. These\ngroups have only 17 per cent and 13 per cent in the top income quintile respectively, in\ncomparison with 22 per cent for the Caribbean American group. Not surprisingly,\nthe employment measure shows a similar ethnic pattern to the income measure, with the\nCaribbean English and Black American groups disadvantaged compared with their white\ncounterparts. But the Caribbean American group have a higher proportion in the employment/\nstudent category than white Americans, and a higher proportion in the unemployed category,\nboth, perhaps, because of the smaller proportion in the retired category. The measure of\neducation level shows fewer ethnic differences, with the two Caribbean groups having a\nsimilar profile to their white counterparts. The Black American group, however, has a\npoorer profile than the other two US ethnic groups, with only 21 per cent in the post-high\nschool qualifications group compared with 30 per cent of Caribbean Americans and 36 per\ncent of white Americans. Interestingly, the differences between the US and English groups\nare also large.\nAll three measures of racism and discrimination show, not surprisingly, low levels for the\ntwo white groups. For the measure of racial insult, rates are very similar across the three\nBlack groups, with around 15 per cent of respondents reporting such an experience within\nthe last year. Being refused a job is experienced at a similar level by the Black American\n(15%) and Caribbean American (18%) groups, but by around 30 per cent of the Caribbean\nEnglish group. Likewise, being treated unfairly at work or denied promotion is reported at\n818 James Nazroo, James Jackson et al.\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\na higher rate by the Caribbean English group than the Caribbean American and Black\nAmerican groups.\nTable 2 shows differences in reported fair or bad/poor health and reports of diagnosis of\na range of cardiovascular diseases by ethnic group. As well as showing the prevalence of\nthese conditions (in percentages), the table also shows age and gender adjusted odds ratios\n(with 95% confidence intervals), to address differences in age profiles across the various\ngroups. For these analyses the white American group is used as the reference category. For\nreported fair or bad/poor health differences are large, both between the US and English\ngroups and when comparing ethnic groups within countries. Notably, the difference\nbetween the white and Caribbean English groups is much larger than that between the\nwhite and Caribbean American groups, and the Black American group seems to have\nTable 1 Social and economic factors by ethnicity\nPer cents (except for age)\nBlack\nAmerican\nCaribbean\nAmerican\nWhite\nAmerican\nWhite\nEnglish\nCaribbean\nEnglish\nGender\nEquivalised income\nEmployment status\nEducation level\nExperiences of racism/discrimination\nTreated unfairly at work or\ndenied promotion\nThe Black diaspora and health inequalities 819\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\npoorer health than the Caribbean (and white) American group. The pattern of findings is\nsimilar for any diagnosed condition, although the English groups do not always have\nhigher rates than their US counterparts. Indeed for all of the diagnosed conditions, differ-\nences between the US and English groups are smaller (hypertension and any diagnosed\ncondition), or reversed (diabetes and stroke). Diagnosed diabetes shows a similar pattern\nto that seen for any diagnosed condition and, apart from the US-England difference,\nreported fair or bad/poor health. Differences between groups within a country are small\nfor heart disease. All three Black groups have higher rates of hypertension than the white\ngroups, with the Black American group having particularly high rates. And for all groups\ndifferences are small for stroke.\nFigure 1 shows the prevalence of reporting fair or bad/poor health by ethnicity and age.\nThere are relatively small differences until age 35. From that age onwards the Caribbean\nEnglish group has an increasingly greater prevalence than the other groups, with the white\nEnglish and Black American groups also showing higher rates than the white American\nTable 2 Health outcomes by ethnicity\nBlack\nAmerican\nCaribbean\nAmerican\nWhite\nAmerican\nWhite\nEnglish\nCaribbean\nEnglish\nFair or bad/poor health\nAge/gender standardised\nodds ratio (95% C.I)*\nAny cardiovascular disease or diabetes\nAge/gender standardised\nodds ratio (95% C.I)*\nDiagnosed diabetes\nAge/gender standardised\nodds ratio (95% C.I)*\nDiagnosed heart disease\nAge/gender standardised\nodds ratio (95% C.I)*\nDiagnosed hypertension\nAge/gender standardised\nodds ratio (95% C.I)*\nDiagnosed stroke\nAge/gender standardised\nodds ratio (95% C.I)*\n*White American is the reference category\n820 James Nazroo, James Jackson et al.\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\ngroup from the age of 55 onwards. The Caribbean American group appear to have the\nlowest rates at ages 45\u00ad54, but then their rates rise to a similar level to other groups.\nOne possible explanation for the apparent differences between the Caribbean American\nand Caribbean English groups, shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1, is that they are a\nconsequence of differences in patterns of migration from the Caribbean to these two locations.\nDifferences in the timing of migration are explored in Table 3, which shows that the\nCaribbean American group were more likely than the Caribbean English group to be aged\n12 or older when they migrated and less likely to be born in their country of residence.2 It\nalso shows that of those who migrated, around 80 per cent of the English Caribbean group\nhad migrated before the 1970s, while over 80 per cent of the American Caribbean group\nTable 4 explores differences in the profiles of `migrant' and `second-generation'\nCaribbean people in the two locations. (The second generation is defined as either those\nwho were born in the US or England, or who migrated before the age of 12. The latter\ngroup were included because their numbers were too small to analyse separately (see Table 3)\nand, as most of their education had occurred in the host country, conceptually they fitted\nbetter in this group. Including them in the first generation group made little difference to\nthe findings.) It shows that in both locations the second generation are better off in terms of\nincome and education, although for employment the second generation are disadvantaged\nin the US and advantaged in England. Indeed, the second generation compare quite\nfavourably to the figures shown for their white counterparts in Table 1, with, for example,\na similar proportion in the top income quintile. It also shows that the second generation\nare more likely to report experiences of racism and discrimination in all but one case\n(unfair treatment at work for Caribbean English people).\nBeyond migration, the main factors considered here that may explain ethnic differences\nin health are those relating to economic and social inequalities, including experiences of\nracism and discrimination. Table 5 shows the relationship between general health and\nincome and experiencing verbal abuse. It shows that for each of the ethnic groups there is\na strong relationship with income, with the prevalence of self-reported fair or bad/poor\nhealth decreasing steadily with increasing income, and with those not reporting their\nFigure 1 Self-reported fair or bad/poor health by ethnicity and age\nThe Black diaspora and health inequalities 821\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nlevel of income generally having a high prevalence of fair or bad/poor health (the white\nAmerican group being the exception to this). Similarly, those who reported experiencing\nracist verbal abuse in the last 12 months had higher rates of fair or bad/poor health, with\nthe exception of the white groups (who had a low prevalence of exposure; so estimates\nare either based on small numbers \u00ad for the white English group \u00ad or cannot be calculated\n\u00ad for the white American group).\nTable 6 reports the multivariate (logistic regression) modelling of the relationship\nbetween general health and ethnicity, showing the odds of the various ethnic groups\ncompared with the white American group to report their health as fair or bad/poor; it also\nshows how these odds change as additional explanatory factors are entered into the model.\nTable 3 Age of and year of migration for Caribbean respondents\nColumn per cents\nCaribbean\nAmerican\nCaribbean\nEnglish\nAge on migration\nYear of migration (migrants only)\nTable 4 Social and economic factors by age on migration for Caribbean respondents\nCell per cents (except for age)\nCaribbean American Caribbean English\nBorn in US\nor migrated\nMigrated\nor older\nBorn in England\nor migrated\nMigrated\nor older\nNot employed or student\n(excluding retired)\nExperiences of racism/discrimination\nTreated unfairly at work\nor denied promotion\n822 James Nazroo, James Jackson et al.\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nAt the first step, with only age and gender included in the model, the Caribbean American\ngroup has an odds ratio of close to 1 for fair or bad/poor health, the odds for the Black\nAmerican group are higher (though note that the confidence intervals cross 1), the white\nEnglish group has a significantly higher odds of 1.4, and the odds for the Caribbean\nEnglish group are close to 2.5.

As expected from Table 6, the odds are significantly different (at 2.17).\nAdjustment for income and education reduces the odds somewhat (to 1.84), while\nadjustment for migrant status and year of migration (without adjustment for income and\neducation), leads to a slight reduction in odds (1.93). Finally, adjustment for all of income,\neducation, migrant status and year of migration brings the odds down to 1.57, although\nDiscussion\nThis paper has used independent, but similarly designed, surveys in England and the US\nto compare the health of five ethnic groups \u00ad Black American; Caribbean American; white\nAmerican; white English; and Caribbean English \u00ad with the intention of exploring how the\ncontext of migration and post-migration circumstances might influence health inequalities\nbetween Black and white groups. Our main health measure, self-assessed general health,\nrevealed a stark contrast between the situations in England and the US. The Caribbean English\ngroup have worse health than the white English group, while in the US the Caribbean\nAmerican group has a very similar health profile to the white American group. In addition,\nthere were marked differences in health between the groups in the US compared with those\nin England, with those in the US having better health than their English equivalents. Finally,\nthe Black American group had worse health than the white American group, although this\ndifference was not statistically significant. Although there were differences for the reports\nof diagnosed conditions, as would be expected for specific diseases and different healthcare\nsystems, findings for these were broadly the same as for self-assessed general health.\nThis pattern of findings for health was also found for markers of economic inequality,\nincluding income, employment and education. On the whole, the white groups were better\noff than the Black groups in both countries, but while the Caribbean English profile\nmatched that of the Black American profile (with the exception of level of education), the\nCaribbean American group was better off than their Black American and Caribbean English\ncounterparts (with a profile close to that of the white American group). An exploration of\nmigration effects revealed that the Caribbean American group were more likely than the\nCaribbean English group to be first generation, and to have migrated more recently.\nGeneration was shown to be strongly related to social and economic inequalities, with the\n`second' generation in both countries on the whole better off for economic markers, but\nmore likely to report exposure to racism and discrimination.\nNot surprisingly, markers of economic and social inequality \u00ad income and exposure to\nracial verbal abuse in the last 12 months \u00ad were strongly correlated with health for each\nethnic group. And multivariate analyses showed that differences in self-reported health\nbetween the white American and the other ethnic groups diminished greatly and became\nnon-significant when adjustments were made for economic inequalities and period of\nmigration/generation effects. Although exposure to racial verbal abuse was strongly and\nnegatively related to health, it did not make a large contribution to the observed ethnic\ninequalities in health, perhaps because of its relatively low prevalence (14\u00ad16% across the\nthree Black groups). Finally, in multivariate analysis comparing the two Caribbean groups,\nthe English disadvantage reduced from an odds ratio for fair/bad or poor health of 2.18 to\n(a still significant) 1.57 on adjustment for socioeconomic and migration effects.\nThe most striking finding \u00ad the differences in health between the two Caribbean groups\nand how this appears to be driven by economic and migration factors \u00ad indicates once\nThe Black diaspora and health inequalities 825\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nagain the need to take social context seriously when considering ethnic inequalities in\nhealth. When placed alongside the differences between the Caribbean American and Black\nAmerican groups, we are encouraged to place our understanding of social context within\na historical frame of reference. Not only should we avoid essentialising ethnic differences\nin health in terms of `innate' characteristics, we must also avoid an essentialist approach\nto ethnic inequalities in economic and social position. Ethnic inequalities should not be\nconsidered as somehow a product of processes internal to ethnic minority groups, but as\ngenerated by wider social (ethnic) relations that have developed differently in different\n(historical) contexts, which will change over time. So, rather than focusing on the\npsychological and biological mechanisms that link a pre-existing social inequality to health\ninequalities, we suggest a focus on the social and economic mechanisms that produce\nethnic inequalities and how these, and their outcomes, have varied. In the context of this\npaper, we can ask how social and economic forces have led to the relative advantage of one\nBlack group (Caribbean American) in comparison with one in the same location (Black\nAmerican), and one that migrated from the same geographical region to a different location\n(Caribbean English).\nIn answering such questions, comparative studies of migrant and post-migrant populations\ncan provide important evidence. Although migration issues have long been identified in\nwork on ethnic inequalities in health, the focus has very much remained on issues of health\nselection (the possibility that individuals are selected into a migrant group on the basis of\nhealth, or factors that relate to health, such as education) and the stresses and strains\nthat surround the migration process (Marmot et al. 1984). We would propose that when\nconsidering ethnic inequalities in health, migration needs to be considered in more fundamental\nways, such as:\n\u00b7 the social and economic forces that drive migration;\n\u00b7 selection of the population into migrant and non-migrant groups;\n\u00b7 the social and economic contexts into which migrants arrive;\n\u00b7 how these contexts develop over time and across generations, in part as a consequence\nof the actions of migrant populations.\nIt is easy to observe how these are different for the three Black groups studied here. Oliver\nand Shapiro (1995) demonstrate how the social and economic disadvantage of Black American\npeople is the outcome of a long history of institutional racism and discrimination that has\nits roots in slavery and has produced the levels of disadvantage that are currently observed.\nSimilarly, while the post-war migration of Caribbean people into Britain was driven by a\nshortage of labour, this process and the socioeconomic disadvantage faced by ethnic minority\nmigrants in England was, and continues to be, structured by racism that has its roots in\ncolonial history (Gilroy 1987, Miles 1982). The migration from the Caribbean to the US\nhappened later than that to England, into a different race relations context, and at a time\nwhen, perhaps, migrants were able to take advantage of the civil rights movement in a way\nthat the pre-existing Black population (and the population in England) was not (Butcher\nSuch observations show that social and economic circumstances will vary, in quite specific\nways, across these three groups and across time, and allow us to develop hypotheses\non how this may have led to the relative advantage of the Caribbean American group.\nAdditional data would be required to test likely hypotheses, but central to this must be\nan exploration of how the significance, or meaning, of a `Black' social identity has varied\nacross groups and over time and place. And it might well vary from first to second and\n826 James Nazroo, James Jackson et al.\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nthird generations. For example, the contemporary social and economic experiences of a\nmigrant and non-migrant generation might be quite different, with the non-migrant\ngeneration more likely to do well economically (Nazroo 2004, Platt 2005) \u00ad perhaps as a\nconsequence of different childhood experiences and consequent trajectories (Jackson and\nAntonucci 2006) \u00ad and to have less traditional ethnic identities (Nazroo and Karlsen 2003).\nIn addition, the arrival of a new migrant group into an existing race relations context may\nwell lead to a shift in the nature of that context.\nGiven the exploratory and opportunistic nature of the analysis conducted here \u00ad using\ntwo data sets that were not designed to be combined \u00ad there are inevitably some important\nlimitations with the analysis we have presented, but also some strengths. The most impor-\ntant limitations concern issues of measurement and the equivalence of data items in the US\nand English surveys. Although there was remarkable equivalence in terms of the coverage of\nconcepts and at the level of particular data items, there was limited semantic equivalence.\nAs shown in the methods section of the paper, many of the questions had different wording\nin the US and English studies. We were able to explore this in relation to the measure of\nhealth that was used, and this exploration indicated that semantic non-equivalence did not\nproduce a serious threat to the validity of our analysis. But we were unable to do this for\nthe other measures used.\nEqually important is the possibility that the different cultural frames of England and the\nUS influence responses to questions, such that apparently similar, or indeed identical,\nquestions may not have had identical meanings to respondents in the two locations. While\nthis is relevant to all our measures, most significant, as we pointed out in the measures\nsection of the paper, is the possibility that our health measures do not map onto similar\nconstructs in the US and England. An examination of differences between the US and\nEnglish findings shown in Table 2 lends support to this possibility, as do the findings of\nBanks and colleagues (2006a, 2006b), who show that the US population has better health\nthan the UK when assessed using a general health measure, but worse health for a range\nof cardiovascular diseases and biomarkers.3 For this paper, two points are worth making.\nFirst, in terms of relative comparisons of the situation within countries we show important\ndifferences between the three Black groups we study. The position of Caribbean people\ncompared with white people in the US (where they report similar levels of health) is\nremarkably different from that in England (where Caribbean people report worse health\nthan their white counterparts). The crucial issue here is not the absolute differences\nbetween countries, but the difference in the relative position of the two Caribbean groups\nwithin their countries, which, by definition, will not be influenced by differences in\ncontext between nations. Second, if the issue is one of differences in reporting thresholds\nbetween white and Caribbean people in the two countries, our analysis allows for a direct\ncomparison between Caribbean groups that also shows better health for Caribbean people\nin the US compared with those in the UK. In addition, Caribbean people in the US are\nnot only better off in terms of this self-report of health, they are also better off in terms of\nmore objective markers of socioeconomic position (such as income), lending support to the\nconclusions drawn in relation to health. And the health differences we show are largely\nexplained by our models, something we would not expect if the differences were simply a\nconsequence of reporting bias.\nAnother important limitation is that the white American group was only representative\nof those who live in areas where the density of the Black population is greater than 10 per\ncent. How this influences the findings reported here is not certain, but comparisons with\nother data sources suggest that the profile of the white American group in NSAL matches\nthat of white Americans generally. A final limitation is that our range of explanatory\nThe Black diaspora and health inequalities 827\nJournal compilation \u00a9 2007 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness/Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nvariables did not include all that might help us understand differences in the US-English\ncontext, such as neighbourhood effects, and differences in migration effects, such as early\nlife exposures. Despite these limitations, however, we have been able to use surveys with\nprobability samples, very similar conceptual orientations, and with similar coverage, to\ncarry out a novel comparison.\nConclusions\nThis paper illustrates marked differences between three Black populations in two locations\n(Caribbean English, Caribbean American and Black American), both in comparison with\neach other and with their white counterparts. The differences between these groups\nillustrate the significance of social and historical context when considering not only health\ninequalities, but also social and economic inequalities. The multivariate analyses reveal the\noverriding significance of economic effects for the ethnic inequalities in health that we\nobserve. With these data we cannot identify how far the economic differences between the\ntwo Caribbean populations are driven by differential selection into migrant groups,\nperhaps on the basis of human capital, or by differences in available opportunities in the\ndestination countries, or by a specific period effect, such as the opportunity provided by\nthe civil rights movement in the US. This is an important area on which to focus future\ninquiry, if we are concerned with the distal origins of ethnic inequalities in health and the\ndevelopment of upstream policies to address them.\nAddress for correspondence: James Nazroo, Sociology, School of Social Sciences, Arthur\nLewis Building, Oxford Road, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL\ne-mail: james.nazroo@manchester.ac.uk\n"
