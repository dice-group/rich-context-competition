Furthermore, they do not distinguish between\nwhether higher functional ability is due to an overall\nimproved functional ability that is already present at\nthe early stage, or due to improved functional recovery\nover time, or due to both. Thus, they have limited util-\nity for clinical applications which require ongoing\nactive assessment and monitoring of stroke patients.\nStroke recovery is a complex process in its nature,\nand individual functional recovery patterns differ\nacross subpopulations and time.13 Current practice\nmakes use of clinicians' expert judgments based on a\nnumber of factors at the onset such as age, stroke sever-\nity, consciousness, and stroke subtype. A recovery\ncurve predictive model could potentially provide an\nequivalent prognostic tool that could support deci-\nsion-making process at any time after stroke. Detailed\nlongitudinal data and methods may be more appropri-\nate to accurately capture stroke recovery with the aim\nof designing a tool that could assist in planning imme-\ndiate and midterm care for individual patients.14,15\nSeveral studies have hypothetically suggested that\nrecovery of body function and activities could be pre-\ndictable after stroke.14\u00ad16 In this study, we developed\nand validated a novel patient-specific predictive model\nof functional stroke recovery trajectories over time and\nevaluated its clinical utility.\nMaterials and methods\nCase ascertainment\nFour hundred and ninety-five patients from the\nongoing population-based South London Stroke\nRegister (SLSR) between the period August 2002 and\nOctober 2004 were included in the development cohort.\nOne hundred and forty-nine new patients registered\nin the validation cohort. The methods of the SLSR data\ncollection have been described previously in detail5,17\nand are summarized here. All patients with a first\never stroke after 1 January 1995 and residing in a\ndefined inner-city area of South London were eligible\nto be registered into the prospective, ongoing register.\nAccording to the 2011 Census this area (northern parts\ndistinctly multiethnic population with a large propor-\ntion of black Caribbean and African residents (25.3%).\nStroke was defined according to WHO definition of\nstroke.18 Case ascertainment was estimated as 88%\ncomplete by a multinominal-logit capture\u00adrecapture\nOutcome measure and prognostic indicators\nof functional recovery\nThe functional recovery was evaluated using Barthel\nIndex (BI)19 with total possible scores range from 0 to\n20, with lower scores indicating increased disability. BI\nwas measured at weeks one, two, three, four, six, eight,\npatients were followed for a mean duration of 28.5\nweeks and were measured on a mean of five occasions\n(range 1\u00ad9). Patients with fewer than two observations\n(n \u00bc 31) were excluded from the modeling procedure.\nThe external temporal cohort includes data of 1049\nnewly registered stroke patients between 2005 and\n2011 with Barthel measured at up to three time\npoints, one, 12, and 52 weeks. The final model was\nthe development cohort. All potential predictors of\nfunctional recovery were considered in the model vari-\nable selection, including demographics (age, sex, ethni-\ncity, premorbid disability, socioeconomic status),\nstroke characteristics (subtype based on the Oxford\nclassification (lacunar infarct (LACI), total anterior cir-\nculation infarcts (TACI), partial anterior circulation\ninfarcts (PACI), posterior circulation infarcts (POCI),\nand hemorrhagic stroke), presence of cerebellar symp-\ntoms, case-mix variables (Glasgow coma score (GCS),\nNIH stroke scale (NIHSS)).20 These predictors were\nscreened for practicality based on their clinical avail-\nability, ease of measurement, prevalence in academic\nliterature, and on biological reasoning, resulting in a\nset of candidate prognostic factors.\nModel development and validation\nPenalized mixed models21 were adapted to develop\nrecovery trajectories model which predicts the func-\ntional recovery for a patient with the selected prognos-\ntic factors. An additional inverse square root term of\ntime was included into the model as it significantly\nincreased the prediction of the recovery model.\nRepeated random subsampling cross-validation meth-\nods were used to select best competing models and\nInternational Journal of Stroke, 12(5)\nmodel parameter.22 Missing values were imputed using\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo methods.23 Leave-one-out\ncross-validation was used to assess the performance of\nthe developed prognostic recovery curve model. R2,\nabsolute mean error, and root-mean-square deviation\n(RMSD) were considered together to estimate the pre-\ndictive error in both, the development and the external\nvalidation cohorts. Patient age, sex, NIHSS, GCS\n(dichotomized: 15; or less than 15), stroke subtype\n(LACI, PACI, POCI, TACI, hemorrhage), and inter-\nactions between predictor variables and the inverse\nsquare root term of time in weeks were identified as\ngood independent predictors of recovery over time.\nThe resulting multivariable model of predicted BI is\ndescribed in the online material (Appendix 1).\nClinical utility\nWe plotted recovery curve trajectories to visually\ninspect different well-defined at-risk subgroups.\nAverage predicted recovery patterns were analyzed by\nage, stroke subtype, GCS, and NIHSS.16 To assess the\nprognostic effectiveness and clinical utility of predicted\nrecovery curves to identify different functional out-\ncomes at different time points, we dichotomized func-\ntional recovery using three thresholds (8, 12, and 17).\nThese thresholds correspond to poor outcome if BI < 8\n(representing complete dependence on others), good\noutcome if BI > 12 (transition from complete depend-\nence to assisted independence), and independence if\nBI > 17 (representing independence with minor assist-\nance as could be reasonably provided in a community\nsetting).24 We then evaluated the clinical utility at these\nthresholds of the predicted recovery curves to classify\ngood, poor, and independent outcome at both three\nand 12 months. These were evaluated in the external\ncohort using area under the receiver operator curves for\ndiscrimination and using calibration plot and Hosmer\u00ad\nLemeshow test for calibration.\nDecision curve analysis (DCA)25,26 method was per-\nformed in order to evaluate further the clinical useful-\nness of recovery curves in prognostication of poor\noutcome at both three and 12 months. DCA is a\nmethod to assess the added value of information pro-\nvided by a prognostic test across a range of a patient's\nrisks and benefits to facilitate clinical decisions, without\nthe need for actually measuring these for individual\npatients. The DCA is expressed graphically as a\ncurve, with the clinical net benefit on the vertical axis\nand probability thresholds on the horizontal axis.\nThe net benefit of prediction models was then evaluated\nby adding the benefits (true positives) and subtracting\nthe harms (false positives). The weight assigned to true\npositives and false positives was derived from the\nthreshold probability of the outcome. When the curve\nis at its highest over the range of probability thresholds,\nthe associated intervention would be the best decision.\nEthics\nPatients, or for patients with communication problems\ntheir relatives, gave written informed consent to\nparticipate in stroke-related studies within the SLSR.\nThe design was approved by the ethics committees of\nGuy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, Kings\nCollege Hospital, Queens Square, and Westminster\nHospitals (London).\nResults\n(24.4%) during the study. The study population con-\n(range 22\u00ad98 years). The external temporal validation\ncohort has similar characteristics (Table 1).\nThe predictive recovery curves showed an excellent\nfit and prediction. In the internal cross-validation, pre-\ndictive error RMSD over all time points was 3 BI\npoints, mean absolute error 2 BI points, and a R2 of\n77%. Predictive accuracy of the model was also good in\nthe external validation cohort with a RMSD of 2.83 BI\npoints, mean absolute error of 1.72 BI points, and a R2\nof 83%. Figure 1 presents the average predicted recov-\nery patterns with comparison to the average observed\nBI after stroke.\nAverage recovery was characterized by a steep\nincrease in BI over the first eight weeks followed by a\nmore gradual period of recovery reaching its apex at\naround 12 weeks. Depending on patient characteristics\nconsidered in the model, predictive curves showed\npeaks ranging from 8 to 32 weeks. Recovery was inver-\nsely associated with NIHSS and age, and had a positive\nassociation with GCS. Subtype had a variable influence\non recovery, with POCI and LACI showing the most\nimmediate ($8 weeks) recovery with the highest, and\nroughly equivalent, peaks. Hemorrhage and PACI\nshowed the next quickest and complete recovery, by\n12 weeks. TACI showed longer spontaneous neuro-\nlogical recovery, peaking at around 32 weeks and a\nmarked decline subsequently. Figure 2 presents recov-\nery patterns after stroke stratified by age group, stroke\nsubtype, GCS, and NIHSS.\nRecovery curve models were further evaluated to\ndefine a set of rules with appropriate sensitivity and\nspecificity to usefully identify patients with poor recov-\nery patterns.

The\nnegative predictive values of recovery curves were over\nsents predictive values and likelihood ratios for classify-\ning each functional outcome of interest.\nThe net benefit as a function of a threshold probabil-\nity of poor outcomes at three and 12 months was illu-\nstrated in Figure 4. The gray line was drawn to reflect\nthe strategy of ``assume all patients have poor out-\ncomes'' (i.e. recommend intervention for all), and the\nblack line was drawn to reflect the strategy of ``assume\nall patients would have good outcomes'' (i.e. do not\nrecommend any intervention). As expected, these two\nlines cross at the prevalence of poor outcome, 13% for\nthree months and 11% for 12 months.

In this case, strategies\naided by recovery curves prediction have no value.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we have developed and validated a\ndynamic patient-specific prognostic tool of functional\nrecovery poststroke in a population-based cohort. The\nproposed patient-centered model is the first that enables\nrecovery to be predicted using a continuous score,\nderived from a combination of individual patient char-\nacteristics, and makes available adjusted functional\nTable 1.

At predefined time points,\nthe accuracy of this model has been shown to be super-\nior compared to other exiting prediction models.9\u00ad12\nPatterns of functional recovery in a general unbiased\nstroke population demonstrate sharp improvements in\nthe first weeks after stroke and then plateau. Patients\nwith varying severity, different stroke subtype, and risk\nfactors experience different recovery courses that plat-\neaued at different levels and time. Although the general\npattern of recovery from stroke, including functional\nand neurological impairments, has already been dis-\ncussed and illustrated at population level in previous\nstudies,14,27 our proposed model is patient specific\nand has additionally provided the ability to predict\naccurately recovery trajectories up to one year post-\nstroke. This could be useful for early rehabilitation\nand discharge planning, by predicting whether a patient\nis likely to be dependent, require some assistance, or be\nindependent, at a certain time poststroke. To give a\npractical example, when considering functional\nrecovery shortly after admission, the predictive recov-\nery curves show similarities between hemorrhage and\nTACI stroke but large differences three months later;\nconversely, dissimilarities were observed between hem-\norrhage and PACI at the baseline but recovery after\nthree months was comparable. This could be explained\nby the different rate of recovery between stroke types\nand reconfirms that survivors of hemorrhagic stroke\nhave a greater chance for recovering function than\nthose who suffer ischemic stroke as suggested in previ-\nous studies.28 Another case that we have tested is when\npatients have different, or combinations of risk factors,\nclearly distinct trajectories with different recovery rates\ncan be expected and we can begin to predict poor func-\ntional outcomes. For instance, we have shown that\nchanges in recovery do not vary between different age\ngroups. There was a sharp initial increase in recovery\nwhich plateaued earlier in younger patients compared\nto older ones. But despite the slow recovery rate\nobserved in old patients, we would expect improvement\nFigure 3.

This\nwould suggest that specialized stroke rehabilitation\nmay be beneficial for all ages. It also confirms that\nolder patients may need longer rehabilitation and are\nless likely to be discharged earlier. Interestingly, the\nchange in recovery rate in severe stroke (poor GCS or\nNIHSS at onset) showed inverse relationship with\nrecovery. This suggests that apart from old age, factors\nsuch as onset stroke severity should also be taken into con-\nsideration when planning interventions and rehabilitation\nafter stroke. Therefore, this patient-specific recovery curve\npattern prediction could potentially inform tailored dis-\ncharge planning for stroke survivors including those with\n``hidden'' impairments that have not been recognized by\nthe medical team, for example in patients with communi-\ncation problems. It could also be used to provide early\nwarning of the development of stroke sequelae, such as\nmedical complications, poorly managed risk factors, or\ninadequate rehabilitation. Evidence from a recent system-\natic qualitative review29 showed that rehabilitation could\nbe improved by fostering patients' autonomy through\ngenuinely patient-centered care and more effective com-\nmunication and information. Recovery curve predictions\nmay playan important role not only to risks of poor recov-\nery identification, but also to inform a joint physician\u00ad\npatient decision making for effective delivery of preventive\nand therapeutic interventions.\nGenerally, subjects' stratification is often based on\none characteristic variable at a specific time point, such\nas stroke severity at the onset of stroke, which may\nTable 2.

We have\nshown that using a dynamic (time-dependent) multi-\nvariate patient-specific predictive model, we can make\nindividual recovery profiles and accurately classify\nfuture risks of outcomes. By maintaining this accuracy\nin differing patient populations, we believe that the\nrecovery curve model is sufficiently robust and DCAs\nsuggest it may be used clinically.\nAlthough the general pattern of recovery from stroke,\nincluding functional and neurological impairments, has\nalready been discussed and illustrated in previous stu-\ndies,14,27 our proposed model has additionally provided\nthe ability to predict at any time the recovery of individ-\nuals up to one year poststroke. These patient-specific\nrecovery curves predictions could allow more insight\ninto both spontaneous and directed neurological recovery\nafter stroke. Practically, this could offer the potential to\nuse recovery curves to chart an individual's recovery and\nidentify when and why there is significant variance from\nthe normal population curve in much the same way as\nnormal growth curves are used to monitor the develop-\nment of children. This prognostic information is import-\nant for clinicians, stroke survivors, and their carers.\nIn clinical research, this could also be applied as an\naid in assessing the beneficial effects of evidence-based\ninterventions and care settings. As a research tool, this\ncould be used to test novel interventions or to identify\nenriched samples, reducing the reliance on the need for\nexpensive and often impractical randomized controlled\ntrials. This predictive enrichment strategy is of import-\nance for designing future trials as it enables the enroll-\nment of the most suitable patients thereby permitting\nthe use of a smaller study population. Another poten-\ntial application could be to derive a set of preliminary\ncost weights on resource uses which could help to build\npersonalized patient care and funding models.\nA key strength of the current study is that the models\nwere built and externally validated using a prospective\nunbiased population-based cohort of first ever strokes.\nThis is preferable over a hospital-based population,\nwhich may result in case-mix-specific models, or over\naggregate data from clinical trials, which usually repre-\nsent selected patients, and thus nonrepresentative popu-\nlations. Notwithstanding, the study could be\nstrengthened further if the model were to be validated\nin a completely independent holdout population in dif-\nferent poststroke care setting, preferably from another\ncountry. A limitation of this study is the effectiveness\nand usefulness of recovery curves as a low-cost predic-\ntive-based intervention still needs to be confirmed. An\nimpact study needs to be conducted in a randomized\ncontrol trial (RCT) setting to confirm whether being\nable to predict recovery and the resulting intervention\ncould make a difference to the patient. Nevertheless, the\ncurrent pilot study has now allowed us to recognize\nhow recovery curves could be implemented and\nplanned for use in stroke care. Estimates and variations\nfrom this study will serve to inform the design of the\nRCT study on how recovery curves and its software as\na management tool could improve functional recovery.\nConclusion\nPrognostic risk classification based on recovery curves\ncan be clinically useful. This tool makes prognostic\ninformation available which could support the develop-\nment of more tailored management and assist the\nimplementation of more effective care models.\nRecovery curves tool could provide a useful framework\nfor clinical and public health practice.\n"
