Referents had never smoked\na total of 100 cigarettes. Relative risks\nwere estimated with Stata software's Cox\nproportional hazard regressions, using\nNHIS final weights and primary sampling\nunits. The resulting RR and published\ndata were used to estimate population\nsmoking attributable fractions of injury\ndeaths in the United States.\nResults--The crude, age-race-gender ad-\njusted, and fully (demographic plus edu-\ncational attainment, marital status,\nalcohol use level, and seat belt use)\nadjusted RRs for injury death in smokers\ncorrespond to United States injury death\nsmoking attributable fractions of 18%,\n13%, and 9%, respectively. Those smoker/\ninjury death RRs each showed a signifi-\ncant dose response relationship (p<0.030).\nSmokers' unadjusted unintentional in-\njury, motor vehicle crash, and suicide RRs\ntively.\nConclusions--Smokers in the United\nStates have significant dose-response ex-\ncesses of injury death, independent of age,\nrace, gender, alcohol use, seat belt use,\neducation, and marital status. This sup-\nports earlier studies suggesting that\nsmoking may be a leading contributor to\ninjuries and injury may be a leading\nburden from smoking, both nationally and\nglobally.\n",

Smoking causes\nrisk factors for injury including fires, depressed\nreflexes, incoordination, impaired fitness, and,\npossibly, depressed moods.2\u00ad4 Smoking is dis-\nproportionately common, and associated with\nhigh injury risks in narcotics addicts.5 Addicts\nmay have been disproportionately omitted\nfrom the employment or volunteer based\npopulations in whom smoking related injury\nrisks have previously been assessed.\nStudies of smoking related injury risks lack\n1990's data, nationally representative samples,\nand adjustment for risk taking behaviors such\nas non-use of seat belts.2 3 Therefore, we will\nassess the prospective association between\nsmoking and injury death in the 1990s in a\nnationally representative sample of Americans,\nwithout and with adjustment for demographic\nfactors and behavioral risk factors.\nMethods\nUnited States National Health Interview Sur-\nvey (NHIS) adult (ages 18+) interviewees from\nthrough 1995 using the National Death Index\n(NDI).6 The NHIS, NDI, and linkage methods\nhave been described in previous studies.7 8 This\nprovided an average of five years of virtually\ncomplete9 follow up on a nationally representa-\ntive cohort of Americans. The lack of seat belt\nand alcohol use data precluded use of NHIS\nParticipants were classified as never smokers\n(fewer than 100 lifetime cigarettes), ex-\nsmokers, and current smokers (smokers), by\nbaseline self report.

Assuming the\nhomeless and housed have the same crude and\nadjusted injury mortality RR, the smoking\nattributable fractions of homeless injury\nTable 2 shows a crude increased risk of death\namong smokers for unintentional injury, motor\nvehicle crashes (crashes), and suicide. In the\nfully adjusted analysis smoker RRs of uninten-\ntional injury, crash, and suicide were 1.56 (CI\nDiscussion\nWe find that in the early 1990s, smokers in the\nUnited States had dose-response excesses of\ninjury death, independent of smokers' excesses\nof divorce and heavy alcohol use and deficits of\neducation and seat belt use. Smokers also had\nsignificantly raised unadjusted RRs of fatal\nunintentional injury, crash, and suicide, though\nthe adjusted RR were not statistically signifi-\ncant due to low numbers of cases studied, due\nto lack of association, or confounding. These\nassociations are consistent with published sug-\ntween smoking and injury, unintentional in-\njury, and suicide death seen in randomized trial\nIn this national sample, smokers' risks of\ninjury death are similar to the relatively high\nRRs seen in Norwegian or Swedish general\nmodestly higher than smokers' injury, suicide,\nor violence death RR seen in socioeconomi-\ncally advantaged populations such as the\nUnited States Cancer Prevention Study-I\n(CPS-I) volunteers,17 British physicians, nurses\nin the United States, or Northern California\nKaiser Permanente health examinees.2 It seems\npossible that smoking confers a higher injury\ndeath RR in poor or addicted5 people included\nin general population samples. The NHIS may\nunderestimate the United States smoking/\ninjury RR since the NHIS is based on\nhouseholds and thus omits homeless people\nwho may be very prone to smoking and\ninjury.18 19 Correctly estimating national and\nglobal RR of injury caused by smoking is\nimportant since each 0.25 added to the global\nsmoking attributable injury RR, means an\nadditional about 1% of the global burden of\ndisease is due to smoking.2\nThis study has strengths. Inference from this\nstudy is strengthened by the multiple demo-\ngraphic and behavioral factors we adjusted for,\nand the recent data representative of house-\nholds of a large and diverse nation.\nThis study has weaknesses. A modest\nnumber of injury deaths, and even lower num-\nbers of suicide, unintentional, and homicide\ndeaths were available for study. Our methods\nmay substantially overestimate smoking's real\ninjury risks due to our lack of adjustment for\ndrug use, biochemically determined alcohol\nuse, binge or similarly risky patterns of alcohol\nuse, personality, and other possible explana-\ntions for the smoking/injury association. How-\never previously reviewed forensic,20 rand-\nomized trial, challenge-rechallenge, animal,\nand some cohort and cotwin control evidence\nsuggests a smoking/injury association is likely\nto exist, independent of those factors.2 3 21\nAlternatively, we may have substantially\nunderestimated United States smoking attrib-\nutable injury risks. That could result from\nomitting the homeless from our sample, count-\ning baseline smokers who quit during follow up\nas smokers; adjusting for divorce and possible\neVects of nicotine addiction, and ignoring\nsmoking's roles in fires,22 massive explosions,23\ncrashes,24 and other threats to bystander never\nsmokers. Given the high levels of substance\nabuse seen in the homeless,25 their smoking\ninjury death RR could be over 2.5, as was seen\nin substance addicts.5\nAdditional research is merited. The various\nsmoking/injury associations should be assessed\nin other nations, especially from Asia, Latin\nAmerica, and Africa, at other stages of the\ntobacco epidemic. The smoking/injury associ-\nation may be assessed in the homeless and then\nincluded in national estimates of smoking/\ninjury associations. The role of smoking's fires,\ncrashes, and stressors (illnesses from second-\nhand smoke and smoking attributable bereave-\nments) in injuries in never smokers may be\nassessed. Smoking involved crashes may be\nstudied in the same manner as alcohol involved\ncrashes.26 The contributions of smoking or\nnicotine addiction to behavioral risk factors for\ninjury such as alcohol use,27 drug use,5 28 social\nisolation,29 and inability to advance in school30\nmay be assessed. This would help assess\nwhether it is appropriate to adjust the smoking/\ninjury association for such possible eVects of\ntobacco use.\nImplications for prevention\nIn summary, there is a very substantial risk that\nsmoking is contributing to many injuries and\nresulting costs in the United States and\nglobally. Taxes, cigarette pack graphic warn-\nings,31 and other methods of reducing smoking\nmay be highly cost eVective32 or possibly cost\nsaving20 33 ways of reducing injury. Further\nstudies and warnings of smoking's injury risks\nare merited. Smokers, physicians, policy mak-\ners, taxpayers, and non-smoking bystanders\nmay benefit from warnings about the risks of\ninjury associated with smoking.\nWe wish to thank the editor and three anonymous reviewers for\nhelpful comments.
