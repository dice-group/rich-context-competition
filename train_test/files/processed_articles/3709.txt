Understanding\nthese genetic influences may lead to better prevention of\nand intervention in stroke.\nAdiponectin, an adipose tissue-specific plasma pro-\ntein, is structurally homologous to collagens VIII and X\nand complement factor C1q3 and plays an important\nrole in regulating energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid\nmetabolism, and anti-inflammatory responses in the\nvascular system.4\u00ad6 Low plasma concentrations of adi-\nponectin have been associated with myocardial\ninfarction7 and ischemic stroke.8 Recent evidence has\nimplicated the genetic polymorphism of the adiponectin\ngene (ADIPOQ) in association with risk of coronary\nheart disease and ischemic stroke.9\u00ad20 Three single-\nAdiponectin gene polymorphisms\ncontributes to ischemic stroke risk:\nA meta-analysis\nDingzhu Shen, Sanli Xing and Chuan Chen\n Keywords\nMeta-analysis, ischemic stroke, adiponectin\nShanghai Geriatric Institute of Chinese Medicine, Longhua Hospital\nAffiliated Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, P.R.\nChina.\nD.S. and S.X. are co-first authors and contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding author:\nDingzhu Shen and Chuan Chen, Shanghai Geriatric Institute of Chinese\nMedicine, Longhua Hospital Affiliated Shanghai University of Traditional\nChinese Medicine, Building C, No 365 Xiangyang South Road, Xuhui\nOriginal Article\nthese studies. However, the conclusions of these studies\nwere inconsistent. Leu et al.18 did not find any associa-\ntion between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and ischemic\nstroke. But Liu et al.19 found a positive association of\nADIPOQ polymorphisms with ischemic stroke. In their\nstudies, compared with CC genotype, GG genotype of\nAfter adjustment for potential risk factors by multivari-\nischemic stroke risk and with plasma levels of high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and adiponectin\nin this German population.\nSince the relatively small sample size of a single study\nmay not have enough power to detect slight effects of\nADIPOQ on stroke, meta-analysis may provide more cred-\nible evidence by systematically summarizing existing\ndata. In this study, we have extensively reviewed the litera-\nture and performed a meta-analysis based on all eligible\ncase-control published data to evaluate the association\nbetween ADIPOQ genetic polymorphisms and stroke\nsusceptibility.\nMaterials and methods\nLiterature search and selection\nWe carried out a publication search in PubMed,\nEMBASE, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Wiley\nOnline Library, Wanfang database in China, and Chinese\nNational Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases\nwith the following search terms: (\"ADIPOQ\" or \"adi-\nponectin\") and (\"stroke\" or \"brain infarction\" or \"cere-\nbrovascular disease\") and (\"SNP\" or \"polymorphism\" or\n\"mutation\") by two independent investigators.\nPublication language was not restricted in our search.\nAbstracts, reviews or editorials were not included. The\nreferences of all identified publications were searched\nfor any additional studies, and the related articles option\nwas used to search for further potentially relevant arti-\ncles. The following criteria have to be meet by the\nincluded studies. 1)the study must be case-control study;\n2) the ischemic stroke diagnosis must confirmed by\ncomputed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI); 3) reported the relation between\nADIPOQ polymorphism and ischemic stroke and 4) suf-\nficient data for examining an OR and 95%CI. If a study\nin line with 1) patients were under 18 years of age, or 2)\noriginal genotype data were not provided must be\nexcluded from the meta-analysis.\nData extraction\nThe data extraction was performed by two independent\ninvestigators (DZS and SLX). The first author's last name,\nthe publication year, country, the genotype data of cases\nand controls, and the methods for genotyping for each\nstudy were collected.\nStatistical analysis\nWe recalculated the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)\nby 2 test. The OR value of each polymorphism and its\n95%CI were calculated to measure the strength of the\ngenetic association. Meta-analysis was performed by\nusing RevMan 5.0 software provided by the Cochrane\nCollaboration. We directly used Q-test and I2 test to exam-\nine the heterogeneity between each study. By heterogene-\nity test, if p > 0.05, we select the fixed-effects model, and\nif p < 0.05, we selected the random-effects model to merge\nOR. Analysis of sensitivity includes the difference of\npoint estimation and CIs of the combined effects value at\na different model, to observe whether it changes the result.\nTo test the publication bias, we used the RevMan 5.0 sta-\ntistical software to make the funnel plot. Each SNP was\ntested for associations with stroke susceptibility based on\ndifferent genetic models. To contrast the wild-type\nhomozygote, we first estimated the risk of the rare allele\nhomozygote and heterozygous genotypes on stroke, then\nevaluated the risk of stroke under a dominant model and a\nrecessive model. The statistical significance of the pooled\nOR was determined with the Z test, and a p value of <0.05\nwas considered significant.\nResults\nLiterature search\nAs shown in Figure 1, 213 literatures were searched firstly. Of\nthese, we excluded 198 studies for significant irrelevance to\nour study aim. We reviewed the full texts of fifteen studies and\nfurther excluded 8 literatures because of overlapping cases or\ntheir data were not extractable or having no control popula-\ntion. Finally, a total of seven articles met the criteria and were\nStudy characteristics\nAs shown in Table 1, we summarized the characteristics of\nincluded studies.

Results of the meta-analysis are shown in Figures\n2\u00ad4. Q-test in all of the genetic models showed no signifi-\ncant heterogeneity. Therefore, fixed-effects model was\nused to analysis the association.

For the sensitivity analysis,\nwe deleted one single study from the overall pooled analy-\nsis each time to check the influence of the removed data set\nto the overall ORs. The pooled ORs and 95% CIs were not\nsignificantly altered when any part of the study was omit-\nted, which indicated that any single study had little impact\non the overall ORs.\nPublication bias\nFunnel plot and Egger's test were performed to assess the\npublication bias of the literature. Symmetrical funnel plots\nwere obtained in the SNPs tested in all of the models.\nEgger's test further confirmed the absence of publication\nbias in this meta-analysis (p > 0.05) (Figure 5).\nDiscussion\nIn this meta-analysis, an association between the three\npooled results from eight published studies. The results\nincreased risk for developing ischemic stroke, and that\nated with stroke.\nFigure 1.

Genotypes in all studies\nwere detected with genetic DNAfrom blood samples using a\ntotal of three genotyping methods.All of the studies checked\ngenotypes for quality control. Genotype distribution of con-\ntrols in all studies was consistent with HWE. By the meta-\nanalysis, our results did support a genetic association\nExploring heterogeneity is one of the important goals of\nmeta-analysis. In the present study no significant heteroge-\nneity was found among the included studies. Sensitivity\nanalysis also showed that omission of any single study did\nnot have a significant impact on the combined ORs.\nFurthermore, funnel plot did not reflect obvious asymme-\ntry, and Egger's test further indicated no considerable pub-\nlication bias in this meta-analysis. This made the results of\nthis meta-study more reliable to some extent.\nBe that as it may, there remained some limitations in\nthis meta-analysis. In the studies included, the genotyping\nmethods used were not the same. In addition, other clinical\nfactors such as age, sex and different chemotherapies in\neach study might lead to bias.
