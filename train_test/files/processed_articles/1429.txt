Residential exposures,\nincluding indoor allergens, have consistently been\nshown to be risk factors for the development or\nexacerbation of asthma.4\u00ad20 Studies that have impli-\ncated certain risk factors for asthma, however, are\noften limited by small sample size or a restricted\nfocus on a specific age group, geographic distribu-\ntive contribution of specific allergens or other resi-\ndential exposures to asthma for children and\nadolescents in the United States is poorly defined.\nMoreover, there has not been any attempt to estimate\nthe overall contribution of indoor allergens or resi-\ndential exposures to asthma. To develop a national\nstrategy to prevent childhood asthma, it is critical to\nestimate the contribution of specific risk factors and\nthe overall contribution of residential exposures to\nasthma.\nIn a previous analysis, we estimated that residen-\ntial exposures--including pets in the household, al-\nlergy to a pet, exposure to environmental tobacco\nsmoke, and use of gas stove or oven for heat--ac-\ndiagnosed asthma in children 6 years old.20 Risk\nfactors for asthma in early childhood, however, are\noften distinct from those that predict asthma in later\nchildhood and adolescence.6,9 Moreover, skin testing\nwas not conducted among children younger than 6\nyears old in the National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey (NHANES) III, so we could not\nassess immediate hypersensitivity in the younger\nchildren.\nThe objective of this study was to estimate the\nrelative contributions, population-attributable risks,\nand costs of residential risk factors, including indoor\nallergens, for doctor-diagnosed asthma among a rep-\nresentative sample of persons 6 to 16 years old in the\nUnited States.\nMETHODS\ndata for this study. NHANES III was a cross-sectional, household\nsurvey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that used a\ncomplex, multistage probability-sampling design.\nThe primary dependent variable in this analysis was doctor-\ndiagnosed asthma. The definition of asthma used in this study was\nbased on parent report, as determined by a positive response to\nthe survey question, \"Were you ever told by a doctor that your\nchild had asthma?\"\nFrom the *Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio; Depart-\nment of Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester,\nNew York; and \u00a7Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio.\nReprint requests to (B.P.L.)

We focused on modifiable factors that could be\ninvestigated by using NHANES III. These included housing fea-\ntures, such as age of residence, urban or nonurban setting, cotinine\nand reported exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, presence\nof pets, given up or avoided a pet because of allergies, type of\nheating and heating fuel, and use of a gas stove or oven for\nImmediate hypersensitivity to standardized indoor allergens\n(cat, dust mite, and German cockroach) was measured by skin test,\nusing the prick-puncture technique. Standardized outdoor aller-\ngens (Bermuda grass, perennial rye, short ragweed, white oak,\nRussian thistle, and Alternaria alternata) were also measured by\nskin test. We included all indoor allergens and Alternaria in this\nanalysis. The flare and wheal areas were delineated with a mark-\ning pen 15 minutes after the skin was punctured and the allergens\nwere applied. Allergen mean wheal diameter was calculated as\nthe longest diameter of the reaction. We considered a skin test to\nbe valid if the wheal from the positive control (histamine) was at\nleast 1 mm larger than that of the negative control wheal.21 A skin\ntest response was considered positive if the panel was valid and if\nthe mean wheal diameter of the allergen test was at least 2 mm\nlarger than that of the negative control wheal.21\nWe were primarily interested in environmental risk factors, but\nwe included host and demographic variables to adjust for possible\nconfounding. These variables include child's age, gender, race,\nand history of allergic rhinitis or hay fever. Measures of socioeco-\nnomic status, such as poverty income ratio and educational\nachievement of the head of household, were also included in the\nanalyses. Finally, we used parental history of atopy (defined as\nhistory of asthma or allergic rhinitis) as a measure of genetic\npredisposition to asthma.\nBivariate analyses were conducted to determine associations\nwith asthma. Variables found to be associated with asthma based\non 2 and Student's t tests (P  .20) were included in logistic\nregression analyses. Variables were also included if previous stud-\nies consistently indicated that they were risk factors for childhood\nasthma, including gender, race, age, urban residence, region of\ncountry, poverty income ratio, and education level of the head of\nhousehold. Poverty income ratio was computed as a total house-\nhold income divided by the poverty threshold for the year of the\ninterview.22 Logistic regression analysis was conducted with\nSUDAAN software to account for the complex, multistaged sam-\npling design of the survey.23 Because asthma was present in 10%\nof the sample population, the odds ratio (OR) was modified to\nbetter represent the relative risk.24 Sample weights were used to\nproduce national estimates by adjusting for the oversampling of\nyoung children and minority groups.\nPopulation-attributable risk was calculated for factors indepen-\ndently associated with asthma. Population-attributable risk esti-\nmates were derived using Levin's formula:\nPopulation-attributable risk %\n\nprevalence  (relative risk  1)\n(prevalence  [relative risk  1]  1)\nwhere prevalence is the prevalence of the risk factor in the pop-\nulation and relative risk is estimated using the observed OR.25\nPopulation-attributable risk was calculated for each predictor\nvariable and separately for children having 1 identified residen-\ntial exposure.\nWe used published data on the economic cost of asthma to\nestimate the cost attributable to residential factors.26 Direct costs\nincluded clinic and emergency department visits, hospital outpa-\ntient services, hospitalization, and medications. Indirect costs in-\ncluded loss of work because of school absence and illness days.\nWe presented costs inflated to 1997 dollars using inflation factors\nfor each direct and indirect cost category.27 Because there was no\nsignificant difference in health service use for children who had\nasthma associated with a residential exposure compared with\nthose who did not have a residential exposure, we assumed that\nhealth service use was similar for the 2 groups. The cost of resi-\ndential asthma was the product of the fraction of cases attributable\nto residential exposures and the total cost.\nRESULTS\nhad doctor-diagnosed asthma (Table 1). This trans-\nlates to 4.6 million children or adolescents in the\nUnited States with a history of doctor-diagnosed\nasthma.\nWe identified several residential exposures associ-\nated with childhood asthma after adjusting for po-\ntential confounders in a logistic regression analysis\n(Table 2).

Skin test sensitization\nto cat allergen did not reach statistical significance as\na risk factor for asthma when the 2 variables for pets\nwere removed from the model. Because there was\nnot an ideal variable for inner-city residence, we\nexplored various interactions of poverty income ratio\nby urban residence, but these interactions did not\nachieve statistical significance.

Forty percent of children with a residential\nrisk factor had 1 emergency department visit or\nclinic visit for wheezing in the past 12 months, com-\npared with 32.9% for children without a recognized\nresidential risk factor (P  .34). We assumed that the\ncosts of asthma attributable to residential exposures\nwere proportional to the attributable risk fraction\nbecause there were no differences in health services\nuse for children with or without an identified resi-\ndential exposure.\nNext, we calculated the direct and indirect costs of\nasthma attributable to residential risk factors. Based\non a population-attributable risk of 44.4%, we esti-\nmate that the total cost of asthma attributable to\nresidential risk factors was $405 million (95% CI:\ndren and adolescents 6 to 16 years old. If we include\nthe costs of asthma for children 6 years old,20 the\ntotal cost of asthma attributable to residential risk\nfactors increases to $807 million annually.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of these analyses indicate that elimi-\nnating exposures to indoor allergens and pets, if they\nare indeed causal, could prevent over 2 million\n(44.4%) of the 4.6 million cases of doctor-diagnosed\nasthma among persons 6 to 16 years old in the\nUnited States. The effect of eliminating these risk\nfactors would, therefore, have a profound impact on\nhospitalization rates, emergency and clinic visits,\ncosts, school absences, and health and functioning of\nchildren and adolescents.28\nHaving a household pet or an allergy to a pet\n(defined as \"given up or avoided a pet because of\nallergies\") were major risk factors for doctor-diag-\nnosed asthma. Pet allergens are risk factors for asth-\nsurveys conducted in Europe and the United States,\nthis present analysis indicates that exposure or aller-\ngic reactions to pets were the predominant risk factor\nThese variables may overestimate the risk of asthma\nfrom pet exposure, however, because the temporal\nrelationship of these exposures with the onset of\nasthma was unknown.33\nImmediate hypersensitivity to dust mite and cock-\nroach allergens was a major risk factor for doctor-\ndiagnosed asthma. Numerous studies indicate that\nimmediate hypersensitivity to indoor allergens is a\nrisk factor for asthma, but the specific allergen(s)\nimplicated is often dependent on geography, urban\nings from a nationally representative survey indicate\nthat sensitization to dust mite accounted for\nSensitization to cat allergen was not a predictor for\nasthma. There are at least 2 reasons for this conflict-\ning finding. First, families with a history of asthma or\nother allergic conditions may selectively avoid cats.33\nSecond, the variable \"avoid or have allergies to pets\"\nmay be a marker for sensitization to cat allergen, but\nwe were not able to distinguish between allergic\nreactions to cats and dogs for \"avoiding or having\nallergies to pets.\"\nImmediate hypersensitivity to indoor allergens is\nconsidered to be causally associated with asthma\nexacerbations. The Institute of Medicine concluded\nthat there is sufficient evidence of a causal relation\nbetween exposure to allergens produced by house\ndust mites, cockroaches and cats, and exacerbations\nof asthma in sensitized individuals.34 They also con-\ncluded that there is sufficient evidence of an associ-\nation between exposure to dog allergens and exacer-\nbations of asthma in sensitized individuals.34 Still, it\nis not entirely certain that eliminating exposure to\nindoor allergens will prevent the development of\nasthma.\nExposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a po-\nIn contrast, we found no association of exposure to\nenvironmental tobacco smoke with asthma in older\nchildren and adolescents.

All\nORs and attributable risks are adjusted for variables shown in Table 2.\nmay either represent problems with the measure-\nment of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke or\na lack of any association of environmental tobacco\nsmoke and asthma in older children.\nHost factors associated with asthma included his-\ntory of allergic rhinitis in the index child and family\nhistory of atopy. Allergic rhinitis, as measured by a\nhistory of hay fever or nasal eosinophilia, is a risk\nfactor for the subsequent development of asth-\nma.18,35 Still, it is difficult to disentangle the diagno-\nsis of allergic rhinitis as a risk factor for asthma or the\nresult of environmental exposure that predisposes to\nboth allergic rhinitis and asthma. Similarly, family\nhistory of atopy may represent shared genes or com-\nmon environmental exposures that predispose to\nasthma. If susceptible children develop asthma only\nif they are exposed to allergens, then our estimates of\nthe population-attributable risk for such exposures\nare low.\nBlack race was not a risk factor for asthma in this\nanalysis. Some researchers found that black race was\na risk factor for a higher prevalence of asthma,3,20,36\nwhereas others reported that it was not a risk fac-\ntor.37,38 There are numerous potential confounders to\nexplain these discrepant findings, such as access to\nhealth services and urban status that were not ade-\nquately measured in this survey.37 Additional re-\nsearch to address this complex question is war-\nranted.\nCONCLUSION\nThese results indicate that residential risk factors\naccount for 44.4% of doctor-diagnosed asthma\namong older children and adolescents. Taken to-\ngether, these and other data clearly show that asthma\nin childhood is inextricably linked with residential\nexposures. The elimination of residential risk factors,\nif causally associated with asthma, would have a\nprofound effect on medical costs of asthma and,\nmore importantly, on the health of children.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was funded by the US Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (Healthy Home Initiative) and by the Insti-\nResources and Services Administration, Public Health Service,\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\nREFERENCES\n1.
