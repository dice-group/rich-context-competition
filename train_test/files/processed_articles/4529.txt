As tobacco and alcohol are more\nharmful to women than to men, this is an alarming trend. As men are generally more short-term oriented in their sexuality than\nwomen, and given that cigarette and alcohol use are still considered masculine behaviors, we explored if female smoking and\ndrinking can function as a short-term mating strategy. By means of a between-subjects experiment (N \u00bc 218), men's perceptions\nof female smoking and drinking were studied. The experiment showed that young men perceive women who use cigarettes and\nalcohol as being more sexually unrestricted. Furthermore, tobacco and (especially) alcohol use brought some short-term\nattractiveness benefits to women. In short-term mating contexts, drinking enhanced women's attractiveness, whereas occa-\nsional smoking was found equally desirable as not smoking. However, in long-term mating contexts, frequent drinking and all\nsmoking behavior harmed women's desirability. A follow-up study (N \u00bc 202) confirmed men's perceptions, showing that female\nusers of tobacco and alcohol are indeed more short-term oriented in their sexuality. Overall, results indicate that female smoking\nand drinking can operate as a short-term mating strategy.\n",

Women,\non the other hand, are generally more long-term oriented and\nrestricted. However, both the sexual strategies theory (Buss &\nSchmitt, 1993) and the strategic pluralism model (Gangestad &\nSimpson, 2000) point out that men and women follow both\nmating strategies depending on environmental circumstances\n(e.g., harshness, uncertainty) and personal characteristics (e.g.,\nattractiveness).\nAs women are generally more sexually restricted than men\n(Schmitt, 2005), they are often demanding of a costly courtship\nbefore consenting to sexual encounters. Therefore, to avoid\nhigh mating efforts, cues of sexual availability in women are\nbeneficial for men following a short-term mating strategy.\nAccordingly, women engage in behaviors to signal their\nshort-term mating orientation (STMO) to men (Buss &\nSchmitt, 1993; Regan, Levin, Sprecher, Christopher, & Cate,\n2000). Research suggests that women often use signaling stra-\ntegies analogous to men, to indicate that they are also more\nmanlike and unrestricted in their sexual strategy (Sylwester &\nMale Short-Term Mating\nSeveral studies indicate that physical risk-taking is used by\nmen in short-term mating situations. Not only does the prox-\nimity of attractive women stimulate physically risky behavior\n(Frankenhuis, Dotsch, Karremans, & Wigboldus, 2010; Paw-\nical risk-taking is also found most attractive in short-term\nmating situations (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Kelly & Dunbar,\nand drinking alcohol--being physically risky behaviors--\nappear to function as a short-term mating strategy. Young men\nwith high mating motivations engage more in drinking games\nand smoking behavior (Hone, Carter, & Mccullough, 2013;\nwhereas women perceive male cigarette and alcohol users to\nbe more sexually unrestricted and more desirable as a short-\nterm partner than nonusers (Vincke, 2016).\nFemale Short-Term Mating\nAlso in women, risk-taking functions as a cue in short-term\nmating situations. Both physical and social risk-taking (i.e.,\nengaging in nonconformist behavior that can damage one's rep-\nutation) enhance female attractiveness in short-term mating con-\nlong-term mating situations, on the other hand, men prefer risk\nunless the risky activities are moderate (Farthing, 2007).\nIn line with risk-taking literature and male signaling,\nresearch also indicates that female cigarette and alcohol con-\nsumption are related to short-term mating. Indeed, and similar\nto men, women with high mating efforts participate more in\ndrinking games (Hone & McCullough, 2015; Hone et al.,\n2013). In addition, both young men and women who are\nactively dating drink more alcohol compared to youngsters\nwho are not dating or who are in a committed relationship\n(Devos-Comby, Daniel, & Lange, 2013; Pedersen, Lee, Lari-\nshows that the amount of money spent on alcohol is a very\nstrong predictor of women's level of sexual unrestrictedness.\nWomen even indicate considering drinking as a means to indi-\ncate sexual willingness to others (Lindgren, Pantalone, Lewis,\n& George, 2009; Lindgren, Parkhill, George, & Hendershot,\n2008), whereas men perceive women who drink alcohol as\nbeing more sexually available and willing (Abbey, 2002; Gar-\nIn women, smoking behavior is also linked to higher mating\nefforts and an unrestricted sexual approach (Jones & Figuer-\n\u00b0ngstro\ngirls with a liberal sexual approach are up to 8 times more\nlikely to smoke (Li, King, & Winter, 2010), while--more so\nfor girls than boys--early dating is a strong predictor of smok-\ning later in life (Fidler, West, Jarvis, & Wardle, 2006). Smok-\ning also appears to be the best predictor of sexual risky\nbehavior in both male and female adolescents (Farid, Rus,\nGiven the harmful health consequences of smoking and\ndrinking, both behaviors can be considered physically risky for\nwomen. In addition, cigarette and alcohol use is still perceived\nas masculine behavior (de Visser & McDonnell, 2012; de Vis-\n& Dalton, 2009), leading to a ``manly'' impression of women\nwho engage in smoking and drinking (C. Jackson & Tinkler,\ndrinking can also be considered social risk-taking, used by\nwomen to oppose to traditional gender roles.\nCurrent Research\nAs women engage in male signaling strategies to indicate a short-\nterm mating orientation to others, we hypothesize that female\ncigarette and alcohol use can function as a short-term mating\nstrategy. Accordingly, we expect that a woman's smoking and\ndrinking behavior will operate as a perceivable cue that affects\nmen's perception. As smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol\ncan be considered physically and socially risky for women, we\nbelieve that a higher cigarette and alcohol consumption will lead\nto a more unhealthy and risky impression of a young woman's\noverall behavior (Hypothesis 1). Moreover, we expect that men\nwill perceive women who engage in cigarette and alcohol use as\nbeing more unrestricted in their sexuality (Hypothesis 2). Also,\nsmoking and drinking will bring attractiveness advantages to\nyoung women (Hypothesis 3). Corresponding with risk-taking\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nliterature, occasional smoking and drinking behavior--being\nmoderate risky behaviors--will enhance women's attractiveness\nin both short-term and long-term mating contexts (Hypothesis\n3a). Heavy smoking and drinking, on the other hand, will bring\nattractiveness benefits only in short-term mating situations\n(Hypothesis 3b). Additionally, if cigarette and alcohol use\nfunction as a short-term mating strategy because of their phys-\nical or social riskiness, we also believe that the perceived\noverall behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness will mediate\nmen's assessment of women (Hypothesis 4).\nFurthermore, for smoking and drinking to operate as a short-\nterm mating strategy, men's perceptions must correspond with\nyoung women's actual behavior. Therefore, female smokers\nand drinkers must be more short-term oriented in their sexual-\nity compared to nonusers (Hypothesis 5). Moreover, we believe\nto find a correlation between users' level of sexual unrestrict-\nedness and their average cigarette and alcohol consumption\nthat matches with the results of Hypothesis 2 (Hypothesis 6).\nTo answer these hypotheses, two studies were conducted.\nStudy 1: The Perception of Female Smoking\nand Drinking Behavior\nDesign\nTo investigate how young men assess women's sexual strategy\nand attractiveness as a function of their smoking and drinking\nbehavior, an online between-subjects experiment was con-\nducted. More specifically, a factorial survey approach was\nused, in which participants evaluated vignettes (descriptions),\nvarying (an) experimental factor(s) (Auspurg & Hinz, 2015).\nThis research approach has already proven successful in the\nstudy of risky behavior (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Kelly & Dun-\nsignaling behavior (Sundie et al., 2011).\nParticipants\nIn total, 233 young men started the online experiment. Because\nof the attractiveness-related questions of Hypothesis 3, partici-\npants with a homosexual orientation as well as participants\noutside the young adult age range and participants with largely\nincomplete questionnaires were excluded from the data set. The\nfinal sample consisted of 218 men, between the age of 18 and\nin the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. In Belgium, it is legal\nto sell alcohol to youngsters from 16 years on. Only when buying\nliquor, youngsters need to be 18 years. The 16-year-old age\nlimit also counts for buying cigarettes (www.belgium.be),\nmaking all participants legal consumers of both substances.\nMaterials and Measures\nIn this first study, behavioral profiles (vignettes) were created,\ndescribing the hobbies of typical young women in circa 70\nwords. In total, two behavioral profile sets were created, focus-\ning respectively on smoking and drinking behavior. Each profile\nset consisted of three versions, varying the women's smoking or\ndrinking frequency. All three versions were identical, except for\nthe last sentence, stating that the person did not use, used occa-\nsionally, or used frequently (see Appendix). All participants rated\none version of each behavioral profile set, that is, one smoking\nbehavioral profile and one drinking behavioral profile.\nTo distribute these profiles, three online links were created\nvia the program ``Thesistools,'' each link containing two pro-\nfiles. All three links first showed a smoking profile followed by\na drinking profile, yet varied the behavioral frequencies. For\ninstance, when opening the first link, participants were asked to\nread a behavioral profile in which the target individual smoked\noccasionally and one in which she drank alcohol frequently.\nTo assess the attractiveness of the main character as a func-\ntion of her smoking/drinking frequency, participants were\nasked the following: ``Based on the profile you just read, how\nattractive would you find this person as a potential partner in\nthe following situations? (a) a short-term relationship (a date,\none-night stand, casual relationship, etc.) and (b) a long-term\nrelationship (loyal, committed relationship, marriage).'' Both\nquestions were followed by a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging\nfrom 1 (not at all attractive) to 7 (very attractive).\nTo gain insight into the perceived sexual strategy, partici-\npants were asked to fill in the three attitudinal items of the\nSociosexual Orientation Inventory (e.g., Sex without love is\nOK.), assessing the level of sexual unrestrictedness (Simpson\n& Gangestad, 1991). However, participants were asked to fill\nin these questions from the perspective of the main character in\nthe profile (Sundie et al., 2011): ``To what extent do you think\nthe person in the profile would agree with the following state-\nments? Answer this question as you think the main character\nfrom the profile would reply.'' Here also, a 7-point Likert-type\nscale was used, ranging from 1 (I strongly disagree) to 7\n(I strongly agree). A new variable computed the mean score\nof the three questions, for both the smoking and drinking pro-\nfiles (asmoking\n\u00bc .79). A higher score indicated a\nmore short-term oriented, unrestricted sexual orientation.\nFinally, participants also indicated on a 7-point Likert-type\nscale how unhealthy and risky they considered the overall\nbehavior of the target individual to be: ``Based on the profile\nyou just read, to what extent do you agree with the following\nstatements (a) This person behaves in an unhealthy manner and\n(b) This person behaves in a risky manner.''\nParticipants agreeing to take part in the experiment ran-\ndomly received one of the online links to the different vignette\nsets. Participants were first informed that they would be taking\npart in an experiment focusing on behavioral perceptions, in\nwhich evaluations of others needed to be made. After confirm-\ning participants' confidentiality and anonymity, all participants\nread and rated the behavioral profiles.\nStatistical Analysis\nIn the first study, mixed analyses of variance (mixed ANOVAs)\nwere conducted to verify Hypotheses 1 and 3. Significant main\neffects were reported via pairwise comparisons. Simple effects\nanalyses via the SPSS syntax (Field, 2013) were used to discuss\nsignificant interaction effects. To study Hypothesis 2, univari-\nate ANOVAs were conducted, followed by Tukey post hoc\ntesting. Finally, for Hypothesis 4, mediation analyses were\nperformed, using Model 4 of the PROCESS procedure of\nHayes (2013; http://www.afhayes.com). Because of the high\ncorrelation between the two potential mediators unhealthi-\nness and riskiness in both profile sets (rsmoking\nyses were preferred over parallel mediation with two media-\ntors (Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). In addition, three\ndummy variables were created to compare the conditions\nof the independent variable ``profile version'': occasional\nusage versus no usage, frequent usage versus no usage, and\nfrequent usage versus occasional usage. Bias-corrected boot-\nstrapping (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) was used to gener-\nate 95% confidence intervals around the indirect effects of\nperceived unhealthiness and riskiness on the SOI and attrac-\ntiveness ratings. Mediation is present when the confidence\nintervals exclude zero.\nResults\nThe Impact of Smoking and Drinking on Perceived\nBehavioral Unhealthiness and Riskiness\nTo investigate Hypothesis 1, two mixed ANOVAs were con-\nducted: one for the smoking profiles and one for the drinking\nprofiles. Perceived unhealthiness and riskiness served as\ndependent variables in the within-subjects factor ``harmful-\nness.'' Profile version functioned as between-subjects factor,\nwith the three behavioral frequencies: never, occasional, and\np\np\n\u00bc .069, results showed a significant interaction effect\nbetween perceived riskiness and unhealthiness as a function\nof usage frequency.

The mean SOI score served as depen-\ndent variable, whereas profile version--varying between the\nthree behavioral frequencies never, occasional, and fre-\nquent--was used as independent variable.\nResults indicated that women's perceived sexual strategy\np\np\n\u00bc .165. More specifically, post hoc analyses\n(see Figure 2) showed that both an occasional (p \u00bc .012) and\nfrequent smoker (p < .001) were perceived as significantly\nmore short-term oriented in their sexuality compared to a non-\nsmoker. However, there were no significant differences\nbetween the two smoking frequencies (p \u00bc .599). Similarly,\nperceived as significantly more sexually unrestricted compared\nto a nondrinker. Additionally, a frequent alcohol user was also\nregarded as having a more short-term-oriented mating tactic\ncompared to an occasional drinker (p \u00bc .001).\nAttractiveness as a Function of Smoking and Drinking\nBehavior\nTwo mixed ANOVAs were conducted (one for smoking beha-\nvior and one for drinking behavior) to verify if women's short-\nterm and long-term attractiveness is affected differently\ndepending on their smoking and drinking frequency. Short-\nterm and long-term attractiveness functioned as the dependent\nvariables in the within-subjects factor ``attractiveness.''

The interaction effect (see Figure 3) confirmed\nthese findings for short-term attractiveness, with no significant\ndifferences between the nonsmoking and occasional smoking\nprofile (p \u00bc .814), and frequent cigarette use being less desir-\nable in a short-term mating partner (ps < .001). However, both\noccasional (p \u00bc .010) and frequent smoking (p < .001) did harm\na woman's long-term attractiveness compared to not smoking,\noccasional smoking being more attractive than frequent smoking\n(p < .001). In addition, the main effect of the within-subjects\nfactor showed that overall, the smoking profiles received higher\nshort-term attractiveness (M \u00bc 4.87, SD \u00bc 1.60) than long-term\nattractiveness ratings (M \u00bc 3.07, SD \u00bc 1.62). The simple effect\nanalyses of the interaction effect confirmed that short-term\nattractiveness scores exceeded the long-term attractiveness rat-\nings in all three profiles (ps < .001).\nFor the alcohol profiles, findings showed a significant main\np\nas well as a significant interaction effect between short-term\nand long-term attractiveness and the drinking frequency, F(2,\np\nThe profile version main effect showed that occasional\ndrinking (M \u00bc 5.35, SD \u00bc 1.03) was perceived as more attrac-\nfrequently was considered slightly more attractive than not\ndrinking (p \u00bc .048). However, when looking at the interaction\neffect (see Figure 3), this pattern differed for short-term and\nlong-term attractiveness. More specifically, both an occasional\n(p \u00bc .003) and frequent drinker (p < .001) were perceived as\nmore desirable for short-term mating than a nondrinker, with\nno significant differences between the two alcohol using pro-\nfiles (p \u00bc .276). Yet, the attractiveness benefits of heavy drink-\ning faded in a long-term mating context. Only occasional\ndrinking enhanced a woman's long-term attractiveness com-\npared to not drinking (p < .001) and frequent drinking\n(p < .001). Not drinking and drinking frequently did not differ\n(p \u00bc .432). Additional follow-up analyses of the interaction\neffect showed that there were no differences between a\nwoman's short-term and long-term desirability in the nondrink-\ning condition (p \u00bc .144). An occasional drinker, on the other\nhand, was more attractive as a long-term partner (p \u00bc .006),\nwhereas a frequent drinker was more desirable as a short-term\nthan a long-term partner (p < .001).\nThe Influence of Perceived Riskiness and Unhealthiness\non Male Impressions\nTo investigate if men's perceptions are affected by the per-\nceived behavioral riskiness (Hypothesis 4), mediation analyses\nwere conducted. The SOI scores, short-term attractiveness, and\nlong-term attractiveness were used separately as outcome vari-\nables (Y). The three dummy variables of the profile versions\nserved as independent variables (X) and covariates, with per-\nceived unhealthiness and riskiness as the two (separate) med-\niators (M).\nResults (see Table 1) showed significant positive indirect\neffects of the smoking and drinking frequency on the perceived\nlevel of sexual unrestrictedness, through unhealthiness and ris-\nkiness perceptions. These findings indicate that as the smoking\nand drinking frequency increased, the perceived behavioral\nunhealthiness and riskiness rose, leading to a more sexually\nunrestricted impression of the young woman. Only for occa-\nsional drinking, no mediation via perceived unhealthiness was\nfound. In addition, in the smoking profiles, no significant indi-\nrect effects were present for short-term and long-term attrac-\ntiveness. However, for drinking alcohol, perceived behavioral\nriskiness did mediate women's short-term and long-term\nSmoking profiles Drinking profiles\nPerceived sexual strategy (SOI)\nNever\nOccasional\nFrequent\nFigure 2.

Accordingly, a higher drink-\ning frequency led to a more risky impression, enhancing a\nwoman's attractiveness.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of the first experimental study showed that both\nsmoking and drinking could be considered unhealthy and risky\nbehaviors that influence men's perceptions. First of all, both\nbehaviors functioned as a cue for women's short-term sexual\nstrategy. Additionally, frequent drinking brought short-term\nattractiveness benefits to women, whereas a similar trend was\nvisible for occasional smoking. These results indicate that cigar-\nette and (especially) alcohol use could function as a female\nshort-term mating strategy. However, for this mating strategy\nto work, women's behavior must correspond with men's percep-\ntions. Therefore, a second survey study was conducted.\nThe Sexual Strategy of Young Female\nSmokers and Drinkers\nDesign\nThe aim of the second study was to investigate if young women\nwho use cigarettes and alcohol are more unrestricted in their\nsexuality compared to nonusers (Hypothesis 5) and to verify if\nthere is a correlation between the level of sexual unrestricted-\nness and the behavioral frequency of users, similar to men's\nperceptions (Hypothesis 6). To answer these hypotheses, an\nonline survey was carried out assessing young women's\nTable 1.

Additionally, the smoking\nand drinking frequency of users was measured by questioning\non how many days in the previous month they had smoked\ncigarettes or drank alcohol. Answers were given on a 7-point\nscale with fixed categories (not a single day, 1\u00ad2 days, 3\u00ad5\nquently, average weekly consumption was assessed by asking\nhow often respondents smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol on\naverage per week. This was measured with an 8-point scale\ncigarettes a week, 11\u00ad20 cigarettes a week, 1\u00ad3 cigarettes a\nthan 20 cigarettes a day). The same frequency categories were\nused for alcoholic drinks.\nTo assess young women's level of sexual unrestrictedness,\nthe Revised Sociosexual Inventory (Sociosexual Orientation\nInventory (SOI)-R; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008) was used. This\ninventory consists of nine questions, addressing a person's atti-\ntude toward casual sex (e.g., Sex without love is OK.), their\nsexual desires (e.g., How often do you have fantasies about\nhaving sex with someone with whom you do not have a com-\nmitted romantic relationship?), and past behavioral experi-\nences (e.g., With how many different partners have you had\nsex within the past 12 months?). Additionally, the Short-Term\nMating Orientation (STMO) Scale and Long-Term Mating\nOrientation (LTMO) Scale were added, measuring both\nshort-term and long-term mating tendencies separately via\nstatements (Jackson & Kirkpatrick, 2007). The STMO contains\n10 statements (e.g., Sometimes I would rather have sex with\nsomeone I do not care about.), whereas the LTMO consists of\nseven questions (e.g., I hope to have a romantic relationship\nthat lasts the rest of my life.). All scales had sufficient internal\nconsistency (aSOI-R\nStatistical Analyses\nMann\u00adWhitney tests were used to verify if the mating strategy\nof smokers and drinkers differs from nonusers (Hypothesis 5).\nThis nonparametric variant for testing two groups was chosen\nbecause of the large differences in sample sizes between users\nand nonusers, combined with a violation of the normality\nassumption for some groups. Second, one-tailed correlations\nwere conducted to verify if users' level of sexual unrestricted-\nness rises with their smoking and drinking frequency (Hypoth-\nesis 6). As respondents indicated their frequency and average\nalcohol and cigarette consumption on a scale with fixed answer\ncategories, the nonparametric correlation measure ``Spearman\nrho,'' suited for ordinal variables, was opted for.\nResults\nThree Mann\u00adWhitney tests were conducted for both smokers\nand drinkers, with being a user/nonuser as independent variable\nand the SOI-R, STMO, and LTMO as dependent variables.\nResults showed that smokers (Mdn \u00bc 3.56) scored significantly\nhigher on the SOI-R compared to nonsmokers (Mdn \u00bc 2.67),\nindicating a higher level of sexual unrestrictedness (U \u00bc 2,097,\np \u00bc .682, r \u00bc \u00c0.03). For drinking alcohol, the STMO Scale\nshowed that drinkers (Mdn \u00bc 3.10) were more short-term\noriented in their sexuality than nondrinkers (Mdn \u00bc 2.40),\nsignificant trend was found via the SOI-R (U \u00bc 1,246.5,\nunrestrictedness for drinkers (Mdn \u00bc 2.78) than nondrinkers\n(Mdn \u00bc 2.39).

Only the average\nsmoking behavior correlated significantly with the SOI-R\nScale, showing a medium positive relation (rs\np \u00bc .025).

Additionally, a higher alcohol\nconsumption was positively correlated with a higher level of\nsexual unrestrictedness. Young women's cigarette consump-\ntion, on the other hand, was associated less with their level of\nsexual unrestrictedness. These findings correspond with men's\nperceptions, making no distinction between the sexual strategy\nof occasional and frequent smokers, although perceiving heavy\nand occasional drinkers differently.\nGeneral Discussion\nDespite the more harmful health effects of cigarette and alcohol\nuse for women, the traditional gender gap in smoking and\ndrinking behavior is closing in well-developed countries.\nTherefore, this article explored if female smoking and drinking\ncan operate as a short-term mating strategy. By means of an\nexperiment, we studied if cigarette and alcohol use affected the\nperceived overall unhealthiness and riskiness of women's\nbehavior (Hypothesis 1), if men perceived young female smo-\nkers and drinkers as more sexually unrestricted (Hypothesis 2),\nif smoking and drinking brought attractiveness benefits\n(Hypothesis 3), and if men's perceptions were mediated by the\nperceived behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness (Hypothesis\n4). A follow-up study verified if men's perceptions corre-\nsponded with women's actual behavior and sexual strategy\n(Hypotheses 5 and 6).\nConsistent with Hypothesis 2 and previous literature (Kou-\n2000), the experiment confirmed that women who smoke and\ndrink were actually perceived as being more unrestricted in\ntheir sexuality compared to nonusers. However, the extent to\nwhich women smoke did not affect their impression, whereas a\nfrequent drinker was perceived as more short-term oriented\ncompared to an occasional drinker.\nIn addition, drinking enhanced women's attractiveness. As\nstated in Hypothesis 3a, drinking occasionally was considered\nmore desirable in a woman than not drinking, both in a short-\nterm and long-term mating context. Moreover, confirming\nHypothesis 3b, frequent drinking was also perceived as more\nattractive than not drinking but only for short-term mating. For\nsmoking, only a trend was visible, in which short-term attrac-\ntiveness benefits were limited to not harming women's desir-\nability. More specifically, an occasional female smoker was\nconsidered equally attractive by men as a nonsmoker but only\nin short-term mating contexts. A woman's long-term attractive-\nness, on the other hand, was negatively affected when smoking\noccasionally. Smoking frequently was found the least appeal-\ning in both mating contexts.\nThese attractiveness findings of drinking alcohol correspond\nwith general risk-taking literature showing that heavy physical\nand social risk-taking are attractive only in short-term mating\ncontexts (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Sylwester & Pawlowski,\n2011), whereas moderate risk-taking can also be advantageous\nfor long-term mating (Farthing, 2007). Moreover, as moderate\ndrinking is often driven by social motivations and used for\nbonding with others (de Visser, Wheeler, Abraham, & Smith,\nalso be a preferred characteristic in a long-term romantic part-\nner, explaining the high attractiveness of occasional drinking.\nFinally, similar results were found in a recent study, showing\nthat a person's general (i.e., long-term) attractiveness increased\nwhen drinking a moderate amount of alcohol, yet decreased\nwhen drinking more (Van Den Abbeele, Penton-Voak, Att-\nThe second study confirmed the male perceptions of Study 1\n(Hypothesis 5), showing that users of cigarettes and alcohol\nwere more short-term oriented in their mating strategy than\nnonusers. These results also agree with studies linking higher\nmating efforts to smoking and drinking behavior, in both men\nJones & Figueredo, 2007). Furthermore, the survey revealed\nthat female users' level of sexual unrestrictedness was not con-\nsistently correlated with their smoking frequency, yet was\nclearly related to their alcohol consumption. This also matches\nwith the male impressions of Study 1, in which female smokers\nwere perceived as being more short-term oriented independent\nof their smoking frequency, whereas their impression was\naffected by the drinking frequency.\nThese findings show that female smoking and drinking\nbehavior are perceivable short-term mating cues, affecting a\nwoman's attractiveness. In addition, there appears to be a clear\nlink between a woman's sexual orientation and her cigarette\nand alcohol consumption. Yet, the question remains why. On\nthe one hand, results indicated that smoking and drinking can\nbe considered unhealthy and risky behaviors, affecting the\noverall behavioral impression of women. On the other hand,\nHypothesis 4, verifying if men's perceptions are actually\nmediated by the perceived behavioral unhealthiness and riski-\nness, was only partially confirmed. As expected, the perceived\nsexual strategy was mediated in a positive manner. Accord-\ningly, a higher smoking and drinking frequency led to a more\nsexually unrestricted impression through a higher perceived\nunhealthiness and riskiness. However, perceived riskiness only\nmediated the short-term and long-term attractiveness of the\nalcohol profiles, with no significant mediating effects on the\nattractiveness ratings of the smoking profiles. The fact that a\nhigher perceived riskiness of drinking alcohol enhanced a\nwoman's short-term desirability corresponds with scientific\nliterature, showing that drinking alcohol can be considered\nsocially risky behavior in women (cf. supra), increasing\nwomen's short-term desirability (Sylwester & Pawlowski,\n2011). Moreover, it could also indicate a higher willingness\nto take sexual risks. The finding that a higher perceived riski-\nness also raised a woman's long-term attractiveness was rather\nunexpected. Possibly, this could point out that the perceived\nriskiness of drinking behavior remained rather moderate.\nIn the theoretical part, we mentioned that smoking and\ndrinking might function as a short-term mating strategy\nbecause of its' masculine connotation (Sylwester &\nPawlowski, 2011). According to the social role theory, male\nand female gender roles are learned through cultural transmis-\nsion and socialization. Consequently, women would also be\nsocialized through these gender roles to find unhealthy\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nconsumption behaviors masculine (Eagly & Wood, 1999; Wal-\ndron, 1997). Although we agree with this cultural approach in\nthat women can use masculine behavior to signal information\nabout themselves to others, we believe that it is not cultural\ntransmission that makes smoking, drinking, and other risk-\ntaking typically male behavior. All over the world, young men\nengage most in risk-taking behavior (Kruger & Nesse, 2004).\nMoreover, as testosterone levels correlate with these risky\nbehaviors, there appear to be biological determinants present\nSaad, Nepomuceno, & Mendenhall, 2011; Sylwester &\nPawlowski, 2011). Furthermore, these biological determinants\nare also found in women. For instance, unrestricted women\nappear more masculine in body, behavior, and mind (Campbell\ning higher testosterone levels (Edelstein, Chopik, & Kean,\ndo believe that cultural transmission affects which behaviors\nare considered suitable signaling behavior. Applied to this\nresearch, we believe that the positive perception of drinkers\nand drinking and the more negative discourse about smoking\npartly explain why alcohol confirms our expectations more\nthan using cigarettes.\nDue to alterations in the brain chemistry, low levels of\nalcohol reduce stress, create a positive mood, and make peo-\nple less inhibited. Consequently, moderate drinkers are often\nmore socially unrestricted and pleasant (Mitchell et al., 2012;\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2010).\nIn addition, moderate alcohol consumption is often perceived\nas positive, due to studies indicating that occasional, moder-\nate drinking can have positive effects on one's health (Di\ncontradicts these health improving qualities of moderate\nStockwell et al., 2016), the idea is still present among many\nconsumers. Also, youngsters are confronted with a large\namount of advertisements, in which attractive people pro-\nmote alcoholic beverages (Gunter, Hansen, & Touri, 2008;\nSnyder, Milici, Slater, Sun, & Strizhakova, 2006). Accord-\ningly, drinking alcohol is widely accepted, with more than\n90% of Flemish college and university students using alcohol\n(Lorant, Nicaise, Soto, & d'Hoore, 2013; Rosiers et al.,\nThe discourse on smoking, on the other hand, is much more\nnegative, as the dangers of cigarette use are stressed in many\ncommunications (e.g., in Belgium, every package of cigarettes\ncontains a warning) and cigarette advertising is often no longer\nallowed. Additionally, although smoking briefly stimulates the\nsmoker's mind (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2016), it\ndoes not have the same inhibiting effects as alcohol on the\nuser's behavior. Consequently, smoking is not always regarded\nin a positive manner (Chassin, Presson, Sherman, & Kim,\nof the Flemish university and college students smoking cigar-\nFuture Research and Limitations\nFirst of all, the first study did not take into account the smoking\nand drinking behavior of the participants. Consequently, in a\nfuture study, it would be relevant to find out if users and nonu-\nsers perceive smokers and drinkers differently. Furthermore,\nthe first study measured the perceived unhealthiness and riski-\nness of the behavioral profiles, yet did not explicitly focus on\nsocial riskiness. Also, the behavioral profiles of the first study\ndescribed an active lifestyle. Future research could verify if\nmen's perception of young women as a function of their smok-\ning and drinking behavior differs when other characteristics are\ndescribed. Moreover, we would also propose future studies to\nfocus on the quantity of smoking and drinking behavior, next to\nthe frequency. After all, the amount of alcohol and cigarettes\nused on one occasion could also have a high impact on people's\nimpression, especially when considering a short-term sexual\nrelationship. In our second survey study, we only had a limited\nnumber of young women who abstained from drinking or who\nchoose to smoke. Although the lower amount of nondrinkers\nand smokers corresponds with recent studies (Lorant et al.,\nstatistical assumptions, future studies should verify if the same\nresults are present in larger samples.\nFinally, the findings indicate that female smoking and drink-\ning can operate as a short-term mating strategy. However, the\nstudies in this article are limited to exploring this hypothesis,\nshowing that female smoking and drinking functions as a per-\nceivable cue, affecting women's attractiveness. Moreover, it\nalso shows that women's smoking and drinking behavior cor-\nresponds with this cue. However, more research is necessary to\nfind out if this link between cigarette/alcohol use and short-\nterm mating is an actual signaling system, in which the cues are\nmeant to indicate a short-term mating orientation (STMO)\n(Donath, 2007). Corresponding with research on luxury con-\nsumption as a signaling system (Hudders, De Backer, Fisher, &\nif short-term mating motivations stimulate smoking and drink-\ning behavior in women are necessary. In addition, more\nresearch is necessary to clarify if smoking and drinking is\nrather intentional than unintentional, rather implicit than expli-\ncit communicative signaling strategy. However, women's\nsmoking and drinking does not have to be conscious and delib-\nerate for these behaviors to function as a sexually strategic\nsignal.\nConclusion and Implications\nIn conclusion, findings showed that smoking and (especially)\ndrinking can operate as a short-term mating strategy, function-\ning as a mating cue and bringing attractiveness benefits in\nshort-term mating contexts. As the traditional gender gap in\nyouth smoking and drinking is closing, and given the harmful-\nness of both behaviors to women, these findings are of interest\nto social marketing professionals and institutions addressing\nyouth cigarette and alcohol use. Not only do these findings give\ninsight into less obvious female behavioral motivations, it also\nshow that emphasizing physical or social risks (e.g., in social\nmarketing campaigns) in order to prevent smoking and drink-\ning might not always have the desired effect. Even more, it may\nturn out to be contra productive.\nAppendix\nExample of Vignettes\nSophie likes to play tennis and follows weekly lessons.
