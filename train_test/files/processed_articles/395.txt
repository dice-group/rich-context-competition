The next generation of research\non nurse home visitation is focused on under-\nstanding patterns of differential intervention utili-\nzation and effectiveness (Korfmacher, Kitzman,\n& Olds, 1998). This type of research includes\nreturning to intervention group data in an effort\nto identify characteristics that differentiate sub-\ngroups of intervention ``responders'' from ``non-\nresponders'' (Barnard et al., 1988; Cole, Kitzman,\nTheoretically derived constructs are needed\nto help researchers focus on characteristics that\nhold promise in predicting the readiness and/or\nability of participants to benefit from designed\ninterventions. The aim of this study was to test the\nconstruct of self-agency as a potential moderator\nof intervention effectiveness when interventions\nare directed toward a purposeful change in health\nbehavior.\nAmong the common themes in literature on\nbehavior change, those relevant to this study\ninclude: (a) the developmental readiness to envi-\nsion a future self and recognize the capacity for\nself-agency and self-regulated change (Damon &\nZimmerman, 2000), (b) the influence of social\ncontexts on self-agency development (Emde,\n1965), and (c) the qualities of relationships that\ninspire hope that change is possible (Beitman,\n1987; Emde; Howard, Lueger, Maling, & Marti-\nnovich, 1993) and offer the supportive scaffold-\ning and tools for behavior change (Beitman;\nDemetriou; Prochaska & Norcross, 1994; Rubin,\nThe source of self-regulated behavior change\nhas been attributed to transformations in the indi-\nvidual's conceptualization of self (Bandura, 1977,\nunderstanding offers a developmental explanation\nfor self-transformations that bring about the re-\nadiness to engage in processes of self-regulated\nchange. They view self-understanding as a domain\nof social-cognitive knowledge; cognitive repre-\nsentations of self are constructed within a social\ncontext. Damon and Hart found evidence of the\ndevelopmental basis for self-understanding by\nstudyingtheself-definitionsofchildrenandadoles-\ncents. They reported that children's definitions of\nself acquire greater organization, complexity, and\ndifferentiation as they progress from early child-\nhood to late adolescence. Self-agency is a char-\nacteristic of self-understanding that first appears in\nthe definitions of young adolescents. Self-agency\nis defined as the conceptual understanding of self\nas an agent capable of shaping motives, behavior,\nand future possibilities. The capacity for abstract\nthinking, associated with cognitive development\nduring adolescence, makes possible the awareness\nof a continuous self, existing from the past into\nthe future. This sense of self-continuity allows\nthe individual to envision a future self that is the\nculmination of current motivations, intentions,\nand actions.\nThe realization of self-agency assumes the\ncapacity for the self-regulatory skills of fore-\nthought,self-instruction,self-monitoring,andself-\nlocated the emergence of the capacity for self-\nregulating cognitions within the adolescent stage\nof development, a view consistent with Damon\nand Hart's (1991) findings relative to self-agency.\nHowever, Damon and Hart allowed that not all\nadolescents endorse a belief in self-agency; the\nself-definitionsofsomeadolescentsretaintheview\nthat forces beyond their control largely determine\ntheir behavior and life circumstances. Sociocultu-\nral differences in endorsement of self-agency have\nbeen documented by researchers applying Damon\nand Hart's theory (Damon, Hart, & Levitt, 1991;\nHart & Edelstein, 1992). Their findings are con-\nsistent with a social-cognitive perspective of de-\nvelopment; although stages of development may\nbe associated with age-typical characteristics\nacross individuals, variability in experience and\nopportunity in a social context can account for\ndifferences in how developmental potential is\nrealized. In particular, the development of higher-\norder self-representations during adolescence\ndepends on social scaffolding that supplies the\nnecessary support, experience, and instruction\nSocial context contributes to self-development\nthrough the provision of basic needs, facilitative\nrelationships, social norms, and opportunities.\nMaslow's theory of the hierarchical nature of\nhuman needs established the potency of basic,\nlower-order needs for survival, safety, and security\n(1970). According to Maslow, living situations in\nwhich disrupted physical, economic, and emo-\ntional states persist over time may evoke a more\nor less continuous activation and arousal of basic\nneeds and affects. Winnicott's (1965) theory of\nemotional development within facilitative envir-\nonments supplied a link in understanding the rela-\ntionship between the arousal of basic needs and\nprocesses of self-development. Winnicott identi-\nfied qualities of facilitative environments that\npromote self-development as a sense of ``going-\non-being.'' He identified a state called the quiet\ncontinuity of experience, a time when needs are\nadequately met and an individual is free from\nphysiological impingement; this is an essential\nstate, according to Winnicott, in which individuals\nbecome aware of the ongoing nature of self. Suf-\nficient periods of low-key sensations encourage\nawareness of the continuity of self through time\nand space, from past to future. In contrast, when\nbasic needs are aroused, they take center stage\nand may evoke intense affects that interrupt this\nsmooth, continuous sense of self. The pull of\nattention toward basic, lower-order needs may\nconfine the individual to a reactive, ``now time''\norientation that temporarily, or more or less con-\ntinuously, distracts him or her from processes of\nongoing self-development.\nBeyond the immediate and disruptive impact of\nunmet needs, an impoverished social environment\nmay impose a more insidious influence on self-\nagency by eroding individual aspirations. Accord-\nsocial context to which individuals belong and\naffiliate, conditions their thoughts, perceptions,\nand actions by a common code of understanding\nand experience. These common experiences in-\nform group members in many subtle ways about\nwhat they can do or cannot do, what is possible or\nnot possible, and what is beyond any chance of\nsuccess. An individual's aspirations for self are\nthus conditioned by the norms of his or her most\nfamiliar social groups, the family and neighbor-\nhood, long before these expectations are brought\ninto personal consideration as an aspect of self-\nagency. MacLeod (1995) identified the tendency\nof individual adolescents to reproduce and defend\nthe aspirations of those in their social group as the\nmost reasonable possibilities for their own lives.\nSocial contexts associated with poverty and social\ndisadvantage thus may provide life experiences\nthat stifle personal aspirations and negate beliefs\nin one's ability to purposefully change future out-\ncomes through self-effort.\nEmde's position (1990) is of particular rele-\nvance in considering the possibility that lack of\nself-agency may result from suppressed aspi-\nrations and thwarted opportunities in socially\ndisadvantaged environments. Emde defines de-\nvelopment as an integrative process that is con-\ntinuously organizing toward higher levels of\ncomplexity and self-differentiation throughout\nlife. When faced with difficult life circumstances,\nan individual's development may be blocked but\ncan be remobilized at a later point given an ap-\npropriate facilitative context. According to Emde,\nempathic availability is the hallmark of relation-\nships capable of mobilizing individual develop-\nment. Empathic availability also inspires a sense\nof hope that change is possible (Beitman, 1987;\nEmpathic relationships provide the scaffolding\nthat engenders self-development, but to experi-\nence the capacity for self-agency, individuals also\nneed the tools of purposeful behavior. One such\ntool is language, a sufficiently well-developed\nvocabulary for defining and differentiating self.\nDemetriou (2000) emphasized the importance\nof self-regulating language in private, internal\nspeech. Internal dialogue is used to focus one's\nattention and provide self-instruction in the per-\nformance of purposeful behavior. Rubin (1984)\nidentified the importance of language in formulat-\ning an image of a future self, to which purposeful\naction is directed. According to Rubin, mental\nrepresentations that have not been transformed\ninto language remain inaccessible to productive\nproblem solving. ``When language is inadequate,\nambiguous, or vague, the [internal] dialogue can\nbe circularly repetitive, frustrating in its amor-\nphousness and in its nonproductive consumption\nof energy'' (p. 12). It is through dialogue with\nothers that amorphous hopes and possibilities\nare brought into language for the purpose of\nspeech and thereby made accessible to cognitive\nprocesses. Relationships offer the context for\ngiving and receiving the language of self-under-\nstanding, which is necessary to envision and\ncommit to a desired future self.\nAlthough language to define self is necessary,\nit is not sufficient to realize goals. When a child\nsays, ``I want to be an astronaut'', he or she is\nalready using language to describe a future self-\npossibility, but speaking of this possibility does\nnot necessarily make it so. Beitman (1987) and\nProchaska, Redding, and Evers (1997) identified\nthe value of structured activities that facilitate\nprocesses of behavior change. Such activities\ninclude opportunities to envision possibilities for\nself,formulategoals,deviseplans,preparethrough\ncognitive review, practice behavior in context, and\nevaluate the effectiveness of behavior.\na final requisite for relationships that foster self-\nresponsibility in the processes of behavior change.\nThe individual must locate the source of change as\nemanating from self, apart from the facilitative\nother and the relationship that provided the sup-\nportive scaffolding for change. This prepares\nthe individual to act with conviction in his or her\nown capacity and responsibility for self-regulated\nchange.\nFrom this review of literature it can be postulated\nthat self-agency is engendered when individuals\nwith developmental readiness experience social\nnorms, opportunities, and relationships that pro-\nmote the understanding of self as a purposeful\nagent capable of shaping future possibilities.\nEnvironments that supply adequate provisions,\nfacilitative relationships, and opportunities to\nexercise self-influence can prompt and mobilize\nthe development of self-agency. In contrast, envi-\nronments that suppress aspirations and threaten\nbasic needs can impinge on self-development by\nevoking disruptive emotional states and limiting\nopportunities. Without the development of self-\nagency, individuals may continue to subscribe to\nbeliefs that external forces and circumstances be-\nyond their control largely determine what happens\nin their lives. If self-agency is fundamental to\npurposeful action, then the development of self-\nagency may predict the readiness of individuals to\nbenefit from interventions that target a purposeful\nchange in health behaviors.\nAlthough the role of self-agency per se in\naffecting behavior change has not been widely\ninvestigated in the literature on nurse home visi-\ntation for maternal and child health, researchers\nhave reported a number of maternal characteristics\nthat moderate participant engagement and inter-\nvention utilization. Their findings support the\nimportance of factors associated with self-agency\ndevelopment: maternal age and developmental\nreadiness, supportive relationships, and facilita-\ntive social contexts. For example, Osofsky, Culp,\nand Ware (1988) reported that young mothers (age\n16 and younger), by definition developmentally\nimmature, were those least likely to engage in a\nnurse visitation intervention.\nOlds and Korfmacher (1998) identified a com-\nposite of maternal psychological resources that\npredicted intervention participation. The compo-\nsite offactors included maternal IQ, mental health,\ncoping skills, and self-efficacy. Some factors,\nsuch as coping skills and self-efficacy, may have a\ndevelopmental basis, thus lending support to the\nidea of developmental readiness underlying the\nprocesses of intervention utilization. A quadratic\nrelationship between maternal psychological re-\nsources and intervention participation was identi-\nfied from the results of this study: as psychological\nresources increased, intervention participation\ndecreased, but as maternal psychological re-\nsources reached a high level, participation again\nincreased.\nThe role of supportive relationships in inter-\nvention utilization was investigated by Barnard\net al. (1988). These researchers identified a sub-\ngroup of mothers who were more likely to realize\ntargeted outcomes when the intervention was\ndelivered through a supportive relationship with\nthe nurse. Mothers with lower IQs and fewer social\nskills demonstrated greater gains from a mental\nhealth model of intervention that emphasized\nrelationship development than in a model that\nfocused primarily on providing information and\nresources. In contrast, mothers with higher IQs\nand better social skills fared better with an\ninformation-based model of intervention.\nCole et al. (1998) examined social context as\na condition influencing intervention utilization.\nThey found that family structure influenced the\nlikelihood that mothers would bring about healthy\nchanges in their home environments. Mothers\nwhose family structures were complex, with\nmany adults and children sharing the same house-\nhold, experienced less freedom and had less\nauthority to make the changes in the home envi-\nronment that were encouraged by the nurse home\nvisitor.\nThus, the literature on this subject, both theore-\ntical and intervention, supports the examination of\nself-agency as a participant characteristic that\nmight distinguish which individuals respond to\ninterventions that promote a purposeful change in\nhealth behaviors. The aim of our study was to test\nthe role of self-agency in the enactment of health\nbehaviors targeted by intervention, using existing\ndata from one program of nurse home-visitation\nresearch.\nAvailability of data from the New Mothers'\nHome Visitation Study in Memphis, Tennessee\n(Kitzman & Olds, 1990), allowed us to test\nthe theorized relationship between participant\nself-agency and enactment of health behaviors.\nWe examined program outcomes targeted in the\nMemphis study and identified two outcomes\n(subsequent pregnancies and maternal responsive-\nness) in which mothers could reasonably exercise\ncontrol through purposeful effort. We set forth\nhypotheses to test the relationship between\nmaternal self-agency and the enactment of these\noutcomes. We predicted that self-agency would\nmoderate a mother's response to interventions that\ntargeted purposeful change in health behaviors\nand thereby would contribute to differential out-\ncomes among mothers within the intervention\ngroup. We hypothesized that mothers who had\nachieved a clinically relevant threshold of self-\nagency at intake would demonstrate a significantly\ngreater probability of enacting the outcomes of:\n(a) delaying subsequent pregnancies at least\nthrough the second birthdays of their infants and\n(b) displaying responsive maternal behavior.\nMETHOD\nResearch Design and Sample\nThe primary study from which data were used for\nthe secondary analysis was conducted in 1990.\nPregnant women ( 28 weeks gestation) with no\nprevious live births were recruited from a public\nhealth clinic in Memphis. To be in the socially\ndisadvantaged sample group, women had to meet\nat least two of these three criteria: (a) be un-\nmarried, (b) have less than 12 years of education,\nand (c) be unemployed. Eleven hundred and\nthirty-nine women were enrolled in the study\nand randomly assigned to one of four groups.\nGroups 1 and 2 were designated as the control\ngroups: group 1 received free transportation to the\nclinic for prenatal care; and group 2 received both\nfree transportation and developmental screening/\nreferral for their children at 6, 12, and 24 months of\nage. Groups 3 and 4 were the intervention groups:\ngroup 3 received free transportation and devel-\nopmental screening plus intensive nurse home\nvisitations throughout their pregnancies; and\ngroup 4 (n \u00bc 224) received the same services as\ngroup 3, with the intensive nurse home visitations\ncontinuing until their infants' second birthdays\nConsistent with our purpose, to determine\nwhether self-agency was associated with out-\ncomes targeted by intervention, only data from\nmothers in group 4, one of the intervention groups,\nwere used for this analysis. After elimination of\nmothers for whom there were missing data on the\nvariables of interest, the secondary analysis was\nconducted on data from 186 mothers. All these\nmothers had received intensive nurse home visi-\ntation from 28 weeks of pregnancy through\ninfant age of 2 years. Table 1 displays demo-\ngraphic data for the 186 mothers at the time of\nenrollment in the primary study.\nDescription of the Nurse\nHome-Visitation Intervention\nInterventions for the New Mothers' Home Visi-\ntation Program are described in manualized proto-\ncols. In total, 57 nurse visits were prescribed for the\nMemphis study: 12 visits during pregnancy, 25\nvisits during the child's first year, and 20 visits\nduring the child's second year (Kitzman &\nOlds, 1989). Interventions were delivered through\na purposeful relationship between the visiting\nnurse and new mother directed toward increasing\nthe mother's sense of competence in achieving life\ngoals and realizing healthy outcomes for herself\nand her baby. Among the healthy behaviors pro-\nmoted through nurse visitation were planning sub-\nsequent pregnancies and engaging in behaviors to\npromote the infant's social and emotional devel-\nopment. Mothers received information about the\nvalue of playing and talking with their babies and\nrespondingtotheiremotionalneeds.Nursesmodel-\ned ways torecognize and respond toinfantcuesand\nencouraged mothers to report their experiences in\nresponding to their infants. Each visit ended with a\nreview of goals and plans for practicing healthy\nbehaviors before the next visit, and the subsequent\nvisit began with a review of activities directed\ntoward these goals. Program outcomes addressed\nthree areas of maternal functioning: (a) health-\nrelated behaviors during pregnancy and early child\ndevelopment, (b) maternal responsiveness and\nparenting, and (c) the mother's life course devel-\nopment through education, employment, and delay\nof future pregnancies. Additional details about the\nNew Mothers' Home Visitation Program may be\nfound in earlier publications from this program of\nMeasures\nSelf-agency. For this analysis we adopted\nagency as a developmentally based transforma-\ntion in conceptualizing self as a purposeful agent\ncapable of shaping motives, actions, and future\npossibilities. We examined instruments from the\nMemphis study to determine if scales or items\nwere consistent with this definition of self-agency.\nThe Pearlin Mastery Scale (1978) had been ad-\npostpartum. Pearlin and Schooler's definition of\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics of Mothers\nCharacteristics M SD Range\nPercentage of poverty\nhouseholds\nAfrican American 92%\naPercentage of poverty households is the average percent-\nage of poverty households in the census tracts where the\nmothers resided. Poverty households were identified by\nfamily income below the poverty threshold, as established\nmastery was found to be consistent with Damon\nand Hart's definition of self-agency. Pearlin and\nSchooler define mastery as ``the extent to which\nthe individuals regard life-changes as being under\ntheir own control, in contrast to being fatalistically\ncontains seven items; five of the items elicit beliefs\nabout self-control over current life circumstances\nand the ability to solve problems through self-\neffort. The other two items elicit beliefs about the\nability to influence future possibilities for self.\nParticipants were asked to select their level of item\nendorsement from a 4-point continuum of re-\nsponse options ranging from strongly disagree to\nstrongly agree. Scale scores were computed by\nsumming the item scores and dividing by the\nnumber of items completed by each participant.\nScale scores ranged from 1 to 4. Pearlin reported\nthe original Cronbach's alpha for the Mastery\nScale as .72 (personal communication, October 4,\n2002). The Cronbach's alpha for the Pearlin\nMastery Scale used in the Memphis study was .75.\nSubsequent pregnancies. Maternal self-\nreports were the basis for determining subsequent\npregnancies for mothers from the birth of the index\ninfant through that infant's second birthday. Every\npregnancy was counted, whether or not it resulted\nin a live birth.\nMaternal responsiveness. The Maternal Re-\nsponsivity subscale of the Infant/Toddler version\nof Caldwell and Bradley's Home Observation for\nMeasurement of the Environment (HOME, 1979)\nwas used to measure the verbal and emotional\nresponsiveness of mothers toward their infants.\nCaldwell and Bradley reported a Kuder\u00adRichard-\nson internal consistency coefficient of .72 for the\nMaternal Responsivity subscale of the HOME\n(1984). Cronbach's alpha for this subscale in the\nMemphis study was .64. Trained observers asses-\nsed maternal responsiveness within the mothers'\nhome environments at infant ages 12 and 24 months.\nAn interrater reliability of 96% was achieved\nbefore beginning observations.\nCategorical variable coding at relevant\nthresholds of effect. Categorical variables were\ncreated to test the probability of enacting targeted\nhealth behaviors by endorsement of self-agency.\nVariables were split at expected thresholds of\neffect. The goal was to identify a threshold that\nwould likely represent a substantial expression\nof the construct and a noticeable difference in\nbehavior. To maintain the integrity of the re-\nsearch design, variable thresholds were estab-\nlished a priori and external to the data through\nsystematic examination of scale items and possi-\nble response patterns. Establishing thresholds, or\ncut points, of clinical significance has been applied\nin other areas of social science research and can be\nuseful in evaluating behavior at levels of function-\ning pertinent to everyday life (Kazdin, 1999).\nEstablishing a threshold for measurement of\nself-agency was believed to be consistent with the\ntenets of developmental theory. Levels of con-\nceptual understanding are expected to become\nmore complex as individuals develop. Individuals\nare not expected to return to earlier, less diffe-\nrentiated levels of self-understanding after more\ncomplex representations of self have emerged.\nYet some fluctuation in self-agency scores from\nmeasurement to measurement can be anticipated\nbecause of variations in mood and stress or be-\ncause of artifacts of the events immediately pre-\nceding the measurement situation. By imposing\nthreshold and sustainability rules, the magnitude\nof each individual's self-agency endorsement and\nanyfluctuations in scores over timewere evaluated\nin relationship to an overall pattern of evidence\nthat a level of self-understanding consistent with\nself-agency had been achieved.\nThe threshold score for self-agency was estab-\nlished through examination of individual items on\nthe Pearlin Mastery Scale and analysis of possible\nresponse patterns that might yield a scale score of\n1\u00ad4 (see above for a description of scale score\ncomputation). This process resulted in establish-\ning a threshold scale score of 3 out of a possible 4.\nWe reviewed response patterns that could con-\ntribute to a scale score of 3 and concurred that\npatterns yielding a score of 3 or higher would\nlikely represent a substantial expression of self-\nagency. To overcome the potential error of in-\nterpreting maternal self-agency from an isolated\nscore at a single measurement point, sustainability\nrules were applied that required maternal self-\nagency scale scores to be maintained at 2.75 or\nhigher through subsequent measurement periods\nonce the established threshold score of 3 had been\nachieved. For example, a mother might exaggerate\nher endorsement of self-agency at intake, receiv-\ning an intake scale score of 3, but score a much\nlower 1.5 on the Pearlin Mastery Scale at a subse-\npostpartum). Because the threshold established\nfor self-agency was not maintained through sub-\nsequent measurements, this mother would not be\nidentified as achieving and sustaining the thresh-\nold for self-agency.\nA threshold score for maternal responsiveness\nwas derived in a similar manner, through systema-\ntic examination of the 11 items on the Maternal\nResponsivity subscale of the Caldwell and Brad-\nley HOME (1979). A clinically relevant threshold\nscore for responsive maternal behavior was set\nat 9 out of a total possible subscale score of 11.\nSustainability rules were again applied, requiring\nthat a threshold score of 9, achieved at 12 months,\nbe sustained with a subscale score of 8 or higher at\n24 months. If the threshold score was not achieved\nuntil 24 months, a subscale score of 8 or higher on\nthe Maternal Responsivity subscale was required\nfor the previous 12-month HOME observation.\nCategorization by subsequent pregnancies was\nestablished through counting each mother's sub-\nsequent pregnancies from the birth of the index\ninfant through that infant's second birthday. The\nthreshold score was set at 0. Mothers were assign-\ned to either the ``no subsequent pregnancies'' or\n``oneormoresubsequentpregnancies''categories.\nData Analysis\nCategorical variables were submitted to proba-\nbility analyses using the Fisher exact test of\nprobabilities, with alpha established at .05. The\nstatistical model was set up as a 2 \u00c2 2 table, ex-\namining the likelihood of enacting each targeted\nhealth behavior by mothers' self-agency endorse-\nment at intake (threshold met and sustained or\nthreshold not met). The Fisher exact test deter-\nmines the significance of probabilities by testing\nobserved cell frequencies against the possibility\nof extreme marginal frequencies. This is a useful\nprocedure when any cell in a 2 \u00c2 2 table contains\na value of 5 or less. Geometric formulations for the\nFisher exact test of probabilities correct for the\npossibility that extreme values may be distributed\nto one or more of the mutually exclusive cells or\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Data\nApplying the established threshold and sus-\ntainability rules for self-agency, 76 (41%) of the\n186 mothers in this analysis met the criteria for\nachievement of the self-agency threshold on\ntake self-agency score for the 76 mothers who met/\nsustained the self-agency threshold was 3.43\n(SD \u00bc .34).

It\nshould be reiterated that, by definition, achieving\nself-agencythreshold onthePearlinMasteryScale\nat intake carried the requirement of sustaining\na substantial level of self-agency endorsement\nthrough the 24-month postpartum measurement.\nBy the completion of the nurse visitation in-\ntervention and the infants' second birthdays, 69\nleast one subsequent pregnancy. The remaining\ncies for at least the 2-year period following the\nbirth of their infants.\nwas not available for 5 of the 186 mothers in\nthe group; therefore they could not be evaluated by\nthe established threshold and sustainability rules\nfor maternal responsiveness. Threshold scores\nfor maternal responsiveness were achieved and\nthe 24-month measurement. The remaining\n77 mothers (43%) did not achieve and sustain\nthe established threshold for the outcome of\nmaternal responsiveness.\nAnalysis of Probabilities\nProbabilities of enacting the targeted health be-\nhaviors were examined in relationship to partici-\npants' self-agency endorsement on entry into the\nprogram. We anticipated that mothers who had\nachieved the self-agency threshold at intake would\nbe more likely to utilize the nurse home-visitation\nintervention to purposefully direct their behavior\ntoward desired program outcomes.\nA probability analysis was conducted to ex-\namine the likelihood of mothers experiencing\nsubsequent pregnancies based on their self-agency\nendorsement at intake. It was determined that\nmothers who met and sustained the threshold for\nself-agency from intake through subsequent\nmeasurement periods were significantly less likely\nto have experienced subsequent pregnancies by\ntheir infants' second birthdays (Fisher exact,\np \u00bc .014). The power to detect the observed dif-\nference was examined, assuming two-sided and\none-sided tests of significance, with alpha .05\nIn a second analysis we examined the probabi-\nlity of demonstrating responsive maternal beha-\nvior based on mothers' self-agency endorsement\nat intake. It was determined that mothers who met\nand sustained the threshold for self-agency from\nintake through subsequent measurement periods\nwere significantly more likely to meet and sustain\nthe threshold for responsive maternal behavior\n(Fisher exact, p \u00bc .047). The power to detect the\nobserved difference was examined, assuming two-\nsided and one-sided tests of significance, with\nresults.\nDISCUSSION\nTo test the relationship between participant self-\nagency and the enactment of health behaviors, this\nsecondary analysis was conducted with data from\nsocially disadvantaged mothers in the interven-\ntion group of the Memphis New Mothers' Home\nVisitation Study (Kitzman & Olds, 1990). Our\nfindings supported participant self-agency as a\ncharacteristic associated with differential inter-\nvention effectiveness in achieving the targeted\nhealth behaviors of one nurse home-visitation\nprogram. Further research on other study samples\nis necessary to extend the implications of these\nfindings.\nFindings from this study contribute to a body of\nliterature directed toward examination of maternal\ncharacteristics that account for differential in-\ntervention utilization and outcomes in programs\nof nurse home-visitation research. Nurse home-\nvisitation programs apply broad population pa-\nrameters when identifying individuals at risk for\nadverse maternal and child outcomes (Olds &\nKorfmacher, 1998). Participant recruitment casts a\nwide net and typically gathers a heterogeneous\nsample of individuals who meet population cri-\nteria associated with a risk (e.g., criteria for social\ndisadvantage). Once in the study, individual char-\nacteristics and levels of functioning may interact\nwith intervention processes in unforeseen ways\nand contribute to unexplained variance in treat-\nment group effects. In this study we established\na rationale for examining the development of\nself-agency as a theoretically derived character-\nistic that might moderate participant readiness\nto benefit from health-promoting interventions.\nWe found support for this premise in testing the\nTable 2.

These findings are consistent\nwith those of other researchers who have linked\ndifferential intervention utilization to maternal\nage, which may be considered a broad marker for\ndevelopmental differences (Osofsky et al., 1988).\nFindings related to self-agency may encourage the\npursuit of developmental explanations for other\nvariables associated with differential program out-\ncomes, including maternal social skills (Barnard\net al., 1988) and psychological resources (Olds &\nThe purpose of our study was to examine\nwhether self-agency makes a difference in enact-\ning change in health behaviors. The significant\nfindings from this analysis generate additional\nresearch questions. For example, if participant\nself-agency does matter in the probability of re-\nalizing program outcomes, then questions about\nhow or if the development of self-agency can be\nmobilized are of interest. In this analysis we\nidentified self-agency achievement as a partici-\npant characteristic at intake. Additional research\nwill be needed to examine the impact of the nurse\nvisitation intervention on the development of self-\nagency.\nAlso of interest for future analysis is the re-\nsearch question about self-agency development as\na mediator of intervention effects. For example,\ndoes intervention mobilize self-agency devel-\nopment among participants who do not endorse\nself-agency at intake, thereby increasing their\nlikelihood of achieving program outcomes? Re-\nsearch onself-agency as a mediator ofintervention\neffects would require analysis of both the inter-\nvention and control groups.\nThe limitations of this analysis merit discus-\nsion. In conducting a secondary analysis of data,\nwe were limited to the measures used in the\nprimary study. Additional tools and/or items to\nmeasure self-agency would strengthen the find-\nings of this study. We identified the Pearlin\nMastery Scale as an instrument that could re-\npresent the construct of self-agency as defined\nby Damon and Hart (1991). Examination of the\nPearlin Mastery Scale items revealed two under-\nlying dimensions consistent with the self-agency\nconstruct: (a) beliefs in the ability to solve current\nproblems through self-effort and (b) beliefs in the\nability to shape future possibilities through self-\neffort. The availability of the mothers' scores over\nfour measurement points allowed us to establish\nrules for meeting and sustaining a threshold of\nself-agency achievement. For this analysis thresh-\nold and sustainability criteria were established\na priori and were based on the face validity of\nitems. Normative thresholds, derived from ana-\nlyses of populations representing different ages,\nhave not been established for the Pearlin Mastery\nScale. Although findings from this study sup-\nported the usefulness of threshold methodology in\ndetecting the relationship between maternal self-\nagency and enactment of program outcomes,\nadditional research with other study samples is\nneeded to test the merit of the threshold and\nsustainability rules for this scale.\nThis analysis of self-agency and enactment of\nhealth behaviors adds to the body of research on\nmaternal characteristics associated with diffe-\nrential intervention utilization and effectiveness\nin programs of nurse home-visitation research.\nOur findings support the value of self-agency as\na construct of interest in research on behavior\nchange and suggest new areas for instrument\ndevelopment and measurement methodologies.\nThese findings contribute to an awareness of indi-\nvidual differences in self-agency as a potential\nsource of variance in treatment outcomes.\nREFERENCES\nBandura, A.
