The latter are malignant\nand carry a worse prognosis.3\nAlthough a small portion of low grade\ngliomas display benign features, most of\nthese tumours are malignant and usually\nindicate a poor prognosis.4 Despite modern\ndiagnostic methods and treatment strate-\ngies, the median survival time does not\nexceed 15 months.5 This is mainly due to\nthe fact that at the time of surgery, cells from\nthe primary tumour have already invaded\nnormal brain tissue.6 Therefore, it is extre-\nmely important to search for sensitive and\nspecific markers that can provide valuable\ninformation for the early diagnosis and\nidentification of poorly responsive tumours\nthat may benefit from a modified treatment\nregimen.\nTumour metastasis is a multistep process\ninvolving a variety of tumour\u00adhost cell inter-\nactions. Angiogenesis, one such interaction,\nis the outgrowth of endothelial cells from\npre-existing capillary vessels and their migra-\ntion from parental vessels under the stimu-\nlation of vascular endothelial growth factor\n(VEGF),7 which is a homodimeric protein\nidentified as a mitogen for endothelial cells\nin vitro and an angiogenesis promoting fac-\ntor in vivo.8 Glioma cells produce large\namounts of VEGF and high grade gliomas\n(glioblastoma multiform) produce more\nVEGF than lower grade astrocytomas.7,8\nClinical studies have demonstrated that\ncirculating VEGF has a negative prognostic\nvalue in cancer patients, correlating with\ntumour grade and vascularity in gliomas.9,10\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are\nzinc-binding endopeptidases capable of\ndegrading extracellular matrix (ECM) com-\nponents such as collagen, fibrinogen and\nproteoglycans.11 One member of this family,\nMMP-9, has been assigned an important\nrole in tissue-specific remodelling in normal\nand pathological processes, most notably\nduring angiogenesis and tumour invasion.12\nElevated levels of MMP-9 have been found\nin patients suffering from various types of\ntumours in vivo and a correlation has\nbeen established between the secretion of\nFurthermore, overexpression of MMP-9 in\ntransfected nonmetastatic tumour cells ren-\nders them invasive.13,14, Proliferating endo-\nthelial cells subsequently remodel the ECM\nvia MMPs, align into tube-like structures,\nand eventually form new functional blood\nvessels.11 In malignant cells, upregulation of\nangiogenic factors, such as VEGF and\nMMPs, is closely linked to invasion and\nmetastasis.17 There have been few reports on\nthe role of VEGF and MMPs in gliomas.18\nThe present study, therefore, investigated\nthe levels of VEGF and MMP-9 protein\nusing immunohistochemical staining in\norder to determine if either protein has any\nprognostic value in patients with gliomas\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nConsecutive patients with gliomas who had\nbeen diagnosed, treated and followed-up in\nthe Department of Neurosurgery, First\nHospital of Jilin University, Changchun,\nprimary tumour material collected at diag-\nnosis, prior to radiotherapy, was available,\nwere enrolled in the study. For all patients,\nthe original diagnosis and tumour grading\nwas peer-reviewed by two experienced\npathologists according to the principles\nlaid down in the latest World Health\nOrganization (WHO) classification system.2\nThe tumours were classified as low grade\ngliomas (WHO grades II) or high-grade\ngliomas (grades III\u00adIV).\nComputed tomography and magnetic\nresonance imaging data were available in\nall patients. In each patient, the presence\nand extent of necrosis (focal/extensive) was\nalso assessed and compared with those in\nnoncancerous adjacent tissues specimens\n(>3 cm away from the tumor site). There\nwere no other inclusion/exclusion criteria\nfor this study. All patients gave written\ninformed consent to participate in the\nstudy. This study was approved by the\nEthics Committee of Jilin University,\nChangchun, Jilin Province, China.\nImmunohistochemical staining\nPrimary tumour specimens were fixed in\n10% buffered formalin, dehydrated in etha-\nnol, embedded in paraffin wax and cut into\n4-mm sections for use in immunohistochem-\nistry. Serial sections were cut from each\nspecimen and mounted on Superfrost slides\n(Menzel Gla\n\u00a8 ser, Braunschweig, Germany),\ndewaxed with xylene, gradually rehydrated\nand left to dry overnight at 37C. After\ndeparaffinization, immunostaining was\nperformed using the two-step peroxidase\ntechnique with a peroxidase-conjugated\npolymer. Antigen retrieval was achieved by\npressure cooking in 0.01 M citrate buffer\n(pH 6.0) for 5 min. After blocking with 3%\nbovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St\nLouis, MO, USA) in 0.01 mM phosphate-\nthe sections were incubated with mouse\nmonoclonal antibodies against human\nVEGF or MMP-9 (both from Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at a\nwere then washed three times in 0.01 mM\nPBS (pH 7.2) for 5 min at room temperature.\nThe sections were then incubated with\nbiotin-labelled rabbit antimouse antibody\n(1:500 dilution; ZSJB-BIO, Beijing, China)\nPBS (pH 7.2) three times, immunostaining\nwas visualized using a commercial strepta-\nvidin\u00adperoxidase reaction system, and then\ndeveloped with 3% diaminobenzidine\u00adH2\n(all reagents from Wuhan Boster Biological\nTechnology, Wuhan, Hubei, China).\nThe intensity of the immunostaining was\ngraded using a four-point scoring system as\nfollows: 0 if no immunoreactive cells were\nobserved (negative); 1\u00fe if the proportion of\nimmunoreactive cells was <25% (weak); 2\u00fe\nif the proportion of immunoreactive cells\nproportion of immunoreactive cells was\n>75% (strong). In cases with variable stain-\ning intensities, the most common pattern\nwas recorded. Tissue samples with 0 or 1\u00fe\nstaining were classified as negative, and\ntissue samples with 2\u00fe or 3\u00fe staining were\nclassified as positive. Five fields were ran-\ndomly selected from each slide and exam-\nined at a magnification of \u00c2200 using a\nSolms, Germany), and were scored inde-\npendently by two observers who were\nblinded to the clinicopathological data and\nclinical outcomes of the patients. Five cases\nwith discordant results were re-evaluated by\nthe two observers to obtain agreement.\nNegative control sections were incubated\nwith normal mouse serum instead of\nprimary antibody.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows\nand the SAS statistical package, version 9.1\n(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The asso-\nciation between the level of VEGF and\nMMP-9 protein immunostaining and\ntumour grade was analysed using 2-test.\nThe correlation between the level of VEGF\nand MMP-9 protein immunostaining was\nanalysed using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient analysis.

For example, VEGF\nis a secreted mitogen and the dominant\nfactor that regulates angiogenesis in both\nnormal development and tumour growth.21\nDuring the process of haematogenous\nmetastasis, VEGF is suggested to play a\nkey role by participating in the regulation\nof angiogenesis.22 VEGF exerts its growth-\npromoting influence not on the tumour\ncells themselves but on the vascular endo-\nthelial cells, promoting both proliferation\nand new vessel formation.23 Chaudhry\net al.24 demonstrated that the expression\nof VEGF in primary gliomas correlated\nwith an increase in local microvessel dens-\nity in the tumour tissue, development of\npulmonary metastasis and poor prognosis\nfor patients with glioma. These findings\nsuggest that VEGF secreted by glioma cells\nstimulates angiogenesis, which critically\ncontributes to the development of the\npulmonary metastasis of glioma.25\nMoreover, previous research demonstrated\nthat glioma cells produce large amounts of\nVEGF and high-grade gliomas (glioblast-\noma multiform) express more VEGF than\nlower grade astrocytomas.23,24 The results\nof this present study were in agreement\nwith the earlier findings because a signifi-\ncantly higher proportion of high-grade\ngliomas (grades III\u00adIV) demonstrated posi-\ntive VEGF immunostaining compared with\nthe low grade gliomas (grade II)\nTumour invasion is a cascade of sequen-\ntial events that involves detachment of\nTable 1.

The combined\nimmunohistochemical evaluation of the\nlevels of VEGF and MMP-9 proteins in pri-\nmary tumours might be of benefit in pre-\ndicting a poor prognosis of survival in\npatients with malignant glioma.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
