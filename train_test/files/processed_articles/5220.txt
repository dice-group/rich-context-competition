    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe study attempts to approach aging in India from three perspectives, namely, the well-being of an aging individual, the aging\nhousehold, and the aging population. The aspects, namely, work, financial dependence, integration, empowerment, and elder\nabuse are studied and their relation to age, gender, and marital status is investigated. The data sets pertaining to the National\nsets from Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India Survey, 2011, are also utilized for information on elder\nabuse. The results show that the older males are more likely to participate in household activities when compared with the\nolder females. The married older adults are also more likely to participate in household activities when compared with their\nwidowed counterparts. In a similar way, gender and marital status are found to be associated with empowerment of older\nadults. The working older adults, those who possess property and/or assets are more likely to be financially independent.\nFurthermore, the older females and the financially dependent older adults are more likely to face abuses of different kinds.\nHouseholds are classified into three different types. Type I households have no older adults, Type II households have older\nadults and other younger members, and Type III households have older adults only. Results show that Type III households\nare found to be relatively more deprived and report higher average monthly expenditure when compared with other types\nof households.\n",

The recent cen-\ntion of India in 2011. Aging may be viewed from two differ-\nent perspectives, namely, the macro perspective and the\nmicro perspective. From the macro perspective, it depicts a\ndistinct population process. As a characteristic of this pro-\ncess, the center of the age distribution drifts over the time\ntoward the higher ages. From a micro perspective, the point\nof concern is the older adults and their well-being. Human\nbeings, during their life course, move into the older adult-\nhood after transiting through the childhood, the youth, and\nthe adulthood. It is quiet plausible that entry into the older\nadulthood is accompanied by simultaneous changes in their\neconomic, social, and health statuses.\nWhile moving into the realm of older adulthood, most of\nthe people find themselves either retired from active eco-\nnomic life or at the verge of retirement. Economically\nproductive life span of an individual may terminate with her\nor his retirement. Besides, working at older ages may not be\nat par with working at younger ages in the remunerative\nsense. The numbers of working hours also get reduced with\nincreasing age (Singh, Singh, & Sharma, 1987).\nThe age of retirement in India, in the formal sector, varies\nment age exists for people working in informal sectors. India,\nlike other developing countries, has a large agricultural sec-\ntor. This sector can absorb and sustain human resources at\nolder ages. The reason being that unlike the manufacturing\nand the service sectors, it does not require skilled workforce.\nThis sector, therefore, employs a large proportion of\n1Department of Statistics, Ravenshaw University, Cuttack, Odisha, India\n2Sampling and Official Statistics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata,\nWest Bengal, India\nCorresponding Author:\nSanjeev Bakshi, Department of Statistics, Ravenshaw University, Cuttack,\nEmail: bakshisanjeev@gmail.com\nAging and the Socioeconomic Life of\nOlder Adults in India: An Empirical\nExposition\nSanjeev Bakshi1 and Prasanta Pathak2\n Keywords\naging, gender, India, marital status, older adults, empowerment, financial dependence, integration, work, abuse, criminology,\nsocial sciences\n2 SAGE Open\neconomically active older adults. This situation is akin to\nwhat is observed in developing countries in general (Chen,\nPerera, 1989). The estimates of the percentage of workers in\n(Rajan, 2010). This indicates that a large part of the work-\nforce remains devoid of any post-retirement benefits.\nConsequently, these workers turn up being financially depen-\ndent at older ages.\nWorking older adults either work willingly or they are\nforced to work for monetary benefits (Dinesh & Rayappa,\n1983). The reasons for working during older ages may be\nthat the economically active older adults are more favorably\ntreated by their family members (Yadava, Yadava, & Sharma,\n1996). Besides, low income households may not be able to\ncope with the financial dependency of the older adults (Alam,\nIt is presumed that the family was responsible to take care\nof the material and non-material needs of the dependent\nolder adults. This presumption seems logical as we do not\nfind existence of any other means of support to the depen-\ndent older adults, in the past. However, in general, the mate-\nrial and the non-material support in a family may flow from\nrest of the family to the older adults or there may be a flow of\nsupport from the older adults to the family. Thus, the pro-\nvider of support can be conceived as a source of support and\nthe receiver as a recipient of the support. These kinds of flow\nof support are called intergenerational transfers (IGTs). The\ndirection of IGT can be upward (from children to parents),\ndownward (from parents to children), or lateral (from sibling\nto sibling) and these transfers vary in type as time (including\nhelp, services, and visits), money, and goods (including\nshared space and goods through co-residence; Gauthier, Chu,\n& Tuljapurkar, 2007). The state of IGT in the Indian sce-\nnario, however, requires empirical exposition.\nApart from the changes in the work status, the social role\nof an older adult may change. This change occurs because\nthe younger generation steps into the roles that were once\nperformed by the older adults. These changes are detrimental\nto the autonomy of the older adults. In such situations, ques-\ntion naturally arises regarding the capability of the older\nadults to make choices regarding the issues that matter in\ntheir lives. This vulnerability cannot be overcome unless the\nolder adults are powerful enough to have and make choices\nregarding such issues. Therefore, the salience of power, and\nhence empowerment, is evident at the older ages. In other\nwords, an older adult either exercises choices or is power-\nless. To ensure well-being, the powerless need to be\nempowered.\nKar, Catherine, and Kirstin (1999) have identified four\ndomains or aspects of life that affect the overall quality of\nlife of the powerless. These are basic human rights, equal\nrights for women, economic enhancement, and health pro-\nmotion and disease prevention. Citing from earlier works\nCheckoway, 1992), the authors have defined empowerment\nas a process through which individuals, communities, and\norganizations gain control over issues and problems that con-\ncern them the most. According to Kabeer (1999), the process\nof empowerment is about making choices. The concept\nincorporates three interrelated dimensions namely, agency,2\nresources,3 and achievements4 that lead to manifestation of\npower5 in the presence of choices.6 Therefore, in the context\nof older adults, autonomy in decision making reflects the\npower. Another important aspect from the perspective of\nwell-being of older adults is the integration of older adults\nwith the household. It shows the acceptability of the older\nadults in the household and vice versa in a co-residence type\nof living arrangement. Co-residence is the most frequent liv-\ning arrangement among the older adults in India (National\ninvestigation into integration and its associated aspects may\nprovide useful insights into this aspect of well-being of older\nadults. The issues concerning empowerment and integration\namong the older adults in India are yet to be addressed.\nDuring older ages, the risk of a change in the marital sta-\ntus, from married to widowed, is very high. Furthermore,\nphysical mobility is at stake and vulnerabilities to chronic\nhealth conditions are also very common. It is apprehended\nthat, on account of financial, social, economic, and health\nvulnerabilities, the older adults may be susceptible to abuses\nof various types.\nThe preceding sections discuss various aspects of well-\nbeing of the older adults. These aspects may exhibit gender\ndifferentials especially in those social setups where the gen-\nder inequality is known to prevail at comparatively younger\nages. The reasons being that the older women in traditional\nsocieties were never a part of the workforce and, therefore,\ntheir continuous financial dependence during the life course\nmay be detrimental to their well-being at older ages.\nMoreover, their social status has association with their mari-\ntal status and having a son (Vlassoff, 1990). Although, gen-\nder issues pertaining to the non-older adults are well\naddressed in recent literature (Bhattacharya, 2006; Devi,\n1988), quantitative studies pertaining to the older adults are\nrare.\nAs distinguished from the macro (population based) and\nmicro (individual based) perspectives of aging, the third per-\nspective concerns the changing composition of the house-\nholds. This is a semi-macro perspective that considers aging\nfrom the level of households. Households are residential\nunits. Within households, the family members live in physi-\ncal proximity. A household may not have residing older\nadults (say, Type I) or it may have residing older adults. For\nthe households with residing older adults there may be co-\nresident younger people (say, Type II) or there may not be\nco-resident younger people (say, Type III). The Type II and\nBakshi and Pathak 3\nthe Type III kinds of households are, respectively, called the\nco-residence and the alone types of living arrangements\nThe co-residence is viewed as one type of the various\ntypes of IGTs (Velkoff, 2000). Aging may alter the distribu-\ntion of the household types. It is expected that in an aging\nsociety, the proportion of Type II and Type III combined may\nincrease over time and the proportion of Type I may decrease\nover time. Furthermore, among Type II and Type III house-\nholds, the proportion of Type III may increase over time and\nType II may decrease over time. It is also possible that the\nproportion of older adults in Type II households may increase\nover time. In these ways the aging of households takes place.\nFrom the preceding discussion, it is apparent that work,\nfinancial independence, capacity to make choices, integra-\ntion with the household, and health are some of the factors\nthat are instrumental to the well-being of the older adults. In\naddition, the gender and the marital status may be responsi-\nble for the differentials in the well-being. The motivation for\nthe present work has been on two accounts. First, the exiting\nliterature on older adults in India lacks an integrated approach\nto address different but important aspects of well-being.\nSecond, studies based on countrywide and time-varying rep-\nresentative samples are few. The present study is an attempt\nto fill this gap. The specific issues to be investigated are\ngiven as follows:\n1. to provide a descriptive account of aging in India\nfrom macro, semi-macro, and micro perspectives;\n2. to assess the working and financial dependence of the\nolder adults and the support from and to the older\nadults;\n3. to assess the state of power, the state of integration,\nand the correlates of elder abuse among the older\nadults; and\n4. to provide a situational analysis of the Type I, Type\nII, and Type III households.\nData and Method\nThe trends in the proportion of older adults and the old age\ndependency ratio (OADR) are utilized for describing the\nmacro aspects of aging. Let F denote the distribution func-\ntion of age in a given population, at a given time. 1 60\n- F( )\ngives the proportion of older adults in the population. The\nOADR is defined as ( ( )) / ( ( ) ( ))\n- -\nF F F . For an\naging population, the values of these indicators form an\nincreasing sequence over time. Apart from these indicators,\nthe absolute number of older adults, the average person years\nof older males and older females, and the sex ratio have been\nutilized to portray the aging in India. For these purposes, data\nutilized. The following sections describe the concepts and\nmethods utilized to investigate the micro aspects of aging.\nOADR, as a measure of dependency, assumes that all\nolder adults shall be dependent on adults (people aged\n15-59). However, the fact remains that people work even at\nolder ages. Older adults are working or non-working.\nTherefore, the work activity and its variation with age of the\nolder adults need to be investigated. Older adults may be\nfinancially independent, partially dependent, or completely\ndependent. More so, association may exist between the\nfinancial dependence and employment. Considering working\nand dependence as ordinal variables, gamma (Agresti, 1990)\nhas been utilized to investigate the association between the\ntwo. Furthermore, the variation of financial dependence with\nage is investigated.\nApart from an earning through an employment, assets,\nand property are resources that may contribute to the finan-\ncial independence of the older adults. These resources may\nhave been acquired by an older adult during her or his life-\ntime prior to the older adulthood. The quantum of assets and\nproperty owned by an older adult may affect her or his finan-\ncial dependence at older ages. A multinomial logit regression\nmodel is utilized for investigating the association of financial\ndependence with owing assets and owing property. The\nmodel is given as As P E R G Ag\n+ + + + + , where As, P, E,\nR, G, and Ag denote the factors assets, property, employment\nstatus, place of residence, gender, and age group, respec-\ntively. Due to the absence of information on the quantum of\nassets/property owned by an older adult, we limit ourselves\nto incorporating these variables as binary variables with two\ncategories having and not having.\nAs discussed in the preceding sections, employment,\nproperty, and assets are means and resources available with\nthe older adults to overcome their financial dependence.\nHowever, possessing of assets and/or property may not be\nconducive to financial independence of the older adult unless\nthe older adults have the capacity to manage their owned\nasset7 and/or property. Furthermore, this capacity may be\nconditioned by the age, gender, and the marital status of an\nolder adult. The age\u00adpower relationship is investigated\nthrough age group\u00adspecific proportions of older males and\nolder females who are managing their owned assets and\nowned properties. The gender differentials in power are\ndepicted through the odds ratios for older males versus older\nfemales. Similarly, the association of marital status and\npower is depicted through the odds ratios for currently mar-\nried versus widowed among older males and older females.\nThe participation of older adults in household matters\nindicates involvement and hence integration of the older\nadults with household. This can be assessed in case of co-\nresidence type of living arrangements where the older adults\nreside with younger ones. The indicators of integration, as\navailable in the 42nd and 52nd rounds of the National Sample\nSurvey (NSS), are participation in the social8 matters, the\nreligious9 matters, and the daily household chores (DHC).\nThe associations of the indicators of integration with age,\ngender, and marital status have been investigated using mea-\nsures similar to that described in the preceding section.\nThis study takes up the issue of elder abuse by utilizing\nthe Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing in India\n4 SAGE Open\n(BKPAI) survey, 2011. The BKPAI survey classifies elder\nabuse into physical abuse10 (PA), verbal abuse11 (VA), eco-\nnomic abuse12 (EA), showing disrespect13 (SD), and neglect14\n(NE). Logistic regression models given as G A M D\n+ + + ,\nwhere G, A, M, and D denote the factors gender, age group,\nmarital status, and state of financial independence, respec-\ntively, are utilized to investigate the association of these fac-\ntors with different types of abuses. An effect in a model is\nconsidered significant if the p values corresponding to the\neffects are .1 or lesser. The data on elder abuse pertains to the\nstates of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha,\nMaharashtra, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu in India. Therefore,\nany inferences pertaining to elder abuse may not be general-\nized to the whole of the older adult population of India.\nThe following section addresses the semi-macro aspect of\naging including the composition of households, the eco-\nnomic condition of different type of households, and mea-\nsures of the aging for the Type II households.\nIn the preceding sections, a classification of households\nas Type I, Type II, and Type II was introduced. This classifi-\ncation is based on the composition of households vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe older adults. The change in composition of household\ntypes is indicated by the change in proportion of their types.\nThe following two measures are defined to quantify the\naging of the Type II households:\nhousehold old age dependency ratio =\nnumber of older\nadults i\nin a household\nnumber of adults\naged - in a household\n( )\n,\nh\nnumber of young ones\nage\nousehold young dependency ratio =\n( d\nd - in a household\nnumber of adults\naged - in a hou\n)\n( ) s\nsehold\n.\nThe geometric mean is used as an average for these\nmeasures. It should be noted that the value of house-\nhold old age dependency ratio (HOADR) is 0 for a Type I\nhousehold and more than 0 for Type II household. Its\nvalue is undefined for Type III households. Two measures\nare used to assess the economic conditions of the different\ntypes of households.\nTo assess the economic conditions prevailing in different\ntypes of households, the median of household monthly\nexpenditure per person (MHME) and multidimensional pov-\nerty index (MPI) have been utilized. Specifically, the ratio of\nMHME for Type I/Type III with respect to MHME for Type\nII, for a given reference period, has been utilized. This is to\ncontrol for the effect of the inflation over the time.\nThe MPI has been calculated based on the human devel-\nopment reports (United Nations Development Programme\n[UNDP],2011). However, the numbers of indicators that are\nincorporated to evaluate MPI vary for the reference periods.\nThis is to incorporate maximum information available on the\nindicators of household prosperity during a given reference\nperiod. Thus, for calculating the MPI, two, four, and five\nindicators have been used for the reference periods 1986-\npurpose, a household is said to be deprived if it is lacking in\nany one of the selected indicators under consideration at a\ngiven time period. The study does not attempt to provide any\nestimates of the standard errors for the statistics MPI, house-\nhold young dependency ratio (HYDR), HOADR, and\nMHME. It is assumed that the large sample sizes would pro-\nduce estimates for these statistics that are accurate enough\nfor a general discussion. Nevertheless, bootstrap estimates of\nstandard errors may be suggested for such arduous statistics.\nThe computations were carried out on R (R Core Team,\nIn addition to the data from census and BKPAI survey, the\npresent study utilizes data from various rounds of the NSS.\nThese surveys were conducted during the period July 1986 to\nand 13,344 households, respectively, with residing older\nadults. Although, the information content of each of the sur-\nvey differs in some aspects from the other, similar definitions\nare used for all the three surveys.\nResults\nThe number of older adults enumerated in the censuses of\ntively. Corresponding to these census years their proportions\nin the population were .06 and .09, respectively (Table 2).\nThe number as well as the proportion of the older adults\nshow a monotonically increasing trend over the census years.\nFurthermore, a rising OADR, that characterizes an aging\npopulation, is visible in the Indian population. Older females\nTable 1.

It was in the\n2011 census, the sex ratio among older adults was in favor of\nthe older males.\nEmpirical evidences from the three rounds of NSS indi-\ncate that a substantial percentage of older males are\nemployed. The sample percentages of working older males\nfemales are mostly engaged in attending domestic duties.\nThe sample percentage of older females reporting attending\nthe proportion of working older adults falls with increasing\nage (Figure 1). Nevertheless, being in workforce has a posi-\ntive association with financial independence. This is due to a\npositive, high (>.81) and significant value of gamma for all\nthe reference periods (Table 6). This may be the reason for\nthe increasing number of financially dependent older adults\nat higher ages (Table 7).\nThe effects of having property on the financial indepen-\ndence of older adults, while controlling for employment,\nage, gender and place of residence, are found to be posi-\ntive. A similar kind of association is observed between\nhaving assets and financial independence. The positivity is\nin the sense that the estimated odds, in favor of being\nfinancially independent (when compared with being finan-\ncially dependent), are 1.15 times higher for those older\nadults who possess assets when compared with those older\nadults who do not possess assets. Similarly, the estimated\nodds in favor of being financially independent are 2.06\ntimes higher for those older adults who possess property\nwhen compared with those older adults who do not possess\ntively (Table 8). Similarly, the estimated odds in favor of\nbeing partially independent (when compared with being\nfinancially dependent) are 1.28 times higher for those\nolder adults who possess assets when compared with those\nolder adults who do not possess assets. Similarly, the esti-\nmated odds in favor of being partially independent are 1.52\ntimes higher for those older adults who possess property\nwhen compared with those older adults who do not possess\ntively (Table 9).\nCensus year\nNo. of older\nadults\nAverage person\nyears for males\nAverage person\nyears for females\nProportion of the\nolder adults in the\npopulation of India\nOld-age\ndependency ratio\nSex ratio among\nolder adults (per\nSource.

Most of the financially dependent older\nmales are supported by their children (Figure 2). Similar to\nthe state of financial independence, the state of power too\nshows association with age, gender, and marital status of the\nolder adults.\nEmpirical evidences indicate that the proportion of the\nolder adults who are engaged in managing their owned\nproperties and assets reduces with an increase in their age\n(Figures 3 and 4). It is also evident from the figures that,\nwhen compared with the older males, the older females\nengage themselves lesser in these matters.

Older females are\ntimes more likely to face EA and NE, respectively, when\ncompared with older males.

Older\nadults who are financially dependent and partially dependent\nindependent counterparts to face abuse. The following\nsections provide a situational analysis of the three types of\nhouseholds defined earlier.\nThe estimates of the proportion of Type I, Type II, and\nType III households show an increase in the proportion of\nType II and Type III combined (Table 16). This increase is\nexperienced in rural as well as urban areas. In other words,\nthere is an increase in households with older adults over the\nholds with older adults, the ratio of co-residence to alone\ntype of households has decreased in urban areas from 11.50\nThe statistics regarding HOADR and HYDR for Type II\nhouseholds (Table 18) indicate that there is a rise in mean\nHOADR in rural and urban areas over the time. During the\nsame period, it is observed that the average HYDR has\ndeclined over the time. This holds for both the rural and the\nurban areas. Values of the average HOADR and the average\nHYDR are found to be higher in rural areas when compared\nwith those in the urban areas for all reference periods.\nThe values for the ratio of MHME for Type I/Type III\nwith respect to MHME for Type II, for the three reference\nperiods are described in Table 19. The alone type of house-\nholds have a higher MHME when compared with the co-\nresidence type of households for all the given reference\nTable 13.

The\nhouseholds without older adults when compared with the co-\nresidence type of households do not differ with respect to the\nMHME but they are found to be more deprived than the co-\nresidence type of households. Let us now consider the eco-\nnomic condition of the three types of households in terms of\ndeprivation with respect to selected indicators. Keeping in\nview that the MPIs are not comparable across time periods,\nsome salient observations (Table 20) regarding the three\ntypes of households are presented. Older adults having alone\ntype of living arrangements are more deprived than people\nresiding in co-residence type of households. This holds for\nrural as well as urban areas for all the time periods consid-\nered. People residing in Type I households are more deprived\nthan people living in co-residence type of households.\nHowever, they are less deprived when compared with older\nadults having alone type of living arrangements.\nDiscussion\nThe foregoing analyses provide a three-tier description of\naging in India. The three tiers of aging are the aging indi-\nvidual, the aging household, and the aging population. The\nutility of a three-tier approach to aging is that it may help\nformulating a three pronged policy to address various types\nof challenges imposed by aging. The policies need to simul-\ntaneously address the older adults, the families that have\nolder adults as their members, and the population.\nThis study is primarily based on three countrywide repre-\nsentative data sets of the NSS. The periods, pertaining to\n2004. However, throughout this period similar patterns are\nobserved regarding the work, the integration, and the empow-\nerment among the older adults.\nA change in work status, a change in marital status, and\nsusceptibility to chronic conditions are quiet possible for an\nindividual at older ages (Figure 8). The findings indicate\nthat the life of an older adult is not immune to such changes.\nThe married older adults are found to be more participating\nTable 15.

They are also more likely to be\ndecision makers than their widow counterparts. Gender dif-\nferential prevails in the matters pertaining to exercising\npower in financial matters and participation in household\naffairs. The older males are in relatively better position\n(Figure 8). Rajan (2010) has opined that the disadvantaged\nstatus of older females vis-\u00e0-vis the ownership of financial\nassets/property is due to limited implementation of inheri-\ntance laws. These differentials may be attributed to the\nsocial construct of the Indian society. The family and the\nsociety need to be educated on these issues so that these dif-\nferentials cease to exist.\nThere is also a need to sensitize public to uphold the dig-\nnity of the older adults. This is so because different types of\nabuses are reported by the older adults. Older women and\nfinancially dependent older adults are more likely to face\nabuses. It is recently that such information is being made\navailable in large-scale surveys in India. Nevertheless, the\nNSSs need to incorporate this crucial information in their\nsurveys on the older adults. It is also desired that country-\nwide information on social and economic aspects of the older\nadults be made available more frequently and in greater\ndetail through the NSSs. This is because the rounds of the\nBakshi and Pathak 15\nFigure 8.

Therefore, the need for financial sup-\nport is greater among those older adults who are at the higher\nend of the age spectrum. If fact, the older females need it the\nmost. Although, various old age pensions schemes are in\neffect, in Indian states, the adequacy of the pension amount\nin ensuring financial independence needs to be periodically\nassessed. The pensions need to be enhanced with increasing\nage of the older adults. Meeting the financial needs through\na judicious combination of public and familial transfers may\nprovide a viable solution.\nAlone kind of living arrangements is found to be increas-\ning among the older adults. Furthermore, the share of younger\nones is declining in the co-residence type of living arrange-\nments. According to Velkoff (2000), these changes are\nresponses to the trends in fertility, mortality, and migration\nthat impact on family size and household structure. The\nadults in a household are potential care providers to the older\nadults. However, if this trend persists, an alternative structure\nfor providing care to the older adults may be required. In\nother words, care needs to be available at the doorsteps of the\nolder adults.\nAnother crucial aspect is the relatively deprived condition\nof the older adults in the alone type of living arrangements. It\nmay be possible that their higher expenditure may be respon-\nsible for this deprivation. The higher expenditures observed\namong the households with alone type of living arrange-\nments may be due to the costs incurred in maintaining sound\nhealth at older ages. Potential of alternative systems of health\ncare and medicine, that are cost effective, may lessen the\nfinancial burden of ill health at the older ages. Focused in-\ndepth studies are called for to understand and address the\nreasons for relative deprivation in alone kind of living\narrangements. Unlike the older adults living alone, the co-\nresidents have a relatively lesser deprived life. The reason\nmay be that the resources get shared in a co-residence type of\nliving arrangement. This also results in a lower cost of living.\nA policy on living arrangements is desired that promotes co-\nresidence on one hand and a housing policy for older adults\nwho opt for alone type of living arrangements on the other.\nThe signs of aging are evident in the population of India.\nTo put it in simple terms, the proportion and number of peo-\nple in higher age groups is gradually increasing. In this per-\nspective, a policy on population is called for so that the social\nsystem may be able to manage aging. The bottom line\nremains that no society can afford aging of its population to\ncontinue so as to reach an unmanageable extent. More so, the\npopulation policies that address the macro perspectives and\nwelfare policies for older adults are individual centric.\nInvolvement of the family, through an integrated family-cen-\ntric policy, may better ensure the well-being of the older\nadults.\n"
