In Puerto Rico, number of chronic medical conditions explained\nthe effect of marital status on subjective health. In Costa Rica, Argentina, Barbados, Cuba,\nand Uruguay, number of chronic medical conditions explained gender disparities in subjective\nhealth. In China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Chile, India, Ghana and South Africa, number of\nchronic medical conditions did not explain the effect of demographic or socioeconomic factors\non subjective health.\nConclusions: Multimorbidity explains the effect of demographic and socioeconomic factors\non subjective health in some but not other countries.

Gendered\nlabor market may result in lower stable employment\namong women.[11] Among those in the labor market,\nwomen's pensions are lower than men's.[21,22] Women\nmore frequently live in poverty than older men.[23]\nWomen also have lower access to health care resources\nwhile also requiring more care in later life than men.[24]\nDue to gender difference in longevity, a larger part of\nwomen's life is spent with illness and disabilities.[25]\nThird, older women are more likely to be widowed than\nolder men.[23] In the United States, nearly four times\nas many older women than men live alone.[24] Finally,\ndue to gender differences in response sets, women may\nhave a higher tendency to report negative feelings and\nMultimorbidity  defined as multiple chronic medical\nconditionsis an important predictor of subjective\nhealth,[11] as people with higher number of chronic\nmedical conditions report lower physical and mental\nhealthrelated quality of life (HRQL).[2729] In one\nstudy, chronic medical conditions had a consistent\ndosedependent effect on all aspects of wellbeing,\nnamely physical functioning, role limitation due to\nphysical health problems, bodily pain, general health,\nvitality, social functioning, role limitation due to\nemotional problems and mental health.[30] Another\nstudy in the United States showed that any additional\nchronic medical condition leads to 3\u00ad4 decrements of\nmental quality of life decline.[31] Another study among\nof one chronic condition and lower wellbeing across\nall subjective health domains including physical\nfunction, fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and social\nfunction. The presence of two or more morbidities was\nassociated with a larger decrement in HRQL, compared\nto a single condition.[32] Another large study of adults\nshowed that after adjustments for SES, and health\nbehaviors (i.e., smoking, alcohol consumption, and\nphysical activity), people with 3 or more chronic medical\nconditions are more likely to report poor general health,\nmental distress, physical distress, and activity limitations\ncompared to individuals who have one or two chronic\nDespite our knowledge about crosscountry differences in\nhealth and wellbeing,[710] it is not clear if countries are\nalso different in the mechanisms by which demographic\n(i.e., age and gender), and socioeconomic (e.g., income\nand education) influence health, and if chronic medical\nconditions explain some of health disparities associated\nwith low SES.[16] Research on Early Life and Aging Trends\nand Effects (RELATE) has provided a unique opportunity\nfor crosscountry studies on socioeconomic, chronic medical\nconditions and subjective health among the elderly. The\nRELATE is a crossnational survey in 15 countries located\nin North America, South America, Asia, and Africa.[35,36]\nUsing RELATE data, this study compared 15 countries\nfor the mediating effect of multimorbidity (defined as\nnumber of chronic medical conditions) on the effects\nof demographic and socioeconomic characteristics on\nself rated health.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and participants\nData came from the RELATE, a study composed of the\nfollowing national surveys: (1) China Health and Nutrition\nStudy (CHNS), (2) Chinese Longitudinal Healthy\nLongevity Survey, (3) Costa Rican Study of Longevity and\nHealthy Aging, (4) Puerto Rican Elderly: Health Conditions,\n(5) Study of Aging Survey on Health and Wellbeing of\nElders, (6) WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult\nHealth, and (7) Wisconsin Longitudinal Study.[35,36]\nParticipants were sampled in the following 15 countries:\nFrom the participating countries, Barbados, Puerto\nRico and the United States represent highincome\ncountries; Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay, Chile, Costa\nRica, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia represent upper\nmiddleincome countries; China and India represent\nlower middleincome countries; and Ghana represents\na lowincome country. Thus, the RELATE project\nrepresented countries from a diverse range in national\nincome levels.\nMeasures\nDemographic characteristics\nThe study collected data on age (continuous variable)\nand gender (dichotomous variable).\nSocioeconomic characteristics\nThe study also measured the following socioeconomic\nfactors: Education level (fourlevel categorical variable\nof no schooling, primary to elementary, secondary to\nintermediate, and higher), household income (continuous\nvariable), and marital status (dichotomous variable of\nmarried and other statuses).\nMultimorbidity\nWe measured multimorbidity as number of chronic\nmedical conditions. Chronic medical conditions were\nmeasured based on selfreported physician diagnosis of\nseven conditions (i.e., hypertension, cancer, pulmonary\ndisease, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis). The\nmultimorbidity score potentially ranged from 0 to 7, with\na higher score indicative of the higher number of chronic\nmedical conditions. The agreement between selfreport\nand physician diagnosis of chronic medical conditions has\nMain outcome\nThe outcome was subjective health (selfrated health),\nwhich was measured using a singleitem. Although it was\nmeasured using a five Likert scale (i.e., very bad health,\nbad, moderate, good, very good), we collapsed the scale\nto a dichotomous outcome: Poor health (very bad health,\nbad health) versus good health (moderate health, good\nhealth, very good health).\nSingleitem measures of subjective health and wellbeing\nhave been frequently used and are well accepted.[3846]\nTestretest reliability for singleitem is high for brief time\nintervals, with a range from 0.7 to 0.8.[42] Validation studies\nhave consistently shown surprisingly high correlations\nbetween singleitem indicators and multiitem measures\nof perceived health.[42] Singleitem measures of selfrated\nhealth also have high predictive validity for mortality\nabove and beyond traditional risk factors.[47]\nData analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted using  SPSS 20.0\nfor Windows (IBM Inc. Armonk, NY). We used\ncountryspecific logistic regressions to determine if\nthe effects of demographic (i.e., age and gender) and\nsocioeconomic (i.e., education, income, and marital\nstatus) factors vary across countries or not.\nWe also tested if number of chronic medical conditions\ndifferently explains the links between demographic and\nsocioeconomic factors and subjective health. Although\nmost countryspecific surveys had sampling weights, the\ncurrent study did not apply sampling weights, because\nsampling weights were not applicable to data from United\nStates (Wisconsin) and China (CHNS).\nMediation analysis\nFor this purpose, we used hierarchical regression approach.\nIn Model I, only demographic and socioeconomic factors\nwere included. In Model II, we also entered number of\nchronic physical conditions. Changes in the regression\ncoefficients of demographic and socioeconomic factors\nfrom significant to nonsignificant association was defined\nas full mediation.[48]\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows that mean age, education, income, and\nnumber of chronic medical conditions were significantly\ndifferent across countries.\nModel I\nBased on Model I, high age was associated with better\nsubjective health in China, Costa Rica and Argentina.\nHigh age was associated with poor subjective health\nin Barbados, India, South Africa and Russia. Age and\nsubjective health were not significantly associated In\nPuerto Rico, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Cuba\nand Uruguay [Table 2].\nFemale gender was associated with worse subjective\nhealth in China, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Barbados, Cuba\nand Uruguay. Gender was not associated with subjective\nhealth in other countries [Table 2].\nIn the US, Ghana and South Africa, education was\nnot associated with subjective health High education\nwas associated with high subjective health in all other\ncountries [Table 2].\nSurprisingly, high income was associated with poor\nsubjective health in Ghana. In Argentina, Chile, Cuba,\nUruguay and South Africa, income was not associated\nwith subjective health. In other countries, highincome\nwas associated with better subjective health [Table 2].\nBeing currently married was associated with better\nsubjective health in Mexico. Being currently married was\nassociated with worse subjective health in Costa Rica,\nPuerto Rico, and Brazil. Marital status was not associated\nwith subjective health in other countries [Table 2].\nModel II\nThe number of chronic conditions explained the\nassociation between gender and subjective health in Costa\nRica, Argentina, Barbados, Cuba, Uruguay. In these 5\ncountries, the significant association between gender and\nsubjective health became nonsignificant after introducing\nthe number of chronic conditions to the model [Table 3].\nIn the US, number of chronic conditions explained the\nassociation between income and subjective health. That\nsaid, the association between income and subjective\nhealth that was significant in the previous model did not\nremain significant after entering number of conditions to\nthe model [Table 3].\nIn Puerto Rico, number of conditions explained the\nassociation between marital status and subjective health.\nThat said, the association between marital status and\nsubjective health that was significant in the absence of\nnumber of chronic conditions in the previous model did\nnot stay significant after entering this variable to the\nmodel. Interestingly, after entering number of conditions\nto the model, the nonsignificant association between age\nand subjective health became statistically significant.\nThis finding suggests that number of conditions may\nhave a suppressor effect on age \u00ad subjective health\nassociation [Table 3].\nIn China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Chile, India, Ghana, and\nSouth Africa, number of chronic medical conditions did\nnot fully explain the associations between demographic\nand SES and subjective health. In other words, in these\ncountries, the associations between demographic and\nSES factors and subjective health were above and beyond\nnumber of chronic medical conditions [Table 3].\nDISCUSSION\nThis study documented major crosscountry differences\nin the role of multimorbidity \u00ad defined as number\nof chronic medical conditions - in explaining the\nassociations between demographic and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics and subjective health. In Costa Rica,\nArgentina, Barbados, Cuba, and Uruguay, number of\nchronic medical conditions explain the association\nbetween gender and subjective health. In the United\nStates number of chronic medical conditions explained\nthe association between income and subjective health.\nIn Puerto Rico, they explain the association between\nmarital status and subjective health. In China, Mexico,\nBrazil, Russia, Chile, India, Ghana and South Africa,\nnumber of conditions do not explain the associations\nbetween SES and subjective health. These findings\nsuggest that mechanisms for the effects of demographic\nand socioeconomic factors on self rated health may vary\nacross countries.\nWomen reported worse self rated health only in\nsix countries (i.e. China, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico,\nBarbados, Cuba and Uruguay), and in Costa Rica,\nArgentina, Barbados, Cuba, and Uruguay, chronic\nconditions explained such an association. Literature\nhas consistently shown gender differences in health and\nwellbeing.[19] Although some researchers have attributed\nthe effect of gender on perceived health to income,[2123]\nand marital status,[23,24] the effect of gender on self rated\nhealth was above and beyond these SES factors in our\nstudy. Research has shown that women report higher\nnumber of chronic conditions and poorer health,[19] and\nwe found that higher rate of multimorbidity may be the\nreason female gender is associated with poor selfrated\nhealth, at least in some countries in South America.\nMultimorbidity had a suppressor effect on the association\nbetween age and self rated health in Puerto Rico. That is,\nonly after controlling for number of chronic conditions,\nthe association between age and self rated health became\nsignificant. This finding has important implications for\nfuture research on age effect on subjective health in\nPuerto Rico. The inclusion of a suppressor to a regression\nequation is known to enhances the relationship between\nsubjective health and age in this country by removing\nthe unwanted variance from the predictor variable.[49] In\nother words, in Puerto Rico, studies that wish to test the\nassociation between age and wellbeing need to control\nfor number of conditions not as a mediator, but as a\nsuppressor.\nWith an exception of only three countries (i.e. United\nStates, Ghana and South Africa), education was\nassociated with a better subjective health. United States,\nGhana, and South Africa were the three countries where\neducation did not independently predict self rated health.\nIn some countries, the effect of education on health and\nwellbeing may be due to income or marital status,[50]\nwhich were both controlled in our study.\nIn nine countries including the United States, high\nincome was associated with better self rated health.\nSurprisingly, high income was found to be associated with\npoor subjective health in Ghana. In five other countries,\nincome was not associated with self rated health. Why\nincome does not have a protective effect on perceived\nhealth in Ghana, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Uruguay, and\nSouth Africa needs more research.\nTable 1: Comparison of demographic and socioeconomic factors among participants in each country\nChina Costa\nRica\nPuerto\nRico\nUnited\nStates\nMexico Argentina Barbados Brazil Chile Cuba Uruguay India Ghana South\nAfrica\nRussia P*\nNumber\nof CMCs\n*ANOVA.

Thus, countries may differ\non how social and health factors confound, mediate, or\nsuppress the effects of demographic and socioeconomic\nfactors on health and well-being. There is empirical\nevidence suggesting that the complex interrelation\nbetween socioeconomics, chronic medical conditions, and\nInterestingly, number of chronic medical conditions did\nnot fully explain the effect of age on subjective health\nin any of the 15 countries. Age and subjective health\nwere differently linked across countries, as well. In three\ncountries (i.e. China, Costa Rica and Argentina), high age\nwas associated with better subjective health, while in four\ncountries (i.e. Barbados, India, South Africa and Russia),\nhigh age was associated with low subjective health.\nInterestingly, in seven other countries (i.e. Puerto Rico,\nUnited States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Cuba and Uruguay),\nthere was no linear association between age and subjective\nhealth. There are studies reporting a positive net effect of\nage on wellbeing among the elderly.[51,52]\nThe number of chronic medical conditions explained\nthe association between marital status and subjective\nhealth in Puerto Rico. Being currently married was\nassociated with better subjective health in Mexico. The\nsame status was linked to worse subjective health in three\nother countries (i.e. Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Brazil).\nMarital status was not associated with subjective health\nin the other 11 countries. The two main hypotheses\nexplaining health effects of marital status are marriage\nprotection and marriage selection.[5355] None of these\ntheories, however, have hypothesized being married as a\nrisk factor for health. More research is needed to find out\nwhy married people do worse in Costa Rica, Puerto Rico,\nand Brazil.\nLimitations\nThere are a number of limitations to consider. First,\nthe study was a crosssectional study, and causative\nassociations are not plausible. In addition, cross \u00ad country\ndifferences in the validity of chronic medical conditions\nmeasurement and even subjective health cannot be\nruled out. The study did not measure mental health as\na predictor of selfrated health. Exclusion of individuals\nwith a mental disorder limits generalizability of the\nfindings to the populations. The study also ignores the\ntype of chronic conditions, as only number of conditions\nwere included in the models.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo conclude, our study suggests crosscountry differences\nin the way number of chronic medical conditions may\nexplain the effects of demographic and socioeconomic\nfactors on subjective health.\n"
