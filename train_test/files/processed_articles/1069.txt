    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We evaluated the distribution and abundance of feral honey bee, Apis mellifera L.,\ncolonies in a coastal prairie landscape by examining nest site characteristics, population trends, and\nspatial and temporal patterns in cavity use. The colony densities of up to 12.5 colonies per km2 were\nthe highest reported in the literature for an area including both suitable and unsuitable patches of\nnesting habitat. The measured cavity attributes were similar to those reported from other areas. The\ntime occupied and turnover indices provided useful information about cavity quality, although none\nof the measured cavity attributes were correlated with these indices. Unmeasurable cavity charac-\nteristics, such as cavity volume, may provide a better estimate of cavity quality. Spatial patterns existed\nin cavity use by the feral colonies, with the colonies showing an aggregated pattern of distribution\nthroughout the study. Colony aggregations probably resulted from the distribution of resources,\nespecially cavities. Two years after the arrival of Africanized honey bees, cavities used by Africanized\nand European colonies were aggregated in distribution. During what seemed to be a transition period,\nboth Africanized and European colonies were randomly distributed. After that time, European\ncolonies remained randomly distributed, whereas Africanized colonies were aggregated. Therefore,\nthe invasion of Africanized honey bees seemed to fragment the existing European population,\ncorresponding to a decrease in the overall number of European colonies in the study area.\n",

We studied feral colonies\non the Welder Wildlife Refuge (San Patricio County,\nTX) over an 8-yr period, during which Africanized\nhoney bees arrived and became established in the\narea.

The study site was located\non the Welder Wildlife Refuge (San Patricio County,\nTexas), where Africanized honey bees were \u00derst re-\nconsisted of 6.25 km2 of coastal prairie located in the\nwestern one-quarter of the refuge. The landscape was\ndominatedbyfourvegetationcommunitiesthatvaried\nin the availability of important resources necessary for\nthe survival, growth, and reproduction of feral colo-\nnies (Baum 2003). Cavities were abundant in the live\noak and riparian woodland habitat patches but scarce\nin the brushland and grassland habitat patches.

However, the grassland habitat\npatches were an important source of pollen and nectar\nColony Density. The study area was surveyed for\nveys were conducted by evaluating the status of cav-\nities identi\u00deed during previous surveys to contain feral\nhoney bees. We also searched for new cavities and\ncolonies by inspecting all trees within the study area\nfor honey bees (foragers leaving or returning to a\ncolony) during periods of high honey bee activity.\nDuring this 8-yr period, 109 cavities containing a feral\ncolony during at least one survey were identi\u00deed. The\ndensity of feral colonies per square kilometer during\neach year was calculated based on yearly cavity sur-\nveys. The presence (active cavity) or absence (inac-\ntive cavity) of feral colonies in the identi\u00deed cavities\nwas recorded. Cavities were often surveyed multiple\ntimes during any given year, so the status (active or\ninactive) of each cavity during the survey from each\nyear with the most active cavities was used for the\ncalculations. The number of cavities surveyed in-\ncreased through time as new cavities used by feral\nhoney bee colonies were found. Densities are re-\nbefore 1995 are probably underestimated because\n30% of the cavities surveyed were found by then.\nCavity Attributes. Most of the feral colonies in the\nstudy area were located in tree cavities. Therefore, we\ncollected detailed measurements for each cavity, in-\ncluding number of entrances, entrance orientation,\nentrance size, cavity height, tree species, tree diam-\neter at breast height (dbh), tree height, basal area,\ncanopy closure, ground cover, habitat type, and motte\nsize.Mottesareclustersofwoodyvegetationthatform\naround a nucleus (in this case a live oak tree, Quercus\nvirginiana P. Miller) and may eventually expand and\ncoalesce into a contiguous area of woody vegetation.\nEntrance number and tree species were obtained by\nvisual inspection. Entrance orientation was recorded\nusing a compass. The width and height of each cavity\nentrance were measured with a tape measure or es-\ntimated in centimeters when it was not possible to\nreach the cavity entrance. Entrance width and height\nwere then converted into entrance area based on the\narea of an ellipse. Cavity height was measured in m\nfrom ground level by using a tape measure or visually\nestimated for high cavities. The dbh was calculated in\ncentimeters by using a Spencer Original LoggersTape.\nTree height was recorded in meters by using a Suunto\nclinometer with 15- and 20-m scales. Basal area was\nobtained using the \u00deve-factor option of a JIM-GEM\nCruz-All. Canopy closure and ground cover (sepa-\nrated into monocot and dicot) were estimated at 10 m\nfrom the cavity tree in the four Cardinal directions.\nEstimates of percentage of cover were made by look-\ning through a 5-cm-diameter by 10.5-cm-long hollow\ntube divided into four quadrants. Percentage of can-\nopy closure and ground cover were averaged across all\ndirections to obtain an overall value for each cavity\ntree. Habitat type was identi\u00deed from a landscape\nclassi\u00decation of the study area based on vegetation\ncommunities, and motte size was obtained from a\nspatial database of the study area with a resolution of\nmotte were digitized in ArcView GIS 3.2, and the area\nof the resulting polygons was calculated using an ex-\ntension (area calculation for polygon) in ArcView GIS\n3.2.Mottesizewasonlymeasuredforliveoaksbecause\nnone of the other cavity tree species formed distinct\nmottes.\nCavity characteristics were evaluated in terms of\ntime occupied and turnover indices calculated for\neach cavity. Time occupied refers to the proportion of\nthe time surveyed that a cavity was active, whereas\nturnover re\u00dfects the number of changes in cavity\nstatus from active to inactive or inactive to active\nduring consecutive surveys. Therefore, these indices\nprovide an estimate of cavity quality based on honey\nbee use. Only cavities identi\u00deed by 1995 were in-\ncluded in the analyses because the values for cavities\nsurveyed only a few times may be biased, and 80% of\ncavities had been found by then. For example, a cavity\nsurveyed only once (\u00derst identi\u00deed during the most\nrecent survey) would be occupied 100% of the time\nwith 0% turnover.\nSpatial and Temporal Patterns. The spatial coordi-\nnates for each cavity tree used by feral colonies during\nthe 8-yr study period were recorded to a submeter\naccuracy by using a Trimble GPS Path\u00dender receiver\nand TSC1 Asset Surveyor data logger. When cavities\nwere located in areas with dense canopy cover, an\nAdvantage Laser Range\u00dender was used to calculate\nthe offset from the cavity to where spatial coordinates\nwere obtained.\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Analysis. mtDNA is\nmaternally inherited and does not recombine during\nsexual reproduction, passing directly from queen to\noffspring. Thus, mtDNA provides a historical perspec-\ntive on the invasion of Africanized honey bees, high-\nlighting what happened to the existing and invading\ncolonies and their subsequent offspring (Schneider et\nal. 2004). Within our study site, the pattern of mtDNA\nis closely followed by the nuclear pattern (Pinto et al.\n2005), suggesting that mtDNA also may re\u00dfect what\nhappened at the nuclear level (Pinto et al. 2005).\nHowever, mtDNA only represents the maternal side\nof the Africanization process, and nuclear DNA may\nprovide additional insights into the invasion process\nthat were not available for this study (Schneider et al.\n2004). Honey bee samples for mtDNA analysis were\ncollected from colonies from any cavity active at any-\ntime throughout the year (Pinto et al. 2004). There-\nfore, sample sizes differ from those used to calculate\ncolony density. After extraction of total DNA from the\nthorax of a single adult worker per colony, as detailed\nchrome b gene (Crozier et al. 1991) was ampli\u00deed in\na 5-l total volume containing 0.5 TaqDNA poly-\nmerase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 1.5 mM\n, 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, 2 pM of each primer,\nmerase (Promega).

After PCR, samples were di-\ngested with the restriction enzyme BglII by using the\ntemperature and buffer conditions recommended by\nthe supplier. The total digestion volume was then\nelectrophoresed on a 2% agarose/Tris borate-EDTA\ngel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized\nunder UV light. Based on the visualization of a one-\nband pattern or two-band pattern on the gel, the type\nof mtDNA (mitotype) was scored as A. m. scutellata\n(referred to as Africanized throughout this article) or\nnon-A. m. scutellata (referred to as European through-\nStatistical Analyses. We used a Spearman rank cor-\nrelation coef\u00decient to identify cavity characteristics\ncorrelated with the time occupied and turnover indi-\nces. A 2 test applied to circular distributions\n(Batschelet 1965) was used to examine whether there\nwere any patterns in entrance orientation, by using\neight groups at equal intervals. We used a Kruskal\u00d0\nWallis test to compare the time occupied and turnover\nindices between habitat types. A Mann\u00d0Whitney U\ntest was performed to compare cavity characteristics\nbetween cavities used only by Africanized and only by\nEuropean honey bee colonies (Sokal and Rohlf 1995,\nWe used a nearest neighbor analysis to compare\nobserved patterns of cavity occupancy with those ex-\npected by chance. The nearest neighbor index (NNI)\nwas calculated by comparing the mean observed near-\nest neighbor distance with the mean expected nearest\nneighbor distance for spatially random points (Clark\nindicate observed average distances do not differ from\nrandom,whereasvalues1.0indicateaggregationand\nvalues 1.0 indicate dispersion. A Z test was used to\nidentify signi\u00decant values of the NNI.

Honey bee samples for mtDNA analysis were collected from colonies from any cavity active at anytime throughout the year (Pinto\net al. 2004), so sample sizes differ from those used to calculate colony density.\nAbbreviations are as follows: nearest neighbor distance (nnd), nearest neighbor distance expected for a random distribution (rand), nearest\nneighbor distance expected for a dispersed distribution (disp), the nearest neighbor index (nn index); a Z statistic was used to test for\nsigni\u00decance; resulting distributions can be random (nn index values close to 1.0), dispersed (nn index values 1.0), or aggregated (nn index\nNuttall; n  1), and mulberry (Morus rubra C. Lin-\nnaeus;n1)trees.Cavityentranceheightvariedfrom\nground level to 7.6 m (Table 2). Most cavities only had\none entrance, although 12 cavities had two to \u00deve\nentrances. The entrances of cavities used by feral\ncolonies most often faced the northeastern and south-\nwestern directions and differed signi\u00decantly from ran-\nextremely variable but on average was 42.10 cm2 (Ta-\nble 2). The dense live oak habitat patches contained\n56 cavities (51%), the open live oak habitat patches\ncontained 36 cavities (33%), the woodland habitat\npatches contained 16 cavities (15%), and the brush-\nland\u00d0grassland habitat patches contained only one\ncavity (1%; Fig. 1).\nNine cavities were occupied for 80% of the sur-\nveys (Fig. 2). Five cavities were occupied only during\nthe survey in which they were \u00derst found. Turnover\nwas relatively low, ranging from 5 to 30% of surveys.\nHowever, no cavities were occupied continuously\nthroughout the surveys (Fig. 3).\nNone of the measured cavity characteristics was\nsigni\u00decantly correlated with the time occupied or\nturnover indices (P  0.082). None of the measured\ncavity site characteristics was signi\u00decantly different\nbetween cavities only used by Africanized colonies\nand only used by European colonies (P  0.140).\nSpatial and Temporal Patterns. Occupied cavities\nwere aggregated in distribution for all years examined\n(Table 1). An analysis of spatial patterns by mitotype\nyielded different results (Table 3). The \u00derst colony of\nA. m. scutellata maternal descent (Africanized honey\nbee colony) in the study area was identi\u00deed in 1993.\nAt that time, colonies of non-A. m. scutellata maternal\norigin (European honey bee colonies) were aggre-\ngated in distribution. In 1994, three Africanized col-\nonies were found and European colonies were aggre-\ngated in distribution. The distributions of European\nand Africanized colonies were aggregated in 1995,\nthere were equal numbers of European and African-\nized colonies, both with aggregated distributions. By\nEuropean and Africanized colonies were randomly\n80.3% of colonies were Africanized. For each of these\nyears, the distribution of Africanized honey bee col-\nonies was aggregated and the distribution of European\nhoney bee colonies was random (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nColony Density. The densities of up to 12.5 colonies\nper km2 observed for this study were the highest\nreported to date for an area including both suitable\nand unsuitable patches of nesting habitat (see review\nof colony density in Table 1 of Ratnieks et al. 1991, as\nand McNally and Schneider 1996). The live oak and\nriparian woodland habitat patches were the only areas\nproviding suitable cavities, and these habitat patches\ncomprised 44% of the study area (Fig. 1). Oldroyd et\nbut only considered a narrow swath of suitable nesting\nhabitat 100 m in width. When considering a square\ncolonies per km2, with suitable habitat comprising\nonly 10% of the total area. Data reported in Kerr\n(1971) were omitted for similar reasons (Ratnieks et\nal. 1991) and because detailed information was not\navailable to convert the data to a comparable format.\nBased on these considerations, the previously re-\nported highest densities were 7.8 (Schneider and\nthe highest density reported for this study is higher\nthan previously reported densities of feral colonies.\nIn general, the study area represents highly suitable\nhabitat for feral honey bee colonies. Cavity density is\nhighincertainareas,andpollenandnectarsourcesare\nabundant throughout most of the year (Baum 2003,\nBaum et al. 2004). Conservative estimates of annual\npollen and nectar production for plants in the study\narea based on abundance and growth form suggest\nthat 1,895 feral colonies could be supported by pollen\nsources and 244 feral colonies could be supported by\nnectar sources within the study area, based on the\nannual resource requirements of a typical feral colony\ncolonies for pollen sources and 407 feral colonies for\nnectar sources when the area is expanded beyond the\nstudy site boundaries to include the entire potential\nforaging range of the feral colonies, based on the\nspatial locations of cavities and a foraging radius of\nstudy are high for natural areas (Ratnieks et al. 1991,\nHigh densities also may occur in urban landscapes\nwhere honey bee colonies nest in human made struc-\ntures and landscaping practices provide pollen and\nnectar during natural periods of resource dearth\n(K.A.B, M. D. Tchakerian, S. C. Thoenes, and R.N.C.,\nunpublished data).\nCavity Attributes. The most common tree genus\nused by feral colonies in this study, Quercus, also was\nfrequently used in other areas (Seeley and Morse\nTable 2. Descriptive statistics for the measured structural and\nenvironmental attributes of cavities occupied by feral honey bee\ncolonies on the Welder Wildlife Refuge\nMean  SE Min.

Entrances recorded in this study were smaller\nthan those reported by others (Avitabile et al. 1978,\nUsually, the observed cavity attributes were similar\nto those reported from other areas. However, cavity\nconstraints on feral colonies vary depending on geo-\ngraphic location. For example, tropically adapted Af-\nricanized honey bees typically have smaller colony\nsizes and store less honey than temperately adapted\nEuropean honey bees (Winston et al. 1981). There-\nfore, Africanized colonies often use smaller cavities\nthan European colonies (Seeley and Morse 1976, See-\nley 1977).

Location of all identi\u00deed cavities used by feral honey bee colonies within each habitat patch type on the Welder\nWildlife Refuge.\nPreferences for different nest site characteristics\nhave been proposed for Africanized and European\nhoney bees. Schmidt and Hurley (1995) reported that\nAfricanized honey bees showed no preference for\ncavity sizes ranging from 13.5 to 30 liters, whereas\nEuropean honey bees preferred larger cavity sizes.\nHowever, no differences were found in the structural\nand environmental attributes of cavities occupied by\nAfricanized or European colonies in this study. Cavity\nvolume could not be measured, so perhaps differences\ndo exist in volume between cavities used by African-\nized and European colonies in the study area. To date,\nselection for volume and shape (Schmidt and Thoenes\n1992) are the only nest site characteristics that have\nbeen compared between European and Africanized\ncolonies.\nWith the exception of Taber (1979), no other pub-\nlished studies have examined cavity occupancy\nthrough time. The time occupied and turnover indices\nprovide different information about the quality of a\ncavity. Cavities occupied a majority of the time, but\nwith high turnover rates, may not be as suitable for\nferal colonies as cavities occupied for long periods of\ntime with little or no turnover. Therefore, together\nthese indices provide an estimate of overall cavity\nquality. However, none of the measured cavity at-\ntributes were correlated with the time occupied and\nturnover indices, so cavities do not seem to vary in\ntheir suitability for honey bees based on the measured\nstructural and environmental attributes. Other studies\nhave documented preferences for certain nest site\ncharacteristics. For example, colonies selected nest\nsites 5 m and 3 m off the ground over nest sites 1 m off\nthe ground (Seeley and Morse 1978, Schmidt and\nThoenes 1987). However, these preferences have sel-\ndom been related directly to corresponding data on\ncolony survival, growth, and reproduction and are not\ncomparable to this study in terms of the time occupied\nand turnover indices. It was not possible to measure\ncavity volume, which is perhaps the most important\ncavity attribute, or at least the best documented in\nterms of honey bee preferences.\nSpatial and Temporal Patterns. The distribution of\nferal colonies was aggregated throughout the time\nperiod of this study, so spatial patterns do exist in\ncavity use by the feral colonies (Table 1). However,\nfew studies have reported aggregations of A. mellifera\nonies in Australia; McNally and Schneider 1996 for\nAfrican colonies in Botswana, Africa). The lack of\nreported aggregations by A. mellifera suggests that\nswarms tend to disperse, suitable nest sites are not\ncommon, or few surveys have been conducted for\nSwarm dispersal distances range from a few hun-\n(1981) estimated maximum \u00dfight distances based on\nengorgement and metabolic rates as 64 km for repro-\nductive swarms and 131 km for absconding colonies.\nSome studies have reported swarms selecting nearby\nhave reported swarms selecting more distant sites\n(Seeley and Morse 1977). These ambiguous results\nprobably represent genetic differences between the\ncolonies studied and/or local patterns of resource\navailability (Winston 1987). Colony aggregations also\nmay result from the attraction of swarms to existing\ncolonies not near the parent colony (Oldroyd et al.\n1995). These different scenarios can be evaluated by\nexamining the relatedness of colonies in aggregations.\nRelated colonies would support the short dispersal\ndistance scenario and unrelated colonies would sup-\nport the attraction scenario. Oldroyd et al. (1995)\nfound some completely unrelated colonies in aggre-\ngations in Wyperfeld National Park, northwestern\nVictoria, Australia, rejecting the explanation of short\ndispersal distances. The familial relationships among\nFig. 2. Frequency distribution of the time occupied in-\ndex for all cavities used by feral honey bee colonies identi\u00deed\nby 1995 on the Welder Wildlife Refuge.

Frequency distribution of the turnover index for\nall cavities used by feral honey bee colonies identi\u00deed by\n1995 on the Welder Wildlife Refuge. Turnover re\u00dfects the\nnumber of changes in cavity status from active (contained a\ncolony) to inactive (did not contain a colony) or inactive to\nactive on consecutive surveys.\ncolonies have not been examined on the Welder Wild-\nlife Refuge. However, four different mitotypes have\nbeen identi\u00deed (Pinto et al. 2004). The number of\ncolonies with different mitotypes through time does\nnot seem to support the short dispersal distance (re-\nlated colonies) scenario, although low colony or\nswarm survival could conceal this pattern.\nMorse (1977) suggested that swarms select nearby\ncavities when cavity availability is high. Therefore,\ncolony aggregations would be expected when cavities\nare abundant. Oldroyd et al. (1994) estimated up to\nused by Oldroyd et al. (1995), suggesting an abun-\ndance of cavities. They also reported that nectar and\npollen sources are abundant. However, the area sur-\nveyed only formed a 100-m-wide swath of suitable\nhabitat (Oldroyd et al. 1995), so cavities may be un-\ncommon at a broader spatial scale (larger extent). The\nsame conclusion could be drawn for the suitable hab-\nitat on the Welder Wildlife Refuge. Although suitable\nhabitat is abundant within the refuge and several ad-\njoining counties, live oak mottes, the main cavity\nsource for feral honey bee colonies, are not abundant\nat a larger scale. Based on vegetation communities\nde\u00dened by McMahan et al. (1984), cavities probably\nare available in the Texas coastal bend (including the\ncounties of Gonzales, Lavaca, Dewitt, Victoria, Jack-\nson, Goliad, Calhoun, McMullen, Live Oak, Bee, Refu-\ngio, Aransas, San Patricio, Duval, Jim Wells, Nueces,\nKleberg, Brooks, and Kenedy) in the mesquite\u00d0live\noak\u00d0bluewood parks, live oak woods and parks, post\noak woods, forest and grassland mosaic, and post-oak\nwoods and forest. These habitats comprise 22% of the\narea, whereas the highly suitable habitat of mesquite\u00d0\nlive oak\u00d0bluewood parks found on the Welder Wild-\nlife Refuge make up only 2% of the Texas coastal bend\nregion. Thus, the distribution of cavity sources is\npatchy and potentially rare at a broader spatial scale\n(large extent).\nIn addition to dispersal behavior and resource dis-\ntributions, other proposed hypotheses to explain col-\nony aggregations include predator defenses and mat-\nThere is controversy over whether aggregations\nwould serve to decrease or increase the probability of\nHowever, aggregations may increase predator detec-\ntion because colonies may become alerted when a\nnearby colony is disturbed (Seeley et al. 1982). Pos-\nsible predators on honey bee colonies that are present\non the Welder Wildlife Refuge include skunks, birds,\nopossums, shrews, armadillos, and invertebrates, such\nas wasps, ants, and moths (Winston 1987). However,\nthese animals probably have a minimal impact on the\nferal colonies because most are located in tree cavities\nseveral meters off the ground with relatively small\nentrances. Therefore, the observed aggregated pat-\ntern probably does not result from predator defenses.\nLast, aggregations may increase mating ef\u00deciency\nby decreasing the distance to drone congregation ar-\neas. In the case of unrelated aggregations, the prob-\nability of mating with brothers also would be de-\ncreased (Oldroyd et al. 1995). Mating with brothers\nresults in diploid males and reduces brood viability\n(Page1980).Therefore,mechanismsthatdecreasethe\nprobability of mating with brothers should be selected\nfor, such as multiple matings and unrelated aggrega-\ntions.\nWhen examining the spatial and temporal patterns\nof Africanized and European colonies, we found that\ncavities used by both colony types were aggregated\nAfricanized colonies were aggregated and European\ncolonies were randomly distributed (Table 3).
