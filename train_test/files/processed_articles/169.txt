Diversity across marital statuses in\nsources of assistance is revealed in analyses of two measures of caregiving network\ncomposition: (a) having more kin than nonkin helpers and (b) presence of specific helpers\n(adult children, siblings, friends, and formal helpers).

Barrett1 and Scott M. Lynclf\nIn later life, social networks become increasingly im-\nportant to one's comfort and well-being. Many of the\ncaregivers who assist people with functional impair-\nments in performing activities basic to daily life are\ndrawn from social networks. Friends and relatives (in-\nformal sources of support), along with helpers from\nformal organizations, compose the caregiving networks\nthat assist elderly people with functional limitations.\nFinding help for elderly persons who need assistance\nand the sources of such support are both influenced\nby a number of social structural variables, one of which\nis marital status.\nTo explain patterns in the receipt and source of\nsocial support in later life, several hypotheses have been\noffered, including substitution, supplementation, and\ntask specificity. Although some hypotheses have been\nexplored more fully than others to explain patterns in\nsocial support by marital status, each can potentially\ncontribute to understanding the relationship between\nmarital status and caregiving networks.\nThe substitution hypothesis argues that when clos-\nest relatives, presumably spouses and adult children,\nare not available in one's network, more distant re-\nlatives, friends, and formal helpers are substitutes in\nproviding needed care (Cumming & Schneider, 1961;\nold people have no children, a principle of family sub-\nstitution seems to operate and brother, sisters, neph-\news and nieces often fulfill the roles and assume the\nobligations of children.\" The choice of caregivers is\ndetermined by an ordered preference regarding the\nWe would like to thank Linda K.

Similarly, a smaller proportion of never-\nmarried people than currently or formerly married people\nwould be expected to report sons or daughters as helpers\nbecause the never married, especially in current older\ncohorts, are less likely to have children. Higher rates\nof assistance would be observed among the never married\nin help from siblings, other relatives, friends, and for-\nmal helpers. The substitution hypothesis has received\nsupport (e.g., Chatters, Taylor, & Jackson, 1986; Pe-\nters, Hoyt, Babchuk, Kaiser, & lljima, 1987; Shanas,\ncriticized for failing to provide a theoretical explana-\ntion for the presumably universal ordering of caregiving\npreferences (Messeri, Silverstein, & Litwak, 1993).\nA second hypothesis, supplementation, argues that\ninformal support influences one's use of formal care\nmary caregivers, typically drawn from the informal support\nnetwork, function as linkages between the elderly re-\ncipient and the formal care system. Informal caregivers\nmay serve as mediators, referrals, or gatekeepers to\nformal care (Ward, Sherman, & LaCory, 1984). For-\nmal support is viewed as a supplement rather than as\na substitute to the extensive efforts of primary care-\ngivers.\nThe supplementation hypothesis is drawn from ex-\ntensions of Andersen's (Andersen & Aday, 1978; Ander-\nsen & Newman, 1973) model of health service utili-\nzation. In the Andersen framework, use of services is\na function of three sets of factors: need, predisposing,\nand enabling characteristics of the individual. Bass\nand Noelker (1987) extended this model to include\ncaregivers' need, predisposing, and enabling charac-\nteristics. The relationship of the caregiver to the elder\nis viewed as a predisposing factor to receipt of formal\ncare. Certain kin ties to the recipient of care may be\nmore strongly associated than other kin or nonkin ties\nwith use of supplemental formal services. It could, for\nexample, be posited that having a daughter-in-law or\ndistant relative as a caregiver is more strongly related\nto use of formal services compared with having a daugh-\nter as a caregiver. According to the supplementation\nperspective, the overall level of family involvement in\ncaregiving responsibilities is an enabling factor in ob-\ntaining formal care. Evidence suggests that the more\ninvolved family members are in caregiving, the greater\nthe use of formal services, such as in-home nursing or\naide services, that supplement informal care (Bass &\nA third hypothesis, task specificity, is drawn from\ndifferential primary group theory (Litwak & Szelenyi,\n1969) and posits that family, friends, and formal help-\ners are suited to different functions in support provi-\nsion. They manage complementary components of\na shared goal (Litwak, 1985). The task-specificity hy-\npothesis outlines characteristics of primary groups, in-\ncluding proximity, length of commitment, commonal-\nity of lifestyle, and size that differentiate the marital\ndyad, other relatives, friends, and neighbors. For ex-\nample, Litwak (1985) argued that the structure of friend-\nship networks is suited to providing services that re-\nquire an intermediate time commitment, whereas kin-\nsnip ties are adapted to fulfilling needs demanding a\nmore long-term commitment. To specify tasks best man-\naged by formal caregivers, other dimensions are added\n(i.e., type of motivation, division of labor, and level of\ntechnical knowledge).\nThe formulations of these three hypotheses and their\napplication in research examining patterns of care among\nelderly people vary in the degree to which they ad-\ndress potential differences by marital status in the size\nand composition of caregiving networks. The substitu-\ntion hypothesis, with its emphasis on availability of various\nsources of support, deals with marital status most di-\nrectly, and empirical research from this perspective\nhas included examinations of marital status. Less at-\ntention to marital status is found in research based on\nthe task-specificity or supplementation hypothesis; how-\never, these hypotheses are relevant to patterns in care-\ngiving networks across marital statuses.\nBecause availability of and reliance on various sources\nof informal support differ among married, formerly mar-\nried, and never-married people, the nature of the link-\nages, hypothesized by the supplementation perspec-\ntive, between the informal and formal systems of care\nare likely to vary by marital status. Examining the rela-\ntionship between marital status and caregiving networks\nfrom the supplementation perspective may, for example,\nreveal different mechanisms linking formal care to\ncaregiving by close kin (e.g., adult children who are\nmore common in the helping networks of the mar-\nried and widowed) and more distant kin and nonkin\n(e.g., siblings and friends who are more often caregivers\nof the never married).\nPatterns in receipt of social support across marital\nstatuses may be illuminated by the substitution and\nsupplementation hypotheses; the task-specificity model\nbrings into focus potential consequences of the varia-\ntion oy marital status in composition of caregiving networks.\nIf, as the task-specificity model posits, some primary\ngroups are better suited than others to perform cer-\ntain tasks with which many elderly persons of all marital\nstatuses need assistance, then observed differences in\nhelping network composition represent variation in access\nto types of care (e.g., assistance with activities of daily\nliving [ADLs], financial help, or socioemotional sup-\nport). The task-specificity hypothesis includes a substi-\ntution principle; it argues that when the optimal group\nfor performing a task is absent, the available group is\nchosen whose structure most closely matches that of\nthe best group on dimensions particularly relevant to\nthe task (Litwak, 1985). However, this model also im-\nplies that the absence of sources of support best suited\nto providing needed assistance may result in a de-\nThis research examines these hypotheses as poten-\ntial explanations for variation by marital status in use\nof informal and formal support. However, more at-\ntention is given to substitution and supplementation\nthan to task specificity. Because of the considerable\ncomplexity that would be involved in simultaneously\nexamining the size and composition of helping net-\nworks as well as specific tasks provided by various care-\ngivers while controlling for availability of various sup-\nport sources across multiple marital statuses, analyses\ndo not include examinations of specific tasks provided\nby caregivers.\nLiterature Review\nExisting literature reveals considerable differences in\nthe caregiving networks of married, formerly married,\nand never-married people. Compared with the mar-\nried, the unmarried are less likely to report having close\nfamily members; however, a higher percentage of the\nunmarried have a close friend (McMullin & Marshall,\n1996). Findings on reports of close relationships with\nfriends and family, potential helpers in later life, par-\nallel patterns in the actual receipt of support. The care-\ngiving networks of the unmarried are more likely to\ninclude friends and neighbors than are the networks\nof the married (Chatters et al., 1986; Stoller & Earl,\n1983). Having a paid helper in one's caregiving net-\nwork is also more common among the unmarried\nIn contrast, the married tend to rely more heavily on\nfamily members, in particular, spouses (Johnson & Cata-\nNot only does the composition of caregiving net-\nworks vary by marital status, but so too does helping\nnetwork size. However, the findings are inconsistent,\nand few studies have examined distinct groups of the\nunmarried. Research comparing the married with the\nwidowed has indicated that caregiving networks of the\nmarried may consist of fewer helpers (Townsend &\nPoulshock, 1986). The married also have been found\nto have smaller helping networks than a composite\ngroup of the unmarried (Stoller & Pugliesi, 1991). Others,\nhowever, have reported larger helping networks among\nthe married compared with the unmarried (Thornton\nIn general, research has suggested that when faced\nwith disabilities in old age, married couples rely on\none another and are less likely to enlist the aid of\nfriends or formal helpers than are unmarried elders\n(Johnson & Catalano, 1981; Townsend & Poulshock,\n1986). Some have argued that this reflects different\nprocesses of social network configuration that occur\namong the married and the unmarried Gohnson & Cata-\nlano, 1981). Among the married, social regression has\nbeen hypothesized, involving a withdrawal from other\nsocial relations into the interdependence of the mari-\ntal bond (Slater, 1963). A process of anticipatory so-\ncialization may occur among the unmarried, who use\nthe range of social resources accumulated over the\nlife course to meet their needs in later life (Johnson &\nVariation Among the Unmarried\nDifferences between the helping networks of mar-\nried and unmarried elderly people are striking; further-\nmore, there is evidence of variation among groups of\nthe unmarried. Among elderly widows, adult children\nare central members of their caregiving networks (Lopata,\n1978). Research has also indicated that widows nave\nmore family ties than never married and separated/\ndivorced elderly persons (Goldberg, Kantrow, Kremen,\n& Lauter, 1986), which may affect the likelihood of\nhaving family members serving as caregivers in later life.\nIn comparison with the widowed, the never mar-\nried are less likely to have caregiving networks that\ninclude adult children. Among the never married,\nsiblings are central in provision of support (Cicirelli,\nCoward, & Dwyer, 1992), whereas low rates of sib-\nling support are found among widows (Lopata, 1978).\nNever-married elderly people also turn to formal sup-\nport; the likelihood of receiving help from a paid source\nis higher for the never married than for the divorced\nor widowed (Connidis & McMullin, 1994). Other dif-\nferences have been found between never married and\ndivorced elderly persons. For example, the never married\nare somewhat less likely to report having a potential\nRelatively few studies have focused on the helping\nnetworks of divorced or separated elderly people. Tnere\nis some evidence, however, that siblings are frequently\nfound in the caregiving networks of the separated/\ndivorced; but they are not as prevalent as in networks\nof the never married (Cicirelli et al., 1992).\nGender, Marital Status,\nand Caregiving Networks\nLiterature on gender and receipt of care among\nelderly people has indicated that differences exist in\nthe sources of care received by women and men. More-\nover, empirical findings and theoretical explanations\nprovide strong rationales for examining gender within\nthe context of marital status and social support. In general,\nrates of assistance from informal sources are higher\namong men, whereas formal care is more common\namong women (Coward, Home, & Dwyer; 1992; Stoller\n& Cutler, 1992). This pattern may reflect a greater\nneed for assistance among women, who report worse\nhealth on average than men; however, other expla-\nnations hinge on marital status, such as gender differ-\nences in the likelihood of being unmarried.\nSeveral demographic trends, including higher life\nexpectancy and probability of widowhood among women\nand higher rates of remarriage among men, yield the\nfollowing: Older women are more likely than men to\nbe unmarried. As a result, spousal support in later life\nis available to more men than women. Prevailing age\ndifferences within couples contribute not only to women's\nincreased risk of widowhood but also raise their risk\nof having a spouse in poor health, which could con-\ntribute to increased reliance on formal care.\nA moderating effect of gender has been observed\non the relationship between marital status and use of\nformal sources. Married women are more likely to use\nformal care than married men, but this gender differ-\nence does not exist among the unmarried (Mutchler\n& Bullers, 1994). Other research has revealed an ex-\nception to the general pattern of higher use of formal\ncare among the unmarried: Widowed men use fewer\nformal supports than their female peers (Connidis &\nMcMullin, 1994). There is also evidence of gender dif-\nferences in the effect of marital status on friendship\nnetworks, structures from which informal caregivers\ncan be drawn; widowhood decreases interaction with\nfriends among men, but not among women (Hatch &\nResearch Questions\nWithin the literature on marital status and helping\nnetworks of elderly people, differences between the\nmarried and unmarried have been well documented.\nLess is known about variation among unmarried sta-\ntuses. This results from a tendency to use one of the\nfollowing three strategies. Several studies have focused\non one unmarried status (e.g., Lopata, 1978; O'Bryant,\n1988). Others have compared the married with the\nunmarried as a single, presumably homogeneous, group\n(e.g., Johnson & Catalano, 1981; Longino & Lipman,\nThornton et al., 1993). A third group of studies exam-\nines only two marital statuses (e.g., Choi, 1996; Keith,\nA few studies on helping networks of elderly people\nhave examined several marital statuses simultaneously.\nChatters and colleagues (1986) studied elderly Black\nAmericans; it is not known whether their findings\nare generalizable to other racial groups. Connidis and\nMcMullin (1994) used a Canadian sample of commu-\nnity-dwelling elders; however, no control on health\nstatus was included. Therefore, observed relationships\nbetween marital status and composition of helping net-\nworks may be the result of differences in health status\nor of level of need for assistance. In addition, it can-\nnot be assessed whether level of disability in old age\nis related to receipt of assistance from specific sources.\nThis study examines two dimensions of helping net-\nworks, size and composition. Previous research has\nindicated that network size is associated with access\nto support; a larger network increases the availability\nof emotional and instrumental support (Seeman & Berk-\nman, 1988). Network composition also provides an\nindication of access to help. As highlighted by the task-\nspecificity hypothesis, sources of help vary in their suit-\nability to perform various tasks. Further, sources of help\ndiffer in the duration of assistance that they are likely\nto provide (Stolar, Hill, & Tomblin, 1986). Size and\ncomposition are examined because these dimensions\ncan be expected to vary by marital status; however,\nthe nature of the relationships between marital status\nand network size and composition is not well-under-\nstood. For example, it is plausible that the never mar-\nried, having never \"married into\" a second family, have\nsmaller helping networks that include more nonkin\nmembers than those of the ever married. Using simi-\nlar reasoning, the separated or divorced, who are likely\nto have ties to one rather than two sets of extended\nfamilies, may have fewer relatives serving as caregivers\ncompared with the widowed or the married.\nThis study addresses three questions: Among dis-\nabled, community-dwelling elderly people, are there\ndifferences across marital statuses in the size of the\nhelping network that assists with everyday activities of\nlife? Does the composition of helping networks, in terms\nof informal and formal components, differ by marital\nstatus? Finally, does the effect of marital status on the\nsize and composition of helping networks differ for\nmen and women?\nMethod\nSample\nData were drawn from the 1982 National Long-\nTerm Care Survey (NLTCS). The 1982 NLTCS is a cross-\nsectional survey that began with the selection of ap-\nproximately 36,000 persons from Medicare enrollment\nfiles, stratified by geographic region, age, race, and\nreason for entitlement. This screening resulted in the\nor over who had an impairment in at least one ADL\nor instrumental ADL (IADL). The NLTCS was an ideal\ndataset for addressing the questions posed in this re-\nsearch. The large sample size provided adequate num-\nbers of men and women in the less common marital\nstatuses (i.e., separated/divorced and never married)\nallowing us to examine Marital Status x Gender inter-\nactions. In addition, it includes detailed information\non the composition of helping networks of commu-\nnity-dwelling, disabled elderly people. In these analy-\nses, we deleted incomplete interviews and cases missing\non the primary independent variable, marital status,\nMeasures\nSize and Composition of Caregiving Networks.--\nSize of caregiving network is a count of up to 15 helpers\nreported by the respondent. Because relatives repre-\nsent a primary source of support in old age, this study\nexamines a variable indicating whether one's network\ncontains more kin than nonkin helpers. From items\nreferring to the relationship of each reported helper\nto the recipient of care, the variable is coded 1 if the\nnumber of kin helpers exceeds the number of unre-\nlated helpers. Respondents with fewer kin than nonkin\nhelpers or an equivalent number of kin and nonkin\nhelpers are coded 0. A closer examination of the com-\nposition of networks is made in analyses of whether\none's helping network consists of several different sources\nof help. The four types of helpers analyzed include\nadult children, siblings, friends, and formal helpers (iden-\ntified by respondents as paid helpers or persons from\nhelping organizations).\nSociodemographic Variables.--Differences among\nthe unmarried were a focus of this project; therefore,\nwe treated marital status as a set of four dichotomous\nvariables. The separated and divorced were combined\ninto a single category because the small number of\nseparated elderly people in the sample (n = 61) pre-\ncluded examination of the groups independently. The\nfollowing variables shown to be related to receipt of\nsupport in later life were included as controls: gen-\nder, race, age, income, and education (Choi, 1996;\nhold income, originally coded as an ordinal variable\nwere recoded to the midpoint of each income cat-\negory, allowing income to be treated as a continuous\nvariable. Education was the highest grade attended,\nranging from 0 to 18 (which represents 2 or more\nyears of graduate school).\nNeed for Assistance.--To control for level of need\nfor assistance with disabilities, we added two indica-\ntors of health status: functional health status and self-\nrated health. Functional health was measured by a\ncount of up to nine ADLs (eating, getting in or out of\nbed, getting in or out of chairs, walking, going out-\nside, dressing, bathing, and toileting). Although the\nsample includes respondents with at feast one ADL or\nIADL, we included ADLs and not lADLs as a control\nfor health because they represent more severe func-\ntional limitations. Self-rated health ranged from 1 (poor)\nto 4 (excellent).\nAvailability of Support.--Because availability of po-\ntential sources of support is a necessary condition for\nreceipt of assistance, and offspring represent a primary\nsource of help in old age, we included number of\nadult children (up to 16) as an indicator of support\navailability.\nAnalyses\nWe used ordinary least squares regression to ex-\namine the effect of marital status on total number of\nhelpers. Logistic regression was used in the examina-\ntion of whether one's helping network contains more\nkin than nonkin members. For the third component\nof the analyses, we ran a multivariate regression model.\nSources of care received were regressed on marital\nstatus, Marital Status x Gender interactions, and other\npredictors. A multivariate regression model is an ap-\npropriate approach because the probability that an\nindividual received care from one source is likely to\ninfluence whether the individual received care from\nanother source, hence implying endogeneity.\nAt least two methods exist by which to model this\nendogeneity. First, one could explicitly model the non-\nrecursive relationship among the endogenous variables\nby treating each source of help as a predictor of the\nothers. However, this approach is not appropriate without\nextensive constraints because such a model is under-\nidentified. An alternative approach is to allow the\nerrors of each source of help to correlate. Estimating\ncorrelated errors is essentially equivalent to reparam-\neterizing the 12 potential regression coefficients (i.e.,\nthe effects of each source of help on the others) into\nsix covariances, yielding a just-identified model. In this\nresearch, we chose the second method.\nWe conducted multivariate regression by using\nweighted least squares (WLS) estimation on a Pearson\ncorrelation matrix of 18 variables (4 endogenous, 14\nexogenous) with the corresponding asymptotic co-\nvariance matrix used as the weights. Given that some\nof the variables are ordinal, the preferred approach is\nto use WLS estimation on a matrix of polychoric cor-\nrelations between ordinal variables and polyserial\ncorrelations between ordinal and continuous variables.\nHowever, this approach failed to obtain convergence;\nhence, we used an accepted alternative approach of\nusing WLS estimation on a matrix of Pearson correla-\ntions (e.g., Bentler & Newcomb, 1991; Stump, Clark,\nWe imputed missing data for variables that are miss-\ning in fewer than 5% of the cases (i.e., self-rated health\nand education) by using means. For household income,\nmissing in 19% of sample, we used the predictive mean\nmethod (Landerman, Land, & Pieper, 1997).\nResults\nMeans and standard deviations of variables used in\nthe analyses are presented in Table 1 for each marital\nstatus. Marital status is significantly related with all in-\ndependent and dependent variables. The widowed have\nthe largest caregiving networks and are more likely\nthan other groups to receive help from adult children.\nOver three fourths of the married reported more kin\nthan nonkin helpers. Networks containing predomi-\nnantly family members were less common among other\nmarital statuses. Siblings and formal helpers were re-\nported by a higher proportion of the never married\ncompared with other groups. Approximately one fifth\nof the unmarried had helping networks that contain\nfriends, compared with only 5% of the married.\nDifferences by marital status and gender in the com-\nposition of caregiving networks are shown in Table 2.\nAmong the married, women are significantly more likely\nthan men to receive assistance from any of the four\nsources. The only significant gender difference among\nthe unmarried is found for the separated/divorced. Sep-\narated or divorced women are more likely than their\nmale peers to have help from their children.\nIn the examination of total number of helpers, we\nfound marital status differences (Table 3). Trie main\neffects model reveals that the widowed and never mar-\nried have helping networks that are significantly larger\nthan those of the married. Size of caregiving network\nof separated/divorced elderly people does not differ\nfrom that of married elderly people. Additional analy-\nses revealed a significant difference between groups\nof the unmarried: The never married have helping net-\nworks that are larger than those of the separated/\ndivorced (see Appendix, Note 1).

An apparent contradic-\ntion is observed with higher income and lower edu-\ncation being associated with a larger network (see Ap-\npendix, Note 2). Note that the regression coefficients\nindicate the effects of income and education, net of\neach other (see Appendix, Note 3). There is no evi-\ndence that the effect of marital status on number of\nhelpers varies for men and women (Model 2).\nIn contrast to models predicting the number of help-\ners, analyses of the composition of caregiving networks\nrevealed an interaction between marital status and\ngender, as well as a main effect of marital status. In\nthe model predicting the probability of having more\nkin than nonkin helpers (Table 4), we found that all\ngroups of the unmarried had significantly lower odds\nthan the married of having a network composed predomi-\nnantly of family members. We found significant dif-\nferences among the unmarried. The separated/divorced\nhad lower odds than both the widowed and the never\nmarried. Results showed that being male and having\nmore children and fewer ADLs increased the odds of\nhaving a helping network composed primarily of fam-\nily members. As observed for network size, income\nand education exerted opposite effects on network\ncomposition. Model 2 reveals that gender and marital\nstatus interacted to influence the composition of care-\ngiving networks. For both groups of the formerly mar-\nried, women had higher odds than men of having more\nkin than nonkin helpers.\nIn the multivariate regression model presented in\nTable 5, we found further evidence of marital status\ndifferences and Marital Status x Gender interactions.\nIn the main effects model (not shown), it was revealed\nthat all groups of the unmarried were more likely than\nthe married to receive help from their adult children.\nReceiving assistance from children was associated with\nbeing older, female, and White and having higher in-\ncome, less education, more children, more functional\nlimitations, and worse self-rated health. A Marital Sta-\ntus x Gender interaction term reached significance,\nindicating that never-married women were more likely\nthan their male peers to have help from their adult\nchildren.\nWith regard to help from siblings, all groups of the\nunmarried were significantly more likely than the married\nto have help from siblings.

As observed in help from a\nson or daughter, income and education operated in\nopposite directions; however, in contrast with help from\nchildren, higher education and lower income increased\nthe likelihood of reporting a friend. Having fewer children\nincreased the likelihood of help from friends. An in-\nteraction term reached significance, revealing that among\nthe never-married, men are more likely than women\nto have friends as helpers.\nThe never married and both groups of the previ-\nously married were more likely than the married to\nhave help from formal helpers. Assistance from a for-\nmal helper was associated with being older and fe-\nmale and having fewer children, more functional limi-\ntations, and worse self-rated health. We found the same\npattern in the effects of income and education ob-\nserved for help from a friend in assistance from a for-\nmal helper. There was no evidence to suggest that\nthe effect of marital status on formal help differs for\nmen and women.\nThe correlations between the error terms of the sources\nof assistance, noted in Table 5, provide evidence of\nthe extent to which receiving help from one source\nwas related to help from other sources. Of the six\npossible correlations between the errors of each source\nof help, most were negative, indicating that receiving\nassistance from one source was associated with a lower\nlikelihood of help from other sources. An exception\nwas revealed, such that help from a friend and from a\nformal source are positively related.\nDiscussion\nThe results indicate that the size and composition\nof helping networks that assist elderly people with func-\ntional limitations vary by marital status. The findings\nextend the literature by revealing differences in help-\ning networks across groups of the unmarried and\nchallenge the treatment of the unmarried as a homo-\ngeneous group in research on caregiving networks. Further,\nthe results reveal that the effect of marital status on\nnetwork composition varied by gender. Although a few\nprevious studies have examined multiple marital sta-\ntuses (e.g., Chatters et al., 1986; Connidis & McMullin,\n1994), they have been limited either by failing to\ninclude a control for health status or to examine po-\ntential gender differences or by considering only one\nracial group. In addition, prior research considering\nseveral marital statuses has not simultaneously mod-\neled receipt of assistance from several sources.\nThe most consistent finding was that the networks\nof the married, in terms of both size and composi-\ntion, differed significantly from nearly all categories of\nthe unmarried. The only exception is that the net-\nworks of the separated/divorced did not differ signifi-\ncantly in size from those of the married. Among the\nmarried, we found small helping networks consisting\nprimarily of related individuals. Other analyses con-\nducted in this study and findings reported by other\nresearchers (e.g., Johnson & Catalano, 1981) revealed\nthat spouses are, not surprisingly, the central mem-\nbers of the helping networks of the married. For ex-\nample, we found that 88% of the married reported\ntheir spouse as a helper. Findings are consistent with\nsocial regression theory, positing an increased reliance\non exchanges within the marital relationship and a\nsimultaneous withdrawal from other social ties (Slater,\nControlling for level of need for help with func-\ntional limitations, the married along with the separated/\ndivorced had the smallest networks of helpers com-\npared with the widowed and never married. Although\nthe limited number of helpers assisting the married\ncan be explained by the process of social regression,\nthe relatively small size of the helping networks of the\nseparated/divorced may be related to the unexpected\nnature of this type of marital dissolution. Many elderly\npeople who are separated or divorced may have ex-\npected over most of their adult lives to be cared for\nin later life by their spouse. Even if the separation or\ndivorce was not recent, it is plausible that the smaller\nnumber of helpers assisting these elders reflects the\ndifficulty of reshaping one's support network, from which\ncaregivers are drawn, to compensate for the prema-\nture or unexpected loss of one's spouse.\nData on the timing of marital transitions are not\navailable in NLTCS; however, the findings raise ques-\ntions about the effect of marital history on caregiving\nnetworks that could be addressed in future research.\nFor example, sources of support for the more recently\ndivorced or widowed may be different from the set\nof helpers assisting those who are unmarried over a\nlonger duration. Losing one's spouse earlier in life, be-\nfore the onset of functional limitations, may result in\nrelatively large helping networks consisting of relatives\nand friends with whom exchange relationships have\nbeen developed over a number of years. More recent\nmarital loss may be associated with smaller helping\nnetworks and increased reliance on formal help.\nThe results from examinations of the composition\nof helping networks suggest that the unmarried have\nmore diverse caregiving networks than the married.\nOur findings provided support for the substitution hy-\npothesis. All groups of the unmarried had lower odds\nthan the married of having a network composed pri-\nmarily of family members. Analyses of the presence\nof specific helpers in caregiving networks of elderly\npeople provided further evidence of substitution. The\nformerly married were significantly more likely than\nthe married to receive assistance from adult children.\nHelp from children was especially common among the\nwidowed. The never married were more likely than\nthe currently or formerly married to have siblings as\ncaregivers. Friends are more likely to be reported as\nhelpers of the unmarried, especially the widowed, com-\npared with the married. The unmarried were also more\nlikely to have formal helpers; however, the differences\nin receipt of formal help between groups of the un-\nmarried were less striking.\nThese findings are consistent with substitution, which\nwould predict that among those without a spouse (e.g,\nthe widowed), adult children will provide assistance.\nAnd those without children (e.g, the majority of the\nnever married in current older cohorts) will be helped\nby other relatives, such as siblings. Although the re-\nsults generally followed the patterns expected by sub-\nstitution, they also highlight the inability of substitu-\ntion to explain patterns revealed by examining unmar-\nried statuses separately. For example, it is not clear\nwhy help from adult children was significantly more\nlikely for widows than for the separated/divorced. Con-\ntrolling for number of children, the results indicate that\nwidows turn to their children, whereas the separated\nor divorced rely on siblings or friends. Perhaps incor-\nporating theoretical perspectives drawn from work on\nthe effect of separation and divorce on family inter-\naction and typically focused on earlier life stages with\nthe gerontological research on diversity in caregiving\nnetworks will illuminate these patterns in sociafsup-\nport by marital status.\nWe found less evidence to support the supplemen-\ntation hypothesis, which predicted a positive link be-\ntween help from family and receipt of formal care. In\ncontrast, the findings derived from the error correla-\ntions (Table 5) indicated that help from family (chil-\ndren or siblings) was associated with decreased likeli-\nhood of formal help. However, a positive association\nwas revealed between help from friends and formal\nsupport. One explanation is that those who were least\nable to rely on their family members for care must\nturn to both friends and formal helpers, perhaps with\nfriends providing socioemotional support and formal\nhelpers assisting with functional limitations. Alternatively,\nthe finding could reflect a linking mechanism through\nwhich friends serve as referrals or mediators of formal\ncare. Although NLTCS contains data on the type of\nassistance with functional limitations received from specific\nhelpers, less information is available on socioemotional\nsupport and referrals that may occur between help-\ners. Further research including measures of the level\nand type of support from friends is needed to deter-\nmine whether the association found here reflects an\nunderlying process through which assistance from\nfriends leads to help from formal sources.\nIn this study, primary attention was given to sources\nof support to community-dwelling, disabled elderly\npersons. Another aspect of social support, types of\nassistance provided, would need to be examined to\nadequately test the validity of the task-specificity hy-\npothesis. However, some limited evidence supporting\nthis model can be drawn from these analyses. Having\nadult children, sibling, and formal helpers are all sig-\nnificantly associated with one or both health measures,\nsuggesting that the help provided to disabled elderly\npeople by these sources is linked to self-rated and func-\ntional health. In contrast, help from friends is not re-\nlated to health. It is plausible that these results indi-\ncate that friends, as suggested by Litwak (1985), con-\nstitute a primary group that is suited to perform tasks\nthat differ from those performed by family or formal\nhelpers.\nThis research also illuminates the links among gen-\nder, marital status, and caregiving networks. Gender\ndid not appear to interact with marital status to influ-\nence the size of helping networks. Women, in gen-\neral, had more helpers than men, and this held across\nmarital statuses. The relationship between marital sta-\ntus and gender was more complex in the composition\nof caregiving networks. Formerly married women had\nhigher odds than currently married women of having\npredominantly family members in their helping net-\nworks. However, among men being married, relative\nto being formerly married, increased the odds of hav-\ning a helping network composed primarily of family\nmembers. An explanation for this observation is the\nheavier reliance on spouses for assistance by men than\nwomen (i.e., 93% of married men in this sample re-\nported their spouse as a helper, but only 80% of mar-\nried women did).\nOne of the most striking findings related to gender\nwas the relatively low rate of assistance from adult\nchildren to separated/divorced men relative to women\n(shown most clearly in Table 2). This finding is con-\nsistent with research revealing that for men divorce\nbrings a decrease in the frequency of interaction with\nchildren (Bulcroft & Bulcroft, 1991) and suggests that\nthese patterns in interaction can have consequences\nfor receipt of caregiving in later life.\nOther findings raise questions about the interaction\nof unmarried men with their adult children over the\nlifecourse. Among the never married, women were\nsignificantly more likely to be helped in later life by\ntheir adult children. It is plausible that this pattern, as\nthat of separated/divorced men, results from lower levels\nof interaction with their children throughout the life-\ncourse, in contrast with widowed or married men. Another\ngender difference revealed in the examination of sources\nof help is the increased likelihood of friends as help-\ners of never-married men compared with their female\npeers. Taken together, these results suggest that never-\nmarried women may maintain relationships with fam-\nily members, including their children, who support them\nin later life, whereas single men rely on their friends.\nThe social patterning of caregiving networks is im-\nportant to examine because whom one turns to for\nnelp when faced with disabilities has consequences\nfor well-being in later life. For example, elders who\nrely on sources other than a spouse or adult child are\nmore likely to experience a decline or cessation in\nsupport over time (Stolar et al., 1986). In addition, as\nthe task-specificity hypothesis brings into focus, avail-\nability and choice of helpers are likely to affect the\ntype of assistance received. Further analyses that si-\nmultaneously consider types of support and sources\nof assistance across multiple marital statuses will pro-\nvide insight into the unmet needs of elderly people.\nReferences\nAndersen, R.
