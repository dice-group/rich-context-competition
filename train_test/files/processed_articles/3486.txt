In this article, we challenge the\nconsensual (self-)presentation of journalism \u00ad in terms of its occupational ideology, its\nprofessional culture, and its sedimentation in routines and organizational structures (cf.\nthe newsroom) in the context of its reconfiguration as a post-industrial, entrepreneurial,\nand atypical way of working and of being at work.

Box 716,\nEmail: t.a.c.witschge@rug.nl\nArticle\nIntroducing journalism and journalism studies\nJournalism, as a profession, has enjoyed a long and stable development in most countries\naround the world. Whether working under conditions of censorship, pressures of nation\nbuilding, or with expectations of providing a society with social cement, journalism is\nwidely recognized and seen as a set of values, principles, and practices enacted in differ-\nent ways and settings with a `sense of wholenessness and seamlessness' (Hallin, 1992:\n14) around the world. Similarly, the field of journalism studies \u00ad the scholarly pursuit of\nknowledge about journalism \u00ad developed alongside its object into an increasingly sophis-\nticated and consensual body of knowledge, range of research methodologies, and theo-\nretical developments.\nThis modernist dream of coherence and consensus is a fallacy. In the late or, with\nZygmunt Bauman (Deuze, 2007a), liquid modern era, the field of journalism studies and\neducation recognizes how journalism is more than a neat sum of its parts, instead accom-\nmodating a more dynamic and indeed unruly consideration of the profession. Journalism is\ntransitioning from a more or less coherent industry to a highly varied and diverse range of\npractices.AsAnderson et al. (2012) write in a review of the profession at the start of the 21st\ncentury, `the journalism industry is dead but ... journalism exists in many places'(p. 76).\nScholars and educators tend to respond to this shift in two ways. One is to rally the\ntroops, close ranks, and put significant effort in bringing coherence and stability (back)\nto the field. This gets established by producing impressive handbooks, canonical anthol-\nogies, readers, and companion volumes (and corresponding special issues of scholarly\njournals and conferences). Empirical approaches in this tradition center on comprehen-\nsive surveys and content analyses of journalists and journalism based on narrow defini-\ntions of the news industry offering conclusions about what journalism does and who\njournalists are (see Hanitzsch et al., 2011; Hellmueller and Mellado, 2015; Willnat et al.,\nA second trend in the field is to dive, head first, into the chaos. This proves to be an\noften exciting and bewildering experience, leading to a wide variety of studies and con-\nceptualizations of journalism in a post-industrial era, often featuring particularistic work\non emerging genres, formats, and types of journalism. Theoretically, journalism research\nin this context enthusiastically explores the boundaries of the field (Carlson and Lewis,\n2015) or shows through a surge in ethnographic fieldwork how even the traditional\n`inside' of the profession \u00ad the newsroom \u00ad is not as coherent as it is generally made out\nIn this intervention, we bring together these approaches in a dialectic attempt to move\nbeyond journalism, allowing for a broader definition and understanding of the field. We\ncritically interrogate first the normative expectations of what journalism should be and\ndo according to dominant conceptualizations of the profession. Next, epistemologically\nwe follow up on the newsroom-centricity of journalism studies (section `Toward a\ndynamic definition of journalism') while recognizing that newsrooms continue to be\nimportant anchoring points for newswork (section `Understanding news as work').\nHowever, the newsroom is not necessarily a solid or coherent entity in today's post-\nindustrial journalism (section `Considering the organization of post-industrial journal-\nism'), nor is newswork outside of the newsroom necessarily free of the constraints and\nstructures traditionally provided by the institutional arrangement of journalism (section\n`Enter entrepreneurialism'). Newsrooms and newswork are part of a profession that can\nbest be seen as a self-organizing social system through which shifting coalitions of par-\nticipants are linked, and that is interdependent on a variety of other systems (such as\nsales, marketing, design, programming and coding, publishing, and distribution ser-\nvices). It is also a field with a distinct materiality of praxis (Sartre, 1976: 79) \u00ad as what\njournalism is and what journalists do cannot be meaningfully separated from their mate-\nrial context (cf. technologies, work environments). We discuss how, in this context, we\ncan understand the role of the media professional as an enterprising individual beyond\nthe limited conceptualization of entrepreneurship as a strictly economic endeavor (sec-\ntion `Beyond journalism'). In the concluding section, we push for an ontology of journal-\nism beyond individuals and institutions.\nDefining journalism: Beyond the core\u00adperiphery dichotomy\nStudents and scholars coming from a wide variety of disciplines have researched and\ntheorized journalism, resulting in a more or less coherent conceptualization of what jour-\nnalism is (Zelizer, 2004). The general approach to understanding, studying, teaching, and\npracticing journalism articulates the profession with a specific occupational ideology and\nculture. Journalists tend to benchmark their actions and attitudes self-referentially using\nideal-typical standards, seeing themselves as providing a public service; being objective,\nfair, and (therefore) trustworthy; working autonomously, committed to an operational\nlogic of actuality and speed (preeminent in concepts such as reporting on breaking news,\ngetting the story first); and having a social responsibility and ethical sensibility (Deuze,\n2005). This conceptualization is still strong within the field today and seems to endure\neven in the midst of profound changes and challenges to the profession.\nThrough the occupational ideology of journalism, we can define the field from the\ninside out, helping us to understand how the profession makes sense of itself. External\ndefinitions of journalism tend to be more functional and instrumental, where the profes-\nsion is considered to provide a particular function for (democratic) society, `informing\ncitizens in a way that enables them to act as citizens' (Costera Meijer, 2001: 13). Seen\nfrom such a function-specific perspective, journalism gets identified distinct from other\nmedia professions (such as public relations) `as a societal system providing society with\nfact-based, relevant and current information' (G\u00f6rke and Scholl, 2007: 651). Beyond sys-\ntems theory \u00ad with its reluctance to be normative about what journalism could or should\nbe \u00ad democratic theories of the profession attribute it a seminal status, as Michael\nSchudson (2003), for example, defines `journalism [a]s the business or practice of produc-\ning and disseminating information about contemporary affairs of general public interest\nand importance' (p. 11). Schudson (2008) sees journalism in terms of what it `can do for\ndemocracy'(p. 11), where journalism informs, investigates, analyzes, mobilizes, provides\nmultiple perspectives and a public forum, and publicizes representative democracy.\nFrom this point of departure, the literature diverges, one strand embracing universalist\nnotions of journalism, showing how it gives meaning to itself in its culture \u00ad where cul-\nture is seen as the way in which a particular group (i.e. journalists working at a specific\nproject or within a particular context, such as a newsroom, a medium, a country or\nregion) works and how group members make sense of this. Thomas Hanitzsch (2007)\ndefines this `universal' culture of journalism as constituted by its institutional role in\nsociety, its epistemology, and its ethical ideology. Surveys of (and interviews with) jour-\nnalists, almost always sampled from within legacy news organizations, fuel such claims\nby asking journalists a set of standardized questions about role perceptions and profes-\nsional values. They suggest consensus and add coherence to a `global' journalism that is\nas aspirational as it is universal among working journalists (L\u00f6ffelholz and Weaver,\nWhile popular, there is also much critical debate both among newsworkers and jour-\nnalism students and scholars about an assumed homogeneity of the profession. The dis-\ncussion on the elements of journalism (Kovach and Rosenstiel, 2014) tends to assume a\nmore or less stable core of news values and professional standards. This is a problematic\nassumption in the case of journalism, as the reference to a consensual core (of `ele-\nments') excludes marginalized and minority voices, practices, and forms of journalism.\nGenerally lacking formal boundaries and therefore relying on communication about\nitself to define and validate its privileged position in society, journalism recently has\nbeen reconceptualized in terms of its continuous boundary work, consisting of `efforts to\nestablish and enlarge the limits of one domain's institutional authority relative to outsid-\ners, thus creating social boundaries that yield greater cultural and material resources for\ninsiders' (Lewis, 2012: 841). Research among journalists working for organizations,\ncompanies, or units both within mainstream news media and those on the sidelines shows\nhow they engage repeatedly in boundary work, intensely debating what journalism is and\nwho can be considered to be a (`real') journalist \u00ad and that such discussions have always\nbeen intrinsic to the profession and its associated praxis (Carlson and Lewis, 2015).\nEven journalism's assumed significance for the functioning of democracies has come\nunder serious scrutiny. Beate Josephi (2013) argues that such a corollary is `too limiting\nand distorting a lens through which journalism can be viewed in the 21st century' (p.\n445). The consolidation of journalism studies in the literature mainly serves the modern\nproject of bringing an inherently unruly object under control (Steensen and Ahva, 2015:\n3). It is crucial to recognize that the supposed core of journalism as well as the assumed\nconsistency of the inner workings of news organizations is anything but consensual, nor\nis it necessarily the norm. At the same time, it would be a mistake to assume that the\ntypes of journalism emerging outside and alongside legacy news organizations are nec-\nessarily different or oppositional to the core values, ideals, and practices of the profes-\nsion.Weproposeto widenjournalisticconceptualizationsbeyondthefalsecore\u00adperiphery\ndichotomy, understanding that the core is no more homogeneous than the so-called\nperiphery, while neither necessarily represents the other's antithesis.\nWe have to revisit the question of what journalism is for conceptual considerations \u00ad\nthe normative construction of journalism through ideology and culture as reinforced in\nboth scholarly work and professional publications \u00ad and practical propriety \u00ad given the\nincreasingly fragmented, networked, and atypical nature of the labor market for news-\nwork. When answering this question, theory needs to move beyond the limitations fram-\ning this discussion: An overreliance on journalism as an inherently stable institution,\ndistinct from other social systems, and beyond its validation as uniquely necessary for\ndemocracy. These notions, however important, have over-extended their shelf life\n(Zelizer, 2013). We argue for theorizing journalism from the ground up \u00ad focusing on\nwhere, how, by whom, and why `the lost labour of reporting' (Compton and Benedetti,\nToward a dynamic definition of journalism\nUntil recently, the participation of journalists in the discursive construction of journalism\nwas governed by being employed in (or as a student, intern, or scholar: Observing) a\nnewsroom. The newsroom was the dominant form of employment and organization of\nwork in journalism throughout the 20th century. This arrangement served to stabilize the\nindustry, going hand in hand with the shaping of consensual practices in journalism stud-\nies and education. The newsroom was the site to be a journalist, to be recognized as such,\nand scholars validated this process by pursuing empirical approaches dedicated to news-\nrooms and the newswork therein. Throughout the history of journalism studies, high-\nprofile and much-cited newsroom studies have appeared, from David Manning-White's\n(1950) work on the gatekeeping selections at a metropolitan newspaper via seminal work\nby Jeremy Tunstall (1971) and Gaye Tuchman (1978) to more recent newsroom studies\nEven though these studies have been important in shedding light onto newsrooms,\nthey focus on `problematic sites of fieldwork as well', as Anderson (2011: 152) notes.\nAnderson points out that the traditional newsrooms `cannot serve as our only model for\nfieldwork' as `the very definition of journalism is being contested on a daily basis'\n(Anderson, 2011). This is not simply an operational problem in the current climate of\nnewswork destabilization. Our critique is more fundamental: Throughout its history,\nscholars of journalism and the news have supported the dominance of certain interpreta-\ntions of (the role of) journalism by focusing on specific institutional arrangements within\nparticular privileged settings. As Karin Wahl-Jorgensen (2009) puts it, the newsroom-\ncentricity in journalism studies has meant that\nscholars have tended to focus on journalists' culture as it emerges within the limited areas of\nnewsrooms and other centralized sites for news production, usually paying scant attention to\nplaces, spaces, practices and people at the margins of this spatially delimited news production\nSuch newsroom-centricity has implications beyond the mere privileging of some\nactors and exclusion of others: It has also led to an emphasis on `routinized and con-\ntrolled forms and aspects of newswork'(Karin Wahl-Jorgensen, 2009: 25). The scholarly\nconsensus on professional routines that make up newswork in newsrooms has been con-\nsolidated in journalism education where such routines become fixed elements in the\ncoursework for print, broadcast, and online sequences. Cottle (2007) notes how such a\nfocus on `organizational functionalism' (p. 10) privileges routines and patterned ways of\ndoing newswork over differentiation and divergence. What is more, even within news-\nroom-centered research, scholars have privileged print over other media, further limiting\nthe range of understanding and definition of journalism. Moreover, the scholarly focus\non elite, prestige, and glamorous institutions located in large cities of the capitalist\nWestern world serves to solidify such places as the only ones deemed worthy of a voice\nto articulate what is journalism and who counts as a journalist (Nerone, 2013).\nAs much of newsgathering, editing, and packaging take place elsewhere, outside of\nthe newsroom, and with organizations virtualizing their workflow delegating work to\nstringers and correspondents on the road, Wahl-Jorgensen (2009) notes how the news-\nroom is disappearing. Anderson (2011) advocates `blowing up the newsroom'when con-\nducting contemporary newswork studies, proposing an approach that would consider\nnews production as a network that transcends organizational boundaries. And yet,\nAnderson (2011) concludes, `The newsroom is not extinct. In many ways, it is more\nimportant than ever, for it remains, even now, a central locus in which a variety of frag-\nmented actor-networks find themselves tied together to create an occupation' (p. 160).\nIt is a challenge to consider journalism as a networked practice (Russell, 2015)\ninvolving a distributed variety of actors and actants (including co-creating audiences as\nwell as robots producing news), including an emerging global startup scene of news-\nwork (K\u00fcng, 2015) while recognizing the permanence of meaning-giving structures,\nsuch as the newsroom. The more or less formal (and professional) arrangement of jour-\nnalism requires an awareness of the inhabited nature (Hallett and Ventresca, 2006) of\nthe spaces where newswork takes place. The newsroom as an inhabited institution, on\none hand, provides the raw materials and guidelines for the way people work, and on the\nother hand, the various people moving in and out of the newsroom through their interac-\ntions produce the institution, putting it into motion. The focus in this conceptualization\nof newswork is on `institutional complexity' (Delbridge and Edwards, 2013: 927) and\nheterogeneous understandings of occupational membership (Bechky, 2011: 1157). The\npoint is not to say that contemporary news institutions are inhabited, and those in the\npast were not. As Matt Carlson suggests, journalism has always already been `a varied\ncultural practice embedded within a complicated social landscape. Journalism is not a\nsolid, stable thing to point to, but a constantly shifting denotation applied differently\nThe roles of institutions in newswork are dynamic and changing, opening our eyes to\nmovement rather than stability, to what journalism becomes rather than what journalism\nUnderstanding news as work\nIf we assume for a moment that in some ways the newsroom is still important and key to\nunderstanding what contemporary journalism is, what would we in fact see inside one\nlocated in a legacy media organization? For one, we would observe a lot of empty chairs.\nThe number of layoffs in journalism \u00ad especially in print \u00ad has been nothing but astound-\ning over the last decade. Reports of journalism unions and associations, such as the\nMedia, Entertainment &ArtsAlliance inAustralia, the Society of Professional Journalists\nin the United States, the National Association of Journalists in The Netherlands, and the\nNational Union of Journalists in the United Kingdom in recent years, suggest their mem-\nbers see their colleagues being fired and not replaced, as journalists working in news-\nrooms consistently report having to do more with fewer colleagues and less resources.\nLong-term planning and `moving up the ladder' have been replaced by job-hopping and\na portfolio work life as news professionals increasingly have contracts, not careers in\njournalism. As a consequence, stress and burnout are on the rise among newsworkers,\nwith many journalists considering to leave the profession altogether (O'Donnell et al.,\nhave come to define the lived experience for many inside the contemporary newsroom.\nOf the people who are left in the newsroom proper, some still enjoy permanent\nemployment (including benefits and protections). These, generally senior, staffers\nwork side by side with a host of colleagues in part-time, contract, freelance, temporary,\ncasual, and at times underpaid or unpaid roles: Practitioners who come in irregularly\nto file stories, produce segments, push stories online, or provide other editorial ser-\nvices (Cohen, 2015: 515). Not only are these contractual working arrangements of\nnewsroom colleagues under-represented in discussions of the profession (about itself)\nand, subsequently, in surveys and ethnographies of news organizations, but also the\nmyriad of additional functions in the newsroom ranging from technical support staff,\ncopy editors, ombudsmen and reader representatives, designers, producers, and pro-\ngrammers are often left out of the conversation. In recent years, however, such func-\ntions have multiplied in the newsroom with the emergence of new roles and positions,\nand they are increasingly important in shaping the practice, output, and distribution of\nPermanent jobs are scarce, and generally unpaid internships and other forms of free or\nunderpaid labor now determine access \u00ad as in other cultural industries (Hesmondhalgh\nand Baker, 2011). All this is accompanied by rising cost of entry into journalism: A trade\nschool diploma is a bare minimum \u00ad for jobs in the (national) quality news media, in\npractice a high-level university education is required. Student grants have been cut, their\nduration shortened, or they have been converted into loans. The majority of newcomers\nin the profession start as a self-employed journalist. Tariffs for freelancer journalists\nhave declined over the past decade. To use The Netherlands as a particular example, not\nonly has freelance remuneration declined (up to 50% for news photographers), but also\nalmost half of Dutch freelance journalists today depend on the income of their partner,\npercent have monthly earnings well below the minimum wage (Vinken and\nIJdens, 2013). Given the stable market and state-subsidized media system of The\nNetherlands, we would venture that this situation is the same, if not more precarious for\nprofessionals in other developed nations.\nWe need to consider how changes in the way in which newswork is organized do not\nonly affect news as an institution but also impact individual careers. Peterson and Anand\n(2004) suggested that careers in this fragmenting and flexibilizing industry tend to fol-\nlow two different paths. The first is a top-down career, largely established through life-\nlong participation in vertically structured institutions, where seniority, experience, and a\ntransparent system of salaries guide the professional toward higher positions in the office\nhierarchy, resulting in more or less permanent positions within the newsroom. In more\ncompetitive environments where the organization of work is tailored toward flexible\nproduction, `careers tend to be chaotic and foster cultural innovation, and career-building\nmarket-sensing entrepreneurs enact careers from the \"bottom up\" by starting from the\nmargins of existing professions and conventions' (p. 317). Today, a third trajectory can\nbe added: The `patchwork-career' (Michel, 2000) of the atypically employed individual\nfinding his or her permanence in impermanence, forever flexibilized on the outside as\nwell as on the inside of news institutions.\nNewsrooms are still creating positions, yet often these are temporary structures\ndesigned as more or less informal internships, often with little or no pay. Moreover, the\nnew jobs that are available in journalism tend to be in the digital area and in numbers do\nnot make up for layoffs elsewhere in organizations (Deuze and Fortunati, 2010). With the\naccelerating dynamic of reorganizations and reshuffling, buyouts and layoffs, new own-\ners and managers, new work arrangements and budget cuts, journalism has become more\nprecarious and less accessible to everyone. In fact, if we put it provocatively, it increas-\ningly seems to be the playing field of only those who can afford to work for years or even\nfor the majority of their careers below or around the minimum wage in the largest and\ntherefore most expensive cities, as that is where the main news outfits (as well as most\nhyperlocal companies and news startups) are generally located.\nAlthough exclusivity of industry access is not new, it tends to be overlooked. This\ncritique of journalism studies'tendency to overlook the dimensions of labor and working\nconditions as these influence the news is not particular to journalism studies but can be\nmade about most media studies. In fact, only in recent years has labor enjoyed a surge in\nscholarly attention across media, cultural, and creative industries (Banks et al., 2013;\nDeuze, 2007b; Hesmondhalgh and Baker, 2011). Incorporating work into media studies\nallows us to address the diversity in roles, functions, and people's backgrounds that\nexists in media work generally and newswork in particular (Siegelbaum and Thomas,\n2016), providing insight into how professional journalism has diversified into many dif-\nferent forms of reporting and newsgathering, production, and distribution.\nConsidering the organization of post-industrial journalism\nAccording to Anderson et al. (2012), journalism is evolving toward a `post-industrial'\nmodel of news. They argue that in order for journalism to adapt to the new media envi-\nronment (with its attendant social, economic, and cultural implications), the profession\nneeds new tactics, a new self-conception, and new organizational structures. What their\nreport alludes to is a trend benchmarked by developments across the creative industries\nmore generally: A gradual shift from centralized and hierarchical modes of industrial\nproduction to what Castells (2010) coined as a `network enterprise' form of production.\nThe relationships of capital and labor in our at once global and local network society,\nargues Castells, are increasingly individualized. This type of post-industrial mode of\nproduction integrates the work process globally through digital telecommunications,\ntransportation, and client\u00adcustomer networks. Workers find themselves collaborating or\ncoordinating their activities with professionals elsewhere, sometimes located in different\nparts of the world. Furthermore, newswork increasingly takes place with the formal or\ninformal collaboration of the public, who participate on a co-creative continuum ranging\nfrom sharing real-time information all the way to authoring autonomous news stories,\nshaping an emerging type of networked journalism (Beckett, 2010).\nConsidering the role of journalism in an always online environment, Van Der Haak\net al. (2012) see the emergence of a new professional figure: The `networked journalist',\nwhose work is `driven by a networked practice dependent on sources, commentaries, and\nfeedback, some of which are constantly accessible online' (p. 2927). They consider this\nnew role for journalists `not a threat to the independence and quality of professional\njournalism, but a liberation from strict corporate control' (Van Der Haak et al., 2012:\n2935). The networked character of newswork gets amplified by a particular feature of the\ncorporate character of the global news industry: The often translocalized nature of the\nmedia production process, as media industries cross-finance, offshore, subcontract, and\noutsource various elements in the production process to save costs and redistribute risks.\nIn journalism, outsourcing is called `remote control journalism' as news organizations\nmove specializations or entire divisions to another part of the world (Compton and\nrefers to the increased reliance of legacy news organizations on local contacts, handlers,\nstringers, and correspondents in (conflict) areas around the world (rather than sending\ncontracted employees).2\nLike media work elsewhere, post-industrial newswork still tends to take place not\nonly in the offices and on the work floors of specific institutions \u00ad including newsrooms\n\u00ad but also at home, the atelier-style offices of editorial collectives and journalism start-\nups, and in free Wi-Fi caf\u00e9 environments as the landscape of urban media production\n(Hartmann, 2009). As much of this work is contingent, freelance, and temporary, people\nconstantly move in and out of such environments, continuously reconstituting the pro-\nduction process. Furthermore, under conditions of a changing media culture that is more\ninteractive and co-creative (Jenkins, 2006), media professionals as well as their audi-\nences are increasingly (expected to be) working together, to converse and co-create. This\nprocess accelerates the flow of people, processes, and ideas through the networked enter-\nprise that journalism becomes (Heinrich, 2011).\nConsidering the individualized precarious and networked context of newswork, it\nbecomes imperative to critically interrogate the notion of `organization' as the opera-\ntional framework for analyzing what it is like to do journalism and be a journalist. The\nemphasis in studies of contemporary organizations has been shifting from explaining the\nbehavior of the organization as a macro-structural entity to embracing organizations as\nopen systems of interdependent activities, linking shifting coalitions of participants in\nintra- and interorganizational networks (Baker and Faulkner, 2005). In this light, Gernot\nGrabher (2002) suggests we shift our focus from the media firm as a generally unprob-\nlematized coherent and unitary economic actor to organizational practices that are built\naround projects, involving a project ecology of shifting alliances (or teams) of people\nfrom inside and outside the company.\nLooking at temporary projects and collaborations enables us to focus on organizations\nas loosely integrated units of individuals working together \u00ad possibly including partici-\npants from different disciplines, with different working arrangements, and with different\nprofessional identities, along with collaborating publics. This allows for the equally nec-\nessary "
