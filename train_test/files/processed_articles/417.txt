The association between the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and an increased\nrisk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease remains unclear.\nMethods. We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study of the risk factors associated with metabolic\nsyndrome and cardiovascular disease among patients from an urban outpatient human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) clinic. Evaluation included laboratory data that were obtained after an overnight fast and a health survey\nthat assessed traditional risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, HIV-related factors, and comorbidities.\nData collected were compared with data files from a cohort from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES; 2001\u00ad2002) of persons who were seronegative for HIV infection who were matched for age,\nsex, race, and tobacco use.\nResults. Four hundred seventy-one HIV-infected subjects provided complete data. The overall prevalence of\nmetabolic syndrome was similar between the group HIV-infected patients and the group of persons who were\nseronegative for HIV infection (25.5% vs. 26.5%, respectively), although the HIV-infected patients had a significantly\nsmaller waist circumference, lower body mass index, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, higher\ntriglyceride levels, and lower glucose levels, compared with the subjects from the NHANES cohort. Framingham\n10-year risk scores were also similar between the 2 groups. HIV-infected patients with metabolic syndrome were\nmore likely to be diabetic, older, and white and have a high CD4 cell count and body mass index, compared with\npatients without metabolic syndrome ( for all). The type or duration of antiretroviral therapy was not an\nindependent risk factor for metabolic syndrome.\nConclusions. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high among HIV-infected persons, but not higher than\nthe prevalence among HIV-uninfected persons. Traditional risk factors play a more significant role in the devel-\nopment of metabolic syndrome than do HIV treatment\u00adassociated factors.\nHAART has resulted in sustained reductions of mor-\nbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection [1,\n2]. Unfortunately, HAART has also been associated\nwith metabolic complications that may increase pa-\ntients' risk of cardiovascular disease [3\u00ad5].

These characteristics are components\nof metabolic syndrome and are risk factors for diabetes\nand cardiovascular disease in the general population\n[8\u00ad10]. Protease inhibitors (PIs) in particular have been\nassociated with an increased risk of cardiovascular dis-\nease [11\u00ad13], possibly in part because of their negative\neffect on lipids [14].\nRecent studies of HIV-infected persons have revealed\na high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among pa-\ntients receiving HAART [15, 16]. Reported prevalence\nrates have been higher than rates reported for matched\nHIV-infected populations, yet they are similar to or\neven less than the 22%\u00ad24% rate of prevalence reported\nrecently for the general US population [9]. Other data suggest\nthat the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome among\nHIV-infected persons may be more reflective of the burgeoning\nepidemic of obesity than a predominant effect of HAART [17].\nCurrently, data are lacking on risk for development of metabolic\nsyndrome in HIV-infected persons, particularly in HIV-infected\nwomen and minorities, who represent an increasing proportion\nof the US and global HIV-infected population. HIV treatment\nguidelines recommend screening patients for metabolic com-\nplications and providing therapeutic interventions [18, 19].\nSuch measures may include intensified efforts to assess patients\nfor risk factors for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular dis-\nease as part of standard-of-care. For this study, the medical\nrecords of HIV-infected patients were reviewed to obtain risk\nfactors for cardiovascular disease and laboratory data to (1)\ndetermine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among a di-\nverse HIV-infected outpatient population; (2) compare the\nprevalence of metabolic syndrome and diabetes with a contem-\nporary US cohort of HIV-uninfected individuals who were\nmatched for age, sex, race, and tobacco use; and (3) determine\nthe risk factors for the development of metabolic syndrome\nthat are unique to HIV-infected patients.\nMETHODS\nDesign. This was a prospective, cross-sectional evaluation of\npatients' risk for the development of metabolic syndrome and\ncardiovascular disease. As part of standard-of-care, all HIV-\ninfected patients who attended the Washington University HIV\nClinic (St. Louis, MO) during January\u00adJuly 2005 completed a\ncardiovascular risk survey with their providers. The survey in-\ncluded evaluations of traditional cardiac risk factors, HIV-\nrelated factors (duration of HIV infection and HAART, current\nmedications, and nadir CD4 cell count), comorbid conditions,\nand use of medications for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Pro-\nviders reviewed all information with patients, verified fasting\nstatus, and obtained lipid and glucose measurements, blood\npressure, height, weight, and waist circumference. Providers\nobtained patients' waist circumference in accordance with the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) standard protocol [20].\nThe most recent HIV RNA level and CD4 cell count (from\nwithin 3 months of survey completion) were obtained from\nthe medical chart and used for analysis. Pregnant women were\nexcluded from the analysis. Traditional risk factors for meta-\nbolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease were compared with\nthose obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-\nFramingham 10-year risk score was calculated for all patients\n[22]. The study was reviewed and approved by the Washington\nUniversity Institutional Review Board.\nDefinitions. According to National Cholesterol Education\nProgram (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines [10],\nmetabolic syndrome was defined as having 3 of the following\ncriteria: abdominal obesity (waist circumference 102 cm for\nmen and 88 cm for women), fasting triglyceride levels 150\nmg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level !40\nmg/dL for men and !50 mg/dL for women, fasting glucose\n130/85 mm Hg or current receipt of medication for hyper-\ntension). For both the NHANES cohort and the cohort of HIV-\ninfected patients, use of a lipid-lowering agent was defined as\nuse of a statin, fibrate, or niacin agent. An antihypertensive was\nany drug used to treat high blood pressure. Obesity was defined\nas a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilo-\ngrams divided by the square of height in meters) 30. HAART\nwas defined as the use of 2 nucleosides (NRTIs) and a non-\nnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), 2 NRTIs\nand a PI, or an NNRTI and a PI. Patients receiving triple-\nnucleoside therapy only were not included in this analysis.\nAnalysis. Data were analyzed using x2 or Fisher's exact tests\nfor categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared\nusing Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test for normally\nand nonnormally distributed variables. Partial correlationstest-\ning was used to test the strength of association between the\ndiagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome and other clinical\nvariables for the cohort of HIV-infected patients. Significant\nvariables were entered stepwise into a multiple logistic regres-\nsion model to determine the best multivariate model. NCEP\ncriteria for metabolic syndrome were not included in multi-\nvariate analyses. Instead, they were analyzed separately in a\nsubanalysis focused on determining the risk (OR) of individual\nNCEP criterion for metabolic syndrome diagnosis. HIV RNA\nlevels were log-transformed. All P values were 2-tailed.\nFor comparisons between the cohorts of patients infected\nwith HIV and patients seronegative for HIV infection, HIV-\ninfected patients were randomly matched to subjects from the\nand Prevention Web site [21]). Subjects from the NHANES\ncohort were randomly chosen from those who matched our\npatients according to age (within 3 years), sex, race, and smok-\ning status. HIV testing was only performed for subjects in the\nNHANES cohort who were !50 years of age; thus, we could\nonly be certain that subjects in the NHANES cohort who were\n!50 years of age were not infected with HIV. However, the\nnumber of patients in the cohort of HIV-infected patients who\nwere 50 years of age was generally low (16%), and the number\nof HIV-infected persons in the NHANES cohort who were 50\nyears of age was likely quite low. For predictors that were sig-\nnificantly different between the 2 cohorts, additional multiple\nregression analyses were performed controlling for age, race,\nsex, and BMI to determine predictors of individual NCEP cri-\nterion. Data were analyzed with use of the SPSS software pack-\nTable 1.

Using\nmultivariate analyses excluding the 5 NCEP criteria, significant\npredictors of metabolic syndrome among HIV-infected patients\nwere older age, a higher CD4 cell count, white race, and a\nhigher BMI ( for all predictors). The comparison of\npatients with and without metabolic syndrome revealed no sig-\nnificant differences with respect to the use of HAART or the\ntype of HAART (figure 1).\nA separate analysis was performed for the patients in the\nHIV-infected cohort to identify the contribution of each in-\ndividual NCEP criterion towards diagnosis of metabolic syn-\ndrome. Despite a high prevalence of a low HDL level and high\ntriglyceride levels, the presence of either an elevated fasting\nglucose level or hypertension were the strongest contributors\nWe also explored the finding of an increased CD4 cell count\nas an independent predictor of the occurrence of metabolic\nsyndrome in HIV-infected patients. An increased CD4 cell\ncount was a strong predictor of 2 NCEP criteria (elevated tri-\nglyceride and glucose levels; ) after controlling for age,\nsex, race, and BMI. Likewise, an increased CD4 cell count cor-\nrelated with the presence of an increased number of metabolic\nsyndrome criteria and an increased BMI ( for both; figure\n2A and 2B). The change in CD4 cell count (from nadir to\ncurrent value) also tended to correlate with an increased num-\nber of metabolic syndrome criteria ( ).\nSex and HIV-infected patients.

Among the gen-\neral US population, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome ap-\npears to differ among African American and white men and\nwomen [9]; therefore, we examined this difference among the\npatients in the HIV-infected cohort.

Overall, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the\npatients in the HIV-infected cohort was not significantly dif-\nferent between men and women when stratified by race (22%\nwomen vs. 21% men among African Americans subjects and\n29% women vs. 32% men among white subjects).\nThe HIV-infected cohort vs. the NHANES cohort. The\noverall prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the Framingham\nscores were similar between the HIV-infected and NHANES\ncohorts. However, individual metabolic parameters differedsig-\nnificantly (table 3). HIV-infected patients with metabolic syn-\ndrome had smaller waist circumferences, lower BMIs, lower\nHDL cholesterol levels, higher triglyceride levels, and lower\nglucose levels, compared with patients in the NHANES cohort\nwith metabolic syndrome ( for all). Despite the higher\nprevalence of dyslipidemia in the HIV-infected patients, com-\npared with the patients in the NHANES cohort, nearly twice\nas many HIV-infected patients were already receiving lipid-\nThe effects of HAART.

Other HIV-related predictors, such as nadir CD4\ncell count, current use or duration of HAART, or current use\nof other specific antiretroviral drugs were not found to be sig-\nnificantly associated with dyslipidemia or other risk factors for\nmetabolic syndrome during multivariate analyses. Our obser-\nvations of the HIV-infected and NHANES cohorts combined\nrevealed that HIV infection was a significant independent pre-\ndictor of both elevated triglyceride levels and low HDL cho-\nlesterol level ( for both), after controlling for demo-\ngraphic and other traditional cardiac risk factors.\nTable 3.

Nonetheless, the prevalence rate was\nsimilar to a well-matched, current population of HIV-unin-\nfected individuals. For the patients in the HIV-infected cohort\nand excluding NCEP criteria, traditional factors (e.g., older age\nand higher BMI), higher CD4 cell count, and white race were\nthe strongest predictors of the presence of metabolic syndrome.\nUnexpectedly, the duration and type of HAART were not strong\npredictors. Among the 5 NCEP criteria for metabolic syndrome,\nthe presence of elevated fasting glucose or hypertension in as-\nsociation with HIV infection carried the highest risk of devel-\nopment of metabolic syndrome. Most HIV-infected patients\nwith either of these diagnoses also tended to meet additional\nNCEP criteria for metabolic syndrome. In summary, among\nHIV-infected persons, traditional risk factors were more im-\nportant predictors of metabolic syndrome than therapy-related\nfactors.\nAmong HIV-related factors, although a higher CD4 cell\ncount was an independent predictor of the development of\nmetabolic syndrome, a higher BMI accounted for a substantial\npart of the CD4-attributable risk. Other studies have found a\nlower CD4 cell count to be associated with metabolic syndrome\nor increased cardiovascular risk [16, 24\u00ad26]. However, the cur-\nrent findings are consistent with the expected increase of weight,\nimproved nutritional and immunologic status that occurs with\neffective anti-HIV therapy, and prolonged survival. The mean-\ning of this finding is not clear, but it may reflect the physio-\nlogical changes (unknown mechanisms) that accompany im-\nmune reconstitution or viral suppression. Better adherence to\nHAART was an unlikely factor, because similar percentages of\npatients with and without metabolic syndrome had an unde-\ntectable viral load. These potential links need to be examined\nfurther.\nIn the general US population, epidemic rates of obesity, in-\nsulin resistance, hypertension, and associated complications [9,\n27] have been noted during recent years. The current findings\nsuggest that HIV-infected persons treated with HAART are not\nspared from this emerging epidemic, as demonstrated by their\nhigh rates of obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dysli-\npidemia. These findings, along with a lack of independent ef-\nfects of HAART on metabolic syndrome, support the notion\nthat these traditional risk factors (i.e., hypertension, hypergly-\ncemia, and obesity) may be more important than HAART-\nrelated factors for the prediction of metabolic syndrome and\ncardiovascular disease risk. The prevalence of diabetes was sim-\nilar between the cohort of HIV-infected patients and the NHA-\nNES cohort, and mean fasting glucose levels were significantly\nlower in HIV-infected persons than in HIV-uninfected indi-\nviduals. A recent study reported a high prevalence of diabetes\nin men receiving HAART [28], but these findings may also\nreflect the high prevalence of diabetes among US adults (es-\nprevalence of diabetes among our clinic population. The high\nprevalence of hypertension among the patients in the HIV-\ninfected cohort was also similar to the NHANES sample pop-\nulation and was comparable to the reported prevalence rates\nof hypertension for the general populations of North America\nAn important finding was the higher prevalence of dyslipi-\ndemia, despite the greater use of lipid-lowering therapy for\nHIV-infected patients than for HIV-uninfected persons, al-\nthough these cohorts had similar prevalences of metabolic syn-\ndrome. HIV infection is associated with an increase in triglyc-\neride levels and a decrease in HDL level [31, 32]. Stavudine\nand PI use may also contribute to hypertriglyceridemia [33],\nwhich was consistent with our findings. Although dyslipidemia\nwas predominant in the patients in our HIV-infected cohort,\nwe found the presence of either hypertension or hyperglycemia\ncarried a significantly more likely association with metabolic\nsyndrome than the presence of high triglyceride levels, a low\nHDL level, or an elevated waist circumference. These results\nsuggest that HIV and HAART-related dyslipidemia often occur\nas lone phenomena, whereas other traditional risk factors (i.e.,\nhypertension and obesity) may occur as a cluster and, thus,\ncarry higher risk for metabolic syndrome. Because use of lipid-\nlowering therapy itself was not a criterion for having metabolic\nsyndrome, it is possible that our study underestimated the prev-\nalence of metabolic syndrome. However, more HIV-infected\npatients than subjects of the NHANES cohort still had dysli-\npidemia that met NCEP criteria. Standard pharmacologic treat-\nments for dyslipidemia in this HIV-infected cohort [19] were\nlikely suboptimal because of the concurrent adverse effects of\nHIV infection and HAART.\nAlthough numerous studies have implicated PIs as important\nuse of PIs was not found to be an independent risk factor for\nmetabolic syndrome when controlling for other demographic\nand traditional risk factors. Furthermore, when we compared\nthe effects of specific PIs on lipid parameters and metabolic\nsyndrome risk, we were unable to find any significant differ-\nences. However, nearly all of our patients who were receiving\na PI-based regimen were using pharmacokinetic boosting with\nlow-dose ritonavir therapy. Recent data have shown that even\nthe \"lipid-friendly\" PI atazanavir may cause a small but sig-\nnificant elevation in triglyceride and total cholesterol levels\nwhen boosted with low-dose ritonavir therapy [34]. Although\nstavudine use has been associated with lipoatrophy, dyslipi-\nwere observed at our clinic were currently receiving this drug;\ntherefore, we likely did not have adequate power to detect any\nsignificant effect of current stavudine use on the risk for met-\nabolic syndrome.\nSurprisingly, race and sex were not independent predictors\nof metabolic syndrome in the patients in our HIV-infected\ncohort. Among African Americans in the general US popula-\ntion, women have a 57% higher prevalence of metabolic syn-\ndrome, compared with men [9]. Also, recent evidence indicates\nthat the prevalence of obesity is high (30%) for African Amer-\nican women [17]. We found an even higher prevalence of obe-\nsity among the African American women (45%, compared with\n16% of African American men) in our cohort. Among African\nAmericans, however, men had higher levels of triglycerides and\nlower levels of HDL cholesterol than did women. These findings\nhelp to explain the lack of difference in the prevalence of met-\nabolic syndrome between men and women when stratified by\nrace. Additionally, these findings support the notion that HIV-\ninfected men and women may have different sex-specific risk\nfactors for the metabolic syndrome.\nOur study had several limitations. First, the use of specific\nantiretrovirals over a long period of time may have had long-\nlasting, irreversible metabolic effects that were not captured in\nthis analysis. Given the large number of patients in our cohort,\nit was difficult to obtain reliable, complete antiretroviral his-\ntories with regard to the duration of the use of each antiret-\nroviral drug. Also, the use of the fasting glucose level alone to\ndiagnose impaired glucose tolerance likely underestimated the\nprevalence of insulin resistance, not only among the patients\nof the HIV-infected cohort, but also among the subjects of the\nNHANES cohort. Currently, oral glucose tolerance testing is\nnot routine, standard-of-care for HIV infection and can be\ndifficult to obtain, even from patients at risk for diabetes. Fi-\nnally, an assumption has been made that HIV-infected persons\nwith metabolic syndrome are at similar cardiovascular risk,\ncompared with HIV-uninfected persons with metabolic syn-\ndrome, but the phenotype often differs between these 2 pop-\nulations. In particular, HIV-infected persons may have signif-\nicant peripheral lipoatrophy that contributes to insulin\nresistance and an elevated waist-to-hip ratio. Recent studies\nsuggest that HIV-infected persons receiving HAART have a\nhigher risk of acquiring diabetes [28] and, therefore, are likely\nto have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease [11]. These\nobservations support the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in\nHIV-infected persons as a likely predictor of higher risk for\ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease, and it may serve as a sim-\nple, useful screening tool for this patient population.\nIn conclusion, although we found a high prevalence of met-\nabolic syndrome among HIV-infected patients, this diagnosis\nwas strongly associated with traditional cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors rather than HAART-related effects. Additional longitudinal\nstudies are needed to determine whether metabolic syndrome\nis equally predictive of future diabetes and heart disease in HIV-\ninfected persons compared with HIV-uninfected persons.\n"
