Disability questions require older people to report difficulties with everyday activities, using broad categorical\nresponses. Relatively little is known about population group differences in the thresholds for reporting difficulty or inability\nwith medium-distance mobility against tested mobility-related performance. We aimed to estimate the thresholds on tested\nperformance at which self-reports change from one category to another, across a range of sociodemographic subgroups. We\nalso aimed to compare reported and tested performance across two national population studies.\nMethods. The samples were from the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES III) and the\nLongitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Measures of gait speed, chair stands, and peak expiratory flow rate in both\nstudies yielded the validated index of mobility-related physical limitations (MOBLI). Latent probit models were used to\nestimate cutpoints (thresholds) on the index for reporting difficulty or inability to walk a medium distance.\nResults. Thresholds for reporting difficulty or inability were studied by age, sex, race, educational level, and income in\nNHANES III. In models adjusting for the other factors, performance thresholds for reporting disability categories varied by\nage and income. The younger elderly persons in NHANES III on average reported difficulties or inabilities only when they\nreached a more severe level of tested limitation compared with older old persons. A similar pattern exists for those on higher\nincomes. For race, differences in threshold were present only for reporting inability, but not difficulty. Significant differences\nin thresholds were not present between groups defined by sex or for years of education. Comparisons between the NHANES\nand LASA studies show that lower reported mobility difficulty or inability prevalence in the Dutch sample is attributable\nboth to reporting at higher levels of limitation and to better functioning.\nConclusions. There is evidence of differences in thresholds for reporting mobility disability, especially across age and\nincome groups in older Americans. Further work is needed to understand the perceptual, attitudinal, or environmental\nfactors that cause these reporting differences.\nAS THE population ages, accurate monitoring of the\nhealth of older people grows more important. Older\npeople typically suffer from several diseases simulta-\nneously, and therefore disability, reflecting the impact and\nseverity of these diseases, provides an important focus for\naging research. Disability is a risk factor for dependence,\ninstitutionalization, and health care utilization (1).\nQuestions on disability require respondents to report levels\nof difficulty (e.g., none, some, much, or unable) without\nindicating when these terms should be used. The categorical\nresponses identify groups with functional decline due, most\ncommonly, to arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive\nimpairment (2). However, the environment also influences\ndifficulty with everyday tasks: Older people faced with high\nambient temperatures or upward slopes, for example, may\nreport difficulty walking a quarter of a mile at relatively less\nsevere levels of physical health problems than those facing\nnormal temperatures or flat ground. In addition, attitudes\ntoward reporting difficulty might also influence responses,\nwith differing thresholds for admitting difficulty. The net\nresult of these factors is so-called ``response category\ncutpoint shifts'' for self-reported health status (3).\nOne way of conceptualizing the response categories to\ndisability questions is to see them as resulting from\na mapping process onto a continuous measure of relevant\naspects of physical health. The transition from reporting ``no\ndifficulty'' to ``difficulty'' occurs at a cutpoint or threshold\non the underlying physical health status measure. If cutpoints\ndiffer systematically across populations, or even across\nsociodemographic groups within a population, then the\ndisability reports are not comparable. A striking example of\nshifted thresholds is from Kerala State in India, which has the\nlowest mortality and illiteracy rates but consistently has the\nhighest self-reported morbidity rates (4). For disability\nstudies, recent analyses by the World Health Organization\nhave also confirmed that different subpopulations have\nsignificantly different attitudes toward reporting disabilities,\nincluding mobility disability (5,6).\nWe have recently reported the development of the index of\nmobility-related limitations (MOBLI) (7) for epidemiologic\nuse comparing the physical component of mobility disability\nacross populations or over time. In logistic regression models,\nthree measures were identified as being most strongly as-\nsociated with reported difficulty or inability in walking a\nmedium distance(aquarterofamile) inthethirdU.S.National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES III): gait\nspeed, time to complete five chair stands, and peak expiratory\nflow rate. We have since shown that the MOBLI is predictive\nof mortality over 4 years in the U.S. Established Populations\nfor the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly Study (8).\nJournal of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nMOBLI also had good sensitivity and specificity in the\nLongitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) and was\nresponsivetochangeovertwo 3-year periodsof follow-up(9).\nThe MOBLI is thus well suited as a measure of\n``mobility-related physical health'' for studying response\nshifts. In this analysis, we aimed to estimate the thresholds\non tested performance at which self-reports change from one\ncategory to another, across a range of sociodemographic\nsubgroups. We also aimed to compare reported and tested\nperformance across two national population studies.\nMETHODS\nStudy Sample\nThe NHANES III was a cross-sectional study of the U.S.\nComplex clustered samples of the civilian, noninstitution-\nover interviewed in their homes, a total of 5724 took the\nfurther examinations (5302 attended the mobile examination\ncenter, and 422 were examined in their own houses because\nthey were unable to attend the center). One hundred ninety-\nthree persons whose self-reported walking information was\nnot available were excluded, and the remaining 5531 were\nincluded in this analysis. Data sets used in this analysis were\nfrom the Public Use Data File (12).\nLASA includes a representative sample of The Nether-\nlands (13\u00ad15). In brief, it is a longitudinal study of predictors\nand consequences of changes in well-being and autonomy\nin the older population. Thus far, the LASA study has\nconducted three cycles of interviews and performance tests,\napproximately 3 years apart. From September 1992 to\nbaseline interview. To be comparable with the NHANES III\ndata set, respondents aged 60 or over, living in the\ncommunity, with measured and self-reported mobility\ninformation were included in the analysis. A total of 2115\nrespondents were eligible for this analysis.\nMeasurement of Variables\nMOBLI.--The MOBLI included measured average gait\nspeed, time to complete five chair stands, and peak\nexpiratory flow rate (6). The MOBLI is the calculated\noverall (whole NHANES III population) probability of\nreporting difficulty (or inability) in walking a quarter mile,\nbased on the logistic regression models including the three\nmeasures. The MOBLI score varies from 0 to 1: The higher\nthe score, the higher the probability of mobility-related\nlimitation and of reporting medium-distance walking\ndifficulty or inability. (Details of the MOBLI equations\nand calculation of scores are available online [16].)\nSelf-reported mobility disability.--In NHANES III, the\nquestion on difficulty in walking a quarter mile had four\nresponse categories: without, some, much, and unable to do.\nIn this analysis we dichotomized responses into (1) ``any\ndifficulty'' versus none or (2) ``inability'' versus ability.\nIn LASA pilot studies (17), questions on ``walking 400\nmeters'' and ``walking for 5 minutes'' were asked. Walking\nfor 5 minutes at a normal pace (5 km/h) is equivalent to\nwalking 400 meters or a quarter of a mile, and the questions\ngave similar results. Ultimately, the ``walking for 5 minutes''\nquestion was chosen for LASA, as conveying a clearer\nconcept to respondents.\nSociodemographic variables that separate subgroups.--\nSociodemographic variables in this analysis include sex,\nage, race, and income and educational level. Levels of\nincome were classified by the poverty income ratio (on the\nmidpoint of observed family income category as the\nnumerator and the poverty threshold, the age of the family\nreference person, and the calendar year in which the family\nwas interviewed as the denominator). Tertiles of the\nweighted whole poverty income ratio distribution were\ntion were based on the number of completed years of\neducation, coded as low (0\u00ad7 years), middle (8\u00ad11 years), or\nhigh (!12 years). Those not answering questions on\neducational or income level were coded as missing.\nStatistical Analysis\nLatent probit model.--Statistically, we assume there is\na latent variable representing an individual's relevant\nphysiologic status. With the use of this, we can estimate\nand compare difficulty or inability thresholds (cutpoints) on\nthis scale. In this analysis, the latent variable is measured\nusing the MOBLI index. To estimate the difficulty or inability\ncutpoints, we used the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed\nModels (GLLAMM) Program, developed by Rabe-Hesketh\nand colleagues for use in STATA (18,19). In our model, the\nbinary response yi\nof person i to the self-reported mobility\nquestion is modeled using a probit model with underlying\nresponse yi\n*. The latent variable can be described by the\nmeasured mobility level of person i. That is, we assume yi\n* ;\nN(li\n,1) and li\n\u00bcxi\nb, where xi\nis the MOBLI score and b is its\nassociated coefficient. The observed responses yi\ndifficulty or no inability; or 1: with difficulty or with inability)\nare generated assuming a threshold (response category\ncutpoint) model with person-specific thresholds (response\ncategory cutpoint) si\n. That is, yi\n* , si\nand yi\n*\n! si\n. The ith person-specific threshold (response category\ncutpoint) si\nis a linear combination of covariates (zi\n,\nindividual-level sociodemographic characteristics) and can\nbe expressed as si\n\u00bc zi\n9c, where c is the coefficient vector\nassociated with zi\nand is estimated by maximum likelihood,\nassuming responses are independent across individuals. In\nthis cutpoint model, the covariates include age, sex, race,\neducational level, income level, and national study.\nTo understand individual effects and the overall adjusted\neffect of each variable on people's threshold for reporting\ndisability, we built latent probit models for each variable\nseparately and then together. In each model, the first\nsubgroup of the variable was fixed as the baseline category\nand the estimated coefficient and standard errors for other\nsubgroups were calculated. The level of statistical signifi-\ncance was set at p , .01.\nIn the analyses based on each variable, the underlying\nmobility function measure was rescaled from 0 to 1, where\n0 corresponds to the lowest level of functional limitation (i.e.,\nno functional limitation) and 1 corresponds to the highest\nlevel of functional limitation. The estimated difficulty or\ninability cutpoints were also appropriately rescaled to lie\nbetween 0 and 1. The 95% confidence intervals for these\nrescaled cutpoints were also calculated.\nRESULTS\nComparisons of Cutpoints for Different Subgroups\nin the NHANES III Study\nIn the NHANES III sample (Table 1), the proportions of\nmale and female are nearly equal. Most of the sample were\n(34.4%) reported having difficulties in walking a quarter of\nto do it.\nTable 2 presents the coefficients and standard errors of the\nsubgroups in each variable in the latent probit model. Males\nand females do not have significantly different cutpoints in\nreporting difficulty or inability in walking. White people do\nhave different cutpoints from other groups for reporting\ninability but not difficulty. Subgroups by age, income level,\nand educational level have significant differences in\ncutpoints for both difficulty and inability. For age and\nincome level, there is a clear gradient for cutpoints, with\nyounger ages and higher income levels having higher\ncutpoints. The direction of the educational level effect is not\nclear for either difficulty or inability cutpoints.\nThe latent probit model coefficients of the subgroups in\neach variable (Table 2, Figure 1) show a clear gradient\nrelationship of cutpoints for subgroups of age and income\nlevel, although differences in difficulty cutpoints between\nmiddle- and high-income groups (p\u00bc.0369), and in inability\ncutpoints between low- and middle-income groups (p\u00bc.062)\nwere not statistically significant. Again, no obvious differ-\nences between difficulty or inability cutpoints can be seen by\nsex. For race, White Americans had relatively low inability\ncutpoints compared with others. By education, the subgroup\nof 12 years and over had significantly higher difficulty\ncutpoints only compared with the subgroup of 8\u00ad11 years\n(p , .001), which had significantly lower inability cut-\npoints than the other two subgroups.\nWe further put all covariates together in the models to\nsee the independent effect of each variable on the cut-\npoints (Table 3). Compared with the results in the single-\neffect models, age and income level remained important\nindependent predictors for both difficulty and inability\ncutpoints, and race was significant only for inability\ncutpoints. However, educational level was not statistically\nsignificant in the overall model.\nComparisonsof Cutpoints Between U.S. and DutchStudies\nThe NHANES and LASA age and sex structures (Table\n4) were similar. However, the study sample from The\nNetherlands had much less impairment of mobility function\nmeasured either by self-report or by physiologic tests (peak\nexpiratory flow, five chair stands, average walking speed,\nand MOBLI scores) compared with the U.S. sample.\nWith use of the latent probit models, the difficulty\nand inability cutpoints for each study were calculated\nand plotted in Figure 2. The LASA sample had relatively\nhigher cutpoints (all p , .001 in difficulty and inability) than\nthe U.S. sample; that is, the threshold for reporting difficulty\nor inability was at a more severe level of tested impairment.\nThese differences remained (all p , .001 in difficulty and\ninability) even if only the White participants (n\u00bc3,263 in the\nUnited States and 2,102 in The Netherlands) were included\nTable 1.

Thus, U.S. respondents were more likely to report\ndifficulty or inability in walking than the Dutch people, for\na given level of measured impairment.\nDISCUSSION\nQuestions to respondents on medium-distance mobility\ndisability generally require older people to report difficulties\nor inability, without defining when these terms should be\nTable 2.

These categorical responses can be seen as a subjective\nmapping onto an underlying ``latent'' measure of mobility-\nrelated physical health. In this analysis, we have shown that\nthere are important variations in thresholds (cutpoints) for\nreporting disability categories across different sociodemo-\ngraphic subgroups and studies. In the U.S. NHANES III\nstudy, against a validated measure of mobility-related\nimpairments or limitations (the MOBLI), groups defined by\nage and income level have significantly different thresholds\nfor reporting disability categories. In addition, comparing\nFigure 1. Diagram showing rescaled estimated mobility index cutpoints (with 95% confidence intervals) for the reporting of difficulty or inability, in different\nsubgroups (Y axis: index of mobility-related limitations [MOBLI] score; 1 \u00bc most severe measured impairments).\nself-reports in the U.S. study and the LASA sample from The\nNetherlands suggests that the very large differences in\nreported mobility disability are, in fact, substantially smaller\nwhen differences in thresholds for reporting disability are\naccounted for in this cross-study comparison.\nIn similar analyses of the NHANES III data set, Iburg and\ncolleagues (5) compared self- and physician reports with\na latent variable based on eight available physical tests,\nnamely, shoulder external rotation--right and left, hip and\nknee flexion--right and left, timed 8-ft walk, timed tandem\nstand, and five timed chair stands. The analysis assumed that\nthis latent variable represented an individual's true mobility\nlevel. That analysis similarly showed that thresholds for\nreporting difficulties occurred at more severe levels of tested\nimpairment in men compared with women, in non-White\nrespondents compared with White respondents, and in those\non higher incomes compared with those on lower incomes.\nTwo limitations of this earlier work have been addressed in\nour analyses: namely, the use of an unvalidated statistical\nlatent variable in contrast to our use of the MOBLI and the\nanalysis of age and educational level in addition to sex, race,\nand income level as grouping variables. A key difference\nbetween the Iburg latent variable and the MOBLI score is\nthat the latter included expiratory flow rate, which was\nTable 3.

Inability\nNote: SE \u00bc standard error.\n*Excluding missing data.\nempirically found to be more closely associated with\nmedium-distance mobility than the upper-extremity and\nbalance tests. In addition, Iburg and colleagues (5) did not\nexplore cross-study comparisons.\nNHANES Analyses\nA number of limitations in this analysis need to be\nconsidered in assessing the results. First, the NHANES III\nstudy included community-living older people only. One\ncommon hurdle in analyzing performance test data is\nmissing data, but here we have used the MOBLI, which\nincludes ``missing'' as a category in score calculation. In\naddition, ``missing'' categories were included for grouping\nvariables. The use of the latent probit model, although less\nfamiliar, is conceptually very similar to logistic regression\nmodels: In logistic regression, group differences are\nmeasured by relative odds, whereas in probit models,\nthresholds are reported. The traditional probit model is\nwidely used in calculation of doses required to achieve\ntarget effects (20,21). The use of this statistical technique\nshould therefore not be problematic.\nOur analyses also have a number of strengths. The\nNHANES III study is a high-quality national study with\na relatively large sample of older people, combining self-\nreport and tested performance relevant to medium-distance\nmobility. Our use of the MOBLI score as a continuous\nmeasure of the physical component of mobility disability\nprovides a strong foundation for the analysis, given the\nconstruct validity of the MOBLI, plus the evidence for its\ngood test characteristics, predictive validity, and sensitivity\nto change.\nThe results of the analysis of NHANES III are clear-cut:\nThresholds for reporting disability categories vary by age\nand income level when compared with tested performance\nin models adjusted for the other studied factors. Thus,\nyounger elderly individuals on average report difficulties or\ninabilities only when they reach a more severe level of\ntested impairment compared with older old individuals. A\nsimilar pattern exists for higher income level. At the same\ntime, significant differences were not present between\ngroups defined by sex or for the main categories of\neducational level. For race, differences in threshold were\npresent only for reporting ``inability'' but not difficulty.\nThis analysis is also relevant to understanding causes of\ndisability. For sex, it is well documented that women have\nboth higher disability prevalence and incidence rates than\nmeasured mobility function (25). Our results have shown\nthat after adjusting for measured mobility function (the\n``physiologic'' component of mobility disability), women\nand men report disability with the same thresholds. The sex\ndifference in disability rate appears, therefore, to reflect\nphysiologic differences. The lack of significant threshold\ndifferences by educational level similarly suggests that the\nTable 4.

With\nadvancing age, self-reported disability and measured func-\ntional limitations both become more common. In our analysis,\nthe younger old subjects were shown to be relatively less\nlikely to report mobility disabilities than the older old subjects\nwith similar measured physical health status. Possible\nexplanations for this finding include differences in attitudes\ntoward reporting or differences in environment. How pre-\ncisely attitudes toward disability reporting are formed in\ndifferent age groups and cohorts needs to be further explored.\nEvidence from some studies has shown that older people\nwith higher income level have both better self-reported\nreporting of disability across income groups evident in our\nanalysis may perhaps arise from real differences in the help\nand facilities available to older people with higher incomes,\nor it may reflect only differences in attitudes. Again, further\nresearch is needed.\nIt is interesting that White Americans are more likely than\nnon-Whites to report inability. However, results from\nprevious studies about racial differences in self-reported\ndisability are inconsistent (29,30). The possible directions of\nracial differences are still unclear, especially if socioeco-\nnomic status differences are accounted for in analyses (31).\nCross-Study Comparison\nComparing studies of older people is seldom easy, as\ndetailed differences in design and instruments abound.\nAlthough the measures used in both the LASA and the\nNHANES III studies are very similar, there are some\ndifferences that could make comparison across these two\nstudies difficult to interpret. First, the comparable question on\nwalking a quarter of a mile in LASA related to ``walking for\nfive minutes,'' which was designed to cover roughly the same\nmedium-distance walk but was found to convey a clearer\nconcept to Dutch respondents. Reported prevalence rates in\nthe LASA study for mobility disability were far lower than\nthose in the U.S. study, and these differences could be\ndismissed as uninterpretable because of the differences in the\ndisability question asked. However, recent evidence from\nanother cross-country study, when all questions were\nstandardized, also suggests that Dutch people have a lower\nprevalence of self-reported disability than do people in other\nBy using the MOBLI score in both studies, we can assess\nwhether part of this difference in reported disability is due to\ndifferences in reporting, and we can also assess how much\nof the difference in mobility-related performance remains to\nbe explained. Our analyses show that the thresholds for\nreporting difficulty and inability in the LASA study were\nindeed substantially different from those in the U.S. study,\nwith Dutch respondents reporting disability only at more\nsevere levels of tested performance. Nevertheless, differ-\nences in MOBLI score and in performance on the individual\ntests are also present.\nClearly, much more work has to be done to understand\nwhy differences in reporting of disability exist between some\ngroups but not others in comparison with measured physical\nperformance. Important differences in, for example, home\nand outside environment may play important roles and need\nfurther exploration. In any event, the analyses presented\nsupport the case for the use of relevant and validated test-\nbased measures in epidemiologic studies of the causes of the\nphysical health component of disability.\nFigure 2. Diagram showing rescaled estimated mobility index cutpoints (with 95% confidence intervals) for the reporting of difficulty or inability, in the United\nStates and The Netherlands (Y axis: index of mobility-related limitations [MOBLI] score; 1 \u00bc most severe measured impairment).\nConclusion\nTraditional disability questions require older people to\nreport difficulties with everyday activities including mobil-\nity, using broad and largely undefined categories. The core\ncomponent of disability is physiologic. When it is measured\nby a valid continuous measure of mobility-related physical\nimpairment or limitation and is compared with disability,\nthere is evidence of differences in thresholds for reporting\nmobility disability across age and income groups in\nolder Americans. Furthermore, comparisons between the\nNHANES III and LASA studies suggest that both reporting\nthresholds and measured impairment or limitation contribute\nto reported differences in medium-distance mobility dis-\nability. Further work is needed to understand the causes of\nattitude or environmental factors that may contribute to\nthese reporting differences.\n"
