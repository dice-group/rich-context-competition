With the advancement of technology, patients may\nface a complex decision-making process about whether to preserve fertility. The purpose of this article is to explore how\nyoung women with cancer perceive patient\u00adprovider communication in FP decision making. In this study, 25 women between\nthe ages of 18 and 39 were interviewed retrospectively. They were interviewed one time to learn about their decision-\nmaking process related to FP. Results of this analysis indicate that patients seek support and involvement from providers\nthroughout the process of decision making. They prefer providers to be directive when referring to the fertility clinic. Later\nin the process, they expect a supportive style of communication from providers. Patient-accessible language, supportive and\nreassuring styles of communication, and an existing relationship with providers may enhance well-being of the patients.\n",

Thus, there are large numbers of cancer patients who\nare of or approaching childbearing age. Every year in Canada\nand the United States, about 26,000 adolescents and young\nadults (AYA) between ages 15 and 29 years are diagnosed\nwith cancer (Tonorezos & Oeffinger, 2011). Although the\nmajority of AYA cancer patients will survive their primary\ncancer, many will develop other serious health problems\n(Tonorezos & Oeffinger, 2011). Young adults with cancer in\none study indicated infertility problems to be a significant\nhealth issue leading to poor psychosocial outcomes (Schwartz\nFertility preservation (FP) is one of the answers to this\nproblem apart from adopting or opting to remain childless\n(Schover, Rybicki, Martin, & Bringelsen, (1999). FPincludes\nmethods and efforts to maintain the ability of a person to\nreproduce even after natural or other illness-related fertility\nloss (Coyne, Kader, & Agarwal, 2010). Modern technologi-\ncal advancements have made FP a feasible option for cancer\npatients to have biological children in the future. To advance\nFP technology as a viable option for young cancer patients,\nthe American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2006\npublished guidelines for oncologists to address FP while pro-\nviding treatment and counseling for cancer patients (Lee\net al., 2006). These guidelines recommend discussing infer-\ntility as a side effect of cancer treatment and providing FP as\nan option. Providers are advised to apply their clinical judg-\nment and discuss the possibility of fertility damage or loss at\nthe earliest possible opportunity (Lee et al., 2006).\nStudies indicate that communication between patients and\nhealth care professionals has a profound effect on patients'\noutcomes and behavior (Stewart, 1995). Effective communi-\ncation reduces patients' suffering and anxiety during treat-\nment (Fellowes, Wilkinson, & Moore, 2004). Patients seek a\ntrusting relationship balancing the provider's role as an\nexpert and as a partner in decision making (Epstein, 2006).\nPatient\u00adprovider communication is crucial in providing FP\nservices to patients.\n1Portland State University, OR, USA\n2Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAakrati Mathur, Portland State University Graduate School of Social\nEmail: mathuraakrati@gmail.com\nPatients' Perception of Patient\u00adProvider\nCommunication in Fertility Preservation\nDecision Making Among Young Women\nWith Cancer: A Qualitative Study\nAakrati Mathur1, E. Robert Orellana1, Amy Frohnmayer2, Pauline Jivanjee1,\nLillian Nail2, Brandon Hayes-Lattin2, and Rebecca G. Block2\n Keywords\nfertility preservation, patient\u00adprovider communication, fertility decision making\n2 SAGE Open\nPatient\u00adProvider Communication\nThere are a number of challenges in discussing FP with\nyoung cancer patients. Barriers identified in FP are (a) physi-\ncian factors that contribute to communication issues with FP\ndiscussion (e.g., awareness and sense of comfort in discuss-\ning issues, perceptions of the treatment-related priority),\n(b) parental factors (e.g., receptiveness and cultural back-\nground of the patients' parents), (c) patient factors (e.g.,\nreceptiveness and age), and (d) institutional factors like\nreferral sites and practice guidelines (Vadaparampil, Quinn,\nKing, Wilson, & Nieder, 2008). Oncologists and other cancer\ncare professionals face challenges in discussing FP and help-\ning patients in FP decision making. Cancer remains a highly\ndelicate subject, and discussing it with young adults may\nincorporate added challenges like lack of awareness about\nspecific psychosocial complications of this age group\n(Quinn, Vadaparampil, Bell-Ellison, Gwede, & Albrecht,\n2008). Discussing fertility options with patients is difficult\nfor health care professionals unless they work in reproduc-\ntive health (Schover, Rybicki, Martin, & Bringelsen, 1999).\nOncologists and other physicians may focus on treating\nmalignancy and survivorship rather than discussing FP\n(Patrizio, Butts, & Caplan, 2005). Physicians may also have\nserious concerns about potential delays in cancer treatment\nnecessary for FP procedures (Vadaparampil, Quinn, King,\nMost of the past research on FP communication is from\nthe provider's perspective (Vadaparampil, Quinn, Lancaster,\net al., 2008). Previous studies have highlighted the impor-\ntance of patient\u00adprovider communication in patients with\ncancer; however, young patient's informational needs are\nstill not adequately met (Quinn & Vadaparampil, 2009;\nZebrack, 2008). In this qualitative study, we further explore\nthe communication needs of the patients at various stages of\ntreatment.\nThe purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of\nthe communication process that occurs between young adult\nwomen with cancer and health care professionals (including\nnurses, oncologists, social workers, and other clinic staff)\nduring the time women are making decisions about FP. In\nparticular, this analysis documents patients' viewpoints on\nthree sets of interactions with health care professionals, and\nidentifies factors that lead to positive or negative experiences\namong patients. These interactions are (a) first discussion of\nfertility compromise and fertility issues, (b) first appoint-\nment at the fertility clinic, and (c) subsequent discussion\nabout fertility with health care professionals.\nMethod\nStudy Design\nAs part of a larger research study (Block, Frohnmayer,\nJivanjee, & Brandon Hayes-Lattin, 2012) designed to gain\nunderstanding of the FP decision-making processes of young\nadults, a focused qualitative analysis was completed to\nexplore and describe women's experiences of interactions\nwith health care professionals. This study represents a sec-\nondary analysis of the data collected for the primary study.\nWhile the data collection for the larger study is described\nbelow, the data analysis process and the results presented\nhere are specific to FP communication. Secondary data anal-\nysis of existing data was approved by the medical institute\nIRB in which data were collected.Approval also ensured that\nthe objectives of the secondary analysis corresponded with\nthe objectives of the original study for which participant con-\nsents were obtained.\nSample and Setting\nParticipants.Qualitative interviews were conducted with\n25 participants recruited at the oncology center of a large\nteaching hospital. Although eligibility criteria for study par-\nticipants included being a woman between ages 15 and 39 at\nthe time of interview and aware of potential fertility compro-\nmise due to cancer treatment, the actual sample had patients\nin 18 to 38 age range. These interviews were done retrospec-\ntively with the patients. Data are generated from only one\ninterview with the patients. Patients were paid US$30 and\nthe interviews were 60-min long. Twenty-three participants\nwere Caucasian, 1 was Hispanic, and 1 was African Ameri-\ncan. Diagnoses included the following: leukemia, Hodgkin's\nlymphoma, breast cancer, sarcoma, colorectal cancer, adre-\nnal cortical carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and multiple\nmyeloma. Five participants (19%) had children prior to their\ninitial cancer diagnosis and 1 had a baby between first treat-\nment and relapse. Eighteen (69%) participants opted for a\nconsultation appointment with reproductive endocrinologist\nand 10 (39%) of those women pursued or planned to pursue\nFP. Eight women opted out of the consultation.\nSetting. The research setting was an academic medical insti-\ntution in the northwest of the United States. This institution\nhas an adolescent and young adult oncology program\ndesigned to provide consultation services and research\nopportunities for patients with cancer between 15 and\n39 years old. This program has done extensive outreach and\neducation within the hospital and clinics.\nA typical clinical flow of FP treatment includes multiple\ninteractions with health care professionals that can be\ngrouped into three sets. The first set is when a patient learns\nabout her fertility compromise and available options to pro-\ntect her fertility. This communication may be with an oncolo-\ngist, nurse, or any provider who first discussed fertility\ncompromise with the patient. The second set is when a\npatient has a scheduled consultation with a fertility special-\nist. This set includes communication with fertility special-\nists, who may be nurses and doctors at the fertility clinic. The\nthird set of interaction is after the first appointment at the\nfertility clinic when the patient may consult with various\nMathur et al. 3\nhealth care professionals while engaged in the decision-\nmaking process. This includes communication with the pri-\nmary health care providers, nurses, gynecologists, or other\nproviders with whom patients initiated conversations for\nadvice on fertility. Considering the clinical flow of FP treat-\nment, this article examines patient\u00adprovider communication\ngrouped into these three sets of interaction.\nData Collection\nIn-person interviews with participants were done in a private\nsetting. Interviews included questions on the patients' expe-\nriences of first finding out about the potential compromise to\ntheir fertility and the subsequent consultation experiences\nwith their oncologists and fertility specialists. Examples of\nthe questions include,\nTell me the story of your diagnosis and finding out that your\ncancer treatment might affect your ability to have children. How\ndid you find out about fertility consultation services for people\nwith cancer? What was helpful about the consultation? What\nwas not helpful?\nInterviews were conducted after at least the first set of\ncommunication when patients were informed about fertility\ncompromise. Some patients opted to move on to the first fer-\ntility consultation and discussed the second and third sets of\nFP communication during the interview.\nThe interview schedule contained questions beyond the\nscope of this project and only data related to patient\u00adprovider\ncommunication were included in this analysis. All the inter-\nviews were recorded, transcribed, and uploaded in the NVIVO\nsoftware package to support qualitative data analysis.\nData Analysis\nStraus and Corbin's (1990) open-coding method of data\nanalysis was used to identify themes. Because the researcher\nwas involved in thematic analysis of data for the larger study,\nshe had already reviewed the data prior to this analysis. New\ncodes were created in NVIVO relevant to this analysis and\nsections of the interviews beyond the scope of this project\nwere disregarded. After reviewing and open-coding eight\ninterviews, the researcher developed a codebook to identify\nbasic themes and their relationships to one another. This\ncodebook was not a set of rigid codes but a fluid document\nresponsive to new codes and relationships that emerged dur-\ning later coding of the interviews. Once all codes were iden-\ntified, all of the interviews were revisited and recoded. The\ninductive method of data analysis was used. Themes and\nsubthemes emerged from the data through reading and re-\nreading multiple times. While analyzing the themes, the\nnumber of cases represented within each theme was noted.\nWherever possible, participants' own words were used to\nlabel styles to stay close to the original transcripts or they\nwere labeled based on a communication literature review and\npeer debriefing with other members of the research team.\nData analysis was guided by the specific objective of\nidentifying any text related to major aspects of provider\u00ad\npatient communication and what meaning patients assigned\nto the communication. The communication style was named\naccording to what best described the style, and at times was\nlabeled using the words of patients. Patient's state of mind\nwas examined as it is believed to affect her satisfaction with\nthe providers' communication style (Ben-Sira, 1980). Any\ncommunication relevant to the patient describing her mental\nstate was categorized as state of mind.\nResults\nBased on the clinical flow of FP treatment, responses were\nclassified into three sets of communication with the\nprovider.\n1. First was the discussion of cancer treatment's effects\non fertility and FP. In this set of communications,\npatients reported their experience of finding out\nabout the possibility of fertility compromise due to\ncancer treatment. Communication centered on the\nrisks associated with cancer treatments and also the\nvarious fertility options available to the patient.\nMajor themes that evolved during this stage were the\npatient's state of mind, providers' characteristics\n(gender, occupation), and communication styles.\nSimilar themes were then explored in the next two\nsets of communication. Patients discussed their pro-\nviders' communication style along with the provid-\ners' characteristics; hence providers' gender and\nprofession were noted in the transcripts.\n2. Second was the initial appointment at the fertility\nclinic. This included patients talking about their ini-\ntial appointments after referral from another provider.\nMajor themes identified in this stage were patient's\nstate of mind, provider's communication style, and\ninformation (clarity and adequacy) provided to the\npatients. Because this study was done in one clinic,\ncharacteristics of the fertility consultants were not\nnoteworthy as most patients were attended by same\nconsultants. Patients focused more on the informa-\ntion provided to them.\n3. Third was a subsequent discussion about FP options.\nDuring the subsequent discussions about FP with a\nprovider stage, patients discussed their conversation\nwith providers after the initial appointments to reach a\ndecision about FP. Major themes that emerged were\npatient's state of mind, provider's characteristics, pro-\nvider's communication style, and relationship with\nprovider.As at this stage patients went back to the pro-\nviders with whom they were comfortable, a new theme\nof previous relationship with providers emerged.\n4 SAGE Open\nFirst Discussions of Fertility\nCompromise and Preservation\nThe major themes were the patient's state of mind and the\ncommunication style of the provider. The gender and profes-\nsion of the provider were extracted from the transcripts as\nmentioned by the patients during the interview.\nProvider's Communication Styles\nThe three provider communication styles identified were\ndirective, indifferent, and supportive.\nDirective.Style was categorized as directive if providers\noffered direction on next steps and the directions were fol-\nlowed. A directive style was noted when health care profes-\nsionals provided a clear line of action with some assertiveness\nto comply. Some patients (n = 5) felt their providers had a\ndirective approach. For example,\nShe was sort of the guiding force, like these are the things that\nwe would recommend. I can make the appointments for you and\nyou can just kind of coast along and just attend them. You drive\nthe bus and I'll just sit in the back is kind of how it went.\nSupportive. Supportive style meant when patients were pro-\nactively provided information and emotional help.\nOnly two patients felt the professional's style was sup-\nportive. These patients appreciated provider's initiative in\nproviding FP information and were interested in their overall\nwell-being. For example, one of the patients said,\nShe even specifically told me, I'm going to tell you about this\nbecause you are probably not going to have a lot of doctors\nthat this is a concern for them. I want you to know before you\ngo through anything, because you are a young adult and this\nkind of stuff. She just said, you at least need to know that this\nis something you could potentially have to deal with in the\nfuture.\nYour situation, you decide/indifferent. However, some patients\n(n = 4) felt that the professionals' style was indifferent. Here\nthe provider presented the facts to the patient and left it up to\nher to decide without offering details or showing interest in\nthe patient as an individual. For example, \"I'm not the person\ngoing through this situation, so decide what you need to\ndecide,\" basically. He is like, \"it is a low risk but I don't want\nto say that and have something happen.\"\nPatient's State of Mind During the First FP\nDiscussion\nA reflection reported by some patients (n = 5) was that fertil-\nity news came embedded with other information and in itself\nwas not the top priority, \"I was just so overwhelmed with\neverything else.At that point it wasn't a real concern. I hadn't\nthought about it a lot. I was mainly focused on getting\nthrough the whole [treatment].\"\nHowever, others (n = 4) mentioned their disappointment\nand feelings of sadness upon hearing the news of fertility\ncompromise. One of the patients said, \"When they told me I\ncouldn't have any more kids, I kind of felt like, of course,\nkind of crappy. Well, it was kind of taken away, if I did want\nthat option.\"\nWhile describing their feelings, participants also recalled\ntheir thoughts about having kids. For a few patients, this was\nthe first time they seriously thought about having children as\nthey were young:\nI'm not sure that I knew how to feel about it at the time, because\nwe weren't sure at the time whether we wanted to have children\nor not. It felt like we were kind of having to make a split-second\ndecision on something that we had thought we had a number of\nyears to figure out.\nProvider's Characteristics\nThe first person to inform participants about fertility com-\npromise varied in gender and professional role. Patients'\nexperience of first learning about FP was from a nurse, social\nworker, or oncologist. Most often this information was pro-\nvided by the treating oncologist (n = 8). A few patients also\nfound out from their nurse (n = 3) and others from a social\nworker, surgeon, or a doctor other than the treating oncolo-\ngist. For example, one woman was told about FP by another\ndoctor rounding on her floor the first night she was in the\nhospital.\nIn this sample, female health care professionals (n = 11)\nand male providers (n = 10) discussed fertility issues with\npatients. The gender of the health care professional who\ninformed the remaining four participants is unknown.\nFirst Appointment at the Fertility\nClinic\nAt this stage of the clinical workflow, in addition to patient's\nstate of mind and provider's style, themes around the infor-\nmation provided to patients were identified. It is at this stage\nthat patients were provided their first consultation with a fer-\ntility expert and received FP information. Participants dis-\ncussed their views on the adequacy and clarity of information\nprovided to them.\nProvider's Communication Style\nThree major styles identified were directive, supportive, and\nindifferent (see Table 1).\nDirective.Patients mostly talked about the conversations\nwith their fertility specialist. Some patients found the pro-\nvider's style directive (n = 7), when they assertively\nMathur et al. 5\nrecommended the FP option that the patients should opt for.\nAs one of the patients expressed, \"As much as he went over\nall this stuff, he gave us these options and basically said you\nprobably want to do one of these two and I would recom-\nmend this one.\"\nSupportive.Only two patients found their providers' style\nsupportive and comforting. One participant liked this style\nbecause the provider took a holistic approach, considering\nthe life situation of the patient and her interests. The patient\nsaid,\nThe consultation was just really reassuring. It was kind of\nawkward because it was with my dad and it is a place where\npeople go to have babies and stuff . . . I don't think anything\nwrong happened from it at all, because it (a) gave me an option\nand (b) he gave me really good advice that my oncologist agreed\nwith, with the birth control.\nYour situation, you decide/indifferent. Some of the patients\n(n = 4) felt that providers were not as involved as they\nwanted them to be. Hence, they perceived the providers to\nbe very impersonal:\nAll of those thing(s) is a lot (information provided at the first\nappointment with FP specialist). Then, again, that is their job. I\njust kind of felt like they . . . for something like that I would want\nto be able to build a relationship with a doctor and come up with\nsome personalized plans. I didn't necessarily have that feeling\nfrom the first visit.\nPatient's State of Mind\nPatients talked about how they felt before and during their\nfirst appointment at the clinic. As some patients were in the\nprocess of cancer treatment, they felt confused and disori-\nented. As one of them said, \"I have such bad memory. You\nhave given me the chemo.\"\nOne of the patients felt that along with chemotherapy and\nradiation, going for another appointment for fertility consul-\ntation was a lot.\nMostly patients thought about their current life status and\nhow appropriate fertility options were for them:\nI went in there. It was definitely overwhelming, like listening to\nit, because at that point in time I was just like, I don't want kids.\nI had to make the decision if I wanted to have that chance within\na couple of hours. I was like . . .\nFor other patients, having information about FP was\nimportant to make the right decision. FP was like an insur-\nance policy for the patients, if their situation improved in\nfuture. As one woman said,\nSo I guess I kind of knew that there is a potential that maybe\nthere is nothing they can do for me, I guess. But I guess I just\nkind of always felt that things are in the works, and, again, I\ndon't want that opportunity to pass at that point.\nInformation\nSome participants felt the information was too much and at\ntimes overwhelming. Patients felt too many choices and lack\nof a definite line of treatment left them scared or stressed.\n[My doctor] is like, this is relatively a new thing and I'm just\nlike, I don't know if I want to try it. I don't really want to be a\nguinea pig. So, yeah, we did have the information and way too\nmuch more, or maybe we didn't actually get any of it. It didn't\nsink in. It was so out there and we were just like, we just sat in\nthis room for an hour, and oh, my gosh.\nSome patients expected the conversation about the cost of\nFP to be more explicit as pricing was one of the major decid-\ning factors for them.\nThere was sort of this vagueness about pricing and how much it\nwas going to be. I always felt like I had to inquire, well, how much\nis that procedure going to be and how much is this bit and what is\nit going to look like all together. That was sort of this gray area.\nShe kept saying, oh, you have to ask at the desk. That is a huge\npart of my decision making, how much is this going to cost me.\nAlthough most of the patients felt they got sufficient\ninformation at their appointment in the fertility clinic, a few\nsuggested that pamphlet information with pricing was their\nbest guiding tool in decision making.\nI don't know if I learned it from [my doctor/the fertility\nspecialist]. I think just reading stuff, because they were almost\nlike do the research things, like . . . like mice or rats or whatever.\nI don't want to do that stuff. It was mostly reading the pamphlets\nand stuff like that.\nThe content of information for the most part was compre-\nhensible; a few patients felt they were provided with unnec-\nessary information on current research and it was difficult to\nTable 1.

Due to the research-oriented language in the\ninformation provided, participants could not appreciate vari-\nous FP options available to them.\nWhen I listened to the doctor talk about all the studies and\nthings, I don't know if I would have chosen a different option\nbecause I really didn't understand the different options. But I\nwould have appreciated the time to step back and go, okay, this\nis this. I can do this and this will happen.\nSubsequent Discussions\nThese results refer to the time beyond the first appointment\nat the fertility clinic after patients were given information\nabout FP. Patients discussed their feelings about the fertility\nclinic and experiences with the providers who helped them\nthink through their decision. Patients' recollections beyond\ntheir appointments with fertility specialists are captured in\nthis section. It is an important phase where patients' are\nthinking through the decision and have described how dis-\ncussions with various providers helped them through the\nprocess. Patient's relationship with the professional was an\nemergent theme at this stage of the clinical workflow.\nPatients discussed their existing rapport with the provider to\nwhom they returned for subsequent discussions. Two other\nthemes were provider's style and patient's state of mind.\nProvider's style\nDirective.Some patients (n = 8) described the provider's\nstyle as directive in this phase. Most of the patients who\nreported the style as directive said that they were told to\nadopt a particular method of FP. As one patient said,\nHe said you definitely don't want to wait until you go through\nyour first round of chemo because the chance of damaging your\ntissues or different things likes that or just the possibility of there\nbeing more of an issue with fertility later on. He goes it is best to\ngo in and actually preserve that ovary now before you even start\nyour first round of chemo.\nSupportive.About a quarter of participants (n = 6) reported\nthat their providers were supportive with their decision-mak-\ning process. Patients approached their fertility specialist, pri-\nmary care physician, social worker, or nurse depending on\nwith whom they had a rapport and what conversations they\nremembered. Most patients talked about the providers who\ndiscussed their problems with them versus those who just\nprovided them information. As one patient mentioned,\nShe was just so positive and just, like I said, gave me enough\nclinical information and statistics but didn't overwhelm me with\nit. She sat down with a diagram. She wrote out what my\ntreatment plan was going to look like, really took time with me.\nNot that this other surgeon has not done that, but he just doesn't\nhave the same, it is just not the same approach.\nTwo patients described instances when the provider was\nbeing supportive and reassuring. One of them described her\nhealth care professional as a mentor. For example, \"I defi-\nnitely was a decision maker. I knew what I wanted to do and\nhow to do it. But I always, at the same time, I always looked\nat them as being a mentor. They have been through this.\"\nYour situation, you decide/indifferent.A quarter of the patients\n(n = 6) reported providers as being indifferent and not relat-\ning to their problem. As one of the patients said,\nYeah, and I think he might be a little surprised by my having not\ndecided yet. I said to him, when I saw him a few weeks ago, he\nwas like, oh, have you decided. I said, you know, I really haven't\ndecided. He kind of joked and said, well, you can decide up until\nyou're in the prep, right before your anesthesia. You can decide\n. . . And that made me feel a little abandoned by him, as far as\nlike, this is your decision, just let me know and I'll do whatever\nyou want me to do. I don't know, it feels like of lonely.\nA couple of patients felt that they were being pushed from\nprovider to provider with no one taking the responsibility or\nhelping them make a decision.\nPatient's State of Mind Before Subsequent\nDiscussions With Providers\nAfter their first appointment some patients felt stressed,\noverwhelmed, and scared about the procedure. One of them\nsaid, \"I remember just being really scared and paranoid and\njust really thinking what am I getting myself into, like if this\nisn't going to work, then is it really worth it.\"\nAnother patient said, \"It is too much. It is too much. It is\ntoo much information. It is too much emotionally and it is\nhard to remember why I decided certain things.\"\nHowever, a few others felt confident and satisfied with the\ndecision they made. Patients also described their difficult\nsituation about choosing between starting cancer treatment\nright away and waiting to complete FP treatment before\nbeginning their cancer treatment.\nProvider Characteristics and Their Relationship\nWith the Providers\nAll the participants who talked about subsequent discussions\n(n = 7) with health care professionals approached a female\nprovider, of whom three were nurses, two social workers,\nand two doctors.\nSome participants explicitly expressed their comfort with\nfemale providers as they understood them better:\nI have my oncologist who is a female--I say that only because I\ndo think that that kind of weighs into their ability to relate to this\ndecision. We have been talking a lot over the course of the last\nseveral months. I'm still undecided as to what to do.\nMathur et al. 7\nTwo participants discussed their relationship and comfort\nwith providers. Both indicated that an existing relationship\nmade them feel comfortable talking to the provider.\nWith my primary care . . . now I would have called my gyno\n[gynecologist] because I know her really well and I have a really\ngood relationship with her now. I would ask her what she would\ndo. When you go from no medical history, I didn't have anybody\nthat I could trust that was a professional. Now I have my\npsychologist, my primary care, two oncologists, my naturopath.\nI have people that I always know that I can go to.\nDiscussion\nThis study reveals new insights into patient\u00adprovider com-\nmunication during fertility decision-making processes.\nOverall it provides patients' perspectives on communication\nwith providers while making a FP decision.\nProvider's Style of Communication\nComparing all three sets of communications, the directive\nstyle was preferred by patients during the first discussion\nwhere providers emphasized the importance of a first consul-\ntation. The least preferred style was that of indifference.\nHowever, during the first fertility consultation, patients liked\na supportive style where their current life situation was\nincluded in the discussion along with information on FP pro-\ncedures. It is important to discuss patient's current life situa-\ntion including relationship status and to provide advice\nregarding procedures for exclusive egg preservation or\nzygote preservation. Supportive style was preferred again\nduring subsequent discussions as patients liked longer dis-\ncussions to reach a decision on FP. Results indicated that\nsome patients perceived directive styles as positive. A num-\nber of previous studies of adults report that cancer patients\nvary substantially in their preference for participation in\ndecision making (Blanchard, Labrecque, Ruckdeschel, &\nTattersall, Dunn, & MacLeod, 1999). In fact, in one study,\nthe physician's recommendation was a strong predictor of\nwhether a patient opted for FP (Schover, Brey, Lichtin,\nLipshultz, & Jeha, 2002). Although these studies are not spe-\ncifically done with AYA populations, similar results emerged\nin the current article where participants demonstrated appre-\nciation for the directive style of the professionals. One plau-\nsible explanation for favoring directive styles may be the\nneed for clear directions from health care providers when\npatients felt overwhelmed with information. A recent study\non pretreatment counseling for FP showed higher satisfac-\ntion among patients counseled by both oncologists and fertil-\nity specialists rather than by only oncologists (Letourneau et\nal., 2010). This study highlights preference for directive\nstyle, especially when it meant insisting on fertility clinic\nconsultations, as it may lead to counseling sessions with both\noncologists and fertility specialists and more informed basis\nof decision making.\nIndifference on the part of providers while communicat-\ning was mostly unacceptable. Patients expressed discomfort\nwhen providers ended conversations by detaching them-\nselves from patients and leaving the entire ownership of the\ndecision to them. A study of women with breast cancer\nshowed that patients have emotional needs and seek reassur-\nance from their health care professionals (Bakker, Fitch,\nGray, Reed, & Bennett, 2000). Affective communication\nshowing understanding of a patient's life situation and build-\ning trust are important for patient satisfaction (Bakker et al.,\n2000). Hence, an indifferent, detached communication style\nis the least preferred style.\nAt first appointment in the clinic, patients expressed their\nstress and fear about the procedure. Anxiety before a medical\nprocedure is common among patients (Kindler, Szirt,\nSommer, H\u00e4usler, & Langewitz, 2005). A study of preopera-\ntive patient\u00adprovider communication suggests that having\npatient-centered conversations where focus is on psychoso-\ncial issues with discussions surrounding emotions before\noperations helps reduce anxiety among patients (Kindler et\nal., 2004). Although hospitals and clinics are resource and\ntime-constrained, results indicate that there is a need for fer-\ntility counseling services to provide information about the\nprocedures.\nInformation. There is no one consistent source of FP informa-\ntion for the patients. Patients heard about this service through\ndifferent providers (nurses, oncologists, and others).\nFeeling overwhelmed with information may imply that\npatients felt inundated with too much information along with\nthe cancer diagnosis and treatment discussion. Feelings of\nsadness may emerge from the feeling of loss of an important\norgan function. Providers while communicating to the\npatients about possible fertility loss should be responsive to\na patient's individual state of mind to ease them through the\nprocess of decision making about FP. Information on the\npamphlet provided was useful for the patients.\nMost of the patients liked when providers gave them a list\nof options but strongly recommended the one they thought\nbest suited to them. Hence, they found a directive style to be\nuseful at this stage. Along with clear recommendation of the\nFP method to be used, discussions with the provider around\nthe patient's life stage and situation helped patients make\ntheir choices. This analysis suggests that patients were more\nsatisfied when provider\u00adpatient communication went beyond\nmedical facts, and related to the patient's current life\nsituation.\nPatient's State of Mind\nThrough the stages of communication, the patient's state of\nmind changed depending on the information she received. In\nthe reflection of the first discussion about fertility, patients\n8 SAGE Open\nfocused on their reaction to the news of fertility compromise,\nincluding feeling overwhelmed with information and disap-\npointment. Some patients reported how first consultation\nwith a fertility specialist helped them start thinking about\nhaving children in the future. In the subsequent discussions\nset, patients started considering the possible options dis-\ncussed in the fertility consultation and felt stressed about the\nprocedure itself. Others felt relieved after making a decision\nabout FP. Some of the patients in this study were either in the\nprocess of cancer treatment or treated for a relapse at the time\nof the study. Results indicate that within the context of many\nother life-changing decisions, FP was one more important\ndecision to be made. Although for patients the outcome of\ntheir chemotherapy could not be accurately predicted, they\nwent for their fertility appointment with the mind-set that\nhaving information was important and FP may be helpful in\nfuture.\nProviders' Characteristics\nPatients encountered various providers through their FP\ndecision-making process. There was no consistency observed\nacross the three sets of communication as to who provided\ninformation initially about fertility and to whom patients\nwent back for subsequent discussions. Throughout the three\nsets of communication, these data reflect a lack of one point\nperson to whom patients returned after consultation with\nother providers.\nThe participants in the present study offer important\ninsights into their preferences for communication styles and\nservices from providers. This insight could assist in the\ndevelopment of strategies for communication in this field,\nincluding tailoring communication styles to meet the needs\nof young adult patients. Patients reported feeling most com-\nfortable with female health care professionals in discussing\nFP and they preferred to return to them for further consulta-\ntion. As gender comparison was not the focus of this analy-\nsis, this study cannot endorse a preference for female\nproviders. But the fact that patients found it meaningful\nenough to discuss in the interview reflects for this sample of\npatients that female providers do approach fertility discus-\nsion with appreciated sensitivity. Previous relationships with\nhealth care professionals helped patients think through their\ndecisions. It is difficult for patients to establish a relationship\nwith oncologists or surgeons in the short period between\ndiagnosis and treatment. One study shows that as primary\ncare provider, the gynecologist may interact with patients\nthroughout the cancer care continuum, and this puts gyne-\ncologists in a unique position to join the onco-fertility team\nin providing young cancer patients with needed support\n(Duncan, Jozefik, Kim, Hirshfeld-Cytron, & Woodruff,\n2011). For patients who have an ongoing relationship with\ntheir gynecologist, it may be useful to involve them in FP\ndiscussions.\nIt is evident from the results that most patients heard\nabout their potential fertility compromise from their oncolo-\ngist. But the information also came from various other\nsources, including nurses, social workers, and other profes-\nsionals. It may be beneficial to involve other health care pro-\nfessionals in the process of providing FP information.\nStreamlining the process of FP treatment may avoid unnec-\nessary delay in starting the treatment, for example, setting a\nstandard protocol for informing patients about FP and timely\nreferrals to social workers and the fertility clinic.\nLimitations\nThis was an exploratory study and results obtained from this\nstudy may help generate research questions for future studies.\nHowever, due to the small and nondiverse sample, generaliz-\nability of the data to wider population may not be possible.\nSecondary data analysis of the qualitative interviews\ncan pose certain limitations. These limitations may include\nlack of knowledge of the context of the primary study and\ninsensitivity to the data (Hinds, Vogel, & Clarke-Steffen,\n1997). However, as the researcher was involved with the\nprimary data analysis, the researcher is familiar with the\ndata and context in this case. Questions in the interview\nschedule were not written to generate data regarding com-\nmunication with providers specifically, which may limit\nthe extent to which these patterns were discussed explicitly\nwith participants.\nData were collected retrospectively from the patients;\nhence, there may be some recall biases. However, the pur-\npose of the article was to capture the feelings about the con-\nversation and what exactly stayed with participants from the\ncommunication rather than the exact content of the commu-\nnication, and thus captures the long-term impact of patient\u00ad\nprovider communication on the patients.\nDue to single interviews with the patients, there is an\nabsence of data triangulation. This limitation was compen-\nsated with the review of other qualitative and quantitative\nresearch studies to observe if similar findings were found by\nother research groups.\nThis analysis may incorporate the researcher's biases\nsuch as gender bias as the researcher is a woman who may\napproach fertility from a different perspective than men. Peer\ndebriefing was done to include views of other researchers\nand diminish the personal biases of the researcher.\nResearch and Practice Implications\nPractice Implications\nFP advice to young adult patients must be delivered in a\npatient-centered manner. FP discussion with an appointed\nprovider who may be with the patient throughout the deci-\nsion-making process may lessen the feeling of abandonment.\nMathur et al. 9\nA dedicated social worker or nurse trained specially in the FP\nfield may provide this supportive role during the procedure.\nMore involvement of providers with whom patients have an\nexisting relationship in the onco-fertility team may improve\nthe patient's satisfaction with the decision-making process.\nComplicated language may be a barrier to patients' ease\nof decision making. FP information should be in a language\naccessible to the patients. Fertility consultation may be sup-\nported by the provision of pamphlets with FP information to\ntake home. Presentation of FP information needs further\nattention.\nOther studies on guidelines for communication on cancer\ndiagnosis, treatment, and implications of treatment should be\nderived from patient-based data rather than be limited only to\nclinical opinion (P. N. Butow et al., 1996). Hence, when dis-\ncussing risk to fertility, health care professionals need to\naccount for the patient's state of mind rather than relying\nsolely on their own clinical judgment.\nResearch Implications\nThis study addresses patient's perceptions of communication\nstyles. Future research may focus on finding more about\ncommunication content, timing, and who should provide this\ninformation.\nContent of information.This article emphasizes the impor-\ntance of patient-centered communication of information.\nThe content and mode (flyers, posters, FP awareness cam-\npaign, etc.) of information dissemination can be researched\nfurther to increase awareness. More studies on FP communi-\ncation studying the impact of an FP awareness campaign\nmay be useful.\nWho should provide information?Findings from this analysis\nstate that FP information was provided to the patients by\nvarious providers. Although most patients got information\nfrom their oncologists, others were informed by nurses,\nsocial workers, and other health care providers. Patients also\ndiscussed the gender of the provider who first discussed FP\nwith them. There are unanswered questions about whose\nresponsibility it is to discuss it first. Research should deter-\nmine who along the cancer treatment continuum is the best\nperson to discuss FP with patients?\nConclusion\nFindings from this study indicate that it is essential to\nacknowledge that the FP process is complicated and patients\nlook for more support than is currently provided to them.\nDirective style of communication, considering patient's sta-\ntus and state of mind during initial phase of information pro-\nvision may improve the patient's experience of the fertility\ndecision-making process. Later as patients progress in the FP\ndecision-making process, providers'supportive style of com-\nmunication may lead to higher satisfaction among the\npatients. Enhancing the quality of support to patients through\neffective patient\u00adprovider communication should be a prior-\nity for health care providers. Women undergoing cancer\ntreatment face immense stress of treatment and decision\nmaking. The provider's role is not to merely provide infor-\nmation but to support her through the process of decision\nmaking. Understanding this communication process and\nresponding to the needs of the patients will empower women\nto make the fertility choices that are right for them.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: NIH\nGrant- Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's\nHealth (BIRCWH )(K12).\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society.
