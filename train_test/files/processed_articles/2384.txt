    "abstract": "This article describes a two-step calibration-weighting scheme for a stratified simple random sample of hospital emergency departments. The first step adjusts for unit nonresponse. The second increases the statistical efficiency of most estimators of interest. Both use a measure of emergency-department size and other useful auxiliary variables contained in the sampling frame. Although many survey variables are roughly a linear function of the measure of size, response is better modeled as a function of the log of that measure. Consequently the log of size is a calibration variable in the nonresponse-adjustment step, while the measure of size itself is a calibration variable in the second calibration step. Nonlinear calibration procedures are employed in both steps. We show with 2010 DAWN data that estimating variances as if a one-step calibration weighting routine had been used when there were in fact two steps can, after appropriately adjusting the finite-population correct in some sense, produce standard-error estimates that tend to be slightly conservative.",

Introduction\nThe Drug Abuse Warning Network or DAWN (Substance Abuse and Mental Health\nServices Administration 2012) was a national stratified random sample of US hospitals\nused to estimate annual drug-related emergency-department visits and related statistics.\nThis article describes a calibration-weighting strategy for the DAWN that was never\nimplemented because the survey was discontinued after 2012. Nevertheless, we feel this\nstrategy and our contemplated approach to variance/mean squared error estimation\ncontained some innovative features worth sharing.\nThe DAWN sample was drawn from a list frame provided by the American Hospital\nAssociation (AHA). The frame was stratified by location, size, and ownership type (public\nvs. private). Hospitals were oversampled within 13 metropolitan areas, for which domain\nestimates were published when respondent sample sizes were deemed large enough.\nq Statistics Sweden\n2 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 1 Choke Cherry Road, Rockville MD 20857,\nU.S.A.
