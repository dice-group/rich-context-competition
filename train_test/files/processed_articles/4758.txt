However, important components of the system are often left out\nbecause parameter estimates are unavailable. In particular, measurements of the relative influence of different objectives,\nsuch as risk, environmental management, on farmer decision making, have proven difficult to quantify. We describe a model\nthat can make predictions of land use on the basis of profit alone or with the inclusion of explicit additional objectives.\nImportantly, our model is specifically designed to use parameter estimates for additional objectives obtained via farmer\ninterviews. By statistically comparing the outputs of this model with a large farm-level land-use data set, we show that\ncropping patterns in the United Kingdom contain a significant contribution from farmer's preference for objectives other\nthan profit. In particular, we found that risk aversion had an effect on the accuracy of model predictions, whereas preference\nfor a particular number of crops grown was less important. While nonprofit objectives have frequently been identified as\nfactors in farmers' decision making, our results take this analysis further by demonstrating the relationship between these\npreferences and actual cropping patterns.\n",

Examples include efforts to under-\nstand the implications of potential incentives for greenhouse\ngas mitigation on agriculture (Perez & Muller-Holm, 2001)\nand in predicting the effects of agricultural policy on biodi-\nversity (Pacini,Wossink, Geisen, & Huirne, 2004;Watkinson,\nFreckleton, Robinson, & Sutherland, 2000).\nCentral to most land-use models are assumptions about\nthe behavior of farmers and, in particular, about the decision-\nmaking process adopted when choosing crops. In the vast\nmajority of models (including the one described here), farm-\ners are assumed to act so as to optimize a utility function.\nWhen constructing this utility function, modelers must make\ndecisions about which aspects of farmer behavior to include,\nand which to exclude, as well as how parameters will be esti-\nmated and how the utility function itself will be solved.\nModels that attempt to predict the effects of policy changes\nare often constructed using the technique of mathematical\n1University of Cambridge, UK\n2La-Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia\n3University of Reading, UK\n4Cranfield University, Bedfordshire, UK\n5University of Sheffield, UK\n6British Trust for Ornithology, The Nunnery, Thetford, Norfolk, UK\n7University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nIra R.

Sutherland1\n Keywords\nagriculture, multiattribute utility theory, socioeconomic model, stated preferences\n2 SAGE Open\nprogramming because this accommodates legislated require-\nments and subsidies relatively easily.\nTwo major variants of agricultural mathematical pro-\ngramming models have emerged. The oldest involves explic-\nitly specifying as many aspects of the farming profit function\nas possible, such as rotational constraints, timing of field\noperations, diseases, and environmental runoff (see, for\nAnnetts, Audsley, Mayr, & Reginster, 2003). One advantage\nof this explicit modeling approach is that, because underly-\ning processes are modeled explicitly, these models should be\nmore robust to predicting land use in novel policy scenarios.\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that it is often extremely\ndifficult to quantify all of the required parameters in such an\nexplicit model, and there are inevitably aspects of the system\nthat are omitted. As a consequence, early explicit models\nwere found to have limited predictive accuracy, which led to\nthe development of \"Positive Mathematical Programming\"\n(PMP; Howitt, 1995), in which a relatively simple utility\nfunction is constructed, and a quadratic correction function is\nfound that exactly calibrates the model to reference data. In a\nPMP model, aspects of the system that are difficult to quan-\ntify get subsumed into the correction term. Although this\nmeans that even relatively simple PMP models can appear to\nhave good predictive qualities, it also means that the ability\nof the model to make predictions outside the circumstances\nof the reference data set is limited. PMP and explicit models\ntherefore serve complementary functions in predictive mod-\neling, and it is important that both are pursued. In this article,\nwe focus on explicit models because our goal is to evaluate\nthe importance of particular aspects of farmer's behavior in\ndetermining land use.\nAs farming is a business activity, it is not surprising that\nmany explicit models of farmer behavior have focused purely\non the contribution of profit to utility (Janssen & van Ittersum,\n2007). There is, however, considerable qualitative evidence\nthat farmers also make land-use decisions in response to a\nvariety of nonprofit objectives such as maintaining indepen-\ndence (Gasson, 1973), controlling workload (Fairweather &\nSolano et al., 2001), and caring for the environment (Brodt,\nSolano et al., 2001). While these studies collectively suggest\nthat farmers value outcomes other than pure profit, there is\ncurrently very little quantitative evidence to assess whether\nthis translates to observed behavior. To address this problem,\ndetailed quantitative studies are required across different\nfarming contexts examining the question of whether farmer's\nstated preferences correlate with observed behavior.\nOur goal here is to examine the importance of preferences\nother than profit in determining crop composition for low-\nland arable farmland in England and Wales. Specifically, we\naim to determine whether the addition of key nonprofit pref-\nerences to the utility function of farmers can improve the\nagreement between model outputs and empirical data. To\nachieve this, we develop a method for including multiple\npreferences in the utility function of farmers that is closely\ntied to an interview process eliciting parameters for the\nmodel. We then make use of a detailed and extensive data\nset, the Farm Business Survey (Department for Environment,\nFood and Rural Affairs & National Assembly for Wales,\nand Food & National Assembly for Wales, 2001), which pro-\nvides information on crop yields and areas grown at the indi-\nvidual farm holding level. Model performance can be\nassessed based on agreement between model predictions and\nthe survey data. We compare the performance of a range of\nmodels, including a purely empirical benchmark (a regres-\nsion of crop gross margin against area), a pure-profit model,\nand a model incorporating multiple preferences.\nWe begin by describing the model itself in three parts: (a)\nthe framework for constructing a single weighted objective\n(utility) from a number of subobjectives, (b) how key prefer-\nences were identified and quantified, and (c) how these are\nimplemented within our model. We then describe the meth-\nods used to compare model output with empirical data.\nTrading-Off Multiple Objectives:\nMathematical Framework\nThe core of the model is a description of individual farmer\ndecision making that assumes the selected decision opti-\nmizes a weighted combination of all relevant objectives. We\nused mixed-integer programming for this because it is suited\nto the inclusion of multiple objectives and is widely used in\nland-use simulation models (Arfini, 2005).Alinear or mixed-\ninteger programming model comprises an overall objective\nfunction to be maximized or minimized subject to a series of\nconstraints (Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, & Flannery, 1992).\nThe overall objective function is a simple sum of the follow-\ning form:\nU c x\ni i\ni\n=  .\nIn our model, U is overall utility and x\ni\ndenotes the quan-\ntity of various units, such as areas of crops, number of work-\ners, or number of machines. The constants, c\ni\n, are the amount\nof utility gained or lost for a change in x\ni\nand include crop\ngross margins, labor costs, and machinery costs. For any\ngiven farm, there are constraints on the potential values of x\ni\n,\nsuch as the amount of labor or equipment time available.\nNonlinear relationships can be incorporated through a sys-\ntem of constraints and integer variables called \"special\nordered sets\" (Beale & Forrest, 1976). As special ordered\nsets can substantially increase computation time, we mini-\nmized their use by describing curved objective functions (see\nbelow) with a small (<4) number of line segments.\nCooke et al. 3\nThe utility model comprises multiple objectives, such as\nprofit, risk, and crop complexity, each of which is a sum of\ncontributions from each of the quantities x\ni\n. This leads to a\nhierarchy of sums:\nU u w O\nk k k\nk\n=  ,\nO c x\nk i\nk\ni\ni\n=  ,\nwhere each of the k objectives, O\nk\n, is associated with two\nconstant factors, u\nk\nand w\nk\n. The factor, u\nk\n, converts the units\nof objective k (e.g., profit, risk, or crop complexity) into a\ncommon scale based on utility (see below for a description of\nhow each individual objective is calculated). The weighting\nw\nk\ndetermines the importance of objective k relative to the\nother objectives. Values are renormalized so that \nk k\nEach of the individual k objectives has an associated set of\ncoefficients, c\ni\nk determining the contribution from each x\ni\nto\nthat objective. The solution consists of a vector\nX ={ , , }\nx x x\nn\ndescribing the optimal land-use configura-\ntion. For nonlinear relationships between U and O\nk\n, a special\nordered set constraint is applied, which ensures that an\nappropriate value of u\nk\nis used according to the value of O\nk\nin\ndifferent segments of the curve.\nThe model is implemented as a package, \"farmR\" for the\nopen source statistical environment, R (R Development Core\nTeam, 2008). It uses the open source COIN-LP (http://www.\ncoin-or.org/) numerical library to solve the underlying\nmixed-integer programming problem. The package, includ-\ning source code, is available from the Comprehensive R\nArchive Network (http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/\nArchive/farmR).\nEstimation of Preferences\nAlthough the parameters w\nk\nand u\nk\nfor each objective are\nindistinguishable in mathematical terms (see Equation 2), we\ndistinguish between them in our framework because they are\nconceptually different and must therefore be elicited\nseparately.\nPrior to the interviews, we identified 15 farm manage-\nment objectives based on a literature review, pilot farmer\ninterviews, and a focus group (a complete list of objectives is\nprovided in Appendix A). Subsequently, detailed interviews\nwere conducted using a multicriteria decision analysis frame-\neastern counties of England (Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, and\nNorfolk) to elicit model parameters. The interactive soft-\nware, Logical Decisions\u00ae Version 5.129 (http://www\n.logicaldecisions.com), was used to record data and allow\nfarmers to view their results and revise them if required.\nLogical Decisions is a decision support software based on\nmulticriteria decision making used to implement the Analytic\nHierarchy Process (see, for example, Moffett, Dyer, & Sarkar,\n2006). It was used with our farmers to interactively work\nthrough the objective hierarchy and record data, and allowed\nthe farmers to instantaneously view results, provide feedback,\nand modify their responses iteratively until satisfied. For each\nobjective, the farmers were asked to state the two objective\nvalues at which they would experience 0% and 100% satis-\nfaction (utility). The farmers were then asked to identify their\nsatisfaction level at between 1 and 6 intermediate points,\nresulting in a satisfaction curve. This process provided values\nfor u\nk\n: the slope of the relationship between utility and the kth\nobjective at the various positions along the curve.\nFollowing capture of satisfaction curves, a SMART/\nSWING weighting procedure was carried out (Mustajoki,\nH\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, & Salo, 2005; von Winterfeldt & Edwards,\n1986). The farmers were asked to state the objective that they\nmost wished to move from its worst (0% satisfaction) to its\nbest (100% satisfaction) level. This objective, which was\nalmost always profit, was given a score of 100 and the impor-\ntance of moving every other objective, from the worst to the\nbest level, was scored relative to it. After completing this\nprocess once, the results were normalized so that the sum of\nall preference weights was equal to 1. Upon viewing the nor-\nmalized results, the farmers were given the opportunity to\nrevise their estimates until satisfied that the weights reflected\ntheir preferences. This section of the interview provided a set\nof weights w\nk\nfor each objective.\nChoice of Objectives and Calculation of Weights\nOf the 15 objectives assessed, the most important were profit\n(defined as the sum of revenues and subsidies, less variable\ncosts), risk minimization, free time (defined as time not\nfarming), and crop management complexity (defined as the\ntotal number of crop types grown). Together, these accounted\nfor more than 50% of preference weights. Although free time\nwas listed as second most important on average, simple mod-\nels of free time (based on number of free days per year) were\nsaturated (achieved 100% satisfaction with respect to the\nobjective) without any adjustments to crop choice; the objec-\ntive was therefore excluded from further consideration. Our\nmodel almost certainly does not represent free time well\nbecause it does not include time spent on administration,\naccount for time saved through the use of contractors, or\ninclude preferences for the timing with which free time is\ntaken. We were unable to include such a detailed free time\nmodel in the present study because we did not have access to\ndetailed data on administration time or farmers' preferences\nfor timing of free time. By leaving this component out of our\nobjective function, we make the assumption that it is rela-\ntively orthogonal to the other major objectives under consid-\neration. The model therefore included the three important\nobjectives: profit, risk minimization, and crop management\n4 SAGE Open\ncomplexity. The remaining objectives were given low\nweightings; including them would have added considerable\ncomplexity to the model.\nThe average relative preference weights were profit, 24%;\nperceived risk, 9%; and crop management complexity, 8.5%.\nWhen rescaled such that profit was equal to 100%, the\nweights were 37% for risk and 35% for crop complexity.\nThroughout the remainder of the article, we refer to objective\nweightings assuming that this rescaling has been applied.\nSatisfaction Curves\nThe satisfaction curve for each objective is the relationship\nbetween utility (U) and the objective value. Each of the\nfarmers in our stated preference survey gave an individual\nsatisfaction curve for each objective, and we used averages\nof these curves when calculating model outputs for the Farm\nBusiness Survey farmers. This average curve was deter-\nmined by fitting a spline function to the curve of each\nfarmer, choosing a standard set of x values, and then averag-\ning the y values at each x. To incorporate these curves into\nour model, we converted each curve into between 1 and 4\nlinear segments (depending on the objective), giving a set of\nslopes (u\nk\n).\nThe average stated profit curve (standardized to a 250-ha\nfarm) was a straight line between \u00a30 (0% satisfaction) and\nfrom farmers using the methods described above and repre-\nsent the average points at which a farmer's satisfaction would\nbe saturated (maximum) and fall to 0 (minimum). However,\nfor inclusion in the model, the values of the parameter deter-\nmined from the intercept had to be adjusted to take account\nof the fact that the model objective function predicts net\ngross margin (defined as the sum of crop gross margins\nminus labor and machinery costs) and not profit. This differ-\nence is because various fixed costs, such as rent, insurance,\nbuilding repairs, and administrative costs, are excluded. The\nmodel gave a minimum net gross margin of \u00a360,000 (across\nthe Farm Business Survey input values); among farmers, in\nour stated preference survey, the minimum expected profit\nwas \u00a30. We therefore applied an offset to the profit-utility\ncurve of \u00a360,000 corresponding to the difference between a\nfarmer's stated minimum profit and the minimum profit\nobjective (net gross margin) that was output by the model.\nThis resulted in a recalibrated profit-utility curve so that 0%\nStated satisfaction curves for risk among farmers were\nalmost always linear, with decreasing relationships differing\nin intercepts. To summarize this pattern, we first chose the x\nintercept by finding the average risk value at which the farm-\nvalue at which satisfaction first dropped below 100%\n(\u00a337,000). Our final curve was then a line with two\nsegments--one from risk = 0, satisfaction = 100% to risk =\nDuring pilot interviews, farmers identified the number of\ndifferent crops grown as an important and measurable indi-\ncator of management complexity. Hence, we used the num-\nber of different crop types grown as a measure of crop\nmanagement complexity. The relationship between this\nquantity and overall utility was more complex than for profit\nor risk minimization because different farmers had three\nqualitatively different curve shapes. One group preferred to\nminimize the number of crops grown (monotonic decreasing\ncurve), another group preferred an intermediate number\n(humped curve), and the remaining farmers preferred to\nmaximize the number of crops grown within the range avail-\nable (monotonic increasing curve). The proportion of farm-\ntranslate this into a form suitable for the model, we calcu-\nlated an average curve (utility against crop number) for each\ngroup. The actual curves used are shown in Figure 1, and all\ncropping predictions made from our model were calculated\nas weighted sums of solutions for each of the three farmer\npreference types.\nModel Components for Specific\nObjectives\nProfit Objective\nWe use a profit model (see Annetts & Audsley, 2002;\nRounsevell et al., 2003, for a full description) to calculate\nFigure 1. Average stated preference curves for crop\nmanagement complexity showing three different groups of\nfarmers.\nNote: Open circles = those who prefer complex cropping arrangements,\nclosed triangles = those who prefer intermediate cropping arrangements,\nand closed circles = those who prefer the simplest cropping arrangements\npossible. These curves were used to specify the shape of the utility versus\ncrop complexity function in the socioeconomic model.\nCooke et al. 5\nincome generation from an arable farm. The profit objective\n(defined as annual net gross margin) of this model is the sum,\nO G a C x C n\ni i\ni\nijk ijk\nijk\nm m\nm\nprofit\n= + +\n   ,\nwhich is composed of three parts: the gross margin, G\ni\n, for\neach crop; the costs, C\nijk\n, of each field operation, including\nany timeliness penalty (the jth operation on crop i in period\nk); and the costs, C\nm\n, of the machines and labor required to\nperform the field operations. The model variables are a\ni\n, the\narea of crop i; x\nijk\n, the area of operation, j, on crop i in period\nk; and the number of machines n\nm\nof type m. Each variable is\naccompanied by its corresponding coefficient.\nA series of constraints is applied to ensure that only\nrealistic solution vectors are obtained when maximizing\nthe profit objective (Equation 4). These constraints have\npreviously been described in detail by Rounsevell et al.\nthey ensure that the following conditions are met: (a)\ntotal land area is constant, (b) all necessary field opera-\ntions are performed for each crop in the required sequence,\n(c) the labor and machinery required to perform field\noperations do not exceed that available, and (d) that crops\nare rotated such as to prevent the buildup of diseases and\npests. These constraints and their associated parameters\nform the model's description of the farming system.\nParameters include commodity prices, machinery work\nrates, rotational constraints on crops, and the timing of\nagricultural operations required to bring a crop to har-\nvest. The parameters come from a wide variety of sources,\nthe details of which are provided in Appendix B (Table\nB1). The exact parameter values used are available as\nonline supplementary material.\nThe model is based on a description of farming at the\nlevel of a single operation and assumes that the soil type\nand rainfall are constant across the entire farm. As large\nfarms may include land with a variety of soil types, we\nused a weighted average solution over the soil types pres-\nent in the county where the farm was located. Yearly rain-\nfall was taken to be the average for that county. Soil type\nand rainfall affect the work rates for various operations,\nand the amount of time available for fieldwork in each\nfortnight of the year. In cases where crop yield values\nwere not available from the Farm Business Survey for a\nparticular farmer, a calculation based on soil type and\nrainfall was used to obtain a predicted yield. This calcula-\ntion was performed by extrapolating between worst and\nbest expected yields for a crop (Agro Business\nhave the lowest yields and heavy soils the highest. Soil\ntypes were calculated based on the methodology described\nRisk Minimization Objective\nWe included a risk objective in our model following the basic\nprinciple of minimization of total absolute deviation in prof-\nits (Hazell, 1971). This is an approximation to the true risk in\nwhole-farm profit because it does not explicitly account for\nthe \"risk spreading\" that occurs when farmers grow a range\nof crops with uncorrelated deviations. In our model, the risk\nobjective was calculated according to the formula:\nO x\ni i\ni\nrisk\n= \n  ,\nwhere the sum is over all crops, x\ni\nis the area of the ith\ncrop, \ni\nis the standard deviation in output (price times yield)\nper hectare for the ith crop, and  is a constant factor\n(explained below). In interviews, farmers were asked to\nspecify their stated preference for risk. It is unrealistic to\nexpect interview participants to conceptualize risk directly in\nmathematical terms, so they were instead asked to envisage a\nseries of scenarios in which the range of their farm income\n(difference between minimum and maximum over a period\nof 3-4 years) varied from \u00a30 (minimum) up to the maximum\nrange they would expect. While this definition is different\nfrom that used in our model, we assume that the two are\nrelated by the constant factor, . To estimate , we make the\nfollowing approximate argument.\nFirst, the expected deviation in whole-farm profit will be\nless than the sum of absolute deviations in profitability of the\ndifferent crops grown. As farmers grow five crops on aver-\nage (as indicated by the Farm Business Survey) and assum-\ning that crop outputs vary independently, the whole-farm risk\nshould equal the deviation in the average income from five\nindependently varying values. Thus, the sample standard\ndeviation of effective total profit should roughly equal / 5\n, where  is the area-weighted average of standard deviations\nof individual crops. We assumed that farmers considered the\nmaximum and minimum possible values of their income\nbased on 10 years experience (many farmers had much more\nexperience farming, but as farm technology and policies\nchange rapidly, we assumed that this was a reasonable rele-\nvant range). We related this to the standard deviation in crop\nprofitability by considering a sample of 10 independent years\nfrom a distribution with standard deviation \ni\nand calculating\nthe range of the sample numerically. The result of this calcu-\nI\n. Combining this with the fact that risks are\nspread among crops, we obtain an approximate value of \nequal to 1.4. This value is clearly approximate, so we exam-\nvalue that resulted in the best fit to data (after also minimiz-\ning the sum of squared differences over risk and crop com-\nplexity preferences) was  = 1.0; we used this value in all\nsubsequent analyses.\n6 SAGE Open\nStatistical Methodology for Comparing\nLand-Use Data With Model Outputs\nEmpirical Data Used\nWe compared the outputs of the socioeconomic model with a\nlargenationaldataset,theFarmBusinessSurvey(Department\nfor Environment, Food and Rural Affairs & National\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Food & National Assembly for\nWales, 2001). The Farm Business Survey is an annual survey\nof farm businesses across the United Kingdom, including\naround 3,000 farms in England and Wales. We used the data\nfrom England and Wales in this study. Information is pro-\nvided on an individual farm basis and includes the area,\nyield, and sale price of each crop grown but not the precise\nlocation of the farm. For this analysis, we selected lowland\narable farms. Specifically, we included farmers whose hold-\nings were largely below 300 m altitude and for whom arable\ncrops and set-aside accounted for more than 85% of their\nfarmed area. From this sample, we excluded farms <100 ha,\nbecause off-farm income probably constitutes a significant\nportion of the farm business in such cases.\nAs the farming model makes predictions about long-term\ncropping, we used average crop areas in the time period 2000\nto 2004, calculated individually for each farm. We chose this\nperiod to avoid modeling farmer responses to the introduc-\ntion of the single farm payment (introduced in 2005), because\nthe long-term effects of this policy are unlikely to be appar-\nent during its introductory phase, and it would therefore pro-\nvide inappropriate data for comparison with our equilibrium\nmodel. Farms were excluded if more than 2 years' data were\nincluded individual average crop areas between 2000 and\nWe configured the model to predict land use for eight\ncrops (including bare fallow/set-aside) with a combined area\nthat accounts for approximately 85% of arable land in\nEngland (Department for Environment, Food and Rural\nAffairs, 2008). Crops were winter wheat, winter oilseed rape,\nwinter barley, spring barley, legumes (arable pea and bean\ncrops), sugar beet, and potatoes. We also included temporar-\nily unused \"set-aside\" land. All our comparisons between\nsimulated and actual land use were made relative to the area\nof these land-use types.\nModel Runs\nTo generate cropping predictions for each farm, we used the\ntime-averaged crop yield values for each farm in our sample\nfrom the Farm Business Survey, as inputs for our socioeco-\nnomic model. Other than soil type and rainfall (which varied\nby county), all other variables were kept fixed across farms.\nIn cases where a farmer did not grow a particular crop, we\nallowed the model to generate yield values for that crop\nbased on soil type and rainfall (see \"Profit Objective\" sec-\ntion). As the location of farms in the Farm Business Survey\nwas only known to county level, we used a weighted average\nof model results for each of the soil types and rainfalls pres-\nent in that county. An additional issue associated with the use\nof such spatially coarse data is that the distance to sugar beet\nfactories is unknown, so the cost of sugar beet haulage can-\nnot be calculated. As haulage has a very strong effect on the\nprofitability of sugar beet (Nix, 2007), we did not attempt to\npredict its area but simply fixed its value to the area reported\nin the Farm Business Survey. Our comparisons of model fit\nare therefore based on relative crop areas excluding sugar\nbeet.\nMeasuring Model Fit\nWe evaluated the fit of our socioeconomic model to empiri-\ncal data in three ways by (a) calculating a general metric of\ndisagreement between model outputs and data across all\ncrops, (b) testing for correlations between crop areas in the\nmodel and data at the aggregate level (i.e., averages across\nall farmers), and (c) assessing the fit of a multivariate crop-\nchoice regression of model outputs against data at the indi-\nvidual farm level.\nThe metric comparing predicted and observed data is sim-\nply the sum of squared differences:\nSS = -\n( )\n\n x o\nci ci\nc\ni\n,\nwhere x\nci\nis the model prediction for the area of crop c on\nthe ith individual farm, and o\nci\nis the respective observed\nvalue. We used this as a measure of absolute disagreement\nbetween model outputs and data. To test whether there were\nsignificant absolute differences between x\nc\nand o\nc\n, we used a\nsign test (a nonparametric test for significant difference\nbetween paired samples) for each crop type.\nTo test for correlations between crop areas at the aggre-\ngate level, we first calculated the average relative crop areas\nacross all farmers in the model and in the data set. We then\ntested for correlations between model and data by calculating\na Spearman rank correlation, treating the average area for\neach crop as an independent datum.\nTo compare modeled and observed data at the individual\nfarm level, we fitted a crop-choice regression. Our statistical\nmodel is similar to other crop-choice models (e.g., Seo &\nMendelsohn, 2008), but allows for multiple choices, as U.K.\narable farmers always grow a variety of crops. We label the\nvector of actual crop choices for the ith observation, c\ni\n, and\nwe label the corresponding model outputs x\ni\n. The crop-\nchoice vectors from the socioeconomic model, x\ni\n, are viewed\nas the independent variable and the actual crop-choice\nvectors are viewed as the dependent variable. In their raw\nform, the relative crop areas in each vector c\ni\nare continuous\nCooke et al. 7\nvariables, but actually farmers make cropping choices in dis-\ncrete chunks depending on a range of factors, including the\nsize of fields and the available resources. Thus, the dominant\nunderlying process giving rise to c\ni\nis not continuous but dis-\ncrete. For this reason, we modeled c\ni\nas a vector of counts\nwhere each element represents the number of area subunits\nallotted to a crop. This choice was also motivated by the fact\nthat histograms of the elements of c were strongly nonnor-\nmal, showing a mode at or close to zero and another mode at\nsome larger value. To convert from continuous crop areas to\ndiscrete counts, we set the number of subunits per farm equal\nto 20. We then rounded values of the elements of c\ni\nto the\nnearest multiple of the subunit size. As the use of smaller\nnumbers of subunits leads to an increase in rounding error,\nwe tested several potential values for the number of subunits\nper farm and chose 20, because it was the largest value such\nthat each of the elements of c\ni\napproximated a binomial dis-\ntribution. It is important to note that although the total num-\nber of subunits is 20, this equates to an effective number of\nsubunits per crop of between 2 and 5, depending on the crop\narea, and is therefore much more strongly discrete than it\nmight at first seem.\nWe assumed that our crop responses, c, came from a mul-\ntinomial distribution with probabilities j\ncorresponding to\nthe relative probabilities that a subunit of land would be allo-\ncated to the jth crop type. Each observation has associated\nwith it a vector of such probabilities, \n \n \n\ni i ij im\n= [ , , , , ]\n\nand we assume that the log odds \nij\n/\nof choosing crop j\ncompared with Crop 1 (the reference crop which we chose to\nbe winter wheat) are related to the outputs of the mechanistic\nmodel. This statistical model is summarized in Equation 7:\nc N\nx x\ni i i\nij\ni\nj j ij i\n\nmultinomial \n\n\n  \n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n = + -\nlog\n,\nwhere  and  are intercept and slope coefficients, respec-\ntively.Anonzero value for \nj\nindicates a relationship between\npredicted and observed data for crop j, whereas a value of 0\nindicates that the crop area prediction is unrelated to the\nactual crop area.\nIn all our statistical analyses, we used Bayesian inference\nwith uninformative priors to estimate parameter values.\nSpecifically, we used normal distributions with  = 1,000 as\npriors for the  and  parameters. Posterior densities were\ncalculated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with\nthe Metropolis algorithm via the function \"metrop\" in the R\npackage MCMC. We used the posterior modes as starting\nvalues, and obtained these via a call to the \"optim\" function\nin R. We also used the \"optim\" function to calculate the vari-\nance\u00adcovariance matrix, which was in turn used to scale the\njump size in \"metrop.\" We used 10 million samples and dis-\ncarded the first half as burn-in. Convergence was checked\nusing the Geweke (1992) diagnostic (see also Cowles &\nCarlin, 1996) via the R package \"coda\" (Plummer, Best,\nModel comparisons were performed using the deviance\ninformation criterion (DIC) (Spiegelhalter, Best, Carlin, &\nvan der Linde, 2002). The DIC is a Bayesian model selection\ncriterion that penalizes complex models with more parame-\nters in a similar manner to the Akaike information criterion\n(AIC), commonly used in frequentist analyses. DIC is calcu-\nlated directly from posterior densities according to the for-\nmula (Gelman, Carlin, Stern, & Rubin, 2002):\nDIC\navg\n= ( )- ( )\n\nD y D y\nwhere 2  ( )\nD y\navg\nis the average of the deviance over the\nposterior samples and D y\n\n( )\n\nis a point estimate of the\ndeviance at the posterior mean value of the parameters. The\ndeviance is defined as twice the negative of the log likeli-\nhood. We use DIC throughout, though our overall conclu-\nsions would be unaffected by alternative choices of criteria\nfor model fit.\nWe modeled the relationship between predicted and actual\ncropping using three different analyses based on the statisti-\ncal model shown in Equation 7. In each analysis, the predic-\ntor variable is altered to reflect a different conceptual model\nof the system. The first predictor variable represented a\nbenchmark unrelated to the mechanistic model, and was sim-\nply the gross margin value for each crop type. This bench-\nmark regression quantifies the relationship between variable\ninputs to the mechanistic model (gross margins) and actual\ncrop area. The remaining predictor variables were (a) outputs\nfrom the socioeconomic model based on pure-profit maximi-\nzation; (b) outputs from the socioeconomic model, including\nvalues for risk and crop complexity preferences obtained\nfrom the stated preferences survey; and (c) outputs from the\nsocioeconomic model, including values for risk and crop\ncomplexity that were a best fit to the sum of squared differ-\nences (Equation 5).\nResults\nBest-Fit Estimates for Risk and Crop Complexity\nPreferences\nThe relationship between model fit (measured as sum of\nsquared differences) and a range of risk and crop complexity\npreferences is shown in Figure 2. The plot shown represents\n = 1, and has a clear minimum point when the risk parame-\nter equals 22% of the profit preference (all preference\nweights are relative to profit at 100%). The relative influence\nof the risk preference on model fit is clearly much larger than\nfor the crop complexity objective, but a less obvious mini-\nmum also exists for this parameter at 8%. These risk and\ncrop complexity values represent average revealed\n8 SAGE Open\npreferences for the farmers in the Farm Business Survey.\nThey compare with averages of the stated preference weights\nof 37% and 35% for risk and crop complexity, respectively,\nderived from our survey of 47 farmers.\nAggregate-Level Comparisons\nFor all crops, sign tests showed significant differences\nbetween model outputs and the Farm Business Survey results\n(the hypothesis x = c was rejected with p < 10-5 in all cases).\nThis clearly demonstrates that for each of the crops, there is\na bias in model predictions away from the observed values.\nThe magnitude of these biases can be seen in Figure 3, which\ncompares average crop areas (across all 149 farms) in the\nFarm Business Survey data and the model predictions.\nResults are shown for the pure-profit model (Figure 3a), a\nmodel using the best-fit (minimum sum of squared differ-\nences) values for risk and crop complexity (Figure 3b), and a\nmodel with stated preference values for the risk and crop\ncomplexity parameters (Figure 3c). In each plot, a straight\nline indicates perfect agreement between modeled and\nobserved data. Winter wheat is clearly the dominant crop but\nis always underpredicted by the model. In the pure-profit\ncase (Figure 3a), the model severely overpredicts the area of\npotatoes and, to a lesser extent, overpredicts oilseed rape and\nbean crop areas. This fit is improved when farmer's revealed\nand stated preferences for risk minimization are taken into\naccount (Figures 3b and 3c). The main changes occur when\nrisk preferences are applied. In particular, potatoes (which\nhave high risk), and set-aside (which is low risk, with guar-\nanteed subsidy income and near zero input cost), change rap-\nidly as the risk preference is increased.\nA Spearman rank test for correlation was not significant\nfor the pure-profit model (Figure 3a;  = .53, p = .23) but was\nsignificant for the model including stated preferences (Figure\nrevealed preferences (best-fit preferences from Figure 2)\ngave an intermediate correlation coefficient (Figure 3b;  =\n.75, p = .06). At first sight, this last result would seem to\ncontradict the fact that the revealed preferences represent the\nminimum of sum of squared differences. However, as the\nSpearman rank test is based purely on rank order rather than\nminimizing squared differences, there is no inconsistency to\nbe resolved.\nFigure 2. Variation in model fit as a function of risk minimization\npreference and crop management complexity preference weights.\nNote: The vertical axis is the sum of squared differences between model\nand data (\u00d710-5). The best fit occurs at risk minimization = 22% and crop\nmanagement = 8%. The grid size is 2 \u00d7 2 percentage points.\nFigure 3. Comparison between the relative areas of the observed and simulated crops, showing a comparison (a) based on a pure-\nprofit maximization model, (b) using outputs from a model using best-fit values of risk and crop complexity preferences, and (c) based on\nmodel outputs, including stated preference values for risk minimization and crop complexity.\nNote: Solid lines in all figures represent perfect agreement between model and simulation. Areas for sugar beet are not shown because these were fixed\nfor each farm (see \"Statistical Methodology for Comparing Land-Use Data With Model Outputs\" section).\nCooke et al. 9\nIndividual-Level Comparisons\nPredicted (using stated preferences) and observed crop areas\nfor seven types of land use on the 149 Farm Business Survey\nfarms are compared in Figure 4. Visual inspection of this fig-\nure reveals that there is clearly a large amount of residual\nvariation. The best predictions are obtained for winter wheat\n(the dominant crop) and for set-aside. Our statistical analysis\n(using the model described by Equation 7) revealed positive\nrelationships between predicted and observed areas for most\ncrops in Figure 4. The results of this regression are presented\nin Table 1 for four different models: (a) a purely empirical\nmodel that simply regressed crop gross margins against\nobserved crop areas, (b) a pure-profit run of the model, (c) a\nrun of the model using revealed preferences for risk and crop\ncomplexity (the best fits to the sum of squared deviations),\nand (d) a run of the model using stated preference values for\nrisk and crop complexity. The overall ability of each model\nvariant to explain variation in the observed cropping is sum-\nmarized by the DIC values (small values are better). Note\nthat in the case of the stated preference model, the DIC was\nmodified by 1 to account for the externally fitted parameter \nand was modified by 3 for the revealed preference model to\naccount for fitted risk and crop complexity as well as . The\nstated preference model is clearly the best on this criterion,\nfollowed by the revealed preference model, and then the\npure-profit model. The purely empirical benchmark model\nshows the worst fit.\nFigure 4.

DIC values are shown relative to the best model.\nDiscussion\nIn this article, we conducted a detailed statistical comparison\nbetween the outputs of a farm-level land-use model and\nobserved cropping decisions over a 5-year period (2000-\n2004). Two main findings are presented. The first is that\nmodel results are essentially uncorrelated with actual farmer\nbehavior, unless the model is modified to include farmer\npreferences other than pure profit (in our case, risk aversion\nand crop management complexity). Our second finding is\nthat stated preference results can be used to parameterize\nmodels of farmer behavior, quantifying preference for risk\naversion and potentially other preferences that might influ-\nence crop management decisions.\nThe question of whether multiple farm preferences (espe-\ncially risk aversion) are a required component of predictive\nland-use models has been studied for many years. For exam-\nple, Lin, Dean, and Moore (1974) reached the conclusion\nthat profit-only models were inadequate based on a small\nsample of 6 farms, and more recently Rounsevell et al. (2003)\nfound that farmers were approximately profit maximizers.\nNevertheless, despite the long history of work examining\nthis question, it remains unresolved (Just & Pope, 2003),\npartly because the sample sizes of some previous studies\nhave been too small to analyze statistically (see, for example,\nbecause risk aversion is not likely to be important in all farm-\ning contexts (Edwards-Jones, Dreary, & Willcock, 1998). It\nis therefore unlikely that any single study will completely\nresolve the issue. Rather, a series of studies such as ours,\nwhich statistically compare model outputs with observed\nfarmer behavior, and which use a large sample size (149\nfarms) are needed to examine the validity of modeling\napproaches in specific contexts.\nThere is a considerable body of work describing models\nfor predicting the behavior of arable farmers in the United\nKingdom and for closely related farming systems in conti-\nnental Europe. A particularly relevant example is the work of\nRounsevell et al. (2003), who used a similar profit model to\nours, and conducted a quasi validation using a large number\nof sample points across East Anglia. Based on a comparison\nof crop areas for wheat, grass, and cereals, Rounsevell et al.\nfound support for a profit-only model, but suggested that fac-\ntors such as risk might also be important (though this was not\ntested). As our conclusions are somewhat at odds with the\nresults of this article, it is worth explaining the difference. In\nour case, we conducted statistics on the basis of crop choice\nacross a wide range of crops (8), and effectively tested the\nmodel's ability to predict choices based on known yields and\nprices (inputs in our case). In contrast, Rounsevell et al.\nattempted to predict yields (using a formula based on soil\ntype) but concentrated on the model's ability to predict major\ncrops. The difference between our results and those of\nRounsevell et al. is interesting because they suggest that\nfarmers'choices may be more consistent with profit maximi-\nzation when choosing among major crops, but that risk and\nother factors may influence those choices when minor crops\nand break crops are considered. Although small in total area,\nminor land uses such as set-aside or spring crops can be very\nimportant when modeling environmental issues.\nWe used a mixed-integer programming model to repre-\nsent the profit, risk, and crop complexity functions of farm-\ners in our study. Models of this type have a long history in\nagricultural modeling and many such models remain in use\nas policy tools (Arfini, 2005). The important alternative of\nof a simplified profit function to which a correction is found\nsuch that the model can exactly reproduce a training data set.\nThe advantage of this approach is that any aspect of the sys-\ntem that is relatively static does not need explicit description\nbut instead can be subsumed into the correction function.\nAlthough this approach has proven to be very useful for pol-\nicy prediction, it typically subsumes many aspects of farmer\nbehavior, including risk aversion and crop complexity pref-\nerence into the correction function. This is a problem if the\ngoal of the study is to predict behavior under circumstances\nsubstantially different from the training data. It is therefore\nimportant that research into more explicit models continues\nalongside development of PMP. In particular, our study\nchose an explicit modeling approach rather than PMP\nbecause our goal was to explicitly test the importance of\nincluding behavioral functions in the model and to provide a\nmeans for their parameterization via interviews.\nOne of the principal practical difficulties with multiobjec-\ntive behavioral models is that the relative weights of differ-\nent objectives are difficult to quantify. In our study, we\nobtained these objective weights independently using\ndetailed interviews with a sample of 49 farmers. Although\ninterviews and stated preference surveys of farmers have\noften found support for land-use objectives other than profit\n1994), our study is unique in its ability to transfer these stated\npreferences directly into a land-use model. The main advan-\ntage of using stated preferences to parameterize a model is\nthat they can be obtained relatively easily and independently\nof the land-use data used to test the model. The disadvantage\nis that it is difficult to elicit numerically accurate statements\nfrom interview participants without introducing well-known\nbiases (P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen, Vrolijk, & H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, 2001; Weber &\nBorcherding, 1993). For two key land-use objectives, risk\npreference and crop complexity preference, we obtained val-\nues corresponding to a best fit between our model and farmer\nbehavior (in the form of land-use data). We found that the\nagreement between these best-fit values and stated values\nwas much better for risk aversion than for crop complexity\npreference. As we used average satisfaction curves for both\nthese objectives in our model, this disparity may be due to\ndifferences in the variance of satisfaction curves for each\nobjective. It is difficult to reduce variance satisfaction curves\nto a simple numeric measure, but at a semiquantitative level,\nit is clear that risk (45/47 farmers with monotonic decreasing\ncurves) was much less variable than crop complexity (31%\ndecreasing, 50% humped, and 19% increasing). The fact that\nwe condensed this variability into an average set of objective\ncurves to be used across all farmers is not ideal, especially\nfor the crop complexity parameter. In future work, we would\nlike to collect land-use data for the 49 farmers interviewed\nrather than rely on existing land-use databases that provide\ndata for different farmers.\nTight integration in this study between model building\nand the design of preference elicitation interviews was essen-\ntial for developing a well-parameterized socioeconomic\nmodel. In addition to providing parameters, the stated prefer-\nence survey was used to screen objectives for inclusion in the\nmodel based on the relative importance to farmers and rela-\ntive influence on crop-choice variability. As model complex-\nity rapidly increases with the inclusion of additional\nobjectives, this latter step is crucial to successful model\ndevelopment. However, it is possible that further improve-\nments to the accuracy of arable landscape models could be\nachieved through the inclusion of additional objectives such\nas landscape structure, wildlife, and nonproduction land use.\nThe key to the success of such work, however, will be the\njoint collection of detailed financial, physical, and prefer-\nence information at the individual farm level. Such informa-\ntion will be essential to reduce noise due to parameter error\nand allow the relative performance of different models to be\nassessed.\nAppendix A\nFarmer Objectives forAgricultural Land-Use Models In elic-\niting measurable farmer objectives, a stepwise procedure\nencompassing literature review, pilot interviews, and focus\ngroup discussions was used to identify and classify objec-\ntives. This led to the identification of 15 criteria (objectives)\nthat could be measured, grouped under 7 fundamental objec-\ntives. The appearance of the farm was the most complex\nobjective with 7 criteria identified, the remaining objectives\nhaving either one or two criteria measures.\nFarming income (\u00a3/year): This is defined as annual\nincome generated through land management only, con-\nsisting of crop enterprise output, single farm payment,\nagri-environment payments, other land-based grants\nand subsidies, and land-based diversification income\nafter fixed and variable costs were accounted for.\nRisk (absolute deviation in arable farming income): Some\nfarmers are prepared to cope with a widely varying\nincome on the chance that some years will be very\ngood. Others would rather have an income that is more\nconstant across years but potentially lower. Farmers\nwere asked to provide the best possible and worst pos-\nsible amount their farming income could vary by over\na 5-year period. The shape of utility was then assessed\nacross this range.\nManagement complexity: Less formally, this is the amount\nof difficulty associated with running a number of dif-\nferent enterprises and operations simultaneously\nwithin the farming year. For this objective, farmers\nwere asked to consider two different land management\ncriteria--the number of different crops grown and the\nnumber of different entry-level environmental stew-\nardship options managed.\nAppearance of the farm: Concerns about the environment\ntended to be split into those that had an effect on the\nappearance and atmosphere of the farm, and those that\ninfluenced natural resources (water, soil, and air). The\ncriteria identified for this objective encompassed land-\nscape structure (length of hedgerow, area of wood-\nland), biodiversity (bird species diversity, bird species\npopulation size), and the appearance of cropped areas\n(number of tall weeds that appear above the crop can-\nopy, number of low weeds, number of skylark squares).\nLifestyle and recreation: The personal circumstances of\nfarmers vary widely. Two ways in which lifestyle and\nrecreation directly influence land management were\nidentified--the amount of time spent farming and the\namount of time spent shooting game. First, the time\navailable for farming can vary for a number of rea-\nsons, from semiretirement to having a full-time job\nelsewhere and farming during weekends and annual\nleave. In terms of land management, the reasons for\nneeding more or less free time are not as important as\nthe number of days available to the individual for\nfarming. Second, if an important component of farm-\ners' recreational activity is a game shoot, it is likely\nthat this will also influence their land management\ndecisions.\nAutonomy (number of regulatory constraint sets): With\nthe exception of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, participa-\ntion in English agricultural land-based schemes is not\nmandatory. These nonmandatory schemes come with\nan administrative burden and a set of rules and regula-\ntions to abide by. Farmers were asked to consider\nwhether they would not sign up to schemes because of\nthe additional regulatory constraints.\nLand-based diversification (commercial shooting): There\nare two aspects that potentially distinguish land man-\nagement for commercial shooting, that is, on-farm\ngame shooting activity catering for paying individuals,\nfrom recreational shooting identified under lifestyle\nand recreation. First, the measurement scales on which\nutility is measured were found to be different.\nSatisfaction with recreational shooting was expressed\nin terms of the time that could be spent on the activity\n(days per season). The utility of a commercial shoot\nwas expressed as the number of paid for birds shot per\nseason. Second, the management required to generate\nincome from shooting may run counter to the manage-\nment required for optimal arable output, resulting in a\ntrade-off between income sources. For these reasons,\ncommercial shooting was assessed separately (see\nFigure B1).\nFigure A1. Farmer objective measures.\nTable B1.

Cooke is currently a research scientist with the Life Sciences\nComputation Centre at La Trobe University, Australia. He has\napplied computational and statistical techniques to answering a\nbroad range of life science questions ranging from landscape ecol-\nogy to subcellular processes.\nElizabeth H. A. Mattison is a postdoctoral research assistant\nwhose work explores land managers' beliefs and intentions and\ntheir effects on associated biodiversity. She has worked in a variety\nof agricultural and wildlife management contexts developing pre-\ndictive models of biodiversity outcomes.\nEric Audsley is a principal research fellow at Cranfield University.\nBefore that, he worked for 34 years at Silsoe Research Institute,\nformerly the U.K. Agricultural Research Council's National\nInstitute of Agricultural Engineering, until its closure in 2005. He\nhas developed the application of mathematical and operational\nresearch techniques to the analysis of decisions concerning a very\nwide range of agricultural systems. Currently major areas are linear\nprogramming modeling of farms to predict future agricultural land\nuse and model-based environmental Life Cycle Inventory Analysis\n(LCA) of agricultural production systems.\nAlison P. Bailey is a senior lecturer in agricultural business man-\nagement at the University of Reading. Her research focuses on the\nanalysis of agricultural production systems and the relationship\nbetween agriculture, the environment, and socioeconomic criteria.\nThis includes assessment of farmer decision-making processes and\nmotivations associated with farming practice.\nRobert P. Freckleton is a professor of population biology at the\nUniversity of Sheffield. He works on the application of ecological\nand evolutionary models to understand the effects of environmental\nchange on ecological systems.\nAnil Graves is a Senior Research Fellow in Land Use Systems and\napplies his background in the natural and social sciences to investi-\ngating land use problems. Initially he spent several years in India\nresearching the hydrological and social impacts of reforestation,\ncoastal saline intrusion, and groundwater abstraction. Since return-\ning to the UK, he has worked on a range of UK and EU projects,\nresearching the biophysical, economic, and social aspects of arable,\nforestry, and agroforestry systems in Europe, and more recently, on\nthe application of the ecosystem framework.\nJoe Morris is emeritus professor in resource economics and\nmanagement in the School of Applied Sciences, Cranfield\nUniversity, Bedford, England. His recent work has focused on\nthe sustainable management of agriculture and natural resources\nwith particular reference to the economics of land, water, and\necosystems.\nSimon A. Queenborough is currently a senior research associate\nat The Ohio State University, USA. He is interested in mecha-\nnisms of species coexistence, and the evolutionary and ecological\neffects of variation in breeding systems and patterns of resource\nallocation.\nDaniel L. Sandars is a research fellow in operational research in\nnatural resource management at Cranfield University's School of\nApplied Sciences and formerly at the Silsoe Research Institute's\nBiomathematics, and Mathematics and Decisions Systems groups.\nGavin M. Siriwardena is head of Land-Use Research at the\nBritish Trust for Ornithology. He works primarily on bird ecology\nin farmland and other terrestrial habitats, with a particular focus on\npopulation responses to management and habitat characteristics.\nPaul Trawick is the chair of the Department of Sociocultural\nAnthropology at Idaho State University. His research interests\nfocus on the management of water for irrigation, viewing the prob-\nlem as a social rather than a technological one. By comparing suc-\ncessful irrigation systems in different parts of the world, he has\nidentified the institutions and operating principles for sharing a\nscarce water resource.\nAndrew R. Watkinson is executive director of the Living With\nEnvironmental Change partnership and a professorial fellow at the\nUniversity of East Anglia. He was formerly director of the Tyndall\nCentre for Climate Change Research. He is interested in the appli-\ncation of population biology in farming systems and the impacts of\nenvironmental change on the coastal zone.\nWilliam J. Sutherland holds the Miriam Rothschild Chair in con-\nservation biology at the University of Cambridge. He is interested\nin predictive models of ecological systems, improving the effec-\ntiveness of the use of science in policy and in evidence-based\nconservation."
