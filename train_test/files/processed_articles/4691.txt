Symmetrical patterns are produced by transformations that preserve the metric\nstructure of the pattern. In the plane, these transformations are reflection, translation, rotation and\nglide reflection (Palmer, 1991; Wagemans, 1995). Although these patterns are equally regular, some\nare more salient for the human visual system. Over 100 years ago, Ernst Mach noticed that bilat-\neral reflectional symmetry is most easily detected, particularly when the axis of reflection is vertical\n(Mach, 1886/1959). The perceptual advantage for vertical reflection has subsequently been confirmed\nby many psychophysical studies, most measuring reaction times (Palmer & Hemenway, 1978; Royer,\nSeveral papers have shown that relative perceptual advantage for reflection compared to transla-\ntion can be altered by the context in which the contours are presented (Baylis & Driver, 1995; Ber-\ntamini, Friedenberg, & Kubovy, 1997; Corballis & Roldan, 1974). When the reflected contours are part\nof the same object, detection is quicker than when the reflected contours are part of separate objects\n(Figure 1a and c). This within-object advantage does not hold for translation, and some studies have\nreported that translation is more rapidly detected when the translated contours form part of two sepa-\nrate objects (Figure 1b and d). This pattern of results is usually formalized as an interaction between\nregularity type (reflection, translation) and number of objects (one, two), and the cause of this interac-\ntion has been explored in several recent papers (Bertamini, 2010; Bertamini, Friedenberg, & Argyle,\nGrouping by closure influences subjective regularity and\nimplicit preference\n520 Makin A, Pecchinenda A, Bertamini M\nSymmetry holds a particular fascination because it is so closely related to subjective beauty. Art-\nists and architects have celebrated symmetry for thousands of years (Ramachandran & Hirstein, 1999),\nand symmetry has consistently been shown to be the best predictor of preference for abstract, geo-\nsingle hypothesis: Factors that affect the salience of visual regularities should also affect preference\nfor these patterns. Specifically, preference for reflection over translation should be altered by whether\nthe contours are part of the same object.\nThis prediction is based on the idea that sensitivity should be linked to preference. Many authors\nhave discussed this idea, and in particular it is central to the fluency account of aesthetics (Reber, Wurtz,\n& Zimmermann, 2004). This fluency theory maintains that objects that are processed fluently (i.e.,\nquickly detected and unambiguous) are preferred to those that are processed less fluently (i.e., difficult\nto detect or ambiguous). There is some empirical support for the fluency hypothesis (Cannon, Hayes, &\n& Catty, 2012). However, one advantage of the current work is the comparison between stimuli that are\nequally regular in mathematical terms but are processed differently by the visual system.\nPrevious work on preference has typically involved explicit ratings. However, this approach has\nvarious problems. Participants may respond according to assumed desires of the experimenter or make\ncold judgements based on some available visual variable, in the absence of any emotional response\nto the stimuli. We avoided these issues by measuring preferences using an Implicit Association Test\n(IAT, Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998; Nosek, Greenwald, & Banaji, 2007). The IAT involves\nparticipants classifying items by pressing one of two buttons. On some trials participants saw pat-\nterns like those in Figure 1 and had to classify them as reflection or translation. On interleaved trials,\nparticipants saw words and had to classify them as positive or negative. In the compatible blocks of\ntrials, the same button was used to report a reflection pattern or a positive word, and another button\nwas used to report a translation pattern or a negative word. In incompatible blocks, the response map-\nping was reversed (button 1 for translation or positive, button 2 for reflection or negative, see Table 1).\nThe crucial metric is the mean response time in the compatible blocks compared to mean response\ntime in the incompatible blocks. Faster response times in the compatible blocks than the incompatible\nblocks indicates that the association between reflection patterns and positive words and the association\nbetween translation patterns and negative words are stronger than the opposite pair of associations\n(reflection and negative, translation and positive). The experiment is not based on the assumption that\nFigure 1. Examples of reflection and translation in the One- and Two-objects experiments. (a) Reflection One-\nobject. (b) Translation One-object. (c) Reflection Two-objects. (d) Translation Two-objects.\nSubjective regularity and implicit preference 521\nreflection patterns are positive and translation patterns are negative in absolute terms (some observers\nmay perceive translation as positive in a different context). Instead, our IAT is a tool for measuring\nrelative implicit preference.\nIn previous work we reported implicit preference for reflection over translation using the IAT\n(Makin, Pecchinenda, & Bertamini, 2012), but in this study, we focus on the role of grouping. Par-\nticipants completed two IAT experiments, one where reflection and translation were properties of a\nsingle object (Figure 1a and b) and one where the same type of contours formed two separate objects\n(Figure 1c and d). Note that the closure of the contours was not task-relevant, as is typical for the study\nof effect of closure on perception of symmetry. We predicted that preference for reflection would be\nattenuated in the Two-objects version of the experiment, in line with the perceptual differences.\nAlthough we have cited some problems with overt aesthetic judgements, we nevertheless com-\npared the IAT results to explicit preference scores obtained from another sample of participants. Ex-\nplicit ratings were obtained for reflection and translation patterns in one and two-object conditions.\nThis is informative because implicit and explicit preferences are not always matched: Indeed, Makin\net al. (2012) documented cases were IAT and explicit ratings were in agreement, but also cases where\nopposite implicit and explicit preference patterns were found.\nForty participants from the University of Liverpool took part in the IAT experiment (age, 18\u00ad41, mean\nage, 23, 9 male, 2 left-handed). All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Some participants were\nrewarded with course credit, and all were naive with regard to the experimental hypothesis. The ex-\nperiment had local ethics committee approval and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration\nof Helsinki (revised 2008). Another 40 participants filled in the explicit ratings questionnaire (age,\nParticipants sat in a darkened room approximately 57 cm from a 120-Hz CRT Sony Trinitron monitor.\nA program written in C++ and OpenGL controlled the experiment. Participants entered responses us-\ning the left (`z') and right (`/') keys of the keyboard. Stimuli were generated using a random walk al-\ngorithm dictating the inwards and outwards turns of a vertical line. There were 10 changes in direction\n(see Figure 1). The height contours and the objects were approximately to 5\u00b0 angle of visual angle. The\nreference horizontal distance between the contours was 3.18\u00b0 angle. From this reference, the vertices\nof the convexities and concavities of each contour were displaced by a value between 0.91\u00b0 angle\nand 0.91\u00b0 angle. The appearance of two objects was created with a rectangular closed contour, and the\ntotal width of the Two-objects stimulus was 9.1\u00b0 angle.\nTable 1. The order of blocks and response mappings in the IAT experiment. For half the participants, incompat-\nible blocks were presented first, and training blocks were rearranged accordingly. Participants ran through the\nprocedure twice, once with One-object stimuli and once with Two-object stimuli\nBlock Block type Left button Right button\n1 Training Reflection pattern Translation pattern\n2 Training Positive word Negative word\n3 Compatible Reflection or positive word Translation or negative word\n4 Compatible Reflection or positive word Translation or negative word\n5 Compatible Reflection or positive word Translation or negative word\n6 Training Translation pattern Reflection pattern\n7 Training Translation pattern Reflection pattern\n8 Incompatible Translation or positive word Reflection or negative word\n9 Incompatible Translation or positive word Reflection or negative word\n10 Incompatible Translation or positive word Reflection or negative word\n522 Makin A, Pecchinenda A, Bertamini M\nWords were selected from the ANEW database (Bradley & Lang, 1999) and were identical to\nthose used by Makin et al. (2012). There were 10 positive words (HEAVEN, LOYAL, FREEDOM,\nDEATH). The words differed significantly in term of valence but were matched for frequency and\narousal (see Makin et al., 2012, for additional statistical details).\nThe procedure was typical of IAT experiments (Nosek et al., 2007). A single IAT session comprised 10\nblocks of 20 trials (Table 1). These blocks were not always presented in the same order. For half the\nparticipants, the order was as follows: In the first block, participants saw reflection or translation pat-\nterns, and they pressed the left button for reflection, and the right button for translation. In the second\nblock, the positive and negative words were presented, and participants responded with left button for\npositive and right button for negative. Next, there were three blocks of experimental trials. In these\ncompatible blocks, patterns (reflection or translation) and words (positive or negative) were presented\nin alternate trials. The left button was used to report reflection or positive words, while the right button\nwas used to report translation patterns or negative words. Next, two more training blocks were pre-\nsented that included only reflection or translation patterns. Here, the response mapping was reversed,\nparticipants learned to use the left button to report translation patterns, and the right key to report reflec-\ntion. There were then another three blocks of incompatible experimental trials (left button for transla-\ntion or positive, right button for reflection or negative). For the other 20 participants, the incompatible\nblock was presented first and the training blocks were rearranged accordingly. Participants completed\ntwo IAT experiments. In the One-object experiment, stimuli were composed of a single central item. In\nthe Two-objects experiment, stimuli were composed of two objects with either a reflected or translated\nabutting contour (Figure 1). The order in which the experiments were completed was counterbalanced\nwith other factors.\nEach trial began with a fixation cross, which was present for 1,000 ms. The word or pattern then\nappeared and remained on the screen until participants pressed the button. Cue words were presented\non the left and right sides of the screen to indicate the response mapping. For example, when a pattern\nappeared in the first training block, the cues \"reflection\" and \"translation\" were presented, whereas\nwhen a word appeared in the second training block, the cues \"positive\" and \"negative\" were presented.\nIn the compatible blocks, the cue word on the left read \"reflection or positive\" and the cue word on the\nright read \"translation or negative\". Conversely, in the incompatible blocks, the cue words read \"trans-\nlation or positive\" and \"reflection or negative\". Incorrect responses were signalled with the message\n\"WRONG\". Participants were instructed to make accurate responses as quickly as possible.\nExplicit preference ratings for the same pattern types were obtained from a group of 40 new par-\nticipants. Patterns were rated on a Likert scale [3 (very ugly) to 13 (very beautiful), with zero as\nneutral]. Participants rated 10 examples of each of the four pattern types (Reflection, Translation \nOne-object Two-objects). These were generated in the same way as the images used in the IAT.\nTrials were excluded from all analysis if participants pressed the wrong button, or if reaction time\nwas 10 s (standard in the IAT literature, Nosek et al., 2007). Approximately 5% of the trials were\nexcluded in total. Preference for reflection over translation was defined as faster mean response times\nin the compatible than incompatible blocks. However, following the conventions of the IAT literature,\nwe normalized this reaction time difference by dividing it by the SD of response times in all experi-\nmental blocks to give a D score (Nosek et al., 2007). Positive D scores indicate an association between\nreflection and positive words and between translation and negative words. We take this as a measure\nof implicit preference for reflection over translation. D scores were compared to zero using one-sample\nt tests (significant effects indicating a preference for reflection over translation), and in the One- and\nTwo-objects experiments using paired sample t tests (significant effects indicating greater reflection\npreference in either the One- or Two-object experiments).\nEach participant completed two IAT experiments designed to measure preference for reflection over\ntranslation. In the One-object experiment, the contours that were either reflected or translated were\nSubjective regularity and implicit preference 523\nconnected to form a single object, while in the Two-objects experiment, the same contours were\nconnected to form two objects (Figure 1). We predicted that preference for reflection would be reduced\nin the Two-objects experiment.\nResults are shown in Figure 2a. It can be seen that in both the One- and Two-objects experiments,\nD was greater than zero, indicating an implicit preference for reflection, t (39)  3.668, p  .002. As\npredicted, this implicit preference for reflection was significantly greater in the One-object experiment\nIt was likely that the order in which participants completed the experiments (One-object first,\nTwo-objects first) would have a nontrivial effect on implicit preference. The results for these two\ngroups of participants are shown separately in Figure 2b, and this pattern was explored further with\nplanned t tests. The group of participants who completed the One-object experiment first showed a\nwas little difference for the group who completed the Two-objects experiment first, t (19)  1, N.S1,2.\nIn some of the training blocks, participants discriminated between reflection and translation pat-\nterns, without the presentation of words in interleaved trials (Table 1). Previous work suggests that the\ndetection speed advantage for reflectional symmetry should be larger in the One-object experiment\nthan in the Two-objects experiment. To facilitate comparison with preference, we computed detection\nspeed difference between the reflection and translation trials and divided this score by SD in all trials.\nPositive scores indicate that people were quicker to respond to reflection than translation. Overall, the\nadvantage for reflection was larger in the One-object experiment than in the Two-objects experiment,\nthe results were broken down by Experiment Order, we found a significant effect in the group who\nthe Two-objects experiment first, t (19)  1 N.S, Figure 2d. This parallels the implicit preference data\nfrom the same participants.\nExplicit ratings were obtained for the same four pattern types (Reflection, Translation)  (One-\nobject, Two-objects) from another group of 40 participants. In both One- and Two-object conditions,\nreflection was preferred to translation, t (39)  6.485, p  .001. However, reflection preference was\n1The IAT analysis was ultimately based on the mean response times in the compatible and incompatible blocks,\nwhere the means included response times to the words and images. It is informative, although unconventional,\nto break down the results further: We analysed response times to the words and images separately. The response\ntimes to the images were analysed as a function of three within-subjects factors [Response mapping, (compatible,\nincompatible)  Regularity (reflection, translation)  Object number (One-object, Two-objects)], and a between-\nsubjects factor [Experiment order (One-object first, Two-objects first)] with mixed ANOVA.

There was also\na significant interaction between Response mapping, Object number and Experiment order, F (1, 38) 5 8.672,\np 5 .005. This interaction is actually another manifestation of the pattern in Figure 1b, although it was obtained\nfrom responses to the images only. The pattern can be described as follows: the group of participants who did the\nOne-object experiment first had reduced compatibility advantage in the Two-object experiment, while the group\nwho did the Two-object experiment first had comparable compatibility advantage in the One- and Two-objects\nexperiments. The response times to words were analysed in the same way, with the factor Valence (positive,\nnegative) in place of Regularity.

The significant interactions were between Object number and Experiment order,\nResponse mapping and Object number and a three-way interaction between Response mapping, Object number\nand Experiment order, F (1, 38)  4.985, p  .033). Again the three-way interaction is another manifestation of\nthe results in Figure 1b, although it reflects response times to words only.\n2We analysed error rates as a function of the within-subjects factors Response mapping (compatible, incompatible)\nand Object number (One object, Two-objects) and the between-subjects factor Experiment order (One-object first,\nTwo-objects first) with mixed methods ANOVA. As expected, participants made fewer errors in the compatible\n524 Makin A, Pecchinenda A, Bertamini M\npreference data are similar to the of implicit preferences measure by the IAT.\n4 Discussion\nWe used the IAT to investigate implicit preference for reflection over translation. In all conditions,\nparticipants were quicker to respond when the same button was used for reflection patterns and posi-\ntive words than when the response mapping was reversed. We interpret this as a measure of implicit\npreference for reflection (Nosek et al., 2007). This preference for reflection over translation replicates\none of the IAT experiments reported by Makin et al. (2012). The novel finding in the current work\nwas that grouping modulated the magnitude of the implicit preference: more specifically, reflection\npreference was significantly greater when the contours were closed to form a single object than when\nthey were part of two spatially separated objects. Some previous studies have found that reflection is\nmore fluently processed than translation within a single object, but that this difference is attenuated\nor sometimes reversed in two-object conditions (Baylis & Driver, 1995; Bertamini, 2010; Bertamini\nfact that the same visual factors affect preference scores highlights the close relationship between\nperceptual salience and preference.\nThis result is consistent with the fluency hypothesis, which states that the fluency of perceptual\nor cognitive processing is an important mediator of aesthetic responses (Reber et al., 2004). While\na link between perceptual fluency and preference has been reported in the literature, most work has\nused explicit ratings, and it is difficult to know whether these results generalize to preferences formed\nspontaneously, that is, in the absence of any requirement to make a decision about the relative merits\nof the stimuli (Hofel & Jacobsen, 2007). The IAT therefore has certain advantages over other protocols\nmore commonly used in empirical aesthetics (Mastandrea, Bartoli, & Carrus, 2011).\nFigure 2.

(b) The preference scores in (a), shown for the group of\npeople that did the One-object experiment first, and the group who did the Two-objects experiment first. Note that\nin all conditions, D was greater than zero, indicating ubiquitous preference for reflection over translation, however\nthe size of this preference is modulated by number of objects and experiment order. (c) Normalized reaction\ntime differences from the training blocks of the One- and Two-objects experiments. Positive values indicate\nfaster reaction to reflection patterns than translation patterns. (d) The data from (c) are shown for the groups who\ncompleted the One- or Two-objects experiments first. All error bars 5 \u00b11 SEM.\nSubjective regularity and implicit preference 525\nThere was one important caveat to our IAT results: The effect of number of objects on implicit\npreference was greater for the group of participants who completed the One-object experiment first.\nMoreover, detection speed during training blocks was subject to similar order effects. Although we did\nnot predict these order effects, the fact that prior experience had a common effect on both detection\nspeed and implicit preference indicates a close relationship between these variables (see Watson &\nKramer, 1999, for further analysis of past history effects in object-based attention).\nSome readers would have noticed that the effects on detection speed were measured in training\nblocks, while effects on preference were measured in blocks of compatible and incompatible response\nmappings (Table 1). Moreover, when the response times to the images in these blocks were analysed in\nisolation, there was no detection speed differences between reflection and translation, and no interac-\ntion between regularity type and number of objects, that is, the results usually reported in the literature\n(see footnote 1). This seems to imply (problematically) that the fluency differences that putatively\ngive rise to relative preferences do not manifest in the crucial blocks. However, response times in\nthese blocks provide a poor measure of detection speed because the same keys are used to report word\nvalence on interleaved trials. Therefore, we are not surprised that detection speed differences between\nreflection and translation are not apparent here.\nMakin et al. (2012) discussed various issues with the IAT methodology, but there is one issue that\nrequires further consideration: Would participants like the fluently processed patterns if this did not\nentail good performance in a speeded task? Put another way, people may like perceptual ease itself, or\nthey may like the fact it allows them to perform the task well. The IAT cannot discriminate these pos-\nsibilities. Nevertheless, good performance cannot explain the explicit preference ratings we obtained\nfrom a new group of 40 participants, which were similar to the implicit preferences measured by IAT.\nWe therefore favour the theory that perceptual fluency produces a positive attitude to the patterns,\nwhich can be measured with implicit or explicit techniques (best used together to obtain converging\nevidence).\nIt is worth considering the perceptual literature in more detail here. The One-object advantage for\nreflection could be due to a more general process whereby spatial attention is drawn to single objects,\nwhile some other perceptual influence may counteract this ubiquitous effect during translation detec-\ntion. One possibility is that translation is discovered through a lock and key matching process, akin\nto mental object rotation, where translated contours are mentally shifted until they overlap (Baylis &\nDriver, 1995; Bertamini et al., 1997)? Some participants report consciously using the lock and key\nstrategy, although in a study that looked at this the awareness of this strategy was not linked to better\nperformance (Bertamini et al., 2002). However, there are problems with the lock and key hypothesis.\nKoning and Wagemans (2009) presented two-object regularities and reported that translation patterns\nare still more quickly detected than reflection, even when the task-relevant contours in question were\non the outside face of the patterns, and the internal, facing contours were not translational, making\nlock and key matching difficult. Following their structural coding account, these authors argued that\nthe one- and two-object displays are suited to different regularities because reflection typically signals\nthe presence of one object and translation signals presence of two objects in real-life environments.\nConsideration of the example stimuli in Figure 1 reveals another factor: For reflection, whenever there\nis a convexity on one side, there is a convexity on the other. Contour polarity is positively correlated\nfor the reflection patterns, and the visual system uses this cue. For translation, there is a negative cor-\nrelation between the contours (convexity on one side is matched with concavity on the other), mak-\ning them the opposite of reflection. This feature may make the translation regularity more difficult to\ndetect. However, the disadvantage is attenuated when the translation spans two objects (Bertamini et\nal., 2002). The relative strength of these factors and their interactions remain unresolved (Bertamini,\n2010), but what is crucial for the current study is that whatever accounts for detection speed differ-\nences also accounts for implicit preferences.\n5 Conclusion\nThis study tested a single hypothesis, based on the idea that the visual system's sensitivity to regularity\nis directly linked to human preference formation. A specific implementation of this idea is provided\nby the fluency account of aesthetics. Any variable that influences detection speed should also influence\nimplicit preference. We measured implicit preferences for reflection and translation using the IAT. It is\nknown that reflection is more quickly detected than translation, but that this effect is reduced when the\ncontours are closed to form two separate objects. We found exactly the same interaction between type\n526 Makin A, Pecchinenda A, Bertamini M\nof regularity and number of objects on implicit preference. A separate study found the same pattern\nof preferences using an overt ratings procedure, that is, an explicit judgement. This provides evidence\nthat the IAT is sensitive to changes in preference produced by relative perceptual saliency and not just\npreferences produced by good performance.\n"
