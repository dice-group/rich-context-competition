A distinctive feature of the evolutionary view is the assumption of a\nsex-specific evolved jealousy mechanism (EJM) because different infidelity types have\nrecurrently threatened male and female reproductive success. Specifically, a woman's\nsexual infidelity deprives her mate of a reproductive opportunity and may burden him with\nyears of investment in a genetically unrelated child. In contrast, a man's sexual infidelity\ndoes not burden his mate with unrelated children, but he may divert resources from his\nmate's progeny if he develops a deep emotional attachment to another woman. As a\nconsequence, the evolutionary view of jealousy predicts between-sex differences such that\nmen should be more concerned than women about a mate's sexual infidelity, whereas,\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nconversely, women should be more concerned than men about a mate's emotional\ninfidelity.\nThe prediction of between-sex differences in jealousy generated an impressive body\nof research during the past 15 years that has been mainly devoted to testing the hypothesis\nthat men respond with stronger negative emotions than women to a mate's sexual infidelity\nwhereas women respond with stronger negative emotions than men to a mate's emotional\ninfidelity. This hypothesis was primarily tested by men's and women's self-reports about\ntheir jealousy response elicited by a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity. Two response\nformats have been used to assess these self-reports. In the most widely used response\nformat men and women are forced to decide whether a mate's sexual or emotional\ninfidelity generates more intense jealousy feelings (e.g., Buss, Larsen, Westen, and\nLaird, Stevens, and Thompson, 2002; Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle, and Millevoi,\n2003; Wiederman and Kendall, 1999). Across different cultures, women consistently chose\nemotional infidelity significantly more frequently than men in this forced-choice response\nformat (for reviews see Penke and Asendorpf, in press; Harris, 2003).\nIn contrast to the robust sex differences found with the forced-choice response\nformat, continuous ratings of the intensity of negative emotional responses elicited by\nemotional and sexual infidelity have yielded less consistent results (Harris, 2003; Sagarin,\nand Edlund, Heider, Scherer, Farc, and Sagarin (2006) reported the interaction between sex\nand infidelity type predicted by the evolutionary view of jealousy with respect to a mate's\nhypothetical infidelity. In contrast, DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey (2002;\nStudy 1) using multiple continuous response formats consistently found that both men and\nwomen reported more intense negative emotions in response to a mate's hypothetical\nsexual infidelity. Similarly, Sabini and Green (2004, 2006) reported that both men and\nwomen rated the emotional impact of sexual infidelity greater than the import of emotional\ninfidelity for being upset, angry and hurt. However, a peculiarity of the Sabini and Green\n(2004) study is that their participants had to first rate how blameworthy the partner was for\nhis (her) sexual or emotional infidelity, respectively. As the authors convincingly argue, a\npartner is to blame for an action for which he or she is responsible (like having sexual\nintercourse with another person), but not for an emotion that comes upon us unbidden (like\nfalling in love with another person; see also Weiner, 1995). Thus, ratings of\nblameworthiness might have set an anchor for the immediately following ratings of upset,\nangry and hurt. Interestingly, however, explicit ratings of jealousy (Sabini and Green, 2004;\nStudy 3) marginally produced the interaction between sex and infidelity type predicted by\nthe evolutionary view. Moreover, Edlund et al. (2006) point out that these failures to\nsupport the evolutionary view of jealousy might be attributable to a ceiling effect because\nthese studies were using only a seven-point rating scale labeled 1 (not at all) and 7 (very),\nthus artificially narrowing the participants' response options.\nThis lack of correspondence between the findings obtained with the forced-choice\nresponse format and the continuous ratings of emotional intensity led DeSteno et al. (2002)\nto question the validity of the empirical support for the evolutionary view of sex differences\nin jealousy. These authors argue that this support predominantly derives from a single\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nmethodology, the forced-choice response format. As DeSteno et al. (2002) note, the\nlimitation to a single methodology always carries the risk of dealing with an artifact of\nmeasurement. This possible limitation, \"takes on greater weight when one considers that\nthe use of a forced-choice response format ... is known to induce different and more\neffortful decision strategies in the production of preference judgments\" (DeSteno et al.,\n2002, p. 1105). As a consequence, \"the previous findings used to support the evolutionary\nview might not represent differential jealousy resulting from sex-specific evolved modules,\nbut a methodological artifact resulting from a specific and effortful decision strategy\nDeSteno et al. (2002) proposed three assumptions that in combination try to\npartially reconcile the diverging results obtained with the two response formats. (1) Men\nand women actually share the same default distress response that is greater towards sexual\nthan emotional infidelity. (2) Continuous ratings invariably elicit rather simple decision\nstrategies which revert to this default distress response towards sexual infidelity. (3) The\nforced-choice response format invariably generates deliberate and effortful considerations\nof the possible trade-offs of the two events which asymmetrically affect men's and\nwomen's decisions: The output of these trade-off considerations does not affect men's final\ndecision as most men continue insisting on their default distress response towards sexual\ninfidelity. In complete contrast, the same trade-off considerations have a profound impact\non women's choices as the vast majority of women uses the output of these considerations\nto override their default distress response. As a consequence, most women now claim that\nemotional infidelity generates more intense jealousy feelings. This presumed asymmetry in\nthe influence of the deliberate and effortful trade-off considerations on men's and women's\nresponses is finally made responsible for a method-specific sex difference in jealousy\nobtained with the forced-choice response format. Note, however, that DeSteno et al.'s\nassumption predict within-sex differences for both simple decision strategies (i.e., both men\nand women share the same default distress response that is greater towards sexual than\nemotional infidelity) as well as deliberate and effortful decision strategies (i.e., men report\ngreater distress about sexual than emotional infidelity, whereas women report more distress\nabout emotional than sexual infidelity). In contrast, the evolutionary view of jealousy\npredicts between-sex differences in response to sexual and emotional infidelity.\nDeSteno et al. (2002) partially tested their assumptions in two studies. In Study 1,\nthey demonstrated the divergence between forced-choice and continuous scale response\nformats: Whereas the forced-choice response format yielded the sex-differences in jealousy\npredicted by the evolutionary view, no sex differences were found on various continuous\njealousy measures. Moreover, both men and women reported greater negative emotions in\nresponse to sexual infidelity on the continuous ratings. In Study 2, the participants made\ntheir judgments in the forced-choice response format under two different conditions. In the\ndeliberate and effortful decision condition, the participants were urged to consider carefully\ntheir response before choosing between sexual and emotional infidelity. In the automatic\n(simple) condition, the deliberate and effortful decision processes were supposedly\nsuppressed by a cognitive load in terms of a digit-string memory task imposed on the\nparticipants while choosing between the two response alternatives, thus forcing the\nparticipants to make their choice using simple decision processes. The deliberate and\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\neffortful condition yielded the well-known sex difference inasmuch as 96% of the men but\nonly 36% of the women selected sexual jealousy. In contrast, in the automatic condition,\nthe majority of not only the men but also of the women chose sexual infidelity (92% and\n65%, respectively). Based on this finding, DeSteno et al. (2002) assume that both men and\nwomen using automatic decision strategies rely on the same initial response tendency\ntowards sexual infidelity. In contrast, deliberate and effortful decision strategies\nasymmetrically affect men's and women's responses: Men, in accordance with their initial\nresponse tendency, still consider sexual infidelity as eliciting stronger jealousy. Women, in\ncontrast, abandon their initial response tendency and now claim that emotional infidelity\ngenerates more intense jealousy. Note, however, that contrary to DeSteno et al.'s (2002)\nclaim that \"the sex difference on the forced-choice measure disappeared under conditions\nof cognitive constraint,\" (p. 1103) which has been repeated by DeSteno, Bartlett, and\nreanalysis of their data shows that the sex difference in the cognitive load condition was\nmerely attenuated but did not completely disappear as still significantly more women than\n2005). Moreover, the cognitive load study has been criticized both on theoretical (Barrett,\nFrederick, Haselton, and Kurzban, 2006) and methodological grounds (Sch\u00fctzwohl, in\npress a; see also Penke and Asendorpf, in press). The purpose of the following two studies\nwas to further examine DeSteno et al.'s predictions of within-sex differences in jealousy\nand to contrast them with the predictions of between sex-differences derived from the\nevolutionary view with respect to continuous ratings of jealousy.\nIn the standard forced-choice response format (e.g., Buss et al., 1992), the\nparticipants are requested to decide whether a mate's sexual or emotional infidelity\ngenerates comparatively more intense jealousy feelings. In the continuous rating format,\nthe participants are typically asked to rate the intensity of the emotional reactions elicited\nby a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity, respectively (e.g., DeSteno et al., 2002;\nIn the present study, in contrast, the participants indicated on continuous ratings\nscales the extent to which a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity contributes to their\njealousy feeling. This task appears to more closely capture the comparative nature of the\noriginal forced-choice response format than the typical intensity ratings described above.\nHowever, at the same time the present task shares an important feature with the typical\nintensity ratings because the participants are not forced to differentiate between the two\ninfidelity types. This feature allows the participants the use of simple decision strategies.\nAccordingly, if continuous rating scales invariably elicit simple decision strategies as\nsuggested by DeSteno et al. (2002), both men and women should indicate that sexual\ninfidelity contributes more to the jealousy feeling than emotional infidelity because these\nsimple decision strategies revert to the same within-sex default distress response towards\nsexual infidelity. If, however, the sex differences predicted by the evolutionary view of\njealousy are robust and not method specific, between-sex differences should emerge such\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nthat emotional infidelity contributes more to women's than men's jealousy, whereas,\nconversely, sexual infidelity contributes more to men's than women's jealousy. In sum,\nwhereas the assumptions of DeSteno et al. predict only a main effect for infidelity type,\nsupport for the evolutionary view would require an interaction between sex and infidelity\ntype.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants were 101 female and 98 male students of various disciplines at the\nUniversities of Bielefeld and Osnabr\u00fcck. Their age ranged from 19 to 41 years (M = 24.5\nyears; SD = 4.0). They were not paid for their voluntary participation.\nMaterials\nIn this paper and pencil study, the participants were first instructed to think of a\ncommitted romantic relationship that they had had in the past, that they were currently\nhaving, or that they would like to have. They were then asked to imagine that they\ndiscover that their partner formed both a deep emotional as well as a passionate sexual\nrelationship with another person. Next they were requested to rate the extent to which the\nemotional and sexual aspect of their partner's infidelity contributed to their jealousy\nreaction on separate rating scales. The seven verbal labels of the two ratings scales ranged\nfrom emotional (sexual) infidelity contributed (from left to right) \"not at all\"; \"barely\";\n\"somewhat\"; \"pretty much\"; \"quite a lot\"; \"very much\"; to \"exclusively\" to their jealousy.\nProcedure\nThe participants were tested individually at various locations in the University\nbuildings where they were approached by the female experimenter. To enhance the\nanonymity of the study, the participants were requested to fold the questionnaire\nimmediately after its completion and to drop it into an opaque box.\nResults\nThe rated contribution of emotional and sexual infidelity to the jealousy reaction\nwas subjected to a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with sex as the between-\nsubjects factor and rating of infidelity type (sexual vs. emotional) as the within-subjects\nfactor. For this purpose, the respective ratings were assigned values from 1 (contributed not\nat all) to 7 (contributed exclusively). The ANOVA yielded a marginally significant main\nassumptions of DeSteno et al. (2002), emotional infidelity was rated to contribute\nsomewhat more to the jealousy reaction than sexual infidelity (5.41 vs. 5.21). More\nimportantly, however, the interaction predicted by the evolutionary view turned out to be\nthat women rated the contribution of emotional infidelity significantly higher than that of\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nfor the contribution of sexual and emotional infidelity did not significantly differ (5.23 vs.\n5.15), t(97) < 1, d = .06. Between-sex comparisons revealed that women reported that\nemotional infidelity contributed more to their jealousy reaction than men (5.65 vs. 5.15),\nTable 1. The percentage of women and men who provided the same ratings for emotional\nand sexual infidelity (e = s); who rated emotional infidelity higher than sexual infidelity (e\n> s); and who rated sexual infidelity higher than emotional infidelity (s > e) in Study 1.\nIn a second analysis step, the individual ratings were pigeonholed in one of three\ncategories: emotional and sexual infidelity contribute equally to the jealousy reaction;\nemotional infidelity contributes more than sexual infidelity; and sexual infidelity\ncontributes more than emotional infidelity. The percentage of men and women assigned to\nthe three categories are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, an almost equal\npercentage of women and men did not differentiate between the contributions of the two\ninfidelity types (41% vs. 40%). However, more women than men (40% vs. 24%) indicated\nthat emotional infidelity contributed more to their jealousy reaction, whereas conversely\nmore men than women (36% vs. 19%) reported that sexual infidelity contributed more, 2 =\nDiscussion\nA considerable proportion of men and women did not differentiate between the\ncontribution of sexual and emotional infidelity to their jealousy feeling. This lack of\ndifferentiation in both men and women presumably indicates that the continuous rating\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nscales indeed activated simple decision strategies regardless of the participants' sex.\nDespite this evidence that the present task encouraged the use of simple decision strategies,\nDeSteno et al.'s prediction that this strategy should result in both men and women reporting\nmore jealousy in response to sexual than emotional infidelity could not be confirmed.\nFurthermore, both within-sex comparisons yielded results at variance with their\npredictions: Women rated emotional infidelity as contributing significantly more to their\njealousy feeling than sexual infidelity and men's ratings did not differentiate between the\ntwo infidelity types. In contrast the evolutionary view was partially supported inasmuch\nthat women rated the contribution of emotional infidelity higher than men but no between-\nsex differences were found for the contribution of sexual infidelity. Moreover, the\ncategorical analysis of the ratings revealed results in agreement with the evolutionary view\nsince more men than women provided higher ratings for the contribution of sexual\ninfidelity, whereas conversely more women than men provided higher ratings for the\ncontribution of emotional infidelity.\nAn obvious limitation of the present study is that the contribution measures are non-\nparticipants who rated that at least one infidelity type contributed exclusively to their\njealousy reaction while the other infidelity type contributed at least barely to their jealousy\nreaction. A reanalysis of the data after excluding those participants yielded virtually\nidentical results. One might further object that in the present study some participants might\nhave used simple decision strategies (i.e., those who did not differentiate between the two\ninfidelity types as well as perhaps those rating sexual infidelity as contributing more to\ntheir jealousy feelings), whereas others might have used more deliberate and effortful\ndecision strategies (i.e., those rating emotional infidelity as contributing more to their\njealousy feelings). This objection cannot be entirely refuted. Note, however, that this\nobjection implies that the use of continuous rating scales does not invariably induce simple\ndecision strategies as tacitly presumed by DeSteno et al. (2002). Moreover, in order to\nconsider this objection viable one would have to additionally explain why especially\nwomen and to a lesser degree men used deliberate and effortful and effortful decision\nstrategies when answering continuous rating scales. However, this objection nurtures on\npost hoc speculations because the decision strategies in Study 1 were not experimentally\ncontrolled. The purpose of Study 2 was to remedy this shortcoming.\nStudy 2 compared continuous ratings of jealousy elicited by sexual and emotional\ninfidelity based on either simple or deliberate and effortful decision strategies. The\nparticipants instructed to employ simple decision strategies were requested to make their\nratings as spontaneously as possible and without extensive considerations. In contrast, the\nparticipants instructed to use deliberate and effortful decision strategies were asked to make\ntheir ratings only after careful considerations and to take their time. According to DeSteno\net al. (2002), \"a clear dissociation will be found ... between judgments produced under\ndifferent levels of cognitive elaboration\" (p. 1105). As a consequence, based on DeSteno et\nal.'s assumption of a shared default distress response, both men and women in the\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nspontaneous condition should report higher jealousy ratings in response to sexual than\nemotional infidelity. Conversely, in the deliberate and effortful condition women, but not\nmen, should provide higher jealousy ratings in response to emotional than sexual infidelity\ndue to the asymmetrical impact of the deliberate and effortful decision process on women's\nbut not men's ratings. If, however, the sex differences are robust and not limited to the\nforced-choice response format, the between-sex differences predicted by the evolutionary\nview should emerge regardless of the decision strategy. In sum, whereas support for the\nevolutionary view requires a two-way interaction between the participants' sex and the\nintensity ratings for sexual and emotional infidelity, the assumptions of DeSteno et al.\n(2002) should be reflected in a three-way interaction between sex, type of decision strategy\nand the two intensity ratings.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants were 268 female and 222 male undergraduate students of\nintroductory psychology courses at the Universities of Bielefeld and Osnabr\u00fcck. Their age\nparticipation.\nMaterial\nThe participants were first instructed to think of a committed romantic relationship\nthat they had had in the past, that they were currently having, or that they would like to\nhave. They were then informed that they discover that their partner had formed a deep\nemotional as well as a passionate sexual relationship with another person. Next, they were\nasked to indicate the intensity of their jealousy elicited by the imagination of the emotional\nand the sexual aspect of their partner's infidelity. In the spontaneous condition, the\nparticipants were instructed to make their decisions as spontaneously as possible, that is\nwithout extensive considerations. In the deliberate and effortful condition, the participants\nwere instructed to make their decisions only after careful considerations and at their own\npace. In each condition, the sentence containing the respective decision strategy was\npresented in bold font to highlight its importance.\nSubsequently, to counter potential ceiling effects, two 11-point ratings scales were\nprovided for the ratings of the intensity of their jealousy feelings elicited by the two aspects\nof their partner's infidelity. Additionally, the endpoints of the rating scales were anchored\nat 0 (not at all jealous) and 10 (extremely jealous) in order to provide a full range of\nresponse options. The sequence of the two ratings was counterbalanced across sex and\ncondition. Finally, the participants were asked to indicate whether they had already had a\ncommitted romantic relationship.\nProcedure\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nThe participants were tested in groups varying in size. The participants within each\ngroup were assigned to the same condition. The experimenter explicitly stressed the\nimportance of the respective condition before the participants started to answer the\nquestionnaire. To enhance the anonymity of the study, the participants were requested to\nproceed independently and to fold the questionnaire immediately after its completion.\nResults\nThe vast majority of the participants (93%) reported relationship experience. One\nmale participant failed to answer the pertinent question. Because there were only 17 men\nand 16 women without relationship experience, the following analyses are based on the\ndata of the 204 men and 252 women with relationship experience. These analyses were\nrerun including the participants without relationship experience with essentially unchanged\nresults.\nA three-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of the jealousy ratings with\nparticipants' sex and decision strategy (simple vs. deliberate and effortful) as the between-\nsubjects factors and rating of infidelity type (sexual vs. emotional) as the within-subjects\n2 = .045. This main effect is attributable to women providing overall significantly higher\nratings than men (8.81 vs. 8.10). Additionally, the interaction between the infidelity ratings\n.018. The jealousy caused by sexual infidelity was rated as significantly more intense in the\nsimple than in the deliberate and effortful decision strategy condition (8.77 vs. 8.29), t(454)\n= 2.67, p = .008, d = .25. In contrast, the intensity of jealousy elicited by emotional\ninfidelity did not differ between the two decision strategy conditions (8.45 vs. 8.42), t(454)\nMore importantly, however, the interaction between the two infidelity ratings and\nillustrated in Figure 1, within-sex comparisons showed that women reported significantly\nmore intense jealousy in response to a mate's emotional than sexual infidelity (8.99 vs.\nd = .31.

The remaining main and interaction effects also failed to be significant, Fs\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nFigure 1. Men's and women's mean jealousy ratings as a function of infidelity type.\nMen Women\nsexual infidelity\nemotional infidelity\nDiscussion\nStudy 2 tested DeSteno et al.'s (2002) assumption that simple decision strategies\nreveal men's and women's shared default stress response towards sexual infidelity as\ncausing more jealousy, whereas deliberate and effortful decision strategies lead women but\nnot men to override this default stress response. Contrary to these assumptions, women\nreported more intense jealousy in response to emotional infidelity, irrespective of the\ndecision strategy. As in Study 1, the between-sex differences predicted by the evolutionary\nview of jealousy were found for emotional but not for sexual infidelity. One might object\nthat despite the efforts to experimentally control the decision strategies, (some or all of) the\nparticipants did not comply with the instructions. Granted this objection, there are two\npossible alternative scenarios. However, each scenario is problematic for one of DeSteno et\nal.'s (2002) central assumptions. According to the first scenario, the use of ratings scales\nindeed induced simple decision strategies in the participants as proposed by DeSteno et al.,\nirrespective of their instructions. If this were the case, then no sex differences should have\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nbeen found because simple decision strategies supposedly revert to the default distress\nresponse shared by men and women towards sexual infidelity. According to the second\nscenario, the participants employed deliberate and effortful decision strategies. This\nscenario would explain the sex differences but is equally problematic for DeSteno et al.\n(2002) position because it contradicts their assumption that the use of rating scales\ninvariably induces simple decision strategies.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the present findings also highlight that jealousy in\nromantic relationships elicited by a mate's hypothetical sexual or emotional infidelity\ntypically is an extremely intense emotion. In fact, 43% of the men and 28% of the women\ngave the maximal jealousy rating for hypothetical sexual infidelity. With respect to\nhypothetical emotional infidelity, 50% of the women and 45% of the men reported extreme\njealousy. These extreme ratings obviously back up Edlund et al.'s (2006) assumption that\nsome failures to find sex differences in continuous jealousy ratings for sexual and\nemotional infidelity might be attributable to too narrowly defined ratings scales that fail to\ncapture the frequently extreme nature of jealousy feelings in romantic relationships.\nGeneral Discussion\nIn sum, the results of the present experiments revealed no evidence supporting\nDeSteno et al.'s (2002) claim that the sex differences in jealousy predicted by the\nevolutionary view are an artifact of measurement because they are restricted to a forced-\nchoice between emotional and sexual infidelity. By the same token, the present results also\nfailed to support DeSteno et al.'s (2002) assumption that men and women share the same\ninitial tendency towards sexual infidelity as that infidelity type generating more jealousy.\nMoreover, both their assumptions and the pertinent empirical support they provided face\nadditional challenges. First, whereas DeSteno et al. (2002; Study 1) found that women\nreported greater jealousy in response to sexual infidelity on the continuous measures,\nseveral studies, in addition to the present one, reported exactly the opposite findings with\nMoreover, although Harris (2002) did not explicitly request ratings of the intensity of\njealousy feelings, she found that both men and women indicated on five-point rating scales\nthat they focused more on the emotional infidelity aspect of one's mates' actual infidelity\n(but see Edlund et al., 2006, who refuted Harris use of the word focus, and Sch\u00fctzwohl,\n2007, for an empirical demonstration of the irrelevance of the focus of jealousy on the\nsexual and emotional aspect of infidelity for the evolutionary view).\nSecond, Sch\u00fctzwohl (2004) provided evidence questioning the adequacy of their\nassumption that the forced-choice response format invariably induces deliberate and\neffortful decision strategies. In this study briefly mentioned earlier, unbeknown to the\nparticipants, decision times were assessed in the standard forced-choice question as an\nindicator of the deliberate- and effortfulness of the pertinent decision processes. It was\nfound that women selecting emotional infidelity made their decision significantly faster\nthan women selecting sexual infidelity. Analogously, men selecting sexual infidelity made\ntheir decision significantly faster than men selecting emotional infidelity. From an\nevolutionary view, these findings suggest that women selecting emotional infidelity and\nDecision strategies in continuous jealousy ratings\nmen selecting sexual infidelity simply relied on their sex-specific initial response tendency\nactivated by the respective jealousy mechanism, whereas both women opting for sexual\ninfidelity and men opting for emotional infidelity needed to engage in more deliberate and\neffortful decision processes to override their initial response tendency. Thus, contrary to\nbasic assumptions of DeSteno et al. (2002), (1) the forced-choice response format\napparently does not invariably induce the same deliberate and effortful decision processes\nin all participants; (2) less effortful decision strategies do not reveal same-sex default\ndistress responses towards sexual infidelity but instead sex-specific initial response\ntendencies for men (sexual infidelity) and women (emotional infidelity); (3) suggesting an\nasymmetry in decision strategies in the forced-choice response format which is not\nassociated with the participants' sex as implied by DeSteno et al. (2002) but which within\neach sex is associated with the final choice (Sch\u00fctzwohl, 2004). Moreover, Sch\u00fctzwohl\n(2005) reported that men were significantly faster than women in deciding whether\ninfidelity cues would elicit either a first pang of jealousy or intolerable jealousy if these\ncues were more diagnostic of sexual jealousy. Conversely, women made these decisions\nsignificantly more rapidly than men for cues more diagnostic of emotional infidelity.\nTogether with the pronounced sex differences in particular in the present no-load condition\nwith time pressure but without distraction, these findings suggest that the sex differences\nobtained with the forced-choice task are due to fast, spontaneous decisions rather than long\ndeliberation (see also Penke and Asendorpf, in press).\nThird, DeSteno et al. (2002) failed to provide any theoretical argument to\nsubstantiate their assumption that men and women share the same initial tendency towards\nsexual infidelity as that infidelity type generating more jealousy. Fourth, in a similar vein,\nthese authors have yet to offer an explanation as to why women but not men should be\naffected in their decisions by the different response formats.\nFinally, the present findings contribute to the accumulating evidence that in rating\nstudies of jealousy reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity, the evolutionary prediction\nof between-sex differences is consistently supported for emotional but not for sexual\ninfidelity (Penke and Asendorpf, in press). One exception to this pattern has been recently\npresented by Sch\u00fctzwohl (in press b) with respect to ratings of relief about the\ndisconfirmation of the prospect of a mate's sexual and emotional infidelity. In two studies,\nmen reported more relief than women about the disconfirmation of the prospect of sexual\ninfidelity. Additionally, women consistently reported more relief about the disconfirmation\nof emotional than of sexual infidelity.
