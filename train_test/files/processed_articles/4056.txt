A separate mouse was used for each\ncorneal foreign body. The corneas of the mice were scanned 24 h later by a laser scanning IVCM to\nestablish the characteristics (shape, reflectivity and depth in the cornea) of each foreign body.\nThese findings were used to help screen and identify corneal foreign bodies in patients. Corneal\nsmears and scraping cultures were performed in cases of probable corneal infection.\nResults: Animal models for the five different foreign particles were established successfully, with\neach showing distinctive characteristics. These animal results were used to diagnose 41 patients\nwith suspected corneal foreign bodies who were negative by slit lamp examination, but positive by\nIVCM (observational case series). The most prevalent type of hidden foreign body was plant\nmaterial (51.2%), followed by metal (29.3%). Ten patients with corneal foreign bodies developed\nfungal keratitis, found using IVCM.\nConclusions: Laser IVCM is an effective and reliable tool for the diagnosis of hidden corneal\nforeign bodies.\n",

The majority of corneal foreign\nbodies are metal scraps, plant fragments and\nstone particles, all of which can be import-\nant vectors of corneal infection.3,4 Large\ncorneal foreign bodies are easily detected\nwith a slit lamp examination, but smaller\ncorneal foreign bodies or corneal foreign\nbodies with infectious keratitis can be diffi-\ncult to detect and diagnose by routine\nexamination, and are termed `hidden cor-\nneal foreign bodies'. In vivo confocal micros-\ncopy (IVCM) combines fast scanning time\nwith high resolution, and has been used for\nthe in vivo study of the anatomic properties\nof the cornea in normal and pathological\nstates, including morphological changes\nThis study consisted of two parts. The\nfirst was the characterization of common\ncorneal foreign bodies in a mouse model by\nHeidelberg Retina Tomograph III (HRT\nIII) and Rostock Cornea Module (RCM)\nIVCM. The same technology was then used\nfor patients presenting with hidden corneal\nforeign bodies in an observation case series\nto detect and identify the foreign bodies, and\nto evaluate the role of laser scanning IVCM\nin their diagnosis.\nMaterials and methods\nDetection of corneal foreign bodies in mice\nTwelve-week-old male Kunming mice\nLaboratory Animal Center of Zhengzhou\nUniversity, China) were used as a mouse\nmodel to identify corneal foreign bodies.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee of Henan Eye Institute and all\nmice were handled in accordance with the\nAssociation for Research in Vision and\nOphthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the\nUse of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision\nResearch.\nMice were anaesthetized with an intra-\nperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium\nsolution (50 mg/kg body weight). So that the\ncharacteristics of the animal model should\nbe as close as possible to clinical cases, spiny\nwood, rusty iron and sharp stones were used\nto scuff the central cornea of the mice before\nthe foreign body was implanted using a\nstereoscopic microscope (SteREO\nDiscovery V8, Carl Zeiss Meditec,\nOberkochen, Germany). The sharp glass\nfragments were implanted directly in the\ncornea, and the human hair fragment was\nimplanted after keratomy using a diamond\nblade for refractive surgery. Five separate\nmice were used for each corneal foreign\nbody. Each animal was evaluated by slit\nlamp examination 24 h later and corneal\nfindings were recorded for analysis. The\ninvestigator (Z. Xu) was responsible for the\nimplantation of material in the mice eyes,\nand L. Wang and X. Yu were responsible for\nthe subsequent examination by slip lamp\nand by IVCM, respectively.\nFive different kinds of corneal foreign\nbody models were established and then\nscanned by a Heidelberg HRT III\u00adRCM\nlaser scanning IVCM (Heidelberg\nEngineering, Heidelberg, Germany),\nequipped with a 670 nm wavelength diode\nlaser. The IVCM was operated by a trained\nprofessional investigator (X.Y.) using the\nsequence scanning mode, which allowed\nimages to be repeatedly acquired at different\nfocus positions, enabling the construction of\na three-dimensional image.9\u00ad11 The scanned\nimages were recorded for analysis.\nDetection of hidden corneal foreign\nbodies in patients\nPatients presenting sequentially at the\nOutpatient Department of the Henan Eye\nInstitute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China\nwith a suspected corneal foreign body, based\nupon their history and examination with a\nslit lamp by at least one cornea specialist,\nwere enrolled in this study. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from each\npatient in accordance with the tenets of the\nDeclaration of Helsinki. The study protocol\nwas approved by The Ethics Committee of\nHenan Eye Institute. Exclusion criteria\nincluded younger patients who were unlikely\nto be able to keep still for the HRT III\u00ad\nRCM examination or those who were\nunwilling to undergo this examination, and\npatients with nystagmus, corneal perfor-\nation or active endophthalmitis.\nClinical examination of each patient\nenrolled in this study included predisposing\nrisk factors, detailed history, slit lamp exam-\nination, clinical photography and examin-\nation with IVCM. Scanning was carried out\nto identify different kinds of hidden corneal\nforeign bodies: identification was based on\nthe characteristics of the corneal foreign\nbodies in the animal model. Corneal smears\nand scraping cultures were performed if the\npatient was suspected of having a corneal\ninfection by a cornea specialist. The corneal\nscrapings were viewed as wet mount prep-\narations using 10% potassium hydroxide\nData analyses\nThe Statistical Package for Social Sciences\n(SPSS\u00d5 version 17.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL,\nUSA) was used for statistical analyses. Age\nwas expressed as mean \u00c6 SD. The data were\nevaluated using independent sample t-tests.\nScanning images were acquired and rec-\n(Heidelberg Engineering GmbH,\nHeidelberg, Germany) and image analysis\nwas performed using Nikon NIS-Elements\nAdvanced Research version 3.2 (Nikon\nCorporation, Tokyo, Japan).\nResults\nIn this study, five different kinds of corneal\nforeign body models were established suc-\ncessfully in mice. Under IVCM, the different\nforeign bodies in mice corneas were detected\nand their appearance noted (Table 1 and\nFigure 1).\nIn total, 537 patients were diagnosed with\ncorneal foreign bodies, based on their his-\ntory and examination with a slit lamp.\nA further 45 patients, who were negative\non slit lamp examination by a corneal\nspecialist (L. Wang), were then examined\nwith HRT III\u00adRCM. The IVCM results\ndiagnosed 41 eyes of 41 patients with hidden\ncorneal foreign bodies; the remaining four\npatients were still undiagnosed after\nexamination.\napproximately equal ratio of right and left\neyes were affected. The patients ranged in\nindependent samples t-test). When the pre-\ndisposing risk factors were analysed, a prior\nincident of trauma to the cornea was\nreported in 39 patients.\nTable 1.

These corneal foreign\nbodies were removed by surgery and the\ncornea lesions healed within several weeks.\nThe characteristics of the removed foreign\nbodies were consisted with the IVCM\nfindings.\nIn this study, 10 patients were diagnosed\nas having corneal foreign bodies and fungal\nkeratitis by IVCM. Although small corneal\ninfiltrations were detected in these\ncases under a slit lamp, corneal foreign\nbodies were not found. Smear microscopy\nshowed hyphae in only two patients, with\nthe other eight cases testing negative.\nBacterial infection was excluded by\nGiemsa staining. Corneal foreign bodies\nand bright hyphae were detected in the\ncorneal lesions of all 10 patients using\nlaser IVCM.\nFigure 1. Representative in vivo confocal microscopy images of foreign bodies in mice cornea: (a) a spiny\nplant foreign body (arrow) was detected at a depth of 24 mm; (b) a piece of iron (arrow) was observed at a\ndepth of 39 mm; (c) highly reflective stone granules (arrows) were located at a depth of 43 mm; (d) highly\nreflective and knife-edged glass foreign body was detected at a depth of 75 mm; (e) reflective hair fragment\n(arrow) was observed at a depth of 63 mm. The scale bar is 50 mm in length.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, 41 patients were diagnosed\nwith corneal foreign bodies by laser scan-\nning IVCM following inconclusive results\nusing a slit lamp. The slit lamp technique\nmay have failed to detect foreign bodies in\nthe cornea of these patients because of the\nsize and the shape of the corneal foreign\nbodies (most likely when a plant corneal\nforeign body is involved), infiltrative corneal\nlesions or other opaque lesions, which can\ncover the corneal foreign body, particularly\ntiny ones, or the presence of corneal foreign\nbodies associated with severe corneal\ninfections.\nAlthough IVCM has been used for clin-\nical applications in ophthalmology for more\nthan 20 years, HRT III\u00adRCM represents a\nstudy, high resolution laser IVCM was\nused to diagnose different kinds of concealed\ncorneal foreign bodies. Results showed that\nglass corneal foreign bodies were more\nhighly reflective than other foreign bodies\nand had a knife-edged appearance. The\nreflection from metal corneal foreign\nbodies was lower than that from glass\nforeign bodies; the metal foreign bodies\nhad sharp edges and were shaped as\ncommon type of hidden corneal foreign\nbody was plant matter, which was seen as\nspiny, exhibited a lower reflectivity than the\nother foreign bodies described and had a\nFigure 2.

When this occurs, the\nvenom and toxins from the bee sting are\ninjected into the cornea and can cause\npathological effects at the ocular surface,\nincluding conjunctive hyperemia, corneal\nretained sting should be removed carefully\nby an ophthalmologist, and any home\nremedies, such as a patient's partner using\na cotton bud to abrade the stinger, should be\navoided, as these may result in bee sting\nsegments within the cornea and continued\ninflammation. Using the laser IVCM to scan\nthe lesions on the cornea in this case revealed\nactivated keratocytes, hydropic keratocytes,\ninflammatory cells and highly reflective par-\nticles which may have been bee sting seg-\nments.26,27 Severe corneal bee stings can lead\nto posterior eye complications, including iris\natrophy, cataract formation, optic neuritis\nThe IVCM images of the corneal foreign\nbody models in the mouse model allowed\nthe identification and diagnosis of 41\npatients with hidden corneal foreign\nbodies. Removal of the foreign bodies\nfrom the patients confirmed the confocal\nfindings \u00ad all hidden corneal foreign bodies\nwere consistent with the scan diagnosis.\nThe clinical symptoms and corneal\nlesions in the four patients for whom a\ncorneal foreign body was not found by\neither slit lamp examination or by IVCM\nwere assumed to be caused by other patho-\ngenic factors. Three patients were success-\nfully treated with anti-inflammatory therapy\nand the fourth was successfully treated with\nantifungal agents.\nIn this study, IVCM led to better man-\nagement of patients by identifying the\ncomposition of the hidden corneal foreign\nbody. Plant and metal corneal foreign bodies\nshould be removed as early as possible to\navoid a serious inflammatory response or a\ncorneal infection; glass foreign bodies always\nhave a sharp edge and can easily penetrate\ninto the anterior chamber of the eye, and so\nshould also be removed as soon as possible.\nIn addition, IVCM can confirm whether a\ncorneal fungal infection is present, and can\nprovide the exact location and quantity of\ncorneal foreign bodies that need to be\nremoved. However, the number of animals\nincluded in the mouse model in our study\nwas small, as was the number of patients:\nanimal models including a greater number of\nmice should be established, and studies with\na greater number of patients should be\ncarried out to confirm our findings.\nThis study shows that IVCM plays an\neffective and reliable role in the diagnosis of\nhidden corneal foreign bodies. We recom-\nmend that IVCM should be used in: patients\nwith a history of incident corneal trauma and\nsuspected corneal foreign body with slit lamp\nexamination; patients with an incident of\ncorneal trauma and nonhealing lesions des-\npite receiving intensive topical antimicroor-\nganism and anti-inflammatory therapy;\npatients with corneal trauma, especially\nplant trauma and clear corneal infiltrations;\npatients undergoing surgical removal of\ncorneal foreign bodies but with a persistent\ninflammatory reaction in the lesion. There\nshould be an increase in the role of IVCM in\ndiagnosing corneal foreign bodies.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to\ndeclare in relation to this article.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
