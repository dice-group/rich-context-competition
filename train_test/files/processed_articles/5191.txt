The\nlack of the skin's protection and the high\nmetabolite rate in burned patients can lower\nbody temperature by disrupting the evapor-\nation and convection that takes place on\nskin.3 Increased heat loss from the skin and\nbody surfaces increases the risk of lowering\nthe core body temperature.\nMultimodal pain therapy has been\nused recently to address postoperative\npain. It involves the use of non-opioid\nanalgesics, opioids, and co-analgesics.4\nOpioids are frequently used to treat pre-\noperative and postoperative pain, although\nwith many severe adverse effects. In con-\ntrast, non-opioids, such as nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can be\nadministered to reduce postoperative pain,\nwith opioid doses given as an adjuvant.4\nParecoxib, the first cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-\n2)-selective agent, can be administered intra-\nvenously or intramuscularly, providing an\nadvantage for patients experiencing post-\noperative nausea and vomiting.4 Unlike\nopioids, it does not influence platelet aggre-\ngation or lead to gastrointestinal ulceration.\nIts few severe side effects include respiratory\ndepression and excessive sedation.4\nProstaglandin E2\n), which plays a\nkey role in thermoregulatory pathways, has\nbeen shown to affect body temperature and\nshivering in animal models. It has also been\nreported that overexpression of COX-2 in the\nmouse brain intensified the febrile response.1\nThus, parecoxib, being a selective COX-2\ninhibitor, may affect perioperative thermo-\nregulation by allowing the body to avoid a\nshivering response. The mechanism of shiver-\ning is unclear. Shivering after general anes-\nthesia may be influenced by low body\ntemperature, although pain and uncomfort-\nable sensations may also be related to post-\noperative shivering.1 Parecoxib transforms\ninto valdecoxib immediately after intramus-\ncular injection, which releases its precise,\npowerful analgesic effects.1 Hence, shivering\nprevention by parecoxib may be related to its\nanalgesic effects.\nMethods\nSearch strategy and trials selection\nThe randomized controlled trials included in\nthis analysis were sought from the following\ndatabases: PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE,\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled\nTrials, China National Knowledge\nInfrastructure Database (CNKI), Google\nScholar, and Web of Science (January 1985\nterms were included in the search: ``pare-\ncoxib'', ``parecoxib sodium'', or ``selective\ncyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor'', and ``shiver''.\nReferences of selected studies were reviewed\nfor additional trials. Publication languages\nwere not limited.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were\nas follows: (1) the comparison was between\nparecoxib and placebo or other drugs in\nregard to shivering after neuraxial anesthe-\nsia and general anesthesia; (2) the research\nobjects were humans of any sex and age; (3)\n4 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)\nthere were no restrictions on dosing regi-\nmens or the route of administration of\nparecoxib; (4) the available outcome data\nwere provided; (5) the experimental group\nwas given parecoxib, and the controlled\ngroup was given saline; (6) the experimental\ngroup was given parecoxib by intravenous\ninjection before anesthesia.\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)\nreports were abstracts, duplicate publica-\ntions, reviews; (2) they did not report specific\nresults of the comparison between parecoxib\nand placebo.\nData extraction and quality assessment\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data\nfrom the included studies. We tabulated the\nstudies and systematically assessed them for\nhomogeneity. If any heterogeneity between\nthe studies did not have justified pooling of\nthe assessed outcome parameters, it was\nsettled by discussion with a third review\nauthor. The two reviewers solved any dis-\nagreement on included studies, quality\nassessment, data extraction, and outcome\nparameters through discussion until total\nagreement was conceded. They recorded\neach study's authors, publication year,\nnumber of patients, intervention measures,\nage and sex of the patients, number of\nwithdrawals, outcome parameters, study\nmethodology, and anesthetic type onto a\ncustomized data extraction form described\nin the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic\nReviews of Interventions. If necessary, we\ncontacted the corresponding authors for\nfurther information.\nThe group allocation was concealed\nby using a random number generator.\nThe results were placed in consecutively\nsealed numbered envelopes by a third party\nnot involved in the trial. Two authors and\na third author independently assessed the\nrisk of bias for each research according\nto the four items of the Oxford scale,\nwhich include the reporting and adequacy\nof randomization (0\u00ad2 points), allocation\nconcealment (0\u00ad1 point), double blinding\n(0\u00ad2 points), and description of dropouts (0\u00ad\n2 points). The items were then summed, with\nthe summary scores varying from 0 to 7.\nFigure 1. Flow chart.\nZhu et al. 5\nStatistical analysis\nThe Cochrane Collaboration's statistical\nsoftware (RevMan 5.0) was used to assess\nthe quantitative data during the statistical\nanalysis. Classification results were assessed\nwith the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence\ninterval (CI). For continuous outcome data,\nthe weighted mean difference or standardized\nmean difference was estimated by means\nand standard deviations. For dichotomous\noutcomes, the Peto OR was estimated.\nTable 1.

In addition, compared with the\nplacebo group, there was no significant\nassociation of parecoxib sodium with alle-\nviation of restlessness or nausea/vomiting.\nIn contrast, however, significantly more\npatients in the control group required peth-\nidine rescue than did those in the parecoxib\nsodium group.\nThis meta-analysis suggested that para-\ncoxib is significantly effective in reducing\npostoperative shivering with fewer side\neffects (e.g., sedation, nausea/vomiting).\nStudies of prophylactic use of paracoxib\nhave been reported.19,20 A feasible mechan-\nism for the effect of paracoxib on shivering\nmay be its inhibition of COX-2 and the\nsynthesis of prostagladins. COX-2 and\nplay important roles in the hypothal-\namus in regard to mediating fever.21 Thus,\nCOX-2 specific inhibitors could lower the\nthreshold of the thermoregulatory system\nlocated in the anterior hypothalamus.\nAccordingly, paracoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor,\nmay affect perioperative thermoregulation\nand shivering.\nThere have been no previously reported\nstudies of prophylactic administration of\nTable 2.
