Several lines of evidence suggest that this positive\nrelationship between body size and social dominance extends to humans. First of all, taller\nmen are more likely to win physical fights as they are physically stronger (Sell et al., 2009),\nhave an enhanced capacity to deliver potentially damaging strikes (Carrier, 2011), and react\nmore aggressively in sports (Webster and Xu, 2011). Additionally, taller men are less\nsensitive to cues of dominance in other men (Watkins et al., 2010) and respond with less\njealousy towards socially and physically dominant rivals than do shorter men (Buunk, Park,\nZurriage, Klavina and Massar, 2008). These findings suggest that it is more important for\nshorter men, as compared to taller men, to accurately gauge a rival's dominance given the\nhigher costs associated with engaging in a fight if a competitor is miscategorized.\nSimilarly, taller men could be (or perceive themselves to be) better able to deter dominant\nrivals, which would reduce the need for jealousy.\nPerceptions of height and dominance are also closely related. Taller men are\nperceived as more dominant than shorter men (Montepare, 1995), and, vice versa, more\ndominant men are estimated as taller than less dominant men (Dannenmaier and Thumin\n1964; Marsh, Yu, Schechter and Blair, 2009). Similarly, the losing candidates in political\nelections are judged as shorter, whereas the winning candidates are judged as taller than\nthey were perceived to be before the election (Higham and Carment, 1992). People also\njudge politicians whom they support as taller than politicians whom they oppose\n(Sorokowski, 2010). Perceptions of height also affect behavior. Huang and colleagues\n(2002), for example, manipulated the camera angle in a negotiation task and found that men\nwho were perceived as taller were more influential in the task than men who were\nperceived as shorter. The positive relationship between size and perceived dominance is\neven apparent in very young children: Thomsen, Frankenhuis and Carey (2011) showed\nthat children as young as ten months old recognize that size plays a role in dominance\ncontests, and are \"surprised\" by (i.e., pay more attention to) a situation in which a smaller\nindividual dominates a larger individual.\nPerhaps because of their increased physical (Sell et al., 2009), behavioral (Watkins\net al., 2010) and/or perceived dominance (Marsh et al., 2009), height is positively related to\naccess to actual resources in humans. This is supported by the findings that taller\nindividuals (particularly men) are more likely to have higher starting salaries (Loh, 1993),\nhigher overall income (Judge and Cable, 2004), and are more likely to be promoted\n(Melamed and Bozionelos, 1992) than shorter men. Not surprisingly therefore, height is\npositively related to authority status. For example, when one's dominance is exercised\nlegitimately, taller individuals are more likely than shorter individuals to occupy a\nleadership or managerial position (Gawley, Perks and Curtis, 2009; Stogdill, 1948). These\nfindings extend to politics, because since 1896, U.S. citizens have always elected a\nPresident whose height was considerably above average (Judge and Cable, 2004).\nMoreover, Presidents whose presidency was considered \"great\" were taller than those\nwhose presidency was considered a \"failure\" (Sommers, 2002). Thus, taller men are more\nlikely to obtain a position of authority, and when they do, are considered more successful.\nGiving the above findings, we hypothesized that male height may also be related to\nauthority in a different setting: professional football (\"soccer\") refereeing. According to the\nHeight increases authority in professional refereeing\nInternational Football Association Board, FIFA, football referees have full authority to\nenforce the laws of the game and can use their body language to show authority and help\ncontrol the match (Laws of the Game; FIFA, 2012). Similarly, the website of the British\nFootball Referees' Association (2010) states that a referee always has to \"keep control [of\nthe game], by bending his authority to encourage the flow of the game\". These\nrecommendations are not surprising, given the fact that referees have to deal with verbal\nand physical aggression not only from players, but also from coaches, and spectators\n(Folkesson, Nyberg, Archer and Norlande, 2002). With almost every blow of the whistle,\nhalf of the players, coaches and crowd are likely to disagree with the referee's decision.\nWe examined whether height was related to authority and authoritative behavior in\nprofessional refereeing. First, we examined whether or not referees were taller than their\nassistants (who merely have an advisory role) in the French professional League (Study 1)\nas well as during the 2010 World Cup that took place in South Africa (Study 2).\nFurthermore, we investigated whether there was an association between referee height and\nauthoritative behavior on the football pitch. A recent study by Van Quaquebeke and\nGiessner (2010) investigated the association between height and dominance in football\nplayers. In this study, taller players were perceived as committing more fouls than shorter\nplayers. We hypothesize that, apart from player height, referee height is also related to\nauthority and dominance on the pitch (Study 3). We predicted that relatively taller referees\nwould be better able to maintain control of the game (i.e. players would be more wary of\ncommitting fouls or retaliating towards other players) and would increase the \"flow of the\ngame\" by having to give fewer fouls (Study 3). Furthermore, we predicted that the\nallocation of referees to matches by the football league is contingent on referee height, with\ntaller referees being appointed to more important matches.\nStudy 1: Ligue 1 (French Professional league) referees\nMaterial and Methods\nThe aim of our first study was to investigate the relationship between height and\nstatus success in professional refereeing. We collected data on assistant referees (n = 64)\nfootball league from the website http://www.worldfootball.net/. One individual acted as\nboth referee and assistant referee during this period; he was classified as a referee in our\nanalyses. We chose the French league because all referee heights and the majority of\nassistant referee heights were available (only five out of 69 heights of assistant referees\nwere missing; for consistency with Study 3, we preferred to have data on the German\nleague (Bundesliga). Unfortunately, for this league, more than one third of all assistant\nreferees' heights were missing). Independent sample t-tests were performed to test whether\nhead referees were significantly taller than their assistants.\nResults\nReferees were on average 4.09 cm taller than assistant referees (Figure 1a; t-test; M\nHeight increases authority in professional refereeing\nThe effect of height can thus not be attributed to the association between age and height.\nStudy 2: World Cup referees\nMaterial and Methods\nTo replicate our finding for the French league we collected data from the FIFA-\nwebsite (www.fifa.com) on all referees and assistant referees who officiated in the 64\nmatches of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. In total, 29 trios consisting of one referee\n(n = 29) and two assistant referees (n = 58) were invited for the World Cup. Referees were\neither assigned as an \"active\" referee or as \"stand-in\" referee (fourth official) during a\nmatch. Similarly, assistant referees were either assigned as an \"active\" assistant referee or\nas \"stand-in\" assistant referee (fifth official). The fourth official is the primary replacement\nof the referee when he is unable to continue officiating, whereas the fifth official is the\nprimary replacement of the assistant referee.\nOnly four individuals were assigned exclusively as referee during the tournament.\nThirteen officials acted more often as referee than as fourth official, seven acted more often\nas fourth official than referee, and five acted only as fourth official. With respect to the\nassistant referees and fifth officials: twenty-two officials acted exclusively as assistant\nreferee, seventeen acted more as assistant referee than as fifth official, nine acted more\noften as fifth official than assistant referee, and ten acted only as fifth officials. Referees or\nfourth officials never officiated as an assistant referee or fifth official and no assistant\nreferee or fifth official ever officiated as referee or fourth official. We classified officials on\nthe basis of their most common overall assignment throughout the tournament (e.g., an\nindividual officiating as an assistant referee more often than as a fifth official was classified\nas an assistant referee). This led to the following classification of officials: 17 referees, 12\nfourth officials, 39 assistant referees, and 19 fifth officials.\nWe tested whether there was a difference in height between referees and assistant\nreferees and between \"active\" and \"stand-in\" (i.e. the 4th and 5th official) referees. Given\nthat height varies between countries, and that referees and assistant referees were invited in\ntrios, often with individuals from the same or neighboring countries, we included the trio as\na random effect. Inclusion of such a random effect rules out that the effect found for height\nis an artifact of between-country variation in height.\nResults\nIn 26 out of the 29 invited trios, the referee was taller than at least one assistant\nreferee, and in 17 trios the referee was taller than both assistants. The invited 29 referees\n= .004, d = 0.68). When taking into account the overall assignment of the officials, the\nbetween-country variation in height and the age of the officials, referees were estimated\nHeight increases authority in professional refereeing\n4.17 cm taller than assistant referees (Linear mixed model parameter estimate (\u00b1SE): -4.17\nThere was no significant difference in height between the \"active\" official and their\nsignificantly related to height (p = .14; Table 1). The height effect can thus not be attributed\nto the association between age and height. Parameter estimates for the full model can be\nfound in Table 1.\nWe also investigated whether height was related to the years of international\nexperience a referee had. Taller referees had fewer years of international experience prior\nto the World Cup (Pearson r(27)= -.39; p = .037). After controlling for the age of the\nreferee in a partial correlation, the relationship between height and experience became\nmarginally significant (r(26) = -.37; p = .051). For assistant referees, there was no\nrelationship between experience and height (r(56) = .15; p = .25).\nTable 1.

We used football data\npurchased from Impire AG, a company that specializes in collecting professional sports\ndata (www.impire.de). Available data comprised 1,530 matches from five seasons\ndivision. For each match the referee's identity (n = 28), his height and experience (number\nof seasons refereeing in the Bundesliga) were available, as well as the average rank of the\n18=lowest), the total number of fouls given by the referee, and the number of yellow and\nred cards that were administered to players. In football, a red card is given for a severe foul,\nand will result in direct expulsion of the player for the remainder of the match. Two yellow\ncards, for less severe fouls, will also result in a red card, and hence expulsion. The foul data\nonly include illegal physical contacts towards other players (e.g. unfair tackles), and no\nother illegal actions that are penalized by the referee (e.g. handball and offside). For all\nanalyses, we included referee, the home team and the visiting team as random factors and\nheight, Bundesliga experience and age of referee as covariates. As referee age was highly\ncorrelated with referee experience (Pearson r(26) = .83; p < .0001), we did not include\nreferee age in the reported models. Including age in the models did not change any of our\nresults, as age never reached statistical significance (all p > .16). We tested whether referee\nheight was predictive of measures of authority and control during a game, such as the\nnumber of fouls and the number of cards given.\nHeight increases authority in professional refereeing\nFurthermore, we investigated whether referee height was predictive of the perceived\ncompetence of the referee, by examining whether these factors influenced the likelihood of\nbeing assigned to matches in which the home or visiting team was high ranking (controlling\nfor respectively the visiting and home team by adding them as a random factor). All\nanalyses were performed in R version 2.11.1 (R Development Core Team, 2008), using the\nlmer package. In the following we defined \"tall\" or \"experienced\" as one standard\ndeviation above the respective mean, and \"short\" or \"inexperienced\" as one standard\ndeviation below the respective mean.\nResults\nTable 2.

Controlling for the ranks of the playing teams, both referee experience (-0.75 \u00b1\np = .022; Figure 2a) were negatively associated with the number of fouls in a match (see\nTable 3 for all parameter estimates), indicating that taller and more experienced referees\nassigned less fouls and thus interrupted the game less. Experienced referees gave on\naverage 7.63 fewer fouls compared to inexperienced referees. Tall referees gave on average\n3.79 fewer fouls than short referees. Experience and height were not significantly\nassociated with the number of cards given in a match (Table 3).\nHeight increases authority in professional refereeing\nTable 3.

More experienced compared to less experienced and taller compared to\nshorter referees were assigned to matches in which the visiting team on average was ranked\nTable 4.

Results from Study 3: Least square means (+ SE) of the effect of referee height in\ncm (in three equal height range groups) on (a) the number of fouls, and (b) the average rank\nof the visiting team (lower rank means better team).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we have shown that referees, the leading officials in football, are taller\nthan their assistant referees in both a national (French professional football league) and an\ninternational (World Cup 2010) setting. These novel findings are in line with predictions\nbased on previous studies reporting a positive association between height and authority\nIn addition, we found evidence that the height of referees was associated with their\n(perceived) competence. First of all, we found that taller referees had relatively less\ninternational experience than shorter referees prior to their invitation to the World Cup.\nHeight increases authority in professional refereeing\nThus, a tall referee required less experience to be promoted to referee at the highest level.\nSecond, we found that taller and more experienced referees were assigned to matches in\nwhich the visiting team had a better performance over the study period in the German\nLeague. Hence, as more competent referees are more likely to be assigned to matches with\nhigher ranking teams, both experience and height appear to be indicators of this (perceived)\ncompetence. The reason why no effect of height and experience was found on the rank of\nthe home team can be explained by how referees in the Bundesliga are assigned. A referee\nis registered to a particular region within Germany and is not allowed to officiate in any\nmatches in which teams from that particular region are playing (DFB, 2010). However, for\nlogistical reasons, referees are likely to be assigned to matches in regions neighboring their\nown. Therefore, the region where the referee is registered constrains the set of home teams\nthat he can be assigned to, and hence the ranks of these home teams he can be assigned to.\nWe also found evidence that the height of referees was associated with their\neffectiveness and authority in the field. An important aspect of refereeing, according to the\nBritish Football Referees' Association (2010) is to \"keep control [of the game], by bending\nhis authority to encourage the flow of the game\". Taller compared to shorter referees gave\nfewer fouls, and thus increased the \"flow in the game\". Apparently, taller referees are better\nable to control the game by \"bending their authority\", resulting in players committing fewer\nfouls (i.e. players would be more wary of committing fouls or less inclined to retaliate\ntowards other players), or they resolved them in another way (e.g. deciding to \"play\nadvantage\" instead of stopping the game for a foul, because the fouled team still has the\nadvantage in the situation, or by warning players in another way). Similarly, more\nexperienced referees also awarded fewer fouls than less experienced referees. It is worth\nnoting that in the Bundesliga, for both the number of given fouls and the rank of the\nvisiting team, the effect of two extra centimeters in height was comparable to\napproximately one extra year of experience.\nInstead of the increased \"flow\" or control of the game by taller referees, the\nnegative association between referee height and the number of fouls could also mean that\ntaller referees either notice fewer fouls, or that they are more lenient. Some evidence\nsuggests however, that these alternative explanations are unlikely. Noticing fewer fouls\nwould indicate poor refereeing, as the main job of the referee is to notice and penalize\nfouls. As mentioned above, referee height was positively associated with measures of the\nperceived competence of the referee (e.g., being assigned to matches with higher-ranked\nteams), rendering it unlikely that taller referees are less likely to notice foul play.\nAdditionally, more experienced referees also awarded fewer fouls. As experience is a likely\ndeterminant of competence (Dohmen, 2008; Nevill, Balmer and Williams, 2002), the fact\nthat more experienced and taller referees awarded fewer fouls suggests that, awarding\nfewer fouls is likely to be a sign of competence rather than incompetence. It is also unlikely\nthat the positive relationship between height and number of fouls arises because taller\nreferees are more lenient as no differences were found in the number of cards given by\ntaller referees compared to shorter referees (if anything taller referees were less lenient as\nthey gave fewer fouls than shorter referees, yet handed out similar numbers of cards).\nAgain, these results were mirrored by the effects of experience: no differences were found\nin the number of cards handed out by experienced referees compared to less experienced\nHeight increases authority in professional refereeing\nreferees. A possible explanation for the finding that both stature and experience are related\nto the number of fouls but not the number of cards, is that there may simply be too little\nvariation in the number of cards given and hence the possibility to find an effect of height\nand experience may be reduced. Additionally, perhaps interrupting the game by calling a\nfoul is a more subjective decision than the decision of whether or not a player deserves a\ncard, for which there may be more strict guidelines (FIFA, 2010). In conclusion, the most\nlikely explanation for why taller (or more experienced) referees give less fouls, is that due\nto the authority a tall (or experienced) referee induces, he can increase the \"flow\" of the\ngame.\nThe present study does not address the process underlying the association between\nheight and authority. It could arise as a consequence of the association between height and\nactual ability of the referees. Previous studies have proposed several hypotheses explaining\nthis association, including the positive relationship between height and cognitive ability\n(explained by common factors such as genes or nutrition; Silventoinen, Posthuma, van\nBeijsterveldt, Bartels and Boomsma, 2006), health (Silventoinen, Lahelma and Rahkonen,\n1999), participation in social activities in young adulthood (Persico, Postlewaite and\nSilverman, 2004), and self-esteem (Judge and Cable, 2004). The association between\nheight and authority in referees may also be a consequence of the perception of the referees\nby others. Taller people may be perceived as more competent, authoritative, or dominant\nnecessary to determine the causal pathways through which height induces (perceived)\nauthority across different settings.\nThe higher perceived competence of taller men (Judge and Cable, 2004; Young and\nFrench, 1996) is likely to lead to discrimination against shorter men. Cinnirella and Winter\n(2009) showed that in the labor market employer discrimination with respect to height was\nlikely as height was positively related to income in employees (i.e. subordinate to their\nemployers) and, in contrast, this relationship was not found in self-employed workers (i.e.\nwho have no manager above them and hence are not at risk of discrimination). The finding\nthat taller referees were assigned to higher quality matches could be a consequence of a\nsimilar type of discrimination. When actual competence is not related to height and our\nsubconscious biases act to discriminate against short individuals, society should consider\npolicies to guard against this form of discrimination.\n"
