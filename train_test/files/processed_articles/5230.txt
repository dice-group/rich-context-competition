In particular, Trivers argued that as parents and\noffspring are not genetically identical, offspring will tend to make mate choices which\nmaximize their fitness, but not necessarily the fitness of their parents. Recently, a number\nof papers have attempted to identify specific areas of disagreement over mating between\nparents and offspring.\nIn particular, Apostolou (2007a) hypothesized that offspring value the genetic\nquality of their spouses more than their parents value the genetic quality of their in-laws.\nThe reason being that the coefficient of relatedness of parents to children is 0.5, but the\ncoefficient of relatedness of grandparents to grandchildren is only 0.25. Accordingly,\nindividuals benefit more by a spouse than an in-law of good genetic quality. Consistent\nwith this prediction, Apostolou (2008a) found that individuals value good looks, a proxy of\ngenetic quality, significantly more in a spouse than in an in-law. Similarly, Buunk, Park,\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nand Dubbs (2008) found that individuals consider potential partners who are unattractive\nmore unacceptable for themselves than they think their parents would consider them for\ntheir children.\nFurthermore, it has been argued that historically a preference for a mating candidate\nwith good family background increased the fitness of the parents more than it increased the\nfitness of their offspring (Apostolou, 2008b; Buunk, Park, and Dubbs, 2008; Trivers,\n1974). In accordance with this hypothesis, Apostolou (2008b) found that individuals value\ngood family background more in an in-law than in a spouse. Similarly, Buunk, Park, and\nDubbs (2008) found that individuals consider potential partners who have a bad family\nbackground less unacceptable for themselves than they think their parents would consider\nthem for their children.\nConflict is not confined only to beauty and family background but extends also to\nreligious background, personality traits, and mating strategies (Apostolou, 2008a, 2008b,\npaper is to contribute to this line of research by providing evidence that mating age\nconstitutes another area of parent-offspring disagreement.\nParent-Offspring Conflict over Mating Age\nAsymmetrical interests between parents and children induce the former to control\nthe mating decisions of the latter (Apostolou, 2007b, 2010). Parents are able to do so\nbecause they are in control of parental investment and because they are physically stronger\nthan their offspring (Alexander, 1974; Apostolou, 2007b). However, the strength of\nparental control over mating is inversely related to offspring's age (Apostolou, 2007b,\n2010). In particular, as children grow older, they become more independent from parental\ninvestment. For instance, in foraging societies older individuals are more experienced\nhunters and more productive gatherers (e.g., the !Kung; see Lee, 1979), while in\nagropastoral societies, older individuals may obtain their own land and cattle (e.g., the\nSomali; see Lewis, 1962). Moreover, as offspring age they become physically stronger than\ntheir parents, who grow older and weaker and can no longer impose their choices on them\nby means of physical strength.\nConsequently, as their children grow up, parents' capacity to control their mating\ndecisions substantially decreases. Accordingly, parents would like their offspring to get\nmarried at a younger age, before they become independent, while the offspring would\nprefer to get married later so as to become more independent from their parents, and thus,\nmore able to exercise their own mate choice. Finally, early marriage reduces the time space\nthat offspring have to engage in premarital sexual relationships, which is beneficial to\nparents (see below). It is predicted then that individuals prefer to marry later than they\nprefer their offspring to marry.\nFurthermore, the initiation of sexual relationships may result in the development of\nfeelings of love or pregnancy, which may seriously compromise parental attempts to\ncontrol the mating behavior of their children. For instance, in rural Greece during the last\ncentury, in the case of pregnancy, the couple had to get married even if the groom or the\nbride did not comply with the parents' standards (Friedl, 1962). Therefore, parents would\nprefer their offspring to delay sexual relationships as these may commit them to a\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\ndisadvantageous marriage. On these grounds, it is further predicted that individuals prefer\nto start having sexual relationships at an earlier age than they would like their offspring to\ndo so.\nMoreover, parental investment is asymmetrical, with females diverting more\ninvestment to their offspring than males (Trivers, 1972). Males seek access to the\nreproductive capacity of the female, enabling parents to acquire more benefits from\ncontrolling their daughters' mating decisions (Apostolou, 2007b, 2010; Perilloux,\nFleischman, and Buss, 2008). Also, a sexual liaison may commit a daughter's parental\ninvestment (i.e. pregnancy) in the mutual offspring of a man whom her parents do not\napprove (Perilloux et al., 2008). Similarly, if a sexual relationship before marriage ends up\nin pregnancy, the father may not always be persuaded to stay. The pregnant woman in turn\nis left alone with her parents to shoulder the weight of raising the child.\nIn addition, due to paternal uncertainty, males place a premium on the chastity of\nthe female (Buss, 2003; Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Thus, early sexual liaisons can damage\nthe status of the female and the prospects of her parents to arrange a good marriage (e.g., to\nmake an alliance with a desirable family). Finally, as youth is valued more in women than\nin men (Buss, 2003), a daughter who is married young can attract a higher quality mate\nthan a daughter who is married at a later age.\nFor these reasons, parents should be more interested to marry their daughters early\nto men of their own choice and prevent them from having sexual relationships before\nmarriage. Accordingly, it is predicted that parental preferences are contingent upon the sex\nof the offspring, as parents prefer their daughters to marry earlier and start sexual\nrelationships later than their sons.\nTo test these hypotheses two studies have been conducted. Study 1 examines\ndifferences in preferences over marital age, and Study 2 examines differences in\npreferences over the initiation of sexual activity.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nonline survey. The mean age of male participants was 50.14 years (SD = 11.91) and the\nmean age of female participants was 46.1 years (SD = 10.24). A private company was\nemployed specializing in recruiting participants for online research in psychology. The\nparticipants were selected from a large database of people willing to participate in online\npsychological research and have registered through the company's web site. To take part in\nthe survey, participants had to be parents with at least one child. Parents had on average\nyears (SD = 13.73). Most participants were married (74%), followed by those in a\nrelationship (10.7%), divorced (8.2%), single (4.1%), and engaged (2%). All parents\nreceived payment for completing the survey in the form of credit (about $2) that can be\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nused to purchase goods from online stores.\nProcedure\nThe survey consisted of two parts. In the first part, demographic data were\ncollected: sex, age, nationality, marital status, number of daughters, number of sons, age of\nthe oldest male child, and age of the oldest female child. Participants were then asked to\nconsider a hypothetical scenario. Arranged marriage is the commonest type of marriage\nacross human societies and was most likely common during human evolutionary time\n(Apostolou, 2007a, 2010). Since arranging the marriage of their offspring was probably a\nnatural act for parents, a scenario where parents had to choose spouses for their children\nwas selected for the purposes of this study:\nYou have two children, one male and one female, who have recently entered\npuberty. You live in a society where marriages are arranged and it is your\nduty as a parent, through negotiations with other parents, to find an\nappropriate spouse for both your daughter and son.\nNext, the participants were asked to indicate the age they consider appropriate for\ntheir daughters and sons to get married. In the second part, participants were given the\nfollowing scenario: \"You have recently entered puberty. You live in a society where\nmarriages are not arranged and it is up to you to find a husband or a wife.\" The participants\nwere asked to indicate the age they consider appropriate for them to get married. The order\nof presentation of the two scenarios was randomized between participants.\nIn-Law vs. Mating Preferences Comparisons\nexamine parent-offspring conflict over mating. In particular, sexually mature individuals\nwho have children were selected as participants because they can act both as parents and\nmate seekers. In addition, a within-participants design has been employed, because it\nenables a better control for alternative explanations based on social learning. A between-\nparticipants design inevitably involves a generation gap between parents and offspring,\nthus, any potential differences in the responses between the two can be attributed to\ndifferences in socialization in each generation.\nMoreover, the ratings of the female participants for themselves were compared with\nthe respective ratings for their daughters, and the ratings of the male participants for\nthemselves were compared with the respective ratings for their sons. Comparisons between\nfemale participants and sons, and between male participants and daughters were not made,\nsince the results from this analysis would fail to distinguish differences in the ratings\nbetween sexes (men versus women) from differences in the ratings between parents and\noffspring.\nResults\nIn order to identify the differences between in-law and mating preferences, a series\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nof paired-sample t-tests was conducted between self and daughter and between self and son\nratings on the marital age item. The results are summarized in Table 1.\nTo begin with, female participants prefer to marry later (M = 24.92, SD = 3.22) than\ntailed), d = .34. Furthermore, male participants prefer to marry later (M = 25.26, SD = 3.89)\nMoreover, in order to examine whether age preferences are contingent upon the sex\nof the offspring, a series of paired-sample t-tests was conducted between sons and\ndaughters. The results indicate that parents want their female offspring to marry earlier (M\nTable 1. Significant mate-seeker vs. offspring and male vs. female offspring differences\nDifferences\nFemale Mate-seeker vs.\nDaughter\nDifferences\nMale Mate-seeker\nvs. Son\nDifferences\nDaughter vs. Son\nAll participants in this study were parents, so inevitably their mean age is not\nrepresentative of the age of an individual at first marriage. If preferences are affected by\nage, the true extent of the parent-offspring conflict may be overrated or underrated in this\nanalysis. To examine whether this is the case, the marital age items were regressed on the\nage of the participants. No significant effects were found. However, we should be cautious\nof this result as there were very few participants of a younger age in the sample.\nA possible scenario is that parental preferences differ according to the age of their\noffspring. More specifically, parental preferences may be `activated' only when the\noffspring enter puberty and sexual relationships and marriage become possibilities. To test\nwhether this is the case, a new independent variable was created which is based on the age\nof the participants' children, and has four levels (both children younger than 14, both-\nchildren 14 or above, only male children 14 or above, only female children 14 or above).\nThe age 14 was selected because by this age most children have entered puberty (Blondell,\nFoster, and Dave, 1999). A one-way ANOVA was performed on each item of the survey\nwith the age of the offspring as an independent variable. No significant results were found.\nA drawback of this method is that it potentially conflates the effects of age and\ngender, while it uses a cut-off of 14 years of age, which may or may not be relevant in real\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nlife. For this reason, in order to examine whether the age of the offspring affects ratings, an\nalternative method has also been applied. In particular, the age of the oldest male child was\nregressed on parents' preferences for their sons, and the age of the oldest female child was\nregressed on the parents' preferences for their daughters. All regression results came\ninsignificant.\nNot all parents in the sample had children of both sexes. To examine whether the\nsex of the offspring affects parents' ratings, a one-way ANOVA was conducted in each\nitem of the study with the sex of the participants' children as an independent factor (three\nlevels: male children, female children, children of both sexes). No significant results were\nproduced, indicating that the parents' ratings are not affected by the sex of their children.\nFinally, not all parents in the sample had an equal number of children. Thus, in order to\nfind whether the number of children affects ratings, the number of children participants had\nwas regressed on marital age preferences. No significant results were found.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nonline survey. The mean age of male participants was 41.78 years (SD = 11.07) and the\nmean age of female participants was 37 years (SD = 9.2). A private company was\nemployed specializing in recruiting participants for online research in psychology. To take\npart in the survey, participants had to be parents with at least one child. Parents had on\nage of male children was 10.32 years (SD = 9.32) and the mean age of female children was\n9.83 years (SD = 9.65). Most participants were married (68%), followed by those in a\nreceived payment for completing the survey in the form of credit (about $2) that can be\nused to purchase goods from online stores.\nProcedure\nAlthough arranged marriage is common in contemporary non-Western societies and\nmost probably was also common during human evolutionary time, it is not common in\nmodern Britain (it is only practiced by certain minority groups). Thus, the scenario of\narranged marriage used in Study 1 can potentially sound implausible to participants. For\nthis reason, in this study participants were asked directly about their preferences.\nMore specifically, the survey consisted of two parts. In the first part, demographic\ndata were collected: sex, age, nationality, marital status, number of daughters, number of\nsons, age of the oldest male child, and age of the oldest female child. Then, the following\nscenario was given: \"You have two children, one male and one female, who are not\nmarried and have recently entered puberty.\" The participants were then asked to indicate\nthe age which they consider appropriate for their daughters and sons to start having sexual\nrelationships and the age they consider appropriate for their daughters and sons to get\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nmarried.\nIn the second part, participants were given the following scenario: \"You are not\nmarried and you have recently entered puberty,\" and they were asked to indicate the age\nthey consider appropriate for them to start having sexual relationships and the age they\nconsider appropriate for them to get married. The order of presentation of the two scenarios\nwas randomized between participants.\nResults\nIn order to identify the differences between in-law and mating preferences, a series\nof paired-sample t-tests was conducted between self and daughter and between self and son\nratings on each age item. The results are summarized in Table 2.\nMating age preferences vary significantly based on whether the participants act as\nmate seekers or parents. More specifically, female participants prefer to start having sexual\nrelationships earlier (M = 17.78, SD = 2.06) than they prefer their daughters to do so (M =\nparticipants prefer to start having sexual relationships earlier (M = 17.68, SD = 2.07) than\nWith respect to the marital age, female participants prefer to marry later (M = 24.05,\n-2.85, p < .01, (two-tailed), d = .16.

No significant effects were found. Moreover, to\nexamine whether parental preferences differ according to the age of their offspring, a one-\nway ANOVA was performed on each item of the survey with the age of the offspring as an\nindependent variable. No significant results were found. Similarly, the age of the oldest\nmale child was regressed on parents' preferences for their sons, and the age of the oldest\nfemale child was regressed on the parents' preferences for their daughters. All regression\nresults came insignificant. Also, to examine whether the sex of the offspring affects\nparents' ratings, a one-way ANOVA was conducted in each item of the study with the sex\nof the participants' children as an independent factor (three levels: male children, female\nchildren, children of both sexes). No significant results were produced. Finally, the number\nof participants' children was regressed on their preferences items without producing any\nsignificant results.\nDiscussion\nConsistent with the original hypothesis, it is found that individuals prefer for their\noffspring to start having sexual relationships at a later age than they prefer for themselves\nto do so. It is also found that participants prefer to marry later than they prefer for their\nchildren to marry. Moreover, it is found that parents prefer their female offspring to marry\nearlier and start sexual relationships later than their male offspring. Note that this\nasymmetry in preferences is due to parents being more interested in controlling the mating\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\nbehavior of their daughters than of their sons, and not due to parents being interested in\ndelaying their sons' marriage and accelerating their sexual relationships. In other words,\nparents do not prefer a longer period of time between the onset of sexual activity and\nmarriage for sons; they simply prefer a shorter period for daughters.\nParents and offspring disagree over specific traits, such as beauty and family\nbackground, because these preferences give them direct benefits. For instance, by\npreferring a more attractive individual than their parents prefer, offspring increase their\nchance to find a spouse of superior genetic quality. On the other hand, asymmetrical\npreferences with respect to mating age give indirect benefits to each party. For example, a\npreference to marry later than their parents would prefer enables offspring to marry later.\nThis may give them more freedom over mate choice, which in turn increases the\nprobability of finding attractive spouses, giving them genetic benefits. Consequently,\nasymmetrical mating age preferences arise because parents and offspring have different\npreferences for traits which give them asymmetrical benefits. If all traits were equally\nbeneficial to parents and offspring, asymmetrical preferences over mating age would not\nhave evolved.\nThe results of this study allow us to make a number of predictions about modern\nfamily dynamics and the institution of marriage. More specifically, we expect parents to\nattempt to persuade or advise their offspring to marry earlier than they desire. For instance,\nparents may keep reminding their children that they are old enough and it is now time for\nthem to settle down and marry. Parents are also expected to attempt to control the mate\nchoices of their teenage children, and to physically restrict their mating activities (e.g., by\ngrounding) so as to prevent them from having early sexual relationships. Such control\nshould be asymmetrical, as parents are likely to be more concerned about the mating\nbehavior of their female offspring, put more pressure on their daughters to marry early and\nprevent them from having sexual relationships before marriage (see Goode, 1964; Perilloux\nAll human societies practice marriage, but in certain cultural settings the timing of\nmarriage is close to the initiation of sexual relationships, while in others it is much further\napart. This study finds evidence that parents prefer their offspring, and particularly the\nfemale ones, to delay sexual relationships and to accelerate marriage. On this basis, it can\nbe predicted that in societies where parents are influential over the mating decisions of their\noffspring, initiation of sexual relationships and marriage timing will converge, particularly\nfor women: individuals under parental influence will tend to marry earlier and start sexual\nrelationships later. For instance, among the Nandi in Kenya, where parents determine to a\nlarge extent the mate choices of their children, a marriage is arranged for a girl as soon as\nshe reaches puberty (Langley, 1979). On the other hand, in cultures where parents are not\nas influential over the mate choices of their offspring (e.g., Western societies), initiation of\nsexual relationships and marital age tend to diverge.\nThe close timing of marriage and sexual relationships in certain societies raises the\nquestion of whether it is meaningful to treat the two as distinct variables. The answer is yes\nfor two main reasons: First, close timing of marriage and sexual relationships takes place\nonly in a minority of societies. More specifically, this is more frequent in agropastoral\nsocieties where parents are more influential over the mating decisions of their offspring\nParent-offspring conflict over mating\n(Apostolou, 2010). Among foragers, it is a rare occurrence for virginity to be expected in\nmarriage (e.g., the !Kung; see Lee, 1979). Second, in most societies, irrespectively of their\nsubsistence type, men usually marry years after they have reached sexual maturity (Goode,\nA limitation of this study is that participants had to rate traits on the basis of a\nhypothetical scenario, which required participants to indicate their preferences as if they\nwere younger. This inevitably results into regressing to a younger age that, in turn, can be\nsubject to distorting memory effects. However, it is rather unlikely that such effects would\nbias the data in a manner consistent with our hypotheses; thus, it is reasonable to suggest\nthat the results of the study are due to asymmetrical preferences with respect to age rather\nthan distorting memory effects.\nAnother concern is that the within-participants design may mask the true extent of\nthe parent-offspring disagreement, because with this method in-law and mate preferences\nare likely to merge. For instance, in some cases the within-participants means are\nsignificantly different but very close together. Moreover, the offspring may consider it\nacceptable to have sexual relationships before marriage, but their parents may consider it\nunacceptable for their children to have sexual relationships outside marriage; this may\ncreate a source of conflict between the two. This study does not test this possibility, which\nshould be addressed in future research. Finally, this work is limited to a single culture (i.e.,\nBritish), and future research should attempt to replicate these findings for different and\ndiverse cultures, an endeavor that would enhance the evolutionary hypotheses of this study.\nOverall, this research attempts to further advance our knowledge on the parent-\noffspring conflict over mating. Parents and offspring are not genetically identical, and\nconsequently, do not have identical interests with respect to mating. To serve their interests\neach party has evolved different preferences with respect to mating age.\n"
