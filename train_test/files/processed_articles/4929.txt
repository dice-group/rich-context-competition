While some observers failed\nto notice anything unusual about the pseudoscopic scene, most experienced multiple\npseudoscopic phenomena, including apparent scene depth reversals, apparent object shape\nreversals, apparent size and flatness changes, apparent reversals of border ownership, and even\ncomplex illusory foreground surfaces. When multiple effects were experienced, patterns of co-\noccurrence suggested possible causal relationships between apparent scene depth reversals and\nseveral other pseudoscopic phenomena. The latency for experiencing pseudoscopic phenomena\nwas found to correlate significantly with observer visual acuity, but not stereoacuity, in both\nstudies.\n",

Wheatstone (1838) showed that these horizontal binocular\ndisparities can generate powerful impressions of depth, known as binocular stereopsis.\nUntil quite recently, it was assumed by most that the benefits of stereopsis for depth\nperception were restricted to viewing, and interacting with, near objects and surfaces (e.g.,\nexample, Gregory (1966) claimed that we are ``effectively one-eyed for distances greater\nthan about twenty feet'' (p. 53). However, stereopsis is now known to contribute to depth\nperception at considerably larger distances (see Allison, Gillam, & Vecellio, 2009; Gillam,\nIn 2010, Palmisano et al. conducted an experiment inside a disused railway tunnel aimed at\ndetermining the limiting range of stereopsis. Pairs of LED targets were presented either in\ncomplete darkness or with the tunnel environment lit just as far as the nearest LED.\nImportantly, in all the conditions tested, the only information available about the depths\nbetween the two LED targets came from binocular disparity. Under these reduced cue\nconditions, we found that binocular (but not monocular) perceptions of depth magnitude\nincreased with LED depths up to 248 m (the maximum LED depth separation that could be\nexamined in this tunnel using an observation distance of 40 m to the nearest LED). However,\nas stereopsis was clearly operational at the largest distances and depths examined in this\nstudy, we still do not know its actual limiting range. Since good stereoscopic observers are\nable to detect depth separations corresponding to binocular disparities of only a few seconds\nof arc (Howard, 1919), the maximum useful range of stereopsis could in principle exceed 1 km\n(based on Allison et al.'s 2009 geometric analysis which conservatively estimated stereoacuity\nInterestingly, more than a century ago, Stratton (1898) proposed that the pseudoscopic\nviewing of natural scenes could be used to determine the limiting range of stereopsis under\nfull cue conditions (as opposed to the reduced cue conditions used in our 2010 tunnel\nexperiment). A pseudoscope presents what is normally seen by the left eye to the right eye\nand vice versa (Wheatstone, 1852)--thereby putting binocular disparity in conflict with a\nvariety of monocular sources of information about the spatial layout (reversing the sign of\nthe available binocular disparities; so that uncrossed binocular disparities become crossed\nbinocular disparities and vice versa). Not surprisingly, the pseudoscopic viewing of natural\nscenes can produce vivid stereoscopic effects (see Figure 1; Ewald & Gross, 1906; Kalaugher,\nAccording to Stratton (1898), the most striking of these pseudoscopic experiences is the\napparent reversal of the scene's depth order: ``A tree, for example, between the person and a\nbackground of other trees may now seem to lie beyond those trees and to be seen through\nthem'' (p. 635). He argued that stereopsis continues to operate well beyond distances where\nsuch apparent scene depth reversals can be seen and proposed that the actual limiting range\nof stereopsis could only be identified by rapidly alternating between normal and pseudoscopic\nviewing. According to Stratton, the limiting range of stereopsis would correspond to the\ndistance at which perceptible differences between normal and pseudoscopic viewing were\nlost. He argued that scenery beyond this distance, in the outermost zone, should look\nequally flat during both types of viewing (as opposed to appearing to have more depth\nduring normal viewing). Based on his own observations using this technique, Stratton\nestimated that his limiting range of stereopsis was 580 m.\nThe current study was not directly aimed at testing Stratton's ideas about the limits of\nstereopsis. Instead its primary purpose was to systematically examine the nature and the\ntiming of pseudoscopic phenomena experienced when viewing natural outdoor scenes.\nSince the role that stereopsis plays at distances beyond personal (or interaction) space has\nhistorically received little examination, we were also particularly interested in the\npseudoscopic phenomena generated by viewing distant scenes. This knowledge is necessary\nas a precursor for generally applying Stratton's idea, as his technique for determining the\nlimiting range of stereopsis assumes that the effects of pseudoscopic viewing are quickly\nperceived as well as robust and similar for individuals with normal binocular/stereoscopic\nvision (because the technique relies on the detection of differences between normal and\npseudoscopic viewing during rapid view alternation).\nAnecdotal reports suggest that there can be substantial differences in both the nature and\ntiming of pseudoscopic experiences. For example, Wheatstone (1852) noted that ``these\nappearances are not always immediately perceived'' (p. 13) and ``the transition from the\nnormal to the converse perception is often gradual'' (p. 15). Similarly, Kalaugher (1987)\nnoted that ``pseudoscopic effects . . . may take a long time to develop, if indeed they\ndevelop at all'' (p. 372). Such reports also suggest that there are a variety of possible\npseudoscopic experiences, some of which are more readily experienced than others.\nFor example, it has also been claimed that the perceived depth order of the environment\nreverses more often than the perceived shape and curvature of individual objects\nPseudoscopic experiences are often difficult for observers to describe (particularly if they\nare not vision scientists or artists such as Terry Pope). This makes it challenging for\nexperimenters to distinguish between nai\u00a8ve observers: (a) not experiencing these effects and\n(b) experiencing them but having difficulty describing them. Exaggerated pseudoscopic\nFigure 1. Red\u00adcyan anaglyph stereo photograph presenting a rather cluttered natural scene. A normal\nscene can be observed with the red filter of the anaglyph glasses over the left eye. Switching the red filter to\nthe right eye produces a reversed disparity scene. During this pseudoscopic viewing, the perception of globally\nconsistent 3D layout can be difficult or even impossible for reversing observers. However, the pseudoscopic\nphotograph is perceived as a normal 3D scene by nonreversers. This stereo photograph was taken with a\nPanasonic LUMIX 3D1 camera and converted into an anaglyph figure using StereoPhoto Maker (http://\nstereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/).\nPalmisano et al. 3\nviewing has been repeatedly reported to produce more powerful and robust reversal effects\npseudoscopic viewing (where disparity magnitudes are maintained but disparity signs are\nreversed), disparity magnitudes are artificially increased during exaggerated pseudoscopic\nviewing (e.g., in the case of Kalaugher's study he had a simulated interocular distance of\n13 m). Since pseudoscopic experiences are reportedly accentuated by exaggerated\ncommercial device with a pseudoscopic enhancement factor of 3.41 in the current studies\n(see Figure 2). According to Terry Pope (the device designer), this particular pseudoscopic\nenhancement factor ``makes it easy to have continuous pseudoscopic experiences, which as\nwill be seen, are bizarre'' (Pope, 2008, p. 7; see also Walker, 1986). His mirror pseudoscope\nalso had two other potential advantages over most competing pseudoscopes (especially\nprismatic ones): (a) it had a relatively large field of view (it stimulated regions of the\nretina that were $90 wide in the left eye and $32 wide in the right eye; including a $28\nFigure 2. Ray diagram of Terry Pope's hand-held Mirror Pseudoscope X3 (www.phantascope.co.uk;\ninfo@phantascope.co.uk). Effective interocular separation with this pseudoscope was 22 cm producing a\npseudoscopic enhancement factor of 3.38 (assuming an observer interocular separation of 6.5 cm). Because\nthe left and right eyes' views were reversed, the relationship between vergence responses and physical\ndistance was also reversed. The observer diverged his or her eyes in order to fixate objects closer than\n3.15 m and converged them to fixate objects that were further away. Objects at infinity required a\nconvergence angle of $4 whereas objects at a closer distance of 3.15 m required 0 convergence (parallel\nvisual axes corresponding to fixation at infinity in normal viewing). In terms of the distance at which the\npseudoscopic and equivalent telestereoscopic images should not move when switching from tele-pseudo to\ntele-stereo viewing, this point should lie between the near alignment point of 3.15 m and infinity (where the\neyes are converged by $4).\nwide region of binocular overlap), and (b) it did not result in any lateral inversion\nField Study 1 (Pilot)\nWe examined the subjective experiences of 76 nai\u00a8ve binocular observers when viewing a\nnatural outdoor scene through our pseudoscope. The natural scene consisted of a grass\ncovered ground plane, a small pond surrounded by rocks, pole-mounted outdoor lights,\ntrees and bushes at a variety of distances from the observer, as well as more distant\nbuildings (see Figure 3). Accordingly, it provided a wide variety of monocular information\nabout its 3D layout (both distance and depth cues). Field Study 1 examined the extent to\nwhich there are individual differences in the nature and the timing of the subjective\nexperiences produced by tele-pseudoscopically viewing this particular scene. We also\nmeasured stereoacuity and basic visual acuity in order to see whether differences in these\nperceptual abilities were related to the likelihood and timing of tele-pseudoscopic experiences.\nAs we were particularly interested in larger distances and real scenes, we chose a natural\noutdoor scene where the furthest visible objects (e.g., the far building) were approximately\n75 m away (confirmed by Google Maps).\nMethods\nObservers. In sum, 76 undergraduate students at the University of Wollongong (18 males and\n58 females; mean age 25.3 years; age range 22\u00ad53 years) participated in this experiment for\ncourse credit. Observers with corrected vision always wore their normal glasses or contact\nlenses (i.e., during both the vision testing and pseudoscopic viewing phases of the study). While\nall of the observers had binocular vision, stereoacuities were found to range from 40 arcsec\n(or better) to 2,000 arcsec or worse (the upper limit of the Randot Butterfly Stereotest).\nBinocular visual acuities were found to range from 20/13 to 20/50. The Wollongong\nUniversity Ethics Committee approved the study in advance (HE12/311), and each\nobserver provided verbal informed consent before participating. These protocols were in\naccordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.\nApparatus. Stereoacuity was measured using the Random Dot Stereo Butterfly test (from\nStereo Optical Co., Inc; http://www.stereooptical.com/shop/stereotests/butterfly-stereotest/)\nat the recommended testing distance of 16 in. ($41 cm). Visual acuity was measured using a\nFigure 3. Bird's eye view (left) and observer view (right) of the natural outdoor scene used for the\npseudoscopic viewing experiment.\nPalmisano et al. 5\nSnellen Eye Chart, viewed at the recommended testing distance of 20 feet ($6 m). A mirror\nX3 pseudoscope (Phantascope; http://www.phantascope.co.uk/pages/about_pesu_\nhandheld.html) was used for the pseudoscopic viewing of the natural outdoor campus\nscene. Finally, the observers' pseudoscopic effect latencies were self-timed via a stopwatch.\nProcedure. Pseudoscopic viewing occurred at a single location on the University of\nWollongong's main campus (around midday on sunny, not overcast, days). Figure 3\n(a photograph taken from the observer's actual viewing position) shows the scenery visible\nat the testing site. Each observer was taken to this testing location and asked to describe what\nthey saw as they looked through the pseudoscope. Observers were to report anything unusual\nor interesting during their first 5-minute pseudoscopic exposure to the scene and on the basis\nof this information they were classified as either being reversers or nonreversers. After a\n5-minute long period of normal binocular viewing of this scene (i.e., natural disparity\nviewing), they then pseudoscopically viewed the same scene for a second time.\nPseudoscopic effect latency was measured on this second pseudoscopic\nexposure--observers started the stopwatch when the pseudoscopic viewing period began\nand stopped it when they first noticed something strange/unusual. They then again\ndescribed their experiences to the experimenter. Only reported strange/unusual experiences\nthat could potentially be pseudoscopic in origin were counted (if the description of these\nexperiences did not meet this criterion, then the timing data was discarded and the timing\ntrial was repeated).2 After the pseudoscopic viewing phase of the experiment, observers were\nescorted to an indoor laboratory, where their stereoacuity and binocular visual acuity were\nmeasured under controlled conditions.\nResults\nWe found large individual differences in the subjective experiences of pseudoscopic viewing.\nBased on spontaneous descriptions during the two periods of pseudoscopic viewing, we\nidentified five distinct types of strange/unusual experiences: (a) Apparent scene depth\nreversals, where physically near objects and surfaces were misperceived to be far and vice\nversa (e.g., ``the tree on the left appeared to be far away before [normal viewing], but now\nappears nearer to me than the one on the right''). While such depth reversals could occur\nacross the entire scene, they were often reported as patchwork effects (i.e., most salient in\nterms of the relations between a subset of environmental objects/surfaces). (b) Apparent\nobject shape reversals, where convex objects were misperceived as concave and vice versa\n(e.g., ``the trunk of that palm tree looks like it is hollowed out''); (c) Apparent size and flatness\nchanges, where physically far objects were misperceived to be smaller and flatter during\npseudoscopic (compared to normal) viewing (e.g., ``trees and the other objects in the scene\nnow look unnaturally flat''); (d) Apparent reversals of border ownership, where the edges of\nphysically far objects were misperceived to belong to nearer parts of the scene and the\noutlines of physically near objects could be seen as belonging to the background (e.g.,\n``The edge formed where the leaves of the two trees overlap looks weird . . . back-to-\nfront''); and (e) Complex illusory surfaces,3 where new and distinct foreground surfaces\nwere perceived during pseudoscopic viewing. Such pseudoscopic experiences appeared to\nbe more than simply depth reversals, as observers were aware that such surfaces did not\nexist in reality and while they were textured with real scene detail, other parts of these\nsurfaces could be entirely illusory (e.g., ``It is blowing my mind because I know there can't\nreally be a surface there''; ``That region looks like a cardboard cut-out''; ``It feels like I am\nlooking at that part of the scene through stained glass''). Although previous research has\nshown that pseudoscopic viewing can alter perceptions of surface color or shading for\nsimplified scenes (e.g., Bloj, Kersten, & Hurlbert, 1999; Logvinenko & Menshikova, 1994),\nwe had no spontaneous reports of such percepts when viewing our complex natural scene\n(possibly because they were less salient in this situation compared to the phenomena\ndescribed earlier).\nFigures 4 and 5 provide natural disparity stereoscopic photographs of two parts of this\ntesting scene. Figure 4 attempts to illustrate apparent scene depth reversals and apparent\nreversals of border ownership, whereas Figure 5 attempts to illustrate complex illusory\nsurfaces, produced by pseudoscopic viewing. Given large differences in the timing of\nreported pseudoscopic effects between individuals, we also analyzed the time take to report\nthe first pseudoscopic experience. Pseudoscopic effects were almost instantaneous for some,\ndelayed and difficult to see for others, and impossible to see for the rest. For some reversers,\npseudoscopic experiences were very robust--once obtained they persisted for almost the\nentire pseudoscopic viewing period. However, pseudoscopic effects could also be transient\nor bistable for other reversers. Pseudoscopic effects often evolved over the course of the trial.\nFor example, some observers, who later experienced apparent scene depth reversals, initially\nreported that objects (such as trees or the lamp posts) which they knew to be at different\nphysical distances appeared to be equally far away. In terms of the onset latencies of these\npseudoscopic experiences, such preliminary symptoms (e.g., this perceptual alignment of\nphysically depth separated objects) were deemed to be sufficient for a valid pseudoscopic\ntiming response.\nWe next investigated whether these pseudoscopic effect latencies could be predicted by\neither the observer's general or stereospecific visual abilities. Nineteen of our 76 binocular\nobservers did not appear to experience any pseudoscopic effects--they reported that the test\nscene looked perfectly normal to them even though all of the available test scene disparities\nwere reversed and exaggerated. Only six of these nonreversers were effectively static\nstereoblind (they had stereoacuities worse than 2,000 arcsec according to the Random Dot\nButterfly Test). The remaining 13 had functional static stereovision--all had stereoacuities\nbetter than 800 arcsec (mean stereoacuity was 99.7 arcsec; standard deviation was 158 arcsec).\nThus, we were unable to identify all of our nonreversers based on static stereoability alone.\nbetter vision, and only 6 had vision that was worse than 20/20). We then examined whether\nstereoacuity or binocular visual acuity could predict the pseudoscopic effect latencies of our\nreversers. While pseudoscopic effect latency was found to be independent of stereoacuity,\npseudoscopic effect latency and binocular visual acuity.

Due to the presence of a large number of ties, we\nsubsequently confirmed this relationship with Spearman (r(55) \u00bc .30, p \u00bc .02) and Tau-b\nDiscussion\nThis exploratory field study examined the pseudoscopic experiences of 76 individuals when\nviewing a distant natural outdoor scene. Their spontaneous descriptions were subsequently\ncategorized into five distinct types of pseudoscopic experiences: apparent scene depth\nreversals, apparent shape reversals, apparent size and flatness changes, apparent reversals of\nborder ownership, and complex illusory surfaces. While these different pseudoscopic\nexperiences often appeared to co-occur, the current study did not provide systematic data\nPalmisano et al. 7\non this issue. Accordingly, Field Study 2 was designed to provide empirical data on the\nfrequency and co-occurrence of these different phenomena.\nIn the current study, the experimenters deliberately did not provide observers with any\ninformation about the possible strange/unusual symptoms they might experience during\npseudoscopic viewing (they only diagnosed spontaneous reports of their experiences).\nThus, it is possible that the large number of observers classified as nonreversers in this\nstudy (i.e., 19 out of the total 76 observers) might reflect an overestimate due the\nFigure 4.

Field Study 2 was also designed to investigate this\npossibility. Instead of spontaneous responses, this follow-up study used careful and\nsystematic questioning to determine the occurrence of any/all of the pseudoscopic\nphenomena identified by the pilot study.\nField Study 1 was also aimed at determining how long these pseudoscopic experiences\ntook to develop. We found that pseudoscopic effects were almost instantaneous for some,\ndelayed and difficult to see for others, and impossible to see for the remainder. In terms of\nFigure 5.

Field Study 2 was also run to test whether this\nrelationship could be replicated.\nField Study 2\nField Study 2 examined the frequencies of experiencing each of the five different pseudoscopic\nphenomena identified in Field Study 1. These pseudoscopic experiences and their latencies\nwere recorded for a completely different group of 48 nai\u00a8ve observers. In this study, we also\nmeasured monocular visual acuities for the left and right eyes separately, as well as\nstereoacuity, in order to reexamine the relationships of these measures to pseudoscopic\neffect latencies.\nMethod\nObservers. A total of 48 undergraduate students at the University of Wollongong (18 males\nand 30 females; mean age 24.3 years; age range 21\u00ad45 years) participated in this experiment\nfor course credit. While all of these observers had binocular vision, their stereoacuity ranged\nfrom 40 arcsec (or better) to 2,000 arcsec. Their monocular visual acuities (again measured at\n6 m, but this time assessed for the left and right eyes separately) ranged from 20/10 to 20/70.\nNone of these observers had participated in Field Study 1 and they had not experienced\npseudoscopic viewing before.\nProcedure. In Field Study 2, the monocular visual acuities of each observer's left and right\neyes, as well as their stereoacuity, were measured by one experimenter under controlled\nlaboratory conditions. Observers then walked across campus to a second experimenter\nFigure 6. Relationship between pseudoscopic effect latency and (a) stereoacuity and (b) binocular visual\nacuity. LogMAR \u00bc Log minimum angle of visual resolution (20/20 corresponds to a logMAR score of 0;\npositive/negative scores are worse/better than 20/20).\n(who was completely unaware of their performance during vision testing) located at the\npseudoscopic testing site used in Field Study 1. This second experimenter then asked\nobservers to freely look through the pseudoscope for 3 minutes and report if they saw\nanything strange or unusual. After a 5-minute break of normal binocular viewing,\nobservers were given their second pseudoscopic exposure to the scene. During this second\npseudoscopic viewing period, observers were instructed to look directly ahead (i.e., over the\npond and towards the trees and buildings in the distance--see Figure 3) and their\npseudoscopic effect latency was timed. Each observer started their stopwatch when\npseudoscopic viewing began and stopped it when they experienced their first unusual/\nstrange pseudoscopic effect. These experiences were described to the experimenter in detail\nand categorized into the five subjective experiences identified earlier in Field Study 1 (i.e.,\napparent scene depth reversals, apparent shape reversals, apparent size and flatness changes,\napparent reversals in border ownership, and complex illusory surfaces) by careful questioning.\nDuring this experience categorization phase of the experiment, the experimenter went\nthrough the following checklist:\n. ``Please direct your attention to the two trees directly ahead of you, which tree looks\nnearer? The one on the left or the one on the right?''\n. ``Do any of the familiar objects in the scene appear to be inside out? For example, concave\nas opposed to convex (or vice versa)? That is, hollow as opposed to bulging (or vice\nversa)?''\n. ``Do any familiar objects or features of the scene look unusual to you in terms of either\ntheir size (larger/smaller) or shape (e.g., thinner/fatter)? If so, which features and how do\nthey appear?''\n. ``Please direct your attention to the leafy parts of the overlapping trees ahead of you, and\nin particular, to the border formed between them. Which of these trees does this border\nappear to belong to? The one on the left or the one on the right?''\n. ``Please direct your attention to the space between the trunks of these two trees. Can you\ndescribe to me how this region of the scene appears to you?'' (If the observer reported\nsymptoms consistent with the existence of a complex illusory surface, he/she was then\nasked to report the locations of at least one other such surface in the scene for\nconfirmation).\nResults\nFive of our 48 binocular observers did not report any pseudoscopic effects. They did not\nthink that anything looked unusual or out-of-the-ordinary (even though all of the available\nscene disparities were reversed and exaggerated). These five observers were thus classified as\nnonreversers. Only one of them appeared to be static stereoblind (she could not see the stereo\nbutterfly and her stereoacuity was worse than 2,000 arcsec according to the Random Dot\nButterfly Test; she also had monocular visual acuities of 20/30 and 20/70 in her two eyes).\nOne other nonreverser had a stereoacuity of 400 arcsec. However, the remaining three\nnonreversers all had stereoacuities better than 40 arcsec. Again, stereo ability alone was\nnot sufficient to identify all nonreversers. The five nonreversers had the following left and\nField Study 2 examined the likelihood of experiencing the different pseudoscopic\nphenomena previously identified by Field Study 1 (see Figure 7). Of the five pseudoscopic\nexperiences identified, scene depth reversals were the most common (experienced by 90% of\nthe 48 observers; i.e., all of the reversers), and shape reversals were the least common (8% of\nthe 48 observers). Size and flatness changes (65% of the 48 observers5), reversals in border\nownership (48% of the 48 observers), and complex illusory surfaces (44% of the 48 observers)\nwere all quite commonly experienced. These five pseudoscopic phenomena were not mutually\nexclusive. Two or more of these phenomena were typically experienced simultaneously by\nreversers. While it was possible for all of them to be experienced in the same session (3 of the\n43 reversers reported all five phenomena in the same session), it was more common for a\nsubset of experiences to co-occur (13/43 reversers each experienced four of the phenomena, 7/\n43 experienced three of the phenomena, and 14/43 experienced two of the phenomena).\nWhen multiple pseudoscopic effects were experienced, their patterns of co-occurrence\nappeared consistent with apparent scene depth reversals being necessary for the perception\nof several of the other pseudoscopic phenomena (size and flatness changes, reversals in border\nownership, and complex illusory surfaces). As can be seen in the Venn diagram provided in\nFigure 8, (a) size and flatness changes only occurred when the observer also experienced scene\ndepth reversals, (b) all reported cases of reversals in border ownership were accompanied by\nscene depth reversals, and (c) all reported cases of complex illusory surfaces were accompanied\nby scene depth reversals. Interestingly, Figure 8 shows that in all but 2 of the 23 cases,\nreversals in border ownership were also accompanied by complex illusory\nsurfaces--suggesting that both apparent scene depth reversals and apparent reversals in\nborder ownership aided in the perception of complex illusory surfaces.\nNext we looked at the time taken to experience these pseudoscopic effects. As in Field\nStudy 1, only reversers were examined. This group of observers all had functional static\nstereovision and visual acuities no worse than 20/40 in each eye. We again found large\nindividual differences in the time taken for reversers to experience pseudoscopic\nphenomena. These individual differences in pseudoscopic effect latency could not be\nFigure 7. Percentages of observers (n \u00bc 48) who experienced each of the different pseudoscopic effects\n(scene depth reversals, object shape reversals, size and flatness changes, reversals in border ownership and complex\nillusory surfaces). The percentage of nonreversers is also shown (none).\nAs in Field Study 1, pseudoscopic effect latencies were again significantly reduced for\nobservers with higher visual acuities (i.e., smaller or negative LogMAR scores--see\nFigure 9(b) and (c)). While Field Study 1 only measured binocular visual acuity, Field\nStudy 2 measured the monocular visual acuities of each of the observer's eyes. The\nreversers we examined all had monocular visual acuities which ranged from 20/10 (i.e.,\n\u00c00.3 LogMAR) to 20/40 (i.e., \u00fe0.3 LogMAR). The visual acuity of their better eye was\nthe best predictor of pseudoscopic effect latency--accounting for 18% of the variance\nthis relationship--reducing the likelihood that this finding was due to outliers (Spearman's\nshould be noted that the acuities of the two eyes were highly correlated (Spearman's\ndifferences between the visual acuities of the two eyes did not significantly predict\nGeneral Discussion\nAs Wheatstone (1852) noted: ``with the pseudoscope we have a glance, as it were, into\nanother visible world, in which external objects and our internal perceptions have no\nlonger their habitual relation with each other'' (p. 12). Since the original invention of\npseudoscopy by Wheatstone, these often vivid and bizarre pseudoscopic experiences have\nFigure 8. Venn diagram showing the relationships between scene depth reversals, size and flatness changes,\nreversals in border ownership, and complex illusory surfaces (object shape reversals are not shown as they were\nonly experienced by four observers).

Thus, it can be surprising for those of us who\nhave experienced these phenomena so powerfully to read statements that ``monoscopic\ncues . . . usually dominate the stereoscopic cues'' during pseudoscopic viewing (e.g.,\nthat ``when veridical monocular cues or familiarity cues were also presented normal depth\nwould be experienced in spite of the reversal of disparity'' (p. 392). Of course, the strength of\nthese pseudoscopic effects are thought to depend in a large part on the viewing method\nused--with weaker or null effects being more common with pseudoscopes that have small\nfields of view and that result in lateral inversion (Kalaugher, 1987). However, pseudoscopic\neffects have also been anecdotally reported to be weak or absent under seemingly ideal\nviewing conditions (i.e., with large fields of view, all scene disparities reversed, and no\nlateral inversion). For example, accidental pseudostereopsis was apparently quite common\nwhen viewing 3D movies at the theatre in the past, either because the filters in front of the\nFigure 9. Relationships between pseudoscopic effect latency and (a) stereoacuity, (b) visual acuity (best\neye), and (c) visual acuity (worst eye).\neyes, or the projectors, or the film reels themselves, were mixed up (Zone, 2005). Apparently\nthe audiences in these situations often did not notice the reversed disparities and still thought\nthey were seeing a 3D movie (albeit an uncomfortable or uninspiring one--Devernay &\nOur field research has shown that perceptual experiences during tele-pseudoscopic viewing\nare far more complicated than the simple dominance of either monocular cues over\nstereoscopic cues or of stereoscopic cues over monocular cues. These tele-pseudoscopic\nexperiences also appear inconsistent with a simple averaging of these stereoscopic and\nmonocular cues. When all of the available scene disparities were reversed, there were large\nindividual differences in both the nature and the timing of the resulting pseudoscopic\nexperiences. The current findings demonstrate that some observers (nonreversers) failed to\nnotice anything unusual about the pseudoscopically viewed scene (the scene looked normal\nand natural to them even with prolonged viewing). However, under identical conditions,\nmost observers (reversers) experienced a variety of pseudoscopic phenomena. For these\nreversers, the reversed disparity information clearly competed with, and in some cases,\npowerfully overrode the available monocular information (such as occlusion--arguably the\nstrongest ordinal monocular depth cue), the result being vivid pseudoscopic effects (either\nexperienced almost instantaneously or developing gradually over time).\nIt is possible that these intriguing individual differences in viewing experience were side\neffects of the Pope pseudoscope either (a) exaggerating the effective interocular distance (and\nconsequently the scene disparities) or (b) altering the direction and magnitude of the vergence\neye movements required to fixate different parts of the scene (see the caption of Figure 2 for a\ndescription). In terms of possibility (a), we note that the five different categories of\npseudoscopic phenomena (discussed in Types of Pseudoscopic Experience section below)\ncan still be seen when viewing Figures 1, 4, 5, and 12. As these stereophotographs were\ntaken with a Panasonic LUMIX 3D1 camera that had only a 3-cm interaxial lens\nseparation (i.e., less than the average interocular separation and considerably less than the\n22 cm effective interocular separation of the Pope pseudoscope), this suggests that such\npseudoscopic experiences also occur with normal/reduced-from-normal scene disparities. In\nterms of possibility (b), we note that the reversed direction of vergence eye movements is a by-\nproduct of any pseudoscopic viewing situation (since, by definition, the disparities are\nreversed in sign). However, we acknowledge that the magnitude of the vergence eye\nmovements required and mirror point will vary (e.g., in a display based pseudoscope the\nmirror point would normally be the screen distance). We also acknowledge that it is currently\nunclear as to whether individual differences in pseudoscopic effect latency (discussed in\nIndividual Differences in Pseudoscopic Effect Latency section below) are restricted to the\nPope pseudoscope or generalize to other pseudoscopic viewing conditions.\nTypes of Pseudoscopic Experience\nIn the present study, we identified five different categories of phenomena that could be\nexperienced when pseudoscopically viewing our natural scene. These were not mutually\nexclusive, and in fact, several of these effects co-occurred for most observers. The most\nstriking and unusual of these effects were the complex illusory surfaces, which were\nsurprisingly common (44% of observers in Field Study 2) and are discussed in detail in the\nnext section. Consistent with previous anecdotal reports, apparent scene depth reversals were\nthe most commonly experienced of these pseudoscopic effects--reported by 90% of the\nobservers in Field Study 2 (i.e., all of the reversers). In most cases, these scene depth\nreversals were straightforward for our nai\u00a8ve observers to see and describe (physically near\nobjects in the scene were spontaneously reported to instead appear to be far away and vice\nversa). Reversals in border ownership were also quite common (reported by 48% of observers\nin Field Study 2) and easy to notice when attending to scene regions that contained near-far\nocclusions. However, Field Study 1 revealed that these border reversal effects could be\ndifficult for nai\u00a8ve observers to spontaneously describe. Accordingly, carefully designed\nquestions were used to identify border reversal effects in Field Study 2. Apparent size and\nflatness changes were also common (reported by 65% of observers in Field Study 2).\nHowever, observer reports suggested these effects were less salient than scene depth\nreversals and border reversals (they did not jump out in the same way). Objects that were\nfurther away (but appeared closer) merely appeared somewhat smaller and flatter.6 By\ncontrast, consistent with Wheatstone's (1852) own observations,7 apparent object shape\nreversals were found to be quite rare (reported by only 8% of observers in Field Study 2).\nHowever, these object shape reversals were quite striking whenever they were actually seen\n(convex objects, such as tree trunks, were reported to appear hollowed out or inside out).\nInterestingly, all of the observers that reported these apparent object shape reversals had\nstereoacuities better than 40 arcsec. These individuals may have been better able to utilize\nthe fine relative disparities/disparity gradients required to process object shape (such as the\nsmall variations in disparity along a surface). While vertical disparity should not have\naffected the predicted depth order during pseudoscopic viewing, it is also possible that\nreversed patterns of vertical disparity might have affected apparent shape reversals and\npossibly the tolerance to pseudoscopic reversals by calibrating the available (reversed)\nhorizontal binocular disparities (see Gillam, Chambers, & Lawergren, 1988; Rogers &\nAs noted earlier, apparent scene depth reversals were the most commonly reported\npseudoscopic experience. Observer reports strongly suggested that the experience of several\nother pseudoscopic effects logically depended on these changes in apparent scene depth/\ndistance. Apparent changes in size and flatness as well as apparent changes in border\nownership only occurred when there were also apparent depth reversals in the scene layout.\nSimilarly, all reported cases of complex illusory surfaces were also accompanied by scene depth\nreversals. Furthermore all but 2 of the 23 cases of reversals in border ownership were also\naccompanied by complex illusory surfaces. Taken together, these observations suggested that\n(a) it was not possible to experience reversals in border ownership or complex illusory surfaces\nwithout experiencing apparent scene depth reversals, and (b) reversals in border ownership might\nalso be important for generating the complex illusory surfaces.\nAppearance and generation of the complex illusory surfaces. Of all the pseudoscopic reversal\nphenomena described earlier, the complex illusory surfaces were reported to be particularly\nstriking and unusual by those who experienced them (often referred to as bizarre or trippy).\nThese completely new (and in reality nonexistent) perceived surfaces could only be seen\nduring pseudoscopic viewing. While they always appeared as foreground occluding\nsurfaces, they were typically more than simply depth reversals (although the two\npseudoscopic effects were clearly related). These complex illusory surfaces were formed by\nobjects and surfaces that were actually present in the scene. However, they were perceptually\nreorganized in unusual/unfamiliar ways. Our own observations and observer reports (e.g.,\nethereal surfaces and looking through stained glass) revealed that these new surfaces (a) were\noften textured by a mixture of empty space and scene details from physically far regions and\n(b) were each bounded by perceptually continuous contour consisting of a variety of\ndiffering/nonmatching components/segments (i.e., patterns of luminance and color change\nacross each perceived bounding contour often varied dramatically along its length).\nPurely illusory foreground surfaces (i.e., phantom surfaces) have been previously reported\nin the literature under conditions in which monocular regions are generated in binocular\nimages (e.g., Nakayama and Shimojo, 1990). Leonardo da Vinci noticed that such monocular\nregions occur in normal binocular vision whenever a nearer surface occludes a further\ntextured surface (Richter, 1977; Wade, Ono, & Lillakas, 2001). For example, in the\nparticular situation depicted in Figure 10, the left eye sees more of the background surface\non the left, and the right eye sees more of the background surface on the right, generating two\ndifferent but valid monocular regions. These monocular regions are deemed to be valid\nbecause they can be accounted for by the presence of the nearer binocularly visible\noccluder. However, Nakayama and Shimojo (1990) demonstrated that phantom surfaces\n(i.e., invisible foreground occluders) are perceived when invalid monocular regions occur in\nthe binocular image. Gillam and Nakayama (1999) measured the perceived depth of such\nphantom surfaces under conditions similar to those depicted in Figure 11(a) (perceptual\nappearance and geometry are shown in Figure 11(b) and (c)). They found that the\npositions and depths of these phantom surfaces appeared to account for the absence of the\nexpected feature in the other eye's image. Something similar may have been happening here\nduring the pseudoscopic viewing of our natural outdoor scene--even though phantom\nsurfaces are traditionally thought of as being completely invisible foreground occluders\n(e.g., Harris & Wilcox, 2009), whereas our complex illusory foreground surfaces were a\nmixture of both empty space and real scene texture.\nMonocular regions that are valid (i.e., can be accounted for by the presence of a nearer\nphysical occluder) during the normal viewing of a scene should become invalid during\npseudoscopic viewing of the same scene (at least, when perceived depths in that part of the\nscene are reversed). Thus, it is possible that complex illusory occluding surfaces were perceived\nduring pseudoscopic viewing in our studies to account for the generation of invalid\nmonocular regions in the natural outdoor scene. The purely illusory patches in these\nsurfaces (possibly phantoms) appeared to contribute to their particularly strange/unusual\n(e.g., ethereal) overall appearance.\nPreviously, Ha\n\u00a8 kkinen and Nyman (2001) showed using schematic stimulus displays, that\nphantom surfaces8 can capture ambiguous wall paper texture lying within them (all of the\ntexture inside the region appeared to lie at the same depth as the bounding contours of the\nphantom surface). Interestingly, similar capture of natural scene texture appeared to be\noccurring with the complex illusory surfaces seen in our two field studies. While their\ninternal surface texture was generated by objects lying at a variety of depths, the complex\nillusory surfaces themselves were usually reported as being irregularly shaped flat frontal\nplanes lying in front of physically nearer scene regions. Of course, an alternative\nexplanation could be that these illusory surfaces just appeared planar (if a distant scene\nwas misperceived to be nearer then all of the disparity-based depth in the perceived\nforeground should have been compressed).\nIndividual Differences in Pseudoscopic Effect Latency\nAs well as differences in the nature of the pseudoscopic effects experienced, we also found\nlarge individual differences in the time taken to experience these effects. What factors might\nbe responsible for these differences in pseudoscopic effect latency? They were unlikely to have\nbeen due to binocular rivalry. Even though the observer's left and right eye views were\nswitched, and scene disparities were exaggerated by a factor of $3.4, the two eyes' views\nremained remarkably similar (with the exception of monocular regions). Also, once\npseudoscopic effects were fully developed they tended to be quite stable (not transient or\nbistable)--from that point on they were generally perceived continuously until the\npseudoscopic viewing period ended.\nWe also examined whether these individual differences in pseudoscopic effect latency could\nbe explained by either the observer's general or stereospecific visual abilities. While these\nlatency differences could not be explained by stereoacuity, pseudoscopic effect latencies were\n(on average) significantly shorter for observers with higher (relative to lower) visual acuities.\nIn Field Study 1, binocular visual acuity predicted 9% of the variance in this latency data.\nPrediction improved to 18% of the variance in Field Study 2, when the monocular visual\nacuities of the two eyes were measured separately.\nWhy might pseudoscopic effect latency vary as a function of visual acuity?\nPossibility #1. Observers with poor visual acuity could not see well enough. This explanation\nappears unlikely for several reasons. First, 85% (Field Study 1) and 89% (Field Study 2) of\nour observers had visual acuities that were equal to or better than 20/25. Second, even the\nworst binocular visual acuities recorded were deemed adequate for driving an automobile\n(e.g., Gresset and Meyer, 1994). Only one observer in Field Study 1 had a binocular visual\nacuity of 20/50 and only one in Field Study 2 had a visual acuity worse than 20/50 (she had\n20/70 in one eye and 20/30 in the other). Third, observers with the worst visual acuity\nFigure 10. Bird's eye view of an occluding surface with two da Vinci type monocular regions generated on\nthe surface behind (LE \u00bc left eye; RE \u00bc right eye).\n(including the two mentioned earlier) were removed from our regression and correlation\nanalyses (these only examined the latencies of reversers). Fourth, several of our lower\nacuity reversers (e.g., 20/40 both eyes) reported the co-occurrence of four (out of a\npossible five) identified pseudoscopic effects. Fifth, observers can still perceive robust\npseudoscopic effects with artificially blurred stereophotos, such as the scene depicted in\nPossibility #2. Defocus blur. Retinal images of 3D scenes contain variations in spatial blur\n(i.e., gradients of blur), due to the finite depth-of-focus of the eye. As a result an object will\nbecome increasingly blurred as it moves away from the focal plane (Mather, 1997; Mather &\nSmith, 2002; Pentland, 1987). If different parts of the scene contain sharply focused and\nblurred textures, then these focused and blurred regions are often perceived as being at\ndifferent depths (even in the absence of other depth cues--Held, Cooper, & Banks, 2012;\nNguyen, Howard, & Allison, 2005). On its own defocus blur does not indicate whether the\nout-of-focus object is nearer or more distant than the fixated object (only their depth\nmagnitude). Thus, the unsigned depth information provided by defocus blur could in\nprinciple reinforce the signed depth magnitude information provided by (reversed)\ndisparities during pseudoscopic viewing.9 Since defocus blur should be a more reliable\nFigure 11. (a) Uncrossed fusion of the upper pair (or crossed fusion of the lower pair) of this stereogram\ngenerates a phantom rectangle, which appears to account for the monocular regions in the centers of the\nvertical lines. (b) The percept produced by free fusing the stereogram. (c) Gillam and Nakayama (1999) found\nthat, as predicted from the geometry of this situation, the perceived depth of the phantom occluder increases\nwith the thickness of the vertical stimulus lines.\ndepth cue for those with better visual acuity, this might explain why such observers also\nexperienced pseudoscopic reversals more quickly and powerfully. The major problem with\nthis explanation is that the human eye is hyperfocal at distances of 2 to 3 m (Campbell, 1957).\nAs defocus blur is naturally more effective at near distances (not far), this particular\nexplanation of the current results seems unlikely (since compelling pseudoscopic effects\nwere observed here at much larger distances as far away as $75 m away).\nPossibility #3. Differential binocular blur. Differential binocular blur is often reported to be\nmore disruptive to stereoacuity than equal blur (e.g., Halpern & Blake, 1988; Westheimer &\nMcKee, 1980). So another possible explanation of the current findings was that observers\nwhose eyes had different visual acuities might have taken longer to experience pseudoscopic\nphenomena (compared to those who had similar visual acuities in their two eyes). Field Study\n2 tested this possibility. However, contrary to this explanation, individual differences in the\nvisual acuities of the two eyes were not found to significantly predict pseudoscopic effect\nlatencies.\nPossibility #4. Pickup of high spatial frequency content. Superior visual acuity would also\nhave aided in the monocular pickup of higher spatial frequency content (including\nmonocularly available texture gradient based depth information). Thus, another possible\nexplanation of the current results was that if observers with higher visual acuity were more\nsensitive to monocular texture gradient cues, they should also be less prone to experience\npseudoscopic phenomena (such as apparent scene depth reversals). However, the opposite\npattern of results was consistently found in both of our field studies.\nPossibility #5. Detecting disparity gradients and the consequences of pseudoscopic\nviewing. Superior visual acuity should also have aided in the binocular pickup of higher\nspatial frequency disparity content (e.g., disparity gradient-based information; see Felton,\nfrom the more distant parts of the scene. This additional disparity-based information might\nhave reinforced stereoscopic (versus monocular) depth percepts, thereby strengthening both\npseudoscopic depth reversal and border reversal effects. Those with higher visual acuity would\nalso have been more sensitive to some of the side effects of pseudoscopic viewing, including\nmismatches between monocular and stereoscopic texture gradient information and the\npresence of invalid monocular regions (the latter might have increased the likelihood of\nFigure 12. Original (left) and artificially blurred (right: Photoshop Gaussian blur with a radius of 8.5 pixels)\nred\u00adcyan anaglyph pseudoscopic photographs. Pseudoscopic effects are still perceptible in the highly blurred\nanaglyph on the right (red filter over the right eye for viewing both pseudoscopic photographs).\ncomplex illusory occluding surfaces being generated). According to this explanation, observers\nwith worse visual acuity might have been restricted to detecting mismatches and side effects\nof pseudoscopic viewing (if at all) at object boundaries, or only between objects greatly\nseparated in depth.\nConclusions\nIn 1898, Stratton argued that the pseudoscopic viewing of natural scenes could be used to\ndetermine the limiting range of stereopsis. His technique assumed that pseudoscopic effects\nwere not only robust and repeatable but could also be rapidly experienced. However, here we\nreport marked individual differences in both the timing and the nature of tele-pseudoscopic\nphenomena. If our findings using the Pope pseudoscope are generalizable to other\npseudoscopic viewing situations, then this would suggest that Stratton's (1898) proposed\nmethod for determining the limiting range of stereopsis maybe impractical/unworkable (at\nleast for many stereoscopic observers). However, it is possible that pseudoscopic latencies,\nthe range of subjective experiences, and even the proportions of reversers might be quite\ndifferent under different pseudoscopic viewing conditions--e.g., if the pseudoscopic viewing\nwas conducted with a normal, as opposed to exaggerated, interocular separation.\nIntriguingly, our field studies using tele-pseudostereopsis revealed complex perceptual\ninteractions between binocular and monocular scene processing. These interactions\nmanifested here as five discrete and identifiable categories of pseudoscopic phenomena:\napparent scene depth reversals, apparent object shape reversals, apparent size and flatness\nchanges, and apparent reversals in border ownership and even the experience of complex\nillusory foreground surfaces. The latency for experiencing pseudoscopic effects was found\nrepeatedly to vary significantly with visual acuity. We proposed that this relationship\nmight have been due to higher visual acuities assisting the pickup of disparity and\ndisparity gradient information, as well as the monocular processing of higher spatial\nfrequencies and texture gradients.\nThe Pope pseudoscope we used not only reversed and exaggerated available binocular\ndisparities but also altered the direction and magnitude of the vergence eye movements\nrequired to fixate different parts of the scene. Because we did not control for, or measure,\neye movements, we cannot distinguish between vergence and disparity based causes of the\ncurrent pseudoscopic effects. However, we suspect that the role of reversed stereopsis may\nhave been more important in our two field studies (as vergence appears to contribute little to\ndistance estimates beyond about 2 to 3 m, e.g., von Hofsten, 1976).\nIt is worth noting that in addition to conflicts between the (exaggerated \u00fe reversed/altered)\nbinocular and (natural) monocular depth/distance information in the current field studies,\ncognitive factors (such as prior knowledge and scene expectations) were also likely to have\ncompeted with the perception of the improbable shapes and depth relations generated by the\npseudoscopic viewing. This interplay and competition between conflicting perceptual and\ntop-down cognitive factors would undoubtedly be an interesting topic for future\npseudoscopic research.\n"
