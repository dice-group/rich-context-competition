This article compares patterns of association between cognitive functioning and a number of sociodemographic\nand health correlates among older persons in Taiwan and the United States.\nMethods. The study uses data from the 1993 Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan and the 1993\nStudy of Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old in the United States. Separate multivariate regression models\nare employed for each country to examine the effects of sociodemographic and health factors on cognitive functioning, and\nto examine the marginal impact of cognitive functioning on activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL)\nfunctioning.\nResults. Results of the multivariate analyses show similar patterns of association across the two countries and replicate findings\nfrom previous studies. Increasing age, female gender, lower education, depression, and selected health conditions are associated\nwith lower cognitive functioning. In addition, although a significant predictor of both ADL and IADL impairments, cognitive func-\ntioning is more powerful with respect to explaining IADL impairments.\nDiscussion. Study findings suggest that the cognitive measures are capturing similar dimensions in Taiwan and the United\nStates, and that factors associated with cognitive functioning and its consequences with respect to physical functioning are simi-\nlar in the two countries.\nTHOSE who have an interest in studying older adults have\nlong been aware of population aging, a term used to de-\nscribe the growth in the number and proportion of older per-\nsons that has been taking place in Western industrialized coun-\ntries throughout much of the 20th century. Population aging\nposes a number of challenges to society. For example, because\nhealth tends to deteriorate with advancing age, older adults are\nlikely to utilize health services and rely on formal and informal\nsources of support with greater frequency than younger per-\nsons. As a result, older persons account for a disproportionate\nshare of direct and indirect health care costs. Absent of revolu-\ntionary advances in medical technology that would alter the\naging process, population aging inevitably leads to heightened\ndemands for medical attention, increased caregiving burdens,\nand subsequent rises in the proportion of national budgets de-\nvoted to medical care. Thus, age structure changes taking place\nin the West have been accompanied by a growing concern\namong policy makers with respect to the health status of older\nadults.\nPopulation aging is now occurring across a substantial part\nof the non-Western world as well. Yet, despite these world-wide\naging trends, less attention has been devoted to older adults liv-\ning in non-Western societies. One of the reasons for this past\nneglect has been the absence of adequate data. However, recent\ndata collection efforts are making possible comprehensive re-\nsearch on health and aging issues across a variety of settings.\nComparative investigations that utilize these data are important\nfor assessing the generalizability of commonly held theories\nand hypotheses across diverse cultural and geographic settings,\nand the applicability of Western-developed policy in non-\nWestern settings. With this in mind, the aim of this research\nwas to compare the associations between measures of cognitive\nfunctioning and a number of demographic and health-related\nvariables across samples of older adults living in the United\nStates and Taiwan.\nBackground\nAs part of the population aging process, improvements in\nlife expectancy have resulted in a larger number and proportion\nof persons living to very old ages where the risk of dementia is\nHultsch, Hertzog, Small, McDonald-Miszczak, & Dixon, 1992;\nMcDonald-Miszczak, Hubley, & Hultsch, 1996). Although\nthere is substantial variability in estimates depending on study\nmethodology, the prevalence of dementia has been estimated to\nbe as high as 45% among those 85 years of age and older\n(Evans et al., 1990), making it one of the most prevalent chronic\nconditions among older adults.\nCognitive impairment has tremendous consequences for the\nability of older persons to function independently in their\nhomes and communities. In the United States, persons with\ncognitive disorders are much more likely than their cognitively\nintact peers to enter nursing homes and be hospitalized, and\nthey stay in hospitals for long periods of time (Weiler, Lubben,\nity of impairment is also related to hospitalization and length of\nstay, even the mildly impaired have high rates of utilization\n(Binder & Robins, 1990). Indirect costs, which include care-\ngiving burden on families and the resultant loss in productivity,\nare also consequential (Weiler, Chiriboga, & Black, 1994). In\naddition, studies have documented a strong association between\ncognitive impairment and rates of mortality (Kelman, Thomas,\nKennedy, & Cheng, 1994). Few assessments have brought to-\ngether these various direct and indirect costs, but one such\nstudy, conducted in 1985, estimated the total cost of senile de-\nmentia in the United States to be about $88 billion in that year\n(Huang, Cartwright, & Hu, 1988). Given the rapid rise in medi-\ncal costs and the increase in the proportion of older adults, we\nmay assume that current costs would exceed this estimate by a\nlarge margin.\nIn addition to the association with age, research has docu-\nmented a strong relationship between cognition and education\n(Frisoni, Rozzini, Bianchetti, & Trabucchi, 1993; Jorm et al.,\nUhlmann & Larson, 1991). According to Mortimer and Graves\n(1993), low levels of education may be the most significant risk\nfactor for cognitive impairment. Correlations between cognitive\nstatus and a number of other health factors also have been es-\ntablished. These include self-assessed health, health-related be-\nhaviors (Hultsch, Hammer, & Small, 1993), other psychiatric\ndisorders such as depression (Lichtenberg, Ross, Millis, &\nManning, 1995; Rummans, Smith, Lin, Waring, & Kokmen,\nnesses (Tranel, Benton, & Olson, 1997). Moreover, cognitive\nfunctioning is required for a variety of daily living tasks, in-\ncluding instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as\nshopping, managing finances, and preparing meals, as well as\nactivities of daily living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, and\neating. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated that cog-\nnitive status is highly predictive of IADLs (Fillenbaum,\nHughes, Heyman, George, & Blazer, 1988; Herzog & Wallace,\n1997) and more moderately predictive of ADLs (Gill, Williams,\nRichardson, Berkman, & Tinetti, 1997; Herzog & Wallace,\nUntil recently, sources of data on cognition were limited pri-\nmarily to clinically based studies conducted on convenience\nsamples. In recent years several population-based surveys have\nincorporated items from the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE;\nFolstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). In addition, a modified\nversion of the MMSE, referred to as the Telephone Interview\nfor Cognitive Status (TICS; Brandt, Spencer, & Folstein, 1988),\nhas been developed for use in telephone surveys. The measures\nincluded in the MMSE and TICS have been found to have high\ninternal and content validity in studies based in the United\nStates and other Western industrialized settings (Brandt et al.,\nNewman, Welsh, Helms, & Breitner, 1994), as well as several\nstudies that are based on Chinese populations (Chiu, Lee,\nnumerous United States and European studies to examine cor-\nrelations between cognitive impairment, demographic charac-\nteristics such as age and education (Hertzog & Schaie, 1988;\nLauner et al., 1993), and measures of health and physical func-\nAlthough several studies have attempted to ascertain the\nprevalence or incidence of dementia in Asian settings (Li et al.,\nto now, been very little research on factors associated with cog-\nnition in Asian societies (notable exceptions include Liang,\nYet, there is some urgency for such research in rapidly develop-\ning societies such as Taiwan and others in Eastern and South-\neast Asia. These societies have recently experienced reductions\nin fertility and mortality at unprecedented levels, the combina-\ntion of which will lead to a dramatic increase in their older pop-\nulations. In fact, nowhere in the world is population aging oc-\ncurring as rapidly as in East and Southeast Asia (Hermalin,\nthe oldest age structures in the world (Rowland, 1994) and will\nsoon be faced with a multitude of health care challenges.\nThe current investigation, which is comparative in nature,\nwill focus on the key sociodemographic, functional, and health\ncorrelates of cognitive functioning among older adults recently\nsurveyed in the United States and in Taiwan. A cross-country,\ncross-cultural comparison of this sort is useful for assessing the\ngeneralizability of findings from existing studies, most of which\nhave been based on Western populations. The similarity of the\ndesign and content of the Taiwan and United States surveys\nmakes this comparison particularly powerful. Our general hy-\npothesis in this study was that the correlates would be similar\nacross the two countries, in a manner consistent with those\nfound in previous studies. More specifically, we expected in-\ncreased age, low socioeconomic status, poor physical and emo-\ntional health, andriskyhealth-related behaviors to be associated\nwith lower levels of cognitive functioning in both Taiwan and\nthe United States.\nGiven the population aging that is occurring in Taiwan, we\nexpect the incidence and prevalence of cognitive disorder to\ngrow substantially in coming years. This suggests that, similar\nto the United States, cognitive impairment will become an in-\ncreasingly important issue for diagnosis and treatment in\nTaiwan. At the same time, there are distinct differences in fam-\nily organization and familial systems of support in Taiwan in\ncomparison to the United States. Family interactions in Taiwan\nare more frequent and instrumental, and a high percentage of\nolder persons coreside with and/or are cared for by their chil-\ndren (Hermalin, Ofstedal, & Chang, 1992). As such, the health\ncare of older adults is more likely to be viewed as a family-\nrelated concern and, at least at the present time, placement in care\nhomes is extremely rare. This places additional strains on indirect\ncaregiving costs, such as productive time lost. While today's\nTaiwanese households tend to be large in comparison to those in\nthe United States, current fertility rates translate into much\nsmaller families in the not-so-distant future, leaving fewer\nhousehold members available to care for the growing numbers\nof cognitively impaired older adults. Evaluating the current and\nfuture burden of cognitive impairment in Taiwan would seem\nto be a critical part of any health policy agenda. By gaining a\nbetter understanding of the factors that influence cognitive func-\ntioning through the forthcoming comparative analyses, we hope\nto come a step closer to this goal.\nMETHODS\nThis study draws on data from two different surveys of older\npersons, bom of which were conducted in 1993, one in Taiwan\nand the other in the United States. While the surveys differ to\nsome extent in terms of their design and questionnaire content,\nboth are designed to be nationally representative of the older\npopulation in their respective countries. In addition, each of the\nsurveys collects detailed information on health status, encom-\npassing the domains of physical, mental, and cognitive health\nand functioning.\nThe Taiwanese data come from the Survey of Health and\nLiving Status of the Elderly in Taiwan, a nationally representa-\ntive panel survey of 4,049 persons who were age 60 years and\ninterviews have been conducted as part of this study: three ex-\nto assess cognitive functioning was first introduced in the 1993\nwave, and it is this wave of data that is used in this study. The\nThe cognitive performance tests that were included in the\nTaiwan survey were drawn primarily from the MMSE and ad-\nministered during the interview as part of the health status sec-\ntion. Various versions of the MMSE have been utilized in com-\nbination with other cognitive tests to determine the prevalence\nof dementia in Chinese societies (Katzman et al., 1988; Salmon\nof the items in the MMSE are readily translatable into Chinese\nwithout loss of meaning. The Taiwanese survey employed in\nthis analysis was administered by the Taiwan Provincial\nInstitute of Family Planning. Researchers at this organization\ntranslated the items from the MMSE that were deemed most\nappropriate for the Taiwanese context. The chosen tests re-\nquested respondents to recall their address, the current date\n(day, month, and year), day of the week, their mother's maiden\nname, their current age and birth date, and the current and last\npresident of Taiwan. Each of these items was recorded by the\ninterviewer as having been reported correctly or incorrectly.\nThe first six of these items are measures of orientation and the\nlatter two are measures of knowledge. In addition, as a measure\nof working memory, respondents were posed with a serial arith-\nmetic problem for which they were asked to subtract from 20\nby 3 a total offivetimes. Those performing all five subtractions\ncorrectly were recorded as having completed the task correctly.\nNonresponses on the individual cognitive items (i.e., don't\nknow, refusal, not ascertained) were recoded as incorrect re-\nsponses for purposes of this analysis, as is often done in analy-\nses using the MMSE (Fillenbaum et al., 1988; Herzog &\nData for the United States come from the Study of Asset and\nHealth Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD; Soldo,\nHurd, Rodgers, & Wallace, 1997). AHEAD is a nationally rep-\nresentative panel survey of persons age 70 years and over and\ntheir spouses (of any age) in the United States. The baseline\nand over), representing a response rate of 80%. Three waves of\nand 1998. Data from the baseline wave of AHEAD are used in\nthis analysis.\nAlthough the cognition battery used in AHEAD was more\nextensive overall, several items are similar to those asked in the\nTaiwan survey. These include the date, day of week, and cur-\nrent president of the United States. AHEAD also asked respon-\ndents to name the current United States vice-president.\nAlthough this question is not equivalent to the question on for-\nmer president that was used in Taiwan, the two questions are\nthought to tap a similar cognitive domain, that relating to\nknowledge. Another test that is similar for the two surveys is\nthe serial subtraction exercise. In AHEAD respondents were\nasked to subtract from 100 by 7 a total of five times. Although\nwe have no way of evaluating the relative difficulty of the two\ntests directly we expect that, given the higher starting value\n(100 versus 20) and the higher value of the number that respon-\ndents are required to subtract by (7 versus 3), the AHEAD sub-\ntraction test was more difficult than the Taiwan subtraction test.\nAs will be shown later, the subtraction test was the only one for\nwhich the American respondents performed more poorly (sub-\nstantially so) than the Taiwanese respondents.\nIn addition to these comparable measures, AHEAD also in-\ncluded a backwards count exercise (respondents were instructed\nto count backwards from 20 as quickly as possible), two word\nrecognition questions (respondents were provided with descrip-\ntions of two different objects and asked to identify them); and\nboth immediate and delayed word recall tests, for which re-\nspondents were read a list of 10 words and were asked to repeat\nas many as they could remember immediately after the words\nwere read and again at the end of the cognition section. For pur-\nposes of this analysis, we utilize all of the AHEAD cognition\nmeasures except the immediate and delayed recall tests. As with\nthe Taiwan cognition measures, the set of cognition tests that\nwe use from AHEAD measure dimensions of orientation,\nknowledge, and working memory. The level of missing data\nwas again very low for the AHEAD cognition measures, and\nmissing values were imputed in the same way as for the Taiwan\nsurvey.\nGiven that our focus in this study was on general patterns of\nassociations between sociodemographic and health factors on\nthe one hand, and cognitive functioning on the other, the lack of\nprecise equivalence of the cognitive measures across countries\nis not a major concern. As long as the various sets of cognition\ntests that are employed in each country provide some differenti-\nation within the samples with respect to the underlying concept\nof interest (i.e., cognitive function), the actual tests need not be\nidentical for our purposes. In this regard, it is useful to note that\nfactor analyses performed on the two sets of cognition mea-\nsures produced only a single factor for each country, and the re-\nliability coefficient was similar for both (Cronbach's alpha =\nBecause the cognition measures are performance based, they\nwere administered only to self-respondents in both the Taiwan\nand United States surveys. Hence, our analysis necessarily ex-\ncludes persons interviewed by a proxy respondent (9% in\nTaiwan and 10% in the United States), who are likely to have\nhigher levels of cognitive impairment. Two other groups that\nmay be especially vulnerable to cognitive impairment and are\nalso excluded from this analysis are institutionalized persons\n(who were out of scope for AHEAD and, for comparability pur-\nposes, were excluded from the Taiwan analysis sample) and\nsurvey nonrespondents. Although the rate of institutionalization\nin each country is fairly low [less than 1% in Taiwan and 4% in\nthe United States for persons age 65 years and over (Strahan,\n1997)], those who reside in institutions tend to have a much\nhigher prevalence of cognitive impairment (Welsh et al., 1992).\nLikewise, poor health tends to be a common reason given for\nnonparticipation in surveys of older persons; hence, the nonre-\nspondents for these surveys are likely to be frailer, both cogni-\ntively and physically, than those who participated. As a result of\nthese exclusions, our results are likely to underestimate the level\nof cognitive impairment in both of the populations under study.\nHowever, our objective was not to assess absolute levels of cog-\nnitive functioning, but rather to compare the correlates of cog-\nnition across countries, and for this purpose the samples should\nbe satisfactory.\nIn thefirstpart of our analysis we examine and compare lev-\nels and distributions for individual tests and summary scores\nacross the surveys, and examine the age patterns for each of the\ncognitive measures. In the second stage, we employ multivari-\nate regression analysis and compare the associations of sociode-\nmographic, health, and health behavior characteristics with cog-\nnitive functioning across the two countries. Throughout our\nanalyses we run separate tabulations and regressions for each\ncountry. Both the Taiwan and AHEAD samples are restricted to\nself-respondents who were age 70 years and over and living in\nthe community at the time of the 1993 survey, yielding eligible\nTable 1 shows the sample distributions and means for the co-\nvariate and outcome variables that are included in the multivari-\nate analyses. The questions relating to each of the covariates\nwere very similar in the Taiwan and AHEAD surveys. Here we\nprovide a brief description of the variables before proceeding to\nthe multivariate results.\nThe variable for age measures the respondent's age at the\ntime of the interview and is represented as a categorical vari-\nable in the analyses (5-year age groups, with the 85+ group\nserving as the omitted group in the regression models). Gender\nis also represented as a dummy variable in the regression mod-\nels, with females serving as the omitted group. Because the\nsample distributions for number of years of completed educa-\ntion are quite different for Taiwan and the United States, and\nbecause a year of education may differ in terms of its impact on\ncognitive functioning in the two settings, we opted to use differ-\nent cutpoints for education in order to make the sample distri-\nbutions somewhat similar on the categorical variable.\nEthnicity was categorized into four groups in Taiwan\n(Mainlanders vs Fukienese, Hakka, and other) and three groups\nin the United States (non-Hispanic Whites vs non-Hispanic\nBlacks and Hispanics). In both Taiwan and the United States,\nethnicity can be used to control for unmeasured differentials\nwith respect to access to health care, quality of education, and\nother socioeconomic factors that might influence cognition.\nAlthough the ethnic distinctions in Taiwan are not as pro-\nnounced as in the United States, there are some socioeconomic\ndifferences across the ethnic groups represented here.\nMainlanders tend to be more advantaged than the other groups\nin terms of education and occupations that provide access to\nhealth care. Nonetheless, the fact that the ethnic differences in\nsocioeconomic status are less pronounced in Taiwan leads us to\nexpect smaller differentials in cognition across ethnic groups in\nTaiwan than in the United States.\nSelf-rated health is treated as a categorical variable ranging\nfrom 1 = excellent to 5 = poor; the omitted group in the regres-\nsion models comprises respondents who reported excellent\nhealth, and four dummy variables were included to represent\neach of the other categories. The questions on self-rated health\nTable 1.

The indicator for\nstroke comes from a set of questions on chronic conditions in\neach survey; in Taiwan, the question asked whether the respon-\ndent had ever had a stroke, and in the United States, whether\nthe respondent had ever been told by a doctor that he/she had a\nstroke. The questions on vision and hearing ask respondents in\nboth countries to rate their eyesight and hearing (in the pres-\nence of eyeglasses and/or hearing aids, if normally worn) on a\nscale of 1 = excellent to 5 = poor. These indicators were re-\ncoded as dichotomous variables for the analysis, with 1 indicat-\ning a fair or poor rating of eyesight/hearing and 0 indicating a\nrating of good to excellent. Current status was ascertained for\nsmoking and drinking in both surveys (in addition to chewing\nbetel for Taiwan). The variables used in our analyses simply in-\ndicate whether the respondent reported being a current smoker\nand current drinker (both coded 1 if yes, 0 otherwise) without\nregard to frequency or quantity of consumption.\nBoth the Taiwan and AHEAD surveys incorporated a subset\nof items from the Centers for Epidemiological Studies-\nDepression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), although the ques-\ntion wording, response categories, and number of items dif-\nfered slightly. The variables used in the analysis are simple\ncounts of the number of depressive symptoms reported on these\nitems, ranging from 0 to 5 for Taiwan and from 0 to 8 for\nAHEAD. Respondents with missing values on any individual\nitem were assigned a missing value on the count variable and\nexcluded from the analyses.\nThe measures of ADL and IADL functioning represent the\nnumber of impairments of each type that were reported by re-\nspondents. As with the CES-D, the question wording and items\ndiffered slightly across countries. Hence, in the AHEAD mod-\nels, impairment implies that the respondent either receives help,\nuses assistive devices, or has difficulty performing the activity,\nwhereas for the Taiwan models, respondents who reported hav-\ning any difficulty performing an activity are classified as im-\npaired on that particular item. For the ADLs, the same set of ac-\ntivities was included in both surveys; these included bathing,\ndressing, eating, walking, getting in and out of bed or chairs,\nand using a toilet (range 0-6). The IADL activities were slightly\ndifferent in the two surveys. In the Taiwan survey, the IADLs\nthat were measured include preparing meals, shopping, manag-\ning money, using a telephone, doing heavy housework, and\ndoing light housework (range 0-6); in the AHEAD survey, the\nIADLs include preparing meals, shopping, managing money,\nusing a telephone, and taking medication (range 0-5).\nLastly, with respect to cognition, in the multivariate analyses\nwe focus on a composite measure that incorporates the full\nrange of cognitive tests from the 1993 Taiwan survey (total of 9\nitems), and all except for the word recall tests from the AHEAD\nsurvey (8 items yielding a total possible score of 15). The mean\nvalues for the number of correct responses were 7.2 for the\nTaiwan sample and 12.0 for the United States sample, as shown\nin Table 1.\nRespondents who had missing values on any of the covari-\nates are excluded from all analyses presented in this article.\nRESULTS\nGeneral Levels and Distributions of the Cognitive Measures\nTable 2 presents the percentage of respondents who gave\ncorrect answers on individual cognitive performance tests, as\nwell as the mean number of correct responses on all tests com-\nbined. In general, the percentage reporting correct answers is\nquite high in both Taiwan and the United States, but is some-\nwhat higher in the United States on similar items. For example,\n76% of persons age 70+ in the United States were able to accu-\nrately report the date compared to 72% in Taiwan. Likewise,\n96% of elderly persons in the United States were able to name\nthe day of the week, compared to 89% of the Taiwanese. One\nexception to this pattern is the serial subtraction test, for which\nthe AHEAD percentage is about half that of Taiwan. As noted\nTable 2.

The patterns of cognitive\nperformance by age, also shown in Table 2, are in keeping with\nthe literature and consistent across items and countries. For\nevery item in both countries, the percentage of respondents who\ngave a correct response declines with increasing age. In Taiwan,\nthe largest decline appears to occur between the two youngest\nage groups, with the decline leveling off slightly after ages\n75-79. For the United States, in contrast, the decline is gener-\nally sharper between the middle and oldest age group than be-\ntween the youngest and middle age group.\nCorrelates of Cognitive Functioning\nIn addition to age, previous research has identified a number\nof key sociodemographic and health factors that are associated\nwith cognitive status. Some of these factors include education,\nself-assessed health, depression, chronic conditions (most no-\ntably stroke), functional impairments (hearing, vision, and\nphysical functioning), and health behaviors such as drinking\nand smoking. We turn now to multivariate analyses of these\ncorrelates of cognitive functioning for Taiwan and the United\nStates.\nAs a first step in the multivariate analysis, we model cogni- implies that individuals in the specified group had more errors\ntive functioning as an outcome and examine factors that are as- than those in the omitted group, other things being equal; or, for\nsociated with it. Table 3 presents ordinary least squares (OLS) continuous variables (e.g., depressive symptoms), that an in-\nregression coefficients for the effects of demographic and health crease in the independent variable is associated with an increase\nfactors on aggregate cognitive scores for the two countries.

All of these findings are consistent with the literature, as\nreviewed in the introduction.\nWith respect to education, in both Taiwan and the United\nStates the groups with lowest relative levels of education had\nsignificantly higher numbers of errors than those with moderate\nor high levels of education. Hence, despite the fact that elderly\nTaiwanese had substantially lower education overall than the\nUnited States elderly subjects, the association between educa-\ntion and cognition was notably consistent. As education has\nbeen shown to be an important factor in maintaining cognitive\nhealth, the lower levels of education in Taiwan may imply that\nthis cohort of Taiwanese elders is at greater risk of cognitive\nimpairment than elderly people in the United States. Although a\ncomparison of levels of cognitive function is not the main focus\nof this study, this would be consistent with our descriptive re-\nsults that showed overall lower percentages of correct responses\non similar items for the Taiwan sample.\nIn addition, the health factors show similar patterns of asso-\nciation, and patterns that are also consistent with previous re-\nsearch. Compared to persons who rated their health as excel-\nlent, those who reported poor health had significantly higher\nnumbers of errors. Similarly, stroke, depressive symptoms, and\nvision problems were associated with poorer cognitive func-\ntioning in both Taiwan and the United States. Taiwan also\nshows a significant association between hearing problems and\ncognition. Although the coefficient for the United States is in\nthe same direction, it is not statistically significant. On the other\nhand, smoking and drinking are associated with cognitive func-\ntioning in the United States, but these associations are not sig-\nnificant in Taiwan. Interestingly, whereas being a current\nsmoker is associated with a higher number of cognitive errors,\nalcohol consumption appears to have a protective effect in the\nUnited States. More in-depth analysis from the AHEAD study\nsuggests a U-shaped association between drinking and cogni-\ntion, whereby total abstinence is associated with lower cogni-\ntion, low and moderate levels of drinking with higher cognition,\nand high levels of drinking with lower cognition (Ofstedal &\nFor both countries, ethnicity showed a significant association\nwith cognition, with the most advantaged groups in terms of\nsocioeconomic status (Mainlanders in Taiwan and Whites in\nthe United States) having higher cognition scores (i.e., fewer er-\nrors) than other groups. However, the effect of ethnicity was\nmuch stronger in the United States, a finding that is consistent\nwith our expectation given the less pronounced socioeconomic\ndifferentials across ethnic groups in Taiwan.\nAs afinalpoint of comparison, we examined the association\nbetween cognition and physical functioning in the two coun-\ntries. We focused on two different measures of physical func-\ntioning--number of ADL and IADL impairments. OLS regres-\nsion was used to estimate the marginal effect of cognition on\nthe number of ADL and IADL impairments, controlling for key\nsociodemographic and health correlates of physical function-\ning. More specifically, we estimated one model that contains\nonly the control variables as predictors (i.e., the base model),\nand a second model in which we added the cognition score as a\npredictor (i.e., the cognitive model). As control variables, we\nused the same measures of age, gender, race/ethnicity, educa-\ntion, vision, hearing, depression, smoking, and drinking as in\nthe previous model, in addition to the number of chronic dis-\neases reported by the respondent. Because the dependent vari-\nables used in the OLS models are again quite skewed, we per-\nformed logistic regression analyses to predict any ADL and\nIADL impairment (as in Herzog & Wallace, 1997). The results\nof the logistic analyses were similar to the OLS results; again,\nfor ease of interpretation, we present the OLS results here.\nTable 4 shows the results of the pair of regression models for\nboth countries and summarizes the marginal contribution of\ncognition toward explaining the variance in ADL impairments.\nThe second to last row of the table presents the R2 values for the\nbase model and the cognitive model for both countries. The\nbottom row of the table shows the change in R2 produced by the\naddition of the cognition score in the model.\nOur primary interest in this set of analyses is on the effect of\ncognitive functioning on number of ADL impairments and the\namount of additional variance that is explained by the inclusion\nof the cognition score in the models. On these points, the re-\nsults presented in Table 4 suggest two keyfindings.First, as ev-\nidenced by the coefficients and standard errors for the cognitive\nscore variables, cognition is an important predictor of the num-\nber of ADL impairments. For both Taiwan and the United\nStates, an increase in cognitive functioning is associated with a\ndecline in the number of ADL impairments (t = -5.5, df - 1,\nStates). Despite the significance of the effect for the cognitive\nscore, adding cognition to the model does not increase the over-\nall explained variance in the number of ADL impairments by a\nthe United States as shown in Table 4).\nWith respect to the other predictors in the model, we observe\nstrong and expected effects of age, chronic conditions, vision\nimpairment, and depressive symptoms on the number of ADL\nimpairments. Gender shows an opposite effect in the two coun-\ntries, with males having higher numbers of ADL impairments\nthan females in Taiwan, and males having fewer impairments\nin the United States. Drinking alcoholic beverages is associated\nwith fewer ADL impairments in the United States, but not in\nTaiwan. The addition of cognition to the model had little im-\npact on the effects of these other factors.\nComparable models predicting IADL impairments are pre-\nsented in Table 5. These results show that the net effect of cog-\nnition is again highly significant in both countries (t = -14.7, df\nto the models predicting ADL impairment, however, the\namount of variance explained by the model is substantially in-\ncreased with the addition of the cognition variable (from .33 to\n.42 in Taiwan, and .19 to .23 in the United States). This sug-\ngests that cognition is more closely linked to IADL than to\nADL functioning among older persons in both of these settings.\nThe effects of sociodemographic and health factors are simi-\nlar to those observed for ADL impairment, with strong positive\neffects of age, multiple chronic conditions, vision and hearing\nimpairment, and depressive symptoms on the number of IADL\nimpairments. As suggested by the base model results, males\nhave fewer IADL impairments than females in Taiwan; how-\never, this effect disappears once cognition is taken into account.\nMore generally, the addition of cognition to the model tended\nto reduce the effects of the sociodemographic and health vari-\nables, but most remained statistically significant.\nTable 4.

Hence, it will be important to gain a better under-\nstanding of the prevalence of cognitive impairment, the factors\nthat precipitate it, and its consequences with respect to the need\nfor informal and formal care across many societies and cul-\ntures. In this study, we focused on comparing associations be-\ntween cognition and a number of factors rather than on com-\nparing levels of cognitive functioning, but we suggest the need\nfor further verification of cognitive tests across countries so that\nmore detailed comparative research can take place.\nOur objective was to compare associations between cogni-\ntive functioning and a number of covariates in samples of older\npersons in Taiwan and the United States and, in doing so, make\nuse of a relatively new and little studied set of data on cognition\nfrom a survey in Taiwan. The cognition measures that were in-\ncluded in the Taiwan and United States surveys, though not\nidentical, are derived primarily from the same source, the\nMMSE. The Taiwan survey utilized those tests from the MMSE\nthat were deemed to be most easily translatable into Chinese\nlanguage and culture. Several of these items (identification of\ncurrent day, month, year, day of week, president, and a subtrac-\ntion test) were also included in the AHEAD survey in the\nUnited States.\nThe analyses focus on an examination of the distribution of\nresponses for specific cognitive measures, overall and by age,\nand a comparison of associations between cognition and other\nfactors known to correlate with cognitive functioning, such as\neducation and ADL and IADL impairment. Although the ques-\ntions that are used to measure the covariates are similar across\nthe two surveys, there are some differences in distributions and\nTable 5.

For\ninstance, the distributions and/or distinctions for some demo-\ngraphic variables such as gender, education, and ethnic distribu-\ntion vary. We attempt to make these items as comparable as\npossible, for example, by dividing education into three cate-\ngories that more or less represent proportionate divisions of the\nsample, and by classifying race and ethnicity into the predomi-\nnant groups in the two societies. There are also differences in\nhealth behaviors such as smoking frequency, and there may be\ndifferences in the tendency to report chronic ailments or func-\ntional impairments.\nSuch variations by country could provide ready explanations\nfor any differences observed in the association between cogni-\ntion and these covariates. The differences in the educational at-\ntainment of Taiwanese and American elders, for example, might\nlead one to expect that the association between education and\ncognition would differ, perhaps showing a stronger association\nin Taiwan, where there is more variation in the type of educa-\ntion that older persons would have been exposed to during their\nyouth; in Taiwan, a much larger proportion of the older popula-\ntion did not receive any formal education at all. In the face of\nthese differences, then, the similarity that we observed in pat-\nterns of association between Taiwan and the United States seem\nto provide strong evidence of congruence in the determinants of\ncognitive impairment across the two societies. For instance, in\nboth Taiwan and the United States, performance on the cogni-\ntive tests declined with age and increased with education, pat-\nterns that have been well-established in numerous other studies.\nExamination of other factors that are associated with cognition\nas an outcome, and observed associations between cognition\nand ADL and IADL functioning also revealed findings that\nwere largely consistent across these two samples, as well as\nwith other studies in the United States and Western Europe.\nBoth the descriptive and multivariate analyses revealed age\npattern differences that warrant further investigation. In particu-\nlar, the steepest declines in cognition with age appear to take\nplace in the eighth decade of life in Taiwan (with regression co-\ngroup to -.23 for those age 75-79) and taper off thereafter.\nIndeed, the difference between 80-84-year-olds and 85+ year-\nolds is nonsignificant in Taiwan. In the United States, however,\nthere is relatively little difference in effects for 70-74-year-olds\nand 75-79-year-olds in comparison with the oldest age group,\nbut cognition appears to decline fairly sharply thereafter\nthrough the 80s and perhaps beyond. These differences may be\nattributable to instability in the Taiwan results given the rela-\ntively small number of persons age 80+ and especially 85+, to\ndifferences in the sets of cognition tests that were administered\nin the two countries, or they may reveal more fundamental dif-\nferences in the age patterns of cognitive decline in the two\ncountries. Given that there are sharp age differentials in educa-\ntional level among these elderly cohorts, it is also possible that\nour measures of education are not adequate to capture the full\ngradation of the education effect or that there are interaction ef-\nfects that account for the different age patterns across countries.\nAs a preliminary examination, we used a number of different\nclassifications of education and tested for interaction effects be-\ntween education and age in both countries. Regardless of how\neducation was classified in the models, the age patterns re-\nmained essentially unchanged, and none of the Education by\nAge interaction effects were significant. This topic is beyond\nthe scope of the current study, but is one that deserves more de-\ntailed focus in subsequent analyses.\nIt is also interesting to note that cognition appears to play a\nmuch larger role in IADL than in ADL functioning, as evi-\ndenced by the larger changes in R2 values in the IADL models.\nThis finding seems reasonable because the IADLs are thought\nto have a larger mental or cognitive component than the ADLs\n(Herzog & Wallace, 1997). Nevertheless, we must be careful\nwhen interpreting this difference. As mentioned previously, in-\nstitutionalized persons and those who were too frail to partici-\npate in the study were excluded from the samples, and these\ngroups tend to have high levels of ADL impairment. Had they\nbeen included in the studies, we may have seen a stronger asso-\nciation between cognition and ADL functioning than we ob-\nserve in these samples. Future research that incorporates the in-\nstitutionalized population will help shed some light on this set\nof associations.\nFinally, the results relating to ADL and IADL functioning\npoint out an unexpected contrast across countries. Tables 4 and\n5 showed that the total variance explained by the cognitive\nmodels was similar in the United States for the ADL and IADL\nmodel (.22 for ADL vs .23 for IADL), but differed greatly in\nTaiwan, where the explained variance was nearly three times\nhigher in the IADL compared with the ADL model (.16 for\nADL vs .42 for IADL). This suggests that there may be differ-\nences in the nature of these tasks and/or in the way in which\ncognitive impairment (as well as other covariates) impacts on\nthe various functioning tasks across cultures.\nDespite these interesting differences, the general patterns of\nassociation between cognitive functioning and the covariates\nexamined in this study are very similar for Taiwan and the\nUnited States. Thesefindingssuggest that the MMSE taps simi-\nlar dimensions of cognitive functioning in the two cultures, and\nthat it may serve as a useful model for assessing cognitive im-\npairment in other settings as well.\n"
