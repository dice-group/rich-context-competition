In addition to\nrespiratory events, emergence from general\nanaesthesia can occasionally result in\nundesirable side-effects such as agitation,\nabnormal hypertension or tachycardia, and\narrhythmia; such side-effects may cause\nbleeding from the surgical wound site and\nan increase in intracranial and intraocular\npressure.4\u00ad6 Noninvasive tracheal extuba-\ntion with minimal force is therefore import-\nant for avoiding circulatory and airway\ncollapse.\nThe angle of extraction of the tracheal\ntube may influence extubation force, but this\nhas only been evaluated in a single simula-\ntion study.7 We hypothesized that extraction\nforce would be lower when the tracheal tube\nis extracted at a smaller angle relative to the\nground than a vertical extubation at 90.\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate\nthe extraction force generated by different\nextubation angles using a manikin simula-\ntion and randomized clinical trial.\nPatients and methods\nManikin-based simulation\nThe Airway Management Trainer\u00d5 manikin\n(Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway), which is\ndesigned to represent the adult male anat-\nomy, was used for tracheal tube intubation\nand extubation simulations. A tracheal tube\nwith 8.5 mm internal diameter (Portex\u00d5 Soft\nSeal\u00d5, Smiths Medical, Ashford, UK) was\nplaced at the centre of the submandibular\narea, 24 cm from the incisors.8 No lubricant\nwas used. Extraction force was assessed at\nand 120 (relative to the ground) using a\nforce-measuring device (Digital Force\nGauge\u00d5, Shimpo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)\ntied tightly to the cuff of the tracheal tube.\nExtubation angles were confirmed as shown\nin Figure 1. The head of the manikin was\nfixed in neutral position with cohesive tape.\nThe tracheal tube was removed 10 times at\neach angle, with the same individual per-\nforming all extubations (R.M.).\nRandomized clinical trial\nStudy population. The study recruited patients\nscheduled for general anaesthesia with tra-\ncheal intubation at Osaka Medical College,\nobtained from the simulation study, patients\nwere assigned at random via an envelope\nmethod to undergo extubation at either 60\nor 90 relative to the ground (Figure 2).\nExclusion criteria were: contraindications to\nrapid induction (e.g., full stomach, gastro-\noesophageal reflux); anticipated difficulty\nwith airway (e.g., difficult head tilting or\nmouth opening); ischaemic heart disease;\ntooth instability.\nThis study was approved by the institu-\ntional review board of Osaka Medical\nCollege, Takatsuki, Japan (clinical trial\ninformed consent was obtained from each\npatient prior to enrolment.\nAnaesthesia and intubation. No premedication\nwas used. Percutaneous oxygen saturation,\ninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, electro-\ncardiography and end-tidal carbon dioxide\ntension were monitored for each patient\nusing standard techniques. Anaesthesia\nwas induced with 1\u00ad2 mg/kg propofol\nbolus or continuous target-controlled infu-\nsion and 0.3\u00ad0.5 mg/kg per min remifentanil.\nRocuronium 0.8\u00ad1.0 mg per kg was used as\nmuscle relaxant. A size 3 or 4 laryngoscope\nblade was used, according to the anaesthe-\ntist's preference.\nThe size of the tracheal tube (Portex Soft\nSeal\u00d5) was determined by the staff anaes-\nthetist using the formula: patient height/\n20 mm. The number of intubation trials was\nrecorded and Cormack's classification\nwas assessed. The tip of the tracheal tube\nwas placed $2 cm into the trachea with the\nindicator on the tracheal tube, then fixed at\nthe right side of the mouth using cohesive\ntape. Anaesthesia was maintained by con-\ntinuous administration of desflurane or\nsevoflurane, remifentanil and rocuronium\n(using standard procedures). The decision to\nuse epidural block, peripheral nerve block-\nade, continuous fentanyl administration or\nintravenous acetaminophen for postopera-\ntive analgesia was made by the anaesthetist.\nExtubation. At the end of surgery, the con-\ntinuous infusion of sedatives and analgesics\nwas stopped, and muscle relaxation was\nreversed with a sufficient dose of sugamma-\ndex, as recommended by the manufacturer\n(Merck & Co., Kenilworth, NJ, USA).\nWhile the patient was supine with the head\nat a neutral position, the fixation tape was\nremoved, the tracheal tube was moved to the\ncentre of the submandibular area, and the\nFigure 1.

Mechanical\nventilation continued until the patient\nregained consciousness and breathed spon-\ntaneously (with care taken to not exceed\n40 mmHg end-tidal carbon dioxide), at\nwhich point the patient was instructed to\nopen his/her mouth widely and extubation\nwas performed. The extubation angle was\nguided by the same indicator as used in the\nsimulation study (Figure 1c). Force meas-\nurement was performed by two anaesthetists\neach with >8 years' experience (R.M.,\nN.K.). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), dia-\nstolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate\nwere monitored before extubation (at tra-\ncheal tube cuff deflation) and after extuba-\ntion (maximum values during 60 s after\nextubation).

Patient demographic and\nclinical characteristics were compared using\n2-test and unpaired Mann\u00adWhitney U-test.\n2-test was used to assess postoperative\nhoarseness and pharyngeal pain. Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test was used to compare extu-\nbation force and vital signs (blood pressure\nand heart rate) in the randomized clinical\ntrial.

There was no significant difference in\nextraction force between 45 and 60. Based\non these findings, extubation angles of 60\nand 90 were chosen for the randomized\nclinical trial.\nRandomized clinical trial\nThe CONSORT flowchart for patient\nrecruitment is shown in Figure 3.

Conversely, delayed extubation is\nassociated with abnormal hypertension or\ntachycardia associated with cardiac and\nbrain morbidity, and frequent bagging can\nlead to pneumothorax and chronic obstruct-\nive pulmonary disease.11 Thus, smooth and\nnoninvasive extubation has long been a goal\nTable 1.

To our knowledge, ours is the first\nclinical trial to evaluate extraction force by\nextubation angle without fixation. The cur-\nrent simulation study indicated that extuba-\nrequired significantly less force than other\nangles. Based on these findings, we con-\nducted a randomized clinical trial to com-\nExtubation at 60 required significantly less\nforce than at 90, consistent with data from\nthe simulation study. Moreover, changes in\nSBP were larger when extubation was per-\nformed at 90 compared with 60, suggesting\nthat extubation at 60 is less invasive for\npatients than extubation at other angles.\nThis study has several limitations. First,\nthe use of a manikin simulation meant that\nfactors encountered in the clinical setting\n(such as saliva and sputum in the orophar-\nynx) were not adequately reflected.20\nSecondly, only one type of tracheal tube\nwas used. Several tracheal tubes with vari-\nous stiffness and shapes exist, and evaluating\ndifferences based on the type of tube may be\nwarranted.21 Thirdly, although simulation\nanalysis showed that an extubation angle of\n45 resulted in lower extraction force than\nother angles (with the exception of 60), the\nclinical evaluation was performed at 60 and\n90 only. The 60 angle was selected because\nthe median extraction force was slightly\nlower than at 45 in the simulation trial.\nRandomized clinical trials including 45\nangles may help to optimize noninvasive\nextubation. Finally, the precision of the\nforce-measuring device used in this study\nshould be taken into consideration, as well\nas measurement uncertainties resulting from\nmanual extubation. Further multicentre\nstudies or meta-analyses would help to\nvalidate our findings.\nIn conclusion, data from the simulation\nstudy indicate that extubation at 45 or 60\nrequires less force than extubation at 90.\nThis was confirmed by the randomized\nclinical trial, where extubation at 60\nrequired less force than 90, and was\naccompanied by less SBP elevations.\nExtubation at 60 is less invasive than\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
