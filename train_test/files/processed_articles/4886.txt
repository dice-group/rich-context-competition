Theories of culture have focused on showing the conditions under which\ncertain norms could have evolved (e.g., a reciprocity norm, Boyd and Richerson, 1988, or a\nnorm of altruistic punishment, Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson, 2003). Or they have\nstressed that random processes of imitation can give rise to some patterns of culture\n(Bentley, Hahn, and Shennan, 2004; Bentley, Lipo, Herzog, and Hahn, 2007; Shennan,\nHere the focus is on within-generation conflicts of interest over the construction of\nculture as it relates to the control of human behavior in economically advanced societies.\nThis perspective does not require any additional evolvability theory beyond previous work\n-- in particular, Boyd and Richerson's (1992) article showing that with punishment\nanything can evolve. The emphasis on conflict within societies is certainly in keeping with\ngeneral evolutionary considerations, since, in the absence of genetic identity, all organisms\nhave conflicts of interest. Therefore, it is not surprising that people may have conflicts of\ninterest over the construction of culture. More importantly for the present article is that\nhumans have perceived conflicts of interest over the construction of culture made possible\nby explicit processing. It is then important to determine whether and to what extent the\noutcome of cultural conflict may affect biological fitness. This perspective also leads to a\ncomplex view of the relationship between human interests as proposed by evolutionary\ntheory versus perceived interests that result from explicit processing.\nA conflict theory of culture also fits well with influential non-evolutionary theories\nof culture such as Marxism. Marxism posits that economically dominant classes construct\nculture to serve their interests. A conflict theory of culture also accords with common\nobservation of intense conflict over cultural issues (e.g., conflicts within legislative bodies\nover the teaching of evolution or prayer in public schools; conflicts over regulation of the\ncontent of media messages on aggression and sexuality). The idea of Kulturkampf is a\nwell-established and much-studied phenomenon in historical societies (e.g., Ross, 2000).\nThe present approach is compatible with definitions of culture proposed by\nevolutionists. Culture refers to \"information capable of affecting individuals' behavior that\nthey acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation, and other\nforms of social transmission\" (Richerson and Boyd, 2005, p. 8). Sperber and Hirschfeld's\n(2004) definition of culture is similar, but they also emphasize that the information\ncharacteristic of culture is of general relevance to group members and that it is represented\nin people's minds and expressed in their behaviors and interactions. The present article\nexpands on the mechanism for the production of culture, with the result that there is a\ngreater understanding of the types of information that may be transmitted to others and a\ngreater understanding of how this information may affect behavior -- in particular the\ncontrol function that cultural information may exert over human behavior.\nBecause of their interest in cultural transmission, evolutionary models of culture\nhave tended to emphasize social learning (e.g., Richerson and Boyd, 2005) and paid less\nattention to mechanisms underlying the production of culture. Richerson and Boyd (2005)\ndiscuss operant conditioning as a mechanism for producing culture, followed by social\nlearning for cultural transmission. Tooby and Cosmides (1992) propose that the\nmechanisms underlying the production of culture are modular, domain-specific\nConflict theory of culture\npsychological adaptations interacting with local variation. Sperber and Hirschfeld (1999,\n2004) expand on this perspective by showing that cultural variation can arise when\nartificial culture-specific input meets the domain-specific input requirements of the\nmodules. Thus, the biological kinds module may be expanded beyond personally\nexperienced animals to extinct animals like dinosaurs or imaginary creatures like dragons;\nmoreover, the image of particular animals (e.g., the wolf as a dangerous predator) may be\nelaborated as a result of social communication.\nThis article expands on these mechanisms of cultural production. It is proposed that\nthe psychological tools required to understand cultural conflict and its role in the control of\nbehavior in economically advanced societies are general intelligence and, in particular,\nexplicit processing. Explicit processing underlies humans' ability to regulate evolved\nmodular mechanisms related, for example, to aggression, ethnocentrism, and sexuality in\naccordance with culturally constructed norms and culturally constructed cost/benefit payoff\nschedules. Moreover, explicit processing enables explicit construals of the costs and\nbenefits associated with different cultural alternatives, and thus motivates behavior that\nattempts to influence culture. The result is a theory of culture in which humans are creative,\nintentional originators of culture that serves their perceived interests.\nExplicit processing therefore gives rise to the possibility of characteristically human\nsocial controls (e.g., bureaucracies, legal systems) and ideologies (religious beliefs,\npolitical ideology) that are able to regulate behavior within a particular historical context, at\ntimes in ways that conflict with predispositions resulting from human evolved psychology.\nDiscussion deals with the implications of this model for group selection, cultural\ntransmission, and the various types of conflicts of interest apparent in conflicts over the\nconstruction of culture.\nPsychology and the generation of culture: General intelligence and explicit processing\nGeneral intelligence\nHuman culture far exceeds anything found among animals. Cultural artifacts\ninclude a very wide range of technological innovations that cannot possibly be explained\nby mechanisms that are well known to exist among animals, such as operant and classical\nconditioning. Moreover, the cultural conflict theory developed below requires that humans\nat times make plans to influence culture (e.g., advertizing commercial products or\npromoting political candidates); humans also develop explicit theories of the possible costs\nand benefits of particular cultural forms and often act accordingly.\nEvolutionary theories of culture have considered the possibility that domain general\nmechanisms of general intelligence are important for the generation of culture (Chiappe\nStanovich, 2004). This section fleshes out this proposal by briefly reviewing particular\nmechanisms of human intelligence revealed by current research and how they are involved\nin the production of culture.\nResearch on general intelligence shows that individual differences in intelligence\npredict the ability to attain goals in situations of minimal prior knowledge (Chiappe and\nMacDonald, 2005). For example, fluid intelligence is defined as \"reasoning abilities\n[consisting] of strategies, heuristics, and automatized systems that must be used in dealing\nwith `novel' problems, educing relations, and solving inductive, deductive, and conjunctive\nConflict theory of culture\nreasoning tasks\" (Horn and Hofer, 1992, p. 88). Intelligence therefore taps conscious,\nexplicit problem solving in situations in which past recurrences would be unhelpful, except\nperhaps by analogy or by induction, to the new situation.\nOne role of the executive functions associated with intelligence in solving novel\nproblems is to manage goals. This involves constructing, executing, and maintaining a\nmental plan of action during the solution of a novel problem (Carpenter et al., 1990). For\nexample, the Tower of Hanoi problem (in which participants must develop a plan for\nstacking rings in a particular configuration) requires that one to be able to activate multiple\nsub-goals and to keep track of the satisfaction of each of the sub-goals (Carpenter, Just, and\nMeans-end reasoning and visualizing goals are critical to the production of cultural\nartifacts in the real world. For example, a hunter faced with conditions where meat or fish\nis only available seasonally may imagine ways of storing and preserving food for those\ntimes of the year when the resource is not available. This implies that the hunter would\nhave to engage in mental time travel by being able to imagine that hunger will recur in the\nfuture and that it can be influenced by one's behavior in the present. The Bischof-K\u00f6hler\nhypothesis proposes that only humans can engage in mental time travel into the future\nbecause other species lack the ability to anticipate future need states (Bischof, 1980;\nK\u00f6hler, 1927; Suddendorf and Corballis, 1997). According to this hypothesis, animals may\nact to pursue current felt needs, but they do not act to anticipate predictable future needs\nsuch as assuaging hunger. For example, Cebus monkeys did not attempt to save or\npreserve food even though it was entirely predictable that they would be hungry the\nfollowing day (see Roberts, 2002). Nevertheless, it should be noted that Osvath (2009) has\ndescribed a chimpanzee who stockpiled stones to throw at zoo visitors in anticipation of an\nagitated mood state that accompanied the throwing activity.\nEngaging in this sort of mental time travel requires executive function ability. The\nhunter would have to suppress the current desire to consume or waste the food and would\nhave to imagine ways of preserving the food in a less appetizing form for later use. This\nimplies executive functions, including response inhibition (i.e., suppressing the urge to eat\nthe food immediately), response preparation (imagining a viable technique to preserve the\nfood), and the ability to integrate action across time in order to attain the goal of food\npreservation (Wynn and Coolidge, 2003, p. 4). It also implies robust executive processes of\nworking memory -- that is, the ability to keep information from various sources (including\ninformation from modular mechanisms such as spatial representations [Chiappe and\nsolve a problem.\nAnother ability critical to the production of human culture is analogical reasoning.\nAnalogical reasoning, which is correlated with general intelligence, draws parallels\nbetween novel problems and similar problems that have been solved in the past by\ntransferring knowledge across conceptual domains (e. g., Chiappe and MacDonald, 2005).\nAnalogical reasoning decontextualizes problems by stripping away irrelevant surface\nfeatures of problems to focus on commonalities and abstract rules. Analogies require that\nthe concepts and their properties be maintained in active state (implying executive\nprocesses of working memory) during the search for abstract similarities between the\ndomains. At the same time, potentially distracting features of the two domains must be\ncontrolled (Gentner and Holyoak, 1997). This process may result in new cultural categories\nConflict theory of culture\nas, for example, when the abstract concept of a wave is expanded from water waves to\nsound waves to light waves (Holyoak and Thagard, 1995). These new categories are often\nmore abstract than the source and target concepts originally involved (Glucksberg, 2001).\nThe implications for a theory of culture are clear. People are able to imagine\nalternative scenarios and are able to devise creative, novel solutions to attaining or avoiding\nthese scenarios, and they are able to use analogical reasoning to do so. This process creates\nnew cultural categories as well as new artifacts designed to achieve these solutions.\nExplicit processing\nThe research on general intelligence discussed above fits into a larger framework,\nthat of explicit processing. Two types of processing, implicit and explicit, may be\nImplicit processing is automatic, effortless, relatively fast, and involves parallel processing\nof large amounts of information.\nTable 1.

That is, modules are functionally specialized\nmechanisms that respond automatically to domain-relevant information. When the\nenvironment presents long-standing problems and recurrent cues relevant to solving them,\nthe best solution is to evolve modules specialized to handle specific inputs and generate\nFor example, the visual system of monkeys and humans contains numerous areas\nspecialized for responding to different aspects of environmental stimulation (e.g., cells\nsensitive to horizontal lines or to motion, respectively) (Zeki, 1993). Evolutionary\npsychologists have proposed a large number of modules, including modules for social\nConflict theory of culture\nExplicit processing is the opposite of implicit processing: conscious, controllable,\neffortful, relatively slow, and involves serial processing of relatively small amounts of\ninformation. Explicit processing is involved in the operation of the mechanisms of general\nintelligence described above; that is, it is involved in mental time travel, the creation of\nhypothetical scenarios, and in planning for future contingencies. Explicit processing is\ncapable of utilizing linguistic input in order to produce explicit representations of context,\nincluding hypothetical representations of the possible consequences of actions.\nThe control processes associated with explicit processing are a relatively recent\nevolutionary innovation and may be uniquely human (Penn, Holyoak, and Povenelli, 2008).\nExplicit processing is centered in the prefrontal cortex which is at the apex of a hierarchy of\nprocesses that enables top-down control of behavior. The trend in primate evolution has\nbeen to deemphasize parallel processing typical of modules, \"with widely converging and\ndiverging connections between individual neurons,\" in favor of a serial, hierarchical design\nof top-down control of behavior that attempts to match behavior to intentions (Striedter,\nA critical point for an evolutionary theory of culture is that explicit processing is\nable to regulate and control, at least to some extent (depending at least partly on individual\ndifferences related to the personality trait of Effortful Control/Conscientiousness), the\nimplicit processing characteristic of evolved modules (MacDonald, 2008). A similar\nphenomenon can be seen in the area of intelligence research. Humans can control\nautomatic, heuristic processing and make decisions that depend on explicit processing.\nControlling heuristic processing requires effortful, controlled problem solving and makes\ndemands on attention and working memory resources. Stanovich (1999) provides evidence\nthat people with higher general intelligence are better able to selectively control heuristic,\nautomatic, socially contextualized processing. For example, people with higher general\nintelligence are more likely to give the logically correct response on abstract versions of the\nWason Selection Task.1 While the great majority of people respond correctly if the\nproblem is phrased as a social exchange problem (Cosmides, 1989), correct responses on\nabstract versions of the task are correlated with higher IQ (Stanovich and West, 2000).\nCorrect responses require controlling automatic but illogical responses based on surface\nlinguistic similarities (Stanovich, 1999).\nSimilarly, drawing logical inferences from a syllogism with false premises requires\ncreating counterfactual mental models and inhibiting a natural tendency for concrete\nthinking. That is, people tend to contextualize problems with as much prior knowledge as is\neasily accessible, even when problems are formal and the only solution is a content-free\nrule. The mental models involved in explicit problem solving include explicitly represented\ninformation involving language or images (Johnson-Laird, 1983).\n1 In abstract versions of the Wason Selection Task, subjects are asked how to falsify an \"if p, then q\"\nstatement. For example, subjects are shown a set of four cards placed on a table each of which has a number\non one side and a colored patch on the other side. The visible faces of the cards show 3, 8, red and brown. The\nsubject is then asked which cards should be turned over in order to test the truth of the proposition that if a\ncard shows an even number on one face, it has red on the other.\nConflict theory of culture\nThis type of logical reasoning is a critical component of the cultural production of\nmathematical and scientific knowledge aimed at finding abstract general laws as opposed to\nthe socially bound, concrete, context-bound specificity of much everyday reasoning.\nExplicit control of implicit processing goes far beyond the sorts of problems\nencountered in intelligence research to the control of internal feeling states and behavior\nbased on explicit representations of cultural contingencies, including social norms\n(MacDonald, 2008). The basic logic is as follows: Evolutionary regularities result in\naffective states as a cue to action (Wilson, 1975). For example, evolutionary theories of\nfear propose that recurrent cues to danger (intense stimulation such as loud noises,\nevolutionary dangers such as snakes and heights, and social stimuli such as strangers or\nbeing left alone during infancy) are natural cues producing the affective state of fear\n(Bowlby, 1969; Gray, 1987). These affective states are emotional reflexes--the result of\nimplicit processing utilizing thalamic pathways directly to the amygdala (LeDoux, 2000).\nHowever, these emotional reflexes are subject to effortful control via explicit\nprocessing. The inputs to these explicit processing mechanisms include a very wide range\nof non-recurrent information--that is, information resulting not from evolutionary\nregularities (as in the prototypical modular mechanisms described by evolutionary\npsychologists) but from explicit appraisals of costs and benefits. These explicit appraisals\nare based on representations of context and they are sensitive to rapidly changing and\nunique cultural contexts rather than contexts that were recurrent over evolutionary time.\nAs indicated above, general intelligence is associated with the ability to control\nautomatic, heuristic processing, and this ability requires decoupling from experience and\nforming mental models of hypothetical situations (Geary, 2005). In the effortful control of\nsocioaffective behavior, the mental models typically involve explicit representations of the\ncosts and benefits of behavior, and the prototypical conflict is between the phenomenal\noutput of socioaffective implicit processing (e.g., negative feelings toward racial\noutgroups) and symbolic representations of the world (e.g., awareness of norms of\nappropriate attitudes toward racial outgroups). The latter are open-ended--constantly\nchanging as a result of scientific advances, changes in laws and customs, and changes in\nbeliefs and attitudes.\nThis implies that explicitly represented, linguistically formatted cultural\nrepresentations may operate to control behavior. Consider an example of psychological\nconflict (see Morsella, 2005), such as a desire for food and a concurrent fear of predation\nbecause the food is located in an area frequented by predators. For most animals, such\nconflict is resolved simply by the summed strength of the competing implicitly processed\naction tendencies (hunger versus fear). This is a standard ethological account (e.g., Goetz\n(see Gray and McNaughton, 1996) comparator model in which signals from approach and\navoidance systems are compared for their relative strength.\nFor humans, the outcome of such conflicts may also be influenced by explicit\nappraisals of the context: Is it possible to control or eradicate the predators using a\ntechnological innovation? Is eating the food taboo because of religious beliefs? Are there\nlaws against harvesting the food so that taking the food would incur a risk of fines or a\nprison sentence? Conflict occurs not only because of conflicting signals from modules;\nthere may also be conflicts between the output of modules and symbolic representations of\nthe context.\nConflict theory of culture\nWhile evolved modules are adaptations to environmental recurrences over\nevolutionary time, these symbolic representations are not responses to recurrent\nenvironmental features over evolutionary time, nor are they typically constrained by natural\nselection. For example, the symbolic representations that imbue the food with religious\nsignificance or that affect its legal status are not adaptations resulting from environmental\nregularities over evolutionary time--the formal requirement for adaptations adopted by\nevolutionary psychologists (e.g., Tooby and Cosmides, 1992).\nThese explicit assessments of costs and benefits need not be true and they need not\nbe adaptive. For example, in the food example, explicitly held religious beliefs may be a\nreason for performing a certain behavior without the belief being true. Religious beliefs\nmay be manifestly maladaptive, as Richard Alexander (1979) noted in commenting on the\nShakers, a group that believed in strict celibacy. Or religious beliefs may be evolutionarily\nadaptive, as indicated, for example, by the finding that Mormons tend to have high fertility\nThe following briefly considers the interplay between implicit processing and\nexplicit appraisals of cultural context in the areas of aggression and ethnocentrism (see\n1. Aggression. Affective states resulting from evolutionary regularities place\npeople in a prepotently aggressive state. Thus, Buss's (2005) evolutionary theory of\naggression proposes that evolutionary regularities in the context of mating result in\naffective cues of sexual jealousy and anger at romantic rivals that are prepotent cues\nfor aggression. However, whether or not aggression actually occurs may also be\ninfluenced by explicit evaluation of the wider cultural context, including explicit\nevaluation of the possible costs and benefits of the aggressive act (e.g., penalties at\nlaw, likelihood of detection and arrest given the state of forensic technology,\nsecurity cameras, etc.)\nPeople with sufficient levels of effortful control are able to effectively\ncontrol their aggression in a manner that is thoughtful and reflective rather than\nimpulsive. Thus Raine et al. (1998) found that impulsive murderers had relatively\nweak prefrontal control over subcortical regions linked to aggression. In contrast,\npredatory murderers whose crimes involved planning and deliberation had\nprefrontal functioning that was more equivalent to normal subjects, while also\nhaving high levels of subcortical activity linked to aggression. Results \"support the\nhypothesis that emotional, unplanned impulsive murderers are less able to regulate\nand control aggressive impulses generated from subcortical structures due to\ndeficient prefrontal regulation\" (p. 319). Other data show that non-impulsive\ncriminals take into account a variety of symbolically generated costs and benefits\nwhen making decisions on whether to commit criminal acts (see MacDonald, 2008).\nThese explicitly calculated costs and benefits are not recurrent over\nevolutionary time but are the result of explicit appraisals of current cultural contexts\nand producing mental models of possible consequences of behavior. Thus a\ncriminal would be well advised to understand the various technological innovations\nthat make detection easier, such as DNA fingerprinting. The cultural environment\nrelated to criminal detection and punishment is constantly changing and can only be\nappraised using mechanisms of explicit processing.\nConflict theory of culture\n2. Ethnocentrism. People tend to have implicit negative attitudes toward\npeople of other races and ethnic groups--attitudes that may result from\nevolutionary adaptations (e.g., social identity mechanisms; see MacDonald, 2008)\nor from learned associations such as social learning or spreading activation--the\nstandard view of social psychology (e.g., Blair, 2001; Monteith and Voils, 2001). In\neither case, explicitly represented goals are able to control implicit negative\nattitudes toward racial outgroups originating in the amygdala (Wheeler and Fiske,\nstronger subcortical (amygdalar) response to photos of Blacks than Whites if the\nphotos were displayed for a very short period of time (30 msec) insufficient to be\nrepresented explicitly in the prefrontal area. But when the photos were displayed for\na period (525 msec) sufficiently long to be explicitly represented in the prefrontal\narea, this difference in reaction to Black and White faces decreased, and the\nprefrontal region was activated. Results indicate \"that controlled [i.e., explicit]\nprocessing can moderate, and even override, activity that would otherwise result\nExplicit cultural norms related to ethnocentrism and awareness of the costs\ninvolved in violating those norms are important input to prefrontal control\nmechanisms that operate via explicit processing. For example, White subjects who\nare told they are violating cultural norms of racial egalitarianism inhibit ongoing\nbehavior in an attempt to bring responses more in line with cultural and personal\nnorms (Monteith, Ashburn-Nardo, Voils and Czopp, 2002). That is, explicit\ninformation about subjects' automatic stereotyping that is incongruent with their\nexpressed attitudes leads to longer response times as subjects attempt to bring\nresponses in line with their explicitly expressed attitudes. Explicit control of\nimplicit processing related to ethnocentrism is cognitively costly for subjects with\nstrong implicit biases toward outgroups (Richeson and Shelton, 2003; Richeson,\nTrawalter, and Shelton, 2005). Moreover, cognitive distractions increase the\nimplicit pro-White bias of White subjects (e.g., Devine, Plant, Amodio, Harmon-\nJones, and Vance , 2002). In general, these results indicate that people with strong\nimplicit biases rely on controlled processing resources to manage negative thoughts\nand stereotypes of the outgroup, but doing so depletes cognitive resources.\nIn conclusion, this discussion gives some indication of a rather complex psychology\nof culture involving analogical reasoning, means-end reasoning, the creation of mental\nmodels, and conflicts between implicit and explicit processing.\nThe perspective sketched here is compatible with evolutionary models of culture\nthat see culture as an independent force in evolution (e.g., Richerson and Boyd, 2005). A\nmajor implication is indeterminacy. Rather than determined by universal psychological\nmechanisms interacting with ecological contingencies (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992), the\nexplicit processing involved in human intelligence and in the regulation of evolved modular\npredispositions is creative and improvisational. Analogical reasoning and mental models of\nhypothetical future events are creative products of explicit processing, and they often result\nin novel artifacts capable of solving the ancient problems of survival and reproduction in\nnovel ways. Or they may be used to write a sonnet or a symphony. These mechanisms also\nserve as the underpinnings of the artistic imagination capable of creating imaginary people,\nConflict theory of culture\nrelationships, events, and even impossible worlds. Finally, explicit processing enables\nactive attempts to construct culture in accordance with explicit perceptions of possible costs\nand benefits--the topic of the next section.\nFrom psychology to history: Social controls and ideologies\nRicherson and Boyd (2005, p. 95) point out that historical events are \"embedded in\na complex, historically conditioned frame, and all causes of events are local to that frame.\"\nThis is quite correct. Nevertheless, equipped with an understanding of the psychology of\nexplicit processing, it is possible to pinpoint two deeply interwoven but independent\nprocesses that are of general importance for developing a conflict theory of culture:\nideology and social controls.\nSocial controls\nSocial controls are restrictions imposed on people as a consequence of their\nthe literature on models of the evolution of culture, social controls are norms that involve\npunishment for transgressions (e.g., Boyd and Richerson, 1992; Henrich and Henrich,\n2007). At the theoretical level, the theory of social controls depends on a classic article by\nBoyd and Richerson (1992) showing that with punishment anything can evolve. That is,\npunishment can maintain any set of social norms, including individually costly behavior\nthat does not benefit either any individual or the group as a whole. This points up the fact\nthat social norms need not be adaptive (Alexander, 1979). Durham (1991) discusses how\nthe coercive imposition of cultural memes may result in the persistence of maladaptive\ncultural variants.\nImportantly, social controls may prevent individuals from engaging in behavior\nthey would otherwise engage in -- particularly behavior that would result from evolved\npsychological mechanisms in the absence of social controls. In the examples elaborated\nbelow, monogamy by wealthy, powerful males and altruistic, self-sacrificing behavior\nwithin groups are analyzed partly as the result of social controls.\nAs in the case of ideology (see below), it is important to distinguish the concept of\nsocial controls as used here from idiosyncratic controls that result from the behavior of\nindividuals without any social sanction. The difference is between, say, social controls and\nideology that enforce and rationalize the institution of slavery versus a private citizen\nholding another person captive against his will and exploiting him. The former is part of the\nlarger social context and may be enforced by powerful legal and military institutions, and\nsupported by the media, academia, and popular opinion. The latter is idiosyncratic,\nalthough, if an important person was the victim of such an idiosyncratic event, it could\ncertainly have historical consequences.\nIt is assumed here that animals are largely incapable of explicit processing (Penn,\nHolyoak, and Povinelli, 2008); in particular, they are incapable of linguistic and symbolic\nrepresentations that are capable of guiding and motivating behavior (MacDonald, 2008).\nThis does not imply that other organisms are incapable of evolving mechanisms that, for\nexample, are capable of efficiently regulating behavior in a group and, for example,\nproducing egalitarian outcomes. A prototype is the suppression of meiotic drive (see Frank,\n2003). However, meiotic drive operates in a quite different manner than social controls\nConflict theory of culture\noperating in human society.\nThe thesis here is that social controls and explicit ideologies that rationalize them\nare intertwined but independent processes in human societies. As conceptualized here, both\nof these processes require explicit processing -- a perspective implying that the social\ncontrols and ideologies discussed here are uniquely human.\nOne possibility for conceptualizing social controls derives from modeling of\naltruistic punishment as a mechanism for maintaining cooperation in groups. For example,\nBoyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson (2003; see also Henrich and Boyd, 2001) showed that\ncooperation can be sustained in large groups via altruistic punishment (i.e., punishment that\nincurs a cost for both the punisher and the one punished) in situations where defectors are\nrare and punishers common. These are models of idiosyncratic control because the model\nassumes that an individual punishes and incurs a cost for doing so that is not shared by\nother group members.\nIf explicit processing is added to the equation, things change considerably. Recent\nmodels of cooperation show that altruistic cooperation can be maintained if people have\naccess to explicit information on others' histories of interaction in cooperative situations\n(e.g., Henrich and Henrich, 2007; Milinski, Semmann, and Krambeck, 2003; Mohtashemi\nSemmann, Krambeck, and Milinski (2005) showed that participants were more likely to\nreward people with whom they had no direct experience if these people had developed a\ngood reputation based on their previous behavior in a public goods experiment. In this\nexperiment, people's reputation was made available by displaying a written record of their\nbehavior on a computer screen. Other sources of explicit information on the reputation of\nindividuals include verbal communication and written records. As Mohtashemi and Mui\nand Boyd, 2003; Smith, 2003) note, information on others' reputations constitutes a\ncollective memory of the past history of individuals made possible by language -- that is,\nexplicit representations of the past history of individuals in cooperative situations. In fact,\nexplicit agreements to cooperate made prior to the prisoner's dilemma game result in\nincreases in cooperation and decreases in competition during the game (DeBacker and\nReputation is a social, not an idiosyncratic, phenomenon. That is, reputation\nconsists of explicit representations of the past history of others that are held by a significant\ngroup of people. The costs of transmitting reputation are minimal, but reputation raises the\ncost of defection because it makes it unlikely that a defector will receive indirect\nreciprocity in the future (Semmann, Krambeck, and Milinski, 2005). In effect, the non-\ncooperator is ostracized in future interactions, not only with the people with whom he has\nhad direct dealings, but also with those among whom his reputation as a non-cooperator has\nbecome known.\nReputation is also likely to lower the cost of punishing because the behavior of\ndefectors can be quickly and widely known at minimal cost, thereby facilitating measures\nthat spread the costs of punishment among the cooperators. \"Posse\"\u00adtype coalitions of\npunishers are able to inflict punishment on defectors while sharing the costs. Indeed, the\nethnographic record shows that people readily band together to prevent despotic\ndomination and free-riding. Human hunter-gatherer groups exhibit an \"egalitarian ethic\" in\nwhich people band together to circumscribe the power of leaders and punish free-riders\nConflict theory of culture\ngossip and withholding social benefits, are usually sufficient to control would-be\ndominators, but more costly measures, such as ostracism and execution, are recorded in the\nethnographic literature.\nSimilarly, social controls operating within historically important groups are able to\npunish free-riders and enforce high levels of within-group charity (MacDonald, 1994; D. S.\nWilson, 2002). For example, among Calvinists in 16th-century Geneva, those who violated\nreligious norms were subjected to an escalating set of penalties ranging from private\n\"brotherly admonitions\" from the pastor, to public forms of shaming, and finally to\nexcommunication which would mean expulsion from the city (D. S. Wilson, 2002).\nIn modern states, the police and the judicial system are empowered to punish non-\ncooperators. The costs for these enforcement institutions are not borne by individual\npunishers but are widely shared as a result of tax collection systems that are enabled by\nexplicit processing. That is, the system depends on prospective defectors making explicit\ncalculations of the possible costs (e.g., likelihood of a prison sentence) and benefits (e.g.,\nlikelihood of financial gain) to their actions in a situation with a host of features that were\nnot recurrent over evolutionary time (e.g., electronic surveillance methods, legal\nmechanisms to enforce payment of taxes, etc.) (MacDonald, 2008).\nThe social controls that actually come to prevail in a particular society are often the\nresult of conflicts of interest whose outcome is underdetermined by evolutionary theory.\nBasic evolutionary theory implies that, in the absence of genetic identity, there are conflicts\nof interest among individuals. In particular, there are conflicts of interest over social\ncontrols -- which behaviors are controlled, who benefits from the controls (e.g., different\ncontrols may benefit wealthy, powerful males, lower status males, or the group as a whole),\nand whose individually adaptive behavior is constrained by the controls.\nParticularly interesting from an evolutionary perspective are social controls that\nestablish and maintain egalitarian versus anti-egalitarian economic or mating patterns.\nEvolutionary theory is highly compatible with the proposition that males within a society\nhave conflicts of interest regarding the regulation of reproduction. In general, wealthy,\npowerful males benefit from unfettered access to large numbers of females because they\ncan support multiple mates and provide adequately for their children. However, their doing\nso opposes the interests of non-wealthy males, since intensive polygyny by wealthy males\nmakes fecund females a scarce resource for which they are ill-equipped to compete. These\nnon-wealthy males would benefit from establishing a more egalitarian mating system.\nMonogamy qualifies as a relatively egalitarian mating system since wealthy males are\nprevented from maximizing their reproductive success by having concubines.\nAn interest on the part of non-wealthy males in establishing an egalitarian mating\nsystem is therefore highly consistent with the principle of self-interest and the other central\ntendencies of human behavior predicted by evolutionary theory. Evolutionary theory is\ncompatible with the idea that humans will not only attempt to maximize their own\nreproductive success but also with attempts to minimize the negative differential between\ntheir own success and that of others. One way of accomplishing this latter goal is to\ncooperate with others in an attempt to impose egalitarian social controls on the variance in\nmale reproductive success. Such a strategy of cooperation in an egalitarian group is\nexpected to be the first choice of a relatively low ranking male, and in fact low-ranking\nConflict theory of culture\nmales are far more likely than wealthy males to have been supporters of economically\negalitarian (socialist) revolutions in the, 20th century (e. g., the Soviet Union, China, and\nCuba).\nEvolutionary theory (in combination with any known ecological variables or any set\nof universal, evolved psychological mechanisms) fails to predict the outcome of this\nconflict. The general finding that wealthy males in stratified societies tend to be intensively\npolygynous is not surprising given the evolutionary theory of sex and the fact that\ndespotism with intensive polygyny may be viewed as an individually optimal male\nreproductive strategy (Dickemann, 1979). This finding must, however, be viewed as a\nprobabilistic rather than a determinate result.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, it is not the least surprising that conflicts of\ninterest regarding the regulation of mating or economic activity occur in human societies.\nSocial controls supporting mating or economic systems can vary along a continuum\nranging from egalitarian to anti-egalitarian, and these different types of social controls are\nin the interests of different individual members of human societies. The successful\nimposition of social controls on others is always a possibility, but there is no reason to\nsuppose that it is a necessity: If the Czar had won the war of the Bolshevik Revolution, no\nevolutionary or ecological laws would have been broken, and there would be no violation\nof any of the principles of evolutionary psychology. Historical events are indeed locally\nembedded (Richerson and Boyd, 2005) and influenced by events such as which army has\nbetter weaponry and tactics.\nHowever, the success of the revolution resulted in a very different type of society,\nwith very different types of social control than would have occurred had the Czar won.\nMoreover, the success of the revolution affected the biological fitness of particular groups.\nThe Soviet government killed over 20 million of its own citizens, the vast majority in the\nfirst 25 years of its existence (Courtois, 1999). The previously dominant elites,\nbureaucracies, and commercial classes were purged, exiled, executed or imprisoned. If they\nremained in the USSR, they and their children suffered discrimination in employment and\nadmission to universities and government service (Slezkine, 2004). It was a 'state against its\npeople' (Werth 1999), mounting campaigns of collective punishment (usually involving\ndeportation or forced starvation) against a great many ethnic groups, including Great\nRussian peasants, Ukrainians, Cossacks, Chechens, Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans,\nMoldavians, Kalmyks, Karachai, Balkars, Ingush, Greeks, Bulgars, Crimean Armenians,\nSimilarly, the social imposition of monogamy doubtless affected the relative fitness\nof males within the society because the fertility of elite males was confined to monogamous\nmarriage with little possibility of divorce (MacDonald, 1995). At the extreme, social\ncontrols can institute a reproductive regime that dampens all sources of differences in\nreproductive success. An example is China's one-child policy: Despite difficulties in\nenforcement, the policy has succeeded in its policy aim of reducing population. Fertility\nhas been reduced to around 1.5 children per woman, far below replacement level\n(Baochang, Feng, Zhigang, and Erli, 2007). This implies that the social controls preventing\npeople from choosing their own fertility largely succeeded in dampening differences in\nreproductive success and achieving the societal (group) goal of below-replacement fertility.\nConflict theory of culture\nIdeology\nThe term `ideology' requires some comment. The psychological research on\nexplicit processing discussed above suggests defining ideologies as explicit belief systems\nthat may motivate behavior in a top-down manner. That is, explicit construals of the world\n-- for example, explicit construals of costs and benefits mediated in turn by human\nlanguage and the ability of humans to create explicit representations of events -- may\nmotivate behavior. However, in order to be interesting and important for thinking about\ncultural conflict in historical societies, the belief system must characterize a historically\nsignificant group. The attempt here is to pinpoint the concept of a coherent set of beliefs\nthat characterizes a significant group of people and motivates their behavior as described\nabove -- that is, top-down control of behavior via explicit processing.\nSuch a concept of ideology is differentiated from idiosyncratic beliefs. Idiosyncratic\nbeliefs are certainly important from the standpoint of psychological functioning of\nindividuals. However, in general, apart from the idiosyncrasies of particular powerful\npeople (e.g., an idiosyncratic superstitious belief by a military leader that results in victory\nor defeat in an important battle), they are not an important component of historical\nphenomena. Ideologies are important because they characterize significant groups. They\noften define the group to its members, regulate relationships among group members and\nwith non-group members, provide rationalizations for social controls, and explain the way\nthings are and how they came to be (and, in some cases, even describe the way things will\nbe after death).\nThis definition is essentially the same as that of Samuel P. Huntington (1957, p.\n454): \"By ideology I mean a system of ideas concerned with the distribution of political\nand social values and acquiesced in by a significant social group.\"\nThis concept of ideology is compatible with several other mainstream conceptions\nof ideology in political science. As Gerring (1997) notes, ideology has been defined in\nmany ways and has been used for many political and academic purposes over the centuries.\nAt their core, all reasonable definitions conceive ideology as a coherent set of beliefs\nreasonable to try to construct a single, all-purpose definition of ideology. For example,\nGerring, a political scientist, restricts ideology to the political realm and differentiates\nideology from the concepts of worldview, belief-system, cultural system, or value-system.\nSuch a restriction is not important for our purposes.\nIdeologies emphasize the idea that factors internal to the individual, such as an\nindividual's personal beliefs and attitudes, often rationalize behavior and provide a\nproximate mechanism of motivation. The basis for this claim is the above analysis of\nexplicit processing. That is, explicitly held beliefs are able to exert a control function over\nbehavior and over evolved predispositions, and they are able to exert this control function\nindependently of external processes of social control (e.g., punishment). For example, a\nperson may refrain from engaging in a particular behavior to which he is predisposed as a\nresult of evolved modules (e.g., various forms of aggression [Buss, 2005]), and he may do\nso because of he believes that he would be sent to prison, or because of he believes that he\nwill be punished for it in an afterlife, or because he believes that it violates an important\nmoral principle or God's law. The success of Calvinism in 16th-century Geneva depended\nnot only on the threat of externally applied sanctions, but also on the persuasiveness of the\nConflict theory of culture\nexplicit beliefs that constituted religious ideology (D. S. Wilson, 2002): Calvinists believed\nthat the strictures of their religion emanated from God and that to disobey them would\nresult in severe punishment in the afterlife. Without an internally motivated set of beliefs\nthat resulted in self-control for the great majority of the inhabitants of Geneva, the task of\ncontrolling a city of that size according to Calvinist principles would have been impossible.\nEvolutionary analyses of personal beliefs often propose that individuals tend to\nbelieve what is in their perceived self-interest (e.g., Wilson, 1978). For example, moral\nreasoning tends to reflect self-interest (Krebs, 2005; Krebs, Denton and Higgins, 1988;\nMacDonald, 1988). People tend to bias their moral judgments to favor self, relatives, and\nclose friends; and they often engage in rationalization and self-deception in order to\npresent their reasons in ways that present themselves in a positive light to significant others\nor to appeal to disinterested observers.\nNevertheless, beliefs and attitudes are products of explicit processing, so that there\nis no reason to expect a one-to-one correspondence between beliefs and self-interest\n(MacDonald, 2008). To the extent that beliefs are influenced by modular adaptations that\nreflect recurrences in the EEA, they may be maladaptive in the radically changed\nenvironments of the modern world. For example, there is evidence for modular\nmechanisms that influence male perceptions of female attractiveness resulting from natural\nselection for a correlation between fertility and attractiveness (Singh, 1993). These modular\nmechanisms may result in maladaptive negative appraisals of some women because they\nfail to reflect changes in fertility technology. Moreover, explicit processing is resource-\nlimited and fallible, so that explicitly held beliefs about anticipated consequences of one's\nactions may be inaccurate. One may have inaccurate beliefs about the costs or benefits of\nbehavior because of inaccurate or incomplete information about rapidly changing and\ncomplex modern environments.\nWhile individually held beliefs may well be maladaptive, there are special\nadditional reasons that may result in the maladaptiveness of ideologies for at least some of\nthe people who believe them. Together, these reasons indicate that ideologies are logically\nand psychologically separate from social controls. Like social controls, ideologies are\nlikely to be relatively insensitive to individual self-interest. Ideologies often characterize\nvirtually an entire society (e.g., communism as an official ideology in the USSR; the supra-\nethnic, supra-regional status of Christianity in medieval Europe [Lynch, 1992, p. 71;\nTellenbach, 1993, p. 58], or Islam as the official religion in some contemporary societies).\nIdeologies may also characterize the vast majority of people who belong to voluntary\nsubgroups within a society (e.g., a Protestant religious denomination in the United States).\nIn at least some cases, authorities (e.g., in a state such as the Soviet Union) are able to\npromulgate an ideology because of their control over education and the media, and they\nmay be able to punish dissenters because of their control over the police and the judicial\nsystem. As a result, individuals who do not benefit from adopting the ideology will be\nsocialized to do so or punished if they fail to publicly support the ideology. As discussed\nfurther below, ideologies are often intimately intertwined with various social controls --\nrationalizing the controls but also benefitting from the power of social controls to enforce\nideological conformity in the schools or in religious institutions.\nLike social controls, the imposition of ideology is the result of conflict within\nsocieties. As in the case of social controls and also because ideologies are so often\nintricately bound up with social controls, evolutionary theory is unable to predict which\nConflict theory of culture\nideology will prevail in a particular society. Ideologies may be egalitarian or anti-\negalitarian. They may promote the deregulation of human behavior or they may rationalize\nstrong social controls on behavior. As in the case of social controls, if the Czar had won the\nwar of the Bolshevik Revolution, no evolutionary or ecological laws would have been\nbroken, and there would be no violation of anything we know about evolutionary\npsychology. However, the success of the revolution resulted in a very different type of\nsociety, with a very different official ideology than would have occurred had the Czar won.\nIndeed, as noted in Resolution 1481 of the Council of Europe (Council of Europe,\n2006), mass murder was a well-articulated aspect of the ideology of communism:\nThe crimes [of communism] were justified in the name of the class struggle theory\nand the principle of dictatorship of the proletariat. The interpretation of both\nprinciples legitimised the \"elimination\" of people who were considered harmful to\nthe construction of a new society and, as such, enemies of the totalitarian\ncommunist regimes. A vast number of victims in every country concerned were its\nown nationals. It was the case particularly of the peoples of the former USSR who\nby far outnumbered other peoples in terms of the number of victims.\nThe indeterminacy of the outcome of the internal political processes resulting in\nideology should be emphasized. Ideologies can be influenced by historical events such as\nthe outcome of battles, or the religious conversion or death of a leader which are\nthemselves underdetermined with respect to evolutionary/ecological theory. For example,\nthe outcome of the Battle of Tours in 732 and the Battle of Vienna in 1683 halted the\nadvances of Islam into Europe and therefore had major effects on the religious ideology (as\nwell as the genetic profile) of the area. Similarly, Donahue (1979) showed that marital\nproperty law in England and France in the 13th century was influenced by the success of the\nNorman invasion. Both countries had similar agricultural economies and a similar feudal\nsocial structure, as well as a similar ethnic composition and ecclesiastical influence.\nHowever, because of the success of the Norman invasion in the 11th century, there were\ndifferences in the power of centralized political control between the two areas, with the\nking being much more powerful in England than in France; there was also a\ncorrespondingly greater power of aristocratic families in France as well as a generally\ngreater importance of extended kinship groups in the latter area.\nNotice the rich interplay between evolutionarily expected tendencies and historical\ncircumstance here. Kinship is expected to be of great importance in an evolutionary\naccount of human affairs because of its role in lowering thresholds of cooperation and\naltruism within the group. This power of the extended family, however, conflicts with the\npower of centralized authorities, and in this case the outcome of this conflict over the\nconstruction of property law was influenced by the outcome of a particular battle. The point\nhere is that the relatively stronger central authority in England cannot be meaningfully\nrelated to what we think of as ecological variables. However, given that certain events\noccurred, then the disintegration of extended kinship and the establishment of a new form\nof property law are expectable.\nSocial controls and ideology are mutually reinforcing\nSocial controls are typically embedded in ideology. For example, after the\nConflict theory of culture\nBolshevik Revolution, the ideology of Marxism rationalized the strong social controls on\nindividual behavior that came to characterize the Soviet state; and the strong social controls\nof the state buttressed the official communist ideology by, for example, dictating that\ncommunist ideology be taught in schools and disseminated by the media, punishing\nindividuals who publically dissented from the ideology, and by eliminating competing\ninstitutions, such as the Russian Orthodox Church, with incompatible or anti-communist\nideologies. The same could be said for National Socialism in Germany from 1933\u00ad1945.\nIn liberal democracies there are social controls supporting the ideology of the\nmarket economy, and the ideology of the market economy legitimizes laws protecting\nprivate property. School curricula are often the focus of impassioned public debate among\nadvocates for ideologies of, for example, creationism, evolution, ethnic and religious\nholidays, and multiculturalism. To the extent that they are successful, advocates for these\nideologies utilize the power of the state to impose their ideologies in the public\nsocialization process for children. Similarly, people who control media are able to influence\nideologies that infuse media content (e.g., the portrayal of sex roles in children's cartoons),\nand dissenters are able to attempt to influence media content by organizing boycotts or\nestablishing their own media outlets.\nThe existence of ideological dissenters in at least some cases indicates that social\ncontrols and ideologies are logically and psychologically distinct. That is, people can\ndissent from ideologies even when these ideologies are enforced by social controls. For\nexample, someone who believes in the theory of evolution and wishes that it be taught in\nschools might maintain his or her beliefs even in the face of the prospect of punishment. An\nopponent of communist ideology in the USSR in the 1930s might maintain his or her views\neven in the face of dire consequences should those beliefs become known. Such\noppositional ideologies are common in historical societies, and at times they give rise to\nsocial movements that attempt to topple official, state-coerced ideologies, possibly yielding\nnew forms of social control more in harmony with the oppositional ideology.\nBecause sexual behavior is influenced by a variety of evolved predispositions and is\nintimately bound up with biological fitness, it is of particular interest to describe how social\ncontrols and ideology have been able to regulate sexual behavior in historical societies.\nMutually reinforcing social controls and ideology may be seen in the maintenance of\nsocially imposed monogamy in Europe from the medieval period down to the present.\nThere is evidence for the importance of the following social controls (MacDonald, 1995):\nprohibitions on divorce, prohibitions on endogamy, penalties for illegitimacy, and controls\non concubinage by elite males. Controls were enforced with a variety of mechanisms,\nincluding ecclesiastical courts, secular courts, and various interest groups (e.g., attorneys\nexpanding tort law to include victims of divorce, authorities enforcing bastardy laws\nbecause of fears of effects on the poor rates, women bent on controlling the behavior of\ntheir husbands, popular movements aimed at the sexual behavior of elite males). These\nsocial controls were reinforced with the following ideologies: celibacy as a morally\nsuperior lifestyle; the sinfulness of extra-marital sex of any kind; the sinfulness of sexual\npleasure, even within marriage; the severe punishment that awaited violators of these\nsexual mores in an afterlife.\nConflict theory of culture\nDiscussion\nThe transmission of culture\nEvolutionary models of culture have been primarily concerned with cultural\ntransmission (e.g., Richerson and Boyd, 2005), with the result that theorists have focused\non social learning as the prime psychological mechanism involved in the transmission of\nculture. The present treatment does not dispute the importance of social learning. However,\nthe discussion of social controls and ideology also implicates another mechanism for the\ntransmission of culture: Once there is in place a set of social controls and a mutually\nreinforcing ideology that rationalizes those social controls, the stage is set for a\nconsiderable degree of inertia in the transmission of culture. This is partly because there\nwill be substantial homogeneity in the attitudes and beliefs of parents as socializing agents.\nMoreover, parents who accept the ideology will receive powerful support because, due to\nsocial controls, the ideology may dominate the educational system and the media available\nto children. Even if parents are successful in transmitting heterodox ideologies during\nchildhood, the child will eventually be subjected to orthodox ideology in the educational\nsystem and in the media. The social controls supporting the ideology may also include\npunishments imposed on people and groups, including parents who attempt to transmit\nincompatible ideologies.\nSuch mechanisms of cultural transmission have been common throughout history,\nranging from the domination of education by religious authority for centuries Europe to the\ntransmission of communism in the USSR. Dissenters attempting to promulgate their own\nideology have often been treated harshly, as in the Spanish Inquisition and the gulags of the\nSoviet Union.\nGroup selection\nThe stress placed here on social controls and ideologies may be seen as examples of\ngroup-level processes capable of giving rise to natural selection between groups. In a\nfamous passage, Darwin shows that he was well aware of the power of groups capable of\nhigh levels of within-group morality:\nIt must not be forgotten that although a high standard of morality gives but a\nslight or no advantage to each individual man and his children of the same tribe, yet\nan increase in the number of well-endowed men and advancement in the standard of\nmorality will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over another. A tribe\nincluding many members who, possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism,\nfidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, who were always ready to aid one\nanother, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over\nmost other tribes; and this would be natural selection. At all times throughout the\nworld, tribes have supplanted other tribes; and as morality is one important element\nof their success, the standard of morality and the number of well-endowed men will\nthus everywhere tend to rise and increase (Charles Darwin [1890, 132], The Descent\nof Man and Selection in Relation to Sex)\nTheorists have shown that cultural differences between groups can give rise to\ngroup selection (Sober and Wilson, 1998; Boyd and Richerson, 2002). The point here is\nthat the processes that are critical for group selection among humans are those discussed in\nConflict theory of culture\nthis article: Social controls and supporting ideologies are able to enforce discipline within\ngroups, punish defectors, encourage patriotism and obedience to group aims, produce\nsignificant levels of altruism, and regulate variation in reproductive success (MacDonald,\n1994). For example, because of increased internal solidarity and cohesiveness, groups\ncharacterized by social imposed monogamy or socially imposed altruism may well have\nincreased reproductive success compared to groups in which individuals (and especially\nwealthy, powerful individuals) are free to pursue individually optimal reproductive\nstrategies. Thus Richard Alexander's (1979) theory of socially imposed monogamy implies\nthat monogamy is adaptive in between-group competition because it results in greater\ngroup solidarity and ensures the allegiance of lower-ranking males.\nGene-culture co-evolution\nTheories of gene-culture co-evolution stress the idea that cultural shifts set the stage\nRicherson, 1995). There is good evidence for gene-culture co-evolution of genes for lactose\ntolerance and fighting infectious diseases and parasites (Durham, 1991). There is also\nsuggestive evidence for selection for genes influencing personality (e.g., delay of\ngratification) and cognitive abilities as a consequence of the invention of agriculture\n(Cochran and Harpending, 2009). Relevant to the present article, the relatively powerful\nsocial controls resulting when agricultural societies supplanted hunter gatherer societies\nmay have resulted in selection for genes influencing conformity. Harpending and Cochran\n(2002) interpret available data as suggesting natural selection for the 7R allelle of the D4\ndopamine receptor gene that is associated with novelty seeking, impulsivity, and attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder. However, this allele is absent in China, although alleles derived\nfrom the 7R allele are common. Cochran and Harpending (2009, p. 112) suggest that this\npattern may be due to high levels of social controls weeding out non-conforming individuals.\n\"The Japanese say that the nail that sticks out is hammered down, but in China it may have\nbeen pulled out and thrown away.\"\nConflicts over the construction of culture\nA major theme of this article has been that understanding the psychological\nmechanisms underlying culture leads to a rich theory of conflicts over the construction of\nculture. If culture is as important as some evolutionary theorists claim (e.g., Richerson and\nBoyd, 2005), then it is not surprising that there are conflicts over the construction of\nculture.\nExplicit processing, including means-end reasoning, enables conscious, intentional\nattempts at cultural influence. An advertizing campaign designed to influence consumers to\npurchase a product is a paradigm. In the contemporary world, such campaigns involve\nmeans-end reasoning, explicit mental models, and explicit evaluations of probable\noutcomes on the basis of scientific studies to determine which messages are most effective\nwith which audiences. They may be designed to appeal to well-known psychological\nbiasing mechanisms that influence social learning, such as endorsement by prestigious\npeople or associating the product with the satisfaction of sexual desires.\nThe incorporation of explicit processing into an analysis of culture opens up a very\nlarge and indeterminate universe of possible costs and benefits. On one hand, humans are\nequipped with mechanisms able to control evolved prepotencies (although there are\nindividual differences in the ability to control evolved predispositions). On the other hand,\nConflict theory of culture\npeople are exposed to an often bewildering array of cultural messages that affect their\nexplicit appraisals of costs and benefits and even their implicit appraisals of costs and\nbenefits in situations where learning has become automatic with practice. These appraisals\nmay be influenced by a wide range of competing interests. For example, media images,\nespecially those aimed at explicit, conscious processing, have important effects on behavior\neven though people are often unaware that their behavior is influenced by the images (T. D.\nWilson, 2002). These images are often engineered by advertisers who are consciously\nattempting to influence the recipients of the messages in ways that conform to the\nadvertiser's interests, not the recipient's interests.\nThere are conflicts of interest between producers and consumers of culture as well\nas among producers of culture. Advertisers may attempt to persuade consumers to purchase\ninferior products, products they don't need, or products that have negative effects on the\nconsumer; or they may attempt to get consumers to pay to more than necessary for\nproducts. Consumers may lobby legislative bodies to enact laws that regulate products\navailable to consumers. Advertisers compete with each other in order to create more\neffective cultural messages. Examples of these processes go well beyond advertizing -- as,\nfor example, in competing political or public relations campaigns.\nConflicts of interest over the construction of culture span the entire range of human\nconflicts of interest. In accordance with Marxist ideas, there may be conflicts of interest\nbetween social classes, with propertied people having different interests than people with\nlittle or no property. There may also be conflicts of interest between large interest groups,\nas between the Church and the emerging European aristocracy over the control of marriage\nduring the Middle Ages (see MacDonald, 1995), or between interest groups in liberal\ndemocracies (e.g., opponents and proponents of teaching evolution in schools).\nThere may also be conflicts of interest between ethnic groups over the construction\nof culture. At times, ethnic groups have attempted to impose their culture on another group.\nFor example, Bulgaria prohibited the Turkish language and forced ethnic Turks to\nBulgarize their names; there have also been several examples of forced conversion\nthroughout the history of Christianity (Bookman, 1997). Interest group dynamics in\npluralistic societies may also involve ethnic differences in the construction of culture\n(MacDonald, 1998). For example, different ethnic groups may perceive the debate about\nthe nature and nurture of intelligence or issues related to racial differences in various\npsychological traits as affecting their ethnic interests and therefore be motivated to\ninfluence academic research and media discussion of these issues.\nIn conclusion, an appreciation of the importance of explicit processing provides a\nrich view of culture as a force in evolution, particularly for organized groups and for state-\nlevel societies able to exert significant degrees of social control. Explicit processing is a\ndouble-edged sword. It allows for intensive cooperation in human societies, enabling levels\nof organization and control of group members that are impossible for animals, and often\nresulting in formidable, highly competitive groups. However, these same groups may use\ntheir superior organization to oppress, exploit, or destroy other human groups. Explicit\nprocessing also allows for erecting oppressive group structures that are able to mute or even\nobliterate the interests of individuals within the group; such groups may well impose\ncontrols that result in widespread disparities between our evolved predispositions and the\nreality of life within the group -- a prescription for widespread unhappiness. An important\npoint of this article is that such outcomes are not inevitable.\nConflict theory of culture\nReferences\nAlexander, R. D. (1979). Darwinism and human affairs.
