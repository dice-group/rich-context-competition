    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhile advantages of literacy in the home language have been widely documented, the Australian education system has not\nbeen proactive in providing institutional support for its development. This paper investigates the impact of (il)literacy in the\nhome language on the academic, affective, and social development of bilingual/multilingual children and proposes principles\nthat home-language-literacy programs should meet to be effective. It discusses programs that, although designed to develop\nliteracy or second-language proficiency mainly in classroom contexts, could be easily adapted to address the needs of\nthe linguistically and culturally diverse Australian context. We argue that the cost of not investing in successful home-\nlanguage-literacy programs will be higher in the long run than their implementation costs and recommend that Australia\nshould consider supporting grassroots home-language-literacy programs in a push to improve overall literacy outcomes for\nAustralian home-language speakers.\n",

While migrants from English-speaking countries\n(e.g., the United Kingdom and New Zealand) are still the\nlargest group of overseas-born residents, 19% of the\nAustralian population over 5 years of age speaks languages\nother than English at home. Almost half (49%) of longer-\nstanding migrants and 67% of recent arrivals3 speak a lan-\nguage other than English at home (Australian Bureau of\nStatistics, 2012b). One of the most obvious manifestations of\nthis process is the presence in the classroom of students\nacquiring English as a second language while having to cope\nwith the academic demands of a new curriculum (Verhoeven,\n1991). In some geographical areas (e.g., Logan Central,\nQueensland), up to 70% of the state school's population are\nfromnon-English-speakinghomes(QueenslandGovernment,\ntheir first language and experience difficulties in the transi-\ntion to a new educational system in a language yet to be mas-\nWhile mastery of the English language by migrant chil-\ndren is undoubtedly a crucial aim, it is still to be noted that\nlanguages other than English are neglected in the Australian\neducation system. The lack of institutional support is particu-\nlarly noteworthy in the area of literacy skills in minority lan-\nguages. Parents wishing to raise their children bilingually\nhave very few venues--other than classes offered by\nCommunity Language Schools in a limited number of lan-\nguages--to ensure that their children become literate in their\nnative language(s), or that they can maintain literacy in the\nhome language if the process of literacy development has\nbeen interrupted by migration. This affects not only newly\narrived children but also second- and third-generation\nmigrants as can be seen from high percentages of language\nample research that shows that writing is the most fragile\nskill in linguistic minority situations, as it is not needed in\ndaily life and needs constant use or practice for its mainte-\nnance (Clyne, Fernandez, Chen, & Summo-O'Connell,\nsupport results in what has been termed kitchen languages,\nimpoverished varieties of community languages that serve\nmostly oral communication needs around restricted topics.

However, when it comes to public debate and edu-\ncational language policy and planning for languages other\nthan English, there is no clear and consistent conceptualiza-\ntion of how these languages are viewed. In a classic article,\nRuiz (1984) discusses three main policy orientations to lan-\nguage: language as a right, language as a problem, and lan-\nguage as a resource. Although Ruiz was reflecting on the\nUnited States and Canada, this distinction is pertinent to the\nAustralian context and provides a useful framework for anal-\nysis. In Australia, not all language groups have the opportu-\nnity to be included in the school curriculum. When it comes\nto languages other than English, a clear distinction is made\nbetween modern foreign languages, indigenous languages,\nand migrant/community languages (Lo Bianco, 2003).5 Only\na few \"foreign\" languages are seen as resources, and, thus,\nwhen it comes to justify the selection of particular languages\nin the education system, justifications are worded either in\nrelation to the high cultural achievements of the target cul-\ntures (e.g., French and German) or to economic and geopo-\nlitical national imperatives (e.g., Chinese and Japanese).\nMost of the languages spoken in Australia however are not\nseen in this light. Except for the few languages that at differ-\nent times attracted strong financial support from foreign gov-\nernments or institutions (e.g., Korean and Italian), \"migrant/\ncommunity\" languages are seen as a problem, hindering\nassimilation into the dominant culture and potentially polar-\nizing society. Lo Bianco poignantly summarizes the situation\nnoting that in Australia, languages spoken \"in other coun-\ntries\" and divorced from daily life are seen as valuable skills.\nIn contrast, \"when the languages are less foreign, when emo-\ntional attachment and mastery may be high, their study, pub-\nlic use, and maintenance `threaten civilization.' No longer a\nskill but sedition\" (Lo Bianco, 2000, p. 99). This reflects the\ntension that Hakuta and McLaughlin (1996), describing the\nsituation in the United States, take as evidence of \"elite\" ver-\nsus \"folk bilingualism\". Bilingualism in Australia has simi-\nlarly been mostly confined \"to a small and in sociological\nterms, elite (unrepresentative) category,\" which learns for-\neign languages from a historically privileged English-\nspeaking base and to \"immigrants and indigenous peoples; a\nlarger but not socially elite category,\" who learn English as a\nsecond language from a historically disadvantaged base (Lo\nFor reasons outlined in the section \"Literacy in the Home\nLanguage: What Research Tells Us,\" recognition and sup-\nport for indigenous and migrant/community languages are\ncrucial to children, families, and the nation. The section\n\"Minority Language Education in the Australian Context\" pro-\nvides a brief overview of the minority-language-education situ-\nation in Australia. We conclude that given the substantial\nlinguistic diversity in Australia, effective support strategies\ncan only be devised through deployment of innovative\napproaches that are mindful of resources. In the section\n\"Alternative Approaches\", we thus discuss a number of such\napproaches that might be trialed and put to use in the\nAustralian home-language context. The \"Conclusion\" summa-\nrizes the paper, recommending thatAustralia should consider to\nsystematically support grass-root home-language-literacy pro-\ngrams in a push to improve overall literacy outcomes for a\nsubstantial group of Australians--those who speak a lan-\nguage other than English at home.\nBefore going any further, however, some terminological\nclarifications are in order: In this paper, we refer to \"majority\nlanguage\" as the language used by a socially and culturally\ndominant group, whereas \"minority language\" is used by a\ngroup that is subordinate in a social and cultural context\n(Hamers & Blanc, 2000).6 With regard to the relationship\nbetween the speaker and the minority language(s), a number\nof alternative terms have been used in the literature (among\nthem \"mother tongue\", \"first language\", \"home language\",\n\"native language\", \"heritage language\", cf. Skutnabb-\nKangas, 2000), but their definitions are not straightforward.\nOne of the most commonly used terms is \"mother tongue\".\nThis concept has taken a variety of meanings in the literature.\nAs Olivier (2011) notes, it is difficult to determine which\nlanguage used by multilinguals is actually the person's\nthat when trying to determine a speaker's \"mother tongue\", it\nis important to distinguish between four aspects: origin--\nwhich language was acquired first; competence--which lan-\nguage the speaker knows the best; function--which language\nthe speaker uses the most; and identification--which lan-\nguage is used to associate with or disassociate from others. It\nis evident that a speaker may have more than one mother\ntongue and that the mother tongue can change during the\nlifetime. Following this definition, it is obvious that the term\nfirst language is insufficient as it only relates to origin, but\nthe bilinguals' chronological first language may not be their\ndominant language. For lack of a better term, and given that\nour focus is on young children, in this paper, we use the term\nhome language as the language acquired by the child through\nimmersion at home, usually the language the child knows\nbest before going through child care or school.\nLiteracy in the Home Language: What\nResearch Tells Us\nIt should be pointed out at the outset that our approach is\nideologically based on the belief in the value of multicultur-\nalism and in the right of minority groups to choose whether\nto retain their language(s) and culture7--in Ruiz's (1984)\nEisenchlas et al. 3\nterms, in \"language as a right and as a resource\". We, there-\nfore, focus our discussion on empirical research that has\nextensively documented the many educational, social, and\naffective advantages of developing literacy in the home\nlanguage and, conversely, the detrimental effects of home-\nlanguage-literacy neglect.8 The following sections report on\ngeneral research findings. However, unlike first-language-\nacquisition patterns that typically show consistency in pace\nand rate of linguistic development across populations\n(Slobin, 1986), bilingual acquisition involves great degrees\nof variability and is affected by issues such as quantity and\nquality of input, context of acquisition, methods of upbring-\ning (e.g., simultaneous vs. consecutive), and even children's\ncultural orientation and identification (Verhoeven, 1991b).\nMany of the studies discussed in what follows give little\ninformation about participants and their circumstances, and,\ntherefore, the findings need to be taken with caution, as they\nmay conceal nuances or patterns that only apply to particular\ncontexts. More research in this area is most certainly needed;\nnonetheless, results of recent studies as outlined in the fol-\nlowing sections appear to point toward manifold advantages\nto developing literacy in the home language, including ben-\nefits for literacy in general.9\nEducational Advantages for the Child\nCurrent research indicates that home-language-literacy\nacquisition provides a number of educational advantages to\nbilingual children. These include fostering the development\nof linguistic skills in the home language to high levels of\nproficiency, supporting the acquisition of literacy in the\nmajority language, easing the transition into the school envi-\nronment, and enhancing the child's general academic\nachievement. We briefly discuss each of these issues in turn.\nHome-language development and maintenance.Research has\nshown that literacy is important for long-lasting lexical\ndevelopment, fluency, and overall maintenance of a language\nstudies conducted mostly in Canada and the United States\nhave documented the rapid loss of home-language fluency in\nthe early years of schooling when these languages are not\nreinforced (see Cummins, 2005, for a review of studies).\nIndeed, language attrition has been reported in the latestAus-\ntralian census: First-generation Australians had the highest\nproportion of people who spoke a language other than Eng-\nlish at home (53%). It was much lower for second-generation\nAustralians (20%) and lower still for the third-plus genera-\nAcquisition of the majority language. Underlying the dominant\nmonolingual orientation of the Australian education system,\nwith the consequent disregard for languages other than Eng-\nlish, is what Benson (2005) calls the \"either-or myth,\" that is,\nthe mistaken belief that bilingualism causes confusion and\nthat it must be pushed aside so that the majority language can\nbe acquired. Children are thus expected to undergo a rapid\ntransition into the majority language, which would ensure\nacademic success and improve their chances of effective\ncompetition in mainstream society. Richardson (1998) very\naptly summarizes the Australian situation: \"In the multi-eth-\nnic Australian society literacy pedagogy and schooling are\nidentified as the equalising instruments in an otherwise com-\nplex, heterogeneous and unequal society\" (p. 128).\nUnder this perspective, foreign languages spoken by non-\nEnglish-speaking immigrants in Australia are seen as a hin-\ndrance to the assimilation process (Wright & Taylor, 1995).\nMigrant and refugee parents, concerned that their children\nwill lag behind their native-born peers, follow the mistakenly\ndispensed advice of shifting into English in their interactions\nwith their children, despite their limited proficiency in this\nlanguage (Mart\u00edn, 2005).10 These beliefs, however, run coun-\nter to the massive body of research providing evidence that\nhome-language promotion is possible at no cost to the devel-\nopment of the majority language and to the documented ben-\neficial role of bilingualism in general, and of literacy in the\nhome language in particular, as discussed in the following\nparagraph.\nWith regard to mastery of the majority language, there is\ngrowing acceptance that home-language maintenance not\nonly supports it (Makin, Campbell, & Jones Diaz, 1995), but\nalso that children who are educated initially in their home\nlanguage learn a second language, and hence the majority\nlanguage, more proficiently and achieve more academic suc-\ncess than those who have not had such a solid foundation\nSwain, Lapkin, Rowen, & Hart, 1990; Thomas & Collier,\n1997). In a report commissioned by the U.S. Department of\nEducation, August and Shanahan (2010) concluded that\nteaching students in their home language was beneficial to\nEnglish-literacy learning and better than English immer-\nthe first language skills the better the results in the second\nlanguage, because language and cognition in the second lan-\nguage build on the first. Similarly, Verhoeven (1991) pro-\nposes that \"[i]t is easier for children to build up elementary\nliteracy skills in [the language for] which they have acquired\nbasic phonological, lexical and syntactic skills\" (p. 61).12\nStudies have shown that strategies involved in reading in\nthe first language can be positively transferred to the other\nlanguage. Swain et al. (1990) explain that the facilitative\neffect of home-language-literacy programs stems from the\nfact that it is easier for children to develop an initial under-\nstanding of the functions and mechanics of reading and writ-\ning in the language they use to make sense of their life\nexperiences. This effect can be found even when two lan-\nguages are written differently (Bialystok, Luk, & Kwan,\n2005). Studies have also shown that bilingual children have\na more complete understanding of the symbolic relation\nbetween print and meanings than monolinguals. Bialystok\n4 SAGE Open\n(2001b) found that \"just being exposed to two writing sys-\ntems, or two kinds of storybooks, enabled bilingual children\nto appreciate that the written forms are the symbolic systems\nfrom which the story emerges\" (p. 30). This finding is attrib-\nuted to the bilingual's experience in managing two writing\nsystems and the resulting insights about the separation of\nform and meaning, a crucial prerequisite skill in the develop-\nment of literacy.\nIt has also been proposed that, once students have basic\nliteracy skills in the home language and have developed\ncommunicative abilities in the majority language, they will\nbe able to transfer the literacy skills acquired in the familiar\nlanguage into the new language. The posited transfer of skills\nand the concept of common underlying proficiency whereby\nthe knowledge of the home language and the second lan-\nguage are not separated but interdependent. Thus, language,\nliteracy, and concepts learned in the home language can be\naccessed and used in the second language, once oral L2 skills\nare developed. No relearning of elementary-literacy skills is\nrequired, provided that there is enough exposure and motiva-\ntion. There is a proviso, however, that children must achieve\nadequate levels of proficiency in both languages for this\ntransfer to occur. Cummins (1979) calls this proposal the\nthreshold hypothesis. Thus, reaching adequate levels of pro-\nficiency in the home language is seen as a prerequisite that\nleads to positive cognitive and academic consequences for\nthe bilingual child.13 The relationship between bilingualism\nand cognitive/academic outcomes is mediated by the level of\nlanguage proficiency, which is, in turn, affected by the acqui-\nsition of literacy skills.\nThis proposal does not exclude the possibility of transfer-\nring the skills acquired in the majority language into the\nhome language; however, given the arguments discussed\nabove, when the home language is the dominant one, transfer\nfrom the majority into the home language would be an\nunnecessarily difficult and inefficient process (Benson,\nTransition into the school environment.A number of studies\nhave suggested that minority-language-speaking children\ncan potentially experience compounding disadvantage when\nthe Australian context, children who speak English enter for-\nmal schooling already speaking the language in which they\nwill become literate. Furthermore, they have been social-\nized--through child-care and home practices--into the gen-\neral practices followed at school, are taught by native\nspeakers of English, and live in a society supportive of Eng-\nlish. On the other hand, minority-language speakers often do\nnot speak the majority language, or not fluently, when they\nenter school. They have not been generally socialized into\nthe norms of interaction of a typical Australian class situa-\ntion. Moreover, the teacher does not speak their language,\nand they are taught alongside native speakers of English.\nThese children live in a society that does not support bilin-\ngualism and are not able to become literate in their home\nlanguage (Makin et al., 1995). This situation, which poten-\ntially disadvantages migrant/refugee children, as well as\nindigenous minorities, has been addressed in some countries\nby creating bilingual and dual literacy programs that roughly\nfall into three main educational approaches: simultaneous\nbilingual instruction from the start, successive home-\nlanguage\u00admajority-language literacy instruction (also called\nthe \"staircase approach\"), or successive majority-language\u00ad\nthese programs, bilingual teachers who share children's lan-\nguages and cultures facilitate the transition into the new aca-\ndemic culture. Such literacy programs would be possible if\nthe number of languages spoken in society was restricted,\nbut they would be extremely difficult to implement in multi-\nlingual societies such as Australia, given the human and\nfinancial resources needed to implement a project of this\nmagnitude.\nWhile these programs show very promising results in\nterms of children's academic achievement (see for instance\nMohanty, 1990) when compared with the typical L2 submer-\nsion found in most regions in Australia, they are rare in\nAustralia. Aboriginal education was an exception with dual-\nliteracy education being implemented in some states, but\nthese programs have had a chequered history (Molyneux,\nGeneral academic achievement.A number of scholars have\nproposed that acquisition of literacy in the home language,\nwhether simultaneously or concurrently with literacy devel-\nopment in the majority language, is a source of general cog-\nnitive and academic advantages for bilinguals that extend\nbeyond the linguistic domain (Swain & Lapkin, 1991a, in\nBaker, 2006). Domains in which this claim has been tested\ninclude meta-linguistic awareness, phonological awareness,\nworking memory, ability to decode and interpret text, in par-\nticular, when the writing systems differ across languages,\nand enhanced attention and concentration, among other skills\n(see Bialystok, 2001a, for a thorough review of the\nliterature).\nIt is thus fair to say that there is complementary evidence\npointing to manifold educational advantages to developing\nliteracy in the home language, with positive effects not only\nfor literacy acquisition in both home and majority language\nbut also for academic achievement more generally. We now\nturn to affective advantages.\nAffective Advantages\nThere is ample research on the positive affective outcomes\nthat derive from literacy in the home language. Expanding the\nfunctions and usage of the home language increases the status\nof that language, which according to Baker (2006) is crucial\nEisenchlas et al. 5\nfor language maintenance. Baker further argues that, where\noral communication is in the minority language and literacy in\nthe majority language, the minority language has lower pres-\ntige and may have less chances of being maintained.\nWright and Taylor (1995), who studied the effect of edu-\ncation in the home language (i.e., Inuttitut) vis-\u00e0-vis educa-\ntion in a second language (i.e., English) in Canada, showed\nthat early home-language education had a positive effect on\nthe personal and collective self-esteem of minority-language\nstudents, while instruction in the second language did not\nhave a positive effect. Bialystok (2001a) argues that \"the lan-\nguage we speak is instrumental in forming our identity, and\nbeing required to speak a language that is not completely\nnatural may interfere with the child's construction of self\" (p.\n5) and may impinge on the child's ability in establishing eth-\nnic and cultural affiliations. Furthermore, literacy in the\nhome language enables the home traditions and culture to be\naccessed, reproduced, and transmitted (Clyne, 1991;\ngroup affiliation, positive self-esteem, the vision and world-\nview of one's heritage culture, self-identity, and intellectual\nempathy. High self-esteem may result in better performance\nin English in the long run. Studies have shown positive cor-\nrelations between self-esteem and academic success (Makin\nResearchers (e.g., Fishman, 1991; Rosenthal & Cichelloa,\n1986) have noted that language shift can result in intergen-\nerational conflict and alienation triggered by a clash of val-\nues between the newcomers and their offspring, and diminish\nfeelings of belonging.16 Conversely, allowing children to\ndevelop skills to maintain and expand the home language\nand to access the cultural heritage of their parents and grand-\nparents may enhance community cohesion and may foster\nacceptance and understanding of cultural diversity.\nSocial Advantages\nSupporters of a monolingual agenda often base their argu-\nments on the myth of \"one nation\u00adone language,\" or, in other\nterms, in the mistaken belief that monolingualism is a crucial\nprerequisite to social cohesion (Hobsbawm, 1996; Lo\nBianco, 2003). They argue that if groups retain their cultures\nand languages, they will be less likely to identify with the\nmainstream culture and thus will become disengaged from\nthe society and state.As many have noted, however, minority\nlanguage oracy without literacy can disempower students\nand lead to language shift and assimilation. Assimilation, in\naddition to eliminating cultural richness in society, \"can\nresult in lowered self-esteem, poor self-concept and cultural\nalienation\" (Olivier, 2011, p. 22), not only from the in-group\nbut also from the community at large. While the exact mix of\ncontributing factors is still unclear, Barrett, Sonderegger, and\nSonderegger (2002) have shown that \"Australian adolescents\nexhibit greater overall self-esteem than young migrants\"\n(p. 229). They discuss the need for culture-specific\nearly-intervention and prevention programs. The support of\nliteracy in the home language could be trialed as a part of\nsuch programs.\nAdvantages for the Nation\nWhile advanced foreign-language proficiency is seen as a\nvaluable resource to the nation and as an imperative in the\nage of globalization, foreign language studies in Australia\nare mostly relegated to the Higher Education level (Clyne,\nlearners acquire languages to a level at which they can oper-\nate effectively across languages and cultures. Paradoxically,\nchildren from culturally and linguistically diverse back-\ngrounds, who could potentially fill Australia's linguistic\nneeds, are ignored, thus lost to the system. Clyne (2005)\nrefers to this process as a \"squandering\" of language\nresources. As many of these children shift into the dominant\nlanguage, their home language deteriorates to a stage where\nonly passive comprehension and minimal production skills\npoignantly characterizes the current situation as a \"bizarre\nscenario of schools successfully transforming fluent speak-\ners of foreign languages into monolingual English speakers,\nat the same time as they struggle, largely unsuccessfully, to\ntransform English monolingual students into foreign lan-\nguage speakers\" (p. 586). In light of this, it suggests itself\nthat fostering the home language and its literacy develop-\nment would not only be hugely beneficial to the children and\nfamilies involved but also result in an invaluable gain for the\nnation and society as a whole.\nMinority Language Education in the\nAustralian Context\nWhen it comes to providing resources to develop linguistic\nskills in general and literacy in particular for minority-\nlanguage speakers, Australia faces a number of challenges:\nMigrants come from different places, cultures, and socioeco-\nnomic and educational backgrounds. While more than 200\nlanguages are regularly spoken in Australia by 19% of the\npopulation over the age of 5 (Australian Bureau of Statistics,\n2012b), the second most frequently spoken language after\nEnglish is Mandarin, which is spoken by only 4% of the pop-\nulation. This contrasts with the situation in the United States\nwhere 12.3% of the population speaks just one minority lan-\nguage, Spanish (Shin & Kominski, 2010), or with Canada\nthat has an official policy of bilingualism, thus officially\nacknowledging a right for children to receive publicly funded\nprimary and secondary schooling in French or English if\nFrench or English, respectively, is the minority language of\nthe area they live in (Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of\nThe wide range of languages spoken makes it difficult\nto address the educational needs of this culturally and\n6 SAGE Open\nlinguistically diverse sector of the population. Ideological\nand practical considerations further complicate the issue. As\ndescribed above, assimilationist policy orientations call into\nquestion the value of diverting resources into supporting\ncommunity languages. Even when the political willingness\nexists, there are obvious limitations in terms of materials,\ncurricula, and teaching expertise in such a varied range of\nlanguages, some of which have few speakers.\nExperiences overseas leave no doubts that bilingual\nschool-based programs, in which children are taught part or\nthe entire curriculum in a second language, would be the\noptimal model of biliteracy development, and there is ample\nevidence to attest for their effectiveness (Swain et al., 1990;\nWillig, 1985). However, and despite the fact that this sort of\nschooling was once very common (Clyne, 1991), in contem-\nporary Australia, bilingual schools are very rare, as language\nproficiency has become synonymous with mastery of\nEnglish-language skills (Molyneux, 2009). The few bilin-\ngual programs that exist are for target languages that are seen\nas \"resources\" (e.g., French, German, Chinese, Japanese),\nbut they are ill-equipped in terms of funding and staffing\nrequirements to cope with the wide range of languages spo-\nken in the community.\nMinority language education in Australia has been pre-\ndominantly pursued through Community Language Schools\n(otherwise called \"ethnic,\" \"heritage,\" \"community run\nschools,\" or \"Saturday/Sunday\" schools). There are at pres-\nent some 1,000 community language schools attended by\nof Ethnic Schools Associations, 2012). These schools pro-\nvide language maintenance in 72 languages (Lo Bianco,\n2009; Australian Federation of Ethnic Schools Associations,\n2012) and receive State funding supplemented by Federal\n\"per capita\" funding.\nMost of these schools teach language and culture, some\nalso add religion and history to instill in-group loyalty. They\nwould be particularly suitable to develop literacy in the home\nlanguages, an area about which parents may feel less confi-\ndent. Despite the good intentions, there are many challenges\nthese schools face. One of the most problematic aspects is\nthat tuition is usually carried out in addition to mainstream\nschooling, generally on Saturday or Sunday mornings or\nafter school hours. Many children lack motivation and per-\nceive after-hours school as an unnecessary burden. In addi-\ntion, Australian cities are extremely spread out and driving\nchildren to the schools where the target language (i.e., home\nlanguage of the child) is offered may be utterly impractical, as it\nmay, for example, clash with parents' working commitments.\nGiven the diversity of languages, not every language can be\noffered in each city or suburb, and, because all minority-lan-\nguage speakers do not live in urban centers, their needs are\nnot met by community language schools.\nAnother challenge these programs face, particularly in\nsmall schools, is the vast range in students'linguistic compe-\ntence. Catering for this diversity requires a balance between\nage/cognitive development and language development in the\nclass composition. The lack of trained teachers in the differ-\nent target languages and the scarcity of teaching materials\nappropriate to the Australian situation pose additional prob-\nlems; the available textbooks are usually intended for much\nyounger children in the country of origin and are, thus,\nunlikely to motivate students. Community language schools\nthus struggle to cope with their community's linguistic\ndiversity.\nFrom a broader perspective, there are additional issues\nwith relying on community language schools for supporting\nhome-language literacy. Not all parents may have the\nresources to provide their children with the opportunity to\nattend community language schools. Socioeconomic status\nof families is thus likely to preselect who can attend, as are\nother factors such as the value that is attributed to bilingual-\nism and biliteracy. Moreover, the languages on offer at the\nmoment of writing merely represent about one third of the\nlanguages spoken in homes across Australia, that is, about\ntwo thirds of the language communities do not have this ave-\nnue at all to support their children's home-language-literacy\ndevelopment. It is thus crucial to start exploring which alter-\nnative ways might be available, which we do in the following\nsections.\nAlternative Approaches\nBecause we do not anticipate a large-scale policy shift with\nrespect to home/community languages, and given the high\nnumber of languages to be included in any home-language-\nliteracy programs across Australia, we propose that alterna-\ntive teaching and learning strategies need to be explored to\nachieve more immediate impact. In Cummins'(2005) words,\nwe propose a move away from macropolicies and instead\nfocus on working with communities and educators at the\nlocal level to implement instructional practices aimed at\nstrengthening students' home-language literacy and profi-\nciency. As Fishman (1991) points out, overreliance on the\neducation system leads to a frustrating struggle against the\nmonolingual mindset. He suggests that parents need to take\nmore responsibility in bringing up their children in two lan-\nguages. Furthermore, as Baker (2006) acknowledges, while\nthe school is important in developing literacy, bilinguals also\ndevelop literacy in the family and the community, environ-\nments that could very well be exploited for home-language-\nliteracy development. Learning outside school and using the\nminority community's resources help personalize the experi-\nence of reading and writing by relating information to the\nchild's own experiences and emotions.\nWe, therefore, propose a bottom\u00adup introduction of literacy\nthrough nonformal education practices. To be successful, these\nstrategies will need to be implemented as extracurricular activ-\nities, without adding substantial demands on parents and car-\ners' time and resources. They will also require grass-root\ncommunity support to persuade different ethno-linguistic\nEisenchlas et al. 7\ngroups to provide competent native speakers and funds for the\ndevelopment of appealing and culturally appropriate pedagog-\nical materials so that students will be encouraged to use these\nresources--and they need to be easily and cheaply maintained,\nupdated, and expanded. Benson (2005) argues that this type of\ngrassroots-level approach, although not easy from a large-\nscale organizational standpoint, is the most promising in terms\nof community commitment and sustainability.\nThe initial community investment in developing such\nprograms will be offset by its potential benefits: In addition\nto the positive effects identified in the section \"Literacy in\nthe Home Language: What Research Tells Us\", there will be\nthe added benefit for the diverse ethno-linguistic groups in\nraising the usefulness and status of the home language in the\ncommunity in the eyes of speakers and nonspeakers, thus\nfostering a valorization of the home culture and language and\na sense of pride. This nonformal approach is also expected to\nincrease parent participation in their children's education and\nto foster cultural relevance to the social context of the child,\nwhich some researchers consider essential to the enhance-\nGiven the complex nature of the Australian context, it\nbecomes clear that any offerings of home-language-literacy\nsupport to children of minority languages have to meet a\nnumber of principles. From the learners' perspective, these\nprograms need to be:\ni. engaging and motivating, so that children enjoy the\nexperience and are intellectually stimulated; yet\nii. nonthreatening, to avoid frustration; and\niii. culturally relevant and appropriate, to draw on chil-\ndren's immediate experiences.\nIn terms of design and implementation, these programs\nshould be:\niv. easily adaptable, to cater to different levels of profi-\nciency, different languages, and different ages;\nv. flexibly accessible at different times and locations of\nthe children's choice;\nvi. cost-effective (ideally freely available); and\nvii. easy to maintain and expand.\nPrograms that meet all these conditions should foster\nresponsibility and autonomy in the learners.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we describe some approaches\nthat have been implemented overseas to promote home/\ncommunity-language literacy outside of, or parallel to, the\nmainstream education system. We, in particular, focus on their\nsuitability to theAustralian context. While a single approach is\nunlikely to work across different cultural contexts and speech\ncommunities and for different ages, developmental stages,\nand literacy levels of children, we nonetheless expect that a\nsophisticated adaptation and combination of aspects from\nthese different approaches might lead to an improvement of\nhome-language-literacy levels in the Australian context. This\noverview is by no means exhaustive but is meant to show the\neffectiveness of some programs in meeting some (or all) of the\nprinciples listed above. As outlined in the following, the pro-\ngrams selected either concentrate on motivating young learn-\ners through engaging materials or on involving parents to\nassist in the learning process.\nThe \"Book Flood\" and \"Shared Book\"\nApproaches\nThis approach, initially developed in the South Pacific in the\n1970s, was used in a number of developing countries to\nimprove the acquisition of English as a foreign language by\nchildren who have already developed literacy skills in their\nhome language. The \"Book Flood\" approach (Elley, 2000)\ninvolves making available in the classroom a \"flood\" of\nabout 100 high-interest books that children can access inde-\npendently. The basic hypothesis underlying this approach is\nthat, if children have an abundant supply of engaging books\nin class (principle i), it would increase their exposure to the\nlanguage and thus expand their lexical and grammatical\nacquisition. Good quality books that appeal to their interests\nwould also increase reading time and motivation, both good\npredictors of academic success. Thus, the books are not seen\nas supplementary materials but as the central pedagogical\ntools, which allow children to proceed autonomously and\nlearn the language directly by reading.\nRecognizing that not all cultures engage in similar read-\ning practices (conf. Heath, 1982), the \"Shared Book\"\napproach--developed independently of the \"Book Flood\"--\nis used as a preparation step and to avoid early frustration\n(principle ii). Here, the teacher shares a good book with a\nclass of pupils over several days until they become familiar\nwith the language of the book (Elley, 2000). The teacher\nintroduces the stories, discusses the title and illustrations,\nand encourages children to make predictions about the con-\ntent. This builds up children's confidence in their abilities to\nwork out meanings from illustrations and/or context later on.\nThe stories are discussed and reread until children are famil-\niar and can join in. The process is meant not only to introduce\nchildren to particular stories but also to ensure that children\ninteract constructively with books on a daily basis and to\nprovide modeling and guidance on how to engage with\nbooks, thus preparing children for independent reading.\nPrograms using these approaches have been evaluated by\nElley and her colleagues in a variety of cultural contexts, lan-\nguages, and age levels. The results show that the \"Book\nFlood\" approach can double the rate of reading acquisition,\nimprove writing, listening comprehension, and related lan-\nguage skills, and increase motivation and enthusiasm for\nreading. Moreover, students appear to transfer their enhanced\nskills to other subjects of the curriculum that depend heavily\n8 SAGE Open\nAlthough the aim of the \"Book Flood\" approach is to\nimprove linguistic proficiency in a foreign language, we\nbelieve that this model could be even more effective in pro-\nmoting literacy in a language in which children are already\nfluent. Adapting such a model to the Australian context\nwould also address one of the criticisms raised against the\noriginal implementation of the \"Book Flood\", namely, the\nlack of cultural relevance and appropriateness (principle iii;\nElley, 2000), given that the approach was based on books\nimported from abroad and developed for widely different\ncultural contexts. We propose that the community can con-\ntribute to the creation of texts and that texts can be shared\nwithin the community, thus also reducing overall costs.\nMoreover, members of the community could easily be\ntrained to assist children in the initial stages of literacy devel-\nopment (see the two programs discussed in the section\n\"Family Literacy Programs\"), thus addressing potential\nshortages of community teachers fluent in particular lan-\nguages. Furthermore, these resources could be digitized and\nmade freely available online, thus overcoming the scarcity of\nresources and obstacles of accessibility.\nA recent implementation based on similar principles is\nbeing conducted by Worldreader, a U.S. and European non-\nprofit organization, who is making digital books written by\nforeign and local authors and publishers available to children\nin the developing world. As of May 2013, they have distrib-\nSaharan Africa. Their initial evaluations, reported on their\nwebsite (http://www.worldreader.org), indicate marked\nimprovements in reading abilities and high levels of engage-\nment. In the Australian context, where children have comput-\ners readily available through schools and public libraries if not\nat home, such initiatives could be easily implemented involv-\ning the different ethno-linguistic communities, and they could\nbe expected to yield positive results in terms of motivating and\nengaging learners while meeting the design and implementa-\ntion principles (i.e., principles iv-vii) listed above.\nFamily Literacy Programs\n\"Book Floods,\" in the traditional and recent guises, have\nbeen implemented in child foreign-language-acquisition\ncontexts in which all children in a class are learning the same\nforeign language. The situation of minority languages in\nAustralia as described above involves a wide variety of lan-\nguages, and this poses additional challenges, one of these\nbeing the scarcity of trained teachers. One way of addressing\nthe linguistic diversity would be to make parents partners in\nthe literacy-development process. We turn now to two pro-\ngrams or interventions originating in the United States in the\nidea that parents can be instrumental in helping children\ndevelop literacy (Hancock, 2002). Although these projects\naimed at improving literacy in the mainstream language, the\nresults hold promise in the Australian situation.\nThe idea that parents can assist children in developing lit-\neracy is not new. Andersson (1981), for instance, argues that\nreading is learned rather than taught and that the best teacher\nis the one who is intimately associated with the child and\nprovides the environmental stimulation to learning through\noracy and literacy experiences (Gilliam, Parten Gerla, &\nWright, 2004). Furthermore, parents' participation can\nempower children in English-dominant classrooms by fos-\ntering a closer alignment between home and school practices\nprogress. A number of projects have been implemented fol-\nlowing these tenets. Of those, two are summarized below.\nProject ROAR (Reach Out and Read). This project was devel-\noped by Gilliam et al. (2004) and implemented in a predomi-\nnantly Hispanic elementary school in Texas, United States,\nin a low-socioeconomic area characterized by poor educa-\ntional levels in adults and low levels of adult literacy, a situ-\nation that applies to a number of emergent communities in\nAustralia, such as, for instance, the Dinka community from\nSouthern Sudan (cf. Commonwealth of Australia, 2009, p. 4\nparents want to enhance their children's academic success\nbut may not have the skills to do so or the confidence to try.\nTo address this challenge, university faculty and student vol-\nunteers engaged in interactive-literacy activities with parents\nand children, meeting monthly over a period of 10 months.\nSessions were conducted in a public library to familiarize\nparents with the venue and expose them to books they could\nborrow and included workshops on the importance of liter-\nacy, storytelling, basic techniques, and activities that parents\ncould implement at home. In evaluating the program, parents\nreported gains in their confidence, closer bonds between par-\nents and children, and increased enjoyment of books (prin-\nciple i). More important for our purposes, parents reported\nthat children were beginning to \"read\" to them and that older\nsiblings who did not enjoy reading previously were also\neagerly participating.\nWhile this project was conducted in English and only\nexplicitly addressed one of the principles we identified as\nnecessary to develop autonomous reading in the home lan-\nguage--although probably the most crucial one, increasing\nmotivation--it could easily be implemented in theAustralian\ncontext. Based around family practices, programs such as\nROAR offer families a nonthreatening experience (principle\nii), ease of accessibility (principle v), and the flexibility to\ncater for any language, age, and level of proficiency (princi-\nple iv), given the necessary resources. Moreover, the com-\nmunity could be involved in the creation of resources, thus\naddressing the issue of cultural relevance (principle iii).\nFRED (Families Reading Every Day) Books.This program,\ndeveloped by Hancock (2002), combines elements of the two\nprojects summarized above: quality books as in the \"Book\nFlood\" and parents' involvement as in the ROAR project.\nEisenchlas et al. 9\nHowever, it extends the discussion to the importance of\ndeveloping literacy initially in the home language. ROAR\nwas developed as a response to the challenge of teaching lin-\nguistically diverse populations resulting from the increase of\nminority-language children in American schools, a phenom-\nenon common to Australia. Hancock saw promise in using\nand building from what children already bring to the class,\nnamely, their home language. To test the claim that profi-\nciency in the home language facilitates the development of\nproficiency in the second language (Barac & Bialystok,\nCollier, 1997), Hancock conducted an experiment involving\n52 native Spanish-speaking kindergartners and FRED\nbooks--books that have been used in the United States since\nthe 1990s to develop pre-literacy skills in kindergarten chil-\ndren. In this study, Hispanic children were assigned ran-\ndomly to two conditions: The 26 children in the treatment\ngroup received FRED books written in Spanish, while the 26\nchildren in the control group received FRED books written\nin English. Each day, children took the books home for par-\nents to read to them. The results in standardized tests con-\nducted at the end of the semester supported the claims found\nin the literature: Children in the treatment group outper-\nformed children in the control group in pre-literacy skills. In\naddition, children in the treatment group performed no dif-\nferently than their native English-speaking classmates when\nexposed to books in English. These results provide further\nevidence that literacy in the home language does not nega-\ntively affect literacy in the majority language and points to\nthe gains that stem from out-of-school literacy initiatives.\nFurthermore, by being based in the home, the principles we\nidentified above were met by the ROAR project.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nThe final model discussed in this paper was designed by\nMackey (1991) in bilingual Acadia, Canada, to develop\nsecond-language acquisition through self-directed learning.\nThe basic premise of this program was that learners can teach\nthemselves a foreign language if sufficient stimulating mate-\nrials in the target language are made available and provided\nthat the learning process is scaffolded by organizing the\nmaterials according to learners'proficiency levels. The mate-\nrials used in this project were analyzed and coded for degree\nof difficulty, and menus were created to supply as much free-\ndom of choice as possible according to the child's level and\ninterests.\nParticipants were young children, aged 8 and up who\nwere provided with hundreds of books, audiotapes, videos,\nand software. Children selected books that seemed appeal-\ning. Because each book was linked to an audiotape, they\ncould either listen as they read or opt for reading or listening\nonly, for as long as they were interested in the task. The thor-\nough evaluation of the program provided evidence that\n\"children can learn a second language in the absence of\ntrained specialized second language teaching staff or native\nWhat distinguishes this program from traditional lan-\nguage teaching is, first, the direct contact with the new lan-\nguage, bypassing teachers' input. Second, it differs in its\nbelief that learners this young can and should be responsible\nfor their own learning. Children not only selected their mate-\nrials but also kept track of the work done by completing indi-\nvidualized control sheets. And third, the program was\ninnovative in its use of widespread and generally available\ntechnologies that handled the mechanical and repetitive tasks\nusually performed by teachers, while it catered for individual\nneeds, interests, and proficiency levels of students.\nThe self-directed learning program differs from the focus\nof this paper in that its aim was to develop second-language\nproficiency--rather than literacy in a home language that the\nchildren already speak. Another distinctive feature relates to\nthe participants' abilities, because at age 8 and above they\nwould already be literate, or at least could be expected to\nhave developed basic reading and writing skills, while we\nare looking for models to develop literacy from scratch.\nHowever, of all the models discussed in this paper, the self-\ndirected learning one seems to be the core and most impor-\ntant one for the Australian context, as it could fulfill all the\nprinciples required to promote autonomous learning while\nbypassing the need of trained teachers in many of the com-\nmunity languages: A wide variety of interesting materials\n(principle i) that are culturally and linguistically relevant\n(principle iii) could be created through community involve-\nment, thus making it cost-effective (principle vi) and easy to\nmaintain and expand (principle vii). Teachers who are native\nspeakers of the languages could be recruited to grade and\ncode materials according to levels of proficiency and ages\n(principle iv), thus scaffolding the learning process (princi-\nple ii). Moreover, because teachers would not be needed on\nlocation after the grading and coding are completed, schools\nand libraries could make these materials readily accessible\n(principle v).\nMoreover, in the two decades since this model was ini-\ntially introduced in Canada, the use of technology has grown\nexponentially. Computers are widely available and accessi-\nble from schools, public libraries, and homes in Australia,\nand software development and applications have become\nmuch more sophisticated and interactive. It would now be\neasy to supplement books (possibly even presented as\ne-books or online textual materials) with additional self-\naccess materials and activities, such as games, which would\nbe highly motivating for children. There are many reasons to\nbelieve that if a self-directed program is effective in teaching\na second language, it would be at least as effective in teach-\ning children to read in a language that they already speak\nfluently.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide recognition of the cognitive, affective, and\nsocial advantages associated with bilingualism in general\nand literacy in the home language in particular, community\nlanguages continue to be neglected in the Australian educa-\ntion system. This entails a loss of opportunities for individu-\nals, migrant and refugee groups, and the wider society. The\nlack of support for home languages stems not only from\nassimilationist-policy orientations but also from the widely\ndiverse ethno-linguistic composition of Australian society,\nwhich poses great practical challenges in the implementation\nof such programs, such as the lack of trained teachers in\nmany of the languages, diverse levels of competence in\nclasses, and scarcity of culturally relevant materials.\nIn this paper, we have attempted to address these chal-\nlenges by shifting the focus away from top-down approaches\nto literacy that would involve a large-scale policy shift to a\nbottom\u00adup approach based on nonformal educational prac-\ntices that could supplement mainstream education. To this\nend, we have proposed a number of principles that home-\nlanguage-literacy programs should meet to motivate chil-\ndren, involve the diverse communities in the responsibility\nof helping them become literate, and promote autonomy in\nlearners, so that the challenges originating from the tremen-\ndous linguistic diversity can be met. We have discussed some\ninnovative programs that, although designed for the develop-\nment of majority-language literacy or foreign languages\nmainly in classroom contexts, illustrate some of these prin-\nciples in action and have highlighted aspects of these pro-\ngrams that could be adapted to the linguistically and culturally\ndiverse Australian context.\nNeedless to say, there are costs involved in adapting and\nimplementing elements of these programs, in terms of human\nresources and materials development. For instance, the initial\ncollection of appropriate materials and the adaptation and\ndevelopment of new resources would be time-consuming and\ninvolve financial investment. However, we strongly believe\nthat, for all the reasons discussed in this paper, the cost for\nindividuals and societies of not investing in successful home-\nlanguage-literacy programs will eventually be higher than\nthat of implementing them.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n 1. This time period does not take into account the arrival of the\nancestors of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,\nwhich certain estimates date to as far back as 60,000 years ago\n 2. This is demonstrated by the current Migration Program. For the\nplaces. This comprises 60,885 places for family migrants\nwho are sponsored by family members already in Australia\n565 places for \"special eligibility\" migrants (0.3%). The\nHumanitarian Program is set at 20,000 places (Department\nof Immigration and Border Protection, 2013). Moreover, the\nlatest census of population reveals that Australia has one of\nthe highest proportions of overseas-born residents (27%), the\nthird highest behind Singapore (41.5%) and Hong Kong (39%;\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics, 2012a).\n 3. \"Longer-standing\" arrivals are those who arrived before 2007,\nand \"recent\" arrivals are those who arrived in the period from\nBureau of Statistics, 2012a, section on \"Cultural Diversity in\nAustralia\").\n 4. According to the then Minister for Trade, Dr Craig Emerson\nMP, in 2010, \"Australian exports generated more than 20 per-\ncent of Australia's gross domestic product. Both exports and\nimports create employment: One in five Australian jobs is\nrelated to trade and expanding our international trade will help\nsecure a high-skill, high-wage future\" (Australian Government\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2011).\n5. It is important to note that there is a \"substantial overlap\nbetween `foreign language' and `community language' [that]\nis either not recognized or only seen as a problem. Some of the\nmost frequently taught `foreign languages' (Chinese, German,\nItalian, Japanese, Korean) are also major `community lan-\nguages.'However, instead of recognizing this fact as an oppor-\ntunity, it is widely seen as a problem. Most heritage speakers\nend up being better off choosing another language or no lan-\nguage at all, than pursuing their heritage language through\nmainstream schooling,\" as \"heritage speakers\" are considered\nas having \"an unfair advantage\" over \"non-heritage learners\"\n 6. The term subordinate here should be understood in relation to\nthe asymmetrical power between the cultural and economic\nsupport afforded by English (the Australian majority lan-\nguage) as compared with the (at best) limited support given to\nindigenous and community languages (the Australian minority\nlanguages).\n7. The right of minorities to maintain their own language has\nbeen officially recognized by UNESCO (1960) and the United\n 8. The benefits of bilingualism are many and have been exten-\nsible documented, so we do not include a discussion of these\nhere. See Barac and Bialystok (2011) for a thorough review.\n 9. Possible drawbacks and challenges are addressed throughout\nthe paper in the relevant sections (e.g., issues affecting the\ntransition to the school environment).\n10. The First Report on the Progress and Assimilation of Migrant\nChildren in Australia (Commonwealth Immigration Advisory\nCouncil \u00ad Special Committee, 1960), noting that a minor-\nity of migrant children may lag behind their native-English-\nspeaking classmates, recommends implementing \"a national\ncampaign, particularly through foreign-language newspapers\nEisenchlas et al. 11\nto encourage parents to speak English in the home for their\nchildren's sake\" (p. 4). While, nationally, the value of bilin-\ngualism is now officially recognized (most recently in the Our\nLand Our Languages report; Commonwealth of Australia,\nnegligible part of the Australian population, who believe \"that\nit is a disadvantage for children to be learning two languages\nat the same time\" (p. 27), with parents and teachers being\n\"mistakenly advised that parents should give up speaking their\nlanguages at home so that children can learn English.\" This\nattitude is, for instance, evidenced in social blog discussions\nsuch as at http://www.mamamia.com.au/social/no-english-in-\n11. Similar conclusions have been previously reported in major\nreviews, such as Francis, Lesaux, and August (2006), Genesse,\nLindolm-Leary, Saunders, and Christian (2005), and Rolstad,\n12. This conclusion should not be taken as an argument in favor of\nsequential bilingualism. The findings relate to situations where\nminority-language speakers are submersed in the mainstream-\neducation system at early stages of acquisition of the majority\nlanguage.\n13. Although Cummins's discussion assumes the interdependence\nof two languages, his proposal would presumably also apply to\nspeakers brought up with more than two languages, provided\nthe children are motivated and have reached adequate levels of\nproficiency in each of their languages.\n14. For a discussion on whether it is better to expose children to\nsimultaneous or subsequent literacy, see Baker (2006) and ref-\nerences therein.\n15. In 2008, the government of the Northern Territory eliminated\nbilingual education in that part of Australia after more than\n30 years of operation, by mandating that the first 4 hr of each\nschool day be taught in English (see Devlin 2009). This deci-\nsion had detrimental effects such as a reduction in children's\nengagement and attendance at school (Dickson, 2012a). It has\nrecently been reversed, and the bilingual ban has been qui-\netly abandoned (Dickson, 2012b); however, the new Literacy\nFramework replacing the previous policy \"has been billed as a\nfar cry from genuine bilingual, bicultural education. It places\na primacy on reading and writing in English, while allowing\nchildren's home language to be used to explain new concepts\"\n16. Interestingly, it is to avoid intergenerational conflict that the\nFirst Report on the Progress and Assimilation of Migrant\nChildren in Australia (Commonwealth Immigration Advisory\nCouncil \u00ad Special Committee, 1960) recommended that par-\nents switch to English, not taking into account that is would be\neasier for children to maintain the home language than for par-\nents to acquire the new language to high levels of competence.\n17. Note, however, that this disregards all other languages spoken\nas home languages in Canada.\n18. The quoted report (Commonwealth ofAustralia, 2009) focuses\nexclusively on adult literacy, and, hence, its literacy improve-\nment results are not directly transferable to children's home-\nlanguage-literacy development.\ninvolved in self-directed-language acquisition.\nReferences\nAndersson, T.
