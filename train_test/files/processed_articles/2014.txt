This\nmethod is challenged using the phthalate di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) as an example. An alternate prediction approach based on human\nexperimental metabolism and urinary excretion data on DEHP was developed. This alternate model was developed from urine measurements of four\nmetabolites of DEHP from two individuals partaking in different experiments, for up to 44 h after known exposures. Particular attention was paid to the\nchanging ratios of the metabolites over time: they took a certain form when exposure was in the ``near'' (the past few hours) versus the ``distant'' (24 h or\nmore) past. The creatinine correction approach was applied to measurements of the same four metabolites from 18 individuals in the National Health\nAnd Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) 2003/2004. The alternate model was also applied to these individuals, and the results were compared.\nPredictions using the two methods were similar or the creatinine correction predicted higher concentrations when the ratio suggested that the DEHP\nexposure was ``near'' in time, but the alternate approach predicted intakes that were an order of magnitude higher when the ratios suggested that the\nintake was ``distant''. As much as 25% of all NHANES measurements contain metabolites whose key ratio suggest that exposure was ``distant''.\nUncertainties notwithstanding, the analysis in this article suggests that the creatinine correction approach should be used cautiously for DEHP and\npossibly other contaminants with similar exposure characteristics: rapid metabolism with metabolite urine elimination half-lives on the order of hours, and\nexposure patterns that may not be continuous and ongoing.\nIntroduction\nCreatinine is excreted from muscles and eliminated through\nurination on an ongoing basis. Equations relating an\nindividual's age, sex, and race to total daily elimination of\ncreatinine have been developed (Cockcroft and Gault, 1976;\nin a spot urine sample can be related back to a full daily\nexcretion of creatinine. If exposure to a contaminant is\ncontinuous, perhaps on a daily basis if not frequently within\na day and the primary means of elimination of that\ncontaminant is through urine, the creatinine correction\napproach can be used to estimate daily intake of that\ncontaminant. The premise is that, assuming steady state\nexposure and urinary excretion, daily intakes equal daily\nurinary eliminations. A ratio of a spot sample excretion of\ncreatinine and total daily excretion of creatinine should equal\nthe ratio of the spot sample excretion of the contaminant and\nthe total daily excretion of the contaminant. The purpose of\nthis study was to question this premise, as applied to the\nphthalate, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP).\nThe creatinine correction approach has been used to\nestimate intakes of a variety of contaminants. Biomonitoring\nprograms, such as the National Health and Nutrition\nEvaluation Survey (NHANES) or the German Environ-\nmental Surveys regularly measure creatinine in a urine\nsample along with other target constituents. It has been used\nfor a variety of pesticides (Fenske et al., 2000; Mage et al.,\n2004) and conservative (i.e., those that don not, or mostly\ndon not metabolize) contaminants such as perchlorate\n(Blount et al., 2007). In the case of contaminants that\nmetabolize, such as phthalates or pesticides, it is most often\nnot the parent compound that is measured but rather the\nmetabolites. Numerous researchers have used the approach\n1. Address all correspondence to: Matthew Lorber, Office of Research and\nDevelopment, United States Environmental Protection Agency, NCEA\nE-mail: lorber.matthew@epa.gov\nwww.nature.com/jes\napplied to phthalate metabolites to estimate daily intakes of\net al., 2006). These researchers base their estimate on the first\nmetabolite produced: the monoester phthalate metabolite.\nIn fact, parent phthalates are not measured in urine. The\nformation of metabolites of phthalates is so rapid that the\nparent phthalate is not expected to appear in urine, and a\nsecond justification given is that both sampling and\nlaboratory equipment may be contaminated with the parent\nphthalate. For DEHP, the first metabolite is mono-\n(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and it is this metabolite\nthat has been most often related to daily intakes using the\ncreatinine correction approach.\nHowever, the creatinine correction approach is only as\nvalid as the key assumption of steady state intakes. To be\nmore precise, this approach is only as valid as an assumption\nthat excretions are steady over time. Such steadiness would\noccur if intakes were steady and daily, but excretions might\nalso be reasonably consistent over time if the intakes occurred\nless frequently, say once every 3 days, but the elimination in\nurine was very slow, say with half-lives on the order of days.\nIn reality, and as discussed below in more detail, DEHP\nmetabolites are eliminated with half-lives on the order of\nhours, not days. MEHP, for example, has a half-life that has\nbeen measured at 5 h. Given this fact, one does not know if a\nconcentration of MEHP in urine resulted from an exposure\nin the recent few hours, or if it was the result of a very high\nexposure the previous day or two. Very little is known about\nthe day-to-day or within-day patterns of DEHP intake.\nWormuth et al. (2006) provide one of the few comprehensive\nevaluations of intakes of phthalates based on model\ncalculations. Their approach is a ``forward'' approach to\nestimating intakes. That is, they model intake of phthalates\nthrough consumption of food, intake from consumer\nproducts, inhalation, and dust/soil exposures based on\nparent phthalate concentrations in these exposure media in\ncombination with contact rates. Their analysis encompasses\nseveral phthalates for Europeans of several age ranges.\nThey found that exposures were highest for DEHP, at\nbetween 1 and 5 mg/kg/day for children, teens, and adults.\nExposures were always higher for infants, getting above\n10 mg/kg/day for DEHP. Ingestion of food dominated\nfor DEHP. There was much variability (the range from\nminimal to maximal exposures within consumer groups\nwas about a factor of 100) and uncertainty in this exercise,\nbased primarily on the paucity of data on phthalates in\nfood or consumer products. Franco et al. (2007) conducted a\nquantitative assessment using two forward modeling\napproaches focusing on individual pathways of exposure,\nsimilar to that conducted by Wormuth et al. (2006).\nBy one method, they arrived at a median total daily\nintake of 5.6 mg/kg/day for DEHP, but by the other\nmethod, they arrived at much lower median intake of\nOne key aspect of both forward and backward approaches\nis that they assume average, steady state behaviors. Average\nbehaviors are, in reality, a mix of typical behaviors, as well as\nextremes at both ends. An average daily consumption rate of\na food, for example, could very easily arise from a meal of\nthat food one day and then no consumption for several days.\nIf phthalates are associated with the food, then this exposure\ncould result in elevated concentrations of metabolites in the\nurine for several hours after the exposure, but much smaller\nto trace concentrations in the days following. The potential\nissue with use of the creatinine correction approach is now\napparent F a low concentration could mistakenly imply a\nlow daily intake when in reality a large intake may have\ncaused the low concentration.\nThe problem becomes more exaggerated as the rate of\nelimination increases F when elimination occurs much\nmore rapidly. The elimination half-life of MEHP has been\nreported as 5 h in a human metabolism experiment\n(Koch et al., 2005b), so that 24 h after exposure, five half-\nlives have passed, and only about 3% of the total mass\nof MEHP that was formed by the exposure remains to be\neliminated. It is easy to see that a day following an exposure\nto DEHP, the concentration of MEHP could be very low or\nfall below a detection limit. Meanwhile, secondary metabo-\nlites could be still forming if their rate of formation and\nexcretion is slower than that of MEHP. Koch et al. (2005b)\nmeasured four additional metabolites of DEHP in the\nexperiment, and found that these secondary metabolites of\nDEHP have elimination half-lives in the range of 10\u00ad15 h.\nThis implies that MEHP might be a poor candidate as an\nindication of exposure to DEHP. Indeed, Barr et al. (2003)\nadvocated the urinary analysis of secondary metabolites of\nphthalates as perhaps better indicators of exposure, com-\npared with the monoester primary phthalate metabolites, for\njust this reason. The NHANES program now measures for\nmore than just MEHP, the primary metabolite of DEHP.\ntertiary metabolites of DEHP were measured and four\nsecondary metabolites) were used in this study.\nThis article explores the possibility that a relationship\nbetween a tertiary and a secondary metabolite of DEHP in\nurine can shed light on the timing and magnitude of exposure\nto DEHP. Experimental data were obtained from two\nindividuals: one who self-dosed and one whose exposure\nwas through an apheresis blood platelet donation procedure.\nBoth exposures were substantially elevated above back-\nground (see discussions below). The exposures were halted\nand then urine was collected and analyzed for five primary\nDEHP metabolites for up to 48 h after the exposure. Initial\nhigh concentrations of DEHP metabolites in urine declined\nrapidly over the 24 h following exposure. Urine samples were\ntaken up to 24 h after the apheresis procedure ended and 44 h\nafter the self-dosed exposure. These data show not only\nCritical evaluation of creatinine correction approach Lorber et al.\ndeclines over time, but also changes in the relationships of\nmetabolites to each other. It is this trend of changing\nrelationships that is exploited in the draft model developed in\nthis study.\nThe simple model proposed in this study, which is not\nconsidered mature enough for general usage, is based on the\nexperimental data from these two individuals. Specifically a\nconcentration ratio between a tertiary and a secondary\nmetabolite is developed. When this ratio is near 1.0, the\nhypothesis is that exposure was recent, for example within the\npast few hours. However, when this ratio is greater than 1.0,\nin the range of 1.5\u00ad2.0 and higher, the hypothesis is that\nexposure occurred several hours earlier, greater than 10 h or\neven the previous day. Individual measurements of DEHP\nmetabolites in urine are retrieved from the NHANES 2003/\n2004 database. Subsequently, assuming these profiles of\nDEHP metabolites each arose from a single exposure (and\nthis assumption is explored in the discussion section later),\nthe ratio of the secondary metabolites informs as to whether\nthe exposure was ``near'' in time to the measurement or\n``distant'' in time from the measurement. Then, the proposed\nmodel (with a differing coefficient based on the ``near'' or\n``distant'' judgment) is used to estimate the single dose, which\nmay have produced the measurement. Concurrently, the\nNHANES measurements, including pertinent demographic\ndata, are used in the creatinine correction model to estimate\nintakes. The two sets of estimates are compared, and\nimportant differences are observed. As inferred from the\ndiscussions above, when the exposure was in the ``distant'' past,\nthe creatinine correction approach estimated much less of a daily\nintake, by factors of 10 or more, as compared with the alternate\napproach. When the exposure was ``near'', both methods\nestimated comparable intakes, and in fact, the creatinine\ncorrection approach estimated higher intakes in some cases.\nMaterials and methods\nFollowing an exposure to DEHP, the first metabolite generated\nis the monoester metabolite, MEHP. Numerous secondary and\ntertiary metabolites are generated, but four others have\nbeen measured in urine: mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phth-\nalate (5oxo-MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phtha-\nlate (5OH-MEHP), mono ((2-carboxymethy)hexyl) phthalate\n(2cx-MMHP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate,\n(5cx-MEPP). This study focuses on four of the five metabolites:\nMEHP, 5oxo-MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, and 5cx-MEPP. The\nestimated elimination half-lives (in hours) and percentage\nof total dose that appears in urine after 24 h for the five\nfor 2xc-MMHP. Excretions of the four metabolites studied in\nthis study explain about 63% of the initial intake of DEHP;\n2cx-MMHP (the metabolite not researched here) explains only\nabout 4% of the total intake. The tertiary metabolite,\n5cx-MEPP, has the longest half-life, and is the second most\ndominant metabolite with regard to how much of the\ninitial molar dose it explains. The secondary metabolite,\n5OH-MEHP, is the highest at 23.3% with 5cx-MEPP next\nat 18.5%. What these facts translates to, in practical terms and\nfor purposes in this study, is that while other metabolites are\nforming and being excreted at a more rapid pace than 5cx-\nMEPP, it is this tertiary metabolite that eventually dominates\nthe profile of a urine sample of DEHP metabolites. Assuming\nno other exposure to DEHP occurs, the data below show that,\ninitially after exposure, 5OH-MEHP is the metabolite with the\nhighest concentration. After about 10 h or so, 5cx-MEPP\nbecomes the metabolite with the highest concentration, and\nremains as such, as the intake of DEHP is being depleted over\nthe 48h or so after exposure ceases. In other words, initially\nafter exposure, the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP in a\nspot urine sample is less than 1.0, but after 10 h or so, this ratio\nexceeds 1.0. The ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP in a spot\nurine sample will be the indicator used below in the model to\nindicate whether the exposure was in the ``near'' or ``distant'' past.\nExperimental data were retrieved for two individuals,\nincluding an individual who self-dosed at an amount\nsignificantly higher than typical background exposures and\nan individual whose elevated exposure was due to an\napheresis blood platelet donation procedure. The Supple-\nmentary Material includes data on three other individuals\nwho fasted. As the data and discussion will show, key trends\nin these fasting individuals mirror those of these two highly\ndosed individuals. Following is a summary of the experi-\nmental data for the two highly dosed individuals. A listing of\nthe detailed data for these individuals is provided in the\nSupplementary Material to this article.\nSelf-dosed Individual\nThis individual, 61 years old and having 75 kg body weight,\nself-dosed an amount of 48.5 mg DEHP by consuming a\npiece of buttered toast into which stable-isotope-labeled\nDEHP was mixed. Concentrations of five metabolites of\nDEHP in his urine were measured over the next 44 h.\nOn a body weight basis, this 48.5 mg translates to 650 mg/kg.\nThis differs from median intakes determined from urine\nmeasurements and the creatinine correction approach that\nranges from about 1 mg/kg/day in the United States (Lorber\net al., 2010) to 5 mg/kg/day based on urine measurements\nfrom German study participants (Wittassek et al., 2007b).\nAs observed, this dose is clearly elevated above background\nand this is observed also in the urine concentration data.\nFor example, concentrations of MEHP in the first several\nsamples from this individual (through about 10 h) ranged\npopulation of MEHP concentrations of about 10 mg/l\nCritical evaluation of creatinine correction approach\nLorber et al.\nexposure, both were below 5000 mg/l, and 5cx-MEPP was\nconsistently higher in concentration than 5OH-MEHP, and\nthe highest of all metabolites for the remainder of the 44 h of\nmeasurements. All metabolites declined to below 100 mg/l by\nthe end of the 44 h.\nApheresis Platelet Donation Individual\nThis male individual, aged 35 years having 83 kg body\nweight, underwent a dual-needle continuous flow platelet\napheresis procedure, which involved use of components\n(tubings, bags, catheters, etc.) containing PVC plasticized\nwith DEHP. Details of the procedure and the measurement\nof five DEHP metabolites in this individual's urine up to 24 h\nafter exposure are described in Koch et al. (2005a, c).\nConcentrations of the four metabolites considered in this\narticle peaked at 4 h after the end of the procedure at\n5oxo-MEHP, and 5cx-MEPP, respectively. Note that the\nconcentration of 5cx-MEPP is less than that of 5OH-MEHP\nfor this measurement. After about 8 h, the 5cx-MEPP\nconcentration was the highest of all metabolites, and it\nremained that way for all remaining urination events.\nConcentrations of all metabolites were under 200 mg/l after\nabout 12 h and under 65 mg/l after 24 h. On the basis of total\nmass excreted (i.e., not based on creatinine), Koch et al.\n(2005c) estimated that the dose of DEHP received by this\nindividual was 2.6 mg, or about 31 mg/kg. It is noteworthy\nthat, like the self-dosed individual, the dose and measured\nurine concentrations, were higher than typical background\nexposures several hours after the exposure.\nFigures 1 displays the change in this key ratio, the\nconcentration of the tertiary metabolite 5cx-MEPP to the\nsecondary metabolite 5OH-MEHP, over time following\ncessation of the exposure, for these two individuals. The\nkey trend to note is that this ratio increases throughout most\nof the experiment. For the self-dosed individual with 2 days\nof urinations, the ratio continued to rise well into the second\nday, staying over 2 and once above 3, until the last two\nevents at hours 43 and 44. These last two urination events\nshow a ratio more like 1.5 and could have been the result\nof the individual's metabolism or some other phenomena. As\nthe DEHP was labeled for this self-dosed individual, the\nmeasured metabolites were uniquely identified and the\nconcentrations are known to be the result of the experimental\nintake. The ratios of the apheresis individual rise continually,\nwith a peak at about 1.85 at the end of the 24-h urine\ncollection period. The benefit of these experiments at high\ndoses is that the trends observed are mostly not influenced by\nbackground exposures, and one could surmise that they\nrepresent what would happen with any single background\ndose at a much lower level. This assumes, of course, that the\nmetabolism and disposition of a background intake is\nreasonably analogous to that of the high self-imposed\nand apheresis intakes. If a background dose of phthalate\noccurs as the result of an inhalation exposure, a skin-\napplied cosmetic or a time-release pharmaceutical, then the\ntrends in urine concentrations might be different compared with\nan oral dose or a dose directly delivered to the blood stream.\nThe data from the two highly exposed individuals will be\nused in the general model developed in this study and used\nalong with the creatinine correction approach to estimate\nintakes. On the basis of an examination of the ratios, three\n``conditions'' after exposure are defined, with the first being\nshortly after exposure when the ratios are near 1.0, the\nsecond reflecting a ratio of about 1.5, which would occur 8\u00ad\n16 h after exposure, and the last, when the ratio is above 2,\nwhich might reflect an exposure 24 h or more after exposure.\nFor each condition, a simple ``multiplier'' is developed,\nwhich relates the concentration of 5OH-MEHP in urine to\nthe intake dose, as:\nwhere MULTi\n\u00bcmultiplier for condition i; DOSE \u00bc\nintake dose of DEHP, mg; 48.5 mg for the self-dosed\nindividual, and 2.6 mg for the apheresis patient; C5OHi\n\u00bc\nrepresentative concentration of 5OH-MEHP in urine during\ncondition i, mg/l.\nWith the units of MULTi\nin ``l'' (liter), a multiplication of\nthis value by a urine concentration of 5OH-MEHP expressed\nwith a denominator in liters as well (mg/l, mg/l, etc.) will give\nthe single event dose of DEHP in mass consistent with the\nmass unit of the 5OH-MEHP concentration (mg, mg). This\ndose can be divided by the individual's body weight to\nprovide a single event dose on a body weight basis, such as\nmg/kg body weight.\nA few caveats in this study are noted before assigning\nvalues of the MULT, based on the three conditions and the\nHours After Exposure\nRatio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP\nFigure 1. Ratio of the secondary metabolites, 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-\nMEHP for high-dosed individuals (pink squares are apheresis patient,\nand black diamonds are self-dosed individual; see text for more detail).\nThe color reproduction of this figure is available on the html full text\nversion of the manuscripts.\nCritical evaluation of creatinine correction approach Lorber et al.\ntwo individuals. First, this approach importantly assumes\nthat the urine profile of DEHP metabolites resulted from a\nsingle exposure in the past, and is not the result of many\nongoing intakes. As the MULT values are based on a single\ndose from the two individuals, this same scenario is assumed\nin application of the MULT values. This is obviously a\ncritical but not unreasonable assumption. Certainly if dietary\nexposures are the primary exposures for DEHP, then a dose\nduring a given meal might be the only dose received that day.\nWith elimination half-lives on the order of hours (5\u00ad15 h),\nmetabolites from a given exposure are largely excreted within\na 24-h period. Certainly, at background ongoing exposures\nthere could be exposures other than those received at a single\nmeal, there could be some delayed metabolism, and other\nfactors that explain a given profile of metabolites. Second,\nthere is no specific reason that the concentration used in Eq.\n(1) is that of 5OH-MEHP, although benefits to 5OH-MEHP\nare that it is typically among the highest concentrations in a\nprofile of DEHP metabolites, it is not the first metabolite\nformed, and it is consistently quantified. In conclusion, it is\nassumed that the patterns of metabolism in the highly dosed\nindividuals, and in particular the changing ratios over time,\nare similar to those experienced in the background popula-\ntion even though individual episodes of exposure in the\ngeneral population are likely to be much less than in these\ntwo conditions.\nWith that as backdrop, urine events are now selected from\nthe two individuals to develop the values of MULT\ncorresponding to three conditions: condition ``1'': Near the\ntime of exposure, ratio near 1.0; condition ``2'': eight or more\nhours after exposure, ratio near 1.5; and condition ``3'': 20 h\nor more after exposure, ratio near or greater than 2.0. These\n``near'', ``intermediate'', and ``far in time'' conditions were\nchosen based on best judgment and an examination of the\ntrends seen in Figure 1. Table 1 has the selection of these\nevents. Three events are selected from the data on the\napheresis patient, the last being the last event measured at\n23.5 h, when the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP was\n1.85. The self-dosed individual tended to have many more\nurination events (and lower volume per event) than the\napheresis patient F 14 over the first 24 h compared with\n6 for the apheresis patient. For this reason, clusters of three\nevents representing each condition were selected to generate\nthe MULT values for this individual. The total mass of each\nmetabolite was summed and divided by the total urine\nvolume over those three events to get the concentrations\nobserved in Table 1. It is importantly noted that the middle\ncondition, when the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP is\nabout 1.5, comes at a later time for the self-dosed individual\nas compared with the apheresis individual. This could have\nbeen the result of the self-dosed individual's age F he was 61\nat the time of the experiment compared with 35 for the\napheresis patient. His metabolism may have been slower. The\nroute of exposure F oral for the 61 year old, who self-dosed\nversus intravenous for the 35-year-old apheresis patient F\ncould also have made a difference in metabolism patterns. In\nany case, concentrations had declined a lot more (relatively\nspeaking) at hours 13\u00ad18 for the self-dosed individual as\ncompared with 7.7 h of the apheresis patient. This resulted in\na MULT about a factor of 10 higher in the self-dosed\nindividual for this second condition. The MULT for the\nother two conditions of interest were similar for both\nindividuals, different only by a factor of 2\u00ad3.\nNow that the alternate model is set up with these ratios\nand MULT values, the next step is to apply the model to\nNHANES data.

The\ncreatinine correction approach is applied to all four\nmetabolites and the total concentration, and the MULT\nmethod is applied to each individual using both values of\nMULT. Several trends are apparent from this table, and they\nare provided here in list form:\n(1) The most important result, for purposes of the analysis in\nthis article, is that the predictions for condition 3, when\nthe ratio of the secondary metabolites suggest an intake\nthat occurred in the most distant past (24 h or more), are\nsignificantly different between the creatinine correction\napproach and the MULT approach. The MULT\napproach leads to intakes that are between about 10\nand 50 times higher than the creatinine correction\napproach for five of the six individuals; it is only higher\nby factors near and less than five for the other individual.\nIn contrast, the predictions are about the same between\nthe creatinine correction and the MULT approach for\ncondition 1 F when the ratio of the secondary meta-\nbolites suggests an exposure in the more recent past. In\nfact, the MULT predictions based on the apheresis\nIndividual code Creatinine correction based on four metabolites and total concentration, mg/kg/day Multiplier method, mg/kg/day\nMEHP 5OH-MEHP 5oxo-MEHP 5cx-MEPP Totala Apheresis Self-dose\n1a, b, c, d, e, f \u00bc Ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP is o1.0.\n2a, b, c, d, e, f \u00bc Ratio of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP is near 1.5.\na``Total'' is the creatinine-based prediction based on the sum of the concentrations of DEHP metabolites (the total concentration); see text for more detail.\nCritical evaluation of creatinine correction approach\nLorber et al.\npatient for condition 1 are mostly lower than the\ncreatinine correction approach.\n(2) For condition 2, when the ratio of the secondary\nmetabolites suggests an exposure 8\u00ad16 h range in the\nrecent past, the results are different depending on the\nMULTused. They are comparable when the MULT was\ndetermined based on the apheresis patient and took on a\nvalue of about 8, but are much higher for the MULT\napproach when the value of the MULT was about 90\nbased on the self-dosed individual's data.\n(3) Looking just at the creatinine correction predictions,\nseveral important observations are made, which include:\n(a) They are similar among the four metabolites in five of\nsix cases examined under condition 1, when the\nexposure is ``near'' the measurement. It is observed\nfrom Table 2 that the concentration of MEHP is\nabout a factor of three to five lower than the other\nthree metabolites in five of the six individuals in\ncondition 1. As well, the concentrations of the other\nthree metabolites are within about a factor of two of\neach other. These relationships are consistent with the\nrelationships between the fractions of each metabolite\neliminated after 24 hours from a given dose of DEHP\ndiscussed earlier (which are also the ``Fue'' fraction\nparameter used in the creatinine correction approach,\nEq. (2)). The individual identified as ``1a'' had a\nunique trend in this group in that the concentration of\nMEHP, whereas high at 63 mg/l, is still well over an\norder of magnitude lower than the other metabolites,\nwhich had concentrations in the thousands of mg/l. In\nthis case, the prediction based on MEHP was\nappropriately lower by about an order of magnitude\ncompared with the other metabolites.\n(b) In conditions 2 and 3, predictions of DEHP intake\nbased on MEHP are now the lowest and 5cx-MEPP\npredictions now the highest. As can be observed from\nTable 2, MEHP concentrations are following further\nbehind that of the other three metabolites in condition\n2 compared with condition 1, and 5cx-MEPP is\ngetting further ahead of the other metabolites. The\ncreatinine-based predictions track these trends. In\ncondition 3, 5cx-MEPP is now even further from the\nother three metabolites as compared with the other\ncategories, and this is reflected in a similar discre-\npancy in creatinine-based predictions F those based\non 5cx-MEPP are 3\u00ad5 times higher than those based\non MEHP, 5OH-MEHP, or 5oxo-MEHP.\n(c) Predictions based on the total concentration, all fall\nwithin the middle of the predictions bracketed by the\nlowest predictions based on MEHP and the highest\npredictions based on 5cx-MEPP. This might argue\nfor the consistent use of a total concentration when\nusing the creatinine correction approach for estimat-\ning intakes. It might compensate for any misleading\npredictions based on subtleties that could occur at the\nextremes shown by MEHP and 5cx-MEPP.\n(4) All of the trends noted above are the same whether\nhigh or more typical. Whereas creatinine-based predic-\ntions appears close together for the low concentrations,\nthere were actually similar proportional differences as\nwere noted aboveFthese are masked when rounding to\nthe nearest whole number for the table. Most impor-\ntantly, the patterns when using the MULT approach are\nthe same whether the NHANES concentrations are high\nor typical. Specifically, there is a factor of 10 or more\ndifference between the MULT predictions and the\ncreatinine predictions in condition 3, regardless of\nwhether the NHANES concentrations are high or low.\nAll of these trends in both concentrations and intakes are\nconsistent with the premise that the urine concentrations\nexposure, and that this most recent exposure could have\noccurred very ``near'' the time of sampling (``condition 1'' F\na few hours earlier) or could even have occurred ``distant''\nfrom the time of sampling (``condition 3'' F 24 h or more\nbefore the urine sample was taken). In addition, this most\nrecent exposure could have been large in magnitude or small.\nAs discussed earlier, the profile of metabolites in the urine will\nchange over time from a given intake of DEHP, assuming no\nfurther exposures occur. All metabolites will decline in\nconcentration, but MEHP will decline the fastest because it\nhas a short elimination half-life of 5 h, and eventually 5cx-\nMEPP will dominate the profile as it has the longest half-life\nof all metabolites at 15 h. If the most recent intake of DEHP\noccurred 24 h or more before the urine sample than the\nmeasurements of metabolites in the urine might not be good\nindicators of daily exposure. Certainly, for MEHP, five half-\nlives have occurred by the urine sampling time, and the\nconcentration is subsequently very low in comparison to\nwhat it might have been had urine samples been taken near\nthe time of exposure. In this case, using MEHP to calculate\ndaily intake of DEHP might result in a significant\nunderprediction of the actual DEHP exposure from the\nprevious day.\nThe Supplementary Material includes an evaluation of the\ncreatinine correction approach applied to the two highly\ndosed individuals (as creatinine was also measured in the\nurine along with the DEHP metabolites). It is shown that\ninitially for about 8 h after exposure, the creatinine correction\napproach would overestimate the known intake, but after\nthat intakes are underestimated, by up to a factor of 10 after\noverestimation is not unexpected as the creatinine correction\napproach implicitly assumes that every urination event\nrepresents an average for the day, but with first order\nelimination kinetics, the initial mass excreted will be higher\nCritical evaluation of creatinine correction approach Lorber et al.\nthan an average with subsequent excretions much lower than\nan average. By the second day after the elevated exposure,\nonly small amounts are excreted by the two individuals and\nconsequently, the creatinine correction approach predicts\nsmall intakes.\nOne can now begin to formulate hypotheses about proper\ninterpretation of NHANES results using the creatinine\ncorrection approach. If a urine sample is taken after an\nexposure to DEHP, on the same day of that exposure, there\nmay be some overprediction and some underprediction, such\nthat the creatinine correction approach on average might give\na reasonable approximation of exposure. The same might be\ntrue if the exposure was during the previous night and the\nsample was taken next morning. However, if the sample was\ntaken perhaps 24 h or more after the exposure, the under-\nprediction might be by a factor of 10 or more. As an\nexample, say an exposure of 10 units occurred on day 1 and\nthe measurement was taken that same day after the exposure.\nThe creatinine correction might be predicting anywhere from,\nsay, 3\u00ad20 units. However, if the measurement is taken more\nthan 24 h later with no further exposures to DEHP, the\ncreatinine correction approach might suggest an exposure of\n1 unit. If taken 2 days later, the creatinine correction might\nsuggest an exposure of 0.1 unit.\nAn underprediction of intakes might be frequent and a\nstrong deterrent to the regular use of the creatinine correction\napproach for DEHP. To gain further insight as to what\nNHANES is saying with regard to DEHP exposure, in the\ncontext of the evaluation in this study, the NHANES 2003/\n2004 database, including measurements of the four DEHP\nmetabolites, was rank ordered in two ways: (1) one rank\nordering was based on the concentration of MEHP, from\nlowest to highest MEHP, and (2) the second rank order was\nbased on the ratio examined in this article, the ratio of the\nconcentrations of 5cx-MEPP to 5OH-MEHP, from lowest to\nhighest ratio. For each rank ordering, the key ratio was\nexamined as well as the average concentrations of the four\nmetabolites. Results of this rank ordering are shown in\nTable 4. Looking at the rank ordering based on MEHP\nconcentrations (the first half of the table), it is observed that\nthe first quartile is composed entirely of nondetects for\nMEHP. The average concentration for the second quartile is\n1.3 mg/l. The maximum of that quartile, or the median\nconcentration in the dataset (however, not the population-\nweighted median), is 2.2 mg/l. The averages of the key ratio\nfor these two quartiles were 1.7 and 2.4. The nondetects and\nlow MEHP concentrations of these two lower quartiles, in\ncombination with high ratios, suggests that this half of the\nNHANES data set is comprised of individuals whose\nexposures to DEHP could be in the (relatively) distant past,\nperhaps more than 8 h and even more than 24 h. As discussed\nabove, the creatinine correction may be underestimating\nintakes if the exposure was 8 h or more in the past. The\nconcentrations increased for the other half of the NHANES\ndata set, with average quartile MEHP concentrations of 3.7\nand 25.7 mg/l. The ratios for the second two quartiles\ndeclined to 1.6 and 1.4. Thus, for this half of NHANES,\nthe weight-of-evidence suggests that exposures were more\nrecent and the creatinine correction might give more\nappropriate estimates, or even overestimates, of these\nexposures. A similar overall finding is noted when examining\nthe second half of the table, which shows the rank ordering\nbased on the key ratio. When it is low, as in the first quartile\nthat has an average ratio of 1.0, the MEHP concentration is\nhigh: 13.3 mg/l. MEHP concentration declines as the key\nratio increases.\nConclusions\nThe findings in this study hinge on the key assumption that\nprofile of DEHP metabolites in urine reflects only the most\nrecent exposure, even if that exposure was 24 h or more in the\npast. The issue is just that: can a ratio of 2 (or thereabouts)\nbetween the tertiary and secondary metabolites be explained\nby an exposure scenario other than the most recent exposure\nTable 4. Rank order of NHANES data on metabolite concentrations of DEHP by MEHP concentrations and by the ratio of 5cx-MEPP to\nDescription Quartilea Average\nmetabolite ratio\nAverage metabolite concentration, mg/l\nCritical evaluation of creatinine correction approach\nLorber et al.\nbeing 24 h earlier (or thereabouts; barring measurement\nerror, of course)? Whether the answer to this question is an\nunambiguous ``yes'', then the analysis in this article might be\nquestioned, because the alternate model is based on single\nhigh exposures to two individuals and the ratios that resulted\nfrom these exposures over time. At the very least, the analysis\nin this article represents a limiting case F that the exposures\nto these individuals are indeed representative of one possible\nexposure scenario which members in the general population\n(e.g., as represented in NHANES) are also experiencing.\nActually, one can probably go further than that. If the\nelimination of DEHP metabolites does follow first-order\nkinetics with overall elimination of half-lives of the key\nmetabolites on the order of 10\u00ad15 h, progressing from\ngeneration of primary, secondary, and then tertiary metabo-\nlites, then a qualitative (or a quantitative given time)\nargument can be made that a ratio of 2 can occur only\nmany hours after a single bolus exposure. Otherwise, no\nother scenario could result in this high a ratio, as subsequent\nand even smaller exposures would produce new mass of\nmetabolites, added to the reservoir of metabolites from the\nearlier dose, such that a high ratio between 5cx-MEPP and\n5OH-MEHP would not occur in urine. It stands to reason\nthat ratios near 1.0 (in the context of the analysis in this\narticle) can only be explained by one or more exposures near\nthe time of urine measurement in the same way that high\nratios greater than 2 can only be explained by single distant\nexposures.\nHowever, this remains the key uncertainty of this analysis.\nOther uncertainties exist as well. The alternate model is based\non exposures of two individuals that were elevated over\nbackground. As elevated exposures, there could be patterns\nof metabolism that might not be observed in the general\npopulation mostly experiencing lower exposures. Insight as\nto this possibility is gained from a discussion of data in the\nSupplementary Materials. That analysis shows the key ratio\nof this study in urine samples of three individuals after they\nceased eating, and for 2 days afterwards. The general trend is\nthat, like the two individuals experiencing high exposures, the\nratio is initially near 1.0, but with time, it rises to over 2.0,\nthen dips, and then rises again. Overall, the concentrations\ndecline from the first urination event to levels one-tenth as\nhigh by 24 h and throughout the rest of the fast. These trends\nsupport the hypothesis that food was the primary source of\nDEHP exposure to these individuals, and that over time, the\ntertiary DEHP metabolite, 5cx-MEPP, will dominate the\nprofile. However, the rise in the ratio followed by the decline\nand then another rise, suggest a mechanism of delayed\nmetabolism or release of metabolites from body storages.\nOther factors that that could affect metabolism include\nage, sex, race, method of exposure (oral, dermal, intrave-\nnous, and inhalation), and other factors. More longitudinal\ndata on individuals with known exposures is needed, but this\ndata could not be found in the literature.\nNHANES presents results in terms of percentiles, and the\n50th percentile, or the median, is often portrayed as the best\nindicator of a central tendency of exposure. However, is it\nreally the best indicator? Further considering the hypothetical\nscenario portrayed earlier, in which the creatinine correction\napproach might correctly suggest an intake of 10 units on the\nday when the 10 units exposure occurred, but then 1.0 and\n0.1 unit exposure occurred for the next 2 days. If this\nindividual's urine is sampled on these three days, the median\nexposure would be estimated as 1.0 units. Is this the best\nindicator of the central tendency for this individual? Taking it\nfurther, say an entire population is exposed once every 3 days\nto ``10'' units of DEHP, and a random survey takes 1/3 of all\nsamples on the day of exposure, 1/3 the day after exposure,\nand 1/3 2 days after exposure. The ``actual'' mean exposure\nis 3.3 units, and if the creatinine correction were applied to\nevery measurement, one would calculate a mean exposure of\n3.7 units. Maybe a better indicator of a central tendency of\nexposure to DEHP and other phthalates could be obtained\nby using the creatinine correction method on all samples and\nthen taking the mean, instead of relying on a median.\nFrom a public health perspective, maybe the most\nimportant concern raised in this analysis is the proper\nidentification and interpretation of those most exposed to\nMEHP as 31.0 mg/l as though this concentration represented\nthe 95th percentile in exposure. But maybe all it represents is\na concentration that would result from an exposure (lunch\nperhaps) that occurred a few hours before the sample was\ntaken. Maybe the highest exposures are those where MEHP\nis nondetected in the sample, as discussed earlier. Looking\nagain at the order of the rank based on the key ratio between\nindividuals). MEHP was nondetected (DL \u00bc 0.6) in 75%\nof these samples. Would the creatinine correction equation\napplied to these individuals have underpredicted DEHP\nintakes by up to 2 orders of magnitude?\nAlthough there are uncertainties with the analysis in this\narticle, it nonetheless suggests that the creatinine correction\napproach be applied cautiously for contaminants, which\nshare these key similarities to phthalates: (1) whereas\nexposure is widespread in a population (even 100% of\nindividuals showing evidence of exposure through urine\nmeasurements), the exact pattern of exposure is still\nuncertain. It is not known whether exposures occur once\nper day, multiple times within a day, or only sporadically\n(every few days or more), and (2) the elimination half-lives of\nthe metabolites are on the order of hours such that\nelimination is substantially complete by 24 h.\nAlthough pointing out these issues, this study cannot,\nhowever, suggest a viable alternative to the creatinine correction\napproach at this time. With more experimental data and study\non the human metabolism of phthalates, a simple model, such\nCritical evaluation of creatinine correction approach Lorber et al.\nas the one developed from the two individuals, could provide a\nmore valid indication of the timing and magnitude of recent\nDEHP exposures. Concurrently, it is recommended that further\nstudy on exposure should focus on the pathways of exposure\nand the concentrations found in important exposure matrices,\nincluding food, air, dust, water, cosmetics, medications, and\nother exposure media.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nDisclaimer\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the authors\nand do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the German Research\nInstitute of Occupational Medicine, or the Friedrich-\nAlexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany.\nMention of trade names or commercial products does not\nconstitute endorsement or recommendation for use.\nReferences\nBarr D.B., Silva M.F., Kato K., Reidy J.A., Malek N.A., Hurtz D.,\nSadowski M., Needham L.L., and Calafat A.M.
