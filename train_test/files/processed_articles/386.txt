NHANES of the National Center for Health\nStatistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides\ncross-sectional, nationally representative health examina-\ntion data on the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population.\nA complex, multistage probability sampling design is used to\nple included oversampling of youth aged 12\u00ad19 years, Mexican\nAmericans, and blacks. The procedures to select the sample\nand conduct the interview and examination have been previ-\nexamined.\nMeasurements. The average of up to three brachial systolic\n(first Korotkoff phase) and diastolic (fifth Korotkoff phase) BP\nreadings were used as the participants' systolic and diastolic\nBP values. In NHANES III 94% had three BP measurements;\nAppropriate BP cuff sizes were used for participants based on\nmeasurement of midarm circumference.16,17 All BP readings\nwere obtained at a single examination visit following a stand-\nWe classified individual participant's BP using the new\nguidelines detailed in the Fourth Report on the Diagnosis,\nEvaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children\nand Adolescents.18 The new guidelines recommend multiple\nBP measurements at different times to define persistent hyper-\ntension and prehypertension. In this study, all BP readings\nwere obtained at a single examination visit there was a need\nto differentiate between the guidelines nomenclature for pre-\nhypertension and hypertension and our nomenclature for the\nsame outcome of interest. Because our study design only had\naccess to one BP measurement per survey participant, if the\nsingle BP measurement was in the prehypertensive BP range\nit was labeled in this paper as a pre-EBP. Also, if the single BP\nmeasurement was in the hypertensive BP range, it was labeled\nin this paper as an EBP. A somewhat similar approach was\ntaken by Din-Dzietham et al.19\nA child was classified as having pre-EBP if one of the four\nfollowing criteria was satisfied: (i) the percentile for systolic\npercentile for diastolic BP 90% but <95% and the systolic BP\npercentile <90%; (iii) the percentile systolic BP 90% but <95%\nand diastolic BP percentile 90% but <95%; (iv) observed BP\nlevels 120/80mmHg even if systolic and diastolic percen-\ntiles are <90%. EBP was defined as the percentile for systolic\nBP and/or a percentile for diastolic BP that is 95% for gender,\nage, and height. See the Fourth Report (Appendix B in report--\nfor further details).18 In classifying an examinee as EBP or pre-\nEBP, individuals with missing diastolic values but valid systolic\nvalues were included. Thus if an examinee' s mean systolic BP\nwas greater than or equal to the sex and age-specific systolic\nBP threshold, the examinee was classified as pre-EBP or EBP\neven if the mean diastolic BP was missing. The prevalence of\npre-EBP and EBP in youth during NHANES III, NHANES\nHeight in centimeters and weight in kilograms were meas-\nured in the mobile examination center following a standard\nprotocol. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided\nby the square of height in meters (kg/m2) and was catego-\nrized using the age- and sex-specific BMI percentiles based\non the year 2000 growth charts of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.20,21 BMI was categorized as (i)\nunderweight defined as BMI less than the 5th sex-specific\npercentile of BMI for age, (ii) \"normal weight\" defined as at\nor above the sex-specific 5th percentile but less than the 85th\npercentile of BMI for age, (iii) overweight defined as BMI at\n85th percentile but less than 95th percentile for age, and (iv)\nobese defined as BMI >95th percentile for age.

It is more conservative than 2 Statistics.23\nTo test for changes in pre-EBP and EBP we used logistic\nregression to model these prevalences as a function of time\nperiod by treating time as a categorical variable and control-\nling for the possible confounding effects of gender, race ethnic-\nity, age group, and BMI category. Underweight was excluded\nbecause of the small sample size (n = 60). Initially the models\nalso included all possible two-way interactions of these main\neffects. Higher order interactions were not included because\nthe number of variables included in the model would exceed\nthe number of degrees of freedom. To test for significance, the\nSatterthwaite adjusted F test24,25 was used. An interaction (P <\n0.1) was found between sex and the NHANES survey years for\nboth pre-EBP and EBP. Therefore, separate models were devel-\noped for boys and girls; these models included time period,\nrace ethnicity, age group, and BMI category together with all\npossible two-way and three-way interactions. For pre-EBP and\nEBP in girls, none of the three-way or two-way interactions was\nsignificant. For EBP in boys all of the three-way interactions\nwere significant. Therefore, to help interpret the information\nbecause of the significant third-order interaction we stratified\nthe model into the two age categories. Age category was the\nlogical category to stratify by because it is the most inclusive\nand interpretive category.

We suggest that the discrepancy in the prevalence\nbetween our results and Din-Dzietham's results may stem from\ntruncating the age in their calculations (e.g., 156 months/12\nwould be truncated to 13 years) and excluding from their anal-\nyses youth classified as \"other\" for race/ethnicity category. Still\nanother possibility for the discrepancy, although not as salient,\nmay be the starting point of age calculation; we used date of\nexam as an index for age and they used date of interview. Up to\nsix weeks may elapse from interview date to exam date. Finally,\nGender, age group, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic blacks),\nheight, and increased weight had been previously associated\nAfter controlling for all other covariates including BMI\nincreased prevalence of EBP in girls. However, for adolescent\nboys aged 13\u00ad17 years there was a significantly lower preva-\nlence of EBP during this time period. Although the decrease\nwas mainly reflected among white adolescents and among\nthe obese (Table 2); the reason for this discrepant result in\none of the 24 (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2) time period, gender, age group,\nEBP, subgroups could be a chance finding or could reflect a\nBP\u00adobesity interaction among adolescent boys compared\nto the other subgroups. Furthermore, this suggests that the\nincrease in BMI may not explain all of the factors contrib-\nuting to the increase in hypertension prevalence, or possi-\nbly that BMI does not capture the entire impact of increased\nbody fatness. Environmental factors and lifestyle behaviors\nsuch as physical activity are associated with BP levels among\nadults and may also play a role in the causal pathway for\nRace/ethnicity in girls, classification of overweight in boys,\nand obesity in boys and girls were all independently associated\nwith pre-EBP. It has been suggested that pre-EBP classification\nin children, as with adults, should alert the clinician of possi-\nble subsequent hypertension and a need for a closer medical\n\nfollow-up--individuals in this category may proceed to develop\nhypertension and cardiovascular disease in the future.18\nThe major strengths of this analysis are that national data\nwere obtained on large samples of US children and adolescents,\nincluding two major US population subgroups. The survey\nuses rigorous quality control monitoring, a standardized BP\nprotocol, calibrated equipment, and well-trained examiners.\nMoreover, the same data collection protocol and equipment\nthis study provides additional 4 years of data and the \"other\"\nrace/ethnicity category were not excluded from the analyses.\nThe limitations of this analysis include the fact that BP lev-\nels were based on an average of three readings completed at\none point in time. According to the new guidelines, elevated\nBP must be confirmed on repeated visits before characterizing\nthe child or adolescent as having prehypertension or hyper-\ntension. Therefore our results may likely to overestimate EBP\nstatus for specific individuals. Second, we did not consider\nother potentially relevant information such as physical activ-\nity, dietary intake data, or secondary hypertension caused by\nother disease etiology.\nIn conclusion, independent of weight status, age, and race\nethnicity the prevalence of EBP has increased among girls\naged 8\u00ad17 years but decreased among adolescent boys aged\n13\u00ad17 years. Overweight and obesity were significantly associ-\nated with EBP. These observations have clear implications for\npublic health because increased BP in childhood may result in\ncardiovascular diseases in adulthood.\n"
