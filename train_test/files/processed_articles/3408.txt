    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study examines how job quality and performance management influence career initiative in the workplace. Based on\nsignaling theory and the notion of internal fit in performance management and HRM, we argue that performance management\nwith a learning orientation further enhances career initiative, whereas performance management with a results orientation\nconstrains it. Combining the two performance management types is expected to diminish career initiative. In addition, we\nexpect the positive effect of job quality to be contingent upon the performance management types. A total of 772 employees\nworking in the (public) service industry or manufacturing industry and nested within 53 work units rated their job quality\n(job variety and job autonomy) as well as career initiative. Line managers from these work units rated the performance\nmanagement types practiced. Results indicate that job variety and learning-oriented performance management positively\nrelate to career initiative. The positive relationships between learning-orientated performance management, job variety, and\ncareer initiative are weakened when line managers simultaneously practice results-oriented performance management. These\nfindings underline the need to focus on how performance management orientations and job quality combine to influence\ncareer initiative.\n",

A category of employee behavior that seems\nparticularly important in achieving these goals is proactive\nemployee behavior related to their own development and\nCollins, 2010). We refer to this type of proactive behavior as\ncareer initiative. Career initiative entails the self-starting of\nactivities related to learning and gaining experience in the\nworkplace, which include career planning and skill develop-\nment (Claes & Ruiz-Quintanilla, 1998; Seibert, Kraimer, &\nhuman capital, facilitate employees' careers and/or opportu-\nnities for future employment, and are essential if organiza-\ntions are to achieve organizational adaptability (G.

This is the main instrument through which manag-\ners communicate their expectations of employees' contribu-\ntions to the work unit, and/or their expectations of employees'\npersonal development (Aguinis, 2009; Boxall & Purcell,\na human resource allocator (Toh, Morgeson, & Campion,\n2008), performance management signals, guides, and\nrewards the desired allocation of employee resources to the\nattainment of organizational goals (Bergeron, 2007).\nAccordingly, we examine the role of performance manage-\nment in influencing career initiative. Performance manage-\nment can be practiced through various approaches, depending\non the goals management is striving for (Boxall & Purcell,\non performance management (Aguinis, 2009; Anderson &\nlearning-oriented and results-oriented performance manage-\nment. Building on signaling theory and its application in\nHRM and performance management literature (e.g., Bowen\ning-oriented performance management facilitates career ini-\ntiative behaviors, whereas results-oriented performance\nmanagement constrains career initiative behaviors. In addi-\ntion, drawing on notions of internal fit (e.g., Delery & Doty,\n1996) in HRM literature, we propose that the positive effect\nof job quality on career initiative is contingent upon the per-\nformance management type practiced.\nThis study extends previous research in three ways. First, in\nline with directions for future research proposed by Grant and\nAshford (2008) among others, we contribute to knowledge on\nthe contextual antecedents of career initiative. We examine the\ninfluence of performance management, as a relevant organiza-\ntional HRM practice, and explore its interaction with the\ninherent potential of a job to generate career initiative, as\nderives from its job quality. Second, by including performance\nmanagement as enacted by line managers, we respond to the\nStrauss et al. (2009) call for studies that focus on leader behav-\nior in relation to employee proactivity, like career initiative.\nFinally, although the majority of extant research has so far\nbeen restricted to the employee level of analysis, the need to\nextend this research to multiple levels of analysis has been\nParker, Van den Broeck, & Holman, 2017; Strauss et al.,\n2009). By making use of a two-level, two-actor design, we\nrespond to this need. In our study, performance management\nas practiced in work units is rated by line managers, while rat-\nings of job quality and career initiative are obtained from\nemployees.\nBelow, we provide a short review of the literature on\ncareer initiative and performance management. Following\nthis, we introduce our hypotheses and explain the methodol-\nogy and findings of our empirical study. We conclude the\narticle by interpreting our results and discussing the limita-\ntions and practical implications of the findings.\nTheory\nJob Quality and Career Initiative\nSeveral concepts have been proposed in the literature over\nthe past 15 years that relate to employee proactivity directed\nat development and career such as personal initiative to\ndevelop (Frese, Fay, Hilburger, Leng, & Tag, 1997), flexible\nrole orientations (Parker, Wall, & Jackson, 1997), and\nemployability orientation (Van Dam, 2004). Parker and\nCollins (2010), in taking stock of existing constructs and\nmeasures in the area, suggest the term proactive person\u00ad\nenvironment fit behavior for this category of employee pro-\nactivity. According to them, such proactivity aims to a\nsustainable fit between the person and the environment. In\nthis study, we focus on a set of self-initiated activities that\nconcern learning and gaining experience to promote one's\ncareer maintenance and/or opportunities for future employ-\nment (Warr & Fay, 2001). In particular, we study two main\ncareer initiative behaviors: proactively engaging in skill\ndevelopment and career planning (Claes & Ruiz-Quintanilla,\nExisting empirical evidence shows that employees work-\ning in high-quality jobs show higher levels of employee cre-\nativity (Oldham & Cummings, 1996), innovative work\nbehavior (Dorenbosch, van Engen, & Verhagen, 2005), and\nproactive work behavior (Salanova & Schaufeli, 2008). Two\nimportant aspects of job quality in this respect are job auton-\nomy and job variety (Barling, Kelloway, & Iverson, 2003;\nGrote & Guest, 2016). Job variety reflects the extent to which\na job offers a set of tasks that uses the multitude of skills a\nperson has, and as such also requires a certain complexity\nand unpredictability in job tasks (Grant & Ashford, 2008).\nVan Veldhoven et al. 3\nJob autonomy concerns the amount of control or discretion\nan employee has over major aspects, such as work method\nand timing, of job performance. It is argued in the literature\nthat a broader job scope, in terms of skills and/or control,\nencourages employees to know more, learn more, make\nmore connections between the things they know, and be\nmore creative in advancing alternative possibilities to\nimprove their own skills base--in short, to increase their\ncareer initiative behaviors (Axtell, Holman, Unsworth, Wall,\nParker et al., 2006). Therefore, we expect that:\nHypothesis 1a (H1a): Job variety is positively associated\nwith employee career initiative.\nHypothesis 1b (H1b): Job autonomy is positively associ-\nated with employee career initiative.\nPerformance Management and Career Initiative\nPerformance management is a process that involves three\nimportant stages: setting expectations and measuring perfor-\nmance outcomes, tracing these outcomes back to the efforts\nof employees and feeding this information back to employ-\nees, and finally formulating consequences in terms of\nrewards as well as future employee work behaviors (Aguinis,\nSulsky, & MacDonald, 2007). In line with recent recommen-\ndations by Pulakos and O'Leary (2011), we focus on how\nthese performance management activities are implemented\nby line managers on a continuous basis.\nAccording to Den Hartog et al. (2004), performance man-\nagement is the dominant channel through which line manag-\ners communicate organizational goals to employees.\nDepending on the kinds of goals that management is striving\nent types of performance management can be appropriate. In\nthe literature, distinctions are made between administrative\nversus developmental, behavioral versus outcome, input ver-\nsus output, developmental versus evaluation, and soft versus\nhard performance management types (Aguinis, 2009;\nthese available distinctions, we choose to contrast two per-\nformance management types: results-oriented and learning-\noriented in this article. The reasons for this choice are\ntwofold: first, the contrast between results- and learning ori-\nentation captures the common denominator based on the\nsources mentioned above, and second, the contrast between\nresults and learning would seem to be highly relevant for the\nkind of dependent variable that we are researching in the cur-\nrent study.\nLearning-oriented performance management is targeted\nat achieving work-unit goals by guiding future employee\ndevelopment toward those behaviors necessary to maintain\nand/or improve work-unit goals related to innovation, flexi-\nbility, and agility (Boxall & Purcell, 2008; Dyer & Shafer,\n1999). Performance management with a learning orientation\nfocuses on stimulating professional growth, both horizon-\ntally (within the same job) and vertically (to other jobs).\nGiven the emphasis in current organizations on constant\ninnovation and quality improvement, (continuous) profes-\nsional learning and development has become a mainstay in\nHRM for many workers, hence it gets a lot of attention in\nperformance management for many workers as well (Den\nWhen a learning-oriented type of performance manage-\nment is enacted by the line manager of a work unit, we would\nexpect employees to be encouraged to seek opportunities for\ndevelopment as well as to improve their own abilities (Boxall\nperformance management type is congruent with initiatives\nby employees to behave proactively in job-related innova-\ntion and creativity (Janssen & Van Yperen, 2004; Madjar &\nShalley, 2008). Career initiative, like other proactive\nemployee behaviors, typically involve a great deal of\nresource expenditure as these require anticipation, planning,\nand sustained action directed toward a future outcome (Frese\nand taking on additional responsibilities (Bolino, Valcea, &\nHarvey, 2010). Under learning-oriented performance man-\nagement, time and resources allocated by employees toward\ncareer initiative are not at the expense of negative perfor-\nmance appraisals and their related consequences (Kanfer &\nAckerman, 1989). Summarizing, this type of performance\nmanagement signals (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Ehrnrooth &\nBj\u00f6rkman, 2012) employees that career initiative is congru-\nent with organizational goals, and that actions directed at\ndevelopment and career are valued by line managers in the\nlong run. This signaling theory builds on earlier work in\nsocial psychology on situation strength (Mischel, 1977):\nonly situations that send coherent, consistent, and repeated\nsignals to people result in certain behaviors in a more or less\npredictable way. In weak situations, no systematic patterns of\nbehavior emerge. In a related vein, the more a line manager\nconsistently emphasizes employee development by practic-\ning a learning-oriented type of performance management in\nall three stages of the performance management process, the\nstronger is the signaling effect of this enacted performance\nmanagement type (DeNisi & Smith, 2014). Frese et al.\n(1996) empirically confirmed the importance of long-term\ndevelopmental organizational goals for engagement in per-\nsonal initiatives at work. This therefore leads to our second\nhypothesis:\nHypothesis 2a (H2a): Learning-oriented performance\nmanagement is positively associated with employee\ncareer initiative.\nIn contrast, results-oriented performance management\nemphasizes the attainment of results-based goals and links\nthese with rewards to reinforce desirable employee behaviors\n4 SAGE Open\nand/or labor output (Den Hartog et al., 2004; Stiles, Gratton,\nTruss, Hope-Hailey, & McGovern, 1997). As work-unit per-\nformance becomes increasingly dependent on the efficient\ndeployment of human capital, results-oriented performance\nmanagement aims to direct employee effort toward the attain-\nment of individual performance results that conform with\nwork-unit goals in terms of labor productivity and proficiency\nkind of performance management is traditionally used with\nlow-skilled workers (Arthur, 1994), but in recent years it has\nalso become increasingly common with high-skilled workers\nin both the private and public sectors (Aguinis, 2009), hence\nalso giving rise to many high-skilled workers being con-\nfronted with the combination, for example, being confronted\nwith targets in terms of results and learning simultaneously.\nWhen results-oriented performance management is\nenacted by the line manager of a work unit, management\nactions are aimed at shaping a work situation in which it is\nclear to employees what it takes to be successful and pro-\nficient in the job, as well as providing structured and direct\nfeedback as to the extent to which employees behave and/\nor perform in line with work-unit productivity targets (Den\nEhrnrooth & Bj\u00f6rkman, 2012), one can predict that--in\nthis context--employees are more likely to allocate\nresources to adequately accomplishing their immediate\ntasks and to task proficiency, at the cost of a long-term\nproactive orientation toward changing work processes and\nupdating skills to meet future career demands (Unsworth\n& Parker, 2003). This argument is in line with Bergeron\n(2007), who also proposes a trade-off between the time\nallocated by employees to task performance behaviors ver-\nsus organizational citizenship behaviors. The short-term\nfocus of the immediate task takes precedence over the\nlong-term perspective of the career. Thus, our second\nhypothesis becomes:\nHypothesis 2b (H2b): Results-oriented performance\nmanagement is negatively associated with employee\ncareer initiative.\nThe Interplay Between the Two Performance\nManagement Types\nBased on signaling theory, we have argued that learning-\noriented performance management will enhance career ini-\ntiative, whereas results-oriented performance management\nwill constrain it. In organizational practice, the two perfor-\nmance management types are not necessarily mutually\nexclusive and can coexist in a work unit's overall HR\napproach. Line managers can emphasize both achieving\nhigher levels of productivity and attaining higher levels of\nemployee flexibility and innovativeness (Boxall & Purcell,\nSuch a combination can be expected to send mixed sig-\nnals to employees on how to allocate their efforts. This\nrelates to the notion of internal fit as is often used in the\nexplanation of HR system effects on employee behaviors\npractices will only have impact when they are coherent, for\nexample, correctly bundled together in a HR system, and\nconsistently enacted toward employees. Some bundles pro-\nvide positive combinations while others provide deadly com-\nbinations (B. E. Becker, Huselid, Pickus, & Spratt, 1997;\nIn our study, a deadly combination refers to a situation\nwhere a line manager attempts to combine HR practices that\nare detrimental to employee behaviors when used together. If\na work unit is already triggering career initiative through\nusing learning-oriented performance management, making\nadditional use of results-oriented performance management\nis likely to generate confusion: Should I focus less attention\non the long-term and emphasize more my short-term profi-\nciency? The mixed signals may result in a deadly combina-\ntion in relation to career initiative. Therefore, in our third\nhypothesis, we expect that:\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Result-oriented performance manage-\nment weakens the positive association between learning-\noriented performance management and career initiative.\nHow Performance Management Types Interact\nWith Job Quality\nThe argument of internal fit can be extended to not only\napply to HR practices or systems. Several authors have\nemphasized that how employees behave toward strategic\norganizational goals is simultaneously influenced by\nwhether HR initiatives have an internal fit with the typical\nwork systems chosen by the organization. Indeed this is\none of the ideas underlying the notion of high-perfor-\nmance work systems (Appelbaum, 2000; Boxall & Purcell,\n2011). Following this line of argument, if job quality is\nhigh, a learning-oriented type of performance manage-\nment will demonstrate internal fit: The combination of the\ntwo serves to further strengthen situational cues of the\nappropriateness of career initiative. However, when in the\nsame high-quality jobs a results-oriented type is imple-\nmented, a deadly combination may be expected, for exam-\nple, where the job itself would be conducive to career\ninitiative, the performance management system focuses\nefforts on the short-term rather than the long term, coun-\nteracting the inherent potential to mobilize career initia-\ntive of the job. Therefore, in our fourth hypothesis, we\npredict:\nHypothesis 4a (H4a): Learning-oriented performance\nmanagement strengthens the positive association between\njob quality and career initiative employee career initiative.\nVan Veldhoven et al. 5\nHypothesis 4b (H4b): Result-oriented performance man-\nagement weakens the positive association between job\nquality and career initiative.\nAn overview of all the hypothesized relationships is pre-\nsented in Figure 1.\nMethod\nProcedure\nData were collected from 12 Dutch organizations (four orga-\nnizations operating in the service industry, four organizations\noperating in the manufacturing industry, two governmental\norganizations, one hospital, and one elementary school) to\nboost the variance in our independent variables. For this\nstudy, we needed access to and cooperation from line manag-\ners and employees in a range of work units. From the 12\norganizations selected, 53 work units were willing to partici-\npate in the study. The average number of participating work\nunits per organization was thus 4.4 (standard deviation 3.7).\nIn the participating units, surveys were sent out to employees\nto collect data on job quality and career initiative. At the\nsame time, for each work unit, data on performance manage-\nment orientations and on the number of employees per work\nunit were obtained from the first-line managers responsible\nfor executing performance management. Face-to-face inter-\nviews were conducted on site by a PhD candidate and several\ntrained research assistants.\nSample\nA total of 1,795 surveys were distributed, either on paper or\nby intranet, to all nonmanagerial employees working in all\nthe 53 work units with the help of each work-unit line man-\nager or an external research institute. In total, 772 employees\ncompleted and returned the questionnaires; a response rate of\n43%. The average number of responses per work unit was\n14.6, the number of responses per work unit ranged between\n4 and 41. The sample includes both high- and low-skilled\njobs.

The\nitems of the career initiative scale reflect the degree to which\n(a) employees set challenging goals and actively look for\nsituations in which they can expand their skills and knowl-\nedge (skill development) and (b) employees are concerned\nwith and self-assess future skills and knowledge needs, as\nwell as take action to adapt to these estimated future needs\n(career planning). The first item was derived from the Job\nAspiration Scale (Warr, 1990), the second and third items\nwere adapted from the Learning Motivation Scale (Taris,\nKompier, De Lange, Schaufeli, & Schreurs, 2003), the fourth\nitem was adapted from the Employability Orientation Scale\n(Van Dam, 2004), and the last item was self-developed (all\nitems can be found in the Appendix). Items were answered\non a 5-point response scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 =\nstrongly agree).\nAlthough for all items the full range of possible responses\nis found, all items (and the mean score of the items) are skewed\nto the right. To reduce the skewness of this measure, we\nrecoded the five items described above (score 1-3 = 0, 4 = 1, 5\n= 2), and summed up the recoded scores. The resulting sum\nscore can range between 0 and 10 and shows an approximately\nnormal distribution across employees. The reliability of the\nresulting scale is good ( = .82). A series of confirmatory\nFigure 1. Conceptual model.\nNote.

Employees were asked to rate their experience of job\nvariety, opportunities for creativity, and skill use in their job\non a 4-point frequency scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 =\noften, and 4 = always). A sample item is as follows: \"Do you\nhave enough variety in your work.\" The reliability of this\nscale was good ( = .84). Job autonomy was similarly mea-\nsured with a four-item scale from the same questionnaire\nusing the same 4-point frequency answering scale, again\nwith good reliability ( = .86). These items pertain to the\nextent of autonomy regarding work methods and timing, and\nare similar to those proposed by Jackson, Wall, Martin, and\nDavids (1993). A sample item is as follows: \"Do you have an\ninfluence on the pace of work?\" The two survey scales have\nshown good correlations with observations by trained\nobservers (Meijman & Van Ouwerkerk, 1999). In addition,\nevidence for the validity of these scales in relation to\nemployee wellbeing and health has been reported in several\nstudies (Bakker et al., 2010; Van Veldhoven & Broersen,\nMeasurement of Independent Variable\nPerformance Management Orientation at the\nWork-Unit Level of Analysis\nWe used structured, face-to-face interviews with line manag-\ners1 that followed a predefined response format (see Neal,\nWest, & Patterson, 2005, for a similar approach). In the inter-\nview, the performance management questions were preceded\nby the following introduction:\nThe following questions refer to the way employees in your unit\nare managed and motivated to do a good job. Basically, there are\ntwo orientations: (a) managing worker input in terms of making\nclear what employee attitudes and behaviors are expected and\nneed to be developed, and (b) managing worker output by\ncommunicating clear performance expectations in terms of\nresults. Which of these orientations (learning, results, or both)\ndo you apply in your work unit?\nWhen line managers indicated they practiced both kinds of\nperformance management orientations, six follow-up ques-\ntions were asked related to the strength and quality of learning\nand results performance management orientations practiced.\nWhen line managers indicated that they only managed and\nmotivated using a single orientation, three follow-up ques-\ntions were asked for that type of performance management\norientation (in this case, the three questions not asked--\nbecause they related to a performance management orienta-\ntion not practiced--were coded with the lowest possible\nvalue). All of the line managers claimed to apply at least one\nof the two performance management orientations.\nBased on the notion that performance management is a\nstepwise process, the questions covered the goal-setting\nstrength, performance review intensity, and extensiveness of\nFirst, the \"goal-setting strength\" was measured by asking the\nextent to which line managers involve organizational (\"yes/\nno\"), team (\"yes/no\"), and individual (\"yes/no\") level goals\nin communicating learning/results expectations regarding to\ntheir subordinates. Second, \"performance review intensity\"\nwas measured by asking the extent to which performance\nreviews with employees clearly provided feedback to what\nextent the learning/results expectations of line managers\nwere met by employees. Finally, the \"extensiveness of fol-\nlow-up goal setting\" taps the extent to which line managers\nraised their learning/results expectations in setting follow-up\ngoals when employees were evaluated as having success-\nfully attained their current goals. The performance review\nintensity and the extensiveness of follow-up goal setting\nwere assessed using a 5-point answering scale (1 = to a very\nlittle extent to 5 = to a very large extent).\nTo create an overall index reflecting the two performance\nmanagement orientations, the six items with different answer\ncategories were recoded into categories of low (0), moderate\n(1), and high (2). Goal-setting strength was determined from\nthe three yes/no answers and recoded as follows: three no's =\na low goal-setting strength (0); a mix of yes's and no's =\nmoderate goal-setting strength (1); all yes's = high goal-set-\nting strength (2). Based on the distribution of the scores, per-\nformance review intensity was recoded based on the Likert\nness of follow-up goal setting was recoded based on the\nindex was then created by summing the three recoded items\non learning and on results. The range of scores for the two\nindices covering the learning and results performance man-\nagement orientation was thus between 0 and 6.\nThe reliability (based on the recoded items) of both result-\ning scales was good ( = .84 and  = .79 for learning- and\nresults-orientation, respectively). To investigate whether the\ntwo performance management orientations captured differ-\nent constructs, we conducted a series of confirmatory factor\nanalyses. We compared a model in which all the items for\nboth performance management orientations were loaded\nonto a single factor with the hypothesized two-factor model.\nThe hypothesized two-factor model fitted the data signifi-\n.05; one-factor model: Tucker\u00adLewis index (TLI) = .11;\nVan Veldhoven et al. 7\ncomparative fit index (CFI) = .47; two-factor model: TLI =\n.84; CFI = .91.

Therefore, before proceeding further, we assessed the\nextent to which the performance management orientations\ndiffered between the 12 organizations. Results of two F-tests\nshowed that the variances attributable to organization were\nnot significant (p > .05). On this basis, we concluded that the\nwork-unit level was the appropriate level of analysis for the\nperformance management types, and did not include a third\nlevel (the organization) in our analyses.\nMeasurement of Control Variables\nIn the analysis, based on prior research (Frese & Fay, 2001;\nindividual-level demographic variables: gender (1 = female,\n2 = male), age, and education (1 = lower education to 6 =\nhigher education). At the work-unit level, we controlled for\nwork-unit size as this could influence the instruments used to\nalign individual and work-unit interests (Snell, 1992). Given\nthat the survey research was targeted at surveying all employ-\nees working in the selected work units, we used the number\nof distributed surveys per unit (which corresponds with the\nnumber of employees per work unit) as our measure of unit\nsize.\nAnalysis\nFirst, to examine whether job quality and career initiative\n(both were measured in the employee survey) captured dif-\nferent constructs at the individual employee level, we con-\nducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses. We\ncompared a model in which all items for career initiative,\njob variety, and job autonomy were loaded onto a single\nfactor with the hypothesized three-factor model. The\nhypothesized three-factor model fitted the data signifi-\nsquare error approximation (RMSEA) = .21; three-factor\nsupport our career initiative and job quality measures hav-\ning discriminant validity. Second, bivariate correlations\nwere calculated between all the variables measured at both\nthe individual level and the work-unit level. The data are\nhierarchical (macro-micro) in nature as employees are\nnested within work units. This nesting is likely to result in\ndependency in our data, making multilevel analysis the sta-\ntistical method of choice (Snijders & Bosker, 1999). To fur-\nther justify the application of multilevel analyses, we tested\nwhether there was sufficient between work-unit variance in\nour dependent variable, career initiative, and indeed found\nsignificant between work-unit variance (intraclass correla-\nWe tested our hypotheses with a set of multilevel analyses\nusing MLwiN (Rasbash, Browne, & Goldstein, 2003). In the\nfirst step, we included our control variables and the two job\nquality variables after grand mean centering (H1a and H1b;\nModel 1). In the second step, we added the two performance\norientations after grand mean centering (H2a and H2b;\nModel 2).

The two performance\nmanagement orientations do not correlate at the work-unit\nlevel (r = .03). The learning orientation is practiced in the\nwork units at a slightly higher intensity than the results orien-\ntation. Our dependent variable, career initiative, appears to\ncorrelate with autonomy (r = .10**), with job variety (r =\n.37***), and with education level (r = .15**), and these latter\ntwo variables in turn are also strongly correlated (r = 30***).\nJob Quality and Career Initiative\nFirst, we assessed the main effects of both job quality vari-\nables on career initiative (see Model 1 in Table 2). Job vari-\nety is positively related to career initiative (t = 9.86),\nsupporting H1a. However, for autonomy (H1b), no signifi-\ncant effect on career initiative (t = 0.05) was found.2\nRegarding the control variables, only age is negatively asso-\nciated with career initiative (t = -2.25).\nPerformance Management Orientations and\nCareer Initiative\nWe now turn to the hypothesized effects of the two perfor-\nmance management orientations on career initiative (Model\n2 in Table 2). Learning-oriented performance management is\npositively associated with career initiative (t = 2.02), sup-\nporting H2a. No significant negative relationship between\nresults-oriented performance management and career initia-\ntive is found (t = 1.00), thereby rejecting H2b.\nIncluding the interaction effect of the two orientations results\nproduct of the two performance management orientations has a\n8 SAGE Open\nsignificant and negative effect on career initiative (t = -2.32).To\nbe better able to interpret this significant interaction, we plotted\nthe relationship between learning-oriented performance man-\nagement and career initiative at low and high levels (one stan-\ndard deviation below and above the mean) of results-oriented\nperformance management following the suggestion of Aiken\nAs presented in Figure 2, when results-oriented perfor-\nmance management orientation is high, career initiative is\nhigh and not influenced by learning-orientated performance\nmanagement. Simple slope analysis confirmed that in this\ncase the relationship between learning-oriented performance\nmanagement and career initiative does not differ signifi-\ncantly from zero (t = -0.07). However, when results-oriented\nperformance management orientation is low, the relationship\nlearning-oriented performance management and career ini-\ntiative is significantly positive (t = 3.07). This indicates that\nresults-oriented performance management weakens the posi-\ntive association between learning-oriented performance\nmanagement and career initiative. These results support H3\nand are further interpreted in the discussion section.\nTo give an indication of the extent to which the perfor-\nmance management orientations predict career initiative, we\ncalculated the reduction in unexplained variance in career\nTable 1.

From this\ncalculation, we conclude that the two performance manage-\nment orientations and their interaction together accounted\nfor an additional (above the effects of the control and the job\nquality variables) 22% of the between-unit explained vari-\nance in career initiative.\nJob Quality, Performance Management, and\nCareer Initiative\nIncluding the four interaction terms (Model 4) did not result\nfact, only one of the four interaction effects was significant:\nthe product of results-oriented performance management and\njob variety had a significant negative effect on career initia-\ntive (t = -1.97), indicating that the positive relationship\nbetween job variety and career initiative is stronger when\nthere is low results-oriented performance management. No\nsuch interaction effect was found for job autonomy (t = 0.81).\nIn terms of learning-oriented performance management, nei-\nther job variety nor job autonomy moderated its relationship\nthereby rejecting H4a.\nTo further examine the moderating effect of results-ori-\nented performance management, we graphically illustrate\nthe interaction in Figure 3 (Aiken & West, 1991). As Figure\n3 illustrates, under conditions of low results-orientated PMO,\nthere is a stronger positive association between job variety\nperformance management and career initiative than under\nconditions of high results-oriented PMO. A simple slope\nanalysis (Aiken & West, 1991) confirmed the positive rela-\ntionship between job variety and career initiative under con-\nditions of low (t = 7.49) and high (t = 4.76) results-oriented\nPMO. These results provide limited support for H4b, only\nfor job variety the hypothesis is confirmed.\nDiscussion\nWe have investigated relationships between job quality, per-\nformance management type, and career initiative. First, job\nvariety is positively associated with career initiative support-\ning H1a. This finding fits the idea that a job offering a set of\ntasks that uses the multitude of skills a person has encour-\nages an employee to know more, learn more, make more\nconnections between the things they know, and be more cre-\native in advancing alternative possibilities to improve their\nwork or their own skills base (Axtell et al., 2000; Grant &\nBased on previous research on employee proactivity\njob autonomy to also play a role in the linkage examined.\nHowever, we did not find any support for this in the current\nsample. This may be a consequence of the Dutch context,\nwhere levels of job autonomy are usually high and to a cer-\ntain extent institutionalized in workplaces (Boselie, Paauwe,\n& Jansen, 2001) and where the national culture points to the\nimportance of control and discretion in the Dutch working\nsituation (Schwartz, 1999). Other studies using Dutch data\nhave also found that job variety matters more in the Dutch\ncontext than job autonomy (Van Veldhoven, Taris, De Jonge,\n& Broersen, 2005). In addition, the relationship between\nautonomy and career initiative might be contingent on indi-\nvidual dispositional characteristics, for example, the level of\nself-efficacy of employees (Den Hartog & Belschak, 2012).\nSecond, the findings support the idea that under learning-\noriented performance management, employees are encour-\naged to seek opportunities for development. Based on\nsignaling theory (e.g., Bowen & Ostroff, 2004), we expected\nthat the more a line manager practices a learning-oriented\ntype of performance management in all three stages of the\nperformance management process, the stronger is the signal-\ning effect of this enacted performance management type\n(DeNisi & Smith, 2014). In such a situation, career initiative\nFigure 2. Combination of performance management orientations with career initiative as the dependent variable.\nNote. PMO = performance management orientation.\nis congruent with performance management signals from the\nline manager: It is clear to employees how they should allo-\ncate resources (Janssen & Van Yperen, 2004; Kanfer &\nHowever, the expected negative effect of results-oriented\nperformance management was not found. An explanation for\nthis finding might be that such a performance management\ntype triggers two counteracting processes. In a context where\nemployees are strongly managed toward results, employees\nare likely to allocate resources to adequately accomplishing\ntheir immediate tasks (Bergeron, 2007; Unsworth & Parker,\n2003). Employees, however, are also likely to develop new\nskills and competencies that help in coping with the com-\nplexities and/or hindrances involved in meeting with imme-\ndiate productivity targets (Frese & Fay, 2001). In addition,\nfollowing the self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan,\n1985), employees' need for autonomy and/or competence is\nmore likely to be thwarted in a situation where employee are\nmanaged toward results, and this frustration might trigger\nproactive employee behavior.\nThird, the interplay between the two performance man-\nagement orientations was explored based on the notion that\nline managers can emphasize both achieving higher levels\nof productivity and attaining higher levels of employee\nflexibility and innovativeness (Boxall & Purcell, 2008;\nQuinn & Rohrbaugh, 1983). Our findings indicate that in a\nlow results-oriented performance management setting,\npracticing a learning-oriented performance management\nstimulates employees to allocate resources to career initia-\ntive. However, in a high results-oriented performance man-\nagement context, career initiative is already stimulated, as\nthe results-oriented performance management may trigger\na coping mechanism to be able to achieve productivity tar-\ngets. Simultaneously, deploying learning-oriented and\nresults-oriented performance management is not signifi-\ncantly detrimental for career initiative. Although, in this\ncase the performance management orientations send\ndifferent signals, having both did not ensure even lower\ncareer initiative.\nAs a final step in our analysis, we also explored how per-\nformance management interacts with job quality. Results-\noriented performance management interacted in a negative\nway with job variety but not with job autonomy. The positive\nrelationship between job variety and career initiative is\nweakened when line managers practice results-oriented per-\nformance management but still remained significant. This\nsuggests that high job variety is less helpful for enhancing\ncareer initiative when a results-oriented performance man-\nagement is practiced compared to when such a performance\nmanagement type is not practiced. No interaction effects\nwere found for learning-oriented performance management.\nThe combination of a stimulating job with high variety of\nskills used and learning-oriented performance management\ndoes not further strengthen career initiative. This finding fits\nwith earlier work reported by Neal et al. (2005) in a study on\nHRM and organizational climate in U.K. manufacturing\nfirms, testing the so-called limited capacity hypothesis.\nBased on their arguments we could argue that in our sample\nthe attentional and energetic resources that employees can\nallocate to career initiative are limited. In so far as learning-\noriented performance management is able to trigger career\ninitiative, it is unlikely that such management activities will\nachieve greater career initiative in employees who are\nalready allocating substantial attention and energy to this\nkind of behavior because of the opportunities presented by\nthe quality and design of their job. Another interpretation is\nthat job quality mediates a link between HR practices (such\nas performance management) and career initiative. Such an\nHR process model (e.g., Boxall & Purcell, 2011) would\nexpect management that is steering toward innovation to cre-\nate better jobs for already highly educated workers, who then\ndisplay more career initiative, which contributes to more\ninnovative products and services for the company. Here, the\naim is successful delivery of innovative products and ser-\nvices which will sustain the positive cycle described. This\nFigure 3. Combination of job variety and results-oriented performance management with career initiative as the dependent variable.\nNote. PMO = performance management orientation.\nVan Veldhoven et al. 11\nscenario resembles what Hobfoll (2011) has recently called a\nresource caravan passageway.\nLimitations and Strengths\nWe have used the line manager as a single rater of the perfor-\nmance management types practiced in a work unit. Gerhart,\nWright, McMahan, and Snell (2000) have shown that the\nreliability of such a single rating for a unit-level variable is\nlikely to be low. However, they also showed that using mul-\ntiple items for measuring variables in such a measurement\ncontext does improve reliability, and we followed this advice\nin our study.\nWe need to be somewhat cautious concerning our specific\nmeasures of the two performance management types, and the\nspecific typology that we used. Due to time limits on the\ninterviews with line managers, only three items were used to\nmeasure the two performance management variables. Other\nresearchers into performance management have focused on\nthe detailed steps, elements, and partial practices included in\nthis major area of HRM (Den Hartog et al., 2004; Fletcher,\n2001), and might have chosen a diffrent typology. Our\napproach has been to measure the main orientation of the\nperformance management activities as we deemed relevant\nfor our dependent variable, and this may overlook other\nimportant facets involved in performance management, such\nas contingent pay or procedural fairness. Our approach was\nnever intended to substitute for more elaborate ways of oper-\nationalizing performance management, but does seem ade-\nquate for our current research aim (Button, Mathieu, &\nA weakness in the research on employee proactivity is\nthat what we currently know about its antecedents is mostly\nbased on employee self-reported (Parker & Collins, 2010;\nParker et al., 2006) and therefore open to common source\nbias. A strength of this study is that the independent and\ndependent measures were collected from different sources\nand on different levels, linking line management interview\ndata at the work-unit level to employee-level survey data.\nHowever, we should recognize that multisource correlations\nare usually lower than single-source correlations in research\n(Doty & Glick, 1998). Nevertheless, considerable associa-\ntions at the between-unit level were shown in this study: at\nthe work-unit level more than 22% of the variance was\nexplained.\nRelated to this point, it should be noted that although the\nsample contained high- and low-skilled jobs, employees in\njobs where cognitive competence and continuous learning\nare important are moderately overrepresented in our sample\n(e.g., teachers, nurses, and engineers). This might explain the\nrelatively high scores on career initiative in our study, as\nemployees working in this type of job might be more willing\nto self-initiate career activities. Previous work design\nresearch also suggests the possibility of such occupational\neffects. In occupations with high levels of cognitive demands,\nemployees have more opportunities for information process-\ning and problem solving (Dierdorff & Morgeson, 2013). To\nunderstand these occupational influences on relationships\nbetween performance management types, job quality, and\ncareer initiative, additional research is needed explicitly\ndesigned to compare these relationships in multiple occupa-\ntional settings (e.g., teachers vs. assembly-line workers).\nFinally, this study used a cross-sectional design in which\nall the variables were measured at approximately the same\ntime. As such, no causality can be confidently attached to the\nrelationships established. Longitudinal research is needed to\nconfirm (or reject) the hypothesized temporal order between\njob quality, the performance management types, and career\ninitiative.\nImplications\nThis is one of the first studies researching the linkages\nbetween job quality, performance management, and career\ninitiative. Implications and possible leads for research are\nmany; implications for practice are at the moment still mod-\nest, pending further research.\nA first implication for research is that more studies are\nnecessary that look into how career initiative operates when\nmanagement emphasizes performance in terms of short-term\nresults. Our results suggest a straightforward diminishing of\ncareer initiative is not found in this context, and we have\noffered a coping interpretation of any career initiative in such\na setting. A study directly addressing such a \"career initiative\nas coping\" thesis would seem important.\nA second research implication concerns how job quality\nand performance management type combine. We found that\nespecially when jobs are high on skill variety, emphasizing\nlearning during performance management is likely not to be\nadding much career initiative from employees (a limited\ncapacity view). The alternative interpretation we offered\nsuggests that high job quality follows positive managerial\ndecisions as to the job design and quality needed in a particu-\nlar job to achieve proper performance. Employees repay\nmanagers for such decisions by showing initiative and more\ninnovative and flexible work performance. In this way, cara-\nvan passage ways of positive resource exchange might be\nstimulated between employer and employee. New studies are\nimportant on these linkages, especially if they could pit alter-\nnative theoretical explanations against each other (Wall &\nFor practice, our findings--if only modest at this stage--\ninform the many organizations that are grappling with the\nproblem of finding and implementing organizational prac-\ntices triggering employee work behaviors such as career ini-\ntiative to achieve organizational agility and workforce\nflexibility. More and more, this is also being recognized as\nan issue for whole countries and economies, in the process of\nglobal competition on the labor market and for a wealthy\nFollowing recent recommendations (Grant & Ashford,\nexplored the cross-level effects of a contextual antecedent of\ncareer initiative, and in particular we addressed an intermedi-\nate level and involved line managers who enact performance\nmanagement. We can offer as a practical finding that when\nline managers emphasize a learning type of performance, this\nis positively related to career initiative, and the same holds for\nthe level of variety in their employees' jobs. What line man-\nagers do in this context apparently makes a difference.\nFurthermore, there is a risk of mismatching the inherent\nmobilizing effect of learning-oriented performance manage-\nment with an emphasis on short-term results. Having both\ntypes does not ensure higher career initiative and appears to\nhamper career initiative somewhat, so organizations may\nwant to tread carefully here. Finally, it appears that making\nline managers spend a lot of effort on results-oriented perfor-\nmance management is not always likely to pay off very much\nin terms of career initiative, especially in employees holding\nhigh-quality jobs. To summarize, performance management\nas enacted by line managers certainly appears to matter, but\nit pays to keep a keen eye on where it matters most.\nAppendix\nItems Measuring Career Imitative\nIn my work, I set challenging goals\nIn my work, I keep trying to learn new things\nWith regard to my skills and knowledge, I see to it that I can\ncope with changes in my work.\nI think about how I can keep doing a good job in the future\nIn my work, I search for people from whom I can learn\nsomething\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
