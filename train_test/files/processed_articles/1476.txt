The NHANES uses a complex, multistage probability\nsampling design, with oversampling of adolescents 12 to 19 years\nof age, adults 60 years and older, low-income persons, Mexi-\ncan American individuals, and non-Hispanic black individu-\nals. All the participants completed household surveys con-\nducted by trained study staff that included questions about\ndemographics and health history. The study protocol also in-\ncluded standardized medical examinations at mobile centers\nthatincludedaprivateinterviewandcollectionofabloodsample.\nThe study protocol is described in detail elsewhere.1\nThe World Health Organization Composite International Di-\nagnostic Interview (CIDI)17 was administered to a random sub-\nsample of the participants composed of 50% of those aged 20\nto 39 years. The CIDI was administered in English or Spanish.\nAll the interviews were conducted directly with the respon-\ndents during a private session; persons who required proxies\nwere ineligible (ie, non-English and non-Spanish speakers). This\nstudy includes the 1987 individuals who had available data on\nCIDI diagnoses of MDD, PD, or GAD; blood lead levels; and\nall of the covariates.\nMEASURES\nPsychiatric Outcomes\nThe CIDI is a fully structured diagnostic interview used to as-\nsess psychiatric disorders following criteria defined in DSM-\nIV.18 Three diagnostic modules were administered: MDD, PD,\nand GAD. The CIDI questions address DSM-IV criteria for each\nof the 3 disorders, and a diagnosis is established based on the\nanswers. Only disorders present during the previous 12 months\nwere identified in this survey.\nMajor depressive disorder is defined as 1 or more major de-\npressive episodes characterized by at least 2 weeks of depressed\nmood or loss of interest, accompanied by at least 4 of the follow-\ning additional symptoms of depression: significant appetite or\nweight change, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agita-\ntion or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, diminished ability\nto think or concentrate or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts\nof death or planning, or attempts. The symptoms must cause sig-\nnificant distress or impairment and are not the result of bereave-\nment. Panic disorder is defined by intense periods of fear or dis-\ncomfort, that is, panic attacks that are recurrent and occur\nunexpectedly. A panic attack is identified when at least 4 of the\nfollowing symptoms are present: heart racing, sweating, shak-\ning, shortness of breath, feeling choked, chest pain, nausea, diz-\nziness, feeling unreal/situation is unreal, afraid to lose control,\nhot flashes, and numbness. A positive diagnosis is established if\n4 or more panic attacks occurred and if at least 1 attack caused\nconcern,worry,orbehaviorchangeduring1monthormore.Gen-\neralizedanxietydisorderisdefinedbyexcessiveanxietyandworry\nthat is difficult to control, with at least 3 of the following symp-\ntoms of anxiety present: unusual fatigue, trouble sleeping, trouble\nconcentrating, irritability, and feeling tense, sore, or muscles ach-\ning. The anxiety must cause clinically significant distress or im-\npairment. For all 3 disorders, symptoms must not be caused by\nthe direct physiologic effects of a substance or another medical\ncondition.\nParticipants completed the CIDI during a private interview\nwith trained interviewers. An automated version of the CIDI\n(version 2.1) was used to facilitate the interview process and\ndata management.17 The CIDI addresses the symptoms listed\nin the previous paragraph, the context in which they occurred\nand the exterior factors possibly explaining them, and the dis-\ntress associated with them to establish the diagnoses based on\nDSM-IV criteria. The CIDI responses are evaluated using a com-\nputer algorithm that assesses each criterion, and criteria are com-\nbined into diagnoses. The diagnoses are designated as part of\nNHANES data processing, and the dichotomous diagnosis vari-\nables--that is, yes or no for a diagnosis in the previous 12\nmonths--were in the NHANES downloaded data sets. These\nvariables are the outcomes in the present study.\nThe CIDI has been widely used in research and population\nsurveys.19-21 It can be administered by lay interviewers with ex-\ncellent reliability, it does not require outside informants or medi-\ncal records, and it does not assume the presence of a current\ndisorder.17 In a validity study,22 CIDI diagnoses were com-\npared with diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview\n(SCID) for DSM-IV, and a high level of concordance was ob-\nserved. Specifically, 84% of cases of anxiety disorder and 70%\nof cases of mood disorder identified in the clinical interview\nwere also identified using the CIDI. The CIDI lifetime preva-\nlence estimates were generally lower than the SCID estimates.\nThe concordance between the SCID and the CIDI is likely to\nbe constrained because the SCID itself has only moderate re-\nliability. Also, the difference in the mode of administration, that\nis, telephone interview for the SCID and in-person interview\nfor the CIDI, could contribute to discordant diagnoses.\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

The NHANES quality as-\nsurance and quality control protocols meet the 1988 Clinical\nLaboratory Improvement Act mandates.25\nOther Variables\nWe included the following variables in the analyses because of\ntheir known associations with lead exposure, mental health sta-\ntus, or both: sex, age, race/ethnicity, education status, and pov-\nerty to income ratio (PIR). Non-Hispanic black persons have\nhigher rates of depression than do non-Hispanic white per-\nsons.26 Women have higher rates of depressive and anxiety dis-\norders,21 as do individuals with less education.27 The preva-\nlence of several disorders is higher in those with lower\nsocioeconomic status,21 which herein was assessed using the\nPIR, a parameter that compares self-reported family income with\nthe US Census\u00adbased poverty threshold value for each calen-\ndar year adjusted for inflation and the age of the family refer-\nence person. The PIR was coded into 4 categories to reflect the\ncurrent standards used in government-financed welfare pro-\ngrams (the lowest category, 1.0, corresponds to the poorest\ngroup). Finally, smoking is strongly associated with depres-\nsion and anxiety disorders.28 Past and current use of tobacco\nproducts was assessed by means of questionnaire, and serum\ncotinine levels were measured to further identify active smok-\ners (based on the 10-ng/mL cutoff value commonly used).29 Six\nhundred twenty-eight persons were considered current smok-\ners: 526 based on questionnaire responses and an additional\n102 based on serum cotinine levels. Lead exposure also differs\nwith respect to sex (higher in men), race/ethnicity (higher in\nblack persons), education status (higher with lower educa-\ntional attainment), socioeconomic status (higher in lower so-\ncioeconomic strata), and smoking (higher in smokers).30,31\nWe used the Complex Samples module of SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc,\nChicago, Illinois) to obtain effect estimates and their confi-\ndence intervals (CIs), accounting for the multistage probabil-\nity sampling design of the NHANES. The NHANES provides\nsample weights to generate population prevalence estimates,\nadjusting for the oversampling of certain population sub-\ngroups and accounting for nonresponse and noncoverage.32 For\nestimates of outcome prevalences and odds ratios (ORs), we\nused the special examination sample weights for the sub-\nsample eligible to be administered the CIDI, computing 6-year\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.32\nTo reduce the effect of extreme values on these analyses,\nwe analyzed blood lead levels in quintiles (first [lowest]: 0.7\nthree participants (1.7%) had blood lead levels lower than the\nlimits of detection. We fit multivariable-adjusted logistic re-\ngression models to estimate the prevalence ORs and 95% CIs\nof MDD, PD, and GAD across increasing blood lead level quin-\ntiles relative to the lowest quintile (ie, the referent). To assess\nthe linear trend in these associations, we fit models using a term\ncreated by assigning to each individual the median value of his\nor her blood lead quintile. All models were adjusted for sex,\nHispanic white, Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, and\nother race or multiracial), education status (less than high school,\nhigh school diploma, and more than high school), and PIR\neling strategy, we also fit logistic regression models using log10\n-\ntransformed blood lead values. The presence of a possible time\ntrend was assessed by adding a dummy variable for the wave\nlation analyses to obtain results stratified by sex. We used P.05\nas the level of statistical significance.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics are given in Table 1. The study\npopulation included more women than men, but, once\nweighted, the observations accounted for an equal rep-\nresentation of men and women. The age distribution was\nfairly uniform and ranged from 20 to 39 years. The num-\nbers of persons meeting the 12-month DSM-IV criteria\n(2.4%) for GAD (Table 2). The corresponding popu-\nlation prevalence estimates, determined after applying the\nno significant differences in blood lead levels, age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, education, PIR, or smoking between those\nto whom the CIDI was administered and those to whom\nit was not (P.1).\nThe geometric mean (SD) blood lead level was 1.24\n(1.96) \u00b5g/dL. The arithmetic mean (SD) blood lead level\nues (0.2%) exceeded 15 \u00b5g/dL. In multivariable-\nadjusted analyses, significantly higher blood lead levels\nwere observed with the following characteristics: being\na man, older age, being Mexican American, lower edu-\ncation status, and current smoking. Blood lead levels were\nalso higher in the poorest group (PIR1.0), although\ndifferences by PIR groups were not significant (P=.80).\nLogistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, race/\nethnicity, education status, and PIR showed that higher\nblood lead quintile was significantly associated with higher\nodds of meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD (P=.05 for\ntrend) and PD (P=.02 for trend) but not for GAD (P=.78)\n(Table 3 [model A]). Persons with blood lead levels in\nthe highest quintile had 2.3 times the odds of MDD (95%\n18.48) as those in the lowest quintile. Sex and race/\nethnicity were significantly associated with the risk of dis-\norders (both at P.01), but age, education status, and\nPIR (P.3 for each) were not. Mexican American per-\nsons had the lowest rates of MDD and PD but the high-\nest blood lead levels. Men had lower rates of disorders\nbut higher blood lead levels than did women.\nWe saw little difference by sex in the associations of\nblood lead levels with MDD, and an interaction term added\nto the logistic regression model was not significant\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.

There were too few cases of PD among men to\nanalyze them separately, but the association among\nwomen only was similar to the combined results.\nTo evaluate possible cohort effects, we added a term for\nyears of data collection to the models, but this term was\nfor GAD) and did not appreciably change the associations\nwith blood lead. We also evaluated the odds of each of the\n3 disorders with respect to blood lead levels on a continu-\ntransformed), and this resulted in findings\nsimilar to the previous trend analyses, with higher blood\nlead levels being associated with increased odds of MDD\nBecause current smoking is related to blood lead level\nand psychiatric disorder status, we conducted sensitiv-\nity analyses excluding the 628 current smokers (Table 3\n[model B]). For MDD, this resulted in ORs slightly higher\nthan those obtained when including these individuals and\na significant trend for increasing odds across increasing\nblood lead quintiles (P=.03). Increasing quintiles of blood\nlead levels were also significantly associated with higher\nodds of PD (P=.01 for trend). The OR for the highest\nblood lead quintile was substantially higher than that in\nmodel A; however, its wide 95% CI was owing to the few\ncases in this analysis (n=14).\nExclusion of individuals with blood lead levels of 10\n\u00b5g/dL or higher (n=13) did not affect the results, with\nchanges only to the second decimal of the estimates.

Of individuals with\nMDD, 6% also met the criteria for PD, 10% for GAD, and\n7% for both. In an analysis of the 104 cases of MDD with\nno comorbid disorders, the findings were similar to those\nfor all cases. The numbers of persons with PD (n=24) and\nGAD (n=22) with no comorbidity were too small to re-\nstrict the analytic sample to these individuals only.\nCOMMENT\nIn the present study, we observed that increasing blood\nlead levels were associated with a significantly higher risk\nof MDD and PD in young adults in the United States. Com-\npared with persons with a blood lead level of less than\n0.7 \u00b5g/dL (the lowest quintile of blood lead in the study\npopulation), those with a level greater than 2.1 \u00b5g/dL (the\nhighest quintile) had a 2.3-fold increased risk of meet-\ning DSM-IV criteria for MDD and a 4.9-fold increased risk\nof PD. After excluding current smokers, the elevation in\nrisk was increased to 2.5-fold for MDD and to 8.2-fold\nfor PD. Although estimates of risk for specific quintiles\nwere imprecise because of the few cases, particularly for\nPD, the trend analyses support the presence of a signifi-\ncant increase in risk across blood lead levels. Likewise,\nmodels that use a continuous parameter for blood lead\nlevels also support this conclusion.\nThese results support previously reported associations\nof mood and anxiety disorders with high occupational lead\nexposure8-12 and less well-documented association with\nlower environmental levels of exposure in older men.15,16\nThe present findings extend these observations to the gen-\neral US population of younger adults. Women are at sig-\nnificantly increased risk of meeting the diagnostic criteria\nfor MDD and anxiety disorders, an observation that is well\ndocumented.19 In exploratory analyses, we saw no evi-\ndence of differential association by sex for blood lead lev-\nels and odds for these disorders, but a larger sample is nec-\nessary to carefully verify this hypothesis.\nIf lead exposure contributes to the etiology of these\ndisorders, the mechanism of action could involve per-\nturbationofneurochemicalprocesses,suchasbrainmono-\namine neurotransmission. Lead exposure is known to dis-\nrupt catecholaminergic systems,33-35 and depression and\nanxiety disorders are strongly associated with distur-\nbances in these systems.36 Studies in animals35 show that\nlong-term lead exposure can decrease serotoninergic ac-\ntivity in several brain regions, including the nucleus ac-\nTable 3.

In a study37 of\npatients with PD with or without depression, positron\nemissiontomographyrevealedthatserotoninreceptortype\n1A levels were reduced by almost one third in the ante-\nrior and posterior cingulates and the raphe nuclei.37 Ex-\nposure to lead in predisposed individuals could trigger\nthe development of depression and PD, increase their se-\nverity, or modify the response to treatments. Investiga-\ntions on how low lead exposure disrupts neurochemi-\ncal processes could provide insights into the mechanisms\nof depressive and anxious states.\nComorbidity was observed in the present study, par-\nticularly for the 2 anxiety disorders with depression. When\nwe conducted an analysis of MDD in which we excluded\npersons with MDD and another disorder, the findings were\nsimilar to those in which we included all persons, sug-\ngesting that the increased odds of MDD with higher blood\nlead levels was not explained by the anxiety disorders.\nOne of the strengths of the present study is the use of\nstructured diagnostic assessments of psychiatric disor-\nders.17 The CIDI has been widely used in psychiatric re-\nsearch and has a high degree of correspondence with clini-\ncal interviews.22 Also, the prevalences observed in the\npresent study for the 3 conditions studied were compa-\nrable with those of other national estimates19 (MDD: 7.8%\nsuggests that the results of the present study can be gen-\neralized to the broader US population.\nThe present study has several limitations, the most im-\nportant being its cross-sectional design. Thus, we can-\nnot rule out the possibility that MDD or PD leads to be-\nhavioral changes that increase exposure to lead, except\nin the case of smoking, for which the sensitivity analysis\nin current nonsmokers argues strongly against. In addi-\ntion, the mental health outcomes under study herein are\nchronic conditions often associated with genetic predis-\nposition in conjunction with long-term stressors.38 There-\nfore, in assessing the role of lead as a risk factor for men-\ntal health outcomes, it would have been desirable to have\nan indicator of long-term lead exposure, such as bone\nlead level, assessed before the onset of psychiatric symp-\ntoms. Bone lead level has a clearance half-life of years to\ndecades, depending on the bone type.39 In a previous\nstudy,15 blood and patella bone lead levels were associ-\nated with a combined measure of anxiety, phobia, and\ndepression symptoms. In the present study, lead was mea-\nsured in blood only. The half-life of lead in blood after\nacute exposure is short, but blood lead concentration in-\ntegrates lead released from bones and current external\nexposures. In settings in which external exposures are\nlow, lead released from bones can be the major contribu-\ntor to blood lead levels. Thus, blood lead level may be a\nreasonable marker of long-term exposure when the sys-\ntem is in equilibrium, with little variation in intake, clear-\nance, or bone-blood partitioning. Situations in which this\nwould not apply are occupational exposures, which might\nvary greatly in time, and osteoporosis, during which lead\nis released from the bone matrix to the blood at an in-\ncreased rate after demineralization.40 In the present study,\nhowever, few individuals were likely to have osteoporo-\nsis because of their young age (maximum age, 40 years).\nWe could not exclude occupationally exposed individu-\nals because of limited information on job exposures, but\nthe exclusion of those with elevated blood lead levels\nwould likely capture any current work-related lead ex-\nposure and did not alter the results.\nAs in any observational study, the associations in this\nstudy could be biased by uncontrolled confounders. We\ndid, however, adjust for several important likely con-\nfounding factors (sex, age, race/ethnicity, education sta-\ntus, and annual income). Furthermore, the sensitivity\nanalyses that excluded current smokers indicate that re-\nsidual confounding by smoking does not explain the as-\nsociations of blood lead levels and risk of psychiatric\ndisease but, in fact, may partly mask it.\nCurrent blood lead levels in the US population are\nlower than they were in the mid-20th century,2 but they\nremain elevated from an evolutionary perspective, that\nis, in relation to the natural lead levels before industri-\nalization.41 Widespread lead pollution has occurred only\nin relatively modern history as a result of anthropo-\ngenic activity.42 The finding of an association between\nblood lead level and MDD and PD, despite the low lev-\nels and narrow range of observed lead levels, supports\nthe contention that current lead exposures at low levels\nmay have important effects on mental health. Because the\ncurrent measurements of blood lead level reflect, in part,\nlead sequestered in bone, the observed relations with in-\ncreased odds of depression and PD could also reflect la-\ntent effects of past exposures during critical develop-\nmental periods, which would be consistent with\nneurodevelopmental hypotheses of mood and anxiety dis-\norders.43 If lead exposure contributes to the etiology of\nMDD and PD, continued efforts at reducing population\nexposures even beyond currently acceptable levels may\ndecrease their incidence.\nIn conclusion, risks of MDD and PD in young adults\nincreased with higher blood lead levels. These findings\nsuggest that lead neurotoxicity may contribute to ad-\nverse mental health outcomes, even at levels generally\nconsidered to pose low or no risk. These findings, com-\nbined with recent reports44,45 of adverse behavioral out-\ncomes in children with similarly low blood lead levels,\nshould underscore the need for considering ways to fur-\nther reduce environmental lead exposures.\nAuthor Affiliations: De\n\u00b4partement de sante\n\u00b4 environemen-\ntale et sante\n\u00b4 au travail, Universite\n\u00b4 de Montre\n\u00b4al, Mon-\ntre\n\u00b4al, Que\n\u00b4bec, Canada (Dr Bouchard); Departments of\nNeurology and Environmental Health, Harvard Medical\nSchool, Harvard School of Public Health, Children's Hos-\npital, Boston, Massachusetts (Dr Bellinger); Rush Insti-\ntute for Healthy Aging, Rush University Medical Cen-\nter, Chicago, Illinois (Dr Weuve); Departments of\nEnvironmental Health (Drs Bouchard, Weuve, Wright,\nSchwartz, and Weisskopf), Society, Human Develop-\nment, and Health (Dr Gilman), and Epidemiology (Drs\nGilman, Schwartz, and Weisskopf), Harvard School of\nPublic Health; Department of Psychiatry, University of\nMassachusetts Medical School, Worcester (Dr Matthews-\nBellinger); Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical\nSchool, Children's Hospital (Dr Wright); and Channing\n\u00a92009 American Medical Association.
