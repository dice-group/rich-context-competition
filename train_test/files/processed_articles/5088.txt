    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article focuses on the forces that prevent nations from developing politically, socially, and economically or why some\nof them have failed to achieve their purpose. It draws profusely from two inspiring books: Why Nations Fail and Leading From\nthe Emerging Future to explore as to whether or not the political leaders of Nigeria can learn any lesson from the seminal\nwork. The books concentrate on practical approaches that empower political leaders to shift their mind-sets to enable them\nto transform their extant extractive political and economic institutions that hinder national development. Unlike previous\nstudies on leadership and development in Nigeria, which have observed that the system has been rendered unproductive by\npoor leadership, this article argues that the problem with Nigeria is that the political leaders have failed to shift their engrained\nmind-sets from \"ego-system awareness to eco-system reality\" to enable them to build and maintain effective institutions and\ninfrastructure that drive the economy and develop the nations. It also argues that discussion about the leaders' mind-set and\nnational development deserves a different approach to transform the nation's ossified institutions into innovative and creative\nones. This will encourage the leaders to collectively shift their mental models to design and implement growth policies that\nwill fit into the 21st-century economy and empower them to lead from the emerging future.\n",

But the performances of these institutions\nand the development of nations vary according to the socio-\npolitical dynamics of every society. In other words, every\ncase is different because what works in one society may not\nbe effective in another one. Therefore, the transformation of\nmulti-religious and multi-lingual Nigeria and its seemingly\nchaotic sociopolitical and economic environment require a\nleader with the skills and knowledge to address the systemic\nbottlenecks that hinder national development. That will\ninvolve changing the structure and \"human consciousness\"\ntheir engrained \"ego-system awareness\" into \"eco-system\nAlthough the process seems daunting because of the disor-\ndered Nigerian environment, it is not by any means impossible to\naccomplish with collective mindfulness (Scharmer & Kaufer,\n2013) as every Nigerian is a stakeholder in the affairs of the\nnation. However, Germer, Siegel, and Fulton (2005) have defined\n\"mindfulness,\" among other things, as a \"moment-by-moment\nawareness\" (p. 6). For Bodhi (2000), mindfulness means having\nawareness, attention, and remembering. However, to the already\ncrowded definition, Davis and Hayes (2011) have added that\n\"mindfulness is a moment-to-moment awareness of one's expe-\nrience without judgment\" (p. 198). Yet others have noted that\n\"mindful leaders\" are \"courageous,\" they perceive the \"big pic-\nture\" and \"create environments of trust and safety,\" which\nThe differing perspectives on the issue of poverty are not\nnew.

Worse still, the system is colored\nby unbridled corruption, non-functional health care and edu-\ncation systems, and institutions and infrastructure that are\nantithetical to capacity development. These forces have\nresulted in a weak economy, rising youth unemployment,\nand poverty as well as insecurity in the society. The leaders\ndo not seem to understand that empowering the people will\nchange the future of the society. It has been noted that no\nsociety can separate poverty from the political and economic\nforces in the society as well as the mind-set of the leaders\nbecause they determine the state of human condition in every\nnation.\nBut what is mind-set? According to Webster's New\nCollegiate dictionary (1980), mind-set is \"a mental inclina-\ntion, . . . a . . . state of mind\" (p. 725). For the Oxford\nAdvanced Learner's Dictionary (2015), mind-set \"is a set of\nattitudes or fixed ideas that someone has and that are often\ndifficult to change\" (para. 1). Meanwhile, for Dweck (2007),\nprofessor of psychology at Stanford, mind-set is a set of atti-\ntudes, or \"mindsets are just beliefs . . . powerful beliefs . . .\nsomething in your mind . . .\" (2007, p. 16) that need not be so\nset. For the author, everyone has either a fixed mind-set or a\ngrowth mind-set that can be changed. A fixed mind-set is one\nin which you view your talents and abilities as well fixed or\nthat your \"qualities are carved in stone.\" You are who you\nare, your intelligence and talents are fixed, and your fate is to\ngo through life avoiding challenge and failure (Dweck,\n2007). But a growth mind-set, however, is one in which an\nindividual sees his or her mind-set as fluid, a work in prog-\nress; that means that our fate is one of growth and opportu-\nnity. Furthermore, according to Dweck (2007), mind-sets are\nnot set or \"carved in stone\" (p. 6) because at any time, any\nperson can learn to use a growth mind-set to achieve success\nand happiness and that a change of mind is always possible\n(Dweck, 2007). That is what good leaders (as well as their\nfollowers) need for their nations to develop and thrive and\nfor their citizens to reach their full potential. Given the back-\nground, a person's mind-set directs his or her action. That,\naccording to Dweck (2007), means that \"The view you\nadopts for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your\nlife. It can determine whether you become the person you\nwant to be and whether you accomplish the things you value\"\nIf this writer may ask, are the mind-sets of Nigeria's lead-\ners \"carved in stone?\" Why is Nigeria difficult to change?\nWhy has Nigeria failed to develop with abundant human and\nmaterial resources at its disposal? Why has prosperity eluded\nthe nation? Why are many Nigerians swimming in the deep\nocean of poverty? Put differently, why is there a rising unem-\nployment rate in the society? There are conflicting reports on\nthe rate of unemployment in Nigeria because of paucity of\ndata. Available pertinent information shows that Nigeria's\nunemployment rate is about 24% (this is a very conservative\nfigure). However, youth unemployment rate is put at more\nthan 50%, which represents about 64 million people (\"Rate\nof Job Creation Insufficient to Tame Unemployment in\nNigeria,\" 2014). But for the new Oxford Poverty and Human\nDevelopment Initiative (OPHI), Nigeria's poverty rate is\nIt is proper to note that three groups of unemployed youths\nhave been identified in this article: university graduates, high\nschool graduates not yet enrolled in any university program,\nand those who did not complete high school education.\nOthers who have added to the rising rate of unemployment\ninclude people who choose to leave their current job to retire,\nthose who went back to school to acquire new skills and\nknowledge for another career, and those who take a position\nat another organization. It is, however, proper to note that\nmost of the unemployed youths are vulnerable to antisocial\nactivities as they are struggling to make ends meet without\nany form of government assistance.\nGiven the above background, the political leaders do not\nseem to be taking responsibility for these problems as every-\none is blaming everyone else. Nigeria's leaders, it appears,\nhate to be held accountable for anything. It is also proper to\nnote that the root cause of the present social, political, and\neconomic predicaments in the society is not the making of\nthe leaders alone, but collective selfishness. Everybody in\nNigeria, it seems, wants to be in a leadership position whether\nor not they have the skills and knowledge to stimulate a\nhealthy competition, increase the wealth of the nation, and\nthus, create economic opportunity for everyone. Leadership\nis not about revenue sharing but about moving people to\naction to create wealth. These actions are possible with lead-\ners who are committed to improving the living conditions of\nthe people.\nThe challenges facing Nigeria appear to be deep-rooted in\nthe mind-sets of the leaders and the nation's extractive politi-\ncal and economic institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson,\n2012). As a result, there is a serious disconnect between ego-\nsystem thinking and eco-system reality (Scharmer & Kaufer,\n2013). It has aptly been noted that the state of our mind-sets\nor mental models (Senge, 2006) affect what we do--our per-\nformance, decision-making process, and how we manage\nourselves. For Nigeria to move forward socially, politically,\nand economically, the leaders and followers (in collective\nleadership) should have a deeper shift in their mind-sets and\ngravitate toward \"eco-system awareness\" from their\nengrained \"ego-system thinking\" (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013,\nAccording to Albert Einstein's famous dictum, we cannot\nsolve our present problems with the same level of mind-set\nor consciousness that created them. Meanwhile, because of\nthe failure of the political leaders of Nigeria to change their\nmindset and embrace creative and innovative ideas that will\ntransform and restructure the system, Nigeria's non-func-\ntional education and health care systems will continue to\nthreaten the growth and development of the economy as\nthese are the engines that drive individual and national produc-\ntivity. But \"failure is not an option\" (Blankstein, 2010, p. 1) for\nNigeria. However, what Nigeria will become is the society\nthe leaders and followers have decided to create. Without a\ndoubt, majority of the people wants a leader who can lead\nfrom the emerging future possibilities.\nPurpose\nThis article revisits the issues of leadership and development\nin Nigeria as it attempts to investigate as to whether or not\nthe leaders have any lessons to learn from Why Nations Fail\nand Leading From the Emerging Future. The books, as noted\nearlier, deal on practical approach to helping leaders shift\ntheir mind-sets from their ego-system awareness to eco-sys-\ntem reality and create inclusive political and economic insti-\ntutions to empower the citizens to reach their full potential.\nThis article, therefore, seeks to discuss some of the pertinent\nissues raised in the books as they relate to leadership and\ndevelopment problems facing Nigeria.\nResearch Method\nThis article will attempt to provide an in-depth assessment of\nthe forces that are preventing Nigeria from developing as it\nshould with the abundant human and material resources at its\ndisposal. As noted, information for this article was derived\nmainly from Why Nations Fail and Leading From the\nEmerging Future. Information is also gathered from the\nresearch and descriptive analysis of other scholars, analysts,\nand practitioners as well as recent newspaper and journal\narticles that are pertinent to the issues in discourse. Thus, the\nprimary method of study was an extensive review of avail-\nable related literature for an extensive and in-depth descrip-\ntion and analysis of leadership and development problems in\nNigeria and their implications in the society. The sources of\nthe information were thoroughly evaluated and analyzed to\ndetermine their authenticity.\nProblem Statement\nDebates about why Nigeria has failed to develop as it should\nwith abundant human and material resources at its disposal\nhave been raging for decades. Some have noted that the\nproblem is due to the absence of effective leadership. Yet\nothers have observed that Nigeria is stuck in its present\nsociopolitical and economic predicaments because the lead-\ners have been unable to change their mental models (Senge,\n2006), which has prevented them from building critical insti-\ntutions and infrastructure capable of transforming the society\ninto the 21st-century system. Yet the political leaders who\napparently have \"fixed mind-set\" appear to think that Nigeria\ncan be transformed into an industrialized society without\nchanging their mentality, reframing their meaning of\nleadership, building functional institutions, and designing and\nimplementing pro-growth policies. The political leaders of\nthe developed countries could not have transformed their\neconomies into the healthy and productive state they are\ntoday without shifting their mentality that enabled them to\nlead from the emerging future.\nResearch Questions\nThis article focuses on the following questions:\nResearch Question 1: Do most leaders of Nigeria pos-\nsess fixed or flexible mind-set?\nResearch Question 2: What will it take for the political\nleaders to change their mind-sets from \"ego-system\nawareness\" to \"eco-system reality?\"\nResearch Question 3: Why has Nigeria failed to develop\nas it should with the abundant human and material\nresources at its disposal?\nResearch Question 4: Can Nigeria become an industrial-\nized nation without inclusive political and economic\ninstitutions?\nDesigning a New Strategy\nLeaders of developed nations are known to have continually\nshown their knack in managing difficult situations by craft-\ning functional strategies that align with the culture of the\nsociety or organization they lead. When a society, a person,\nor an organization has a problem, the first instinct will be to\nfind a solution(s) to the problems (Kahane, 2005). A well-\ndesigned strategy is a symbol of action that will enable the\nauthorities to achieve the desired goal--whether it is chang-\ning the behavior of a people or engineering a social change.\nA strategy is a \"game plan\" to achieve one or more goals. It\nis a plan, a \"how\" and \"a means of getting from here to there\"\n(Mintzberg, 1994, p. 23). A \". . . strategy is a solution to\nmove from where you are now to where you want to be\"\nAs mentioned earlier, Nigeria is facing myriad social,\npolitical, and economic problems. Yet the leaders do not\nappear to have the skills and knowledge to design and imple-\nment effective strategies to resolve the issues. For instance,\nthey are unable to tackle the infrastructural and institutional\nproblems, improve the nation's standard of education, and\nrebuild the economy. The nation's system of education and\nthat of the economy must align to make a difference in the\nlife of the people. The political leaders should flip the lens\naround a little to work out ways to serve the public good.\nThey should collectively \"develop cross-sector platforms of\ninnovation and leadership\" (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013,\np. 205) for positive change in the country.\nIt has been noted that Nigeria's leadership quality is in its\nDNA. For instance, the fundamental causes of Nigeria's\nweak economy are poor leadership and governance that have\ncontributed immensely to non-functional infrastructure and\n4 SAGE Open\ninstitutions, low quality of education, and lack of practical\nskills and knowledge to drive the economy. There is no dis-\ncernable change of attitude on the part of the leaders to\naddress the shortfalls in the system; they are not willing to put\ntheir egos aside and listen to the people. They are mired in\nwhat has been branded \"ego-system awareness\" (Scharmer &\nKaufer, 2013). The political leaders appear to worry about the\nrealities in the eco-system only when there are serious national\nissues that threaten their own well-being such as the Ebola\ncrisis (Freeman, 2014, para. 1) described as \"an epidemic\nAt this critical juncture, Nigeria needs a leader who is\ncommitted to leading the society to a bright and bold future.\nThis is because political stability in any country comes with\nthe development of the institutions and infrastructure that\ndrive the economy, create employment, and take care of the\npeople's needs. Nigeria has abundant natural and human\nresources that will enable the people to tackle their family\nand community obligations, only if the leaders can change\nfrom their ego-system awareness to eco-system reality\n(Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013). Without the political leaders\nreframing their thinking model and their meaning of leader-\nship, without fixing the infrastructure and institutions that\ndrive the economy, without transforming the education sys-\ntem into the 21st-century model and equipping the students\nwith the knowledge and skills to compete effectively in the\nknowledge-driven global economy (Banks, 2008), and with-\nout taking care of the needs of the growing number of the\npeople in poor health, the society will remain unproductive\nand underdeveloped.\n\"Reframing Leadership\" in Nigeria\nDebates about the seemingly absence of effective leadership\nin Nigeria have been endless. For instance, Achebe (1983)\nhas observed that \"the problem with Nigeria is the failure of\nleadership\" (p. 1). Others have noted that there is poor lead-\nership in Nigeria because most of the leaders are mired in a\nsense of entitlement in their actions, beliefs, and attitudes\nlike their myriad social, political, and economic problems\nresolved by their political leaders. Specifically, they would\nlike to have an enabling environment and a healthy economy,\npeace and stability in government, good roads, and func-\ntional hospitals and schools. Also, they would like their\nhuman and civil rights respected. The leaders talk about\nthese issues without resolving them; instead, they lock them-\nselves up in their lofty offices dishing out orders that are\nunimplemented. But the people may not get the services they\nwant without the leaders reframing their meaning of leader-\nTrue leaders have passion and understanding for those\nthey lead. And they are known to resolve conflicts by refram-\ning the situation, which means \"looking at the situation with\na new set of eyes.\" When the leader reframes, it will enable\nhim or her to respond to the situations by commanding con-\ntrol with confidence. As noted, leadership is not in the posi-\ntion, it is taking responsibility and accountability, and it is\nworking for the good of society to enable the people to\nachieve their full potential (The Integral Business Leadership\nGroup, 2013). Instead of providing services, the political\nleaders use government policies to buy support from the\npeople.\nPersonal growth is a component part of leadership. Thus,\nthe leaders must change their mind-set to lead from the\nemerging future possibilities (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013). As\nPeter F. Drucker has noted, \"You cannot manage other peo-\nple [or a society] unless you manage yourself first\" (cited in\nThe Integral Business Leadership Group, 2013, para. 1). In\nLeadership, Burns (1978) has noted two types of leaders: (a)\ntransformative and (b) transactional. Transformative leaders\nare those who have a vision to mobilize people to action,\nwhile transactional leaderships are addicted to quid pro\nquo--\"If you scratch my back, I will scratch yours\" (see\nBanks, 2008, p. 94). This style of leadership seems pervasive\nin Nigeria. Yet, another type is leadership that hands down\norders from top to bottom. This style of leadership is mostly\nadopted by leaders who want utmost control over the deci-\nsion-making process in an organization (Kouzes & Posner,\n1995). Also, most of the leaders of Nigeria appear to fall\nwithin this category; the society has powerful leaders with-\nout effective institutions to tame their actions (The Integral\nMany people in Nigeria wish to be leaders, but very few\nof them seem to understand the essence of leadership. True\nleadership is about serving the people; it is about having a\nsense of responsibility; it is about providing the people the\nservice they need, or \"getting things done through people\"\n(Northouse, 2007, p. 3). In addition, leadership is about\ninspiring others to excel. In a democratic society, power is\nsaid to come from the people at the grassroots. In making\ndecisions the leaders must be cognizant of the opinions and\nneeds of the people. And the leader will assume responsibil-\nity for what went well and what went wrong because true\nleadership is about taking responsibility wherever responsi-\nbility needs taking. Put differently by Scharmer and Kaufer\n(2013), \"The essence of leadership has always been about\nsensing and actualizing the future\" (p. 110).\nIn productive and progressive societies, creativity is alive\nin everything they do. There is inspiration and aspiration\ninvolved in education as talented faculty is hired and stu-\ndents radiate creativity in innovations and research. All these\nare made possible by the political leaders who invest national\nresources in technological development and innovation.\nEducational institutions offer students high-quality educa-\ntion that leads to good career pathway. This is not the case in\nNigeria where political leaders are filling their pockets with\npublic money, instead of serving the people. To move for-\nward, Nigeria's leaders must change their mind-sets and the\npeople must not allow them to continue \"patching prob-\nlems,\" instead of \"redesigning\" the system to make it func-\ntion effectively. The leaders should also learn to become\nbetter listeners and empower the people with the skills and\nknowledge they need to become more productive. In addi-\ntion, they should be \"grounded in mindfulness and service\"\n(Maqueda, 2014, para. 1) to enable them design and execute\neffective policies, and offer solutions to the nation's myriad\nsocial, political, and economic problems. That means refram-\ning leadership and the environment.\nReinventing the Environment\nNigeria's existing democratic structures are not yet effective.\nIts extractive political and economic institutions do not cre-\nate incentive for the citizens to save, invest, and innovate.\nPower and wealth are concentrated in the hands of those con-\ntrolling state apparatus. In other words, only those in control\nof or connected to those in political power are benefitting\nfrom the system. Lack of effective law and order and eco-\nnomic incentive has destroyed the environment. As human\nbeings, our actions, attitudes, and beliefs are defined by our\ncannot remain in a dysfunctional environment and expect\ngood outcomes in what we do. As our \"physical life\" is\naffected by the \"physical environment\" (Dewey, 1934,\np. 345), so also our nation's environment will affect the qual-\nity of attention the people will give to their actions. The sys-\ntem is corruption-charged, and that has affected the \"moral\nthe economy. \"No permanent solution is possible save in a\nThe political leaders can only change the system by\nchanging their mental models (Senge, 2006). They are\nalways on each other's throat with their petty politics (\"What\nSeems a Petty Dispute,\" 2014, p. 31), instead of dealing with\nbroad national issues and creating an environment that would\naccommodate the interests of the diverse population. For\ninstance, the former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, is always\ncritical of the policies of President Goodluck Jonathan (see\nObasanjo, 2013), instead of working collaboratively with his\nadministration to build a stable and brighter future for the\nsociety. Also, instead of designing and implementing effec-\ntive monetary policies to build a healthy economy, the for-\nmer governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mallam Sanusi\nLamido Sanusi, who is now the Emir of Kano, took delight\nin heating up the polity when he alleged that the Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) failed to remit\nabout US$49.8 billion to government's coffer (see Leba,\nThe long-running misunderstanding between the Federal\nGovernment and the Academic Staff Union of Universities\n(ASUU)--a union of university academic professors founded\nof higher institutions for months. In addition, the relentless\ndrop in global oil prices is putting enormous economic pres-\nsures on the government that lacks any solution to the prob-\nlem. Worse still, the Boko Haram (a militant Islamic group)\nis threatening to destabilize the country. Do the political\nelites want political reform or revolution?\nEveryone seems to agree with the general observation that\ncorruption and economic mismanagement (Ross, 2014),\nwhich has scared away both domestic and foreign investors\nfrom the economy, is a major part of the problem. As of\ntoday, the state does not seem to have the capacity to stop\nthe terrorists creating chaos. The terrorists do not seem to\nbe selecting a particular group of people to kill; they are\nindiscriminately killing people. The leaders do not seem to\nhave any solution to this presently as they are pointing\naccusing fingers at everyone else. It is feared that this can\nprecipitate into a state failure. The energy wasted on all\nthese sociopolitical plots could have been channeled toward\nreinventing the education system to open the nation \"up to\nthe highest future possibilities\" (Scharmer & Kaufer 2013,\nRadical Transformation of the Education System\nAs observed earlier, Nigeria is facing major challenges,\nincluding the crisis in the education system and corruption\nscandals that are strewn around the political landscape like\nstraw hut in a hurricane (Ross, 2014). In particular, the edu-\ncation system lacks proper funding and planning (Afolayan,\n2014), and teaching and learning are based on theory with\nlittle or no practical application of what the students learned\nin the classroom. Practical application is the way for any\nsociety to become innovative and creative, and thus produce\nresults the people want (Scharmer & Kaufer, 2013). It has\nbeen observed that the ultimate goal of teaching is to ensure\nthat students develop a deep understanding of the subject\nmatter and interconnected knowledge and skills they can\nThe problem facing the nation's education system and\nother facets of the polity is dictated by the political and eco-\nnomic institutions that do not shift toward progressive,\ndestructive innovation and thus economic success. In a nut\nshell, this means that destructive innovation (or creative\ninnovation) will replace obsolete technologies with new and\nemerging technologies as well as create better ways of think-\ning, leading, and doing things. Nigeria's repressive political\nand economic institutions have contributed immensely to the\neventual socioeconomic decay or stagnation (Acemoglu &\nRobinson, 2012). To transform the education system, the\nleaders'policies must shift toward promoting favorable insti-\ntutions, creativity, and progressive innovation (Acemoglu &\nRobinson, 2012). And the teachers and administrators in the\neducation sector should be motivated to acquire the knowl-\nedge and skills needed to introduce practical education that\n6 SAGE Open\nScholars have observed that nations will rise when they\ndesign and implement pro-growth political institutions that\nshare power (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012), train, educate,\nand produce productive workers. But they fail when the\ninstitutions fail to adapt to the environment or when the pow-\nerful political elites benefiting from the status quo prevent\nthe institutions from being effective. So, to move forward,\nthe leaders should create progressive institutions and adopt\nmethods that have been tested by successful countries and\nadapt them to fit into Nigeria's environment. Although some\neducators and policymakers think that investing in technol-\nogy will improve the education standards and student perfor-\nmance, others have different opinion. For instance, Daniel\nGoleman in his inspiring new book, The Triple Focus: A New\nApproach to Education, co-authored with Peter Senge, thinks\nthat the combination of instructions in \"social and emotional\nlearning\" can enable students to better understand them-\nselves, their friends, and their environment. Such instruc-\ntional techniques can improve both social skills and academic\nThus, improving Nigeria's education system should go\nbeyond rhetoric. Blaming the teachers is not the answer to\nthe failing standard of education in Nigeria. The extractive\npolitical and economic institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson,\n2012) in which the teachers work are the problems. As long\nas the underlying institutional problems are not resolved, all\nthe rhetoric will not fix the education system. Nigeria should\nbuild inclusive political and economic institutions to\nempower the teachers and treat them as professionals they\nreally are. In addition, they should adopt effective teaching\nand learning as well as education reform that will add value\nto the system. This seems possible only through building\nmindful schools and training mindful educators--those who\nhave the welfare of students at heart, and are committed and\nmotivated to making teaching and learning enjoyable. It has\nbeen observed that mindfulness is an antidote to the diseases\nPerhaps because of poor investment in human capital\ndevelopment (education and health care system), Nigeria's\nsecondary school (high school) graduates the educational\ninstitutions churn out yearly are ill-prepared to face the rig-\nors of university education. To reverse this ugly trend, lead-\ners of the secondary school education sub-sector should\ndevelop progressive policies and educate the educators so\nthat they can empower their students with the knowledge\nand skills to become effective participants in 21st-century\nsociety (Banks, 2008). Lack of proper attention in preparing\nhigh school graduates for university education seems to\npose serious problems for the development of creative,\ninnovative, and productive citizens. For the workers to com-\npete effectively in the 21st global economy (Scharmer &\nKaufer, 2013), the education system should be transformed\nto meet 21st-century standards by equipping workers with\nthe 21st-century knowledge and skills (Trilling & Fadel,\nThis writer avers that if teachers are well trained, it will\nlead to motivation of teachers as well as improve teaching\nand learning strategy in the classroom. It is, therefore, neces-\nsary for Nigeria to adopt innovative and imaginative ways to\ntrain and support teachers to enable them to deliver quality\nteaching and better motivate students. It is equally essential\nfor teachers and administrators to understand their philoso-\nphy of teaching, which is their business, as that will be essen-\ntial for them to understand themselves and their colleagues\nbetter, as this may engender high individual performance and\nteam work.\nTo restructure the education system, Nigeria needs lead-\ners \"who are transformative in orientation\" (Banks, 2008, p.\nto organize and mobilize other people to action. Without\nretooling the education system and arming the workers with\nappropriate skills and knowledge and without abolishing\npolicies and politics that are inimical to economic develop-\nment and prosperity, Nigeria cannot be transformed into a\nproductive society. Developed and progressive countries\nbecame what they are today because their people fought and\noverthrew the powerful political elites who dominated politi-\ncal power, and thus create a society where political rights\nwere properly shared and the government was responsive to\nthe needs of the people (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012).\nAs noted earlier, to improve the education system, the\neducators should first be educated and motivated to empower\ntheir students, because the quality of faculty and teachers\nmatter (Kezar & Maxey, 2014) in the quality of teaching and\nsupport they provide the students. The education leaders are\ngood at blaming the teachers and students for the poor per-\nformance in external examinations such as West African\nExaminations Council (WAEC) and National Examinations\nCouncil (NECO) without taking responsibility for their own\ncontribution to their poor performance. Quality counts; the\nleaders should develop an education system that serves the\nsociety well. Thus, they should upgrade the status of the edu-\ncators and respect them like other professionals; they should\nempower them to make better decisions (Banks, 2008) and\neffectively perform their duties. \"A teacher's skill makes a\ndifference in student performance\" both \"in school and their\nfeelings of well-being\" (Saphier, Haley-Speca, & Gower,\nExtractive institutions hamper national development.\nThus, without inclusive institutions, sustainable growth and\ndevelopment is difficult, if not impossible (Acemoglu &\nRobinson, 2012). It is unreasonable to expect the disre-\nspected teachers to educate and motivate the youth; the soci-\nety should expect to get only what it has invested in the\nWhen teachers feel honored, they will develop the will and\ncapability to educate their students and equip them with the\nskills, knowledge and attitudes to \"become change agents [in\nthe] society\" (Banks, 2008, p. 97). The bottom line is that the\nsociety should reform the institutions and discard the educa-\ntion policies that do not work because the state of the educa-\ntion system will affect the conditions of the whole system,\nincluding the health care system.\nTransforming the Health Care System\nAs noted above, inclusive institutions matter in national\ndevelopment. According to Acemoglu and Robinson (2012),\n\"institutions that encourage prosperity create positive feed-\nback . . . that prevent efforts by [greedy and selfish political]\nelites to undermine them\" (p. x). Like in the education sys-\ntem, Nigeria's health care system does not appear to meet the\nneeds of the people. Poorly equipped hospitals and health\nclinics are strewn all over Nigeria (Dantiye, 2015; see \"The\nHealth Workers Strike,\" 2014). And like the educational\ninstitutions, the health care institutions are lacking the emerg-\ning 21st-century medical science and technologies that\nwould enable the health care workers to provide high-quality\nhealth services to the people (Adejoro, 2015; Musawa,\nHowever, due to ineffective institutions, the health care\nproviders cannot provide good quality services without\nproper training and resources. Worse still, they operate in\nunsafe work environments (Dantiye, 2015). Thus, transfor-\nmation of the health care system should \"revolve around\ntransforming the relationship between patients and the\nThat means changing the political attitude of the elites as\nwell as creating pro-growth health care strategies and institu-\ntions. There are many communities without basic health care\nfacilities; as a result, the people do not have access to pri-\nConsequently, thousands of Nigerians die every year from\npreventable diseases such as high blood pressure, hyperten-\nsion, prostate cancer, diabetes, breast cancer, maternal child\nbirth issues, and malnutrition (Musawa, 2014).\nUnfortunately, because of poor institutions and deteriora-\ntion of the health care system, the political leaders (and oth-\ners who can afford it) often travel abroad to receive\nhigh-quality health care services at the expense of the public\nresort to private assistance to resolve their basic health prob-\nlems (see \"The Health Workers Strike,\" 2014). To produce a\nhealthy and productive workforce for the 21st-century econ-\nomy and to build a stable society, the leaders should rethink\nthe ways they manage the nation's health care institutions.\nThe ineffective political institutions are inimical to eco-\nnomic growth. Medical doctors and other health care work-\ners are often on strike to press home their demands over\ndiverse issues, including non-payment of salaries and allow-\nances, which often lead to unnecessary loss of lives (see\nAtoyebi, 2014). Some people think that the health care pro-\nfessionals care only about their remuneration than provision\nof health services to the needy (see News Agency of Nigeria\n[NAN], 2014). As a result, many Nigerians have lost faith in\nthe health care system as they perceive the health care work-\ners as unreliable, unskilled, undereducated, and not kind-\nhearted care providers (Dantiye, 2015). Everyone should\nhave access to high-quality health care that is being now\nenjoyed only by the rich political leaders. The administrators\nof the health care system, in collaboration with the medical\ncommunity, should transform and modernize the health care\nsystem for the benefit of everyone. Building functional\nhealth care facilities in every community to deliver high-\nquality health services to the citizens and building a healthy\neconomy is imperative. But this requires an effective institu-\ntion and a transformative leader who will work collectively\nwith others in the society.\nBuilding a Healthy Economy\nBuilding a healthy economy does not occur overnight. It\ntakes planning, resources, and unswerving leadership to\nbuild and sustain a healthy economy. The first step is for the\nleaders of Nigeria to develop a growth mind-set and shift the\nnation's educational paradigm to educate and train the tech-\nnical manpower to drive the economy. Ineffective political\nand economic institutions are known to bread a weak econ-\nomy, which creates high unemployment and poverty and\ngenerates sociopolitical uncertainty (Scharmer & Kaufer,\n2013). Yet the political leaders do not seem to take the threat\nto national stability seriously as they are mired in their self-\nish political interest. As emphasized in Leading From the\nEmerging Future, \"In order to meet the challenges of our\ntime, we need to shift our thinking as individuals and as a\nsociety\" because \"Today's economy works as a set of locally\nembedded and globally interlinked eco-systems\" (Scharmer\nNigeria's economy is not an exception. Many Nigerians\nappear to have entrepreneurial skills; they are very creative\nand innovative. But the unpredictable and unconducive,\nextractive political institutions and unfriendly business envi-\nronment have stunted their zeal. In particular, poor leader-\nship that has combined with all these conditions to create\nweak economy has not allowed the society to tackle its sys-\ntemic problems. Starting a small business from scratch is\nchallenging. It takes a lot of passion and determination to\nkeep your business running and to market your products or\nservices under the poor business environment in Nigeria.\nThus, the situation does not allow for creativity and innova-\ntion (Schumpeter, 1942). To build a healthy economy, the\npolitical leaders must shift their mind-sets and invest in the\ninfrastructure and institutions that drive the economy and\nenhance individual and national productivity. Also, the soci-\nety must empower the youth with the skills and knowledge to\ntake initiatives, conduct independent inquiry, compete effec-\ntively in the global economy, and produce results the society\nnoted, \"When . . . people develop [effective institutions and\n8 SAGE Open\nwork collaboratively] . . . they can be a formidable force for\nchange\" in the society (p. 370).\nIn reality, the secret of economic growth, since the time of\nAdam Smith, is specialization. But this is possible with\neffective political and economic institutions to enable Nigeria\ntrain the needed technical manpower to specialize in produc-\ning the goods and services the world wants. This goes to say\nthat economic growth and investment in human capital\ndevelopment are inseparable as they complement each other\n(Ocampo & Vallejo, 2012). As noted above, why Nigeria has\nfailed to develop and why the people are poor is because the\npolitical and economic institutions are extractive (Acemoglu\n& Robinson, 2012). Put differently, the leaders extract mate-\nrial and financial resources (revenue) from the system with-\nout investing in the institutions and infrastructure that drive\nthe economy.\nThe mood in Nigeria does not appear upbeat because the\npeople are not politically empowered as the society is eco-\nnomically underdeveloped. Although Nigeria has a history\nof democratic elections, it does not seem to have an inclusive\npolitical institution. This is because during elections, there is\nviolence and intimidation and electoral fraud. And the sys-\ntem does not have a political level playing field; the rich and\npowerful individuals control the system. In some cases,\nchaos would reign, colored by kidnapping and political mur-\nders. Those who can afford it would hire private security per-\nsonnel for protection. Nigeria cannot build a healthy economy\nand lead from the emerging future without the leaders shift-\ning from their engrained \"ego-system to eco-system aware-\nness both individually and collectively\" (Scharmer & Kaufer,\nand underdeveloped with untold human misery.\nWhy Has Nigeria Failed to Develop?\nHistory is replete with reasons nations have failed to achieve\ntheir purpose. Some scholars blame lack of effective political\nand economic institutions to manage the affairs of the society\n(Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012). Others blame poor leader-\nship (Achebe, 1983). In particular, Nigeria has failed to\ndevelop as it should because of poor leadership and extrac-\ntive political and economic institutions that have concen-\ntrated political and economic power (or the wealth of the\nnation) in the hands of the corrupt politicians who are con-\ntrolling the state machinery. The selfish politicians have per-\npetually pauperized the citizens because they have refused or\nfailed to provide them basic public services, such as good\nroads, quality education, and constant supply of electricity.\nThis is not to mention lack of good drinking water and basic\nhealth care. Everyone knows that water sustains life and\nunhealthy individual is an unproductive worker.\nLack of water and functional health care undermine the\nhealth, safety, and productivity of the people in Nigeria. In\naddition, Nigeria has failed to develop because the nation's\ndemocracy and the type of policies that come out of it have\nnot been designed to benefit the ordinary people. Instead, the\npolicies benefit only the political lords and their cronies,\nleaving the masses to make ends meet on whatever they\ncould find. Thus, politics in Nigeria has not created a level\nplaying field--it has not given the people a voice in govern-\nment. And this has opened the society up for constant social\nunrest. Consequently, like in every other developing country\nor sub-Saharan Africa, the people are not motivated to save\nand invest in the economy (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012).\nRelated to the politics and democracy is the issue of func-\ntional constitution. The political situation in Nigeria has not\nreally improved since the reprise of civilian government in\n1999 (after the long years of military rule). For one, the so-\ncalled civilian government is still using the constitution\ncrafted by the military and foisted on the people. This docu-\nment lacks true democratic principles; it has limitations on\nthe use of political power as well as the distribution of power\nin the society, and vests absolute power on the corrupt politi-\ncal leaders. With that, the political leaders can arbitrarily\ncancel or shift scheduled elections without any person\nblinking.\nThe 2015 national elections (presidential and national\nassembly elections) in Nigeria were conducted as resched-\nuled, and the elections and transition of power from the\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP)\u00adled government to All\nProgressives Congress (APC) went relatively peaceful.\nAlthough a new political leader, Muhammadu Buhari, has\nbeen sworn in, the APC-led government does not appear to\nbe fully operational yet and the Boko Haram (the militant\nIslamic group) onslaught in the society has not abated. In\nother words, the group is still bombing facilities, killing\nNigerians, and disrupting economic activities in their strong-\nholds in north-eastern part of the country. The question\nremains: Is Muhammadu Buhari the messiah Nigerians have\nbeen waiting for? This, in the author's opinion, is doubtful as\nhe does not seem to possess the political skills and knowl-\nedge to work with the national assembly and tackle the prob-\nlems facing the nation. Despite his campaign promises to\ntackle insecurity, corruption, and youth unemployment in the\ncountry, these challenges remain. The people want action,\nnot campaign rhetoric.\nHowever, the basic political structure created by the mili-\ntary remains and the mentality of the political leaders has not\nchanged. The political leaders took over power from the\nmilitary simply to continue with the absolute power structure\nit inherited from the military, or recreated a system worse\nthan the one it inherited from the military. Under this condi-\ntion it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the ordinary\nperson on the street to acquire political power to change the\nway the system works. Thus, without a true political trans-\nformation, the poor in the society will not even meet their\nbasic needs, not to mention challenging the system. For\nNigeria to develop as it should, the diverse ethnic, linguistic,\nand religious groups in the society must honestly come\ntogether to achieve a common purpose--that is to create a\npositive sociopolitical change for the benefit of every group.\nWithout this, the livelihood of the millions of ordinary\nNigerians who are stuck in abject poverty will not change\nand Nigeria will remain underdeveloped.\nIt is equally pertinent to emphasize that Nigeria has failed\nto develop as it should because of its skewed value system\nand social structure. Social structure, according to social sci-\nence literature, is the way a society is composed or orga-\nnized, including the \"social web of relations that regulate\nhuman interaction\" (Ferriss, 2006). The social structure and\nvalues of a society determine its economic system and wealth\ndistribution patterns, the effectiveness of its legal system and\npeople's quality of life (Ferriss, 2006). Also, the social and\neconomic conditions determine the people's attitude toward\npublic resources and their social values. Thus, values are\nconceptions that guide the way individuals act and react to\nissues, evaluate people and events, and explain their actions\nsocial values determine what people believe in (good or bad).\nHowever, values vary according to groups (religion, tribes,\nand ethnic groups). A person's (or an organization's) values\ndefine its \"structure and purpose\" and enable the individual\nor organization to determine what is important and meaning-\nful. Some people, however, believe that social structure\ndevelops naturally, while others think it is socially created by\nthe elites who seek to control the economic system or institu-\ntional structure of a society (Hoff, 2003).\nSocial and leadership values could either spur or retard\nthe pace of national development. Thus, some cultures are\nmore suitable than others for economic growth and develop-\nthe Protestant Work Ethic and the forces that led to the emer-\ngence of capitalism and competition. Because of their work\nethics, individuals in the Western world are believed to have\nbecome rich through hard work and invention, innovation,\ncreativity, and high productivity. The economic success of\nthe Asian Tigers have been attributed to their Confucian\nEthic or Value, which lays emphasis on hard work, loyalty\nand respect for authority, and of course, punctuality to work.\nWhether a society will develop or not depends largely on the\neffectiveness of its institutions and infrastructure. Nigeria\ncannot develop without advanced technological capability\ntion and increase individual and national productivity (Lewis,\n2004). This is to say that inclusive institutions will lead to the\nemergence of new technologies. Technological development\nis the engine that drives economic development (Sen, 1975)\nas it engenders creativity and innovation (Schumpeter, 1942),\nand thus economic growth and development.\nAs noted above, there is a large population and resources\nin Nigeria to be extracted because many of the village dwell-\ners lack the political power to demand their rights and revolt\nagainst the extractive institutions (Acemoglu & Robinson,\n2012) that are benefiting only those in the corridors of power\nand their cronies. This is among the major causes of Nigeria's\nunderdevelopment and the endemic corruption that leads to\nmoral laxity and lack of law and order. It is common knowl-\nedge that Nigeria lacks effective institutions, structures, pro-\ncedures to tame corruption. Today, any person in Nigeria\ncould \"become fabulously wealthy\" (Acemoglu & Robinson,\nincome and nobody blinks (see \"Before our politicians empty\nthe treasury,\" 2010). Public servants do not show up for work\non time and do not take their work seriously, and they expect\nto get paid every month without being productive. The men-\ntality that hard work and honesty does not pay (or is not\nproperly rewarded) has found its way into the school system\nas students do not take their studies seriously any longer. The\n\"I don't care attitude\" and the mentality to get rich through\nfraud often discourage the spirit of competition and hard\nwork, and thus, inhibit national development.\nNigeria lacks inclusive political and economic institutions\n2003) to ensure proper rights and to empower the people\nwith the skills and knowledge to realize their full potential.\nThe political leaders have created these extractive institu-\ntions to enrich themselves and their cronies leaving the\nmajority of the people to struggle for survival (Acemoglu &\nRobinson, 2012). This is one of the reasons for the incessant\nsocial unrests in the society, which have combined with the\nturbulent global economy and financial crisis to undermine\nthe people's ability to earn a living and improve their liveli-\nMany factors are retarding development and prosperity in\nNigeria. There is widespread social injustice in Nigeria; the\ngovernment rhetorically talks about the welfare of the needy\nand the growing number of jobless and sick people. But it\ndoes not provide them the tools to make a decent living;\nmajority of them survive by virtue of the traditional safety\nnet--the extended family system.As mentioned earlier, there\nare conflicting statistics about the rate of unemployment in\nNigeria: The Nigerian Labour Congress at some point esti-\nmated the unemployment rate to be 35% while the National\nBureau of Statistics report showed that about 10 million\nNigerians (about 20% of the entire labor force) were unem-\nployed as of March 2009. Recently, the World Bank reported\nthat more than 40 million Nigerians are unemployed (see\n\"Before Our Politicians Empty the Treasury,\" 2010). The\nunemployment figure, as pointed out above, has worsened,\nparticularly among the youth. How can a nation develop and\nprosper when the majority of the people are unemployed and\nswimming in the deep ocean of poverty?\nNigeria's social structure and skewed value system appear\nto have contributed to the failure of the many reforms agenda\nand visions in the society. In particular, the Vision 2020 and\nthe re-branding campaign embarked upon some years ago,\nwhich gulped a huge sum (but had nothing to show for it),\ncould have been invested on human capital and infrastruc-\ntural development to spur the economy and create employ-\nment. No society has become an industrialized nation without\ninvestment in human capital development, functional institu-\ntion and infrastructure, and particularly technology educa-\ntion. The Asian Tigers could not have become what they are\ntoday without investment in technological development\n(Mohan, 2003). Any person who thinks that Nigeria can be\ntransformed into an economic giant or power-house without\ntechnological capability must be living in a different planet.\nConcluding Remarks\nThis article seems, in the opinion of this author, to be a con-\nclusive overview of Leading From the Emerging Future and\nWhy Nations Fail as they relate to why Nigeria has failed to\ndevelop. Although additional study is needed, after reviewing\nthe change framework in these seminal books and the activi-\nties of political leaders, this writer can hazard to say that\nNigeria's leaders can learn a huge lesson from this impressive\nresearch on how to develop the society. This is because the\npolitical leaders who are trumpeting positive social change\nappear to have \"fixed mind-set,\" which has prevented them\nfrom adopting and implementing effective sociopolitical and\neconomic policies to transform the society. For instance, the\npolitical leaders are unable to shift their fixed mind-set\n(Dweck, 2007), to dismantle the nation's man-made extrac-\ntive political and economic institutions (Acemoglu &\nRobinson, 2012) that are inimical to Nigeria's economic\ngrowth and development. Effective institutions and infra-\nstructure are known as the foundation for a long-run eco-\nThat is the crux of the matter with Nigeria. If the leaders\ncannot change their mentality (Senge, 2006) or if they have\n\"fixed mind-set\" (Dweck, 2007), how would they create\neffective institutions and social structure to give the people a\nvoice in the political process? And how can they alter the\nquality of attention the people give to their own actions? As\nthe behavioral dimension of change espoused by the reviewed\nseminal research has noted, \"The quality of results produced\nby any system depends on the quality of awareness from\nwhich people in the system operate\" (Scharmer & Kaufer,\nConflicts over the sharing of resources have been perva-\nsive in the society. Given the poor state of affairs in the soci-\nety, the political leaders do not appear to be leading with\nintegrity. Most of them are not keeping their promises. Thus,\nNigeria's poor development appears to be caused by the poor\npolicies of the policymakers and ineffective institutions.\nHowever, to move forward, the politicians should shift their\nmental models (Senge, 2006), create inclusive institutions\n(Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012), and develop the courage,\npolitical will, and commitment to enthrone positive change\nin the society. They should also give the people a voice in the\npolitical process. The political leaders of Nigeria should,\ntherefore, create a unity of purpose and shared vision to\nmove the nation forward. The quality of a government, and\nthus that of its leadership, determines the quality of its\npolicies and how they enhance the quality of the lives of the\ncitizens.\nThe books have played a significant role in shaping this\nauthor's understanding of how to transform extractive politi-\ncal and economic institutions into inclusive ones to empower\nthe people and engender creativity, innovation, and national\ndevelopment. Currently, the education and health care deliv-\nery systems are not working, and the people are tired and\nhungry because the health of the economy is weak. The polit-\nical leaders are able to stuff their pockets with public money\nbecause the plethora of anticorruption measures instituted in\nthe society is not working. Many of them are not designed to\nwork; in fact, nothing works!\nTo prevent the rising discontent in the society from reach-\ning a boiling point, Nigeria needs a political leader with an\nopen mind, an open heart, and an open will (Scharmer, 2007,\ntransform the education and health care systems and invest in\nfunctionalinfrastructureandinclusiveinstitutions(Acemoglu\n& Robinson, 2012). All these will combine to empower the\npeople and enhance individual and national productivity,\nwithout which the nation will remain perpetually underde-\nveloped, with its attendant social unrest and political insta-\nbility. That, unfortunately, is the case with Nigeria.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D.
