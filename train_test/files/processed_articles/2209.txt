The mechanisms of\naction, subjective effects, and risk profile of the classical seroton-\nergic psychedelics distinguishes them from other drugs sometimes\nalso labeled \"hallucinogens\", such as entactogens, like methylen-\nedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) that act primarily\nat serotonin transporters, or dissociative anesthetics, like phency-\nclidine (PCP) or ketamine that act primarily at NMDA glutamate\nreceptors1.\nPrevalence data on psychedelic use in the US is often reported for\nLSD alone (ignoring psilocybin and mescaline), or for psychedelics\ngrouped together with PCP (popular in the 1970s), MDMA (popu-\nlar since the 1990s), and/or other \"hallucinogens\" (some older esti-\nmates of hallucinogen use even included cannabis, amphetamine,\nand cocaine as hallucinogenic drugs), or for use among teenagers\nbut not adults. Here, we present estimated lifetime prevalence of\npsychedelic use by age category using data from a large US popula-\ntion survey.\nMethods\nWe examined the estimated lifetime use of psychedelics by age\nbased on 2010 data of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health\n(NSDUH). Results are presented for males and females separately.\nWe counted participants as having any lifetime psychedelic use if\nthey reported ever using LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, or peyote.\nThe use of mescaline and peyote were combined into one category\nbecause mescaline is the active substance of the peyote cactus, but\npeyote use was also examined separately. Current age was only\navailable as a categorical variable. This study was exempt from\nreview by our Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics\nbecause all data are available in the public domain without any\nidentification of personal information.\nData source\nThe annual NSDUH survey provides estimates of substance use and\nmental health indicators from a randomly-selected sample repre-\nsentative of the US civilian non-institutionalized population aged\n12 and older. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (SAMHSA) of the US Department of Health and\nHuman Services is responsible for the NSDUH study design and\nmethods of assessment. Trained interviewers met the randomly-\nselected participants in their homes, and participants listened to\nrecorded questions via headphones and then entered their answers\ndirectly into a computer, providing a highly confidential and stand-\nardized setting. The response rate was approximately 78%. In addi-\ntion, approximately 10% of participants were excluded from the\npublic use data file, either because of excessive missing data on\ndrug use or because they were excluded at random in order to increase\nanonymity. The total number of respondents in the public use file\nwas 57,873. Detailed information on the sampling and data collec-\ntion methods, including interview instructions and questionnaires,\nconfidentiality and informed consent are available on the SAMHSA\nwebsite (http://oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh.htm).\nData analysis\nEstimates were calculated using the online Survey Documenta-\ntion Analysis from the Inter-university Consortium for Political\nCalculations of estimated population percentages and extrapolated\ntotal numbers of psychedelic users in the US took into account\nthe weights provided with the NSDUH public use data file. Vari-\nance estimates took into account the complex sample design of the\nNSDUH survey using Taylor series linearization. Respondents\nwith missing data on psychedelic use (less than 1% of the respond-\nents) were assumed to have no use.\nResults\nAn estimated 32 million (95% confidence interval (CI): 30 to\n33 million) US residents in 2010 reported lifetime use of LSD\nFigure 1 shows the rate of lifetime psychedelic use in the US in\n2010 by age category and gender. Lifetime rate of psychedelic use\namong people aged 50 to 64 years (the \"baby boomer\" generation)\nwas similar to the rate among people aged 21 to 49 years. Among\never using LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline, including 22% (95% CI:\nlence of psychedelic use was low among people aged 65 and older\nDiscussion\nPsychedelics continue to be widely used in the US. Common\nreasons given for using psychedelics include curiosity, mystical\nexperiences, and introspection3. Rates of lifetime psychedelic use\nare greater in males than in females. Overall rates of lifetime psy-\nchedelic use are roughly the same among the \"baby boomers\" and\nyounger adults. However, psilocybin was more common among\nyounger adults, while LSD and mescaline or peyote were more\ncommon among older adults. Use of psilocybin mushrooms has\nincreased since the 1970s in the US and worldwide, likely due\nto dissemination of simple home cultivation techniques, instruc-\ntions on finding wild mushrooms, and information about effects\nand methods of psilocybin mushroom use4. This was a retrospec-\ntive cross-sectional study. Self-reports of drug use behaviors could\nbe influenced by memory errors and under-reporting; however, a\nFigure 1.
