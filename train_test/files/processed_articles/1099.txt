Attention to\npsychiatric disorders is important when considering opi-\noid therapy.\nthe world, 5% to 35% of patients\nhave pain not associated with\ncancer that persists for at least 6\nmonths and is associated with dis-\nability or seeking health care.1 Between\noids at US outpatient visits for chronic\nmusculoskeletal pain doubled from 8% to\n16% of visits.2 This increase has been in-\nterpreted by some specialists as evidence\nof better treatment of unrelieved pain,3\nwhereas others have expressed concern\nabout the safety and effectiveness of long-\nterm opioid therapy for chronic noncan-\ncer pain.4\nPatients with mental disorders gener-\nally have been excluded from random-\nized trials to test the effectiveness of opi-\noidsforchronicnoncancerpain,butresults\nfrom observational studies suggest an as-\nsociation between mental disorders and in-\ncreased opioid use for chronic noncancer\npain.5-8 It has not been possible to deter-\nmine from these small or cross-sectional\nstudies whether this association is found\noutside of specialty pain clinic settings.

The HCC was a nationwide\ntelephone survey designed to track the effects of the changing\nhealth care system on individuals at risk for alcohol abuse, drug\nabuse, and mental health disorders. Study methods have been\ndescribed previously.9 The HCC respondents were a stratified\nprobability sample of participants in the Community Tracking\nStudy, a nationally representative survey of the US civilian popu-\nincludes a sample clustered within 60 randomly selected US com-\nmunities and a national sample. The first wave (HCC1) was con-\nfor HCC1, 9585 complete interviews were obtained, for a re-\nsponse rate of 64.0%. In HCC2, all HCC1 respondents were fol-\npleted interviews. We used sample weights designed by HCC\nstatisticians to adjust for the probability of selection, nonre-\nsponse to the 2001 HCC2 survey, and the number of house-\nholds in the Community Tracking Study survey that did not have\na telephone. We excluded respondents reporting cancer diag-\nnoses other than skin cancer within the past 3 years (n=132) to\nisolate noncancer pain. Those missing data for key variables\n(n=88; most often presence of arthritis [n=48] or health insur-\nance plan [n=33]) were also excluded, resulting in a sample of\n6439. Informed consent was obtained orally before the inter-\nview, and the study was approved by the institutional review\nboards at University of California at Los Angeles and RAND.\nVARIABLES\nDependent Variable\nThe HCC respondents were asked about all prescribed medica-\ntionsthattheyhadtaken\"atleastseveraltimesaweekforamonth\nor more\" in the past 12 months. Respondents were asked to read\nthe names of all their medications directly from their pill bottles\nto the interviewers. These medications were later grouped into\ntherapeutic categories by study staff. From these data, we con-\nstructed a dichotomous measure of regular prescription opioid\nuse of at least 1 month. A total of 350 individuals reported such\nregular opioid use at 1 or more time points. We sorted respon-\ndents into 4 groups on the basis of their HCC1 and HCC2 regu-\n(77.2%) confirmed use for at least 2 months. The strength of the\nassociation between common mental disorders and opioid use\nwas similar for this group confirming more long-term opioid use\nbut was somewhat larger. Although we do not have data on the\nreasons these opioids were prescribed, pain is the primary indi-\ncation for opioids, and only 10 respondents (4.2%) using opi-\noids in 2001 did not report a chronic pain condition or pain in-\nterference at that time.\nIndependent Variables\nOur model is based on the work of Andersen11 who posited that\naccess to medical treatment is a function of patient need, pre-\ndisposing factors, and enabling factors. We used several comple-\nmentary measures of physical health and chronic physical con-\nditions as measures of the need for opioid treatment. These\nmeasures included the Physical Component Summary\u00ad12, which\nisanaggregatemeasureofphysicalhealthfunctioning,andamea-\nsure of self-reported health (excellent, very good, good, fair, or\npoor), both from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form\u00ad\nchronic medical conditions. Our final models included the num-\nber of chronic conditions and those individual conditions asso-\nciated with opioid use (P.10): arthritis, chronic low back pain,\nchronic headaches, and other chronic pain conditions. We also\nincluded a dichotomized measure of pain interference with re-\nspondents' normal work (including work outside the home and\nhousework) derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Short\nForm\u00ad12 pain item (extremely/a lot vs moderately/a little bit/\nnot at all). All independent variables were from the 1998 wave.\nThe presence during the preceding 12 months of the men-\ntal disorders most commonly diagnosed and treated in pri-\nmary care (major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety\ndisorder, and panic disorder) was assessed by using short-\nform versions13 of the World Health Organization's Compos-\nite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),14 which is based\non the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Re-\nvised Third Edition.15 The CIDI is a fully structured interview\ndesigned to be administered by lay interviewers.\nProblem alcohol and drug use were assessed with common\nassessment tools. These scales do not exactly replicate Diagnos-\ntic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edi-\ntion diagnoses of substance abuse or dependence (eg, they lack a\ncleardeterminationoflossofcontroloveruse),soweusetheterms\nproblem alcohol use and problem drug use.

Problem use of prescription drugs was defined for\nthe respondent as use \"on your own, meaning without a doctor's\nprescription, or in larger amounts than prescribed, or for a longer\nperiod than prescribed.\" These questions thus captured a broader\ngroup than do classic substance abuse criteria.

In adjusted models, respon-\ndents with a mental health disorder in 1998 were twice\nas likely to use prescribed opioids in 2001. Respondents\nwith a mental health disorder who were not using opi-\noids in 1998 were more likely to initiate opioid use dur-\ning the 3-year follow-up. Although those with problem\ndrug use in 1998 were 3 times as likely to use prescribed\nopioids in 2001, this group is far smaller than the num-\nber of patients with common mental health disorders. In-\ndividuals receiving opioids long term also reported greater\nperceived need for mental health care but not substance\nabuse care. This association of mental disorders with in-\ncreased opioid use is consistent with results from our pre-\nvious cross-sectional analysis of a larger 1998 sample.8\nWhy are individuals with psychiatric disorders more\nlikely to use opioids long term? It is well known that de-\npression and anxiety disorders are associated with in-\ncreasedratesofpsychologicalandphysicalsymptoms.Pain\narisingfromchronicmedicaldisordersalsoisratedasmore\nsevere in the presence of major depression.20 One intrigu-\ning possibility is that opioids may be used to treat a poorly\ndifferentiated state of mental and physical pain. We be-\nlieve effects of mental disorder may be stronger for initia-\ntion than continuation of opioids because initiation may\nbe related more directly to patient distress, whereas con-\ntinuation also is determined by response to opioids, which\nmay be inhibited in those with depression.21\nOur findings are consistent with population-based evi-\ndence that unmet need for mental health care is associ-\nated with higher rates of substance use.22 There is also a\ncenturies' long history of opioids being used by physi-\ncians to treat depression and other mental disorders.23\nExogenous opioids elevate mood and endogenous opi-\noids modulate basal emotional state.24 Recent study re-\nsults suggest that treatment-resistant depression25 and ob-\nsessive-compulsive disorder26 may respond to opioid\n\u00a92006 American Medical Association.

Use and abuse of opioids appears to be com-\nmon in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder,\nborderline personality disorder, and other dissociative dis-\norders.27,28 However, evidence suggests the condition of\nthese individuals may deteriorate with opioid use,29,30 and\nthey may actually improve psychiatrically by using the\nopioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride.31 Al-\nthough substance abuse and major depression increase\nthe likelihood of using prescribed opioids, few data sup-\nport this use because patients with substance abuse and\nmajor depression have been excluded from most con-\ntrolled trials of opioids for chronic pain.32\nOur data suggest that diagnosis and treatment of psy-\nchiatricdisordersareimportantstepswhenconsideringpa-\ntients for opioid therapy. However, existing guidelines and\nconsensus statements concerning the use of opioids for\nchronic noncancer pain vary widely in their recommen-\ndations about depression and other psychiatric disorders.\nSome guidelines33,34 mention the importance of the assess-\nment of psychiatric disorders, but other guidelines35,36 and\nreviews37,38 makenomentionofpsychiatricdisorders.How-\never, adequate care for depression may improve chronic\npain, a finding suggested by results from a recent trial of\ncollaborative care for depression in older adults that dem-\nonstrated that arthritis pain intensity and pain interfer-\nence were reduced by improved treatment for depres-\nsion.39 Such depression treatment effects might reduce the\nneed for long-term analgesic therapy or permit shifting pa-\ntients to less addictive pain treatments than opioids.\nThe strengths of our study include the use of prospec-\ntive data from a large nationally representative sample\nof the general population, which avoids the selection bias\ncommon in the clinical samples in which opioid use has\nbeen studied to date and allows interpretation of our re-\nsults in terms of the national population. The HCC also\nuses the systematic and well-validated World Health Or-\nganization CIDI approach to psychiatric diagnosis. Fi-\nnally, the HCC provides extensive data about demo-\ngraphic and clinical covariates that could confound the\nrelationship between psychiatric disorders and opioid use.\nOur study has a number of limitations. First, the re-\nlation telephone surveys performed at that time. For ex-\nample, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System40\nhad a 63.5% response rate after determining household\nsurvey, nonresponders were more likely to be younger\nthan 30 years; to be of race other than white; to be black\nor Hispanic; to be single; to have less than a high school\neducation; to have an annual income less than $19 000;\nto not be insured; to have fair to poor general health; and\nto meet criteria for dysthymia, generalized anxiety, or\npanic disorder. Because these are many of the signifi-\ncant predictors of opioid use in 2001, their loss to fol-\nlow-up introduces a conservative bias to our findings. Sec-\nond, substance abuse disorders were assessed with\nabbreviated versions of the World Health Organization\nCIDI interview that did not fully document all the cri-\nteria needed for a drug abuse diagnosis. Third, there was\nno direct clinical observation of the study subjects. All\nassessments were conducted by telephone and rely on\nself-report. Physical health status was documented\nthrough a count of chronic conditions and the physical\ncomponent score of the Medical Outcomes Study Short\nForm\u00ad12. Fourth, subjects read the names of their opi-\noids from their pill bottles and verified that they were\ntaking them regularly, but we do not know why they were\nprescribed opioids or if they were abusing them. Fi-\nnally, this is an observational study from which it is not\npossible to derive unbiased data about the effects of opi-\noid use on clinical outcomes.\nOdds Ratio\nPrevalence\nDysthymia\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\nProblem Alcohol\nPanic\nProblem Drugs\nCommon Mental\nHealth Disorder\nFigure.
