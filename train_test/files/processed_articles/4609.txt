    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether MiR-30a regulates autophagy by regulating the Beclin-1\nprotein, which is the marker for autophagosomes during myocardial injury, when induced by angiotensin II (Ang II).\nMethods: We randomly assigned 20 rats into two equal groups: Control group and Ang II group. We detected the\nexpression of MiR-30a by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and we employed western blotting\nto detect the protein expression of Beclin-1.\nResults: In this study, we found that Ang II induced cardiomyocyte autophagy, together with down-regulation of MiR-\n30a and upregulation of the Beclin-1 protein. We also found that the Beclin-1 protein is regulated by MiR-30a, by\ntransferring a MiR-30a mimic or AMO-204 into the cardiomyocytes.\nConclusion: These studies provided evidence that MiR-30a plays an important role in regulating autophagy through the\nBeclin-1 protein, during myocardial injury induced by Ang II.\n",

Autophagy\nis a type of programmed cell death. It has been suggested\nto be essential for cellular homeostasis. It can determine\ncellular survival, together with apoptosis and necrosis.4,5\nAutophagy activity levels are very low in physiological\nconditions, and it is upregulated in many pathophysiologi-\ncal processes.6,7 Because cardiomyocytes are terminally-\ndifferentiated cells that cannot divide again, suitable\nautophagy is essential for the maintenance of cardiomyo-\ncyte homeostasis. So autophagocytic deficiencies or\nexcesses are associated with many cardiac pathologies,\nsuch as ischemia and heart failure. 8\u00ad10 It seems that mod-\nest levels of autophagy appear to be protective, while high\nlevels of autophagy may cause self-digestion and promote\nAutophagy is regulated by many autophagy-related\ngenes (Atgs), which are involved in autophagosome forma-\nis possible to control the process of autophagy by up-regu-\nlating or down-regulating microtubule-associated protein\nlight chain3 (LC3): The molecular mechanism for this\neffect has yet to be elucidated. As we know, it has been\ndemonstrated that microRNAs, which negatively regulate\nprotein expression in diverse biological and pathological\nprocesses, play an important role in myocardial injury.15\u00ad17\nRole of MiR-30a in cardiomyocyte\nautophagy induced by Angiotensin II\nJionghua Huang1, Chunlin Huang2, Yishan Luo2, Shiming Liu1\nand Ximing Chen1\n Keywords\nAnimal study, Beclin-1, angiotensin II, autophagosome, autophagy, cardiomyocytes, injury, MiR-30a, myocardial injury,\nprotein regulation, rats\nDepartment of Cardiology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou\nMedical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China\nDepartment of Cardiology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital,\nGuangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China\nAuthors Jionghua Huang and Chunlin Huang contributed equally to this\npaper.\nCorresponding author:\nXiming Chen, Department of Cardiology, the Third Affiliated Hospital\nof Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nIt was observed that many microRNAs regulate cell apop-\ntosis18\u00ad21; however, it is well known that when apoptosis is\nblocked, the cells that preferentially die by apoptosis, may\ndie by autophagy.22 So it is beneficial for cell survival if\nautophagy becomes inhibited, together with apoptosis. We\nfound that MiR-30a, which has an anti-apoptotic effect,\nmay also regulate Beclin-1 expression through the nine\ncomplementary bases, according to the bioinformatics of\nTargetscan. Thus, the present study was undertaken to see\nwhether MiR-30a was dysregulated by angiotensin II (Ang\nII), and if it may inhibit autophagy during hypoxia-reoxy-\ngenation, by regulating Beclin-1.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimal care\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Animal\nResearch Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Medical\nUniversity, Guangzhou, China. The investigation con-\nformed to the guide for the care and use of laboratory ani-\nmals published by the US National Institutes of Health\n(NIH). We randomly assigned 20 rats into two equal groups:\nControl group (Con group) and Ang II group (n = 10 each).\nLDH assay\nWe collected serum from blood after 180 min of reperfusion,\nfor determination of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.\nQuantitative real-time RT-PCR of MiR-30a\nTotal RNA of cells was isolated by using TRIzol reagent, and\nthenreversetranscribedaccordingtothemanufacturer'sinstruc-\ntions (Fermentas, Shanghai, China). The annealing temperature\nof miRNA-204 was set at 60\u00b0C. The comparative threshold\ncycle (Ct) method with the arithmetic formula (Equation (1))\nbelow was used to determine relative quantitation of gene\nexpression of both target and housekeeping genes (-actin):\nThe MiR-30a primers used in the study are shown in Table 1.\nWestern blot\nWe determined protein concentrations with the BCA pro-\ntein assay kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,\nUSA), according the manufacturer's protocol. Equal\namounts of protein (60 \u00b5g) from the cardiomyocytes were\nsubjected to Western blot analysis, to evaluate Beclin-1\nexpression with an ECL detection kit (Amersham\nBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Beclin-1 immunoreactivity\nwas detected using a rabbit antiserum specific for rat\nBeclin-1 protein (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as primary\nantibodies. Detection of antigen-antibody complex forma-\ntion was performed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-\nconjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The\nBeclin-1 concentrations were normalized with the values\nfor -actin concentration.\nStatistical analysis\nQuantitative data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error\n(SE). Statistical significance was determined using the T\ntest or 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); p < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nMyocardium injury was induced by Ang II\nThe extent of myocardial infarction was evaluated after\ninjury. Representative photographs of midventricular\ncross-sections of Evans blue and Triphenyltetrazolium\nchloride (TTC)-stained hearts were taken from the Control\nand Ang II groups. Infarct area (INF)/ area at risk (AAR)\nand LDH are shown in Figure 1.\nAng II decreased the expression of MiR-30a\nTo demonstrate the effect of Ang II on MiR-30a, we com-\npared the MiR-30a between the Con group and Ang II\ngroup (n = 10 each). Using RT-PCR, we found that Ang II\nsignificantly decreased MiR-30a (Figure 2).\nAng II up-regulated the protein level of Beclin-1\nAs a marker of autophagosomes, the protein level of\nBeclin-1 represents the amount of autophagosomes pre-\nsent; thus, we compared the ratio of Beclin-1/-actin\nbetween the control group and IR group. It has been\nreported that autophagy contributes to cell death when\napoptosis is inhibited, and sometimes the early stages of\nautophagy were required for apoptosis. Beclin-1 was the\nmarker of autophagosomes, so the ratio of Beclin-1/-actin\nTable 1. Primers used for quantitative real-time RT-PCR.\nType Name Sequence\nPCR: polymerase chain reaction.\nHuang et al. 3\ncould stand for the level of autophagy. In our study, we\nfound that Ang II up-regulated the protein expression of\nBeclin-1, together with increasing the ratio of the Ang II\ngroup (n = 10); and we found that Beclin-1 was enhanced\nby Ang II (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nAutophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway\nwidely existent within eukaryotic cells as a self-protection\nmechanism in response to harmful stimulation; and the\nfunctions of autophagy are not only to be involved in sur-\nrounding and isolating damaged organelles, but more\nimportantly, in transporting the surrounded materials to\nlysosomes for degradation, and thus to produce amino\nacids, ATP and other substances in order to maintain the\nenergy metabolism cycle of the body.\nAutophagy has attracted great interest because it is\ninvolved in many physiological processes. If autophagy\ndestroys the cytosol and organelles beyond a certain\nFigure 1.

Autophagy\nwas detrimental during reperfusion, although it protected\nthe cardiomyocytes during ischemia, as demonstrated by\nMatsui et al.23 and his autophagy cell. Thus, it would be\nbeneficial for revascularized hearts to find a method of\nregulating Beclin-1 expression. Non-coding RNAs regu-\nlate gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner:\nThey are endogenous regulators of gene expression, dem-\nonstrated to be involved in cardiac injury.\nAccording to the bioinformatics of Targetscan, MiR-\n30a, which has an anti-apoptosis effect, may regulate the\nexpression of Beclin-1. In our study, we found that Ang II\ncould down-regulate MiR-30a, together with up-regulat-\ning Beclin-1 protein. When a MiR-30a mimic was trans-\nferred into cardiomyocytes, Beclin-1 protein was\nattenuated; while Beclin-1 protein was up-regulated by\nAMO-204, which was concentration-dependent. But\nLC3-I was not regulated by MiR-30a, as was seen in the\nprevious study. These results demonstrated that MiR-30a\nmay regulate cardiomyocyte autophagy through Beclin-1,\nOur rat study results demonstrated that MiR-30a plays\nan important role by regulating the Beclin-1 protein during\nAng II damage, so it became possible to control the\nautophagy under a beneficial threshold by regulating\nMiR-30a expression, to protect cardiomyocytes against\ninjury induced by Ang II.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
