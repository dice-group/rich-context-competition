Here, we investigated the mechanism by which forced exercise attenuates the development\nand progression of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), an established animal model of Guillain\u00adBarre\n\u00b4 syndrome. Adult\nmale Lewis rats remained sedentary (control) or were preconditioned with forced exercise (1.2 km/day \u00c2 3 weeks) prior to\nP2-antigen induction of EAN. Sedentary rats developed a monophasic course of EAN beginning on postimmunization day\nexhibited a similar monophasic course but with significant (p <.05) reduction of disease severity. Analysis of popliteal\nlymph nodes revealed a protective effect of exercise preconditioning on leukocyte composition and egress. Compared\nwith sedentary controls, forced exercise preconditioning promoted a sustained twofold retention of P2-antigen responsive\nleukocytes. The percentage distribution of pro-inflammatory (Th\n1) lymphocytes retained in the nodes from sedentary EAN\nrats (5.1 \u00c6 0.9%) was significantly greater than that present in nodes from forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats\n(2.9 \u00c6 0.6%) or from adjuvant controls (2.0 \u00c6 0.3%). In contrast, the percentage of anti-inflammatory (Th\n2) lymphocytes\n(7\u00ad10%) and that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ($20%) remained unaltered by forced exercise preconditioning. These data do\nnot support an exercise-inducible shift in Th\n2 cell bias. Rather, preconditioning with forced exercise elicits a sustained\nattenuation of EAN severity, in part, by altering the composition and egress of autoreactive proinflammatory (Th\n1) lympho-\ncytes from draining lymph nodes.\n",

The protective effect of preconditioning was not\ndue to a shift in the Th\n2 cell bias but rather appears\nto be the result of altering autoreactive leukocytes com-\nposition and egress from secondary lymphoid tissue.\nMethods and Materials\nThis study was conducted using protocols approved by\nthe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in\naccordance with the principles of laboratory animal\nhoused three to a cage, allowed standard rat chow and\nwater ad libitum, and maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark\ncycle. Adult male Lewis rats (initial body weight 200 g;\nHarlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were randomly divided\ninto adjuvant control, sedentary, or forced-exercise inter-\nvention groups.\nForced Exercise Preconditioning\nTreadmill running is a well-established forced experimen-\ntal training method that elicits marked adaptations in\nrodents. Rats assigned to the forced-exercise precondi-\ntioned intervention group were acclimated (5-day training\nperiod) to a motorized treadmill (Exer 3/6 Open tread-\nmill, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Although\nequipped with a motivational shock grid, this treadmill\nfeature was not used in an effort to minimize stress-\ninduced physiological changes. Training involved a grad-\nual transition at a zero grade incline toward a constant\nday/rat) as previously described (Shankarappa et al.,\ntraining were run for 60 min/day \u00c2 5 days a week between\nRats assigned to the sedentary intervention group were\nallowed to explore an identically sized environment for\nthe same duration of time during the same time of day,\nbut without receiving an exercise challenge. Rats assigned\nto the adjuvant control group were housed in their home\ncages and received the same amount of handling. All rats\nwere weighed daily, and caloric balance between adju-\nvant, sedentary, and forced-exercise preconditioned rats\nwas not monitored. Although all three groups of rats\nsteadily gained body weight throughout this study,\nrats undergoing forced exercise gained weight at\n2 ASN Neuro\na reduced rate compared with sedentary control rats\n(Calik et al., 2012). At no time prior to EAN induction,\nhowever, did forced-exercise preconditioned rats exhibit a\nfrank loss of body weight. Relative changes in muscle\nmass or adrenal gland weights were not determined.\nEAN Induction\nFollowing a 3-week training regimen, sedentary and\nforced-exercise preconditioned rats were actively induced\nwith EAN as previously described (Sarkey et al., 2007;\nCalik et al., 2012). Rats were anesthetized with ketamine\nprepared fine-particle emulsion (1:1 v/v) containing\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University,\nBoston, MA, USA) suspended in sterile saline and incom-\nplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma\u00adAldrich) supplemented\nwith 10 mg/ml heat-inactivated Mycobacteria tuberculosis\n(strain H37Ra; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA)\nwas injected into the left hind footpad. Inactive adjuvant\ncontrol rats were injected in the same way except neur-\nitogenic P2 peptide was omitted.\nAll rats were scored daily for EAN development and\nprogression by investigators blinded to group assignment.\nThe severity of clinical signs was scored as follows: 0 \u00bc no\nsymptoms; 1 \u00bc flaccid tail; 2 \u00bc abnormal gait; 3 \u00bc mild para-\nparesis; 4 \u00bc severe paraparesis; 5 \u00bc paraplegia. Intermediate\nclinical signs were scored in increments of 0.5.\nAt peak of disease, sciatic nerves from sedentary or\nforced-exercise preconditioned rats were harvested and\nprepared for qualitative histopathological evaluation as\npreviously described (Sarkey et al., 2007).\nLeukocyte Function Studies\nP2-antigen-specific proliferation and cytokine production\nassays were performed as we have previously described\n(Sarkey et al., 2007). Adjuvant control, sedentary, or\nforced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats were sacrificed\nasphyxiation at either onset (Day 14) or peak\n(Day 18) of disease, and secondary lymphoid tissue\n(spleens and popliteal lymph nodes) was harvested.\nPrepared splenic or nodal lymphocytes were cultured at\nan initial density of 2.0 \u00c2 106 cells/ml in Roswell Park\nMemorial Institute-1640 media supplemented with 9%\nheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mM 2-mercap-\ntoethenol, 90 U/ml penicillin, and 90 mg/ml streptomycin.\nCells were cultured in the absence or presence of P2 anti-\nstimulation, 0.5 mCi of [3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol; MP\nBiomedicals, USA) was added to each well. Labeled cells\nwere harvested by trypsinization and [3H]thymidine\nincorporation into the splenic or nodal lymphocyte\nDNA was determined using a Tri-Carb 2810 liquid\nscintillation analyzer (Perkin Elmer, USA). Cell culture\nsupernatants from parallel nonradiolabeled assays were\ncollected at 96 h and analyzed for the presence of inter-\nferon-g (IFN-g), TNF-a, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10. The con-\ntent of cytokines released into culture media was\nquantified simultaneously using multiplex technology\nwith the Bio-plexTM system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nInc., Hercules, CA, USA) and a commercially available\nrat cytokine Milliplex kit (Millipore, USA).\nFlow Cytometry\nSpleens or popliteal lymph nodes were harvested, and\ntrunk blood was collected (in 5 mM EDTA), at onset\n(Day 14) or peak (Day 18) of disease from adjuvant con-\ntrol, sedentary, or forced-exercise preconditioned EAN\nrats. To determine the relative (percent) abundance of\nhelper (Th\n) and cytotoxic (Tc\n) T lymphocytes retained in\nthese secondary lymphoid tissues, 1 \u00c2 106 splenocytes,\nnodal, or circulating leukocytes were co-incubated for\n30 min at 4C with 1 mg each of fluorescein isothiocyanate\n(FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD4 (clone W3/25) and\nphycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD8a\n(clone G28) monoclonal antibodies (BioLegend, USA).\nThe abundance of Th\n1 lymphocytes or activated Tc\nlymphocytes was determined by co-incubating prepared\nsplenocytes, nodal, or circulating leukocytes with 1 mg\neach of FITC-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD4 (clone W3/\n25) or PE-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD8a (clone G28)\nmonoclonal antibody together with 1 mg of rabbit anti-rat\ncocyanin (APC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H \u00fe L)\nsecondary antibody.\nThe abundance of Th\n2 lymphocytes was determined by\nco-incubating prepared splenocytes, nodal, or circulating\nleukocytes with 1 mg each of FITC-conjugated mouse\nanti-rat CD4 (clone W3/25) and PE-conjugated hamster\nCo-immunostained lymphocytes were washed twice\nwith ice-cold bovine calf serum (5% in phosphate buffer\nsaline) and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffered (pH\n7.4) 4% paraformaldehyde. After 10 min, fixed cells were\nwashed twice and resuspended in serum-supplemented\nphosphate buffer saline. Data were collected using a\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Canto flow\ncytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and\nanalyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., USA).\nLymphocytes were gated according to their forward and\nside scatter. In all cases, isotype controls were used to\nquantify and correct for background fluorescence.\nStatistical Analysis\nData are expressed as mean \u00c6 SEM of N observations\nunless otherwise specified. Statistical significance between\nCalik et al. 3\nnonparametric clinical data was determined using a\nMann\u00adWhitney nonparametric U test. Analysis of mul-\ntiple variable parametric data was determined using\neither one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-\nway repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey's or\nBonferonni's post hoc analysis, as indicated. In all\ncases, p < .05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nForced Exercise Preconditioning Attenuates the\nSeverity of EAN\nFollowing a 3-week regimen of sedentary- or forced exer-\ncise preconditioning, P2-immunized rats exhibited a\nmonophasic course of moderate to severe paraparesis\nthat is characteristic of EAN (Sarkey et al., 2007; Calik\net al., 2012). Sedentary rats exhibited onset of EAN\nBy comparison, forced-exercise preconditioned rats\nexhibited a similar monophasic disease course, with\nonset beginning on postimmunization day 12.6 \u00c6 0.2\nAlthough forced exercise preconditioning did not signifi-\ncantly alter the monophasic course of EAN, disease\nseverity in these rats was significantly less than that\nobserved in sedentary EAN rats (Figure 1(a)), consistent\nwith our previously reported findings (Calik et al., 2012).\nIn contrast, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) only-\nimmunized control rats (adjuvant control animals) did\nnot develop EAN (Figure 1(a)).\nDespite having access to water and food ad libitum, sed-\nentary EAN rats lost approximately 15% of their postim-\nmunization day-10 body weight, consistent with this well-\nestablished measure of onset and progression of EAN.\nSimilarly, the body weights of forced-exercise precondi-\ntioned EAN rats also decreased with disease progression,\nalbeit to a significantly lesser degree (Figure 1(b)).\nAdjuvant control rats, by comparison, did not exhibit\nweight loss during the course of the study (Figure 1(b)).\nIn good agreement with our previous reported findings\n(Sarkey et al., 2007), sciatic nerves harvested at peak of\ndisease from sedentary EAN rats exhibited marked histo-\npathological evidence of edema, inflammatory infiltrates,\nmyelin ovoids, and axonal damage (Figure 1(c), left\npanel). In contrast, forced-exercise preconditioned EAN\nrats exhibited qualitatively less histopathological evi-\ndence of peripheral nerve injury (Figure 1(c), right panel).\nForced Exercise Preconditioning Promotes Retention\nof Leukocytes in Popliteal Lymph Nodes\nTo examine whether forced exercise preconditioning\nattenuates EAN severity by altering nodal egress of\nautoreactive lymphocytes, popliteal lymph nodes from\nsedentary or forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats\nwere harvested and retention of total and P2-responsive\nleukocytes quantified (Figure 2). Although the total\nnumber of leukocytes retained in popliteal nodes from\nsedentary EAN rats was not significantly different from\nadjuvant controls, forced-exercise preconditioned EAN\nrats exhibited a marked twofold increase in total nodal\ncells recovered at either onset or peak of disease\n(Figure 2(a)). In contrast, forced exercise preconditioning\ndid not alter the retention of splenic leukocytes (spleno-\ncytes, data not shown).\nForced Exercise Preconditioning Preserves P2-\nAntigen Responsiveness of Nodal Leukocytes\nNodal leukocytes recovered at disease onset from seden-\ntary EAN rats proliferated robustly to P2-antigen stimu-\nlation (Figure 2(b)). In contrast, P2-responsiveness of\nnodal leukocytes harvested at peak of disease from sed-\nentary EAN rats was significantly (p < .05) blunted\n(Figure 2(b)). By comparison, nodal leukocytes harvested\nfrom forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats at either\nonset or peak of disease retained their proliferative\nresponsiveness to P2 antigen (Figure 2(b)).\nNodal leukocytes harvested at disease onset from exer-\ncise-preconditioned rats exhibited constitutive IL-2\nrelease (98 \u00c6 30 pg/ml, N \u00bc 5) that was similar to leuko-\ncytes from sedentary (79 \u00c6 20 pg/ml, N \u00bc 5) or adjuvant\n(85 \u00c6 36 pg/ml, N \u00bc 5) control rats.

In\nmarked contrast, nodal leukocytes harvested from\nforced-exercise preconditioned rats at peak of disease\nretained their P2-antigen responsiveness (Figure 4(a)\nand (b)).\nForced Exercise Preconditioning Does Not Alter\nTh\n2 Bias in EAN\nThe ratio of Th\n2 CD4\u00fe lymphocytes retained in\nlymphoid tissue harvested from sedentary or forced-exer-\ncise preconditioned EAN rats was determined by flow\ncytometric analysis. Although forced exercise precondi-\ntioning elicited an increase in total leukocyte retention\nin popliteal lymph nodes (Figure 2), the percentage dis-\ntribution of single-gated CD4\u00fe (Th\n) or CD8\u00fe (Tc\n)\nlymphocytes recovered from the popliteal lymph nodes\nof forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats was statistic-\nally indistinguishable from the nodes of sedentary EAN\nrats or adjuvant controls (Tables 1 and 2).

In contrast, the distribution of Th\ncytes present in nodes harvested at disease onset from\nforced-exercise preconditioned rats was similar to that\nof adjuvant controls (Table 1). A qualitatively similar\neffect of forced exercise preconditioning was seen with\nTh\n1 lymphocytes recovered from nodes at peak of disease\n(Table 2) or from spleen (data not shown). The distribu-\ntion of Th\n2 lymphocytes (7\u00ad10%) and that of cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes ($20%) present in nodes (Tables 1 and 2)\nor spleen (data not shown) from EAN rats was similar to\nthat of adjuvant controls and remained unaltered by\nforced exercise preconditioning.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we show that preconditioning with forced\nexercise elicits a novel and sustained attenuation of EAN,\nin part, by altering the composition and egress of auto-\nreactive pro-inflammatory (Th\n1) lymphocytes from drain-\ning popliteal lymph nodes. Compared with sedentary\ncontrols, forced exercise preconditioning promoted a sus-\ntained twofold retention of P2-antigen-responsive leuko-\ncytes within popliteal lymph nodes. The percentage\ndistribution of Th\n1 lymphocytes retained in nodes from\nsedentary EAN rats was significantly greater than that\npresent in nodes from forced-exercise preconditioned\nEAN rats or that of adjuvant controls. An exercise-indu-\ncible shift in Th\n2 cell bias, however, is not supported\nas the percentage of anti-inflammatory (Th\n2) lymphocytes\nand that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes remained unaltered\nby forced exercise preconditioning.\nPreviously, we reported that forced exercise (treadmill\nrunning, 1.2 km/day \u00c2 6 weeks) administered to adult\nmale Lewis rats prior to and during the development of\nEAN (an established CD4\u00fe T-cell dependent rat model of\nhuman inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies)\naffords a novel measure of protection against the devel-\nopment of autoimmune-associated deficits in peripheral\nnerve function (Calik et al., 2012).

This, however, produces localized inflamma-\ntion that hinders any subsequent physical activity. We\ntherefore designed this study to determine the effect of\nexercise preconditioning on development and progression\nof subsequently induced EAN. Although forced-exercise\npreconditioning did not alter the course of EAN, disease\nseverity was significantly less than that seen with sedentary\ncontrols. While physical exercise is often advocated as a\nsafe and effective adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the\nmanagement of a variety of seemingly diverse disorders,\nthis is the first report to our knowledge that shows exercise\npreconditioning eliciting a sustainable protective effect\nagainst the development of EAN, a well-established\nexperimental model of an autoimmune inflammatory neu-\nrodegenerative disease.\nEarlier studies suggest that physical exercise may pro-\ntect against subacute or chronic inflammation by actively\nsuppressing pro-inflammatory innate (Lancaster et al.,\nimmune responses. In general, a pro-inflammatory (Th\nadaptive immune response is a subsequent acute phase\nreaction to an inciting antigen/pathogen. By comparison,\nan anti-inflammatory (Th\n2) adaptive immune response\nserves as a countermeasure to limit Th\n1 responses and\nthereby facilitate recovery. Exercise may suppress pro-\ninflammatory immune responses by enhancing anti-\ninflammatory adaptive immunity (McFarlin et al.,\n2006). However, findings from this study do not support\na measurable exercise-inducible shift in Th\n2 cell bias.\nAlternatively, exercise preconditioning may elicit a\nsustainable protective effect by altering immune function\nthrough the activation of the sympathetic nervous system\n(Bellinger et al., 2008). In response to elevated levels of\ncatecholamines, acute stressors such as exercise produce a\nprofound, albeit transient, lymphocytosis (Martina et al.,\nTable 2.

Lymphocytes present in popliteal lymph nodes harvested at onset of disease\nfrom sedentary or forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats were selected by gating according to their forward and side scatter and Th\n1 subsets subse-\nquently quantified by co-staining with fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies to cell surface markers CD4 and CD212, as indicated. In all cases, isotype\ncontrols were used to quantify and correct for background fluorescence.\n8 ASN Neuro\n1990). Mobilization of T lymphocytes from their sites of\nlymphopoiesis, traversing the blood stream, with subse-\nquent trafficking into and egress from secondary lymph-\noid organs is well defined and utilizes a range of ligands\nand receptors (Springer, 1994; von Andrian and Mackay,\n2000). In this study, exercise preconditioning uniquely\nelicited a sustained increase in total leukocyte retention\nwithin popliteal lymph nodes. Exercise-retained nodal\nleukocytes harvested at onset of disease responded simi-\nlarly to sedentary controls, proliferating in response to\nP2-antigen stimulation and releasing measurable quanti-\nties of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.\nAt onset of EAN, nodal leukocytes from exercise-\npreconditioned rats responded to P2-antigen stimulation\nby markedly enhancing IL-10 release. These findings, in\nisolation, are consistent with an exercise-inducible pro-\ntective shift toward an anti-inflammatory (Th\n2) adaptive\nimmune response. Exercise preconditioning, however, did\nnot alter P2-antigen-stimulated release of IL-6, TNF-a,\nor IFN-g from nodal leukocytes harvested at disease\nonset, suggesting that autoreactive Th\n1 responsiveness\nwas preserved. Not surprisingly, P2-responsiveness of\nnodal leukocytes harvested from sedentary rats at peak\nof disease was negligible and consistent with anergy-asso-\nciated recovery. Unexpectedly, however, nodal leukocytes\nharvested at peak of disease from exercise-preconditioned\nrats retained their ability to respond to P2 antigen stimu-\nlation. Exercise preconditioning appears to have spared\nthese autoreactive leukocytes from undergoing anergic\nsilencing.\nAlthough a measurable exercise-inducible shift in\nTh\n2 cell bias is unlikely, a modest increase in the\npercentage distribution of retained T helper (Th\nlymphocytes could be appreciated at EAN onset.\nHowever, this change was not statistically significant.\nThe average (pooled) percentage distribution of leuko-\ncytes retained in popliteal lymph nodes from both seden-\ntary and forced-exercise conditioned EAN rats consisted\nCD8\u00fe (cytotoxic) lymphocytes. Subset analysis of\nretained CD4\u00fe lymphocytes harvested at disease onset\nfrom sedentary EAN rats, however, revealed a statistic-\nally significant increase in the percentage of pro-inflam-\n1) lymphocytes. Qualitatively\nsimilar increases in the percentage distribution of Th\nlymphocytes were observed in the blood of sedentary\nEAN rats. By comparison, preconditioning with forced\nexercise limited EAN-induced increases in nodal and cir-\nculating Th\n1 lymphocytes without altering the percentage\ndistribution of retained or circulating Th\n2 lymphocytes or\nactivated cytotoxic (Tc\n) lymphocytes. While these find-\nings are consistent with EAN being predominantly a\nTh\n1 cell-mediated autoimmune peripheral nerve disorder,\nthe pathogenesis of Guillain-Barre\n\u00b4 Syndrome (GBS) most\nlikely involves an imbalance between pro-inflammatory\n(Th\n17) and anti-inflammatory (Th\n2, T regulatory)\nsubsets of CD4\u00fe T cells (Zhang et al., 2013). In our\nhands, the percentage distribution of Th\nlymphocytes retained in popliteal lymph nodes of EAN\nrats was negligible (data not shown). Given previous find-\nings showing a selective role of regulatory T lymphocytes\nin EAN recovery (Zhang et al., 2009), the distribution of\nTregs at EAN onset and peak was not evaluated in this\nstudy.\nWhile the molecular basis for these observations\nremains unclear, exercise-induced activation of sympa-\nthetic noradrenergic responses may alter nodal egress of\neffector T-cells (Novotny and Kliche, 1986). More\nrecently, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors have\nemerged as key regulators of lymphocyte egress. S1P\nreceptor activation elicits marked immunosuppression\nby sequestering effector T lymphocytes within draining\nlymph nodes (Rosen et al., 2003). In vivo application of\nthe prodrug FTY720, a S1P analog, attenuates the devel-\nopment and severity of EAN (Papadopoulos et al., 2010;\nreported to reduce the nodal content of Foxp3\u00fe lympho-\ncytes while increasing the appearance of circulating\nFoxp3\u00fe lymphocytes in rats recovering from EAN\n(Zhang et al., 2009). Interestingly, physical exercise is\nreported to increase plasma levels of S1P (Baranowski\nthat forced exercise preconditioning elicits protection by\nenhancing S1P-mediated mobilization of regulatory T\ncells. Further studies are required to determine whether\nexercise preconditioning limits egress of functionally\ncompetent effector T cells while mobilizing regulator T\ncells from draining lymph nodes in response to elevated\nplasma levels of S1P.\nHere, we report that preconditioning with forced exer-\ncise elicits a sustained attenuation of EAN severity, in\npart, by attenuating egress of functionally competent\nautoreactive pro-inflammatory lymphocytes without sig-\nnificantly altering Th\n2 cell bias. An unexpected obser-\nvation was the ability of exercise preconditioning to delay\nor prevent silencing of retained autoreactive leukocytes.\nWhile exercise-induced immunosuppression may repre-\nsent a sustainable adjunctive therapeutic intervention\nfor the management of inflammatory disorders, add-\nitional experimental and phase studies are required to\nelucidate mechanistic causality and clinical efficacy.\n"
