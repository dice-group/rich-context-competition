Kafai3\n2Division of Nutrition, School of Health Professions, College of Health and Human Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta,\n Introduction\nSince 1 January 1998, all processed cereals in the United States\nhave been fortified with folic acid at the level of 140 mg/100 g\nof food (1) in response to the Public Health Service's recom-\nmendation that all women of child-bearing age should consume\n400 mg/d of folic acid to reduce the risk of having a child with\nneural tube defect (2). The actual increase in folic acid intake is\nmore than the predicted intake of 100 mg/d (3,4), because several\nfortified foods contained higher amounts of folic acid than the\nFDA mandated (5). There is a concern that some individuals\nmay be consuming more folic acid than the upper intake level of\n1000 mg/d (6). Overall, folic acid fortification resulted in a\nsignificant improvement in serum folate concentrations (7\u00ad11).\nAfter an initial dramatic increase in serum folate following folic\nacid fortification, the serum folate concentrations have recently\nmodestly but significantly decreased (7,8) due to the decreased\nintakes of folic acid (12).\nIn addition to a reduction in neural tube defects (13), one\nimportant benefit of mandated folic acid fortification is de-\ncreased total homocysteine (tHcy)4 concentrations (7\u00ad9,14).\nEvidence from clinical and epidemiological studies suggests that\nelevated tHcy in the circulation is linked to increased risk for\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) (15,16) and decreased cognitive\nfunction (17) and bone mineral density (18,19). It is not known\nwhether increased circulating tHcy leads to the development of\nCVD or vice versa.\nHomocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing, nonessential amino\nacid formed from the demethylation of methionine.

In transsulfuration,\npyridoxine is used as a coenzyme (24,25).

The\nassociation between tHcy and serum cotinine, a measure of\ncigarette smoking, BMI, and methylmalonic acid (MMA), a\nmeasure of cobalamin deficiency, has received little attention.\nThe majority of studies have focused on the determinants\nof tHcy based on the data collected during the pre-folic acid\nlation studies on the determinants of tHcy have focused on\nfolate. Because tHcy concentrations are significantly lower since\nthe years after the folic acid fortification (7,9,14), it is important\nto identify the determinants of tHcy concentrations in the post-\nfolic acid fortification period. Therefore, the objective of this\nstudy was to investigate the relation between plasma tHcy\nconcentrations and demographic, lifestyle, and health factors\nand concentrations of circulating B vitamins and MMA in the\npost-folic acid fortification period.\nMaterials and Methods\nSurvey description and study sample. The National Center for\nHealth Statistics (NCHS) of the CDC conducts NHANES on civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized residents of the US. NHANES were designed to be a\ncomplex, stratified, multistage probability sample survey. Demographic,\nsocioeconomic, dietary, and health related data were collected in the\nparticipants' homes as part of the household interview. A physician-\nadministered examination was conducted with household interviewed\npersons in mobile examination centers (MEC). In NHANES, young\nchildren, older persons, non-Hispanic black (NHB), and Mexican\nAmerican/Hispanic (MA/H) were oversampled to yield reliable estimates\nfor these groups. Beginning in 1999, NHANES were conducted as con-\ntinuous, annual surveys rather than the periodic surveys. The NHANES\nprotocols were reviewed and approved by the NCHS Institutional\nReview Board and all individuals gave their informed consent prior to\nparticipation.\nindividuals (all were home interviewed; 9282 were examined in MEC);\nMEC). The detailed description of survey methodologies and analytical\nguidelines has been described earlier (37\u00ad39).\nIn the data analysis, pregnant women (n \u00bc 760); individuals who\nreported their race/ethnicity as ``unknown'' or other than non-Hispanic\nwhite (NHW), NHB, or MA/H (n \u00bc 642); and individuals with missing\ndata for sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (BP),\ndiastolic BP, vitamin/mineral supplement use, RBC folate, and concen-\ntrations of serum creatinine, cotinine, folate, cobalamin, and MMAwere\nexcluded. After applying the above exclusion criteria, the study sample\nMeasurements. NCHS collected data on body measurements, demog-\nraphy, physical function, health condition, lifestyle behaviors, biochemical\nmeasurements of blood and urine, and diet intake depending on the age of\nthe participant. Blood was collected from venipuncture in the MEC\naccording to the standard protocols. Of 16,254 participants, ;62% (n \u00bc\non the length of fasting was missing for 13 participants. Length of fasting\nhad no measurable effect on the circulating tHcy (32). Whole blood was\ncollected into EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 2900 3 g; 10 min at\n4\u00ad8\u00b0C (V6500; Hamilton Bell) to yield plasma. Plasma tHcy concentra-\ntions were determined using an immunoassay (Abbott Imx for NHANES\nLaboratories,). A crossover study showed an excellent correlation between\nconcentrations in serum and RBC folate in whole blood hemolysate\nsample were measured using Quantaphase II radioassay kit (Bio-Rad\nLaboratories). Serum MMA was measured using GC/MS. Serum creat-\ninine was measured using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi Model 917 for\n2004). Serum cotinine was measured using isotope dilution-HPLC/\natmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem MS. The detailed\nmethodology on laboratory procedures is described elsewhere (40\u00ad42).\nBP was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer (W A Baum)\naccording to the standardized protocol recommended by the AHA (43).\nIndividuals who took vitamin/mineral supplements 1 mo before the\nsurvey were categorized as supplement users. Serum cotinine was used as\na measure of intensity of smoking. Serum cotinine concentration was\ncorrelated with the number of cigarettes smoked (44). Sex, race/ethnicity,\nage, BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, vitamin/mineral supplement use, RBC\nfolate, and concentrations of serum creatinine, cotinine, folate, cobala-\nmin, and MMAwere selected as potential variables that would be related\nto plasma tHcy concentrations in the post-folic acid fortification period.\nStatistical analysis. SUDAAN statistical software (SUDAAN for\nWindows, version 8.0.2, Research Triangle Institute) was used to\naccount for complex survey design. In data analysis, sample weights,\nprimary sampling units, and stratification variables were considered to\naccount for differential probabilities of selection and adjustments for\nnoncoverage and nonresponse bias per the NCHS guidelines. Also, we\nused SAS (SAS for Windows, version 8.0, SAS Institute) in conjunction\nwith SUDAAN to manage and analyze data files.\nrized as 85 y to protect the confidentiality of survey participants. These\nindividuals were excluded from the analysis so that age could be used as\na continuous variable. Because of nonnormality distribution of plasma\ntHcy, natural logarithmic transformation was used in the analysis to\nsatisfy the requirement for normality. Standard errors were estimated\nwith Taylor Linearization method, which takes NHANES complex\nsurvey design into consideration.\nThe significant difference between men and women in selected\ncharacteristics was determined with 2-tailed t tests. We used multivariate\nlinear regression to evaluate the simultaneous effects of selected pre-\ndictors of plasma tHcy on plasma tHcy. Plasma tHcy concentrations\nwere determined for sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, systolic and diastolic\nBP, supplement use, serum and RBC folates, and serum cotinine,\ncreatinine, cobalamin, and MMA variables. All continuous predictor\nvariables except age were divided into quartile cutoff points. Quartile\ngroups within the variable did not yield equal sample size because of the\nspecific cutoff values used in defining the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles\nfor the described variable. Age was classified into 4 categories: ,20 y,\nthe sex-, race/ethnicity\u00ad, and age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted\nmeans for plasma tHcy concentrations. A pairwise comparison between\ncategories within the variable was made using a 2-tailed, unpaired t test\nafter testing the hypothesis with ANCOVA.\nAdditionally, we performed a multivariate regression analysis\nbetween plasma tHcy and continuous variables (age, BMI, systolic and\ndiastolic BP, serum and RBC folates, and serum cobalamin, MMA,\ncotinine, and creatinine,). Because of the lack of causal relation between\ntHcy and MMA, 2 multivariate regression models were constructed, one\nwith serum cobalamin but without serum MMA and the other with\nserum MMA but without serum cobalamin. We also calculated Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients between plasma tHcy and continuous variables.\nSignificance was set at P , 0.05.\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study population are presented (Table 1).\nThe study sample consisted of ;51% men, ;49% women,\nthan men consumed vitamin/mineral supplements. Based on\nserum cotinine concentrations, more men than women were\ncategorized as smokers. Women were slightly but significantly\nolder than men. BMI did not differ between the sexes. Systolic\nand diastolic BP and concentrations of serum creatinine and\ncotinine were significantly higher in men than in women and\nconcentrations of serum and RBC folates and serum cobalamin\nwere significantly higher in women than in men. Serum MMA\nconcentrations did not differ between women and men.\nUnadjusted and multivariate-adjusted plasma tHcy concen-\ntrations for sex, age, and race/ethnicity are presented (Table 2).\nUnadjusted plasma tHcy was ;18.4% higher in men than in\nwomen. After adjustment for several covariates, the tHcy was\n;9.7% higher in men than in women. Multivariate-adjusted\ntHcy was higher (;5.0%) in NHW than in NHB and MA/H, but\nNHB and MA/H did not differ in plasma tHcy.

Concatenating the 3 surveys\ninto 1 analytic data file resulted in a large sample size that not\nonly allowed us to use several covariates in the regression\nmodeling but also increased the precision of the estimate.

Serum folate was a\nweak determinant of tHcy.\nMultivariate-adjusted plasma tHcy was ;0.73 mmol/L\ngreater in men than in women. Given the differences in folate\nand cobalamin status, vitamin/mineral supplements use, and\nserum creatinine and cotinine concentrations between men and\nwomen, it was expected that men would have higher tHcy than\nwomen. After adjustment for these variables, the difference in\ntHcy between men and women persisted, suggesting metabolic\ncauses for the differences in tHcy between men and women. In\nmen, the renal cystathionine b synthase activity is significantly\nlower than in women, leading to higher tHcy. The renal\ncystathinone synthase is a testosterone-dependant enzyme that\nconverts Hcy to cysteine in transsulfuration pathway (45).\nAge is a significant determinant of plasma tHcy in the post-\nfortification period after considering several covariates in the\nmultivariate model. The tHcy concentrations are significantly\nlower across the age groups in the postfortification period\ncompared with the prefortification period (27). The extent of\ndecrease in circulating tHcy from pre- to postfortification period\nis by and large similar across the age groups. For example, in the\nNHANES 19991, caution should be used in comparing the data\nacross the NHANES. In this study, plasma tHcy in the $60-y-old\nage group was ;3.5 mmol/L greater than in the ,20-y-old age\ngroup. Age-related increase in tHcy is unrelated to folate status,\nbecause serum folate and RBC folates are significantly higher in\nolder persons compared with younger persons (7). Age-related\nincrease in circulating tHcy is due to multiple causes. These\ninclude age-dependent decrease in enzymes that metabolize\nHcy (46), declined renal function (47), and increased cobalamin\ndeficiency due to malabsorption of cobalamin by the aging\nIn the postfortification period, race/ethnicity was a significant\ndeterminant of plasma tHcy. Although the folic acid fortification\nresulted in a significant increase in folate status (7\u00ad11) and\ndecrease in tHcy (7,9,14), race/ethnicity disparities exist in\nplasma tHcy concentrations in the US. In this study, multivariate-\nadjusted plasma tHcy was significantly higher (5.3% or\n;0.4 mmol/L) in NHW than in NHB. This is despite higher\nfolate status in NHW compared with NHB (7). This can be\nexplained by lower serum cobalamin concentrations and an\nincreased prevalence of MTHFR polymorphism in NHW than\nin NHB. Additional analysis on this current study data revealed\nthat sex- and age-adjusted serum cobalamin concentrations were\nTABLE 4 Plasma tHcy concentrations by blood B vitamins and MMA concentrations in the post-folic\nPlasma tHcy\nSex-, age-, and\nrace/ethnicity\u00adadjusted P-value2 P-value3\nMultivariate-\nmmol/L mmol/L\n1 Values are means 6 SEM.

Because cobalamin\nis a coenzyme for methionine synthase (required for remethy-\nlation of Hcy to methionine), an inverse association between\nserum cobalamin and tHcy concentrations is expected. Muta-\ntion in the MTHFR gene (677C/T) results in reduced activity\nof MTHFR, especially in those with low folate status. MTHFR\nactivity is reduced to 34% in TTand 71% in CT relative to wild-\ntype CC (50). MTHFR converts N5 N10 methylenetetrahydro-\nfolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is a methyl donor for\nremethylation of Hcy to methionine. Persons with homozygosity\nfor 677C/T (TT) (present in ;12% NHW) have increased\ncirculating tHcy concentrations (20) and have a greater require-\nment for folate compared with those with the CT or CC\ngenotype (51). Because folate status has dramatically improved\nin the post-folic acid fortification period (7\u00ad11), the impact of\nMTHFR polymorphism on tHcy would be reduced in the\npostfortification era.\nIn this study, plasma tHcy and cotinine, a biochemical marker\nof smoking, were directly related in the post-folic acid fortifica-\ntion period. There was a similar relationship between cotinine\nand tHcy in the pre-folic acid fortification period (NHANES\nbetween cotinine and tHcy is not modified as a result of folic acid\nfortification. Serum cotinine is a reliable biochemical marker of\nsmoking, because self-reported smoking is often underreported\n(52). Also, serum cotinine accounts for second-hand smoking. In\nthis study, persons who are in the 4th quartile for serum cotinine\nhad ;0.84 mmol/L higher plasma tHcy than those in the first\nquartile. Although the exact mechanism through which cotinine\ninfluences tHcy is not known, the likely explanation for high tHcy\nin smokers is low folate, cobalamin, and pyridoxine status (53\u00ad\nSystolic BP was a significant determinant of plasma tHcy in\nthe postfortification period. Persons with $129 mm Hg systolic\nBP had ;0.57 mmol/L higher tHcy than did persons with systolic\nBP ,108 mm Hg. These results support the previously reported\ndirect relation between tHcy and BP in the Hordaland Homo-\ncysteine Study by Refsum et al. (16). Rasmussen et al. (33) found\na direct relation between systolic BP and tHcy in younger\nsubjects. However, it is not known exactly whether increased\ntHcy leads to increased BP or increased BP leads to increased\ntHcy concentrations.\nInverse associations between serum folate, RBC folate, and\nserum cobalamin and tHcy concentrations reported in this study\nare in accordance with earlier studies using the data collected in\nthe prefortification period (26,27). Earlier, we reported that folic\nserum folate concentrations and decreased prevalence of low\nserum folate from 18.4 to 0.2% from pre- to postfortification\nperiod in the US (7). In Canada, folic acid fortification improved\nserum folate by ;51\u00ad67% (58). Given the dramatic increase in\nfolate status in the postfortification era, the decrease in plasma\ntHcy is anticipated. In this study, persons in the first quartile for\nserum folate had ;1.4 mmol/L higher tHcy compared with those\nin the 4th quartile. However, the inverse association between\nserum folate and tHcy was weak, albeit significant. Quinlivan\net al. (59) reported that dependency of tHcy on folic acid\ngradually diminished in women when they received sequential\nacid fortification resulted in an increased intake of .200 mg/d of\nfolic acid (4). Thus, the weakened relation between serum folate\nand plasma tHcy in this study was likely due to improved folate\nstatus from the mandated folic acid fortification. Because of this\nimproved folate status in the postfortification period (7\u00ad11), low\ncobalamin status has emerged as the dominant determinant of\ncirculating tHcy (60,61). Liaugaudas et al. (60) reported that\npopulation-attributable risk percentages for hyperhomocystei-\npatients with stable coronary artery disease. Similarly, in the\nSacramento Latino Study (61), the population-attributable risk\npercentages for hyperhomocysteinemia were 29.7% for serum\nin subjects aged $60 y.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to report a direct\nrelation between serum MMA and plasma tHcy in a nationally\nrepresentative sample that supports the previous observation in\na convenience sample by Koehler et al. (62). MMA is considered\na sensitive marker of cobalamin deficiency. In cobalamin de-\nficiency, MMA is derived from the hydrolysis of methylmalonyl-\nCoA due to decreased function of cobalamin-dependant\nmethylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which converts methylmalonyl-\nCoA to succinyl-CoA (63). Both tHcy and MMA are elevated in\ncobalamin deficiency. The severity of cobalamin deficiency is\nassociated with increased circulating MMA and tHcy (64).\nHowever, serum MMA is not a gold standard for cobalamin\ndeficiency, because a significant number of elderly persons with\nhigh cobalamin status had high MMA concentrations. This was\nlikely due to declined renal function rather than true cobalamin\ndeficiency (64). Because of stronger association between serum\nMMA and plasma tHcy in the post-folic acid fortification\nperiod, screening for cobalamin deficiency is important, espe-\ncially in older persons who are at risk for cobalamin deficiency.\nDue to the cross-sectional nature of this study, assessment of\ncause and effect relation was not possible. Because plasma tHcy\nconcentrations have changed inversely in response to changes in\nserum folate concentrations (7,9\u00ad11), plasma tHcy can be used\nas a biochemical marker in assessing the impact of folic acid\nTABLE 5 Association between plasma tHcy concentrations\nand demographic, health and lifestyle factors, and B\nvitamin status in the post-folic acid fortification\n1 n \u00bc 16,254.

The interaction between serum cobalamin and serum MMA was\nnot significant (P , 0.17).

If\nelevated tHcy is associated with increased risk for CVD, then the\ndecreased tHcy would have an opposite effect on CVD. So far,\nthe controlled trials addressing this question have yielded some\npositive results (65). Yang et al. (66) reported that the stroke\nmortality has declined from the pre- to postfortification period\nin the US and Canada. Because of the rise and fall of serum folate\nconcentrations after folic acid fortification, it is important to\nmonitor the impact of nationwide mandated folic acid fortifi-\ncation on overall health and well being of U.S. residents on a\ncontinuous basis.\nLiterature Cited\n1.
