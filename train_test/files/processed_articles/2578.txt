Young people with mentors\ndo better in school (Rhodes, Grossman & Resch, 2000),\nare more socially successful (Langhout, Rhodes &\nOsborne, 2004), and engage in less problem behaviors\n(Chang, Greenberger, Chen, Heckhausen & Farruggia,\nadolescents. These findings cross cultural, gender, and\nsocioeconomic lines (e.g., Erickson, McDonald & Elder,\nbody of research finds similar results among college\nRamaswami, Dreher, Bretz & Wiethoff, 2010).\nWhile the majority of research on adolescent and youth\nmentoring has focused on formal mentoring relationships\nor mentoring programs (e.g., DuBois et al., 2002; Rhodes\net al., 2000), in the past decade there has been an emer-\ngence of literature highlighting the value of naturally\noccurring mentorships for young people (DuBois & Sil-\nverthorn, 2005b; Sterrett, Jones, McKee & Kincaid,\n2011). Naturally occurring mentors, or people who \"step\noutside of their normal social roles\" to help and support\nof youth, making them more common than formal men-\ntors during adolescence (McLearn, Colasanto & Schoen,\n1998). Moreover, naturally occurring mentors provide the\nsame (DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005b) or even greater\nbenefits than formal mentors (Ragins & Cotton, 1999).\nHowever, the unstructured and sometimes ambiguous\nnature of naturally occurring mentor relationships makes\nThe Functions and Longitudinal Outcomes of Adolescents' Naturally\nOccurring Mentorships\nThomas Miranda-Chan,1, Veronica Fruiht,2, Valeska Dubon,2 and Laura Wray-Lake3\nAuthors contributed to this work equally.\n Veronica Fruiht\nfruihtv@uww.edu\n1 Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, CA,\n2 University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, Whitewater, WI,\n3 University of Rochester, Rochester, NY\nthem more difficult to study and their impact more diffi-\ncult to quantify. For instance, studies often include peers,\nrelatives, or parents in analyses of adolescents' naturally\noccurring mentoring relationships. Thus, definitions can\nvary widely and sometimes conflate mentoring with famil-\nial or peer support. Furthermore, the lack of a fully devel-\noped theoretical model of youth mentoring functions adds\nto the challenge of precisely capturing the quality or goals\nof a naturally occurring mentor relationship.\nIn this article, we define a naturally occurring mentor as\nan unrelated (nonfamily member) adult who has an ongo-\ning and positive impact on the life of a prot\neg\ne. We aim to\nunderstand the long-term correlates of these relationships\nusing a large nationally representative U.S. sample and\nlinking mentoring in adolescence to functioning in multi-\nple domains during young adulthood (25\u00ad35 year olds).\nWhile some outcomes have been assessed thoroughly and\ntracked well into young adulthood (e.g., psychological\nwell-being), others have been scarcely investigated (e.g.,\nromantic relationship satisfaction), or only assessed into\nemerging adulthood (e.g., substance use has been studied\nin 18- to 25-year-old participants). Our second aim is to\ndescribe the mentoring functions provided by naturally\noccurring mentors to advance theory and research on these\nrelationships. In the review that follows, we address the\nexisting empirical literature regarding these outcomes in\nBenefits of Mentors: What Outcomes Does\nMentoring Predict?\nGiven that adolescence is a time of dramatic changes in\ncognitive, social, and identity domains (cf. Choudhury,\nduring these years can set the stage for positive adjust-\nment in adulthood (Hoyt, Chase-Lansdale, McDade &\nmentoring literature in recent decades has begun to\nembrace a positive youth development (PYD) perspective\nand increasingly emphasize the role of mentoring in\nenhancing thriving. The PYD perspective argues that\nresearch should investigate strategies to promote youth\nwell-being in addition to reducing problem behaviors\n(Lerner, Dowling & Anderson, 2003). Several studies\nextend the products of developmental relationships beyond\nschool retention and substance use to look at psychologi-\ncal well-being as well as positive contributions to society\n(Whitney, Hendricker & Offutt, 2011; Zeldin, Christens &\nPowers, 2013; Zeldin, Krauss, Collura, Lucchesi & Sulai-\nman, 2014). A strong test of the long-term correlates of\nnaturally occurring mentors in adolescence would entail\nlinking mentoring to competencies in young adulthood.\nWe selected five categories of outcomes that span multiple\ndomains of functioning to provide a holistic picture of the\nlong-term role of naturally occurring mentoring relation-\nships during adolescence, examining psychological well-\nbeing, romantic relationships, educational attainment,\ncareer success, and criminal activity in young adulthood.\nPsychological Well-being\nRecent studies of mentoring have demonstrated the role of\nmentoring in promoting the psychological well-being of\nadolescent prot\neg\nes (Chen, Greenberger, Farruggia, Bush\nlongitudinal research has shown the benefit of having a\nnatural mentor in adolescence for predicting optimism in\nlater adolescence (Kogan, Brody & Chen, 2011) as well\nas life satisfaction and psychological well-being in young\nadulthood (Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014). Mentors offer\nsupport and care, which can help adolescents develop a\nmore positive self-concept and in turn lead to better psy-\nchological functioning (Rhodes, Spencer, Keller, Liang &\nNoam, 2006). Mentors can also model emotion regulation\nand provide opportunities to develop these skills. Other\nmentoring functions that may promote psychological well-\nbeing include acting as a friend or parent, providing emo-\ntional support, counseling, and showing positive regard\nfor the adolescent (Chen et al., 2003; Greeson, Usher &\nThese formative experiences around positive self-concept\nmay have lasting implications for adolescents' psychologi-\ncal well-being that persist into adulthood (Hoyt et al.,\nthis finding in a nationally representative sample.\nRomantic Relationship Satisfaction\nRelationship satisfaction in adulthood has been linked to a\nnumber of developmental experiences and skills that\nmight be influenced by a mentor in adolescence. Mentors\nprovide adolescents with opportunities to learn new strate-\ngies such as positive ways of responding and behaving in\nsocial situations and emotion regulation skills (Rhodes\net al., 2006). These skills are predictive of relationship\nsatisfaction in adulthood (Bradbury & Scaffer, 2012; Mal-\nouff, Schutte & Thorsteinsson, 2014). Among adolescents,\nmentoring has been shown to relate to greater trust in\nas improved social functioning (Langhout et al., 2004).\nFurther, having a mentor in adolescence is predictive of\nbetter social functioning in young adulthood (Hurd &\nZimmerman, 2014). However, no published studies have\nconsidered the role of mentors in relation to adolescents'\nfunctioning in romantic relationships, nor have they\nspecifically investigated mentoring relationships as foun-\ndational for developing healthy and satisfying adult\nromantic relationships. Thus, this study addresses this gap\nby linking mentoring to relationship satisfaction in young\nadulthood.\nEducational Attainment\nNumerous studies demonstrate a relationship between\nnaturally occurring mentoring relationships in adoles-\ncence and educational attainment (DuBois & Silver-\nSchoeny, Lovegrove & Nichols, 2014). Having a tea-\ncher or other educator as a mentor was particularly ben-\neficial for supporting educational success during these\nyears (Fruiht & Wray-Lake, 2013). This link is perhaps\nthe most commonly demonstrated benefit of adolescent\nmentoring, and the impact of mentoring on educational\nattainment has been demonstrated to reach beyond ado-\nlescence into emerging adulthood (DuBois & Silver-\nLake, 2013). By exposing adolescents to new learning\nexperiences, explicitly encouraging academic success\n(Tolan et al., 2014), fostering a positive academic iden-\ntity (Erickson et al., 2009), providing the social capital\n(Chang et al., 2010), and motivating goal attainment\n(Spencer, 2010), mentors can promote educational suc-\ncess in their prot\neg\nes. This study replicates past findings\nin a sample young adults, by which age most have\nlikely completed their education.\nCareer Success\nEducational attainment and success in school can, in turn,\nopen doors to more career options. Many of the same cogni-\ntive and motivational skills related to goal setting may\ntranslate to career building skills that benefit adolescents as\nthey move into the workforce. Not surprisingly, mentoring\nin adolescence has been shown to increase the likelihood of\nbeing employed in emerging adulthood (DuBois & Silver-\nthorn, 2005b; McDonald, Erickson, Johnson & Elder,\n2007). It does not, however, seem to predict job stability or\nextrinsic job rewards (such as pay and benefits) as prot\neg\nes\nexcept for individuals without a father figure who had a\nmale mentor (Timpe & Lunkenheimer, 2015). Yet, men-\ntored adolescents have jobs with more autonomy and\nauthority in these early career years (McDonald & Lambert,\n2014). Among adults in the workforce, mentoring improves\njob and career satisfaction (Allen, Eby, Poteet, Lentz &\nLima, 2004)--however, no studies have considered the\nrelationship between mentoring in adolescence and job sat-\nisfaction in adulthood. Thus, this study will address this gap\nby investigating this relationship.\nCriminal Activity\nFormal and informal mentoring relationships have been\nshown to protect against criminality (DuBois & Silver-\net al., 2014), and substance use (Rhodes, Reddy & Gross-\nand emerging adulthood. Tolan et al. (2014) suggest that\nmentors protect against delinquency by role modeling\nappropriate behaviors, advocating for the prot\neg\ne, provid-\ning emotional support, and being a resource for practical\ninformation. Alternatively, Kogan et al. (2011) demon-\nstrated that the effect of mentoring on problem behaviors\nis mediated by mentees' self-regulatory skills and opti-\nmism. Given the role of early substance use and criminal\nactivity in predicting adult problem behavior (Sampson &\nLaub, 2005), and the recent study of developmental cas-\ncades in understanding the role of early adolescent experi-\nences as precursors to later experiences and behaviors\n(Masten & Cicchetti, 2010), it stands to reason that men-\ntors who support and protect their adolescent prot\neg\nes\nfrom problem behaviors may have a downstream impact\non criminal activity in adulthood. Our study will consider\nthis relationship between mentoring in adolescence and\ncriminal activity into young adulthood.\nMentoring Functions: How Do Mentors Help\nAdolescents?\nResearchers who investigate natural mentoring relation-\nships increasingly underscore the importance of looking\nnot just at the presence of a mentor, but at the quality\nand characteristics of the relationship (e.g., Hurd & Zim-\nlittle is known about how mentoring happens in informal\nDespite the growing body of research about the value of\na mentor, types of mentors (Erickson et al., 2009; Fruiht\n& Wray-Lake, 2013), and even relationship quality\n(Beam, Chen & Greenberger, 2002), little to no empiri-\ncal data examine the functions of youth mentors to ask\nwhat they do to impact the lives of their young prot\neg\nes.\nTo comprehensively understand the role of naturally\noccurring mentors, we analyzed and categorized adoles-\ncents' qualitative responses about how mentors helped\nthem.\nRhodes et al. (2006) provide a theoretical model of the\nthree key ways that youth mentors support socioemotional,\ncognitive, and identity development of children and adoles-\ncents. While this model offers a useful starting point for\nunderstanding some of the key functions of youth mentors,\nthe model has rarely if ever been tested and thus lacks empiri-\ncal support. Further, it does not provide much detail about\nwhat mentoring looks like, how adolescents perceive the sup-\nport they receive, or the mechanisms through which mentors\nprovide support for these three broad domains of develop-\nment. Building from this work and the works of others (e.g.,\nDuBois, Portillo, Rhodes, Silverthorn, & Valentine, 2011),\nTolan et al. (2014) parsed the functions of youth mentors into\nfour categories: (a) role modeling, (b) teaching, (c) advocacy,\nand (d) emotional support. While this model provides some-\nwhat more concrete categories of support, it is again based on\ntheoretical estimations of the functions of youth mentors. In\ntheir meta-analytic review of formal mentoring programs,\nthese four components were coded as present/nonpresent in\nvarious programs, but no useful taxonomy for understanding\nwhat comprises each function was provided.\nConversely, in the career mentoring literature, Kram\n(1985) delineated the two key mentoring functions of a\nworkplace mentor (i.e., career and psychosocial) and then\nprovided more fine grain detail about the mechanisms of\nsupport under each umbrella. For example, career mentor-\ning includes various functions, such as coaching, sponsor-\ning, challenging, and promoting visibility (Kram, 1985).\nThis more explicit model better explains the nature of\nmentoring relationships and the ways that mentors promote\npositive outcomes for their prot\neg\nes. It allows researchers\nto look at the specific types of support that benefit specific\ntypes of prot\neg\ne development and to provide a common\nlanguage for discussing mentoring functions and the out-\ncomes associated with them. Kram's model has stimulated\na substantial body of research on career mentoring that\ninvestigates the outcomes associated with varied mentoring\nfunctions (Allen et al., 2004). Such a taxonomy does not\nyet exist in the youth mentoring literature, but is a critical\nnext step toward understanding youth mentoring relation-\nships in a more complex way. Using qualitative responses\nfrom a national U.S. sample of youth who report naturally\noccurring mentors, this study aims to advance theory and\nresearch on youth mentoring by describing youth reported\nfunctions of mentors and categorizing them into a taxon-\nomy. This work can also advance the practice of youth\nmentoring by highlighting youth's views of various types\nof help they receive from mentors.\nHypotheses\nIn summary, this study aims to answer two key research\nquestions about youth mentoring: (a) What benefits of\nhaving a mentor in adolescence stretch into young adult-\nhood? (b) How do adolescents' mentors provide support\nfor socioemotional, cognitive, and identity development?\nBuilding upon the well-documented benefits of mentors in\nadolescence, this study tests five hypotheses about the\nyoung adult competencies associated with having a natu-\nrally occurring mentor in adolescence. To replicate past\nfindings (e.g., Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014; Kogan et al.,\n2011), we predicted that people who reported having a\nmentor during adolescence would have greater psycholog-\nical well-being in adulthood than unmentored participants.\nSpecifically, we hypothesized that mentored adolescents\nwould report greater levels of optimism (Hypothesis 1a),\ngreater levels of self-efficacy (Hypothesis 1b), and less\ndepressive symptoms (Hypothesis 1c) than people who\nreport having no mentor. Furthermore, we tested the the-\nory-driven hypothesis that individuals who report having\na mentor during adolescence would report greater relation-\nship satisfaction with their romantic partner in adulthood\nthan those who reported having no mentor (Hypothesis 2).\nIn line with past findings about the role of mentoring\nin predicting academic success in emerging adulthood\n(e.g., DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005a), we hypothesized that\nindividuals who reported having a mentor during adoles-\ncence would report greater educational attainment in\nadulthood than those who reported having no mentor\n(Hypothesis 3). To complement findings of McDonald\nand Lambert (2014) regarding career outcomes associated\nwith mentoring, we hypothesized people who report hav-\ning a mentor during adolescence would report greater job\nsatisfaction in adulthood than those who reported having\nno mentor (Hypothesis 4). Finally, given findings regard-\ning the protective role of mentors in reducing problem\nbehaviors in adolescence and emerging adulthood (e.g.,\net al., 2014), we hypothesized that having a mentor in\nadolescence would predict less criminal behavior in young\nadulthood (Hypothesis 5).\nTo address our second research question and encourage\nthe solidification of a taxonomy of youth mentoring func-\ntions, we systematically analyzed qualitative responses\nabout the functions of adolescents' naturally occurring\nmentors and aimed to categorize ways that mentors support\ntheir adolescent prot\neg\nes. We expected that youth reports\nof how mentors helped them would include descriptions of\nmentoring functions similar to those outlined by Kram\nand Crisp (2007), Schwartz, Rhodes, Spencer and Gross-\nThese frameworks cross boundaries of prot\neg\ne age, rela-\ntionship type, and relationship goals capturing the array of\nmentoring functions described in the current literature.\nHowever, none of these frameworks provide a complete\nand cohesive set of functions applied broadly to youth\nmentoring relationships. Utilizing a national sample of\nyouth enhances the comprehensive and generalizable\nnature of our taxonomy of youth mentoring functions.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThis study utilized data from the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent to Adult Health (ADD Health)--a\nnationally representative study that began in 1994 with\n7th\u00ad12th graders to examine the causes of health-related\nbehaviors of adolescence into adulthood. Data were\nobtained through in-home interviews with students and\ntheir parents, along with computer-assisted personal\ninterviews. This study used data that spanned approxi-\ndata were retrieved through The Institute for Social,\nCultural, and Policy Research (ISCPR; Harris & Udry,\nAll mentoring variables were extracted from the publi-\ncally available Wave III data consisting of 4882 partici-\npants with an age range of 18\u00ad28 years. Wave IV\n(n = 5114) was used to identify measures of competencies\nin young adulthood (25\u00ad35 years of age). Wave I\n(n = 6504) was used to determine basic demographic\ninformation such as age, biological sex, and ethnicity, as\nwell as potential personal and environmental risk factors\nsuch as parent receiving public assistance, and feelings of\nsafety in the neighborhood (Table 1). These variables\nwere used as covariates for all analyses and were selected\nbased on relevant natural mentoring literature (DuBois &\nParticipants with mentors were identified by answering\nthe following question in the Wave III home interview,\n\"Other than your parents or step-parents, has an adult\nmade an important positive difference in your life at any\ntime since you were 14 years old?\" Participants were\nexcluded if (a) they did not identify mentors (i.e., others,\nrefused, don't know options), (b) related family members\n(i.e., brother, sister, grandparents, stepparents, aunt,\nuncle), peers, spouses, or partners were reported as men-\ntors, (c) there was not enough written response to be\ncoded for mentors' functioning question, \"How did {he/\nshe} help you?\" (i.e., blank response, incomplete/incoher-\nent response, and responses that did not provide enough\ndetail to be coded; n = 58), or (d) they reported that their\nmentor became important outside of the adolescent years\n(12\u00ad22 years of age). This age range was chosen because\nit encompasses adolescence and the transition into\nadulthood.\nwho reported having a naturally occurring mentor meeting\nour criteria and 1145 participants who reported not having\na mentor (45.9%). Participants with missing data on\ncovariates, mentoring, or adult competency measures were\nexcluded from the analyses. Responses from the 1350 par-\nticipants that were identified as having a nonfamilial and\nnonpeer mentor were analyzed for the taxonomy of\nmentoring functions.\nChi-square analyses examined whether reporting a\nmentor varied as a function of sex, ethnicity, public assis-\ntance, and neighborhood safety. Youth who reported hav-\ning a mentor during adolescence were more likely to be\nWhite, report that their parents did not receive public\nassistance, and report feeling safe in their neighborhood at\nWave I. A t-test examining differences in age between\nmentored and unmentored participants was significant,\nsuggesting that mentored individuals were somewhat\nyounger than unmentored individuals (Table 1).\nMeasures\nPsychological Well-being\nThis study assessed three components of psychological\nwell-being: optimism, self-efficacy, and depression as\nmeasured in the Wave IV interview.\nOptimism. Participants' optimism was assessed by\ntaking the mean of their responses to three items\n(a = .617): \"I am always optimistic about my future,\"\n\"Overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than\nbad,\" and the reverse coded item \"I rarely count on good\nTable 1 Descriptive and inferential statistics comparing mentored\nversus unmentored adolescents\nNo mentor Mentor\nTest\nstatistic\nAfrican-\nAmerican\nParent receives\npublic\nassistance\nFeels safe in\nneighborhood\nat-test.\nbChi-square goodness of fit.\nthings happening to me.\" Responses were coded on a\nfive-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)\nto 5 (strongly agree).\nSelf-efficacy. Participants' level of self-efficacy was\nassessed by taking the mean of their responses to three\nitems (a = .756): \"There is little I can do to change the\nimportant things in my life,\" \"I have little control over\nthings that happen to me,\" and \"There is really no way I\ncan solve the problems I have.\" Responses were coded on\na five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)\nto 5 (strongly agree). The composite score of the three\nitems was reversed to provide greater interpretability\n(higher scores signified greater self-efficacy).\nDepressive Symptoms. Prevalence of depressive\nsymptoms was assessed by taking the mean of their\nresponses to three items about feelings in the past 7 days\n(a = .814): \"You could not shake off the blues, even with\nhelp from your family and friends,\" \"You felt depressed,\"\nand \"You felt sad.\" The responses were coded as:\n0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = a lot of the time,\nand 3 = most of the time or all of the time.\nRelationship Satisfaction\nParticipants' relationship satisfaction with their current (or\nmost recent) romantic partner was assessed by taking the\nmean of the response values to seven items measuring sat-\nisfaction, enjoyment, trust, and intimacy in a romantic\nrelationship (a = .884). Responses ranged from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\nEducational Attainment\nEducational attainment was assessed continuously using\nthe following question on Wave IV, \"What is the highest\nlevel of education that you have achieved to date?\"\nResponse categories ranged from 1 (did not finish high\nschool) to 10 (doctoral or professional degree).\nJob Satisfaction\nJob satisfaction was determined based on responses to a\nsingle question that asked, \"How satisfied (are/were) you\nwith (your current or most recent) job, as a whole?\"\nResponses were coded on a five-point Likert scale of \"sat-\nisfaction\" ranging from 1 (extremely satisfied) to 5 (ex-\ntremely dissatisfied). Scores were reversed so that higher\nscores reflected greater satisfaction.\nCriminal Activity\nParticipants' involvement with the law was assessed using\ntheir responses to four questions regarding being arrested,\nconvicted, on probation, or serving a jail or prison\nsentence for a crime. Responses were coded as 0 if they\nanswered \"no\" to all of the questions and 1 if they\nanswered \"yes\" to any of the questions. Responses were\ndichotomized because of the low prevalence of criminal\nactivity among youth in this sample.\nCovariates\nCovariates used in this study were gender (0 = male,\n1 = female), age (in years), ethnicity (dummy coded with\nWhite as the reference group), parent receives public assis-\ntance (0 = no, 1 = yes), and participants feeling safe in\ntheir neighborhoods (0 = no, 1 = yes).\nMentoring Functions\nParticipants' responses to an open-ended mentoring func-\ntion question that asked \"How did {he/she} help you?\"\nwere coded by two researchers using existing frameworks\nwhile remaining open to the emergence of themes not rep-\nresented in existing frameworks--a procedure similar to\nthat used in the examination of adolescents' reports of\nfamily values (Wray-Lake, Flanagan, Benavides & Shu-\nbert, 2014). Coders examined responses three times. The\nfirst time coders familiarized themselves with the data and\ndiscussed descriptions of mentor functions as defined in\nthe literature. The second time the coders assigned codes\nto responses using mentor functions outlined by the exist-\ning frameworks. Lastly, the coders considered responses\nthat could not be coded with existing frameworks to look\nfor the emergence of new themes not captured by existing\nmodels. Each response was given a maximum of three\ncodes. To assess inter-rater reliability, the coders coded\npared codes. A kappa of .808 was obtained between\ncoders, and differences in coding were reconciled through\ndiscussion.\nResults\nTo answer the dual research questions about (a) the long-\nterm correlates of mentoring and (b) how mentors help\nadolescents, analyses were conducted in two parts. First,\nquantitative analyses investigated the adult competencies\nassociated with having a naturally occurring nonfamilial,\nnonpeer mentor in adolescence. Second, to categorize\nmentoring functions, researchers coded responses from an\nopen-ended question about the supports that mentors\nprovided.\nQuantitative Analyses of Competencies in Young\nAdulthood\nInitial descriptive statistics revealed some of the young\nadult measures were not normally distributed; thus, log\ntransformations were performed on measures of depressive\nsymptoms, relationship satisfaction, and self-efficacy to\nmeet statistical assumptions of parametric analyses. Hier-\narchical linear regression was used for all analyses except\nfor criminal activities, for which binary logistic regression\nwas used. Covariates were entered in the first step for all\nanalyses; having a mentor was entered in the second step.\nBeta weights reported throughout represent standardized\nregression coefficients within each model.\nPsychological Well-being\nAfter accounting for age, ethnicity, gender, parents use of\npublic assistance, and feeling safe in one's neighborhood,\nhaving a mentor during adolescence was positively related\np < .001) in adulthood and negatively related to depres-\nRelationship Satisfaction\nAdditionally, having a mentor during adolescence was\nrelated to greater romantic relationship satisfaction in\nEducational Attainment\nHaving a mentor during adolescence was related to higher\nJob Satisfaction\nHaving a mentor during adolescence was not significantly\nrelated to job satisfaction in adulthood (b = .016, p > .05)\nafter accounting for controls.\nCriminal Activity\nBinary logistic regression results revealed that individuals\nwho reported having a mentor during adolescence were\nless likely to have been involved in criminal activity\nling for age, ethnicity, gender, parents use of public\nassistance, and feeling safe in one's neighborhood.\nQualitative Analysis of Mentoring Functions\nTwo researchers coded 1350 open-ended responses about\nhow mentors helped their adolescent prot\neg\nes. The coding\nscheme developed generated 19 distinct mentoring func-\ntions (Table 3). From these, 14 reflected mentoring func-\ntions that have been described in the literature, capturing\n77.06% of responses, and five emerged from analysis of\nresponses that could not be coded using existing func-\ntions. Each response could be given up to three codes:\n(7.19%) of the responses received three codes. Socioemo-\ntional support, a function included in every preexisting\nframework of mentoring, was the largest category, making\nup 19.31% of codes. Other major categories included pro-\nviding professional/academic guidance (12.93%), provid-\ning life advice/personal guidance (11.58%), instilling\npositive personal attributes (10.12%), and promoting moti-\nCodes were then organized into three meta-functions\n--socioemotional development, cognitive development,\nand identity development--that map on to Rhodes\nTable 2 Hierarchical regression analyses for young adult correlates of mentoring (n = 2495)\nEducational\nattainment Self efficacy Optimism\nDepressive\nsymptoms\nRelationship\nsatisfaction\nb SE b SE b SE b SE b SE\nb-values represent standardized regression weights.\nTable 3 Codes generated to describe mentoring functions provided by adolescents' mentors\net al.'s (2006) framework. Socioemotional development\ncomprises functions like providing emotional support or\nbeing a friend. Cognitive development includes interac-\ntions such as teaching practical skills and providing\neducational and professional guidance and sponsorship.\nFinally, identity development is made up of functions\nthat would help the adolescent develop a sense of self\nsuch as instilling positive personal attributes, being a\nrole model, and supporting goal striving. A summary of\nmeta-functions is provided in Table 4. Meta-functions\ndid not capture \"general/underspecified\" category nor\n\"tangible support.\" Tangible supports such as financial\nsupport and providing childcare or resources did not fit\nwell into any of Rhodes et al.'s (2006) functions, but\nshould be noted as functions of youth's natural\nmentors.\nDiscussion\nThe two primary goals of this study were to understand\nthe longitudinal correlates of naturally occurring mentor-\ning relationships in adolescence and to identify and clas-\nsify the mentoring functions provided by these mentors.\nHaving a naturally occurring mentor in adolescence was\nassociated with better psychological well-being, greater\noverall satisfaction with a romantic partner, greater educa-\ntion attainment, and less criminal activity in young adult-\nhood. Extending findings into young adulthood is\nimportant because it is a time when individuals enter into\nmore stable and mature relationships and careers. Further,\nby coding the mentoring functions reported by a nation-\nally representative sample of adolescents, we were able to\nexpand Rhodes et al. (2006) model of youth mentoring\nfunctions to identify specific types of strategies mentors\nuse to supporting socioemotional, cognitive, and identity\ndevelopment. The quantitative and qualitative findings\ntogether tell a story about the long-term role of mentoring\nrelationships for young adults' competencies and about\nhow mentoring might work to enhance positive outcomes.\nAlthough merging the quantitative and qualitative findings\nempirically were beyond the scope of this article, we syn-\nthesize these findings in our discussion of the value of\nour work for theory and practice.\nLongitudinal results demonstrate the long-term influ-\nence of mentoring relationships in adolescence on\nyoung adulthood regarding academic, social, and emo-\ntional competencies. The findings build upon past\nresearch that demonstrate the correlations between ado-\nlescent mentoring and thriving in emerging and young\nadulthood and expand the competencies associated with\nmentoring beyond the traditional focus on academics\nand problem behaviors to see the association between\nmentoring and positive adult relationships. A key contri-\nbution of this study is investigating a comprehensive set\nof outcomes associated with adolescent mentoring in\nyoung adulthood. While past research has shown many\ncorrelates of adolescent mentoring relationships with\nemerging adult outcomes, this study demonstrates that\nthese benefits of mentoring persist into young adulthood\nas individuals enter into more stable careers and\nrelationships.\nTable 4 Taxonomy of mentoring functions organized under the meta-functions from Rhodes et al. (2006) model\n6.24% of codes were not captured by meta-functions.\nSocioemotional Development\nYouth with natural mentors in adolescence reported\ngreater optimism and self-efficacy and fewer depressive\nsymptoms in young adulthood. These results are congru-\nent with previous studies suggesting that mentoring is\nbeneficial for well-being in adolescence and young adult-\nhood (DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005a; Hurd & Zimmerman,\nstudies of the social benefits of mentoring in young adult-\nhood (Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014), results demonstrated\nthat mentored adolescents were more satisfied in their\nromantic relationships in their 20s and 30s compared with\nunmentored adolescents. Despite the small effect size, this\nnovel finding suggests a potentially long-lasting and far-\nreaching effect of naturally occurring mentoring relation-\nships, as no past studies have considered romantic rela-\ntionship satisfaction as related to youth mentoring. Given\nrole of mentoring relationships in developing social skills,\nemotional regulation, and the ability to build other posi-\ntive relationships (Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014; Langhout\net al., 2004), this finding expands our overall understand-\ning of the broad-reaching effects of naturally occurring\nrelationships on psychosocial competencies.\nQualitative findings suggest that mentors provide a\nvariety of socioemotional mentoring functions to their\nprot\neg\nes that may develop a foundation for well-being\nand positive relationships in adulthood. Rhodes et al.\n(2006) posited that mentors help with adolescents' self-\nworth because adolescents internalize the perceptions of\nacceptance, support, and regard projected by their men-\ntors. Likewise, adolescents in this study described their\nmentors as being there for them, supporting them through\nchallenges, inspiring them to do better, and holding them\nin high regard. Mentors likely also engage in positive\nsocial interactions with adolescents where they develop\nsocial and communications skills and learn to better\nunderstand, express, and regulate their emotions and\nbehaviors (Rhodes et al., 2006). Aligned with this idea,\nadolescents in our sample reported that their mentors set\nexamples and provided instruction for how to behave\nsocially, regulate emotions, and handle stressful situations.\nThus, our qualitative analyses offer validity and context to\nour quantitative findings showing long-term associations\nbetween mentoring and socioemotional competencies,\nalthough we could not empirically demonstrate a connec-\ntion between mentoring functions and prot\neg\ne outcomes.\nCognitive Development\nParticipants who had mentors during adolescence, on\naverage, had greater education attainment than those who\ndid not, resembling previous findings linking natural\nmentorships to greater educational achievement or attain-\nThis relationship showed the largest effect size of any out-\ncome we considered, highlighting the centrality of the\nimpact of mentoring on education. Further, these quantita-\ntive findings were paralleled by our qualitative analysis of\nmentoring functions associated with cognitive develop-\nment. In line with theory and past research, mentors aided\nin cognitive development and supported academic success\nby providing academic and professional guidance and\nteaching prot\neg\nes practical academic skills (Rhodes et al.,\ntheir mentors helped them with college applications and\nschoolwork and taught them to navigate academia. Simi-\nlarly, mentors provided the social capital for academic\nsuccess (Chang et al., 2010) by serving as professional or\nacademic sponsors. For example, mentors wrote letters of\nrecommendation and helped their prot\neg\nes access new\nopportunities. These findings are in line with a large body\nof literature focused on the academic benefits of youth\nmentoring and, in particular, the role of mentors who are\neducators with the academic expertise and skills to guide\nstudents (Erickson et al., 2009; Fruiht & Wray-Lake,\nIdentity Development\nThe third mentoring function identified by Rhodes et al.\n(2006) and supported by our qualitative analyses was iden-\ntity development. Our quantitative analyses demonstrated\nthat having a naturally occurring mentor in adolescence\nwas not related to job satisfaction in adulthood. The major-\nity of participants, however, reported being satisfied or\nextremely satisfied with their current job. It is possible that\nthere was not enough variation in responses to detect a\nmeaningful effect. Furthermore, it is possible that young\nadults have not yet reached their career aspirations, and\nthe influence of mentoring in adolescence on job satisfac-\ntion will manifest in later career stages. Given the often\ndemonstrated relationship between mentoring and aca-\ndemic success, as well as McDonald and Lambert's (2014)\nfindings about the relationship between mentoring and\nintrinsically rewarding work in young adulthood, future\nresearch should continue to explore the potential correlates\nbetween youth mentoring and later work success.\nA strong and positive sense of self may also contribute\nto the impact of mentoring of reduced criminal behavior\nas demonstrated by past studies (DuBois & Silverthorn,\nby looking at young adult rather than emerging adult\nbehaviors, our results demonstrated that participants with\nmentors in adolescence reported less criminal involvement\nthan those without mentors. This difference may result\nfrom mentors supporting good decision making and pro-\nviding adolescents with guidance and advice about how to\nlook at the long-term consequences of their choices. Fur-\nthermore, mentors served as positive role models, encour-\naged ethical development, and protected their prot\neg\nes\nfrom harm--potentially helping adolescents to develop a\nsense of identity that does not incorporate deviant roles--\nas was suggested by past research (Rhodes et al., 2006;\nAlthough most participants did not explicitly report an\nimpact on their sense of self or identity--many reported\nmentoring functions provided by their mentors to support\nthe development of a positive identity. Mentors, for\ninstance, inspired their prot\neg\nes to try new things, to\nbelieve in themselves, and to make morally sound judg-\nments. Many participants also mentioned that their men-\ntors served as role models or exemplars for the type of\npeople they wanted to be.\nThis support for identity overlaps in many ways with\nsupports for cognitive and socioemotional development, as\na positive sense of self or a strong identity as successful stu-\ndent or citizen may benefit an individual socially, emotion-\nally, and academically. For instance, participants' mentors\nactively supported them in staying motivated toward their\ngoals. Because goal setting and commitment have been con-\nsistently shown to predict school retention (Covington,\n2000), this may be another mechanism through which men-\ntors promote academic success. Similarly, individuals with\nhigh self-efficacy and sense of well-being perform better in\nschool (Gilman & Huebner, 2006) suggesting socioemo-\ntional support may foster academic success as well.\nA substantial strength of our taxonomy of mentoring\nfunctions was that it drew from existing theories of youth,\nadolescent, college, and career mentoring literatures to\ndevelop a comprehensive catalog of functions provided by\nmentors. Such a taxonomy provides a foundation for\nfuture study of naturally occurring mentoring relationships\nby making explicit the things that mentors do to support\npositive development of their young prot\neg\nes. Past con-\nceptualizations of youth mentoring functions have been\ntheoretical, whereas this taxonomy provides a more tangi-\nble framework on which to build future research. By\napproaching data with these frameworks and allowing pre-\nviously unidentified functions to emerge from the data,\nfor instance we were able to make note of cognitive men-\ntoring functions such as facilitating perspective taking and\nteaching practical life and academic skills. Similarly, we\ndiscovered that participants reported mentors promoting\ntheir spiritual or religious development, and a mentoring\nfunction has not been considered by past studies but is in\nline with other qualitative findings that youth consider\nspiritual support one function of a mentor (Fruiht, 2015).\nThese previously unrecognized functions likely aided ado-\nlescents in perspective taking, metacognition, and the\nskills necessary for academic success. One set of func-\ntions that is represented in the data--but is not included\nin the framework developed from Rhodes et al. (2006)\ntheory--is tangible support, such as financial support or\nchildcare. These practical means of support have been\nidentified by few past models of adolescent mentoring (cf.\n2013b) and made up a very small portion of overall\nresponses. However, their value should be considered by\nfuture research. This nontraditional approach to qualitative\nanalysis provided a unique perspective on the data and\nsituated findings in existing theory, unlike purely data-\ndriven approaches used in past studies.\nLimitations and Conclusions\nThese findings not only build upon and expand past\nresearch about the long-term benefits of naturally occur-\nring mentoring relationships during adolescence but also\nset the stage for future research to more thoroughly under-\nstand the functions of natural mentors. By utilizing sec-\nondary data, we were able to use a large, nationally\nrepresentative sample of adolescents; however, as always\nwith secondary analyses, the study was constrained by the\nitems in the database. For instance, participants were only\nable to nominate one mentor, rather than provide informa-\ntion about the networks from which they might receive\nsupport (Higgins & Kram, 2001). Moreover, this study\ndid not control for duration, closeness, or frequency of\ncontact with mentors, which previous studies have sug-\ngested as potential moderators of the impact of mentoring\nrelationships. Additionally, asking youth to retrospectively\nreport about their mentors and functions of their mentors\nmay have led to biased reporting, and in particular,\nattributing their own positive successes to the relationship\nwith the mentors. Instead, if youth were asked about their\nmentors at each wave, we could have gained a much\nclearer and precise understanding of age-related variations\nor developmental patterns in types of mentoring functions.\nFor example, it is possible that mentors focus on career-\nrelevant themes with later adolescents and social skill\nbuilding in earlier adolescence. Youth reporting retrospec-\ntively may have tended to over-report more recent func-\ntions of their mentors, and so the taxonomy may\nunderrepresent the functions of mentors in early adoles-\ncence. Similarly, participants provided just one example\nof the primary form of support received from their\nmentors. While this was useful in creating a taxonomy of\nsupport, it did not allow us to look at the impact of\nspecific mentoring functions on later outcomes to link\nthe qualitative and quantitative analyses. Despite these\nlimitations, this study improves our understanding the\nways that natural mentoring relationships are meaningful\nin the development of adolescents and young adults.\nBetter understanding the mentoring functions provided\nby mentors is a critical step in strengthening the body of\nresearch surrounding youth and adolescent mentoring.\nWithout a clear taxonomy of the functions of mentors,\nresearchers have no clear parameters for studying the differ-\nent types of support that mentors provide and develop new,\nunstandardized, procedures for operationalizing youth men-\ntoring goals for each new project (e.g., Chen et al., 2003;\nGreeson et al., 2010). Thus, this taxonomy will provide a\nfoundation from which to work as future studies investigate\nthe mechanisms through which mentoring happens. Simi-\nlarly, future research could assess the connection between\nthe mentoring functions we summarized here and compe-\ntencies in adolescence and adulthood. While we could not\naddress this connection given the single item measuring the\nprimary function of the mentoring relationship, in-depth\ninterviews on the topic of mentoring or a self-report inven-\ntory of received mentoring functions could be used to assess\nwhat types of supports a mentor provided. This could then\nbe connected, using a longitudinal data collection, to com-\npetencies in later life to see the connection between specific\nyouth mentoring functions and thriving in adulthood. In\naddition to its benefit to the research community, the taxon-\nomy of youth mentoring functions may be used to improve\nthe effectiveness of formal mentoring programs as well as\nto provide suggestions for best practices to naturally occur-\nring mentors in the community.\nTaken together, this study's longitudinal results and\ntaxonomy of mentoring functions provides a platform for\nresearchers, mentoring programs, and mentors to under-\nstand the developmental implications and processes by\nwhich mentoring can make a lasting difference in the lives\nof adolescents.\n"
