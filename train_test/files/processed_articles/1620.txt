The\nAustralian ranking was based on edentulism and caries experience data from selected age groups that apparently were\ncollected in 1987\u00ad88. The objective of this study was to compare the oral health of Australian adults with that of three other\nwestern countries that have comprehensive oral health survey data.\nthe UK Adult Dental Health Survey 1998. Data from the Australian NSAOH 2004\u00ad06 were analysed to generate\ncomparable age-specific estimates using nine dental clinical indicators, two measures of oral hygiene behaviour and two of\ndental attendance.\nResults: Australia had the best oral health based on two clinical indicators, was equal first on three indicators and ranked\nsecond in the remaining clinical indicators. Australia ranked first or second based on dental flossing, use of mouthwash and\nfrequency of dental attendance.\nConclusions: The oral health of the Australian adult population was among the best of the four nations studied.\n",

In the decade after\n1988, the average number of sound teeth had increased,\nthere was no significant change in the average number\nof decayed or unsound teeth, and little overall change in\nthe average number of restored teeth.9\nNational oral health surveys have been used to\nmonitor oral health status in many countries and\ntypically collect data on the clinical signs of dental\ncaries, tooth presence, periodontal health indices and\nNational Survey of Adult Oral Health (NSAOH), and\npublished data from three other OECD countries,\nprovided a timely opportunity to compare the oral\nhealth and oral health behaviours of adult Australians\nwith adults of the same age groups from the US,\nGermany and the UK. The aim of this paper was to\ncompare the oral health of adult Australians with adults\nin three other countries.\nMETHODS\nPublished data from three recent national oral health\nsurveys conducted in the United States of America,\nGermany and the United Kingdom were compared\nwith Australian findings computed for comparable age\na clustered stratified random sampling design to select\na representative sample of people aged 15 years or\nmore. Survey participants were interviewed by tele-\nphone and those who had one or more natural teeth\nwere asked to attend a nearby dental clinic where\nstandardized oral epidemiological examinations were\nconducted by one of 30 dentist-examiners trained in the\nwas undertaken to investigate potential non-participa-\ntion bias, with the results showing that the survey\nunderestimated some estimates of oral disease, although\nthe degree of underestimation was no more than three\npercentage points for measures of prevalence. Full\ndetails of sampling, examination protocol and survey\nparticipation have been described elsewhere.10\nPublished data from the United States came from the\nwere interviewed in their homes;7 88.4 per cent\ncompleted the oral health examination that was\nconducted by dentist-examiners trained in the survey's\nprocedures.\nThe Fourth German Oral Health Study (OHS) was a\npopulation-representative cross-sectional study held in\nInformation was collected by a self-complete question-\nnaire and a clinical dental examination. A total of 4631\nsurvey participants completed both the clinical dental\nexamination and sociological survey components of\nthe German OHS. The examination participation rate\nwas 63.1 per cent, but extensive non-response analysis\nallowed an increase in the rate for core information to\nThe UK Adult Dental Health Survey (ADHS) used a\nstratified sampling design to select adults aged 16 years\nand over living in the UK in 1998.9 It consisted of\na face-to-face interview to collect information on\nthe respondent's oral health behaviour, attitudes and\nopinions; and for dentate respondents, a home dental\nexamination. Seventy-four per cent of all eligible\nhouseholds agreed to take part in the 1998 UK ADHS,\ninterviewed dentate adults were clinically examined.\nComparisons were made using nine clinical indicators\nof oral health status: the percentage of people who were\nedentulous; the mean number of teeth present per person;\nthe percentage of people who had one or more decayed\nteeth; the mean number of coronal decayed surfaces per\nperson; the percentage of people who had one or more\nfilled teeth; the mean number of coronal filled surfaces\nper person; the percentage of people with a DMFT\n(decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth) index\ngreater than zero; the percentage of people who had at\nleast one tooth with clinical attachment loss (CAL) of\n4 mm or more; and the percentage of people with at least\none tooth with periodontal pocketing of greater than\n4 mm. Four oral health behaviours were reported: the\npercentage of people who flossed one or more times a\nday; the percentage of people who used a mouthwash\nonce or more a day; the percentage of people who had\nvisited a dentist in the last 12 months; and the percentage\nof people whose last dental visit dentist was five years ago\nor more.\nThe Australian NSAOH data were used as a refer-\nence so that comparisons could be made between the\ndifferent age groups reported for the remaining three\ncountries. For example, after excluding the child and\nadolescent age groups from the published results of the\nFourth German Oral Health Study, adults of ages 35\u00ad\nwere computed for the same age groups. The random\nvariability caused by the sampling was expressed by\ncomputing 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the\nAustralian data and statistically significant differences\nwere made in comparison with the US, the only other\ncountry to have reported 95% CIs. In those instances, a\ndifference was judged to be statistically significant if the\n95% CIs did not overlap.\nStatistical analyses of the Australian data were\nperformed using SAS/SUDAAN software (Version 9.1;\nSAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).\nLA Crocombe et al.\nRESULTS\nEdentulism prevalence was negligible below the age of\n35 years in all four countries. For other age groups,\nAustralians had the lowest prevalence of edentulism for\nall comparisons except with US adults aged 75 years or\nmore. Within that age category, prevalence in Australia\nexceeded the US by 4.4 per cent, though the difference\nwas not statistically significant (Table 1).\nThe mean number of missing teeth per person was\nlower in Australia than in the UK and Germany\n(Table 2). When compared with the UK, the greatest\nrelative difference was observed for 16\u00ad24 year olds\nwhile the smallest difference was between people aged\n65 years or more. When compared to the US, Austra-\nlians had a lower mean number of missing teeth for age\ngroups under 50 years of age, and a higher mean\nnumber of missing teeth for those 65 years of age or\nolder.\nIn all age groups with the exception of 35\u00ad44 year\nolds, the percentage of people with one or more\ndecayed teeth was more than twice as high in the UK\ncompared to Australia (Table 3). Germany had a lower,\nwhilst the US had a similar, percentage of people with\none or more decayed teeth compared to Australia.\nAustralians up to the age of 65 years had a lower mean\nnumber of coronal decayed surfaces when compared to\ntheir counterparts of the same age in the US population,\nTable 1.

Australia ranked first or second based on dental\nflossing, use of mouthwash and frequency of dental\nattendance.\nDISCUSSION\nThis analysis found that Australia ranked first or second\namong the four countries studied when they were\nranked according to nine dental clinical indictors\nand four oral health-related behaviours. The finding\nis in contrast to the OECD 2000 Health Data, where\nAustralia ranked below the same three countries in\nthe DMFT index of 35\u00ad44 year olds and edentulism\nprevalence among people aged 65 years or more.5\nThese new comparisons indicate that Australia's oral\nhealth relative to other countries is not as poor as that\nreported in OECD data.\nOne explanation for the differing findings was that\ntooth loss had declined precipitously in Australia over\nthe last 10 years.11 The decline has been attributed to\nthe passing of generations born in the first half of the\n20th century when extraction of all teeth was widely\nSecondly, the contention that Australia had relatively\npoor oral health was partly based on the DMFT index\nwhich has inherent problems. For example, it suffers\nfrom its mixing of disease and treatment13 and is based\non the assumption that all filled teeth were carious prior\nto the filling which may lead to the overestimation of\nthe caries experience as expressed by the FT component\nThirdly, the OECD Oral Health data suffer from\nlimitations in their representativeness because the data\nwere not always based on nationally representative\nIt is paradoxical that dental visiting behaviour was\nbetter in the UK than in Australia or the US (Table 6)\nwhereas the UK had the poorest outcomes on three\nindicators of tooth loss. Nor did frequent dental\nattendance in the UK reflect more frequent oral hygiene\npractices. The debate on appropriate dental visiting\nthough the most frequent dental attenders had the\nadvantage over the less frequent attenders of having a\nhigher number of functioning teeth, they also had the\ndisadvantage of higher levels of dental disease experi-\nence. Later, regular attenders were found to have to\nbe less likely to suffer acute symptoms and require\nemergency treatment.17\u00ad19 The debate on the time\ninterval between check-ups continues to this day with a\nrecently published Cochrane Review20 finding that\nthere was insufficient evidence to support or refute\nthe practise of encouraging patients to attend for dental\ncheck-ups at six-monthly intervals. It included only\none study in the review and that study provided limited\ndata for dental caries outcomes and economic cost\noutcomes. The debate could have been hampered by\nthe fact that oral health-related quality of life was\nnot measured. Studies have demonstrated association\nTable 6.

One explanation could be the\naccuracy of the measure. Albander and Rams24 argue\nthat at a population level, probing pocket depths are of\nlimited value for the appraisal of the extent and severity\nof periodontal diseases. They note that an increase in\nprobing depth may not be associated with attachment\nloss, that the probing depth at a given site is a change-\nable measure particularly as the patient ages, and that\nprobing depth does not provide an accurate measure of\nperiodontal tissue destruction accumulated over a per-\nson's lifetime as reliably as assessments of periodontal\nattachment level. However, in this study attachment loss\nwas also greater in the Australian to the US population.\nAustralians had a higher mean number of missing\nteeth for older age groups than US citizens. An argument\nthat the difference in attachment loss may be due to a\nhigher number of retained teeth being accompanied by\nan increase in the prevalence of attachment loss is not\nvalid because it is in the older age groups that clinical\nattachment loss is expected to be found. Knowledge\nconcerning risk factors for periodontal destruction is\nstill being accumulated.25 It may be that US citizens\nare more aware of periodontal health than Australian\ncitizens but any proposed explanation of the difference\nin periodontal health between Australia and the US at\nthis stage would be speculation.\nSeveral limitations hampered the comparisons made\nin this analysis. The surveys were conducted as much as\n10 years apart, with Australia's being the most recent.\nThis favoured Australia in measures of tooth loss which\nhave declined markedly in all countries. However, that\neffect would be relatively small in comparison with\nGermany or the US. A second problem was the use of\ndifferent examination protocols among the surveys. For\nexample, Australia used a modification of the NHANES\nprotocol for periodontal assessments, whereas the UK\nand Germany used other protocols. However, this is\nlikely to be less problematic for measures such as tooth\nloss and fillings, where protocol variations produce\nonly minor differences in population levels. A further\nlimitation was that 95% CIs were reported only for the\nUS, so it was not possible to determine if Australia\ndiffered to a statistically significant degree from the UK\nor Germany. Finally, data were available from only\nthree other western countries, so it was not possible to\ndetermine if previously reported OECD rankings for\nother countries might have changed as dramatically as\nshown here for Australia.\nDespite these limitations, there was a generally\nconsistent pattern to indicate that Australian adults\nranked relatively highly in their oral health compared\nwith the other three countries. Certainly the findings\nwere in marked contrast to the previous OECD\nrankings, cited for 2000. This turnaround highlights\nhazards that probably are inherent in ranking national\ndata when their representativeness cannot be assured,\nand when that data were from markedly different time\npoints. Indeed, we were unable to find the original\nOECD report that ranked 29 nations, a report that is\nsaid to be available on CD-ROM.3 Hence, it was not\npossible to verify the magnitude of differences that may\nhave existed between countries in that report, and it\nwas impossible for us to verify sampling details or other\nmethodological features of the studies used to generate\nthe data.\nCONCLUSIONS\nOral health of Australian adults as measured by 13\nclinical and behavioural indicators, was better than\nindicated in previous OECD Health data.\n"
