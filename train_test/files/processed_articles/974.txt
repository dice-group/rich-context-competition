Overweight\nwas de\u00aened as age-sex-speci\u00aec body mass index (BMI) greater than the 85th percentiles from the US NHANES I data (collected\nin 1971 \u00b1 1974), which is recommended by the WHO for international use. Maturity adjustments were made using population\ndifferences in median age at menarche (MAM), calculated using the status quo method. MAM was 12.8 in the WHO reference\npopulation, 13.7 in China, 13.2 in Russia, and 12.6 in the US (NHANES III data). Maturation age-matched BMI cut-offs were\nused to compute the adjusted prevalence. We also compared population-adjusted results with individually adjusted results in\npost-menarcheal American girls (based on each girl's AAM) and in pre-menarcheal girls (based on breast stage).\nRESULTS: Maturity adjustment increased the estimated prevalence of overweight in China and Russia where girls mature later\nthan the reference population, and decreased it in the NHANES III sample. The unadjusted and adjusted prevalence was 3.5 vs\n4.9% in the China sample, 8.3 vs 9.7% in Russia, and 29.2 vs 28.0% in the US. The adjustment had a greater effect in younger\nadolescent girls (10 \u00b1 13 y) than in older girls (14 \u00b1 18 y). In general, we found a good agreement between the population and\nindividual adjustments. Viewing the individual adjustment as a `gold standard', the population method has a high sensitivity and\nspeci\u00aecity.\nCONCLUSION: This is the \u00aerst study to assess WHO recommendations for maturation adjustment when estimating overweight\nprevalence in different countries. While the overall effects of adjustment are small, maturation status should be considered,\nparticularly when assessing young adolescents, and populations with markedly different timing of maturation relative to the\ninternational reference. Population-based adjustment is useful and practical in situations where individual maturity data are not\navailable.\nKeywords: overweight; obesity; BMI; adolescent; maturation; age at menarche; adjustment\nIntroduction\nObesity has become a worldwide epidemic and the preven-\ntion of childaadolescent obesity is recognized as a public\nhealth priority.1 \u00b1 4 Since obesity in adolescence predicts adult\nobesity and is associated with chronic diseases, it is critical to\nunderstand current trends among adolescents. However, a\nserious impediment is the lack of a widely accepted reference\nfor the de\u00aenition of adolescent obesity. Accurate estimation\nof obesity prevalence is critical for allocating health\nresources and developing effective population intervention\nstrategies, as well as for studying the causes of obesity at a\npopulation level.\n*Correspondence: Y Wang, Carolina Population Center, University of\nE-mail: youfa@email.unc.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nSince direct measurement of adipose tissue is not feasible\nin large-scale studies or population monitoring programs,\nsimple anthropometric indices such as the body mass index\n(BMI  kgam2) are recommended to identify overweight chil-\ndren and adolescents.5 \u00b1 7 Further, the World Health Organi-\nzation (WHO) and the International Obesity Task Force\n(IOTF) advocate universal BMI references for international\nuse.6,7 The WHO de\u00aenes `at risk of overweight' as an age-sex-\nspeci\u00aec BMI greater than the 85th percentile of a reference\nbased on the US First National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I) data collected in 1971 \u00b1\nOne dif\u00aeculty in using the WHO reference for interna-\ntional comparisons is that it re\u00afects the average distribution\nof maturational status in the US population in the early\n1970s. However, remarkable differences in growth and\nmaturation patterns exist within and between different\npopulations.8 \u00b1 11 Failure to account for population and indi-\nvidual differences in maturation status may lead to misclas-\nsi\u00aecation of youths who differ markedly in rates of growth\nand maturation from the reference population.12\nAmple biological and epidemiological evidence suggests\nthat maturation should be considered when studying obesity\nin adolescents, especially when comparing obesity preva-\nlence in different populations. First, a large literature shows\nthat maturation status is associated with fatness.12 \u00b1 20 In fact,\nfatness and BMI are more closely correlated with maturation\nstage (or development age) than chronological age.14,21\nMaturational timing affects current body fatness and has a\nlong-term effect.20 \u00b1 26 Earlier maturing children and adoles-\ncents have greater rates of increase in fatness and a higher\npercentage body fat and BMI than later maturing youth of\nences in maturation and growth patterns characterize differ-\nent populations. For example, median age at menarche\n(MAM) can be as early as 12 \u00b1 13 y in some wealthy popula-\ntions and as late as 14 \u00b1 16 y in many developing coun-\ntries.9,27 Third, as noted by the WHO committee, although\nadolescent anthropometry varies remarkably worldwide,\nmany of the differences observed according to chronological\nage categories are attributable to variation in maturational\ntiming, and the difference diminishes when maturation is\nconsidered.6 For example, in their study of a large cohort of 9\nto 10-y-old American girls, Morrison et al18 found that black\ngirls were fatter than whites, but after adjusting for matura-\ntion stage, no racial difference in BMI and skinfold thickness\nremained. Finally, there has been a secular trend toward\nearlier maturation. MAM has been fallen from 16 \u00b1 17 y in\nThe WHO recommends conditioning the interpretation\nof adolescent BMI on sex, age and maturation.6 However, it\nis often not feasible to collect detailed individual maturation\ndata in large-scale studies, especially in developing countries.\nTherefore, research on population-level adjustment for\nmaturation differences is of great interest and has important\npublic health implications. To our knowledge, no attempt\nhas been made to explore the implications of the WHO\nrecommendations. The purpose of the present study is to\nexamine how accounting for maturation affects prevalence\nestimates of overweight in adolescents. We use population-\nbased information to adjust for the difference in maturation\nrates between the reference and study populations, based on\nrecommendations from the WHO committee.6 Data from\nadolescents in China, Russia and the United States are used\nto illustrate the method. Our results provide valuable infor-\nmation for the interpretation of published results on adoles-\ncent obesity from different countries, especially for\ncomparisons between developed and developing countries.\nMaterials and methods\nData and study samples\nNon-pregnant girls aged 10 \u00b1 18 y who were surveyed in\nChina, Russia and the US were studied.

Anthropometric measure-\nments were carried out by trained health workers who\nfollowed standard protocol similar to the NHANES protocol\ndeveloped by NCHS. Weight was measured in light indoor\nclothing to the nearest tenth of a kilogram with a beam\nbalance scale. Height was measured without shoes to the\nnearest tenth of a centimeter, using a portable stadiometer.\nInformation on menarcheal status and age at menarche\n(AAM) was collected for girls aged 16 or less.

Detailed descriptions\nof the sample design and operation of the survey were\npublished elsewhere.31 Standardized protocols were used\nfor all interviews and examinations. Data on weight and\nheight were collected for each individual. Maturation status,\nincluding breast stage for girls, was evaluated by physicians\nin the physical examination. Menarcheal status and AAM\nwere reported by individuals over 8 y of age. A sample\nof 2014 adolescents was included in our analysis. Based on\nself-reported race and ethnicity information, subjects\nwere classi\u00aeed into three groups: non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, and `other', which includes Hispanics,\nNative Americans and Asians.\nDe\u00aenitions of overweight. We used the WHO reference to\nde\u00aene overweight as BMI  the age \u00b1 sex-speci\u00aec BMI 85th\npercentile, which was based on the US NHANES I data\npresented only in whole years, we \u00aetted BMI cut-offs to age\nusing a polynomial speci\u00aecation. The curve had a nearly\nand the predicted BMI cut-offs and the original WHO cutoffs\nmatched perfectly. An important advantage of using the\npredicted values is that decimal ages of subjects could be\nused to make more precise individual adjustments, but this\nmight slightly lower our prevalence estimates compared to\nusing the original WHO BMI cut-offs.\nMedian age at menarche. Menarche is the most widely\nused indicator of sexual maturation in girls, and is typically\nused for comparison of maturation rates between popula-\ntions. We used the status quo method with probit analysis to\ncalculate MAM for each sample. For American girls, we also\ncalculated median ages at breast stage 2 (MABS2) as recom-\nmended by WHO.6 The status quo method is recommended\nto estimate MAM (or MABS) from cross-sectional data.8,9\nOnly data on each individuals' current age (in years rounded\nto 0.1 in our analysis) and menarcheal status (yes or no) are\nneeded. Compared with retrospective methods based on\nindividuals' reported AAM, this method suffers less from\nrecall errors.\nEstimated MAM in each sample is shown in Table 1, along\nwith results from other studies. American girls matured ear-\ngirls (MAM  13.2). Sample weights were used in the estima-\ntion of MAM in the Russia and US samples to account for\nsampling design. China survey sample weights were not\navailable. As shown in Table 1, in general, our \u00aendings\nwere consistent with previous studies in China and\nRussia.32 \u00b1 36 Very few nationally representative studies on\nAAM in American girls have been published during the\npast decade, although evidence indicates that MAM declined\nmedian age at breast stage 2 (MABS2) declined to 10.0 and\n8.9 in white and black girls, respectively.40 The MABS2 for\nthe NHANES III population was 10.2. For the WHO reference\nsame as our calculated MAM using NHANES I data. The\ndifference in MAM between the reference population and\nstudy samples was 0.9 for Chinese girls, 0.4 for Russian girls,\nMethod used to estimate overweight prevalence adjusting\nfor maturation\nBased on the WHO committee's recommendation, we pro-\nposed a population-based adjustment method. The WHO\ncommittee recommends that `when population estimates of\nmaturational status are available, age-speci\u00aec means or med-\nians for anthropometry may be adjusted for rates of matura-\ntion that differ from the reference data.' They recommend\nusing data on two maturational events when available, one\nto signal the beginning of the adolescent spurt and another\nto indicate that peak height velocity has been attained. In\ngirls, the recommended markers are breast stage 2 and\nmenarche.6 In our method, to calculate adjusted overweight\nprevalence, we \u00aerst estimated each subject's maturation age\n(MA) as her chronological age (CA) plus the differences\nbetween the MAM in the reference and study populations\n(MA  CA  (12.8 7 MAM)). To follow the WHO's recom-\nmendation, for American girls, MABS2 was also used\nour results and other related \u00aendings, we chose to adjust for\nthe maturation differences as 0.9 for Chinese girls\nto evaluate each individual's nutritional status. This method\nwas called `population adjustment' and the calculated preva-\nlence, as `adjusted prevalence', while the prevalence using CA-\nmatched BMI cut-offs was called `unadjusted prevalence'.\nThe purpose of the adjustment was to account for sys-\ntematic differences in maturation rate between populations\nor over time. This method made two main assumptions.\nFirst, MA is a more important determinant of BMI and\nfatness than CA, which is supported by longitudinal stu-\nassume that the entire population distribution of menarch-\neal age is shifted. Although in general our analyses with the\nNHANES I and III data supported this assumption, it is\npossible that true MA was over- or underestimated in some\nadolescents or groups. However, we expect this happened\nrandomly, and as a result, the potential mis-classi\u00aecation of\nMA would not systemically bias the prevalence estimate.\nMaturity adjusted overweight prevalence\nY Wang and L Adair\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nComparison of population and individual adjustments\nAlthough it is desirable to have a `gold standard' of adoles-\ncent overweight to validate our method, such a standard is\nnot currently available. Therefore, to evaluate the popula-\ntion adjustment, we compared population adjustment with\nan adjustment based on each individual's maturation status\n(called `individual adjustment'). Each girl's AAM (for postme-\nnarcheal girls) or breast stage (for premenarcheal girls) was\nused to calculate her MA relative to the reference population\n(called `MA2'). Then, MA2-matched BMI cut-offs were used\nto determine each individual's overweight status. This gen-\nerated `individually adjusted prevalence'. We expect the indivi-\ndual adjustment to be more accurate. This comparison was\npossible only for American girls, who had good individual\nmaturation data on breast stage and AAM.\nFor each post-menarcheal girl, MA2 was calculated as:\nreference; AAM was corrected by  0.5 since age in whole\nyears at last birthday was reported). For pre-menarcheal girls,\nsince median age at each breast-stage was not available from\nNHANES I data we used a mixed population \u00b1 individual\nadjustment. For each subject, by comparing her CA and\nbreast stage (eg stage n) to the median age for that stage\n(MABSn) in NHANES III girls, we estimated her MA relative to\nall NHANES III girls (  CA  (MABSn 7 CA)  MABSn). The\nunderlying rationale is that girls who were at the same breast\nTable 1 Median age at menarche (MAM, y) in the WHOaNCHS reference population, China, Rusia, and the USa\nPopulation MAM (s.d.)

MABS could not be calculated for\nstage 1 using the status quo method, therefore only preme-\nnarcheal girls at breast stage 2 and over were studied. Then,\nassuming pubertal events (ie breast stages), occurred on\naverage 0.3 y earlier in NHANES III girls than the reference\ngirls, we calculated each girl's MA2 (  MABSn  0.3).\nData analysis\nWe compared population adjusted and unadjusted preva-\nlence of overweight in all of the samples, and individual and\npopulation adjustments in American girls. For the compar-\nison of population and individual adjustments, results from\nindividual adjustment were used as the `gold standard', and\nsensitivity and speci\u00aecity of the population method were\nestimated.41 Since our main purpose is to examine how the\nadjustment may affect estimates of overweight prevalence,\nbut not to estimate the accrual prevalence of overweight,\nsampling weights were not used to compute the prevalence.\nAnalysis was performed by using SAS Version 6.12 (SAS, Cary,\nNC, USA) and Stata Version 6.0 (Stata Co., College Station,\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study populations\nCharacteristics of the study populations are summarized in\nTable 2, which shows that the American girls were taller and\nheavier than the Chinese and Russian girls.\nPrevalence of overweight\nChinese girls. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 3, the\nadjusted overweight prevalence (4.9%) was higher than the\nun-adjusted prevalence (3.5%). The adjustment had a greater\neffect among younger adolescents (10 \u00b1 13 y) than older\nadolescents (14 \u00b1 18 y), and in urban than in rural girls. The\nadjusted prevalence in urban areas might have been over-\nestimated since MAM in urban girls was only 0.4 y later than\nthe WHO reference. If urban and rural prevalence rates were\nadjusted separately to account for the urbanarural difference\nin maturation, the adjusted prevalence in urban girls was\n2.9%, which was still higher than the unadjusted prevalence\n(2.6%). Among rural girls, the difference between the unad-\njusted and rural-speci\u00aec adjusted prevalence (3.8% vs 5.3%)\nwas even greater.

Girls classi\u00aeed as overweight with the adjust-\nment but not overweight without the adjustment (n  10)\nwere slightly younger (13.2 vs 14.2 y) and signi\u00aecantly thin-\nTable 2 Characteristics of the three samplesa\nCharacteristic\nRussian girls\nAmerican girls\naMean (s.d.)\nFigure 1 Unadjusted and adjusted overweight prevalence in Chinese and Russian girls.\nMaturity adjusted overweight prevalence\nY Wang and L Adair\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nclassi\u00aeed as overweight with both methods (n  62).\nAmerican girls. Table 4 shows that the adjusted over-\nweight prevalence was lower than the unadjusted preva-\nlence, but the difference was relatively small (28.0% vs\n29.2%). Younger girls and girls of `other' race were most\naffected by the adjustment. Black girls were the least\naffected, although their MAM (12.2) was the most different\nfrom the reference population (12.8). One possible reason for\nthe racial difference in the effect of adjustment is due to their\ndifferent BMI distributions. A girl whose BMI was already far\nabove the 85th percentile cut-off was not likely to be reclas-\nsi\u00aeed with adjustment. Black girls tend to have higher BMI,\nand a higher percentage are above the 95th percentile of the\nreference.3\nComparison of population and individual adjustment.\nTables 5 and 6 compare the population and individual\nadjustments in American girls. Overweight was more pre-\nvalent in post-menarcheal than in pre-menarcheal girls. In\ngeneral, there was a good agreement between the two adjust-\nment methods. The individual adjustment was assumed as a\n`gold standard', although this is open to question. In post-\nmenarcheal girls, the population-method did not adjust for\nmaturity as adequately as the individual-adjustment. The\nagreement was better in older girls (96.8% of these girls\nwere classi\u00aeed into the same categories by the two methods,\nie overweight or not) than in younger girls (94.3%, P ` 0.05).\nNevertheless, the population-method has a high sensitivity\ngirls, the two adjustments produced the same estimate of\noverall overweight prevalence, although the gap between the\ntwo adjustments was bigger in black girls than other girls.\nThe sensitivity and speci\u00aecity of the population adjustment\nwere 88.8% and 96.2%, respectively. The results also support\nour expectation that, although the population adjustment\nmay misclassify some individuals, it could give an un-biased\nestimate of overweight prevalence.\nDiscussion\nThe increase of obesity in children and adolescents has\nbecome a major public health concern worldwide. While\nmore studies now follow the WHO's recommendation6 to\nde\u00aene overweight in adolescents, no study has addressed the\nfeasibility of the WHO's recommendation of conditioning\nthe assessment on maturation status to account for popula-\ntion differences in maturation rates. With three large sam-\nples from nationwide surveys in China, Russia and the US,\nour results show that using the WHO BMI reference without\nconsidering maturation difference, overweight prevalence is\nunderestimated in populations where adolescents mature\nTable 3 Adjusted and un-adjusted prevalence (%) of overweight among Chinese and Russian girls, by residence\nand age\nChinese girlsa Russian girlsb\nSampleaCharacteristic Sample size Un-adjusted Adjusted Differencec Sample size Un-adjusted Adjusted Differencec\nAge (y)\naAdjusted prevalence was calculated using MA(  CA 7 0.9) matched BMI cut-offs; while un-adjusted prevalence was\ncalculated using CA matched BMI cut-offs.\nbAdjusted prevalence was calculated using MA(  CA 7 0.4) matched BMI cut-offs.\ncDifference  adjusted prevalence 7 unadjusted prevalence.\nTable 4 Adjusted and un-adjusted prevalence (%) of overweight in\nCharacteristic Sample size Unadjusted Adjusted Differenceb\naAdjusted prevalence was estimated using MA(  CA  0.3) matched BMI cut-\noffs; while un-adjusted prevalence was calculated using CA matched BMI cut-\noffs.\nbDifference  adjusted prevalence 7 unadjusted prevalence.\nMaturity adjusted overweight prevalence\nY Wang and L Adair\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nlater than the reference population (American girls in the\nearly 1970s), and slightly overestimated where adolescents\nmature earlier. In general, the effects of the adjustment vary\nby the magnitude of the difference in maturation between\nthe reference and study populations as well as the degree of\nobesity of the study population. The adjustment increased\nthe estimate of overweight prevalence from 3.5% to 4.9% in\nthe China sample, from 8.3% to 9.7% in Russia, while it\nAlthough the absolute differences between adjusted and\nunadjusted prevalence rates are small, they can be important\nwhen considering the health burden of overweight.

For example, if we\nassume the rate could be applied to all adolescents, this\nin Russia, and 0.55 million in the US are likely to be\nWe used population level maturation information (based\non MAM) to adjust overweight prevalence estimates, since\nmenarche is the maturity measure most likely to be available\nfrom population studies of nutritional status. Menarcheal\nstatus can be reliably reported by individuals, and the status\nquo method can be easily applied to estimate MAM.\nMenarcheal status data are easier and cheaper to obtain\nthan maturity measures such as breast stage or skeletal age\nthat rely on a physical examination. When menarcheal data\ncannot be collected, the MAM from comparable samples can\nbe used in the adjustment. This is an important strength of\nthe population method, especially in many developing\ncountries.\nWe found a much greater impact of the adjustment\namong young adolescents (10 \u00b1 13 y) than among older ado-\nlescents (14 \u00b1 18 y). Since more young adolescents are likely\nto be misclassi\u00aeed, greater efforts should be made to consider\ntheir maturation status. There is likely to be an age at which\nmaturation adjustment should no longer be done, but this\nmay differ across populations. Greater variation in matura-\ntional status is likely among younger girls, but by age 16 the\nvast majority of girls in most populations will be post-\nmenarcheal and fully mature. Among older, late maturing\ngirls, the maturity adjustment is unlikely to have an effect on\noverweight prevalence estimates, since later maturing girls\ntend to be taller and lighter than early maturing girls.\nFurthermore, the rate of change in BMI decreases with age,\nso that the BMI 85th percentile cut-offs are more similar\nTable 5 Comparison of population and individually adjusted overweight prevalence in American girlsa\nPost-menarcheal girls (n  924) Pre-menarcheal girls (n  524)\nPopulation Individually Population Individually\nUnadjustedb adjustedc adjustedd Unadjustedb adjusted c adjusted e\nRace\nAge\naThese comparisons were only conducted in girls aged 10 \u00b1 16 y who had completed data on reported age at menarche\nand breast stages.

The method is based on the assump-\ntion that the entire population under study is shifted in its\nmaturational timing. A comparison of the distribution of\nmaturation events in US NHANES I and III girls supports this\nassumption, but there is a large variation within every\npopulation, and thus some individuals or subgroups may\nbe misclassi\u00aeed. For example, the population method is\nlikely to over-adjust early maturing individuals but under-\nadjust late maturers in a population where maturation is\ndelayed relative to the reference population. However, if\nthese two types of misclassi\u00aecation happen randomly, the\noverall prevalence estimate may not be biased.\nIt is desirable to have a `gold standard' of adolescent\noverweight to validate this method and to test the concerns\naddressed above. However, such a standard is not available.\nTherefore, we compared population- and individual-based\nadjustment in American girls as a means to evaluate the\npopulation method. The individual-based adjustment may\nbe better since it utilizes each individual's maturation infor-\nmation (age at menarche and breast stage) more ef\u00aeciently.\nIn general, our results suggest a good agreement between the\npopulation and individual assessments, although the popu-\nlation-method is more conservative in postmenarcheal girls.\nAssuming the individual-based adjustment is a `gold stan-\ndard', the sensitivity and speci\u00aecity of the population-based\nmethod is quite high. Nevertheless, the individual adjust-\nment has several weaknesses. For post-menarcheal girls, age\nat menarche was only reported in whole years of age.\nFurther, reported age at menarche may also suffer from\nrecall bias. In premenarcheal girls, our breast-stage adjusted\nmaturation age may not be an ideal indicator of an indivi-\ndual's `real' maturation age, since breast stages have no clear\nboundaries and each stage lasts several months to b 1 y. In\naddition, it may be more dif\u00aecult to identify breast stages in\nobese and non-white girls.18 Well designed studies with\nbetter measures of adolescent overweight and maturation\nare desirable to validate the proposed method for maturity\nadjustment.\nIn conclusion, our study shows that maturation adjust-\nment can make a difference when using the WHO reference\nto measure adolescent overweight. This suggests that differ-\nences across groups and populations should be considered\nwhen measuring child and adolescent overweight and obe-\nsity. Currently there is a tendency to uncritically use (or\nrecommend) BMI cut-offs for de\u00aening overweight and obe-\nsity without fully recognizing their limitations and potential\nfor misclassi\u00aecation. Based on biological and epidemiologi-\ncal considerations, maturational timing should be taken into\naccount when making international comparisons of over-\nweight prevalence. This is especially true when the study\npopulations differ markedly in maturation rates. Ideally, we\nwould like to have an international reference that can be\neasily conditioned on maturation status, but such a reference\nis not likely to be available in the near future. Maturity\nadjustment using the population method is feasible and\nwill produce less biased estimates of overweight prevalence,\nand thus a better basis for international comparisons.\n"
