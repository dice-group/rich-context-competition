    "abstract": "Abstract\nA Cornsweet edge creates the perception of a step in surface lightness between two adjacent\nregions of identical mean luminance due to a gradient on both sides. We might imagine that in a\nconcatenated set of these gradients, the lightness steps would accumulate, but they do not.\nHowever, a diamond pattern, with each diamond filled with an identical luminance gradient\ndoes give a cumulative Cornsweet effect. Here, we offer an illumination explanation for why\nthe cumulative effect is visible in the diamonds but not in the basic ramp grating and we\ndemonstrate that when the diamonds drift, they produce a strong brightening effect (depending\non the direction of the motion) and a dimming aftereffect. These effects are consistent with the\nlocal luminance gradients and not with the global lightness shift of the cumulative Cornsweet\neffect.\n",

In this case, the luminance decreases on both sides of the edge, mimicking\n(although not exactly) the changes that would happen to a fixed reflectance edge under an\nillumination gradient (see also Figure 4). In contrast, in the ramp grating, the luminance step\nis constant all along the edge, giving no additional weight to an illumination explanation.\nAlthough both the ramp grating (Figure 1) and the diamonds (Figure 2) are equally\nwell modeled as the sum of stepped reflectances and an illumination gradient, there is less\nevidence for the illumination gradient in the ramp grating, tipping the balance against the\ndecomposition.\nFigure 2. Cumulative Cornsweet effect. Each individual diamond on the left appears to have fairly uniform\nlightness which then increases from darker for the bottom diamonds to lighter for the upper ones\n(Watanabe, Cavanagh, & Anstis, 1995). This global lightness shift is opposite in direction to the actual\nluminance gradients within each diamond. In addition, the cumulative Cornsweet effect is more evident on\nthe left for the pointy diamonds than on the right for the squat diamonds.\nFigure 1. Left: Cornsweet effect. When two rectangles, each with the same light to dark gradient, abut,\nthere appears to be a uniform lightness step from one to the other (Cornsweet, 1970). Right: Several of these\nrectangles are concatenated to form a sawtooth luminance profile. Here, the lightness steps do not\naccumulate beyond the first step.\nThe diamond stimulus also reveals the relative roles of the two luminance gradients \u00ad the\ncumulative, global lightness change between diamonds and the opposite, local gradient within\neach diamond, in producing motion-induced brightening effects.We have previously shown\nthat drifting ramp gratings produce strong brightening and darkening effects (Cavanagh &\nAnstis, 1986) and that adaptation to such temporal brightness ramps produces dramatic\n1993). We now show that the moving diamond patterns produce the same effect as the\nmoving ramp grating and give similar aftereffects (Movie 1). Since these effects are in the\nsame direction as those for the ramp stimulus that has no global gradient, we conclude that\nthe local luminance gradients in the diamonds drive the brightening effects even though the\ngradient has been perceptually suppressed.\nFigure 4. Left: A set of identical spiky bars each having the same luminance gradient also produces a\ncumulative lightness increase as the mean luminance across the borders increases along the border, as it does\nin the diamond pattern. Middle: As the angle of the spikes becomes shallower, the cumulative effect weakens.\nRight: It disappears when the angles are flat as in a ramp grating in Figure 1.\nFigure 3. The diamond stimulus can be seen as a combination of a set of diamonds with uniform reflectance\n(left image), stepping up in reflectance from left to right, viewed under an illumination gradient that gets\ndarker from left to right (right image). The result, on the right, can be a set of identical diamonds with the\nsame mean luminance and the same internal gradients. The visual system then decomposes this into uniform\nreflectances increasing from left to right seen under a gradient of illumination.\nCavanagh and Anstis 3\nIn conclusion, we suggest that the diamond stimulus and other equivalent stimuli\n(Figure 4) produce cumulative Cornsweet effects because they strongly support an\nillumination gradient interpretation. They do so because the luminance changes along the\nedges make the paired gradients on both sides mimic the luminance difference across a fixed\nreflectance edge under a luminance gradient. This holds even though the luminances in the\ndiamond stimulus differ by a constant amount rather than by a constant ratio as they should\nfor an illumination effect. In contrast, the edges in a ramp grating have one fixed luminance\ndifference along them and give simply one datum point in favour of an illumination gradient.\nFinally, both motion-induced brightness effects were consistent with the direction of the\ninternal gradients of the diamonds despite the perceptual reduction of the gradient. This\nshows that the actual luminance gradient generates the effect and that the perceived\nlightness gradient does not contribute to motion-induced brightness effects.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: S.

Part 2: Here, when the motion reverses, the direction of the\ngradients are also reversed to keep the lightening and darkening effects on the same side throughout.
