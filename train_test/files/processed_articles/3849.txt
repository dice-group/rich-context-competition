Harlow's (1958) study on attachment in infant macaques was the\nfirst to show that physical warmth can replace interpersonal warmth, to a certain extent:\ninfant macaques that were reared with a warm cloth-surrogate were less socially damaged\nby their maternal deprivation than those raised without such warmth (a finding that has\nparallels with humans; see, for example, Bargh and Shalev, 2012). In their study of 2012\nBargh and Shalev were able to demonstrate that people tend to self-regulate their feelings\nof interpersonal warmth with applications of physical warmth. This shows that humans can\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nalso use physical warmth to replace interpersonal warmth. It also demonstrates the inter-\nrelatedness of interpersonal and physical warmth.\nIn addition to behavioural findings, a number of neuroanatomical studies have also\nlent support to the notion of a link between physical and interpersonal warmth (and\nsimilarities here between human and non-human primates). Craig, Chen, Bandy and\nReiman, through lesion studies, for example, suggested that temperature sensation is\nlocated in the insular cortex, rather than the parietal somatosensory cortices utilized in\ntouch sensation (Craig et al., 2000). This study also posited a link between physical warmth\nsensation and emotional warmth sensation. Craig et al. suggest that the right anterior insula\nis \"integral to mentally generating the image of one's physical state that underlies basic\nemotions\", including interpersonal evaluations (Craig et al., 2000, p. 188). This finding is\nsupported by Stephanie et al.'s (2011) studies on individuals whose insulae were implanted\nwith electrodes. By stimulating the electrodes in this region they were able to isolate\nseveral functionalities of different insula regions, finding that stimulating the dorsal\nposterior insula elicited \"a subgroup of warmth...sensations\" (Stephanie et al., 2011, p.\nIn recent years neuroimaging techniques have also been used to add to our\nknowledge of the relationship between interpersonal and physical warmth. Sanfey, Rilling,\nAronson, Nystrom and Cohen (2003) viewed the brains of participants using fMRI during\nan economics game known as the Ultimatum Game. They found significant activity in the\nanterior insula during decision-making events in these games, indicating that interpersonal\ntrust evaluations, (previously shown by Winston, Strange, O'Doherty and Dolan (2002) to\nbe heavily based upon \"warmth\" criteria), may play a part in economic decision making.\nThis finding is supported by van den Bos, van Dijk, Westendberg, Rombouts and Crone's\n(2009) research which demonstrated insula cortex activation during games involving trust\nand reciprocation. Moreover, the existence of a \"hard-wired\" link between interpersonal\nwarmth and physical warmth is also supported by Meyer-Lindenberg's (2008) research into\nborderline personality disorder where abnormal activity in the insula cortex mirrored\nabnormal patterns of trust in relationships. These findings implicating the insula with both\ninterpersonal warmth evaluation and interpersonal trust evaluation support Williams and\nBargh's (2008, p. 606) suggestion that interpersonal warmth information forms the \"first\npass\" of evaluating interpersonal trust. Thus, manipulating a participant's evaluation of\ninterpersonal warmth, by controlling their sensation of physical warmth, may conceivably\ninfluence an individual's evaluation of interpersonal trust. This is the premise on which the\ncurrent study is based.\nKang, Williams, Clark, Gray and Bargh (2011) provide the most persuasive\nevidence for the dual functionality of the insula in processing interpersonal and physical\nwarmth sensations. Using fMRI scans during economic games, their experiment found that\nthe left-anterior insular region was activated more strongly when making a trust decision\nwhen primed with a cold object than with a hot object. In contrast to Williams and Bargh's\n(2008) findings that both hot and cold objects alter interpersonal trust, Kang et al. (2011)\nfound that the insula only showed increased activity when participants were primed with\nthe cold object. This might suggest that it is only the cold condition that alters interpersonal\nwarmth evaluation; warm conditions may simply reflect the baseline level, although this\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nwas not investigated further.\nThis recent neurobiological evidence is supportive of earlier developmental and\nconsequent evolutionary explanations of the connection between physical warmth,\ninterpersonal warmth and cooperation. Asch (1946) found that the presence of the word\n\"warm\" or \"cold\" altered participant's impressions of an ambiguously described person.\nAsch (1946) further argued that interpersonal warmth factors are important in the\nevaluation of trust. Trust evaluations are a fundamental aspect of cooperation and\nreciprocation, and have been suggested to be fundamental to the evolution of non-kin\nrelated cooperative behaviours (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981). Developmental theorists,\nsuch as Mandler (1992) and MacDonald (1992), state that warmth is an important aspect of\nearly childhood experiences of caregivers, necessary for healthy childhood development. It\nis argued by Williams and Bargh (2008) that these influential early experiences of warmth\nare associated with other feelings of warmth at a later date. They state that, \"[due to] these\nfrequent early life experiences with [a] trustworthy caregiver, a close mental association\nshould develop between the concepts of physical warmth and psychological warmth\"\n(Williams and Bargh, 2008, p. 606). It is further argued that feelings of physical warmth in\nlater life may \"activate memories of other feelings associated with warmth [such as trust\nand comfort]\" due to their earlier association with primary caregivers (Williams and Bargh,\nAllman (2000) argued that as the brain evolved from a relatively simple organ into\nan incredibly complex system, pre-existing areas of the brain were co-opted into\nperforming more complex tasks. Thus, the insula may have originated as a module for\nmeasuring physical temperature, and later, as complex social structures emerged, became\nadapted to evaluate \"friendliness\" and \"trustworthiness\", as suggested by Williams, Huang\nand Bargh (2009). Williams, Huang and Bargh's (2009) \"cognitive scaffolding model\"\nattests that due to having common cognitive media, physical concepts such as temperature,\nand abstract concepts such as interpersonal warmth, are experienced similarly. They also\nargue that cognitive scaffolding is an innate, natural process linked to evolutionary\nmechanisms. Although Wilson (2002) argued that there was little evidence for the\nscaffolding of abstract constructs, subsequent support for this theoretical model is found in\nresearch into numerous abstract psychological concepts; such as time (Boroditsky, 2000),\nmoral disgust (Wheatley and Haidt, 2005) and good and evil (Meier, Hauser, Robinson,\nWilliams and Bargh (2008) predicted that, due to the developmental association\nbetween physical and emotional warmth, and the apparent dual function of the insula in\nprocessing both physical and emotion warmth information, tactile experiences of warmth\nshould \"activate concepts or feelings\" associated with interpersonal warmth. In their study,\nthey demonstrated that by priming a participant with a warm or cold object, the\nparticipant's judgment of a fictitious individual's personality was \"warmer\" (more\ngenerous, trustworthy and friendly) or \"colder\" (less generous, trustworthy and friendly)\nrespectively. Williams and Bargh (2008) were rigorous in their separation of interpersonal\nwarmth criteria from other, non-warmth related criteria. This allowed them to determine\nthat the effects of temperature priming were solely related to interpersonal warmth, and not\nmerely a mood \"halo\" effect. However, by their use of criteria semantically linked to\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nwarmth or cold, it is difficult to determine whether their results were actually due to\nincreased feelings of interpersonal warmth, or whether the participants were merely\nassociating the feelings of physical warmth with the wording of the questions. Further\nresearch is required to validate their findings.\nIn addition to testing the effects of temperature priming on interpersonal warmth\nevaluation, Williams and Bargh (2008) tested its effects on generosity. They found that\nparticipants primed with a cold object were more likely to choose a gift framed as a gift for\nthemselves than a gift framed as a gift for a friend. The opposite was found when\nparticipants were primed with hot objects. This demonstrates that temperature priming may\nwell have an effect on real-world behaviours, such as generosity.\nKang et al. (2011) also studied the effects of temperature priming on games of\neconomics. They found that participants primed by touching a cold object were less willing\nto invest with an anonymous partner compared to participants primed with a hot object.\nThis provides evidence of prior temperature affecting cooperation: influencing participants\nto cooperate less in the cold condition, and vice versa. Furthermore, it demonstrates\ntemperature priming having a tangible effect on real-life choices. In a similar study\nIJzerman and Semin (2009) also found that when participants were seated in a warm room\nthey felt interpersonally closer to the experimenter than those seated in a cold room, and\nthat this effect was bi-directional: participant's perception of room temperature could be\naltered by placing them closer to other participants, simulating interpersonal closeness.\nThis provides further evidence that temperature priming affects interpersonal evaluations. It\nis a fair assumption that these feelings of interpersonal closeness are likely to induce higher\nlevels of cooperation in participants.\nHowever, previous research provides conflicting evidence as to how initial acts of\ngenerosity affect decisions later on. Garapin, Llerena and Michel (2011) found that when\nparticipants play a game of Prisoner's Dilemma, after playing a donation game, they were\nless likely to cooperate. This suggests that prior instances of generosity may result in lower\nlevels of generosity at a later date, which may have a significant effect on a repeated\nmeasures design. Thus, we can expect participants in a second game to be less cooperative\nthan in their first game. Also, we may expect participants experiencing hot temperature\npriming first to score lower than participants experiencing cold temperature priming first,\nas participants may be more cooperative in the first round. Conversely, Axelrod and\nHamilton (1981) suggest that prior instances of defection will be punished by further\ndefection. From this, we may predict that in conditions where participants experience cold\ntemperature priming first, cooperation will be less likely in the subsequent hot round than it\nwould have been if the hot round was first due to the predicted higher likelihood of\ndefection in the cold condition.\nThe research reviewed suggests that there is a close connection between the\nsensation of physical warmth and the sensation of interpersonal warmth. However, only\nKang et al. (2011) have directly studied the effects of temperature priming on cooperation;\na study where participants were required to take part in an abstract investment game which\nmay have been somewhat removed from their day-to-day experience of cooperative\ndecision making. In the current study we make use of \"iterated prisoner's dilemma\", a well-\nestablished method of investigating tendencies to cooperate (or defect) within the field of\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nhuman behavioural ecology (Workman and Reader, 2008). Given that this game is played\nby two participants many times with both having the opportunity to reward or penalize their\npartner for previous decisions it is more likely to mirror real-life cooperative decisions than\nthe task used by Kang et al. In light of the findings of Kang et al., that hot temperature\npriming influenced participants to be more cooperative than participants who were\ntemperature primed with a cold object, the current study makes use of iterated prisoner's\ndilemma to examine the inter-relatedness of physical warmth and interpersonal warmth,\nand its potential to influence trust decisions, by testing the effects of temperature priming\non reciprocation between two participants, with tangible rewards for either cooperating or\ndefecting.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe participants comprised of 60, 19-29 year old students from a British university,\nforming 30 pairs, recruited through opportunity sampling. To counterbalance the\nexperiment, 15 pairs were randomly assigned to the hot-first condition while the remaining\n15 pairs were randomly assigned to the cold-first condition. Six pairs were male and 24\nwere female. These were split evenly between the two conditions to control for the effects\nthat gender may have on cooperation (Kerr and MacCoun, 1985). As Axelrod and\nHamilton's (1981) explanation of reciprocation, and the subsequent development of the\niterated Prisoner's Dilemma, depend on individuals being capable of reciprocation at a later\ndate, participants were paired with either friends or housemates. This ensured that there\nwas ample opportunity for reciprocation of cooperation at a later date.\nMaterials\nThe experiment measured how temperature priming affects the level of cooperation\ndisplayed by participants. Participants were temperature primed by holding hot or cold\nobjects during the two conditions of the experiment respectively, forming the two\nindependent variables. The level of cooperation displayed by the participants was measured\nusing the total score obtained by each pair in a game of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The\napparatus used in the experiment consisted of four cards, two of which had \"co-operate\"\nprinted on them and two had \"defect\". One of each was given to each participant so they\ncould cooperate or defect without revealing their answer to their partner beforehand. Gel-\nchemical hand warmers were used as the hand-held hot objects and freezer packs were used\nas the cold objects. The game of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma was used to measure levels of\nreciprocity. This measure was chosen because it has been proposed that it is a model for\nreal-world reciprocation, supported by Axelrod and Hamilton's (1981) research on game-\ntheory.\nIncentives, in the form of small chocolates or sweets, were given to persuade\nparticipants to engage in the game. These incentives fulfilled the criteria for an iterated\nPrisoner's Dilemma points system: when both participants finish with equal scores, each\nparticipant received two sweets, for a total of four. However, when one participant finished\nwith more points than the other, they received three sweets and their partner received none.\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nThis provides both an incentive to work together and a temptation to defect, and would\nmore accurately represent real-world cooperation. L\u00f6nnqvist, Verkasalo, and Walkowitz\n(2011) found that when a game of Prisoner's Dilemma was incentivized, participants were\nless generous.\nProcedure\nParticipants were required to complete two consecutive games of iterated Prisoner's\nDilemma. During the first game, both participants held either a hot object first (hot-first\ncondition) or a cold object first (cold-first condition). During the second game, their held\nobject was reversed, creating a repeated measures design. Thus, the hot-first condition was\nrun as: hot first, cold second; and vice-versa for the cold-first condition. For each pair in the\nhot-first condition, another pair was placed in the cold-first condition to counterbalance the\ndesign. Whether the participants were placed in the hot-first or cold-first condition was\nrecorded in order to investigate whether prior co-operation had any effect on subsequent\ndecisions. As this experiment sought only to discern whether there is a difference between\nhot temperature priming and cold temperature priming, not how they change from baseline\nrates of cooperation, there was no control condition.\nTo play the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, participants place a card stating \"co-\noperate\" or \"defect\" onto the table face-down. Once both participants have selected their\noption, participants were prompted to turn over their card to reveal their decision. This\nensured that neither participant knew what the other had chosen prior to making their own\ndecision. The score was recorded after each round. Participants repeated this for a total of\nfive rounds while holding the hot or cold object, depending on whether they are in the hot-\nfirst condition or cold-first condition. They then repeated this procedure holding the\nopposite object from the first game. The number of rounds to be played was not revealed to\nthe participants. Instead, they were told that the number of rounds to be played is random\nand has been determined beforehand, and that the experimenter will announce when the\ngame has finished. This is necessitated by the condition of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\nthat states that if individuals can foresee a distinct end to the game, the most effective\nstrategy changes from one of mutual cooperation to one of constant defection (Axelrod and\nAs Russel and Fiske (2008) found that participants judged competing targets as less\nwarm than cooperating targets, care was taken to use neutral language, avoiding language\nthat would suggest the participants were in a competition against each other, or that they\nwere to cooperate with each other. For instance, language such as \"you will be playing\nagainst\" was replaced by \"you will be playing with\". The interactions between the\nexperimenter and the participants were scripted to ensure parity across all cases.\nbetween individuals occur through kin-altruism. In this experiment, participants were\ncontrolled for degree of relatedness by excluding pairs who are related to one another.\nFurthermore, Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) suggest that the primary driving force behind\ncooperation between non-kin is reciprocal altruism. They state that for reciprocal altruism\nto function, the possibility of future meetings, and future reciprocation, between individuals\nmust be high. To ensure this mechanism functions for participants, they were controlled for\nTemperature priming and cooperation\ndegree of familiarity by pairing participants with friends.\nThere is a large body of research suggesting that males and females approach\ncooperation differently, either due to biological factors (Buss 1989; Buss and Schmitt 1993;\nvan Vugt, De Cremer and Janssen, 2007) or to socio-cultural processes (Sell and Kuipers,\n2009). Kerr and MacCoun (1985) found that when participants played a cooperation game\nwith male partners, both men and women were less cooperative. In order to control for this\neffect, participants were controlled for gender by grouping them into same-sex pairs. This\nalso suggests that male-male pairs may be less cooperative than female-female pairs.\nProvided there are an equal number of male-male pairs in the hot-first condition and the\ncold-first condition, this will not need to be controlled for.\nAs IJzerman and Semin (2009) found that the ambient temperature of a room can\naffect participants' perception of interpersonal warmth, the experiment took place indoors\nat room temperature. IJzerman and Semin (2009) also found that the distance between\nparticipants affected ratings of interpersonal warmth. To control for this, participants were\nseated a set distance of one meter from each other. This distance was decided upon as it is\nbetween the upper and lower limit for conversational distance between friends in the\nUnited Kingdom, as discussed in Stratton, Tekippe and Flick (1973). Krauss, Huang and\nKeltner (2010), found that touching another person can promote cooperation between\nindividuals. In order to prevent this from affecting the data, participants were not allowed\nto touch each other for the duration of the experiment. Furthermore, participants were not\nallowed to inform each other of their decisions during the experiment.\nEthical issues\nThis experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Bath Spa University in\naccordance with BPS guidelines.\nResults\nThe descriptive data revealed a difference in mean scores across the hot and cold\nconditions. As shown in Table 1, the mean scores indicate that participants score more\nhighly in terms of cooperation following the hot priming condition.\nTable 1. Mean pair hot (H) and cold (C) cooperation scores (and standard deviations) over\nfive rounds of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma\nAs the data collected meet the requirements for parametric tests, a repeated\nmeasures ANOVA was conducted to investigate the effects of hot and cold temperature\nOrder Mean SD N\nTemperature priming and cooperation\npriming on pairs' combined scores over five rounds of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.\nThe between factors variable was whether the sequence for pairs was hot followed by cold\nor cold followed by hot trials. The within factors variable was cooperation scores following\nhot or cold priming. The scores for the hot condition were significantly higher than the\nscores for the cold condition (F1,28\ncold or cold preceded hot (F1,28\ntemperature priming would result in higher frequency of cooperation than cold temperature\npriming was supported.\nBreakdown analyses\nIt was found that male-male pairs did not cooperate to a significantly different\ndegree than female-female pairs, indicating that sex did not have an effect on frequency of\ncooperation (see Table 3). Further analysis found that practice effects did not significantly\naffect participant's scores, as the mean for the total pair first round scores of 15.70 and the\nmean for the total pair second round scores of 14.93 were not significantly different (see\nTable 4). Also, it was found that whether participants experienced hot temperature priming\nfirst or cold temperature priming first did not significantly affect the results. The mean total\npair scores of 30.53 for the hot-first condition and 30.73 for the cold-first condition were\nnot significantly different (see Table 5).\nAfter converting the data into binary format, with a higher hot score than cold being\nrepresented by 1, and a higher cold score than hot being represented by 0, it was found that\ntwice as many of the participants cooperated more frequently in the hot condition than the\ncold condition. This is demonstrated in Table 2.\nTable 2. Frequency of Higher Hot Scores and Higher Cold Scores (n = 30)\nFrequency\nCold Score Higher 10\nBoth the scores for the hot condition and the cold condition were negatively\nskewed, with hot scores having a skewness of -0.76 and cold scores a skewness of -0.32.\nHowever, these are within the tolerances for parametric analysis. The kurtosis values of the\nhot score and cold score were 1.84 and -.32, indicating a normal distribution. There was\none outlier in the data, with a hot score of 18 and a cold score of 11. However, these scores\nare both within the existing range of participant's hot scores (11-19) and cold scores (11-\n18) respectively. Thus, this outlier was not excluded from analysis.\nAn independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the total pair scores for\nmale-male pairs and female-female pairs. This test was conducted to evaluate Kerr and\nMacCoun's (1985) suggestion that individuals are less cooperative when paired with male\npartners, and its potential effect on the data. Total pair scores were found by combining\neach participant's score in a pair over both hot and cold conditions and adding it to their\npartner's. It was found that there was no significant difference between male-male pairs\n.105 (one-tailed) (see Table 3). The magnitude of the differences in the means (mean\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nvariation between males and females is due to chance. This does not support the research\nprediction that female-female pairs will cooperate more frequently than male-male pairs.\nThis allows us to treat male-male pairs and female-female pairs as equal for comparison\nbetween hot scores and cold scores.\nTable 3. Difference in Means between Male-Male and Female-Female Total Pair Scores (n\nTotal Pair Score\nTo determine whether practice effects affected participant's frequency of\ncooperation, a paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare participants' mean first\ngame scores to participants' mean second game scores, disregarding which condition was\nin effect. Although the scores for the first game (M=15.70, SD=1.80) were higher than the\nscores for the second game (M=14.93, SD=1.84) (see Table 4), this difference was not\nsignificant: t(29) = 1.81, p = .08 (two-tailed). The magnitude in the difference of the means\nvariation in first game scores and second game scores is down to chance. Therefore, the\nprediction that there would be a difference between participant's scores in the first round\nand second round was not supported. This indicates that practice effects were not a\nconfounding variable in the data.\nTable 4. Difference in Mean Scores between the First and Second Game Scores (n = 30)\nGame Score\nTo determine whether the order in which participants experienced temperature\npriming affected participants' frequency of cooperation, an independent-samples t-test was\nconducted comparing the total pair scores for the hot-first condition to the total pair scores\nfor the cold-first condition. The scores for the hot-first condition were calculated by\nsumming each pair in the hot-first condition's total score over both the hot condition and\nthe cold condition. This gives a total game score for each of the pairs in the hot-first\ncondition. The scores for the cold-first condition were calculated using the same method. It\nwas found that there was no significant difference between the hot-first condition\n.85 (2-tailed, see Table 5). The magnitude in the difference of the means (mean difference\nthe hot-first condition and the cold-first condition is down to chance. Therefore, the\nprediction that there would be a different rate of cooperation in the hot-first condition and\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nthe cold-first condition was not supported and the two conditions may be treated as equal\nfor the final statistical analysis.\nTable 5. Difference in Mean Scores between the Hot-First and Cold-First Conditions (n =\nTotal Pair Score\nFinally, the \"hot score\" and \"cold score\" of the participants were analyzed using a\npaired-sample t-test. The \"hot score\" was found by combining each participant's total score\nover every round in the hot condition and adding it to their partner's total. This gives a\ncombined score for each pair in the hot condition. The \"cold score\" is found using the same\nprocedure in the cold condition. As the hypothesis predicted that the hot condition would\nresult in higher rates of cooperation, a one-tailed test was used to analyze the data.\nTo assess the normality of the sample, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality\nwas conducted on the hot scores and cold scores. As the significance of this statistic is >.05\nwe can assume the sample meets the assumptions of normality required to conduct a paired\nsamples t-test (see Figures 1 and 2). The scores between pairs are independent from one\nanother, as each experiment was conducted consecutively, preventing one pair's score\ninfluencing another's.\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nFigure 1. Frequency of Cold Scores (n = 30)\nFigure 2. Frequency of Hot Scores (N = 30)\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nDiscussion\nStatistical analysis of the data found that pairs scored significantly higher in the hot\ncondition (M = 15.90) than in the cold condition (M = 14.77), indicating greater frequency\nof cooperation. There was no significant difference found between male-male pairs' and\nfemale-female pairs' mean scores, although male-male pairs did score slightly higher. This\nsuggests that differences in cooperation between the sexes were due to chance, which\nallowed male-male pairs and female-female pairs to be treated as equal in the statistical\nanalysis.\nPrevious research provides conflicting evidence as to which condition would\npromote higher cooperation, the hot-first condition or the cold-first condition. As discussed\nearlier, Garapin et al. (2011) suggest that prior instances of generosity may result in lower\nlevels of generosity at a later date, suggesting a lower frequency of cooperation in the hot-\nfirst condition than the cold-first condition. However, Axelrod and Hamilton's (1981)\nresearch suggests the opposite effect. In order to investigate this, the hot-first and cold-first\nconditions were analyzed. No support was found for either suggestion as the hot-first\ncondition and cold-first condition did not differ significantly. Furthermore, comparative\nanalysis of the first games and second games found that they were not significantly\ndifferent, suggesting practice effects did not significantly affect participant's scores either.\nThese findings support the initial prediction that participants would be more\ncooperative after being primed with hot objects and less cooperative after being primed\nwith cold objects. This is in keeping with Kang et al.'s (2011) finding that participants were\nless willing to donate to an anonymous partner in an economics game if they were primed\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nwith cold objects than if they were primed with hot objects. This finding is also supportive\nof Williams and Bargh's (2008) finding that temperature priming participants with hot\nobjects resulted in more generous behaviour. Hence it is suggested that, as in these previous\nstudies, experiencing physical warmth leads directly to increased feelings of interpersonal\nwarmth and, in turn, to cooperation in the current study. It might however be suggested that\nthere is a simpler explanation. It is possible that the cold priming condition leads to a\nreduction in the likelihood of acting cooperatively since, during our ancestral past, cold\nambient temperatures would have led to an increase in thermoregulatory burden. This\nsecond explanation is difficult to refute, but since it is clear that our ancestors would have\nbeen dependent on conspecifics during periods of stress and that a lack of cooperation may\nwell have led to the removal from future reciprocal aid relationships (Trivers, 1971; 1985;\nsee also Schilbach et al., in press) we feel that this alternative explanation is a less likely to\naccount for our findings.\nThe discovered effect of temperature priming on cooperation also provides indirect\nsupport to the theory that there is a common neurological medium for the perception of\nphysical warmth and interpersonal warmth in the brain (Allman, 2000). The support is\nindirect as the experiment did not measure insula activity during the economics trust game,\nthe connection is an assumption based on previous research by Kang et al. (2011) and\nStephanie et al. (2011). However, it adds to the body of evidence demonstrating a clear\nconnection between physical warmth sensation and interpersonal warmth evaluation.\nFurthermore, it demonstrates a connection between physical warmth sensation and\ninterpersonal trust evaluation, which Williams and Bargh (2008) consider is partially\ndependant on interpersonal warmth evaluation. This experiment's findings also provide\nindirect support for Mandler (1992) and Williams et al.'s (2009) theory that complex\npsychological concepts are founded on more primitive concepts, otherwise known as\ncognitive scaffolding. Again, it does not provide direct support, as the iterated Prisoner's\nDilemma does not directly measure interpersonal warmth. Instead, it measures frequency of\ncooperation, which was used as a proxy for interpersonal warmth evaluation. While this\nproxy was used by Williams and Bargh (2008) and Kang et al. (2011), future research\nmight benefit from a measure directly studying the effects of interpersonal warmth\nevaluation.\nIf, as Trivers' suggests, we have a lengthy evolutionary history of reciprocation and\nan evolutionary heritage of dependence on conspecifics for our survival (Trivers, 1971;\n1985; Schilbach et al., in press) then it is likely that we have evolved a tendency to seek\naffiliation and rapport. Arguably such affiliation is likely to be based around feelings of\ninterpersonal warmth that develop as individuals engage in mutually cooperative\nbehaviours. Since there is clear aforementioned evidence that the neuroarchitecture\nunderlying interpersonal warmth has \"piggybacked\" on top of that which underlies physical\nwarmth then perhaps the inclusion of the iterated prisoner's dilemma (with its built in\nrepeated opportunities for affiliation) into behavioural studies of this nature might help to\nfurther our knowledge of this relationship.\nFuture studies of this nature might be conducted within a developmental framework\nin order to investigate the development of \"cognitive structuring\". Such a study might help\nto test Mandler's (1992) assertion that complex psychological concepts develop from\nTemperature priming and cooperation\nsimpler physical sensations in an individual's lifetime, or Allman's (2000) assertion that\nthe connection between physical and interpersonal warmth is an innate evolutionary\nadaptation, and is present from birth.\nIn conclusion, it was found that hot temperature priming resulted in a higher\nfrequency of cooperation than cold temperature priming. This is supportive of previous\nstudies into the effects of temperature priming on interpersonal warmth evaluation,\ninterpersonal trust evaluation and performance in economic games. It also provides indirect\nsupport for the dual-functionality of the insula, and theoretical models based on this\nobservation. Such findings might have implications for the evolutionary and developmental\nmodels of interpersonal warmth in relation to cooperation.\nIn conclusion, it was found that hot temperature priming resulted in a higher\nfrequency of cooperation than cold temperature priming. This is supportive of previous\nstudies into the effects of temperature priming on interpersonal warmth evaluation,\ninterpersonal trust evaluation and performance in economics games. It also provides\nindirect support for the dual-functionality of the insula, and theoretical models based on\nthis observation.
