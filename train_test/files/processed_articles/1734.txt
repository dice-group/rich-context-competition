Ev-\ntive of the US population are selected at random based on\ndemographic distributions. The participation rate in the past\nseveral cycles has ranged from 79% to 84%. Further details of\nthe NHANES sampling process are available.31\nlected audiometric data on a nationally representative sample\nof adults aged 20 to 69 years. We combined these 2-year cycles\nof data to analyze 6 years of data per National Center for Health\n20 to 69 years were selected to participate in an audiometry\ncomponent (described herein). Participants using hearing aids\nwho were unable to remove them for testing were excluded from\naudiometric testing. Participants were also excluded if they had\nsufficient otalgia to prevent the use of test headphones. The\nNHANES documentation did not report how many individu-\nals were excluded for these reasons. Sign language interpret-\ners were available if individuals with deafness were encoun-\ntered during recruitment. The eligible sample size was 5742\nparticipants. Sample weights for the combined 6-year sample\nwere computed per NCHS guidelines.31 These sample weights\naccounted for individual nonparticipation and preserved the\nnational representativeness of the subsample.\nAudiometry was performed by mobile examination center health\ntechnicians trained by a certified audiologist from the Na-\ntional Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Testing was\nconducted in a mobile examination center sound-isolated room.\nInstrumentation for the audiometric component included an\naudiometer (AD226; Interacoustics AS, Assens, Denmark) with\nstandard headphones (TDH-39; Telephonics Corporation, Farm-\ningdale, New York) and insert earphones (EarTone 3A; Ety-\nmotic Research, Elk Grove Village, Illinois).\nAirconductionthresholdsweredeterminedforeachearfrom\nfrequency was tested twice in each ear as a measure of the reli-\nabilityofthesubject'sresponses.Pure-toneaudiogramswerenot\naccepted if there was more than a 10-dB difference between the\n1-kHz test-retest thresholds.

We subdivided speech-frequency hearing loss into mutu-\nally exclusive unilateral and bilateral categories. High-\nfrequency hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone mean of 25\ndB or higher at 3, 4 and 6 kHz in 1 ear (unilateral) or both ears\n(bilateral). Using data from large population studies showing\nthat frequencies of 3 kHz or higher are the earliest and most\nseverely affected,32 we assessed the prevalence of high-\nfrequency hearing loss, which is sometimes concomitant with\nspeech-frequency hearing loss. We evaluated for possible dif-\nferences in pathogenesis or progression patterns of speech-\nfrequency and high-frequency hearing loss.\nVARIABLES\nTrained interviewers administered detailed questionnaires.33\nAge at interview was binned by decade. Race/ethnicity was\ngrouped as non-Hispanic white (hereafter, white), non-\nHispanic black (hereafter, black), Mexican American, or\nother. Education was grouped as less than high school, high\nschool diploma (including general equivalency diploma),\nand beyond high school. Four participants had missing edu-\ncation data.\nExposure to recreational noise was determined by a ques-\ntion asking if the subject had ever been exposed outside of work\nto loud noise (eg, power tools or loud music) for a mean of at\nleast once a month for 1 year (8 participants had missing data).\nExposure to weapon noise was defined as exposure outside of\nwork to the noise of a firearm a mean of at least once a month\nfor 1 year (6 participants had missing data).\nA complete smoking history included the number of years\nand the current number of cigarettes smoked per day. Pack-\nyears of smoking were computed, and participants were di-\nvided into smoking categories (nonsmoker, 20 pack-years of\nsmoking, or 20 pack-years of smoking). There were substan-\ntial missing data (n=467) on the quantity of tobacco smoked,\nso a separate category was made for persons who were ever\nsmokers with unknown pack-years of smoking (14 partici-\npants had missing data). Hypertension was defined as self-\nreported physician diagnosis, the use of antihypertensive medi-\ncation, or a mean systolic blood pressure exceeding 140 mm Hg\nor a mean diastolic blood pressure exceeding 90 mm Hg at the\ntime of examination (7 participants had missing data). Diabe-\ntes mellitus was defined as self-reported physician diagnosis,\nthe use of antihyperglycemic medication, an 8-hour fasting glu-\ncose level of 126 mg/dL or higher (to convert glucose to mil-\nlimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555), or a nonfasting glucose\nSelf-reported hearing status was determined by direct ques-\ntioning. Those who reported \"good hearing\" were coded as not\nself-reporting hearing loss, whereas those who reported \"a little\ntrouble hearing,\" \"a lot of trouble hearing,\" or \"deafness\" were\ncoded as self-reporting hearing loss. Participants usually re-\nsponded on their own behalf. Only in rare situations were proxy\nExposure to occupational noise was defined as noise expo-\nsure in the workplace (requiring speaking in a raised voice) for\nat least 3 months.

The eligible sample size for the audiometric compo-\ntional noise exposure data were available for 6.3% of the au-\ndiometrically assessed subsample. No differences in the\nprevalences of speech-frequency or high-frequency hearing loss\nwere noted between participants with and without occupa-\ntional noise exposure data.\nOf the initial sample of 5742 adults who underwent audi-\nometry, participants were excluded if there were unreliable\naudiometric measurements (ie, there was a 10-dB difference\nbetween the 1-kHz test-retest thresholds [n=444]) or if there\nwas a nonresponse code to audiometric testing (n=10), yield-\ning a final sample size of 5288 participants. No significant dif-\nferences were noted between included and excluded partici-\npants for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. In the 4-year sample of\n3853 adults (for analyses involving the occupational noise ex-\nposure variable), 326 participants were excluded (6 for non-\nresponse and 320 for unreliable testing), yielding a final sample\n\u00a92008 American Medical Association.

The prevalences of unilateral and bilateral high-\nfrequency hearing loss were 12% and 19%, respectively.\nWe observed pronounced differences in hearing loss\nprevalence by demographic characteristics. Prevalences\nof speech-frequency and high-frequency hearing loss (uni-\nlateral and bilateral) were higher among men and among\nwhite, older, and less educated participants (Table 1).\nHearing loss, particularly at high frequencies, was present\nin the third (8.5% prevalence) and fourth (17% preva-\nlence) decades of life. Participants with exposure to oc-\ncupational, leisure-time, and firearm noise had more uni-\nlateral, bilateral, and high-frequency hearing loss\ncompared with participants without those noise expo-\nsures. Hearing loss prevalences were higher among par-\nticipants with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heavy\ntobacco use (20 pack-years).\nWe evaluated whether the pattern of increasing preva-\nlence with age differed by sex or race/ethnicity (Table 2).\nTable 2.

The prevalence of high-\nfrequency hearing loss was 15% among white and Mexi-\namong black men and 2.1% to 4.1% among women of the\nsame age.

Overall tests for differ-\nences among demographic groups showed statistically sig-\nnificant differences in high-frequency hearing loss preva-\nlence at all age levels.\nWe explored the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity,\nsmoking, noise exposure, and cardiovascular risks on the\nmost prevalent form of hearing loss assessed (high-\nfrequency hearing loss) (Figure). We show separate\ngraphs for male, female, white, and black participants;\ngraphs could not be created for Mexican Americans and\nfor groups of other races/ethnicities because of a scar-\ncity of observations within data subsets. Prevalence trends\nwere similar for bilateral and high-frequency hearing loss;\ngraphs of high-frequency hearing loss are shown be-\ncause prevalences were higher and the trends easier to\ndiscern. Among white participants (male and female;\nFigure, D) and male participants (all races/ethnicities;\nFigure, A), the prevalence of hearing loss increased as a\nfunction of age and with increasing risk factors. This re-\nlationship was most apparent in white male participants\n(Figure, C), among whom high-frequency hearing loss\nyears at all risk factor levels. However, steep increases\nin hearing loss prevalence occur earlier among partici-\npants with smoking, noise exposure, and cardiovascu-\nlar risks (at age 40-49 years) compared with partici-\npants without these risk factors (at age 60-69 years).\nWe evaluated whether the observed differences in hear-\ning loss prevalence by demographic characteristics could\nbe explained by differences in noise exposure and car-\ndiovascular risks (Table 3). In multiple regression analy-\nsis, male subjects and white, older, and less educated par-\nticipants had significantly higher odds of bilateral and\nhigh-frequency hearing loss, even after adjustment for\nnoise exposure and cardiovascular risks. We subse-\nquently restricted analyses to participants without noise\nexposure (n=2293), without cardiovascular risks\n(n=1395), and without noise exposure or cardiovascu-\nlar risks (n=926). Significant associations among age, sex,\nand race/ethnicity with bilateral and high-frequency hear-\ning loss persisted (data not shown). The associations be-\ntween demographic characteristics and unilateral hear-\ning loss were generally weaker.\nGiven that the most widely cited national estimate of\nhearing loss prevalence is based on self-report,22 we evalu-\nTable 3.

Overall, the sensitivity of self-\nreported hearing loss was low (range, 41%-65%). The sen-\nsitivity of self-report was significantly higher for bilat-\neral hearing loss (65%) than for unilateral hearing loss\n(46%) or high-frequency hearing loss (41%).\nFinally, in light of concern that hearing loss is grow-\ning, particularly among young people, we explored\nwhether hearing loss prevalences changed between 1999-\n(Table 5).

Estimates based on self-report may be inaccu-\nrate given the observed tendency of some individuals to\ndeny or minimize their hearing loss. Indeed, our find-\nings corroborate that the sensitivity of self-reported hear-\ning loss for identifying audiometrically confirmed hear-\ning loss is poor. Therefore, estimates based on self-\nreported hearing loss may underestimate the true extent\nof the prevalence of a disorder. Comparisons of our preva-\nlence findings with other national estimates are difficult\nbecause of differences in the age distributions of the popu-\nlations surveyed. As would be expected, the present preva-\nyears) is lower than national estimates derived from adults\nlence may be an underestimate given that the audiomet-\nric instrumentation used in the survey had a hard upper\nlimit of hearing level, possibly causing a downward bias\nin pure-tone means.\nHearing loss is highly prevalent among persons older\nated when hearing loss first develops among large popu-\nlations of adults and whether prevalences increase gradu-\nally or nonlinearly with age. The degree to which trends\nin the prevalence of hearing loss differ by sex and race/\nethnicity has not been shown, to our knowledge. We\nfound that hearing loss, specifically high-frequency hear-\ning loss, was present in 8.5% of the youngest age group\nOur data suggest that the prevalence of hearing loss is\nincreasing among these younger age groups. In addi-\ntion, a disproportionate burden of hearing loss is expe-\nrienced by male and white (and to a lesser extent Mexi-\ncan American) participants and is manifest in the third\ndecade of life. Discrepancies in hearing loss prevalence\nby sex and race/ethnicity have been noted among chil-\ndren as well,39 suggesting that divergences in hearing level\nare set in motion at earlier life stages.\nThe results of our study also suggest that hearing loss\ndevelops first at high frequencies. Because high-\nfrequency hearing loss alters the reception of consonant\nsounds (or phonemes), it reduces speech recognition.40\nIn addition, high-frequency hearing loss may be a pre-\ncursor of further significant hearing loss affecting mid-\nand lower-spectrum speech frequencies. We found that\nindividuals are substantially less likely to report or be\naware of high-frequency hearing loss compared with bi-\nlateral hearing loss. Therefore, audiometric screening is\nTable 4.

Hearing loss prevalence progressed at an ear-\nlier age among participants with smoking, noise expo-\nsure, and cardiovascular risks. Smoking cessation,\nreduction of noise exposure, and effective treatment of\ndiabetes mellitus and hypertension may delay the onset\nof hearing loss. Addressing some of the modifiable health\nrisks associated with aging could result in further hear-\ning loss prevalence reductions.\nIn this study, approximately 50% of speech-\nfrequency hearing loss was unilateral, and 50% was bi-\nlateral. Age had a markedly smaller association with uni-\nlateral hearing loss prevalence, and male, white, and less\neducated participants had a modestly increased risk of\nunilateral hearing loss. These findings suggest that uni-\nlateral and bilateral hearing losses may be mediated by\ndistinct pathophysiologic processes among susceptible\npopulations with different risk factors. Unilateral hear-\ning loss may be associated with more focal processes, in-\ncluding thromboembolic phenomena, infections (eg, oti-\ntis media and mumps), local tumors (eg, vestibular\nschwannoma), and certain types of noise exposure (eg,\nfirearm noise).41 Bilateral hearing loss may be associ-\nated with more diffuse or systemic exposures such as oc-\ncupational noise exposure or microvascular disease. Risk\nfactors for unilateral hearing loss seem not to segregate\nas closely with age, sex, or racial/ethnic factors.\nThe NHANES data are comprehensive and nation-\nally representative; nevertheless, there are several poten-\ntial sources of bias in the data that must be considered.\nParticipants were selected at random based on demo-\ngraphic criteria; it is possible that medically unwell in-\ndividuals were more (or perhaps less) likely to partici-\npate. Approximately 8% of individuals had missing\naudiometric data, which was not accounted for by the\nsample weights; this may also have introduced bias.\nIt is important for health care providers (ie, primary\ncare physicians, specialists, and other medical person-\nnel and allied health professionals) to fully appreciate the\nmanifold and nuanced effects of hearing loss. Mild hear-\ning loss can impair speech processing, particularly if\nspeech is rapid or delivered with an unfamiliar accent or\nvoice42 or if multiple talkers in large rooms generate re-\nverberant noise.43 Therefore, verbal communication dif-\nficulties are most prominent in settings where people\ngather. Reduced social connectivity likely mediates the\nobserved associations between hearing loss and depres-\nsion, cognitive decline, reduced quality of life, and in-\nThe public health implications of our findings are un-\nderscored by the dramatic projected increases in the preva-\nlence of hearing loss. Although these data are cross-\nsectional, they offer some insight into the progression of\nhearing loss and identify particularly vulnerable groups.\nThe results of our study suggest that prevention (through\nrisk factor reduction) and screening must begin at least\nin young adulthood and that efforts should be intensi-\nfied among white and Mexican American men. Hearing\nloss reduces health-related quality of life9 and access to\nheath care.11 Minimizing this morbidity through hear-\ning loss prevention and management programs may pro-\nduce substantial public health benefits.\nCorrespondence: Yuri Agrawal, MD, Department of Oto-\nlaryngology\u00adHead and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hos-\n@jhmi.edu).\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Agrawal had full access to all\nthe data in the study and takes responsibility for the in-\ntegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Agrawal.
