Much of\nthis work follows from the features and constraints of hominid (and often mammalian)\nreproductive biology. Across mammalian species, females are the limiting factor in\nreproduction because they provide almost all of the physiological resources required for\noffspring production. Because of the large investment allocated to each offspring, females\nhave much lower potential reproductive capacities than males. Due to these factors, females\nReproductively relevant currencies\nare more discriminating in selecting mates and males expend comparatively more effort in\nAlthough the parental investment provided by women is typically higher than what\nis provided by men, male parental investment is still much larger in humans than in other\nprimates (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Geary and Flinn, 2001). Children in families without a\nfather present suffer higher mortality rates (Hill and Hurtado, 1996) and the level of\npaternal investment in offspring may enhance the offspring's reproductive success (Geary,\n2005). Preferences that men and women express when evaluating potential partners for\nromantic relationships reflect the differential roles and contributions made by men and\nwomen in successful reproduction.\nBoth women and men share preferences for partner characteristics such as kindness,\nunderstanding, and intelligence (Buss, 1989; Kenrick and Simpson, 1997), however male\nand female preferences also show divergence following reproductively relevant currencies.\nMen seek women with cues of fecundity, the potential for bearing offspring, whereas\nwomen prefer men with cues of ability and willingness to commit to long term\nrelationships and provide substantial paternal investment (Buss, 1989, 1994). Across a wide\nvariety of societies, males with higher social status and greater economic power have\nhigher reproductive success (Hopcroft, 2006).\nPartner preferences reflect evaluations of the characteristics related to reproductive\nvalue which men and women provide in reproductive relationships. The institution of\nmarriage, especially in monogamous societies, creates a mechanism for the reliable\nexchange of male and female reproductively relevant currencies. Men are conferred\n(supposedly) exclusive reproductive access to their wives, but are also expected to support\ntheir families through the contribution of resources and often the socialization of children.\nExchanges of reproductive currencies are also demonstrated by other species. In\nsome invertebrate species, males entice females with a nuptial gift, which females consume\nduring fertilization. This form of paternal investment provides substantial nutrition; in some\ncases these nuptial gifts contain energy in excess of female requirements for daily existence\nand egg production (Voigt, Michener, and Kunz, 2005). Males in some species offer\nspermatophores, a mass generated by the male containing both sperm and nourishment.\nMales in other invertebrate species, such as scorpionflies, offer captured arthropod\nprey. Females prefer the males that offer nuptial gifts and actively avoid the males who do\nnot, as males who are unsuccessful in obtaining food gifts may resort to sexual coercion\n(Thornhill, 1979). Both males and females will attempt to cheat in these exchanges.\nFemales are able to delay insemination for several minutes, and a female will attempt to\nescape if she has already consumed the nuptial gift in this time. If a male offers a very large\ngift and the female has not consumed it after 20 minutes, the male will attempt to steal the\nremainder of the gift back from the female and eat it himself or offer it to another female\nSome penguin species use pebbles to build their nests, and females will mate with\nmales in exchange for pebbles (McKee, 1992). The pebbles protect penguin nests from\nwarm spells which could otherwise cause the eggs to sit in hazardous cold water. Ad\u00e9lie\npenguins will steal pebbles from others' nests, so paired males and females will take turns\nguarding the nest and searching for pebbles. While on the search, females sometimes mate\nwith extra-pair males who provide them with pebbles. Male purple-throated carib\nhummingbirds are larger than females and will monopolize areas with the most productive\nReproductively relevant currencies\nflowers. Females will mate with males in order to gain access to these rich territories, as it\nis more advantageous than scavenging in poorer areas (McKee, 1992).\nMarket like trading of sexual activity has been observed among other primates.\nGumert (2007) reports that male to female grooming in longtailed macaques occurred\nprimarily when females were sexually active, and males groomed for a longer duration\nwhen mating or mating related activities were involved. In contrast, female to male\ngrooming was inversely related to sexual activity in the groomed males. Male to female\ngrooming appeared to be influenced by market forces; the duration of grooming was\ninversely related to the supply of females. Hawkes (1991) describes how male baboons\ntrade food for sexual access with females.\nStudies of sex for resource exchanges in other species have lent credibility to its\ndescription as \"the world's oldest profession.\" Prostitution is nearly ubiquitous throughout\nhuman history and culture, although it takes a variety of forms (see Ringdal, 2005). In\nSurvey reported paying for sex (Michael, Gagnon, Laumann, and Kolata, 1994).\nInternational sex trafficking, where many women are forced into prostitution against their\nannually (May, 2006). This figure does not include domestic prostitution.\nMany human societies have a bride price which males pay, usually to a woman's\nfather, to secure a partner. For marriages in many modern western countries, men offer\nwomen diamond rings when making marriage proposals. These arrangements entail a long-\nterm commitment to the monopolization of reproductive currencies by each partner.\nSaad and Gill (2003) identified studies showing that males are more likely to use\ngift giving as a tactical courtship ploy, but noted that none of the researchers used an\nevolutionary framework to interpret these results. Belk and Coon (1993) revealed that men\nview gift giving as a way to gain sexual favors from women and that woman viewed\nreceiving gifts from men as incurring a sexual debt. Consistent with this theme, Caplow\n(1982) found that women give holiday gifts equally to women and men, whereas men\npredominantly give holiday gifts to women. Saad and Gill (2003) propose that gift giving\ncould have evolved as a male courtship strategy. They show that men were more likely than\nwomen to have tactical motives for giving holiday gifts, such as to encourage romantic\nliaisons and to display resources as a signal of social status and investment potential.\nA community sample of ethnically and economically diverse women in Los\nAngeles County found that women who were single and living alone with at least one child\nwere more likely to exchange sex for money than those with other family compositions\n(Wyatt, Forge, and Guthrie, 1998). In contrast to the multiple clients of professional sex\nworkers, these women usually made the exchanges with the same men. The researchers\ninterpreted this phenomenon as a bartering arrangement common for people who are not\nfinancially stable and often need money to pay for living essential such as rent, food, or\nclothing.\nIn the Dominican Republic, some women maintain multiple relationships with men\nsimultaneously or over short periods of time, although these men are excluded from the\ndomestic sphere. Women who have multiple relationships are more fecund, have healthier\nchildren, and show better psychological adjustment than their peers who are\nmonogamously married (Lancaster, 1989). Because of the low earning potential of men in\nthis area, it is thought that having investment from multiple partners brings greater benefit\nReproductively relevant currencies\nthan a committed relationship with one partner. In the Ache and Bar\u00ed societies of South\nAmerica, women have sex with men who are not their social partners, especially after they\nbecome pregnant. These men become secondary fathers who are socially obligated to\nprotect and invest in the woman's children, and their contributions raise the children's\nThus, exchanges of reproductively relevant currencies between the sexes occur in\nmany animal species including primates. In humans, these exchanges take the forms of\nlong-term committed relationships, services provided by sex workers, male courtship ploys,\nand provisioning of women who are raising children and would benefit from additional\nresource support. The current study seeks to identify exchanges of reproductively relevant\ncurrencies in a sample of young adults who have not yet reached the typical marriage age\nfor their socio-demographic group, are unlikely to have children, and are not in need of\nfinancial support for basic necessities. It tests whether these tendencies are contingent on an\nacute need for provisioning, whether exchanges are attempted outside of dating\nrelationships, and whether dating or committed relationships are recognized as exchanges.\nIt is predicted that young men will attempt to solicit sexual acts from young women\nin exchange for resource provisioning, such as in scorpionflies. Young women are expected\nto hint at or offer sexual favors in exchange for male investment, as in Ad\u00e9lie penguins.\nThe reverse patterns may also be observed, where men offer sex and women offer\ninvestment, although the former pattern is expected to be significantly more common.\nWomen are also expected to be more likely to report someone else soliciting sexual favors\nfrom them with an offer of resources. Men are expected to be more likely to report another\nperson attempting to trade sexual favors for their investment. Thus, in both directions of\nattempts, it is predicted that men will be more likely to attempt to trade investment for sex\nand women will be more likely to attempt to trade sex for investment.\nMaterials and Methods\nUndergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology classes at a large\nanonymous on-line survey at their convenience. Participants were instructed to complete\nthe survey where they had privacy and would be free from distractions. Participants' mean\nage was 19 years old (SD = 1), with a range from 17 to 26 years old. Participants reported\ntheir ancestries as Western European (46%); Eastern European (24%), East Asian or\nPacific Islander (8%), African-American (4%), Latino/Latina (3%), South Asian (3%),\nNative American (2%), Middle Eastern/Arab (1%) and Other (8%). The vast majority\n(91%) of participants were born in the United States or Canada. Participants described their\nreligious affiliation as Catholic (35%), Protestant Christian (17%), Jewish (13%), Hindu\n(2%), Orthodox Christian (2%), Muslim (1%), Buddhist (1%), and Other (11%); 19% of\nparticipants indicated that they did not have a religious affiliation. Other than these\ndemographic variables, no potentially identifying information was recorded.\nThe four exchange scenario questions were: Have you ever been in a situation\nwhere you are attracted to someone and you hint or promise to do something for them or\ngive them something of substantial value, to increase your chances of having sexual\nrelations with them?; Have you ever been in a situation where you hint or promise to have\nsexual relations with someone, to increase the chance that they will do something for you\nReproductively relevant currencies\nor give you something of substantial value?; Have you ever been in a situation where\nsomeone has hinted or promised to do something for you or give you something of\nsubstantial value, to increase their chances of having sexual relations with you?; Have you\never been in a situation where someone has hinted or promised to have sexual relations\nwith you, to increase the chances that you would do something for them or give them\nsomething of substantial value? The response options were: \"No, Never\"; \"Yes, once or\ntwice\"; \"Yes, a few times\"; and \"Yes, this happens quite often.\" Data from these items\nwere analyzed with 2 (type of exchange) X 2 (participant sex) ANOVAs for Mixed-\nDesigns, one for exchange attempts made by participants and the other for exchange\nattempts made by others.\nParticipants who indicated having experienced these situations were asked\nadditional questions. For the first scenario, items included: Did you just hint that they\nwould get something or did you explicitly promise it?; Did you give them what you hinted\nat or promised?; Did you have sexual relations with them?; Did you end up having a\nrelationship with them?; Parallel items followed the other three scenarios. Responses to\nthese items were examined for sex differences with independent samples t-tests. These later\nitems were exploratory and designed to elaborate on the qualities of participants'\nexperiences.\nResults\nFor participants' attempts to make exchanges with others, the 2 (type of exchange)\nX 2 (participant sex) ANOVA for Mixed-Design indicated a significant main effect for\nOverall, participants were more likely to report trying to trade investment for sex, although\nmen were more likely to report trying to trade investment for sex and women were more\nlikely to report trying to trade sex for investment.\nFor others' attempts to make exchanges with participants, the 2 (type of exchange)\nX 2 (participant sex) ANOVA for Mixed-Design indicated a significant main effect for\nOverall, participants were more likely to report another person trying to trade investment\nfor sex with them. Men were more likely to report another person trying to trade sex for\ntheir investment, and women were more likely to report another person trying to trade\ninvestment for sex with them.\nFor exchange attempts made by respondents, 27% of males and 14% of females\nreported attempts to trade investment for sex, 5% of males and 9% of females reported\nattempts to trade sex for investment (see Table 1). Of exchange attempts initiated by others,\n14% of males and 20% of females reported that someone else attempted to trade investment\nfor sex with them, 8% of males and 5% of females reported that someone else attempted to\ntrade sex for their investment.\nReproductively relevant currencies\nTable 1.

For respondent initiated attempts to trade investment\nfor sex, males were more likely to give the other person what they hinted at or promised,\nmore likely to have sexual relations than female respondents, t(103) = 2.70, p = .008, d =\n.53. The trend for males being more likely to explicitly promise, rather than just hint at\nother persons had attempted to exchange sexual relations for respondents' investment, male\nrespondents were more likely to report having sexual relations than female respondents,\nresponses.\nFor respondent initiated attempts to trade investment for sex, 62% of cases did not\ninvolve or lead to a lasting relationship, 10% lead to a relationship of less than two months,\n17% lead to a relationship of more than two months, and 10% took place in the context of\nan existing relationship. For respondent initiated attempts to trade sex for investment, 65%\nof cases did not involve or lead to a lasting relationship, 8% lead to a relationship of less\nthan two months, 8% lead to a relationship of more than two months, and 18% took place\nin the context of an existing relationship.\nFor attempts to trade investment for sex initiated by others, 72% of cases did not\ninvolve or lead to a lasting relationship, 10% lead to a relationship of less than two months,\n6% lead to a relationship of more than two months, and 12% took place in the context of an\nexisting relationship. For attempts to trade sex for investment initiated by others, 84% of\ncases did not involve or lead to a lasting relationship, 3% lead to a relationship of less than\ntwo months, 8% lead to a relationship of more than two months, and 5% took place in the\ncontext of an existing relationship.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study supported the hypotheses that young adults consciously\nattempt exchanges in reproductively relevant currencies, and that tendencies to make each\ntype of attempt diverge following the roles of each sex in successful reproduction. Men\nReproductively relevant currencies\nwere more likely to report attempted trades of investment for sex and women were more\nlikely to report attempted trades of sex for investment. Participants also reported awareness\nof being the target of such attempts made by others and their experiences of exchange\nattempts initiated by other individuals mirrored the patterns described above. Men were\nmore likely to report another individual trying to trade sex for their investment, and women\nwere more likely to report another individual trying to trade investment for sex with them.\nMen were more likely to attempt exchanges of investment for sex than women were\nto attempt exchanges of sex for investment. This is consistent with the level of mating\neffort being relatively higher in men than in women. Also, it is highly unlikely that female\nparticipants would need to rely on males for resource provisioning. All participants were\nstudents at a highly selective university, in a modern post-industrial society. Few, if any,\nfemale participants were likely to be supporting children, and were likely to be financially\nself-sufficient or receiving necessary resources from their families and/or government\ngrants and/or loans. Socio-economic indicators were not collected for this study. However,\nin another study of students (N = 807) sampled from the same participant pool, 73% of\nrespondents' fathers and 66% of respondents' mothers had earned at least a Bachelor's\nDegree, and 87% of respondents estimated that their family's wealth was at or above the\nnational average.\nShort-term female exchanges of sexual favors for male provisioning are likely to be\nmuch more important in foraging societies and in resource-poor groups in modern countries\nthan for young students attending highly selective universities. Few individuals in the\ndemographic groups represented by participants are likely to make exchanges for survival\nand basic needs. The young age, restricted socio-economic range, and relatively low level\nof variation in life history strategies of participants lessen the likelihood that they would\nreport reproductive currency exchange attempts or experiences. A sample of older\nindividuals, especially one that is more representative of the general population, would\nlikely report higher frequencies of experiences.\nGiven the factors described above, it is remarkable that the predicted patterns were\nfound. Because of the small number of respondents reporting certain types of experiences,\nstatistical power was quite low for some comparisons. For example, only nine women and\n14 men reported that others had attempted to exchange sexual relations for respondents'\ninvestment. Only the strong sex difference in the likelihood of having sexual relations was\nstatistically significant. Other trends, which demonstrated effect sizes in-between small and\nmedium, only approached statistical significance. It is possible that additional relationships\nwould be uncovered with a much larger and/or older and more diverse sample of\nparticipants.\nThe vast majority of attempted exchanges did not take place in the context of\nexisting relationships. This indicates that participants did not view committed relationships,\nwhere sexual relations and resource provisioning are likely to take place, as explicit\nexchanges. A small proportion of exchanges did lead to relationships, especially among\nrespondent initiated attempts to trade investment for sex (27% of these cases). The fact that\nsome participants reported exchange attempts within existing relationships invites future\nresearch on individuals' tendencies to see romantic relationships as being commitments\n(perhaps facilitated by affective mechanisms) versus explicit exchanges.\nIt is possible that the lack of recognition of long-term romantic relationships as\nexchanges of reproductive currencies is part of our evolved cognitive architecture. This\nReproductively relevant currencies\nwould parallel conclusions from studies of cooperation, which indicate that tracking\nbenefits given and received is indicative of more superficial relationships. Friends who are\ninstructed to monitor exchanges experience degradation in the quality of their friendship\n(see Silk, 2003). Perhaps the \"romance\" in romantic relationships facilitates stability by\navoiding the recognition of exchanges.\nThe low success rate of exchange attempts may indicate that such explicit offers are\nnot usually an effective strategy. On average respondents reported initiating more exchange\nattempts than receiving offers of exchanges. Although the sample does not represent a\nclosed population, this finding suggests that respondents were less aware of others'\nexchange attempts than they were aware of their own. It is also possible that females\nreceive so many male solicitations on a continual basis that many incidents are easily\nforgettable.\nThis study complements the considerable literature on the evolutionary psychology\nof mating partner preferences, as well as the literature on nuptial gifts in non-human\nspecies. The promising results of this initial investigation signal the potential for future\nprojects. Further studies could examine the relationship between reproductive exchanges\nand individual life history, as well as socio-ecological context. The confirmation of\nhypothetical predictions regarding these exchanges once again demonstrates the power of\nan evolutionary framework for understanding human psychology and behavior.\nReferences\nBelk, R.W., and Coon, G.S.
