Because meat was\none of the primary sources of foodborne pathogens throughout our evolutionary history,\nFessler (2001) predicted a decrease in meat intake during the luteal phase; the current\nresearch provides the first test of this prediction. Based on the assumption that any such\nbehavioral changes would be hormonally mediated, we also investigated the effects of\nvarying levels of exogenous hormones on meat consumption by examining dietary intake in\nwomen using hormonal contraceptives. Lastly, because, from a functional perspective,\nimmunomodulation is unnecessary during anovulatory cycles and in women who are not\ncurrently sexually active, luteal phase compensatory behavioral prophylaxis was predicted\nto be absent in these contexts. Although we find that women who are sexually active eat\nless meat than those who are not, we do not find support for the core prediction regarding\neffect of cycle phase on meat consumption, nor do we find support for the ancillary\nprediction that meat consumption would be influenced by the presence or withdrawal of\nexogenous hormones. We replicate the finding that periovulatory total food intake is\ndecreased compared to the rest of the cycle and find that sexually active women show a\ngreater periovulatory decrease in food intake than sexually inactive women.\n",

However, meat is also a principal source\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nof foodborne illness, as animals carry pathogenic endosymbionts and parasites, and\nmicrobes proliferate on meat (reviewed in Fessler, 2002). Triggered by alterations in\nhormone levels, female immune functioning varies systematically across the menstrual\ncycle, potentially influencing the costs of meat consumption. In this paper we test four\nadaptationist predictions regarding meat consumption as a function of hormone levels and\nbehavioral cues of conception risk.\nProgesterone is an important hormone, levels of which vary over the course of a\nwoman's menstrual cycle, and undergo substantial changes over the lifespan. Progesterone\ncauses immunomodulation, the downregulation of certain components of immune response\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy and during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.\nThis is mediated by progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF). PIBF shifts the maternal\nimmune system towards anti-inflammatory signals.\nThe female menstrual cycle consists of functionally distinct phases marked by\ncharacteristic variations in hormonal levels. The highest levels of progesterone outside of\npregnancy characterize the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The luteal phase is the\nperiod after the rupture of the ovarian follicle in which the corpus luteum secretes\nprogesterone (Hatcher and Namnoum, 2004). During the luteal phase, the body prepares for\nconception and implantation of the blastocyst by down-regulating inflammatory immune\nresponses. This immunomodulation is an adaptation that prevents the maternal immune\nsystem from attacking the fertilized egg which is 50% unrelated to the mother. The\ndownregulation of facets of immunity during the luteal phase is apparent in a variety of\nways. During the luteal phase levels of inflammation-enhancing cytokines (chemical\nmessengers that mediate immune responses) decline, and the responsiveness of first-line\ncellular defenses, such as natural killer cells, is downregulated. Correspondingly,\nsusceptibility to a variety of pathogens increases during the luteal phase, and chronic\ninfections that are normally managed through inflammatory responses are exacerbated.\nFinally, indirect evidence of these changes in immune function can be found in cyclic\nalterations in the severity of autoimmune diseases, as conditions, such as rheumatoid\narthritis, in which excess inflammation causes pathology, are ameliorated, while those,\nsuch as lupus erythematosus, in which excess anti-inflammatory signals are implicated,\nworsen (for reviews of luteal phase changes in immune functioning, infectious illness, and\nFrom a functional perspective, the goal of luteal phase immunomodulation is\ntolerance of the half-foreign conceptus. Implantation and subsequent fetal/placental\ndevelopment are highly invasive events of a type that, in the absence of\nimmunomodulation, would normally trigger an aggressive inflammatory response.\nAccordingly, once implantation occurs, the downregulation of inflammatory responses\nescalates, regulated by rising levels of progesterone and PIBF, with corresponding\nincreases in vulnerability to infection (reviewed in Fessler, 2002). While the escalation of\nimmunomodulation in pregnancy constitutes the ultimate culmination of the process that\nbegins in the luteal phase, in this paper we concern ourselves solely with the latter.\nFessler (2001) hypothesized that, given the potential hazards of meat consumption,\na reduced attraction to meat during the luteal phase would be adaptive as changes in dietary\nbehavior could prophylactically compensate for increased luteal phase susceptibility to\nfoodborne illness. This hypothesis builds on the notion that gestational aversions to meat\nserve a prophylactic function (Fessler, 2002; Flaxman and Sherman, 2000), the idea being\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nthat the increased vulnerability to infection that is a consequence of the need to tolerate\nforeign genetic material during pregnancy is not limited to gestation, but rather also occurs,\nin an anticipatory (and somewhat muted) form, during the luteal phase, with concomitant\nchanges in susceptibility to foodborne illness.\nFluctuations in dietary behavior across the menstrual cycle have been the focus of\nnumerous investigations. However, whereas it has been repeatedly shown that females'\ntotal energy intake increases during the luteal phase, findings vary with regard to patterns\nof macronutrient consumption during this period. Some researchers find a decrease in\nprotein intake during the luteal phase (Alberti-Fidanza, Fruttini, and Servili, 1998), while\nothers report a significant luteal increase in protein intake (Chapell and Hackney, 1997;\nGallant, Bowering, Short, Turkki, and Badawy, 1987; Lyons, Truswell, Mira, Vizzard, and\nAbraham, 1989); most simply find no significant effect of phase on protein intake\n(Johnson, Corrigan, Lemmon, Bergeron, and Crusco, 1994; Tarasuk and Beaton, 1991;\nWurtman, Brzezinski, Wurtman, and Laferrere, 1989). For comprehensive reviews of the\ndiet and menstrual cycle literature (see Dye and Blundell, 1997; Fessler, 2001; and Vlitos\nThe studies cited above vary substantially in their methodology and participant\ncharacteristics. Some of these studies deal specifically with women with premenstrual\nsyndrome or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD) (Gallant et al., 1987; Wurtman\net al., 1989). More importantly, because none of these studies were designed with the\ncompensatory prophylaxis hypothesis in mind, meat intake was not examined directly;\nrather, food types were collapsed into macronutrient categories that encompass foods of\nvarying pathogenic potential.\nConsistent with the fact that menstrual cycle variation in immune functioning is\nhormonally mediated, hormonal contraceptives (HCPs) have been shown to have\nimmunosuppressive effects. The principal exogenous progestins found in commonly\nprescribed oral contraceptives ameliorate inflammatory autoimmune diseases, reduce the\nnumber of natural killer (NK) cells, and lower natural cytotoxic activity. Correspondingly,\nwomen on both conventional and triphasic oral contraceptives report more respiratory\nillness (a clear index of enhanced vulnerability to pathogens) and more gastrointestinal\ndistress (a possible indication of enhanced vulnerability to pathogens) than nonusers\n(Auerbach, Hafner, Huber, and Panzer, 2002; Scanlan, Werner, Legg, and Laudenslager,\n1995). The major exogenous progestin that has not been found to have immunosuppressive\neffects, Desogestrel (Auerbach et al., 2002), was not used by any participants in our\nhormonal contraception using sample. For an extensive review of the effects of HCPs on\nimmune functioning, see Doyle, Swain Ewald, and Ewald (2007).\nCombined HCPs (so called because they contain both the synthetic hormones\nethinyl estriadol and progestinone) essentially \"flatline\" the levels of naturally occurring\nestrogen and progesterone by using synthetic hormones to inhibit endogenous production\nof their endogenous equivalents. HCPs have two main phases: the \"active\" phase in which\nwomen are taking both synthetic hormones, and the \"hormone free interval\" or placebo\nperiod in which women receive no synthetic hormones (by either skipping HCPs entirely or\ntaking placeholder pills that contain no hormones) (Sulak, Carl, Gopalakrishnan, Coffee,\nand Kuehl, 2004; Sulak, Scow, Preece, Riggs, and Kuehl, 2000). During the active phase\nHCPs keep a steady amount of ethinyl estriadol in the woman's bloodstream, thus\nsupplying the constant hormone levels that prevent ovulation. Depending on the\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nformulation, combined HCPs supply either a steady level (e.g., Nuva ring) or a variable\nlevel (e.g., Ortho Tri-Cyclen) of progestins during the active phase. The drop in progestins\nthat occurs during the hormone-free interval triggers the onset of menstruation. Given that\nprogestins have immunosuppressive effects similar to endogenous progesterone, we\nhypothesize that exogenous progestins should reduce meat intake. Conversely, we expect to\nsee an increase in meat intake during the hormone-free interval, when there is a lapse in\nprogestin and concomitant immunosuppressive effects.\nA consideration of the importance of meat in the human diet suggests that cyclic\nfactors may not be the sole determinants of reproductive immunomodulation and,\nconcomitantly, meat consumption. Meat plays a prominent role in the lives of many\ncontemporary hunter-gatherers, constituting between 23% and 80% of the diet\n(Waguespack, 2005). Although there is debate regarding the exact manner in which meat-\neating influenced hominid evolution, as underscored by recent work focusing on the\nimportance of dietary long-chain fatty acids (see Finch and Stanford, 2004), it is reasonable\nto suppose that, for ancestral women, frequent abstention from meat eating would have\nbeen costly. In its original formulation, the compensatory prophylaxis hypothesis predicts\nluteal phase reductions in meat consumption in all nonpregnant women (Fessler, 2001).\nHowever, if the function of luteal phase immunomodulation is to facilitate tolerance of the\nconceptus, in light of the costs of this immunomodulation, we might expect such changes\nto occur only in cycles in which conception is likely. Correspondingly, the hypothesized\nluteal phase increase in costly behavioral prophylaxis should be absent during anovulatory\ncycles, and should similarly not occur in women who are not sexually active. Women who\nare using HCPs, though not ovulating, have a steady level of progestins that may mimic the\nluteal phase, and therefore also decrease meat consumption. In addition to failing to\nsegregate meat from other sources of protein, all studies to date have failed to consider the\nvariables of sexual activity and exogenous hormone administration.\nPredictions\nThe above reasoning generates four predictions regarding changes in meat intake:\n1) Rates of meat intake will decrease in the luteal phase relative to other phases of the\nmenstrual cycle.\n2) Rates of meat intake will be lower during the active phase of the HCP cycle than during\nthe hormone-free phase.\n3) Naturally cycling sexually active women will eat less meat than naturally cycling\nwomen who are not sexually active.\n4) Women using HCPs should show the same overall meat intake as sexually active\nnaturally cycling women.\nMethods\nFemale participants were recruited from the Introduction to Psychology subject pool\nat the University of Texas at Austin. Participants received course credit for their\nparticipation. All participants were treated in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the\nHuman Subjects Review Board at the University of Texas at Austin, including safeguards\nfor their privacy and confidentiality. Participants completed a background questionnaire\nregarding their height, weight, health history, sexual activity, dietary habits, allergies,\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nprescription medication, and exercise habits. Participants were also directed to a web-based\nsurvey, which they were to fill out on a daily basis, addressing dietary and other behaviors\n(the survey can be viewed at http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/dietsurvey.html). Students\nin the Introduction to Psychology subject pool are required to earn five experimental credits\n(or write a paper) as a class requirement; participants earned one experimental credit for\neach week that they filled out the dietary survey. If participants did not fill out the survey\nfor 48 hours, they were sent a reminder email with their subject number and a link to the\nsurvey. Participants were asked to complete the daily online survey at approximately the\nsame time each day. The survey addressed food intake in the last 24 hours. Survey items\nincluded questions about the number and size of servings of specific types of meat eaten\n(red meat, chicken, fish and shellfish, pork), as well as all of the other major food groups,\nincluding milk and milk products, eggs, vegetables, fruits, lentils, and starches. Participants\nwere told how much of a given food category and subcategory counted as one serving.\nAdditionally, for most food types we provided a familiar reference object or amount to help\nparticipants estimate serving sizes (e.g., one serving is 1 oz processed cheese = size of a\npair of dice or your thumb, etc.).\nParticipants\nSixty-seven participants filled out surveys. For all analyses, we excluded\nparticipants who did not fill out the survey for at least five days, participants on any type of\nhormonal medication other than combined HCPs, participants who had been taking HCPs\nfor less than three cycles, participants taking any drug that might alter immune functioning\n(e.g., anti-allergy drugs), participants taking antidepressants or anti-psychotics, and\nvegetarians. Participants were also asked about other dietary restrictions (e.g., Kosher,\npescetarian, no sugar diet, low carbohydrate diet) but, in this sample, the previous criteria\nresulted in the exclusion of all subjects who answered that they had such dietary\nrestrictions. For the analyses of predictions 1 and 2, which involved examining diet over\ntime, we excluded participants who did not fill out the survey for at least 12 days. This left\na subset of 31 total participants, of which 10 were on HCPs and 21 were naturally cycling.\nFor predictions 3 and 4, we used participants for whom we had at least five days of\ndietary information. This left a subset of 38 participants, 14 of whom were on HCPs and 24\nof whom were naturally cycling. These participants also ranged in age from 18 to 22; the\nEstimation of phase day\nUsing a combination of counting forward and counting back methodology, we\nestimated the day of ovulation and assigned each daily dietary survey to a phase. Because\nthe luteal phase is less variable in length than the follicular phase (Hatcher and Namnoum,\n2004), counting backward from the date of next menstruation is the best way, aside from\nphysiological measures, to estimate date of ovulation and thus menstrual cycle phase. Out\nof 21 participants, we had obtained both a forward and backward day of menstruation for\n17. For those survey days for which we had a date of next menstruation, we used a reverse\ncounting method to estimate phase day (Haselton and Gangestad, 2006). For those days for\nwhich we had only a date of onset of previous menstruation, we used the participants'\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nprevious cycle length to estimate cycle phase, standardizing all cycles to a 29 day cycle\nThe follicular phase was defined as the period from first day of menstruation to the\nestimated day of ovulation (days 1-14 of the cycle). The luteal phase was defined as the\nperiod from the day after estimated ovulation to the onset of subsequent menstruation (days\n15-29). Assigning each dietary survey to either the follicular or luteal phase, we then\naveraged meat intake within phases, resulting in a design in which each of the 21 naturally\ncycling participants had two scores, representing their average meat intake for each of the\ntwo phases.\nResults\nCategories of participants did not differ significantly in age or body mass index. For\nprediction 1, that rates of meat intake would decrease luteally, we employed a paired\nsamples t-test. For most results t-tests as well as effect sizes are reported. Cohen's d is a\nmeasure of effect size that is the difference between means divided by the standard\ndeviation. According to Cohen, d of 0.20 indicates a small relationship, 0.40 indicates a\nmoderate relationship, and 0.80 indicates a strong relationship (for more information, see\nCohen, 1988). The results of a paired t-test of luteal total meat intake versus nonluteal total\nmeat intake revealed no significant main effect of phase [t(20) = -1.21, pone-tailed\nCohen's d = 0.13. Separating the data into three phases (menstrual, follicular, and luteal) or\ncorrelating meat consumption with estimated progesterone levels based on cycle day (Finn\net al., 1988) also yielded nonsignificant results. One reviewer of this article suggested that a\ncomparison between the luteal and follicular phase in compiled animal-derived and non-\nanimal-derived food groups should also be made considering that foods derived from\nanimals would all ostensibly have increased pathogen prevalence. We employed a paired\nsamples t-test to investigate the prediction that animal-derived foods (dairy and all meats\nand fish) would be consumed less in the luteal phase [t(20) = -.88, pone-tailed\n= 0.10]. Non-animal foods were also consumed slightly, but also not significantly, less in\nsexually active naturally cycling women and sexually inactive naturally cycling women\nshowed any difference in luteal phase meat consumption.\nFor prediction 2, that rates of meat intake will decrease when women are in the\nactive phase of their HCP regiment, we categorized days as being active phase or hormone-\nfree phase, then averaged meat intake within each phase and performed a paired sample t-\ntest between phases. The prediction was not supported [t(9) = 0.20, pone-tailed\nFor prediction 3, that naturally cycling women who are sexually active will report\nless meat intake than those who are not sexually active, we averaged meat intake for the\nentire period in which the participants filled out surveys and compared daily food intake\nmeans using an independent samples t-test. Naturally cycling women who were sexually\nactive reported significantly less meat intake than naturally cycling women who were not\nsexually active (see Table 1, \"all meat types\"). As evident in Table 1, results were not due\nto significant differences in total servings of all food types consumed, indicating that the\npattern was specific to meat consumption.\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nTable 1: t values of the differences between average daily servings of food types between sexually active and\nsexually inactive naturally cycling women\nFood type t p\nN\n\u00a7 p one-tailed\nTable 2: Average daily intake of food types for four groups of women divided by sexual activity and\nhormone presence\nn\nmean SD min max mean SD min max mean SD min max mean SD min max\nOn hormonal contraception\nand not sexually active\nOn hormonal contraception\nand sexually active\nNaturally cycling and not\nsexually active\nNaturally cycling and\nsexually active\n Women on HCP have significantly lower total meat intake, p < .05\nPrediction 4 held that women using HCPs would show the same overall meat intake\nas sexually active naturally cycling women. We found that women on HCPs did not have a\nsignificantly different level of meat intake compared to naturally cycling sexually active\nwomen. In contrast, women on HCPs showed significantly lower meat intake than naturally\ncycling women who were not sexually active [t(24) = 2.28, pone-tailed\n0.90]. We tested to see whether sexual activity or the external administration of progestins\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nwere driving the reduction in meat intake among women using HCPs by separating\nsexually active HCP-using participants from those who were not sexually active. We did\nnot find a significant difference between sexually active and inactive women using HCP [t\n= .20, Cohen's d = 0.57]. However, because there were only three\nsexually inactive HCP-using participants, we do not place much stock in this result.\nPrevious studies have shown that total caloric intake decreases in the periovulatory\nperiod (Fessler, 2003). As an indirect measure of the soundness of our survey method, we\ntested for replication of this finding using servings as a proxy for calories. Examining days\n12, 13, and 14 of the standardized menstrual cycle of the first subset of naturally cycling\nwomen (those 21 women for whom we had at least 12 days of dietary information), we\naveraged the total servings eaten across these three days and compared this with the\naverage daily food intake during the rest of the menstrual cycle using a paired samples t-\ntest. Results reveal a periovulatory nadir in food intake [t (20) = -2.24, pone-tailed =\nCohen's d = 0.27], akin to that previously reported in the literature, suggesting that our\nsurvey method suffices to capture the phenomena of interest. Furthermore, we found that\nsexually active women were driving this effect. Among women that were not sexually\nactive there was not a significant difference between total serving intake during the fertile\nwindow and outside the fertile window though the difference was in the expected direction\n.11, Cohen's d = .22]. Among sexually active women a paired t-\ntest revealed a much greater difference in periovulatory total serving intake compared to\nthat outside the fertile window [t (10) = -2.48, pone tailed =\nDiscussion\nNeither the core prediction of the compensatory prophylaxis hypothesis regarding\nthe relationship between menstrual cycle phase and meat consumption nor the ancillary\nprediction regarding the simple effect of exogenous progestins on meat consumption was\nsupported. Support was found for the ancillary prediction that meat consumption would be\nlower in sexually active than in non-sexually active women; however, given the lack of\nsupport for the core prediction, we must entertain the possibility that some third factor is\nresponsible for this finding. That third factor could be where women lived; for example,\nperhaps women who live with their parents are more likely to eat \"home cooked\" meals\ncontaining more meat, and also less likely to be involved in a sexual relationship.\nWe found that sexual activity did not just moderate a decrease in meat intake but\nalso those women that were sexually active were driving the periovulatory nadir in total\nserving intake. As the periovulatory nadir is thought to occur in order to free up time for\nmating (Fessler, 2003) perhaps being sexually active is an environmental cue that changes\nenergy allocation periovulatorily as well as motivating women to decrease exposure to\npossible meat-borne contaminants.\nMight limitations in our methods have influenced our findings? First, the women in\nour sample were all relatively young. This is potentially relevant given that young women\nare more likely to have anovulatory menstrual cycles. We did not employ physiological\nmeasures that directly index ovulation; our null results might reflect our inability to\ndifferentiate between ovulatory and anovulatory cycles in a dataset potentially containing\nmany of the latter. However, our detection of a periovulatory nadir in food intake casts\ndoubt on this explanation and analogous functionalist reasoning dictates that the midcycle\nDifferences in dietary intake among women\nreduction in food intake ought not to occur in anovulatory cycles--if our dataset captured a\nsufficient number of ovulatory cycles to reveal the periovulatory nadir, it ought to have also\nshown a luteal reduction in meat consumption.\nWe coded as \"sexually active\" women who reported having had sex in one of the\ndaily surveys completed. However, if immune responsiveness is moderated by sexual\nactivity, then we might reasonably expect a time lag between the cessation of sexual\nactivity and reversion to baseline levels of immune functioning and concomitant\ncompensatory prophylactic behavior. This suggests that the predicted correlations could be\ndisrupted if some of the women whom we coded as not sexually active had been active\nuntil recently.\nEquivalently problematic, given that University of Texas at Austin demographics\nsuggest that many of our participants were both unmarried and culturally conservative, it is\npossible that some women who reported not being sexually active in fact were. This may\nhave been particularly problematic in the case of the three women who stated they were not\nsexually active but were using HCP, keeping in mind that we excluded participants who\nhad any reproductive problems that would have warranted therapeutic use of HCP.\nIn a separate study, not reported here, conducted at the same time and using the\nsame sample as this study we found support for the compensatory prophylaxis hypothesis\nin the form of systematic alterations in disgust sensitivity and contamination-related\nthoughts and behaviors across the menstrual cycle (Fleischman and Fessler, 2006). It is\ntherefore possible that the core features of the compensatory prophylaxis hypothesis are\ncorrect, yet such alterations in behavior do not extend to diet, perhaps because the\nchronology of meatborne illness is such that cyclic alterations in meat consumption would\nnot provide protection from infection. The immune components that are reduced during the\nluteal phase of the menstrual cycle are mostly those that counteract parasitic or bacterial\ninfection, but foodborne parasites and pathogenic bacteria take variable intervals of time to\nmake their way from the stomach into the gut. Some common meatborne pathogens, such\nas Clostridium perfingens, take only hours to develop clinically, while others may take\nseveral days or weeks (Bloom, 2002). Additionally, many parasites and bacteria are\nopportunistic, waiting for a lapse in immunity before they begin proliferating in the gut. For\nexample, Toxoplasma gondii, a common meatborne parasite, takes many months to develop\ninto an infection, and is opportunistic. (Walker, Roberts, Ferguson, Jebbari, and Alexander,\n1997). Other common meatborne pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, are\nopportunistic and have variable incubation periods ranging from 2-70 days (St. Georgiev,\n2003). Given the long incubation periods characteristic of some of the most common\nmeatborne pathogens that pose a threat to women (see Fessler, 2002), infections from meat\nmay not have exerted selection pressure for cyclical aversion to meat. Instead, such\npathogens may have favored a lower attraction to meat in women relative to men, a\npossibility consistent with the observation that women in many societies consume less meat\nthan men, and, indeed, are more likely to be vegetarians (reviewed in Fessler, 2001).\n"
