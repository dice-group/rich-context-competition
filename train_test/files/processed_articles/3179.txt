However, it is largely\nagreed that the burden of taxes and levies should be reduced. For instance, according to\nlast year's report of the Council of Experts for the Assessment of Overall Economic Trends,\nwhich is well-known for advocating a supply-oriented economic policy, fiscal policy must\n\"... elaborate regulations on taxes and levies that do not reduce output and investment\nincentives\" (Sachverst\u00e4ndigenrat (1997), item 10). This claim rests on arguments taken\nfrom neoclassical theory, according to which relative prices distorted by taxes and levies\nlead to a misallocation of the available resources: The intratemporal misallocation of time\ninduced in the context of individual labour-Ieisure choices results in an excessively low\nlevel of employment, and the intertemporal misallocation of disposable income induced\nin the context of individual consumption-investment decisions leads to exceedingly low\ninvestment activity.l\nAgainst the background of these arguments, this paper attempts to evaluate the in\ntertemporal effects of a reduction in taxes and levies as requested of economic policy in\na calibrated Real Business Cycle (RBC) model incorporating a government sector.2 The\nmodel refiects the basic features of the institutional framework of the German system of\ntaxes and levies, i.e. an income tax imposed to finance government consumption and trans\nfer payments is supplemented by a consumption tax and levies on the wages the firms pay\nto the households. The government budget is assumed to be intertemporally balanced by\nissuing government bonds.\nThe model on which the analysis rests constitutes a synthesis of RBC models publis\nhed in the last few years which cover a broad range of fiscal policy issues. Based on the\n10n the analysis of fiscal policy in the neoclassical model of optimal growth by Cass (1965) and Ko\nin particular, Lucas (1990). Another approach using the model of overlapping generations by Diamond\n(1965) focuses on the intergenerational redistribution effects of taxation and the design of the social se\ncurity system rather than on issues of allocative efficiency. See, in particular, the book by Auerbach &\n2RBC models are quantitative dynamic general equilibrium models extending the stochastic neoclassical\nmodel of optimal growth by BlOck & Mirman (1972). An overview of the development of RBC models,\nwhich were first formulated in Kydland & Prescott (1982) and Long & Plosser (1983), can be found in the\nbook Frontiers 0/ Business Cycle Research edited by Cooley (1995).\n\nthe allocative effects of government consumption. Their studies rely on the assumption of\nallocatively neutral financing through lump-sum taxes. The allocative distortions induced\nby a taxation of factor income are analysed in Judd (1989), Greenwood & Huffman (1991),\nthe allocative effects of the introduction of a consumption tax, while levies on wages are\nintroduce an intertemporal government budget ceiling, within which the government issues\nbonds to cover its budgetary deficits.3\nWhereas Cooley & Hansen restrict the overall time path of government consumption\nto ensure an intertemporally balanced government budget, this paper introduces a fiscal\nreaction function which stabilises the government debt-to-output ratio by modelling a\nfeedback from the development of government debt to current government consumption.\nIn a simple way, this modelling addresses the fact that revenue shortfalls caused by a\nreduction in taxes and levies have to be compensated for by spending cuts in order to\nguarantee the sustainability of the government budget.\nThe paper is organised as folIows. Section 2 describes the RBC model incorporating\nthe government sector, taking into account the German system of taxes and levies. First\nly, optimal economic plans are derived for the model's economic agents, i.e. households\nand firms. The way they interact is determined by both the institutional structure of the\nmarkets and the government's fiscal policy. Secondly, this section demonstrates how the\noptimal economic plans are coordinated by market prices supporting a competitive equi\nlibrium. In Section 3, the model is calibrated with the aim of reproducing some stylised\nfacts of the German goods and labour markets which are summarised by simple statistics.\nBy means of a sensitivity analysis, these stylised facts are compared with the correspon\noptimal fiseal poliey whieh will not be dealt with in this paper.\n4 By extending RBC models appropiately, they can also be applied to issues of foreign trade and mo\nnetary poliey: For instanee, extensions covering foreign trade are studied by Baekus, Kehoe &; Kydland\nding figures implied by the calibrated model. The model is subsequently used to simulate\nand to quantify the welfare effects of various fiscal policy measures designed to reduce the\nburden of taxes and levies as requested of economic policy. Section 4 gives. a summary of\nthe findings and draws some conclusions. The Appendix explains how the data used for\nthe calibration of the model were obtained.\nDescription of the Model Economy\nThe. model economy consists of a large number of identical households and identical firms\nwhich act competitively in the economy's markets, i.e. the (real) capital market, the labour\nmarket, the government bond market and the goods market, at the beginning of the periods\nH The households rent their capital stock in the capital market and supply labour\nin the labour market. They buy a homogenous good in the goods market,\nwhich they use for consumption or for investment in capital. In addition, they\npurchase bonds issued by the government in the bond market.\nF The firms sell a homogenous good in the goods market, which they produce by\nusing the capital borrowed in the capital market and the labour obtained in the\nlabour market.\nThe economic activity of the households and firms is affected by the government's fiscal\npolicy:\nG In the goods market, the government purchases the homogenous good supplied\nby the firms, it makes transfer payments to the households, and it finances its\nspending through taxes and levies and the issuance of government bonds.\nThe government's fiscal policy is considered to be exogenous for the households and\nfirms. The volume of the bonds issued by the government depends on the fiscal balance of\nthe government budget.\nThe supply and demand decisions of the households and firms in the factor markets and\nthe goods market are coordinated by the relevant market prices of period t via a Walrasian\nmechanism. Furthermore, the endogenous pricing of the government bonds guarantees\n\nthat the volume of bonds issued by the government matches the households' demand for\ngovernment bonds.\nSince only the relative prices are determined in the real economy being considered here,\nthe homogenous good is chosen as the numeraire. The supply and demand decisions in the\nfactor markets and the goods market are then coordinated by the real factor prices, i.e. the\nprices for renting capital and labour expressed in units of the homogenous good. Assuming\nperfect competition in the markets, these prices constitute an exogenous determinant for\nthe households and firms.\nIn the following subsections, the activities of the government, the households and the\nfirms - as described under G, H and F are analysed in more detail. Subsequently, the\ncompetitive equilibrium suitable for the coordination of these activities is defined.\nAt the beginning of the periods t =0,1, ... the government purchases the amount Ge of\nthe homogenous good Qt offered by the firms in the goods market, and it makes transfer\npayments to the amount of TRt\nto the households. The government uses the purchased\ngoods for purely consumptive purposes.5\nTo finance its expenditure the government imposes:\n(a) a tax of t~ on the households' consumption Ch\n(b) a tax of\ntt on the households' factor income Tt Kt +tOt Nt minus the capital depre\nciation 0 Kt with 0 < 0 ~ 1, where Tt denotes the rental rate for the capital stock K t\nand Wt the wage rate for the labour input Nt, and\n(c) a levy of 2t:u on the wages the firms pay to the households Wt Nt; the households and\nthe firms each pay for half of this levy.\nThe wage levy can be interpreted as a contribution to an implicit social security system\nwhich makes transfer payments to the households. The gross wage rate relevant to the\nfirms - including the wage levies they have to pay - is Wt\n=(1 +t:u) tOt.\nSOn models which take aceount of government investment, see Ambler & Paquet (1994) and Baxter &\nThe government budget, comprising government expenditure and revenue, is balanced\nby issuing an amount EHl of government bonds with a single-period maturity and an\neffective return of Rt . The equation for the government budget then reads\nGt +TRt +Et =\nt~\nCt +\nt~\n[(rt - 8)]{t + 1 : tr Wt Nt\n+ 1 +tr t t + 1 +Rt .\nThe discounted government bonds Et\n+d(l + Rt ) are to be interpreted as a risk-free\npayment promise indicating that the government will transfer EHl worth of resources to\nthe households in the next period.\nSince a positive effective return leads to a continuous accumulation of government debt,\nthe budget equation for the given amount of receipts proves to be dynamically unstable\nunless government spending is adequately restricted. In other words, the unrestricted\ngovernment budget is not sustainable in the long run.\nTo guarantee a sustainable budget, we will now introduce a fiscal reaction function\nwhich models a stabilising feedback from the development of government debt to gover\nnment consumption Gt , whose autonomous component is assumed to depend linearly on\nthe output Qt via the consumption rate 9t. In particular, the reaction function is specified\nin such a manner that deviations from a lastingly balanced debt-to-output ratio (B/ Q)\nlead to a reduction in or expansion of government consumption,\nSetting the parameter 'lj; at a sufficiently high value will then ensure the stability of the\nequation for the government budget.\nSince the government transfers TRt do not play an essential fiscal role in the model\neconomy and as the assumption of identical households renders redistribution issues irre\nlevant, for the sake of convenience it is assumed that the transfers linearly depend on the\noutput Qt via the transfer rate trt,\nOwing to the linearity of the government budget equation in the aggregates Ch\n]{t, Nt,\nEt, Et+l , Gt, TRt - and due to equations (2) and (3) also in Qt - these variables can\n\nbe seen as per-capita variables. Such per--capita variables will turn out to be extremely\nuseful in the definition of the economy's competitive equilibrium given below.\n=\n\nThe vector of the exogenous fiscal policy variables Vt (gt, t~, tt, t';:, trt)', i.e. of the\nautonomous government consumption rate, the rates of taxes and levies and the transfer\nrate, is assumed to follow a stationary vector-autoregressive process with independent\nstandard-normally distributed innovations fv,t+l,\nIn the calibration of the model the autoregressive transition equation of the fiscal policy\nvariables will be fitted to fiscal data. In this connection, it is assumed that the modulus\nof the eigenvalues of the transition matrix Av lies within the unit circle. In addition, the\nmatrix Cf\" is defined to be lower triangular. The conditional covariance matrix of VtH is\nVar[VtHIVt] = Cf\" C:\".\nGiven the above specifications, the government sector is fully characterised by the\nequation for the government budget (1), the government consumption according to (2),\nthe transfers described in (3) and the autoregressive transition equation of the vector of\nfiscal policy variables (4).\nAt the beginning of each period t = 0,1, ... the households decide on how to use their\navailable resources during this period. This choice is made in the context of an intertem\nporal decision problem under uncertainty. They decide on:\nH.I the allocation of their disposable income in period t, and\nH.2 the allocation of their available time in period t.\nThe system of necessary conditions for this decision problem yields conditional decision\nfunctions which determine the households' supply and demand behaviour in the economy's\nfactor markets, the goods market and the government bond market.\nAssuming perfect competition in these markets, the decisions of the individual house\nholds do not affect the per--capita variables. In order to distinguish the individual house\nholds' variables from the per--capita variables, which is of vital importance for calculating\nthe model economy's competitive equilibrium, the households' variables will subsequently\nbe specified in smal11etters.\nIn period t the households receive capital and wage income. The capital income is determi\nned by the capital stock kt , which the households lend to the fiTms in the c,apital market for\na fee amounting to the rental rate for capital utilisation rt. The households' wage income\ndepends on the amount of labour nt which they offer in the labour market and which the\nfirms hire at a wage rate of (1 +t;V)-lWt. In addition, the households receive government\ntransfer payments totalling TRt and redeem an amount bt\nof government bonds purchased\nin the previous period.\nAfter deducting the capital depreciation 6 kt , an income tax t1 must be paid on the\nincome received. The income tax imposed on the households' capital income amounts to\ntt (rt - 6) kt, and the income tax on the wage income is tf (1 +t;V)-lWt nt. In addition, a\nwage levy rate t;V is applied to the households according to which they pay the amount of\nt;V (1 +t;V)-l Wt nt of their wage income to the government.\nThe households use the disposable income left after deducting income tax and wage\nlevies to buy the homogenous good the firms offer in the goods market. Furthermore, the\nhouseholds purchase the newly issued government bonds bt+l discounted with areturn of\n1 +Rt . The homogenous good is alternatively used for consumption Ct and investment it .\nA consumption tax is imposed on their consumption Ct to the amount of the consumption\ntax rate tf. The budget equation of the households then reads\n(1 +tt Ct +Zt + R\nGiven proportional depreciation 6 kt , the investment it increases the households' capital\nstock in line with the capital updating equation\nGiven the fixed initial capital stock ko, the current capital stock kt is the result of the\npast investment decisions {ir}~::~. We shall assurne that all households have the same\ninitial capital stock ko as well as the same initial stock of government bonds bo.\nAs regards the labour they offer, the households must consider that their labour supply\nis limited by their total available time. If that time is normalised to unity and if lt denotes\n\nleisure, i.e. the households' available time after deducting the time offered in the labour\nmarket, then\nSince the investment chosen in the context of the allocation problem H.l at the begin\nning of period t affects the capital stock via the capital updating equation (6) and hence\nthe income and consumption opportunities in the future periods T = t +1, t +2, ..., the\nhouseholds base their decisions on the intertemporal maximisation of their welfare.\nThe households' preferences regarding the sequence of current and future private and\ngovernment consumption {c,., G'r }~t and the sequence of current and future leisure\n{ l\nT\n}~t are captured in a (lifetime) utility function, which is additively separable in time,\nYt( { c,., Gn l'r }~t)\n=E\n'r=t\nThe parameter \u00df is a discount factor and the aggregation parameter 11\" ;::: 0 determines\nthe extent to which government consumption G'r - in the sense of a public good - brings\nbenefits to the households.6 If 11\"\n= 1, the households consider government consumption\nG'r as a perfect substitute for private consumption c,..\nThe (single-period) utility function\nhas the properties well-known from consumer theory. This means in particular that U is\ntwice continuously differentiable, and both Ue\n> 0, Ul > 0 and Uce < 0, Ull < O.\nWhen formulating the intertemporal decision problem, one has to take into account\nthat, at the beginning of period t, the households know the current factor prices Tt,\nWt, the current return Rt and the current values of the fiscal policy variables t~, tt,\nt~, Gt, TRt \u00b7 But there is uncertainty about the sequence of the future factor prices\n{Tn W T\n}~t+I' the future returns {~}~t+l and the future values of the fiscal policy\nvariables {t~, t~, t~, G'r' T~ }~t+I' At the beginning of period t the households therefore\nchoose a feasible allocation plan {c,., i'r' b'r+h l'r' n'r }~t which maximises the expected value\nof their discounted (lifetime) utility:\n\n\nsubject to the constraints\nLr\ngiven the stock of government bonds bt and the capital stock kt .\nThe expectation Etl\u00b7] == E[ \u00b71 nd is formed rationally, i.e. consistent with the model's\nstructure, conditional on the information set n\nt\navailable at the beginning of period t with\n{rt, Wt, Rt , t~, tt, tf, Gt , TRt} c nt . The assumption of rational expectations implies that\nthe households are aware of the determination of the future factor prices rr, Wr , the future\nreturns Rr and the future fiscal policy variables t~, t~, t:;!, Gn\nTRr .\n2.2.2 The Conditional Decision Functions\nThe decision problem (8) - (11) can be solved by using a dynamic generalisation of the\nLagrange method.7 The Lagrangean to be maximised is\n\nEt [\n~\nCr +ir +br+d(1 +Rr)\n- (1 - t~)( rr kr + (1 +t:::t1Wr nr ) - t~ 8 kr +t::: (1 +t:::t1Wr nr - TRr - br )\nwhere the Lagrange multipliers '\\l,r+1, '\\2,r+1 and J.lr denote, respectively, the shadow\nprices of a marginal unit of discounted government bonds, the capital stock and leisure,\neach expressed in utility units.\n7For details on how the Lagrange method is used to solve (recursive) intertemporal decision problems\nThe system of first-order necessary conditions for a maximum of the Lagrangean (12)\nis obtained by setting the partial first derivatives equal to zero:\n(i) The derivatives with respect to c,., in b\"\"+b I..,. and n..,. for T = t, t + 1, ... yield the\nconditions\nI..,.)] - \u00dfEt[(l + t~) Al,1\"+I]' (13)\n\nEt\n[Al...,.+1] - Et\n\nEt\n[Al,..,.+l/(l + Rr)] - \u00dfEt[AI,..,.+2], (15) \n\nEt[U,(c,. +1I\"G..,.,I..,.)] - E,[\"..,.], (16)\n\n\u00dfEt[(l - t~ - t~) (1 + t~rl w..,.

However, at the beginning of period t + 1,\nthey re-optimise the sequence of allocations planned for the rest of their lifetime\n{cT,iT, bT+1, ZT' nT}~=t+l based on the more comprehensive amount of information DH1\navailable by then. Owing to the reoptimisation by the households, solving the intertem\nporal decision problem (8) - (11) can be restricted to determining the optimal allocation\nin period t, i.e. to determining {ct,it,bH1,Zt,nd, which, however, depends in a forward\nlooking manner on the expectations about the future values of the factor prices, the return\nand the fiscal policy variables due to the necessary conditions (15) and (18).\nConditional on the available information Dt, the households' optimal allocation {Ct,\nbt+1,it, Zt, nt} is characterised by time-invariant conditional decision functions given their\nstock of government bonds bt and their capital stock kt . After having substituted the\nLagrange multiplier /1-t and subject to the identity At+llt - Et[Al,Hd =Et[A2,tHl resulting\nfrom condition (14) the following characterisation is obtained:\nH.l The optimal allocation of the disposable income in period t is determined by\na consumption function, an investment function and a demand function for\ngovernment bonds\nc(rt, Wt, Rt, At+llt, t~, t~, t~, Gt,TRt;bt, kt), (19)\nZt i(rt, Wt, Rt, AHllt, t~, t~, t~, Gt,TRt;bt, kt), (20)\nb(rt, Wt, Rt, At+llt, t~, t~, t~, Gt,TRt;bt, kt). (21 )\nH.2 The optimal allocation of the available time in period t is determined by a\nleisure demand function and a labour supply function\nBeeause of the binding budget and time eonstraints (5), (7) it will suffiee to consider the\nconsumption function (19), the investment function (20) and the labour supply funetion\n(23) as the solution to the allocation problems H.1 and H.2. The derivation of this solution\neompletes the description of the household sector. The following subsection will foeus on\nthe deseription of the firms' behaviour.\nWhereas the households make intertemporal decisions under uneertainty, the firms' deci\nsions are based on static observation and certainty. This simplification is based on the\nassumption that the firms can obtain the production factors for each single period in the\nfactor markets. Such modelling greatly simplifies the determination of a competitive equi\nlibrium in which the households' intertemporal decisions and the firms' static decisions are\nto be coordinated. We will begin with a description of the firms' production teehnology,\nfollowed by a derivation of the conditional factor demand functions which characterise the\nfirms' supply and demand behaviour in the economy's goods and factor markets.\nUsing the production factors of capital Kt and labour Nt, the firms produce a homogenous\ngood in the periods t =0,1, ... according to a linear-homogenous neoclassical production\nfunction\nThe production function F has the properties well-known from the theory of the firm.\nIn particular, F is twice continuously differentiable, and FK > 0, FN > 0 and FKK < 0,\nFNN < 0, FKN = FNK > O.\nOwing to the linear homogeneity of the production function, and assuming there is\nperfect competition in the factor and the goods markets, the firms' production problem\ncan be formulated by using per-capita variables, which means that firm-specific variables\ndo not need to be introduced.\nIn addition to the production factors [(t, Nt, the amount of output Qt depends multi\nplicatively on a stochastic technology variable Zt,\nwhich reflects the model economy's level of technology in period t.B\nThe technology variable Zt is assumed to follow a stationary autoregressive process with\nindependent standard-normally distributed innovations fz,t+I,\nwhere the conditional variance ofthe technology variable turns out to be Var[Zt+I IZtl U cz '\nAssuming that the fiTms are aware of the factor prices rt, Wt and the realisation of the\ntechnology variable Zt at the beginning of period t, they will choose a feasible production\nplan {Qt, [(t, Nt} which is designed to maximise their current profits:\nsubject to constraint (24).\n2.3.2 The Conditional Factor Demand Functions\nThe profit maximisation problem (26), (24) is solved with the Lagrange method. The\nLagrangean to be maximised is\nwhere the Lagrange multiplier Kt denotes the contribution of a marginal output unit to the\nprofit expressed in units of the homogenous good.\nThe system of first-order necessary conditions for a local maximum of the Lagrangean\n(27) is obtained by forming the partial first derivatives with respect to the variables Qt,\n[(t, Nt and Kt which are set equal to zero:\n8Exogenous growth which could be modelIed by integrating Harrod-neutral technologieal progress into\nthe production technology (see, e.g., King, Plosser & Rebelo (1988a\u00bb is disregarded.\n\nTaking condition (28) into account, conditions (29) (31) form a system of three\nequations in the three unknown quantities Kt, Nt and Qt. Owing to the linear homogeneity\nof the production technology, however, the production plan {Qt, Kt,Nt} is not deter~ned\nby the firms' profit maximisation. Instead, conditional factor demand functions can be\nderived for a given output Qt as a function of the factor prices re, Wh\nK t - K(rt, Wt; Qt), (32)\nNt - N(rh Wt; Qt), (33)\nwhich fully characterise the firms' optimal behaviour in the model economy's factor markets\nfor a given output Qt.\n2.4 The Competitive Equilibrium\nAfter deriving the households' conditional decision functions and the firms' conditional\nfactor demand functions which determine the individual supply and demand behaviour in\nthe model economy's markets, we must now find out how the individual decisions are to\nbe coordinated.\nFirstly, based on our previous assumption of perfect competition in the model economy's\nfactor and goods markets, the factor prices rt, Wt will coordinate the economic plans of the\nindividual households and firms and, in this manner, support a competitive equilibrium.\nThese prices depend on the state of the model economy. This state is determined by the\nlevel of technology Zt, the fiscal policy variables Oe, t~, tt1\nt;U, trI, the per-capita stock of\ngovernment bonds Bt and the per-capita capital stock Kt at the beginning of each period\nt. These variables are accordingly termed state variables of the model economy. It should\nbe noted that any information about these state variables which goes beyond the factor\nprices is not required.\nSecondly, whereas the factor prices create a balance between elastic supply and elastic\ndemand in the factor and goods markets via a Walrasian mechanism, the rate of return Rt\ncan be determined by a pricing function for the bonds issued by the government to cover\nits budget. This function ensures that the economy-wide accumulation of government\n\nbonds is consistent with the individual households' demand for government bonds.9 Like\nthe factor prices, the rate of return is a function of the state variables Zt, 9t, t~, tt, t,/:, trt,\nBt and Kt .\nThirdly, besides the factor prices and the rate of return, the households' intertemporal\ndecision depends on the expected shadow price At+llt of the government bonds held by\nthe households and the households' capital stock. In this context, the variables bt and kt\nwhich were determined by the decisions made in the previous period are termed the state\nvariables of the households. The expected shad9w price At+llt is a function of both the\nmodel economy's state variables Zt, 9t, t~, tt, t,/:, trt, Bt, Kt and the households' state\nvariables bt , kt .\nTaking these functional relations into account, we can define a sequence of competi\ntive equilibria for the model economy which satisfies the households' conditional decision\nDefinition: For a given level of technology Zt, given values of the fiscal policy variables\n9t, t~, tt, t,/:,trt, a given per-capita stock of government bonds Bt, a given per-capita capital\nstock Kt, a given stock of government bonds held by the households bt, and a given capital\nstock of the households kt , the model economy's competitive equilibrium in each period\nt = 0,1, ... is determined by the following system of functions:\nE.l the factor price functions\nrt r(Zt,9t,t~,tt,t,/:,trt,Bt,Kt),\nWt w(Zt, 9t, t~, tt, t,/:, trt, Bt,Kt),\nE.2 the return function\n9The return is implicitly given by the Euler equation\nwhich is derived from the first-order necessary conditions (13) and (15) ofthe households' decision problem.\nThe equation has to be evaluated as a fundion of per-capita consumption C and per-capita leisure L.\nHence, it does not depend on the decisions of the individual households.\n\nE.3 the shadow price function\nE.4 the conditional decision functions of the households\nCt\n- c(zt, 9t, t~, tt, t;U, trt, Bt, Kt;0\" kt),\nZt - i(zt, 9t, t~, t:, t;U, trt, B\" Kt;bh kt),\nnt - n(Zt,9h\nt~, tt, t;U, tr\" B\" Kt ;\nwhich solve the sequence of intertemporal decision problems (8) - (11) for\ngiven factor price functions, a given return function and a given shadow price\nfunction,\nand\nE.5 the conditional factor demand functions of the firms\nKt -\nK(zt,g\"t~,tt,t;U,trt,BhKt),\nNt - N(Z\"9t,t~,tt,t;U,tr\"Bt,Kt),\nwhich solve the sequence of static profit maximisation problems (26), (24) for\ngiven factor price functions and a given production technology,\nsuch that the following conditions are satisfied:\nC.1 market clearing in the factor markets\nC.2 market clearing in the government bond market\nBt = b\"\nC.3 market clearing in the goods market\nQt = Ct\n+ It\n+Gt \n\nwith Ct\n=Ct and It\n=i h \n\n\nand\nC.4 a balanced government budget as given by (1) taking into account government\nconsumption as in (2) and government transfers as in (3).\nGiven an identical initial capital stock J{o = ko, the equality of per-capita investment\nI t and the households' investment it\nimplies the consistency of the updating equation for\nthe per-capita capital stock J{t and the updating equation for the capital stock of the\nindividual households kt .\nThe transition of the model economy from the competitive equilibrium in period t to\nthe competitive equilibrium in period t +1 is then determined by the transition equation\nof the technology variable Zt, the transition equation of the vector of the exogenous fiscal\npolicy variables Vt = (gt, t~, tt,t't', trt)', the consistent updating equations for the per-capita\ncapital stock J{t and the households' capital stock kt as weIl as by the equation for the\ngovernment budget.\nIn order to determine the sequence of competitive equilibria numerical methods have to\nbe applied since analytical solutions are not known for the families of parametric utility and\nproduction functions which will be considered below.

Within this framework, the intertemporal\neffects reflect optimal behaviour of households and firms supporting a sequence of competi\ntive equilibria. In order to quantify these effects the model economy must be appropriately\ncalibrated. In the following subsection, this calibration will be carried out with the aim of\nreproducing selected stylised facts of the German goods and labour markets by means of\nthe stochastically simulated model economy.\nlOFor computational details see Coenen (1997), Chapter 4.\n3.1 Calibration of the Model Economy\nPrior to calibrating the model economy, we have to choose parametric families for the\nutility function U(Ct +7r Gt,lt) and the production function F(Kt, Nt). Then, values must\nbe assigned to these functions' parameters and to the discount parameter \u00df, the aggregation\nparameter 7r, the depreciation parameter 0, the transition equation's parameters for the\ntechnology variable Zt, the parameter 1/J of the fiscal reaction function and the transition\nequation's parameters for the vector of fiscal policy variables Vt =(gt, t~, tt, t,(, trt)'.\n3.1.1 Preferences and Technology\nConsumption Ct +7r Gt\nand leisure lt can be seen as an aggregate A(Ct +7r Gt,It) within the\nutility function which will be easily obtained by Cobb-Douglas aggregation as\nThe households' preferences regarding Ct + 7r Gt\nand It will be described parametrically\nusing the family of isoelastic utility functions with\n~\n\"Y [((Ct +7r Gt)'/'I:-tt>r-\"Y- 1] for \"y> 0, \"Y:;l: 1\nU(Ct +7r Gt, It) =\n{\n<p In(Ct +7r Gt )\n+(1 - <p) In(lt) for \"Y = 1\nIf a household's willingness to intertemporally substitute a marginal unit At =A(Ct +\n1r Gt , I,) for a marginal unit At+1 =A(Ct+1 +7r GHh\nIt+d is expressed as the ratio of their\ndiscounted marginal utilities\n\u00df (AAt+,l)-\"Y,\nUA(Ct +7r G\" I,)\nthe expression\n--=~'-i'--:---;?;,-=-;-r-::..t..)\ncan be interpreted as the elasticity of intertemporally substituting At for At+!.

The households' preferences are\nparametrised by the discount factor \u00df, the aggregation parameter 11\" and the parameters\n,and 1> of the isoelastic utility function. Technology is parametrised by the elasticity\nparameter a of the Cobb-Douglas production function, the depreciation parameter 8 of\nthe capital updating equation and the parameters pz and C7fz\nof the transition equation for\nthe technology variable Zt. Fiscal policy is fully characterised by the parameter 'IjJ of the\nfiscal reaction function and by the parameters vV)\nAv , Cf!) of the transition equation for\nthe vector of fiscal policy variables Vt\n= (gt, t~, tt,t'f, trt)'.\nTable 1: Parameter Estimates il of the Autoregressive Model for v = (g, te\n, td\n, tW\n,\ntr)'\nfv\na Estimated standard errors in parentheses. b Parameter value which is calibrated such that (tJIQ) =\nThe preference and technology parameters and the fiscal policy parameter 'IjJ are ca\nlibrated conditional on the parameters vV)\nAv ) Cf!) of the autoregressive model (4) given\nin Subsection 2.1, whieh deseribes the evolution of the fiseal poliey variables Vt over time.\nEstimates of these parameters are shown in Table 1.11 Note that the eonstant of the transi\ntion equation for the transfer rate tr has been calibrated in such a way that the government\ndebt-to-output ratio is sustained at 60% in the steady state of the calibrated model.\nThe subsequent calibration of the model economy follows the literature reviewed in the\nintroduction or, if that does not contain any information about the choice of parameter\nvalues, it is based on considerations of feasibility and stability. The choice of parameter\nvalues will ultimately be evaluated against the ability of the stochastically simulated model\nto approximate selected stylised facts of the German goods and labour markets.\nIn line with the literature on this subject, the values 0.99 and 1/3 are assigned to the\npreference parameters \u00df and 4> respectively, and the values 0.36 and 0.025 are assigned\nto the technology parameters Cl' and 6 respectively. In the quarterly analysis carried out\nbelow, the value selected for the discount factor \u00df results in an annual rate of return of\nroughly 4% on the capital lent by the households as weIl as on the government bonds\npurchased by the households, while the value selected for the depreciation parameter 6\nimplies a roughly 10% annual depreciation of the existing capital stock. Owing to the\nlinear homogeneity of the Cobb-Douglas production function and the compensation of the\nproduction factors according to marginal productivity, the value selected for the technology\nparameter Cl' results in a wage rate of 0.64. The value chosen for the preference parameter\n4> implies that in the steady state of a corresponding economy which is free from allocative\ndistortions caused by fiscal policy, the households' labour time amounts to slightly less\nthan one-third of their available time.\nAt this stage, the value of the aggregation parameter 1r is set at 1.00, making government\nconsumption a perfect substitute for private consumption. The value 0.10, which proves to\nbe sufficiently high to guarantee the stability of the equation for the government budget,\nis assigned to the parameter tP of the fiscal reaction function. In order to limit the positive\ncorrelation between government consumption and output - as will be explored below\nin more detail - we shall assume that the innovations in the autonomous government\nconsumption rate f g\ncorrelate negatively with the innovations in the technology variable f z\nby fixing the correlation coefficient r ~g.~. at -0.75.12\nllSee Appendix A.2 for the construction of the time series of the fiscal policy variables.\n12The introduction of this negative correlation proved to be necessary since the autonomous component\nof government consumption is specified to depend linearlyon output within the model, whereas the data\n\n(J'fz\nrespectively, for which the volatility and persistence of the output time series generated\nby the stochastically simulated model are largely consistent with the corresponding figures\nof the empirical time series.13 Finally, illustrating the impact of the households' willing\nness to intertemporally substitute on the dynamic properties of the model, the preference\nparameter I will be calibrated within a sensitivity analysis which is carried out for the\nThe values of the preference, technology and fiscal policy parameters used in this sen\nsitivity analysis are summarised in Table 2.\nTable 2: Calibrated Preference, Technology and Fiscal Policy Parameters\npreferenees teehnology fiseal poliey\n\u00df r cl>\n\nIn order to assess the sensitivity of the model's dynamics with respect to the households'\npreference parameter I, a set of 100 replications of time series having a sampie size of 140\nwere simulated for the variables of the goods and labour markets Q, C, I, G, wand N.\nFor each replication the simulations were initialised in the model economy's steady state.\nThe standard deviations and contemporaneous correlations of the simulated time series are\nreported in Table 3. In this table, they are contrasted with the corresponding empirical\nfigures of the German goods and labour markets which were gathered for a sampie period\nIn line with the literature, the empirical and simulated time series have been detrended\nby means of the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter before computing the standard deviations\nand the contemporaneous correlations. In this context it should be noted that the stan\ndard deviations measure the average relative deviation of the time series from their trend\nshow a negative correlation between output and government eonsumption.\n14See Appendix A.1 for a deseription of how the time series of the variables of the goods and the labour\n\nTable 3: Stylised Facts of the Goods and the Labour Market a\ngoods market labour market\noutput priv. consumption investment gov. consumption real wage employment\n(TQ (Tc rC,Q (T, r',Q (Ta ra,Q (T..

The sampie uncer\ntainty related to the empirical series is measured by their estimted standard errors given\nin parentheses.\nFor a preference parameter value of '\"1 = 3.00, the standard deviation of the simulated\noutput time series U Q\nand the standard deviation of the simulated private consumption time\nseries U c which amount to 1.52% and 1.38%, respectively, almost match the variability of\nrespectively, the standard deviation of the simulated investment time series U1 and of\nthe time series for government consumption U G prove to be too high compared with the\nmarket are constructed as weH as for the determination of their HP trend component.\nIn terms of the theoretical model, the low variability of private consumption compared\nwith the variability of investment is due to the households' limited willingness to intertem\nporally substitute consumption: The households absorb cyclical fluctuations of production,\nand hence of income, by adjusting their investment activity. That means the simulated\ntime series of private consumption exhibit less pronounced cyclical fluctuations compared\nwith the simulated output time series, whereas the simulated investment time series show\nmore violent cyclical fluctuations.\nLower preference parameter values of , = 1.00 and , = 0.50, respectively, which\nimply a gradually increase in the households' willingness to intertemporally substitute,\ninduce an increase in the cyclical fluctuations of the simulated goods market time series.\nA higher preference parameter value of , = 5.00 leads to a decrease in the variability of\nthe simulated time series, which reduces the compatibility of the simulated time series of\noutput and private consumption with the empirical time series.\nThere is a positive contemporaneous correlation between output and private consump\ntion as weH as between output and investment for both the simulated and the empirical\ntime series. Compared with the correlations computed for the empirical time series, how\never, the correlations implied by the model prove to be too low for private consumption\nand too high for investment: For, 3.00, these correlations amount to rC,Q = 0.10 and\nrl,Q = 0.99, respectively. An increase in the households' willingness to intertemporally sub\nstitute, i.e. decreasing values for \" leads to implausible negative correlations for private\nconsumption.\nThe model's positive contemporaneous correlation between government consumption\nand output - for instance, rG,Q\nwith the negative correlation of -0.13 as measured for the empirical time series. This lack of\ncompatibility may be due to the specification of the government's consumption function,\naccording to which the autonomous component of government consumption depends li\nnearly on current output. Even if a negative correlation between the innovations of the\ntechnology variable Ez\nand the innovations of the autonomous government consumption\nrate Eg\nof r~g,~z = -0.75 is taken into account while simulating the model economy, this is\nnot sufficient to contain the excessive positive correlation.\nLooking at the standard deviations and the contemporaneous correlation of the labour\nmarket variables for , = 3.00, we find for the simulated model economy that the standard\ndeviation of the real wage 0'w\n\nFurthermore, at rH.... = 0.02, the eontemporaneous eorrelation implied by the models is too\nlow compared with the empirieal eorrelation of 0.59. The standard deviation of the real\nwage inereases with a gradually rising willingness to make intertemporal substitutions, i.e.\nfor deereasing values of '1, but, at the same time, the eontemporaneous eorrelation of both\nvariables deereases.\nAt first sight, the diserepancies between the empirieal data and the simulated data\nmay appear relatively large.15 However, one must bear in mind that both the empirical\ndata and the simulated data are subject to uneertainty. If eonfidence intervals were to be\nintrodueed for the empirieal and simulated figures when assessing the eompatibility of the\nmodel with the data, the diserepancies between them would turn out to be less obvious,\npartieularly regarding the standard deviations of the goods market variables. Furthermore,\nconsidering the high degree of abstra.ction of the model's strueture, this result should not\neome as a surprise at all.\nNevertheless, without using a formal statistieal eriterion, the simulated model appears\nto match the measured data best for a preference parameter value of '1 = 3.00.16 Henee,\nthis value is used for simulating the intertemporal effects of fiseal poliey in the following\nsubsection.\n3.2 Simulation of Fiscal Policy Scenarios\nThe vector of steady-state values of the exogenous fiscal poliey variables are given by the\nuneonditional expectation of the vector-autoregressive proeess deseribing their evolution\nover time with v = (ls - At/tl\",,, where v\n=(g, te\n,\ntel, tW\n,\nfr)'.

These\nimpulse responses are realisations of a sequence of competitive equilibria describing the\noptimal behaviour of households and firms.\n3.2.1 Comparative-Static Analysis\nTable 4 shows the long-run effects of alternative fiscal policy scenarios which aim at per\nmanently reducing the burden oI taxes and levies. Since the revenue shortfalls due to\npermanent reductions in taxes and levies induce an increase in government debt B which\nexceeds the increase in output Q, it will be necessary to reduce government spending in\norder to maintain the long-run government debt-to-output ratio (BIQ) at 60%. This\nspending cut will be obtained by appropriately adjusting the autonomous government con\nsumption rate g.\nIn the long run, a decrease of the consumption tax rate [c by one percentage point\n(Scenario I) reduces the relative price of the consumption good which leads to a 1.57% rise\nin consumption. Furthermore, the households' substitution decisions involve a curtailing\nof leisure demand and a complementary increase in labour supply. In the new steady\nstate, the labour input and the capital stock used for production both increase by 0.65%.\nOwing to the uniform increase in the input oI both the production factors, output likewise\nincreases by 0.65%,17 Since the ratio of the production factors employed remains the same,\nthere is no change in factor prices. The reduction of the consumption tax rate results in\nrevenue shortfalls, so that, via a reduction in the government consumption rate by 0.51\npercentage points, government consumption must be reduced by 1.92% in order to maintain\nthe government debt-to-output ratio at 60%.\nThe incentive to invest due to lowering the income tax rate [d by one percentage point\n(Scenario II) leads to a 1.02% increase in capital accumulation. Labour input increases by\n0.45%, and output by 0.66%. Since labour is used relatively scarce in production, the wage\nrate rises by 0.20%, whereas the capital rental cost diminishes by 0.36%. The growth in\nthe households' income induced by the increased input of the production factors and the\nlowering of the income tax rate leads to a 1.59% rise in private consumption. To stabilise\nthe government debt-to-output ratio, government consumption must be cut by 2.39%.\n7This result is determined by the choke of the functional forms for the households' preferences and the\nfirms' production technology. It can be proved that N :::: fW, fd, jW) and k g(fd) N holds in the steady\nstate.\nTable 4: Intertemporal Effects of Fiscal Poliey\nchanges in taxes and levies neutral to the debt-to-output ratio (I\nI.'..:>\nendogenous variablesb\noutput Q\npriv. consumption C\ninvestment i\ngov. consumption G\ngov. debt\ncapital stock k\nemployment N\nreal wage \u00dcI\nrental cost r\nrate of return R\nfltW\n(I\nThe reduction of government receipts is balanced by a decrease in 9 such that (8IQ) =0.60 holds again in the new steady state. b Changes\nin the steady-state values in percent. Consumption equivalent in percent. d The values are obtained for 11'\nC\nLowering the wage levy rate fW by one percentage point (Scenario III) leads to a 0.77%\nincrease in employment. Firstly, this result reflects the fact that the reduction of the wage\nlevy rate half to to be paid by the firms leads to a reduction of labour costs in production.\nSecondly, the stimulated labour demand of the firms is accompanied by an increase in the\nhouseholds' willingness to work because the reduction of the wage levies they have to pay\nleads to lower deductions from the households' wage income. As in Scenario I, capital and\nemployment rise to the same amount, which means the wage rate and the capital rental\ncast da not change. The rise in disposable income caused by both the increased input of\nthe production factars and the reduction of the wage levy rate leads to a 2.14% increase in\nprivate consumption. The increase in government debt caused by the wage levy reduction\nnecessitates a 3.03% cut in government consumption.\nScenario IV investigates the effects of a fiscal policy measure which combines a one\npercentage point reduction of the income tax rate fd with an one percentage point increase\nin the consumption tax rate fC. Ta a certain degree, this scenario pays tribute to the debate\non a change in the structure of the German tax system, according to which direct taxes\nshould be lowered, whereas indirect taxes should be raised in order to provide stronger\nincentives to invest. As to be expected, the resulting change in the fador price ratio in\nfavour of capital yields an 0.38% increase in the capital stock. However, the growing capital\nstock goes hand in hand with a substitution of labour which leads to a reduction in labour\ncut in government consumption rate is required to stabilise the government debt-to-output\nratio, the combined measure proves to be almost self-financing.\nFinally, Scenario V studies the effects of a reduction in the wage levy rate fW by one\npercentage point which is (partly) offset by raising the consumption tax rate fC to the\nsame amount. The 0.13% increase in output is accompanied by a uniform increase in\nemployment and the capital stock. The implied revenue shortfalls require a 1.10% cut in\ngovernment consumption in order to stabilise the government debt-to-output ratio.\nWhen assessing the lang-run welfare effects of the alternative fiscal policy scenarios,\none must take into account the fact that the isolated changes in consumption consisting\nof a private and a government component are not a suitable yardstick for evaluating their\noverall welfare implications. Besides changes in consumption, a comprehensive assessment\nmust also include the changes in welfare induced by leisure changes. A suitable indicator\nis the consumption equivalent, which equates the single-period utility of the households\n\nin the initial steady state with their single-period utility in the new steady state implied\nby the particular fiscal policy measure. The (steady state) consumption equivalent !:l.C is\ncalculated using the single-period utility function U by solving the equation\nwhere (C + 'lrG,L) and (6 + 'lrG,L) denote the equilibrium values of consumption and\nleisure in the initial and in the new steady state, respectively.\nIn the case of Scenarios I to III, assuming 'Ir\n= 1.00, the reductions in taxes and levies\nlead to welfare increases of 0.30, 0.30 and 0.36%, respectively, as reported in the last line of\nTable 4. Hence, the increase in private consumption overcompensates in terms of welfare\nfor the reduction of leisure and the cut in government consumption needed to stabilise the\ngovernment debt-to-output ratio.\nTo shed some light on the sensitivity of these results with regard to the aggregation\nparameter 'Ir, alternative consumption equivalents are calculated for 'Ir\ni.e. assuming that government consumption is either not beneficial or even more beneficial\nthan private consumption.18 Compared to the baseline case with 'Ir\n= 0, welfare increases\n(decreases) for 'Ir = 1.00 ('Ir = 2.00). This result is due to the fact that the reduction\nin government consumption required in order to consolidate the government budget does\ndiminish the utility of the households not at all (to a greater extent).\nIn Scenarios IV and V, assuming 'Ir = 1.00, the positive welfare effects resulting from\nthe reduction of the income tax and the wage levies are (largely) offset by the negative\nwelfare effects generated by the increase in the consumption tax and the cut in government\nconsumption required to finance the reductions. This assessment changes if government\nconsumption does not increase utility, i.e. if 'Ir\n= 0.00. In that case, the consumption\nequivalents amount to 0.13% and 0.51%, i.e. both the changeover from direct to indirect\ntaxation and the lowering of the labour costs of the firms, the latter being financed by\nraising indirect taxes, imply positive welfare effects.\nSince, ultimately, the analysis of the theoretical model does not provide a satisfactory\nbasis for the choice of the parameter value for 'Ir, the final assessment of the welfare effects\ngenerated by the alternative fiscal policy scenarios must be left to the reader's judgement.\nThis judgement may be based on Figure 1 which shows the consumption equivalent of the\n18This calculation is Ceasible because the steady-state values oC the endogenous variables do not depend\non 11' owing to the utility Cunction's separability.\nfiscal policy scenarios depending on the aggregation parameter 1f'. For below-unity values\nof 1f', any of the scenarios under consideration proves to be welfare-increasing. However,\nthere is a critical value for each scenario. Exceeding this value will yield a negative welfare\neffect.\nFigure 1: Consumption Equivalents of Fiscal Policy Scenarios\n,\n,\n~,\n'\n0.0r-------------:~~----l\n~---\n,,\n, , , , ,\n, ,\n, ,\n\"\n\nYet if we consider that the model economy only features a single homogenous good, and\nthat, on the basis of our model, the argument that government consumption may increase\nthe households' utility more than private consumption is hence not very convincing, it then\nappears justified to use 1f' 1.00 as the upper benchmark value for the assessment of the\nwelfare effects. As a consequence, positive welfare effects are to be expected from the fiscal\npolicy measures under review.\nAs a complement to the comparative-static analysis of the fiscal policy measures, we will\nnow turn to the model economy's dynamic adjustment to its new steady state implied by\nthe permanent reduction in taxes and levies. For Scenarios I to III the adjustment paths,\ni.e. the impulse response functions of the endogenous variables, are illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe impulse responses are expressed as percentage deviations from the initial steady-state\nvalues.\nFigure 2: Impulse Responses to a Decrease in Taxes and Levies\na) output Qt\n~~ ...\n---.\n./\",.\n../ .w\nL-\" \u00b7\nI\n,\nj...........\n\nc) investment I t = it\n...........\n\n0.83 :'./ - ' - -'--'-\"_'_ ._._ ._\ny\nI\n---'\ne) government debt Bt\n,'\nb) private consumption Ct = Ct\n\",..,.,..,.. .\n..-----\n.\nd) government consumption Gt\n, ,\n,\n-w.\n~.........\n......-...\n\n-'\nf) capital stock Kt = kt\nw\u00b7\u00b7\n- I . ..

This is due to the fact\nthat each lowering of taxes and levies induces a unidirectional reduction in the allocative\ndistortions of the model economy. This reduction enhances the households' propensity to\nwork and leads to a rise in overall economic activity which, in the long run, increases the\nwelfare of the households, as demonstrated in the preceding subsection.\nThe fiscal policy measures clearly generate positive effects, even in the short run. Above\nall, these effects are the result of the immediate increase in employment which leads to an\n\nincrease in output, and hence to a rise in the households' income. During the adjustment\nto the new steady state, the optimal choice of the households consists in temporarily\nrestraining consumption in spite of the increase in their current income resulting from the\nreduction in taxes and levies and to use it for investments. With the gradual increase in\nthe capital stock of the economy, the capacity effect caused by the boost in investment\nimpacts on production and leads to a rise in the households' future income and, thus,\nto an improvement of their future consumption opportunities. Owing to the households'\nforward-looking optimal plans, these future consumption opportunities are already taken\ninto account in their current decisions, which explains why the households temporarily\nforego consumption.\nIn the short run, the positive output effects make it possible to even increase govern\nment consumption. The increase is financed by a rise in tax revenues resulting from the\nrise in output, which, in turn, implies an increase in taxable income. In this case, the rise\nin tax revenues even leads to a temporary reduction in government debt. In the course of\nthe adjustment to the new steady state, government debt increases again. However, the\nrestraint in government consumption induced by the reduction of the autonomous govern\nment consumption rate will ensure that the government debt-to-output ratio remains at\n60% over the long run.\nThe scenarios differ as to the extent of the short and medium-term adjustments. Com\npared with changes in the income tax rate, changes in the consumption tax rate and the\nwage levy rate will cause factor prices, employment and output to react more strongly.\nBy contrast, a change in the income tax rate leads to higher investment and, hence, more\nrestrained consumption. The resulting increase in government revenue and expenditure\ncauses a greater transitory reduction in government debt, which implies a higher increase\nin the rate of return owing to more restrained private consumption. These phenomena\nrefiect the fact that income taxes exert a relatively strong influence on the households' in\ntertemporal consumption-investment decisions, whereas their intratemporallabour-leisure\nchoices are affected to a greater extent by consumption taxes and wage levies.\nAs regards the above interpretation of the short and medium-term adjustments, one\nmust consider that the Walrasian model economy under review does not include institu\ntional rigidities: The effects of the fiscal policy measures, which are positive even in the\nshort run, presumably hinge on the assumption of market-dearing by immediate price ad\njustments. Hence, an extension of the model covering lagged price adjustment mechanisms\n\nwould have to analyse the extent to which the short and medium-term adjustments would\nbe robust.\nSummary and Conclusions\nThis paper has analysed the intertemporal effects of fiscal policy reforms as requested of\neconomic policy in Germany within the framework of a calibrated RBC model. Based on\nalternative scenarios, the analysis demonstrated that a reduction of the burden of taxes\nand levies, criticised as too high in the economic policy debate, will lead to an increase\nin overall economic activity. In each scenario, the revenue shortfalls induced by lowering\nthe taxes and levies are offset by a cut in government consumption, which implies that\nthe government debt-to-output ratio can be lastingly maintained and, hence, that the\nsustainability of the .government budget is ensured. For plausible values of the weighting\nof government consumption in the households' utility function, the alternative fiscal policy\nscenarios have positive welfare effects.\nThe increase in overall economic activity is a consequence of the reduction in intra\ntemporal and intertemporal allocative distortions induced by taxes and levies. It is shown\nthat the accumulation of capital can be stimulated, in particular, by income tax reduc\ntions. However, the analysis also reveals that a rise in the capital stock resulting from an\nincome tax cut implies the substitution of labour which is becoming comparatively expen\nsive. Instead, a stronger increase in employment can be achieved by reducing the levies on\nwage income. A partial changeover from income to consumption taxes leads to an increase\nin investment but also to lower employment, whereas a reduction in the levies on wage\nincome offset by raising the consumption tax triggers an increase in both investment and\nemployment.\nWhereas the findings support a supply-oriented economic policy which aims at redu\ncing government activities, their final assessment should take into account the fact that\nthe model is an abstraction of a number of important factors that, in general, motivate\ngovernment action. For instance, government investment providing public infrastructure\nis disregarded, as is the explicit introduction of a social security system which would be\njustified by an intra- or intergenerational redistribution objective. In addition, the model\ndoes not take into account rigidities and market imperfections which can lead to persistent\nimbalances a fact that holds particularly true for the labour market.\n\nNonetheless, this paper highlights major obstacles on the supply side which stand in the\nway of sustained economic growth supported by increased investment and a higher level of\nemployment. Thereby, analysing the arguments calling for the removal of these obstacles\nwithin adynamie general equilibrium model and identifying the assumptions underlying\nthese arguments, this paper may offer a disciplining analytical input to the economic policy\ndebate on the appropriate design of fiscal policy in order to improve the investment and\nemployment conditions and, thus, to promote overall economic activity.\n\nA The Data\nThis appendix describes the construction of the data which are employed to calibrate the\nabove RBC model. The data build on time series taken from the national accounts of the\nFederal Republic of Germany (West) with a sampie period ranging from the first quarter\nA.l The Variables of the Goods and the Labour Market\nTo construct the per-capita variables of the goods and labour markets the following time\nseries were taken from the German national accounts:\n\u00b7 Gross domestic product at 1991 prices (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Private consumption at 1991 prices (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Investment: fixed capital formation by firms at 1991 prices (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Government consumption at 1991 prices (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Compensation of employees: gross wages and salaries (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Employed persons: total number of hours worked (in billion hours)\nWhere required, the time series are seasonally adjusted using the Census X-lI method.\nThe seasonally-adjusted time series of the gross wages and salaries is deflated by the price\nindex of the gross domestic product. By dividing the adjusted time series by the time\nseries of the resident population, we obtain the time series of the real per-capita variables,\ni.e. of output Q, private consumption C, private investment I, government consumption\nC, real wage wand employment N.\nSince the time series of the per-capita variables are non-stationary, a suitable trend\nadjustment must be carried out. In line with the literature, the Hodrick-Prescott (HP)\nfilter is applied which presumes that the time series of a variable Y (in logarithms) can be\ndecomposed into a smooth trend component y9 plus a residual component yr,\n+\nYtl\nr t=l, ... ,T.\n\nFurther assuming that the mean of the residual component yr equals zero, the trend\ncomponent y9 is defined as the solution to the following quadratic minimisation problem:19\nThe first term of the objective function to be minimised captures the fit of the trend\ncomponent to the data, whereas the second term captures its smoothness. The parameter\nA controls these two conHicting properties. For A =0, the component y9 is perfectly fitted\nto the data, such that yf = Yt holds. If the determination of y9 only takes account of the\nsmoothness, Le. for A -+ 00, y9 follows a linear trend.20\nFigure 3 shows the time series of the per-capita variables of the goods and labour\nmarkets as weIl as their HP trend component for a parameter value of A = I, 600 which is\ngenerally used for quarterly time series in the literature.\nA.2 The Fiscal Policy Variables\nComplementing the above data, the following time series from the national accounts are\nused for constructing the fiscal policy variables:\n\u00b7 Investment: depredations by firms (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Compensation of employees: sodal contributions by employers (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Current transfers: direct domestic taxes paid to the government (in DM billion)\n\u00b7 Current transfers: social benefits the government pays to the households (in DM\nbillion)\n\u00b7 Gross value added: non-deductible turnover tax (in DM billion)\nThe time series are seasonally adjusted using the Census X-lI method and deHated by\nthe price index of the gross domestic product.\n20King &; Rebelo (1993) demonstrate that the cyclical component of a time series integrated up to order\nd = 4, which is determined by applying the HP filter, is stationary. However, statistical problems arising\nfrom HP filtering non-stationary time series are addressed in Barvey &; J\u00e4ger (1993), J\u00e4ger (1994) and\n\nFigure 3: HP Trend Component of the Variables of the Goods and the Labour Market\na) output Q b) private consumption C\n/\n/\nc) investment I d) government consumption G\ne) real wage w f) employment N\n- per-capita variable in logarithms - - - HP trend component\n\nThe government consumption rate 9 is calculated as the share of real gross domestic\nproduct taken up by real government consumption. The consumption tax rate tC is calcu\nlated as the ratio of the sum of real private and government consumption and the sum of\nreal private and government consumption less government's real value-added tax revenue,\nminus one. Owing to the linear homogeneity of the model's production technology and the\ndeductibility of the depredations from the households' taxable capital income, the income\ntax rate td is defined as the share of real gross domestic product less real depreciation\naccounted for by real direct taxes. The wage levy rate tUi denotes the share of the employ\ners' real sodal contributions to real total gross wages and salaries. The transfer rate tr\nis calculated as the share of real gross domestic product accounted for by the real sodal\nbenefits the households receive from the government.\ntd\n, tUi\nThe fiscal policy variables g, tC\n,\nand tr are stacked to form the 5 - dimensional\nvector v\n=(g, tC\n,\ntd\n, tUl\n,\ntr)'. Since the time series of the vector of the fiscal policy variables\nprove to be non-stationary too, the time series Vi are again decomposed into a smooth\ntrend component\nvr and a residual component\nvr beforehand,\nFor the present we shall assume that the mean of the residual component\nvr equals\nzero, but the smooth trend component vf is defined as a third-order polynomial,\nFigure 4 shows the time series of the fiscal policy variables and their estimated polyno\nmial trend component.\nSubsequently, since the analysis of the model economy rests on information about the\nmean of the time series Vi, the residual components\nvr are adjusted appropriately,\n-r _ r - \u00b7\nvi = Vi\n+Vi.T IT with\nwhere iT denotes the T - dimensional vector of ones. The means of the time series are\nillustrated by the horizontallines in Figure 4.21\n=fr was adjusted appropriately in order to ensure that the governm~nt debt-to-output\nratio (B/Q) in the model economy is maintained at 60% in the long run.\nFigure 4: Polynomial Trend Component of the Fiscal Policy Variables\na) government consumption 9 b) consumption tax tC\nc) income tax t d d) levy on wage income tW\n\ne) traitsfers tr\n\n,\n,\n...... ---\n\nfiscal policy variable - - - polynomial trend component\n\nA VAR(p) model, i.e. a vector-autoregressive model of order p, is then fitted to the time\nseries of the vector of adjusted residuals tY,\nt = 1 +p, ... , T\nwhere the error terms Ut are assumed to be independent white noise with expectation\nE[Utl = 0 and positive-definite covariance matrix Var[utl = E[ut u~l.
