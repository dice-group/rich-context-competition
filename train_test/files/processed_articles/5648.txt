    "abstract": "Abstract\nResearch suggests that job-related stress affects correctional officers' attitudes toward their work environment, coworkers,\nand supervisors, as well as their physical and mental health; however, very few studies have examined the relationship\nbetween stress and attitudes toward inmates. This study examined the relationship between correctional officers' levels of\nstress and their perceptions of inmates by surveying a sample of 501 correctional officers employed by a Southern prison\nsystem. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to test the principal hypothesis of this study--that more negative\nperceptions of inmates would result in higher levels of stress for correctional officers. Independent variables were grouped\ninto four groups (demographic variables, supervisory support, job characteristics, and attitudes toward inmates) and were\nentered into the model in blocks. Lower supervisory support and perceptions of the job being dangerous were associated\nwith higher levels of job stress. More importantly, correctional officers who saw inmates as intimidated (not arrogant) and\nnonmanipulative reported lower levels of job stress, while officers who perceived inmates as being unfriendly, antisocial, and\ncold reported higher levels of stress.\n",

Thus, the purpose of this study was to address this\ndeficiency. The authors hypothesized that officers' percep-\ntions of inmates would cause an increase in correctional offi-\ncer job stress.\nLiterature Review\nDefinition of Stress\nThere is not a clear consensus among researchers and schol-\nars on the definition of stress (Triplett et al., 1996). The\nliterature on job-related stress has used different definitions\ntailored to their specific research focus. Generally speak-\ning, stress can be described as an individual experience dic-\ntated by the way certain stressors are individually perceived\n(Handy, 1988). In a more specific fashion, Blix, Cruise,\nMitchell, and Blix (1994) defined occupational stress as the\nincapacity of a worker to handle different work demands\nsuccessfully. This study used Cullen, Link, Wolfe, and\nFrank's (1985) definition of stress as \"the psychological\ndiscomfort or tension which results from exposure to stress-\nors\" (p. 507). As indicated in the literature, stressors in cor-\nrectional settings come from different sources, such as\ndirect contact with inmates, organizational variables, or\nindividual characteristics of officers (Cullen et al., 1985;\nIndividual Characteristics'\nRelationship With Job Stress\nThere are mixed findings in the literature on the relationship\nbetween gender and job-related stress (Morgan, Van Haveren,\nfound that female officers showed higher levels of stress\ncompared to their male counterparts, while Britton (1997)\nand Triplett et al. (1996) did not find any difference in the\nlevel of stress between male and female officers. In another\nstudy, Carlson et al. (2003) found that female correctional\nofficers did not seem to be significantly affected by job-\nrelated stress or burnout. Oppositely, Brough and Williams\nrectional officers, men appeared to have higher levels of psy-\nchological fitness than their female counterparts.\nStudies that have explored the relationship between age\nand job-related stress have not yielded any irrefutable con-\nclusions. Some studies found that older correctional officers\nsuffered a higher amount of stress (Lindquist & Whitehead,\n1986), while others found that officer age was not linked to\njob-related stress (Triplett et al., 1996). Whitehead and\nLindquist's (1986) study of correctional officers in the\nAlabama correctional system found that younger officers\nexperienced more job-related stress than older correctional\nofficers. In a recent meta-analysis of past literature on pre-\ndictors of correctional officer stress, Dowden and Tellier\n(2004) asserted that the relationship between age and job\nstress was mixed.\nTenure (i.e., length of employment) as a correctional offi-\ncer has, at times, also been associated with job stress. Cullen\nthat correctional officers with higher tenure showed higher\nlevels of job-related stress. Conversely, other studies have\nnot found any link between tenure and job stress (Dignam,\nLike the other individual characteristics of gender, age,\nand tenure, the relationship between race and job stress\namong correctional officers is unclear. In a meta-analysis,\nDowden and Tellier (2004) reported that non-White officers\nreported lower stress from work than White officers. In other\nstudies, a nonsignificant relationship was reported between\nrace and job stress (Lambert et al., 2009; Lambert, Hogan, &\nGenerally, most past correctional officer job stress studies\nhave included the individual characteristics of gender, age,\ntenure, and race. The findings, however, suggest that indi-\nvidual characteristics are not powerful predictors of job\nstress, particularly when institutional variables are included.\nInstitutional variables in general tend to be stronger predic-\ntors of correctional officer job stress (Dowden & Tellier,\n2004). Nevertheless, gender, age, tenure, and race were\nincluded in the current study, more as control than explana-\ntory variables.\nInstitutional Variables'\nRelationship With Job Stress\nIt has been postulated that correctional orientation may be\nlinked with job stress of correctional officers. According to\nthe literature, there are two types of officers with divergent\ncorrectional orientations. First, there are custody-oriented\nofficers who openly advocate for punishment strategies to\ndeal with inmates and who do not support rehabilitation as a\ncorrectional philosophy. Conversely, human service-oriented\nofficers believe in rehabilitation as the primary correctional\ngoal and support a more counseling-oriented role for the cor-\nrectional officer (Cullen et al., 1985; Lindquist & Whitehead,\n1986). The two forms of correctional orientation can lead to\nrole conflict for officers. Some researchers have suggested\nthat when stress increases, correctional officers tend to\nembrace a custodial orientation to reduce stress (Poole &\nRegoli, 1980); however, Robinson, Porporino, and Simourd\n(1997) indicated that the more custody-oriented a correc-\ntional officer is, the more stress he or she suffers. In addition,\nMisis et al. 3\nabundant research has found that role stress has a positive\nrelationship with job stress (Cullen et al., 1985; Dowden &\n1986). Role conflict is a salient predictor of job stress for\ncorrectional officers (Dowden & Tellier, 2004). As such, role\nconflict was included in the current study.\nSupervisors are critical for correctional officers to be suc-\ncessful at their jobs (Lambert, Jiang, & Hogan, 2008).\nSupervisory consideration has been reported to be negatively\nassociated with correctional officer job stress (Lambert et al.,\n2009). Furthermore, supervisory support leads to lower job\nstress among correctional staff (Lambert & Hogan, 2009). In\naddition, peer support is important in helping reduce job\nstress among correctional officers (Lambert, Altheimer, &\nHogan, 2010). The literature supports the contention that\nsocial support, such as peer and supervisory support, is\nimportant in dealing with potential work stressors (i.e., fac-\ntors that lead to job stress) and dealing with job stress when\nit arises (Lambert et al., 2010; Lindquist & Whitehead,\n1986). In light of the fact that they are salient predictors of\njob stress for correctional officers, peer support and supervi-\nsory support were included in the current study.\nConsequences of Correctional Officer Stress\nAt the individual level, stress can have serious consequences\nfor correctional officers, their families, and friends.\nResearchers have reported that correctional officers com-\nmonly suffer from stress-related illnesses such as hyperten-\nsion, heart disease, depression, and anxiety (Adwell &\nstudies have established that correctional officers show a\ngreat deal of anger toward their family and friends, aggres-\nsion, high rates of divorce, posttraumatic stress disorder,\nand drug abuse, at least a portion of which can be attributed\nAt the organizational level, Tewksbury and Higgins\n(2006) noted that stress has very detrimental consequences\nin criminal justice organizations. In fact, correctional officers\nwith high levels of stress are more likely to be less effective\nand less satisfied with their jobs (Tewksbury & Higgins,\n2006). Other detrimental consequences of job-related stress\nfor correctional officers are withdrawal symptoms, increased\nabsenteeism, and tardiness (Lambert et al., 2006). Perhaps\nthe most important organizational consequence of occupa-\ntional stress among correctional officer is turnover. The\nannual rate of correctional officer turnover has been esti-\ncorrectional officers quit their jobs. Similarly, Tewksbury\ntional officers quit their jobs within 13 months of hire, which\ncould be related to job stress. As stress from work has nega-\ntive outcomes that can be detrimental to officers and the cor-\nrectional institution, it is critical to explore and identify the\npredictors of job stress.\nCorrectional Officer Perceptions of Inmates\nWhat remains unexplored is whether perceptions of inmates\nare related to job stress for correctional officers. Correctional\nofficers work directly with inmates, and their perceptions of\ninmates may either enhance or reduce the possibility of stress\nfrom the job. If officers view inmates negatively, then they\nmay become frustrated and tense when having to deal with\nthem, and this in turn could lead to higher levels of stress\nfrom work. Conversely, if an officer has positive perceptions\nof inmates, then they may have more pleasant and less con-\nfrontational interactions with inmates, and this in the end can\nresult in more positive feelings and less strain from work,\nultimately leading to lower job stress.\nPrevious researchers have examined individual and\ndemographic characteristics as a source of correctional offi-\ncers' perceptions of inmates. Gender, age, tenure, and race\nhave been linked positively or negatively to correctional\nofficers' attitudes toward inmates. Generally speaking, the\nliterature has shown a relationship between gender and offi-\ncer attitudes toward inmates, with mixed results on whether\nmen generally hold more punitive attitudes (Jurik, 1985;\nLambert, Paoline, Hogan, and Baker (2007) and Crouch and\nAlpert (1982) observed that female officers were less puni-\ntive. Farkas (1999) found that female staff showed a puni-\ntive approach in their attitudes; however, they expressed\ngreat preference for counseling roles and greater concern for\ncorruption of authority. Zimmer (1986) noted that women's\nbelief in their abilities to carry out their work influenced\ntheir attitudes toward inmates.\nThe literature reflects an association between age and\npositive relationships with inmates (Farkas, 1999; Jurik,\ntended to show a more custody-oriented approach, while\nolder officers showed a stronger support for rehabilitation\n(Jurik, 1985) and seemed to have a more positive approach to\nstudy to determine the orientation of correctional officers\ntoward inmates in a Midwestern state. She found that older\nofficers expressed a very strong support for rehabilitative\nefforts and concluded that older officers either believed in\nwhat they were doing or had bonded with the organization or\nthe goals of the organization.\nThe research to date on the relationship between tenure\nand perceptions of inmates is mixed. Sometimes tenure is\ninversely associated with support for rehabilitation and posi-\ntively associated with support for punishment (Shamir &\nother studies, the opposite is reported (Cullen, Latessa,\n4 SAGE Open\nResearch on the relationship between officers' tenure and\nattitudes toward inmates has not yielded conclusive findings.\nSome studies did not find any relationship between officers'\ntenure and attitudes toward inmates (Cullen, Lutze, Link, &\nofficers with more tenure tend to hold more rehabilitative\nthat officers with higher tenure were higher in custodial ori-\nentation and also expressed more disbelief in the rehabilita-\ntive approach.\nWhen race is used as an independent variable, some stud-\nies could not relate race and punitive attitudes toward inmates\n1986). Conversely, other studies have shown that minority\nofficers (especially African American officers) showed a\nhigher preference for rehabilitation and a more positive atti-\ntheir study of correctional officers in theAlabama Department\nof Corrections, Whitehead and Lindquist (1989) indicated\nthat White officers do not hold more negative perceptions\ntoward inmates compared with African American officers.\nAlthough the findings are somewhat mixed, overall, there is\nlittle empirical support for the contention that increasing the\npresence of African American officers in correctional facili-\nties would increase the number of officers who hold more\npositive attitudes about their interactions with inmates.\nAs individual characteristics may be linked to job stress\nand perceptions of inmates, it is important to include them in\nan analysis to determine the relationship between percep-\ntions of inmates and job stress among correctional officers;\ntherefore, as previously indicated, gender, age, tenure, and\nrace were included in this study as possible predictors of cor-\nrectional officer work stress.\nSome research has analyzed how role conflict affects cor-\nrectional officers' attitudes toward inmates. Whitehead and\nLindquist (1989) concluded that there is no connection\nbetween role conflict and attitudes toward inmates, while\ndirect relationship between role conflict and officers' puni-\ntive attitudes toward inmates. Regarding role stress (com-\nprising role conflict and role ambiguity), some studies have\nfound role stress was related with higher levels of punitive-\nness among correctional officers (Poole & Regoli, 1980;\nBecause role conflict is linked with perceptions of inmates\nand job stress, it was included in the current study. How peer\nsupport or supervisory support may be associated with per-\nceptions of inmates is unclear; however, both forms of social\nsupport have been found to be salient predictors of job stress\namong correctional staff and, therefore, should be included\nin analysis of how perceptions of inmates may be associated\nwith correctional officer work stress.\nThe Relationship Between Officers'\nPerceptions of Inmates and Job Stress\nResearch has indicated that correctional officers are com-\nmonly worried about inmate violence, overcrowding, prison\ngangs, and certain locations in prison (Black, 2001;\ninmate violence are relatively common in U.S. prisons (Finn,\n1998), correctional officers often work in a very stressful and\ndangerous environment. The fear of being assaulted or wit-\nnessing violent incidents among inmates is a constant source\nresearchers have looked at inmates' effect on stress, few\nstudies have examined the effect that correctional officer\nperceptions of inmates have on their stress levels; therefore,\nthis study adds to what is known about stress by assessing\nhow correctional officers' perceptions of inmates affect their\nlevels of job stress, while including the variables of gender,\nage, tenure, race, peer support, supervisory support, and role\nconflict. By including individual and institutional variables,\na clearer picture will be gained whether and how perceptions\nof inmates are linked with correctional officer job stress.\nMethod\nParticipants\nDue to agency concerns about both the correctional officers'\ntime away from work responsibilities and causing the least\namount of disruption to the prison schedule, this study uti-\nlized a purposive sample. A purposive sample is generated\nbased on participant availability and accessibility. For the cur-\nrent study, only officers with 8 months or more of tenure who\nhad direct contact with inmates were asked to participate, as\nthese individuals could be surveyed during their required\nannual in-service training with the agency. Data were gath-\nered through self-report surveys administered to correctional\nofficers attending annual in-service training. The correctional\nofficers were all from one region out of six regions that com-\nprised a Southern prison system. The selected region con-\ntained 13 prisons, which ranged in security level from\nminimum to high maximum. Specifically, one prison was\nhigh maximum security, four were maximum security, five\nwere medium security, and three were minimum security. The\nAll the selected correctional officers worked as housing unit\nofficers. Each housing unit held between 100 and 250 inmates.\nAll 13 prisons housed male inmates (i.e., no prisons in this\nregion housed female inmates). Finally, the surveyed officers\nrepresented all 13 institutions in this region. Unfortunately,\nno information about the security level of the institution at\nMisis et al. 5\nwhich the participant worked was collected in the survey.\nParticipants were informed that involvement in the survey\nwas completely voluntary, and informed consent was obtained\nprior to survey administration. A total of 630 surveys were\nadministered with 501 completed surveys returned, for a\nresponse rate of 79%.\nApproximately 66% of the participants were men. The\nagency correctional officer population at the time of the sur-\nvey was 57% male and 43% female. The age of the partici-\npants ranged from 18 to 64 years, with a mean average age of\nthe entire agency correctional officer complement. The aver-\nage tenure (i.e., years of employment as a correctional offi-\nof tenure was similar to the agency population. The majority\nof the participants were White (68%), followed by African\n(1%) employees chose not to provide a response for the race\nquestion. The racial breakdown of the surveyed population\nand Other (1%). For gender, age, and tenure, the participants\nwere similar to the overall population of correctional officers\nin the state prison system. For race, the participants were\nslightly higher for Whites and the \"Other\" racial category\nand lower for Hispanics for overall correctional officer\npopulation.\nVariables\nDependent Variable. Six items from Cullen et al. (1985) were\nused to measure job stress among correctional officers: (a)\nWhen I am at work I often feel tense or uptight; (b) A lot of\ntimes, my job makes me very frustrated or angry; (c) There\nare several aspects of my job that make me upset about\nthings; (d) I am usually calm or at ease at work (reverse\ncoded); (e) I don't consider this to be a stressful job (reverse\ncoded); and (f) My job is worse than those of other people I\nknow. The response options for these items was a 5-point\nLikert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree (coded 1) to\nstrongly agree (coded 5). The Cronbach's alpha reliability\nfor the job stress scale was .74. The responses to the six items\nwere summed together to form an index measuring job stress.\nHigher scores on this scale denoted higher levels of officer\njob stress.\nIndependent Variables. The individual characteristics of gen-\nder, age, tenure, and race were included more as control than\nexplanatory variables. Gender was coded as 0 = female and\n1 = male. The age of participants in years was coded as a\ncontinuous variable. Tenure measured the number of years\nemployed as a correctional officer and was measured as a\ncontinuous variable. Race was coded as 0 = non-White and\n1 = White.\nFive items adapted from Cullen et al. (1985) and Toch and\nKlofas (1982) were used to measure perceived support from\ncoworkers. These items were (a) My fellow officers compli-\nment someone who has done their job well, (b) My fellow\nofficers blame each other when things go wrong (reverse\ncoded), (c) I am able to talk about work-related problems\nwith my coworkers, (d) I am able to talk about non-work-\nrelated problems with my coworkers, and (e) My fellow offi-\ncers help one another when someone needs to improve their\nperformance. The response options for these items was a\n5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree\n(coded 1) to strongly agree (coded 5). By adding the\nresponses to these five items together, an index was created\nto measure support from coworkers, and the reliability of the\nitem was .60, which is on the low end of acceptable. High\nscores were indicative of high levels of perceived coworker\nsupport.\nPerceived supervisory support was assessed using a five\nitems adapted from Cullen et al. (1985) and Triplett et al.\n(1996). Five statements asked participants about the per-\nceived level of social support from supervisory staff and\nwere as follows: (a) My supervisors often encourage the\npeople I work with if they are doing well, (b) My supervisors\noften blame others when things go wrong which are possibly\nnot the fault of those blamed (reverse coded), (c) My super-\nvisors often encourage us to do the job in a way that we\nwould be proud of, (d) Supervisors care more about inmates\nthan they do C.O.'s (reverse coded), and (e) Most supervi-\nsors are concerned about correctional officer morale.\nParticipants responded on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging\nfrom strongly disagree (coded 1) to strongly agree (coded 5).\nThe responses to these items were added to form an index,\nand the reliability of the supervisory support index was .76.\nHigh scores were indicative of higher levels of perceived\nsupervisory support.\nFive items from Cullen et al. (1985) were used to measure\nrole conflict: (a) The formal chain of command is not adhered\nto, (b) I receive conflicting requests at work from two or\nmore people, (c) I work on unnecessary tasks or projects on\nthe job, (d) My job duties and work objectives are unclear to\nme, and (e) I lack the authority to carry out my job responsi-\nbilities. Role conflict was defined as any situation in which a\ncorrectional officer had conflicting job demands, such as role\nambiguity. Participants responded to these items using a\n5-point Likert-type scale of strongly disagree (coded 1) to\nstrongly agree (coded 5). Reliability of the role conflict scale\nwas .63, which is on the low end of acceptability. The\nresponses to the five items were summed together to form an\nindex measuring role conflict. High scores were indicative of\nhigher perceptions of role conflict.\nPerceptions of inmates was the primary independent vari-\nable of focus in this study. Participants were asked a series of\n16 items asking them to rank their perceptions of the typical\ninmate on a scale of 1 to 7 for series of 16 areas anchored by\npositive and negative adjectives. These items were adapted\nfrom a survey utilized by Gerstein, Topp, and Correll (1987)\nand can be found in the appendix.\n6 SAGE Open\nOne of the important objectives of the current study was\nto investigate the relative impacts of attitudes of inmates on\njob stress among correctional officers. To assist in clarifying\nthe number of underlying dimensions in the survey items, an\nexploratory principle-component factor analysis was con-\nducted (Kim & Titterington, 2009; Sawyer, Tsao, Hansen, &\nFlood, 2006). A principal component analysis of the items\nyielded a 4-factor solution according to the scree plot, an\neigenvalue greater than 1.0, and the Kaiser\u00adMaeyer\u00adOlkin\nMeasure of sampling adequacy = .83. This 4-factor model\naccounted for a substantial 54% of the total variance, and\nand 9% of the variance, respectively, according to the cate-\ngories listed in Table 1 (Haslam & Levy, 2006; Sawyer et al.,\n2006). Item loadings for the varimax-rotated factors are also\npresented in Table 1.\nAs shown in Table 1, six items loaded strongly onto Factor I.\nThese items related to virtues an inmate may or may not pos-\nsess (i.e., \"Motivated versus Unmotivated,\" \"Sensitive ver-\nsus Insensitive,\" \"Willing versus Resistant,\" \"Truthful versus\nDeceiving,\" \"Flexible versus Rigid,\" \"Moral versus\nImmoral\"). Results showed that the factor loadings range\nbetween .53 and .72, which all exceed the minimum level\n(.30) for interpretation of structure (Hair, Black, Babin,\nSawyeretal.,2006).Thisfactorwaslabeledas\"Respectable.\"\nFactor II contained five loadings, and this factor was labeled\nas\"Reasonable\"basedontheitemsloaded(i.e.,\"Unintelligent\nversus Intelligent,\" \"Afraid versus Confident,\" \"Hostile\nversus Agreeable,\" \"Uncooperative versus Cooperative,\"\n\"Irrational versus Rational\"). Results indicated that the\nFactor II loadings ranged from .38 to .77. Two items loaded\nonto Factor III with the loadings .69 and .73, respectively.\nThis factor was labeled \"Manageable\" based on the items\nloaded (i.e., \"Arrogant versus Intimidated,\" \"Manipulative\nversus Nonmanipulative\"). Factor IV contains three load-\nings, which were named \"Amiable\" based on the items\nloaded (i.e., \"Unfriendly versus Friendly,\" \"Social versus\nAntisocial,\" \"Cold versus Warm\"). Results indicated that the\nFactor IV loadings ranged between .52 and .68. The four\nvariables representing views of inmates were created using\nthe factor scores.\nTable 2 provides the descriptive statistics (mean and stan-\ndard deviation) of the variables used in the study.\nResults\nJob Stress Predictors\nHierarchical multiple regression procedures were used to\nexamine the predictive strength of selected demographic\nvariables (age, gender, race, and tenure), support (peer sup-\nport and supervisory support), job characteristic (role con-\nflict), and attitudes toward inmates (respectable, reasonable,\nmanageable, amiable) on job stress among correctional offi-\ncers (Miller, Mire, & Kim, 2009). In hierarchical multiple\nregression, the researchers determine the order of entry of\nthe variables. Using F tests, this hierarchical procedure\nTable 1.

After listwise deletion, the total number of cases was 480.\nMisis et al. 7\ncomputes the significance of each added variable or set of\nvariables in blocks to the explanation reflected in R2 for pur-\nposes of assessing the importance of the independents\nFour sets of predictor variables were added to the model\nin blocks, in the following order: demographic variables,\nsupports, job characteristics, and views toward inmates.\nBecause two or more independent variables are combined\ninto each construct prior to running the regression analysis,\nthe independent variables of the same construct were entered\nto the model together in blocks. High intercorrelation among\nthe independent variables within a block is intentional and\ndesirable, and normally this is not considered \"multicol-\nlinearity\" (Garson, 2010). Of concern within each set of vari-\nables were the significant variables in the present step after\ncontrolling for the effect of the previous step (Lee, Chronister,\nincremental changes in the R2 statistic were carried out at\nevery step (Lee et al., 2008). At each step, individual vari-\nables within the block were explored and removed if they did\nnot correlate significantly with attitudes toward inmates or\nimprove sensitivity of the model (Nosek, Hughes, Taylor, &\nTaylor, 2006). By excluding all the irrelevant predictors, a\nmore significant t test for the individual predictor is expected\nand the issue of the lack of statistical power due to relatively\nsmall sample size can be addressed (Hair et al., 2006).\nResults of the hierarchical multiple regression analysis are\nsummarized in Table 3.\nDemographic variables were entered as the first block.\nCollectively these variables were significant, F(4, 486) =\nthe demographic variables found to be significant were age\np  .05). These two variables were retained in Model 2\nIn the second step, the variables of age and gender were\nentered first to control for the relationship with job stress,\nand they were followed by the entry of two support vari-\nables (peer support and supervisory support) as indepen-\ndent factors. This model (Model 2 in Table 3), as a whole,\n .001. As shown in Table 3, Model 2 was shown to explain\nmore variance in job stress. Approximately 21% of the vari-\nance (R2 = .21, adjusted R2 = .20) in job stress was accounted\nby the new model. The significant relationships among\nindividual variables were evaluated, leaving only the super-\nmodel.\nIn the third step, the variables for supervisory support\nand role conflict were entered into a regression equation\n(Model 3 in Table 3). Model 3, as a whole, correlated sig-\njob stress.

As before, significant contribu-\ntions of the independent variables were evaluated, and \"man-\nageable\" and \"amiable\" in the block of attitudes toward\ninmates were found to be significant.\nThe final model consisted of four variables significantly\naccounted for a total of 23% of the variability (R2 = .23,\nadjusted R2 = .22). The beta () values showed that job stress\nwas best predicted by supervisory support, role conflict,\n\"amiable,\" and \"manageable\" in this order ( = -.32, .17,\n.09, and -.07, respectively). Overall, results demonstrate that\nthe less supervisory support and the more role conflict the\nofficers reported, the higher their level of job stress. In terms\nof attitudes toward inmates, officers who view the inmates as\nintimidated and nonmanipulative reported lower levels of\njob stress, whereas the ones who view their inmates as\nfriendly, social, and warm reported higher levels of job\nstress.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe findings of this study yielded interesting results about\nthe effects of perceptions of inmates on job stress among\ncorrectional officers. First, officers who saw inmates as\nbeing manageable had lower levels of stress. This could be\nbecause officers who see inmates as devious (i.e., not\nstraightforward) are worried about being assaulted, being\nmanipulated by inmates, or see the perceived devious\nnature of inmates as a job stressor. However, views of\ninmates as being amiable was positively associated with\njob stress. Of particular interest is the finding that officers\nwho see inmates as warm, friendly, and social report higher\nlevels of stress. This would coincide with research on role\nconflict in which officers who see themselves as treatment-\noriented have higher levels of stress (Tewksbury & Higgins,\n2006). In particular, officers might find that their positive\nperceptions of inmates are not embraced by their coworkers\nThis, in turn, could cause stress and alienation. Officers\nwho are \"nice\" to offenders are often considered to be too\nfriendly, which could alienate them from coworkers and\nsupervisors. This alienation often solidifies the bond that\nthey have with the offender and further causes tension\nbetween themselves and officers (Worley & Cheeseman,\n2006). It could also be that officers who have positive per-\nceptions of inmates might find this to be an internal conflict\nas well as this goes against the traditional \"us versus them\"\nmentality in corrections (Cheeseman Dial, Kim, Lambert,\n& Hogan, 2011). In addition, officers who have positive\nviews of inmates could become closer to inmates, allowing\ninmates to take advantage of them, also causing stress.\nConversely, officers who see inmates as amiable might also\nfind their sociable nature annoying and would prefer that\nthe inmates kept their distance (Cheeseman Dial et al.,\n2011). Another area to consider that has yet to be addressed\nin the research literature is whether correctional officer\nstress causes negative views of inmates or if negative views\nof inmates cause stress. Correctional agencies may have to\nreexamine how officers perceive inmates and the impact\nthat this has on their feelings and perceptions about the job.\nLikewise, it is likely that inmates change how they interact\nwith staff over time, and these interactions probably influ-\nence the perceptions of officers. Longitudinal studies are\nneeded to explore how perceptions of inmates and job stress\nrelate to one another.\nOfficers receive training on many aspects of their jobs.\nBased on the results of this study, correctional agencies\nmight benefit from more training on offender personality\nand how inmates are perceived. Traditionally, officers are\ntaught that the offenders are the enemy and that their job is\nto ensure that offenders remain under control and con-\ntained within the correctional facility. This attitude is then\nreinforced in the correctional officer subculture and con-\ntinues to be perpetuated at many levels within correctional\nagencies (Cheeseman Dial et al., 2011). Correctional offi-\ncers might benefit from a balanced approach to dealing\nwith inmates. This might also help to alleviate correctional\nofficer role conflict. In addition, correctional agencies\nmight actually be able to use this as a tool to find correc-\ntional counselors or treatment professionals by finding\nofficers who have positive views of inmates and who see\ntheir potential for change. It might help to decrease job\nstress if correctional agencies could identify officers who\nare best suited for treatment-oriented positions or place\ntreatment-oriented officers in more treatment-oriented\nfacilities. In most correctional agencies, treatment is not a\nmajor function of correctional officers, and employees\nwho embrace a more treatment-oriented ideology might\nfind treatment-oriented work in the prison environment\nmore rewarding as well as less stressful (Toch & Grant,\nOne area that should be further explored is how percep-\ntions of inmates relate to correctional orientation among cor-\nrectional officers. The literature has dichotomized\ncorrectional orientation toward inmates into two categories:\nsupport for rehabilitation and support for punishment\n(Robinson et al., 1993). Support for punishment refers to a\nview that inmates while in prison should be punished for\ntheir crimes (Whitehead & Lindquist, 1989). Support for\nrehabilitation refers to a view that inmates should receive\ntreatment for their criminologic needs (Cullen et al., 1989;\nGriffin, 2002). Correctional orientation is a salient area to\nstudy because correctional officers often have prolonged\nMisis et al. 9\ninteractions with the inmates, which can influence either\ndirectly or indirectly the behaviors of offenders within prison\naddition, past research has observed that support for treat-\nment is positively associated with job involvement (i.e., psy-\nchological identification with the job), job satisfaction (i.e.,\nthe level of satisfaction with the job), and organizational\ncommitment (i.e., the level of psychological commitment to\nthe organization) among correctional staff, and conversely,\nsupport for punishment has a negative association with job\nsatisfaction and organizational commitment (Cullen et al.,\nsatisfaction, and organizational commitment have salient\noutcomes for correctional officers and correctional organiza-\ntional orientation is a salient concept to study among correc-\ntional officers.\nSupport for punishment and treatment were not directly\nmeasured in this study. While seems likely that holding\npositive views of inmates will be linked with support for\ntreatment, and, similarly, holding negative perceptions of\ninmates will likely be linked with greater levels of support\nfor punishment, no information on either form of correc-\ntional orientation was collected in the survey, so these\nhypotheses remain untested postulations. Future studies\nshould explore how perceptions of inmates relate to cor-\nrectional orientation. Moreover, correctional officers are\nlikely to hold mixed views on treatment and punishment.\nIn this study, the perceptions of inmates varied among the\nsurveyed officers. Some officers had far more positive\nviews of inmates than did others, who saw inmates in a\nvery negative light or who held a mixture of positive and\nnegative perceptions of inmates. Like perceptions of\ninmates, the two major dimensions of correctional orienta-\ntion are not mutually exclusive. Correctional officers can\nhave support for varying degrees of rehabilitation and pun-\nishment, as is also found among the general public (Cullen,\nPealer, Fisher, Applegate, & Santana, 2002). Research is\nneeded to identify the variables that are important in help-\ning shape the perceptions of inmates and correctional ori-\nentation of officers and why they vary as well as overlap\nwith one another.\nAn additional area of research to be considered is what\ncorrectional officers' views of inmates are when they first\nstart their jobs and what they think of inmates throughout\ntheir careers. It might be more stressful for individuals who\nstart out with positive perceptions of inmates to have them\nevolve into negative views, or the converse might be true.\nOfficers who start off with negative attitudes might experi-\nence high levels of stress if they also see life and their work\nas negative. It might also be interesting to determine whether\nmen and women perceive inmates differently and the impact\nthat this has on their job stress. Farkas (1999) found that\nfemale officers had a more punitive approach, while others\nhave found no relationship between gender and punitiveness\nIt could be that if women in this study held punitive views,\ncoupled with negative perceptions of inmates, might cause\nincreased levels of stress. This clearly needs to be explored\nin future studies.\nThis study was exploratory in nature; therefore, further\nresearch on the elements involved in views of inmates would\nbenefit not only correctional agencies but correctional offi-\ncers as well. It could be argued that one stressor might lead\nto another, which might lead to burnout and job dissatisfac-\ntion. As a result, path modeling might also be a way to\nunravel how the variables in this study affect job stress\namong correctional officers.\nAs with many studies, the current study had limitations.\nOne limitation of this study was that the research was con-\nducted in a single region of a Southern prison system. While\nthe results of this study are important, they may not be gen-\neralized to all correctional agencies across the United States.\nAdditional studies are needed at other correctional facilities\nto determine whether the results can be replicated. A study\nthat incorporates other regions of the United States and com-\npares perceptions of inmates among correctional officers\nwould be an important addition to the literature and may\nexplain why correctional officer stress is experienced differ-\nently in particular areas of the United States. In addition, the\nuse of a purposive sample did not include correctional offi-\ncers with less than 8 months of tenure, as these individuals\nwere not required to attend in-service training. New employ-\nees may provide information that could be critical in retain-\ning employees.\nAnother limitation was that no information was col-\nlected about security level. As security level may be associ-\nated with level of job stress, future studies should include\nthis measure. This current study was based on a cross-sec-\ntional design (i.e., data collected at one time), and as such,\ncausal relationships cannot be empirically demonstrated.\nAll that can be concluded at this time is that perceptions of\ninmates and job stress are associated with one another.\nLongitudinal studies are needed to demonstrate the causal\nrelationship between the two variables. Furthermore, the\ntype of facility/security level at which the participants\nworked was not asked in the survey, and as such, could not\nbe included in the analyses. It is very possible that the rela-\ntionships of perceptions of inmates and the other variables\nused in this study with job stress may vary by the type of\nfacility/security level. This is a salient issue that should be\naddressed in future research in this area. In addition to per-\nceptions of inmates, only three other workplace variables\n(i.e., peer support, supervisory support, and role conflict)\nwere included in the analyses. Additional workplace vari-\nables should be included in the analyses to see if additional\nvariance in job stress can be explained. In the current study,\nonly about 23% of the observed variance in the job stress\nindex was accounted for by the independent variables. This\nmeans that approximately 77% of the variance of job stress\nvariable is accounted for by other unknown variables.\nThese variables need to be identified and included in future\nstudies.\nAnother shortcoming of the current study was that the\nCronbach's alpha for the scales of peer support and role\nconflict were low, which raises the issue of reliability for\nthese measures. Future research needs to examine whether\nmore reliable measures would result in different findings.\nMoreover, additional research is needed to test the dimen-\nsionality of the perceptions of inmates observed in the cur-\nrent study. It could be that perceptions of inmates may be\ncontextual and situational, and as such, the results may vary\nbetween different types of correctional institutions. Future\nresearchers may wish to explore how perceptions of inmates\nare influenced by the correctional officer culture and social-\nization at different correctional institutions. Finally, it is\nunknown how perceptions of inmates would affect other\nsalient outcomes among correctional officers, such as orga-\nnizational commitment, job involvement, burnout, life sat-\nisfaction, absenteeism, and turnover. Future research in\nthese and other areas are needed. Although the study has\nlimitations, the empirical findings have potential implica-\ntions. It is hoped the current study will spark further\nresearch on the area of perceptions of inmates and how it\nrelated to job stress and other work outcomes among cor-\nrectional staff.\nCorrections is a business that involves people processing\npeople. It also requires intense and frequent interactions\nwith inmates. The synergistic effects of stressors associated\nwith working in corrections are exhibited in a variety of\nphysical and mental symptoms. Correctional executives\nand immediate supervisors who ignore these effects will\ninevitably be faced with lower levels of employee morale\nand higher levels of employee absenteeism, poor health,\nand turnover. It should also be noted that stress is a multi-\nfaceted and complex problem. This study is not meant to\nimply that perceptions of inmates are a sole cause of stress;\nit is just one piece of the puzzle to be considered. Essentially,\nfew studies have looked at how correctional officers actu-\nally perceived inmates and how these perceptions influence\nhow officers see their jobs and experience stress. To ignore\nthe interaction of correctional officers and offenders is to\nignore an area that can and does have profound effects on\ncorrectional officer stress.\nAppendix\nTable 3.
