The conclusion of many experimental studies has been that\nLuneburg's model does not describe visual space in various tasks and conditions. Remarkably, no\nalternative model has been suggested. The current study explores perspective transformations of\nEuclidean space as a model for visual space.

Euclid suggested that visual space was\nconfined to a cone having the apex in the eye and the base at the limits of vision (Burton,\n1945). In the 18th century, Reid proposed that visual space was spherical on the basis of the\nshape of the eyes (Suppes, 1977). Luneburg (1947) was the first who attempted to establish\nthe geometry of visual space by combining psychophysical data with mathematical analysis\nCorresponding author:\nCasper J Erkelens, Helmholtz Institute, Utrecht University, Padualaan 8, 3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands.\nEmail: c.j.erkelens@uu.nl\ni-Perception\nipe.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (http://www.us.\nsagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm)..\nalley experiments, the geometry proposed by Luneburg was based mainly on data of\nBlumenfeld. Blumenfeld (1913) used two experimental tasks consisting of positioning alleys\nof small flames by making judgments about their parallelism and equidistance. The claim\nmade by Luneburg was that the different results from the two alley experiments were evidence\nfor a non-Euclidean geometry of visual space. Luneburg (1947, 1950) proposed a hyperbolic\ngeometry possessing negative Gaussian curvature. Blumenfeld's alley experiments have been\nrepeated and extended several times (Battro, di Pierro Netto & Rozenstraten, 1976; Hardy,\n1956). All studies concluded that visual space is curved although a few authors challenged its\nhyperbolic nature. Foley (1972) conducted experiments in which subjects judged visual\nangles, that is, angles between visual directions, and ratios between perceived frontal and\negocentric extents. He found that the ratio of perceived frontal to egocentric extent greatly\nexceeded the physical ratio, while perceived visual angles corresponded closely to physical\nones. Foley (1972) concluded that perceived distances and perceived visual angles are the\nproduct of different and independent processes. A possible consequence of Foley's conclusion\nis that perceived angles and distances do not constitute a single visual space. Later studies did\nnot consider this possibility and persevered in constructing curved visual spaces by combining\nDoumen, & Todd, 2008; Koenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, & Todd, 2002; Koenderink, van\nSchoumans, Kappers, & Koenderink, 2000; Todd, Oomes, Koenderink, & Kappers, 2001;\nWagner, 1985). All authors compared their experimental results with predictions of\nLuneburg's model of a curved visual space and reported all sorts of deviations.\nDependence of results on task, reference, distance, and instruction questioned Luneburg's\nmodel of visual space and culminated in even questioning visual space itself (Koenderink\net al., 2008). Here the effort is undertaken to investigate whether a model of visual space that\nis very different from Luneburg's model can restore the entity of visual space.\nLinear perspective used by artists starting from the Renaissance is a mathematical system\nfor projecting three-dimensional scenes onto two-dimensional surfaces, such as paper,\ncanvas, or a screen. Parallel lines receding in the three-dimensional scenes converge to a\nvanishing point in such projections. Furthermore, distant objects are imaged smaller than\nequally sized near ones. Linear perspective prescribes how three-dimensional scenes are\nimaged on surfaces. It does not prescribe how we perceive such scenes in pictures and in\nthe free field. From just looking at a straight railway line or road, it is obvious that\nperspective is present in visual perception of real three-dimensional scenes and, thus, a\nproperty of visual space. Actually, it is odd that visual space is such a deformed\nrepresentation of physical space. In view of plasticity of cortical maps (Singer, 1995), one\nwould expect that visual space would adapt to long-term and systematic deviations from\nphysical space. Apparently, adaptation does not occur. Instead, human beings have both\nperspective and Euclidean representations of physical space at their disposal. For example,\nwe see on the one hand that a road narrows in front of us but on the other hand we are\nconfident that it does not. The availability of different representations gives human beings the\npossibility to answer questions about spatial relationships in different ways. For instance:\nWhat is the angle between rails of a railway track or between the lane dividers of a road? One\nanswer expresses properties of visual space whereas the other may express experience with\nphysical space in general and knowledge of rails and roads in particular. Recently, I argued\nthat we see the world in perspective not because we view it from one or two vantage points,\nbut because lines vanish at a finite distance (Erkelens, 2015a).\nPerspective has not been considered as a constituent of models of visual space, probably\nbecause experiments have usually been conducted in near space where influence of\nperspective is assumed negligible. However, this argument does not justify the complete\nabsence of perspective in discussions of visual space. For instance, Battro et al. (1976)\nused distances up to 240 m in their alley experiments without even mentioning perspective\nin their paper. Recent studies showed that angles perceived between lane dividers of a straight\nroad (Osa et al., 2011) or between rails of a straight railway track (Erkelens, 2015a) were\nremarkably large. Depending on eye height, perceived angles ranged between 20 and 70 in\nindividual subjects. In a curved visual space, such large perspective angles, distinctive of a\nhighly curved space, are incompatible with perceived distances of vanishing points of many\nhundreds of metres. The purpose of this study is to explore the geometry of spaces that are\nperspective transformations of the Euclidean, physical space. Another purpose is to\ninvestigate whether such a space, dubbed perspective space, can explain the experimental\nresults of previous studies of visual space, among which the classic parallel and distance alley\nGeometry of Perspective Space\nVisual space as a perspective transformation of Euclidean space has hardly been explored in\nthe literature (Lehar, 2003). This is curious because perspective is so obviously a property of\nvisual perception, especially at long distances. Vanishing points at a specific finite distance are\na distinctive property of perspective space (Erkelens, 2015a, 2015b). Both physical space and\nretinal images can be regarded as limiting cases of perspective space because physical space is\ncharacterized by vanishing points at infinite distance and retinal images are characterized by\nvanishing points at zero distance. In this respect, perspective space constitutes a natural\nbridge between the geometric properties of retinal images and physical environment.\nTo explore the geometry of perspective spaces, computations were made on points and\nlines in physical space. Figure 1a shows the basic idea behind the computations. The\nCartesian grid represents a plane in physical space that includes the centers of both eyes.\nThe blue lines represent parallel and equidistant lines in the straight-ahead viewing direction\nin physical space. Lines converging to a vanishing point at finite distance in perspective space,\nwhich are associated with lines in parallel to the viewing direction in physical space, are\ndubbed perspective lines from now on. The red lines in Figure 1(a) are perspective lines\nassociated with viewing in the straight-ahead direction. Each position in physical space is\nspecified by an egocentric direction and distance. Using a polar coordinate system is\nappropriate for vision because directions and distances result from different processes.\nInformation about directions follows from retinal and eye position signals whereas\ndistances require interpretation of nonpositional properties of the retinal stimulus\n(Erkelens, 2012). In the computations we assume that directions of objects in perspective\nspace are identical to their egocentric directions in physical space. The position of a stimulus\nin perspective space is computed from its position in physical space by finding the\nintersections between directional and perspective lines. In this way, the distances of stimuli\nare given by the structure of perspective space. The distance of the vanishing point determines\nthe distance of stimuli in perspective space. The distance of the vanishing point represents the\nweighted sum of all depth cues. If depth cues such as disparity, size, blur, and ocular vergence\ntogether would indicate veridical depth, then the vanishing point would be located at infinity.\nErkelens 3\nDepth is not veridical in perspective space. The distance of the vanishing point indicates the\nunderestimation of depth. Figure 1(a) shows that a straight line-piece in physical space\n(the row of blue lines) transfers to a straight line-piece in perspective space (the row of red\ndots and lines). Conserved straightness implies that collinearity is preserved in perspective\nspace. Figure 1(b) shows that two parallel line-pieces in physical space are generally not\nparallel in perspective space. Fronto-parallel line-pieces are the exception. Implication of\nthe directional differences is that parallelism is not preserved in perspective space. Both\nproperties, that is, violated parallelism and preserved collinearity, are also properties of\nvisual space. Evidence comes from experiments in which subjects were asked to set bars in\nparallel (Cuijpers et al., 2000) and collinear (Cuijpers et al., 2002). Figure 1(c) shows that\nangles between orthogonal lines in physical space are non-orthogonal in perspective space.\nSimilar differences between physical and perspective angles were measured in a recent study\nin which subjects judged angles between bars oriented in depth (Erkelens, 2015b). Agreement\nbetween computations and experimental results regarding preserved collinearity, violated\nparallelism, and large angular deviations shows that perspective space is an attractive\ncandidate model of visual space as far as directions and angles are concerned.\nFigure 2 shows relations between distances and distances in physical and perspective\nspace. Due to the finite vanishing point in perspective space, distances are shorter than\ntheir equivalents in physical space. Distances in perspective space decrease relative to\ndistances in physical space with increasing egocentric distance. The graph at the bottom of\nFigure 2(a) illustrates the relationship by showing the highest ratio between distances in\nperspective and physical space at the shortest egocentric distance. Figure 2(b) shows the\nrelationships for sizes of differently oriented line-pieces. The graph at the bottom indicates\nFigure 1. Transformations from physical to perspective space. Panels show stimuli (blue dots and lines) in a\nplane of physical space and their equivalents in perspective space (red dots and lines). Gray dots indicate the\npositions of the eyes. Panel (a) shows a set of seven dots (blue) arranged along a straight line in physical space.\nThe dots are lying on equidistant lines (blue) that vanish at infinity in the straight-ahead viewing direction. In\nperspective space the lines (red) converge to a finite vanishing point. Dots have identical egocentric directions\nin physical and perspective space (dashed blue lines). Panel (b) shows dots (blue) arranged along two parallel\nlines in physical space and their equivalents (red) in perspective space. Panel (c) shows dots (blue) arranged\nalong two orthogonal lines in physical space and their non-orthogonal equivalents (red) in perspective space.\nFor reasons of clarity the underlying directional and perspective lines are not drawn in panels (b) and (c).\nthat ratios between perspective and physical sizes decrease approximately exponentially as a\nfunction of distance in the depth direction. Figure 2(a) and (b) shows that sizes are not\ninvariant under translation and rotation in perspective space. The size ratios are consistent\nwith experimental evidence that perceived sizes are underestimated (Gilinsky, 1951) and\ncompression of size in depth relative to frontal size increases with distance (Li, Phillips, &\nDurgin, 2011). Perspective space as a model of visual space provides geometrical explanations\nfor these experimental findings.\nExperimentally, Koenderink et al. (2002) found that visual space fulfills the Pappus\ncondition, implying that visual space is a homogenous projective space. The Pappus\ncondition is fulfilled if connections (dashed lines in Figure 2(c)) between two sets of\ncollinear triples of points (the top and bottom rows of blue and red dots) constitute a\ncollinear triple of intersections (the middle rows of blue and red dots). Positions of the set\nof red dots in Figure 2(c) were computed by transforming the positions of dots from physical\nto perspective space. The middle row of red dots shows that the intersections are collinear in\nperspective space. The Pappus condition is fulfilled because collinearity is preserved in\nperspective space (Figure 1(a)).\nFigure 2. Transformation of distances from physical to perspective space. Panels show stimuli (blue dots\nand lines) in physical space and their equivalents in perspective space (red dots and lines). Gray dots indicate\nthe positions of the eyes. Panel (a) shows two sets of blue dots in a plane in physical space arranged along\nstraight, frontal line-pieces at different distances from the viewer (big dots at short distance and small dots at\nlong distance). Their perspective equivalents are shown in red. Line segments are numbered from 1 to 6.\nRatios between interdot distances in perspective and physical space are shown at the bottom. The horizontal\nlines through the data indicate that ratios are constant for dots placed along a frontal line.

It is obvious that the parameters may\nvary across observers and conditions. Distance of vanishing point may depend on context as\nwas recently shown in judgments of perspective angles between rails (Erkelens, 2015a).\nDistances were about 5 m for judgments made in a full-cue, natural environment and\nabout 0.3 m for judgments made from pictures of the same scene. Fixation direction is\nfixed in some psychophysical experiments but not in others and certainly not under\nnatural viewing conditions. It is relevant to know how the two parameters affect the\npositions of objects in perspective space. Figure 3 shows the positions of points in\nFigure 3. Effect of vanishing distance and fixation direction on perspective space. Panels show physical\nstimuli (blue dots and lines) and their equivalents in perspective space (red dots and lines). Gray dots indicate\nthe positions of the eyes. Panels (a) show the panels of Figure 1 but now for the conditions that the vanishing\npoint is at half the distance. Panels (b) show the panels of Figure 1 for a fixation direction of about 10 to the\nleft side.\nperspective space for a short distance of the vanishing point (Figure 3(a)) and an oblique\ndirection of fixation (Figure 3(b)).\nComparison of Figures 1 and 3 shows that different vanishing distances and fixation\ndirections do not affect perspective space in qualitative terms. The main properties, that is,\npreserved collinearity, violated parallelism, and angular deviations, are retained in the\ndifferent conditions. Quantitatively, however, there are differences. Distance of vanishing\npoint has a substantial effect on orientations of line-pieces in perspective space\n(Figure 3(a)). A shorter distance of the vanishing point (by a factor of 2) was associated\nwith larger perspective angles (133 vs. 117). Similar results were found for judgments made\nin the natural environment and from pictures of perspective angles of roads and rails\n(Erkelens, 2015a; Osa et al., 2011) and perspective angles between converging and\ndiverging bars (Erkelens, 2015b). It seems a fair interpretation of the experimental findings\nthat contextual differences affect vanishing distance and perspective angles. Based on other\ntypes of experimental results, other authors have earlier argued that the geometry of visual\nThe oblique direction of fixation slightly affected the orientations of line-pieces in perspective\nspace. The subtle differences are visible in Figures 1 and 3 by closely comparing the positions\nof dots and lines. The change in fixation direction of 10 to the left resulted in a leftward\nrotation of 4 of all line-pieces. As a consequence, perspective angles between line-pieces were\npreserved. Small but significant effects of fixation have been reported for measurements of the\ngeometry of visual space (Ehrenstein, 1977) and for bisection judgments in visual grasp space\n(Trommersha\nBlumenfeld's Parallel and Distance Alleys\nA critical test for the perspective space model is being able to describe the parallel and\ndistance alleys of Blumenfeld (1913) because on the basis of these alleys Luneburg (1947,\n1950) concluded that visual space had to be a Riemannian space of constant curvature.\nTo make the alley results accessible to computation, Blumenfeld's data were reanalyzed\nand rearranged. Blumenfeld (1913) reported the parallel and distance alleys in an extensive\npaper of 160 pages including 73 tables, written in the German language. Each table lists the\nsettings made by one subject under one (parallel or equidistant) instruction. Four subjects\nproduced complete sets of data in both types of alley experiments. Blumenfeld (1913) did not\nprovide an oversight of these data. Therefore, parallel and distance alleys were constructed\nfrom Blumenfeld's tables for these four subjects (Figure 4). Mean settings were computed of\nall settings made by individual subjects. No distinction was made between measurements in\nwhich stimuli were presented simultaneously or in succession.\nStimuli and results are presented here in the format used by Blumenfeld (1913), which\nmeans that frontal distance is amplified by a factor of four relative to distance in the depth\ndirection. The square elements of the grids shown in Figure 4 represent frontal distances of\n0.1 m and in-depth distances of 0.4 m. Amplification of frontal distances, which has also been\nexaggerates, the differences between parallel and distance alleys. Stimuli were little flames\nat the end of thin vertical tubes in a further dark room or thin vertical rods in a lit room. The\nflames (rods) could move only sideways except for the two flames (rods) at the far end, which\nstood at fixed places. Subjects received very detailed instructions. For the parallel-alley\nexperiment, the instructions were as follows: ``Adjust the little flames (rods) so that the\nErkelens 7\n(virtual) lines connecting them with the most distant flames (rods) appear to you as parallel,\nsymmetrical, straight lines, that is, that the two rows from front to rear and back do not\nconverge or diverge. The observation must be made with free viewing along the rows, if\npossible, in a casual manner''. For the distance alleys, the instructions were as follows:\n``Adjust the lights so that the lateral distance between the two flames of each pair appears\nequal to that of the farthest pair. It is not necessary that the interflame distances of the other\npairs seem equal to each other. If possible, one should not look at the rows oriented in depth\non each side. It is not allowed to use the absolute size of a distance expressed in any objective\nmeasure (cm or m) during the comparison of distances''. Figure 4 shows that the subjects\nproduced rather symmetric alleys, with little intersubject variability. All subjects set the\ndistance alley wider than the parallel alley. The flames (rods) were placed in almost\nstraight lines in the parallel-alley experiment. The trajectories were curved outward in the\ndistance-alley experiment mainly as a result of the settings of the near pairs of stimuli.\nFigure 4. Parallel and distance alleys as measured by Blumenfeld (1913). Panels show the stimuli at their\ninitial locations (blue dots) and the mean settings of four subjects under the instructions of parallelism (red\ndots) and equidistance (green dots). The panel labeled Means shows the settings averaged across the four\nsubjects. Gray dots indicate the positions of the eyes.\nComputation of Blumenfeld's Alleys\nBlumenfeld's parallel and distance alleys were computed by transforming positions of stimuli\nfrom physical space to perspective space and vice versa. First, the settings were computed for\nthe parallel-alley task. To that end positions in perspective space were computed for\nBlumenfeld's stimuli at their initial positions in physical space (Figure 5(a)). Stimuli\n(red dots) had egocentric directions in perspective space that were identical to those in\nphysical space but were lying on two perspective lines meeting at a certain finite vanishing\npoint. At this point of the computation, the choice for the position of the vanishing point was\nprovisional because its final location depended on the final settings of the stimuli in physical\nspace in the parallel-alley task. The next operation was to shift the stimuli sideways in\nperspective space so that they formed a parallel alley (Figure 5(b)). The shifts were made\nsideways because in Blumenfeld's experiments the stimuli could only be displaced sideways in\nphysical space. In perspective space, the farthest stimulus was kept at a fixed position because\nin Blumenfeld's experiments the farthest stimulus had a fixed position in physical space.\nThe positions of the stimuli in physical space were computed from the new positions of\nthe stimuli in perspective space by finding the intersections between the new directional\nlines and the frontal lines along which the stimuli could move in physical space. Finally,\nthe position of the vanishing point was found by trial and error, guided by the criterion that\ncomputed settings (Figure 5(b)) were as close as possible to the mean settings of subjects in\nBlumenfeld's experiment (Figure 4). A vanishing point located at 0.74 m from the viewer gave\nthe best result. Then the mean deviation of the computed positions was as small as\nAfter having made their final settings in the parallel-alley task of Blumenfeld's experiment,\nsubjects reported that the nearer stimuli pairs were set closer to each other than the farthest\nFigure 5. Computed parallel and distance alleys. Panel (a) shows Blumenfeld's stimuli (blue dots) arranged\nalong two parallel and equidistant lines (blue lines). Blue dashed lines indicate their egocentric directions. In\nperspective space the stimuli (small red dots) are aligned along two (red) lines converging to a vanishing point\nlocated at a finite distance from the observer. Panel (b) shows how the stimuli in physical space (red dots\nconnected by blue lines) have to be positioned in order to align the stimuli in two parallel rows in perspective\nspace (small red dots). Panel (c) shows the computed parallel (red dots) and equidistance (green dots) alleys\nin physical space together with the parallel alleys (small red dots) and equidistant alleys (small green dots) in\nperspective space.\nErkelens 9\npair (Blumenfeld, 1913). In the distance-alley task, Blumenfeld asked subjects to adjust the\ndistance between pairs of stimuli so that distances between stimuli were judged equidistant.\nConsequently, subjects set the distance between nearer stimuli pairs wider in the distance-\nalley task than in the parallel-alley task. In the current computations, the frontal distance\nbetween each pair in the distance alley was obtained by multiplying frontal interstimulus\ndistances of the parallel alley with a factor related to the in-depth distances of the stimulus\npairs in perspective space. The distance alley (Figure 5(c)) was computed by choosing the\nfactor of multiplication equal to the ratio between the in-depth distances of farthest stimulus\npair and stimulus pair under evaluation. The multiplication factor resulted in very good\nagreement of the computed distance alley with the experimental settings of Blumenfeld\n(1913). The mean deviation of the computed positions of the distance alley was just\nDiscussion\nPerspective Space as a Model of Visual Space\nPerspective is a so familiar property of visual perception that it seems totally\nunremarkable for both laymen and scholars. Only very recently perspective space was\nconsidered as a model of visual space (Erkelens, 2015a, 2015b). Although replacing\ninfinite vanishing points in Euclidean space by finite vanishing points in perspective\nspace may seem a minor operation, the geometry of perspective space is considerably\ndifferent from that of Euclidean space. Angles and distances are not invariant under\ntranslation and rotation as they are in Euclidean space. A common property of both\nspaces is that they are flat. Properties of perspective space have been investigated here in\ntwo dimensions. However, inclusion of the eyes was the only restriction applied to the\ncomputations made for line-pieces in two-dimensional planes. Rotation of the planes\nabout the interocular axis generalizes the observed properties of perspective space from\ntwo to three dimensions.\nAgreement between computational and experimental results shows that perspective space\nis an appropriate model for visual space, particularly in relation to perceived directions and\nangles. It is noteworthy that in the perspective space model distance of the vanishing point\ndetermines the distances of stimuli. Experimental findings show that perceived distance in the\ndepth direction does not fit well within the concept of perspective space. The computations\npresented in Figure 2 show that distance in perspective space has an approximately\nexponential relationship to distance in physical space. Experimentally, very different\nrelationships have been reported, showing just small differences between perceived and\nperspective angles were found to be highly incongruent with perceived distances of\nvanishing points (Erkelens, 2015a). Perspective angles predicted that vanishing points\nwould be as close as just a few metres from the observer. In contrast, distance judgments\nof the vanishing points gave estimates of many hundreds of metres. Remarkably, the distance\nalleys of Blumenfeld (1913) were well described by the perspective space model in\ncombination with the size-distance invariance hypothesis. The good and bad fits seem to\nimply that perspective space is an appropriate model for perceived distance ratios of stimuli\nbut not for perceived distances. This combination of predicted distance ratios and non-\npredicted distances suggests the existence of a factor that is needed to convert perceived\ndistance ratios into perceived distances. Cognition of distances resulting from experience\nwith the physical world may be the source of this factor.\nInterpretation of Blumenfeld's Alleys\nThe parallel alleys in physical space of Blumenfeld (1913) were obtained by computing the\nphysical positions of stimuli associated with parallel alleys in perspective space. Agreement\nbetween computed and experimental alleys was very good. The computed alleys were\nsymmetric because a single vanishing point was assumed for both rows of the alleys.\nAgreement would even have been better if the computational results would have been\noptimized for stimuli on the left and right rows separately. The perspective model of visual\nspace contains two free parameters, namely, distance and direction of the vanishing point, the\nformer related to context and the latter to direction of fixation. Optimal distance of the\nvanishing point of 0.74 m may seem extremely short. Judgments of perspective angles of\nphysical rails showed that distance of the vanishing point decreased with eye height and\nbecame as short as 1 to 2 m for an eye height of 0.40 m (Erkelens, 2015a). In Blumenfeld's\nexperiments, subjects viewed the stimuli at eye level or at an eye height of just 0.07 m. Thus, in\nrelation to the railway track experiments, the vanishing distance of 0.74 m is not an\nunrealistic distance.\nThe distance alleys were computed from the parallel alleys by multiplying the interstimulus\nseparations with factors related to distance in the depth direction. Again, agreement between\ncomputed and experimental alleys was very good. For explaining the distance alleys, it may be\nrelevant to look at the instructions that were given to the subjects in Blumenfeld's experiments\n(see Blumenfeld's Parallel and Distance Alleys). Wagner (2006) described four types of\ninstructions, namely, objective, perspective, apparent, and projective. The objective and\nperspective instructions ask subjects to adjust the positions and directions of stimuli as they\nare in physical space. Blumenfeld's instructions were different. The extensive instructions of\nBlumenfeld (1913) even assigned subjects to ignore certain properties of the stimuli in physical\nspace. Blumenfeld gave the apparent instructions, which means that he emphasized the\nsubjective or phenomenal experience of parallelism and distance (Wagner, 2006). The\nprojective instruction asks subjects to adjust the angular extent of stimuli. Blumenfeld (1913)\ndid certainly not give this type of instruction in the distance-alley task because subjects should\nnot look at the rows oriented in depth. According to the size-distance invariance hypothesis\n(Epstein, 1963; Wagner, 2006), the perceived distances between pairs of stimuli were equally\nlarge when the stimuli were seen to converge to the finite vanishing point (Figure 5(a)).\nThe consequence of displacing the nearer stimuli inwards such that they became parallel in\nperspective space (Figure 5(b)) was that perceived distances between nearer pairs of stimuli\nbecame shorter. Apparently, equidistance was reestablished by multiplying interstimulus\ndistances between nearer pairs with ratios between far and near stimulus depths. Applying\nthe size-distance invariance hypothesis to the parallel-alley data produced a realistic distance\nalley (Figure 5(c)) provided that the computations used depth values in perspective space.\nThe parallel and distance alleys of Blumenfeld (1913) are explained within the framework\nof perspective space if we assume that subjects mixed up the metrics of both visual and\nphysical spaces. We, human beings, seem to have two notions of parallelism, one related\nto physical space and another to visual space, although it is not quite clear how we define and\ncalibrate parallelism in visual space. Maybe we compensate for the perceived angle between\nparallel lines in physical space to arrive at parallelism in visual space. Parallelism is a rather\ntroublesome concept outside Euclidean and affine geometries. Parallelism is equivalent with\nequidistance in Euclidean space. This equivalence is not valid in Riemannian and perspective\nspaces. In Riemannian models of visual space, parallelism is assumed equivalent with\ngeodesics (Blank, 1953; Luneburg, 1950). However, it is just an assumption. Ironically, the\ntrajectories orthogonal to geodesics are known as geodesic parallels in differential geometry.\nIn visual space parallelism is not equivalent with equidistance because, if it were, parallel and\ndistance alleys would be indistinguishable. The perspective model of visual space explains the\nparallel alleys. Figure 5(b) shows that parallelism in visual space is associated with divergent\nparallel alleys in physical space. The divergent parallel alleys are just slightly different from\negocentric directions (blue dashed lines in Figure 5(b)). This fact implies that the observation\nof Koenderink, van Doorn, de Ridder, and Oomes (2010), that visual rays in physical space\nseem parallel in visual space, is explained by the perspective structure of visual space. The\ndistance alleys are explained by the model in combination with size-distance invariance.\nComputed distance alleys resembled measured distance alleys if in-depth distances were\nused as they are in perspective, and thus, visual space. Using physical distances would\nhave resulted in equidistant alleys as they are in physical space.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nBattro, A.
