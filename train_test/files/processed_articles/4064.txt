This study evaluated\nthe efficacy of a 10% w/v fipronil-based spot-on solution in 15 cats with natural Neotrombicula species infestation.\nMethods Ten cats received 1 drop per affected site on day (D)0 and D14, with the rest of the 0.5 ml pipette applied\non the skin between the shoulders. Five cats served as non-treated controls. Parasite score (0 = absent; 3 = severe,\n>10 parasites/zone) was assessed on D0, D14 and D28 on all animals. Skin lesions (SCORing Feline Allergic\nDermatitis lesion severity scale [SCORFAD]) and investigator pruritus scale (IPS; 0 = cat comfortable, grooming like\nany normal cat; 4 = cat uncomfortable, pruritic all the time) were assessed on treated cats on the same days. Global\nassessment of efficacy, tolerance and ease of use (GAS; 1 = very poor; 5 = excellent) was assessed on D28.\nResults All the cats completed the study. Parasite scores of the control cats were maintained throughout the trial\ndecreased throughout the trial. On D28, the GAS was 4.2 \u00b1 0.9. There were no adverse effects from treatment.\nConclusions and relevanceThe 10% w/v fipronil preparation appeared to be effective, safe and practical in the\ntreatment of localised Neotrombicula species infestation in these cats.\nUDEAR, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, INSERM, ENVT, Toulouse, France\nMedical Department, Virbac SA, Carros, France\nDermatology Service, Small Animal Hospital, Universit\u00e9 de\nToulouse, ENVT, Toulouse, France\nCorresponding author:\nMarie C Cadiergues Dr Med Vet, DipECVD, PhD, UDEAR,\nUniversit\u00e9 de Toulouse, INSERM, ENVT, 23 Chemin des Capelles,\nEmail: mc.cadiergues@envt.fr\nShort Communication\nThe purpose of the present study was to assess the\nefficacy of a 10% w/v fipronil-based spot-on solution\n(Effipro 50 mg spot-on solution for cats; Virbac) in cats\nnaturally infested with N autumnalis.\nMaterials and methods\nFifteen client-owned cats, living outdoors or with out-\ndoor access, were recruited in the south west of France.\nBoth owner consent and approval from the university's\nethics committee were obtained prior to beginning the\nstudy. Inclusion criteria were the presence of N autumna-\nlis mites on day 0 (D0) and the absence of change in the\nlifestyle of the cat for the duration of the study. As trom-\nbiculiasis is a seasonal skin disease, five cats living in dif-\nferent households, but in the same geographical areas,\nwere included in parallel and left untreated, serving\nas sentinels to ensure that the tested population would\nbe exposed to potential re-infestations throughout the\nstudy. Control cats were selected with few or no skin\nlesions. Exclusion criteria included cats younger than\n2 months of age or weighing <1 kg, cats with a systemic\nillness or condition that could deteriorate within the fol-\nlowing month, and cats with signs or history of allergic\nskin diseases. Cats that had received an acaricidal treat-\nment within the previous 6 weeks were also excluded.\nThe study consisted of three visits. Parasitological and\ndermatological evaluations were conducted on the day of\n2 days) or closing visit for all treated cats; control cats\nwere only assessed for parasitic score. Each case was\nevaluated by the same investigator throughout the study.\nParasite score (PS) was assessed on each body area with a\nmagnifying lens, on a 0\u00ad3 scale (0 = absence; 1 = mild,\n3 = severe, >10 parasites/area). Skin lesions were scored\naccording to the SCORing Feline Allergic Dermatitis\nlesion severity scale (SCORFAD), a scoring system used\npreviously.8,9 The SCORFAD is a numerical rating scoring\nsystem to assess the severity of excoriations, miliary der-\nmatitis, eosinophilic plaques and self-induced alopecia in\neach of 10 body regions, resulting in a total lesion score of\n0\u00ad16 per region. Each lesion type was numerically scored\nindependently on a 0\u00ad4 scale (0 = none; 1 = very mild;\n2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe). The 10 body regions\nevaluated were the head, neck, dorsal and lateral thorax,\nrump and tail, flanks, sternum and axilla, abdomen, peri-\nneum, forelimbs and paws, hindlimbs and paws. The\ninvestigator evaluated the intensity of pruritus on a 0\u00ad4\nscale (investigator pruritus score [IPS]; 0 = the cat was\ncomfortable, grooming like any normal cat; 1 = the cat\nwas grooming, but it was tolerable and the cat remained\ncalm; 2 = the cat was grooming, but it was generally tol-\nerable; 3 = the cat was grooming quite often; the cat was\nuncomfortable, nervous or often agitated; 4 = the cat was\nuncomfortable, grooming all the time) on each visit.\nGlobal assessment of efficacy, tolerance and ease of use\n(GAS; 1 = very poor; 5 = excellent) was assessed on D28\nby the owner, independently of the investigator. PS, IPS\nand GAS have previously been used internally for other\nclinical studies although not in published studies.\nTreatment was applied on D0 and D14 by the investi-\ngator. One 0.5 ml Effipro 50 mg spot-on solution for cats\n(fipronil 50 mg; Virbac) pipette was used per cat on each\nday of treatment. One drop was applied on each affected\nsite. The rest was applied on the skin, in the neck region,\nbetween the shoulders.\nPS reduction was calculated at each time point (t)\nusing the arithmetic mean of PS according to the follow-\ning formula: PS reduction (%) = 100 \u00d7 (mean day 0 \u00ad\nmean t)/mean day 0. Similarly, SCORFAD reduction and\nIPS reduction were calculated using the same formula.\nWilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare\ndata obtained on D14 and D28 with the baseline obtained\non day 0. Significance was defined as P <0.05. All statis-\n(Addinsoft SARL).\nResults\nAll 15 cats completed the study. The first cat was included\non 4 October and the last one was included on 2\nNovember.

In dogs,\na line-on solution containing a permethrin\u00adpyriproxyfen\ncombination was tested successfully on nine dogs.10 As\nin the study by Nuttall et al,7 we elected to apply the\nfipronil solution directly on the infested sites. This\nallowed a higher concentration of the active ingredient\nin the sites where the parasites are attached. In most\ncases, parasites were present in the interdigital spaces or\non the pinnal margins. After application of a spot-on for-\nmulation on the skin between the shoulders, as recom-\nmended on the summary of product characteristics, it is\nexpected that the product spreads at the body surface\nand that the concentration is minimal at the most dis-\ntanced body regions. Furthermore, these body regions\nare classically groomed by cats, possibly over-groomed\nif there is pruritus. Applying the product directly on the\nparasitised areas ensures a direct efficacy on the para-\nsites already attached and is expected to better prevent\nre-infestations as mites seem to colonise one or few sites\non a given cat.3 The presence of the highest concentra-\ntion of the product where the parasites are supposed to\nattach is expected to prevent their attachment more rap-\nidly and more efficiently.\nThe design of the pipette allows a precise, controlled\ndose to be applied exactly where it is needed. A gentle\npressure on the body of the pipette releases the product\non the skin; when the pressure stops, the product stays\nin the pipette without any dripping.\nWe elected to include a control group to ensure that\nthe cats receiving the treatment would be exposed to\nharvest mites throughout the study. In the few studies\ninvestigating an acaricidal activity against N autumnalis,\nnone had a control group.3,6,7 As trombiculiasis is a sea-\nsonal parasitic disease, in the absence of a control group,\nthe absence of parasites on treated animals could be mis-\ninterpreted. In addition to living areas close to those of\ntreated cats, we based the selection of control cats on a\nlevel of infestation similar to that of treated cats.\nHowever, we found it to be more ethical to only select\ncontrol cats with few or no skin lesions as they would\nremain untreated.\nThe SCORFAD index of treated cats both before and\nafter was low, considering that the maximum possible\nscore is 160. The SCORFAD index is adapted for cats\nwith allergic skin disease. Cats with trombiculiasis are\nnot necessarily allergic, which may explain the low score\nof cats that were included. This clinical score is helpful as\nit expresses the clinical improvement, as IPS does.\nHowever, they remain secondary outcome criteria in this\nstudy and should not be over-interpreted, particularly as\nincluded cats were not very pruritic.\nThe product is licensed in cats for the treatment of flea\nand tick infestations. The product has a persistent insec-\nticidal efficacy for up to 5 weeks against fleas and a per-\nsistent acaricidal efficacy for up to 2 weeks against ticks.\nIn the current study, the product was applied twice at a\n2 week interval, based on the approved tick indication in\nEurope and on published results.7 All cats tolerated the\ntwo applications well.\nConclusions\nIn the cats in the present study, the 10% w/v fipronil\npreparation appeared to be effective, safe and practical\nin the treatment of localised Neotrombicula species infes-\ntation. Recommending the use of the product every\n2 weeks from September to November in cats that suffer\nfrom trombiculiasis is likely to help in controlling the\nparasitic disease.\nConflict of interestCN is an employee of Virbac SA.
