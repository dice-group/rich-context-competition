Future\nresearch needs to examine medication use by specific causes of cognitive impairment.\nIntroduction\nElderly people are substantial consumers of medica-\ntions [1--7]. Community-based surveys reveal that they\ntake an average of 2.7 to 3.9 prescription and non-\nprescription medications [3, 5-7]. While medications\ncan be beneficial in palliation and treatment of disease,\nthere is concern that elderly people are more prone to\ndrug-related problems such as inappropriate prescrib-\ning, and adverse drug reactions [1, 8--10]. Health\nprofessionals, if knowledgeable about those factors\nassociated with medication use patterns, can be more\nvigilant in their efforts to provide optimal pharma-\ncotherapy for their elderly patients.\nA number of factors are associated with increased\ndrug use including advanced age, female sex, white\nrace, poor health status and access to health care [1, 4,\n7]. The association of cognitive impairment with drug\nuse by elderly people has not been thoroughly\ninvestigated. The few relevant published studies have\nfocused primarily on people with cognitive impairment\ndue to dementia, and were either limited to the use of\nmedications by a select group of patients [11, 12] or\nfailed to include an adequate control group for\nThere are several reasons why examination of the\nassociation between medication use patterns and\ncognitive impairment may be important. First, cogni-\ntive impairment is disabling, stressful to family and\ncaregivers, costly, and common in the elderly popula-\ntion [14]. Among community-dwelling participants in\nthe Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program, severe\ncognitive impairment was found in 4.9% of persons\nSecond, among known risk factors for cognitive\nimpairment, one of the most common is medication\nimpaired individuals may be under- or over-medicated.\nUnder-utilization of medications is of concern since\nthose who are cognitively impaired may be less able to\nreport symptoms that would lead to appropriate\ntherapy. Moreover, appropriate therapy may not be\ninitiated because physicians may be influenced by the\nknowledge that the patient is cognitively impaired.\nOver-utilization of medications by cognitively impaired\nelderly people is of concern owing to the risks\nassociated with inappropriate prescribing and adverse\nGiven these issues and the growing number of drugs\nunder investigation for the treatment of dementia\n[24--26], documentation of the prescribing and self-\nmedication patterns of cognitively impaired elderly\npeople is needed to guide health policy and future\nclinical research. The purpose of this study was to\ndetermine whether drug use by community-dwelling\nelderly people differs with cognitive status. Specifically,\nwe examined the use and total number of prescription,\nand non-prescription medications, and the use of\nmedicines within therapeutic classes among cognitively\nimpaired and intact elderly people.\nMethods\nSample: The data used are from the in-home baseline survey\n(1986-87) of the Duke site of the Established Populations for\nEpidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE). Details on\nthe Duke EPESE study design and methodology are\npresented elsewhere [27]. Briefly, the Duke EPESE is a\nstratified probability household sample comprising 4162\nparticipants who are representative of the approximately\ncounties in the   One county\nis urban and four are predominantly rural; 35% of the area\npopulation are black, 64% white and 1% of other races. This\nstudy was approved by the Duke University Medical Center\nInstitutional Review Board and informed consent was\nobtained from each participant prior to data collection.\nData collection: Data were collected by trained interviewers\nwho used a comprehensive structured questionnaire during\nin-person interviews to obtain information on various aspects\nof the participants' physical, mental and social health and use\nof health services [27]. To minimize potential problems with\nunder-reporting, for participants too ill or unable to provide\nusable information, an appropriate proxy (i.e. the person most\nfamiliar with the participant) was asked to provide informa-\ntion. Participants were asked whether, during the previous 2\nweeks, they had taken any medicines prescribed by a doctor,\nor any others obtained from a store [3, 4], and if so, to show\nthe interviewer all these medications. The interviewer\nrecorded the drug name, dosage form, and the number of\ndosage forms the respondent reported taking the previous\nday. In addition, for prescription drugs, the interviewer\nrecorded from the label, the drug strength, whether the\nparticipant's name was on the label, and whether the medicine\nwas prescribed to be taken regularly or as needed.\nMedication data entry and management: All information was\nedited for accuracy and consistency before computer entry.\nPrescription drug data were coded using an updated and\nmodified version of the Drug Product Information Coding\nSystem [28], and for non-prescription drugs the Iowa\nNon-prescription Drug Product Information Coding\nSystem was used [5]. These data were entered using a locally\ndeveloped computerized program [3]. The unique numeric\ngeneric code assigned to each drug during data entry was\nmatched with a therapeutic category code. This therapeutic\ncategory code allowed drugs to be assigned to one of 15 major\ntherapeutic classes and 75 subclasses [3, 5], that are based\nupon an expanded version of the American Hospital\nFormulary Services format [29]. Reliability of the drug use\ndata entry system was assessed by re-entering a random 5%\nsample of participants, and was found to be highly satisfactory\nOutcome measures: We examined several dependent vari-\nables. We created a dichotomous variable (1 = yes, 0 = no) to\nindicate any use or no use of: (1) prescription medications, (2)\nnon-prescription medications, and (3) medicines within each\nof the major therapeutic classes and selected subclasses. We\nalso created quantitative variables to indicate the total number\nof prescription and non-prescription medications used.\nIndependent variables: The primary independent variable\nwas cognitive status as assessed by the ten-item, Short\nPortable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) with scoring\nadjusted for race and education [30]. Participants were\ndivided into two groups: cognitively impaired and cognitively\nintact, based on standard cut-off scores adjusted for education\nand race [30]. Specifically, for those with grade school\neducation, whites with four or more and blacks with five or\nmore errors were categorized as being cognitively impaired.\nWhites and blacks with any high school education are\npermitted one less error and those with more than high\nschool education are permitted two fewer errors.\nWe adjusted for important covariates that may influence\nthe relationship between cognitive status and drug use [1, 4, 7,\n14]. Demographic factors were represented by dichotomous\nvariables (1 = yes, 0 = no) for race, sex, and place of residence\n(i.e. whether living in an urban or rural area as defined by\nU.S. Bureau of the Census), and by quantitative variables for\nage and education in years. Health status factors were\nrepresented by quantitative variables that included a modified\n(three-item) version of the Rosow-Breslau scale [31], and a\nhealth index measure (higher score = poorer health) based on\nphysician-assessed medical impact of five self-reported\nchronic conditions (heart problems, hypertension, diabetes,\nstroke, and cancer) [4]. Access to health care was represented\nby dichotomous variables (1 = yes, 0 = no) for participants'\nMedicaid coverage status, hospitalization in the previous\nyear, and continuity of care (i.e. whether the same physician\nwas usually seen when going for care), and a quantitative\nvariable that measured the number of health care visits in the\n12 months prior to the interview.\nStatistical analysis: For purposes of analysis, all data were\nweighted to adjust for the sampling design and to allow\ninference to the five-county area. The analysis proceeded in\nthree phases. In the first phase, the data were summarized by\npercentages for all covariates and those who were cognitively\nimpaired were compared using the x statistic with those who\nwere cognitively intact [32].\nIn the second phase, bivariate analyses were conducted\nusing \\ and t tests to estimate the effects of cognitive status\non the dichotomous and quantitative drug usage measures\n[32]. Then, multivariate analyses, adjusting for covariates,\nwere conducted using logistic regression to estimate the\neffects of the independent variables on dichotomous drug\nusage measures, and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression\nfor the quantitative drug usage measures [33]. No covariates\nhad more than 4.2% missing data. For the multi\\ariate\nanalyses, missing values were replaced with regression-\npredicted imputed scores generated using the BMDP AM\nprocedure [34]. Final models were fitted to estimate the effect\nof cognitive status on medication usage controlling for all the\ndemographic variables and statistically important health\nstatus and access to health care variables. Final models were\nderived in stages. In the first stage, health status and access to\nhealth care variables were entered into regression models as a\ngroup of variables independent of each other. In the second\nstage, the significant (p < 0.05) health status and access to\nhealth care variables were retained and entered simul-\ntaneously into regression models that included cognitive\nstatus and the demographic variables. All of the above-\nmentioned analyses were conducted using SAS\u00ae software\nIn the final phase of analyses, because the Duke EPESE\ndata are based on a complex, stratified survey design, we\nretested the significance of our final multivariate regression\nmodels using SUDAAN, a specialized software program\ndeveloped for the analysis of complex sampling designs and\nwhich adjusts for the effects of clustering and stratification\n[36]. Significance tests reported for the multivariate models\nwere also adjusted to reflect the number of non-missing cases\nprior to imputation.\nResults\nTable I shows the descriptive characteristics of the\nparticipants by cognitive status.

Use of other analgesic subclasses was similar\n(p > 0.05) for both groups. The most commonly used\nCNS subclass was benzodiazepines and their use and\nthe use of miscellaneous CNS drugs was similar\n(p > 0.05) for the two groups. Those who were\ncognitively impaired were more likely (p < 0.05) to\ntake antidepressants, anti-emetics, anticonvulsants,\nneuroleptics, other sedative/hypnotics, and antiparkin-\nson drugs than those who were cognitively intact.\nThese CNS subclasses were further collapsed into\neither psychotropic (i.e. benzodiazepines, anti-\ndepressants, neuroleptics, sedative/hypnotics) or non-\npsychotropic CNS medications. Bivariate analyses\nrevealed that those who were cognitively impaired\nwere more likely than cognitively intact individuals to\ntake both psychotropic (22% vs. 16%, respectively;\nDiscussion\nThis is one of the first studies to describe drug use\npatterns among cognitively impaired community-\ndwelling elderly people. We found that after controlling\nfor potential confounders, cognitively impaired\nindividuals were less likely to be users of prescription\nor over-the-counter medications than those who were\ncognitively intact. The lower utilization of prescription\ndrugs is of potential concern since it may represent\nunderuse of medications, as those who were cognitively\nimpaired should have had at least as great a need given\ntheir greater chronic disease burden and poorer\nfunctional status. There are several possible explana-\ntions for this finding. It is possible that this group's\ngreater need was not adequately recognized by their\nphysicians. Alternatively, this group's greater need may\nhave been recognized by physicians, but appropriate\ntherapy was not initiated because doctors were influ-\nenced by the knowledge that the patient was cognitively\nimpaired. Standard medical practice should include,\nwhen feasible, treatment of health conditions that may\nimprove functional status and quality of life regardless\nof cognitive function. The importance of the lower\nutilization of non-prescription drugs by the cognitively\nimpaired is less clear. This finding may be related to\ntheir impaired cognitive and functional status and\ncorresponding inability to purchase these products.\nMoreover, care-givers may not recognize an impaired\nelderly person's need for help.\nWe found that those who were cognitively impaired\nwere less likely to take analgesic medications, specifi-\ncally NSAIDs, than those who were cognitively intact.\nThis agrees with the study by Kumar et al. for dementia\npatients and the findings by Wolf-Klein et al. in a study\nthat compared patients with normal and impaired\nmental status [11, 12]. There are several possible\ninterpretations of these findings. Participants with\ncognitive impairment may not be able to express pain\nsymptoms in an interpretable fashion [37]. Alterna-\ntively, the higher use of analgesics by those who were\ncognitively intact may represent a protective effect of\ncertain diseases or the medications used to treat them.\nFor example, a lower than expected prevalence of\nAlzheimer's disease has been reported in patients with\nrheumatoid arthritis [38]. Unfortunately, we did not\ncollect information from participants during the Duke\nEPESE first in-home interview about the presence or\nabsence of arthritis. Moreover, a recent report by\nBreitner et al. suggested that there is an inverse\nassociation between Alzheimer's disease and anti-\ninflammatory drugs (including NSAIDs) [39]. In\ncontrast, a large study of an ambulatory elderly\nsample from Florida found no association between\nNSAID use and cognitive decline [40].\nWe found that those who were cognitively impaired\nwere more likely to take CNS medications than those\nwho were cognitively intact. Overall, 32% of cognitively\nimpaired participants took one or more CNS medica-\ntions, with the most common type being benzodiaze-\npines. Although high, the prevalence of CNS\nmedication usage was less than the 37-50% rate\nreported by Semla et al. for 930 ambulatory patients\nwith different types of dementia who came to medical\nattention [13]. There are several plausible explanations\nfor our findings. The high use of CNS medications may\nreflect the appropriate use of psychotropics to treat\nbehavioural and psychiatric complications associated\nwith cognitive impairment due to dementia [21--23].\nHowever, the usage level of benzodiazepines may be of\nconcern given that comparative clinical trials have\ndemonstrated greater efficacy with neuroleptics, espe-\ncially for psychotic symptoms [21-23]. Alternatively,\nthe higher use of both CNS psychotropic and non-\npsychotropic medications may be causing or exacer-\nbating cognitive impairment [16-20]. In one notable\nstudy of 300 patients referred to a tertiary care clinic for\nevaluation of cognitive impairment, Larson et al. rated\n46 drug therapies as the aetiology for this condition\nin 35 patients, with the most common drug class\nimplicated being benzodiazepines [20].\nWe believe that these differences in drug use patterns\nare not likely to be due to under- or over-reporting by\nthose who were cognitively impaired for several\nreasons. First, special procedures were used to collect\nmedication data (i.e. interviewers actually seeing and\nrecording medications and use of proxy informants).\nSecond, among those who were cognitively impaired,\ndrug use patterns were similar (data not shown) for\nthose without and with proxy interviews. Finally, the\ntotal number of medications used was similar for both\ncognitive status groups and similar to that reported by\nprevious studies of elderly people in the community\nThere are several potential limitations to this study.\nIt was cross-sectional and causal interpretations are\nhampered by lack of knowledge of time-order relation-\nships. Other potential limitations include that lack of\nknowledge about the specific causes for participants'\ncognitive impairment and cognitive status were based\non a single evaluation with the SPMSQ. However, the\nSPMSQ has been shown to have substantial reliability\n[30] and good sensitivity and specificity in identifying\ncommunity dwelling subjects diagnosed as having\ndementia [41]. Fourth, medications were categorized\ninto broad therapeutic classes, which did not allow for\nexamination of individual medications for specific\nindications. Finally, this is a study of community\ndwelling elderly people living in the southeastern US\nand may not be representative of other populations\nwhere drug prescribing and non-prescription drug use\nhabits may be different.\nDespite these limitations, our findings suggest that\ncommunity dwelling elderly people who are cognitively\nimpaired are less likely than those who are cognitively\nintact to use prescription or non-prescription medica-\ntion. Further, the use of analgesics is less likely and\nCNS drugs more likely among those who are cogni-\ntively impaired. Future research is needed to examine\nlongitudinal drug-use patterns, and the use of specific\nmedication classes for specific diseases or conditions by\ncognitive status and associated causes, to clarify these\nfindings.\n"
