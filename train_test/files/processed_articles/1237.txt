The out-\ncome measure is the percentage of deaths in the full sample in excess\nof those predicted for the reference category.\nResults: For the level equivalent to BMI ,18.5, estimates of excess\ndeaths ranged from 0.3% for waist-hip ratio to 2.4% for percentage\nbody fat. All except waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and waist-\nstature ratio were significantly greater than zero (P , 0.05). For the\nlevel equivalent to BMI 25 to ,30, the percentage of excess deaths\nwas 0.1% for percentage body fat and negative for all other variables;\nestimates were significantly below zero only for circumferences and\nwaist-stature ratio. For the level equivalent to BMI 30, estimates\nranged from 21.7% for waist circumference to 1.5% for percentage\nof fat; none were significantly different from zero. Estimates for all-\ncause mortality, obesity-related causes of death, and other causes of\ndeath showed no statistically significant or systematic differences\nbetween BMI and other variables.\nConclusion: In this population-based study, attributable frac-\ntions of deaths were similar across measures.

Because weight and height are\nrelatively easy to measure and because BMI is relatively highly\ncorrelated with body fat, BMI is often used in epidemiologic\nstudies to assess adiposity. However, it is an imperfect measure\nbecause it does not assess body fatness directly (1). Another\nanthropometric indicator sometimes suggested to be used in-\nstead of BMI is waist circumference, which may be more\nclosely related to adiposity, particularly visceral adiposity, than\nis BMI and thus may be a better indicator of the risk associated\nwith adiposity (2). Another approach to measuring adiposity is\nthe use of skinfold thicknesses (2, 3). Bioelectrical impedance\ncan also provide estimates of body fatness (4). Combinations of\ndifferent variables such as the ratio of waist circumference to hip\ncircumference can also be used (5).\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nsurements of body size and composition in a representative\nsampleoftheUSpopulation,includingBMI,percentageoffatfrom\nbioelectrical impedance, skinfold thicknesses, and circumference\nmeasurements of waist, hip, and arm. Mortality follow-up data\nmake it possible to assess the extent to which various anthropo-\nmetric measures can predict mortality risk. These data have been\nused to estimate the excess deaths associated with different BMI\nThe objective of this study was to compare estimates of excess\ndeaths associated with BMI categories with estimates of excess\ndeaths associated with other possible indicators of body size or\ncomposition in a large nationally representative study.\nCenter for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention. A nationally representative cross-sectional sample of\nthe US civilian noninstitutionalized population was selected using\na complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling de-\nsign. A description of the plan and operation of the survey has been\npublished (8). NHANES III underwent institutional review board\napproval and included written informed consent.\nWaist circumference, hip circumference, arm circumference,\nskinfold-thicknessmeasurements,bioelectricalimpedance,weight,\nand height were measured using standardized techniques and\nequipment (8). Waist circumference measurements were made just\n1 From the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD (KMF), and the Division of Cancer\nEpidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD (BIG).\n2 The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and\nnot necessarily those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and\nthe National Cancer Institute.\n3 Reprints not available.

Hip circumference measurements were made\nat the largest protuberance of the buttocks. Arm circumference was\nmeasured at the midpoint of the arm and BMI was calculated.\nPercentage body fat was calculated from resistance and reactance\nmeasurements using previously published formulas (9, 10). Waist-\nhip ratio (WHR) was calculated as waist circumference (cm)/hip\ncircumference(m).Skinfold-thicknessmeasurementsweremadeat\n4 sites (triceps, subscapula, suprailium, and thigh) and summed\ntogether. For the purposes of this study, skinfold values that were\nabove the maximum of 55 mm that could be measured with the\ncalipers used were arbitrarily assigned a higher value of 60 mm.\nWaist-stature ratio (WSR) was calculated as waist circumference\n(cm)/height (m).\nFor mortality data we used the NHANES III Linked Mortality\nFile from the National Center for Health Statistics (11). The\nNational Center for Health Statistics has conducted a mortality\nlinkage of NHANES III to death certificate data found in the\nNational Death Index. The NHANES III Linked Mortality File\nprovides mortality follow-up data from the date of NHANES III\nLinkage of the NHANES III survey participants with the National\nDeath Index provides the opportunity to conduct studies designed\nto investigate the association of a wide variety of health factors\nwith mortality.\nTo estimate relativerisks, we used baseline data fromNHANES\nMortalityFilethrough2000.Baselineagewasageatthetimeofthe\nexamination. We calculated relative risks of mortality using Cox\nproportional hazard models with age as the time scale (12). We fit\nmodels separately in 4 age\u00adsex strata for men and women aged\nanthropometric variable (low, reference, intermediate, or high),\nsmoking status (never, former, or current), race (white, black, or\nother), and alcohol consumption categories in ounces per day\nThe sample of respondents aged 25 y examined in the mobile\nnonpregnant women with complete BMI data and mortality\nvalues for waist circumference and an additional 364 men and\n523 women had missing values for resistance from the bio-\nelectrical impedance measures. The final analytic sample in-\ncluded 12,919 men and nonpregnant women who had complete\ndata for BMI and other anthropometric variables. However, for\nstatistical pairwise comparisons of variables, all available data for\nthe 2 variables being compared were used.\nCategorical estimates\nFor categorical analyses, we grouped BMI as follows: ,18.5\nweight),and 30 (obesity). These followed federal guidelines (13).\nWhen comparing the results from levels of BMI values with\nlevels of other anthropometric variables, differences might be\nintroduced simply because the categories reflect different points\nin the distribution. To control for this effect, researchers not\ninfrequently divide all variables into quintiles or other compa-\nrable categories of equal size for all variables (14\u00ad23). We\nfollowed a similar procedure, except that, instead of quintiles,\nwe used the standard BMI cutoffs to form categories and then\ncreated levels for the other anthropometric variables that were\nprevalence matched to the standard BMI cutoffs. In other words,\nthese categories were created by using cutoffs that would iden-\ntify the same proportion of the population as did the standard\nBMI cutoffs. For purposes of analysis, these levels are termed\nlow (corresponding to BMI ,18.5), reference (corresponding to\nand high (corresponding to BMI 30).\nEstimation of excess deaths\nWe calculated the number of excess deaths associated with dif-\nferentlevelsofeachanthropometricvariableindividually(including\nBMI itself) by using similar methods to those described previously\n(6, 24). Because many indicators, such as percentage body fat or\nwaist circumference, display marked differences by sex, we al-\nlowed relative risks to vary by sex and age. We calculated excess\ndeathswithineachsex\u00adagegroupand summedthemoverthewhole\nsample. This approach has the advantage of providing a metric that\ncan be summed over age and sex groups to obtain a sample total\nwhile still allowing for variation in relative risks by sex and age. It\nuses sex- and age-specific information on the prevalence of the\ngiven anthropometric level and mortality, combined with relative\nrisk information, to estimate the sample burden of mortality asso-\nciated with the given anthropometric level, which cannot be as-\nsessed from relative risk estimates alone. For these analyses, unlike\nour previous work (6, 7) we did not extrapolate the results to na-\ntional mortality data. The estimates presented here are for the\n(weighted) NHANES III sample. In part because of the high cor-\nrelations among anthropometric variables, this methodology is\nnot suited to making excess death calculations for 2 variables\nsimultaneously.\nWe express the excess deaths as a percentage of total sample\ndeaths. Although this methodology is a form of attributable frac-\ntion methodology, this is a measure of association and does not\nnecessarily indicate a causal relation. Within each level of a given\nanthropometric variable, we divided the number of excess deaths\nby the total number of deaths in the sample to create an estimate of\npopulation attributable fraction for each anthropometric level. For\na given anthropometric level, this can be interpreted as the per-\ncentage of total deaths in the sample that are in excess of (or fewer\nthan) those that would be predicted if people in that anthropometric\nlevel instead had been in the reference level for that variable, with\ntheothercovariatesofagegroup,sex,raceorethnicgroup,smoking,\nand alcohol consumption all held constant.\nAll analyses were conducted using the SAS System for\nWindows (release 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Research\nTriangle Institute's SUDAAN (release 9.0; Research Triangle In-\nstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) software programs. All\nanalyses included sample weights that account for the varying\nprobabilities of selection due to sampling and nonresponse.\nStandard errors were calculated by applying a delta method for\ncomplex sample designs that takes into account uncertainties in\nthe relative risks for the levels of an anthropometric variable, the\ndistribution of the anthropometric variable in the sample, the\ndistribution of covariates, and the estimated effects of covariates,\nas well as the added variability due to the complex sample design\nof the NHANES surveys (24, 25). Statistical testing of the dif-\nference between excess deaths associated with levels of one an-\nthropometric variable and excess deaths associated with the\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ncorresponding levels of another anthropometric variable were de-\ntermined by t tests in which the denominator of the test statistic was\nthe SE of the difference obtained from the delta method. These t\ntests used 49 df, which is equal to the number of primary sample\nunits minus the number of sample strata. To partially account for\nmultiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at the P ,\nof the anthropometric variables without additionally adjusting for\nthe 4 levels, which would have led to a smaller P value.\nRESULTS\nBasic descriptive information about the sample is shown in\nTable 1. Correlation coefficients for the different variables with\neach other and with height are shown in Table 2. Most of the\nvariables were highly correlated with each other.\nCutoffs for categorization of anthropometric variables\nThe percentile values for waist circumference and other vari-\nables that correspond, in the sense of identifying the same pro-\nportion of the distribution, to the specified BMI cutoffs are shown\nin Table 3. Because of rounding, the values are not always exactly\nthe identical percentile, but they are close. For example, for\nwomen, a percentage fat value of ,16.0% or a waist circum-\nference value of ,67.1 cm produces prevalence estimates similar\nAlthough the prevalence is the same, an individual might fall\ninto one BMI category and not into the matched category of the\nother variable. For example, of men in the BMI category of 18.5\u00ad\n,25, 69% fell into the corresponding percentage fat category of\nfell into a higher percentage fat category. The overall proportion\nof people who fall into the corresponding categories of each pair\nof the other anthropometric variables is shown in Table 4. In\nmost cases, from 50% to 75% of people were classified similarly\nacross variables. However, for WHR the percentage of agree-\nment tended to be lower.\nExcess deaths\nAttributable fractions for excess deaths were calculated for\nlevels of BMI and for the corresponding levels of other variables\nDescriptive information about the analytic sample\nMen Women\n1 Mortality data are from the Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey Linked Mortality File (11).\n2 SE in parentheses (all such values).\n3 Mean value for women is significantly different from mean value for\nmen (P , 0.001) on the basis of a 2-sample t test for complex sample survey\nCorrelations between measurements by sex1\nBMI\nPercentage\nof fat\nWaist\ncircumference\nHip\ncircumference\nArm\ncircumference WHR\nSum of\nskinfolds WSR Height\nMen\nWomen\n1 WHR, waist-hip ratio; WSR, waist-stature ratio.\n2 Significantly different from zero.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nformed from the cutoffs shown in Table 3.

It is sometimes\nsuggested that weak or negative associations between BMI and\nmortality are due to the lack of the ability of BMI to discriminate\nbetween lean and fat mass and that associations would be\nstrengthened if different measures were used (29). In NHANES\nIII, associations between mortality and elevated BMI were weak,\nthe high (obese) range. However, the associations of the corre-\nsponding levels of other anthropometric variables--including\nwaist, hip, and arm circumferences; percentage body fat estimated\nfrom bioelectrical impedance; WHR; the sum of 4 skinfold\nthicknesses, and the WSR--also tended to be weak and in general\nwere quite similar to the association of BMI with mortality. When\nthe mortality outcome was limited to selected causes of death\npreviously shown (7) to be associated with obesity (cardiovascular\nFIGURE 1. Estimated attributable fractions and 95% CIs for all-cause\nmortality for different anthropometric and body composition variables. 1, BMI;\n2, percentage of fat; 3, waist circumference; 4, hip circumference; 5, arm\ncircumference; 6, waist-hip ratio; 7, sum of skinfolds; and 8, waist-stature ratio.\nFIGURE 2. Estimated attributable fractions and 95% CIs for mortality\nfrom cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or obesity-related cancers for different\nanthropometric and body composition variables. 1, BMI; 2, percentage of\nfat; 3, waist circumference; 4, hip circumference; 5, arm circumference;\n6, waist-hip ratio; 7, sum of skinfolds; and 8, waist-stature ratio.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ndisease, diabetes, kidney disease, and selected cancers), the as-\nsociation of mortality and BMI in the obese range was stronger,\nsociated with BMI at the high (obese) level. At this level for\nthese causes of death, BMI was associated with a higher per-\ncentage of deaths than were the other anthropometric variables\nconsidered. These findings do not suggest that the weak adi-\nposity-mortality associations would be stronger if measures of\nadiposity other than BMI were used.\nWhen the mortality outcome was limited to other causes of\ndeath (ie, excluding deaths due to cardiovascular disease, di-\nabetes, kidney disease, and selected cancers), the associations of\nBMI with mortality at the intermediate (overweight) or high\n(obese) level were much weaker and generally negative, although\nnot significantly so.\nEach of these measures of body size or composition has its\nlimitations. All are highly correlated with each other, which\nsuggests that they are inevitably collinear. As body size, assessed\nby BMI, increases, percentage of fat tends to increase, body cir-\ncumferences increase, and skinfold thicknesses increase. In all\n3 sets of analyses, all variables had generally similar patterns of\nexcess deaths. No one variable consistently gave higher or lower\nresults than the others. Pairwise comparisons showed no significant\ndifferences between variables for the estimates at any level. These\nfindings make it appear unlikely that in these population studies the\nuse of BMI produces appreciably lower or higher estimates of\nexcess mortality than would other measures of adiposity or body\nsize. However, in the NHANES III data, all associations were\nweak. It is possible that in a sample with stronger associations\nbetween body composition and mortality there would be clearer\ndifferences between these anthropometric variables.\nThe reasons for associations between BMI and mortality are\nimperfectly understood. It is often assumed that any associations\nare due to the accumulation of adipose tissue, whether overall\nadiposity or site-specific adiposity. However, the actual mech-\nanism or mechanisms are not clear. Part of the association may be\nrelated to incidence and part to survival, and the body size or\ncomposition factors related to incidence may differ from those\nthat affect survival outcomes. In addition, the body size and\ncomposition factors that affect the incidence of, or survival under,\ncertain conditions may differ across conditions. Given the likely\ncomplexity of these associations, it may not be surprising to find\nthat results vary across studies conducted in different populations\nat different times or with different outcomes.\nResults in the literature generally compare relative risks rather\nthan absolute risks and are somewhat mixed. In a large case-\ncontrol study of survivors of myocardial infarctions, Yusuf et al\n(22) found that WHR was a better predictor of the risk of\nmyocardial infarctions than were either BMI or waist circum-\nference. In contrast, in a meta-analysis of data on incident di-\nabetes, Vazquez et al (30) found that results for waist\ncircumference, BMI, and WHR were all similar. In our analyses\nof the NHANES III data, use of the WHR did not result in any\nsystematic differences from BMI or other individual variables.\nWHR has been found in several studies to be a good predictor of\nmortality or of incident cardiovascular disease. However, its\ninterpretation is somewhat uncertain. Both waist and hip cir-\ncumferences are highly correlated with BMI or percentage body\nfat individually, but their ratio is less correlated. Some evidence\nsuggests that the waist and hip have opposite effects on risk (31).\nIn addition, visceral adiposity may be strongly related to risk,\nand measures such as BMI, waist circumference, or WHR\nmay be better measures of total body fat than of visceral adi-\nRelative risks compare the risks at lower and higher levels of\na variable, but do not provide estimates of the overall contribution\nof these levels to mortality. For example, it is possible that the\nhighest 10% of any variable identifies a group with similarly\nelevated absolute risks but that the relative risks are higher for one\nvariable than for another because of differences in the absolute\nrisk in the reference category. The estimates presented here use\nrelative risk estimates as part of the calculations but also take into\naccount other factors to provide an estimate of the sample burden\nof mortality, which cannot be assessed from relative risks alone.\nThese results suggest that, in terms of the associations with excess\ndeaths, a variety of measurements give similar results to those\nfound for BMI.\nWe thank David Williamson, Emory University, and Mitchell Gail, Na-\ntional Cancer Institute, for their helpful comments.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--KMF and BIG: participated\nin developing and drafting the manuscript, conducting statistical analyses, and\nreviewing the manuscript for scientific content.
