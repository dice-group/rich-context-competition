    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of the present article is to propose an alternative short form for the 199-item Arizona Life History Battery\n(ALHB), which we are calling the K-SF-42, as it contains 42 items as compared with the 20 items of the Mini-K, the short\nform that has been in greatest use for the past decade. These 42 items were selected from the ALHB, unlike those of the\nMini-K, making direct comparisons of the relative psychometric performance of the two alternative short forms a valid and\ninstructive exercise. A series of secondary data analyses were performed upon a recently completed five-nation cross-\ncultural survey, which was originally designed to assess the role of life history strategy in the etiology of interpersonal\naggression. Only data from the ALHB that were collected in all five cross-cultural replications were used for the present\nanalyses. The single immediate objective of this secondary data analysis was producing the K-SF-42 such that it would\nperform optimally across all five cultures sampled, and perhaps even generalize well to other modern industrial societies\nnot currently sampled as a result of the geographic breadth of those included in the present study. A novel method, based\non the use of the Cross-Sample Geometric Mean as a criterion for item selection, was used for generating such a cross-\nculturally valid short form.\n",

Bioenergetic and material\nresources need to be mobilized to achieve the functional objec-\ntives of survival and reproduction. These resource mobiliza-\ntions power the expression of the biological and behavioral\nadaptations that are the individual tactical elements deployed\nby the governing LH strategies.\nThe rationale that undergirds the psychometric approach to\nthe assessment of LH strategies is to tap into the dynamics of\nthese proximal resource allocations, rather than monitoring the\nattainment of the distal achievements to which they are\ndirected. This is based upon the evolutionary psychological\nconception of organisms as adaptation executers rather than\nas fitness maximizers, where the resource allocations are the\nadaptations being executed and the distal achievements are the\nspecific components of fitness being maximized. In contrast,\nthe biodemographic approach directly samples the distal\nachievements eventually produced by these resource alloca-\ntions, such as age of puberty, age of first sexual contact, num-\nber of sexual partners, age of first birth, interbirth interval,\nnumber of offspring at completed fertility, and so on.\nAlthough the biodemographic approach has also proven\nuseful in the study of LH strategies, it suffers from various\nlimitations, as all single methods ultimately do. Among them\nis the well-known fallibility of the relation between motiva-\ntion and performance in psychology. According to one for-\nmulation of this problem (Mitchell, 1982), performance can\nbe modeled as the multiplicative product (or statistical inter-\naction) of the individual's motivation, the individual's ability,\nand the individual's environment. This model states explicitly\nthat, aside from the individual's motivation, the individual\nrequires the physical and mental ability to perform the task\nas well as an environment that affords the requisite resources\nfor the goal's attainment.\nApplying this specifically to LH strategies, a human adoles-\ncent male's age of first sexual contact and number of sexual\npartners are not uniquely determined by his motivational state,\nwhich in most cases we can safely presume to be quite high. It\nis also codetermined by a number of intrinsic individual char-\nacteristics, such as his sexual attractiveness, social skills, and\nsocial status, and additionally by a number of extrinsic ecolo-\ngical characteristics, such as the availability of willing female\nsexual partners, the degree of direct access to such willing\nfemale sexual partners afforded by the environment, and the\nsocially imposed restrictions (or lack thereof) governing ado-\nlescent sexual activity. A human adolescent male's age of first\nsexual contact and number of sexual partners are thus not very\npure measures of his either slower of faster LH strategy, which\nis a highly heritable trait and thus not very contingent upon\nsuch transient ambient circumstances (h2 * .65; Figueredo &\nRushton, 2009; Figueredo, V\u00e1squez, Brumbach, & Schneider,\n2004). Similarly, a human female's age of first birth, interbirth\nintervals, and number of offspring at completed fertility is\ncodetermined by a number of individual difference factors,\nsuch as her physical condition and a number of ecological and\nsociocultural factors, such as environmental resource abun-\ndance and any socially imposed regulation of either the timing\nor the relational context of reproductive activity. At the present\ntime, we believe that there is insufficient empirical evidence\nreported in the published literature to determine whether there\nmight or might not be any sex differences in the heritability of\nLH strategy.\nThis is not to say that the psychometric approach is some-\nhow more valid than the biodemographic approach or vice\nversa. The idea is that they are complementary, as they each\nprovide windows into different successive stages of the same\ncausal processes (Garcia et al., 2016). The psychometric\napproach is based on sampling behavioral and cognitive indi-\ncators of the LH resource allocations among different compo-\nnent domains of fitness. For example, the Arizona Life History\nBattery (ALHB) contains seven subscales (not including the\nMini-K, which is designed as domain general) that sample the\nfollowing domain-specific psychosocial resource allocations:\n(1) Insight, Planning, and Control; (2) Mother/Father Rela-\ntionship Quality; (3) Family Social Contact and Support;\n(4) Friends Social Contact and Support; (5) Romantic Partner\nAttachment; (6) General Altruism; and (7) Religiosity. This\nsampling of resource allocation domains is not represented as\ncompletely exhaustive. However, we believe that it provides\nreasonably adequate coverage of the major areas of psychoso-\ncial resource investment that LH theory would predict as char-\nacterizing a slower LH strategy; faster LH strategists are thus\npredicted to score lower on the latent common factor that can\nbe extracted from these seven more domain-specific subscales.\nThe Mini-K and the K-SF-42\nSince it was first published 10 years ago (Figueredo et al.,\n2006), the Mini-K has been a highly successful 20-item short\nform for the psychometric measurement of LH strategy. It has\nfared very well in meta-analyses (e.g., Figueredo et al., 2014),\nwith a mean bivariate correlation of \nr \u00bc :75 and a disattenuated\nsynthetic correlation of  = .91 with its corresponding long\nform, the 199-item ALHB. Such meta-analytic work, however,\nhas been limited to English-speaking North American under-\ngraduate student populations. The concern is that the Mini-K\nhas actually been applied to a much wider variety of popula-\ntions cross-culturally including such geographically diverse\nplaces such as Chile, Costa Rica, Israel, Mexico, Poland, Sin-\ngapore, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (e.\nKlavina, Figueredo, & Dijkstra, 2009; Cabeza de Baca, Figuer-\nedo, & Ellis, 2012; Cabeza de Baca, Sotomayor-Peterson,\nedo, Andrzejczak, Jones, Smith-Castro, & Montero-Rojas,\nValdez-Ramirez, Nava-Cruz, Figueredo, & Corral-Verdugo,\n& Czarna, 2011; Sotomayor-Peterson, Cabeza de Baca, Figuer-\nedo, & Smith-Castro, 2013; Sotomayor-Peterson, Figueredo,\nHendrickson-Christensen, & Taylor, 2012; Tal, Hill, Figueredo,\nFr\u00edas-Armenta, & Corral-Verdugo, 2006; Tifferet, Agrest, &\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nShlomo Benisti, 2011; van der Linden, Figueredo, de Leeuw,\nScholte, & Engels, 2012; Woodley of Menie & Madison,\nAn acknowledged disadvantage of the Mini-K is its limited\nreliability (\n \u00bc :75 in the cited meta-analysis), which is due the\nfact that it is a short form for an entire multivariate latent\nvariable (the K-Factor), comprising several component sub-\nscales, rather than a single uniform scale. The latter fact inevi-\ntably leads to some irreducible degree of heterogeneity among\nthe items, as they were designed to reflect conceptually distinct\nbut convergent indicators of the multivariate latent construct.\nA measure of internal consistency among items, such as\nCronbach's , will therefore return an appropriately low esti-\nmate. Also worth noting is that the test\u00adretest reliability of the\nMini-K is similarly low, which can only be attributed to the\nrelatively low number of items.\nThe 20 items on the Mini-K are not a subset of the 199\nitems on the ALHB but are instead unique items written to\nassess its content areas more globally. For example, 2 items\n(\"While growing up, I had a close and warm relationship with\nmy biological mother\" and \"While growing up, I had a close\nand warm relationship with my biological father\") were written\nto summarize the substantive content of the 26-item Mother/\nFather Relationship Quality subscale (adapted from Brim et al.,\n2007) of the ALHB. This strategy was deemed optimal for\nproducing a 20-item short form in comparison with selecting\nthe \"best\" items from the subscale, as even the 2 best-\nperforming individual items (by whatever criterion) were\nunlikely to cover the entire substantive content of the subscale\nand reflect the full breadth of the construct. The Mini-K was\noriginally developed for use in situations wherein time con-\nstraints made use of the full ALHB prohibitive. It was never\nrecommended for situations where the psychometric assess-\nment of LH strategy was intended as a cornerstone of the\nresearch; in such cases, the full ALHB was to be preferred and\nwas presumed to be worth the cost in added response burden.\nAdditionally, the recent completion of a large cross-cultural\nsurvey using the ALHB (Figueredo et al., 2016) presents an\nopportunity to create a short form that can also stand up to tests\nof cross-cultural validity. We illustrate a novel method for gen-\nerating such a cross-culturally valid short form.\nDescription of the Present Study\nThese characteristics of the Mini-K offer an opportunity, after a\ndecade of productive use, to propose a somewhat longer short\nform that might retain some of its advantages, avoid its major\ndisadvantages, and allow for more flexibility in research appli-\ncation. The purpose of the present article is to propose such an\nalternative short form for the ALHB, which we are calling the\nK-SF-42, as it contains 42 items (see Appendix for a complete\nlisting). These 42 items are directly selected from the ALHB,\nunlike the 20 items of the Mini-K, making direct comparisons\nof the relative psychometric performance of the two alternative\nshort forms a potentially valid and instructive exercise.\nThe purpose of this article is not, however, to present a\nreview of the construct validity of the ALHB itself, as we have\nalready published a rather extensive meta-analysis on both the\npredictive (\"nomological\") and convergent validity of the Mini-\nK and the ALHB (Figueredo et al., 2014). We have also pub-\nlished a more complete treatment of the construct validity of\nthe hierarchical latent structure of the Mini-K, the ALHB, and\nrelated measures using multiple data sets and applying confir-\nmatory factor analyses as well as other methods (Olderbak,\nGladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014). Furthermore, we have also\nexpounded eloquently elsewhere upon the epistemological and\nmethodological rationales underlying the psychometric\napproach to assessing LH strategy (Figueredo, Cabeza de Baca,\nTo maintain the breadth of the construct at each level of\naggregation, 6 items were selected from each of the seven\nsubscales of the ALHB (not including the Mini-K), represent-\ning several domains of potential allocation of bioenergetic and\nmaterial resources in a manner consistent with the execution of\na slow LH strategy. Where appropriate, these 6 items were\nbalanced across the multiple subdomains sampled by each sub-\nscale. As novel item selection procedures were applied to\nobtain items and subscales that functioned at the highest levels\nof cross-cultural generality, we followed up with item response\ntheory (IRT) Rasch modeling (Bond & Fox, 2001) of both\nindividual items and aggregated subscales to ascertain whether\nour procedures performed as intended. We also performed a\ngeneralizability theory (GT) analysis (Figueredo & Olderbak,\n2008) on the IRT-generated subscale difficulty estimates to test\nfor the degree of cross-cultural invariance that our procedures\nmanaged to achieve.\nThis series of secondary data analyses were performed upon\na recently completed five-nation cross-cultural survey, which\nwas originally designed to assess the role of LH strategy in the\netiology of interpersonal aggression (Figueredo et al., 2016).\nOnly data from the ALHB, collected in all five cross-cultural\nreplications, were used for the present analyses. The single\nimmediate objective was producing the K-SF-42, such that it\nwould perform optimally across all five cultures sampled, and\nperhaps even generalize well to other cultures not currently\nsampled as a result of the geographic breadth of those included\nin the present study.\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedures\nA total of 738 undergraduate students participated in the study,\nenrolled in introductory psychology courses in five different\nmajor universities located in Australia (AU; N = 131), Italy (IT;\nand the United States (US; N = 160). In the original study from\nwhich these data are derived (Figueredo et al., 2016), partici-\npants completed a series of computerized self-report question-\nnaires assessing the following constructs: LH strategies;\nexecutive functioning; mating strategies; mate values; mating\nFigueredo et al. 3\neffort; revenge ideologies; psychopathic and aggressive atti-\ntudes; and their coercive, aggressive, and possibly violent beha-\nvioral interactions over the past year with any and all members\nof their same sex and with any and all members of the opposite\nsex (whether or not they were intimate romantic partners) with\nwhich they might have interacted. Participants signed up for the\nstudy, provided informed consent, and completed the question-\nnaires through a secured Internet website.\nMeasures\nThe ALHB. The ALHB (Figueredo et al., 2007) is a set of cog-\nnitive and behavioral indicators of LH strategy compiled and\nadapted from various original sources. These self-report psycho-\nmetric indicators measure graded individual differences along\nvarious complementary facets of a coherent and coordinated\nLH strategy, as specified by LH theory, and converge upon a\nsingle multivariate latent construct. These were scored and\naggregated directionally to indicate a slow (high-K) LH strategy,\non the fast\u00adslow (r\u00adK) continuum. Not including the Mini-K,\nthe seven subscales of the ALHB are as follows: Insight, Plan-\nning, and Control (20 items; adapted from Brim et al., 2000;\nity (26 items; adapted from Brim et al., 2000; Figueredo et al.,\nadapted from Barrera, Sandler, & Ramsay, 1981; Figueredo\net al., 2001); Friends Social Contact and Support (15 items;\nExperiences in Close Relationships (ECR: 36 items; adapted\nfrom Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998; Alonso-Arbiol, Bal-\nism (50 items; adapted from Brim et al., 2000; Figueredo et al.,\nreliabilities of the ALHB subscales are a major subject of the\npresent analyses, presentation of these psychometric properties\nwill be deferred to the Results section.\nThe Mini-K. The Mini-K (Figueredo et al., 2006) is a 20-item\nshort form of the ALHB. Meta-analytically (e.g., Figueredo\net al., 2014), the Mini-K has shown a high mean bivariate\ncorrelation (\nr \u00bc :75 ) and a higher disattenuated synthetic cor-\nrelation of ( = .91) with its corresponding 199-item long form.\nThe items on the Mini-K are not directly sampled from the\nseven other subscales comprising the ALHB, but are instead\ndesigned to provide more global assessments within each of the\nLH domain-specific resource allocations sampled by the\nALHB. As with the ALHB, the Mini-K is scored directionally\nto indicate a slow (highly K-selected) LH strategy on the \"fast\u00ad\nslow\" (r\u00adK) continuum.\nStatistical Analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using MS Excel 2003\nCertain theoretically motivated decisions were made at the\nbeginning of this process regarding items that would not be the\ncandidates for inclusion in the new short form, the K-SF-42.\nOne such decision was to eliminate from consideration the set\nof items in the General Altruism scale sampling Altruism\nToward Children, as it tended to produce an overabundance\nof missing data in younger samples of participants, and was\nnot deemed theoretically essential to the construct being\nmeasured.\nThe cross-sample geometric mean (CSGM) method for optimal\nitem selection. To maintain the breadth of the construct at each\nlevel of aggregation, 6 items were selected from each of the\nseven subscales of the ALHB (not including the Mini-K), rep-\nresenting several domains of potential allocation of bioener-\ngetic and material resources in a manner consistent with the\nexecution of a slow LH strategy. Where appropriate, these 6\nitems were balanced across the multiple subdomains sampled\nby each subscale. For the Mother/Father Relationship Quality\nsubscale, the 6 items were selected by sampling the best 3\nitems from each of the parental (Mother and Father) subdo-\nmains. Similarly, for the General Altruism scale, the 6 items\nwere selected by sampling the best 2 items from each of the\nfollowing three subdomains: Altruism Toward Kin, Altruism\nToward Friends, and Altruism Toward Community.\nThe way that we operationalized which items were \"the\nbest\" defined the novelty of this approach and has the beauty\nof its great simplicity. We first calculated the part-whole corre-\nlation of each item score with the unit-weighted (UW) factor\nscore for the subscale in which it was nested, conceptually\nrepresenting the UW factor loadings of each item. We did this\nseparately for each of the five cross-cultural replications and\npasted these as columns on a single MS Excel spreadsheet. We\nused the spreadsheet to compute the geometric mean of these\npart-whole correlations across all five cross-cultural replica-\ntions. Next, we selected the 6 items with the highest geometric\nmeans from each subscale (within the subdomain constraints\noutlined above) for inclusion in the K-SF-42, by simply using\nthe spreadsheet to sort the data by the columns containing the\nsubscales and the geometric means in descending order.\nThe rationale for using the geometric rather than arithmetic\nmean is that it involves the multiplication rather than the addi-\ntion of the parameter estimates for each of the five cross-\ncultural replications. In the case of the arithmetic mean, the\nsum is divided by n; in the case of the geometric mean, the\nnth root of the product is instead calculated. Multiplication is\nequivalent in Boolean algebra to a logical \"AND\" statement or\nlogical conjunction; whereas addition is equivalent in Boolean\nalgebra to a logical \"OR\" statement or logical disjunction. A\nhigh product term is thus only produced when the values in all\nthe coefficients being multiplied are high; a high additive term,\non the other hand, can still be obtained if one or more of the\ncoefficients being summed are sufficiently high to compensate\nfor any that might be lower. Thus, a higher geometric mean is a\nstronger filter than a high arithmetic mean for selecting items\nthat perform sufficiently well across all (rather than mere some)\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nof the multiple cultures sampled. We have therefore named this\nthe CSGM method for optimal item selection, having been first\npioneered in a previous study but gone without any special\ndesignation (Patch, Garcia, Figueredo, & Kavanagh, 2016).\nIn contrast, other short form construction methods that rely\non empirical selection of variables will often experience prob-\nlems of replication when applied to independent samples, espe-\ncially cross-cultural ones. Part of this problem arises from\nmodel fitting to sample-specific characteristics that are not\npresent in other samples. For example, empirical selection\nmethods may capitalize on chance differences (stochastic fluc-\ntuations) among item characteristics that are purely due to\nsampling error; as a result which items are truly the best may\nnot replicate between one independent and another even if they\nare drawn from the same population, being analogous to sta-\ntistical \"Type I Errors.\" Furthermore, empirically based selec-\ntion of locally optimal items can lead to disastrous results when\napplied outside of the population upon which the new scale\nwas originally developed. Although this latter circumstance is\nobviously less of a problem the more alike the samples are to\neach other, between-sample differences on relevant character-\nistics can be quite large in the case of cross-cultural research.\nAfter implementing the CSGM procedures, we had to assess\nwhether this seemingly clever tactic actually worked in practice\nby performing each of the following psychometric assessment\nprocedures: (1) We compared the internal consistency reliabil-\nities of the short form with the long form for each of the seven\nsubscales of the ALHB, (2) we compared the part-whole cor-\nrelations (UW factor structures) of the short form with the long\nform for each of the seven subscales of the ALHB, (3) we\nexamined the simple bivariate correlations of the short form\nwith the long form for each of the seven subscales of the\nALHB, (4) we examined the relative internal consistency\nreliabilities of the two alternative short forms (Mini-K and\nK-SF-42) of the ALHB, each as a unitary scale irrespective\nof internal structure, as well as the correlations of those\nUW scale scores with the UW factor score of the full ALHB,\nand (5) we examined the relative incremental validities of the\ntwo alternative short forms (Mini-K and K-SF-42) of the\nALHB in multiple regression models predicting the UW factor\nscore of the full ALHB.\nIRT Rasch modeling of item and subscale difficulties. To validate\nthe results obtained by means of this novel method by more\nconventional means, we ran a one parameter Rasch model to\nobtain IRT parameter estimates on the K-SF-42 items and sub-\nscales. The IRT parameter of primary interest was the so-called\nitem difficulty, which indicates how high a factor score on the\nunderlying latent variable () is required to produce a \"correct\"\nresponse on any given item (Bond & Fox, 2015). The latent\nvariable of interest is typically cognitive ability (g), but in the\npresent case it is simply LH speed (K). The IRT method chosen\nwas the single parameter Rasch model and analyzed with WIN-\nSTEPS. First, countries were combined within subscales, and\neach subscale was analyzed with countries as items. This was\ndone as a way to see whether countries differed in their relative\nrank within each subscale, a rough indication of differential\nitem functioning of countries within subscales. Second, sub-\nscale totals were computed and then designated as items in an\noverall total scale score, also in a Rasch analysis. This allowed\nfor subscales to be ranked in terms of \"difficulty\" in terms of\ntheir ease of endorsement in their overall LH strategy. The\neasiest subscales would be those with the highest priority of\nendorsement--a strategy most commonly shared in the popu-\nlation. After computing subscale difficulties by country, they\ncould be inspected for relative difficulty or relative importance\nto each population.\nThe rationale behind these analyses was that it was impor-\ntant to determine whether our novel item selection procedure,\nbased on classical test theory (CTT), might have selected\nitems that were too similar on item difficulty as a result of\nbeing highly correlated with each other. CTT item selection\nprocedures have been criticized for having this bias (Bond &\nFox, 2015), as a scale composed of items of similar difficul-\nties will not adequately measure individual persons throughout\nthe extent of the latent trait, and thus may incorrectly assess\nthe latent trait score of persons either substantially above or\nsubstantially below that central tendency. In the case of the K-\nSF-42, we had endeavored to preserve the autonomy among\nthese subscales by the hierarchical design of our item selec-\ntion procedure, as we understood that limitation in advance\nand took that step to hopefully avoid it. That is why the CTT\nprocedure that we used only selected the best (most highly\ncorrelated) items within each subscale. We hypothesized that\nalthough the items within subscales might have similar item\ndifficulties, each of the aggregated 6-item subscales should\nnonetheless have different difficulties. Assessing difficulties\nwas in this case assessing their range of sensitivity of each\nof the subscales to the latent construct of LH speed (K). This\nlatter prediction was based on the premise underlying the\ndevelopment of the ALHB, where each of the subscales rep-\nresents a distinct domain-specific opportunity for an LH-based\nresource allocation decision to differentially invest (or not) in\nthat particular system of social relationships. As each specific\nresource allocation domain should have a different item diffi-\nculty in terms of LH speed, we should therefore be able to\nobserve substantial variance among the subscale difficulties.\nThe hierarchical item selection procedure that we used should\ntherefore enable the K-SF-42 to measure the full range of LH\nspeed (K) along the broader difficulty distribution of\nsubscales.\nGeneralizability analyses of item and subscale difficulties. The other\nimportant question that we hoped to address by these analyses\nwas whether the subscale difficulties differed substantially\nacross the sampled cultures. As we did not have enough data\nin each sample for a formal differential item functioning anal-\nTristan, 2006), we instead subjected the individual-level sub-\nscale difficulty estimates to general linear modeling (GLM) and\nGT analyses (Figueredo & Olderbak, 2008). We restricted these\nanalyses to aggregate subscale scores, as the cross-cultural\nFigueredo et al. 5\nfunctioning of the individual items within subscales was of\nlesser interest, for reasons already stated.\nA GLM was constructed, analogous to a two-way analysis\nof variance, where we tested for effects on the person-level\ndifficulty estimates of: (1) the different cross-cultural samples,\n(2) the different subscales, and (3) the two-way interaction\nbetween them. We then followed up with estimated mean\nsquares and variance components analysis using the same\ndesign to obtain estimates of the latent variance components\nhypothetically underlying these observed variances, first using\nType 1 and then using reweighted maximum likelihood\n(REML) estimation for comparison. Finally, we used these\nvariance component estimates to calculate generalizability\ncoefficients for each of the two random effects of interest with\nrespect to their interaction with each other, based on the Type 1\nand REML estimates obtained.\nResults\nTable 1 presents side-by-side comparisons of the internal con-\nsistencies of the K-SF-42 and the full ALHB for all five cross-\ncultural sites.

Across all five\ncross-cultural sites, only one scale (General Altruism) demon-\nstrated an appreciable decrease in internal reliability when\ngoing from the full ALHB to the K-SF-42 (mean\n = -.16).

When both\nshort forms were entered into a regression to predict the full\nALHB, the total explained variance was high (R2 range = range\n=[.89,.96]median= .93), indicatingthatthe two short formstaken\ntogether capture most of the variance of the full ALHB. The partial\nR2 for each short form represents the proportion of the variance\nthat is uniquely explained by that short form. In other words,\nit is the incremental validity of that short form over the other.\nAll partial R2s were statistically significant; however, the\npartial R2s of the K-SF-42 were approximately between 3.5\nand 11.5 times greater than those of the Mini-K Short Form\n(median = 4 times). This means that while the Mini-K Short\nForm and the K-SF-42 captured much of the same variance\nof the full ALHB, the K-SF-42 alone accounted for more\nuniquely; it had greater incremental validity.\nColumn 1 of Table 6 displays the standard deviations of the\nraw item difficulties within subscales. We believe that these\nwere adequate dispersions, with the possible exception of the\nGeneral Altruism subscale. Although we do not know why the\ndispersion among items for that one subscale was lower than\nthe others, we believe that these standard deviations generally\nindicate a reasonably adequate dispersion of the items within\nsubscales. Columns 2\u00ad5 of Table 6 display the standardized\nsubscale Infit/Outfit Mean Squares and standardized subscale\nInfit/Outfit Standard Deviations for each of the subscale scores.\nFor efficiency of presentation, subscale scores were aggregated\nacross all five cross-cultural samples. We believe these to be\nexcellent indices of both infit and outfit for all of the subcales,\nindicating an adequate data\u00admodel fit.\nTable 7 displays the results of our generalizability analyses of\nthe IRT-based subscale difficulties for the K-SF-42. We did not\nestimate the generalizability across cultures of individual item\nscores as these were of lesser interest given that using the CSGM\nmethod as a criterion for item selection does not guarantee preser-\nving optimal ranges of difficulties among items within subscales.\nFirst, the preliminary GLM shows that the preponderance of\nthe systematic variance in difficulties is accounted for by the\nmain effect of subscale (73.9%), supporting the greater var-\niance among subscales we predicted, with only relatively trivial\namounts accounted for by the main effect of Sample (7.9%)\nand the Sample \u00d7 Subscale interaction (18.1%), indicating that\nthe variance in difficulties among the different cross-cultural\nsamples was not very substantial and that the variance in the\nrank ordering of subscale difficulties different among cross-\ncultural samples was also relatively minor.\nSecond, we performed an expected mean squares analysis,\nmodeling both Sample and Subscale as random factors, such\nthat the interaction term (Sample \u00d7 Subscale) intruded on\neach of them and thus served as the common denominator\nterm for both main effects in all further calculations. This\npermitted the estimation of the hypothetical variance compo-\nnents by two convergent methods, hierarchical Type 1 sums\nof squares (conservatively assigning causal priority to\nSample) and REML, and these are tabulated for comparison\nwithin the last two columns.\nThird, these estimated variance components were used to\ncompute the following two generalizability coefficients, using\neach of these two estimation methods: (1) for Sample as the\nfocal facet, being generalized across the Sample \u00d7 Subscale\ninteraction as the random facet and (2) for Subscale as the\nfocal facet, being generalized across the Sample \u00d7 Subscale\ninteraction as the random facet. These indicated that the var-\niance in difficulties among cross-cultural samples did not\ngeneralize very well across the subscales (E2\nREML\n\u00bc :186), whereas indicated that the variance in diffi-\nculties among the subscales did generalize very well across the\ncross-cultural samples (E2\nREML\nresults were identical to three decimal places across estimation\nmethods and entirely in line with our predictions, supporting our\nclaim that the relative difficulties of the subscales are quite\nconsistent across cultures, indicating that the subscales function\nin similar ways in measuring the construct of interest.\nAs a visual illustration of these results, Figure 1 shows a\nconsistency in the relative difficulty of the seven subscales\nacross the five countries, a consistency observed in the \"all\"\ncountries category. The one apparent inconsistency is the fam-\nily scale difficulty for the Singapore sample. Specifically, the\nSingapore family score was rated as very easy in comparison to\nthe other four countries. This especially low score on that sub-\nscale, as compared with the other cross-cultural samples, may be\nattributable to traditional Asian family values ultimately based\non the \"filial piety\" preached by the Eastern Sage Confucius\nTable 3. Short-Long Form Correlations for Convergent Indicators\nof Life History Strategy in Australia (AU), Italy (IT), Mexico (MX),\nSingapore (SG), and the United States (US).\nScale/Subscale\nShort-Long Form Correlations*\nThe Arizona Life History Battery\n*All short-long form correlations are statistically significant at p < .05.\nFigueredo et al. 7\nDiscussion\nThe new and slightly longer short form of the ALHB (as com-\npared with the Mini-K), which we named the K-SF-42, per-\nformed very well with respect to various psychometric\nstandards against which it was evaluated. The K-SF-42 reduced\nthe number of items needed to assess slower LH from 199 items\nin the original ALHB to only 42 items in the new short form,\nand it did so with minimal losses of internal consistency relia-\nbility and convergent validity among the constituent subscales.\nWe believe that these psychometric indices of performance\nwould have been deemed adequate had we submitted the orig-\ninal interpersonal aggression study for publication using the\nK-SF-42 in place of the full ALHB; it is doubtful that any\nreasonable editor or peer reviewer would have been concerned\nwith the adequacy of reported psychometric benchmarks had\nthey not seen the slightly better ones provided by the full ALHB.\nIn addition, we found high correlations between the UW\nfactor scores for the reduced K-SF-42 subscales and the full\nALHB subscales, between the UW factor scores for the overall\nK-SF-42 and ALHB, and even between the UW factor scores\nfor the overall K-SF-42 and Mini-K. Treating the K-SF-42 as a\nunitary scale, irrespective of internal subscale structure, we\nfound small but statistically significant improvements in the\nK-SF-42 with respect to the Mini-K in their internal consis-\ntency reliabilities and predictive validity coefficients in relation\nto the full ALHB. Testing for incremental validity of the K-SF-\n42 with respect to the Mini-K in predicting the full ALHB\nscore, we found their overlap to be quite substantial, but the\nunique proportions of variance predicted by the K-SF-42 to be\nsubstantially greater in magnitude predicted than those pre-\ndicted by the Mini-K, although these latter variance compo-\nnents were also statistically significant.\nWe therefore conclude that the K-SF-42 has been developed\nsuch that it performs optimally across all five cultures sampled,\nand that these results will perhaps prove to generalize similarly\nto most other modern industrial societies that were not cur-\nrently sampled as a result of the geographic breadth of those\nincluded in the present study. We would therefore recommend\nthe K-SF-42 for use over the Mini-K for situations in which\nthe total acceptable response burden of the study can bear the\nweight of more than 20 items but less than 199 items for the\npsychometric assessment of LH strategy.\nAs the K-SF-42 has been newly introduced with the present\narticle, there are as yet no data on its predictive validity. Nev-\nertheless, we believe that the magnitudes of the reported cor-\nrelations of the K-SF-42 with both the Mini-K and the full\nALHB are sufficiently high that we can confidently expect that\nits predictive validities would be comparable to the latter, lying\nsomewhere between that of the Mini-K and the full ALHB, and\nmoderated only by its intermediate reliability. As cited above,\nthe meta-analytically disattenuated correlation coefficient ()\nbetween the Mini-K and the full ALHB was .91 (Figueredo\net al., 2014); although we do not yet have sufficient data on the\nK-SF-42 to make such a precise estimate, there is not reason to\nbelieve that it would not be even higher, given the evidence\nthat we presented in the present article. Under that assumption,\nit is a straightforward logical inference to predict that the K-SF-\n42 should have stronger predictive power than the Mini-K for\nall criterion variables that have been assessed so far.\nFinally, we have validated a novel methodology for produc-\ning cross-culturally valid short forms of longer measures using\nthe CSGM method for optimal item selection. We have also\ncross-validated this novel method using IRT Rasch analyses of\nthe item and subscale difficulty levels, followed by GT analy-\nses that showed acceptable levels of consistency in the rank\nordering of aggregate subscale difficulties across the cultures\nsampled. Thus, we have shown that the CSGM method can\nproduce psychometrically acceptable and robust results, at least\nin application to the present data.\nWe understand that we have not conformed to the conven-\ntional \"best practices\" psychometric standards in these\nTable 4.

Nevertheless, we have com-\npared the performance of this novel method with those of a\nmore conventional one, and we interpret the results of the IRT\nRasch analyses and associated GT analyses as generally sup-\nporting the efficacy of the CSGM method for creating the\nK-SF-42, in that: (1) The dispersion of item difficulties within\neach subscale sufficiently covered each content domain, (2)\nthe dispersion among aggregate subscale difficulties within\nthe overall K-SF-42 scale also showed a satisfactory degree\nof coverage, and (3) the rank ordering of subscale difficulties\nacross samples showed a relatively high degree of cross-\ncultural invariance.\nTable 6.
