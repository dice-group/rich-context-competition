The population aged 65 and older is often analyzed in three categories: young-old (65\u00ad74), middle-old\n(75\u00ad84), and oldest-old (85). This may blind heterogeneity within the oldest category. New, large data sets allow ex-\namination of the very oldest-old (e.g., aged 95) and contrasts with those who are younger.\nMethods. We determined the annual change of prevalence of physical and cognitive function, and of disease prob-\nlems in the old to very oldest-old, using data from existing Resident Assessment Instrument records from nursing homes\ndents aged 100 or older. We computed the prevalence, by age, of selected conditions: physical and cognitive function,\ndiseases, problem behavior, mood disturbance, restraint use, falls, weight loss, eating less, body mass index, chewing\nand swallowing problems, incontinence (bowel and bladder), catheter use, and selected diagnoses.\nResults. Prevalence of all measures of physical and cognitive dysfunction increased most rapidly with each year of\nage among the very oldest-old. Most of the slope changes occurred from 95 to 100 years of age. Such changes are less\npronounced or not seen in measures of disease prevalence.\nConclusions. Accelerated change in prevalence of dysfunction seen in the nursing home population may suggest a\nchange in the mechanisms of aging that occur after the mid-nineties. Examination of the very oldest-old may provide\nnew insight into the nature of the aging process.\nHE population of the United States, as of virtually all\nthe world, is aging rapidly and with the greatest relative\nthe total U.S. population grew by 39%, the number of per-\npopulation, because the size of younger populations will\nhave declined (2,3).\nThese demographic changes are of considerable impor-\ntance, for although the oldest-old account even now for only\n1.2% of the entire population and only 10% of those aged\n65 or older, they disproportionately use the health care sys-\ntem, often at public expense. For example, Pawlson in 1994\ncalculated that the rate of nursing home institutionalization\nDespite the importance of the aging population, there has\nbeen little research specifically aimed at the population\naged 90 and older or 95 and older. Prior research often\ngrouped subjects into an older than 85 category, despite\nsome evidence of differences in the resource utilization of\nnonagenarians and centenarians compared with younger se-\nniors. One study found that average total cost per hospital-\nization progressively declines after ages 70\u00ad79. In fact, it\nsuggested that the oldest-old may be a select group of indi-\nviduals who are healthier than the younger cohorts (5).\nThe division of the elderly population into three age\ngroups--the young-old (often 65\u00ad74 years), the middle-old\ngested by Suzman and Riley (6), although they noted that\nthe thresholds for each group are somewhat arbitrary and\nthat future definitions of the last category might more ap-\npropriately be advanced to older ages. Still, such classifica-\ntion is widely accepted and responds to the differences\nacross these three age brackets in physical and mental\nhealth and in the use of care resources (7,8).\nOur research focuses on the characteristics of the oldest-\nold by using data newly available from one subpopulation:\nthose in nursing homes. With extremely large sample\nsizes--full nursing home populations for multiple states--\nwe can examine the multiple dysfunctions, morbidities and\ncomorbidities, disabilities, and disease diagnoses seen in\nnonagenarians and centenarians in this setting. Although\nmany researchers focus on age 85 as a critical age for accel-\nerated decline, we consider whether there is yet another age\nthreshold, in the nineties, at which the structure of the aging\nprocess changes again. If true, this suggests a more ad-\nvanced segment of the age continuum: a fourth era--the\nvery oldest-old--consisting of those aged 95 or older.\nT\nMETHODS\nIn this study, we examined the relationship between the\nprevalence of selected conditions and age in those aged 80\nData\nWe selected all individuals aged 80 or older from data\nrepresenting all nursing home residents in seven states dur-\nsippi, South Dakota, Maine, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania.\nWhen we had multiple assessments of the same individual,\nwe chose only the most recent assessment, i.e., each indi-\nvidual at the oldest age. All assessments were performed us-\ning the National Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI)/\nMinimum Data Set (MDS) mandated for use in virtually ev-\nery nursing home in the United States (all homes eligible to\nreceive federal funding under Conditions of Participation)\non resident admission and significant change, and at least\nannually. The assessment is performed by facility staff, us-\ning all available sources of information, including the resi-\ndent, staff, family, and the medical record.\nThe MDS, with more than 350 items, covers a broad set\nof domains, including physical and mental function, dis-\neases, psychosocial status, mood and behavior disturbances,\ncontinence, and treatments (9). In multiple studies, most\nMDS items achieved good interobserver reliability ( statis-\ntic  0.6) and many--including measures of Activities of\nDaily Living (ADL) function and cognition--achieved ex-\ncellent reliability (10). For example, the reliability of key\nindicators includes .88 for decision making, .92 for ADL\nself-performance items, and .63 for behavior problems.\nOnly a few items had less than good reliability, although all\nachieved acceptable  values (0.4). We attribute these\ngood results not only to the design of the instrument, but\nalso to its purpose: to improve care through improved care\nplans. With a clinical rationale for its completion and prag-\nmatic directions on how to use the information gathered,\nnursing home staff appear to perform accurate assessments\nMeasures\nWe analyzed 34 measures selected a priori from a range\nof domains. The first domain addressed how elderly resi-\ndents function in their environment and comprised indica-\ntors of ADL self-performance, decision making, and short-\nterm memory loss. The second set addressed several aspects\nof the elderly residents' adaptation to their situation, includ-\ning manifested problem behavior (verbal abuse, physical\nabuse, and socially inappropriate behavior), demonstrated\nmood disturbance (anxiety, depression, and no involvement\nin facility activities), and the use of trunk restraints. We\nadded a third set of items indicating clinical conditions and\neating less, body mass index (used numerically), chewing\nproblems, swallowing problems, incontinence (bowel and\nbladder), and catheter use. Finally, we considered diagnoses\nreflecting prevalent diseases of an elderly population (ar-\nthritis, cerebrovascular accident [CVA], cancer, diabetes,\nAlzheimer's disease, other dementias, congestive heart fail-\nure, arteriosclerotic heart disease [ASHD], and hyperten-\nsion). In all cases in which multiple levels were available,\nwe examined the presence of the most dependent level.\n(Measures of the least dependent levels usually demon-\nstrated relationships with age that were the mirror image of\nthe most dependent levels, and intermediate levels were ex-\npectedly uninteresting.)\nFor two of the most important functional domains for\nnursing home care--ADLs and cognitive performance--we\nused known summary scales. The RUG-III ADL Index (12)\nsuccinctly summarizes residents' self-performance in four\nlate-loss ADLs: bed mobility, bed\u00adchair transfer, eating,\nand toileting. From a range of 4 (independence in all four\nADLs) to 18 (total dependence in all four), we examined the\nThe MDS Cognitive Performance Scale (13) (CPS) sum-\nmarizes the MDS cognitive measures. Five items are com-\nbined into a categorical functional scale that ranges from\n\"totally functional\" to \"very severely impaired.\" The CPS\ncorresponds closely with scores from the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) and the Test for Severe Impairment.\nWe considered the two most severely impaired categories\n(severely and very severely impaired, MMSE score  6).\nThe category of severely impaired CPS corresponds to the\nhighly impaired value of the MDS decision-making vari-\nable; the latter variable was thus dropped from the analysis.\nAnalysis\nInitial examinations of the data considered average prev-\nand 95. For several variables, large differences were seen\nin the last two periods, encouraging more detailed examina-\ntion of the very oldest-old.\nWe computed the average prevalence of each measure at\neach individual age from 80 to 105. Changes in prevalence\nare similar to but not equivalent to the incidence of these\nconditions, because a person could acquire but be cured of a\ndisease or die within the year (whether or not the death was\nrelated to the condition). Visual examination indicated that\nfor younger ages (e.g., 80\u00ad90), the changes were relatively\nlinear; for older ages, the increases were either linear with a\nlarger slope or curvilinear with increasing slopes. To detect\nthis change in slope, we employed piecewise regression\nmodels to examine how the prevalence of each measure\nchanged with age (although many other models could have\nbeen used). For each measure, we optimized a model com-\nposed of two straight lines joined to form a continuous rela-\ntionship, with a change in slope at a specified breakpoint.\nSimilar models have been used by Chambers and Hastie\n(14). The model required fitting four parameters: the inter-\ncept and slope of the younger line segment (from age 80 to\nthe breakpoint), the slope of the older line (from the break-\npoint to age 106), and the breakpoint age (where the two\nlines are joined). We used weights proportional to the num-\nber of nursing home residents of each age, to accommodate\nfor variance heterogeneity of the age-specific prevalence\npercentages. However, the primary results using weighted\nand nonweighted models were similar, and we report here\nthe unweighted results. The optimal breakpoint value was\nestimated by \"profiling the objective function\" (15): for\neach possible breakpoint (from 85 to 100), the best piece-\nwise linear model was fit (two slopes and the intercept), us-\ning least squares. Then, across the range of breakpoints, the\noptimal model of this class was chosen to minimize the ob-\njective function: the sum of squared residuals. Assuming\nthat the two-slope model adequately represents the preva-\nlence by age, we tested the hypothesis of a change in slope\nat the breakpoint by comparing the residual sum of squares\nfor a simple linear model and for the optimal piecewise lin-\near model, using an F test. This test likely underestimates\nthe hypothesis because there is also uncertainty in the esti-\nmation of the breakpoint. Given this and potential concerns\nabout multiple comparisons, we chose a conservative threshold\nfor the F statistic ( p  .01). With our large samples, almost\nany comparison is statistically significant, so we considered\nwhether contrasts were substantive rather than relying solely\non statistical comparisons.\nThe models generally showed adequate goodness of fit in\nplotted residuals. We stress that our primary purpose was to\ndemonstrate that there was a marked change in the slope\naround some approximate age, not that a linear model was\nsufficient to describe the relationship of prevalence with\nage, especially after any specific age. It may also be that a\nhigher order (e.g., cubic) model might be fit across the en-\ntire age domain, but this would mask that the relationship\nfor the younger ages was close to linear and that the older ages\nfollowed a different model. Finally, we do not suggest that the\nchange in slope was cataclysmic at some particular age; rather,\nwithin some particular range of ages there was a change from\na model of linear increase to one of accelerated prevalence.\nRESULTS\ncentenarians. Each individual age from 80 through 101 was\nFigure 1 shows a plot typical for measures of functional\nimpairment, here severely impaired cognition. As expected,\nthe prevalence of severe impairment increases with age,\nrepresenting an average gradual decline. Prevalence in-\ncreases linearly from 22.6% at age 80 to mid-twenty per-\ncents in the late nineties, after which there is a shift in the\nannual change of prevalence, which rises to 34.6% by age\n104. Fitting a piecewise model, also displayed, a slope\nchange was found at approximately age 97. This model has\nan average increase of 0.2% per year (\"younger\" slope) for\nThus, the fitted model indicates a slope change of 0.9% per\nMany of the measures examined demonstrated these\ncharacteristics. Table 1 details the optimal model for each\nmeasure. The \"younger\" slope (e.g., the per year change in\nprevalence around age 80) for most conditions was of the\nexpected sign, indicating increasing prevalence of the\npoorer outcomes. However, several measures had substan-\ntial and statistically significant age-specific changes toward\nlower prevalence of poor outcomes: depression, diabetes,\nhypertension, and CVA.\nSeven measures demonstrated no significant slope\nchanges from 80\u00ad105 years (as indicated by testing whether\nthe piecewise-linear model was superior to simple linear\nmodel), including cancer, body mass index, falls 31\u00ad180\ndays prior, swallowing problems, and two behavior prob-\nlems. For the remaining measures, we considered the mag-\nnitude of the slope change. Small to moderate slope changes\nwere found for 18 measures, representing all the remaining\nclinical conditions and complications, all but one of the di-\nagnoses, the remaining two behavior problems, and trunk\nrestraint. Large late-life differences in the age-specific prev-\nalence of conditions were seen for all measures of func-\ntionality, including all the ADL measures, incontinence,\ncognitive function, and a single diagnosis--arthritis. Some\nmeasures declined slightly in people in their eighties but in-\ncreased in the late nineties: daily inappropriate behavior,\nfalls (in 30 days), weight loss, and lack of involvement in\nactivities. However, for most measures (including all the\nmeasures of functionality listed earlier), the nineties pre-\nsaged a more substantial annual increment in prevalence.\nThe piecewise model also estimated the breakpoint--the\ninflection point between the two linear slopes. It is impor-\ntant to stress that our selection of the two-slope model was\nintended to depict the change in slope and not to focus on a\nparticular age inflection point. Nevertheless, the break-\npoints indicate the general range of ages after which the pri-\nmary linear model fails to fit the data. The majority of the\nbreakpoints are in the mid or late nineties. The six at the\nlower (age 85) or upper (age 100) bounds of the search indi-\ncate a relationship with slopes continually increasing or de-\ncreasing with age near these boundaries.\nFinally, to address possible confounding with admission\nstatus, we divided our sample into those with stays 90\ndays and those relatively newly admitted. The results were\nvirtually identical (data not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nThe prevalence of many adverse conditions in the elderly\npopulation increases every year of age after 80. Based on an\nalmost unprecedentedly large sample, even of centenarians,\nFigure 1. Two-slope model for severe cognitive impairment\nthese findings in nursing home residents extend those of\nothers such as Kane and Kane (16), who found that in the\ngeneral population the cross-sectional prevalence of disabil-\nity, measured in several different ways, increases with age.\nHowever, we find that for many conditions the change in\nprevalence for each increasing year of age remains rela-\ntively constant until the mid-nineties, and thereafter the an-\nnual changes are substantively greater. Accelerated changes\nare seen for measures of how well an old person functions,\nincluding physical or mental functioning: dysfunction in\nADL and cognitive performance (with the sole exception of\nshort-term memory). In contrast, all measures of adaption\n(behavior, mood, and restraint use) show small or no\nchanges in slope, as do all clinical conditions and diagnoses\n(except arthritis). When detected, changes in slope gener-\nally occur in the mid-nineties. We are not aware of other\nstudies detecting these changes.\nOther of our results corroborate findings of other re-\nsearchers, such as Smith (17), that the prevalence of certain\ndiseases, including cancer, diabetes, and CVA, declines in\nlate life. We expect that this is due to selective survival:\nthese diseases are persistent and often directly or indirectly\nlinked to mortality.\nOur results should be interpreted critically, as our study\nhas several limitations. One is the nature of the sample: our\nview is restricted to the population in nursing homes. Only\n2% of those aged 65\u00ad74 live in a nursing home, but this per-\nTable 1.

Although substantial propor-\ntions of persons older than 80 reside in nursing homes, and\nhalf of those in the oldest age groups, our sample cannot be\nrepresentative of elderly persons living in the community. A\ncombination of medical, cognitive, and functional prob-\nlems, compounded with the behavior of informal and formal\ncaregivers in recommending or accepting nursing home\nplacement, causes certain individuals to enter nursing homes.\nWhether the same accelerated decline manifests itself in a\ncommunity-based elderly population can only be conjec-\ntured. Second, we cannot infer causality (e.g., confirming\nthe effects of selective survival). Our next step will be lon-\ngitudinal analysis, following individuals across time, to\nmeasure the incidence of conditions and identify precipitat-\ning events. A third possible issue is the unknown effects of\nnursing home admission practices or quality of care. Fourth,\nthere may also be unknown measurement effects that under-\nor overreport particular diseases or conditions in the very\noldest-old. For example, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dis-\nease or dementia may not be made in the very old, as it may\nbe looked upon as to be expected, or the physician, family,\nor resident may avoid such designation or decision on etiol-\nogy. This may be a reason for our different models for Alzhei-\nmer's disease and cognitive performance. Although MDS\nitems have demonstrated good to excellent reliability, these\nstudies have not been performed particularly on the oldest-\nold. Fifth, our findings may be a cohort effect rather than\nage-related changes in prevalence, a concern that can be ad-\ndressed when we have data across a longer period of time or\nfrom other cultures. Sixth, we have not tested if the phe-\nnomenon is limited to a subset of the very oldest-old, such\nas females, or those with specific comorbidities; such analy-\nsis is currently under way. Finally, there may be technical\nissues with the analysis. The relationship between preva-\nlence and age is unlikely to have a radical change at any\nspecific age but rather can be expected to follow some\nhigher order (and more complex) curve with a gradual ac-\ncelerating prevalence. We observed a linear relationship in\noctogenarians and used our piecewise model to identify\nwhere this linearity ceased. Still, the choice of our model\ncould bias our results and the effects of error intrinsic in the\nfitting of the models and particularly in determining break-\npoints have not been fully evaluated.\nNevertheless, although we acknowledge these possible\nproblems, none provides a plausible explanation for the spe-\ncific findings we focus on here--change in prevalence of\nbroad measures of functionality in the mid-nineties in a\nlarge sample of institutionalized older persons. In this popu-\nlation, each additional acute or subacute problem over the\nyears may have an accumulated effect, comparable to the\ncascade-breakdown phenomenon, in which more acute\nproblems result in rapid terminal deterioration. The accu-\nmulated effects could compromise physiological reserves\npast the threshold needed for performance (20). Thus, the\nhuman body would wear out and experience a compressed\nperiod of change beyond the direct effects of disease.\nOur results demonstrate that something different happens\nto elderly persons who survive into their mid-nineties--a\nmore rapid rate of decline. Although this research does not\nprovide an etiology of this change, it is associated with\nfunctionality rather than disease morbidity and is mani-\nfested in a very large and geographically broad population\nof institutionalized elderly persons. It was detected only by\nthe availability of extremely numerous microdata on this\npopulation, which may only be available from large admin-\nistrative data sets such as the MDS. The presence of this\nphenomenon provides justification for future efforts to ex-\namine centenarians separately: indeed, there appear to be\ndifferences between the very oldest-old and their younger\ncounterparts. Physicians caring for the very oldest-old\nmight take special care to understand functional deficits,\nwhich at times can be reversed or managed, rather than fo-\ncusing on diseases that often cannot be cured.\n"
